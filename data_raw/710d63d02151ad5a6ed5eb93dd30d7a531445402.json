            "text": "Obesity and insulin resistance are primary risk factors for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide Ethanolamine (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. These compounds with improved drug properties may be useful in PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204605 October 25, 2018 1 / 28 OPEN ACCESS Citation: Bhagat HA, Compton SA, Musso DL, Laudeman CP, Jackson KMP, Yi NY, et al.

            "text": "Niclosamide was originally developed and marketed as a molluscicide by Bayer in the late 1950s; it was later found to be an effective anti-helmintic and has been used in the clinic for decades to treat intestinal tapeworm infections in humans [1, 2] . Niclosamide exerts its antihelmintic effect by uncoupling the electron transport chain from ATP synthase preventing the synthesis of ATP, an essential energy molecule for cell metabolism [3, 4] . Historically, the use of mitochondrial uncouplers in humans has been avoided due to their low therapeutic index [5] . Indeed, the best known mitochondrial uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) increases metabolic rate and stimulates loss of body fat but has been associated with severe toxicity including fatal increases in body temperature [5] [6] [7] . This side effect may be overcome by liver specific targeting of DNP which has been shown to improve its therapeutic index up to 50-fold [8] . In contrast to DNP, niclosamide has been shown to be relatively safe when delivered as a single 2-gram oral dose to treat intestinal cestode infections. This is largely due to its poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and high plasma protein binding that significantly limit its tissue distribution [1] . On the other hand, this also limits the usefulness of niclosamide to treat other diseases where systemic exposure is required. Several other studies have linked niclosamide treatment to genotoxic effects as measured by increased sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and chromosome aberrations (CA) in bone marrow cells or sperm head abnormalities in mice [9, 10] . Niclosamide also generates point mutations in Salmonella sp and clastogenic effects in human lymphocytes [9, 10] . Therefore, while niclosamide has been shown to be relatively safe after a single dose, it is unclear if chronic treatment with niclosamide would lead to adverse effects.",

            "text": "Despite possible concerns over bioavailability and genotoxicity, interest in niclosamide has risen dramatically over recent years, concomitant with the movement towards repurposing approved drugs. Indeed, niclosamide has been identified in several screens as a compound with broad anti-cancer activity. This has been attributed to its ability to regulate multiple cellular signaling pathways frequently dysregulated in cancer biology including nuclear factor-\u03baB, JAK1-STAT3, Wnt/Beta Catenin, Wnt/Frizzeld1, mTORC1/AMPK and NOTCH [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Niclosamide has also been proposed as a treatment of a variety of other indications including neuropathic pain, bacterial and viral infections and metabolic disease [11, 14, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . We also identified niclosamide in a high throughput screen focused on identifying modulators of nonclassical peroxisome biogenesis with potential for alleviating the symptoms of dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome [23] . Two salt forms of niclosamide with improved solubility, Niclosamide ethanolamine salt (NEN) and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have been shown to attenuate hepatic steatosis and glucose metabolism in murine models of high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) [3, 23, 24] . However, the mechanism for niclosamide's beneficial effect on hepatic steatosis and whole-body glucose metabolism remains unclear. Such effects may be mediated by mild mitochondrial uncoupling, increased energy expenditure and increased lipid metabolism, or the ability of niclosamide and NEN to block hepatic glucagon signaling pathway [3, 25] . Regardless of the underlying mechanism, when compared to niclosamide, NEN and NPP have improved oral bioavailability and retain activity in mouse models of T2D and metabolic disease [3, 24] . Moreover, despite their mild mitochondrial uncoupling activity, both are well tolerated in vivo and do not appear to exert any adverse effects on body temperature [3] . To our knowledge, the effect of these salt forms of niclosamide on genotoxicity have not been reported, however, we anticipate that both salts would be similarly genotoxic as niclosamide.",

Image analysis was performed using the open source Cell Profiler software and used for cell identification, feature extraction and data tabulation [28] . A two-pass (high/low) thresholding process was used to identify both the nuclei and cytoplasm in the Hoechst-33342 channel and a pipeline was developed to automatically identify nuclei, cytoplasm and for feature extraction. Cell level data was analyzed in JMP12 (SAS, Cary NC). Hundreds of primary features per cell were generated based on the intensity measurements and morphological characteristics. We employed a Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression analysis method to identify the most important cellular features and reduced the data set to a single scoring system that is tolerant to outliers for hepatic steatosis [29] . The typical steatotic \"fingerprint\" score represents approximately 45 individual features including lipid droplet count, intensity, size and cellular morphology. Data were normalized to percent control (NPC) using the equation NPC = (X i--C -)/(C + -C -) x100, where X i is the raw value, C + plate mean of positive control, Cplate mean of negative control [30] . The values were averaged and compounds were identified as positive hits if they reduced steatotic phenotype by more than 45% relative to maximum signal control and they were dose responsive. Z 0 -values were calculated using Z 0 = 1-[3(\u03c3 p +\u03c3 n )/(\u03bc p -\u03bc n )] where \u03bc is the mean and \u03c3 is the standard deviation of (p) positive and (n) negative controls.",

            "text": "Using this SAR strategy, we synthesized and tested 195 N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives in the DNL assay (S1 Table) . All newly synthesized compounds were tested in dose response format using 10-point, 2-fold dilutions ranging between 1\u03bcM and 1.9nM. Compounds were considered active if they exhibited >45% effect in the DNL assay and if they displayed a sigmoidal dose response. Of those tested, 52 compounds were designated as active. Fig 2 shows data from 11 representatives of the N-substituted phenylbenzamide class. The predicted solubility at pH 7.4, clogP and cLogD values and IC 50 for each derivative are shown. We compared the IC 50 of each of the 11 compounds with that of niclosamide. 500873, 600494 and 600489 were found to be significantly more potent than niclosamide, with IC 50 values of 0.005, 0.004 and 0.01\u03bcM respectively. In contrast, 600657 was by far the least potent compound with an IC 50 of 1.6mM. Of note, several of the compounds including 500200 and 500873 produced inverse concentration curves. Of the 11 compounds, 7 had greater predicted solubility compared to niclosamide that was -4.76 logS. In particular, the predicted solubility of 600657 was best with a value of -0.36 logS which was followed by 600494 (-2.16 logS), 500200 (-2.21 logS) and 500873 (-2.51 logS) (Fig 2) . Calculated cLogP values, a measure of hydrophobicity, are also shown in Fig 2 and with the exception of 600657 all compounds were more lipophilic compared to niclosamide and all of them are below 5.0 with the exception of 600453 with a clogP value of 6.1.",

Having identified a number of phenylbenzamides with in vitro activity for attenuating the hepatic steatosis phenotype, we next explored the effect of these structural changes on OCR using the MitoXpress Xtra-Oxygen Consumption Assay kit (Luxcel Biosciences). Due to the very low basal respiration rate of PH5CH8 cells, OCR was measured in a HEK293 cell line stably expressing human OCT3. As positive controls, we included carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), a well-known uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, and niclosamide, both of which increased OCR in cells compared to the DMSO control were tested alongside select phenylbenzamide derivatives (Fig 3) . Interestingly, the phenylbenzamides derivatives produced varied responses in the OCR assay ranging from no change in respiration for 500200, 600657, 600489, 500873, and 600494 to significant changes for 500199, 600655, 600653, 500833, and 500832. Niclosamide, 600655, 600653, and 500199 showed a dose dependent increase in OCR whereas 500833 and 500832 were only significantly elevated at 1\u03bcM. In contrast to other phenylbenzamide derivatives, 600453 significantly decreased OCR at all concentrations above 300nM.",

As validation of these changes in lipid metabolism and cellular respiration we evaluated phospho-AMPK Thr-172 Niclosamide analogs attenuate obesity related changes in high fat diet fed mice (p-AMPK) levels by Western blot in HEK293 cells treated with the phenylbenzamide derivatives.

However, 600453 appeared to stimulate phosphorylation of AMPK without changes in oxygen consumption. Compound 600657 did not appear to stimulate phosphorylation of AMPK or increase oxygen consumption rate and 600489 stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK only at the highest concentration but had no effect on oxygen consumption rate at the concentrations tested.",

We tested the in vitro intrinsic clearance of select compounds in human liver microsomes (HLM) and mouse liver microsomes (MLM) using verapamil as a control for poor stability (Table 1) . Verapamil performed as expected as assessed by the percentage of the initial concentration of compound remaining after 1 hour with only 7.5% and 4.5% remaining after 60 min in HLM and MLM preparations respectively. In general, all other compounds exhibited good microsomal stability. As anticipated, compounds were more stable in MLM relative to HLM. 600494 exhibited the greatest metabolic stability with 99.4% and 109.6% of the initial concentration remaining after 60 minutes in HLM and MLM respectively. Similarly, 84.5% and 101.2% of the starting material remained after 60 minutes in HLM and MLM respectively for 500200. On the other hand, 600453 and 500873 were stable in MLM, but in HLM only 58.8% and 64.2% of the initial concentration remained after 60 minutes (Table 1) . Of the compounds reported here, only 600489 was found to be completely degraded after 60 min with 3.1% remaining in HLM and 2.7% remaining in MLM. We next explored pharmacokinetics profiles in Sprague Dawley rats following oral and IV administration of four of these compounds that had previously exhibited good microsomal stability. In a previous study, a 5mg/kg oral dose of niclosamide in rats leads to a peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 354ng/ml and half-life of 6.7 hours [45] . Three of the four phenylbenzamide derivatives had significantly improved oral bioavailability compared to niclosamide. Indeed, a single oral dose of 5mg/kg of 600453 formulated in PBS gave a peak plasma concentration of 2050ng/ml in rats with the half-life of 3.9 hours which correlated to 64%F. Similarly, oral administration of 600494 led to a peak plasma concentration of 1850ng/ml and 5.3-hour half-life and 14%F while, 500873 reached a peak of 912ng/ml and 3.3-hour half-life resulting in 10%F (Table 2) . Therefore, by selectively modifying the phenylbenzamide functional groups, we were able to significantly improve the bioavailability by up to 30 times that of niclosamide. The half-lives (t 1/2 ) of 600453 and 600494 in rats were 3.9 and 4.6 hours respectively and greater than 1.5 hours more than that reported for NEN in mice [3, 46] . These values remain high enough to be suitable for advancement to clinical development.",

These mice exhibit massive hyperglycemia, obesity, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and pro-inflammatory cytokines by 16-20-weeks [49, 50] . Singly housed 20-week old male mice raised on a 60%-fat diet were tested for glucose sensitivity using the glucose tolerance test (GTT). Animals were then treated with 5mg/kg niclosamide or vehicle for 7 days and GTT was performed again. Compared to sham animals that had blood glucose levels of 350mg/dL at 60 minutes niclosamide treated animals exhibited statistically significant reduction in glucose levels to 250mg/dL (Fig 6A) . Overall niclosamide reduced plasma glucose levels from approximately 400mg/dL to 275mg/dL over the 7-day period (Fig 6B) . This is consistent with previous studies showing improved glucose metabolism in mouse models of metabolic disease [3, 24, 25] . We next measured body weight changes in HFD-fed animals prior to treatment with niclosamide or phenylbenzamide derivatives and after 12 days, prior to sacrifice. During this time, all animals (including sham) lost some weight. However, 500199 and 600453 treated animals lost significantly more weight when compared to sham animals in the same trial (Table 4) . 500873 treated animals also lost weight but this loss failed to reach significance (p>0.05).

Given the correlation between AMPK and lipid metabolism we explored the possibility that niclosamide activates AMPK in vivo. 20-week old male mice raised on a 60%-fat diet were treated with niclosamide at 5 or 25mg/kg for 12 days via a daily (IP) injection with DMSO as the vehicle. TA98  TA-100  TA-1535  TA-1537  WP2 uvrA (pKM101)   S9-SP9+  S9-SP9+  S9-SP9+  S9-SP9+  S9 Sham animals were administered vehicle on the same schedule. To determine if AMPK is activated in vivo in response to niclosamide we measured p-AMPK Thr-172, as phosphorylation at this site is absolutely required for AMPK activity and widely used in the AMPK field as a surrogate for kinase activity [51, 52] . AMPK was significantly upregulated in vivo by low and high doses of niclosamide ( Fig 6C) . We also observed a significant reduction in the expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) at the highest concentration of niclosamide ( Fig 6C) . It is of interest to note that in previous studies we also identified carbonic anhydrase-III (CAIII) as a hepatic protein altered in HFD fed-DIO mice that was down regulated by niclosamide treatment and positively correlates with the extent of ectopic lipid accumulation [31] . 500199, 500200 and 600453 were also analyzed for effects on p-AMPK Thr-172, FAS and CAIII using Western blot analysis. These studies showed that treatment of HFD fed-DIO mice with 10mg/kg of 500199, 500200 and 600453 for 12 days also stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172, and reduced FAS and CAIII protein levels when compared to sham mice (Fig 6D) .",

To compare the ability of the novel benzamides to improve hepatic steatosis, 60%-fat fed DIO mice were treated with niclosamide or one if its derivatives for 12 days and the livers were immediately examined for changes in gross morphology. With the exception of liver from 500832 treated animals, all livers from treated animals showed improvements in morphology within 12 days. The livers of treated animals became darker red in color compared to the sham HFD-fed animals, which were visibly lighter and tan in color due to ectopic fat accumulation. Histological analysis of the Table 4 . Niclosamide analogs attenuate hepatic steatosis in high fat diet fed mice. 20-week old HFD-fed mice were delivered vehicle or compound daily at 10mg/kg by I.P for 12 days. Body weight measurements and scoring of greasy coat phenotype were performed prior to and following treatment. Histological analysis of H&E stained liver sections were analyzed and the % of steatosis and steatosis score are reported. lower left lobe from all treated mice showed an improvement in macro-and micro-steatosis within 12 days, with the exception of mice treated with 500832. The pattern of steatosis was also altered, with animals treated with niclosamide and 500199 being almost completely cleared of steatosis. Most notably, clearance of lipids was observed predominately from zone-1 in 500199 treated animals. Representative images of liver tissues from mice fed standard chow (10% fat diet) or HFD-fed animals (60% HFD) treated with niclosamide, 500199 or Sham animals are shown in Fig 7A-7D . The steatosis score was used to evaluate the livers, scoring microvesicular or macrovesicular steatosis and fatty infiltration zonality [32] . Niclosamide treated animals had variable degrees of steatosis ranging from 15-70% with a mean steatosis of 45% and a steatosis score of 2.0 (Table 4 ). In contrast, sham animals typically had greater than 70% steatosis resulting in a steatosis score of 3.0 (Table 4 ). Similar to niclosamide, 600453 and 500199 reduced the mean percentage of steatosis to 38% and 19% respectively resulting in a steatosis score of 1. Other analogs including 600489 (24% steatosis), 500200 (28% steatosis), 500873 (28% steatosis), and 600494 (25% steatosis) also exhibited reduced steatosis with a score of 1.25 (Table 4 ). In some cases, livers more closely resembled livers from standard chow fed mouse with \ufffd5% steatosis despite being maintained on the HFD during the 12 days of treatment. 600653 and 500832 had a more modest effect on hepatic steatosis compared to other phenylbenzamides tested and these had a steatosis score of 1.75 and 2.75 respectively. 20-week old animals were treated IP with 500199 at 10 or 25mg/kg by IP over a time-course of 9 days. At day 0, 3, 6 and 9 animals were weighed and tissue samples were collected for standard histological scoring of hepatic steatosis and automated quantitative histomorphometric scoring. Using the standard histological scoring method, all 500199 treated animals showed a time and dose dependent improvement in steatosis score (Fig 8A) . In addition, all animals showed a gradual decline in body weight. However no statistically significant difference was observed between treatment groups and sham animals (Fig 8B) .",

Animals treated with 500199 showed a dose dependent improvement in steatotic phenotype with a score of 0.57 \u00b1 0.19 (p\ufffd0.018) and 0.13 \u00b1 0.17 (p\ufffd0.0001) for 10 and 25mg/kg doses respectively. This quantitative analysis can be used along-side comprehensive manual histological scoring to measure changes in the steatotic phenotype including changes in macrosteatosis and microsteatosis, lipid droplet size, zonal lipid distribution, and lipid droplet count. In addition to changes in hepatic steatosis, we regularly observed that the coats of treated animals were drier, consistent with reduction in triglycerides, as has been observed in the DGAT1 mouse knockout with dry coat (Fig 8D and 8E ) [53] . Animals were scored with regards to their oily coat phenotype with +++ representing an oily coat and ++ and + progressively drier phenotype. Although the effect was difficult to quantify as the effect was greater in some animals than others, in general we observed changes in coat appearance with niclosamide, 500199 and 500832 treated animals (Table 4 ).",

While the exact mechanism underlying niclosamide's therapeutic effect remains unclear, both studies appear to associate the anti-hyperglycemic effect with the ability of niclosamide and its salts to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. This finding is supported by the observations that sulfonate conjugated niclosamide (SCN), a derivative of NEN containing a sulfonate conjugate at the 2-hydroxyl site essential for mitochondrial uncoupling, failed to improve hyperglycemia in vivo. This finding led the authors to conclude that mitochondrial uncoupling is required for anti-hyperglycemic activity [3] . Unfortunately, the study did not address the effect of SCN on hepatic steatosis and it remains to be determined whether SCN or other niclosamide derivatives that do not uncouple oxidative phosphorylation or stimulate cellular respiration can improve hepatic steatosis through an independent pathway. Consistent with this idea, Mook et. al., recently showed that inhibition of Wnt/B-catenin signaling induced by niclosamide analogs can be separated from uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and alterations in cellular ATP [54] .",

Niclosamide and its salt forms uncouple mammalian mitochondria at high nanomolar concentrations and increase cellular OCR in cells without stimulating hyperthermia as with other mitochondrial uncouplers [3] . Mechanistically this may lead to increased energy expenditure and lipid oxidation as well as lower levels of cAMP that are required for PKA mediated hepatic glucagon signaling [3, 25] . Interestingly, differences in both energy expenditure and body weight were reported in response to niclosamide and its salts. Tao et. al., reported increased energy expenditure and reduction in body weight while Chowdhury et. al., observed no changes in body weight or energy expenditure but rather, attributed the anti-hyperglycemic effect to decreased hepatic glucose production as a result of the ability of niclosamide to block glucagon signaling in the liver.

This approach identified a number of novel compounds that attenuate hepatic steatosis both in vitro and in vivo in the low nanomolar range but that fail to increase oxygen consumption at concentrations up to 3\u03bcM. While we did not directly test uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria, increased oxygen consumption has been observed with niclosamide, NEN and NPP at sub-micromolar concentrations [3, 24, 25] . This finding suggests that it may be possible with SAR elucidation to separate the effect on hepatic steatosis from any potential mitochondrial uncoupling activity and related effects on glucose metabolism [3] . Changes in body weight were observed with administration of some of the phenylbenzamide derivatives, however additional experiments will be necessary to draw any conclusions regarding mitochondrial uncoupling and energy expenditure.",

Consequently, there is a need to identify novel derivatives with improved bioavailability to treat conditions that may require systemic exposure. Such compounds could provide new options to treat a diverse set of indications, including NAFLD, diabetes and metabolic disease, viral infection and a variety of cancers. Herein we report the bioavailability of several compounds has been improved by achieving a balance between the polar, hydrophilic carboxylic acid group and the non-polar, lipophilic tert-butyl group as exemplified in 500200 and 600453. The half-life of niclosamide is 6.7 hours [56] . Several of the phenylbenzamides reported in this study show both improved oral bioavailability and a half-life of greater than 4 hours suggesting they could be amenable to a once daily oral delivery. Furthermore, a number of the compounds reported herein have greater cLogP values and significantly improved cLogD values as compared to niclosamide. For instance, the introduction of more polar surface area with the methoxy group in 600657 gives a cLogD of -0.33. Niclosamide and NEN accumulate predominately in the liver. Further studies will be needed to explore how these differences affect the tissue distribution and plasma protein binding of the compounds reported in this study. Niclosamide also has a potentially toxic aromatic nitro group and in all of the newly reported compounds, the group has been replaced with a carboxylic acid moiety with retention of activity in our assays.",

Together these factors of improved pharmacokinetic properties and retention of important biological activity, in the absence of elevated respiration and low potential genotoxicity, suggest that compared to niclosamide, they may be better therapeutic candidates for the treatment of NAFLD and diabetes.",

We recently identified carbonic anhydrase 3 (CAIII) as one of three most influenced genes upregulated in mice in response to HFD and that niclosamide reversed CAIII upregulation [58] .

It is a highly-conserved serine threonine kinase that regulates cellular metabolism. The most characterized AMPK downstream target, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), is a rate-limiting enzyme in energy consumptive de novo fatty acid synthesis, and ACC is directly inhibited by AMPK phosphorylation to conserve cellular energy. Niclosamide and NEN have both been shown to activate AMPK in a dose and time-dependent manner resulting in an increase in ACC phosphorylation and inhibition of mitochondrial beta oxidation. Therefore, it is possible that by activating AMPK the compounds described herein could increase lipid oxidation through downstream phosphorylation and inhibition of ACC and mitochondrial beta oxidation.",

This may suggest that these compounds act primarily through uncoupling mitochondria leading to activation of the AMPK pathway and to increased lipid oxidation, similar to niclosamide and its salt forms. In contrast, we also identified several compounds that attenuated hepatic steatosis (500200, 600657, and 600489) in the absence of changes in the oxygen consumption rate and activation of the AMPK pathway in vitro. It may be possible that these compounds work through a, as yet undetermined but distinct mechanism.

In an effort to identify novel compounds with better preclinical properties that retain in vivo efficacy for the treatment of hepatic steatosis and NAFLD, we synthesized a series of novel N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide chemotype. This study describes a series of novel phenylbenzamide derivatives with improved physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo for the treatment of fatty liver and NAFLD. Furthermore, our data suggest that the compounds might be separated into two groups those that increased respiration and stimulated activation of the AMPK pathway and those that do not. Both groups were equally as effective in attenuating hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo suggesting the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is not required for the treatment of hepatic steatosis. In particular, we identified 600453 as a N-substituted phenylbenzamide that has good oral bioavailability and half-life, lacks genotoxicity, and does not stimulate respiration in cells. This suggest that this compound may be a good candidate for further clinical development for fatty liver disease.",
