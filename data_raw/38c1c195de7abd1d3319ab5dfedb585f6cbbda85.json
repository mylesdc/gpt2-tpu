The DAA enshrines a code of conduct between providers and users of data which protects the ownership of the data while making it freely available on the proviso that users acknowledge the source of the data and, as appropriate, engage with the originators of the data in the collaborative spirit of GISRS, in a manner consistent with its original intent. 37 Its effectiveness is demonstrated by the prompt release of genetic sequences from the first cases of H7N9 zoonotic infection in China in 2013, which enabled the rapid production by synthetic biology of a candidate vaccine virus within a few weeks, 38 and in ensuring availability of the latest data for the biannual WHO vaccine consultation meetings (VCMs). 39 The close alignment of the principles underlying GISAID's sharing mechanism with the seven key principles for data sharing in a public health emergency enunciated recently by the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) 40 illustrates once again how GISRS can lead the way in implementing innovative mechanisms and procedures. GISAID, also a trust-based system, integrates GSD with other clinical, virological and epidemiological data, and takes advantage of the latest advances in rapid gene sequencing technologies. It serves as a good example of sharing GSD in relation to public health emergencies and can perhaps serve as an example for other pathogens such as of Ebola and Zika viruses. 41 ",

The threat of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus causing zoonotic infections to develop into a pandemic akin to that of 1918-19 caught the imagination and galvanised a global response, one outcome of which was the PIP Framework, instituted to bolster fairness and transparency in the benefit of the \"global system.\" It is important, however, to recognise and be aware of the potential future impact of changes to a network which has been largely autonomous and self-financed by member states for 65 years, to include more formal arrangements for receiving additional financial support from PIP partnership contributions, amounting to half of the estimated running cost of GISRS, and involving WHO, on behalf of member states, directly in formal sharing of IVPP viruses. 21 Given the success of its 70-year-old Global Influenza Programme, the WHO has a crucial responsibility for ensuring that these additional resources are used to the best advantage, in a synergistic manner, to strengthen GISRS, under the umbrella of its GIP, to enable countries to meet their IHR responsibilities and promote benefit sharing initiatives, as well as for ensuring that GISRS' extensive complementary scientific expertise and collaborative ethos remain fully engaged to the benefit of global health security.",

GISRS' broad vision, under the watchful eye of the WHO GIP, should continue to provide leadership in its interaction with global partners and to implement technological advances to better understand factors influencing the adaptive potential and interspecies transmissibility of the viruses and the host response to human infection. It will be essential to retain the fundamental characteristics and collaborative ethos of GISRS as it evolves under the WHO Global Influenza Programme as the front-line defence against influenza in all its forms, and as a pre-eminent example of an integrated global system for combatting infectious disease.

Seventy years on it is as relevant today, with an estimated one billion cases of influenza annually, of which 3-5 million are severe, causing between 290 000 and 650 000 deaths, 3 and even more so given the constant pandemic threat from recent novel zoonotic influenza infections. While the principal objectives remain little changed, its modus operandi has adapted to the changing intellectual, technical and political environment. Following introduction of the first influenza vaccines in 1942 and an appreciation of a need for vaccine components to reflect changes in the circulating viruses, the establishment of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network in 1952 recognised the need to monitor changes in the viruses in relation to the impact of disease. Thus from the outset the global network encompassed surveillance of the epidemiology and impact of influenza, sharing of viruses isolated by WHO designated National Influenza Centres (NICs) with WHO Collaborating Centres on influenza (WHO CCs) for antigenic characterisation of the viruses and selection of suitable vaccine viruses, in relation to the manufacture, regulation and administration/distribution of influenza vaccines.",

For the first time, governments were faced with the concept of preparing a \"pre-pandemic\" H5N1 vaccine and stockpiling the vaccine and antivirals for use in the event that thevirus became more transmissible and caused an epidemic and possibly a pandemic. While this garnered a concerted effort among public health officials, regulators and vaccine manufacturers as well as among academic scientists towards the development of better vaccines and other antiviral therapies, it also led to much greater government scrutiny of the fairness of the global system, in particular by countries that did not use seasonal influenza vaccine and benefit tangibly from participation in and contribution to GISRS by sharing viruses. The ensuing intergovernmental negotiations culminated in the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP FW), 21 a formal agreement between Member States (MS) to promote and improve pandemic preparedness and response, whereby the sharing of \"H5N1 viruses and other influenza viruses with human pandemic potential\" (IVPP) would be matched by access of all countries, in particular developing countries, to vaccines, antivirals and other benefits in the event of a pandemic. A key element was the introduction of an Influenza Virus Tracking Mechanism (IVTM) to monitor sharing of IVPP and a requirement to sign a materials transfer agreement (a SMTA-2 defined in the PIP Framework 21 ) to receive PIP Biological Material from GISRS, altering the way in which viruses are openly shared within and beyond GISRS. In addition to in-kind contributions of vaccines, diagnostics and antivirals to be made available to WHO for deployment during a pandemic and other contributions also from academic laboratories, pharmaceutical companies make financial partnership contributions (PCs) to be used to support countries to participate in GISRS and help bolster the capacities of developing countries to build pandemic preparedness and response capabilities, thus further strengthening GISRS. While advantageous in terms of support for GISRS and pandemic preparedness, implementation of the PIP FW, overseen by the PIP Advisory Group, with administrative and legal support of the WHO PIP Secretariat, has introduced an important new element, specifically with respect to monitoring the sharing of PIP Biological Materials, into the longstanding successful organisation and operation of GISRS, coordinated by the GIP. It will therefore be important, as emphasised by the recent review of the PIP FW, 22 to ensure that its implementation is closely aligned and integrated with the activities and operational responsibilities of the GIP and GISRS, as envisaged in the PIP FW. 21 Any reorganisation within WHO or changes consequent to implementation of the Nagoya Protocol of the Convention of Biological Diversity 23 likely to impact GISRS should respect the national as well as international responsibilities of GISRS' components and maintain the fundamental structure and essential autonomy of GISRS, so as not to diminish the contribution of GISRS to global public health. GISRS provides an excellent example of an effective early warning system with timely reporting and sharing of urgent information as well as an efficient and effective model of cooperation with industry. This reflects the unique features of influenza, the combination of annual epidemics and zoonotic threats of severe pandemics, and raises the question as to how best to leverage these advantages more generally to benefit response to other emergent (virus) diseases, as demonstrated in the responses to the outbreaks of SARS 24,25 and MERS-CoV. 26,27 More in tune with seasonal influenza surveillance is the leveraging of GISRS for a pilot programme on RSV 28 to develop an evidence base for informing future vaccination policies at national and global levels. The recent expansion in the number and capacities of NICs over the past decade, with about 60% of countries participating in global influenza surveillance, has been due in part to pandemic threats from zoonotic infection (H5N1, H7N9, etc.) and the required notification under the International Health Regulations (IHR) of all human infections with novel influenza viruses, as well as the response to the 2009 pandemic. Bolstered by very active technical support in the provision of protocols and CDC diagnostic reagents for detection of seasonal and zoonotic (novel) infections, all regularly updated, and including training and associated performance evaluation, this momentum is likely to continue. Provision of guidance documents and analysis tools by GIP will continue to enhance the capabilities of laboratories to conduct epidemiological and virological surveillance and evaluate the burden of disease from influenza and how influenza might impact other diseases, essential to develop seasonal vaccination policies. 29,30 A 21% increase in countries with flu vaccine policies between 2006 and 2016, complemented by an 87% increase in global vaccine distribution between 2004 and 2013 bodes well for the future. On the other hand, sustainability is not guaranteed, especially if none of the perceived pandemic threats materialise and resources are judged to be better employed elsewhere. Maintenance of the \"basic\" seasonal surveillance capacity of the laboratory network by member states with NICs, independent of financial support from partnership contributions to the PIP FW or other external funding, will be essential and critical to sustain national capability to respond to seasonal epidemics and future pandemics. Surveillance of influenza as part of integrated disease surveillance is likely to become more prevalent as multiple parallel analysis systems become more cost-effective and the sensitivity of point-of-care tests improve. The timely response of GISRS to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was commended by the Review Committee on the functioning of IHR 2005 in relation to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009, 31 which acknowledged that it was \"the first time that a worldwide laboratory initiative was well-coordinated for an extended period of time,\" but it cautioned that \"the world is ill-prepared to respond to a severe influenza pandemic.\" More active participation in be prepared to react effectively and enact plans to assist, for example, in the distribution of vaccine and antivirals during a pandemic, possibly from stockpiles mobilised under the PIP FW. While the focus of the increased emphasis on influenza has been on the pandemic potential of zoonotic infection and pandemic influenza, it is the year-round surveillance of seasonal influenza by the NICs that provides the bedrock of the global system for surveillance and the ability to respond to a pandemic, as in 2009. The strong scientific base and expertise of many of the well-established NICs reflect to a large extent their national public health responsibilities, as part of the local healthcare system, which go beyond influenza and include more general emergency response capabilities. NIC core function reflects the interdependency of diagnosis, virological surveillance, novel virus characterisation and epidemiology, outbreak preparedness and investigation, as well as applied research on improved test methodologies and medical countermeasures. The increasing role of genetics and automation in health care systems is reflected in a move away from isolation of influenza viruses to increasing reliance by NICs on gene sequencing for virus characterisation, enabling tracking of virus transmission 33 and the detection and monitoring of antiviral resistance mutations. 14,34 The increasing and wider application of next-generation sequencing technology for whole-genome sequencing will further enhance understanding of the molecular genetics of virus infection and epidemiology, and enable response to outbreaks of disease.",
