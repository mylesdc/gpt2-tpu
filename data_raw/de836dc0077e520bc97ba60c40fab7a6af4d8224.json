Here we investigated the challenges faced by polypeptide segments of a non-vectorial \u03b2-barrel fold. Besides the biological interest behind the SARS coronavirus non-structural protein 1 (nsp1, 117 amino acids), this study model has two structural features that motivated its use in this work: 1-its recombinant production is dependent on the temperature, with greater solubility when expressed at low temperatures. This is an indication of the cotranslational guidance to the native protein conformation. 2-Conversely, nsp1 has a six-stranded, mixed parallel/antiparallel \u03b2-barrel with intricate long-range interactions, indicating it will need the full-length protein to fold properly. We used non-denaturing purification conditions that allowed the characterization of polypeptide chains of different lengths, mimicking the landscape of the cotranslational fold of a \u03b2barrel, and avoiding the major technical hindrances of working with the nascent polypeptide bound to the ribosome. Our results showed partially folded states formed as soon as the amino acids of the second \u03b2-strand were present (55 amino acids). These partially folded states are different based on the length of polypeptide chain. The native \u03b1-helix (amino acids 24-37) was identified as a transient structure (~20-30% propensity). We identified the presence of regular secondary structure after the fourth native \u03b2-strand is present (89 amino acids), in parallel to the collapse to a non-native 3D structure. Interestingly the polypeptide sequences of the native strands \u03b22, \u03b23 and \u03b24 have characteristics of \u03b1-helices. Our comprehensive analyses support the idea that incomplete polypeptide chains, such as the ones of nascent proteins much earlier than the end of the translation, adopt an abundance of specific transient folds, instead of disordered conformations.",

Early observations made it clear that some nascent chains of \u03b2-galactosidase still bound to the ribosome are enzymatically active [1] . More direct evidence that a polypeptide still attached to the ribosome, can adopt its native fold came from the use of conformational antibodies raised against \u03b2-galactosidase and tailspike protein of phage P22. [2, 3] Initial efforts to characterize the folding propensity of nascent polypeptide chains were performed with synthetic fragments of chymotrypsin inhibitor-2 from barley seeds, an alpha/beta protein with 64 amino acids that readily refolds by a two-state mechanism [4, 5] . As measured by circular dichroism and ANS binding, the acquisition of secondary and tertiary structure starts simultaneously after completion of 80% of the polypeptide chain. Native-like tertiary structure, measured by intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan, starts after the polypeptide chain is 95% complete. It is worth noting that even though the experimental conditions used in these studies were native-like, the purification process involved denaturing conditions, mainly because of the poor solubility of the polypeptides. Of special interest is the fact that the longest construct, with 63 residues, was recovered from bacterial inclusion bodies.",

The presence of chaperones is significant but not mandatory in the cellular milieu, and in fact is not sufficient to increase the in vitro folding recovery to the efficiency level of a polypeptide emerging from the ribosome. A well-studied example is the \u03b2-barrel of the green fluorescence protein (GFP), which becomes active after folding from a nascent polypeptide at a much higher efficiency than during in vitro refolding of its full-length polypeptide chain and independently of the cytosolic crowding or cellular chaperones [6] .",

We show that designed nascent polypeptide chains of the nsp1 adopt intermediates with hydrophobic clusters and significant 3D compaction. These intermediates appear with 2 of the 6 \u03b2-strands and the \u03b1-helix, represented by the designed protein nsp1 . Additionally, after the presence of 4 \u03b2-strands and the \u03b1helix, in the designed protein nsp1(13-100), there is the observation of significant formation of secondary structure.

These ingenious experimental setups have been developed since the 60\u00b4s and they have provided fascinating clues regarding the nature of protein synthesis.

This spacer provided a reasonably dynamic loop, according to our NMR data, which included narrow chemical shift dispersion (S2A Fig As depicted in Fig 1A, we designed the nsp1 constructs so as to avoid truncating their secondary-structure elements. Constructs included six intermediates and the full-length chain of The nonvectorial nature of the \u03b2-barrel fold in nsp1 is evident in these representations. For instance, the intermediate nsp1 includes \u03b2-strand 3, which is not paired with \u03b2-strand 2 in the native fold, nsp1(13-111) includes \u03b2-strand 5, which is not paired with \u03b2-strand 4, and finally the full-length nsp1 globular domain includes \u03b2-strand 6, which is not paired with \u03b2-strand 5. The constructs ranged in size from 11 to 22 kDa and included, from the N-to the C-terminus ( Fig 1B) : An nsp1 construct; a spacer, designed to occupy the ribosome exit tunnel before the synthesis of the GB1 domain; a GB1 solubility domain; and a Histag for purification.

The fusion construct containing the nsp1 domain as well as the six constructs containing incomplete polypeptide chains presented CD spectra distinct from the GB1 spectrum with an increase of negative ellipticity around 200-230 nm. An further increase in a negative band at 208 nm was noted especially for fusion constructs nsp1 (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) , nsp1 , nsp1(13-66) and nsp1(13-100), which is correlated with the presence of random coil conformation [30] . The full-length nsp1 fusion construct displayed a CD spectrum very similar to the nsp1(13-111) truncated fusion construct, which includes a positive band in the range of 200-205 nm, typical of \u03b2-strand conformation in the presence of coil. This characteristic appeared even earlier, in the fusion construct nsp1(13-84), but was somehow obliterated in fusion construct nsp1(13-100). Even though the signal of secondary structure is significantly bigger in the intermediate fusion construct nsp1(13-100) than in the shorter fusion constructs, it does not resemble the CD spectrum of full-length nsp1. This most likely reflects an intermediate state of folding distinct from the other fusion constructs.",

The substantial emergence of stable secondary structure in this construct is related to the large increase in the amount of native long-range contacts after the presence of strand \u03b24. The long-range contacts in the native structure of nsp1 are illustrated in the S3 Fig. The segment coding up to strand \u03b23, represented by construct nsp1(13-84) has 43 long-range contacts, considering the native full-length nsp1 fold. In contrast, the construct nsp1(13-100) has 47 additional long-range contacts compared to construct nsp1 . Furthermore, the native pairing among native strands \u03b23 and \u03b24 is maintained by 33 long-range contacts, which is more than three times the amount between \u03b21 and \u03b22 (9 contacts), \u03b22 and \u03b23 (7 contacts), or between each strand and the helix \u03b1 (1-11 contacts).",

The intermediate constructs have much lower dispersion than the well-folded, full-length domain, showing that the intermediates of nsp1 do not have a well-defined fold ( Fig 4A) . It is clear that the spectra of nsp1 (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) , nsp1(13-50) and nsp1(13-66) proteins do not overlap, indicating that these three fusion constructs have different conformations. Considering the longer fusion constructs, from nsp1(13-66) up to nsp1(13-111), there is considerable equivalence among the spectra; however, this can be merely a superposition of peaks from different amino acids and because of that cannot be considered fold similarity. Nevertheless, if we compare the median and the dispersion of signals of each fusion construct (Fig 4B) , we see that the medians of the spectra from fusion construct nsp1(13-66) towards the full-length construct are very similar, around 8 ppm. On the other hand, the median signals of the two shortest fusion constructs, nsp1(13-25) and nsp1 , are very similar to the urea-denatured samples nsp1(13-84), nsp1(13-111) and the full-length nsp1, all around 8.3-8.4 ppm. This indicates that the nsp1 polypeptides from nsp1(13-66) onward adopt different conformations than that of an unfolded structure. It is also noticeable that the dispersion of the fusion construct nsp1(13-111) is greater than the other intermediates, or urea-denatured samples, indicating that the nsp1 polypeptide segment of this sample adopted a more compact 3D fold.",

The greater the number of missing peaks in 2D spectra, the more likely it is that the protein adopts an intermediate fold with intermediate conformational dynamics. It is worth noting that there are several examples in the literature showing that for mostly unfolded and highly dynamic proteins their 2D [ 1 H, 15 N] correlation spectrum will present low dispersion but only a few missing peaks, because of superposition or intermediate dynamics of their 3D structures. This is in fact the case for the fusion construct nsp1 (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) , missing only 3% of its peaks. The number of missing peaks increases substantially to 44% with the length of the polypeptide chain from the fusion construct nsp1 to nsp1 , and then decreases until it reaches approximately 11% in the full-length nsp1 domain. This increased percentage of missing peaks is an indication for the existence of folding states with intermediate conformational dynamics. The full-length nsp1 fusion protein has only a few missing peaks, indicating a well-folded 3D domain, which causes a wide dispersion of chemical shifts and allows straightforward identification of backbone HN signals.",

            "text": "A classic approach to identifying 3D structures with intermediate folding uses the fluorescence of bis-ANS dye [31, 32] . A blue shift of the emission maximum and an increase of quantum yield of the bis-ANS fluorescence spectrum occur with decreasing dielectric constant of its surroundings, such as in the partition from aqueous solvent to protein hydrophobic microdomains. The binding of bis-ANS to proteins is dominated by hydrophobic interactions, and as such, its interaction with hydrophobic clusters and stable hydrophobic pockets, which are well-known indicators of intermediate folding structures, protein aggregation, or even specific active sites, such as nucleotide binding sites. As shown in Fig 5, there is an increase in the bis-ANS fluorescence from fusion constructs nsp1 to nsp1(13-111). Significant extrinsic fluorescence is also observed in the fulllength nsp1 sample, but only a residual signal is observed in the samples nsp1 (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) and nsp1 as well as the GB1 domain alone. The most likely cause for the binding of bis-ANS to these samples is the formation of hydrophobic clusters in partially collapsed states or in oligomers. The increase of bis-ANS binding does not correlate linearly with the accumulated hydrophobicity [33] in each construct (primary sequence shown in Fig 5B) , indicating that there are specific conformations forming hydrophobic clusters in the fusion constructs nsp1(13-66)-nsp1(13-111), which enable a very efficient binding of this hydrophobic dye. The fusion constructs present an average hydrophobicity of 0.51 \u00b1 0.03 (accumulated hydrophobicity divided by the number of residues in each construct \u00b1 SD), ruling out the possibility of the existence of abnormally hydrophobic polypeptide chains that would have more affinity for bis-ANS. It is also worth mentioning that the urea-denatured samples do not bind significantly to bis-ANS dye (data not shown).",

The GB1 domain alone behaved as a globular particle with R g of 2 nm and D max of about 6.8 nm (Fig 6) , behaving as a compact structure as suggested by the Kratky curve (S4 Fig). From the Kratky plots we found indications of flexible elongated polypeptide segments in all designed fusion constructs, characterized by an increase of I (q) \u00d7 q 2 plateauing at a given threshold. These data correlates with the other experimental observations presented here, which indicates the presence of a globular GB1 domain fused to distinct partially folded nsp1 polypeptide segments. The fusion construct nsp1 in particular has a consistent increase of the I (q) \u00d7 q 2 along the q values (S4 Fig), indicating a high content of disordered structure. For the full-length nsp1 fusion construct, a sinusoidal function in the Kratky plot is observed, indicative of a compact, globular structure with no major intrinsically disordered components, compatible with the expected structure of two globular domains (GB1 and nsp1).",

In these calculations we used the equations Calc-Rh FOLDED = (0.475 \u00d7 Number of residues 0.29 ) and Calc-Rh UNFOLDED = (0.221 \u00d7 Number of residues 0.57 ) for folded or unfolded proteins, respectively (blue and red lines in Fig 6B) .

A pronounced upper-deviation from the theoretical function is evident for the fusion construct nsp1 (13-84), most likely identifying the expansion of the mean occupied conformational space. The fusion constructs nsp1(13-100), nsp1(13-111) show a reduction in R g and D max compared to the theoretical and to the other fusion constructs, indicating protein condensation upon crossing a given threshold between chain length as of the completion of the segment nsp1(13-84)-nsp1(13-100).

To the best of our knowledge, this effect has not been previously detected in any intermediate of nascent polypeptide chains. Interestingly, the opposite propensity was shown for sperm-whale apomyoglobin, an all-\u03b1helical protein [42] . At relatively short lengths of the apomyoglobin, a predominantly nonnative \u03b2-sheet is present, but as chain length increases, \u03b1-helical conformation progressively takes over.",

As noted in the Fig 7D, the chemical shifts of nsp1(13-100) are quite distinct from those of the full-length globular domain, evidence that the conformations of these constructs are not alike. Nonetheless, it is noticeable that the loop connecting strand \u03b21 and helix \u03b1, as well as the polypeptide sequence surrounding helix 3 10 , have the highest \u0394\u03b4, suggesting that these are the regions that suffer the greatest conformational change, from nsp1(13-100) to full-length globular nsp1.

In polypeptide chains nearing completion (>95% of the final length), these authors identified compact structures with long-range interactions, perhaps non-native, but lacking stable secondary structures. It is worth mentioning that the purification of these truncated proteins involved chemical denaturation; we infer that the results were obtained with refolded samples, which is an additional variable in the experimental setup, not present in the natural cellular environment. Our experimental results indicate a different scenario, where intermediate polypeptide lengths of nsp1, represented by designed proteins nsp1(13-100) and nsp1 , start to adopt stable secondary structure and then tertiary structure before the completion of the polypeptide chain, observed for the designed protein nsp1(13-111) (Fig 8) .",

Subsequently, there is the formation of hydrophobic clusters in nsp1 with concomitant formation of residual non-native \u03b1helices, which reaches a maximum in nsp1(13-100). The fusion constructs nsp1(13-100) and nsp1(13-111) presents a visible condensation of 3D structure, as detected by SAXS, but only the latter has some stable tertiary structure. A hydrophobic collapse to the native 3D fold might happen only after completion of \u03b2-strand 6. The fusion constructs starting from nsp1 , which presents \u03b2-strands 1 and 2 and helix \u03b1, until nsp1 , resemble molten globules [52] . It is noticeable that the native amphipathic helix \u03b1 start to be formed within the fusion construct nsp1 and may provide a template to initiate the tertiary structure of nsp1. A second segment with helical propensity in fusion construct nsp1(13-100) does not show amphipathicity (last panel in Fig 9B) , which reinforces the argument that this segment is unstable in this conformation, leaving it with more propensity to form strand \u03b24 and the loops flanking it. Based on our experimental evidence and theoretical analysis, we suggest that nsp1 (13-100) represents a crucial step in the cotranslational folding of the \u03b2-barrel of nsp1.",

The native secondary structure topology is shown above the amino-acid sequence of nsp1, which is colored to distinguish each nsp1 segment used to design the incomplete nsp1 polypeptides. The number of additional long-range contacts between each secondary structure element and the rest of the polypeptide was calculated with MOLMOL on the basis of the native nsp1 3D structure.

SAXS data were collected using a two-dimensional detector (Pilatus 300k; Dectris, USA) at a wavelength of 1.548 \u00c5 with the sample-detector distance providing a q-range from 0.07 nm -1 to 2.5 nm -1 , where q is the modulus of the scattering vector (calculated according to q = (4\u03c0/\u03bb) sin\u03b8, where \u03bb is the wavelength and 2\u03b8 is the scattering angle). Three successive frames of 300 sec were collected per sample in order to rule out radiation-induced damage. Frames behaved similarly, and thus we assumed no detectable sample instability during measurements. All three frames were averaged. The data reduction routine was performed with Fit2D [55] , including normalization of the one-dimensional scattered data to the intensity of the transmitted incident beam; correction for detector response, incident beam intensity and sample absorption; and blank subtraction using scattering from buffer collected under the same experimental protocol. The R g and the scattered intensity extrapolated to zero q, I (q) , were inferred from the slope and the intercept of the linear fit of ln[I (q) ] versus q 2 in the q-range q\u00d7Rg < 1.3 [56] and also computed from the indirect Fourier transform program Gnom [57] .
