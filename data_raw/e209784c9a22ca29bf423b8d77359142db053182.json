In this study, we examined the effect of modulating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling during influenza virus infection. The activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by Wnt3a increased influenza virus mRNA and virus production in in vitro in mouse lung epithelial E10 cells and mRNA expresson of influenza virus genes in vivo in the lungs of mice infected with influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34. However, the inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling by iCRT14 reduced virus titer and viral gene expression in human lung epithelial A549 cells and viral replication in primary mouse alveolar epithelial cells infected with different influenza virus strains. Knockdown of \u03b2-catenin also reduced viral protein expression and virus production. iCRT14 acts at the early stage of virus replication. Treatment with iCRT14 inhibited the expression of the viral genes (vRNA, cRNA and mRNA) evaluated in this study. The intraperitoneal administration of iCRT14 reduced viral load, improved clinical signs, and partially protected mice from influenza virus infection.",

            "text": "Influenza virus is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. It has 8 genome segments that encode 10-12 different proteins [1] . Based on the antigenic differences in the nucleoprotein (NP) and M1 matrix proteins (MP), influenza viruses are classified as types A, B and C. For type A viruses, further subtyping is based on the antigenicity of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Sixteen HA (H1-H16) and 9 NA (N1-N9) subtypes have been recognized. The influenza virion contains negative-sense RNA (vRNA). The synthesis of influenza virus RNA occurs in three steps: (i) vRNA is transcribed into mRNA by a cap-snatching mechanism via RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; (ii) intermediate cRNA is synthesized from vRNA; and (iii) cRNA is copied to full-length negative-sense vRNA for encapsulation in new progeny virus particles [2, 3] . a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 genes coding for HA, MP and NP (Fig 1C) . When mice were pretreated with Wnt3a_CM and then infected with A/PR/8/34, increases in the mRNA levels of HA, MP and NP in the lungs were also observed ( Fig 1D) . These results indicate that Wnt3a treatment increased influenza virus replication. Morever, influenza virus infection of HEK293 cells with A/PR/8/34 or A/WSN/33 increased the activities of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling TOPflash reporter although A/WSN/33 were effective (Fig 1E) , suggesting that influenza virus activates Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling.",

Using the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling TOPflash reporter assay, we first validated that iCRT14 did inhibit the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling (Fig 2A) . Human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were then treated with 12.5 \u03bcM iCRT14 for 12 h and then infected with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 at a MOI of 1 for varying amounts of time. Infectious virus particles released into the medium were quantified using a TCID 50 assay. Virus titers in the iCRT14-treated cells were significantly reduced at 48 h post-infection (hpi) compared to the control cells ( Fig 2B) . Similar results were observed with A/WSN/33 virus (Fig 2C) . This effect was not due to the toxicity of iCRT14 because iCRT14 had no effect on cell viability (Fig 2D) . We also tested ability of iCRT14 to inhibit virus replication of various influenza virus strains by using an influenza virus sensor reporter assay. As expected, iCRT14 reduced the replication of A/PR/8/34 and A/WNS/33. In this assay, iCRT14 also inhibited the replication of clinical isolates of H1N1 pdm/Ok/2009 and H3N2 A/Wisconsin/67/05 ( Fig 2E) . These results indicate that iCRT14 has antiviral activity against multiple strains of influenza A virus.",

First, we examined the effects of iCRT14 on influenza virus A/PR/8/34-induced IFN gene expression. A/PR/8/34 induced the mRNA expression of IFN\u03b11 and IFN\u03b21 in A549 cells.

            "text": "Various host signaling pathways are altered during influenza virus infection; thus, these pathways might provide potential therapeutic targets. Cellular signaling pathways such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) signaling, the mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) pathway, Protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) signaling, and toll-like receptor/retinoic acid- inducible gene 1 (TLR/RIG-I) signaling cascades have been reported to play roles in various stages of the influenza virus replication cycle. NF-\u03baB signaling is essential for the host innate immune response and is activated by influenza virus infection [29] . Once activated, NF-\u03baB signaling increases influenza virus production by inducing proapoptotic factors [30] . Influenza virus also activates the MAPK pathway, and blocking this signaling pathway inhibits viral replication by impairing viral ribonucleoprotein trafficking [31] . Another pathway, the PI3K/Akt pathway, is activated by influenza virus via the interaction of non-structural 1 (NS1) protein and p85\u03b2 [32] . During influenza virus infection, robust activation of the IFN response occurs, and this in turn activates the PKR signaling pathway. However, influenza virus also counteracts activation of the PKR pathway by the binding of NS1 to double-stranded RNA, thereby preventing translational arrest [33] . Pattern recognition receptors such as TLRs and RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) recognize viral RNAs and induce antiviral immune responses [34] . Influenza virus has also evolved mechanisms to counteract this induction of the antiviral response. For example, NS1 inhibits RIG-I activation and IFN production by binding to tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25), an ubiquitin ligase that is required for RIG-I activation [35] .",

We showed that Wnt3a enhances viral gene expression in H1N1 There are limited studies on the effects of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling on influenza virus infection. A yeast two-hybrid screening reveals that viral proteins including NS1, PB1, PB2, NP and PA interact with Wnt signaling componments [10] . Using an RNAi approach, silencing of various components in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling affects A/PR/8/34 replication. However, the results of this study are difficult to interpret because deletion of these genes can have either a positive or a negative effect on A/PR/8/34 replication. However, deletion of FzD5, DAAM2 and CSNK1A1L reduced virus replication [10] , consistent with our inhibitor studies. Another study showed that addition of Wnt3a or overexpression of \u03b2-catenin and LEF1 inhibits H7N7 influenza virus replication [36] ; this contrasts with our observation that Wnt3a actually enhanced H1N1 viral replication and knockdown of \u03b2-catenin reduces H1N1 influenza virus replication. The discrepancy is likely due to differences in the strains used.",

            "text": "The mechanisms how Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling regulates influenza virus infection are unclear. There are several possibilities: (i) Modulation of immune response. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is known to modulate inflammatory and immune responses via the interaction with NF-\u03baB pathway [37] . However, the effect of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling on virusinduced immune responses remains controversial. For instance, Hillesheim et al has shown that activation of Wnt/ \u03b2-catenin signaling pathway by overexpressing \u03b2-catenin supports the IAV-induced IRF3-dependent transcription of genes of cellular innate immune response, such as the IFN-\u03b2 and ISGs [36] . However, a recent study has demonstrated that induction of Wnt ligands by negative-strand RNA virus infection suppresses the type I IFN response. Our current studies do not support a role of type I IFN response in this context as the inhibitory effect of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin inhibitor iCRT14 on influenza virus infection was not via the enhancement of IFN response (Fig 5) . (ii) Modulation of cell cycle and proliferation. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling promotes the G1/S transition through transcriptional upregulation of cell cycle related target genes such as c-Myc and cyclin D [38] . A proliferative status promoted by Wnt/ \u03b2-catenin signaling may: 1) provide abundant resource for virus cap snatching. This has been shown for another negative strand RNA virus, Rift Valley Fever Virus, which selectively snatches cell cycle-related cellular mRNAs [39] ; 2) allow the viral protein traffic between cytoplasm and nucleus more actively. For instance, Cawood et al has demonstrated that the nucleocapsid protein of Coronavirus is more mobile in proliferative cells and localizes to the nucleolus in a cell cycle-dependent manner [40] . We also showed that iCRT14 maintains its ability to inhibit influenza virus replication in IFN-deficient Vero cells and that it has no effect on the influenza virus-induced type I IFN gene expression in A549 cells. Different effects of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin on IFN response during virus infection have been reported. The Wnt ligands Wnt2b and Wnt9b negatively regulate the IFN response during Sendai virus infection [41] , and deletion of Wnt9b positively regulates the IFN response [10] . In contrast, Wnt3a increases the IFN response in the absence of NS1 protein, the main protein that influenza virus uses to repress the host IFN response [10] . Transfection of \u03b2-catenin and LEF-1 plasmids into A549 cells also induces the interferon-sensitive response element (ISRE) gene reporter when the cells are treated with cellular or viral RNA [42] .",

            "text": "In a xenograft model of BT-474 cells in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, iCRT14 treatment was shown to significantly reduce tumor volume [28] . Mouse Ewing's sarcoma in vivo was also inhibited by iCRT14 [43] . However, there is a paucity of literature on the toxicity of iCRT14 in animals. Our 10-day toxicity study in mice did not reveal any major toxicity to organs, including lung, liver, kidney, brain, heart and eyes. In a sublethal influenza infection mouse model, iCRT14-treated mice showed less severe clinical signs, and this correlated with the observation that those mice had lower virus loads at 5 days post infection. Virus load was less in the iCRT14-treated group at 2 days post infection, however it did not reach a significant level. Although we believe this is due to lower titer at day 2 and animal variations, we can not rule out the possibility that iCRT14 eexerts secondary effects in animals. Influenza virus infection causes acute lung injury, including damage to endothelial and epithelial cells, disruption of the endothelial alveolar barrier, leakage of proteins into the alveolar space, and inflammatory cell infiltration. However, iCRT14 appears to have no effects on parameters of lung injury and inflammation other than a reduction in lung edema. In a lethal influenza infection, we observed only slightly less weight loss and slightly delayed mortality in iCRT14-treated mice. These end points could be used to improve the efficacy of iCRT14 using medicinal chemistry and formulation. Because iCRT14 reduced virus loads and improved clinical signs, combination therapy [44] with other drugs that reduce lung injury should increase the efficacy of iCRT14.",

All experiments were carried out with the approval of the Oklahoma State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the Public Health Service (PHS) Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine. The abdominal cavity was opened, the animals were exsanguinated by interrupting the abdominal aorta, and the lungs were cannulated with a 20-gauge catheter via the trachea. The lungs were perfused with solution II (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% glucose, 5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgSO 4 , 1.7 mM CaCl 2 , 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 0.06 mg/ml penicillin G, 3 mM Na 2 HPO 4 and 3 mM NaH 2 PO 4 ), followed by instillation of 1 ml of solution I (15 ml solution II plus 10 ml dispase from a stock of 50 caseinolytic units/ml) through the trachea. Three lungs were isolated, pooled in a beaker containing approximately 10 ml of solution I and incubated at 37\u02daC for 45 min to release the AEC. After incubation, the lungs were chopped and further digested by the addition of DNase I (100 \u03bcg/ml) to solution I (10 ml) for 45 min at 37\u02daC with intermittent shaking. The digested lungs were filtered sequentially through 160-, 37-and 15-\u03bcm gauge nylon mesh. The filtrate was centrifuged at 250 g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM and incubated in a 100-mm-diameter Petri dish coated with mouse IgG (75 \u03bcg per dish) for 1 h. The cells were centrifuged at 250 g for 10 min and resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The yield was approximately 10 7 cells per 3 mice, and the cell viability was >95%.",

For host mRNA, 1 \u03bcg of RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using oligo(dT) and random primers. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a housekeeping gene control. The various types of viral RNAs were quantified as described [2] . One microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed using strand-and sense-specific primers for vRNA (5'-AGCGAAAGC AGG-3' and 5'-AGCAAAAGCAGG-3'), cRNA (5'-AGTAGAAACAAGG-3'), and mRNA (oligo(dT)). GAPDH-specific primer (5'-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3') was added to all reverse transcription reactions. The primers used in this study are listed in Table 2 . cDNA was diluted to 1:200 in nuclease-free water. Real-time PCR was carried out in a 20-\u03bcl reaction mixture containing specific primers and SYBR Green DNA dye (AnaSpec, Fremont, CA, USA). PCR was performed on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) at cycling conditions of 95\u02daC for 2 min and 40 cycles of 95\u02daC for 15 s and 60\u02daC for 60 s. Viral RNA levels, expressed as threshold cycle (C T ) values, were normalized to GAPDH levels using the \u0394CT method. ",

Eight-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used in this study. Animal housing and environmental conditions met all applicable standards. The animals were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). The mice were infected intranasally with 1,000 plaque forming unit (pfu) (for a lethal challenge) or with 100 pfu (for a sublethal challenge) of influenza A virus (A/PR/8/34) in 50 \u03bcl volume. The mice received intraperitoneal injections of iCRT14 (50 mg/kg body weight) or of DMSO (4.2%) [46] as a vehicle control in a volume of 800 \u03bcl one day prior to virus infection and then daily from day 2 to day 5, as indicated. The mice were monitored for clinical signs such as arching back, huddling and ruffled fur. Body weight loss was monitored daily; animal health and behavior were frequently observed by animal caretaker; mice that lost more than 30% of their original body weights were euthanized by injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) followed by cervical dislocation. For sublethal studies, clinical signs were scored as previously described [47] : normal = 0, ruffled fur = 1, inactive = 3, hunched back and moribund = 4. Mice were euthanized at day 2 or day 5 after infection. The left lungs of the animals were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Thermo Scientific, West Palm Beach, FL, USA); the right lungs were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for RNA, protein and virus titer determination. For determination of virus titer in lung tissue, the right cranial lung lobes of infected mice were homogenized in 10% (w/v) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and used in TCID 50 assays. In a separate experiment, the right lungs of the animals were used for collection of broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL), and the left lungs were used to determine the wet-to-dry ratio. The right lungs were lavaged twice with 500 \u03bcl ice-cold PBS; approximately 80% of the applied volume was recovered. The BAL cells were centrifuged, resuspended and cytospin to slides. The slides were stained with Dip Quick stain (Jorvet, Loveland, CO, USA). Differential cell counts were performed using ! 400 cells per sample. The BAL fluid was frozen until use.",
