            "text": "Every year, there are about 20 Mio hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections and 60,000 deaths that are associated with HEV worldwide. At the present, there exists no specific therapy for HEV. The natural compound silvestrol has a potent antiviral effect against the (\u2212)-strand RNA-virus Ebola virus, and also against the (+)-strand RNA viruses Corona-, Picorna-, and Zika virus. The inhibitory effect on virus spread is due to an inhibition of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A, which is required to unwind structured 5 -untranslated regions (UTRs). This leads to an impaired translation of viral RNA. The HEV (+)-strand RNA genome contains a 5 -capped, short 5 -UTR. This study aims to analyze the impact of silvestrol on the HEV life cycle. Persistently infected A549 cells were instrumental. This study identifies silvestrol as a potent inhibitor of the release of HEV infectious viral particles. This goes along with a strongly reduced HEV capsid protein translation, retention of viral RNA inside the cytoplasm, and without major cytotoxic effects. Interestingly, in parallel silvestrol affects the activity of the antiviral major vault protein (MVP) by translocation from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear membrane. These data further characterize the complex antiviral activity of silvestrol and show silvestrol's broad spectrum of function, since HEV is a virus without complex secondary structures in its genome, but it is still affected.",

            "text": "HEV is classified as a (+)-strand ssRNA virus and a member of the Hepeviridae family. Four major human-pathogenic genotypes have been identified, with genotype 1 and 2 being restricted to humans, whereas genotype 3 and 4 are able to infect both human and swine. All genotypes contain a~7.4 kb genome [11] , which is composed of three open reading frames (ORF): ORF1 encodes a non-structural polyprotein (pORF1), which is mainly responsible for efficient virus replication, ORF2 encodes the capsid-forming core protein (pORF2), and ORF3 is the coding region for a protein of unknown function (pORF3) [12] . HEV pORF1 is the only polyprotein that is found in the virus' proteome, which is composed of four different subdomains: a methyltransferase domain, a papain-like cysteine protease domain, an RNA helicase domain, and an RNA dependent RNA polymerase domain, as indicated by homology analyses [13] . There is evidence that this polyprotein is further processed and cleaved into smaller proteins by a cysteine protease, with each fragment showing the proposed catalytic activities [14] . The viral RNA genome further contains a 5 -capped, short 5 -UTR (~26 base pairs) [15] . This indicates a dependency on cap-recognizing proteins and a possible regulation that is based on the untranslated region, since the genome itself serves as a template for protein biosynthesis. Moreover, 3 -poly adenylation is found in the virus' genome. Additional studies on the HEV genome showed that not only the full genome itself serves as the sole template for viral protein synthesis, but also a bicistronic, subgenomic RNA coding for pORF2, and pORF3 [16, 17] . HEV egress, after capsid assembly, is then managed via the exosomal pathway [18], with pORF3 being an important interaction partner of tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) [19] , possibly tethering the capsid to the endosomal sorting complexes that are required for transport (ESCRT) that mediate the entry into the multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Therefore, viral particles are found as quasi-enveloped particles (surrounded by an exosomal membrane) in both cell culture supernatant and patient serum, while being excreted (via feces) as naked capsid viral particles [18, 20, 21] . Just recently, a form of pORF2 has been described to be secreted as homodimers, in addition to the population found in assembled capsids [22] .",

            "text": "Silvestrol, which is a cyclopenta[b]benzofuran, is a natural compound that is extracted from the plant species Aglaia foveolata [23]. This compound is a potent and selective inhibitor of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A), an RNA helicase that is required to unwind RNA secondary structures in the 5 -UTRs of mRNAs, thus creating a binding platform for the 43S preinitiation complex. As such, it was first described as a growth-inhibiting agent in human breast and prostate xenograft models by inhibiting translation initiation from 5 -m7GTP capped mRNAs with extended and structured 5 -UTRs, as often found in proto-oncogenes, while being well tolerated by the mice used in the experiments [24] . Furthermore, silvestrol prolongs the survival rate of mice with hepatocellular cancer, and therefore is discussed as a potential, novel anticancer drug [25] , although it has not been used in human clinical trials so far. Just recently, a study has been published showing a potent antiviral effect of silvestrol in cells that are infected with the Ebola virus [26], a (\u2212)-strand ssRNA virus that transcribes from its genomic RNA 5 capped mRNAs with relatively long and structured 5 -UTRs, which seemed to be causative for the compound's effect. Other examples for RNA viruses being affected by silvestrol were identified as Coronavirus (CoV), human rhinovirus (HRV) A1, Zika virus (ZIKV), and poliovirus type 1 (PV) [27, 28] . Therefore, silvestrol appeared as an interesting agent to be tested on a (+)-strand ssRNA virus containing only a short 5 -UTR, such as HEV.",

Especially in recent years, since more case studies and controls have been conducted, it has been observed that HEV is also widespread in European countries [3] and in the Americas [4, 5] . Since this topic has become more aware, it became obvious that HEV is not only a virus that is considered to be water-borne, but also food-borne [6] . Livestock, for example, domestic pigs, can be infected with zoonotic genotypes, making them possible conductors and transmitters for HEV infections. In the past decade, over 21,000 new infections were registered in Europe, showing a 10-fold increase in the number of cases. Not only meat-consuming customers in Western countries are at risk of HEV To gain insights into the effects of silvestrol on the HEV life cycle, a persistently HEV-infected A549 cell line was used. This specific cell line is infected with an HEV isolate from a chronically infected patient, the HEV genotype 3 strain 47832c, and shows a long-lasting HEV gene-expression and viral particle production, which is optimal for experimental usage [36] .",

Besides that, it has to be asked whether the activity of antiviral mechanisms are affected by silvestrol. To address this, A549/D3 and persistently HEV-infected A549 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of silvestrol. An intermediate concentration of silvestrol (10 nM, treatment lasting for 24 h), where no effect on HEV was present has been chosen. It was hypothesized that this could be due to the decreased antiviral activity that is caused by silvestrol treatment. Cytosolic proteins were extracted and an in-solution protein digestion with subsequent LC/MS (using UDMS E [43] ) analysis was performed to identify antiviral host-factors being inhibited by silvestrol.

An intermediate concentration of silvestrol (10 nM, treatment lasting for 24 h), where no effect on HEV was present has been chosen. It was hypothesized that this could be due to the decreased antiviral activity that is caused by silvestrol treatment. Cytosolic proteins were extracted and an in-solution protein digestion with subsequent LC/MS (using UDMS E [43] ) analysis was performed to identify antiviral host-factors being inhibited by silvestrol. Table 1 shows that the major vault protein (MVP) was unambiguously identified in all of the samples and was proven to be strongly regulated, when HEV-positive (H) and negative cells (D3), and treated (+) and untreated cells (\u2212) were compared.

Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy, using an MVP-specific antibody, of HEV-positive and HEV-negative cells that were or were not subjected to silvestrol treatment solves this seeming contradiction. The immunofluorescence confirms the increase in the amount of MVP in persistently HEV-infected A549 cells as compared to the HEV-negative control cells. The immunofluorescence microscopy further demonstrates that in HEV-positive, silvestrol-treated cells MVP change the subcellular localization. In the case of the untreated cells, a cytoplasmic localization is observed; in case of the silvestrol-treated cells, MVP displays a perinuclear, dot-like staining ( Figure 8E ). This reflects that the decreased MVP concentration that was observed in the mass spectrometry analysis of the cytosolic fraction is primarily due to the translocation from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear membrane and to a minor part due to the decreased total amount. In addition, subcellular fractionation experiments of cells that are treated with 2 nM, 10 nM, and 50 nM for 24 h were performed. Nuclear lysates and cytoplasm were analyzed by Western Blotting using an MVP-specific antibody ( Figure 8G ). The quantification of the Western Blots ( Figure 8H ) shows that the amount of MVP in the cytoplasm is significantly decreased, while it is significantly increased in the nuclear lysate at 10 nM. In accordance to the observed withdrawal of MVP from the cytoplasm, resulting in the loss of its antiviral activity for cells that are treated with 10 nM silvestrol, the quantification of the immunofluorescence staining with the core-specific antiserum ( Figure 8E ,F) shows no significant reduction in the number of HEV positive cells for 10 nM silvestrol, which stands in contrast to the significant reduction that was observed for 2 nM and 50 nM treated cells ( Figure 5B,C) . This was also confirmed by Western Blot analysis of cellular lysates derived from cells treated with 10 nM silvestrol for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h using a core specific antiserum. In contrast to the observed reduction in the amount of intracellular HEV capsid protein observed for cells treated with 2 nM and 50 nM silvestrol ( Figure 4B ,C), this was not observed for cells that were treated with 10 nM silvestrol ( Figure 8I,J) .",

This is reflected by a strong decrease in the number of released infectious viral particles and by the immunofluorescence microscopy showing less HEV-positive cells (reflecting the impaired spread of HEV, due to the reduced number of infectious particles), while these HEV-positive cells show a strongly reduced capsid protein-specific signal (reflecting the impact on translation of viral proteins). A recent study highlighted that there are three forms of the HEV capsid protein that are present in infected cells, being part of different stages of the viru's life cycle [49] . We observe an overall decrease of signals in Western Blot analyses leading to comparable reductions of these forms, respectively. Since HEV genomic replication is not significantly inhibited by silvestrol over the course of up to 72 h, it is further highlighted that the compound mainly triggers structural protein biosynthesis, thereby hindering capsid formation and viral particle release, rather than inhibiting the synthesis of viral genomes for its progeny.",

On the one hand, there is a direct effect of silvestrol on the translation of viral proteins, as reflected by the decrease in the amount of capsid protein. On the other hand, it should be considered that silvestrol, as an inhibitor of eIF4A, also affects the translation and activity of a variety of host-factors. These factors could include RNases and proteasomal, lysosomal, or autophagosomal proteins. If such activities, triggering the degradation of viral genomes or viral proteins, are impaired, a stabilization of i.e., viral genomes is the consequence, which could compensate for the inhibitory effects of silvestrol on other parts of the viral life cycle.",

            "text": "In this context, host-factors may play a crucial role normally acting inhibitory on HEV themselves under natural conditions. MVP was identified as a host-factor, which is strongly upregulated in HEV-positive cells. It was described recently that Hepatitis C virus, Vesicular stomatitis virus, and Influenza A virus induce MVP expression. In turn, MVP affects viral replication by e.g., triggering the expression of type-I IFNs [35] . These previous studies show that MVP is an important protein in regulating and propagating the innate immune-response on a cellular level and highlight MVP's function of being part of a virus-inducible host-defense mechanism. By an intermediate concentration of silvestrol (10 nM), the amount of MVP in HEV-positive cells is moderately, but significantly, decreased. However, the subcellular localization is strongly affected by silvestrol, leading to a strong decrease of the MVP levels in the cytosol, as evidenced by mass spectrometry. This is due to a translocation of MVP from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear region, as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. To set the observations that were made in LC/MS and immunofluorescence in a broader context, we prepared nuclear lysates and cytoplasms from cells treated with 2 nM, 10 nM, and 50 nM silvestrol, and analyzed these fractions by Western Blot, while using an MVP-specific antibody. DMSO treated cells served as a control. These experiments confirm the mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence results that were obtained for 10 nM, as these data show that there is a significant decrease of MVP in the cytoplasm and a significant increase of MVP in the nuclear and perinuclear fraction at 10 nM, as compared to the DMSO control. For 2 nM and 50 nM silvestrol, there is no significant change, as compared to the DMSO control. This translocation prevents that MVP fulfils its cytosolic signal transduction on e.g., the induction of type I interferons, which has been described as part of its antiviral response to HCV [35, 50] or ZIKV [28] . This illustrates that the observed effects of silvestrol on the HEV life cycle reflect overlapping effects with different kinetics of silvestrol on HEV and on host cell-factors, which depends on the concentration of silvestrol and the duration of silvestrol treatment.",

As our study is limited on a genotype 3i HEV strain and on the HEV genotype 3 p6Kernow strain, it may be useful to check for other genotypes being affected by silvestrol, as well as elucidating, whether or not MVP behaves in a similar manner.

When considering this complex interplay between silvestrol's action on HEV and host-factors, it can be stated that silvestrol exerts a strong antiviral effect on HEV, as reflected by the robust reduction of the amount of released viral particles. As HEV is a virus with a short 5 -UTR without complex secondary RNA structures, these data provide evidence for a broader spectrum of silvestrol's antiviral usage. ",
