In human VHF cases, extensive analyses of the humoral immune responses in survivors and non-survivors have shown that the IgG responses to nucleoprotein (NP) and other viral proteins are associated with asymptomatic and survival outcomes, and that the neutralizing antibody responses targeting ebolaviruses glycoprotein (GP 1,2 ) are the major indicator of protective immunity. On the other hand, the immune responses in non-human primates, especially naturally infected ones, have not yet been elucidated in detail, and the significance of the antibody responses against NP and GP 1,2 in RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed the humoral immune responses of cynomolgus macaque by using serum specimens obtained from the RESTV epizootic in 1996 in the Philippines to expand our knowledge on the immune responses in naturally RESTV-infected non-human primates. Results: The antibody responses were analyzed using IgG-ELISA, an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA), and a pseudotyped VSV-based neutralizing (NT) assay. Antigen-capture (Ag)-ELISA was also performed to detect viral antigens in the serum specimens. We found that the anti-GP 1,2 responses, but not the anti-NP responses, closely were correlated with the neutralization responses, as well as the clearance of viremia in the sera of the RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques. Additionally, by analyzing the cytokine/chemokine concentrations of these serum specimens, we found high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, such as IFN\u03b3, IL8, IL-12, and MIP1\u03b1, in the convalescent phase sera.",

The genus Ebolavirus currently has five members: Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Reston virus (RESTV), Sudan virus (SUDV), and Ta\u00ef Forest virus [1] . Filoviruses induce lethal viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) in both humans and nonhuman primates, while RESTV infection in humans is probably subclinical, yet it also causes highly lethal VHF in macaques [2, 3] . RESTV epizootics among cynomolgus macaques emerged in 1989, 1990, 1992, and 1996 . In all of these epizootics, the cynomolgus macaques originated in a single primate breeding facility in the Philippines [4] . Although the natural reservoir of RESTV remains unknown, RESTV was isolated from pigs in the Philippines, in addition to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type-2 in 2008 [5] . Considering the social impact of ebolaviruses, it is important to understand the endemic and epizootic status of RESTV in the Philippines.",

In the present study, in order to gain insight into the IgG responses during the recovery from infection with RESTV, anti-NP, anti-GP 1,2 , and neutralizing antibodies and the level of viremia in the serum specimens were analyzed. The data presented herein showed that the anti-GP 1,2 response, rather than the anti-NP response, was correlated with both the lack in viremia and the neutralizing activities in the sera of RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques. There may be at least two possibilities for the lack of anti-GP 1,2 IgG in the acute phase samples. It is known that soluble GP (sGP), which does not contain membrane anchor, is secreted during ebolaviruses infection, and it can absorb the anti-GP 1,2 antibodies [23] . The other possibility is that apoptosis of lymphocytes is induced during RESTV infection and the resulting host immune responses may thus be abrogated. Although the precise mechanism of action is still unknown, it is likely that no IgG responses to RESTV GP 1,2 are induced in the cynomolgus macaques during the acute phase of infection.",

We found that three specimens that have anti-GP antibodies were obtained from dead monkeys (#2180, 2181 and 2194), however, it is difficult to conclude whether RESTV infection caused their death because of the possibility of succumbing to infection by SHFV or some other agents. It is predicted that, among the serum samples examined here, nine were acute phase samples because they were positive in Ag-ELISA or immunohistochemistry [3, 15] (Table 1) . On the other hand, all but one (serum #2194) of the anti-GP 1,2positive serum samples were Ag negative.

In addition, a balanced proinflammatory response is believed to be a critical factor for determining the disease outcome [25, 26] . We focused on the circulating inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques and examined their relationship with convalescence. We thus found the concentrations of several proinflammatory cytokines/ chemokines, such as IFN\u03b3, IL8, IL-12, and MIP1\u03b1, to be significantly higher in convalescent sera than in nonconvalescent sera. Gupta et al. (2012) recently demonstrated that convalescent serum samples obtained from BDBVinfected human cases include high concentrations of IL-1\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL6, TNF\u03b1, and MCP-1 [13] . Although the exact profiles of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines shown in our study are different from those reported by Gupta et al., these differences are considered most likely to be due to differences among ebolaviruses (RESTV vs. BDBV), host species (cynomolgus macaques vs. humans), and differences related to the disease phase when the samples were obtained. It is possible that the upregulation of the proinflammatory innate immune responses contributed to the recovery from RESTV infection in cynomolgus macaques. In rhesus monkeys experimentally infected with a lethal dose of EBOV, anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-13 and IL-1ra, are highly elevated in the acute phase [11] . In human Ebola VHF patients, increased concentrations of IL-10 and IL-1ra have been shown in fatal cases, thus suggesting that the mixed anti-inflammatory response syndrome (MARS) contributes to the pathogenesis of the hemorrhagic fever caused by ebolaviruses. Since all of the cynomolgus macaques involved in the epizootic were euthanized at the affected facility, the actual fate of the cynomolgus macaques was not clear, and some might have survived the infection. Our data obtained using the sera from cynomolgus macaques in the RESTV epizootic showed higher IL-1ra responses in the convalescent phase than in the non-convalescent phase (Figure 1 ). There were no significant differences in the concentration of IL-10 between the two groups (data not shown). This suggests that, unlike other ebolaviruses infections, RESTV does not induce MARS, which is characterized by an elevated induction of IL1ra in the acute phase.",

In addition, a high concentration of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines was observed in the convalescent phase. Therefore, the anti-GP 1,2 response and the upregulation of the specific proinflammatory response might be useful indicators of convalescence from RESTV infection in cynomolgus macaques.",

The serum specimens in the affected facility were collected under quarantine of the Philippines. Nineteen of the 27 samples were previously subjected to an antigen capture ELISA. Nine of the samples were found to be RESTV antigen-positive, and the remaining 10 were considered to be antigen-negative [15] . The serum specimens were treated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and virus in the cynomolgus macaque serum samples were inactivated. As negative controls for the IgG-ELISA and IFA, we used serum samples from 102 cynomolgus macaques collected at the Tsukuba Primate Research Center (TPRC) in Japan. As positive controls for the IgG-ELISA and IFA, two rabbits were immunized four times with the histidine-tagged ectodomain of the RESTV glycoprotein (GP 1,2 ) (RESTV GP 1,2 \u0394TM). The histidine-tagged RESTV GP 1,2 \u0394TM of a 1996 RESTV [28] was prepared and purified as described below. The sera were collected from the rabbits, inactivated, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. The experiments with animals were performed in accordance with the Animal Experimentation Guidelines of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the institute (Permit number: 990163 and 109075).",

Seventeen of the 27 samples (#2408, 2615, 2669, 2739, 2921, 2728, 2180, 2181, 2189, 2190, 2191, 2195, 2404, 2693, 2696, 2713 and 2194) were positive for anti-NP IgG in IgG ELISA, while these samples all reacted in IFA. On the other hand, two samples (#2644 and 2719) were only positive in IFA. We considered the samples as anti-NP IgG-positive when either ELISA or IFA showed positive reaction. As a result, a total of 19 samples had anti-NP IgG. Cynomolgus macaques with anti-NP IgG consisted of NP antigen-positive (#2408,",
