            "text": "Manganese (Mn) is essential for normal physiologic functioning; therefore, deficiencies and excess intake of manganese can result in disease. In humans, prolonged exposure to manganese causes neurotoxicity characterized by Parkinson-like symptoms. Mn 2+ has been shown to mediate DNA damage possibly through the generation of reactive oxygen species. In a recent publication, we showed that Mn induced oxidative DNA damage and caused lesions in thymines. This study further investigates the mechanisms by which cells process Mn 2+ -mediated DNA damage using the yeast S. cerevisiae. The strains most sensitive to Mn 2+ were those defective in base excision repair, glutathione synthesis, and superoxide dismutase mutants. Mn 2+ caused a dose-dependent increase in the accumulation of mutations using the CAN1 and lys2-10A mutator assays. The spectrum of CAN1 mutants indicates that exposure to Mn results in accumulation of base substitutions and frameshift mutations. The sensitivity of cells to Mn 2+ as well as its mutagenic effect was reduced by N-acetylcysteine, glutathione, and Mg 2+ . These data suggest that Mn 2+ causes oxidative DNA damage that requires base excision repair for processing and that Mn interferes with polymerase fidelity. The status of base excision repair may provide a biomarker for the sensitivity of individuals to manganese.",

Manganism is characterized by neurological symptoms resembling the dystonic movement associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) [11] [12] [13] and therefore is a risk factor for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). Although Mn has been studied for years, the mechanism by which it causes neuronal damage is not well understood. Studies suggest that neurotoxicity is not caused by a single factor but that it appears to be regulated by a number of factors including apoptosis, oxidative injury, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

In most cases, the mean of at least three experiments is plotted together with the standard deviation. Differences between mean values and multiple groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance was set at < 0.05. 2+ . To perform a comparative analysis of the differential sensitivity of yeast strains, we first determined the dose of Mn 2+ appropriate for the study. We initially used the wild type strain to determine the range of Mn 2+ concentrations and found that there was a linear response in a narrow window between 1 and 2.5 mM ( Figure 1 ), with the higher concentration resulting in viability below 5%, which did not significantly increase at higher concentrations of Mn 2+ . All selected strains were then exposed to this range of Mn 2+ concentrations. Figure 1 shows a comparison between the wild type strain, the disaggregase hsp104 mutant, which displays higher tolerance to Mn 2+ , and the base excision repair ntg1 mutant, which is more sensitive. Mn 2+ at 1.5 mM was determined to be the optimal concentration for the strain comparison ( Figure 1 ). At this concentration, wild-type cells displayed approximately 40% survival and sensitive strains showed higher sensitivity relative to the wild-type strain ( Figure 1 ). Based on published evidence and a recent report by Stephenson et al. [18] , we selected several mutant strains that play a role in the mutagenicity avoidance and may be involved in processing Mn 2+ -induced DNA damage (Table 1) . These mutants strains include those defective in nucleotide excision repair (rad2), postreplication repair (rad18, rad27a, and ubc13), base excision repair (apn1, rad27, and ntg1), homologous recombination (rad52), DNA mismatch repair (mlh1), and DNA damage bypass (rad30), glutathione synthesis (gsh1 and gsh2), oxidative stress (sod1, sod2, and cta1), and protein disaggregation (hsp104). Quantitative analysis involved exposing the cells to Mn 2+ as described under Materials and Methods and spotting serial dilutions onto nonselective media YPD for colony counting. As observed in Figure 2 (a), no significant difference was observed on the growth rate of each strain in the absence of Mn 2+ (control panel), except for slow growing strain ntg1. However, upon treatment with Mn 2+ , the strains displayed differential sensitivity to the metal. All strains tested were sensitive to Mn 2+ however, only the hsp104 mutant displayed less sensitivity than the wild type (48% versus 37%; Figure 2 (b), black bar). No significant difference between rad2 (33.2% survival) and the wild type was observed, suggesting that Mn 2+ -induced DNA damage does not result in bulky adducts that require NER for processing. Similarly, no significant difference between rad52 (31% survival) and the wild type indicates that no significant DNA damage is processed to DNA double-strand breaks that require homologous recombination for repair. Interestingly, the oxidative stress mutants sod1, sod2, and cta1, (15%, 21%, and 17% survival, resp.) were approximately 2-fold more sensitive than wild type and the glutathione synthesis mutants gsh1 and gsh2 (10.6% and 13.6% survival, resp.) were 3-fold more sensitive. Mismatch repair mutants mlh1 displayed 14.5% survival, suggesting that Mn 2+ induces an increased load of mismatches that cannot be repaired. More striking was the sensitivity of the base excision repair mutants apn1, rad27, and ntg1, (9.5%, 9.2%, and 4.9% survival), which were over 4-fold more sensitive to Mn 2+ than wild type (Figure 2 (b)), with ntg1 being the most sensitive (7.5fold). In addition, ubc13 and rad30 mutants were also highly sensitive (\u223c4-fold higher than wild type), further suggesting the generation of Mn 2+ -induced DNA damage.",

The concentration of Mn 2+ was increased to 2 mM to effectively determine the protective effects of the antioxidants on wild-type cells, resulting in 20% survival. Cotreatment of wild-type cells with 2 mM Mn 2+ and 20 mM NAC increased the survival to 42%, a 2-fold increase (Figure 3) .

To test the protective effect of NAC and GSH on a sensitive strain, we selected ubc13, which displayed 9% survival when treated with 1.5 mM Mn 2+ . Cotreatment with 20 mM NAC and 1.5 mM Mn 2+ increased its survival to 28.5%, a 3-fold increase. Cotreatment with 1.5 mM Mn 2+ and 10 mM GSH resulted in 74% survival, an 8.4-fold increase (Figure 3 ).

As shown in Figure 4 , the mutation rate increased 12-fold (from 1.9 \u00d7 10 \u22127 to 23.1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ) when wildtype cells were treated with 1.5 mM Mn 2+ . Based on the ability of antioxidants to reduce the toxicity of Mn 2+ (Figure 3 ), we tested if cotreatment with NAC or GSH could also reduce the Mn 2+ -induced increase of the mutation rate. In fact, 20 mM NAC reduced the mutation rate by 1.5-fold (from 23.1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 to 15.5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ), while 10 mM GSH reduced the mutation rate by 2-fold (from 23.1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 to 11.8 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ), consistent with the ability of these antioxidants to reduce Mn-induced toxicity ( Figure 3 ).",

For this purpose, we amplified the CAN1 gene from canavanine-resistant colonies treated with 1.5 mM Mn 2+ and completely sequenced the ORF to identify the mutation. Table 2 shows the spectrum of mutations of 20 independent canavanine-resistant colonies. A single mutation was identified in each isolate. Mutations are indicated first by the original base, its numerical sequence position, followed by the mutant base. The majority (70%) of the mutations were base-substitution mutations with 40% (8/20) being transitions and 30% transversions (6/20). The rest (30%) were frameshift mutations, of which 10% (2/20) were insertions and 20% (4/20) were deletions of single nucleotides at the position indicated. No complex mutations such as large deletions, insertions, duplications, or gross chromosomal rearrangements were found. No hotspot was found, although some base-substitution mutations were observed twice (G1196A, G1555A and A1417T; Table 2 ). Survival was determined relative to untreated strain (100% survival). Wild-type strain was treated with 2 mM Mn 2+ , with or without cotreatment with GSH and NAC, as described in Section 2. At least 5 independent colonies were tested. Average survival plus standard deviation is shown. displacing Mg 2+ in the DNA synthesis reaction, we tested if exogenously added Mg 2+ could both increase the survival of the strain as well as reduce its mutator phenotype. As shown in Figure 5(b) , cotreatment of the strain with 1.5 mM Mn 2+ and 10 mM Mg 2+ significantly increased the survival to 100% (figure) and reduced the mutation rate by 2-fold ( Figure 5(c) ). Figure 4 : Effect of Mn 2+ on the mutation rate of the CAN1 forward mutation assay. The CAN1 assay detects any mutation which inactivates the CAN1 gene (arginine permease) and allows cells to grow on plates containing the toxic arginine analog, canavanine. The assay was performed using the wild-type strain in the presence of 1.5 mM Mn 2+ or cotreated with 1.5 mM Mn 2+ and 10 mM GSH or 1.5 mM Mn 2+ and 10 mM NAC as indicated. Appearance of colonies on canavanine containing plates is scored and mutation rates are determined as described in Section 2. and standard deviation is included at the top of each bar.",

We selected mutant strains in key components of the major DNA repair pathways, as described in Table 2 . Initial observation indicates that yeast cells are relatively tolerant to Mn 2+ , displaying reduced viability only when concentrations reach over 1 mM (Figure 2) , which is several orders of magnitude higher than for other metals, such as Cd 2+ , which is toxic at the M level [31] . Interestingly, the sensitivity of yeast cells to Mn 2+ is almost complete when the concentration of Mn 2+ reaches 2.5 mM (Figure 2 ) displaying a linear response within this concentration window. For this reason, the strain comparison was performed at the 1.5 mM concentration. All strains displayed varying degrees of sensitivity, and all except the hsp104 strain, were more sensitive than the wild type, suggesting that no significant toxic levels of protein aggregation are induced by Mn 2+ .",

            "text": "Cells possess three major excision repair pathways: (i) base excision repair (BER) which is responsible for the repair of damaged bases resulting primarily from oxidative damage [34] , (ii) nucleotide excision repair (NER) which plays a major role in the repair of large DNA adducts and UV damaged DNA [35, 36] , and (iii) DNA mismatch repair (MMR), a postreplicative mechanism, improves the fidelity of DNA replication by removing misincorporated bases by the DNA polymerase [37] . In addition, cells possess recombination repair, which in yeast is primarily performed by homologous recombination (HR) [38] . These pathways act in concert to respond to exogenous damage and guarantee genome stability. Some of these pathways have been shown to be defective in neurodegenerative diseases [39, 40] and participate in response to neurotoxic agents [41, 42] . Our data suggests that BER plays a major role in the cellular response to toxic levels of Mn 2+ as mutants apn1, rad27, and ntg1 were more than 4-fold sensitive to Mn 2+ than wild type (Figure 2(b) ) and ntg1 was the most sensitive (7.5-fold). NTG1 is a DNA N-glycosylase which removes the oxidized damaged base on both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA [43] . The DNA damage generated by Mn 2+ appears to interfere with DNA replication, as indicated by the high sensitivity of strains ubc13, a DNA-damage-inducible gene, member of the errorfree postreplication repair pathway [44] , and rad30 mutants, which are defective in translesion synthesis DNA polymerase eta, required for bypass synthesis at sites where replication forks are stalled due to damaged bases. Conversely, NER does not appear to play a major role in the repair of Mn 2+ -induced DNA damage, as indicated by similar survival of rad2 mutant to the wild type. Similarly, the lack of a strong Mn 2+ -induced phenotype in the rad52 strain suggests that no significant DNA damage is processed to DNA double-strand breaks, which requires homologous recombination for repair.",

            "text": "A significant increase in the accumulation of mutations was observed in cells exposed to Mn 2+ , using two distinct mutator assays. The CAN1 forward mutation assay indicated a 12-fold increase in the mutation rate when cells were exposed to 1.5 mM Mn 2+ . Similar to the effect on survival, NAC and GSH reduced the increase in the mutation rate, suggesting that the mutations are at least the result of oxidative damage to DNA. Analysis of the mutations in the CAN1 gene in these yeast cells indicates that most base substitutions are accumulated (70%), while 30% were frameshifts mutations. In combination with the increased mutation rate, cells exposed to Mn 2+ have a significantly higher accumulation of frame shift mutations. This is distinct from spontaneous mutations (not exposed to Mn 2+ ), where 10% of the mutants analyzed had complex mutations [29, 45] . The increase in frameshift mutations was also observed when the mutation rate was measured using the lys2-10A allele. This increase was dosedependent and ameliorated by Mg 2+ , concomitant with an increase in cell survival. In fact, Mg 2+ has been shown to protect cells from Mn 2+ toxicity [46] [47] [48] . It is possible that the mutation rate increase is the result of Mn 2+ intoxication of the DNA polymerase by displacing Mg 2+ [21] , which would require MMR for repair, explaining the increased sensitivity of the mlh1 strain.",

However, recently, a series of studies have shown that some viral polymerases, such as those of coronavirus [49] and poliovirus [50] , have exclusive requirement for Mn +2 in their synthetic activity. Similarly, the incorporation of nonnucleoside triphosphate analogs is accomplished by X family DNA polymerases in an Mn-dependent manner [51] , while cellular error-prone DNA polymerase iota, isolated from tumor cells, was shown to utilize Mn 2+ [52] in DNA synthesis. This is an interesting observation because DNA polymerase iota is inducible by Mn 2+ and could in part contribute to the mutagenesis observed in Mn 2+ exposed cells.",

Considering the well-known relationship between DNA repair defects and neurodegenerative diseases, and the involvement of DNA repair in response to neurotoxic agents, the status of base excision repair, or some of its key components, may prove to be useful as biomarkers to determine the susceptibility to toxic damage from excess exposure to Mn 2+ . There is currently a lack of well-validated biomarkers for manganese exposure. Manganese overexposure leads to cognitive, motor, behavioral effects in children [56] and manganese is associated with Parkinson's disease in adults [11] [12] [13] . Persons most likely to be exposed to excessive levels of manganese are manganese coal miners and welders. However, there is currently no way to determine who will suffer severe effects after Mn overexposure. Thus, preventive strategies and biomarker development for BER status are strongly supported by our findings. An assay that monitors the BER status of exposed individuals could be used in conjunction with other recently proposed biomarkers for Mn exposure which measure delta-amino levulinic acid levels [57] and the Mn/Fe ratio [58] . While these two biomarkers can detect exposure to Mn, an assay evaluating BER status would be of more value as a preventative strategy with its inherent potential to distinguish individuals who would be more severely affected by Mn exposure from those who would not.",

We observed a dosedependent increase in the mutation rate of this strain with increasing concentrations of Mn 2+(Figure 5(a)).
