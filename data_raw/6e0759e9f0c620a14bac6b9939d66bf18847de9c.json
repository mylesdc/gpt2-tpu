            "text": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract, with virtually all cases of cervical cancer being attributable to infection by oncogenic HPVs. However, the exact mechanism and receptors used by HPV to infect epithelial cells are controversial. The current entry model suggests that HPV initially attaches to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) at the cell surface, followed by conformational changes, cleavage by furin convertase, and subsequent transfer of the virus to an as-yet-unidentified high-affinity receptor. In line with this model, we established an in vitro infection system using the HSPGdeficient cell line pgsD677 together with HPV16 pseudovirions (HPV16-PsVs). While pgsD677 cells were nonpermissive for untreated HPV16-PsVs, furin cleavage of the particles led to a substantial increase in infection. Biochemical pulldown assays followed by mass spectrometry analysis showed that furin-precleaved HPV16-PsVs specifically interacted with surface-expressed vimentin on pgsD677 cells. We further demonstrated that both furin-precleaved and uncleaved HPV16-PsVs colocalized with surface-expressed vimentin on pgsD677, HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS cells, while binding of incoming viral particles to soluble vimentin protein before infection led to a substantial decrease in viral uptake. Interestingly, decreasing cell surface vimentin by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown in HeLa and NIKS cells significantly increased HPV16-PsV infectious internalization, while overexpression of vimentin had the opposite effect. The identification of vimentin as an HPV restriction factor enhances our understanding of the initial steps of HPV-host interaction and may lay the basis for the design of novel antiviral drugs preventing HPV internalization into epithelial cells. IMPORTANCE Despite HPV being a highly prevalent sexually transmitted virus causing significant disease burden worldwide, particularly cancer of the cervix, cell surface events preceding oncogenic HPV internalization are poorly understood. We herein describe the identification of surface-expressed vimentin as a novel molecule not previously implicated in the infectious internalization of HPV16. Contrary to our expectations, vimentin was found to act not as a receptor but rather as a restriction factor dampening the initial steps of HPV16 infection. These results importantly contribute to our current understanding of the molecular events during the infectious internalization of HPV16 and open a new direction in the development of alternative drugs to prevent HPV infection.

            "text": "H igh-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) belong to the seven groups of viruses known to date which have been recognized to be consistently associated with various types of human cancer (1) . HPV type 16 (HPV16), the most common oncogenic genotype, is an obligatory intracellular virus which has been extensively studied with regard to its entry mechanisms. While multiple possible receptors have been described, the exact infectious uptake of HPV16 into epithelial cells remains controversial (2, 3) . The current 2-step entry model highlights the crucial role of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) as the initial attachment receptor situated within the plasma membrane or the extracellular matrix via engagement of the HPV major capsid protein L1 (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . In addition, laminin 332 secreted onto the extracellular matrix by keratinocytes has been proposed as a high-affinity initial attachment molecule (11) . Binding to HSPGs induces conformational changes in the icosahedral capsid that facilitate proteolytic cleavage of L1 by the secreted serine protease kallikrein 8 (KLK8) (12) . Subsequent interactions of the viral particle with the host cell chaperone cyclophilin B lead to the exposure of the N-terminal portion of the minor capsid protein L2 which contains a conserved consensus cleavage site for the host-encoded extracellular proprotein convertase furin (13) . Cleavage of L2 by furin was found to be an indispensable step for HPV infection (14, 15) . Although it is now accepted that furin cleavage of L2 plays a critical role for endosomal escape at later stages during the infection process rather than being a prerequisite at the early stages of binding and entry, it nevertheless leads to exposure of a cell surface receptor binding site on L1 (16, 17) . This, together with the described changes in virion conformation, is postulated to reduce their affinity for HSPGs, thereby facilitating their transfer to and engagement with a secondary non-HSPG entry receptor(s), culminating in virions that are primed for infectious internalization (9, 18, 19) . Interestingly, furin-precleaved viral particles were found to bind directly to the secondary receptor(s), thereby bypassing the necessity of HSPG interaction (20) . Several secondary, predominantly L1-specific receptors have been proposed that may mediate infectious uptake, such as \u24236 integrin (21) , epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR) (22) , and tetraspanins (23) . Moreover, with the identification of the annexin A2 heterotetramer (AIIt), a multifunctional protein involved in diverse cellular processes (24) , an L2-specific receptor has been suggested (25) to regulate entry and intracellular trafficking of the virus (26) . However, the precise cellular components mediating HPV uptake into permissive cells remain unknown.",

Despite contradicting observations due to different experimental systems used to study virus entry, it is assumed that the endocytic uptake of HPV is dependent on actin dynamics but is clathrin, caveolin, cholesterol, and dynamin independent, implying a noncanonical internalization pathway related to macropinocytosis (27, 28) . After internalization, the virus traffics through the endosomal system, interacting with sorting nexin 17 in the endosome (29, 30) as well as with retromer components (31) and \u2425-secretase in the trans-Golgi network (32, 33) . In order to initiate infection, the viral genome complexed with L2 needs to escape from the endosomal compartment into the cytoplasm and travel to the nucleus via dynein-mediated transport along microtubules (34, 35) . Effective translocation from the endosomes into the cytosol is dependent upon prior furin cleavage of L2 at the cell surface (14, 36, 37) , demonstrating again the critical role of furin cleavage in HPV entry.",

Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein and the major IF of mesenchymal cells and cells adapted to tissue culture as well as transformed cell lines (38) . Unlike microfilaments and microtubules, IFs are a chemically heterogeneous group of structural proteins (39) . Besides its traditionally assigned functions in maintaining the mechanical and structural properties of cells, vimentin also acts as a key organizer in the context of intracellular dynamics and architecture, such as cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell signaling (40) . Interestingly, several viruses exploit vimentin during different phases of their life cycle, ranging from viral entry to replication, virus assembly, and egress (39) . As one of the major components of the cytoskeleton, vimentin is primarily located in the cytoplasm, especially around the plasma membrane. However, vimentin has also been found to be expressed on the cell surface and in the extracellular space in several cell types (40) . While the biological functions of surface-expressed vimentin still remain to be elucidated, an increasing number of reports suggest a conserved role for cell surface vimentin as a component of the attachment and uptake complex of several viruses (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) . Also, bacteria interact with surface vimentin to mediate cellular attachment (49) , for example, Escherichia coli and group A streptococci (50, 51) , while Mycobacterium tuberculosisinfected monocytes are recognized by natural killer cells through surface-expressed vimentin (52) .",

In an attempt to biochemically pull down cell surface molecules that interact with and potentially mediate uptake of the virus, we established an experimental system that bypasses the initial extracellular attachment steps necessary for conformational changes that ultimately lead to furin cleavage of L2 and viral uptake. We generated furin-precleaved HPV16 pseudovirions which expectedly contain some (although not all [17] ) L2 proteins with proteolytically processed N termini (Fig. 1A) . Importantly, no copurifications were visible by SDS-PAGE with silver staining, thereby minimizing the possibility of furin targeting other proteins besides the virus capsids (Fig. 1A) .",

Moreover, infection of CHO-K1 wild-type cells also resulted in a more robust (approximately 30-fold) increase of infection in the presence of FPC particles, while neutralization with the HPV16neutralizing antibody H16.V5 (but not with the HPV18-neutralizing antibody H18.J4) abolished infectious uptake independently of furin pretreatment as expected (53) in both cell types (Fig. 1C) . These experiments not only demonstrated the impact of furin treatment on HPV16-PsV infectivity but also confirmed the suitability of pgsD677 cells together with FPC HPV16-PsVs as an HSPG-independent infection system (17) .",

When analyzed by flow cytometry, binding of Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester (AF488)-labeled HPV16-PsVs to pgsD677 cells for 1 h at 4\u00b0C was found to be almost completely removed by treatment with trypsin-EDTA but not with lidocaine hydrochloride-EDTA (Fig. 1D) . However, internalization of the particles was well detected when cells were subsequently shifted to 37\u00b0C for 30 min and treated with trypsin-EDTA, almost reaching the levels seen when cells were only allowed to bind for 1 h at 4\u00b0C and lifted with lidocaine hydrochloride-EDTA (Fig. 1D) . These results were also confirmed with all other cell lines used in this study (data not shown) and demonstrated the suitability of trypsin digestion for removal of surface-bound HPV16-PsVs, allowing the quantification of their internalization. Interestingly, furin pretreat-ment of the viral particles not only substantially affected infectivity of pgsD677 cells (Fig. 1C ) but also increased FPC HPV16-PsV internalization as measured by flow cytometry using AF488-labeled virions (Fig. 1E) . These data confirmed that FPC HPV16-PsVs can bypass the requirement for HSPG engagement during infectious uptake, thereby permitting direct binding to the still elusive secondary receptor (17) . was assessed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent silver staining.

(B) Negative EM staining of furin-treated and untreated HPV16-PsVs. (C) HSPG-deficient pgsD677 cells and their corresponding wild-type CHO-K1 cells were infected with furin-treated or untreated HPV16-PsVs. In control experiments, the virions were preincubated with either of the neutralizing antibodies H16.V5 and H18.J4. Luciferase activity of the cell lysates was measured 48 h postinfection and normalized against total protein concentration and is presented as x-fold change relative to control infection of CHO-K1 cells with untreated HPV16-PsVs, which was set as 1.

Cells were lifted with trypsin-EDTA (Trn) to remove surface-bound virions. In control experiments, cells were either not shifted to 37\u00b0C to avoid internalization or lifted with lidocaine hydrochloride-EDTA (Lcn), which does not remove surface-bound particles. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and results were quantified by quadrant analysis of the dot plot of three independent experiments and are presented as percent change relative to the mean fluorescence intensity of cells lifted with Trn, which was set as 100%. (E) Internalization of furin-pretreated or untreated AF488-conjugated HPV16-PsVs by pgsD677 cells as determined by flow cytometry as described for panel D.

            "text": "We therefore performed immunoprecipitation (IP) assays of live pgsD677 cells incubated with FPC HPV16-PsVs using the HPV16-L1-specific antibody CamVir1 ( Fig. 2A) . Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining of the gel, allowing visual comparison to appropriate controls (Fig. 2B ). Candidate protein bands were excised, processed for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) analysis, and identified using the Matrix Science Database (MSDB) and searching the NCBI database. Among the molecules identified, vimentin received the highest protein significance score, 139, and was considered an attractive candidate involved in HPV recognition and binding due to its involvement in the attachment and uptake of several other viruses and bacteria when expressed at the cell surface (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (50) (51) (52) . In order to validate the involvement of pgsD677 cell surface vimentin in FPC HPV16-PsV binding, Western blots based on the immunoprecipitation experiment shown in Fig. 2B were performed. Interestingly, when probing with antibodies raised against different vimentin epitopes (i.e., H84 versus V9), we found that the presence of the viral particles led to a slight reduction in the size of the precipitated vimentin protein (Fig. 2C ). No such protein was precipitated in the absence of FPC HPV16-PsVs. Unspecific binding of the vimentin V9 antibody to the HPV16-L1 protein (both being of similar size) was excluded in appropriate control experiments (data not shown). As it is possible that the observed different vimentin fragments were artifacts caused by proteolysis during cell isolation (54, 55) , we performed pulldown of the viral particles in a cell-free context in the presence or absence of immobilized recombinant human vimentin protein (Fig. 2D ). The purity of the vimentin protein was confirmed by silver staining following SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2E ), thereby excluding virus binding to other molecules besides vimentin. These experiments confirmed that HPV16-PsVs directly interacted with vimentin. Interestingly, this interaction was found to be independent of furin pretreatment of the viral particles. Surface vimentin colocalizes with HPV16-PsVs and affects viral uptake by pgsD677 cells. To determine if vimentin could act as a surface molecule involved in HPV uptake, we initially characterized vimentin expression in pgsD677 cells and studied binding of AF488-labeled HPV16-PsVs (both furin treated and untreated) by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The expression pattern of surface vimentin agrees with the literature, as only a small percentage of cells presented detectable vimentin at the surface (Fig. 3A) , which appeared polarized (punctate) at the cell membrane (44, 56) , with a striking localization of vimentin to filopodia near the substrate (Fig. 3E , column 1). Due to the lack of HSPGs on pgsD677 cells, total binding of the viral particles to the cells was relatively low (Fig. 3C) ; however, individual cells expressing vimentin at the surface showed impressively high binding of the viral particles, with the majority displaying colocalization with vimentin ( Fig. 3E , rows b and c). Generally, increased binding to pgsD677 cells was observed for FPC HPV16-PsVs compared to uncleaved particles ( Fig. 3C and E, rows b and c), although levels of colocalization with vimentin were comparable: 85.3% (\u03ee20.3%) of FPC HPV16-PsVs and 78.7% (\u03ee35.1%) of uncleaved particles, respectively, colocalized with surface-expressed vimentin (Table 1) . Interestingly, vimentin surface levels slightly increased over time upon infection with the viral particles; however, furin-precleaved and untreated particles had a comparable effects (Fig. 3B ). Although initial (30 min) internalization of FPC HPV16-PsVs was increased compared to untreated particles (Fig. 1E ), the two virus preparations were internalized to similar extents over a time course of 24 h (Fig. 3D ).",

We therefore altered vimentin expression in HeLa and NIKS cells by either small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown or overexpression. Interestingly, reduced vimentin expression upon knockdown by vimentin-specific siRNA ( Fig. 5A and B) led to an increase in HPV16-PsV binding and internalization which was independent of prior furin treatment (Fig. 5C  and D) . Likewise, infection as measured by luciferase activity was significantly increased when vimentin expression was reduced, which was more pronounced when the particles were not pretreated with furin ( Fig. 5C and D) . Consistent with the observed increase in viral internalization upon vimentin knockdown, increasing the amount of surface vimentin by transient overexpression (Fig. 6A) significantly decreased HPV16-PsV binding and uptake independently of prior furin treatment ( Fig. 6B and C) . This was also accompanied by significant decreases in luciferase activity in both cell systems ( Fig.  6B and C).",

In the case of HPV, it has been assumed that the virions are unable to bind to their entry receptor until they have Role of Vimentin in HPV16 Infection Journal of Virology undergone an HSPG-dependent conformational change and subsequent furin cleavage (8) . While HSPGs are expressed at the cell surface and are used by HPV as cellular attachment molecules in vitro, it is assumed that the conformational changes of the HPV capsid required for infection occur HSPG dependently on the basement membrane in vivo prior to the transit of the virions to the host cell surface (7) . In order to bypass the need for these extracellular steps, we set up an experimental infection system using the HSPG-deficient cell line pgsD677 together with furin-precleaved HPV16 pseudovirions (FPC HPV16-PsVs). This model allowed us to biochemically pull down cellular surface molecules that the FPC particles directly interacted with, potentially including the still-elusive non-HSPG secondary entry receptor (20) . One of the most promising candidate molecules that was precipitated together with FPC HPV16-PsVs was identified as vimentin, which, in addition to its function as a cytoskeletal filament protein, plays important roles in entry of, infection with, and/or replication of several viruses h and exposed to furin-pretreated or untreated AF488-conjugated HPV16-PsVs. Quadrant analysis of the dot plots of three independent experiments performed in triplicate is presented as x-fold change relative to the mean fluorescence intensity of cells transfected with control (scrambled) siRNA and infected with either furin-treated or untreated particles, as appropriate, which was set as 1 for all conditions. For quantification of infection, the cells were transfected with 100 nM vimentin siRNA for 72 h and infected with furin-pretreated or untreated HPV16-PsVs. Forty-eight hours postinfection, luciferase activity was measured and was normalized against total protein concentration and is presented as x-fold change relative to cells transfected with control (scrambled) siRNA and infected with either furin-treated or untreated particles, as appropriate, which was set as 1. Significance was calculated by means of the two-tailed Student t test, and a P value of \u05450.05 (*) was regarded as statistically significant. Quantification of viral binding and internalization was performed by flow cytometry of HeLa (B) and NIKS (C) cells transfected with 1 g of pCMV3-vim for 14 h and exposed to furin-pretreated or untreated AF488-conjugated HPV16-PsVs.

Although vimentin is primarily expressed intracellularly, we and others observed surface expression on a subpopulation of cultured cells displaying a particular punctuate expression pattern (40) . Importantly, several viral pathogens, including picornaviruses, mammalian porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), enterovirus 71, Theiler's virus, and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) , use vimentin as a component of their cellular attachment and/or receptor machinery (41-46, 48, 60) . The physical interaction between FPC HPV16-PsVs and vimentin initially observed by immunoprecipitation was confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy as colocalization of the viral particles with surface-expressed vimentin on pgsD677 cells and on selected epithelial cell culture models, namely, HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS, the last being particularly physiologically relevant for HPV infection, as NIKS cells retain celltype-specific growth requirements and differentiation properties. Contrary to our expectation, however, the presence of vimentin was not found to aid in viral internalization but rather functioned as an inhibitory molecule. Both preincubation of the viral particles with soluble recombinant vimentin protein and overexpression of vimentin on the cell surface led to a substantial decrease in viral uptake and infection. In contrast, diminishing surface-expressed vimentin by siRNA knockdown significantly increased infectious internalization of the particles.",

            "text": "The functional significance of vimentin during natural HPV infection still needs to be elucidated, as cell culture systems do not fully represent the series of changes the virus undergoes in vivo after binding to the basement membrane prior to keratinocyte infection. We hypothesize that cell surface vimentin binding to viral particles plays a role in modulating the HPV entry process, possibly by interfering with the binding of the viral particle with the (still unknown) viral binding and uptake molecules. Although novel in the context of HPV infection, extracellular vimentin has been shown to be involved in the response to pathogens through interactions with incoming bacteria and soluble factors, thereby contributing to bacterial killing (54) . Similar to the dual role of lectins in virus biology-lectins can be membrane associated or soluble and are known to be involved in either immune defense through neutralization and clearance of viral infection or can be exploited as entry molecules to facilitate viral spread (61)-vimentin may also exert dual effects on viral infection. While surface-expressed vimentin plays a role in the attachment and uptake machinery of several viruses as mentioned above (41-46, 48, 60) , it appears to interfere with crucial steps in the HPV16 pseudovirus infection process at the level of binding and internalization into epithelial cells, possibly by either masking portions of the virus that interact with its receptor or by causing steric hindrance, thereby destabilizing or preventing receptor-virus interaction necessary for successful infection. Interestingly, vimentin is known to be associated with several integrins, such as \u24236 integrin (62), which has been proposed as a potential HPV receptor (21) and whose function in HPV uptake might be influenced by the presence of vimentin.",

It is possible that some of the entry steps, including the role of vimentin, differ among HPV serotypes (2, 63) . The participation of different receptors and/or modulating molecules can therefore account for differences in pathogenic profiles and differences in cell tropism. It is also interesting that HPV16 pseudovirus binding to recombinant vimentin protein as well as internalization by epithelial cells was little influenced by pretreatment of the viral particles with furin. While furin cleavage of L2 is indispensable for successful infection, as demonstrated on HSPGdeficient pgsD677 cells, the fact that untreated particles still enter the cells confirms the current notion that furin cleavage is important for endosomal escape rather than at the early stages of the infectious entry (14, 15) . We therefore propose that the interaction between HPV16-PsVs and vimentin is independent of furin cleavage. Moreover, as the observed binding and internalization behavior of HPV16-PsVs did not greatly differ between the HSPG-expressing cell lines used in this study, we hypothesize that surface vimentin may act as a general viral restriction factor rather than a cell-type-specific one.",

Clearly, there is a need to identify other modalities and alternative cost-effective means for preventing and/or treating HPV infection. With the identification of vimentin as a viral restriction factor preventing HPV16-PsV infection, approaches in drug design based on molecule structure which can eventually be incorporated into microbicides or lubricants to prevent HPV infection are conceivable (65) . , 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 g/ml of streptomycin).

For cell surface labeling and colocalization experiments, 5.5 pg of AF488-labeled FPC HPV16-PsVs per cell was added and allowed to bind to cells for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, then rinsed with cold culture medium, and incubated with a goat antivimentin polyclonal antibody (Sigma; V4630; dilution of 1:100 in culture medium) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Cells were then rinsed with cold PBS and fixed with 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, washed 3 times for 5 min with PBS, and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS (blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature before being stained with a Cy3conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.; 1:1,000 in blocking solution) for 90 min at room temperature. Cells were then counterstained with Hoechst (Sigma; 1:2,000 in PBS), washed in PBS, and mounted on glass slides with Mowiol. Slides were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 880 Airyscan confocal microscope. Colocalization analysis was performed using Zen 2012 imaging software for each optical section in z-stacks of individual cells. Colocalized pixels derived from analysis of the three-dimensional (3D) data sets were then superimposed on maximum-intensity projections of cells for display. Quantification of colocalization was performed on approximately 50 cells (derived from 2 independent experiments) for each experimental condition tested, using the built-in colocalization function in the ZEN 2012 software. Colocalization coefficients for the fluorescence channels representing Cy3-labeled vimentin and AF488-labeled FPC HPV16-PsVs, respectively, as well as overlap coefficients were determined according to the method of Manders et al.
