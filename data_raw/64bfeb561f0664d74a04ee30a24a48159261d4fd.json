It is a threshold parameter, intended to quantify the spread of disease by estimating the average number of secondary infections in a wholly susceptible population, giving an indication of the invasion strength of an epidemic: if R 0 < 1, the disease dies out, whereas if R 0 > 1, the disease persists. R 0 has been widely used as a measure of disease strength to estimate the effectiveness of control measures and to form the backbone of disease-management policy. However, in almost every aspect that matters, R 0 is flawed. Diseases can persist with R 0 < 1, while diseases with R 0 > 1 can die out. We show that the same model of malaria gives many different values of R 0 , depending on the method used, with the sole common property that they have a threshold at 1. We also survey estimated values of R 0 for a variety of diseases, and examine some of the alternatives that have been proposed. If R 0 is to be used, it must be accompanied by caveats about the method of calculation, underlying model assumptions and evidence that it is actually a threshold. Otherwise, the concept is meaningless.",

Few epidemics are ever observed at the moment an infected individual enters a susceptible population, so calculating the value of R 0 for a specific disease relies on secondary methods. There are many methods to calculate R 0 from mathematical models, few of which agree with each other and few of which produce the average number of secondary infections. Methods to calculate R 0 from theoretical models include the survival function, the next-generation method, the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix, the existence of the endemic equilibrium, and the constant term of the characteristic polynomial. R 0 can also be estimated from epidemiological data via the number of susceptibles at endemic equilibrium, the average age at infection, the final size equation and calculation from the intrinsic growth rate.

R 0 is also used as a measure of eradication for a disease that is endemic, but issues such as backward bifurcations, stochastic effects, and networks of spatial spread mean that an invasion threshold does not necessarily coincide with a persistence threshold. This results in a reduction of the usefulness of R 0 . For example, it is possible that a disease can persist in a population when already present but would not be strong enough to invade. Finally, the threshold value that is usually calculated is rarely the average number of secondary infections, diluting the usefulness of this concept even further.",

The survival function has the advantage that it always produces the average number of secondary individuals infected by a single infected individual, in the same class. Thus, in Figure 1 , where one human infects two mosquitoes, who each infect three humans, the survival function produces R 0 = 6. This is the number of humans infected by a single infected human via mosquitoes; or, equivalently, the number of mosquitoes infected by a single mosquito via humans.

If the disease is still in its early stages-that is, if the initial conditions are sufficiently small-then the system will approach the disease-free equilibrium and the disease will be eradicated. However, if the initial conditions are large, then the system will approach the endemic equilibrium and the disease will persist.

This is because the presence of exploitable heterogeneities, such as high variance in the number of potentially infectious contacts, increases R 0 ; thus, pathogens that can exploit heterogeneities in the contact structure have an advantage over those that do not. The exploitation of heterogeneities results in a more rapid depletion of the potentially susceptible neighbourhood for an infected host. While the low R 0 strategy is never evolutionarily stable, invading strains with higher R 0 will also converge to the low R 0 strategy if not sufficiently different from the resident strain.

If two networks have the same mean degree, k, then the one with the larger variance in degree, k 2 \u2212 k 2 , will be more vulnerable to the spread of disease. In compartment models, infected hosts are assumed to have potentially disease-causing contacts with random individuals from the population according to a Poisson process that yields an average contact rate of \u03b2 per unit time. The mass-action assumption of compartmental models is tantamount to assuming that the underlying contact patterns form a random graph with a Poisson degree distribution. Estimates of R 0 that assume a mass-action model may, therefore, be invalid for populations with non-Poisson contact patterns and, in particular, will underestimate the actual growth rate of the disease in highly heterogeneous networks.

Heffernan and Wahl [28] derived improved estimates of R 0 for situations in which information about the dispersal of transition times is available to the clinical or epidemiological practitioner. Rather than rederiving R 0 for a number of models (SIR, SEIR, etc.), they introduce a \"correction factor\", \u03c6: the ratio of R 0 when the lifetimes are nonexponentially distributed to the value of R 0 that would be calculated assuming exponential lifetimes. They were able to derive limiting values of \u03c6 and used this to gauge the sensitivity of R 0 to dispersion in the underlying distributions.",

Breban et al. [32] argued that in order to associate an R 0 to a model of ODEs, an individual-level model (ILM) which is compatible to the ODE model must be developed; only then can the R 0 of the ILM be unambiguously calculated. These ILMs are growing (not static) network models, with individuals added to a network of who infected whom based on global or local network rules. Then, R 0 is computed as the limit of the average number of outgoing links of individuals in a node that no longer accepts new links, as time goes to infinity.

Since the removed individuals are randomly sampled from the infectious individuals, the average length of the infectious period equals the time expectation of the infectious period, which is 1/\u03b2 (rather than 1/\u03bc, as calculated from the next-generation method). It follows that R 0 = 1, which is independent of the transmission and death rates from the corresponding ODE. Thus, in this case, R 0 does not signal epidemic growth as anticipated from other methods.

Wallinga and Lipsitch [52] investigated how generation intervals shape the relationship between growth rates and reproductive numbers. For new emerging infectious diseases, the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r can indirectly infer the value of the reproductive number. The existence of a few different equations that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate makes such inference ambiguous. It is unclear which of these equations might apply to new infection. The authors showed that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation-interval distribution. They found that the shape of the generation-interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. By assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, they obtained an upper bound on the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. They also showed that it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number by taking the generation-interval distribution equal to the observed distribution.",

They developed a system of linear difference equations and rearranged the dominant eigenvalue to find R 0 . A fraction q of infected spores are deposited in location 1, while a fraction 1 \u2212 q are deposited in location 2. This results in R 0 = q \u03b3 1 \u03b1 1 \u03c4 1 \u03c1H + 1 \u2212 q \u03b3 2 \u03b1 2 \u03c4 2 \u03c1H , (A.9)",

However, the endemic level of infection is highly sensitive to changes in R 0 when R 0 > 1.

However, if increases in transmission rates or decreases in the decay of free-living inoculum increase R 0 , then the endemic level of infection first increases (for 1 < R 0 < 2) but then decreases (for R 0 > 2). Consequently, increasing the intensity of control can result in more endemic infection.",
