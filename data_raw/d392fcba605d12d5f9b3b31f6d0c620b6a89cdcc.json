We have previously demonstrated that curcumin-loaded polyvinylpyrrolidone nanoparticles (CURN) improve the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of curcumin in hepatocytes. In this study, we focused on the effects of CURN on the expression of ICAM-1 in TNF-a-treated lung epithelial cells and compared these to the effects of curcumin water preparation (CURH). TNF-ainduced ICAM-1 expression, ROS production, and cell-cell adhesion were significantly attenuated by the pretreatment with antioxidants (DPI, APO, or NAC) and CURN, but not by CURH, as revealed by western blot analysis, RT-PCR, promoter assay, and ROS detection and adhesion assay. In addition, treatment of TNF-a-treated cells with CURN and antioxidants also resulted in an inhibition of activation of p47 phox and phosphorylation of MAPKs, as compared to that using CURH. Our findings also suggest that phosphorylation of MAPKs may eventually lead to the activation of transcription factors. We also observed that the effects of TNF-a treatment for 30 min, which includes a significant increase in the binding activity of AP-1 and phosphorylation of c-jun and c-fos genes, were reduced by CURN treatment. In vivo studies have revealed that CURN improved the antiinflammation activities of CURH in the lung epithelial cells of TNF-a-treated mice. Our results indicate that curcumin-loaded polyvinylpyrrolidone nanoparticles may potentially serve as an anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of respiratory diseases.",

Increased levels of adhesion molecules might contribute to the recruitment of PMNs to the various regions of the lung during the inflammation process [3] . Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is one of the most important adhesion molecules; it mediates the tight adhesiveness of PMNs, facilitates PMN migration across the vascular endothelium barrier, and interacts with lung epithelium [4] . Reduced expression of ICAM-1 in the lung epithelium is currently considered as a novel therapeutic approach in the management of respiratory diseases. Previously, upregulation of ICAM-1 by cytokines has been shown to be regulated by the phosphorylation of three MAPKs, p38, JNK1/2, and Erk1/2, as well as transcription factors such as nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) in lung epithelial cells [5, 6] . Recently, increasing evidence have shown that NADPH oxidase (NOX)-derived ROS generation can modify signaling through the oxidation of reactive cysteines within certain cell signaling molecules, especially MAPKs or transcription factors such as NF-kB and AP-1 [7, 8] . The NOX family of ROSproducing enzymes has been increasingly recognized as a major source of ROS in cells. At least seven NOX isoforms have been identified, namely, NOX1 to 5 and Duox1 and Duox2; each isoform is distinguished according to tissue distribution, structure, and mode of activation [9, 10] . NOX2, now known as gp91 phox , is the first isoform discovered and is the most extensively studied NOX member. Activation of NOX2 is partially regulated by the assembly of the catalytic gp91 phox subunit with the regulatory subunits (p22 phox , p47 phox , p40 phox , and small GTPase, Rac). The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADPH to molecular oxygen, generating superoxide anions and other forms of ROS as by-products. While NOX2 is most highly expressed in phagocytes, expression has also been detected in various cells, including lung epithelium [11, 12] . Moreover, elevated levels of ROS have been shown to activate signal transduction cascades and to drive the expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and astrocytes [13, 14] . Thus, blockade of ROS production may be selectively targeted to reduce neutrophil adhesion through adhesion molecule suppression and attenuation of the inflammatory responses in lung diseases.",

            "text": "Curcumin, a naturally occurring phenolic compound found in Curcuma longa, has been shown to possess potent anti-oxidant, antiinflammatory, and anti-tumor activities. It can regulate multiple transcription factors, cytokines, growth factors, kinases, and other enzymes [15, 16] . However, curcumin has low bioavailability and this is attributable to its poor aqueous solubility and dissolution properties. Nanonization serves as a mechanism to circumvent this limitation, facilitating in the production of curcumin nanoparticles that are highly water-soluble. Increasing water solubility may also increase the biodistribution and bioavailability of curcumin, and potentially slow down its rapid metabolism and systemic elimination [17, 18] . We have utilized polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for the development of a novel curcumin nanoparticle system (CURN). PVP is a strong hydrophilic polymer that has been extensively utilized in improving the solubility and bioavailability of compounds with poor water-solubility; it delays the crystallization of compounds by forming molecular adducts [19] . Our previous study demonstrated that the physicochemical properties of curcumin using the PVP nanoparticle system have improved; these include a reduction in the compound particle size, the formation of a high-energy amorphous state, and the induction of intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which altogether enhanced its water solubility and drug release. Moreover, the improvement in drug release has enhanced the antioxidant and anticancer effects of CURN in hepatocytes compared to the CUR water preparation.",

All procedures involving experimental animals used in this study were reviewed and approved by the Animal Use Committee of National Taiwan University, indicating that the investigation conforms to the US NIH guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals ''NIH publication No. 86-23, revised 1985''. Mice were randomly divided into four groups: Saline, TNF-a, TNF-a/CURN, and TNF-a/CURH groups. Before administration of CURN and CURH, CURN powder was added in normal saline and sonicated for 5 min and the preparation of CURH was made by the same method. Mice were anesthetized and intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with CURN, CURH (200 mg/ Kg) or Saline for 1 h. TNF-a (0.75 mg/Kg) was placed posterior in the throat and aspirated into lungs for 24 h.

We also compared the effects of CURN and CURH on TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 expression. As shown in Fig. 1B , TNF-ainduced ICAM-1 protein expression was significantly inhibited by the pretreatment with 5, 10, or 50 mM CURN; this response followed a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were also observed in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (data not show). In addition, TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 mRNA expression and promoter activity were also reduced after pretreatment with CURN (Figs. 1C and D) . However, these effects were not observed with insoluble curcumin (CURH) and PVP (as a void nanoparticle, Fig. 1E ). To further compare the functional consequences of CURN and CURH treatment, we performed a cell adhesion assay using U937 cells as monocytes adhering to A549 cells that were pretreated with TNF-a for 24 h. The number of adherent U937 cells dramatically decreased after pretreatment with CURN, but not with CURH (Fig. 1F ). In addition, the adhesion activity was also blocked by DPI (inhibitor of NOX) and tanshinone IIA (inhibitor of AP-1). These results suggested that pretreatment with CURN inhibits TNF-a-induced lung inflammatory responses, which may be regulated by ICAM-1 inhibition. On the other hand, TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 expression might be mediated through NOX and AP-1 in A549 cells and by enhanced monocyte-A549 interactions.",

NOX is an enzymatic source for the production of ROS under various pathologic conditions. To ascertain that the generation of ROS was involved in TNF-a- Fig. 2A , TNF-a-induced ROS generation was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with CURN, DPI, and APO (inhibitor of NOX2), whereas no similar effects were observed with CURH. Pretreatment with a ROS scavenger (NAC) or the DPI and APO also markedly inhibited TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 protein expression (Fig. 2B) . Moreover, NOX2 consists of the membrane catalytic subunits gp91 phox and p22 phox , together with several cytosolic regulatory subunits, p47 phox , p40 phox , p67 phox , and a small GTPase Rac [9, 11, 25] . The p47 phox regulatory subunit plays a critical role in the acute activation of NOX. In the present study, we showed that TNF-a induced p47 phox phosphorylation and translocation from the cytosol to the membrane within 15 min; such effects were inhibited by CURN and APO (Fig. 2C) . However, CURH showed no effects on p47 phox phosphorylation and translocation. Moreover, pretreatment with CURN, DPI, and APO also resulted in a reduction in NADPH oxidase activity in response to TNF-a in A549 cells (Fig. 2D) . We finally performed the experiments using siRNAs of NOX2 and p47 phox . As shown in Figs. 2E and F, transfection with siRNAs of NOX2 and p47 phox inhibited the expression of ICAM-1 in response to TNF-a. These results thus show that CURN, and not CURH, reduced ICAM-1 expression through the inhibition of NOX2/ROS generation in A549 cells, indicating that CURN exerts better antioxidant activity than CURH.",

Thus, the effects of CURN pretreatment on TNF-a-induced MAPK phosphorylation were compared with that of CURH. As shown in Figs. 3A-C, the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38, and JNK1/2 was significantly attenuated by U0126, SB202190, and SP600125, respectively. Furthermore, pretreatment with CURN, NAC and DPI also resulted in a significant decrease in TNF-ainduced MAPKs phosphorylation, whereas no similar effects were observed with that using CURH.

Gel-shift assays were performed to determine the effects of CURN and CURH on AP-1 and NF-kB activation in TNF-atreated A549 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A , low basal levels of AP-1 binding activity were detected in untreated control cells, whereas binding was significantly increased after TNF-a treatment for 30 min. Pretreatment with CURN for 24 h inhibited an increase in AP-1 binding activity, whereas no similar results were observed in that using CURH. TNF-a also enhanced the NF-kB binding activity, although no differences were observed using CURN and CURH (data not shown). Pretreatment with inhibitors of NF-kB (Bay117082) or AP-1 (Tanshinone IIA) resulted in a significant decrease in TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 expression; this response occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 4B and C). In addition, the AP-1 transcriptional complex is composed of at least two major factors, c-Fos and c-Jun. The phosphorylation of c-Fos and c-Jun were detected under TNF-a stimulation (Fig. 4D) . Pretreatment with CURN and DPI resulted in a significant decrease in c-Fos and c-Jun phosphorylation, whereas no similar effects were observed with CURH. These results suggest that CURN imparts a greater inhibitory effect on the TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 expression by blocking AP-1 activation. ",

As shown in Fig. 6 , curcumin distribution in the lung tissue and the curcumin level is 934.9672.1 ng/gm. The HPLC chromatography of CURHtreated lung tissue only showed a curcumin signal, whereas the curcumin level was below the detection limit. Based on these findings, CURN can distribute greater amounts of curcumin in the lung tissues as compared to CURH. It has also been determined that the curcumin levels in the lung tissues were higher with CURN, as compared to that using CURH (Table 1 ).

It is commonly used as a spice, food preservative, and nontoxic agent. Extensive research lasting the past five decades has revealed that curcumin possess anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancerous, anti-microbial, anti-parasitic, anti-cholesterol, anti-mutagenic properties, woundhealing properties, cardiovascular, and hepatic and neuronal protective activities [18, [31] [32] [33] . However, the low level of water solubility of curcumin has become a major limiting factor in preclinical dissolution testing for drug and health food applications. Thus, for curcumin to exhibit its therapeutic effects in the human body, a person is required to swallow between 12 and 20 g of curcumin per day. For decades, nanotechnology platforms have been widely used to create delivery systems for natural products and nutraceuticals with poor water solubility [15, 17, 34] . Our previous study utilized PVP in the development of CURN. Previous reports have described the enhanced antioxidant and anticancer effects of CURN in hepatocytes compared to curcumin water preparations [19] . In the current study, we analyzed the inhibitory effects of CURN on ICAM-1 expression both in vitro, in TNF-a-stimulated lung epithelial cells, and in vivo, in the lung epithelium of TNF-a-treated mice; these effects were also compared to that using CURH and in relation to the ROSderived MAPKs pathways. The results of our study showed that CURN decreased the expression of ICAM-1, inhibited NADPH oxidase (NOX)-derived ROS generation, and reduced MAPKs and AP-1 transcription factor binding activities.",

            "text": "Comparative analysis of the anti-inflammatory effects of CURN and CURH on lung epithelial cells showed a significantly greater inhibition of ICAM-1 expression in both gene and protein levels (Figs. 1B-D) . However, TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 expression was not attenuated by CURH and PVP (as a void nanoparticle, Fig. 1E ). In the functional activity assay, CURN showed an inhibition in the binding activity of the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 to TNF-a-stimulated lung epithelial cells; a similar effect was not observed using CURH treatment (Fig. 1F) . In vivo study performed in BAL fluid isolation in mice also showed that CURN reduced PMN influx, such effect was also shown on the treatment with antibodies of TNFR1 and ICAM-1 (Fig. 5C ). Although the CURN treatment results in a decrease in the ICAM-1 expression (Fig. 1B) , it only partially affects monocyte adhesion (Fig. 1F ) and leukocyte infiltration (Fig. 5C) . Thus, other factors may also be associated with ICAM-1 expression, such as vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) [35] or selectin [36] . The putative functional groups of curcumin, a benzene ring with adjacent methoxy-hydroxyl groups, serve as a potent inhibitor of NOX activity [37] . Interestingly, pretreatment with DPI (inhibitor of NOX) caused a significant reduction in TNF-a-enhanced monocyte-A549 interactions. These results suggest that CURN inhibits TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 expression through more potent antioxidative properties. Further, we compared with the antioxidant activity of CURN and CURH on the expression of ICAM-1 upon TNF-a stimulation. When lung tissues are exposed to oxidative stress, NOX isoforms represent a major source of ROS within the respiratory system. ROS have also been shown to mediate the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in airways [38] . In our present data, pretreatment with CURN, DPI, and APO markedly reduced both ROS generation and NOX activation; similar effects were not observed with CURH treatment (Figs. 2A and D). In addition, antioxidants (NAC, DPI, and APO) also inhibited TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 expression, suggesting that ROS regulated the effects of TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 expression (Fig. 2D ). NOX is a multi-subunit enzymatic complex responsible for the production of superoxide caused by the monoelectronic reduction of oxygen using NADPH or NADH. In addition, NOX2 is robustly expressed in lung alveolar epithelial cells and involved in the regulation of epithelial cell function [39] . Here, we generated robust evidence that transfection with siRNAs of NOX2 and p47 phox can block the expression of ICAM-1 in response to TNF-a (Figs. 2E and F). Although the NOX2 plays a critical role in lung inflammation, which may be influenced by ICAM-1 expression, the epithelial cells also expressed other species of NOX, such as NOX1 and NOX4. Both NOX1 and NOX4 are key players in epithelial cell death, leading to pulmonary fibrosis [40] and acute lung injury [41] . Whether NOX1 and NOX4 are involved in the TNF-a-induced lung inflammation needs to be investigated in the future. Moreover, phosphorylation of p47 phox acts as the organizer of NOX2 complex by facilitating the assembly, translocation, and binding of the cytosolic subunits to the gp91 phox /p22 phox catalytic complex. We therefore compared with the effect of CURN and CURH on the activation of p47 phox . As shown in Fig. 2C , CURN and APO have more potent inhibitory effects on the p47 phox activation, which included phosphorylation and translocation from the cytosol to the membrane within 15 min of TNF-a treatment. In contrast, CURH showed no effects on p47 phox phosphorylation and translocation. These results suggest that CURN reduced ICAM-1 expression through the inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity and p47 phox activation in the membrane fraction of TNF-a-treated A549 cells, thus exerting stronger antioxidant activity than CURH.",

The MAPKs, which consist of three major members, namely, ERK, p38, and JNK, are a family of serine/threonine kinases that control cellular responses to growth, apoptosis, inflammation, and stress signals [42, 43] . The upregulation of ICAM-1 by cytokines has been shown to be mediated through activation of MAPKs in A549 cells [44] . This study compared with the effects of CURN and CURH on the phosphorylation of MAPKs. We have found that pretreatment with U0126, SB202190, and SP600125 resulted in a decrease in TNF-a-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38, and JNK1/2, respectively (Figs. 3A-C) . Additionally, we also demonstrated that ROS was involved in TNF-a-induced MAPKs phosphorylation after cells were treated with antioxidants, NAC, and DPI. Our data also showed that CURN, but not CURH, markedly inhibited TNF-a-induced MAPKs phosphorylation, which may be mediated through its potent antioxidant activities.",

Transcription factors such as NF-kB and AP-1 have been shown to regulate VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression induced by TNF-a [8, 20] . Thus, we first confirmed the involvement of NF-kB and AP-1 in TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 expression by incubation with inhibitors of Bay117082 and Tanshinone IIA as shown in Figs. 4B and C. Moreover, gel-shift assays demonstrated that binding of NF-kB and AP-1 to the ICAM-1 promoter was increased by TNF-a and that pretreatment with CURN significantly attenuated TNF-a-induced AP-1 binding activity (Fig. 4A ), but not NF-kB (data not shown). The possible mechanism underlying the effect of curcumin on NF-kB inhibition remains to be investigated. Furthermore, AP-1 functions as a dimer in the form of c-Fos/c-Jun or c-Jun/c-Jun. We examined the effect of CURN or CURH on c-Fos and c-Jun phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4D , both c-Fos and c-Jun phosphorylation were markedly inhibited by CURN and DPI; such effects were not found after treatment with CURH. Based on our findings and previous reports, CURN shows greater inhibitory effects than CURH on TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 expression and this is attributable to the inhibition of the NOX2/ROS/MAPKs/AP-1-dependent pathway in A549 cells.",

Therefore, the present study also measured the curcumin levels in the lungs to confirm its distribution after CURN and CURH treatment. Our results (Table 1) demonstrated that intraperitoneally injected CURN results in a higher curcumin level distribution in the lungs as compared to that using CURH. These findings suggest that CURN can increase the cell uptake in lungs and then show better antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities than CURH. In the present study, examination of an animal model of TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 expression and inflammatory cells infiltration established the superiority of CURN over CURH in the pulmonary protective effect (Figs. 5A and B) ; this may be attributable to its effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Consequently, we suggest that CURN deserves further study and may potentially be used during prophylaxis of inflammatory pulmonary diseases.",
