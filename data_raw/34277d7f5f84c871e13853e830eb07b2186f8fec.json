            "text": "There is an urgent need for the rational design of safe and effective vaccines to protect against chronic bacterial pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Advax \u2122 is a novel adjuvant based on delta inulin microparticles that enhances immunity with a minimal inflammatory profile and has entered human trials to protect against viral pathogens. In this report we determined if Advax displays broad applicability against important human pathogens by assessing protective immunity against infection with M. tuberculosis. The fusion protein CysVac2, comprising the M. tuberculosis antigens Ag85B (Rv1886c) and CysD (Rv1285) formulated with Advax provided significant protection in the lungs of M. tuberculosis-infected mice. Protection was associated with the generation of CysVac2specific multifunctional CD4 + T cells (IFN-\u03b3 + TNF + IL-2 + ). Addition to Advax of the TLR9 agonist, CpG oligonucleotide (Advax CpG ), improved both the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of CysVac2. Immunisation with CysVac2/Advax CpG resulted in heightened release of the chemoattractants, CXCL1, CCL3, and TNF, and rapid influx of monocytes and neutrophils to the site of vaccination, with pronounced early priming of CysVac2-specific CD4 + T cells. As delta inulin adjuvants have shown an excellent safety and tolerability profile in humans, CysVac2/Advax CpG is a strong candidate for further preclinical evaluation for progression to human trials.",

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major world health problem, with over 10 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths per year worldwide 1 . The current vaccine, M. bovis BCG displays variable protection in humans and new TB vaccines are urgently required 2 . Although genetic engineering has allowed the development of recombinant proteins in large scale, vaccination with such antigens alone is generally insufficient to elicit a protective immune response and adjuvants are required to enhance antigen-specific immune responses, although in many cases the mechanism of adjuvant action is still not well defined 3 . A major challenge is how to achieve a potent adjuvant effect while avoiding reactogenicity and toxicity. Unfortunately, the most potent adjuvants are typically associated with the greatest local and systemic toxicity (e.g. complete Freund's adjuvant 4 ), thereby largely precluding their use particularly in a prophylactic vaccine setting. Ideally, in addition to being safe and well tolerated, adjuvants should promote an appropriate (humoral and/or cellular) immune response, have a long shelf-life, and be stable, biodegradable and cheap to produce.",

For example the immunomodulatory molecule MPL (Monophosphoryl Lipid A) in AS01 adjuvant 5 or the MPL synthetic analogue glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA) 6 and the mycobacterial cell wall component trehalose dimycolate (TDM) as part of the CAF01 adjuvant 7 are inflammatory adjuvants that initiate responses through pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 (MPL and derivatives) or macrophage inducible Ca 2+ -dependent lectin (Mincle) for TDM. Oligonucleotide as a component of IC31 adjuvant acts through TLR9 to similarly activate NF-kB and resultant pro-inflammatory cytokine release 8 .",

            "text": "Advax-formulated vaccines induce polyfunctional CD4 + T cells. CysVac2, a fusion protein comprising the M. tuberculosis Ag85B and CysD antigens, was previously found to provide protective immunity against pulmonary M. tuberculosis challenge in mice when formulated with MPL combined with dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDA) 23 . Because of its high adjuvanticity, MPL is reported to be highly reactogenic 24 and does not adequately stimulate long-term T cell memory 25 . As concerns of MPL-DDA toxicity make the combination unsuitable for human use, there was a necessity to identify an alternative safe and effective human adjuvant for CysVac2 to advance to human trials. Advax adjuvant has proved safe and well tolerated in human influenza vaccines 20 and hence we sought to test its ability to enhance CysVac2-induced protective immunity. Mice were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 3 doses of CysVac2/Advax or CysVac2/Advax incorporating CpG (Advax CpG ) and immunogenicity was assessed by examining CysVac2-specific responses in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 4 weeks after the last vaccination. The CysVac2/Advax CpG group showed a high frequency of triple positive IFN-\u03b3 + IL-2 + TNF + and double positive IFN-\u03b3 + IL-2 + producing CD4 + T cells in antigen-stimulated PBMCs (Fig. 1A,B) . By contrast, the levels of these poly-functional T cells induced by CysVac2/Advax were much lower (Fig. 1B) . Examination of the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells by ELISPOT demonstrated that both CysVac2/Advax and CysVac2/Advax CpG induced comparable IFN-\u03b3 responses (Fig. 1C) . No IL-17A production was detectable from PBMCs from mice vaccinated with either CysVac2/Advax formulation (data not shown). Together, these results show that vaccination with CysVac2/Advax CpG , and to a lesser extent CysVac2/Advax, induces a vaccine-specific Th1-like response.",

Considering the Th1 response elicited by the Advax-adjuvanted vaccines, we next determined if they could afford protection against low dose aerosol challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis. Vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with BCG, CysVac2/Advax or CysVac2/Advax CpG resulted in an approximate 1 Log 10 reduction in lung M. tuberculosis CFU counts compared to unvaccinated mice, and this difference was statistically significant ( Fig. 2A ). CysVac2/ Advax CpG induced the greatest level of protection, although this was not significantly greater than that seen in CysVac2/Advax-vaccinated mice. The protection afforded by CysVac2/Advax CpG was equivalent to that observed with BCG (Fig. 2) . The lungs of unvaccinated mice were characterised by large unorganised areas of inflammatory infiltrate mostly composed of cells with large amounts of cytoplasm, most likely macrophages (see Supplementary  Fig. S1 ). In the lungs of BCG-vaccinated mice there was generally less tissue involvement with smaller lesions of macrophage-like cells and high numbers of lymphocytes. Lungs of both CysVac2/Advax-and CysVac2/ Advac CpG -vaccinated animals demonstrated reduced cellular infiltration with more organisation and were characterised by the presence of higher number of lymphocytes compared to the unvaccinated group. These results indicate that CysVac2 when formulated with Advax adjuvant formulations can reduce pulmonary bacterial load and infection-induced pathology in mice challenged with aerosolised M. tuberculosis.",

At 2 days post-immunisation, CFSE-labelled p25-TgTCR CD4 + T cells had started to proliferate in the auricular lymph nodes (aLN) in both CysVac2 and CysVac2/Advax CpG groups, with proliferation more pronounced in the mice immunised with CysVac2/Advax CpG (Fig. 5A ). At this early timepoint, the total number of p25-TgTCR CD4 + T cells was significantly greater in CysVac2/Advax CpG compared to PBS-vaccinated mice (Fig. 5B ). By 4 days post-immunisation, division of CFSE-labelled p25-TgTCR CD4 + T cells in the aLN started to be seen in the CysVac2 alone group (Fig. 4A ), but with ~3-fold higher numbers of proliferating p25-TgTCR cells in the CysVac2/ Advax CpG group (Fig. 5C) . Furthermore, analysis of cytokine release by CD4 + T cells after Ag85B 240-254 peptide re-stimulation revealed that a high proportion of p25-TgTCR CD4 + T cells from CysVac2+ Advax CpG -vaccinated animals displayed a triple positive phenotype (IFN-\u03b3 + IL-2 + TNF + ), followed by double-positive cells producing either IFN-\u03b3 + TNF + or IL-2 + TNF + (Fig. 5D ). By contrast, mice vaccinated with CysVac2 alone, Advax CpG alone or PBS exhibited mainly TNF + CD4 + T cells, although the CysVac2 alone group also exhibited a significant proportion of double positive IL-2 + TNF + -secreting CD4 + T cells (Fig. 5D) .

This study assessed the capacity of Advax delta inulin-based adjuvants to induce protective cellular immunity against M. tuberculosis infection. Advax adjuvants have been used to induce protective immunity against a wide range of pathogens across multiple animal species and, most importantly, have already been shown to be well-tolerated and immunogenic in human subjects [20] [21] [22] 31 . This report demonstrates for the first time that Advax adjuvants, when formulated with CysVac2 fusion protein, confer protection against aerosol challenge with M. tuberculosis (Fig. 2) . The level of protection induced by Advax-adjuvanted vaccines (ranging from 0.6 to 1 Log 10 CFU reduction compared to unvaccinated mice) is similar to that seen in preclinical studies of other TB vaccine candidates that have entered clinical trials, for example H56/CAF01 32 , ID93/GLA-SE 33 or M72/AS02 34 . Notably, Advax alone, as a single component adjuvant, could provide significant protection against M. tuberculosis, while the adjuvants used above are more complex and require multiple components to achieve a protective effect. The identification of Advax as a novel antigen that protects against a broad array of pathogens, including TB, complements the recent report demonstrating that different adjuvants display distinct immunological signatures that is independent of the vaccine antigen 35 .",

            "text": "The addition of CpG to Advax (Advax CpG ) further improved protection, similar to results when CpG had been added to other TB candidates such as ID93/GLA-SE 36 . Enhanced protection through addition of CpG to Advax has previously been seen in vaccines against SARS in mice 37 , Japanese encephalitis and West Nile virus in mice 12 and horses 38 and pandemic avian influenza in ferrets 39 . This suggests the synergistic protection observed in the current study with these two adjuvant components is a widely generalizable phenomenon. Based on these beneficial effects, human Phase I vaccine trials involving Advax CpG adjuvant are currently underway (Petrovsky et al., unpublished observations). The mechanism whereby CpG synergises with the delta inulin component of Advax is currently under investigation. As shown here, use of Advax CpG was particularly associated with an increased frequency of triple-positive IFN-\u03b3 + IL-2 + TNF + cells and greater chemotaxis of immune cells to the injection site than Advax alone. This suggests that the addition of CpG to Advax helps drive greater chemotaxis and a stronger effector memory T cell response. Analysis of both the pre and post-infection immune response revealed that CysVac2 combined with either Advax formulations elicited a vaccine-specific Th1 response greater than the one elicited by BCG vaccine (Figs 1  and 3) . The ability of Advax to induce a strong IFN-\u03b3 recall response by antigen-specific T cells was also seen in influenza 14 and hepatitis B 13 immunisation models, amongst others. Analysis of cytokine secretion showed that Advax formulations successfully induced poly-functional CD4 + T cells; CysVac2/Advax CpG induced an appreciable level of triple-positive IFN-\u03b3 + IL-2 + TNF + cells both pre-and post-challenge, higher than that induced by CysVac2/Advax, BCG or in unvaccinated mice 40 . Levels of poly-functional CD4 + T cells have been shown to correlate with better protection in numerous models of infection including TB 41, 42 . In particular, it has been suggested that optimal TB protection can be achieved by the generation of a pool of triple-positive multifunctional T cells that can mediate rapid effector functions 43 . In CysVac2/Advax CpG vaccinated mice a double positive IL-2 + TNF + CD4 + T cell subset was observed, which are characteristic of central memory T cells with high 4) . The next day mice were injected i.d. in each ear with PBS, Advax CpG , CysVac2 protein alone, or CysVac2/ Advax CpG . p25-TgTCR CD4 + T cells CFSE dilution profiles and proliferation index (\u00b1SEM) were calculated (A). Total cell numbers were evaluated by flow cytometry at day 2 (B) or day 4 (C) in the auricular lymph node (aLN). Cells isolated from the aLN were re-stimulated over night in the presence of Ag85B 240-254 /brefeldin A and the frequency of p25-TgTCR CD4 + T cells producing IFN-\u03b3, IL-2 or TNF was determined by intracellular staining and flow cytometry (D). Data (average \u00b1 SEM) is representative of two independent experiments. Statistical significance between groups was determined by ANOVA (**p < 0.01).",

However, in other studies, the presence of polyfunctional T cells in either MVA85A-vaccinated adults 45 or BCG-vaccinated infants 46 did not correlate with protection against TB in humans, highlighting the incomplete understanding of immune correlates of vaccine-induced TB protection. Th17 responses are thought to contribute to the protection against mycobacterial infection by triggering the expression of chemokines in the lung, which in turn may mediate the recruitment of protective T cells to the airways 47, 48 , However, Advax-adjuvanted vaccine formulations afforded significant protection against infection without inducing detectable levels of IL-17 (Fig. 3) . Notably, IL-17 may be a double-edged sword as excessive IL-17 is associated with heightened inflammation and tissue damage during mycobacterial infection 49 . Hence, adjuvants such as Advax that primarily induce multifunctional Th1 responses, rather than IL-17 dominated responses, may represent safer candidates for human TB vaccine use.",

            "text": "The local response induced by adjuvants at the site of injection represents the first series of events that leads to a protective immune response, and has been characterised for a number of experimental adjuvants including MF59 50 , MPL/DDA 51 and CAF01 52 . In this study we showed that injection of Advax formulations induced chemoattractants/cytokines, such as CXCL1, CCL3, IL-6 and TNF, which may be responsible for the observed rapid influx of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages to the site of vaccination (Fig. 4) . Innate cell populations interact in a very complex microenvironment and as such the distinct roles of each of these populations and their individual contribution to effective vaccine-induced immunity is not completely defined 53 . For example, neutrophils rapidly internalise mycobacteria and can participate in the initiation of adaptive immunity and supress the release of inflammatory cytokines by Th17 cells 48, 49 . The suppression of neutrophil apoptosis appears to be a strategy used by M. tuberculosis to delay the activation of CD4 + T cells 50 . Adjuvant-induced neutrophils have been shown to regulate the level of antigen presentation by DCs to APCs 50, 54 , and hence neutrophils attracted to the site of immunization by Advax adjuvants may assist in enhancing antigen presentation and local T-cell activation. However, the role of neutrophils in protective immunity to TB is complex as excessive neutrophil infiltration during M. tuberculosis infection of the mouse is associated with increased lung pathology, which is more pronounced in susceptible hosts 52, 53. We also observed recruitment of large numbers of monocytes/macrophage (Fig. 4) , in particular CD64 + Ly6C hi monocytes/macrophages, a subset shown to be able to differentiate into DCs and migrate to the draining LN to facilitate antigen presentation 55 . Indeed, we observed that a single dose of CysVac2 when formulated with Advax CpG induced significant recruitment and local priming of vaccine-specific CD4 + T cells, resulting in generation of polyfunctional CD4 + T cells secreting multiple Th1 effector cytokines in the draining LN (Fig. 5 ). This supports a role for Advax adjuvants in inducing local injection site chemotactic signals, that recruit antigen presenting cells to the site of immunisation, leading to enhanced antigen presentation and activation and expansion of memory T cells. Upon injection Advax particles are rapidly endocytosed by dendritic cells (DC), although the specific receptor(s) mediating this process is still unknown (Petrovsky et al., unpublished observations) . Delta inulin retains its adjuvant action in MYD88/TRIF double knockout mice indicating that it does not require TLR signalling for its action (Petrovsky et al., unpublished observations) . However, further studies are required to determine if these cell subsets are directly involved in Advax uptake and T cell priming; antigen-loaded APCs are refractory to T cell stimulation during mycobacterial infection 56 , while the timing of antigen and adjuvant delivery to APCs is critical for the induction of CD4 + T cell responses 57 . Like neutrophils, monocyte/macrophage accumulation can have a deleterious effect during mycobacterial infection 56 and therefore the level of myeloid cell recruitment induced by vaccine recall responses may be critical for the balance between effective immunity and immunopathology. Reassuringly, there was no evidence of any local or systemic toxicity either pre-or post-challenge in mice that received CysVac2/Advax CpG immunisation, which supports the safety and tolerability data on Advax adjuvants seen in recent human trials 58 .",

Considering the acceptable safety and tolerability profile of Advax in humans 58 , the CysVac2/Advax CpG combination is a strong candidate for further preclinical evaluation and progression to human trials.",
