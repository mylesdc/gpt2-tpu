Infectious disease epidemiologists and several leading public health administrators at the Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan (Taiwan-CDC) becoming aware of the importance of early detection of EID or bioterrorism, started developing an automatic alert system. Therefore, the Automatic Syndromic Surveillance Planning Task Force Committee was created and recruited infection physicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, and information technology (IT) experts in July 2003 to oversee the initiation and development of Taiwan's first medical informatics-based emergency department syndromic surveillance system (ED-SSS).",

RODS, used during the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, is the first commonly used syndromic surveillance system in the United States and has been found to efficiently process and analyze data in a timely manner [9] [10] [11] . Together, the task force and the RODS group aimed to establish a nationwide syndromic surveillance system within six months to meet the challenges of potential avian flu outbreaks for up-coming winter seasons and other future EIDs. To gain more operational level experiences, we also visited the Department of Health in New York City, where syndromic surveillance system was established and has been in daily operation since 2001 [12] . There, the task force members observed routine workflow processes and became familiar with other practical concerns of operating an ED-SSS on a daily basis. Based on these experiences and high population density in Taiwan, we decided to create a nationwide surveillance system. To this nationwide ED-SSS, we added geographical information system (GIS) technology, meant to facilitate epidemiological investigation and feedback between data providers and decision-makers [13] .",

There were: (1) fever, (2) respiratory, (3) skin, (4) neurological, (5) upper gastrointestinal (GI), (6) lower GI, (7) haemorrhagic, (8) influenza-like illness (ILI), (9) asthma, (10) enterovirus-related infection (EVI) syndrome, and (11) syndrome for severe illness or death. Since only about 25% of all chief complaints were written fully in English and the grouping of syndromes by chief-complaints due to Chinese language barriers would have effects on the outbreak detection ability, we first analyzed our data according to the ICD-9 coded syndrome groups [15] . Definitions of clinical syndromes were based on two different sources: (1) those associated with bioterrorism-related agents as announced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the U.S.; and (2) those identified as important by the ED-SSS Advisory Committee in Taiwan, whose members include infectious disease physicians, emergency doctors, pediatricians, and epidemiologists [16] . For example, because the epidemics of enterovirus 71 caused severe fatal cases in Taiwan in the years of 1998, 2000 and 2001, the EVI syndrome group was considered as an important syndrome group locally (ICD-9 codes listed in Table 2 ) [17] . All patient information was de-identified and only aggregated data was used for data analysis. The protocol for this study was approved by the Research Ethical Committee (Institutional Review Board) of National Taiwan University. 20 Coxsackie carditis, unspecified 074. 21 Coxsackie pericarditis 074. 22 Coxsackie endocarditis 074. 23 Coxsackie myocarditis, Aseptic myocarditis of newborn 074. 3 Hand, foot, and mouth disease Vesicular stomatitis and exanthem 074. 8 Other specified diseases due to Coxsackie virus, Acute lymphonodular pharyngitis Although the ED-SSS data started transferring on March 10, 2004, we confined our analysis to data collected between April 1, 2004 (when the data became more stabilized) and March 31, 2005 . Data were organized using statistical programs to perform a descriptive analysis of the daily and weekly plots of different syndrome cases and obtain a baseline pattern for each syndrome in Taiwan. We initially generated the SQL commands for data querying and data grouping into the 11 different syndromic groups. To increase the sensitivity of this ED-SSS in monitoring regional patterns of these 11 syndrome groups, we categorized ED-SSS data by four different geographical areas (northern, central, southern and eastern Taiwan), based on major regional variations in the types of infec-tious diseases. In analyzing the seasonal patterns of ED visits, the correlation between the ILI syndrome and respiratory or asthma syndrome was assessed by the value of Pearson's coefficient (R). the Taiwan-CDC on a daily basis. The greatest challenge as began to develop this system was communication with different hospitals. Because different hospitals were using different information systems and inputting different data with various formats, it took long time to agree which variables and their data format should be collected. At the very beginning to build the ED-SSS, we had at first intended to collect information on a large set of epidemiologically useful variables, including occupation, travel history, family clustering, other exposure-related factors, and address for each patient to help detect possible zoonosis. However, such data were not collected during routine medical examination and care. Finally, we decided to capture only parameters usually collected by the hospitals during examination, intake and care.",

Public health officials tended to prefer a timely and sensitive surveillance system able to detect all possible outbreaks of emerging or known infectious diseases. Mostly concerned over the limited public health resources, they wanted more evidence to prove the cost-effectiveness of ED-SSS and fewer false positive signals from pilot studies before integrating the system into routine public health surveillance workflow. On the other hand, the hospitals and their medical staff had three major expectations. First, the hospitals expected an easily operated feedback mechanism and quick feedback of useful information for better decision-making. Those who had experienced nosocomial infection of SARS during the 2003 SARS outbreak were particularly interested having analyzed information, based on their own hospital or regional/national hospital data, quickly fed back them. They believed that this would provide incentive for them to share hospital data and routinely maintain the high quality of their data for public health usage. Second, the hospitals anticipated two-way communication with public health agencies, as they frequently been requested or even forced to send data on short notice when they were too busy or too involved in emergency care. What made matters worse, despite their compliance; they had difficulty in obtaining useful feedback information from the public health agencies so that they could improve their care of patients at the time of an outbreak crisis. Third, the hospital decision-makers wanted immediate firsthand feedback, particularly with regard to control of nosocomial infection and hospital management in order that their health-care workers could be protected during regional outbreaks. Considering the expectations of both public health agencies and hospitals, we learned that the syndromic surveillance system should provide efficient means of feedback and effective two-way communication.",

ED visits were 1.288-fold-higher on weekends than on weekdays (p < 0.001), while national During this first year study, the ED-SSS found patients throughout Taiwan were more likely to seek emergency medical services at medical centers than at district or local hospitals. Most patients visiting ED were 60 years old or older (21.46%) or below the age of 10 years old (18.55%). These two groups were also at greatest risk for various infectious diseases, especially influenza (Table 3) . Young adults between 20 to 39 years old ranked the third most frequent visitors to ED (17.43%), though traffic accidents, not infectious diseases, were the main reasons for their visits. These age distributions suggest that the newly established ED-SSS was capable of providing information for the age groups most at risk for severe cases of infectious diseases in Taiwan. Male ED patients slightly outnumbered female ED patients (male : female = 1.12:1), which approximates the general distribution of gender in Taiwan (male/female ratio = 1.10). For elderly ED patients (age > 65 years old), the male/female ratio in our sample was the same as general population (male: female = 1.10:1).",

Importantly, the ED-SSS was able to detect peaks of these respiratory-related syndromes even occurred in or around the summer season (July to September), though their most noticeable peaks were found during the Chinese new year holidays ( Figure 5B, 5C, 5D ). Like respiratory infection syndrome, visits due to the fever syndrome also showed another peak during the summer (July to September) ( Figure 4A ). ED visits for respiratory syndrome peaked earlier (mid-September) than those visits for ILI (mid-October) and asthma syndrome (end of September, e.g. the transition period between summer and autumn).

Because cost of ED visits in Taiwan is not as expensive as it is in other countries, especially the United States, it is very likely that many patients seek ED medical care when local clinics are closed on weekends and holidays. It is also possible that the gathering of people on the holidays would increase the transmission of certain pathogens, particularly on cold days in closed spaces where respiratory viruses including influenza virus are easily transmitted.

Therefore, prospective monitoring of daily ongoing data of EVI syndrome in this high risk age group and early ED-SSS detection of enterovirus activities by local public health personnel might help minimize social panic among parents. Furthermore, the results on seasonal pattern of enterovirus-like infection in our ED-SSS was consistent with the previous epidemic patterns in Taiwan, again demonstrating the usefulness of ED-SSS to avoid future large-scale or severe epidemics caused by enteroviruses [18] . In summary, these initial findings suggest that it is necessary to develop algorithms capable of detecting aberrations for different syndrome groups from patients in different geographical areas of Taiwan, taking into account variations in the levels of medical care and the effect of weekends and holidays on ER visit.",

Certainly, continuous monitoring for these syndrome groups at both local and national levels will be very helpful in detecting possible bioterrorism or EIDs in future years. Using those trends in coma/death and other syndrome groups of clinical severity or unexpected symptoms/signs, our ED-SSS data have provided directions for further research in the areas of pathogen detection, epidemiological clues, and improvement in public health policies.

JSJW initiated the thoughts on Syndromic Surveillance for Emerging Infectious Disease in 2003. SWL worked on computer programming on ED-SSS and health informatics for surveillance systems of infectious disease at Taiwan-CDC. KCMC was a leader and coordinator on health informatics for surveillance systems of infectious diseases at Taiwan-CDC and gave the most administrative support on systematic improvement in health informatics. CH provided statistical consultation and chose the best statistical modeling method for outbreak detection in the initiation stage of establishing the ED-SSS. JHC was the Deputy Director at Taiwan-CDC in charge of improving surveillance of infectious diseases, coordinated the 189 hospitals designated for emergency health care to participate the ED-SSS, and provided strong administrative support on ED-SSS. YTC was a research assistant of ED-SSS in charge of the data analysis and project administrative assistance. HC was the Director of Department of Health in Taipei City and participated in the task force meetings from planning to implementation of ED-SSS in the perspective of the local government. CHC was the Section Chief of Department of Health in Taipei City in charge of surveillance, prevention and control of infectious diseases in Taipei City and gave suggestions health informatics and practical concerns from the viewpoints of local government. FCRT helped set up the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) system at Taiwan-CDC. MMW introduced our public health officials and scholars in Taiwan to the practical applications of RODS in the USA and informed us of recent progress of RODS. IJS, the former director of Taiwan-CDC, had the vision to invite scholars to discuss the improvement of infectious surveillance system in Taiwan right after the 2003 outbreak of SARS. CCK, involved in the improvement of infectious disease surveillance in Taiwan for more than twelve years, initiated research on syndromic surveillance, coordinated each trouble-shooting step as the ED-SSS was developed and implemented, and was involved the revision of the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.",
