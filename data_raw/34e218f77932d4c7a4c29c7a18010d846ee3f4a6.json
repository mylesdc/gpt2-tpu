Here, we show that IFITM proteins regulate murine CD4 + Th cell differentiation. Ifitm2 and Ifitm3 are expressed in wild-type (WT) CD4 + T cells. On activation, Ifitm3 was downregulated and Ifitm2 was upregulated. Resting Ifitm-family-deficient CD4 + T cells had higher expression of Th1-associated genes than WT and purified naive Ifitm-family-deficient CD4 + T cells differentiated more efficiently to Th1, whereas Th2 differentiation was inhibited. Ifitm-family-deficient mice, but not Ifitm3-deficient mice, were less susceptible than WT to induction of allergic airways disease, with a weaker Th2 response and less severe disease and lower Il4 but higher Ifng expression and IL-27 secretion. Thus, the Ifitm family is important in adaptive immunity, influencing Th1/Th2 polarization, and Th2 immunopathology.",

Their promoters have one or more interferon stimulated response elements (ISRE), which make them responsive to IFNs [2] . The IFITM family are also associated with germ cell specification during mouse embryonic development [3] [4] [5] , and may play a role in the immune system, as in human cells, early cross-linking antibody studies suggested that the IFITM1 protein (Leu13) was involved in T-cell activation [6] .",

Here, we investigate the function of the IFITM family in CD4 + Th cell differentiation. We show that Ifitm2 is rapidly upregulated following T-cell activation, and that IFITM proteins promote Th2 differentiation and inhibit Th1 differentiation in a T-cell intrinsic manner. In the absence of IFITM proteins, the Th2 response is diminished in allergic airway disease, reducing the severity of disease, but deletion of Ifitm3 alone does not reduce disease severity. These findings demonstrate an important role for IFITM proteins in adaptive immunity, in the cell-intrinsic regulation of CD4 + Th differentiation and fate.",

This time-course analysis showed that Ifitm1 was expressed at low levels throughout the time course in all conditions. At the start of the experiment, Ifitm3 was most highly expressed of the three genes, but it was then rapidly downregulated after 4 h in response to the TCR/CD28 stimulus. In contrast, after an initial downregulation, expression of Ifitm2 increased to above resting levels, with highest expression overall in Th1 skewing conditions. Expression of all three Ifitm1-3 genes was lower in the Th2 culture conditions than Th0 and Th1 conditions from 4 h after stimulation onwards, consistent with the fact that they are IFN response genes, and that the Th2 skewing culture conditions include an anti-IFN-\u03b3 mab. Ifitm5 was below detection, whereas Ifitm6 was expressed at very low levels in resting CD4 + T cells and rapidly downregulated after 4 h to below detection levels in all culture conditions. Given the expression patterns of Ifitm2 and Ifitm3 in CD4 + T-cells in response to TCR/CD28 ligation, we tested if the IFITM family are involved in CD4 + T-cell activation in vitro, but on anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, we found no differences in expression of activation markers or in proliferation between WT CD4 + T-cells and IFITM-deficient CD4 + T cells (from mice in which the entire Ifitm gene family had been deleted [IfitmF -/-]) (Supporting Information Fig. 1A-D) .",

The first principal component axis (PC1), which accounted for 52.7% of variability within the dataset, separated the samples by genotype (Fig. 1D) . We then identified genes-ofinterest, by intersecting the 1000 genes that contributed most to PC1 with the 920 DEG ( Fig. 1E ; Supporting Information Table 1 ). This intersection included genes for the costimulatory molecule CD27, which can sensitize na\u00efve T cells to Th1 differentiation through interactions with CD70 on APC, and the transcription factor Stat1, which plays an important role in IFN-\u03b3 signal transduction [16, 17] (Fig. 1E) . Given that Cd27 and Stat1 are both involved in the Th1 response, we examined expression of other genes known to be associated with Th1 or Th2 responses [18] . We found significant increase in expression in the IfitmF -/-CD4 + T cells compared to WT of Th1-associated genes such as Cd84, Cd226, and Cd154 and also Il27ra, which signals for Stat1 activation during early Th1 differentiation [19] [20] [21] , whereas there was no difference in expression levels of the master Th1 transcription factor Tbx21 between genotypes (Fig. 1F) . Interestingly, expression of the Th2-associated genes Il4ra, ICOS, Irf4, and the Th2transcription factor Gata3 were significantly lower in the IfitmF -/cells (Fig. 1F) . Thus, the transcriptome data suggested an overall reduction in expression of Th2-associated genes and a tendency toward increased expression of Th1-associated genes in the IfitmF -/-CD4 + T cells compared to WT (Fig. 1F) .",

We found no significant differences in expression of Stat1, Cd84, or Cd27 between Ifitm3 -/and WT CD4 + T cells purified fresh from the spleen (Fig. 6A) or cultured in skewing conditions after 72 h (Fig. 6B-D) activation of purified naive CD4 + T cells in Th1 skewing conditions, compared to WT counterparts ( Fig. 6E and F) . This experiment together with the gene expression studies suggests that deletion of Ifitm3 alone does not predispose CD4 + T cells to Th1 differentiation. To confirm this in vivo, we induced allergic airways disease by intranasal papain administration, and monitored cell infiltration into the lungs and BAL. There were no significant differences in the numbers of eosinophils, DC, and neutrophils in the BAL and lung. In contrast to the papain-treated IfitmF -/mice, we did, however, find a significant reduction in the number of macrophages in the Ifitm3 -/-BAL and of macrophages and neutrophils in the papain-treated Ifitm3 -/lung compared to WT (Fig. 6G-H) . Finally, there were not significant differences in the number of T cells (Fig. 6I-K) or in the number of CD4 + T1ST2 + cells (Fig. 6L) in BAL, lung, or mLN.

In support of this, we found no impact of Ifitm3 deficiency alone on IFN-\u03b3 production or Th1 differentiation, and on induction of allergic airways disease; there was no significant impact of Ifitm3 deficiency on Th2 effector populations or on eosinophil or mast cell infiltration of the lung.

Interestingly, we detected no difference in Tbx21 (Tbet) transcription in resting CD4 + T cells, but Tbet expression was increased on activation in IfitmF -/-CD4 + T cells compared to WT. As IFITM proteins are transmembrane proteins that are found in intracellular and plasma membranes, the way in which their deletion has such a profound influence on the pattern of transcription is not immediately clear. However, membrane fusion studies have suggested that IFITM proteins block early steps of viral replication by influencing the molecular order of membranes and membrane fluidity [11] . Inter-estingly, plasma membrane lipid order may also be an important factor that influences Th differentiation. High membrane order is related to Th2 differentiation, with higher production of IL-4, whereas intermediate membrane order is present in Th1 cells secreting IFN-\u03b3 [31] .",
