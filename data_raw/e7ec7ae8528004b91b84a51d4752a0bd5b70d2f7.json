[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] These 4 HCoVs also are believed to be derived from zoonotic sources, including bats (NL63, 229E), dromedary camels (299E), or cattle (OC43), although the origins of HKU1 remain uncertain. [11] [12] [13] [14] The 4 HCoVs are linked to common cold symptoms, 9,10,15,16 while HCoV-HKU1 has less definitively been linked to gastrointestinal symptoms. 17, 18 HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 can cause severe diseases, including bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and/or croup among pediatric and adult hospitalized patients. 5, 7, 8, [19] [20] [21] However, due to the relatively mild course of illness in the majority of otherwise healthy individuals, these 4 HCoVs are thought to be underreported. 22 Our current understanding of the epidemiology of HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 outside of clinics is extremely limited. The prevalence, severity, and co-occurrence of HCoVs with other respiratory viruses are not yet established. 4 Data are primarily from outbreak reports, case studies, and clinical studies focusing predominantly on children. 5, 6, 8, 15, 18 Here, we begin to address this gap by estimating the prevalence, shedding duration, symptom progression, and codetection with other respiratory viruses of HCOV-229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 among a cohort of college-aged students.",

The statistically significant decrease in cough, chills, and headache and increase in runny nose over the 6-day period for the HCoV observed in our study suggest that symptoms change significantly over the course of natural infection, making it difficult to delineate between viral etiologies associated with common ARI. The similarity of our findings with those of another study conducted in the region during the same season 24 suggests that university students were under similar regional viral pressure. Due to the low level of severe illness, screening for these viruses in a university setting does not seem necessary. However, it does seem likely that increased testing in the university setting, even among those with mild symptoms, would result in a high number of viruses detected.

For all viruses except influenza A/B, aliquots from the throat and nasal swab were combined prior to testing. Influenza A/B testing was performed separately on throat and nasal swabs, and participants were considered positive for influenza if either swab tested positive. The number of specimens collected per episode ranged from 1 to 3 per set. For each illness episode, participants and each of their social contacts received an incentive of $15 for their first specimen, $20 for their second, and $25 for their third specimen within a collection period. Tests for all respiratory viruses were performed in the laboratory using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Primers and probes were developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and obtained from the Division of Viral Disease, Gastroenteritis, and Respiratory Viruses and the Influenza Division. Additional information about the RT-PCR process and RNA/DNA extraction can be found elsewhere.",

Overall, coviral infection appears to be less commons among university students compared to younger age individuals. More research is needed on adults to determine risk factors for coinfections among relatively healthy individuals with developed immune systems.Human coronavirus-NL63 and rhinovirus had the highest proportion of specimens positive after illness onset. A study examining the viral load of HCoV in children in a daycare setting found an average shedding duration of 6.4 days, with a range of 2.8-10.1 days,30 while a previous rhinovirus challenge study reported patients shedding for at least 4 days, suggesting our findings are not unusual.31 However, unlike challenge studies, we were unable to definitely determine the date of infection or adequately sample among patients without symptoms. As such, the interpretation of symptoms over time and detection of virus over time are different for this community-based study rather than a controlled setting. These findings could influence infection control practices in schools, as well as elsewhere in the community. However, unlike challenge studies, we were unable to definitely determine the precise date of infection or sample every participant without symptoms.
