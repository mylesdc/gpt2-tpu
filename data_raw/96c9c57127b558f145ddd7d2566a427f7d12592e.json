In addition to encoding the amino acid sequence for Gag, the underlying RNA sequence could encode cis-acting elements or nucleotide biases that are necessary for viral replication.

However, the functional relevance of RNA elements and nucleotide biases that promote or repress HIV-1 replication remain poorly understood.",

Codon modification of nucleotides (nt) 22-261 or 22-378 in gag inhibited viral replication by decreasing genomic RNA (gRNA) abundance, gRNA stability, Gag expression, virion production and infectivity. Comparing the effect of these point mutations to deletions of the same region revealed that the mutations inhibited infectious virus production while the deletions did not. This demonstrated that codon modification introduced inhibitory sequences. There is a much lower than expected frequency of CpG dinucleotides in HIV-1 and codon modification introduced a substantial increase in CpG abundance. To determine if they are necessary for inhibition of HIV-1 replication, codons introducing CpG dinucleotides were mutated back to the wild type codon, which restored efficient Gag expression and infectious virion production. To determine if they are sufficient to inhibit viral replication, CpG dinucleotides were inserted into gag in the absence of other changes. The increased CpG dinucleotide content decreased HIV-1 infectivity and viral replication.",

First, it serves as the pre-mRNA that is spliced into over 70 different transcripts [2] [3] [4] . Second, it acts as the mRNA for the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins that comprise the structural and enzymatic proteins, respectively [5, 6] . Third, it is the genome that is packaged into virions and is reverse-transcribed upon infection of a new target cell [7, 8] . The gRNA can be divided into three regions: a 336 nt 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a 219 nt 3\u2032 UTR, and an 8618 nt region that is densely packed with multiple open reading frames (nt lengths reference the HIV-1 NL4-3 strain [9] ). The 5\u2032 UTR contains several cis-acting elements in complex stem-loop structures that regulate multiple stages of the viral life cycle including transcription, splicing, gRNA dimerization, encapsidation and reverse transcription [8, 10] . The central 8618 nt region encodes nine open reading frames: gag, pol, vif, vpr, tat, rev, vpu, env and nef.",

Furthermore, identifying and characterizing evolutionarily conserved cis-acting elements and structures is essential for understanding HIV-1 purifying and positive selection as well as recombination events [11, 12, [21] [22] [23] [24] . Gag consists of four protein domains and two spacer peptides that control virion assembly [25] . Matrix (MA/p17) mediates Gag trafficking to the plasma membrane, capsid (CA/p24) forms the structure of the virion core, nucleocapsid (NC/p7) binds the genomic RNA to mediate encapsidation, and p6 recruits the ESCRT complexes necessary for membrane fission during budding. Within the MA open reading frame, there are a large number of proposed cis-acting RNA elements that could be necessary for viral replication. These include a hnRNPA1 binding site that may regulate gRNA nuclear export [26] , an intronic splice enhancer [27, 28] , an internal ribosome entry site [29] , instability sequences that lead to RNA degradation in the absence of Rev [30] , sequences that base pair with the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , and elements that regulate encapsidation [7, 8] .

For example, the base composition of HIV-1 deviates from that of the human genome. HIV-1 RNA has a high percentage of adenine (A, 36%) and low percentage of cytosine (C, 18%) [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . This nucleotide bias is found in groups M, N and O and is a general property of lentiviruses, though not all retroviruses [36, 38, 42, 44] . Even though HIV-1 has a very high nucleotide substitution rate and sequence diversity, the A-rich bias has been conserved during the HIV-1 pandemic [42] . There are two hypotheses for why this has been maintained in the virus. First, the mutational pattern of reverse transcriptase or antiviral APOBEC3 proteins could impose an A-rich nucleotide bias [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . Second, this bias could be required for viral replication and be under purifying selection [38, 53, 54] .",

We initially focused on this region because of its high content of potential RNA regulatory elements (discussed above). To change the RNA sequence without altering the amino acid sequence, we codon modified this region by introducing large numbers of synonymous mutations. These mutations strongly inhibited viral replication by decreasing gRNA abundance, gRNA stability, Gag expression, virion production and infectivity. We found that CpG dinucleotides introduced during codon modification were necessary and sufficient to attenuate HIV-1 replication. This highlights the functional importance of the suppressed CpG abundance in HIV-1 [36, 40, 44, [55] [56] [57] and shows that increasing the number of CpG dinucleotides in the gRNA inhibits multiple steps of the viral life cycle.",

The mutations were derived from pHDMHgpm2, a codon optimized Gag-Pol construct in which many of the HIV-1 codons are replaced with codons used in highly expressed human mRNAs [59, 68] . In addition, nt 22-165 or 166-261 in gag were codon modified to produce HIV-1 CM22-165 and HIV-1 CM166-216, which have 49 and 31 synonymous mutations, respectively. Virus stocks were prepared by transfecting 293T cells with each proviral DNA construct and the concentration of viral CA/p24 Gag for each stock was measured by ELISA. HIV-1 CM22-261 and HIV-1 CM22-165 had an ~ 65% and ~ 40% decrease in p24 Gag concentration, respectively (Fig. 1b) . To analyze the fitness of each virus, the viral inoculum was normalized so that Jurkat CD4 T cells were challenged with 25 ng of p24 Gag for each virus (Fig. 1c) . The amount of infectious virus in the culture supernatant was monitored over 2 weeks using TZM-bl indicator cells [63] [64] [65] . HIV-1 CM22-261 replicated at a very low but detectable level and at day 12 had > 99.9% less infectivity than wild type virus. HIV-1 CM22-165 replicated slightly better than HIV-1 CM22-261, but was still > 99% lower than wild type HIV-1 at day 12.

Compared with the wild type virus, HIV-1 CM22-261 infectivity was decreased to the limit of detection of the assay (Fig. 2a) , indicating that the virus is attenuated in HeLa cells. Virion production and intracellular Gag expression were decreased ~ 90% (Fig. 2b, c) .

A potential explanation for the decrease in intracellular gRNA abundance is that the mutations in gag could affect intronic splicing silencer (ISS) sequences. If this occurred, gRNA abundance would decrease due to oversplicing but the total amount of HIV-1 RNA would stay the same. To test this, we determined the total intracellular HIV-1 RNA abundance using a primerprobe set upstream of the major 5\u2032 splice donor (SD1). HIV-1 CM22-261 and HIV-1 CM22-165 had an ~ 80 and ~ 60% decrease in total HIV-1 RNA abundance (Additional file 2).

RNA was isolated from the cells immediately before actinomycin D addition (0 h) and then 1, 2, 4 and 6 h thereafter. gRNA abundance at the 0 h timepoint was substantially decreased for HIV-1 CM22-261 and HIV-1 CM22-378 (Fig. 5a) and correlated with the length of codon modified sequence. Since MYC mRNA has a half-life of < 1 h [70] , we used it as a control for RNA stability and analyzed its abundance at each timepoint. As expected, MYC mRNA was rapidly degraded (Fig. 5b) . The gRNA abundance for HIV-1 NL4-3 , HIV-1 CM22-261 and HIV-1 CM22-378 decreased by ~ 20, ~ 35 and ~ 70%, respectively, at the 6 h timepoint relative to its abundance at 0 h (Fig. 5c) .

If the degradation rate is constant, a 50% decrease every 6 h in gRNA abundance for HIV-1 CM22-378 relative to HIV-1 NL4-3 would be compounded to yield a 98.4% decrease after 36 h. This is consistent with the ~ 98% decrease in steady state gRNA for HIV-1 CM22-378 that we observed ~ 45 h post-transfection (Fig. 5a) .

The observed/expected ratio for UpA in the HIV-1 NL4-3 gRNA is 0.92 (Table 1 ) and the total number of UpA dinucleotides in nt 22-261 and 22-378 decreased substantially in the codon modified sequence compared with the wild type sequence ( Table 2 ). This indicates that UpA dinucleotide content is not causing the inhibitory phenotype. The CpG dinucleotide observed/expected ratio is 0.21 in HIV-1 NL4-3 and it is the only dinucleotide substantially suppressed (Table 1) . Within nt 22-261 of gag, wild type HIV-1 has 4 CpG dinucleotides and the codon modified sequence has 22 (Table 2) . Similarly, codon modification of nt 22-378 increased the number of CpGs from 4 to 30. Because CpG dinucleotides are underrepresented in HIV-1 (Table 1) [40, 44, [55] [56] [57] and previous reports have shown that increasing the CpG dinucleotide abundance inhibits picornavirus and influenza virus replication [71] [72] [73] [74] , we hypothesized that the increased number of CpG dinucleotides in HIV-1 CM22-261 and HIV-1 CM22-378 could cause the decrease in HIV-1 infectious virion production.",

In contrast to HIV-1 CM22-261, HIV-1 CM22-261 lowCpG infectivity, Gag expression and virion production was similar to HIV-1 NL4-3 (Fig. 7a, b) . We also cloned pHIV-1 CM22-378 lowCpG , which has four CpG dinucleotides and 79 mutations compared with the 30 CpG dinucleotides and 109 mutations in HIV-1 CM22-378 (Fig. 6, Table 2 ). In a single round infectivity assay, HIV-1 CM22-378 lowCpG also had similar levels of infectivity, intracellular Gag expression and virion production as HIV-1 NL4-3 (Fig. 7c,  d) . While codon modification of nt 22-261 and 22-378 in gag substantially decreased the A-rich nucleotide bias of these regions, eliminating only the CpG dinucleotides in the codon modified sequence did not restore the A-rich bias for HIV-1 CM 22-261 lowCpG and HIV-1 CM22-378 lowCpG ( Table 2 ). This supports the hypothesis that the decrease in infectivity for HIV-1 CM22-261 and HIV-1 CM22-378 is due to the introduced CpG dinucleotides and not changes in the A-rich nucleotide bias. In sum, changing the codons that introduced CpG dinucleotides in nt 22-261 or nt 22-378 back to the wild type HIV-1 codons while maintaining all of the other mutations in these regions restored infectious virus production.",

Upon ligand binding, TLR9 signaling stimulates interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) production, which binds the interferon alpha and beta receptor (IFNAR) and induces interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. To determine whether HeLa cells are responsive to CpG DNA or other TLR ligands, we tested a panel of ligands for TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9 and TLR13 (Additional file 3). As positive controls, HeLa cells were infected with Sendai virus, which activates the cytoplasmic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5 (RIG-I-like receptors, RLR), or were treated with interferon beta (IFN-\u03b2), which also binds IFNAR. Both Sendai virus and IFN-\u03b2 stimulated STAT1 phosphorylation and IFIT1 expression, which is an ISG. CpG DNA did not stimulate STAT1 phosphorylation or IFIT1 expression. The only TLR ligand that stimulated the cells was poly(I:C), which is structurally similar to double stranded RNA and can also signal via RLRs. Therefore, it is unlikely that the additional CpG dinucleotides in HIV-1 CM22-261 and HIV-1 CM22-378 inhibit viral replication via TLR9 or other TLRs in HeLa cells.",

If a protein does directly bind the CpG dinucleotide, its binding site may encompass more than just the CpG and the surrounding nucleotides may affect binding. Therefore, the five nucleotides 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the introduced CpG in HIV-1 CM22-378 and HIV-1 CpG22-378 were used to generate a 12 nt sequence.

When only 11 CpG dinucleotides are inserted into gag in the context of the codon modified sequence (HIV-1 CM22-165), there is a large decrease in infectivity without a substantial loss of gRNA abundance, Gag expression or virion production (Figs. 2, 3) . When 18 or 26 CpG dinucleotides are added (HIV-1 CM22-261 and HIV-1 CM22-378, respectively), the intracellular gRNA stability and abundance is decreased which leads to reduced Gag expression and virion production (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 ). In addition, there is a defect in the pre-integration steps of the viral life cycle that is apparent when equivalent numbers of genomes are used to infect target cells (Fig. 3c) . Thus, manipulating the CpG abundance in gag can impart both producer and target cell defects in replication. Determining whether these deficiencies are underpinned by a common mechanism such as shared host factors, or whether they are distinct from each other, will be an important direction of our future work.",

While a relatively short sequence sufficient for packaging heterologous transcripts into virions has been identified for rous sarcoma virus and murine leukemia virus, delineation of the HIV-1 RNA sequence that is sufficient for packaging has been more controversial [7, 8] . The core packaging signal for HIV-1 is in the 5\u2032 UTR; however, approximately 300 nt of the 5\u2032 end of gag has been proposed to improve viral titre [7, 8] . We did not codon modify the first 21 nt of gag because this region is under purifying selection [11, 12] and NMR structures have shown that it base pairs with the U5 region of the 5\u2032 UTR to form the dimer promoting conformation of the gRNA that is packaged into virions [10, 76] . However, the relative importance of the sequence in gag beyond the first 21 nt for packaging the full-length HIV-1 gRNA, as opposed to heterologous transcripts, is unclear. Mapping Gag binding sites on the gRNA in living cells showed that the RNA elements most frequently crosslinked to Gag were in the 5\u2032 UTR and the RRE [77] . In the context of the full-length virus, our data indicates that nt 22-378 in gag appear to have only a small effect on viral infectivity when this region is deleted or mutated without adding CpG dinucleotides (Figs. 4, 7) . The requirement for this region for gRNA packaging may be different in the context of lentiviral vector genomes, which contain only a small portion of the HIV-1 gRNA [78] .",

However, the translation efficiency of a codon optimized gag mRNA is only ~ 1.6fold higher than wild type gag mRNA that contains theoretically suboptimal codon usage [80] . Our data indicate that gRNA translation efficiency is not substantially affected by the changes in codon usage for HIV-1 CM22-261 since Gag expression (Fig. 2c) and intracellular gRNA abundance (Figs. 3c, 5a) were both decreased by ~ 90%. Changing the RNA sequence could also affect the secondary or tertiary structure of the gRNA. While the amount of RNA structure in the MA region of gag is much lower than that of the 5\u2032 UTR [32] , we cannot exclude that the synonymous mutations in gag have not altered nearby structures. The known structures in the nucleotides that we have mutated are the IRES [29, 53, 81, 82] and the region that base pairs with the 3\u2032 end of the genome [33, 35] . In the context of single cycle infectivity assays in HeLa cells (Fig. 4) and replication in MT4 cells [60] , neither the IRES nor circularization of the HIV-1 gRNA appear to be necessary because the region containing these elements can be deleted. However, it is possible that the phenotype for mutating an RNA structure may not be the same as deleting it [83] and these structures could be necessary under conditions not tested in this study, such as cellular stress or the innate immune response [6] .",

[84] introduced codon pairs into gag or pol that are underrepresented relative to human mRNAs, which strongly inhibited viral replication. However, codon pair bias in RNA viruses has recently been shown to be due CpG and UpA dinucleotide suppression and codon pair deoptimization increases CpG abundance [74, 85] . While not discussed in their study, the synonymous mutations that Martrus et al. introduced increased the number of CpG dinucleotides in gag from 15 to 118. Therefore, we hypothesize that the decrease in viral replication observed in this study is at least partially a result of increasing the CpG frequency instead of codon pair deoptimization. To analyze the role of the A-rich RNA sequence for HIV-1 replication, Keating et al. [54] codon modified regions within gag and pol by increasing the number of C-and G-rich codons, which also inhibited HIV-1 replication. phGag-Pol [86] was used as the source of codon modified sequence and this has a large increase in CpG dinucleotide abundance compared with the wild type sequence. These additional CpG dinucleotides could be responsible for viral attenuation instead of altering the A-rich codon bias. Supporting this hypothesis, Klaver et al. [87] used phylogeny-instructed mutagenesis to increase or decrease the A-rich codon bias in an ~ 500 nt region of pol. In this study, the CpG dinucleotide abundance was decreased by one in the A-Max mutant virus and only increased by four in the A-Min mutant virus. Substantially increasing or decreasing the number of A nucleotides did not affect HIV-1 replication, demonstrating that it is important to avoid introducing suppressed dinucleotides such as CpG in mutagenesis studies analyzing the functional relevance of nucleotide or codon bias.",

            "text": "While CpG dinucleotides appear to be under negative selection in HIV-1 [36, 40, 44, [55] [56] [57] , the specific selection pressure has been unclear. There are at least four potential causes for the suppressed abundance of CpG dinucleotides in HIV-1. First, this could be due to a mutational bias caused by cytosines in a CpG context in the proviral DNA becoming methylated and then undergoing rapid spontaneous deamination. However, we have shown that increasing the abundance of CpG dinucleotides inhibits viral replication, even in a single round assay (Figs. 1, 2, 8, 9 ). Second, CpG methylation-induced transcriptional silencing could inhibit HIV-1 gene expression [36, 40, 44, [55] [56] [57] 88] . However, this cannot cause the inhibition in the single cycle infectivity assays because the transfected proviral plasmids were amplified in bacteria, which does not methylate CpG dinucleotides. Importantly, when an unmethylated plasmid is transfected into mammalian cells, the CpG dinucleotides are not methylated [89] [90] [91] . Third, unmethylated CpGs in the DNA could be recognized by TLR9 [88, 92] . This pattern recognition receptor is expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells [75] and therefore is unlikely to be expressed in HeLa cells. We confirmed that HeLa cells do not induce STAT1 phosphorylation or IFIT1 expression in response to CpG DNA (Additional file 3). In addition, IFN-\u03b1 does not inhibit wild type HIV-1 infectious virus production in HeLa cells at most concentrations (10-1000 U/ml) and only has moderate inhibition at very high concentrations (10,000 U/ml) [93] . Therefore, the inhibition that we observe in response to introducing CpG dinucleotides into HIV-1 is unlikely to be due to the production of type I interferon.",

            "text": "The fourth possibility is that CpG dinucleotides in the viral RNA could induce an antiviral response that restricts HIV-1 replication. The frequency of CpG dinucleotides is suppressed in many RNA viruses that do not have a DNA intermediate [57, 92, [94] [95] [96] , indicating that CpG DNA methylation or activation of TLR9 cannot be responsible for CpG suppression in all viruses. Introduction of CpG dinucleotides into picornaviruses or influenza A virus inhibits viral replication [71] [72] [73] [74] . It is unclear how CpG dinucleotides restrict RNA virus replication but, for the picornavirus echovirus 7, it is not due to stimulating the interferon pathway, PKR, conventional pattern recognition receptors or altering the translation efficiency of viral proteins [71, 74] . It has been hypothesized that there is an innate immune sensor that detects CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA and leads to the inhibition of viral replication, though the molecular details are unknown [71, 73, 74, 85, 92, [97] [98] [99] . We favor the hypothesis that the proposed active restriction pathway targeting CpG dinucleotides in RNA viruses inhibits HIV-1 with an increased CpG abundance. When 26 CpG dinucleotides were added within nt 22-378 of gag (HIV-1 CpG22-378), which is < 5% of the HIV-1 gRNA, viral replication was inhibited in Jurkat cells (Fig. 8 ) and infectivity was decreased by ~ 99% in a single round assay (Fig. 9 ). This indicates that the CpG dinucleotides induce a potent restriction.",

[100] reported that introducing CpG dinucleotides into env inhibited HIV-1 replication by decreasing the abundance of cytoplasmic gRNA, Gag expression, Env expression and infectious virus production. They also demonstrated that depleting the cellular RNA binding protein ZAP rescues replication of HIV-1 with increased CpG abundance and ZAP directly binds HIV-1 RNA regions containing CpG dinucleotides. This indicates that ZAP restricts replication of HIV-1 containing increased CpG abundance, though it is unclear how ZAP promotes viral RNA degradation. Interestingly, we and others have shown that Gag is efficiently expressed from mammalian expression vectors that encode codon-optimized gag or gag-pol cDNAs containing large numbers of CpG dinucleotides [61, 68, 86, 101, 102] . Therefore, it appears that CpG dinucleotides in the context of full length HIV-1 is more deleterious for protein expression than CpGs in the context of mammalian expression vectors. How the specific context of CpG dinucleotides affects ZAP binding to RNA or modulates its activity will be an exciting area of future research.",

Our data shows that introducing CpG dinucleotides into HIV-1 inhibits viral replication by affecting multiple steps of the life cycle. This provides a functional explanation for why CpG dinucleotides are suppressed in HIV-1 and we speculate this dinucleotide is under negative selection to avoid an active restriction system that may require ZAP. Understanding how this restriction system inhibits replication of HIV-1 with increased CpG abundance may provide insight into how other RNA viruses, such as picornaviruses and influenza A virus, are attenuated when CpG dinucleotides are introduced.",
