Our previous study showed that the CD8 + T-cell epitope aa129-aa137 (FVVPILLKA, FA9) of the Hantaan virus (HTNV) nucleoprotein (NP), restricted by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02, induced specific CD8 + T-cell responses that controlled HTNV infection in humans.

Here, based on a detailed structural analysis of the peptide FA9/HLA-A*0201 complex and functional investigations using HLA-A2.1/K b transgenic (Tg) mice, we found that the overall structure of the peptide FA9/HLA-A*0201 complex displayed a typical MHC class I fold with Val2 and Ala9 as primary anchor residues and Val3 and Leu7 as secondary anchor residues that allow peptide FA9 to bind tightly with an HLA-A*0201 molecule. Residues in the middle portion of peptide FA9 extruding out of the binding groove may be the sites that allow for recognition by T-cell receptors. Immunization with peptide FA9 in HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice induced FA9-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses characterized by the induction of high expression levels of interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, granzyme B, and CD107a. In an HTNV challenge trial, significant reductions in the levels of both the antigens and the HTNV RNA loads were observed in the liver, spleen, and kidneys of Tg mice pre-vaccinated with peptide FA9. Thus, our findings highlight the ability of HTNV epitope-specific CD8 + T-cell immunity to control HTNV and support the possibility that the HTNV-NP FA9 peptide, naturally processed in vivo in an HLA-A*02-restriction manner, may be a good candidate for the development HTNV peptide vaccines.",

            "text": "August 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 298 inTrODUcTiOn As widespread emerging zoonotic pathogens, hantaviruses, which belong to the Bunyaviridae family, have significant and growing impacts on global public health (1) . Murine-borne hantavirus transmissions cause more than 200,000 cases annually of human disease worldwide and a significant portion of the world's population is at risk of being infected (2) . Some hantaviruses, such as the Hantaan virus (HTNV) in Asia, the Dobrava virus and Puumala virus (PUUV) in Europe, and the Seoul virus worldwide, can lead to hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans, and other hantaviruses, such as the Sin Nombre virus (SNV) and the Andes virus (ANDV) in North and South America directly cause human hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) (3) (4) (5) . Infection by any of the serotypes can lead to a broad spectrum of outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute fever and hemorrhage, and even life-threatening shock and acute kidney or lung injury (6) . In China, a total of 1,625,002 HFRS cases and 46,968 deaths were reported during the years of 1950-2014 with a case-fatality rate as high as 15% (6) . Over 90% of the total global HFRS cases that arose in China were caused by infection with the HTNV strain, the prototype member of the hantavirus family (7) (8) (9) . In the U.S., based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, the total HPS cases from the years of 1993-2015 reached 659, with a higher case-fatality rate of ~36%, thereby raising the concern of the World Health Organization. This situation is further exacerbated by the periodic emergence of novel species of hantaviruses, leading to a disruption of the healthcare systems in epidemic areas and a major health concern worldwide (10-12). Although some live attenuated or inactive vaccines have been used in some parts of the world and have partially prevented hantaviruses infections, there remains an urgent need for more effective therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines to better control the epidemic situation (13, 14) . The negative-sense RNA genome encoding two structure proteins, nucleocapsid protein (NP) and envelope glycoprotein, give rise to the primary antigenicity of HTNV. The HTNV-NP has been demonstrated as highly immunogenic and conservative, responsible for vigorous cellular and humoral immune responses (15) , and the heterodimers of mature HTNV glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, are considered the main sources of neutralizing antibody production in humans (16) . It has been suggested that the immunological mechanisms for viral clearance are related closely with T-cell-mediated immune responses. This notion is supported by evidence that hantavirus-specific T cells play a critical role in the control of virus infection (17) (18) (19) . Our previous results have demonstrated that the T-cell response during the acute stage of HFRS in patients is characterized by vigorous cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses and multifunctional T helper (Th) cell responses against HTNV infection (20, 21) . Patients with milder severities of HFRS typically mount vigorous HTNV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses directed against the epitopes of HTNV, whereas patients with severe or critical HFRS tend to have weak and narrowly focused T-cell responses (20) (21) (22) . Moreover, we also reported that CD8 + T cells specific to the immunodominant epitope of HTNV-NP, the aa129-aa137 epitope (FVVPILLKA, FA9), was restricted by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02 and displayed polyfunctional activity, including cytotoxic activity, the ability to proliferate, and the ability to produce the effector cytokines. The finding of the negative correlation between HTNV-NP FA9 epitope-primed CD8 + T-cell responses and disease severity suggests at least partial control of HTNV infection in HFRS patients (21) .",

The HLA-A*02-restricted HTNV-NP epitope FA9 that we previously identified was not only the immunodominant epitope but also a highly conserved epitope with 67-100% concordance among hantaviruses compared to the sequences of with other serotypes (21) . To study the response induced by HLA-A*02-restricted HTNV-NP epitopes, we have previously used peptide-HLA (pHLA)-pentamers to detect the frequencies of HTNV-NP epitope-specific CD8 + T cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HLA-A*02-positive HFRS patients (21) . Because encounters between T-cell receptors (TCRs) and pHLA appear to be a key factor for the immunogenic potential of CD8 + T-cell responses, structural studies examining the pHLA should be highly relevant in understanding the cellular immune response to HTNV infection. X-ray crystal structures could reveal the structure of the closed conformation of the peptide/HLA complex (23) (24) (25) (26) . However, very few crystal structures demonstrating the interaction between HTNV epitopes and HLA molecules have been analyzed to date.",

The peptides in vivo may mimic the epitopes that are presented and restricted the MHC to target cells, thus inducing relevant immune responses. Therefore, the development of peptide vaccines may be a better method to specifically direct the cellular immune system against pathogens. Given to the critical roles of the HTNV-NP FA9 epitope, which can induce protective CD8 + T-cell responses, such epitopes may be appealing targets for peptide vaccine development.

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The T2 cell-binding assay was performed as described elsewhere to determine the binding capability of synthetic peptides to HLA-A*0201 molecules (33) . Briefly, T2 cells were incubated with 50 \u03bcmol/l peptide, and 1 \u03bcmol/l human \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22m, Sigma) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 18 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The expression of HLA-A*0201 by the T2 cells was then determined by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-HLA-A2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) BB7.2 (Biolegend) and detected by flow cytometry (FACScan; BD Biosciences). The results are presented as the fluorescent index (FI), which was determined as follows: FI = (mean PE fluorescence with the given peptide \u2212 mean PE fluorescence without peptide)/(mean PE fluorescence without peptide). FI \u2265 1 represents high-affinity peptides (34) , indicating that the peptide stably combined with HLA-A*0201 molecules on the surface of T2 cells to increase the mean fluorescence of the HLA-A*0201 molecules by at least onefold.",

To further investigate the binding affinity of peptide FA9 to an HLA-A*02 molecule, a T2 cell-peptidebinding assay was conducted. The synthesized peptide FA9 increased the surface expression of HLA-A*0201 molecules, corresponding to a FI value of 2.77, indicating that peptide FA9 had a high affinity for binding with HLA-A*0201 molecules, whereas the HLA-B*35-restricted peptide aa131-aa139 (VPILLKALY, VY9) on HTNV-NP used as a negative control showed an FI of 0.14, indicating no binding with HLA-A*0201 ( Figure 1A) . Moreover, the HLA-A*0201 complex refolding assay showed that the predicted molecular weight of the protein coming out with ~15.9 ml eluting buffer would be 45 kDa, coincident with the molecular mass of the pHLA complex ( Figure 1B and Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). Therefore, the results suggest that To further confirm that the HTNV-NP FA9 peptide is a typical HLA-A*02-restricted epitope, the crystal structure of peptide FA9 bound to HLA-A*0201 was further analyzed. Crystal trials were carried out with the purified heterodimer of the heavy chain and \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22m) expressed in E. coli, and the synthesized cognate peptide was refolded. The diffracting crystals of pHLA were then obtained ( Figure S2 in Supplementary Material). As expected, the overall three-dimensional structure and domain arrangements of the FA9/HLA-A*0201 complex showed a typical MHC class I fold, which was exactly similar to those of the formerly determined peptide/HLA-A*0201 molecules (Figure 2A) . Specifically, the antiparallel \u03b11 and \u03b12 helices in the extracellular region of the HLA-A*0201 heavy chain formed the antigenic peptide-binding groove, which was supported by an eightstranded \u03b2-sheet bedplate. The \u03b13 domain and \u03b22m occupied the standard positions below the bedplate (Figure 2A) . Compared with the previously determined HLA-A*0201 complexed with peptide GV9 (GLMWLSYFV, PDB code: 3I6G), the structural superposition of FA9/HLA-A*0201 was similar to that of GV9/ HLA-A*0201 with a low root mean square difference (RMSD) of 0.415 \u00c5. The amino acid sequence alignments revealed that the main chain conformation of FA9 is quite similar to GV9 (Figures 2B,C) . Specifically, the residues Val2 and Ala9 act as primary anchor residues of peptide FA9, which perform the same conformation as Leu2 and Val9 of peptide GV9. The residue Val at position 2 from the N-terminus and the residue Ala9 at the C-terminal of peptide FA9 were deeply buried in the pocket, indicating typical anchor residues ( Figure 2C) . Of particular interest were the residues Val3 and Leu7, which point their side chains into the pocket and might act as secondary anchor residues for peptide FA9 to bind with HLA-A*0201. However, Met3 and Ser6 might be the secondary anchors for the peptide GV9 ( Figure 2C) .",

All of these anchor residues help the peptide tightly bind with the HLA-A*0201 heavy chain and enhance the stability of the entire complex. It is also important to note that the centrally located residues on the main chain of peptide FA9 tended to protrude out of the antigen-binding groove. The side chains of Phe1, Pro4, Ile5, Leu6, and Lys8 are the most exposed residues pointing upwards from the HLA-A*0201 surface, indicating that these amino acids are the most probable recognition sites for TCRs and might be involved in TCR docking ( Figure 2C) . The mutants in these positions may influence the antigenicity of the peptide and even lead to the immune escape of the virus. The further unambiguous electron density of the complex was observed for the bound peptide FA9, which was well defined inside the peptide-binding groove of HLA-A*0201 ( Figure 2D) . The structural properties of the FA9/HLA-A*0201 complex may be related to the immunogenicity of the epitope that allow it to induce specific immune response to against HTNV infection.",

Groups of HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice were immunized or injected with peptide HTNV-NP FA9, peptide HTNV-NP VY9, the HTNV inactivated vaccine, or PBS, as described in Section \"Materials and Methods. \" After three rounds of in vivo stimulation, splenocytes from primed mice were first tested for IFN-\u03b3 production via an ELISPOT assay with peptide FA9 as the stimulator. The results showed that a large number of CD8 + T cells from Tg mice inoculated with peptide FA9 demonstrated strong IFN-\u03b3 production with a median magnitude of 151 (range, 104-255) SFC/10 6 splenocytes, which is even higher than the IFN-\u03b3 secretion level detected in the positive control group injected with the HTNV inactivated vaccine (median: 123, range: 89-152 SFC/10 6 splenocytes), although the difference was not statistically significant. By contrast, no specific CD8 + T-cell reactivity was detected in the splenocytes generated from Tg mice injected with PBS (median: 18, range: 14-26 SFC/10 6 splenocytes) (Figure 3 ). More importantly, although immunization with the FA9 peptide in Tg mice efficiently elicited FA9-specific CD8 + T-cell responses, the HLA-B*35-restricted HTNV-NP VY9 peptide used as an uncorrelated peptide control was unable to prime or very inefficiently primed obvious CD8 + T-cell responses in the Tg mice, with a median value of 28 (range, 15-55) SFC/10 6 splenocytes for IFN-\u03b3 production (Figure 3) . Notably, compared to Tg mice injected with PBS, the SFC count, as an index of the CD8 + T-cell reactivity, increased by approximately eightfold in the FA9 peptide-immunized mice (p = 0.021) (Figure 3) .",

Further analysis revealed that the CD8 + T cells displayed adequate cytolytic capacity and appeared to be highly functional, secreting cytolytic effector granzyme B (median: 10.45%, range: 8.48-11.30% of CD8 + T cells) and upregulating CD107a expression (median: 10.85%, range: 6.80-15.20% of CD8 + T cells) after stimulation with the FA9 peptide ( Figure 4B) . Interestingly, similar to what has been observed in ex vivo comparisons of IFN-\u03b3 production, CD8 + T cells from the FA9-immunized mice displayed a trend toward higher levels of cytokines production and cytolytic mediator expression than the secretion of CD8 + T cells from other control groups. As shown in Figure 4B , the Tg mice injected with PBS used as a negative control had few or no detectable cells that expressed cytokines or cytolytic mediators, and the frequencies of cells expressing cytokines or cytolytic mediators were all significantly lower than the frequencies induced in the FA9-immunized group (p = 0.001 for IFN-\u03b3, p = 0.005 for TNF-\u03b1, p < 0.001 for granzyme B and p = 0.014 for CD107a). The percentages of IFN-\u03b3 (median: 7.67%, range: 5.88-8.70% of CD8 + T cells), TNF-\u03b1 (median: 6.09%, range: 5.89-6.61% of CD8 + T cells), and granzyme B (median: 6.81%, range: 5.59-7.26% of CD8 + T cells)-producing CD8 + T cells in the positive control group inoculated with the HTNV inactivated vaccine were slightly lower than the frequencies of the FA9 stimulation group, although this difference was not significant. However, a higher frequency of CD107a expression was observed in the CD8 + T cells from Tg mice immunized with peptide FA9 than in those of mice immunized with the HTNVinactivated vaccine (median: 4.99%, range: 3.83-5.95% of CD8 + T cells, p = 0.041). Importantly, compared with the substantially higher frequencies of cytokine secretion and cytolytic mediator expression by specific CD8 + T cells in the peptide FA9-immunized Tg mice, the Tg mice inoculated with the HLA-B*35-restricted VY9 peptide showed much less IFN-\u03b3 (median: 2.21%, range: 1.75-3.11% of CD8 + T cells, p = 0.002), TNF-\u03b1 (median: 1.40%, range: 0.59-3.11% of CD8 + T cells, p = 0.004), and granzyme B (median: 2.79%, range: 1.08-3.50% of CD8 + T cells, p < 0.001) production and CD107a expression (median: 2.62%, range: 1.42-2.85% of CD8 + T cells, p = 0.016), further confirming the specificity of the HLA-peptide interaction for inducing effective T-cell responses. Given that granzyme B release is considered a quantitative indicator of the cytotoxic activity of T cells, these observations indicated that FA9-specific CTLs with significant upregulation of granzyme B and CD107a expression might possess the cytotoxic capacity to directly kill HTNV-infected cells.",

For this purpose, we established a model of HTNV infection based on replication of the virus in vivo in HLA-A2.1/ K b Tg mice. The Tg mice were grouped and immunized as before and subsequently challenged by the administration of the HTNV strain 10 days after immunization.

The preliminary measurement of the viremia in six organs of the HTNV-infected na\u00efve Tg mice showed that high levels of HTNV antigens could be detected in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, but not in lungs, cerebrum, and heart of the Tg mice, suggesting that the liver, spleen, and kidneys are the major organs for infection and replication of HTNV in HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice ( Figure  S3 in Supplementary Material).

However, we detected significant differences in the HTNV RNA loads between the Tg mice that received peptide FA9 inoculation and the mice immunized with the control peptide or injected with PBS. In accordance with the results of the HTNV antigen detection, significantly lower levels of HTNV RNA loads were observed in the liver, spleen, and kidneys of the Tg mice after immunization with the FA9 peptide than in those of the negative control mice (p < 0.001 for liver, p = 0.007 for spleen, and p < 0.001 for kidneys, Figure 6A ). The mice immunized with the irrelevant control peptide HTNV-NP VY9 showed markedly higher levels of HTNV RNA loads in the liver and spleen than the FA9-immunized mice (p < 0.001 for liver and p = 0.010 for spleen, Figure 6A ), whereas no significant difference was observed for HTNV RNA loads in the kidneys between the VY9 peptide-treated mice and the FA9-immunized mice (Figure 6A) , although the inhibitory tendency of the HTNV RNA loads in the FA9 peptide immunization group was still observed in the kidneys. Notably, when the capacity of FA9 peptide immunization to reduce the HTNV RNA loads was compared among different organs of the Tg mice, the HTNV RNA loads in liver were lower than those in the spleen (p = 0.029) or kidneys (p = 0.018) (Figure 6B) , indicating that there may be tissue specificity of the peptide FA9-induced CD8 + T-cell responses for inhibiting HTNV replication. Together, these data clearly suggest that the inhibition of HTNV replication in the liver, spleen, and kidneys of Tg mice can be mediated by FA9-specific CD8 + T-cell responses, which The HLA-A2.1/K b transgenic mice were divided into four groups (n = 6 each), including the mice immunized with HLA-A*02-restricted HTNV-NP peptide FA9 (aa129-aa137, FVVPILLKA), HLA-B*35-restricted HTNV-NP peptide VY9 (aa131-aa139, VPILLKALY), HTNV vaccine or PBS, respectively.

A peptide vaccine with greater efficacy against pathogens would bring about a major improvement in protection of the population against infection (38) (39) (40) . Our previous findings that the T-cell response was an important component of naturally acquired immunity to control HTNV infection provide the foundation for the development of HTNV peptide vaccines that may combat HTNV by efficiently inducing specific T-cell immunities. In this study, we reported that the HTNV-NP FA9 peptide could be an immunogenic epitope, which was determined based on its binding with HLA-A*0201 molecules and its in vivo functional validation. We further provided evidence that immunization with peptide FA9 in HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice successfully generated reactive CD8 + T cell responses that inhibited HTNV infection after HTNV challenge, suggesting that peptide FA9 may be a good candidate for use in the design of HTNV peptide vaccines. Inactivated vaccines for HTNV in Asia have been proved to boost the humoral responses; however, the titers of HTNVspecific neutralizing antibodies are not sufficiently high in some populations and, therefore, are not expected to be able to effectually limit HTNV amplification and completely prevent infection (13, 14, 41, 42) . As such, there is a concerted drive to develop peptide vaccines that can efficaciously induce HTNVdirected T-cell immunity. Previous evidence has illustrated the feasibility, safety, and immunogenicity of the peptide vaccine (43, 44) . However, due to MHC restrictions and low immunogenicity, the broad applicability of peptide vaccines for diseases may be currently limited. Several studies on various clinical applications of peptide vaccines have suggested that many potential variables, such as the type and length of peptides, the loading of one or multiple peptides on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or the route of administration may attribute to the design efficiency of peptide vaccines (25, 39, 40) . Selecting the right epitope is the first crucial step in the design of an effective vaccine.",

Our findings also showed that the HTNV-NP FA9 epitope could prime specific CD8 + T-cell responses in HLA-A*02 HFRS patients. Intriguingly, patients with higher levels of CD8 + T-cell responses to the FA9 epitope maintained mild or moderate HFRS severity (21) . Notably, HLA-A*02 allelerestricted epitopes are suggested for further studies because of their potential immunogenicity in Chinese Han populations where HLA-A*02 alleles predominate as high as 29.70% (27, 28) . Hence, in this study, we selected the HTNV-NP FA9 peptide for further evaluation of its potential immunogenicity to be used as a candidate for peptide vaccine designs.",

The high quality of the overall structure of the pHLA complex allowed for a detailed discussion of the FA9-HLA-A*0201 binding characteristics. The crystal structure analysis offered the opportunity to determine whether the binding sites between FA9 and HLA-A*0201 interact with one another, thereafter evaluating the binding affinity of the peptide FA9 to HLA-A*0201 molecules. In general, the peptides among MHC class I molecules are usually considered to be 8-10 aas long and contain anchor residues for the preferred MHC allele. The exact localization of the anchor residues of the peptide relies on each specific MHC allele. Whether these anchor residues can stably interact with MHC allele-specific pockets is a key determinant in evaluating the affinity of a peptide-MHC (pMHC) molecule (47, 48) . In particular, the residue in position 2 from the N termini and the residue on the C termini are the known primary anchor positions for binding of the 9-mer peptides to HLA-A*02 molecules, and the residues at positions 3 and 6 are common secondary anchors in some peptide/HLA-A*02 complexes (49) (50) (51) . To provide a more accurate analysis of the pHLA, a template GV9 peptide taken directly from the co-crystallized X-ray structure (PDB code 3I6G) was used in our homology structure modeling for the viral pHLA complexes. Our results revealed that the general conformation and position of FA9 within the peptide-binding groove of HLA-A*0201were similar to the structure observed in GV9/HLA-A*0201, and peptide FA9 contains an optimal HLA-A*02-binding motif, that is, Val at the P2 anchor position and Ala at the C-terminal P9 anchor position. However, peptide FA9 bound with HLA-A*0201 molecules via residue Val in position 3 and Leu in position 7 as secondary anchor residues, which appeared to be the eminent feature of peptide FA9. Despite these observed structural differences between the two peptides at the binding sites, the side chain of the P3 residue, occupying identical positions in both the FA9 and GV9 complex, act as the same secondary anchor residues. Thus, peptide FA9 fits well into the binding groove formed at the interface of the pHLA. The stable interaction of peptide FA9 anchor residues with HLA-A*0201 molecules could improve the binding affinity of the complex, which may affect the immunodominance of peptide-specific CTL responses.",

Here, we reported that in the middle portion of peptide FA9, the residues Phe1, Pro4, Ile5, Leu6, and Lys8 extruding out of the MHC binding groove may predominantly contribute in interactions with TCR, indicating that the FA9/HLA-A*0201 complex may have ordinary properties as a cell-surface ligand for recognition by T cells. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for TCR and pMHC recognition and binding (56) (57) (58) . Because the peptide needs to be presented on the viral-infected cells by MHC molecules at sufficient expression levels to further form stable synapses between the antigen-presenting cells and the effector T cells (59) , high TCR to pMHC affinity appears to be a decisive factor for the T-cell immunogenic potential and necessary for specific T cells to completely clear the viruses. In published studies, the kinetic release rate of TCRs from pMHC complexes was found to be most often correlated with T-cell activation (60, 61) . The FA9/HLA-A*0201 complex structure determined here implied that the major contacts between TCRs and peptides might be the central hydrophobic residues of the viral peptide. Thus, we speculated that the strong antiviral efficacy of the CTL response induced by FA9 might be primarily derived from the favorable hydrophobic interplay between the central peptide residues and the corresponding hydrophobic residues in the complementary-determining region (CDR) loops of TCRs. However, given that TCR-peptide recognition is mainly determined by the highly flexible and variable CDR loops of TCRs, the TCR-pMHC complex cannot be easily extrapolated (24) . Therefore, the definite structure and the affinity for peptide FA9-specific \u03b1\u03b2TCRs to interact with pHLA complexes have not been fully elucidated, which requires further studies in the future.",

            "text": "It is also noteworthy that functional validation should be performed to ultimately determine immunogenic T-cell epitopes. These structural analyses were then further validated by examining the immunogenicity and antiviral efficacy of peptide FA9 in HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice. It is important to note that peptides that elicit effective CTL responses must first successfully to be presented by MHC class I molecules. The peptides administered to the mice mimicked the epitopes present on the target cells when associated with the restricting MHC molecule and are, thus, capable of inducing relevant immune responses (25) . In the present study, vaccination with the HLA-A*02-restricted HTNV-NP FA9 peptide induced FA9-specific CD8 + T-cell responses in HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice, whereas HLA-B*35-restricted HTNV-NP VY9 peptide vaccination generated relatively poor overall reactivity. In an HTNV challenge trial, there was a significant reduction in both the HTNV antigen level and RNA loads of HTNV in the HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice vaccinated with the HTNV-NP FA9 peptide compared to unvaccinated Tg mice and compared to the HLA-B*35-restricted VY9 peptide-vaccinated group. These findings indicated that the responses could be inferred as due to the presence of FA9-specific CTLs, which could be proposed to be evidence for natural recognition of the FA9 peptide in vivo. Moreover, by examining and comparing the responses to the HLA-A*02-restricted FA9 and HLA-B*35-restricted VY9 peptide in Tg mice, we identified that peptide FA9 could be processed and presented through the classical HLA-A*02-restricted manner, which further primed and boosted specific CTL responses to control HTNV infection in vivo. These results are important for the selection of antigenic targets that can be applied in vaccine design to induce protective CD8 + T-cell responses. In addition, compared to the external glycoproteins of HTNV, the conservation of the HTNV-NP antigen among different subtypes derived from hantaviruses is generally high (21) . Thus, HTNV-NP FA9 epitope that was highly immunogenic in humans might also be a potent immunogen capable of inducing CD8 + T-cell responses against HTNV infection in Tg mice, combined with its high conservation, making it an ideal candidate for the development of novel peptide vaccines.",

To further characterize the cellular immune responses specific to HTNV-NP FA9 peptides, additional cytokines and cytotoxic mediators were tested in the splenocytes of immunized Tg mice after ex vivo stimulation with the FA9 peptide. In consistent with the data obtained in the ELISPOT assay, immunization with FA9 induced a high percentage of IFN-\u03b3 production in the CD8 + T cells. TNF-\u03b1 is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by many types of immunocytes that can enhance Th1 responses, promote CTL activation, and drive antiviral immunity (62) . In mice immunized with peptide FA9, an increase in TNF-\u03b1 expression was observed, as expected. The secretion of granzyme B and the expression of CD107a, which is primarily induced by activated CTLs (63), were also observed to a higher extent in FA9-immunized Tg mice, suggesting that HTNV-NP FA9 peptide-specific CD8 + T cells owned a strong cytolytic capacity against HTNV infection. The rapid production of IFN-\u03b3 or granules by T cells is important in the defense against HTNV infections. Similar results were observed in Tg mice using HTNV-inactivated vaccine immunization, in which case the percentages of cytokine-or cytotoxic mediatorproducing CD8 + T cells were significantly higher, whereas peptide VY9-immunized Tg mice had few or no detectable cells expressing cytokines, indicating that the 9-mer peptide presentation requires the matched context of HLA class I molecule.",

In the HTNV challenge experiments, peptide FA9 was as protective as HTNV inactive vaccines, and a similar level of CD8 + T-cell responses were observed following both vaccination regimens, suggesting that peptide FA9-primed immune protection is achievable in this mice model. However, there may be some disadvantages of this Tg mouse model for HTNV challenge, as mice are considered a natural reservoir for HTNV but do not develop the disease or symptoms (66) . Therefore, we could not evaluate the antivirus effect of the peptide FA9induced CTL response via a reduction or elimination of disease symptoms. The parameters selected to assess protection were measurements of viral loads in the major organs of the Tg mice. Quantification of HTNV S gene expression encoding the NP with real-time RT-PCR and detection of the HTNV antigen via ELISA in the organs of the mice following HTNV challenge have been shown to be good methods for evaluating HTNV viral loads in mice (67) . Based on the peak of virus replication, we chose 3 days post-challenge for detection. Our results indicated that immunization of the HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice with peptide FA9 followed by HTNV challenge inhibited HTNV replication and enhanced the clearance of HTNV from the liver, spleen, and kidneys of the mice. In the same Tg mice group immunized with peptide FA9, further comparisons showed that the HTNV RNA load in the liver was slightly lower than that in the spleen and kidneys, which was in accordance with the results found in the Tg mice injected with PBS, indicating that even without preimmunization, the HTNV infection may vary among tissues in Tg mice. In fact, different expressions of tissue-selective homing lymphocyte receptors at the site of antigen exposure and different tissue-specific APCs may lead to different outcomes in the induction of T cells and the impact on sequential antigenspecific responses (68, 69) .",

As far as we know, this is the first report of the crystal structure of the HTNV-NP CTL epitope upon interaction with HLA molecules, through which we confirmed that the HTNV-NP FA9 peptide was a highly immunogenic epitope restricted by HLA-A*02. By challenging HLA-A2.1/K b Tg mice with HTNV in vivo, we revealed the in vivo immunogenicity of the HTNV-NP peptide FA9 and the antiviral efficiency of FA9-specific CTL responses. The important findings presented here indicated that the HTNV-NP FA9 peptide has high efficacy and immunogenicity for inducing protective immunity and can be used in regimens for further peptide vaccine designs. These observations provide further structural and functional insights regarding T-cell-mediated antiviral immunity in HTNV infection, which may have important implications for both HFRS immunotherapy and HTNV peptide vaccine development. However, the relationship between the TCR-FA9/HLA-A*02 binding and the function of FA9 peptide-specific CTLs is unknown. In follow-up studies, the binding affinity of FA9/ HLA-A*02 to specific TCRs should be measured to determine how TCRs interact with their cognate pHLAs to active T cells and induce CTL responses.",

The antigenic peptide-binding groove was constituted by antiparallel \u03b11 and \u03b12 helices in the extracellular region of the HLA-A*0201 heavy chain, and supported by an eight-stranded \u03b2-sheet bedplate.

The mainchain conformation of FA9 is similar to GV9. The residues Val2 and Ala9 (red arrows) act as the primary anchor residues of FA9, which exhibit the same conformations as Leu2 and Val9 of GV9. The residues Val3 and Leu7 (green arrows) act as secondary anchor residues for peptide FA9, whereas the residues Met3 and Ser6 might be the secondary anchors for the peptide GV9. The residues Phe1, Pro4, Ile5, Leu6, and Lys8 (blue arrows) of peptide FA9 pointing upwards from the HLA-A*0201 surface are the most probable recognition sites for TCRs.
