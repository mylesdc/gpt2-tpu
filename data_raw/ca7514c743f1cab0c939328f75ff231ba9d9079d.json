            "text": "For over 30 years, HIV/AIDS has wreaked havoc in the world. In the absence of an effective vaccine for HIV, development of new anti-HIV agents is urgently needed. We previously identified the antiviral activities of the scorpion-venom-peptidederived mucroporin-M1 for three RNA viruses (measles viruses, SARS-CoV, and H5N1). In this investigation, a panel of scorpion venom peptides and their derivatives were designed and chosen for assessment of their anti-HIV activities. A new scorpion venom peptide derivative Kn2-7 was identified as the most potent anti-HIV-1 peptide by screening assays with an EC 50 value of 2.76 mg/ml (1.65 mM) and showed low cytotoxicity to host cells with a selective index (SI) of 13.93. Kn2-7 could inhibit all members of a standard reference panel of HIV-1 subtype B pseudotyped virus (PV) with CCR5-tropic and CXCR4tropic NL4-3 PV strain. Furthermore, it also inhibited a CXCR4-tropic replication-competent strain of HIV-1 subtype B virus. Binding assay of Kn2-7 to HIV-1 PV by Octet Red system suggested the anti-HIV-1 activity was correlated with a direct interaction between Kn2-7 and HIV-1 envelope. These results demonstrated that peptide Kn2-7 could inhibit HIV-1 by direct interaction with viral particle and may become a promising candidate compound for further development of microbicide against HIV-1.",

Unfortunately, there are still no effective vaccine or other countermeasure to eliminate HIV transmission [2] . The Merck STEP [3] and the Thai RV144 HIV vaccine [4] trials confirmed that we still have a long way to go before developing a prophylactic HIV vaccine. Meanwhile, HIV virus spreads fast and the HIV/AIDS pandemic still stands as a serious public health problem worldwide [1] . Current situation clearly indicates the necessity of developing new anti-HIV agents which can be used for prevention of HIV/AIDS dissemination.",

It has been suggested that R5 is the major co-receptor involved in sexual transmission of HIV-1 [6] . Some microbicides tested can indeed inhibit infection by X4-tropic HIV-1 but insufficiently inhibit R5-tropic HIV-1 to the same extent [9, 10] . SPL7013 is a dendrimer which had HIV-1 virucidal activity against X4 and R5X4 HIV-1 strains but not R5 virus strains [10] . Effectiveness, safety and broad spectrum are very important to an anti-HIV microbicide. The chemokine analogue PSC-RANTES had strong inhibition activity at R5-tropic HIV strains but might induce local inflammation [11] . The sulfonated polymer PRO2000 is safe but cannot provide efficacious protection against sexual HIV transmission [12] . Polyanioun had been suggested as potential microbicides [13, 14, 15] . Unfortunately, a recent phase III trial of cellulose sulfate was terminated because of its increasing rate of HIV infection than women using a placebo [16] . Therefore, more sources of antiviral reagent to prevent HIV-1 transmission are needed for efficient protection of our body from HIV infection.",

So far, more than 1700 AMPs of different origins have been identified or predicted [19] . Most AMPs maintain certain common features such as being small (10-50 amino acids), containing positive charge of 2 to 9 and an amphipathic structure [20, 21, 22, 23] . Scorpion venom is a cocktail of peptides and proteins with diverse bioactivities, which represent a tremendous potential for use in drug design and development [24, 25, 26] . AMPs from scorpion venom such as hadrurin [27] , scorpine [28] , opistoporins, parabutoporin [29] , ISCTs [30] and mucroporin [31] are paid more and more attention due to their biological activity [31, 32] .

Another scorpion peptide BmKn2 which was cloned from the venom of Mesobuthus martensii Karsch had also showed a strong antimicrobial activity against bacteria [39] . As a further development of BmKn2 peptide, a new peptide named Kn2-7 was designed by substituting Glycine Alanine and Serine with Lysine or Arginine (G3K, A4R, and S10R) to enhance the net positive charge and a-helix structure. In this study, five scorpion venom peptides and their derivatives were screened for their anti-HIV-1 activities, and the results showed that three of them (mocroporin-M1, BmKn2 and Kn2-7) exhibited potent anti-HIV-1 activity, in which Kn2-7 showed the highest level of anti-HIV-1 activity. So, we speculated that Kn2-7 might be a potential lead peptide and was tested for antiviral effects by using a standard reference panel of subtype B HIV-1 pseudotyped virus (PV) and a replication-competent strain of HIV-1 virus. The binding assay of Kn2-7 to HIV-1 PV was performed for exploring the related antiviral mechanism by Octet Red system.",

Supernatant and cell samples were collected at day 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. P24 antigen expression was analyzed by ELISA and infectivity was further detected by TZM-bl detection system. 10 mg/ml and 15 mg/ml of Kn2-7 suppressed p24 expression completely from 7 th day to 17 th day in infected cell ( Fig. 6A ) as well as in supernatant (Fig. 6B ). 5 mg/ml of Kn2-7 suppressed p24 expression in cell sample in early stage (7 th day to 14 th day), but not in the later time points, with the value of p24 rose at 15 th day, till to 17 th day (Fig. 6A) . The p24 antigen level in supernatants showed the same trend as that of cell samples by 5 mg/ml of Kn2-7, but with a delayed reaction (Fig. 6B) . The negative control peptide, mucroporin-S1, did not show any inhibitory effect. To further determine antiviral activity of Kn2-7, the above samples was added to TZM-bl cells for detection of their infectivity. Luciferase activities of infected TZMbl cells were measured after 48 h incubation. Similar trends of inhibitory effect were observed (Fig. 6C) .

The results further demonstrated that the Kn2-7 can inhibit HIV infectivity and its consequent replication. To rule out potential inhibitions attributable to cytotoxicity to host cells, the cytotoxicity of the peptides on CEM6174 cells were measured by using the MTS assay from 5 mg/ml to 100 mg/ml and the CC 50 value of Kn2-7 on CEM6174 cells was 43.18 mg/ml, which shown that the antiviral activity of Kn2-7 against HIV-1 does not result from the cytotoxicity of the peptide on CEM6174 cells.",

Although the number of new infections has been falling, levels of new infections overall are still high. The vast majority of people newly infected with HIV are infected during unprotected sexual intercourse [42] . The quest for effective microbicide and drug to prevent initial HIV-1 infection and treat AIDS patients is essential for countering the spread of the diseases worldwide when there is no effective prophylactic HIV vaccine available at present. Tremendous efforts have been directed towards development of effective anti-HIV-1 microbicides, which are defined as products that can be applied topically for the prevention of HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted infections by creating chemical, biological and-/or physical barriers. An effective microbicide against HIV should be efficient with anti-HIV-1 activity, safe with low cytotoxicity to host cells and broadspectrum against both R5-tropic and X4-tropic HIV-1 [6, 43, 44] . For satisfying all the criteria above, more resources of possible anti-HIV-1 reagents should be explored.",

Recently we reported that mucroporin-M1, one kind of modified scorpion venom peptide, can inhibit some RNA viruses such as measles virus, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses [38] . In this study, we screened the anti-HIV-1 efficacy of five scorpion venom peptides and their derivatives. The results showed that Kn2-7, BmKn2 and mucorporin-M1 exhibited varying degrees of antiviral effects and among them Kn2-7 peptide was the most effective with an EC 50 value of 2.76 mg/ml (Fig. 1) . According to the most potent anti-HIV-1 activity and low toxicity on TZM-bl cells and the mouse skin model (unpublished data), Kn2-7 was chosen for further investigation to clarify its anti-HIV-1 effect. Kn2-7 was modified from BmKn2 by enhancing the net positive charge of the hydrophilic side and the amphiphilic helix through amino acid replacing (G3K, A4R, and S10R). We found Kn2-7 had higher anti-HIV-1 activity than BmKn2, but with similar CC 50 to cells and even decreased toxicity response by the mouse skin model test (unpublished data). So, the modification improved the specific anti-viral activity in a certain extend. However, the mechanism needs to study further.",

We assumed that Kn2-7 may implement the inhibition of HIV-1 with the similar mechanism. The experiment of four different treatment groups of Kn2-7 to HIV-1 PV, in which the viral infectivity was inhibited only when Kn2-7 had chance to interact directly to HIV-1 PV, gave us a hint that Kn2-7 may exert its antiviral activity by damaging HIV virus particle itself. To clarify the presumption, we tried the binding assay for possible interaction between Kn2-7 and HIV-1 PV with Octet Red system by using APS sensors. The result confirmed that Kn2-7 could directly bind to HIV-1. However, whether viral particle could be broken by this binding is not clear. In experiments for effective action time of Kn2-7 to HIV-1 PV, it was observed that 3 min interaction allowed Kn2-7 showing almost maximum inhibition to HIV-1 PV (Fig. 2B) . This told us that the anti-HIV-1 activity of Kn2-7 was rapid and direct which is similar to the action manner of mucroporin to bacteria [31] . Barrel-stave model might explain what happened between Kn2-7 and HIV-1 virus to some extent [47, 48, 49] . We may deduce the action principles as following: once Kn2-7 encounters with HIV-1, Kn2-7 binds to the envelope of HIV-1 directly and immediately. The attached Kn2-7 aggregates and inserts into viral envelope so that the hydrophobic peptide regions align with the lipid core region and the hydrophilic peptide regions form the interior region of the pore, with the help of positive charge of peptide somehow. However, more investigations need to be done for further clarification.",
