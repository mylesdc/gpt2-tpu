CPV and FPV can single or mixed infect cats and cause disease. To diagnose sick animals effectively, an effective virus diagnostic and genome typing method with high sensitivity and specificity is required. Results: In this study, a conserved segment containing one SNP A4408C of parvovirus was used for real-time PCR amplification. Subsequently, data were auto-analyzed and plotted using Applied Biosystems\u00ae High Resolution Melt Software v3.1. Results showed that CPV and FPV can be detected simultaneously in a single PCR reaction. No crossreactions were observed with canine adenovirus, canine coronavirus, and canine distemper virus. The assay had a detection limit of 4.2 genome copies of CPV and FPV. A total of 80 clinical samples were subjected to this assay, as well as to conventional PCR-sequence assay and virus isolation. Results showed that the percentage of agreement of the assay and other methods are high. Conclusions: In short, we have developed a diagnostic test for the accurate detection and differentiation of CPV and FPV in fecal samples, which is also cost effective.",

Thirteen years later, a variant of an FPV like virus named CPV was identified in the fecal samples of dogs with diarrhea and spread worldwide rapidly [5] . Since then, the original CPV-2, which cannot infect cats, was subsequently replaced by three different but closely related antigenic variants (CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c), which can infect cats [5, 6] . CPV has evolved more rapidly than FPV, the substitution rate for the CPV and FPV clade was 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 and 9.4 \u00d7 10 \u2212 5 substitutions per site per year, respectively [7] .",

            "text": "Recently, it was reported that 80% of parvovirus isolates from domestic and leopard cats in Vietnam and Taiwan were CPV [8] . Compared with cases that 32.5 and 33.9% infection rates of CPV were demonstrated in a feline-only shelter and a mixed canine and feline shelter in the UK, respectively [8, 9] . In addition, Battilani et al. reported a co-infection case, which was identified to be infected by a new parvovirus variant inter CPV and FPV [10] . Furthermore, studies revealed the inter-FPV subspecies recombination and inter-antigenic recombination of CPV in vaccinated pups were demonstrated, which elucidates a novel mechanism for the emergence of CPV and the evolution of parvoviruses in nature, instead of the high and positive selection theory of parvovirus evolution [11, 12] . Thus, it's important to develop a diagnostic method that can detect and differentiate CPV from FPV in the same sample. However, traditional methods, such as DNA sequence and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, are expensive, labor-intensive and time-consuming [13, 14] . Afterward, taking into account a single polymorphism G3752A of the viral genome (reference strain: CPV Laika-1993 GenBank accession no. JN033694), a set of primers and probes, FPV/CPV-For, FPV/CPV-Rev and FPV/CPV-Pbs (VIC and FAM), was designed to develop a TaqMan MGB real-time PCR method for differentiating CPV from FPV [15] . However, this TaqMan MGB real-time PCR method was not used for all the prevalent isolates in China, because there are variants of CPV with nucleotide mutant at site 3752, e.g. the HB3 isolate, with the nucleotide mutant of A3752G, (GenBank accession no. GU392238) (Zhang, L. and Yan, X. J., unpublished data). With the application of saturated fluorescent dye, fluorescence data are collected by qPCR instruments at finer temperature resolution and the data are processed in the intuitive software platforms. High resolution melting analysis (HRM) assay is becoming a new method to quickly, inexpensively and efficiently scan clinical samples [16] [17] [18] .",

At present, various diagnostic methods were developed for detection of CPV and FPV, such as PCR, quartz crystal microbalance biosensor, hemagglutination, hemagglutination inhibition, immunochromatographic, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and so on [21] [22] [23] [24] .

A single base change from a purine to pyrimidine was easily identified, which results in a change in Tm of about 1\u00b0C caused by changes of hydrogen bond number. However, a mutation of A/T or C/G is difficult to discern causing a small change of Tm of about 0.4\u00b0C [27] . In this study, we designed a pair of primers targeted to amplify 101 bp segment which contains the SNP C4408A to specifically screen CPV and FPV. The data that the qPCR instrument generated were auto-analyzed in HRM analysis software. The HRM assay developed herein is an extremely sensitive, accurate technique to detect and differentiate the CPV and FPV variants. The detection limits of CPV and FPV were both 4.2 copies/\u03bcl (Fig. 4b  and c ). On the other hand, viral load can be determined by a standard curve. Although it's not essential for illness diagnosis, quantitation of virus load is of the greatest The results of detection and genotyping of 80 clinical samples with three methods showed a perfect agreement between HRM assay, DNA sequence, and virus isolation, with a percentage of agreement of the HRM assays and the other methods was 96.25 and 85%, respectively. Forty-eight samples were genotyped using HRM assay and 45 samples were identified using DNA sequence except for 3 samples. Of the 48 samples, 2 were classified as CPV-2, 21 were CPV-2a, 8 were CPV-2b, 11 were CPV-2c and 6 were FPV, respectively. And we found two CPV-2c isolates from cats and no other CPV types in cat samples. DNA sequencing and Virus isolations were all time-consuming and labor intensive, while the HRM assay has a lot of advantages over DNA sequencing, that can simultaneously detect many single-infection or co-infections in one assay, and data collection and analysis were automatic. This HRM assay was reproducible and can be used for genotyping CPV and FPV in clinical samples instead of DNA sequencing.",
