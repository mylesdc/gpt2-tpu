            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a major mosquito-borne pathogen infecting up to 100 million people each year; so far no effective treatment or vaccines are available. Recently, highly cross-reactive and infection-enhancing pre-membrane (prM)-specific antibodies were found to dominate the anti-DENV immune response in humans, raising concern over vaccine candidates that contain native dengue prM sequences. In this study, we have isolated a broadly cross-reactive prM-specific antibody, D29, during a screen with a non-immunized human Fab-phage library against the four serotypes of DENV. The antibody is capable of restoring the infectivity of virtually non-infectious immature DENV (imDENV) in FccR-bearing K562 cells. Remarkably, D29 also cross-reacted with a cryptic epitope on the envelope (E) protein located to the DI/DII junction as evidenced by site-directed mutagenesis. This cryptic epitope, while inaccessible to antibody binding in a native virus particle, may become exposed if E is not properly folded. These findings suggest that generation of anti-prM antibodies that enhance DENV infection may not be completely avoided even with immunization strategies employing E protein alone or subunits of E proteins.",

It infects approximately 50-100 million people each year, of which 500,000 people exhibit the life-threatening form of severe dengue -dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [1] . The current lack of treatment or licensed vaccine means dengue poses a serious public health threat [2] . Infection by one serotype of DENV confers lifelong immunity against the homologous serotype, but only limited crossprotection to the remaining three serotypes [3, 4] . The presence of cross-reactive, non-neutralizing antibodies generated during a primary infection has been suggested to enhance the pathogenicity of subsequent infections via the process of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [5] . A successful and safe vaccine candidate must therefore elicit a protective long-lasting immune response to all four serotypes [4, [6] [7] [8] .",

Broadly cross-reactive prM-specific antibodies dominated the screen and the Fab with highest affinity, D29 Fab-IgG, was converted into full-length human IgG1 format for thorough characterization. This antibody (D29 Fab-IgG) was found to have high affinity for a conformational epitope on prM and, like other prM antibodies [11, 12] , was capable of restoring the infectivity of virtually non-infectious immature DENV (imDENV) in FccR-bearing K562 cells. The antibody also cross-reacted with E protein -fine mapping and site-directed mutagenesis studies localized the epitope to the DI/ DII junction of E, which would be inaccessible in a native virus particle. This suggests the possibility that immunization strategies employing E protein alone or subunits of E proteins may not be able to completely avoid generation of anti-prM antibodies that enhance DENV infection.",

In agreement with the competition ELISA data, h3H5 and h4G2 did not compete with D29 Fab-IgG for epitopes in the Western blot format, whereas incubation with m2H2 abolished D29 binding to prM but not to E protein (Fig. 2D) .",

An initial radioactive immunoprecipitation showed D29 Fab-IgG binding to both E (,55 kDa) and prM (,20 kDa), as both proteins are precipitated whereas h4G2 only precipitated E protein (Fig. 3A) . However, as prM intrinsically interacts with E to form heterodimers, it is possible that antibody binding to one of the components in the heterodimer would pull down the other. To address this, dissociation of the heterodimer with 1.25% SDS was performed prior to the assay. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Identity of the precipitated proteins was verified by non-reducing Western blot analysis with h3H5 and m2H2, respectively (Fig. 3B ). The control antibodies were able to precipitate their corresponding binding partners. Despite the ability to recognize both prM and E on western blots, D29 Fab-IgG only precipitated prM. Taken collectively, our data indicate that D29 binds both prM and E but the epitope on E is not accessible on the native protein.",

An inhibition ELISA was carried out using synthetic ,20 mer linear peptides covering DENV2 prM [25] as well as a library of short 15-mer overlapping linear peptides (Mimotope) corresponding to aa1-166 of prM and aa1-495 of E (Materials and Methods S1). However, none of the linear peptides were able to significantly inhibit the binding of D29 Fab-IgG to DENV2 (Fig. S3) , suggesting that the epitope of D29 Fab-IgG1 is discontinuous. Next, D29 Fab-IgG was screened using a random dodecapeptide (Ph.D-12)-phage library as this approach has previously been used to map antibody-binding motifs [26, 27] . Peptide-phage clones were randomly selected from the second, third and fourth round of panning, and their binding specificity was confirmed by direct binding ELISA against D29 Fab-IgG. Reactive clones were sequenced and checked against a list of common target-unrelated peptides (TUPs) [28] to eliminate peptides that react with constant regions of antibodies, protein A/G sepharose or plastic surfaces. No TUPs were detected and the resulting 20 unique clones fall into three main consensus groups: 26% contained the motif W(TL/SV)K(L/X)PXW; 14% contained the motif AKTMP and 33% contained the motif KXPXW ( Table 1) .",

Localization of D29 Fab-IgG predicted epitopes in 3D crystal structures of DENV2 prM-E heterodimer (PDB 3C6E) and the binding specificity of peptide-phages. (A) Clusters of conformational epitopes predicted by Pepitope server are displayed on the prM-E heterodimer crystal structure at neutral pH with their solvent-accessible surfaces highlighted. The prM is pink, EDI is red, EDII is yellow, EDIII is blue, FP is cyan. (B) The binding specificity of peptide-phages (P1-P9) to D29 Fab-IgG was tested in a direct ELISA format with 10 mg/ml of D29 Fab-IgG, h3H5, m2H2 and non-DENV specific human antibody (Hu) immobilized on a Maxisorb plate. Ability of peptide-phages to inhibit D29 Fab-IgG binding to DENV2 was investigated by (C) ELISA and (D) Western blot analysis. For ELISA, peptide-phages (10 12 pfu/ml) were incubated with D29 Fab-IgG for 1 hr at RT before application to immobilized DENV2 for 5 min at RT. Bound D29 Fab-IgG was detected with HRP-conjugated anti-Human IgG-Fc. The percentage of inhibition of D29 Fab-IgG binding by the peptide-phages shown is the average of three experiments. Error bars represent the standard errors of the mean (***p-value ,0.005). For Western blot analysis, 0.5 mg/ml of D29 Fab-IgG was incubated with 8610 6 pfu of purified DENV2, 5% SM or 4610 11 pfu of peptide-phage clones for 1 hr at RT before applying to membrane transblotted with DENV2 viral lysate for 30 min at RT. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0033451.g004 peptides with the KXPXW motif could mostly be mapped to the highest scoring Cluster 1 located at the prM/EDII interface. A few exceptions mapped to Cluster 3, most probably due to poorer sequence match and a lower alignment score. The remaining two motifs were mapped to the second highest scoring Cluster 2 that spans EDI and EDII (Fig. 4A) .",

The peptide-phage clones were then tested for their ability to inhibit D29 Fab-IgG's binding to immobilized DENV2. Although most of the selected peptide-phage clones only weakly inhibited D29 Fab-IgG's binding to DENV2, clone P3 (Cluster 1) and P9 (Cluster 2) significantly competed by 30% and 70%, respectively (Fig. 4C ). Significant inhibition of binding to both prM and E was also observed on Western blot for P9, however no noticeable inhibition was observed for P3 (Fig. 4D) . Alignment of P3 and P9 peptide sequences to their respective clusters revealed 9 and 11 aa match, respectively (Fig. 5 ). This may explain the difference in the ability of the two peptide phage clones to inhibit binding of D29 Fab-IgG.",

            "text": "The epitope of D29 was mapped using a random-peptide phage display library, an approach which has been widely used for the identification of both linear and conformational epitopes [26, [31] [32] [33] [34] . Two peptide phage clones, P3 (Cluster 1) and P9 (Cluster 2), displayed significant inhibition of D29 Fab-IgG binding to immobilized DENV2 by ELISA; P9 was also able to significantly block the binding of D29 Fab-IgG in a nonreducing Western blot analysis. This may be due to a better sequence match of P9 to its predicted cluster compared with P3 (Fig. 5) , hence, a higher affinity of the peptide to D29 Fab-IgG. To ascertain the authenticity of the predicted epitopes, the predicted residues were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the P3 and P9 peptide sequence. The residues P56L, P58Q and P59N within the P3 epitope were found to be the principle residues involved in the interaction between prM and D29 Fab-IgG; they were also critical for the binding of m2H2, corroborating with results of competition assays. The binding for E protein was not really affected by mutation of aa residues within the P3 epitope; contrasting to the significant impact caused by mutation of 1-2 residues within the P9 epitope. The combined mutation of E129V, E131Q, E133E, and E134N completely abolished binding of D29 Fab-IgG to E protein, establishing the critical residues within the P9 epiotpe. Taken together, these results suggest that D29 Fab-IgG recognises two epitopes on DENV -a solvent-accessible epitope on prM as the principle binding epitope, and a cryptic epitope on E which mimics the prM epitope but is not available on a native, functionally-folded E protein. The P3 and P9 epitopes are highly conserved across the four DENV serotypes, as well as two other flaviviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus and West nile virus; but with increasing divergence in Yellow fever virus and Tick-borne encephalitis virus (Fig. S4) .",

However, as demonstrated in this study and recent reports, prM-specific antibodies are able to restore and enhance the infectivity of imDENV and partially mature DENV [9, 11, 12] ; it may be worthwhile to consider alternative vaccine approaches that minimize anti-prM responses during vaccine design [9] . The findings from our study also suggest that any partial denaturation or unfolding of an E protein vaccine preparation may result in the exposure of a cryptic P9-like epitope, which has the potential to induce D29-like antibodies with threatening ADE capability.",

The similarity of D29 Fab-IgG to germline sequence suggests that such antibodies are present in the immune repertoire of na\u00efve individuals and given the inherent high affinity of D29, such antibodies may be preferentially selected during clonal expansion and maintained as memory. Indeed, antibodies that cross-react between prM and E has been isolated from memory B cells in primary and secondary dengue patients [9, 11] . The original immunogens for these cross-reactive antibodies are difficult to determine since they were generated in the course of natural infections, but it would be interesting to identify the epitope and germline of these antibodies and compare the sequences with D29 Fab-IgG. and prM, 10 mg/ml of synthetic peptides corresponding to prM (A) and E (B) was incubated with D29 Fab-IgG. Peptides corresponding to E were tested individually but presented as groups of 5. For all experiments, 2610 6 pfu/ml of DENV2 or imDENV2 was included as control antigen.
