These patients should continue Introduction Influenza A virus subtype H1N1, a pandemic 2009 strain, caused widespread outbreaks of influenza in humans. As of 17 June 2010, more than 214 countries had reported confirmed cases of infection with pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus [1] . Patients typically presented with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which led to severe lung damage and in some cases death. After recovery from severe pneumonia and ARDS, various degrees of lung lesions occur, having an impact on patients' respiratory function and in turn his or her quality of life. In this study, we examined the pulmonary function of patients infected with influenza A virus subtype H1N1 one year after hospitalization for the infection. These results provide valuable information for future diagnosis and rehabilitation treatment of H1N1 and other pandemic or severe influenza strain infections. [2] . To ensure patients were not examined during or shortly after airway infections, all participants answered a questionnaire detailing any complaints of dyspnea, tiredness, cough, expectoration, medical treatment and smoking habits. The Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale was used to evaluate dyspnea of patients with abnormal pulmonary function (a score of 4 points, 2 cases; 3 points, 4 cases; 2 points, 14 cases;1 point, 4 cases; and 0 points, 2 cases) and with normal pulmonary function (a score of 4 points, 2 cases; 3 points, 2 cases; 2 points, 8 cases;1 point, 10 cases; and 0 points, 2 cases). Of these 48 patients, 38 were diagnosed by members of the Department of Respiratory Medicine and ten were diagnosed by members of the Department of Infection. The study included 26 male and 22 female patients with an average age of 29.5 years (range 27-39.5). Of the original 102 patients, eight (7.8%) had died: one from pneumonia and seven from disorders that could not be attributed to pulmonary disease. Fortysix (45.1%) patients were not re-examined due to practical problems. However, based on the data from 2009, these 46 patients did not differ from the 48 re-examined patients with respect to age, sex, disease duration, or degree of pulmonary function. Patients with chronic respiratory system disease (i.e. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis), chronic heart disease, or nervous and mental diseases were excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject.",

During recovery, pulmonary fibrosis is the major pathological change observed during recovery [4] . In addition, abnormal pulmonary function is manifested as decreased diffusion function and restrictive ventilatory disorder [6] . There is precedence for long term negative effects from pulmonary infection, as viral pneumonia-caused ARDS is a typical manifestation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections. Specifically, SARS patients presented with decreased pulmonary diffusion function during recovery [7] [8] [9] [10] . Furthermore, a study by Neff et al [11] revealed that among 16 survivors of severe ARDS, 9 had abnormal pulmonary function, while four presented with obstructive ventilatory disorder and four with restrictive ventilatory disorder. In addition, a study by Li et al [12] found the incidence of obstructive ventilatory disorder and restrictive ventilatory disorder was approximately 30% following infection. Interestingly small airway dysfunction was also reported in a small number of SARS patients during recovery [8] . This is the first study to assess the long term effects of mild influenza A virus subtype H1N1. Pulmonary diffusion disorder during H1N1 influenza infection recovery is similar to ARDS, however, a large proportion of patients recovering from influenza infection also show signs of small airway obstruction. In addition, this study reveals that approximately half of patients recovering from H1N1 influenza had abnormal pulmonary function, one third had diffusion dysfunction, a third had small airway obstruction, and another third presented with decreased ventilation function. The pathological changes following H1N1 influenza-induced severe pneumonia include three types: diffuse alveolar lesion, necrotizing bronchiolitis and widespread pulmonary hemorrhage [13] . This suggests that necrotizing bronchiolitis is likely to be the pathological basis of small airway obstruction. Here, we found 25% of patients had respiratory tract infection symptoms including cough, expectoration, or gasping, while 41.7% of patients had difficulties in performing general physical activities. Interestingly, the observed clinical symptoms correlated with patients having greater than three abnormal pulmonary function indices. In this study, we did not identify a relationship between abnormal pulmonary function of patients with H1N1 influenza and the severity of pulmonary function impairment during hospitalization, possibly because mild H1N1 influenza patients and a small number of H1N1 influenza patients were involved. This is consistent with previous studies investigating the effects of ARDS on pulmonary function [14, 15] . Several variables were not included in this study that may have also had an effect on the recovery of pulmonary function following influenza infection, including age, obesity, gender, recovery time, heart function, and the amount of physical rehabilitation exercise.",
