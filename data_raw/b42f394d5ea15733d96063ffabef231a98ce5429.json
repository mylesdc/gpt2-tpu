            "text": "Fig. S2. The SosV-RBP loop \uf0622L23 coordinates a putative calcium cation. (a) The Fo\uf02dFc difference map indicates the presence of a cation coordinated by the SosV-RBP loop \uf0622L23 via the main chain carbonyl oxygen of residues Asp269, Thr272, and Gly274, and the side chains of Asp269, Thr272, and Glu276. A similar mechanism of stabilization of \uf0622L23 through coordination of a calcium cation has been observed in several HN RBP structures, and loss of calcium inhibits activity in NDV-RBP [2]. The Fo\uf02dFc difference map is rendered at 2.0 \uf073 and represented as mesh (green). (b)Fitting of a calcium ion (green) into loop \uf0622L23 is consistent with the 2Fo\uf02dFc difference map. The 2Fo\uf02dFc electron density is rendered at 2.0 \uf073 and displayed as mesh (blue). SosV-RBP is displayed in cartoon (gray) representation, with important residues and glycans displayed as sticks.Supplementary Fig. S3. The SosV-RBP hexapeptide motif region is structurally distinct to NDV-RBP and other HN-RBPs. SosV-RBP (gray) and NDV-RBP (white) (1E8V) [3] are shown in cartoon representation with the relevant side chains represented as sticks. N-Acetyl-2,3-dehydro-2deoxyneuramic acid (DANA) is shown as yellow sticks. Homologous residues are numbered according to SosV-RBP. In contrast to NDV-RBP, SosV-RBP residues Arg242, Leu243, and His245 impede into the putative sialic acid binding site. The side-chain of Lys236 in NDV-RBP has been observed to adopt different conformations between ligand-free and ligand-bound states [2], however, subsequent structural studies of other HN RBPs commonly show the above orientation [4-7]. Supplementary Fig. S4. The unique disulfide formed between Cys522 and Cys527 could contribute to the unique orientation of loop \uf0625L23. Both SosV-RBP (gray) and NDV-RBP (white) (1E8V) are shown in cartoon representation with the relevant residues represented using sticks and colored according to atom. The conserved triarginyl motif of the SosV-RBP structure is disrupted, loop \uf0625L23 bends outwards, away from the putative active site. The disulfide bond (Cys522\uf02dCys527) formed between \uf0625S3 and \uf0625S4 has not been observed in other paramyxovirus HN RBPs and may contribute to the structural displacement of residue Arg514 in SosV-RBP.",
