The endoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in many cellular processes, which includes protein synthesis, folding and post-translational processing of newly synthesized proteins. It is also the site for quality control of misfolded proteins and entry point of extracellular proteins to the secretory pathway. Hence at any given point of time, endoplasmic reticulum contains two different cohorts of proteins, (i) proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum-specific function, which reside in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, called as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins and (ii) proteins which are in process of moving to the extracellular space. Thus, endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins must somehow be distinguished from newly synthesized secretory proteins, which pass through the endoplasmic reticulum on their way out of the cell. Approximately only 50% of the proteins used in this study as training data had endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, which shows that these signals are not essentially present in all endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. This also strongly indicates the role of additional factors in retention of endoplasmic reticulum-specific proteins inside the endoplasmic reticulum.",

This is a support vector machine based method, where we had used different forms of protein features as inputs for support vector machine to develop the prediction models.

In this study, we have reported a novel support vector machine based method for predicting endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins, named as ERPred. During training we achieved a maximum accuracy of 81.42% with leave-one-out approach of cross-validation. When evaluated on independent dataset, ERPred did prediction with sensitivity of 72.31% and specificity of 83.69%. We have also annotated six different proteomes to predict the candidate endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins in them. A webserver, ERPred, was developed to make the method available to the scientific community, which can be accessed at http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/erpred/ index.html. Discussion. We found that out of 124 proteins of the training dataset, only 66 proteins had endoplasmic reticulum retention signals, which shows that these signals are not an absolute necessity for endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins to remain inside the endoplasmic reticulum.

            "text": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle of eukaryotic cells. It participates in several essential cellular activities, such as quality control of protein production, recognition of mis-folded proteins, lipid biosynthesis, detoxification, steroids and xenobiotic compound metabolism, protection against cellular stress, intracellular calcium homeostasis, and intracellular signalling (Lavoie & Paiement, 2008; Verkhratsky, 2002) . ER malfunction might lead to many diseases like cystic fibrosis, cancer and juvenile pulmonary emphysema (Robinson-Rechavi et al., 2001) and neurological disorders like ischemia and epileptic seizures (Paschen & Frandsen, 2001) . ER is involved in several co-translational and post-translational modifications like signal-peptide cleavage, disulphide bond formation, N-linked glycosylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor formation (Barz & Walter, 1999) and is also essential for post-translational processing of secretory proteins that makes it one of the important components of eukaryotic secretory protein system (Barlowe & Miller, 2013) . Secretory proteins are synthesized on rough ER and routed across the ER membrane into lumen through a co-translational process. Inside the ER, they undergo glycosylation and attain their specific 3D conformation before being further transported downstream in the secretory system. The whole process is achieved with the help of highly coordinated action of several proteins which includes molecular chaperones and different enzymes (Nakatsukasa & Brodsky, 2008) . Proteins, which help ER in carrying out above-mentioned functions, do not get secreted, and they are called as ER resident proteins (ERRPs). In addition to ERRPs, mis-folded or unfolded proteins are also retained back in ER and forwarded for proteasome-mediated degradation if the error could not be rectified (Sitia & Braakman, 2003; Van Anken & Braakman, 2005; Wang & Hebert, 2003) . Therefore, in order to remain localized in ER, the ERRP must be recognized precisely and discriminated from the misfolded proteins or proteins of secretory pathway.",

For example, similar to ER, from Golgi apparatus, also the proteins automatically proceed downstream to the plasma membrane or vacuoles in absence of an active retention process. Also a number of ERRPs are forced to localize in ER by continuous retrieval from the Golgi complex. Luminal ER proteins may be retrieved by using retrograde transport with help of C-terminal KDEL sequence while Type I transmembrane proteins-including ER residents and itinerant proteins of the ER/Golgi system-contain a C-terminal dilysine motif that signals their retrieval from post-ER membranes (Gaynor et al., 1994; Jackson, Nilsson & Peterson, 1993; Townsley & Pelham, 1994) . The dilysine motif known as KKxx and KxKxx motifs, consists of a pair of lysine residues at the C terminus of the cargo protein (Jackson, Nilsson & Peterson, 1990; Nilsson, Jackson & Peterson, 1989) . Many variants of the dilysine motif have been reported such as KxHxx retrieval motif in the tail of the spike protein of group I coronaviruses (Lontok, Corse & Machamer, 2004) , and the RKxx motif present in the Golgi-localized Scyl1 protein (Burman et al., 2008) .",

Despite the fact that the functionality of Golgi and ER are intricately intertwined with each other, several Golgi prediction methods have been developed (Chou, Yin & Xu, 2010; Jiao & Du, 2016) . No attempt has been made to develop species neutral ERRPs predictor. Though in few subcellular localization prediction methods, ER has been included as a location, but at present, to the best of our knowledge, a predictor which can specifically predict ERRPs does not exist. Moreover, predictors like ProLoc- GO (Huang et al., 2008) , KnowPred site (Lin et al., 2009 ), SLocX (Ryngajllo et al., 2011 ), iLoc-Animal (Lin et al., 2013 ), iLoc-Euk (Chou, Wu & Xiao, 2011 ), Cello v-2.5 (Yu et al., 2006 , HybridGO-Loc (Wan, Mak & Kung, 2014) , mGOASVM (Wan, Mak & Kung, 2012) , Hum-Ploc (Chou & Shen, 2006) , Euk-mPloc (Chou & Shen, 2007) , PSLT (Scott, Thomas & Hallett, 2004) , Euk-mPloc 2.0 (Chou & Shen, 2010) , the method developed by Cherian & Nair (2010), and Guo et al. (2016) considered ER as one among many subcellular locations. But these have some shortcomings like (i) among the above mentioned predictors, none were designed specifically to predict ERRPs; (ii) datasets used for training for prediction model were very old; (iii) subcellular locations were determined for a particular organism or groups (plant/animal/viral); (iv) many of them do not provide webserver/standalone software for scientific purpose and if some of them does so, they are not in working condition.",

We have also developed a freely accessible webserver and software that predicts ERRPs using their amino acid sequence.

To avoid any ambiguity, the dataset that has to be used for training the predictor should contain experimentally annotated proteins of high quality. We found that there exists a database of human ER proteins (both known and potential) named as HERA (Scott et al., 2004) . Since HERA is not updated and contains only human proteins hence we selected SwissProt, the manually curated section of UniProt protein database, to download the data. To retrieve the ERRPs from SwissProt, we used following criteria (i) proteins should be of eukaryotic origin and reviewed; (ii) should be present only in ER; (iii) existence proven by 'evidence at protein level'; (iv) protein should be full length and not fragmented (v) should have more than 50 amino acids because smaller proteins are mostly fragments; and (vi) protein location should be experimentally verified. For negative dataset, we tried to collect all types of non-ERRPs so that the predictor is trained on a comprehensive dataset and it can easily differentiate ERRPs from the non-ERRPs. We selected two different types of proteins as non-ERRPs (1) proteins which are N-glycosylated, since N-glycosylation occurs in ER (Bieberich, 2014; Roth et al., 2010) ; (2) non N-glycosylated proteins, since not all ER proteins are N-glycosylated.

In this work the redundancy was reduced to 40% using CD-HIT (Li & Godzik, 2006) and 124 ERRPs were obtained which were used as positive dataset. 1,200 eukaryotic non-ERRPs were used as the negative dataset (Table 1; Table S1 ).

In prediction methods, three cross-validation approaches are most frequently used: independent dataset test, subsampling test (N-fold cross-validation) and jack-knife test or leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). Among the three cross-validation approaches, LOOCV gives unique result for a given benchmark dataset and hence used in a number of prediction methods (Kumar et al., 2014b; Kumar et al., 2015; Kumari, Kumar & Kumar, 2014; Lin et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013) . In the present study, we have used LOOCV approach for the evaluation purpose, in which all except one sequence of dataset is used as training set and remaining one sequence as test set. This process is repeated till each sequence has been used for testing. At a selected parameter, SVM was trained using the training set and predictive performance of model was evaluated on corresponding test set.

Pseudo-amino acid composition of a protein is actually a set of discrete numbers, which is derived from its amino acid sequence. It allows representation of both compositional and positional amino acid pattern in a discrete mode (Limongelli, Marini & Bellazzi, 2015) . It also reflects sequence order information and length of the proteins (Chou, 2005) . Many tools (Du et al., 2012; Han, Yu & Anh, 2014; Kumar et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014; Mondal & Pai, 2014) are available to calculate the pseudo-amino acid composition of protein sequences.

            "text": "ERRPs follow two basic mechanisms to stay inside the ER: (i) signal dependent and (ii) signal independent. Signal dependent proteins have ER-retention signals while signal independent proteins do not have these signals, e.g., some cereal prolamin storage proteins (Sophie Pagny, Faye & Gomord, 1999) . In order to find out the efficiency of signal based approach, we evaluated ER retention signal based prediction of ERRPs using Prosite motif database (Hulo et al., 2006) . Using standalone version of ScanProsite (Gattiker, Gasteiger & Bairoch, 2002) , out of 124 proteins of training dataset, we were able to find ER retention signal ([KRHQSA]-[DENQ]-E-L) in only 66 proteins, which shows that signal sequence is not present in all ERRPs. This shows that signal based approach may not be appropriate for complete ERRP repertoire prediction of any proteome. Similarly there are many non-ERRPs, which also have ER-retention signal but they do not reside into the ER. Efficiency of signal based approach also suggests that presence of ER-retention signal may not be the only factor responsible to hold a protein inside ER. It also implies that a good ER predictor should also be able to discriminate and recognize ERRPs that does not have ER-retention signals and the non-ERRPs that have ER-signals. So, in order to evaluate our method on the above-mentioned two parameters, we analysed 65 ERRPs of independent dataset for presence of ER-retention signal by ScanProsite. We found that only 21 proteins had ER-signal while remaining 44 proteins did not have any ER-signal. Further, when we predicted whether these 44 ERRPs localizes to ER or not using ERPred, 27 proteins were predicted as ERRPs and 17 as non-ERRPs. We also benchmarked the ERPred using 2,900 non-ERRPs of independent dataset containing ER-retention signal sequences. ERPred correctly predicted the non-ERRPs with 83.69% specificity (Table 3 ). This shows that the mere presence or absence of ER-retention signal does not necessarily implies ERRP or non-ERRP respectively. Wrzeszczynski & Rost (2004) also observed that most of the known ER-retention signals are too specific and/or too inaccurate to be used in alone for automatic protein annotation. Their observation was also based on experimentally characterized short sequence motifs and sequence similarity search to experimentally characterized proteins. They also showed that either >80% pairwise sequence identity or <10 \u2212100 E-value can be used for homology-transfer based annotation and at very low coverage which severely limit the number of true positives.",

Since similarity search considers whole protein sequence rather than a short stretch of ER-retention signal, this approach should be more effective than the signal based approach. In order to assess the efficiency of BLAST to discover new ERRPs, we evaluated the performance of BLAST search using the proteins of training dataset. In this process, each protein out of 124 was used as query and remaining 123 proteins as database. At e-value threshold \u22651e \u2212 3, only 56 proteins found ERRP as first BLAST hit. Remaining 68 proteins did not get any hit. It shows that finding homologous sequence using BLAST is also not sufficient to search all ERRPs. Our inference regarding usage of BLAST in prediction of ERRPs is also supported by the observation noted by Wrzeszczynski & Rost (2004) that even very high levels of sequence similarity might not be sufficient to infer ER localization without error.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing method which can specifically predict ERRPs. Though a few subcellular localization prediction methods considered ER as one of many locations in the cell these predict ER proteins along with proteins of other subcellular locations like, ProLoc- GO (Huang et al., 2008) , KnowPredsite (Lin et al., 2009 ), SLocX (Ryngajllo et al., 2011 ), iLoc-Animal (Lin et al., 2013 ), Cello v.2.5 (Yu et al., 2006 , Euk-mPloc (Chou & Shen, 2007) , Euk-mPloc 2.0 (Chou & Shen, 2010) , HybridGO-Loc (Wan, Mak & Kung, 2014 ), mGOASVM (Wan, Mak & Kung, 2012 , Hum-Ploc (Chou & Shen, 2006) and iLoc-Euk (Chou, Wu & Xiao, 2011) . Unfortunately, ProLoc- GO (Huang et al., 2008) , KnowPredsite (Lin et al., 2009) were not found in a working state and HybridGO-Loc and mGOASVM considered only viral and plant proteins. Hum-Ploc is meant only for human proteins, SLocX (Ryngajllo et al., 2011) predicts only ER proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana and iLoc-Animal (Lin et al., 2013) predicts only proteins of animal system. Since ERPred prediction is not organism/taxa specific hence we compared our method with those methods which are not restricted to a particular organism or plant/animal like Cello v.2.5 (Yu et al., 2006 ), iLoc-Euk (Chou, Wu & Xiao, 2011 ) and Euk-mPLoc 2.0 (Chou & Shen, 2010 (an updated version of Euk-mPloc (Chou & Shen, 2007) ) using independent dataset. The sensitivity of ERPred on independent dataset was 72.31% with 83.69% specificity while for Cello v.2.5 the corresponding values were 16.92% and 99.86% respectively and for iLoc-Euk the sensitivity and specificity was 15.38% and 99.76% respectively (Table 3) . Hence Euk-mPLoc showed better performance than iLoc-Euk and Cello v 2.5 in terms of sensitivity, which was 66.15%. As shown in Table 3 , among all the predictors, ERPred performed better in prediction of ERRPs but its performance in terms of specificity or non-ERRPs was lesser than other predictors. It might be due to the fact that all predictors, which we have used here for evaluation on the basis of independent dataset, were intended to predict multiple locations. The result shows that in majority of cases they were predicting locations other than ER, due to which their overall efficiency was higher. In other words, in most cases, they were predicting ERRPs and non-ERRPs as non-ERRPs, which increased their performance. But, if we carefully analyse the results, it can be observed that their performance is not equally good for the prediction of ERRPs. This also vindicates our attempt to develop a dedicated predictor for ERRPs. We also evaluated the performance of BLAST based annotation using sequences of training and independent dataset as database and query respectively. We found that only 40 ERRP sequences of independent dataset were annotated as ERRP. Remaining 25 sequences did not get any hit.",

In mouse, ERPred estimated 1,781 proteins (3.94% of the proteome), which was in line with the estimation of 1,588 by Locate and slightly lower than ER-GolgiDB databases respectively. Nearly identical fraction of ERRPs in mouse and human proteomes was expected due to their close evolutionary relationship. We feel the difference in numbers might be due to the proteome size. We expect the number will increase, as more and more proteins will be added to the proteome. In case of C. elegans proteomes, the fractions of ERRPs was almost equal while in D. melanogaster and A. thaliana the fraction was slightly less. This might be due to the fact that both ER-GolgiDB and Locate were last updated in 2010 and 2008 respectively.",

In these methods, the accuracy of prediction of ERRPs is very less in comparison of other locations. The purpose of the present study is therefore to describe a tool, ERPred, for the prediction of ERRPs. The tool uses only the protein sequence information for prediction. While developing the method, we tried different forms of sequence compositions; namely amino acid, dipeptide, and pseudo amino acid compositions. Better performance of a pseudo-amino acid composition based SVM module than the simple amino acid and dipeptide composition based modules reveals that pseudo amino acid composition encapsulates amino acid ordering information better than dipeptide composition. But the best performance was obtained when amino acid compositions of different part of proteins were used. The amino acid composition based SVM module gave 73.34% accuracy. The performance was decreased to \u223c1% giving 72.28% accuracy when we used dipeptide composition as input. Dipeptide composition was used to incorporate composition as well as local order information. Further, when we used pseudo-amino acid composition, it showed a better accuracy of 74.85%. In order to include information of enrichment and depletion of amino acids in a specific region of ERRPs, we also used SAAC in which a protein sequence was divided into three different ways (N-ter-SAAC, C-ter-SAAC, and SAAC-3 parts). N-ter-SAAC contained two sets of amino acid compositions, one from 25 N-terminal residues and other from rest of the residues while C-ter-SAAC also had two sets of amino acid compositions firstly from 25 C-terminal residues and remaining residues. SAAC-3 parts had three sets of vectors from 25 N-terminal residues, 25 C-terminal residues and the remaining sequence residues. SVM modules based on N-ter-SAAC, C-ter-SAAC and SAAC-3 parts respectively achieved accuracy of 79.53%, 71.07% and 81.42%. This shows that the SVM module developed from C-ter-SAAC was least efficient whereas the SAAC-3 parts based module was better for discriminating ERRPs from non-ERRPs. The performance obtained from different SVM models can be explained by the fact that retention of proteins inside ER is mediated by some signal sequences or related sequences (Gomord, Wee & Faye, 1999) . Hence an input vector, which resolves the signal sequences efficiently, is expected to perform better than others.",

The results show that split composition-based features were most predictive. KDEL and its variants is the most common signal present generally at the C-terminal of ERRPs. The other well-characterized retention signal is the di-lysine and di-arginine motifs present at C-and N-terminals respectively. But these signals are neither present in all ERRPs nor sufficient to retain all to ER (Gao et al., 2014; Ma & Goldberg, 2013) . This also suggests that other parts of proteins also play a very important role in retention of ERRPs in ER (Scott et al., 2004) . The most surprising result we obtained was the performance of dipeptide composition based SVM models, which has shown least performance among all. Ideally it should have picked up the signals responsible for retention of ERRPs in ER and should have shown better performance than at least amino acid and pseudo amino acid compositions based models. The higher performance of SAAC-3 parts in comparison to the C-and N-ter SAAC can also be explained in light of this fact that in SAAC-3 parts the presence of signal as well as other unknown factors present at non-terminal regions can be highlighted better than the C-and N-ter SAAC.",
