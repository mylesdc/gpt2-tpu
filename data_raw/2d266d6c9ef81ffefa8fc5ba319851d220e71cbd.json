            "text": "Discovery of new viruses has been boosted by novel deep sequencing technologies. Currently, many viruses can be identified by sequencing without knowledge of the pathogenicity of the virus. However, attributing the presence of a virus in patient material to a disease in the patient can be a challenge. One approach to meet this challenge is identification of viral sequences based on enrichment by autologous patient antibody capture. This method facilitates identification of viruses that have provoked an immune response within the patient and may increase the sensitivity of the current virus discovery techniques. To demonstrate the utility of this method, virus discovery deep sequencing (VIDISCA-454) was performed on clinical samples from 19 patients: 13 with a known respiratory viral infection and 6 with a known gastrointestinal viral infection. Patient sera was collected from one to several months after the acute infection phase. Input and antibody capture material was sequenced and enrichment was assessed. In 18 of the 19 patients, viral reads from immunogenic viruses were enriched by antibody capture (ranging between 1.5x to 343x in respiratory material, and 1.4x to 53x in stool). Enriched reads were also determined in an identity independent manner by using a novel algorithm Xcompare. In 16 of the 19 patients, 21% to 100% of the enriched reads were derived from infecting viruses. In conclusion, the technique provides a novel approach to specifically identify immunogenic viral sequences among the bulk of sequences which are usually encountered during virus discovery metagenomics.",

After deep sequencing, comparison of reads in the captured material to reads in the input material should reveal virus-specific reads via capture by the antibodies. We tested this strategy in 13 respiratory samples, diagnosed as containing one of the following viruses: human parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 4, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus virus, influenza virus A and B, human respiratory syncytial virus and human coronavirus 229E, OC43 and NL63. We also tested 6 fecal samples containing adenovirus, norovirus, enterovirus and sapovirus. Autologous convalescent sera collected one to a few months after infection was available for all samples (see table 1 ).

Apparently the low number of viral reads in the captured material were from a different part of the viral genome than the few reads of the viral reads in the input. Therefore, it has to be kept in mind that using this approach during data analysis might diminish the chance to identify viruses which are hardly present in the input material when identification is only based on the detection of enriched sequences. On the other hand, inclusion of the reads which are only present in one of the two libraries might lead to wrong interpretations by the presence of experimental artefacts due to PCR errors and/or chimeric PCR products.",

Nonetheless, we were able to reduce the amount of reads originating from bacteriophages and plant viruses (enrichment index of 0.01 and 0.08), indicating that this method can efficiently reduce the background in fecal samples. Furthermore, it could be that the immune response to enteroviruses is poor, especially in immunocompromised patients, which is the case in our study patients with diarrhoea. These patients were HIV-1 positive with relatively low CD4 counts (0.18 and 0.05610E9 cells/L in the two patients with enterovirus infection).

It has been shown that serum antibodies, for instance against PIV-1 are not neutralizing efficiently, and that especially secretory IgA plays an important role in preventing re-infection [26, 27] .

Especially in stool samples, which contain many unknown viruses, it is important to determine whether novel viruses are pathogenic. A pathogenic virus elicits an immune response in the host, whereas bacteriophages and plant viruses, which are also massively present in stool, do not. The restriction that the agent has to be recognized by the patients' antibodies adds an important selectivity tool to virus discovery when one wants to focus on pathogenic viruses. In summary, a new selective approach for virus discovery is presented that enables detection of viruses that have recently elicited an immune response resulting in antibody production. The method appears to be an effective tool for reducing host DNA/ RNA and bystander virus sequences and provides a selection for viruses that are able to elicit an antibody response, thus agents that are possibly pathogenic for the host. Moreover, the possibility of comparing reads obtained after antibody capture with reads obtained from the input samples is useful for identifying sequences not yet labelled in Genbank. Further analysis of those sequences (e.g. via genome walking) will allow the identification and characterization of viruses which are highly divergent from the currently known virus families.",
