Molecular epidemiological data are limited for HRV circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. Objectives: To identify the species and genotypes of HRV from clinical samples collected in Sydney, Australia, from 2006 to 2009. Methods: Combined nose and throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from individuals with ILI were tested for HRV using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequencing data of 5\u2032UTR and VP4/VP2 coding regions on RT-PCR-positive specimens were analysed. Results: Human rhinoviruses were detected by real-time PCR in 20.9% (116/555) of samples tested. Phylogenetic analysis of 5\u2032UTR and VP4/VP2 on HRV-positive samples was concordant in the grouping of HRV A and B species but not HRV C species.",

Discordant branching was seen within HRV A group: two sequences clustering as A in the VP4/VP2 tree branched within the C/A subspecies in the 5\u2032UTR tree, and one sequence showed identity to different HRV A strains in the two genes. The prevalence of HRV C and C/A species was greater in paediatric compared to adult patients (47.9% vs 25.5%, P = .032).",

            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are a diverse virus group, currently known to contain 167 serotypes. 1 Along with human enteroviruses (HEV), HRV belong to the Picornaviridae family, 2 although they are phylo genetically unrelated to HEV despite similarities in genome organization and structure. Human rhinoviruses are generally associated with the common cold and mild upper respiratory infections, 3 but can also cause severe respiratory infections in immunocompromised hosts (including lung and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients) or patients with chronic pulmonary diseases. [4] [5] [6] [7] Unlike respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses, HRV can cause respiratory illness throughout the year, but peak incidence occurs in early autumn and spring in temperate climates. 6 Early molecular analyses of the HRV capsid protein coding regions clustered different serotypes into two distinct species, HRV A and HRV B. 8 In 2007, a new HRV genetic variant (subsequently designated HRV C) was identified in patients with severe pneumonia from the United States of America (USA), Germany, Hong Kong, Australia and China. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Severe respiratory disease and asthma exacerbations in children were observed. 11, 14 HRV C has been further divided into two subspecies, HRV Cc and HRV Ca. 15 HRV C strains are difficult to grow in cell lines known to support the growth of other rhinoviruses, 11 although two HRV C isolates have been propagated in nasal epithelial cell cultures. 16 There are limited molecular epidemiological data on HRV circulating in the Southern Hemisphere, including Australia. This study aimed to identify the species and genotypes of HRV from clinical samples collected in Sydney, Australia, over four consecutive years by analysing the nucleotide homology in the 5\u2032UTR, VP4 and part of the VP2 capsid protein coding regions.

Human rhinoviruses C or C/A variant was detected more In our study, the sequences grouped into three phylogenetically distinct species: A (52.6%), C/CA (37.6%) and B (9.6%). However, there was discordance between proposed phylogeny groups when sequences from the 5\u2032UTR and VP4/VP2 coding regions were analysed. Sixteen of the 20 samples that clustered as HRV C in the VP4/ VP2 ML tree segregated as A in the 5\u2032UTR analysis, as did some of the early, well-characterized HRV C strains from New York (EU840952 and DQ875932), 23, 26 San Francisco (EF077279 and EF077280), 25 Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (EF582387) 11 and China (GQ223227). 15 Twelve of 28 sequences with only UTR sequences also segregated along with the above-mentioned reference C strains, branching in two major subgroups within HRV A. These have been labelled in this study as C/A, clustering with C strains, but grouping as A in the 5\u2032UTR region: these formed 30% of the clinical sequences. Huang et al. 15 reported similar clustering of field strains in their study and designated the above C strains (EU840952, DQ875932, EF077279, EF077280, GQ223227 and EF582387) as Ca, a subspecies of HRV C that clustered differently to HRV A, HRV B and HRV C in the UTR. They further showed that HRV Ca subspecies were formed from interspecies recombination in the 5\u2032UTR region. Similar inconsistent clustering of field strains as compared to VP4/VP2 was also reported in the 3D polymerase-coding region as well as 5\u2032UTR region. 30 Three discordant branching events were seen in our analyses.

            "text": ",35 Most studies using the VP1 protein coding region for genetic analysis used multiple degenerate primer pairs on clinical samples or culture isolates to achieve the sequences of interest. Using only cell culture isolates rather than clinical samples to study the variation in phylogenetic relationship among field isolates may not be entirely accurate as cell lines generally favour the selection of certain virus strains, failing to detect other fastidious strains. Sequencing PCR products directly from clinical samples is reflective of a true representation, but the sensitivity of PCR primers varies.Real-time diagnostic PCR primers target the 5\u2032UTR, a region with high interstrain homology, because of the ease of using a single set of primers that detect the majority of HRV strains. However, HRV strains with low copy numbers may remain undetected. In this study, the sensitivity of the 5\u2032UTR sequencing primers and the second set of primers for the amplification of the full length of the VP4 and part of VP2 in comparison with the real-time assay was 92.1% and 69.56%, respectively.20 Unlike others investigators, we did not find co-infections by multiple HRV strains.12,36 Two incidences of household HRV transmission were suggested by the sequences of all samples in each household showing 99% homology.It is unclear whether the severity of infections caused by HRV C species is greater compared to HRV A and HRV B. The mask study had 2.5 times more children than adults who were positive for HRV, but the study selected children with a febrile respiratory illness, with well adult contacts at baseline; children who had specimens collected all presented to a paediatric ED. The majority of these HRV sequences were either C or the C/A variant(16/27). CS07 samples were from patients either presenting to ED or hospitalized and had an equal proportion of HRV C or C/A strains among adults and children. CS09 samples were from adults with an ILI who did not present to hospital during the A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza pandemic; HRV C/Ca infection was seen in only 13%. Overall, there was a greater representation of HRV C/Ca species in the paediatric compared to the adult group (47.9% vs 25.6%, P = .032, Fisher's exact test). All clinical samples",
