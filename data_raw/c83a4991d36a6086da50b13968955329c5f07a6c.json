However, it is not known whether the systemic inflammatory profile is different compared to monomicrobial CAP. We wanted to investigate this profile of mixed viral-bacterial infection and to compare it to monomicrobial bacterial or viral CAP. Methods: We measured baseline serum procalcitonin (PCT), C reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cell (WBC) count in 171 patients with CAP with definite etiology admitted to a tertiary hospital: 59 (34.5%) bacterial, 66 (39.%) viral and 46 (27%) mixed (viral-bacterial).",

CRP was independently associated with mixed CAP. CRP levels below 26 mg/dL were indicative of an etiology other than mixed in 83% of cases, but the positive predictive value was 45%. PCT levels over 2.10 ng/mL had a positive predictive value for bacterial-involved CAP versus viral CAP of 78%, but the negative predictive value was 48%. Conclusions: Mixed CAP has a different inflammatory pattern compared to bacterial or viral CAP. High CRP levels may be useful for clinicians to suspect mixed CAP.",

Available data show that a virus is the only microorganism isolated in between 10% and 30% of immunocompetent adults hospitalized for CAP, and accounts for as much as 40% of cases with established etiology. A bacterium as a co-pathogen of a virus can be found in association with CAP (mixed viral-bacterial pneumonia) [1] [2] [3] [4] and this accounts for as much as 39% of cases in which an etiological agent is identified [1] [2] [3] . In these studies, Streptococcus pneumoniae continues to be the most frequent producer of adult CAP, though frequently in association with a co-pathogen, especially viruses (20%-40%) [2, 3, 5, 6] . It seems logical that, due to the lower sensitivity of techniques usually employed to diagnose bacterial infection, some pneumonias considered to be viral will actually be mixed CAP [3] . This issue, together with the possible isolation of viruses from asymptomatic subjects, suggesting clearance of a past or current subclinical upper airway infection not related to a concomitant CAP, has led to uncertainty as to whether some viruses are the real cause of CAP or whether they must act as a co-pathogen with a bacteria in adults [2, 3, [6] [7] [8] ; the generally accepted opinion is that viruses other than influenza rarely cause pneumonia in healthy adults [9] .",

Clinical signs and symptoms of bacterial and viral pneumonia are highly variable and overlap, and there is no clinical or radiologic algorithm that can discriminate between the two causes of CAP [12] . Some attempts at differentiation based on biomarkers have been made, and it is now well established that CRP and, especially, PCT show higher levels in bacterial than in viral (or atypical) pneumonia [12] [13] [14] . Lack of viral PCT response to viral infection is thought to be related to post-infection release of interferon, which inhibits PCT synthesis [15] .",

The CAPNETZ study included a large number of patients (1337) with CAP, of which 58 (4.3%) showed mixed etiologies; however, this group was heterogeneous, as it included two or more typical or atypical bacteria and combinations of typical with atypical and any bacteria with a virus [10] .",

In fact, other studies have confirmed these differences also including atypicals [11] [12] [13] . The lack of PCT response to viral disease seems to be due to stimulation of macrophages to release interferon, which inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF) synthesis that, in turn, is necessary for tissues to synthesize PCT [15] . In our study, PCT levels were similar in mixed and bacterial CAP, and higher than those of viral CAP, and in terms of CRP, we found that mixed CAP showed significantly higher levels than bacterial and viral pneumonias. This biomarker was the only independent factor associated with mixed etiology. The high NPV for CRP, can help us to suspect an aetiology different than mixed bacterial/viral. However, it is true that its low PPV and AUC limit its usefulness in the clinical setting. Some studies have suggested a potential role of biomarkers in differentiating pandemic influenza A H1N1 CAP from its bacterial coinfection. All these studies were retrospective and involved a limited number of mainly critical (ICU) patients (the largest series included 19 cases of mixed CAP), and found lower levels of PCT [16] and of PCT and CRP [18, 19] in viral CAP than mixed H1N1bacterial CAP, as well as their utility in clinical practice [16, 18, 19] . However, others showed limited sensitivity and specificity [17] . We also found a serum CRP higher in mixed infections involving influenza, but differences could not be achieved for PCT, probably due to low number of our cases (n = 15). With the exception of influenza, there is no information in adults on the behavior of biomarkers in mixed pneumonia. In our study, we found that the inflammatory response was higher in mixed CAP compared to single bacterial and viral CAP. We included mixed viral-bacterial CAP not restricted to the influenza virus in a homogeneous adult group of patients, and both PCT and CRP were different in viral CAP without influenza than mixed CAP without influenza.",

Although increased amounts of biomarkers, especially PCT, have been associated with increased pneumonia severity [10] , this was not the case in our study, as we found no differences in either PSI or CURB56 scores among three etiological groups. Median CRP was highest in mixed CAP, perhaps reflecting an increased level of systemic inflammation, as has been suggested [7] . It is difficult to explain with accuracy why mixed CAP showed higher CRP levels than both viral and bacterial pneumonias. It has recently been suggested that the main etiological agents of CAP present different inflammatory profiles, according to their respective biomarker (CRP, PCT, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6) response, and that host-microorganism interplay may be useful for etiological diagnosis [11] . Our results suggest that mixed bacterial/viral CAP have a predominant CRP response. Findings of investigations approaching usefulness of PCT and CRP for etiological diagnosis of CAP are contradictory [25] . This can be due, at least in part, to the lack of inclusion of mixed bacterial/viral pneumonias in these studies. There were no differences in WBC counts among the three etiological groups.",

We obtained no lower respiratory tract samples (BAL) for viral study, and some of the nasopharyngeal viral findings may have come from concomitant viral upper respiratory infection. We did not use PCR techniques for diagnosing atypical bacteria, and our yield for these pathogens, based in serological testing, was low. Nevertheless, our purpose was to study viruses and bacteria, and atypical findings were excluded. We are aware that some pneumonias classified as viral could, in fact, have been mixed, with a bacteria that could not be identified without a quantified PCR test for bacteria. Finally, a sequential search for biomarkers might have given us more complete information. The major strength of our study is that we compared a very well defined population of mixed CAP to other groups of very well defined bacterial and viral CAP.",

These findings can be useful by clinicians to include antiviral treatment especially during the influenza season, and to suspect a bacterial role in the case of either symptoms suggesting virus involvement or viral isolation. Interestingly our results were similar when we excluded mixed influenza cases. This is the first study to assess biomarkers in a group of mixed viral-bacterial CAP other than influenza, and compared with bacterial and viral adult CAP. The biomarker profile in this group is different from that of viral CAP. This suggests that the inflammatory response to viruses, even excluding influenza, is different from that in mixed CAP and, therefore, that viruses do not always require a bacterial co-pathogen to produce pneumonia in adults. This may help us better understand the true role of viruses in CAP and, perhaps, encourage the development of effective antiviral drugs [8] . Despite their usefulness in some particular cases, we appear to lack an accurate biomarker to separate bacterial-involved CAP from viral CAP in clinical practice.",

Baseline characteristics of CAP patients were compared among the three groups together using ANOVA analysis or Kruskal-Wallis H test depending on the type of variable. Comparisons, except for baseline characteristics, were established between two different groups. In order to compare the values of every biomarker between the different etiologic groups, twogroup comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. For every biomarker the two-group comparisons performed were: bacterial vs mixed; bacterial vs viral; mixed vs viral; mixed vs overall bacterial and viral; and mixed vs unknown. P-values <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.A large number of univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the factors associated with mixed viral-bacterial CAP, includingTable 2Microbial etiologies of the 171 cases of CAP included in the study",
