Despite the introduction of a commercial vaccine in some parts of the world, the majority of the populations at risk of infection remain unprotected against this disease, and there is currently no treatment for DENV infection. Natural compounds offer the prospect of cheap and sustainable therapeutics to reduce the disease burden during infection, and thus potentially alleviate the risk of more severe disease. This study evaluated the potential anti-DENV 2 activity of five natural compounds namely melatonin, \u03b1-tocopherol, folic acid, acetyl-l-carnitine and resveratrol in two different cell lines.",

These results suggest that some commonly taken natural compounds may have beneficial effects on DENV infection, but that others may potentially add to the disease burden.",

It is caused by dengue virus (DENV) which is transmitted by female Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti [2] . Using the population data of 2010 and a geostatistical model, Bhatt and colleagues estimated that approximately 390 million dengue infections occur globally every year, with 96 million symptomatic cases [3] . Other studies have estimated that more than 22,000 deaths are reported annually [4] . Overall, an estimated 3.9 billion people are at risk of dengue virus infection in almost 128 countries in tropical and subtropical regions [5] . Dengue infection can occur with one of four DENV serotypes (DENV 1-4), and cause clinical manifestations ranging from self-limiting febrile illness, dengue fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever which can progress to dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [2] . There is no specific drug to treat DENV infection, and care is mainly supportive [6] . Studies have shown a relationship between viral burden and disease severity [7] , and thus there is interest in compounds that have anti-DENV effects, as these may serve to reduce severity if administered early in infection.",

All compounds were initially screened for cytotoxicity in both cell lines using the MTT assay. Cytotoxic effects were determined for both uninfected cells and DENV 2 infected cells in the range of 0.0001-10 mM (0.1-10,000 \u03bcM) for acetyl-l-carnitine, melatonin and \u03b1-tocopherol, and the range of 0.0001 mM (0.1-5000 \u03bcM) for folic acid and resveratrol, with treatment being undertaken for 24 h. Results showed little difference in cytotoxicity profiles of the compounds between DENV 2 infected and uninfected cells. Thus there was no cytotoxic synergism between the compounds and DENV infection. Melatonin (Fig. 1a, b) , \u03b1-tocopherol (Fig. 2a, b) and acetyl-l-carnitine (Additional file 1: Figure S1A , B) all showed evidence of cytotoxicity at compound concentrations of 10 mM. Folic acid (Additional file 2: Figure  S2A , B) and/or the vehicle showed a slight positive effect in both HEK293T/17and HepG2 cells at concentration of 1 mM, but this was not seen at a higher concentration. Cytotoxicity was observed for resveratrol at concentrations above 0.05 mM in HEK293T/17 cells, and above 1 mM in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3a, b) . Based on the cytotoxicity profiles, two concentrations were selected for each compound for assay of antiviral activity, which were 50 and 500 \u03bcM for acetyl-l-carnitine and melatonin, 0.5 and 1.0 mM for \u03b1-tocopherol, 0.1 and 0.5 mM for folic acid. For resveratrol which showed significant cell type variation in cytotoxicity, values of 25 and 50 \u03bcM were used for HEK293T/17 cells, and 50 and 100 \u03bcM were used for HepG2 cells. For all experiments, infections were undertaken at MOI 0.5 and 2 for HEK293T/17 cells and 2 and 5 for HepG2 cells due to different cell susceptibility to infection [12] .",

Vitamin E has well known antioxidant properties, through its ability to donate a hydrogen group from its free hydroxyl group to the free radical, with the generation of a stable free radical form of vitamin E. However, a number of non-antioxidant activities of vitamin E have been demonstrated [21] . \u03b1-Tocopherol has been reported to have some effects in dengue patients [22] and has proposed benefits for influenza virus A infection [23] , as well as possible activity against hepatitis B [24] and C [25] . In this study, \u03b1-tocopherol showed proviral effects, particularly in HEK293T/17 cells (Fig. 2c) , where the percentage of infection was increased significantly under most condition combinations tested. However, only a small effect was seen in HepG2 cells under conditions of the highest concentration and lowest MOI tested (Fig. 2d) .",

However, infection with DENV 2 in the presence of resveratrol (at 25 and 50 \u03bcM) in HEK293T/17 cells showed a significant reduction in the level of infection (Fig. 3c) , while a slight increase in infection levels was seen in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3d) with the lowest MOI and 50 \u03bcM resveratrol. We observed some background in the flow cytometry with resveratrol ( Fig. 3 ) and this might be related to the protein binding ability of resveratrol [41] . However, subtraction of the background did not alter the result. To further investigate the effect of resveratrol in DENV 2 infection, the effect on virus production was determined by standard plaque assay. The virus titer was determined at 0 h (input virus) and at 24 h post infection. The results (Fig. 3e) showed that, consistent with the reduction in the level of cellular infection (Fig. 3c) , there was a reduction in the level of virus produced with treatment with resveratrol in HEK293T/17 cells at 24 h post infection, but not in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3e) . The reduction of virus output observed was the order of approximately 1log 10 . To determine the EC 50 of resveratrol on virus production, the experiment was repeated in HEK293T/17 cells with concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 \u03bcM resveratrol. Results of the standard plaque assay are shown in Fig. 3f . The EC 50 value was determined as 24.37 \u03bcM. Finally, the experiment was undertaken at a lower MOI of 0.01. Results (Fig. 3f ) showed a dose dependent reduction of virus production, with an EC 50 value of 11.37 \u03bcM. While the reduction in level of infection and virus output is significant in HEK293T/17 cells, it compares poorly to other natural compounds such as andrographolide, which reduces DENV 2 virus output by 2.5log 10 [11] .",
