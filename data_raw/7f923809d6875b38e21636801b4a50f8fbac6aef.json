            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis, which results in considerable economic losses. It is imperative to develop safe and efficient candidate vaccines to control IBV infection. In the current study, recombinant baculoviruses co-expressing the S1 and N proteins and mono-expressing S1 or N proteins of the GX-YL5 strain of IBV were constructed and prepared into subunit vaccines rHBM-S1-N, rHBM-S1 and rHBM-N. The levels of immune protection of these subunit vaccines were evaluated by inoculating specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens at 14 days of age, giving them a booster with the same dose 14 days later and challenging them with a virulent GX-YL5 strain of IBV 14 days post-booster (dpb). The commercial vaccine strain H120 was used as a control. The IBV-specific antibody levels, as well as the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, were detected within 28 days post-vaccination (dpv). The morbidity, mortality and re-isolation of the virus from the tracheas and kidneys of challenged birds were evaluated at five days post-challenge (dpc). The results showed that the IBV-specific antibody levels and the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were higher in the rHBM-S1-N vaccinated birds compared to birds vaccinated with the rHBM-S1 and rHBM-N vaccines. At 5 dpc, the mortality, morbidity and virus re-isolation rate of the birds vaccinated with the rHBM-S1-N vaccine were slightly higher than those vaccinated with the H120 control vaccine but were lower than those vaccinated with the rHBM-S1 and rHBM-N vaccines. The present study demonstrated that the protection of the recombinant baculovirus co-expressing S1 and N proteins was better than that of recombinant baculoviruses mono-expressing the S1 or N protein. Thus, the recombinant baculovirus co-expressing S1 and N proteins could serve as a potential IBV vaccine and this demonstrates that the bivalent subunit vaccine including the S1 and N proteins might be a strategy for the development of an IBV subunit vaccine.",

Inactivated vaccines are not only high in cost but also do not establish long-term immunity. The application of inactivated vaccines alone has frequently failed to induce strong cellular immunity, resulting in little or no protection [14, 15] .

            "text": "IBV consists of four structural proteins. They are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [20] . The S protein is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits [21] . The S1 protein determines the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the virus and plays an important role in the induction of neutralizing and hemagglutination inhibition antibodies, tissue affinity and cell adsorption, all involved in the humoral immune response [22] [23] [24] . The N protein plays an extremely important role in the replication and assembly of IBV, affecting its immunogenicity and is thus involved in the cellular immune response [25] [26] [27] . Hence, the S1 and N proteins are the most promising subunit vaccine candidates against IBV. Therefore, the development of subunit vaccines including both the S1 and N proteins has promising prospects. The baculovirus expression system (BES) is an efficient system for gene expression because of its good safety, high expression and excellent protein processing ability compared to other expression systems. A major advantage of the BES is the ease of scaling up from the laboratory to a large-scale production system [28, 29] . In addition, baculoviruses are insect pathogens and thus non-pathogenic for vertebrates. Therefore, the BES is currently widely used for protein expression and vaccine production. There have been a few studies describing the expression of IBV proteins by BES [18, [30] [31] [32] [33] but none of these studies have focused on developing and evaluating the immune response of a subunit vaccine from the baculovirus which co-expresses S1 and N proteins of IBV.",

Fourteen-day-old SPF chickens were assigned randomly into six groups (n = 10 chickens/group). Each bird in the rHBM-S1-N, rHBM-S1and rHBM-N groups was injected subcutaneously with 0.5 mL (50 \u00b5g) S1-N, S1 and N recombinant proteins, respectively. These proteins were emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant on day 14 and boosted with the same dose of proteins emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant on day 28. Birds in the H120 group, set as a positive control, were injected with the H120 inactivated vaccine. The WT-B group and cell group, serving as negative controls, were set up by replacing the recombinant proteins with emulsified wild-type baculovirus and normal Sf9 cell lysates, respectively. At 14 days post-booster (dpb), all the birds from each group were challenged with 10 5 TOC-ID 50 of the IBV GX-YL5 strain in 0.2 mL by the nasal-ocular route. They were monitored daily for clinical signs, morbidity and mortality and they were then euthanized at 5 days post-challenge (dpc). Any birds that died during the observation period were immediately necropsied. Any remaining birds were euthanized at the end of the observation period. The trachea and kidney samples were collected from each bird aseptically for the re-isolation of IBV. These animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care & Welfare Committee of Guangxi University (approval number GXU2016-011, 25th November 2016) and were performed in accordance with animal ethics guidelines and approved protocols.",

Live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines are commonly used to control this disease. However, live-attenuated vaccines may lead to the occurrence of new serotypes or variants of IBV due to mutation and recombination [11] [12] [13] . Also, inactivated vaccines often fail to induce strong cellular immunity and have the disadvantage of high manufacturing costs [14, 15] . Hence, there is an urgent need to develop new, safe and effective vaccines to control the disease. Recombinant subunit vaccines have been shown to elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses and are very safe [16] [17] [18] . Therefore, subunit vaccines may serve as potential vaccine candidates in the future.",

However, the immune efficacy of subunit vaccine rHBM-N was stronger than that of rHBM-S1 in the generation of cellular immune responses. The results confirmed that the S1 protein and N protein play a major role in humoral and cellular immune responses, respectively, which is in agreement with the previous investigations [23, 26, 35] . The immune efficacy of subunit vaccine rHBM-S1-N was better than that of subunit vaccines rHBM-S1 or rHBM-N in generating humoral and cellular immune responses. The reason for this was that rHBM-S1-N expressed both the S1 and N proteins of IBV and stimulated both the humoral and cellular immune responses simultaneously. Therefore, the subunit vaccine rHBM-S1-N performed better in the activation of virus-specific immune responses. Although the S1 subunit is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies, vaccination with the S1 protein did not confer adequate protection against challenge [17] . A previous study even found that the antigenicity of the N protein is better than that of the S1 protein [36] . In another study, the cell-mediated immune response induced by the N protein was higher than that induced by either the S1 protein or H120 [37] . These results and ours indicate the importance of generating a subunit vaccine that contains both the S1 and the N genes.",

In our study, the antibody levels in the groups rHBM-S1-N, rHBM-S1 and rHBM-N were slightly lower than that of the H120 group at 7 and 14 dpb, which agreed with the previous study [18] . A possible reason for this was that the H120 vaccine was derived from the whole virus and was comprised of almost all the epitopes of IBV. Another reason may be related to the fact that the coated antigen of the ELISA kit used in the study was the Mass-type virus strain. Based on the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, the groups ordered from highest to lowest are the rHBM-S1-N group, rHBM-N group, H120 group and rHBM-S1 group. It was surprising that the cellular immune response in the rHBM-N group was higher than that in the H120 group, although the difference was not found to be statistically significant. A previous study showed that Ac-CMV-S1 induced a significantly better cellular immune response in SPF chickens compared with that induced by the inactivated vaccine [18] , which was consistent with our results. The cell-mediated immune response induced by rHBM-N was higher than that induced by either H120 or rHBM-S1.

There are some possible reasons for this. Firstly, the rHBM-S1-N subunit vaccines contained only part of the whole immunogenicity of the virus. This could not lead to an immune effect that was as good as the whole-virus vaccine H120. Secondly, the cell lysates were used to prepare the oil emulsion vaccines for the chickens' immunizations and it is unknown whether the complicated composition of the cell lysate had an effect on the immunized birds. Thirdly, the immune dose of 50 \u00b5g/bird may be not enough. Doses of 150 \u00b5g/bird were used to immunize chickens in other studies [37, 44] . Finally, two immunizations may be not enough to elicit an effective immune response. A previous study pointed out that at least four immunizations with purified S1 glycoprotein were needed to induce protection against the homologous N1/62 strain challenge [45] . Similarly, three immunizations were performed and only 50% protection was obtained against the homologous IBV in the previous study [32] . In this study, we only immunized the chickens twice with the recombinant proteins; this may be a reason for the low protection conferred by the subunit vaccines.",

Although the subunit vaccine rHBM-S1-N could not provide complete protection against IBV infection, it conferred higher protection than rHBM-S1 and rHBM-N vaccines. Thus, it still can be used as an alternative vaccine for boosting the primary vaccination with traditional vaccine/vaccines against this disease. As we know, IBV continuously evolves and there are scores of serotypes. Little or no cross-protection confers between different serotypes of IBVs [6, 7] . Therefore, universal IBV vaccines that protect against varying serotypes of IBV are imperative. Our results should enable the generation of multivalent vaccines to prevent more serotypes of IBV, especially the newly emerging virus strains. The vaccine rHBM-S1-N can also be applied by combining it with traditional vaccines to reduce the occurrence of variants caused by virus mutations and recombination. Therefore, the subunit vaccine rHBM-S1-N is an alternative to the traditional IBV vaccine. Our study also provides reference and ideas for the development of subsequent new vaccines. Further study is needed to determine the effectiveness of combining the subunit vaccines with traditional vaccines.",

A possible reason could be that the baculovirus induced innate immunity through the Toll-like receptor 9 and MyD88-dependent signaling pathway and stimulates the production of various inflammatory cytokines [46] . Therefore, vaccination with baculovirus alone may result in non-specific immunity, which could provide only a small amount of protection against an IBV challenge.",

It has been reported that the introduction of the HBM signal peptide could increase the expression of foreign proteins, enhance the activity of expressed proteins and achieve the secretion of foreign proteins in the baculovirus system [47] [48] [49] . There have been a few studies about expressing IBV proteins using BES [18, [30] [31] [32] [33] but none of these studies have focused on introduction of the HBM signal peptide into BES to express IBV proteins. Therefore, the HBM signal peptide was introduced in the present study. The results showed that the recombinant proteins S1-N, S1 and N could be expressed both in the culture supernatant and cell lysate. Thus, the introduction of the HBM signal peptide into BES can be applied to express other proteins from other pathogens.",

To our knowledge, this is the first report that proved that bivalent subunit vaccines, including S1 and N proteins of IBV, could induce higher immune responses and provide greater protection against infection. The recombinant baculovirus co-expressing S1 and N proteins could serve as a potential IBV vaccine and a bivalent subunit vaccine including the S1 and N proteins might be a strategy for the development of an IBV subunit vaccine.",
