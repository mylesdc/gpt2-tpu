            "text": "In recent years, affective computing has been actively researched to provide a higher level of emotion-awareness. Numerous studies have been conducted to detect the user's emotions from physiological data. Among a myriad of target emotions, boredom, in particular, has been suggested to cause not only medical issues but also challenges in various facets of daily life. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) together for boredom classification, although these data have potential features for emotion classification. To investigate the combined effect of these features on boredom classification, we collected EEG and GSR data from 28 participants using off-the-shelf sensors. During data acquisition, we used a set of stimuli comprising a video clip designed to elicit boredom and two other video clips of entertaining content. The collected samples were labeled based on the participants' questionnaire-based testimonies on experienced boredom levels. Using the collected data, we initially trained 30 models with 19 machine learning algorithms and selected the top three candidate classifiers. After tuning the hyperparameters, we validated the final models through 1000 iterations of 10-fold cross validation to increase the robustness of the test results. Our results indicated that a Multilayer Perceptron model performed the best with a mean accuracy of 79.98% (AUC: 0.781). It also revealed the correlation between boredom and the combined features of EEG and GSR. These results can be useful for building accurate affective computing systems and understanding the physiological properties of boredom.",

Based on these trends, several studies have been conducted on the acquisition and processing of information, aiming at a higher-level understanding of the collected information. In particular, detection of the user's context, such as their emotional or physical state, is of particular importance because it enables the creation of context-aware systems that adapt their behavior to match the context in which they are used. This branch of computer science is known as context-aware computing. A sub-branch of it, which is the focus of this study, concentrates on classifying emotions using physiological data.",

            "text": "The study of emotion classification belongs to the area of affective computing (AC) that aims to build computer systems capable of detecting and reacting to the user's emotions. The area of AC in computer science is considered to have been established when a seminal paper by Picard [1] was published, and it has since become a vibrant field of study, with some example studies being [2] [3] [4] . To classify emotions in these systems, researchers have three data collection (i.e., measurement) strategies at their disposal [5] : (i) neurological/physiological measurement, which uses sensors to detect changes in the user's body; (ii) subjective self-reporting by questionnaires, diaries or interviews; and (iii) behavioral measurement that is based on expert observations of the participant's behavior. While all these approaches have their specific advantages and disadvantages, as Kim and Fesenmaier [5] suggest, physiological measurement is considered to be particularly objective. In our literature review, we found that a large body of AC studies exists on classifying emotions from physiological data such as electroencephalography (EEG) [2, 6, 7] , galvanic skin response (GSR) [2, [8] [9] [10] [11] , heart rate [2, 10, 11] , and others [12, 13] . However, a higher validity can be achieved by combining more than one measurement strategy. For example, a viable approach, which is employed in this study, is to combine a physiological approach with self-reporting, where the latter is used to verify the existence of the target emotion.",

The model categorizes emotions into four groups by the dimensions of valance and arousal. According to the model, boredom is categorized into the low-valence low-arousal group (red box in Figure 1 ). Despite the simplicity of the way in which the Circumplex model assigns boredom to the third quadrant, boredom is considered a complex emotion as various studies have defined it differently. Vogel-Walcutt et al.'s literature review resulted in 37 definitions of boredom, and concluded that \"boredom occurs when an individual experiences both the neurological state of low arousal and the psychological state of dissatisfaction, frustration, or disinterest in response to the low arousal.\" [27] . The conclusions of Russell's model [26] and Vogel-Walcutt et al.'s definition [27] are thus similar. In contrast, the range of boredom in Eastwood et al.'s definition [28] is wider than that of Russell's model. According to their study, people who are in a low-valence state can feel boredom regardless of the level of arousal. Considering these studies, we conclude that a universally accepted definition of boredom does not exist. Some previous studies regarding boredom categorized it as a trait, while others handled it as a state. The meaning of trait in boredom-related studies is the proneness of an individual to become bored, thus there is a difference between easily becoming bored, and being able to resist boredom. Conversely, the meaning of a state is the current state of boredom that the person is experiencing. Fahlman et al. [29] handled boredom as a trait, while Eastwood et al. [28] and Kim et al. [6] treated it as a state. In this study, we approach boredom as a state. The reason for this is that we hypothesize that, when a person feels bored, changes in their physiological signals can be identified.",

Furthermore, GSR is related to the autonomic nervous system [32] , which is also known to correlate with emotion states, thus GSR can be utilized as a potential source for emotion classification [33] . In the physiological perspective, EEG data are captured from the activity of the brain, which belongs to the nervous system together with GSR. Moreover, the analysis on the characteristics of boredom conducted by Bench and Lench [34] suggested that boredom should be associated with the increased autonomic nervous system activity. This linkage implies that a correlation may exist between boredom, EEG and GSR, but so far it has not been investigated in previous studies. Table 2 presents the methods and the accuracy results of the previous studies that classified boredom using physiological data. Mandryk and Atkins [11] , D'Mello et al. [12] , Giakoumis et al. [8] , and Kim et al. [6] focused on finding correlations between boredom and physiological data using statistical approaches, thus they did not generate classification models. The other reviewed boredom classification studies built classification models using machine learning algorithms and measured the performance of the models. However, these studies did not address the issue of overfitting carefully, making it difficult to guarantee the robustness of the results. Moreover, many previous studies lacked the discussion on the choice of the classification algorithms and only considered a few limited algorithms. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the potential of a wider range of classification algorithms to classify boredom. Considering these facts and shortcomings of previous studies, our study aims to produce reliable performance results based on more diverse machine learning methods. ",

The upper section of Figure 2 shows the EEG sensor, which has four electrodes. According to the instructions from the EEG sensor manufacturer, the electrodes are located at the positions FP1, FP2, TP9, and TP10 of the head [36] . The mapping of head locations was defined by Jasper [38] , and it is used in neuroscience. The EEG data were captured with four electrodes; however, only the data from FP1 and FP2 were utilized. This is because TP9 and TP10 were not attached well on the participants' heads during the data collection, which caused instability in the output data from these electrodes. The EEG sensor captured raw EEG at a 220 Hz sampling rate and provided power spectral density (PSD) values for each electrode. According to the sensor manufacturer, the types of PSD data were absolute band power (ABP), relative band power, and others [36] . The sampling rate of these data was 10 Hz. To calculate ABP, we applied the fast Fourier transform algorithm. We calculated PSD by the following EEG frequency bands [36] : The lower section of Figure 2 illustrates the Grove GSR sensor that was used in this study, along with the finger band electrodes. These electrodes were attached to the index and middle fingers of the participants. The GSR sensor captures micro voltages (MV) between the fingers using the attached electrodes. Furthermore, the sensor calculates skin resistance (SR) utilizing the MV input in ohms. The formula for calculating SR using MV is provided by the sensor manufacturer [37] , and is replicated in Equation (1). The sensor was connected to an Arduino Uno device, and the captured data were transmitted to a computer at a 192 Hz sampling rate: SR = ((1024 + 2 * MV) * 10, 000)/(512 \u2212 MV).",

However, k-fold cross validation is based on a random split of data; thus, when the validation is executed, the produced performance results can be different each time. Therefore, to obtain more reliable performance results, we measured the final models' performance by repeating 10-fold cross validation 1000 times with different seed values. Table 8 presents the mean, maximum and minimum accuracies and AUCs produced by 1000 iterations of the 10-fold cross validation runs for each parameter combination and dataset. Considering the mean accuracy, the MLP algorithm produced the best performance in all datasets. However, when considering the mean AUC values, the RF model outperformed the MLP model on the EEG-GSR combined dataset. The last column of Table 8 reports the average computation time for each run. We measured the average time per cross validation using the last 100 iterations of 10-fold cross validation. MLP took the longest time overall, for example, it took 71 ms on the EEG-GSR combined dataset, which was about 2.7 times longer than RF and 7.5 times longer than NB. The performance on the EEG-GSR combined dataset was better than each individual data performance in all cases. Figure 5 shows the models' final performances using box plots. We observe that the MLP and NB models' performances were more stable than that of RF in 1000 runs of 10-fold cross validation. The mean accuracies of MLP were higher than those of the other models in general. The RF model on the EEG-GSR combined dataset showed a high mean AUC but had a large variance. Muller et al. [42] defined a model's discriminatory ability with AUC as follows: (1) excellent discrimination (AUC >= 0.90), (2) good discrimination (0.80 <= AUC < 0.90), (3) fair discrimination (0.70 <= AUC < 0.80), and (4) poor discrimination (0.60 <= AUC < 0.70). For many of our final models, the AUC was over 0.7, and thus these models can be classified as fair discrimination models. Considering all aspects of our model performance validation, the MLP model classified boredom most reliably on all the datasets. Furthermore, the model using the EEG-GSR combined dataset showed the highest performance, while MLP on the EEG dataset and MLP on the GSR dataset ranked second and third, respectively. Table 9 presents the features that the WSE algorithm selected for each model. These results indicate that the standard deviation of MV was selected for all classifiers that used the GSR datasets. For a more detailed analysis of the selected features, we illustrate the distribution of the selected EEG features by frequency bands and electrodes in Figure 6 . As the left pie chart indicates, the features related to the Alpha and Beta bands were selected more frequently than those of the Delta and Gamma bands, and the Theta band features were not selected by WSE at all. The right pie chart in Figure 6 illustrates the distribution of features by electrodes, where the distribution among FP1 and FP2 is nearly balanced; however, FP2 features were picked slightly more frequently. Figure 7 illustrates the distribution of EEG features by frequency bands for each electrode separately. We find that all selected Alpha band features are concentrated on FP1. In contrast, all selected Gamma band features occur on FP2 as the right pie chart shows. Based on our analysis of Table 9 , Figures 6 and 7 , we conclude that EEG and GSR show some indicators for the classification of boredom. First, the standard deviation of MV strongly correlated with boredom because this feature was selected from both GSR datasets. Second, the Gamma, Alpha and Beta bands have a strong correlation with boredom because these were selected more frequently than the Delta and Theta bands. Third, each frequency band has some correlation with a specific electrode location in boredom classification; for example, all selected Gamma band features belonged to FP2 and all selected Alpha band features belonged to FP1.",

An important property of a good classification model is the robustness of performance over multiple executions. To evaluate this for the selected models, we executed 1000 iterations of 10-fold cross validation with different random seeds. Thus, training data and testing data splits were changed randomly. A good model should be able to produce good classification results for different training and testing datasets. From this aspect, the MLP models classified boredom more robustly than the other models. Furthermore, the EEG-GSR dataset's MLP model (mean accuracy of 79.98%) outperformed the other MLP models in the aspect of mean accuracy. Therefore, our analysis suggests that MLP is generally recommended for classifying boredom from EEG and GSR.",

Shen et al. [2] separated their data into training and testing sets but did not consider the random effect. Giakoumis et al. [9] validated their model with the use of leave-one-out cross validation that validates a model without random effect; however, as we mentioned above, a direct comparison of this study to our study is not reasonable because we used EEG and GSR datasets, while Giakoumis et al.

            "text": "We note that the proposed MLP model's performance (79.98%) is lower than that of the model proposed in our previous study (86.73%) [7] . One of the reasons contributing to this difference is that, as we explained in the paragraph above as well as in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.1, the experimental setting and the way we evaluated the models' performance was modified from the previous study. These changes were made to improve the robustness and generalizability of the results. For example, in our previous study [7] , we acquired multiple samples from one participant's data by splitting them into one-second windows and used these for training; in the current study, we acquired only one sample from each participants' dataset by increasing the window size, thus aiming to increase the independence between the samples. This can help to reduce overfitting and achieve more generalizable results. Moreover, the previous study conducted only one iteration of cross validation, whereas, in the current study, mean accuracies were recorded after 1000 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation to increase the robustness of the results. This approach provides more reliable performance scores especially in the applications where the number of available samples is relatively small as in this study. Although the aforementioned steps taken decreased the accuracy of the final model, the generalizability and reliability of the result were increased.",

As we explained in Section 2, this correlation was not revealed by previous studies. Moreover, our findings are aligned with Bench and Lench [34]'s suggestion that boredom should increase the autonomic nervous system activity, which directly relates to EEG and GSR as data sources. In our feature refinement results, the WSE algorithm recommended the EEG and GSR features on the best performing model for increasing performance. This suggests that the combination of these data correlates with boredom. In particular, Gamma band features were selected for the combined EEG-GSR and the EEG datasets. This indicates that the Gamma band may correlate with boredom, whereas the Alpha, Beta and Delta bands have weaker correlations, and the Theta band has no correlation at all with boredom. Furthermore, the WSE algorithm selected the standard deviation of MV among the GSR features from the combined EEG-GSR and GSR datasets. Consequently, the standard deviation of MV can also be an indicator of boredom.",

We picked MLP, RF, and NB as the most suitable candidate algorithms. After tuning the selected algorithms' hyperparameters, we executed 1000 iterations of 10-fold cross validation with different random seed values to identify the most robust model among these. As a result, we recommended the MLP model which had a mean accuracy of 79.98% on the EEG-GSR combined dataset.

Thus, the recommended models may not be applicable to other age groups and to people with health issues. In addition, we hypothesize that emotion elicitation, and possibly also the manifestation of experienced emotions, is related to culture. We collected the data from Korean participants using non-boredom stimuli that were purposefully picked for this cultural context; therefore, the model may not be applicable to participants coming from other cultures. Regarding the protocol, we did not consider the effect of the order of showing the stimuli because the number of participants was deemed to be insufficient for dividing them into comparison groups. Finally, we used only one type of content to elicit boredom. Other types of contents may give different results about the intensity of the experienced emotion. In our future work, we aim to solve these limitations by collecting more data from a diverse group of users who are exposed to different boredom-evoking stimuli.",
