            "text": "Tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV) are sustained in nature through cycling between mammalian and tick hosts. In this study, we used African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) and Ixodes scapularis tick cells (ISE6) to compare virus-induced changes in mammalian and arthropod cells. Using confocal microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electron tomography (ET), we examined viral protein distribution and the ultrastructural changes that occur during TBFV infection. Within host cells, flaviviruses cause complex rearrangement of cellular membranes for the purpose of virus replication. Virus infection was accompanied by a marked expansion in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) staining and markers for TBFV replication were localized mainly to the ER in both cell lines. TEM of Vero cells showed membrane-bound vesicles enclosed in a network of dilated, anastomosing ER cisternae. Virions were seen within the ER and were sometimes in paracrystalline arrays. Tubular structures or elongated vesicles were occasionally noted. In acutely and persistently infected ISE6 cells, membrane proliferation and vesicles were also noted; however, the extent of membrane expansion and the abundance of vesicles were lower and no viral particles were observed. Tubular profiles were far more prevalent in persistently infected ISE6 cells than in acutely infected cells. By ET, tubular profiles, in persistently infected tick cells, had a cross-sectional diameter of 60-100 nm, reached up to 800 nm in length, were closed at the ends, and were often arranged in fascicle-like bundles, shrouded with ER membrane. Our experiments provide analysis of viral protein localization within the context of both mammalian and arthropod cell lines as well as both acute and persistent arthropod cell infection. Additionally, we show for the first time 3D flavivirus infection in a vector cell line and the first ET of persistent flavivirus infection.

Symptoms of TBEV infection can include fever, malaise, meningitis, and encephalitis.

            "text": "In nature, LGTV and other TBFV maintain a complex cycle between ticks and vertebrate hosts. Historically, Ixodidae ticks (hard ticks) have been considered to be the arthropod vector, but, some findings with Alkhurma virus [5] and Kyasanur Forest virus [6] suggest that the soft-bodied Ornithodoros ticks can transmit TBFV. Thus, the arthropod host-range for TBFV may be greater than assumed. The TBFV present a unique situation because the viruses persistently infect ticks and are maintained by vertical transmission across the developmental instars (larval, nymph, and adult). Horizontal transmission (from tick to vertebrate host) then allows amplification of the frequency of the virus within the tick population, as uninfected ticks feeding upon infected vertebrates can acquire the virus [7, 8] . The primary vertebrate hosts are generally small rodents; however, infection of larger mammals also occurs in endemic areas. Humans are an inadvertent, dead-end host, contracting TBFV via tick bite or less frequently by consumption of milk from infected animals [1] . The impact of TBFV infection on vertebrates can vary considerably; some reports describe persistent infection of vertebrates and vertebrate cell lines [9] [10] [11] while other laboratory studies show severe disease development in infected animals [12] [13] [14] .",

            "text": "Like other members of the family Flaviviridae, LGTV is a singlestranded, positive-sense RNA virus. Upon infecting a cell, the virions are thought to traffic to the endosome, where they undergo structural transformation and fuse with host cell membranes, releasing the 11-kb viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm [15] . The genomic RNA, which can function as mRNA, is translated into an approximately 400 kDa polyprotein [16] that is subsequently cleaved into at least ten proteins by both viral and cellular host proteases [17] . The currently defined complement consists of three structural proteins (Capsid [C] , membrane [M] , and envelope [E]) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [17, 18] . Precise functions for all of the nonstructural proteins are not fully elucidated, but some roles have been determined. NS1 can be found on the cell surface but is known to be secreted [17] and is also detected in perinuclear areas where it is believed to play a part in viral replication [19] ; however, its role has not yet been clearly defined. NS3 is a RNA helicase and also acts as a viral protease using NS2B as a co-factor [20, 21] . NS4A, a small hydrophobic protein, has been implicated in the cellular changes that accompany virus reproduction [22] and has been shown to localize to foci within the perinuclear region of infected cells [23] . NS5 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and methyltransferase [17] ; however, recent implications of LGTV NS5 as an innate immune response antagonist confirms a broader role for this protein beyond genome replication [24] . This broader role is also seen in NS59s wider distribution, being located in cell nuclei, perinuclear regions, and diffusely throughout the cytoplasm [25] . Following synthesis of the viral proteins, the single stranded genome is converted into a doublestranded RNA (dsRNA), which serves as a transcriptional template as well as the viral replicative form. Together with the replication complex, made up of NS1, NS2A, NS3, NS4A, and NS5, dsRNA is found in cytoplasmic, perinuclear foci throughout LGTV infected cells. This dsRNA species is an additional obligatory replicative intermediate.",

These structures are localized in a perinuclear distribution of vastly proliferated membranes which, in the case of cells infected with mosquito-borne flaviviruses, are derived from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [29] [30] [31] . The vesicles are typically 70-150 nm in diameter [28] with a pore-like connection either between vesicles and the cytoplasm or between individual vesicles [30, 31] .",

In Vero cells, extensive areas of altered membrane proliferation (Fig. 7B-D) could be found in the majority of cells, consistent with the expansion of the ER system evident by fluorescence microscopy [27, 29, 30] . In some sections, these regions of proliferation encompassed nearly half of the cytoplasmic area, thus explaining our immunofluorescence results. Single-membrane bound vesicles, ranging in diameter from 60-100 nm, were frequently found within these proliferated ER areas, often occurring in large groups contained within dilated ER cisternae. Single, small groups, and large paracrystalline arrays of virions were readily observed (Fig. 7A) . Infrequently, tubular structures or elongated vesicles were seen (Fig. 7D) . Tubules have been seen in other reports on ultrastructure of mosquito-borne flavivirus mammalian cell infection [30, 45] and mosquito cell infection [26, 46, 47] ; however, no function has been assigned to these tubules.",

Similar to other positive strand viruses, such as Semliki Forest virus [54] , rubella virus [52] , and poliovirus [51] , the flaviviruses induce remarkable alterations in the cytoplasmic membrane system. In our study, Vero cells acutely infected with LGTV show the ER proliferation, vesicle accumulation, and membrane network (Fig. 7B-D) described in earlier studies with mosquito-borne flaviviruses [30, 31] . A number of functions have been ascribed to the alterations, including concentration of viral replication machinery, provision of a solid state platform for viral protein synthesis and replication, and sequestration of viral dsRNA replicative form from innate immune sensors [27, 55, 56] . In general, viral protein distribution in acutely infected tick cells was similar; however, some differences were apparent. Vero cells had higher levels of ER proliferation and rearrangement as well as significantly more viral particles. This may have been the result of the greater level of replication seen in Vero cells but, it is also possible that the differences are the result of a fundamental difference between the two host cell lines.",

By ET, the proliferating membranes are revealed to be a complex anastomosing system of membranes almost certainly derived from ER. In the Semliki Forest virus replicon system containing Kunjin virus proteins, expression of a single flavivirus protein, NS4A, can induce the membrane rearrangements [22] , and similar results have been reported for Dengue virus NS4A [57] , but it is uncertain at this time if this role can be assigned to NS4A in the TBFV.

            "text": "However, study by EM and 3D reconstruction revealed differences between the persistently infected and the acutely infected ISE6 cells. The persistently infected tick cells had greater changes in ER structure and ER abundance (Fig. 7B-D) than the acutely infected cells, although viral titers (Fig. 1B & C) were similar in both settings. However, the most remarkable difference between acute and persistent infection was the number of tubular structures. These structures have been noted infrequently in infected cells [26, 30, 34] , and their relevance in flavivirus replication is uncertain. In our acute mammalian and tick cell experiments, we confirmed these observations and saw tubules only occasionally (Fig. 7D, 8 , and Movies S1, S2, and S3). However, in the persistently infected tick cells, the number of tubules increased dramatically (Fig. 7D, 8C , & Movie S3). While the diameter was similar to that seen in round vesicles (60-100 nm), the length was up to eight times as long. The tubules were often arranged in membrane-bound, fascicle-like bundles ( Fig. 8C and Movie S3). The 3D reconstructions demonstrated that the tubules were closed on each end and, although closely juxtaposed, were not connected by pores to other tubules or to the cytoplasm, unlike the round vesicles. The function of the tubules is obscure at this time, and it is unclear if they represent bona fide features of replication, aberrant structures, or the result of a cellular process to restrict infection. It is possible the tubules may play a role in initiation or maintenance of the persistent infections or if the apparent lack of pores in the tubules is consequential. It Figure 6 .

Tubules may be formed as a result of a failure to correctly gather the membrane to form the round vesicles and pores that are associated with the flavivirus replication complex. Perhaps the lack of pores prevents proper replication or packaging of the viral genome. Additional cell biology or biochemistry studies may shed light on the role of the tubules.",

We have shown for the first time the 3D ultrastructure of acutely and persistently, flavivirusinfected arthropod cells, facilitating the observation of the shift that occurs from round vesicles during acute TBFV-infection to the elongated tubules that dominate persistent infection. Future experiments are needed to better understand the increasing presence of tubules at the site of membrane rearrangement during persistent infection. ",
