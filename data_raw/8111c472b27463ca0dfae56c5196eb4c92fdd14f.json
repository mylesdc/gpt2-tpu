In humans, CPS-CQ is strikingly more efficient than immunization with radiation attenuated sporozoites (RAS), raising the hypothesis that this might be partially due to CQ. Chloroquine, an established anti-malarial drug, is also well known for its immune modulating properties including improvement of cross-presentation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether co-administration of CQ during sporozoite immunization improves cellular responses and protective efficacy in Plasmodium berghei models. Methods: A number of experiments in selected complimentary P. berghei murine models in Balb/cByJ and C57BL/6j mice was performed. First, the effect of CQ administration on the induction of protection and immune responses by RAS immunization was studied. Next, the effect of CQ on the induction of circumsporozoite (CS) protein-specific CD8 + T cells by immunization with P. berghei parasites expressing a mutant CS protein was investigated. Finally, a direct comparison of CPS-CQ to CPS with mefloquine (MQ), an anti-malarial with little known immune modulating effects, was performed. Results: When CQ was co-administered during immunization with graded numbers of RAS, this did not lead to an increase in frequencies of total memory CD8 + T cells or CS protein-specific CD8 + T cells. Also parasite-specific cytokine production and protection remained unaltered. Replacement of CQ by MQ for CPS immunization resulted in significantly reduced percentages of IFN\u03b3 producing memory T cells in the liver (p = 0.01), but similar protection.",

The first topic of investigation was the effect of CQ on immunization by RAS, an established immunization model relying on CD8 + T cell responses, thus potentially benefiting from improved cross-presentation. CD8 + T cells recognizing the immunodominant circumsporozoite (CS) protein can mediate protective immunity [24] . Therefore, the effect of CQ on the induction of CS-specific CD8 + T cells by immunization with P. berghei parasites that express a mutant CS protein containing the model SIINFEKL H-2K b epitope was investigated next. Finally, a direct comparison was performed betweeen CPS-CQ and CPS with mefloquine (MQ), an anti-malarial with little known immune modulating effects [25] [26] [27] , not including improvement of cross-presentation. Akin to CQ, MQ induces arrest of early blood-stage parasites without an effect on pre-erythrocytic parasite stages, allowing full liver-stage development and brief exposure to early blood stages. By performing experiments in these selected complimentary P. berghei murine models, the aim of this study was to explore the effect of CQ on protection and T cell responses after whole sporozoite immunization.",

Despite several reports of enhanced immune responses by CQ in mice and men [21, 23, 32, 19] , only one study has reported improved protection; mice immunized with a heat-inactivated influenza virus showed improved survival rates after challenge infection [20] . The significance of improved immune responses for protection thus remains to be further explored. One cannot assume that improvement of crosspresentation by CQ is applicable to any soluble protein or peptide, or antigens presented in the form of a whole sporozoite. Improvement of cross-presentation of SIINFEKL peptide (OVA 257-264 ) and inactivated influenza virus by CQ in mice have been demonstrated [21, 20] . Here however, CQ administration during sporozoite immunization with SIINFEKL expressing P. berghei sporozoites showed no increase of SIINFEKL-specific CD8 + T cells, suggesting that presentation pathways and effects of CQ might differ between pathogens or antigens. CPS-CQ immunization of C57BL/6j mice requires relatively high and lengthy drug prophylaxis to prevent development of P. berghei infection (K. Nganou-Makamdop, unpublished data). As a result, CPS-CQ mice cumulatively receive much more CQ than the two doses of 800 \u03bcg chloroquine diphosphate salt that were previously shown to improve cross-presentation [21] . Therefore, the effect of this low CQ-dose regimen on RAS immunization was assessed in a separate experiment, but protection levels were not higher than compared to RAS alone, indicating that the choice of CQ dose was not crucial.",

CQ has also been studied extensively for its inhibitory effect on autophagy [17] , but a recent publication suggests that MQ has similar effects on autophagy [36] .
