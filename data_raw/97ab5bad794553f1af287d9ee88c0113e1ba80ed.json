            "text": "We undertook enhanced surveillance of those presenting with respiratory symptoms at five healthcare centers by testing all symptomatic outpatients between November 2013 and January 2014 (winter time). Nasal swabs were collected from 182 patients and screened for MERS-CoV as well as other respiratory viruses using RT-PCR and multiplex microarray. A total of 75 (41.2%) of these patients had positive viral infection. MERS-CoV was not detected in any of the samples. Human rhinovirus (hRV) was the most detected pathogen (40.9%) followed by non-MERS-CoV human coronaviruses (19.3%), influenza (Flu) viruses (15.9%), and human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) (13.6%). Viruses differed markedly depending on age in which hRV, Flu A, and hCoV-OC43 were more prevalent in adults and RSV, hCoV-HKU1, and hCoV-NL63 were mostly restricted to children under the age of 15. Moreover, coinfection was not uncommon in this study, in which 17.3% of the infected patients had dual infections due to several combinations of viruses. Dual infections decreased with age and completely disappeared in people older than 45 years. Our study confirms that MERS-CoV is not common in the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia and shows high diversity and prevalence of other common respiratory viruses. This study also highlights the importance and contribution of enhanced surveillance systems for better infection control.",

Millions of children under the age of 5 die annually due to respiratory infections [1, 2] . While respiratory viruses represent a major cause of ARTIs, their prevalence and transmission are often influenced by several geographic, demographic, and environmental factors [3] . Moreover, the lack of easy and cheap diagnostic methods, the nonspecific symptoms, the large number of associated viruses, and the possibility of mixed infections usually hinder the timely and accurate identification of causative viral agents. Nonetheless, the most commonly detected human respiratory viruses are human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), influenza viruses (Flu), human rhinovirus (hRV), enterovirus (EV), human coronavirus (hCoV), human parainfluenza viruses (hPIV), human adenoviruses (hAdv), and human metapneumoviruses 2 Advances in Virology (hMPV) [4] . Several other emerging respiratory viruses such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and avian influenza viruses (H5N1and H7N9) have also been reported in several other parts of the world.",

First, most previous studies have mainly focused on the annual Hajj pilgrimage [6] [7] [8] [9] which might not accurately reflect locally circulating viral species. Second, while several other studies have investigated viral prevalence in ARTIs within Saudi Arabia, most of these reports have focused on specific viral pathogens [10] [11] [12] [13] . Third, except for the city of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia [5, 11, [13] [14] [15] , there is a very limited number of reports from other regions of the country [12, 16, 17] .",

            "text": "Furthermore, the recent emergence of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, its continued spread, and the associated high mortality rates (35-40%) clearly represent a serious public health and economic concern locally and globally [18] . MERS-CoV is a lineage C betacoronavirus (betaCoVs) [19] which causes symptoms ranging from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe infections associated with acute pneumonia and occasional systemic infection and multiorgan failure [20] . It was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [21] and later from 26 countries in the Arabian Peninsula, Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America [22] . Almost all reported MERS-CoV cases were linked to the Arabian Peninsula. Frequent sporadic cases of MERS-CoV and multiple hospital outbreaks have been reported in several cities in Saudi Arabia including Alahsa, Taif, Jeddah, and Riyadh [23, 24] . Jazan province is located in the southwestern part of Saudi Arabia just north of Yemen. It is the second smallest and the most densely populated province in Saudi Arabia with density of \u223c132/km 2 [25] . So far, there is barley any report on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in this region of the country. Furthermore, while several MERS-CoV surveillance studies have been conducted in several parts of Saudi Arabia, only few reports have examined the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV in Jazan province and found no serological evidence of MERS-CoV circulation in this region [26, 27] . These data are consistent with the overall prevalence pattern of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia especially that only one single MERS case has been reported from this province since 2012 [28] . Therefore, we undertook enhanced surveillance of those presenting with respiratory symptoms at five healthcare centers by testing all symptomatic outpatients between November 2013 and January 2014 (winter time) in southwestern region of Saudi Arabia.",

Specifically, 26 out of 62 children (41.9%) tested positive for one or more viruses. Similarly, 40.1% of all adults who are older than 15 years were infected. The rate of infection in children in our study is lower than previously reported rate in Riyadh (\u223c61%) [13] or in Najran province in the southern region of Saudi Arabia (>74%) [17] (Figure 1 ). However, this difference is expected as both of these previous studies have mainly focused on hospitalized children \u22645 years of age. In contrast, we screened outpatients in primary healthcare settings and used a wider age range which is also consistent with the decrease in detection of respiratory viruses with increasing age (Table 1) . Nonetheless, children in our study represented the largest proportion (34.7%) of all infected patients compared to other age groups.",

On the other hand, detection of other respiratory viruses (hAdv, EV, and hMPVA) comprised 10.2% of all identified viruses. While hRV, Flu A, and hCoV-OC43 were more prevalent in adults older than 15 years, they were detectable in patients from most age groups. In contrast, RSV, hCoV-HKU1, and hCoV-NL63 were mostly restricted to children. Our data clearly suggest that hRV is an important cause of ARTIs in addition to Flu A and hCoV-OC43 during winter season. The overall prevalence of respiratory viruses in this study is in accordance with previous reports of respiratory viruses in children [5, 13, 17] and adults [9, 31] from Saudi Arabia. However, our data showed lower levels of RSV and hMPVA in children compared to studies from Yemen which is in very close proximity to Jazan province [32, 33] . While further studies are clearly required, these differences could be due to the additional risk factors in Yemen especially in children [32, 33] .",

However, it is higher than previously reported rates in children from Saudi Arabia [5, 17] most likely due to the methodological differences between the studies. The most common coinfecting virus was hRV (7/13) and it was detected with most viruses including hAdv, FluA, hRSV, and hCoV-OC43. Other frequently coinfecting viruses were FluA, hCoV-OC43, hRSV, and hAdv. Notably, hCoV-OC43 was the only coinfecting coronaviruses amongst the other non-MERS-CoV coronaviruses. Interestingly, hAdv was more frequently detected in coinfections (4 times) compared to single infections (one time), and all these coinfections were with hRV only. Furthermore, dual infections were more common in children and young adults between 15 and 24 years compared to other age groups. While viral coinfections are very frequent in hospitalized children with ARTIs, the impact of such infections in outpatients is not clear especially that several studies concluded that coinfections may or may not contribute to increased disease severity and the risk for hospitalization [35] [36] [37] [38] . Nonetheless, more studies are required to better understand the clinical impact of coinfections.",

Two centers (3 Advances in Virology and 4) provided more than 77% of the positive cases in the current study, suggesting that these centers may serve a large community in the region compared to the other 3 centers and thus they could represent suitable sentinels for future surveillance studies. The similarity in clinical symptoms and manifestations of patients infected not only by respiratory viruses but also by some bacterial agents represent a hurdle in diagnosis based on clinical presentation. Although we observed some association between viral infection and some clinical symptoms such as running nose, lethargy, and wheezing, the overall array of symptoms were not specific most probably due to the small size of samples in this study. Other limitations in our study included the short studied period (winter season) and focusing of viral agents only. Nonetheless, the rapid advancements in molecular diagnostic methods such as microarray or multiplex PCR should aid in the epidemiological characterization of circulating viruses.",

Furthermore, it shows that MERS-CoV is infrequent in this region of Saudi Arabia compared to other regions most probably due to the limited number of dromedary camels, the reservoir host for MERS-CoV, and consequently their direct contact. Finally, use of multiplex assays such as the one used herein could help in the determination of the spectrum and diversity of respiratory viruses and in the implementation of effective control measures by public health authorities. This work shows the importance of enhanced surveillance in understanding the epidemiology of respiratory infections and therefore applying the appropriate control measures.",
