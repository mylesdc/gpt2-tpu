Mainstream diagnostic assays are challenged by their intrinsic diversity, leading to false negatives and incomplete characterisation. New sequencing techniques are expanding our ability to agnostically interrogate nucleic acids within diverse sample types, but in the clinical setting are limited by overwhelming host material and ultra-low target frequency. Through selective host RNA depletion and compensatory protocol adjustments for ultra-low RNA inputs, we are able to detect three major blood-borne RNA viruses -HIV, HCV and HEV. We recovered complete genomes and up to 43% of the genome from samples with viral loads of 10 4 and 10 3 IU/ml respectively. Additionally, we demonstrated the utility of this method in detecting and characterising members of diverse RNA virus families within a human plasma background, some present at very low levels. By applying this method to a patient sample series, we have simultaneously determined the full genome of both a novel subtype of HCV genotype 6, and a co-infecting human pegivirus. This method builds upon earlier RNA metagenomic techniques and can play an important role in the surveillance and diagnostics of blood-borne viruses.",

In combination with NGS, partial genomes of novel viruses have been detected by this method 28, 29 . As with non-depleting methods, extensive further work is needed to fully characterise detected viruses, and when applied to diagnostic virology, the read depths and genome coverages remain low even at high viral loads 30-33 . Most groups selectively deplete rRNA by hybridising rRNA-specific DNA 'scissor probes' to the extracted nucleic acids, and digesting the rRNA/DNA duplexes with RNAse H 34, 35 .

Hence the three main aims of metagenomic virology are to detect & identify known agents irrespective of their diversity, to discover novel agents of disease, and to obtain complete sequence information of detected viruses. Most existing protocols achieve a maximum of two of these aims, but difficulties in selectively isolating viral RNA species and short read sequences from those of the super-abundant host nucleic acid have limited the utility of metagenomic approaches in diagnostic virology. This study has addressed these limitations by establishing a novel methodology suitable for the agnostic detection and characterization of blood-borne RNA viruses in plasma samples. By depleting host-derived nucleic acids and making modifications to an existing library preparation protocol to account for ultra-low RNA input quantities, we have been able to reconstruct effectively full-length genomes of HCV, HEV and HIV from plasma samples with viral loads of 10 4 IU/ml (copies/ml for HIV) and substantial fractions of complete genomes at 10 3 IU/ml. When applied to a series of clinical samples, we could elucidate simultaneously the full genome sequences of both a novel subtype belonging to HCV genotype 6 and a hitherto-undetected human pegivirus. Additionally, our system was able to recover viral sequences from a panel of diverse RNA viruses diluted in human plasma, with a broad correlation between the genomic coverage and depth metrics and approximate concentration. Although full genomes were not assembled in many cases, the independence of read distribution gave sufficient genome coverage for identification.",

Firstly, we selected an extraction method that combined a phenol/chloroform step with a column format (Lexogen SPLIT RNA) which increased the amount of extracted viral RNA by up to one log when compared to other extraction methods (data not shown). Perhaps more importantly, by controlling the final precipitation step, small RNA molecules below 150 nt such as 5 S rRNA and tRNA are excluded from the eluates, as are the majority of molecules of human genomic DNA.",

At an influenza A virus concentration of over 10 5 copies/ml, this dropped to just 0.5%, and at a reovirus concentration of 10 3 -10 4 copies/ml, no viral reads were detected 24 . With our method, whole genomes were obtained for those with the highest viral loads, and for minority viral targets, there was a correlation between ostensible quantity and coverage, including for two viruses undetectable by the panel distributor 42 , a result superior to that recently obtained from influenza in clinical respiratory samples 65 . Again, the presence of high quantities of one or more target is likely to have inhibited the representation of the minority species such that if tested individually, superior depths and coverages would seem likely. With further reduction to the fragmentation time, or even its abolition, it may be possible to use this method to reconstruct genomes from old, partially degraded samples such as those recently used to re-evaluate the early HIV epidemic in the Americas 66 .",

Complex bioinformatic processing has been employed to identify viruses within a metagenomic dataset 7, 25, 26, 32, 64, 65 , but here, only simple bioinformatic processing is needed for detection and identification of known viruses, and by applying only moderately more advanced tools, an agnostic approach to virus detection can be taken, together with characterisation of the full genome even at low viral loads.",
