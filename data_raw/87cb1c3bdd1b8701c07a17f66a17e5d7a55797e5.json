            "text": "Virus-derived small RNA can be assembled into long contig sequences. (A) Distribution of contigs assembled using our small RNA metagenomics strategy along the reference genomes of DCV, VSV and SINV. (B) Small RNA size profile of DCV, VSV and SINV utilized for laboratory infections in Drosophila. Unknown contigs classify small RNA libraries in a host-specific manner.Clustering of libraries based on sequence similarity of unknown contigs is able to group libraries based on insect species. Contig clustering by similarity was performed using the BLASTClust program within the standalone BLAST package, requiring 50% of length with at least 50% of identity between contigs. the unclassified Laem Singh virus (LSV) (also its top BLASTP hit) at 91% bootstrap confidence. The p-distance between HTV virus and Laem Singh virus is 0.57. The unclassified Ixodes scapularis-associated viruses 1 and 2 are the next nearest neighbours at p-distances of 0.68. The p-distances to the genera Sobemovirus and Polerovirus range from 0.72 to 0.77. Assignment of HTV virus to a genus is not possible, although we tentatively assign it to the Luteoviridae family. Dinucleotide analysis also clusters HTV and LSV together separate from other characterized viruses. (C) Two sandlfy reoviruses, LPRV1 and LPRV2, cluster within the genus Cypovirus, whereas the reovirus from fruit flies, DRV, appears as an outlier on the genus Fijivirus. We assign all three viruses to the family Reoviridae, sub-family Spinareovirinae. LPRV1 and LPRV2 have p-distances of 0.67 and 0.60 respectively to their nearest cypoviruses. The p-distance from DRV to the nearest Fijivirus is 0.75, and its p-distances to the cypoviruses range from 0.82 to 0.84. Dinucleotide analysis of reoviruses reinforces the classification suggested by phylogeny. (D) The sandfly virus, LPNV, clusters within the genus Alphanodavirus genus in the family Nodaviridae. The p-distance from LPNV to its top BLASTP hit, Nodamura virus, is 0.51, and its p-distances to the other members of genus Alphanodavirus range from 0.50 to 0.57. Its p-distance to the Betanodavirus outgroup sequence is 0.73. p-distances from the other members of genus Alphanodaviruses in the tree to the Betanodavirus outgroup are in the range 0.73 to 0.76. There is no bootstrap support for definition of a nearest neighbor for LPNV. Dinucleotide analysis reinforces the classification of LPNV within genus Alphanodavirus. (E) Norovirus is used as an outgroup as it has the third-best (but very poor) BLASTP hit to DUV found in fruit flies. The p-distance from DUV to both Rosy apple aphid virus and Acyrthosiphon pisum virus is 0.72. Both of these viruses are taxonomically unclassified and therefore no family assignment can be made for DUV. Small RNA size profile of representative contigs derived from animal, bacterial and fungal sequences. The small RNA size profile of representative non-viral contigs derived from different taxa are shown. Blue and red represent small RNAs in positive and negative strands, Polymerase and capsid segments from HTV and DAV show similarity to different viral families. (A) Phylogenetic analysis of the HTV capsid and best BLASTP hits suggests it is more similar to DAV while HTV RdRP is most similar to other uncharacterized viruses and the Luteoviridae family (Supplementary Figure S3B). Tetnovirus 1 is used as an outgroup as it has the thirdbest (but very poor) BLASTP hit to HTV capsid. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of the DAV RdRP and best BLASTP hits suggests it is more similar to viruses from the family Permutotetraviridae, 100% bootstrap at p-distance of 0.0009 to Drosophila melanogaster tetravirus,. ORF organization and domain analysis of viral sequences identified by our strategy. Viral contigs are shown in the same scale highlighting predicted ORFs and conserved protein domains. The status of the virus sequence relative to the expected complete genome and presence of start/stop codons are shown. Annotation status of novel viral sequences followed the guidelines previously described by Ladner et al (39). Analysis of B2-like protein from LPNV. Protein sequence alignment between a putative protein encoded by RNA 1 of LPNV and other B2 proteins derived from Alphanodaviruses. Despite high conservation, protein alignment of suggests the LPNV B2-like protein lacks several conserved residues within the putative dsRNA Binding Motif (dsRBM).ORF structure and small RNA profile of unknown viral sequences identified in small RNA libraries from U4.4 cells. (A) Contigs U4.4.84 and U4.4.85 have incomplete ORFs with no conserved domains. The second incomplete ORF of contig U4.4.84 shows similarity to Megavirus terra 1. (B) Small RNAs with a canonical siRNA profile mapping to contigs U4.4.84 and U4.4.85 are also found in libraries from Aag2 cells prepared in the same laboratory.",
