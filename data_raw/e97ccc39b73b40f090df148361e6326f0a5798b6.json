We previously demonstrated that patients with H5N1 disease had unusually high serum levels of IP-10 (interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10). Furthermore, when compared with human influenza virus subtype H1N1, the H5N1 viruses in 1997 (A/Hong Kong/483/97) (H5N1/97) were more potent inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-a) and chemokines (e.g. IP-10) from primary human macrophages in vitro, which suggests that cytokines dysregulation may play a role in pathogenesis of H5N1 disease. Since respiratory epithelial cells are the primary target cell for replication of influenza viruses, it is pertinent to investigate the cytokine induction profile of H5N1 viruses in these cells.",

The subsequent re-emergence of human H5N1 disease in southern China [4] , Vietnam [5] , Thailand and Cambodia [6] has raised the specter of a new influenza pandemic. While human-tohuman transmission of the H5N1 subtype influenza virus appears to be inefficient so far, the disease has exceptional severity in those affected with reported mortality rates ranging from 33% in Hong Kong in 1997 to 55% in Thailand and Vietnam in 2004. The reasons for this unusual severity of human disease have remained unclear.",

In primates experimentally infected with H5N1/97 virus, the type I and II pneumocytes and alveo-lar macrophages were found to contain viral antigen [16] . Virus infection of alveolar pneumocytes was also demonstrated in the lung of a patient with fatal H5N1 disease [17] . Human alveolar epithelial cells are vital for the maintenance of lung function and the pulmonary airblood barrier. In addition, human respiratory epithelial cells respond to viral infections by mounting a cytokine response that contributes both to the innate and adaptive host defenses [18] . Furthermore, type II pneumocytes express class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in vivo [19] . Expression of class II MHC is usually limited to specialized cells of the immune system whose role is to present foreign antigen to helper T cells [20, 21] . The expression of these molecules on alveolar epithelial cells is likely to be of relevance to the adaptive immune response. Therefore it is important to study cytokine responses induced by infection of epithelial cells with influenza viruses including H5N1 viruses.",

The research protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Hong Kong and Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster. Human type II pneumocytes were isolated using a modification of the methods previously described [19, 23] . Briefly, after removing visible bronchi, the lung tissue was chopped into pieces of >0.5 mm thickness using a tissue chopper, washed with balanced salt solution (BSS, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 10 mM HEPES, 5.5 mM glucose, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C three times to partially remove macrophages and blood cells. The tissue was digested using a combination of trypsin (0.5%, GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and elastase (2 units/ml, Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) twice for 15 min at 37\u00b0C in a shaking water-bath. The partially digested tissue was minced in the presence of 40% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in DMEM/F12 medium and DNase I (350 units/ml) (GIBCO BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and cell clumps dispersed by repeatedly pipetting the cell suspension for 10 minutes. After filtration through gauze and a 40 \u00b5m cell strainer to ensure a single cell suspension, the cells were incubated with a 1:1 mixture of DMEM/F12 medium and small airway growth medium (SAGM, Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc., Maryland, USA) containing 5% FBS and 350 units/ml DNase I, on tissue-culture treated plastic Petri dishes in a humidified incubator (5% CO 2 , 37\u00b0C) for 2 hours in order to let macrophage attach on the plastic surface. The non-adherent cells were layered on a discontinuous Percoll density gradient (densities 1.089 and 1.040 g/ml) and centrifuged at 25 \u00d7 g for 20 min. The cell layer at the interface of the two gradients was collected and washed four times with BSS to remove the Percoll. To remove remaining alveolar macrophages, the cell suspension was incubated with magnetic beads coated with anti-CD-14 antibodies at room temperature for 20 min under constant mixing. After the removal of the beads using a magnet and assessment of cell viability by trypan-blue exclusion, the purified type II pneumocyte suspension was suspended in SAGM supplemented with 1% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, and plated at a cell density of 300,000 cells/cm 2 . The cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO 2 , 37\u00b0C) under liquid-covered conditions, and growth medium was changed daily starting from 60 hours after plating the cells.",

The quantification of influenza M-gene copies at 3 and 6 hours after infection in cells infected with H5N1 and H1N1 viruses showed comparable results at 3 and 6 hours post-infection ( Figure 4B) . Similarly, the infectious viral yield at 24 and 48 hours post-infection from alveolar epithelial cells infected with H5N1 and H1N1 viruses were not significantly different ( Figure 4C ).",

Thus, the observed differences of mRNA are reflected in levels of cytokine and chemokine proteins secreted (Figure 8 to 10 ).

Our inabil-ity to detect any interferon-beta proteins in our experiments in spite of marked induction of mRNA is probably related to the limited sensitivity of the interferon beta ELISA. A more sensitive bioassay for interferon-beta may be required for this purpose. The type II pneumocytes used in these experiments were derived from a total of 13 donors and each set of experimental data is based on the results of at least three separate experiments from three donors therefore excluding a donor specific artifact. The cial source and comes from one donor. However, since the results from these cells are broadly in line with those from the type II pneumocytes, again, we think that donor specific artifacts are unlikely to explain the results we have obtained. Finally, these results are also comparable to our previous observations from primary human monocyte derived macrophages [12] with the exception that in contrast to macrophages, no TNF alpha and IL-1 beta was induced in respiratory epithelial cells by any of the viruses tested.

The H5N1/04 viruses, A/Vietnam/ 1194/04 and A/Vietnam/3046/04 represent the Z genotype viruses that emerged as the dominant virus genotype affecting poultry in south-east Asia [27, 35] . Thus there appears to be an association between the property of hyper-inducing cytokines and high virulence. Additionally, in pig epithelial cells, H5N1/97 viruses were found to resist the antiviral effects of interferon [36] and this may also be relevant in pathogenesis. It is notable that patients with avian influenza (H5N1) disease appeared to have higher levels of IP-10 in their sera than those with infections with the human influenza viruses [4] providing in vivo data that parallels our present findings in vitro. Studies on recombinant viruses bearing the HA and NA of the 1918 \"Spanish flu\" pandemic virus showed that these viruses have enhanced virulence for mice and induce higher levels of macrophage-derived chemokines in vivo in mice [37] . However, such observations of hyper-induction of cytokines in vivo may simply reflect more extensive replication of the respective virus. The studies in vitro with H5N1 viruses exclude such potential confounding factors and it would be relevant to study the cytokine profiles of the 1918 recombinant viruses in in vitro models similar to those described here.",

Culture supernatants from influenza virus-infected human respiratory epithelial cells collected at 3 h, 6 h and 24 h after infection with H5N1 and H1N1 viruses were tested by ELISA for IP-10 (Figure 8), Interleukin-6 (Figure 9) and RANTES (Figure 10). The IP-10, Interleukin-6 and RANTES mRNA levels were assayed at 3 h and 6 h post infection (data not shown) with results comparable with that shown in figure 5 and 7.

Viruses were initially isolated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. They were cloned by limiting dilution, and seed virus stocks were prepared in MDCK cells. Virus infectivity was assessed by titration of tissue culture infection dose 50% (TCID 50 ) in MDCK cells.

H5N1 viruses isolated from patients with H5N1 disease in Hong Kong in 1997, Vietnam in 2004 and human influenza viruses of the H1N1 subtype all replicate with similar efficiency. Increase in the MOI of the H1N1 virus did not result in an increase of cytokine responses to levels comparable to that of the H5N1 viruses. The cellular mechanisms underlying this differential cytokine hyper-induction by H5N1 viruses are presently poorly understood. Studies on the transformed bronchial epithelial cell line A549 previously demonstrated that toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) is involved in the influenza virus A initiated cytokine responses",
