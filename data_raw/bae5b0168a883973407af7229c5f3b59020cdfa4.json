            "text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are known to detect a defined spectrum of microbial structures. However, the knowledge about the specificity of teleost Tlr factors for distinct pathogens is limited so far. We measured baseline expression profiles of 18 tlr genes and associated signaling factors in four immune-relevant tissues of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Intraperitoneal injection of a lethal dose of Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida induced highly increased levels of cytokine mRNAs during a 72-hour postinfection (hpi) period. In contrast, only the fish-specific tlr22a2 and the downstream factor irak1 featured clearly increased transcript levels, while the mRNA concentrations of many other tlr genes decreased. Flow cytometry quantified cell trafficking after infection indicating a dramatic influx of myeloid cells into the peritoneum and a belated low level immigration of lymphoid cells. T and B lymphocytes were differentiated with RT-qPCR revealing that B lymphocytes emigrated from and T lymphocytes immigrated into head kidney. In conclusion, no specific TLR can be singled out as a dominant receptor for A. salmonicida. The recruitment of cellular factors of innate immunity rather than induced expression of pathogen receptors is hence of key importance for mounting a first immune defense against invading A. salmonicida.",

More than 20 TLRs clustered in six subfamilies have been identified in more than a dozen of fish species [5] [6] [7] (Figure 1 ). They provide a wide spectrum for recognizing the plethora of aquatic pathogens. Upon ligand binding, TLRs dimerize and undergo conformational changes to recruit the Myddosome to the activated toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain (TIR) [8] . In mammals, this helical structure consists of six MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88) adaptor molecules, onto which a layer of four IRAK4 (interleukin-1 receptorassociated kinase 4) serine/threonine kinases and another layer of four IRAK2 or IRAK1 factors are assembled [8] . The composition of teleost Myddosome is unknown so far, although functional interaction of the complex Myd88-IRAK4a with the TIR domain has been reported [9] . However, no IRAK2 factor has yet been found in any teleostean fish species [5, 6] .",

This TLR-MYD88-IRAK-TRAF6 signaling pathway is well conserved, not only in vertebrates but also in Drosophila [11, 12] .

Pathogenic challenges induce not only the massive activation of proinflammatory mediators [14] [15] [16] [17] , but also enhanced transcription of tlr-encoding genes in fish [18] [19] [20] as reported previously for mammals [21] [22] [23] . The dominant MAMP from Gram-negative bacteria is lipopolysaccharide (LPS), known in mammals to be specifically and solely recognized by TLR4 [24] . No TLR4 ortholog has been identified so far in salmonid fish, and LPS recognition in bony fish is unclear to date [6, 25, 26] . Moreover, modulation of the expression pattern of the entire TLR panel in response to A. salmonicida has not been reported from rainbow trout. We therefore profiled the expression of 13 tlrs belonging to five subfamilies of Journal of Immunology Research 3 these receptors ( Figure 1 ) in immune tissues (spleen, head kidney, liver, and thymus) from healthy and A. salmonicidainfected rainbow trout. Moreover, we also included other genes encoding downstream factors of TLR signaling into analysis, that is, the TLR adapter myd88 [27] ; the key kinases irak4a [9] and irak1; the NF-B-activating factor traf6; and the inhibitor of TLR signaling, tollip [28] . This panel of candidate factors should provide a comprehensive overview of the transcriptional regulation of TLR signaling in trout during A. salmonicida infection.",

Regarding the tissue-specific expression, we found that all 13 tlr genes were significantly expressed in spleen, head kidney, liver, and thymus ( Figure 2 (a)). However, we observed large differences in basal levels of tlr transcripts. Spleen tissue featured the highest mRNA concentrations of almost all the Tlr-encoding genes, as frequently found in other fish species [26] . The copy numbers ranged from a minimum of 0.12 \u00b1 0.02 \u00d7 10 6 (tlr5) to a maximum of 1.3 \u00b1 0.18 \u00d7 10 6 copies (tlr21) per g RNA. The concentrations in head kidney amounted to approximately one-third of the values found in spleen with tlr5 featuring the lowest abundance of only 7% of the level in spleen. Levels in liver were generally much lower than in spleen, amounting for eleven of the considered tlr genes on average to less than 10% of the levels as recorded in spleen. Yet, tlr5 and tlr3 were found to be exceptional since their mRNA concentrations reached 163% and 58% of those values measured in spleen. We could not find distinctive tissue-specific expression profiles distinguishing the expression levels of the known transmembrane tlr genes (e.g., tlr1, tlr2, and tlr5) from those of the known endosomal tlrs (tlr3, tlr7, tlr8a1, tlr8a2, and tlr9) or of the fish-specific tlrs (tlr19, tlr20, tlr21, tlr22a1, and tlr22a2), the latter belonging all to the TLR11 family ( Figure 1 ). Comparing the relative expression intensities between the various tlr genes, we recorded the highest mRNA abundances (>220,000 transcripts/ g RNA) for tlr9, tlr20, and tlr21 in spleen, head kidney, and thymus, while tlr5 and tlr19 were found to be expressed on comparatively low levels in those tissues (<160,000 transcripts/ g RNA).",

The data are visualized in Figure 4 and listed in Table 3(a) . Surprisingly, from the 13 tlr genes studied, only the expression of tlr22a2 was clearly and quickly induced in head kidney (6 hpi: 6-fold; 12 hpi: 4-fold over controls) and liver (12 and 48 hpi: 4-fold over controls) in the infected trout. The genes encoding Tlr9, -19, and -20 were induced in liver to a low extent (2-to 3-fold; < 0.05). Transcript levels of tlr1 and tlr22a1 remained stable over time and those encoding Tlr2, -3, -5, -7, -8a1, -8a2, -9, -21, and Nod1 were even downregulated (<4-fold) in spleen or head kidney. No downregulation was found for any of our candidate downstream factors of TLR signaling in any of the four tissues ( Figure 4 ; Table 3 (b)). Levels of all these factors remained virtually stable in thymus during the entire infection period. In contrast, all these factors were significantly upregulated in liver, at least at some time point during infection. The mRNA concentration of myd88 was most prominently upregulated (>6-fold, 12 hpi and 72 hpi) and remained on elevated levels throughout. The traf6 mRNA concentration rose at 12 hpi to a subsequently sustained 2-fold increased level. The mRNA concentration of tollip was raised at 24 hpi by \u223c3-fold and increased further until 72 hpi. The induction profile of irak1 was remarkable in so far as it significantly increased >2fold in three organs, spleen, head kidney, and liver already 6 hpi. This elevated level was sustained in liver throughout the infection period ( > 0.05 at 24 and 48 hpi), while it clearly dropped down later compared to 12 hpi in spleen and head kidney.",

Prominent feature of our comprehensive survey of tlr expression during infection was that their expression was only moderately regulated, if at all. We conclude from this observation that A. salmonicida infection strongly induced proinflammatory mechanisms but failed to induce those pathways controlling the expression of genes encoding TLRs and associated factors. TLR expression is known to be regulated by the JAK/STAT signaling cascade [43] and hence our data hint, by inference, that also the latter signaling cascade was not largely activated by the infection.",

The broad spectrum of apparent \"ligands\" for this factor suggests that its interaction with MAMPs can structurally not be similar to the sophisticated key-lock principal as known from mammalian TLRs interacting with their specific ligands [54, 55] . Perhaps Figure 6 : Dynamics of T and B cell migration in head kidney after infection. Ordinate shows the relative number of mRNA copies (per g total RNA) encoding the T cell receptor beta (TRB) and immunoglobulin M (Ighm) inhead kidney of five individuals/time point at various times after infection (abscissa). Values are given as mean \u00b1 SEM. Note that the relative quantity is presented on a log10 scale. Asterisks denote statistical significance with < 0.01 ( * * ) and < 0.05 ( * ) compared to controls above (ighm) and below (trb) the graph. Statistical significance was assessed with a double sided -test. trout Tlr22a2 senses some endogenous DAMPs resulting from Aeromonas-induced traumata rather than exogenous MAMPs as previously discussed by Ingerslev et al. [14] . However, assuming ligand-independent activation of Tlr22a2 expression is even more puzzling since we noted in our original description of the twin receptors Tlr22a1 and Tlr22a2 [47] that both factors share a high degree of identical amino acid residues (94%), with most of the few exchanged residues being located in the N-terminal, distal leucine-rich repeat region (LRR). LRRs are known as ligand-binding areas of TLRs. We also note that the expression of both Tlr22a twin factors is not coregulated since only one of them was upregulated.",

Upregulated mRNA concentrations of such factors in liver were reported from a variety of challenge studies and infection experiments in different fish species [56] [57] [58] [59] . Irak1 was distinct from all those other factors in so far as its mRNA abundance was increased already at 6 hpi, not only in liver, but also in spleen and head kidney. Early stimulation of the expression of this factor in several immune organs connects its activation to the very early events of mounting an immune defense. A prominent function of IRAK1 in mammals is its integration into the Myddosome, which is built up around the activated TIR domain of TLRs [8] . Viral infection of the grass carp was demonstrated to recruit Irak1 to the cell membrane possibly indicating that it is recruited to transmembrane TLRs [58] . Relating this information with our data could suggest that rate-limiting low levels of irak1 factors might constrain TLR signaling in healthy trout and its organs. Given the absence of strong transcriptional tlr regulation in trout, this would conceptually allow shifting the regulatory level of the TLR signaling cascade away from the transcriptional regulation of some key receptors (such as TLR2 and TLR4 in mammals) towards the expression level of rate-limiting downstream factors.",

This almost instantaneous reaction against the invaders was in stark contrast to the sluggish modulation of the expression of factors contributing to the TLR signaling cascade. Recognizing the presence of pathogens by the host activated vibrantly the immune defense. The first step consisted of mounting a massive cellular defense to fight off the bacteria rather than inducing resilience or tolerance. Those myeloid cells (conceivably monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes), having been recruited into the peritoneum, belong to the cellular arm of innate immune defense. The second step of harnessing cellular immune mechanisms consisted of activating lymphoid cells, which belong to the adaptive branch of immune defense. The activation of adaptive immunity involves timeconsuming processes such as induction of cell proliferation and cellular redifferentiation. Only then, significant amounts of cells might start migrating out from their site of proliferation and maturation to the site of infection. Our RT-qPCR data suggest belated onset of adaptive immunity, which was not surprising. It took more than 12 hpi for a considerable amount of the cells of the B-type lineage to probably move out from their reservoir in the head kidney [61] into the peritoneum. At the same time, the T lymphocytes presumably started moving into this organ, conceivably to be functionally primed by relevant antigen-presenting cells.",

However, even the severe infection with high doses of this Gram-negative pathogen only modestly regulated the expression of most tlr genes in immune organs indicating a mainly constitutive expression of these factors. We suggest that the limited abundance of Irak1 constrains their activity. No specific TLR could be singled out as a dominant receptor for perceiving the presence of A. salmonicida, albeit that Tlr22a2 was quickly and strongly induced after infection. Rather, this factor is known to be regulated by several nonrelated stimuli and might serve as unspecific alarm switch. The massive recruitment of granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages into the peritoneum highlights their pivotal importance. Hence, recruitment of cellular factors of innate immunity rather than induced expression of pathogen receptors is of key importance for mounting a first immune defense against invading A. salmonicida.",
