We recently reported that dendritic cells (DCs) infected with BV stimulated antitumor immunity. The recombinant BV (rBV) also strongly stimulated peptide-specific T-cells and antitumor immunity. In this study, the stimulation of an immune response against EG7-OVA tumors in mice by a recombinant baculovirus-based combination vaccine expressing fragment C-ovalbumin (FrC-OVA-BV; rBV) was evaluated. Results: We constructed an rBV expressing fragment C (FrC) of tetanus toxin containing a promiscuous MHC IIbinding sequence and a p30-ovalbumin (OVA) peptide that functions in the MHC I pathway. The results showed that rBV activated the CD8 + T-cell-mediated response much more efficiently than the wild-type BV (wtBV). Experiments with EG7-OVA tumor mouse models showed that rBV significantly decreased tumor volume and increased survival compared with those in the wild-type BV or FrC-OVA DNA vaccine groups. In addition, a significant antitumor effect of classic prophylactic or therapeutic vaccinations was observed for rBV against EG7-OVA-induced tumors compared with that in the controls.",

These antimetastatic effects involve BV directly activating NK cells by inducing the upregulation of NK cell effector function against the tumor in a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)dependent manner [8] .

In the rBVimmunized spleen cells treated with the control peptide HIV-1 Gag, the level of OVA-specific IFN-\u03b3 was decreased to that observed in the wtBV control. On the other hand, as determined by the CD8 + T-cell IFN-\u03b3 assay, the rBV, wtBV and FrC-OVA-pVAX1-CAG-MCS groups showed higher levels of CD8 + T-cell IFN-\u03b3 than the PBS control group (Fig. 2c and d) .

The results are representative of three independent experiments with six mice per group, and the error bars indicate the standard deviations of the mean values. * P < 0.05 (Student's t-test) viral vectors, adenovirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV) have a much lower risk of insertional mutagenesis and have been tested for oncolytic virotherapy [19] [20] [21] . Adenoviral vectors will elicit antiviral immune responses following the first administration with a large dose of the vector because the virus is highly immunogenic [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . This reaction might preclude further use of vectors or make subsequent use less effective. Recently, certain nonhuman viral vectors, including BV, have been explored as gene therapy vectors. Previous studies focused on the use of BVs as vaccines in gene therapy, as BVs do not replicate in mammalian cells and have low cytotoxicity and favorable biosafety features [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Kim et al. used BV as a delivery system to introduce telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) as a potential tumor-associated antigen for cancer immunotherapy [29] . In immunocompetent mice, BV-TERT induced IFN-\u03b3 T cells specific for TERT and NK cell activity in mouse splenocytes [29] . Since surface modification of the BV envelope by the vesicular stomatitis G (VSV-G) membrane protein improves BV transduction in vitro or in vivo, the display of the VSV G protein (VSVG) and heterologous peptide/protein via the GP64 anchor are the most widely adopted methods for enhancing the in vitro and in vivo gene transduction efficiency of recombinant baculoviruses [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Using this method, LyP-1, F3, and CGKRK tumor-homing peptides were originally identified by the in vivo screening of phage display libraries [37] . The fusion proteins were successfully incorporated into budded virions, which showed binding abilities to human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-435) and hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells that were improved twoto fivefold. These fusion proteins inhibited virus biding and transduction by free soluble peptides. The soluble Lyp-1 peptide induces death in cultured cancer cells and inhibits tumor growth in mice implanted with xenograft tumors. The authors described that a BV expressing LyP-1 exerted an effect similar to that of soluble LyP-1 [38] . In addition to allowing efficient BV transduction, wtBV has been shown to immunostimulate the release of inflammatory cytokines, including INFs, TNF-\u03b1, IL1A, IL1B and IL6 in mammalian cells and confer protection from lethal virus infection in mice [39, 40] . Abe et al. reported that wtBV activates proinflammatory cytokines in peritoneal macrophage cells, splenic CD11c + DCs, and a murine macrophage cell line through the TLR9/MyD88 pathway in which the BV genome induces the innate immune response [41] . Subsequently, our previous studies demonstrated that BV induces the functional maturation of human monocyte-derived DCs (HCDs) and the activation of human NK cells via BV-HCDs [6, 7] . Furthermore, we showed that BV directly actives NK cells via TLR9 [8] . BV-DCs might therefore be a useful immunotherapy tool for viral infections and malignancies, particularly if used in association with current virotherapies to achieve the most effective results. The host innate and acquired or adaptive immunity were also strongly induced by the rBV vectors.",

On day 35 post injection, the mice were sacrificed, and their spleens were isolated. Dissociation of the mouse spleens was performed using the gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following centrifugation (1500\u00d7g, 5 min, room temperature), the supernatant fluid was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in culture medium at the desired concentration. An aliquot of the suspended cells was used to assay the cell quantity, and the cell suspension was adjusted to a final density of 1xl0 7 cells/ml. The splenocytes were used for the IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT and CD8 + T-cell IFN-\u03b3 assays.
