In this review, we aim to explore how genetic events such as spontaneous mutations could alter the genomic organization of RNA viruses in such a way that they impact virus replications and plaque morphology. The phenomenon of quasispecies within a viral population is also discussed to reflect virulence and its implications for RNA viruses. An understanding of how such events occur will provide further evidence about whether there are molecular determinants for plaque morphology of RNA viruses or whether different plaque phenotypes arise due to the presence of quasispecies within a population. Ultimately this review gives an insight into whether the intrinsically high error rates due to the low fidelity of RNA polymerases is responsible for the variation in plaque morphology and diversity in virulence. This can be a useful tool in characterizing mechanisms that facilitate virus adaptation and evolution.",

This attests to the urgency to understand the mechanisms by which viruses can overcome the different pressures applied to restrict their replications. In the last four decades, breakthroughs in molecular biology have favored in-depth analysis of virus isolates. Findings from other studies have suggested that populations of RNA viruses are divergent and favor an active evolution of RNA genomes. The quick evolution of RNA genomes could lead to variant sequences that differ by one or two nucleotides from the wild-type sequence in the population. It is further suggested that each viral RNA population of 10 9 or more infectious particles was always a mixture of various variants despite being isolated from a single clone [6] .",

The phenomenon of quasispecies was further supported by the \"hypercycle\" theory as a self-organization principle to include different quasispecies in a higher-order organization that eases evolution into more complicated forms such that the coding capacity and catalytic activities of proteins are taken into account [8] [9] [10] .",

The outcome of one-step growth curves and northern blot analysis of genomic RNA synthesis confirmed that the G64S mutation showed greater fidelity without a considerable reduction in the overall efficiency of RNA replication. The study hypothesized that having greater heterogeneity within a viral population allows it to adapt better to changing environments encountered during an infection and indeed the finding showed that boosting the fidelity of poliovirus replication had a noticeable effect on viral adaptation and pathogenicity. The poliovirus strain with a mutated RNA polymerase carrying an altered amino acid residue (G64S) was observed to replicate similarly to the wild-type counterpart but produced lower genomic diversity and subsequently was incapable of adapting well under detrimental growth situations. This study showed that the diversity of the quasispecies was associated with increased virulence rather than selection of single adaptive mutations. Alongside previous observations, these findings indicated a rise in the error rate over the tolerable error threshold which induced viral extinction, suggesting that the rate of viral mutation was precisely modulated and most likely had been finely tuned during the evolution of the virus [7] . It was further revealed that curbing the diversity of a RNA viral population by raising the fidelity of the RNA polymerase had a direct effect on its pathogenicity and capacity of the viruses to escape antiviral immunity [23] . These findings support the fact that RNA viruses have developed minimal viral polymerase fidelity to facilitate quick evolution and adaptation to novel situations [24] .",

A novel bottleneck selection was revealed in various environments such as the respiratory system and the central nervous system throughout the dissemination of EV-A71 in the host. Consequently, a dominant haplotype resulting from the bottleneck effect caused a change from viruses harboring VP1-3D to VP1-31G where the amino acid 31 was a favorable site of selection among the circulating EV-A71 sub-genotype C2. VP1-31G was present at elevated levels amongst the population of mutants of EV-A71 in the throat swabs of subjects with severe EV-A71 infections. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that VP1-31D virus isolates had higher infectivity, fitness and virion stability, which sustained the virus infections in the digestive system. Speculations were that such factors benefitted the virus in gaining added viral adaptation and subsequently enabled viral spread to more tissues. These beneficial abilities could also justify the reduced number of VP1-31D viruses located in the brain following positive selection. The VP1-31G viruses presenting the major haplotype in the central nervous system displayed increased viral fitness and growth rates in neuronal cells. This implied that the VP1-31G mutations aided the spread of the mutant virus in the brain which resulted in serious neurological complications in patients. It was speculated that the fluctuating degree of tissue tropism of EV-A71 at diverse inoculation sites resulted in the bottleneck effect of the viral population having a mutant spectrum. Hence, the adaptive VP1-31G haplotype became dominant in neuronal tissues and once the infection was achieved, VP1-31G viruses expedited bottleneck selection and propagation into the skin and CNS. Among the three minor haplotypes (C to E) which co-existed in various tissues, the minor haplotype C was isolated in the intestinal mucosa and throat swab specimens. The minor haplotype D was isolated from specimens obtained from the respiratory and digestive systems. However, the minor haplotype E appeared in throat swabs and the basal ganglia but not the intestinal mucosa, hence, suggesting that the intestinal mucosa is the initial replication site of the EV-A71. Collectively, these data showed that the EV-A71 quasispecies utilized the dynamic proportion of varying haplotype populations to co-exist, sustained the ability of the population to adapt and enabled the propagation in different tissues. Lastly, the study concluded that the selection of haplotype(s) might be a driving factor in viral dissemination and severity of infections in humans as well as the virulence in EV-A71 infected patients [30] .",

Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, the infectivity of the two vaccine strains was investigated to assess the molecular determinants of plaque size. It was revealed that the small plaque displayed by the PGMK30 strain in BHK-21 cells was due to its reduced in vitro growth rate. On the other hand, the PDK53 strain which produced the small plaques was observed to grow rapidly but was unable to evade antiviral responses which restricted its ability to spread. The slow growth rates of the two strains were suggested to be due to two different key mechanisms-the growth of PDK53 appeared to be modulated by antiviral responses while PGMK30 was slow to spread to surrounding cells but was able to evade immune detection. It was hypothesized that if the plaque size of PDK53 was hindered by the antiviral response, interfering with its activation by silencing pSTAT1 would be expected to alter the plaque characteristics of the PDK53 but not PGMK30 or the wild-type. In line with the hypothesis, a marked increase in pSTAT1 was shown in cells surrounding the foci of PDK53 infection but no increase was detected in PGMK30 and the wild-type. At least two different mechanisms dictate the plaque phenotype and elucidating the exact mechanism of how it caused the formation of small plaque size is an efficient way to choose future live-attenuated vaccine strains for clinical development [38] .",

            "text": "From another perspective, differences in the envelope (E) gene sequence was investigated using the plasma samples of six DENV infected patients. The first account of viral quasispecies of DENV in vivo was reported using clonal sequencing analysis whereby the simultaneous occurrence of diverse variant genomes was observed. The degree of genetic diversity was revealed to fluctuate among patients with the mean proportion being 1.67%. Moreover, out of 10 clones derived from dengue infected plasma, 33 nucleotide substitutions were detected, of which 30 were non-synonymous mutations. Of particular interest, mutations at amino acid residues 290 and 301 resulted in the presence of two stop codons which indicated that genome-defective dengue viruses (5.8%) were also present within the quasispecies population. It was hypothesized that this might have significant impact on the pathogenesis of the dengue virus [39] . Recently, Parameswaran et al. profiled the intra-host viral diversity of samples from 77 patients via whole-genome amplifications of the entire coding region of the DENV-3 genome. A significant difference in the viral makeup between na\u00efve subjects and patients with DENV-3 immunity revealed that the immune repertoire of the host is responsible for the degree of diversity exhibited by the viral population. Subsequently, identification of the hotspots responsible for the intra-host diversity revealed that few spots were crucial for intra-host diversity. The major hotspots for diversity were revealed in more than 59% of the samples at three codon coordinates-amino acid residues 100 and 101 in the M protein and residue 315 in the AB loop of the E Domain III. The residue E 315 was speculated to have arisen as an immune escape variant in response to the pressure exerted by the immune defense mechanism. These findings highlighted the importance of host-specific selection pressures in the evolution of DENV-3 viral population within the host and this could eventually lead to the intelligent design of a vaccine candidate identified from the prevalent escape variants such as those bearing the E 315 [40] . It was reported that within the quasispecies population, amino acid substitutions occurred on the surface of the E protein which was involved in interactions with other oligomers, antibodies and host cell receptors. In particular, two amino acid substitutions at positions E452 and E455 were mapped to the E protein transmembrane domain, E450 to E472, which functioned as the membrane anchor for E protein. Intra-host quasispecies analysis using the E gene sequences also identified several amino acids on the surface of the E protein which altered the properties of the virus. The conformational rearrangements that led to the fusion of the virus and the host cell membrane was altered. The amino acids detected in the quasispecies consensus sequence were observed to be less frequent in the E proteins from patients suffering from mild disease than from patients with severe onset of dengue infection. Thus, the quasispecies might harbor specific variants that are crucial for the pathogenesis of the disease [41] . Understanding the significant molecular determinant of pathogenesis through the analysis of quasispecies could lead to the rational design of a DENV vaccine.",

The plaque size produced by the recombinant clone was smaller when compared to the parental strain and its growth rate was significantly reduced in Vero cells.

Phylogenetic analysis was then performed and each nucleotide was analyzed to characterize the quasispecies composition of this clinical isolate. For each nucleotide position, the frequency of occurrence of each of the bases was determined and 3375 single-nucleotide variants (SNV) were detected. Interestingly, four variants of the quasispecies population were found to be present at a level of more than 1% of the total population. Mutations in the E protein accounted for 4.1% of the variants and other mutations in the non-structural region-8.2% in the NS2, 1.6% in the NS1 and 1.4% in the NS5 were detected. The phylogenetic data analysis also disclosed that ZIKV-SL1602 clustered within the Asian lineage in close proximity to the WNVs currently circulating in America.

Characterization of this variant in mammalian, avian and mosquito cell lines led to the discovery that the SP variant contained four nucleotides in its genome that differed from the wild-type genome. Two nucleotide changes led to non-synonymous mutations where there was a P54S change in the prM protein and a V61A change in the NS2A protein. Further analysis of the mutations revealed that deletion at the cleavage site of the prM site did not affect virus replication and its release from mammalian BHK cells. However, the progeny of this virus was no longer able to infect BHK cells. A mutation in the prM region of the TBEV was also reported to cause decreased secretion of virus particles with no effect on protein folding. Lower neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness were reported when mutation A30P occurred in the NS2A region of the isolate. Further sequencing of the isolate showed that most of the small plaque clones initially isolated reverted back to their wild-type sequence at position 625 in the prM region. Remaining isolates reverted at position 3707 in the NS2A region. These findings suggested that the mutation present in the prM region could be responsible for the phenotype of the small plaque. It is probable that the mutation in the NS2A region was responsible for the determination of the plaque size as the mutation in the prM region was sufficient to revert the isolate to the wild-type phenotype [52] .",

Up to date, the role of several of these mutations and the influence of disease severity in vertebrates and transmission by mosquitoes have been studied. Riemersma et al. investigated the intra-host genetic diversity of high and low-fidelity CHIKV variants using murine models. Both the high and low fidelity variants were expected to lower the virulence of CHIKV as compared to the wild-type (CHIKV-WT). However, the high-fidelity variant caused more acute levels of infection such that the onset of the swelling in the footpad exhibited earlier than the CHIKV-WT at 3-and 4-days post-infection (dpi). Moreover, the high-fidelity CHIKV (CHIKV-HiFi) infected mice also displayed higher peaks of disease severity when compared to the CHIKV-WT 7 dpi. This enhanced diversification was subsequently reproduced after serial in vitro passages. In high-fidelity variants, nsp2 G641D and nsp4 C483Y mutations increased CHIKV virulence in the adult mice. The NGS data showed that the CHIKV-HiFi variant produced more genetically diverse populations than the CHIKV-WT in mice. However, the low-fidelity variant gave rise to reduced rates of replication and disease [69] .",

            "text": "Plaque size is a common feature of viral characterization. Primary isolates of CHIKV containing variants with different plaque sizes were previously reported [70, 71] . Viral variants with different plaque morphology such as small and large plaques had been reported in the 2005 CHIKV outbreak isolates [72] . It is curious how small plaque variants with lower fitness were maintained as a natural viral quasispecies. Plausible explanations indicated that the plaque size might not represent the in vivo growth conditions and that cooperation among variants with different plaque sizes might be required for optimal in vivo replication and transmission fitness. Jaimipak et al. reasoned that if the plaque size did not represent the in vivo growth conditions and the small plaque variants had a similar fitness as the large plaque variants, they would be similarly virulent in a murine model. In order to explore the virulence of the small plaque CHIKV variant in vivo, the pathogenicity of the purified small plaque variant of the CHIKV virus isolated from the sera of the patient in Phang-nga, Thailand in 2009, was tested in neonatal mice [73] . The small plaque variant (CHK-S) showed stable homogenous small plaques after 4 plaque purifications. It also grew slower and produced lower titers when compared with the wild-type virus. After 21 days of infection in the suckling mice with the wild-type and CHK-S variants (injected 103 pfu/mouse), mice which received the CHK-S virus showed 98% survival rate while only 74% of mice survived after infection with the wild-type virus. The small plaque variant of CHIKV obtained by plaque purifications exhibited decreased virulence that makes it appropriate to serve as candidates for live-attenuated vaccine development. The CHIKV variant with the small plaque size formed a major subpopulation in the CHIKV primary isolate during multiple passages in C6/36 cells. This is in line with the reduction of virulence in the suckling mice and indicated that the small plaque variant had reduced in vivo fitness. This suggested that replication cycles in mosquito vectors might play an important role in maintaining the small plaque variant in natural infections. The persistence of the small plaque variant CHK-S clone after multiple passages in C6/36 cells showed that the CHK-S variant might be able to outcompete the large plaque variant when infecting the same cell by an unknown mechanism. Alternatively, small and large plaque variants might cooperate in a way that provided a selective advantage for maintaining the small plaque variant [73] .",

Sequence analysis of the P5 CHIKV-NoLS plaques showed that the two plaque variants had no mutations in the capsid protein. A single non-synonymous change in the nucleotide of the capsid caused an alanine to serine substitution at position 101 in the third plaque variant. However, the substitution did not cause any change in the small plaque phenotype or replication kinetics of the CHIKV-NoLS clone after ten passages in vitro [74] . The in vivo study showed that the CHIKV-NoLS-immunized mice were able to produce long-term immunity against CHIKV infection following immunization with a single dose of the CHIKV-NoLS small plaque variant. Attenuation of CHIKV-NoLS through the NoLS mutation is most likely due to the disruption of the replication of viruses after viral RNA synthesis, however, the precise mechanism of reduced viral titer remained unsolved [76] . The NoLS mutation caused a considerable change in the very basic capsid region involving two nucleotides which could affect the structure of RNA binding, assembly of nucleocapsid and interaction with the envelope proteins [77] . Since the CHIKV-NoLS small plaque variant was attenuated in immunized mice and produced sera which could effectively neutralize CHIKV infection in vitro, it could serve as a promising vaccine candidate needed to control the explosive large-scale outbreaks of CHIKV [76] .",

These two mutations reduced the stability of the pre-fusion conformation of the EBOV glycoprotein. Kurosaki et al. investigated the viral pseudotyping of EBOV glycoprotein derivatives in 10 cell lines from nine mammalian species and the infectivity of each pseudotype. The data showed that isoleucine at position 544 mediated membrane fusion and increased the infectivity of the virus in all host species, whereas valine at position 82 modulated viral infectivity but was dependent on the virus and the host. Analysis via structural modeling revealed that the isoleucine 544 changed the viral fusion. However, the valine 82 residue influenced the interaction with the viral entry receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 [94] . The frequency of these two amino acid substitutions (A82V and T544I) varied between different Ebolavirus species.",

Among 1000 sequenced Ebola virus genomes, approximately 90% carried the signature three mutations at positions 82, 111 and 759 of the Ebola virus genome. The impact of specific mutations on the role of each viral proteins and on the growth of recombinant EBOVs was analyzed by recently engineered virus-like particles and reverse genetics. A D759G substitution in proximity to a highly conserved region of the GDN motif in the enzymatically active center (amino acid 741 to 743) of the L polymerase was able to increase viral transcription and replication. On the other hand, a R111C substitution in the multifunctional region of the nucleoprotein which is essential for homo-oligomerization and nucleocapsid formation was found to reduce viral transcription and replication. Furthermore, the A82V replacement in the glycoprotein region was able to enhance the efficacy of GP-mediated viral entry into target cells. The combination of the three mutations in the recombinant Ebola virus affected the functional activity of viral proteins and enhanced the growth of the recombinant virus in the cell culture when compared to the prototype isolate [93] . A pilot epidemiological NGS study with a substantial sample size suggested that high mortality in the host was not changed by these three mutations since the rate of mortality in the overall study was not considerably altered throughout the outbreak [95] .",

Deep sequencing coverage (>\u00d710,000) confirmed the presence of only one single nonsynonymous variant (T544I) of unknown significance within the viral population that demonstrated a shift in frequency of at least 10% over six serial passages. However, passaging the EBOV in other cell lines, such as HeLa and DpHt cheek cells, showed different mutations in the genomes of the viral population [96] .

Terada et al. showed that the double mutations (A9G/R13A) in the non-structural protein 1a (nsp1) affected viral propagation and the plaque morphology. The size of the plaque in the mutated MERS-CoV was smaller and the infectious titers and intracellular viral RNA were decreased in infected Huh7 or Vero cells when compared to the wild-type virus. The formation of the small plaque variant was due to impairment of viral replication via the disruption of the stem-loop (SL) structure of the RNA. In addition, analysis of the biological properties of the nsp1-A9G/R13A mutant showed that the mutant virus possessed low binding activity at the 5\u2032-UTR and promoted translational shutoff against reporter plasmids with or without 5\u2032-UTR [102] .",

The wild-type MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein precursor contains 1353 amino acids arranged into two subunits-an aminoterminal subunit (S1) carrying the receptor binding domain (RBD) and a carboxy-terminal subunit (S2) containing the putative fusion peptide (FP/IFP), two heptad repeat domains (HR1/HR2) and the transmembrane (TM) and intracellular domains ( Figure 6 ). Lu et al. isolated a diverse population comprising the wild-type and a variant carrying a deletion of 530 nucleotides in the spike glycoprotein gene from the serum of a 75-year-old patient in Taif, Saudi Arabia. The patient subsequently died. Analysis of the MERS-CoV sequence showed an out of frame deletion which led to the loss a large part of the S2 subunit. It contained all the major structures of the membrane fusion in the S2 subunit preceding the early stop codon [103] and this also included the proposed fusion peptide (949-970 aa) [104] . The deletion resulted in the production of a shortened protein bearing only 801 amino acids. In the cell-free serum sample of the patient, mutant genomes with the S530\u2206 were abundant with an estimated ratio of 4:1 deleted to intact sequence reads. The spike gene deletion would cause the production of a defective virus which was incapable of causing infections or with a lowered rate of infection. Losing the S2 subunit caused a disruption in the membrane holding the spike protein and halted the fusion of the virus to the host. However, in the case of the mutant bearing the S530\u2206, the mutation helped to sustain the wild-type MERS-CoV infection by producing a free S1 subunit with a \"sticky\" hydrophobic tail and the additional disulfide bonds caused the aggregation and mis-folding of proteins. In addition, the mutated S530\u2206 could form steady trimer complexes that retained biding affinity for the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and acted as a decoy such that the spike-specific MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were blocked.",

The maximal level of heterogeneity was recovered from the super-spreader specimens. Moreover, this heterogeneity disseminated in close association with variations in the consensus sequences. It can be inferred that MERS-CoV infections were caused by multiple variants. In-depth analysis of heterogeneity among patients showed a link between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. The two mutations resulted in reduced RBD binding affinity to the human CD26. Moreover, the two mutations were observed to be mutually exclusive, implying that the mutants have the ability to significantly hinder viral fitness. However, variants with D510G and I529T mutations in the S protein demonstrated an increase in resistance against neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and reduced sensitivity to antibody-mediated neutralization [105] . The frequency of each of the single mutant varied greatly but their combined frequency of mutations was elevated in the majority of the samples. Meanwhile, the frequency of the wild type was no more than 10% in the majority of the samples. Therefore, it can be deduced that the selection pressure applied by the host immune response played a crucial part in producing genetic variants and how they interacted with the immune system in humans in MERS-CoV outbreaks [106] .",

The mutated MERS-CoV virus (MERS-CoV T1015N) replicated approximately 0.5 log more effectively and formed larger plaques compared to the wild type (MERS-CoV). The data suggested that the mutation T1015N was a tissue culture-adapted mutation that arose during serial in vitro passages [107] . The whole genome sequencing of MERS-CoV revealed the presence of sequence variants within the isolate from dromedary camels (DC) which indicated the existence of quasispecies present within the animal. A single amino acid (A520S) was located in the receptor-binding domain of the MERS-CoV variant. Strikingly, when detailed population analysis was performed on samples recovered from human cases, only clonal genomic sequences were reported. Therefore, the study speculated that a model of interspecies transmission of MERS-CoV whereby specific genotypes were able to overcome the bottleneck selection. While host susceptibility to infection is not taken into account in this setting, the findings provided insights into understanding the unique and rare cases of human of MERS-CoV [108] .",

Paramyxoviridae virions are enveloped and pleomorphic which are presented as spherical or filamentous particles with diameters of around 150 to 350 nm ( Figure 7A ). The genome is linear, negative-sense single-stranded RNA, about 15-19 kb in length and encode 9-12 proteins through the production of multiple proteins from the P gene ( Figure 7B ) [110] . On the external surface of the virion, glycoproteins possessing hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and cell fusion activities are present. The middle component of the envelope is a lipid bilayer acquired from the host cell as the virus buds off the cytoplasmic membrane. The innermost surface of the envelope is a non-glycosylated membrane protein layer that maintains the outer structure of the virus. The paramyxoviruses can be characterized by the gene order of the viral proteins and by the biochemical characteristics of the proteins associated with viral attachment. Figure 7A ).

This led to the concept that MeV exists as quasispecies in a population. Donohue et al. discovered that MeV was able to adapt and grow in either of the two cellular environments, viz. lymphocytic (Granta-519) or epithelial (H358) cells. Passaging the MeV in these two different cell lines resulted in variants exhibiting different replication kinetics. Deep sequencing of the lymphocytic adapted variants demonstrated an increasing number of variants showing mutations within the 11-nucleotide region in the middle of the phosphoprotein (P) gene. This sequence mediated the polymerase split and caused an insertion of a pseudo-templated guanosine to the P mRNA, causing a replacement of polymerase cofactor (P) with a type I interferon antagonist (V). The two different variants (lymphocytic and epithelial adapted) had different levels of P and V expressions. It was suggested that the equilibration of the viral quasispecies in the population was based on different V protein expression. Lymphocytic derived MeV variants that exhibited V competent genomes were found at a low frequency for adaptation in epithelial cells. Moreover, a complete wipe out of the V-deficient genomes considerably reduced antiviral innate defense mechanism, suggesting that a good equilibrium of the V and P protein expressions is necessary within the quasispecies population [18] .",

Sauder et al. performed serial passaging of the strain Urabe AM9 in cell cultures and compared the whole nucleotide sequences of the parental (Urabe P-AM9) and passaged viruses (Urabe P6-Vero or Urabe P6-CEF) to investigate the attenuation process and to identify the attenuation markers [123] . Passaging of the Urabe AM9 mumps virus in Vero or chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cell lines caused changes in the genetic heterogeneity at particular regions of the genome through either changing of one nucleotide at locations where the starting material showed nucleotide heterogeneity or the presentation of an additional nucleotide to produce a heterogenic site. Virulence of the passaged virus was dramatically decreased in the murine model. Moreover, similar growth kinetics of the virulent Urabe P-AM9 and passaged attenuated variants in the rat brain suggested that the impaired replication ability of the attenuated variants was not the main cause of the neuroattenuation. However, in the rat brain, the peak titer of the neuroattenuated variant was almost one log lower than that of the neurovirulent parental strain. For instance, identical but independent induction of heterogeneity at position 370 of the F-gene by substitution of threonine to alanine in passaged virus in Vero and CEF cells suggested a correlation of this mutation to the neuroattenuation phenotype. There was lack of ability to identify heterogeneity for those regions with differences of more than 10% between the detected nucleotides in the consensus sequence. The heterogeneity could be the result of new mutations at these positions or the selection of pre-existing sequences within the minority quasispecies. In addition, passaging of the parental strain in CEF and Vero cells led to the observation of several amino acid alterations in the NP, P, F, HN and L proteins that could affect the virulence of the virus. Thus, the modifications of genetic heterogeneity at particular genome sites could have important consequences on the neurovirulence phenotype. Therefore, extra caution should be exercised in order to evaluate genetic markers of virulence or attenuation of variants based on only a consensus sequence [123] .",

These levels of pathogenicity can be differentiated by the amino acid sequence of the cleavage site in the fusion protein (F0). Lentogenic NDV strains have dibasic amino acids at the cleavage site whereas the velogenic strains contain polybasic residues. Meng et al. studied the changes in virulence of NDV strains, leading to a switch in lentogenic variant (JS10) to velogenic variant (JS10-A10) through 10 serial passages of the virus in chicken air sacs [128] . However, the lentogenic variants (JS10) remained lentogenic after 20 serial passages in chicken embryos (JS10-E20). The nearly identical genome sequences of JS10, JS10-A10 and JS10-E20 showed that after passaging, both variants were directly generated from the parental strain (JS10). Genome sequence analysis of the F0 cleavage site of the parental strain and the passaged variants revealed that the rise in virulence observed in the parental strain (JS10) stemmed from a build-up of velogenic quasispecies population together with a gradual disappearance of the lentogenic quasispecies. The decline of the lentogenic F0 genotypes of 112 -E(G)RQE(G)RL-117 from 99.30% to 0.28% and the rise of the velogenic F0 genotypes of 112 -R(K)RQR(K)RF-117 from 0.34% to 94.87% after 10 serial passages in air sacs was hypothesized to be due to the emergence of velogenic F0 genotypes. Subsequently, this led to the enhancement of virulence in JS10-A10. The data indicated that lentogenic NDV strains circulating among poultry could lead to evolution of the velogenic NDV strain. This velogenic NDV strain has the potential to cause outbreaks due to the difficulty in preventing contact between natural waterfowl reservoirs and sensitive poultry operations.",

The change in virulence of the quasispecies composition of JS10 and its variants was investigated by analysis of viral population dynamics. The F0 cleavage site was reported to be the main region in which the majority of amino acid changes had occurred and resulting in an accumulation of variants exhibiting velogenic properties due to serial passages. Furthermore, passaging of the virus caused a transition in the degree of virulence of NDV strains from lentogenic to mesogenic and ultimately an increase of the velogenic type. Therefore, NDV pathogenesis could be controlled by the ratio of avirulent to virulent genomes and their interactions within the chicken air sacs and the embryo. The data clearly demonstrated that the status of the quasispecies population is dependent on the pathogenicity of the NDV [128] . Gould et al. reported the presence of the F0 cleavage sequences of 112 -RRQRRF- 117 and HN extensions of 45 amino acids in virulent Australian NDV strains [129] . Furthermore, the genome analysis of the avirulent field isolates of NDV puts forth the existence of viruses with virulent F0 sequences without causing obvious clinical signs of the disease [130] . Subsequently, Kattenbelt et al. studied the underlying causes that could affect the balance of virulent (pp-PR32 Vir) and avirulent (pp-PR32 Avir) variants throughout viral infections. The variability of the quasispecies population and the rate of accumulation of mutations in vivo and in vitro were analyzed. The in vivo analysis showed that both virulent and avirulent plaque-purified variants displayed a rise in the variability of quasispecies from 26% and 39%, respectively. The error rate in the viral sequences was observed to increase as well, such that one bird out of three displayed virulent viral characteristics ( 112 -RRQRRF-117 ) after passaging of the PR-32 Avir variant. Genome analysis following the in vivo study revealed that a single base mutation occurring in the F0 region led to the switch from RRQGRF to RRQRRF.",

The mutation caused the cell culture-derived virus to be completely resistant to PZ prophylaxis in cotton rats. Dramatic reduction in replication of the parental strain A2 virus was observed at PZ concentrations ranging from 4 to 40 \u00b5g/mL. The replication of the MP4 mutant was not affected by PZ. The growth kinetics of both the parental strain and the variant were almost similar with maximum titers above 10 7 PFU/mL during the third and fourth day post infection. Hence, it was proposed that the fusion protein supported the entry of the MP4 mutants in HEp-2 cells in an early phase of the replication cycle through a fusion step. The A2 parental strain exhibited limited growth in HEp-2 cells due to its reactivity with PZ. However, the lack of reactivity of the MP4 mutants with PZ suggested that the F1 protein of the MP4 mutant caused a loss of antigenic reactivity with the humanized monoclonal antibody. Preclinical studies in cotton rats predicted the efficacy of PZ in humans. However, the usage of PZ up to 40 \u00b5g/mL, especially in immunosuppressed patients, could provide opportunities for the emergence of resistant viruses. Therefore, the PZ resistant viruses in humans could cause the PZ prophylaxis to be ineffective.",

It is possible that a quasispecies variant of BRSV persisted in some of the calves in each herd and this persistent variant displayed high viral fitness and became dominant.

Within the sample, 121 viruses belonged to the genetic clade 3c.2a.1 and eight belonged to 3c.2a2, twenty-four belonged to 3c.2a3, one belonged to 3c.2a4 and one belonged to a different clade 3c.3a.

Interestingly, two substitutions, V261I and K196E, were found in the NA and the NS1, respectively. These two mutations were found to be particularly significant as they showed the distinction between the strains causing mild and severe infections. Analysis of the clinical isolates showed a difference in a single amino acid residue, 160K within the HA, whereby 14 cases of glycosylation loss was observed within the quasispecies population linked to severity of infection.

The low vaccine efficacy of the 2016-2017 egg-adapted H3N2 (clade 3c.2a) vaccine strain A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 was reported to be due to altered antigenicity [142] . To understand the pathogenesis of A(H3N2) viruses from the 3a.2c clade, it would be of great interest to consider if each infection was being caused by an individual strain or by a swarm of genetically related viruses (quasispecies). This would help to provide an insight into the vaccine coverage and efficacy.",

Of the 155/176 whole genomes analyzed, several amino acid substitutions were found to substantially affect the severity of the infection caused by the clade specific viruses. Within the sample, 121 viruses belonged to the genetic clade 3c.2a.1 and eight belonged to 3c.2a2, twenty-four belonged to 3c.2a3, one belonged to 3c.2a4 and one belonged to a different clade 3c.3a. Many distinct substitutions spanning across the whole influenza proteome, HA, NA and non-structural protein 1 were found to be responsible for causing mild and severe disease. Interestingly, two substitutions, V261I and K196E, were found in the NA and the NS1, respectively. These two mutations were found to be particularly significant as they showed the distinction between the strains causing mild and severe infections. Analysis of the clinical isolates showed a difference in a single amino acid residue, 160 K within the HA, whereby 14 cases of glycosylation loss was observed within the quasispecies population linked to severity of infection. Moreover, the degree of diversity within the quasispecies population was reported to be elevated in severe cases when compared to mild ones [143] .",

The complete genome analysis of the two strains showed that both LPAIV and HPAIV had high nucleotide similarity with only ten mutations outside the hemagglutinin cleavage site (HACS) which were spread along the six genome segments of the HPAIV. Of the ten mutations, five were previously identified as minor variants in the quasispecies population of the progenitor virus, LPAIV, with 18-42% significant variable frequency [144] . However, studies focusing on the diversity of quasispecies of avian influenza in the human host are few. Watanabe et al. successfully demonstrated that infections caused by a single-virus in vitro produced an evident spectra of mutants in the H5N1 progeny viruses. Analysis of the genetic diversity of the hemagglutinin (HA) revealed that variants with mutated HA had lower thermostability leading to higher binding specificity. Both traits were deemed beneficial for viral infection. On the other hand, other variants with higher thermostability also emerged but were unable to thrive against mutants with lower thermostability [145] . The quasispecies population of influenza A virus was also reported to be in a state of continuous genetic drift in a given subtype population. A viral single nucleotide polymorphism (vSNP) was reported to be important and was shared by more than 15% of the variants within the quasispecies population of the subtype strain in a given season. However, between the season 2010-2011, various vSNPs in the PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NS segments were shared among variants with more than 58-80% of the sample population and less than 50% of the shared vSNPs were located within the PB1 segment [146] .",

It was revealed that the co-evolution of the quasispecies brought about a complex response due to different expressions of the biphasic gene. A significant upregulation of the Ifng was associated with an increased majority of mutants expressing a differentially expressed gene (DEG) named HA-G222 gene. This correlated with the increased levels of pro-inflammatory response observed in the lungs of the mice infected with the quasispecies A(H1N1) [147] . Serial passages of the H1N1 virus was also carried out prior to the analysis of its sequential replication, virulence and rate of transmission. Sequence analysis of the quasispecies in the viral population revealed that from the ninth passage onwards, the presence of five amino acid mutations (A469T, 1129T, N329D, N205K and T48N) in the various gene segments (PB1, PA, NA, NS1 and NEP) was detected. Furthermore, mutations located within the HA region indicated that the genetic makeup of the viral quasispecies was distinctly different in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of the infected pigs [148] .",

Sequence analysis indicated that the samples originated from a single source of HBV genotype B2 (HBV-B2) which diverged from a tiny common ancestral pool regardless of the route of acquisition. Between individuals, viral strains obtained from a time point showed evidence that they originated from a small pool of the previous time point. This conferred the strain an advantage over other strains with regards to the recovery of the founder state shortly after transmission to the new host and the adaptation to the local environment within the host. Natural selection rather than genetic drift was hypothesized to be the root cause for the evolution of HBV, due to the observed varying patterns of divergence at synonymous and non-synonymous sites. This was in line with the higher rate of substitutions within the host rather than between hosts. Approximately 85/88 amino acid residues changed from common to rare residues. Since these changes were shown not to be a random process, it is concluded that the HBV was able to evolve and change but was limited to a defined range of phenotypes. It can be argued that the mechanism observed thus far suggest that the adaptive mutations accumulated in one individual would not be maintained in another individual and might revert after transmission. Hence, within the host, substitutions were higher than between hosts [156] .",

            "text": "Sera collected from two remote rural communities of Nigeria showed that 11% of the population were actively infected with HBV despite limited contacts with other populations. The high prevalence of HBV infection suggested that the transmission of the parental strain introduced was very efficient within the two selected communities. Further analysis showed that the HBV variants belonged to either genotype A or E, with the predominant genotype HBV/E, having a higher prevalence of 96.4%. Subsequent analysis of HBV quasispecies from 24 residents showed that each individual was infected with many different HBV variants from genotypes D and G. This added complexity to the circulating population of HBV in each community. A large network of common sequences was observed among individuals of the community and this is considered as proof of transmission. Furthermore, this pattern of HBV transmission was hypothesized to be linked to recurrent infections with multiple HBV variants or widespread superinfection with varying HBV variants. The close link observed thus far between the HBV/E variants and the recurrent sharing of HBV sequences among individuals made it difficult to clearly distinguish between the HBV/E variants. This suggested that the population of variants could be considered as one swarm of HBV evolving in many different hosts. The coalescent analysis also suggested that the related HBV/E variants in the community originated from one individual HBV variant that was prevalent many years prior to the parental strain being introduced in that community [157] .",

            "text": "RNA viruses are responsible for numerous outbreaks of viral infections with substantial levels of fatality. We discussed how genetic variants carrying spontaneous mutations could give rise to diverse plaque morphologies in different RNA viruses. How the specific mutations could affect viral replications and have an impact on the virulence of the plaque variants are reviewed. The existence of quasispecies in the viral RNA populations is also explored. Many of the RNA viruses displayed different plaque morphologies and these variants could have arisen from a genetically diverse quasispecies population. Such diverse quasispecies in a population could be a key contributing factor to elevated levels of virulence exhibited by the RNA viruses. Through an extensive analysis of different plaque variants and quasispecies within a population, this study could shed more light on the evolutionary pattern and virulence of RNA viruses. More intricate in vitro and in vivo examination of the phenomenon of quasispecies and the relationship between plaque size determinants and virulence should be undertaken to reveal if serious infections are caused by a single strain or through the combined action of diverse quasispecies carrying different mutations. This can be a valuable tool to characterize the mechanisms that led to viral evolution and adaptation in a host. Eventually, discovering an answer to these concerns might ultimately help to design effective vaccines against the ever-evolving RNA viruses. ",
