            "text": "We report a hereditary leukodystrophy in Standard Schnauzer puppies. Clinical signs occurred shortly after birth or started at an age of under 4 weeks and included apathy, dysphoric vocalization, hypermetric ataxia, intension tremor, head tilt, circling, proprioceptive deficits, seizures and ventral strabismus consistent with a diffuse intracranial lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a diffuse white matter disease without mass effect. Macroscopically, the cerebral white matter showed a gelatinous texture in the centrum semiovale. A mild hydrocephalus internus was noted. Histopathologically, a severe multifocal reduction of myelin formation and moderate diffuse edema without inflammation was detected leading to the diagnosis of leukodystrophy. Combined linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping in two related families delineated critical intervals of approximately 29 Mb. The comparison of whole genome sequence data of one affected Standard Schnauzer to 221 control genomes revealed a single private homozygous protein changing variant in the critical intervals, TSEN54:c.371G>A or p.(Gly124Asp). TSEN54 encodes the tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit 54. In humans, several variants in TSEN54 were reported to cause different types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The genotypes at the c.371G>A variant were perfectly associated with the leukodystrophy phenotype in 12 affected Standard Schnauzers and almost 1000 control dogs from different breeds. These results suggest that TSEN54:c.371G>A causes the leukodystrophy. The identification of a candidate causative variant enables genetic testing so that the unintentional breeding of affected Standard Schnauzers can be avoided in the future. Our findings extend the known genotype-phenotype correlation for TSEN54 variants.",

Genetic mapping and whole genome sequence analysis identified a likely candidate causative variant in the TSEN54 gene encoding tRNA splicing endonuclease 54. These results provide new information about the role of TSEN54 in cell metabolism and the development of the central nervous system in the late gestational and early post-natal period. The affected dogs potentially represent a translational large animal model for similar leukoencephalopathies in human medicine. The clinical phenotype in Schnauzers included multifocal central nervous system signs. A holistic pathogenically driven understanding of disease initiation and perpetuation requires a solid analysis of the underlying genetics and characterization of the disease phenotype at the clinical and cellular as well as sub-cellular level. In contrast to the canine phenotype with a predominant manifestation in the cerebrum white matter, other TSEN54 variants in humans have been reported to result in a different pathological phenotype characterized by pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The differences between humans and dogs underscore the need for comparative analysis at the clinical, pathological and molecular level to understand species-specific protein mediated pathways, interactions and outcomes.",

The diagnosis is accomplished via a combination of the clinical course of the disease, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), pathology and genetic testing [1, 4] .

Pedigree analysis of the four affected puppies no. 1-4 revealed several inbreeding loops and was suggestive for a monogenic autosomal recessive inheritance ( Fig  8) . We obtained genomic DNA samples from the four cases (no. 1-4), five unaffected littermates (no. 13, 14, [19] [20] [21] and the four unaffected parents (no. 15-18) of these two litters. Linkage and autozygosity analysis were performed in the 13 available samples. Eight genomic segments on six different chromosomes with a total of 29,237,328 bp or roughly 1.2% of the 2.4 Gb dog genome showed linkage in both litters and shared homozygous genotypes in the four available cases (S2 Table) . Whole genome sequencing of one of the affected dogs was performed (no. 2). Private homozygous protein-changing variants were identified by comparing the variants in the case with the genomes of 8 wolves and 213 dogs from various breeds ( Table 1, S3 Table) . The potential leukodystrophy status of control animals was unknown. However, as this is a rare and severe condition, we assumed the control dogs and wolves to be homozygous for the genome reference allele at the causative variant. The variant calling pipeline detected 2.9 million homozygous variants in the genome of the sequenced case. Of these, 32 were absent from the control genomes and predicted to be protein-changing. Only one private homozygous protein-changing variant was located in the critical intervals of combined linkage and autozygosity (Table 1, S4 Table) . The variant can be designated as Chr9:5,015,506C>T (CanFam 3.1 assembly). It was a missense variant affecting exon 5 of the TSEN54 gene, XM_540434.6:c.371G>A, and predicted to result in a non-conservative exchange of a glycine into an aspartic acid, XP_540434.3:p.(Gly124Asp).

The etiology as well as clinical signs, findings in diagnostic imaging and histopathology are highly variable. In most leukoencephalopathies oligodendrocytes and myelin are predominantly affected, whereas axonal damage represents a rather infrequent finding. However, axonal damage in areas of myelin lack as shown in the present cases, has been reported as an epiphenomenon in leukodystrophies [17] . In several leukodystrophic diseases axonal damage is not directly caused by the lack of myelin or oligodendrocytes and rather represents a secondary event [18] . Several possible mechanisms of axonal damage in white matter diseases, such as sulfatide storage in metachromatic leukodystrophy in humans or aberrant glutamate homeostasis and nitric oxide production in multiple sclerosis have been described [19] . In addition, an impairment of axons as a consequence of demyelination and the associated loss of myelin- derived trophic support and ion imbalance according to the outside-in model cannot be excluded [20] . The pathomechanism of axonal damage in TSEN54 associated leukodystrophy is still unclear and warrants additional investigations. An inborn lack of central myelination leads to generalized tremor as observed in Springer Spaniels, Weimaraner dogs or Chow Chows [21] [22] [23] . Clinical signs, such as whole body tremor are present shortly after birth, might remain unchanged or decrease in severity with time [21] [22] [23] . MRI findings in hypomyelination syndromes are rather subtle and include mildly altered signal intensity of the white matter in comparison to age matched controls and resembles the myelin pattern of newborn individuals [4] .",

The results of the different myelin stains, underline the leukodystrophic character of the disease of the present cases [24, 25] . CNPase immunohistochemistry detecting both immature oligodendrocytes and early myelin formation showed the presence of oligodendrocytes and the predominant absence of myelin in the centrum semiovale of the affected animals. In addition, the MBP immunohistochemistry revealed single fine strands of mature myelin in affected areas. This could be interpreted as an insufficient and inadequate myelin formation mediated by the detected genetic defect. Affected puppies are initially normal and develop progressive neurological signs mostly at 1-6 months of age dependent on the localization of the lesions. In humans, a systematic analysis of MRI patterns is used to differentiate leukodystrophies from other neurological diseases in children [4] . In veterinary medicine, MRI findings in leukodystrophies were only described in very few cases so far. Usually marked T2w hyperintense lesions are visible bilateral symmetrically in the white matter mostly of the forebrain without any mass effect. Depending on the disease, different distribution patterns of the lesions were described, affecting mostly the subcortical or the deep cerebral white matter with or without formation of cavitation [10, 26, 27] . It is very important to include all available information concerning macroscopy, histopathologic lesions, anamnesis and also genetics to come to an appropriate diagnosis.",

The variant was identified during the analysis of two closely related litters with four affected puppies. A combination of linkage analysis, autozygosity mapping, and whole genome sequencing of one of the cases identified this variant as the only protein-changing sequence variant that was located in the critical intervals and private to the sequenced case. The mapping of the disease locus delineated several very large genomic intervals comprising more than 29 Mb. Therefore, the results from the two litters suggested TSEN54:c.371G>A as candidate causative variant with only relatively weak statistical support. During the further course of the research project, DNA from archived FFPE material of eight additional cases became available for genetic analyses. Considering that the mutant A-allele is overall relatively rare in Standard Schnauzers, the homozygous mutant A/A genotype in these eight additional cases provides very strong additional support for a presumed causative role of the TSEN54:c.371G>A missense variant in the phenotype. Taken together, all 12 Standard Schnauzers with leukodystrophy were homozygous A/A, while this genotype was not observed in~1000 other dogs.",

Studies in yeast suggest that this complex consists of four subunits (SEN2, SEN34, SEN15 and SEN54) which play a role in multiple RNA processing events [29] . The exact three-dimensional structure of the eukaryotic tRNA splicing endonuclease complex has not yet been solved. The large SEN54 subunit is responsible for recognizing the precursor tRNA substrate and positioning the two catalytical subunits SEN2 and SEN34 to their respective cleavage sites [28] . In line with this role, yeast SEN54 is a highly basic protein, which facilitates its interaction with the negatively charged phosphates of the precursor-tRNA. The vertebrate ortholog of yeast SEN54, called TSEN54, shows relatively little sequence homology, but several structurally conserved motifs including a predicted alpha-helix followed by a beta-sheet at amino acids 117-131 [29] . The p.Gly124Asp variant in dogs with leukodystrophy replaces a glycine residue that is conserved across diverse eukaryotes from yeast to humans with a negatively charged aspartic acid. It is conceivable that either the spatial requirement of the side chain of the mutant aspartic acid interferes with the secondary structure of TSEN54 and/or that the additional negative charge hinders the binding of TSEN54 to the negatively charged precursor tRNA.",

PCH is characterized by hypoplasia of the cerebellum and the ventral pons, early postnatal death and progressive microcephaly and ventriculomegaly [30] [31] [32] [33] . It is histopathologically associated with diffuse gliosis of the white matter in the brain [34, 35] . In one human patient with PCH2, TSEN54:p.Tyr119Glu was identified as pathogenic variant.

For further evaluation of a potential genetic defect in Standard Schnauzers, six puppies of two different litters (no. 1-4, 13, 14) were presented to the Neurology Service of the Department for Small Animal Medicine and Surgery, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover. One of the two dams (no. 15) of the affected puppies was also presented for clinical examination. Clinical examination of the puppies no. 1-4, 13-14 and one mother (no. 15) was performed by a resident and a Diplomate of the European College of Veterinary Neurology (ECVN). Details on each individual dog are summarized in the S1 Table. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of puppies no. 1 and 14 were performed in general anesthesia. Puppies were sedated with diazepam (0.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.), Diazepam lipuro, B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) and levomethadon (0.2 mg/kg i.v., L-Polamivet, MSD Animal Health GmbH, Unterschlei\u00dfheim, Germany). General anesthesia was induced with propofol dosed to effect (1-3 mg/kg i.v., Narcofol, CP-Pharma, Burgdorf, Germany). Puppies were orotracheally intubated and connected to a semiclosed circle absorber system (Anaesthesia ventilator, Cato, Dr\u00e4ger, Langenhagen, Germany). Maintenance of anesthesia was performed with isoflurane (CP-Pharma) in an oxygen/air mixture (1:1, flow 50 ml/kg/min).",

Box and whisker plots display median and quartiles with maximum and minimum values. Significant difference (p \ufffd 0.05, Mann-Whitney U-test) is labeled by asterisk. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008411.g006",

The wildtype glycine is perfectly conserved across diverse vertebrates. The yeast (S. cerevisiae) SEN54 protein shows overall low amino acid sequence homology with the vertebrate TSEN54 ortholog. However, the glycine residue is conserved and sits within a structurally conserved region consisting of an alpha-helix followed by a beta-sheet. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1008411.g009 TSEN54 variant in dogs with leukodystrophy",
