While for known pathogens, highly sensitive and specific diagnostic methods like real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) are in routine use and deliver reliable results, the identification of unrecognized pathogens, meaning unexpected or newly emerging pathogens or pathogens that are only distantly related with known ones, can be very difficult. In this respect, metagenomics using HTS are much more promising than routine diagnostics. Unrecognized pathogens, especially newly emerging zoonoses, may cause serious infectious diseases, and a delay of medical treatment or development of vaccines might have fatal consequences for the affected patients and animal stocks. Such delays can be caused by performing numerous laborious screening tests until the potential pathogen is found instead of a single comprehensive screening test. Prominent cases of emerging infectious diseases caused by novel or varying viruses for instance are the discovery of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus in 2012 2 , the tremendous Ebola outbreak in 2014 3 , the report on a novel zoonotic bornavirus 4 , or the detection of the new Schmallenberg virus 5 affecting domestic and wild ruminants. However, infectious diseases with clinical signs like high fever, diarrhoea, or encephalitis \u2212 often life-threatening \u2212 can be caused by very different infectious agents 6,7 , not only viruses. In such puzzling cases, a generic approach that works likewise successful and efficient for all pathogen groups, as sketched in Fig. 1 , is essential. In a number of review articles 1,8-12 , valuable considerations for this approach have been summarized. In addition to the overall workflow outlined in Fig. 1 , after metagenomic analysis, it is desirable to confirm the initial sequencing-based suspicion by other methods and in the ideal case by fulfilling the Henle-Loeffler-Koch postulates 13 as for example done in case of the Schmallenberg virus 5 .",

A crucial point when handling diagnostic sequencing approaches is to explicitly distinguish between i) high-throughput well-standardisable routine diagnostics for expected known pathogens and ii) diagnostic metagenomics for all including unrecognized pathogens. The first approach is easier to design based on the spectrum of known sequences, testing with specific oligonucleotide primers for pathogens of known identity 14,15 , known tropism, and maybe also of a known proportion within a sample. The latter one \u2212 used for unrecognized pathogens like in the case of Schmallenberg virus 5 \u2212 should be a generic approach that can ideally be applied to all samples and pathogens. This approach can indeed be developed and tested using samples of known origin and pathogen content. In case of an emergency, however, there might be no information about nature and proportion of the pathogen and only clinical data could be available, and the sample is a closed book.

If sample preparation is designed to be as unspecific as possible to capture all nucleic acids regardless of their source, this approach is applicable simultaneously for viruses, bacteria, and parasites since all three pathogen groups retain their genetic information in form of nucleic acids. Depending on the sample type, the anticipated pathogen, and the research question, one could extract either DNA or RNA. DNA is suitable for most purposes. However, when metagenomics is used for the detection of unrecognized pathogens, it is recommendable to use RNA as initial template to avoid a priori exclusion of RNA viruses. Targeting RNA will not only capture all cellular organisms but also many relevant RNA viruses, e.g., Coronaviridae (SARS and MERS coronavirus), Filoviridae (Ebola virus), Flaviviridae (Zika virus, hepatitis C virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus), Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza A virus), or Paramyxoviridae (measles virus).",

Previous diagnostic metagenomics studies dealt with selected sample types (e.g., stool 16, 17 ; intraocular fluids 18 ) or were focused to specific pathogen groups (viruses, bacteria, or parasites). Therefore, the improvement and harmonization of pathogen-independent metagenomics to be used in human and animal health and food safety 19, 20 is necessary. To apply our metagenomics workflow that was originally developed for the detection of viruses 4, 5 to other pathogen groups, namely bacteria and parasites, we tested, refined, and verified the protocols. For that purpose, as much as feasible, different sample types were tested using virus-, bacteria-, or parasite-containing as well as uninfected control samples. We also included conventional food samples \u2212 untreated and highly processed \u2212 since they were seldom handled and evaluated for metagenomics before 9 . As a result of this effort, we present here in detail a well-harmonized sample processing workflow for diagnostic metagenomics without dedicated amplification steps enabling the detection of diverse pathogens in a broad range of different matrices, applicable with both Illumina or Ion Torrent platforms.",

The applied methods were two bead-beating techniques, one usually conducted in lysis buffer at room temperature, here represented by the TissueLyser, and one conducted with deep-frozen samples, here represented by the Micro-Dismembrator. The third applied technique was cryofracturing using the cryoPREP device. These techniques were tested using a number of different sample matrices and hard-to-break target species. Figure 3A shows the RNA quality achieved with the three techniques in disintegrating suspensions of exponentially growing bacterial cells or hard-shelled Gram-positive endospores (Fig. 3A , see also Supplementary File 1, Fig. A1 ). Clear bands of small and large subunits of ribosomal RNA, suggestive of high quality nucleic acid, were observed using the cryoPREP impactor or the Micro-Dismembrator grinding mill. In addition, we found a statistically significant (Fisher's Exact Test, p \u2264 2.2E-16) increase in the proportions of mycobacterial reads in datasets derived from one tap water sample processed with cryoPREP compared to the dataset for the same sample without cry-oPREP treatment (compare graphs for library IDs 2093 and 2094 in Supplementary File 2). Likewise, comparing the same datasets, we found statistically significant increases of obligate intracellular Coxiella species (3-fold, p \u2264 2.2E-16), of Parachlamydia-related species of amoebae (2-fold, p \u2264 2.39E-12), of Legionella species (7-fold, p \u2264 2.2E-16), and of Gram-positive Bacillaceae (5-fold, p \u2264 2.2E-16). Like for pure bacterial suspensions shown above, in case of pig faeces, the TissueLyser-disintegrated sample also showed the strongest degradation of RNA i.e. very short RNA fragments (Fig. 3B ). In contrast, when pools of midges (insect vectors of orthobunyaviruses like Schmallenberg virus or orbiviruses like bluetongue virus) were disintegrated, cryoPREP and TissueLyser resulted in high quality RNA but not the Micro-Dismembrator (Fig. 3C) . Moreover, Mycobacterium-containing tissues (lymph nodes and intestine) were used to assess the effectiveness of disintegration using the cryoPREP in comparison with the TissueLyser. The Cq values obtained with DNA extracted after cryoPREP disintegration were for a number of samples substantially lower than those after TissueLyser treatment (Table 1 ). In summary, generally the best results were achieved for all tested matrices and pathogens with deep-frozen samples using either the Micro-Dismembrator or the cryoPREP device.",

            "text": "Workflow verification with samples containing known verified pathogens. For the verification of the workflow, various routine diagnostic samples with pre-diagnosed pathogens were analysed. These samples comprised liquids, tissues, faeces, and foods. Table 2 summarizes results from 15 previously published and 12 new samples. We observed a substantial variation regarding the portion of reads representing the respective expected pathogen. Clearly, the observed variation is mainly caused by the strong background (see Supplementary File 2 for the 100 most abundant families found in each data set) naturally comprised in organ material and other samples (e.g., faeces or different foods) that reduces the pathogen signal in the dataset. Despite of this background, using the provided metagenomics sample processing workflow and a subsequent RIEMS 28 analysis, it was in all but two cases possible to detect the expected pathogens even if the pathogen load was rather low like in case of (Table 2 ). In the former case, the Cq for VSBV-1 was around 30 4 and 2 reads representing VSBV-1 were detected. In the latter, the Cq was around 27 after cryoPREP disintegration or nearly 41 after TissueLyser treatment and 0.001% of the reads represented MAP. The workflow works well not only for viral and bacterial pathogens but was also suitable for parasite detection (stool and wild boar in Table 2 ), albeit the proportion of parasite reads was very low. In case of ethanol-fixed stool samples, Blastocystis (0.04%) and Giardia (0.0009%) could be detected in a library generated from RNA template yielding little more than 230,000 reads. For the mycobacteria-containing samples (compare Table 1 ), we detected Mycobacterium reads only in the higher laded lymph node sample (Cq 26.7; 23 Mycobacterium reads in a total of 2.36E + 6 reads) in contrast to the intestine sample (Cq 36.8; 0 Mycobacterium reads in a total of 1.68E + 6 reads). For two samples presented in Table 2 (chicken liver with Sendai virus, library IDs 1949 IDs , 1950 IDs , 1951 and wild boar muscle with liver fluke, library IDs 2019 and 2043), technical replicates were processed and sequenced using the present workflow. In both cases, the results are congruent with regard to both the portion of pathogen and unclassified reads. Noteworthy, in all analysed samples, the proportion of unclassifiable reads was very low ( Table 2) . Determination of the reagent specific background. In order to determine the inherent background of the workflow originating from the used consumables, we extracted both DNA and RNA from selected consumables and prepared and sequenced libraries. With a single exception (library generated from DNA extracted from pooled enzymes of the cDNA synthesis kit, 2.2E +6 reads), sequencing of the libraries generated from the selected consumables resulted in only a few reads (428-4,777 reads) by sequencing the complete extracted material. In the RIEMS 28 analysed data sets, viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic reads were detected (compare Supplementary File 2) with the most frequently detected viral sequences belonging to the Retroviridae. All RNA-derived bacterial profiles were rather similar (Fig. 4 ). Bacterial groups with the highest read abundances were Enterobacteriaceae (7-21%) and Pseudomonadaceae (3-7%), followed by Burkholderiaceae (2-6%), Propionibacteriaceae (2-4%), Comamonadaceae (1-4%), Bradyrhizobiaceae (about 1%), and Staphylococcaceae (Fig. 4 ). In contrast, the profiles obtained for the DNA datasets differed substantially between the different reagents. Moreover, the bacterial profiles determined for the DNA and RNA derived data for both the DNase and the RNeasy column were clearly distinguishable. While in the RNA datasets sequences related to the Enterobacteriaceae and the Pseudomonadaceae clearly dominated, in both mentioned DNA samples, the highest proportion was found to be related to the Comamonadaceae (about 4%). Contrarily to the situation in DNase and RNeasy column, the DNA and RNA based bacterial profiles obtained for the pooled enzymes from the cDNA synthesis kit were similar, also resembling the RNA derived profiles obtained for the DNase and the RNeasy column, especially with regard to Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae. All datasets contained eukaryotic reads, mostly mammalian sequences indicating contamination probably from the production process and/or laboratory handling.",

Because the versatility is a great benefit of metagenomics, we assessed the suitability of our sample processing procedures with various sample matrices and pathogens representing bacteria and parasites. The results compiled in Tables 2 and 3 and in the supplement (Supplementary File 2) clearly show that the workflow is indeed suitable for their identification. In addition, it is not only possible to identify and characterize a single pathogen, but also coinfecting pathogens contained in a certain sample. In this way, coinfections of viruses and bacteria, as for instance in cases of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) infected pigs 24 , or different parasites, e.g. a human co-infection with Blastocystis and Giardia (see Table 2 ), could be detected. This underlines the additional ability of diagnostic metagenomics to find secondary infections 30 that could mutually intensify their pathogenic effect. Altogether, the presented examples suggest that the introduced workflow is suitable for a wide variety of sample matrices in combination with various pathogens and for use with different sequencing platforms.",

            "text": "Release of nucleic acids from the sample is an important prerequisite for successful pathogen detection since nucleic acids enclosed within bacterial or parasite cells or host tissues will not be accessible for sequencing. Therefore, three disintegration techniques were compared with regard to handling and performance. The applied methods were two bead-beating techniques (TissueLyser, Micro-Dismembrator) and cryofracturing using the cryoPREP device. Noteworthy, only the TissueLyser is suitable for high-throughput applications; the Micro-Dismembrator bears a relatively high risk of cross-contamination due to the necessity of re-using the grinding vessels and balls. Like the Micro-Dismembrator, the cryoPREP is not suitable for high-throughput but contrarily bears a very low risk of cross-contamination. The cryoPREP as well as the Micro-Dismembrator procedures include a deep-freezing step preventing degradation and shearing of the nucleic acids that seems to be crucial to obtain high quality RNA (compare Fig. 3 ). According to our experience (Fig. 3, Table 1 ), the cryoPREP technique has the highest reliability in making nucleic acids accessible in a gentle manner especially in comparison with the often-used bead-beating of unfrozen samples. Even with Mycobacterium species known to be highly resistant against many disintegration and nucleic extraction procedures 31 , the proposed procedure was successfully applied (see Table 1 and library ID 2099 in Table 2 ). Likewise, high-quality RNA could be extracted from Gram-positive bacteria and their endospores (shown in Fig. 3A ) and improved RNA release from pathogens enclosed in host cells like Chlamydiae, Legionella, and Coxiella made them more readily detectable after cryoPREP treatment. The same was found for Blastocystis and Giardia which could be detected in a RNA-based sequence data set generated from ethanol-fixed stool samples (see library ID 2178 in Table 2 ). Both parasites could not be detected using a universal metagenomics approach that started with a bead-beating step but without freezing or cooling the samples during this step 16 . The presented examples corroborate (i) the necessity to apply a gentle yet efficient sample disintegration for metagenomics in cases where the nature of the pathogen is not yet known and (ii) the notion that cryoPREP processing apparently makes the nucleic acids of complex samples accessible even if enclosed in solid host tissues like lymph nodes or by robust cell or cyst walls (bacteria, parasites) or in bacterial endospores. This is especially important for metagenomics intended to be applicable for generic pathogen discovery as described here.",

Sequencing of DNA and RNA in parallel 5 might be recommendable in emergency cases when the pathogen nature is not clear. Therefore, it can be advantageous to use pooled samples (different organs/sample types) to enable a successful detection 8 , but sample pooling might also have adverse effects as for instance for microarray experiments (reviewed in ref. 33 ). Moreover, sample pooling can help increase the throughput and enable an efficient screening of samples with a higher pathogen load.

In the presented workflow, in order to avoid significant distortions of the original composition of the sample's microbial community and hence loss of information, we deliberately excluded steps intended to introduce bias in a certain direction. More precisely, the workflow completely excludes manipulations like enrichment of target or depletion of supposed non-target molecules for instance by filtration or centrifugation, PCR amplifications and any other manipulation. As shown, manipulation can work well but can have different effects on different viruses 34, 35 , and pathogens other than those targeted may be completely lost 34 . In another example, a comparison of metagenomics with a respiratory virus PCR panel resulted in a 53% higher success rate for the metagenomics approach 36 . By targeting certain taxa or genotypes, PCR self-evidently influences quality and quantity of the sequencing outcome and hence reduces the fidelity to reflect the complexity of the original sample in the final data set 37, 38 . Especially random PCR can bias the sequencing 39 and can lead to the generation of a high proportion of unclassifiable sequences 40 . This was also shown for serum samples and faeces suspensions resulting in 10% and 80% unclassifiable reads, respectively 41 . In contrary, applying the presented workflow for metagenomics of swine faeces 24 , on average only 1.8% (median 1.1% for 41 datasets) of the generated reads were unclassifiable (compare Library IDs 721, 799, 1012, 1060, 1420 in Table 2 ). Likewise, in other examples shown in Tables 2 and 3 only a minor fraction of the obtained reads could not be classified, for instance for pizza, meat loaf, wild boar with liver fluke, and for the MAP datasets. The samples in Table 3 for which high proportions of reads remained unclassified all represent underexplored taxa like Sciurus variegatoides or environments like rumen, for which the published analyses were mainly 16 S rRNA-based. Therefore, the results clearly demonstrate the high quality of the libraries generated with the present workflow.",

            "text": "Two main areas generally impose problems for metagenomics pathogen detection; namely, the necessary reference sequences available in public databases (see next paragraph) and the available sample materials. While the former needs a concerted action of the scientific community to improve, the latter is in the hands of the individual labs. Usually, the best-suited raw material for metagenomic analysis is fresh or fresh-frozen and untreated, since nucleic acid integrity is compromised by prolonged storage or fixation. Although pathogen detection may still be possible despite fixation (compare library ID 2178 in Table 2 ), awareness needs to be raised that untreated aliquots of samples should be stored deep-frozen when intending metagenomic analysis. Highly processed food samples may likewise be difficult since their RNA content and integrity seems to be inherently low, probably due to the processing. Irrespective of processing, some foods impose difficulties as for instance fatty matrices like cheese or milk, or fruits with low pH (see above). If compatible with the respective workflow, countermeasures like defatting or pH adjustment may be introduced. Hard-to-break matrices like feathers, skin, or plant materials with high fibre content (e.g., oat-flakes) may need a dedicated assessment of the suitability of disintegration procedures. Applying our workflow, the detection of yet unconfirmed plant pathogens in the obtained datasets from both untreated and processed foods (compare Table 3 ) was possible. Regardless of sample type and workflow, problems can arise when faced with low pathogen loads and hence disadvantageous pathogen-host ratio, like in the MAP samples ( Table 2 , library IDs 2099 and 2100) and the fresh-frozen liver contaminated with liver fluke ( Table 2, library IDs . In the latter case, the problem was potentially caused by the patchy distribution of this relatively large parasite, resulting in samples with varying pathogen load. The problem of unfavourable pathogen/host ratios might be compensated by enhanced sequencing depth (see 8 ) or host depletion/target enrichment. As pointed out already, the latter may lead to loss of information. In case of low total sample input, the DNA and/ or RNA potentially contaminating the used consumables can significantly outcompete the target nucleic acids. Sequencing of kit components used in our workflow revealed retroviral sequences from the cDNA synthesis kit and bacteria also previously found in blank controls 43 (Fig. 4) . Moreover, cross-contamination of libraries due to adapter swapping 44 or carry-over between runs 8, 45 has to be considered.",

However, according to Klimke et al. 46 , \"different annotation procedures, numerous databases, and a diminishing percentage of experimentally determined gene functions have resulted in a spectrum of annotation quality\". Many organisms (hosts, symbionts, and pathogens) have not yet been sequenced and hence no reference sequences are available. Furthermore, the taxonomic identity associated with some sequences in public repositories 47, 48 have been found to be questionable. This appears to be also the case with the Arenavirus reference (Accession KF478765) that leads to frequent false positive detection of Areanviruses (compare Supplementary File 2) . This is likely caused by an extension of the viral genome with a ribosomal sequence. These problems need to be solved in the future to further improve the use of metagenomics for pathogen detection.",
