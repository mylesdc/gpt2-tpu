To explore whether the low pH-dependency of influenza A viruses might affect the antiviral effects of chloroquine at clinically achievable concentrations, we tested the antiviral effects of this drug on selected human and avian viruses belonging to different subtypes and displaying different pH requirements. Results showed a correlation between the responses to chloroquine and NH 4 Cl, a lysosomotropic agent known to increase the pH of intracellular vesicles. Time-of-addition experiments showed that the inhibitory effect of chloroquine was maximal when the drug had been added at the time of infection and was lost after 2 h post-infection. This timing approximately corresponds to that of virus/cell fusion. Moreover, there was a clear correlation between the EC 50 of chloroquine in vitro and the electrostatic potential of the HA subunit (HA2) mediating the virus/ cell fusion process. Overall, the present study highlights the critical importance of a host cell factor such as intravesicular pH in determining the anti-influenza activity of chloroquine and other lysosomotropic agents.",

As a weak base capable of accumulating within cellular organelles, chloroquine appears to be capable of interfering with pH-dependent steps in the replication of several viruses. Other mechanisms of viral inhibition by chloroquine, such as inhibition of polynucleotidyl transferases have, however, been considered [7] . In 2003-2005, chloroquine was studied as a promising in vitro anti-SARS agent [9] [10] [11] and recently entered clinical trials against chikungunya fever [12] .",

Chloroquine inhibition of both type A and B influenza viruses was first described in the 1980s [13, 14] . The concentrations employed in these studies were however too high to allow a theoretical transposition to in-vivo settings. Anecdotal reports of clinical benefits derived from a related compound, i.e. quinine, date back to the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918/19. However, it was not until last year that the anti-influenza virus effects of chloroquine at clinically achievable concentrations were studied, in view of a possible application of this drug in the clinical management of influenza [4, 15] . Investigations still have to be done on this topic. For example, the mechanisms of orthomyxovirus inhibition by chloroquine have been uncertain at the clinically achievable concentrations adopted in the most recent studies [4, 15] , as well as the effects of chloroquine on field isolates, including avian strains potentially transmittable to humans.",

            "text": "We first tested the effects of chloroquine on low-pathogenic (LP) A/Ck/It/9097/97 (H5N9) virus, isolated from poultry in Italy. We found that chloroquine dose-dependently inhibited the viral cytopathic effect with a 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 14.38 \u03bcM, in cells infected with the H5N9 virus at approx. 10 4 50% tissue culture infecting doses (TCID 50 )/ml (Fig. 1a) . Although this value was rather high, some of the inhibitory concentrations matched the blood concentrations reported in individuals under acute antimalarial treatment (1-15 \u03bcM) . The inhib-itory effects were confirmed using quantitative reverse transcritptase real-time PCR (qRRT-PCR) (Fig. 1b) . Ooi et al. (2006) [15] recently reported that chloroquine inhibited human H3N2 and H1N1 viruses with EC 50 values in the range of 0.84 -3.60 \u03bcM. To investigate whether the discrepancies with the inhibitory values reported above were due to the type of virus or to the different conditions and methods adopted, we tested the effects of chloroquine on replication of recent human H3N2 and H1N1 viral isolates under conditions similar to those adopted for the H5N9 avian influenza virus. Using the test of inhibition of viral cytopathogenicity, we found that chloroquine inhibited the H3N2 virus (10 4 TCID 50 /ml) with an EC 50 of 1.53 \u03bcM (Fig.1c) . Inhibition was confirmed using qRRT-PCR, both under similar conditions and at lower MOIs (Fig.1d) , thus confirming the results of Ooi et al. (the assay adopted by these authors employs a lower MOI than routinely used by our group). Results obtained with H1N1 viruses (10 4 TCID 50 /ml) showed a similar drug susceptibility for the human strain (EC 50 = 1.26 \u03bcM), in full agreement with Ooi et al. [15] , but no response to clinically achievable drug concentrations in an avian strain (IC 50 > 20 \u03bcM; data not shown). These data suggest a more pronounced inhibitory effect of chloroquine on human H3N2 and H1N1 viruses than on avian H5N9 virus replication.",

            "text": "Most influenza viruses enter target cells by fusion of the viral and cell membranes at the endosomal pH (approx. pH 5-5.5), although some virus variants can replicate well also at higher pH values [16, 17, 23] . In a previous paper, the differential growth sensitivity of two naturally occurring variants of an H7N3 virus, isolated from mallards and turkeys, to increased pH values was shown to correlate with different fusion properties [16] . Since chloroquine appears to mimic the effects observed on these two viruses when pH is increased, our data support the hypothesis that the step of virus replication inhibited by clinically relevant chloroquine concentrations is the low-pH dependent haemagglutinin-mediated virus/cell fusion, in agreement with the evidence obtained by other authors at much higher concentrations than those used in this study [13, 14] . The correspondence between antiviral effects and isoelectric point of HA2 (i.e. the HA subunit mediating the fusion process) is also consistent with this mechanism. Acidic pH in the endosomal compartment also activates the influenza virus ion channel, M2, that promotes the uncoating of influenza virus in endosomes. However, M2 involvement as a possible target of the antiviral effect of chloroquine is unlikely, since no aminoacid differences were observed in M2 trans-membrane region (the ion-channel domain) between the two avian H7N3 viruses with different chloroquine sensitivities, as already reported [16] .",

Interestingly, the viruses showing highest chloroquine sensitivity also displayed the highest HA2 isoelectric points. Thus, a relation-ship between isoelectric point and response to pH is apparent. However, a broad study relating the surface electrostatic potential with inactivation by pH would be required to analyse the molecular details of the HA/pH interplay. Analyses of virus production before and after exposure to chloroquine and of the possible changes in HA2 surface potential in viruses rendered resistant to chloroquine after long exposure to the drug will also be necessary.",

The potential use of this compound as an antiinfluenza drug should take into consideration the possibility that even within the same subtype, different strains may present significantly divergent sensitivities to chloroquine as a consequence of their different pH requirements. Moreover, sensitivity to chloroquine may vary in different cell populations susceptible to influenza A virus infection, depending on different capabilities of endosome acidification. Mutations affecting the electrostatic potential of the the HA2 protein subunit of various isolates of the same virus could also be relevant. All these factors should be carefully evaluated when hypothesising a potential clinical utilisation of chloroquine against influenza A viruses. ",
