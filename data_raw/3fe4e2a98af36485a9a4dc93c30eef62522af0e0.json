The pathogenesis of SFTSV infection is poorly understood. However, it has been suggested that immune mechanisms, including cytokines and chemokines, play an important role in disease pathogenesis. In the present study, we investigated host cytokine and chemokine profiles in serum samples of patients with SFTSV infection from Northeast China and explored a possible correlation between cytokine levels and disease severity.",

SFTSV infection characterized by fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction produces a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, which ranges from an acute self-limited febrile illness to various grades of a severe disease with a reported case-fatality rate varying between 12% and 30% [2] . Humans become infected through tick bites, contact with blood from SFTS patients, and personal contact [3] . The pathogenic mechanism in patients with SFTSV infection is at least partly immune-mediated, which may play an important role in determining the severity and clinical outcome [4] . Other viruses, such as Hantaviruses and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, cause cytokine activation, and an uncontrolled release of cytokines has been observed in filovirus infection similar to that seen in sepsis caused by Gram-negative bacteria [5] . Until now, the pathogenesis of SFTSV infection has not been clearly defined, and cytokine and chemokine studies with respect to SFTSV infection are lacking. The present study determined the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, transforming growth factor (TGF)-b, interleukin (IL)-6, interferon (IFN)-c, IFN-cinduced protein (IP)-10 and RANTES in serum samples of SFTS patients during the 2011 endemic in Northeast China, and correlated them with disease severity. We also analyzed T-cell subgroups and their possible role in disease severity.",

Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, the first ramification of activation of the innate immune cells, play a role in the pathogenesis of virus infection in animals and humans [6] . It has also been suggested that besides the high levels of viral replication, immunological response might contribute to disease pathogenesis of SFTSV infection [7] . In our prospective study, the most striking phenomenon was the significant increase in plasma TNF-a, IL-6 and RANTES and the significant decrease in plasma IFN-c in patients with SFTSV infection. The increased levels of TNF-a, IFN-c and IP-10 are related to the severity of illness. These data, together with the significant correlation found between the levels of IFN-c and IP-10, suggest that an intense inflammatory response to virus infection, perhaps specifically involving recruitment of inflammatory cells to infected tissues, contributes to disease pathogenesis [8] . Markedly elevated levels of TNF-a and IFN-c are also correlated with the fatality of Ebola virus infection [9] . TNF-a is also correlated with the severity of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) [10, 11] . Pleural and pericardial effusions and hemorrhagic-fever-like symptoms were commonly observed in these patients with SFTSV infection [4] . However, the pathogenesis of vascular leakage is not known. Viral factors can target the endothelium directly or indirectly, and virus-mediated, host-derived soluble factors can cause endothelial activation and dysfunction indirectly [5] . TNF-a produced by monocytes, macrophages and T cells acts on the endothelium, stimulates the production of vasodilating substances, and is an inducer of NO synthase, with important effects on capillary endothelial permeability [11, 12] . IFN-c and TNF-a have a synergistic effect on endothelial cell cultures in vitro by increasing monolayer permeability, which might play a role in capillary leakage [13] . Whether the role of TNF-a in SFTSV infection is the same as that in other viral hemorrhagic fevers is not known.",

Levels of cytokines such as IL-6 and IFN-c in the blood of SFTSV-infected patients are also associated with clinical outcome [4] . In the present study, levels of IFN-c were shown to increase in all patients, especially in fatal cases. IFN-c is also a predictive factor for disease severity in dengue patients [14] . Major functions of IFN-c are activation of macrophages, differentiation of T helper (Th)1 from T cells, inhibition of the Th17 pathway and control of intracellular pathogens [15] . IL-6 plays a major role in host defense mechanisms, including immune responses, acute-phase reactions, and hematopoiesis [16] . In the present study, levels of IL-6 were not associated with severity of illness, but levels of IFN-c in severe cases were markedly elevated compared with non-severe cases. In contrast, expression of IFN-c in non-severe cases was suppressed, which suggests that IFN-c may lead to disease progression. It has also been reported that there is a significant association between the high illness severity phenotype and the IFN-c + 874T allele in patients with acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Coxiella burnetii, or Ross River virus [17] .

            "text": "IP-10, a chemokine synergistically induced in various cell types by type I (IFN-a and IFN-b) and II (IFN-c) IFNs, lipopolysaccharide, other cytokines and Toll-like receptor ligands, is a chemoattractant for recruiting natural killer and activated T cells into sites of tissue inflammation [18, 19] . The levels of IP-10 in patients were similar to those in healthy individuals, with significantly higher levels in severe cases compared with nonsevere cases and healthy individuals. IP-10 is a potent chemoattractant for activated Th1 lymphocytes, and IFN-c produced during Th1 responses may reflect CD8 + T cell activation with Table 2 . Differences in clinical and laboratory characteristics between severe and non-severe cases of SFTSV infection. production of inflammatory cytokines [20] . Therefore, our findings suggest that SFTSV activates mainly the Th1 immune response against viral invasion. Significantly elevated IP-10 levels were observed in patients with pneumonia, which has also been reported in infection with H5N1 influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome [21, 22] . However, it has been reported that the expression of IP-10 and RANTES induced by hantavirus infection can not increase the permeability in human lung microvascular endothelial cells [23] . IP-10 in patients with H5N1 virus infection might explain the prominent macrophage inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs [24] . In human cutaneous leishmaniasis, IFN-c production is one of the indicators of a sustained cell-mediated immune response, which is mediated not only through expansion of antigen-specific IFN-c-producing CD4 + Th1 cells, but also through IFN-c-producing CD8 + T cells [25] . Whether IFN-c produced by CD8 + T cell also plays a role in severe patients with SFTSV infection requires further evaluation. The reduced levels of IFN-c in non-severe patients may be due to the inhibited expression of IFN-c or production of IFN-c antagonist during SFTSV infection. Decreased level of IFN-c in non-severe SFTS patients suggests that expression of IFN-c during SFTSV infection may reflect the severity of the disease.",

Upregulated levels of IL-6 are related to increased responses to infection, such as fever, phagocytic cell recruitment, and blood vessel permeability [27] .
