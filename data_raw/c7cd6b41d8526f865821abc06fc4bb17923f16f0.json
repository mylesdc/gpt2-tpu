First, the pseudocenters are matched to identify suitable superposition possibilities while the following step transforms the pseudocenters into undirected graphs. The overlap of the final match is calculated by using the number of matching surface points within a distance of 1 \u00c5 (Cavbase similarity). In contrast, in RAPMAD the pseudocenters are divided into seven property subsets and the centroid and pseudocenter that is closest to this centroid are determined for each set. The Euclidean distances of those two reference points to all pseudocenters enables the generation of distance histograms with a bin size of 0.4 \u00c5 for comparison. The tool returns a distance score for the compared cavities (RAPMAD distance) based on the histogram distributions. The outcome of both methods was shown to be comparable with respect to classification performance. Both methods can solely be applied to binding sites.",

A binning of all pairs of point distances (group-type pairs and point-type pairs) enables a subsequent comparison and alignment of pairs of sorted distance sequences. The scoring scheme recommended by the developers consists in dividing the number of distance pair matches by the total number of distance pairs of the larger cavity (PMScoremax).

They are projected on a discretized 80 triangle sphere with its origin in the cavity center by deriving a geometrical vector from the C\u03b1 atom of each binding site residue to the sphere center. The descriptors are mapped on the respective triangle to derive a binding site fingerprint. The alignment thrives to optimize the number of possible similarities between both sites. For the final scoring, normalized similarities per triangle and descriptor are calculated and finally averaged for each triangle. Four distances (d1, d2, d3, d4) are calculated by subtracting the following similarities from 1: the triangle similarity sum which is divided by the number of non-zero triangles for one of both sites (s1), the number of non-zero triangles for both sites (s2), the number of nonzero triangles which lead to local distances smaller than or equal to 0.2 for both sites (s3), and the number of non-zero triangles with polar character for both sites (s4).

A mesh surface is generated by a Delaunay S3 triangulation of the binding site's C\u03b1 atoms. Each C\u03b1 atom is assigned a normal vector that is perpendicular to the surface. Moreover, a PSI-BLAST [10] search is conducted to derive a position-specific scoring matrix and assign a probability distribution to each C\u03b1 atom. The annotated ligand binding site is finally represented as encoded graph based on the regular tessellation. The McLachlan [11] similarity matrix is used to describe the physicochemical and evolutionary relationship of the matched cavities and the angle and distance between two matched atoms is used as geometric quality criterion. The resulting score (raw score) is returned together with the RMSD, the template and query coverage, and the Tanimoto coefficient which describes the ratio of the overlapping pocket volume and the union pocket volumes of both sites. In contrast to SOIPPA, a statistical model implemented in SMAP assists to assess the statistical significance of a match by the calculation of p-values on the basis of an extreme value distribution. The method is applicable toward local binding site similarities as well as those between cavities and complete proteins.",

The comparison is based on the C\u03b1 coordinates and the underlying secondary structures elements based on the DSSP (dictionary of protein secondary structure) definition [13] . The TM-score does not consider the physicochemical nature of the matched residues. It represents the sum of distances between aligned residues after optimal spatial superposition. It is noteworthy that the algorithm is sequence order dependent, i.e. a discontinuous alignment of binding site residues cannot be achieved. For SiteHopper [17] comparisons, a ligand-occupied cavity is represented as a 3D shape that is \"colored\" by chemical properties of the underlying binding site residues. This is achieved with the help of the Shape [18] and Spicoli [19] toolkits of OpenEye. After the alignment of binding site patches the maximum overlap of atom-centered Gaussian functions is calculated.",

            "text": "Binding Site)[14] compares binding sites using graphs. Solvent accessible surface atoms of the cavity are annotated by the nature of their underlying functional group properties (hydrogen bond acceptor or donor, mixed hydrogen bond acceptor/donor, aromatic, S4 and aliphatic). The atoms comprise the vertices of a labelled graph that is connected by edges.Subgraphs are derived by connecting vertices that are within a 15 \u00c5 distance for the use of complete protein structures. Various filtering steps enable a fast comparison. Finally, the tool returns an expectation value (e-value) according to the Karlin-Altschul equation[15], the surface vector angle between the two normal vectors of the matched protein surfaces (SVA), an RMSD of the aligned surface vertices, a z-score a (a score calculated from the number of matched vertices, the e-value, and the RMSD), and the alignment score that is composed of the aforementioned terms. The method enables the comparison of binding sites to proteins, binding sites to binding sites and proteins to proteins to identify local similarities.In SiteEngine[16], physicochemical properties are determined similar to the Cavbase approach. The binding site residue atoms (4 \u00c5 of the ligand atoms) are grouped according to their potential ligand interaction. A Connolly surface of the binding site is constructed and pseudocenters with at least one surface exposed atom are retained. Pseudocenter triplets are generated and encoded with the respective side lengths and a physicochemical index. A comparison via hashing and an elaborate match analysis and rescoring of possible transformations enable the identification of binding site similarities. The found matches per pair are filtered by applying an additional graph matching procedure to identify the maximum weight match. The obtained results can be ranked according to a LowResolutionScore, an OverallSurfaceScore, a DistanceScore, a CurvatureScore, or the TotalScore that is computed by combining the four aforementioned scores. The tool allows for the comparison of pockets as well as protein structures and pockets.",

The resulting VolSite attributes are additionally used for druggability prediction based on an SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm. Druggable annotated binding sites can be subsequently used for Shaper comparisons. The tool is designed for pharmacophore-annotated cavity shape comparison. Various similarity measures are provided: the color and fit Tanimoto as well as their sum (combo) and the color and fit Tversky index as well as their sum (combo) with a higher weight on the reference cavity (RefTversky) or the superposed cavity (FitTversky).",

All residues within 6 \u00c5 of a ligand or ligand fragment atom are defined as cavity residues. Intermolecularinteraction features (hydrogen bond acceptors or donors, aromatic T-and \u03c0-interactions, hydrophobic interactions, salt bridges) are described by placing them at distinct geometric positions with respect to the underlying residue according to predefined rules (e.g. hydrogen bond donor vectors are placed at a distinct position along the vectors defined by the N-H and O-H bonds). Distances between pharmacophoric features are binned according to a non-linear binning scheme and 3-point pharmacophore fingerprints are generated. Each triplet is encoded by the features and the binned distances. The feature opposite the shortest distance is prioritized",

Interaction triplets are derived based on the interaction properties and distances (discretized in six intervals) and the derived interaction fingerprint triplets are compared. The similarities can be evaluated by different fingerprint similarity measures. Using TIFP, six fingerprint similarity measures can be obtained to rank the binding site pairs: Tanimoto similarity, Hamming distance, two Tversky indices (Ref Tversky, Fit Tversky), Dice index, and Soergel similarity. In contrast, Grim (Graph interaction matching)[27] uses a graph matching algorithm for the comparison of interaction pseudoatoms. The relative frequencies of the different interaction types are taken into account by weight assignments based on the observed interactions in the sc-PDB[28]. The final equation to derive the Grscore (Graph-alignment score) was derived from the empirical analysis of 900 similar and 900 dissimilar protein-ligand complexes. It results from different contributions of the number of matched InterLig interaction pseudoatoms, the number of matched centered interaction pseudoatoms, the sum of pair weights in clique divided by the sum of all possible pair weights, the number of matched InterProt interaction pseudoatoms, the RMSD of the matched clique, and the absolute value of the difference in the number of interaction pseudoatoms between reference and query.",
