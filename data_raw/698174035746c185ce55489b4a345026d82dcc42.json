            "text": "The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most important swine pathogens and often serves as an entry door for other viral or bacterial pathogens, of which Streptococcus suis is one of the most common. Pre-infection with PRRSV leads to exacerbated disease caused by S. suis infection. Very few studies have assessed the immunological mechanisms underlying this higher susceptibility. Since antigen presenting cells play a major role in the initiation of the immune response, the in vitro transcriptional response of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and monocytes in the context of PRRSV and S. suis co-infection was investigated. BMDCs were found to be more permissive than monocytes to PRRSV infection; S. suis phagocytosis by PRRSV-infected BMDCs was found to be impaired, whereas no effect was found on bacterial intracellular survival. Transcription profile analysis, with a major focus on inflammatory genes, following S. suis infection, with and without pre-infection with PRRSV, was then performed. While PRRSV pre-infection had little effect on monocytes response to S. suis infection, a significant expression of several pro-inflammatory molecules was observed in BMDCs pre-infected with PRRSV after a subsequent infection with S. suis. While an additive effect could be observed for CCL4, CCL14, CCL20, and IL-15, a distinct synergistic up-regulatory effect was observed for IL-6, CCL5 and TNF-\u03b1 after co-infection. This increased pro-inflammatory response by DCs could participate in the exacerbation of the disease observed during PRRSV and S. suis co-infection.",

Data were first processed by analyzing box plot of sample intensity to ensure that signal intensity data were comparable between samples. Data were then processed by applying a variance-stabilizing normalization (VSN) filter in order to normalize the datasets. The VSN method fits the VSN model to raw microarray data. In contrast with other methods of preprocessing two-color microarray data, VSN normalization is a one-step procedure. The data are returned on a generalized logarithm scale to base 2. A principal component of analysis plot was created to observe separation of different treatment groups. No outliers were removed from the data. Scatter plots of expression were then analyzed to ensure that probe data within a treatment group were not differentially expressed but also to verify that some probes were differentially expressed between different treatment groups, indicating possible differentially expressed genes. Afterwards, ANOVA was used to search for differentially expressed genes between infected and mock-infected groups. ANOVA results were then postprocessed in flexarray by a FDR correction using a Benjamini Hochberg algorithm. Differentially expressed genes were defined by fold changes greater than 2-folds or smaller than 0.5 fold with an accompanying P-value 0.05. Heatmap was generated using VSN normalized data (log 2 based) generated from FlexArray software v.1.6.2. This data was then processed using Gene Cluster 3.0 (Stanford University) [42] .

Preliminary studies with different bacterial/virus ratios and incubation times were tested and those used in the present study represent the best combination that avoided toxicity. In fact, higher virus or bacterial concentration resulted in high toxicity for cells (data not shown). PRRSV replicated in both cell types, significantly increasing the amount of viral RNAs with time (Fig 1) . Following PRRSV infection, viral replication in BMDCs is significantly higher than that in monocytes. BMDCs are more permissive to the virus (P < 0.05), since at t = 0 h (2 h after incubation with virus), PRRSV load was already greater in BMDCs (23.8 \u00b1 1.3 Ct) compared to monocytes (27.2 \u00b1 1.4 Ct). The virus also replicated more rapidly in BMDCs (P < 0.05). Indeed, after 16 h of infection, the viral load in BMDCs reached 14.5 \u00b1 0.6 Ct, compared with 22.7 \u00b1 0.6 Ct in monocytes. The RT-qPCR values corresponded to an increase from 10 2 at 0 h to almost 10 5 TCID 50 /ml in BMDCs after 16 of infection (data not shown). Between 16 h and 24 h of culture, PRRSV replication reached a plateau in BMDCs, whereas for monocytes, a delayed but continuous viral replication was observed after 16 h; viral load was nonetheless still lower than that of BMDCs. Bacterial replication was also highly significant, increasing from originally 10 5 up to more than 10 8 CFU/ml after 12 h of incubation time (data not shown). ",

The number of internalized S. suis by BMDCs found during this experiment is in agreement with that previously reported [11] , with the number of phagocytized bacteria significantly increasing from 30 min to 90 min (Fig 2A) . When porcine BMDCs were pre-infected with PRRSV, a significantly lower number of bacteria were internalized after all incubation times (Fig 2A) . Monocytes were able to very weakly phagocyte S. suis, and no difference was seen in the number of internalized bacteria when cells were pre-infected with PRRSV for any of the time points (Fig 2B) . Since the number of monocyte-internalized bacteria was too low, we decided to confirm this result by using a non-encapsulated mutant (S. suis \u0394cps2F) derived from the S. suis strain P1/7, which had been previously shown to be more phagocytosed than its corresponding wild-type strain [11] . As expected, a significantly greater number of non-encapsulated S. suis were internalized by porcine monocytes at all incubation times (P < 0.05); however, the number of ingested bacteria was not modified by a PRRSV-pre-infection (Fig 2C) .",

To assess if PRRSV infection had an effect on the intracellular survival of S. suis, the phagocytosis assay was modified as explained in material and methods. The number of internalized bacteria in monocytes was too low to perform intracellular survival studies (data not shown). In order to compare the intracellular survival in mockinfected and PRRSV-infected cells, the data were normalized and a value of 100% was set for the number of surviving bacteria found after 1 h of internalization ( Fig 2D) . After 3 h, half of the bacteria were killed and no difference was observed between PRRSV-infected and mockinfected BMDCs (49.3 \u00b1 16.7% and 50.9 \u00b1 19% respectively; P > 0.05). Bacterial killing increased until 5 h of culture for both treatments, with around 20% of survival at this last time point.

Using an expression threshold 2 fold with a P < 0.05, a total of 113 and 35 genes were up-and down-regulated in BMDCs following S. suis infection, respectively (Fig 3A) . When cells were pre-infected with PRRSV, more than 270 genes were either up-or down-regulated. Among these genes, only a few (40 out of 208) were found to be up-regulated only in the presence of both pathogens, whereas more than half of the down-regulated genes (34 out of 65) were specific to the co-infection (Fig 3A) . Differently from BMDCs, monocytes infected by S. suis alone showed more down-regulated (144) than up-regulated (68) genes ( Fig 3B) . This was also found in the presence of both pathogens, with 79 up-regulated genes and 164 down-regulated genes (Fig 3B) . Most of these genes were also regulated in monocytes infected with S. suis alone (53 out of 79 for the up-regulated genes and 111 out of 164 for the down-regulated genes), although some up-and down-regulated genes that were specific to PRRSV and S. suis co-infection (23 and 52 genes, respectively) were also observed ( Fig 3B) . General response to virus infection was higher in BMDCs than in monocytes (135 and 16 genes modulated, respectively).

PRRSV and S. suis co-infection also induced the expression of DDX58 and IFIH1, two members of the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) family, coding for RIG-I and MDA5, which are cytoplasmic sensors of viral infections. The triggering of these receptors recognizing PAMPs leads to the production of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines.

We mainly focused the analysis in our study on the inflammatory genes that may be affected during a co-infection.

However, in the absence of specific antibodies, it is relatively able to resist phagocytosis and persists in the blood with important inflammatory consequences [9] . S. suis also interacts with DCs and monocytic cells [10, 11] , and a previous infection with PRRSV may have an important influence on cell responses. It has been described that porcine DCs are able, to a certain extent, to internalize well-encapsulated S. suis, despite the antiphagocytic role of the CPS [11] . Results obtained in this study confirmed such observations, where phagocytosis seems to be time-dependent. However, a pre-infection with PRRSV significantly reduced (around 50%) the internalization of encapsulated S. suis by BMDCs, though it did not affect the killing rate of intracellular bacteria. It is not clear if these differences observed in vitro may have a real influence on the level of antigen processing in vivo. Previous studies showed a decreased phagocytic activity of beads and dextran by PRRSV-infected porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages and monocyte-derived DCs [45, 46] . Interestingly, this is the first study showing the effect of PRRSV on the phagocytic properties of DCs using live bacterial pathogens.

PRRSV infection of cells clearly up-regulated IFN-\u03b2 and, to a lesser extent, IFN-\u03b1, confirming previous published data [52, 53] . Interestingly, S. suis also up-regulated IFN-\u03b2 and, to a lesser extent, IFN-\u03b1. Although the up-regulation of type I IFN genes has previously been reported in vitro with swine epithelial cells [54] and in vivo in a mouse model of infection [16] , this is the first report of a clear up-regulation of such genes by porcine DCs infected with S. suis. Type I IFNs are now known to play important roles in infections caused by extracellular bacteria, including streptococci [55] . Although the co-infection did not potentiate the expression of type I IFNs compared to cells infected with PRRSV alone, the elevated production of these cytokines by PRRSV could have an incidence on the bacterial infection. IFN-\u03b2 has been shown to potentiate the septic shock syndrome or to induce the inhibition of the myeloid cell response to IFN-\u03b3, an important cytokine for bacterial clearance [56, 57] . However, this hypothesis remains to be confirmed.",

            "text": "One of the hallmarks of the disease caused by S. suis is an excessive inflammatory host reaction during both systemic (septic shock) and central nervous system (meningitis) infections. Previous studies showed that highly virulent S. suis serotype 2 strains induced high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which resulted in a cytokine storm that induced higher susceptibility to the infection [16, 58] . In vitro results obtained in the present study confirmed that BMDCs infected by S. suis induce the up-regulation of potent inflammatory mediators. When cells were pre-infected with PRRSV, a clear additional or synergistic effect on the expression of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines could be observed when compared to cells infected by a single pathogen. We recently reported that in vitro co-infection of swine epithelial cells with S. suis and swine influenza virus showed an important synergy between the two pathogens regarding the up-regulation of genes coding for inflammatory mediators [54] . A recent study carried out in vivo confirmed such observations, also showing a clear increase in clinical signs observed in co-infected animals [59] . More specifically, PRRSV/S. suis co-infection potentiates the up-regulation of IL-6, CCL5 and TNF-\u03b1. Interestingly, it has already been reported that S. suis is able to induce the production of CCL5 in vivo and in vitro [15, 60] , and this expression was also synergistically increased when cells were pre-infected with swine influenza virus [54] . Both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 are known to be key cytokines in the inflammatory response and their over-expression in PRRSV and S. suis co-infected cells could suggest an increased pro-inflammatory response detrimental for co-infected animals. Moreover, the increased expression of the chemokine CCL5 could participate in a positive feedback loop of the inflammatory response by enhancing the recruitment of macrophages, immature DCs or basophils.",

            "text": "Prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxane A2) appear to be important regulators of both the onset and resolution of the inflammatory response. These molecules derive from arachidonic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid that is released from the plasma membrane by phospholipases in response to several activation stimuli, including pro-inflammatory mediators [61] . It is subsequently metabolized by cyclooxygenases (COXs) and lipoxygenases to generate, among other products, prostaglandins (PG). The inducible enzyme COX-2 (PTGS2 gene), which catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of PGs from arachidonic acid, is known to contribute to the acute phase of inflammation, especially by catalysing PGE 2 production. Recent results showed that S. suis infection results in a shift toward an induction of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators and that treatment with fenretinide is able to reduce the levels of arachidonic acid and hence, reduce the excessive pro-inflammatory response in vivo [16] . In addition, S. suis is able to induce the secretion of PGE 2 by human macrophages [62] . In the present study, both PRRSV and S. suis up-regulated the expression of COX-2 and the effect was clearly additive when the two pathogens acted together. A synergism concerning this mediator was recently observed in S. suis/swine influenza virus co-infected epithelial cells [54] . It may be hypothesized that lipid mediators play an important role in inflammation during S. suis infection and this role would be amplified during co-infections with important porcine pathogenic viruses.",
