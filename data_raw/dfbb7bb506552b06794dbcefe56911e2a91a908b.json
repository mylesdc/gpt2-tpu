This study aims to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims towards the prevention of RTIs in 2018 and determine correlations among three domains. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 225 Umrah and Hajj pilgrims. Knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards RTI prevention was assessed by using a validated self-administered questionnaire among pilgrims attending a weekly orientation course organized by private Hajj/Umrah companies. Out of 225 participants, 65.9% of respondents were female with the mean (SD) age of 46.74 (13.38) years. The interquartile range (IQR) score for knowledge is 18.0 (6.0), the mean scores of attitude and practice are 32.65 (4.72) and 25.30 (4.9). respectively. Significant and negative linear correlations between knowledge and practice (r = \u22120.232, p < 0.001), and attitude and practice (r = 0.134, p = 0.045) were observed. Results from the current study showed good knowledge of RTIs among Malaysian pilgrims. However, a poor attitude was reflected in their preventive practice behaviors. This will further help in the prevention and management of RTIs during Hajj and Umrah. Therefore, an extensive educational health campaign should be provided to pilgrims to create awareness.",

Various adverse conditions like overcrowding, extreme climatic condition, pollution, shared accommodation characterize these pilgrimages. Similarly, most of the pilgrims are older people (>50 years) with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and liver diseases [5, 6] . These scenarios could increase the risk of spread and transmission of infections, particularly respiratory tract infections (RTIs) [7] .

The gap in knowledge, as well as the poor attitudes and bad practices in relation to disease prevention and control, contribute to the increased risk of infection and negative impacts during mass gatherings [13] . The assessment of pilgrims KAP towards respiratory tract infections and their preparedness have received considerable attention from many researchers from different countries across the globe [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . To ensure effective preventive practice and optimum preparedness regarding respiratory tract infection prevention during Hajj and Umrah, data on pilgrims' knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices (KAP) are required. This information would be significant in providing the needed strategies to be implemented. Moreover, these would enhance and evaluate the presently available programs as well as recognize possible interventions to improve the behavioral and attitudinal changes. Positive attitude and behavioral changes are driven by the level of knowledge and perceptions towards preventive practices [19] . However, there is no study conducted in Malaysia to assess the KAP of both Umrah and Hajj pilgrims. Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practice regarding the prevention of respiratory tract infection and to explore the relationship between the demographic variables and knowledge, attitude and practice scores among 2018 Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims.",

A bilingual expert did the translation aimed to maintain the content meaning over a word for word literal translation. Back translation to the original language version (English) was done without access to the initial English version questionnaires. The questionnaire was then assessed for equivalency to the original version and the back-translated version and ascertained it to be satisfactory by a panel of experts. No significant modifications were identified, showing that the scale was adequate to maintain its meaning and purposes. It also collected participants' demographics including age, gender, occupation, marital status, educational qualifications, as well as comorbidities and signs and symptoms of influenza-like illness prior to departure to Hajj or Umrah. The difficulty discrimination index of the knowledge domain comprising of six sub-domains ranged from \u22121.26 to 6.29, while the factor loading of the attitude domain which consisted of two sub-domains ranged from 0.414 to 0.791. The practice domain also consisted of two sub-domains and had factor loading range from 0.315 to 0.917. The questionnaire was piloted among 50 pilgrims before Hajj and validated. Results of the reliability test carried out showed Cronbach's coefficient alpha for knowledge, attitude, and practice was 0.777, 0.709, and 0.729 respectively. The newly developed questionnaire had 79 items divided into five sections: Socio-demographic, knowledge, attitude, and practice sections. The knowledge section consisted of 29 items and was aimed at accessing and evaluating the general knowledge of pilgrims about the etiology, spread, and transmission, signs and symptoms, complications, risk factors and prevention of respiratory tract infections. In the attitude section, 13 questions were used to assess behavioral perception towards prevention of respiratory tract infections. Twelve questions on practices were used to evaluate the actual compliance and uptake of various preventive measures.",

On the other hand, good knowledge was not reflected by their unacceptable attitudes and practices for some variables in the present study. For instance, 26.2% of the study participants had agreed that vaccination had unpleasant side effects, despite having a good understanding of its usage for prevention. This figure was similar to the figure reported among Umrah pilgrims from Egypt (60.3%) [31] . Preventive practices did not reflect the adequate knowledge reported in this study. In practice, generally, only 16.9% of the pilgrims were shown to have good preventive practices towards respiratory tract infection. However, the majority of the respondents ensured they fitted the face mask properly before using it. Despite having awareness regarding the availability of the recommended vaccines, most of the participants were not immunized against RTIs. However, gender, educational level, previous Hajj experience, and meningococcal vaccine are significantly associated with mean attitude scores. Similarly, gender, occupation, previous Hajj experience were the only factors significantly associated with mean practice scores.",
