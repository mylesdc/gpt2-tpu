            "text": "Griffithsin (GRFT) is a lectin originally isolated from a red algae, Griffithsia sp (Mori et al., 2005) . GRFT is one of the most potent HIV-1 entry inhibitors yet described, and hence of great interest for use in HIV-1 prophylaxis and therapy (Lusvarghi and Bewley, 2016; O'Keefe et al., 2009) . We developed an efficient and scalable manufacturing method for recombinant GRFT using a tobamovirus-based gene expression system in Nicotiana benthamiana and have shown that the plant produced GRFT product has a favourable preclinical safety and efficacy profile, supporting its development as a topical microbicide to prevent HIV-1 and HSV-2 transmission (Kouokam et al., 2011 (Kouokam et al., , 2016 Nixon et al., 2013; O'Keefe et al., 2009) . Beyond its use for prevention of viral sexually transmitted infection, recent studies showed GRFT has antiviral activity against enveloped viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), SARS coronavirus and Japanese encephalitis virus (Ishag et al., 2013; Meuleman et al., 2011; O'Keefe et al., 2010) . Prolonging the serum half-life of biologics is generally desirable for therapeutic use, and protein engineering strategies such as creation of immunoadhesins, serum albumin fusions and pegylation have been used to improve pharmacokinetics (Strohl, 2015) . Although we express wild-type GRFT in the cytoplasm of N. benthamiana plants, achieving impressive yields, protein engineering strategies for improving serum half-life will often require directing fusion proteins to the secretory pathway to achieve proper folding and post-translational modifications. We were aware that targeting GRFT to the secretory pathway in N. benthamiana causes severe necrotic symptoms and consequently low yields of protein (Stark, 2013) , and therefore decided to investigate the molecular basis of the host response to ectopic expression of lectins in the secretory pathway.",

The GRFT homodimer has six carbohydrate-binding sites, three located at each of the opposite ends of the doubleprism homodimer (Moulaei et al., 2010) . GRFT binds to highmannose N-glycans on the HIV viral envelope spike gp120 and inhibits the viral envelope structural transitions which are essential for viral entry, thus preventing HIV infection of T cells (Mori et al., 2005) . GRFT also inhibits cell-associated HIV-1 infection of dendritic cells (DC) by inhibiting the transfer of the virus from DC-SIGN to uninfected T cells. Replacement of an aspartic acid residue in each of the glycan binding sites abrogates GRFT's ability to bind oligomannose glycosylated proteins and eliminates its viral neutralization activity (Xue et al., 2012) . Therefore, the GRFT activity is dependent on its ability to bind multiple mannose N-glycans.",

HR is a type of programmed cell death that accompanies defence reactions such as generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including H 2 O 2 , the accumulation of plant hormones such as salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) or ethylene, and the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes (Hammond-Kosack and Jones, 1997; Nurnberger et al., 2004) . The HR signals extend to noninfected cells and lead to systemic acquired resistance that is effective against a broad-spectrum of pathogens (Durrant and Dong, 2004) . In most HR, SA signalling is involved and SA accumulation shows a strong correlation with generation of ROS (Durrant and Dong, 2004; Lee and Park, 2010) . Naphthalene hydroxylase (NahG), which is derived from Pseudomonas syringae, degrades SA and suppresses SA-regulated signalling (Brodersen et al., 2005; Clarke et al., 2004) . NahG overexpression inhibits SAdependent HR induction in various plant species (Brodersen et al., 2005; Mur et al., 1997) .",

Our preliminary data showed that GRFT fused with an apoplast localization signal caused severe laminar necrosis, despite low accumulation levels of apoplast-targeted GRFT compared with cytosol-localized GRFT. Here, we analysed the mechanism whereby GRFT induces HR-like cell death in N. benthamiana. We show GRFT-induced HR-like cell death is SAdependent. Analysis of expression of the GRFT mutant showed six carbohydrate-binding sites per GRFT dimer were required for the induction of HR-like cell death and provided data supporting our hypothesis that a specific interaction between GRFT and an apoplast-located endogenous glycoprotein, XYL1, initiates the HR response. Molecular characterization of the protein interactions and physiological response to targeting GRFT expression to the apoplast helped us identify strategies to dampen the necrosis response and rescue expression of GRFT-and similar engineered lectin fusions in the plant secretory pathway.",

            "text": "Griffithsin localized in the cytosol (GRFT-Cyt) expressed by magnICON showed a higher yield relative to GRFT fused with an apoplast subcellular localization signal ( Figure S1a ). Accumulation levels of GRFT localized in apoplast (GRFT-Apo) were markedly lower. Targeting GRFT expression to the apoplast caused necrosis in N. benthamiana, which was not observed in the plants expressing GRFT in cytosol ( Figure S1d ). As another group had shown that overexpression of plant lectin CaMBL1 caused salicylic acid (SA)-dependent HR-like cell death in N. benthamiana (Hwang and Hwang, 2011) , we hypothesized that a similar phenomenon could account for the GRFT-induced necrosis. Indeed, the GRFT-Apo-induced necrosis was found to be associated with an increase in H 2 O 2 production as indicated by staining by 2 0 7 0 -dichlorofluorescein diacetate staining (H2DCFDA, Figure S1b ). Furthermore, Evans blue staining showed that cell death occurred in the regions with induced H 2 O 2 production (Figure S1b, Kim et al., 2008) . As H 2 O 2 acts an inducer of defence-associated genes such as pathogenesis-related protein (PR) genes, SA-dependent PR1 gene expression levels were analysed. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that PR1 gene expression was increased ( Figure S1c ). No necrotic symptoms, elevated H 2 O 2 levels or enhanced PR1 gene expression were observed in the control plants (empty vector) or in plants expressing GRFT-Cyt. Similarly, expression of GRFT-Apo by a plant expression binary vector, pTRA (nonreplicating), caused necrosis symptoms, resulting in a lower accumulation level than GRFT-Cyt. These results confirm that the necrotic phenotype is due to apoplast targeting of GRFT and that the tobacco mosaic virus proteins used to amplify RNA levels in the magnICON system are not involved in GRFT-Apo-induced necrosis ( Figure S3 ). PR1 is a marker for salicylic acid-mediated plant defence. PR1 0 s induction indicated the possibility that SA accumulation was involved in GRFT-Apo's induction of HR-like cell death. To test this hypothesis, we used NahG, a protein from Pseudomonas syringae which degrades SA (Brodersen et al., 2005) . We cloned NahG into a PVX replicon vector ( Figure S2 , Giritch et al., 2006) . Concomitant analyses of PR1 expression and H 2 O 2 levels demonstrated that control plants (transiently expressing GRFT alone) supported high levels of PR1 gene expression and H 2 O 2 generation (Figure 1a,b) . Conversely, plants that were inoculated with PVX-NahG and magnICON-GRFT exhibited low levels of PR1 gene expression and we could not detect H 2 O 2 generation in such plants (Figure 1a,b) . Therefore, GRFT-Apo-induced HR-like cell death required SA accumulation, and the inhibition of SA accumulation by NahG suppressed the symptoms.",

The ELISA and Western blot analysis showed that both functional and gross GRFT expression levels are substantially increased by NahG expression (Figure 1c,d) .

Mutations at the carbohydrate-binding site in GRFT disrupt its ability to bind gp120 and inhibit HIV infection (Moulaei et al., 2010) . Based on this feature, we hypothesized that GRFT's high mannose binding activity is involved in induction of necrosis. To determine whether the carbohydratebinding sites in GRFT are required for the induction of HR-like cell death, we created a mutated GRFT (GRFT lec-), which contains the amino acid substitutions D30N, D70N and D112N in the carbohydrate-binding sites, abolishing lectin activity. GRFT and GRFT lecfused to the apoplast localization signal were expressed by agroinfiltration. Expression of wild-type GRFT-Apo caused severe cell death accompanied by H 2 O 2 generation, which was not detected in GRFT lec--Apo-expressing plants ( Figure 2a ). PR1 expression also decreased in GRFT lec--expressing plants ( Figure 2b ). Co-inoculation with NahG and GRFT lec--Apo did not show any changes in necrosis as compared to PVXempty and magnICON-GRFT lec-( Figure S4a ,b). These results indicate that the aspartic acid residues responsible for GRFT's high mannose binding also play an important role in causing cell death when the protein is expressed in the apoplast of N. benthamiana.",

When the lectins were fused with an apoplasttargeting signal, all three mannose-binding lectins induced necrotic symptoms, but plants expressing Gal-9 did not (Figure S6a) . In the necrotic plants, cell death, H 2 O 2 generation and increased PR1 expression levels were detected as in GRFT-Apoinduced necrosis ( Figure S6a ,b). To investigate whether the necrosis by the mannose-binding lectins is dependent on the SA pathway as shown with GRFT, we suppressed the SA signal pathway using NahG. NahG and the mannose-binding lectins were co-inoculated into N. benthamiana. The co-expression of NahG and each mannose binding lectin inhibited cell death and H 2 O 2 generation (Figure 3a ). We also detected the amount of the lectin expression in the plants by Western blot. PVX-NahG expressed with magnICON-SP-D and magnICON-hMBL, respectively, inoculated plants expressed more protein than magnICON-SP-D and magnICON-hMBL ( Figure 3b ). However, the PVX-NahG and magnICON-CV-N inoculated plants expressed the same level of protein. Like GRFT, these secreted mannose-binding lectins induce SA-dependent HR-like cell death, which could be rescued by NahG expression. Moreover, NahG could boost protein expression in some cases.",

We investigated whether SP-D, CV-N and hMBL use the same mechanism as GRFT to induce HR-like cell death through their mannose-binding activity. SP-D, CV-N and hMBL are well-studied lectins, and the amino acid substitutions which disrupt their mannose binding activities eliminate their pharmacological effects (Larsen et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2009; Ogasawara and Voelker, 1995) . To test whether the mannose binding activities in SP-D, CV-N and hMBL also induce HR-like cell death in N. benthamiana, we engineered lectin activity-deficient SP-D, CV-N and hMBL by substituting alanine for the specific amino acid residues involved in glycan binding (see Experimental procedures). The mutated lectins, fused with the apoplast signal, were expressed in N. benthamiana using the agrobacterium-mediated magnICON system. The mutated lectin accumulation levels in N. benthamiana were confirmed by Western blot ( Figure S7 ). The accumulation levels of lectins and their mutated allele differed in the Western blot analysis. The mutated lectins did not induce necrotic symptoms in N. benthamiana plants, and PR1 expression activation and H 2 O 2 generation were not detected (Figure 4a ,b). These results indicate that, as for GRFT, the high-mannose N-glycan binding activity in SP-D, CV-N and hMBL is essential for cell death induction in plants.",

We screened independent yeast transformants and obtained partial XYL1 (AtXYL1, AT1G68560) fragments as a candidate GRFT-interacting host factor. AtXYL1 (At1g68560) was identified an a-xylosidase against xyloglucan (XG), which localized in cell wall and apoplast (Sampedro et al., 2010) . AtXYL1 is a 915amino acid protein with eight N-glycosylation sites (Sampedro et al., 2001) . In the yeast two-hybrid system, AtXYL1, a natively secreted protein, is fused with a nuclear localized protein, GAL4 activation domain (AD). In general, the fusion of GAL4 AD transport targets protein to the nucleus, not through the endoplasmic reticulum and secretory pathway, so the N-glycosylation that would occur in the endoplasmic reticulum might be disrupted. However, there are N-linked glycoproteins present in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Hart and West, 2009) , with evidence that certain glycoproteins return to the cytoplasm after entry into the ER or after secretion. (Chandra et al., 1998; Kung et al., 2009; Pedemonte et al., 1990; Reeves et al., 1981) . Nonconventional soluble glycosyltransferases may exist in the cytoplasm or nucleus and directly modify the proteins in these compartments. Another possibility is that soluble N-glycosylated proteins may be flipped across membranes or originated from secretory pathways ). While we cannot rule out that the GRFT-AtXYL1 interaction we discovered via the yeast two-hybrid screen is the result of a direct protein-protein interaction, direct evidence of glycan-mediated interaction between the nicotiana homologue of AtXL1 and GRFT through the PLA assay lends support to the hypothesis that the interaction is indeed glycan-mediated.",

The N. benthamiana plants where AtXYL1 was overexpressed showed delayed necrosis symptom development accompanied with H 2 O 2 when secreted GRFT was co-expressed ( Figure 5a ). In addition, overexpression of AtXYL1 strongly enhanced GRFT-Apo accumulation, similar to what was observed in plants where NahG was co-expressed with apoplast-targeted GRFT (Figure 5b ). The fact that AtXYL1 is a regulated factor for secreted GRFTinduced necrosis is supported by XYL1 knock-down experiments. XYL1 targeted pTRV-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) accelerated the GRFT-induced necrosis symptoms ( Figure S9 ). We then identified the NbXYL1 sequence and created a specific antibody based on this NbXYL1 sequence. Interestingly, the plants in which only GRFT-Apo was expressed showed reduction in NbXYL1 protein levels, and the reduction was rescued by AtXYL1 overexpression. AtXYL1 overexpression without coexpression of GRFT did not affect NbXYL1 accumulated levels. This result strongly suggests that the physical interaction between GRFT-Apo and NbXYL1 caused the XYL1 protein concentration reduction. We suggest that the presence of AtXYL1 sequesters GRFT-Apo in a dominant-negative fashion and thereby protects cell wall resident endogenous NbXYL1 from GRFT-Apo-mediated interaction, turnover and ultimately cell death.",

These results suggested GRFT and other mannose binding lectins induced the same type of SA-dependent cell death and their high-mannose N-glycan binding ability is responsible for the induction. However, GRFT, CV-N and hMBL have shown little inflammatory effects or ROS generation induction in mammalian cells Nelson et al., 2014; O'Keefe et al., 2009) . Only SP-D induces oxidative burst and leads to apoptosis in human cells (Mahajan et al., 2013) .

In the context of the yeast two-hybrid assay, we cannot tell whether the interaction between GRFT 'bait' and the AtXYL1 fragment 'prey' is mediated through the lectin activity of GRFT binding a AtXYL1 glycan expressed in the yeast system, or whether the interaction is at the amino acid level. There is precedent for N-glycosylation of nuclear proteins (Chandra et al., 1998; Kung et al., 2009; Pedemonte et al., 1990; Reeves et al., 1981; Varki et al., 2009) , and we speculate that the AtXYL1 fragment was directed to the secretory pathway through its own signal peptide in the yeast host and redirected to the nucleus, permitting interaction with GRFT through an N-linked glycan. The PLA demonstrates that the interaction between GRFT and NbXYL1 requires lectin activity in planta.",

Xyloglucan (XyG) is a ubiquitous plant polysaccharide, a component of hemicellulose in most dicot species, which cross-links cellulose microfibrils in the wall and builds a cellulose-XyG network in the cell wall (Somerville et al., 2004) . XyG structure in cell walls is dynamic; it undergoes structural maturation and degradative turnover by apoplastic plant enzymes (Frankova and Fry, 2013) . Plant endoglucanases including endo-b-1,4-glucanases reduce the XyG polymer chain length and degrade XyG into oligosaccharides (XGO, Shigeyama et al., 2016) . Apoplast localized enzymes including XYL1, a galactosidase (BGAL10), and a fucosidase (AXY8) are involved in XGO degradation into its various monosaccharides (Gunl and Pauly, 2011; Sampedro et al., 2001 Sampedro et al., , 2010 Sampedro et al., , 2012 . Recently, it was reported that agrobacterium-mediated overexpression of the pepper xyloglucan-specific endo-b-1,4-glucanases inhibitor protein (CaXEGIP1) induced cell death in N. benthamiana (Choi et al., 2013) . The HR-like cell death was accompanied with salicylic acid-dependent PR gene expression indicating XyG metabolism might be involved in the induction of the process (Choi et al., 2013) . Our results showed XYL1 is a negative regulator of secreted GRFT-induced HR-like cell death ( Figure 6 ). It is possible that AtXYL1 protects NbXYL1 by simply sequestering apoplast-targeted GRFT. It is also possible that GRFT-NbXYL1 complexes induce HR, while GRFT-AtXYL1 complexes do not. Interestingly, secreted GRFT accumulation reduced levels NbXYL1, and we also saw this phenomenon in plants overexpressing secreted SP-D and hMBL. We demonstrated that NbXYL1 interacts with SP-D and hMBL in the apoplast of N. benthamiana, and overexpression of AtXYL1 reversed HR-like cell death induced by secreted SP-D and hMBL. Furthermore, a XYL1 knock-down in N. benthamiana or Arabidopsis xyl1 knockout mutant under normal growing condition do not show cell death (Sampedro et al., 2010) . We speculate that secreted lectins may impact other apoplast localized XGO degradation enzymes in addition to XYL1 and inhibit XyG metabolism, leading to HR-like cell death as shown in CaXEGIP1 overexpression ( Figure 6) .",

Recent research showed SA is involved in germination, photosynthesis, respiration, flowering and senescence (Rivas-San Vicente and Plasencia, 2011). In fact, NahG expression enhances plant growth associated with enlarged cell size and extensive endoreduplication Xia et al., 2009) . Due to the combination of CV-N instability in plant cell and cellular environmental changes brought on by NahG, CV-N protein accumulation level might not be increased in plants where NahG is expressed, even when the plants were rescued from cell death.",

Moreover, it has been reported that Arabidopsis lectins inhibit the systemic spread of plant viruses (Chisholm et al., 2000; Yamaji et al., 2012) . With reports that lectins have potent antiviral activity and may also be useful in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics, there is likely to be interest in developing scalable manufacturing systems (Fu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2009) . We have shown some of the mechanisms that impact accumulation of GRFT and the other two lectins in plants. Clearly suppression of the SA pathway can rescue expression as this is commonly involved in the necrosis response to lectin expression.

When secreted GRFT expressed in N. benthamiana plants, GRFT binds to XYL1 and reduces XYL1 accumulation level, which might lead to the inhibition of xyloglucan (XGO) degradation into monosaccharide. N. benthamina plants showed HR-like cell death, accompanied with SA signalling. NahG, SA accumulation suppressor, rescue the N. benthamiana plants from HR and can accumulate GRFT in plants. The overexpression of the pepper xyloglucan-specific endo-b-1,4-glucanases inhibitor protein (CaXEGIP1) induced HR-like cell death accompanied with salicylic acid-dependent PR gene expressions cell death in N. benthamiana(Choi et al., 2013). Our study andChoi et al., 2013 strongly suggests Xyloglucan metabolism inhibition might be involved in SA-dependent HR-like cell death induction. Grey box and arrow bar are showing the Xyloglucan degradation pathway to monosaccharide(Shigeyama et al., 2016).",
