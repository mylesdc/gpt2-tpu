The last model has the largest likelihood. We also perform a total of 100 bootstraps to estimate the variance of the result by randomly selecting the real data. We found the variance of likelihood in the last model is much smaller compared with other models (see Figure 3 legend). Table S31 : Nucleotide composition of di\u21b5erently masked assemblies. The following repeat-masking tools were applied: RM -RepeatMasker [3] , TRF -Tandem Repeat Finder [4] , kmer -the k-mer based approach ( Figure S15 ; Subsection of \"Materials and Methods\").
