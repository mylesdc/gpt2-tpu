The quality of the assembly was experimentally examined by cDNA sequencing of seven randomly selected unigenes. Based on blast search 28,184 unigenes had a hit in at least one of the protein and nucleotide databases used in this study, and 8 unigenes were found to be associated with biosynthesis of indole and its derivatives. According to Gene Ontology classification, 22,365 unigenes were categorized into 48 functional groups. Furthermore, Clusters of Orthologous Group and Swiss-Port annotation were assigned for 7,707 and 18,679 unigenes, respectively. Analysis of repeat motifs identified 6,400 simple sequence repeat markers in 4,509 unigenes.",

Moreover, little information is current available for functional genes in I. tinctoria and I. indigotica. The genetic transformation efficiency of I. indigotica has been significantly improved recently, which is expected to promote the breeding process of I. indigotica using a genetically modified approach. However, lack of genomic sequences, particularly sequences of functional genes, makes it now impossible to improve the performance of I. indigotica by gene transformation. It is thus necessary to discover and characterize transcriptome of I. indigotica.",

To this end, messenger RNAs (mRNA) isolated from leaves and roots of the vigorously vegetative growth stages were used in creation of RNA-seq library. Unigenes were de novo assembled from the sequenced short reads. The unigenes were then annotated by BLASTX search, Gene Ontology (GO) classification and pathway analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

We used NGSQCToolkit (v2.3) [30] and a set of stringent criteria to remove the low quality paired-end reads or reads containing adaptors. After this quality control (QC) step, 23,658,849 clean and high quality reads (101 bp in length) with a total of 4.78 Gbp nucleotides were retained for further analysis. These reads were used to assemble contigs and then transcripts using the Trinity program with the default parameter settings [30] . In total, 1,189,038 contigs were generated with a k-mer of 25, which was pre-defined in the program to avoid mis-assembly caused by too short k-mer [31, 32] but to retain a decent number of reads in the assembly. From these contigs, 73,655 transcripts with a median size (N50) of 1,818 bp and 33,238 unigenes with an N50 of 1,628 bp were assembled ( unigenes (12.16%) were longer than 2 kb. The total length of the assembled transcriptome is ,32.4 Mbp (Table 1) . In order to verify the quality of the assembly, a cDNAs fragment of seven randomly selected unigenes was amplified using unigenespecific primers and sequenced (Table S1 and S2). According to this experiment, firstly, an expected size of cDNA fragment was amplified for all seven unigenes ( Figure S1 ); secondly, for each unigene, sequence of the amplified cDNA perfectly matched with that of assembled. These results suggest that the assembly is in high quality. At the same time, each primer set was used to amplify the corresponding genomic DNA (gDNA) of the seven unigenes (Dataset S2). For each unigene, the cDNA sequence matched well with its corresponding gDNA except some mismatches at one or both ends, which was most likely caused by not perfect reading at the beginning of the sequences during direct sequencing using one of the PCR primers ( Figure S2 ). The gDNA sizes of two unigenes (Isatis indigotica 1223 and Isatis indigotica 5014) were the same as their corresponding cDNAs ( Figure S1 ), suggesting that Isatis indigotica 1223 and Isatis indigotica 5014 contains no intron whereas the other five unigenes contain intron(s) in the amplified fragments ( Figure S2 ).",

The category with the largest number of unigenes was metabolism, which includes amino acid metabolism (122), biosynthesis of metabolites (837), degradation of metabolites (434), nucleotide metabolism (179), lipid metabolism (220), nitrogen metabolism (45) and biosynthesis of indole alkaloids (8) .

High yield and content of the effective medicinal components, such as indole alkaloid and its derivatives, are the two major targets of I. Indigotica production. To achieve these goals, previous studies in I. indigotica have been focused on metabolism of nitrogen and secondary substances, such as indole alkaloids.

Insights on the functions of the I. indigotica unigenes were achieved by blast search against various databases. Among these databases, GO and COG are the most commonly used for functional classification of unigenes. COG is a database in which orthologous genes are classified and clustered. Every protein in COG is assumed to be evolved from an ancestor protein, and the whole database is built based on proteins of completely annotated genomes as well as their systematic evolutionary relationships with the orthologous proteins in bacteria and algae. GO is an international standardized gene functional classification system which offers a controlled vocabulary and strictly defined concept to comprehensively describe properties of genes and their products in any organism. With the help of GO functional classification, we could understand the distribution of gene function at the macro level and predict the potential physiological and molecular role of each unigene. COG and GO classifications revealed that the assembled I. indigotica unigenes have diverse molecular functions and are involved in a wide range of metabolic pathways (Figures 1, 2 ). In addition, by search against the KEGG database, we were able to assign a large number of unigenes into different metabolism pathways, including carbon metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, glucose metabolism and indole alkaloid metabolism (Figure 3) .

However, only a couple of I. indigotica genes have been characterized in detail [33, 34] . Studies on the LEA (LATER EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT) gene (i.e. IiLEA) of I. indigotica suggest that expression of IiLEA could be induced by environmental stresses, such as drought and salt treatments [33] . In this study, 8 unigenes were found to be associated with biosynthesis of indole and its derivatives. Studies on these genes could provide useful information for on secondary metabolism in I. indigotica. In addtion, 1,068 and 311 unigenes seem to be related to responses to salt stress and oxidation stress, respectively. Investigations on these unigenes may provide clues for the molecular mechanism of stress responses in cultivation of I. indigotica.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study on the transcriptome of I. indigotica. The unigenes presented in this study provide a substantial addition to the existing sequence resources of I. indigotica and are likely to promote studies on nitrogen metabolism, molecular mechanism of stress responses and secondary metabolism, such as indole alkaloids, quinoline and quinazolone, in I. indigotica.",

These two stages were selected because the medicinal materials of Da-Qing-Ye (leaves) and Ban-Lan-Gen (roots) are collected at the 8,16-leaf stage and 14,16-leaf stage, respectively. Collected leaves and roots of I. indigotica were mixed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280uC until use. Total RNAs were isolated from the mixed sample using the Trizol plus kit (Biouniquer) and treated with DNase I to remove contaminated DNAs. The quality and integrity of the DNase I-treated RNA were analyzed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).
