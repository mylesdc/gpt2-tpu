Quantitative methods for analyzing outbreak data and estimating key parameters to characterize the spread of the outbreak, including the reproductive number and the serial interval, often assume that the data collected is complete. In reality reporting delays, undetected cases or lack of sensitive and specific tests to diagnose disease lead to reporting errors in the case counts. Here we provide insight on the impact that such reporting errors might have on the estimation of these key parameters. Results: We show that when the proportion of cases reported is changing through the study period, the estimates of key epidemiological parameters are biased. Using data from the Influenza A/H1N1 outbreak in La Gloria, Mexico, we provide estimates of these parameters, accounting for possible reporting errors, and show that they can be biased by as much as 33%, if reporting issues are not accounted for. Conclusions: Failure to account for missing data can lead to misleading and inaccurate estimates of epidemic parameters.",

Unnecessary panic and disruption to society is more likely to be avoided and appropriately measured public health responses are more likely to take place when we have accurate information on the virulence and pathogenicity of an emerging disease. For these reasons, quantitative methods have been developed and continue to be developed to facilitate the assimilation of emerging data. Important quantities to estimate include the basic reproductive number, R 0 , defined as the average number of secondary infections created by a single infected individual in an entirely susceptible population. Numerous methods have been proposed for the estimation of this quantity, including deterministic and stochastic compartmental models [1] , branching processes [2] , networks [3, 4] , and, more recently, a likelihood based method [5, 6] .",

Clearly this assumption is more often than not violated in practice, especially when dealing with national or even regional data. For instance the scare surrounding the anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001 in the United States led to a large number of individuals reporting to medical care facilities with suspected anthrax. Should analysis have focused on suspected cases in that situation, the magnitude and threat of the event would have been greatly exaggerated. During the recent H1N1 outbreak, the number of suspected cases of disease likely is composed of several cases that will not be confirmed, however there are undoubtedly an even larger number of undetected cases, at least in the initial stages of the epidemic before the large public health response was launched and later on as the growth of the epidemic in many locations rendered it impossible to continue to track a large portion of the cases. Further, as the pandemic progressed sick individuals were cautioned to stay at home, rather than seek medical attention unless they were acutely ill [11] , driving up the number of unreported cases. Several of the unreported initial cases could arise from individuals who are asymptomatic, but still carrying and transmitting the virus or from others whose illness was not sufficiently acute to warrant seeking medical attention. To our knowledge, the issue of the impact of this misspecification of the number of cases on the estimation of epidemic parameters has not been well-studied.",

In practice we can model the p j with a multinomial distribution or a truncated continuous distribution, such as the Gamma or Weibull, and estimate the parameters of that distribution so that the dimensionality of the estimation is independent of k.

This is the likely scenario initially in the current H1N1 outbreak, where cases were accumulating for some time before public announcements were made and increased surveillance was implemented. Numbers of confirmed cases available early on in the investigation likely underestimate the true number of cases dramatically. One can also imagine cases where q 1 > q 2 . This might occur in instances of overreporting such as occur in times of panic, for instance following the scare after the anthrax attacks in 2001 in the US [13] when more than 20,000 individuals started antibiotics until it was determined that they did not have anthrax. Additionally if all suspected cases of H1N1 were considered early in the epidemic, this could possibly overestimate the true number of cases.

We only consider those that have at least ten cases for analysis, since fewer than ten cases would likely not be detected and considered an epidemic. Thus all simulated epidemics that die out before ten cases are accumulated, as well as those which have fewer than ten cases after the missingness pattern is applied, are not analyzed.

Without adjustment for missingness R 0 is estimated to be 1.42 and the mean of the serial interval is 1.96 days with a variance of 1.14. Under the constant missingness scheme the reproductive number estimates increase with the attack rate (between 1.49 and 1.54), as well as the mean of the serial interval (2.15-2.25 days). When the reporting fraction increases through time, the reproductive number is smaller and decreases as the AR increases (1.29 to 1.05). The mean of the serial interval follows a similar pattern ranging between 2.01 for AR = 39% and 1.45 for AR = 68%. The results from the overreporting scenarios follow a similar pattern, assuming that the amount of overreporting is consistent throughout the epidemic. The results indicate that if reporting were in fact increasing throughout the epidemic, then the original results could be overstating the magnitude of both the reproductive number and the mean of the serial interval. Table 4 provides the results using the method of Wallinga and Teunis [3] and the exponential growth model to estimate R 0 . The estimates using the MLE estimator of the serial interval (i.e. with mean of 1.96 for WT or 2.09 for exponential) are comparable to those obtained with the MLE method and are 1.48 for the WT method and 1.40 for the exponential method compared to 1.41 for the MLE method.

The simulation results and the work from La Gloria tend to support this theoretical result. We note that using other methods of estimation of the reproductive number (Wallinga and Tuenis [3] and exponential growth) yield the same trends. From our simulation work, we notice that the mean of the serial interval appears to follow the trend of the reproductive number.

            "text": "Failure to account for ascertainment of cases can have a substantial impact on the estimation of key epidemiological parameters. If the fraction of cases reported does not change dramatically throughout the course of the epidemic, then estimates may not be impacted substantially. When the reporting fraction varies through the course of an epidemic, as it likely will, estimates can be substantially impacted. It is important that epidemiological studies of infectious disease outbreak seek to account and better understand the nature of reporting and make appropriate adjustments in the methods used to obtain results. We have shown how this can be done for the MLE method and illustrated its use for recent Influenza A/H1N1 outbreak data from La Gloria, Mexico. In that case results were off by as much as 34% when underreporting was not considered. Data do exist, however, to obtain an idea of the level of underreporting [13] use information on hospital admissions in the current H1N1 pandemic to obtain an estimate of the degree of underreporting. Further [15] has recently shown that incorporating contact tracing data into the estimation of the serial interval in a Bayesian framework can improve estimates. A similar approach could be used to improve estimates to account for suspected levels of misreporting. Clearly the need exists to use innovative methods to ascertain reporting issues in data using existing data, or by the collection of additional data or well-planned studies that can be rapidly initiated in the event of an outbreak. For instance, one might consider carefully studying a smaller population to determine the rate of reporting there. This could inform the overall rate of reporting. At the least, estimates should be reported as ranges, rather than as a single point estimate to indicate plausible values for the estimate.",
