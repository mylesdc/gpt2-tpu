            "text": "Influenza virus infection remains a serious threat to global health and the world economy. Annual influenza epidemics result in a large number of hospitalizations, with an estimated 3-5 million cases of severe disease and approximately 250,000-500,000 deaths globally (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/ fs211/en), with much higher mortality rates possible during pandemics. Despite substantial innovations in treatment and prevention of influenza, licensed antiviral drugs and vaccines do not eliminate the risk of infection. Prompt treatment with therapeutic antiviral neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors can lower influenza morbidity, but these drugs have a limited therapeutic window and are subject to sporadic resistance. [1] [2] [3] Active antiviral immunization with prophylactic influenza vaccines has remarkably lowered seasonal influenza morbidity and mortality at the population level. However, at-risk groups such as infants, the elderly, and otherwise immune-compromised individuals lack optimal adaptive immune responses following vaccination. Furthermore, to counteract the high rate of influenza virus antigenic drift, seasonal vaccines must be re-formulated and readministered annually at great cost with significant time constraints. Emerging strains of influenza arising from antigenic shift (re-assortment) and cross-species transmission to humans also pose a considerable pandemic threat. 4 The limited capacity to develop a new vaccine to meet the immediacy and high demand accompanying a pandemic outbreak highlights the global need for new, broad, cost-effective intervention strategies against influenza. 5 Passive immunization utilizing antibody-based approaches is a notable alternative or adjunct therapy for transient protection against influenza. 6 Relatively recently, several laboratories have described new classes of influenza-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that target conserved sites in the hemagglutinin (HA) antigen and cross-react across diverse influenza A or influenza B viruses. [7] [8] [9] [10] Preclinical studies in mice and ferrets reveal these novel cross-reactive antibodies can effectively prevent and treat severe influenza infection, supporting their further study for antibody immunoprophylaxis or immunotherapy in influenza virus-infected humans. While great strides in antibody delivery are being made, the expense of bioprocessed monoclonal antibodies, as well as current requirements for frequent administration, likely pose limitations for universal adoption of this approach and dissemination to global populations. Alternative delivery technologies which co-opt aspects traditionally associated with immunization, such as viral vectored gene therapy, have shown some promise in delivering anti-influenza antibodies in mice, 11, 12 but permanence concerns and pre-existing antivector serology may limit utility of repeatedly using these viral vectors in humans.",

We show for the first time that FluA and FluB DMAbs are functionally equivalent to their corresponding protein monoclonal antibodies purified from in vitro cell production. These DMAb impart simultaneous prophylactic cross-protection against diverse strains of influenza A and influenza B virus when given in combination. Furthermore, FluA DMAb and FluB DMAb afford immediate protection without inhibiting host antiviral immunity. The DMAb anti-influenza technology provides a unique alternative strategy to seasonal vaccination, bioprocessed recombinant protein monoclonal antibodies or gene therapy approaches for universal prevention of severe influenza infection. This approach has important implications for protection against and treatment of infectious diseases.",

This antibody binds to a conserved region in the globular head of influenza B HA, and can inhibit viral hemagglutination of red blood cells. To test the utility of DMAb delivery to prevent severe influenza infection, a synthetic DNA transgene encoding either human IgG FluA or FluB was synthesized de novo, and cloned into a mammalian expression plasmid. Multiple modifications were made to enhance DMAb expression including DNA codon optimization, RNA optimization, and formulation of plasmid DNA (Supplemental Fig. S1 ), as well as plasmid vector design, incorporation of leader sequences for processing and secretion, and CELLECTRA\u00ae electroporation techniques. 16, 17 Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of human IgG in human embryonic kidney 293 T cells transfected with either FluA DMAb or FluB DMAb synthetic constructs confirmed intracellular expression and extracellular secretion of FluA and FluB antibodies, respectively (Fig. 1a) . Human IgG Western blot also demonstrated antibody heavy-chain and lightchain expression in transfected 293 T cells (Fig. 1b) .",

Sera from mice that received FluB DMAb plasmid constructs effectively neutralized both Yamagata and Victoria lineage influenza B viruses in an in vitro cell-based assay (Fig. 2c) , with a similar pattern of reactivity as seen in binding assays. After normalizing for human IgG concentration in each sample, the calculated half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) from mice treated with FluB DMAb plasmid (0.015 \u03bcg/mL for B/ Florida (Fig. 4) . Again, for direct comparison of DMAb versus purified protein, recombinant FluB monoclonal antibody was administered i.p. to separate groups 1 day prior to infection. Quantification of human IgG present in mouse serum at time of challenge showed that FluB DMAb yielded similar mean human IgG concentrations and HA binding activity as observed in animals treated with 1 mg/kg of FluB protein i.p. (Fig. 4a, d,  Supplemental Fig. S3 ). Remarkably, 100% of FluB DMAb-treated mice survived both Victoria and Yamagata lethal influenza B challenge, whereas non-specific DMAb controls fully succumbed to both infections by Day 8 (Fig. 4b, e) . Consistent with survival data, FluB DMAb protected mice from influenza B-related morbidity with treated animals exhibiting little-to-no weight loss (Fig. 4c, f) . In addition, FluB DMAb-treated mice exhibited significantly lower lung viral loads than those observed in control mice (Supplemental Fig. S4 ). Survival, weight loss, lung viral loads, and in vitro binding activity in sera of FluB DMAb-treated mice closely paralleled the same parameters in mice receiving 1 mg/kg (Fig. 5a) . Influenza Aspecific and B-specific ELISAs showed that FluA and FluB DMAbs exhibited expression levels similar to those observed in sera of mice receiving 0.3 mg/kg of recombinant FluA monoclonal antibody and 1 mg/kg recombinant FluB monoclonal antibody delivered i.p., respectively (Fig. 5b) . All mice receiving FluA plus FluB DMAb were completely protected from lethal infection, whereas 90% and 100% of mice treated with control DMAb succumbed to the influenza A and B infections, respectively (Fig. 5c, d) . DMAb administration and delivery of protein IgG resulted in similar levels of protection, apparent in both survival rate and body weight loss (Supplemental Fig. S5 ). Twenty-one days following initial infection, sera of surviving BALB/c mice had undetectable levels of human IgG (data not shown), indicating DMAb and recombinant protein were no longer present. Serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and mouse anti-HA binding antibodies against the infecting influenza strain confirmed that mice mounted a host immune response to infection (Supplemental Fig. S6 ). DMAb-treated mice were able to mount host immune responses against the virus to the same extent as the purified IgG-treated animals. Twenty-eight days following initial infection, all surviving mice (including one DMAb control mouse that survived initial A/CA/09 H1 infection) were re-challenged with a lethal dose of homologous influenza virus to confirm that the level of mouse host immune response was protective. All previously-challenged mice survived the lethal homologous re-challenge without substantial weight loss, whereas 80-90% of untreated age-matched mice na\u00efve to infection did not survive (Fig. 5e, f, Supplemental Fig. S5 ). These results demonstrate protective host anti-influenza responses developed in the presence of protective levels of FluA and FluB antibodies whether expressed in vivo as DMAb or delivered as protein monoclonal antibody, demonstrating that DMAbs did not antagonize each other or the host immune response to influenza.

Here, we sought to bypass active immunization and generate cross-protective antibody responses via inoculation with DMAbs. We show that this approach generated functional antiinfluenza antibodies in mouse sera following inoculation with plasmid DNA constructs encoding two antibodies against HA from influenza subtypes known to cause disease in humans, leading to significant protection against lethal seasonal influenza A and influenza B challenges.

Yet given the expense of administering biologics, and their limited half-life, only one protein monoclonal antibody has been approved and is routinely used for prophylaxis against an infectious disease target (palivizumab, RSV). 23 DMAb technology is a notable delivery alternative as DMAb produced from muscle cells in vivo and purified monoclonal antibodies manufactured in vitro confer similar levels of protection against lethal influenza infection in mice. Plasmid DNA lacks limitations posed by pre-existing anti-vector serology and the DMAb platform may be utilized repeatedly to deliver additional anti-influenza antibodies to combat viral escape, or antibodies aimed at entirely different pathogens. 16, 17 Plasmid DNA also has little risk of genomic integration (reviewed in ref. 24) and similar plasmid designs have demonstrated safety in DNA vaccine human clinical studies. 25 DNA plasmid-based delivery of monoclonal antibodies provides conceptual advantages at each step of the supply chain. In production, DMAb are inexpensive relative to protein monoclonal antibody (and viral vectors) because DNA replication does not require mammalian cell culture. DNA is simple to scale up and stable for storage, a particularly important consideration in resource-limited settings. The potential for long-term DMAb expression with sustainable passive immune protection against influenza infection may circumvent the need for frequent recombinant antibody injections. Long-term expression of DMAb can be further augmented by emerging antibody half-life extension technologies. 26 Conceivably, inoculation with influenza-specific DMAbs may have utility to augment a vaccine campaign, generating almost immediate prophylaxis against severe influenza infection while allowing for an adequate vaccine-induced immune response to mature. DMAbs may also provide a vital option for severely immune impaired individuals incapable of mounting functional active immune responses. DMAb technology is an exceptionally compelling tool warranting further exploration for sustained protection against severe infection by diverse strains influenza A and B viruses, as well as further investigation against infectious diseases more generally.",

Variable gene sequences were isolated from cross-reactive clones by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and further modified to revert nonessential non-germline framework amino acid changes. Full-length human IgG1\u03ba were transiently expressed in CHO cells and purified for use in in vivo studies. Plasmid DMAb constructs were engineered as previously described. 16, 17 DMAb constructs encoded fully human IgG1\u03ba monoclonal antibodies FluA DMAb and FluB DMAb. Antibody amino acid sequences were DNA codon-optimized and RNA-optimized for expression in human/ mouse, and resulting DNA transgenes were synthesized de novo (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). These synthetic transgenes were restriction-cloned into a modified pVax1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) under the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. IgE heavy-chain and light-chain leader sequences were added for cellular processing and secretion. In initial studies (Figs. 1-4) , transgenes consisted of antibody heavy-chain and light-chain sequences separated by a furin/ picornavirus-2A peptide cleavage site sequence, yielding expression of heavy-chain and light-chain peptides from a single plasmid. In later studies with co-administration of FluA and FluB DMAb (Fig. 5) , two FluA DMAb constructs individually expressing heavy-chain or light-chain FluA peptides were mixed for expression of heavy-chain and light-chain FluA peptides from separate plasmids.",

A re-assortant H3 virus produced by reverse genetics (rA/HK/68) contained the H3 HA from A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) and the remaining seven gene segments from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1); the HA of this virus also contained a N165S mutation that enhances murine pathogenesis. 28 All viruses were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs, and virus titers were determined by mean 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) per milliliter. The microneutralization assay was performed as previously described. 27 Briefly, 60 TCID 50 of virus per well was added to three-fold serial dilutions of serum or purified FluB antibody diluted in na\u00efve serum in a 384-well plate in complete MEM medium containing 0.75 \u03bcg/mL N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl keytone Trypsin (Worthington) in duplicate wells. After 1-h incubation at 33\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 , 2 \u00d7 10 4 Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells per well were added to the plate. Plates were incubated at 33\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 for approximately 40 h, and NA activity was measured by adding a fluorescently-labeled substrate methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl neuraminic acid (MU-NANA) (Sigma) to each well at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Virus replication represented by NA activity was quantified by reading fluorescence using the following settings: excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm, ten flashes per well. HAI assay was performed with serum collected on Day 21 post infection as previously described. 27 Intramuscular DNA electroporation Thirty minutes prior to DNA electroporation, female BALB/c and CAnN.Cg-Foxn1 nu /Crl mice (Charles River) were pre-treated at each delivery site with an intramuscular (i.m.) injection of 12 Units (30 \u03bcL) hyaluronidase enzyme (Sigma-Aldrich). Treatment groups were selected at random and data collection was not blinded. In initial studies (Figs. 1-4) , 100 \u03bcg (30 \u03bcL) of either FluA or FluB DMAb plasmid was injected i.m. to the tibialis anterior (TA) and/or quadriceps (Q) muscle; mice received 100 \u03bcg DNA at one site (TA), 200 \u03bcg DNA at two sites (right TA + left TA), or 300 \u03bcg DNA at three sites (right TA + left TA + Q). In later co-administration studies (Fig. 5) , mice received both FluA and FluB DMAb constructs. We modified the FluA construct design to express heavy-chain and light-chain peptides on separate plasmids, generating equivalent serum levels of FluA IgG from fewer injection sites than the one-plasmid design.

The HA-binding activity and neutralization titers of human IgG observed in serum of mice receiving FluA or FluB DMAb plasmid constructs confirmed in vivo expression of functional DMAb and demonstrated the remarkable, broad cross-reactivity of these novel anti-influenza FluA and FluB antibodies. Influenza DMAbs protect mice from diverse influenza A and influenza B lethal challenges To assess the in vivo utility of the technology, DMAb-treated animals were evaluated in lethal influenza challenge models. Animals were administered 300 \u03bcg FluA DMAb plasmid DNA or an irrelevant DMAb construct against dengue virus (DVSF-3) 17 via IM-EP, then challenged with a lethal dose of A/California/7/2009 H1N1 (A/CA/09 H1) 4 days post administration (Fig. 3). For direct in vivo comparison of DMAb and recombinant IgG, a dilution series of FluA protein monoclonal antibody was delivered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to separate groups of mice 1 day prior to infection. Serum samples obtained from all animals at the time of infection showed that FluA DMAb construct delivery resulted in similar mean human IgG concentrations and HA binding activity as observed in mice treated with 0.3 mg/kg of recombinant FluA IgG(Fig. 3a, Supplemental Fig. S3). When challenged with a lethal dose of A/CA/09 H1 virus, FluA DMAb treatment provided a 90% survival benefit whereas all animals treated with control DVSF-3 DMAb succumbed to infection(Fig. 3b). Corresponding to human IgG expression levels, the FluA DMAb treatment and 0.3 mg/kg of FluA purified protein exhibited similar protection from lethality and influenza-induced weight loss(Fig. 3c).Expanding these results with another clinically relevant influenza A virus, a similar study was performed using a lethal challenge of rA/ Hong Kong/8/68 H3N1 (rA/HK/68 H3) 5 days post DMAb administration. Again at the time of infection, human antibody levels showed FluA DMAb and 0.3 mg/kg of recombinant FluA IgG at similar concentrations in sera(Fig. 3d). After lethal rA/HK/68 H3 challenge, FluA DMAb provided a significant survival benefit compared to DMAb control (80% survival rate with FluA DMAb versus 0% survival rate with DVSF-3 DMAb)(Fig. 3e). These results show FluA DMAb effectively protected animals from lethal infection by two clinically relevant seasonal H1 and H3 subtypes known to cause disease in humans, and importantly demonstrates similar in vivo antiviral activity of FluA antibody generated via the DMAb platform versus bioproecessed recombinant FluA antibody-delivered i.p.To evaluate the protective capability of the FluB DMAb, we performed similar lethal challenge studies with influenza B. In these studies, mice were administered 200 \u03bcg FluB DMAb construct or control DMAb construct via IM-EP, then challenged with a lethal dose of virus from the Victoria (B/Malaysia/2506/ 2004 (B/Mal/04)) or Yamagata lineage (B/Florida/4/2006 (B/Fla/ 06)) 5 days later",
