The absence of an animal model has been a striking impedance in defining the molecular basis of disease. Previous work has suggested that SJL/J mice immunize with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2), the major mitochondrial autoantigen of PBC, leads to the development of lymphoid cell infiltration in portal tracts and a model system coined autoimmune cholangitis. We hypothesized that this pathology would be augmented if immunization occurred in the presence of IFN-g injections. Accordingly, SJL/J mice were immunized with PDC-E2 and, for purpose of control, a-casein. Subgroups of mice were also treated with exogenous IFN-g. As expected, mice immunized with PDC-E2, with or without IFN-g, developed high titer AMAs. In contrast, mice immunized with a-casein, develop antinuclear antibodies. More importantly, the livers from mice immunized with PDC-E2 and/or those immunized with a-casein all displayed lymphoid cell infiltration to the portal tracts, irrespective of bile duct size. Indeed, there was no significant difference between the experimental and the control groups by histologic analysis. Thus, autoimmune cholangitis in these mice is antigen non-specific.",

The etiology and pathogenesis of PBC are unknown. High titer AMA react with a series of highly conserved intramitochondrial proteins including the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2), the major autoantigen of PBC. Whether liver injury is caused by AMA (Malmborg et al., 1998; Feehally and Allen, 1999) , PDC-E2 specific T cells (Van de Water et al., 1997; Shimoda et al., 1998; Inada et al., 2000) , NK cells (Tsuneyama et al., 1998; Iwata et al., 2000) or pathological alterations of the bile ducts themselves (Yasoshima et al., 1995; Kimura et al., 1996; Leon et al., 1997) are all being investigated. However, it is important to bear in mind that PBC is an autoimmune disease that most likely develops as a multi-hit disease, not just one insult. It has been theorized that PBC, in a genetically susceptible host, may be initiated by a molecular mimic (Coppel and Gershwin, 1995; Shimoda et al., 2000) or a xenobiotic (Uibo and Salupere, 1999; Long et al., 2001) . However, to this end, no definitive causative agent has, as yet, been identified.",

            "text": "The first reported animal model for PBC was observed in an inbred rabbit strain with spontaneous nonsuppurative cholangitis (Tison et al., 1982) . However, the specificity and repertoire of AMA in these rabbits failed to mimic human disease. More recently, PBC epithelial cells were injected intravenously into neonatally thymectomized A/J mice on the premise that altered epithelial cells may initiate disease (Kobashi et al., 1994; Masanaga et al., 1998) . Also, injection of C57BL/6 mice with purified PDH in LPS or injection of recombinant polypeptides of PDC-E2 (Ide et al., 1996; Kimura et al., 1996) have been attempted. However, although AMAs were induced in all of these proposed models, pathological changes in the liver similar to human PBC were not induced. In contrast, a GVHD model for PBC has also been developed which induces histological pathology but serological responses are not specific for mitochondrial antigens (Tanaka et al., 1999; Zeniya, 2000) . As a whole, all animal models developed to date fail to accurately mimic human PBC by the induction of both AMA and intrahepatic liver damage. With these observations in mind, Jones et al. (2000) reported the appearance of autoimmune cholangitis in SJL/J mice following the immunization of bovine PDC-E2, emulsified in CFA. The SJL/J mouse was chosen because it has been successfully used as models of other autoimmune disease, including experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and mercury induced immunopathology (Vidal et al., 1994; Abedi-Valugerdi and Moller, 2000; Winer et al., 2001) . Further, T cells isolated from affected mice displayed a mixed Th1/Th2 response when stimulated with autoantigen in vitro (Jones et al., 1999) . IFN-g is a Th1 cytokine involved in the generation of antigen-specific T cells and has already been shown to be involved in induction of experimental myasthenia gravis (Wang et al., 2000) . Therefore, we hypothesized that injection of exogenous IFN-g would enhance the development of a PBC-like disease in SJL/J mice immunized with bovine PDC-E2. However, we report herein that while SJL/J mice do demonstrate evidence of significant cholangitis, that such cholangitis is antigen non-specific regardless of IFN-g injection and thus not reflective of PBC.",

            "text": "PBC is an autoimmune disease associated with an inflammatory response localized to the small bile duct cells of the liver Ludwig, 2000) . While attempts to establish an animal model for PBC in a number of animal species, including several strains of mice, have had with little success (Krams et al., 1989; Zeniya, 2000) , Jones et al. have proposed an animal model for PBC termed \"experimental autoimmune cholangitis\" in which SJL/J mice are immunized with purified bovine PDC-E2 (Jones et al., 2000) . Both the use of SJL/J mice and bovine PDC-E2 may have been important factors in establishing this proposed model of PBC. Unclear susceptibility factors in SJL/J mice have made these mice useful for the establishment of models of other autoimmune diseases (Vidal et al., 1994; Abedi-Valugerdi and Moller, 2000; Winer et al., 2001) . Additionally, purified bovine PDC-E2 may be more efficient at inducing an immune response for several reasons. In our hands, native PDC-E2 isolated from bovine heart tissue induces a stronger response than E. coli-produced recombinant protein when injected into mice (unpublished data). First, it has been suggested that lipoic acid is essential for optimal antigenicity (Fregeau et al., 1990; Bassendine et al., 1998; Koike et al., 1998) . Native protein is lipoated while synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins may not be lipoated. Second, it is important to note that bovine PDC-E2 differs from murine PDC-E2 by 28% at the amino acid level as determined by a protein blast. However, the antigenic region of bovine PDC-E2, including lipoic acid, has high homology with the murine protein and thus select regions may be recognized as a foreign antigen or altered self by the murine immune system. It thus may induce a stronger immune response against the autoantigen than a recombinant self protein or peptide (Coppel and Gershwin, 1995; Mackay, 2000) .",

We also injected purified bovine PDC-E2 as the antigen to initiate the immune response in SJL/J mice. Our control group was not injected with CFA alone, as in the study by Jones et al., but with a-Casein and CFA. Mild bile duct pathology was induced by immunization with bovine PDC-E2 emulsified in CFA. However, similar pathology was also noted in the mice immunized with the control protein (a-Casein) emulsified in the same adjuvant. Antigen specific AMA were successfully induced in experimental SJL/J mice but not control mice. However, the characteristic bile duct injury typical of PBC failed to develop even after 30 weeks, although mild bile duct pathology and portal inflammation persisted. Furthermore, inflammation and diffuse bile duct pathology were observed, irrespective of bile duct size. In contrast, only small bile ducts are damaged in human PBC and affected bile ducts are distributed sparsely, not diffusely (Sasaki et al., 2000) .",

The addition of IFN-g did not change the specificity or intensity of histologic or serologic effects. These results are not surprising since the pathology observed herein is antigen non-specific. Hence, this system is different from the disease associated features of IFN-g when NOD mice are injected with exogenous cytokines (Xiang and Zaccone, 1999) . Alternatively, treatment of IFN-g may cause classswitching of antigen specific AMA to IgG1. It is possible that IgG1 is not pathogenic. In fact, recently our lab has demonstrated that IgA may significantly contribute to the pathology of PBC (Reynoso-Paz et al., 2000) . In this respect, we should note that mice do not have IgA receptors on their bile duct cells and, in fact, have a significantly different mucosal immune system than that of humans .",

Portal inflammation with bile duct invasion and damage occurred with similar frequency in both groups. There is no indication that the development of portal inflammation was specific to a loss of tolerance to PDC-E2, though the severity of inflammation was greater in mice expressing anti-PDC-E2 autoantibodies. Thus, both the development of autoantibodies and portal tract inflammation may simply reflect the severity of the inflammatory response following ip injection. SJL/J mice appear to be predisposed to the development of portal inflammation with minimal provocation.",

Generally, AA type amyloidosis occurs secondary to systemic chronic inflammatory changes such as rheumatoid arthritis and tuberculosis. Heretofore, AA amyloidosis in mice has been previously induced in a number of strains of mice by repeated injections of a-casein, chemicals and endotoxin (Skinner et al., 1977; Baumal, 1979; Rokita et al., 1989; Kisilevsky and Young, 1994; Sipe, 1994) , and in a transgenic mouse model carrying human IL-6 gene with mouse metallothionein-I promoter (Solomon et al., 1999) . Spontaneous amyloid deposits have also been noted in aged SJL/J mice. In fact, the injection of amyloid enhancing factor (AEF) together with a-casein in CFA induced AA amyloidosis in SJL/J mice, while a-casein alone did not induce amyloidosis (Rokita et al., 1989) . Our findings are in agreement with these findings but not those of Jones et al. (1999) .",
