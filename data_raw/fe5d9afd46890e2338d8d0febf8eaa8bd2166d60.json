It is primarily caused by infection of the respiratory epithelial cells by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) although other respiratory viruses including adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza and human metapneumovirus may also contribute. Bronchiolitis is characterised by extensive inflammation of the lower airways with an associated increase in mucus production and necrosis of epithelial tissue. Clinically, bronchiolitis is manifested by presence of tachypnoea with wheeze and/or crepitations with a preceding upper respiratory illness.",

            "text": "Bronchiolitis (with or without pneumonia) is the most common cause of admission in children aged under 12-months. In a Central Australian study, we described a prevalence of approximately 190 per 1000 children for RSV bronchiolitis. [1] The prevalence of all causes of bronchiolitis would indeed be higher. In our setting, coexistent pneumonia is high in Indigenous children and, at the Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH), the majority of children with bronchiolitis are also treated with antibiotics. The co-existent pneumonia is likely related to the high carriage rate and early acquisition of respiratory pathogens in Indigenous children compared to non-Indigenous children. [2] We have reviewed 100 charts of children hospitalised with bronchiolitis at the RDH and found that the readmission rate of Indigenous children for their next bronchiolitis episode within 6-months was 30% (unpublished). As the majority of these children hospitalised for bronchiolitis are retrieved from remote communities, the impact of the illness and costs plus social dislocation is significant. Furthermore recurrent lower respiratory tract infection is an independent significant risk factor for the later development of bronchiectasis [3] and lower pulmonary function in later years. [4] In addition the severity of the hospitalised episode (oxygen requirement and length of hospital stay) were also risk factors for development of bronchiectasis. [3] In our retrospective chart review we found that Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis had more severe bronchiolitis than non-Indigenous infants (unpublished). In Indigenous infants, the severity score at presentation, number of days requiring oxygen and length of hospitalisation were all significantly worse or longer than in non-Indigenous infants (p=0.0001, 0.004, 0.001 respectively). Thus any intervention that is efficacious in reducing the severity of bronchiolitis and/or readmission for bronchiolitis in Indigenous children would be beneficial in both short and long term outcomes.",

            "text": "There are 2 published randomised controlled trials on RSV-bronchiolitis with contrasting results. In the Turkish study in hospitalised infants, clarithromycin was effective in reducing the length of hospital stay, severity of illness (oxygen use) as well as readmission rate in infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis . [5] However in the European based study (primarily from Netherlands), azithromycin was not efficacious in infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis . [6] We suspect that while there are many possible reasons for the difference in efficacy, the major reason for the difference found relates to the setting ie infants in Turkey are more likely to have concomitant bacterial infection compared to the affluent European group. Childhood bronchiectasis remains a problem in Turkey [7] similar to that found in Indigenous children living in the NT . [8] It is highly likely that Indigenous infants in our setting will be similar to that of the Turkish infants. However, it is important to establish whether azithromycin is indeed efficacious in our setting given that extrapolating data from developing countries may result in poorer outcomes . [9] Bronchiolitis in NT Indigenous children is complicated by the known early colonisation of the nasopharynx by bacterial pathogens, notably Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae . [2, 10] Whilst both are macrolides, azithromycin has several benefits over clarithromycin in the Northern Territory setting. Azithromycin is active against a range of respiratory pathogens which colonise NT indigenous infants from a young age (in particular gram negative bacteria including H. influenzae). Also azithromycin is currently widely used in the Northern Territory for bronchiectasis, trachoma and sexually transmitted diseases. It has a longer half life and better tissue penetration than clarithromycin, thus requiring a much shorter treatment regime. Once weekly dosing has been shown to be sufficient for tissue effects lasting over a week. [11] As the pharmacodynamic/kinetic properties of azithromycin are superior to clarithromycin, we have elected to use azithromycin rather then clarithromycin.",

[12] Given that acquisition and colonisation of respiratory pathogens occur very early in Indigenous infants (as early as 2 weeks) [2, 10] and current data on biofilms present in people with chronic upper respiratory infections, [13] we propose that azithromycin may be a valuable intervention for clinical outcomes of Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis.
