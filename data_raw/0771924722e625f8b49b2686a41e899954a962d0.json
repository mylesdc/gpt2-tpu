            "text": "Basic and translational research on lung biology has discovered multiple progenitor cell types, specialized or facultative, responsible for turnover, renewal, and repair. Isolation of populations of resident lung progenitor cells (LPCs) has been described by multiple protocols, and some have been successfully applied to healthy human lung tissue. We aimed at understanding how different cell culture conditions may affect, in vitro, the phenotype of LPCs to create an ideal niche-like microenvironment. The influence of different substrates (i.e., fibronectin, gelatin, laminin) and the impact of a three-dimensional/two-dimensional (3D/2D) culture switch on the biology of LPCs isolated as lung spheroids (LSs) from normal adult human lung biopsy specimens were investigated. We applied a spheroid culture system as the selective/inductive step for progenitor cell culture, as described in many biological systems. The data showed a niche-like proepithelial microenvironment inside the LS, highly sensitive to the 3D culture system and significantly affecting the phenotype of adult LPCs more than culture substrate. LSs favor epithelial phenotypes and LPC maintenance and contain cells more responsive to specific commitment stimuli than 2D monolayer cultures, while secreting a distinctive set of paracrine factors. We have shown for the first time, to our knowledge, how culture as 3D LSs can affect LPC epithelial phenotype and produce strong paracrine signals with a distinctive secretomic profile compared with 2D monolayer conditions. These findings suggest novel approaches to maintain ex vivo LPCs for basic and translational studies. STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE 2016;5:1-11 SIGNIFICANCE A lung niche-like microenvironment was created ex vivo inside the pneumosphere. Pneumospheres have a distinctive secretomic profile compared with two-dimensional culture. Three-dimensional culture switch significantly affects lung progenitor phenotype. Lung progenitors in pneumospheres were more committed toward epithelial lineages.",

Phenotype control of isolated cells represents a delicate task to manage in vitro, for both basic and translational research. Multiple stimuli play synergic roles on lung stem cell niches, modulating proliferation, commitment, epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) or the opposite mesenchymalto-epithelial transition, and crosstalk with stroma [4, 9, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The extracellular matrix has a central influence as well. Different proteins are known to affect progenitor phenotype and regenerative potential, such as laminin [21, 22] , fibronectin [21, 23] , and collagen/gelatin [24] , depending on the cell type and on the developmental stage. Moreover, standard two-dimensional (2D) culture systems deeply differ from the in situ microenvironment, whereas three-dimensional (3D) conditions often provide multiple advantages for many systems [25] [26] [27] .",

In this study, we have investigated the influence of different substrates and a 3D/2D culture switch on the biology of LPCs isolated as spheroids from normal adult human lung biopsy specimens, whose translational relevance has been recently highlighted [14] , characterizing their differential phenotype and paracrine properties. We show how culture as spheroids can significantly increase LPCs' epithelial commitment compared with culture as monolayers, and how they can gain paracrine and phenotypical features of an ex vivo epithelial progenitor cell niche. Our data support for lung tissue the same notion derived from other tissues; that is, in vitro 3D culture systems are among the most effective approaches to control stemness/commitment balance, and to create ex vivo a functional niche-like microenvironment for progenitor maintenance and commitment.",

After institutional review board approval and signed informed consent, lung tissue was obtained from 3 patients (1 26-year-old woman and 2 men, ages 18 and 20 years) who underwent lung surgery for benign disease at the Division of Thoracic Surgery, \"Sant'Andrea\" Hospital (\"La Sapienza\" University of Rome, Italy). Lung tissue biopsies were obtained during videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery procedures using a mechanical stapler (Echelon Endopath; Johnson & Johnson, Somerville NJ, http://www.ethicon.com). Cell culture protocol was based on other spheroid culture systems [9, 10, 14, 28, 29] . In particular, lung tissue from each patient was thoroughly washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and mechanically minced into 1-to 2-mm 3 pieces, digested for 15 minutes in 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, divided into equal amounts, and then plated as primary explants on Petri dishes coated with fibronectin (FN; BD Biosciences, East Rutherford NJ, http://www.bdbiosciences.com), gelatin (GEL), or laminin (LAM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis MO, http:// www.sigmaaldrich.com) in complete explant medium (CEM). CEM medium is made of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillinstreptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. After 3-4 weeks, outgrowth explant-derived cells (EDCs) were harvested by serial washes with PBS, EDTA, and mild trypsinization, and plated on poly-D-lysine-coated multiwell plates at 6,000 cells per cm 2 in pneumosphere growth medium (PGM). PGM medium is made of 35% IMDM plus 65% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 mix, supplemented with 3.5% serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 unit/ml thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1:50 B-27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences, Waltham, MA, http://www.thermofisher.com), 80 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, and 25 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, http:// www.peprotech.com). After 1 week, lung spheroids, here named pneumospheres (PSs), were collected by pipetting and centrifugation (50 relative centrifugal force [rcf]), and plated as PS-derived cells (PDCs) on the corresponding coating in CEM media. Secondary PSs (IIPSs) were obtained again by replating PDCs on poly-D-lysine coating. For differentiation stimuli, PDCs and PSs were cultured for 1 week in bronchial/epithelial growth medium (BEGM; Lonza, Basel, Switzerland, http://www.lonza.com). The isolation procedure is summarized in Figure 1A . Spheroid dissociation was achieved by 10-minute incubation in trypsin 0.05% with gentle pipetting every 2 minutes.",

Also, PSs contained a majority of TTF1+ cells (Fig.  2B ) while expressing very low levels of VIM.

Irrespective of the coating, almost all markers were significantly upregulated in PSs compared with PDCs, considering a wide panel of genes for stemness (TTF-1, CCSP, NGFR, and p63), pneumocytes (i.e., AQP5, SFTPA1, and SFTPA2), endothelium (i.e., AQP1 and KDR), and basal epithelium (i.e., KRT18, KRT14, and KRT5). This suggested a spontaneous 3D organization in a microtissue-like structure, inducing epithelial committed phenotypes. The significant, albeit slight, upregulation of Snai1 and b-catenin also suggested that partial EMT mechanisms are involved in PS formation, as already described for other spheroid culture systems [9, [34] [35] [36] . Vimentin expression was significantly downregulated in PSs versus PDCs, consistently with the observed immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2C, 2H) .

IIPSs resembled all features of primary PSs. In fact, a clear on/off switch in the expression of key epithelial markers (KRT5, pro-SFTPC) could be observed between 3D (both PSs, IIPSs) and 2D (PDCs) culture by immunofluorescence staining, with the opposite switch for vimentin expression (supplemental online Fig. 1) . To further characterize the phenotype, we performed a double-labeling EpCam/CD90 for flow cytometry. Cells were mainly CD90+ at all stages (supplemental online Fig. 2a) . Results showed that a small EpCam+/CD90+ double-positive population was present in a constant proportion among EDCs, PSs, PDCs, and secondary PSs stages (supplemental online Fig. 2b-2d) ,thus suggesting the stromal, albeit plastic, nature of the cell population overall. To fully elucidate the apparent mesenchymal traits acquired in 2D culture by PDCs, we also performed a mesodermal multilineage differentiation assay on EDCs and PDCs for the three mesenchymal lineages: osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic (supplemental online Fig. 3) . EDCs displayed an incomplete mesenchymal potential, because osteogenic differentiation was not detectable. PDCs selected after the spheroid stage, however, contained a subpopulation with partial ability for multilineage mesodermal transdifferentiation. Nonetheless, such potential was dramatically lower than that of lung mesenchymal stem cells (L-MSCs), independently isolated from lung parenchyma, shown as the positive control in supplemental online Figure 2 . Thus, PDCs significantly differed from resident L-MSCs, and the mesenchymal-like traits acquired in 2D seemed consistent with a transient mesenchymal transition of progenitors induced when not in optimal 3D culture conditions.",

In fact, stemness/progenitor genes (i.e., TTF-1, CCSP, NGFR, Oct4, and p63), AT2 markers (i.e., SFPTA1 and SFTPA2), and basal epithelial genes (i.e., KRT18 and KRT5) were significantly upregulated compared with control media. AQP5, which was spontaneously upregulated in PSs, was downregulated after BEGM exposure; this was consistent with the induction of a preferential bronchiolar versus alveolar phenotype by this culture media. Endothelial markers were modulated, with a further increase in KDR levels but a decrease in AQP1, which was downregulated in a similar proportion in PDCs as well. PDC gene expression levels were mostly unaffected by specific BEGM media treatment except for a slight decrease in p63 expression and increase in b-CAT expression. PSs cultured in BEGM were also analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (Fig. 4B) . Vimentin expression was confirmed to be very low, whereas strong Oct4 expression was detectable. Few KRT18+ cells were detectable inside PSs after BEGM culture; KRT5+ and SFPTC+ cells were still detectable in outer PS layers but appeared to involve a thicker portion than basic culture conditions, consistent with the upregulated gene expression levels.",

Multiple proteins from the extracellular matrix have been shown to influence cell phenotype and stemness [21, 22] . In our model, different substrates were minimally able to significantly modulate the phenotype of LPCs grown as monolayers of PDCs (Fig. 3B) . Conversely, a culture switch to the 3D spheroid system of the PS was very efficient in committing cells toward epithelial phenotypes, independently of the original coating (Figs. 2, 3E; supplemental online Fig. 1) . Moreover, LPCs as 3D PSs were significantly more responsive than PDCs to specific commitment stimuli, such as culture in BEGM media (Fig. 4) . Overall, these data support the creation of a 3D, proepithelial niche-like structure for adult LPCs inside PSs [9, 13] .",

            "text": "Results show that PSs and PDCs contain a stromal lung progenitor population with clonal growth capacities (Fig. 3C) , together with the expression of TTF-1, Oct4 [33] , pro-SFTPC, and KRT5 ( Fig. 2G-2J) , which are markers of AT2 and basal stem cells. Consistently, KRT14 expression, considered as a marker of AT2 regenerative activation after injury [47] , was upregulated in PSs. The combination of AT2 and mesenchymal cells has been described as an ex vivo lung niche model [13] . In our study, we further supported this notion by showing, for the first time to our knowledge, the peculiar paracrine properties of human PSs ( Fig. 5 ; supplemental online Table 2 ). In fact, we have identified several distinctive secreted factors in PS-CM known to play a key role in lung homeostasis, development, injury, and cell-cell communications. When comparing the paracrine profile of 3D with 2D culture, a specific modulation is evident of multiple humoral factors (Fig. 5) , including a downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., MCP1, tumor necrosis factors, GCP2, BLC, eotaxin) and an upregulation of the growth factors EGF and IGF1 in PSs. EGF is the main mitogenic stimuli for AT2, for both normal alveolar renewal and response to injury [48, 49] , and it is released in higher amounts in 3D PSs consistently with increased epithelial commitment (Figs. 2, 3E; supplemental online Fig. 1 ). On the contrary, the mesenchymal factor TGFb1, which exerts a major role in collagen production and induction of EMT associated with pathological fibrosis [50] [51] [52] , is secreted only by PDCs and not in the niche-like stage of PSs. Although lung progenitor cells derived from spheroids have been shown to exert antifibrotic effects [14] , these results suggest that the administration of LPCs as PSs could even enhance this beneficial property. Further studies will clarify this hypothesis.",

Thus, PDCs likely represent a single bipotent stromal progenitor population expressing minimal epithelial features but capable of significant epithelial commitment when cultured in optimal spheroid conditions, consistently with similar phenomena observed in vivo [56] . In fact, increased vimentin expression by lung epithelial cells has been described as a TGF-b1-dependent reversible response to stress and injury [56] , consistently with superior TGF-b1 release in PDC 2D culture (Fig. 5) . These data further confirm how culture as spheroids provides a more physiologically alike and epithelial-prone microenvironment.

In the PS model, multiple lung stemness markers, such as NGFR, Oct4, and p63, were upregulated, both compared with 2D culture (Fig. 3E) and in response to BEGM exposure (Fig. 4 ). The striking differential and opposite modulation of vimentin levels observed among PSs, PDCs, and secondary PSs (Figs. 2, 3E; supplemental online Fig. 1 ) further supports loss of mesenchymal traits inside the PS. Also, b-catenin was significantly upregulated in PSs compared with PDC monolayers, and it has been associated with protection against fibrosis, promotion of epithelial cell survival [60] , and prevention of differentiation of epithelial progenitors [61] .",

This feature makes PSs more prone to LPC maintenance and more responsive to specific epithelial commitment stimuli than 2D monolayer cell cultures. Also, we have shown for the first time how PSs produce strong paracrine signals and have a distinctive secretomic profile significantly affected by the 3D culture switch. Thus the modulation of 3D growth alone could be a powerful tool to control stemness and epithelial commitment in in vitro models of lung progenitor cells.",

(C): Representative image of PDC clonogenesis experiments, and corresponding efficiency analysis of different coatings by semiautomatic identification and quantification of clones (white asterisks). (D): PDC immunophenotype was unaffected by the coating and was analyzed by cytofluorimetry for a panel of hematopoietic, vascular, and mesenchymal markers, supporting their stromal nature. (E): Gene expression levels were analyzed by real-time PCR and compared between PSs and PDCs. Expression levels for genes of both undifferentiated and committed profiles were significantly upregulated in three-dimensional (3D) PSs compared with two-dimensional (2D) PDCs, suggesting an enhanced niche-like microenvironment inside the PS. p, p , .05 versus plastic or 2D; #, p , .01 versus 2D.
