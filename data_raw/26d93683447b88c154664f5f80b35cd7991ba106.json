In vitro, the effect of NPF on cellular infectivity of PPV was carried out before and after adding drug and simultaneous adding and PPV after being mixed. In vivo, the anti-PPV effect of NPF in guinea pigs was performed. Results. The results showed that NPF could significantly inhibit PPV infecting porcine kidney-(PK-) 15 cells compared with propolis flavone (PF), and the activity of NPF was the best in preadding drug pattern. NPF at high and medium doses was able to observably restrain PPV copying in lung, gonad, blood, and spleen, decrease the impact of PPV on weight of guinea pigs, and improve hemagglutination inhibition (HI) of PPV in serum. In addition, it could also increase the contents of IL-2 and IL-6 in serum after PPV challenge. Conclusion. These results indicated that NPF could significantly improve the anti-PPV activity of PF, and its high concentration possessed the best efficacy. Therefore, NPF would be expected to be exploited into a new-style antiviral drug.",

Porcine parvovirus (PPV) characterized as a member of the autonomous parvoviruses is one of main pathogens that could cause reproductive failure in pregnant sows, which is characterized by fetal and embryonic death, stillbirths, mummification, and delayed return to oestrus [2] . Although the acute infection of postnatal and nonpregnant pigs is often subclinical, PPV has been linked to interstitial nephritis in slaughter aged pigs [3] , skin lesion occurrence in piglets [4] , and nonsuppurative myocarditis in lactating piglets. Recently, PPV has gained attention as an agent able to potentiate the effects of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection in the clinical course on postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, a worldwide significant economical disease [5] . Besides its association with the pathological conditions and abovementioned clinical, vaccination with inactivated PPV is generally considered to offer good protection against PPV and is used to control reproductive failure due to PPV. Several inactivated aluminum hydroxide adjuvant vaccines for PPV immunoprophylaxis are available in the United States and oil emulsion adjuvant vaccine of PPV is licensed by veterinary drug standard of the People's Republic of China.",

Diels, and Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.), respectively, have been developed into antiviral or antibacterial agents [7] . On the one hand, many researches demonstrated that CHMs or CHMIs contain many antiviral active materials, but many active materials had still not been discovered. On the other hand, CHMs or CHMIs possess many biological activities, such as inhibiting viral processes (adsorption, transcription, replication, and release), adjusting immunologic function, and antioxidant, which shows dependable biological functions with light side effects and little toxicity [8] . Moreover, new virus or variant strains of old virus arise continually. So, antiviral drug screened from CHMs became a hotspot for many investigators.",

Propolis is rich in biochemical constituents, and more than 300 compounds have been identified in it. Flavone is one of the most important pharmacologically active constituents in propolis and is thought to be responsible for many of its biological and pharmacological activities. It is well known for valuable health benefit and is reported to possess reliably biological activities, including antivirus, immune enhancement, antioxidation, antibiosis, hepatoprotection, anticancer, and antifatigue [9] [10] [11] . It is an excellent immune system booster and natural antibiotic with no side effects. Recently, propolis has become an issue of increasing interest among the investigators owing to its versatile biological activities. Due to these biological activities, propolis has been broadly marketed as the health-food and alternative medicine in various parts of the world. Propolis flavone (PF), a kind of ingredient extracted from propolis, as a harmless natural adjuvant and antivirus has been used in chickens vaccinated with activated or inactivated vaccine. Many studies all proved that PF could improve the immune-enhancing activity in the cellular and humoral immune response [9] . In addition, our previous study also demonstrated that the adjuvant effects and feature of PF on inactivated PPV vaccine to guinea pigs had been considered successfully in cellular and humoral immunity [12] .",

These results suggested that NPF could effectively inhibit PPV from infecting PK-15 cell in vitro, and the preventative effect was better than those of the sterilization and treatment. The reasons may be that the particle size of NPF is small and quite homogeneous, so it is more advantageous in penetrating cell membrane and being absorbed by cell. When the NPF enters into the organism, it can decelerate the drug release and lengthen the action time of drug in organism by preventing the drug from degrading rapidly. Many other researches in vivo also confirmed that the efficacy of drug after nanocrystallization was significantly better than conventional drug [17] , which was consistent with this experimental result. The virus content in infectious cell is also an indicator for antiviral effect of drug [12] . In this test, the content of PPV in PK-15 cell in groups NPF and PF was observably lower than this of the corresponding virus control group in the three modes. In addition, the content of PPV in PK-15 cell group NPF was markedly fewer than this of the corresponding PF group in three adding drug patterns at the proper concentration.

And at high and middle dose, the PPV content in NPF group was significantly lower than this of the corresponding PF and CC group in tissues of lung, gonad, spleen, and blood. The results suggested that NPF could effectively inhibit PPV infecting tissue of lung and gonad. Gonad is the key organ for PPV replication.

This could make challenged animals more effectively resist virus infection. Fan et al. [20] also confirmed that PF, designed to microemulsion, was able to significantly increase the thymus and spleen indices and enhance the contents of IgM and IgG in serum.

IL-2 is a cytokines secreted by type 1 helper T cells (Th1 cells) and able to mediate cellular immunity. IL-2 is also able to promote production of immunoglobulins and stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of natural killer cells and is indispensable for the T-cell immunologic memory [23] .

The present research demonstrated that NPF could improve the cellular and humoral immunity and thus was able to protect guinea pigs from attack by PPV. The ability of modulating the synthesis of antibodies and cytokines secretion is part of the NPF activity compared PF. Despite the fact that the precise action mechanism of NPF on the immune system remains unknown, with further probable amplification of the immune cells reaction can be one of its main antiviral mechanisms [25, 26] .",

Therefore, nanotechnology could observably enhance the anti-PPV activity of PF. Further studies on the safety, stability, and the mechanism of action of NPF are needed to pursue its potential for clinical applications as antiviral drug. ",
