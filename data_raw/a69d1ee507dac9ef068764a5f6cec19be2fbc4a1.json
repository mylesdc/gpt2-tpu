In an alternate model, baicalein was administered to male Balb/c mice which were given either IL-4 or IL-13 intranasally. Features of asthma were determined by estimating airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), histopathological changes and biochemical assays of key inflammatory molecules. Airway injury was determined with apoptotic assays, transmission electron microscopy and assessing key mitochondrial functions. Baicalein treatment reduced AHR and inflammation in both experimental models. TGF-b 1 , sub-epithelial fibrosis and goblet cell metaplasia, were also reduced. Furthermore, baicalein treatment significantly reduced 12/15-LOX activity, features of mitochondrial dysfunctions, and apoptosis of bronchial epithelia.",

            "text": "Asthma is associated with recruitment of various inflammatory cells such as eosinophils and lymphocytes to the airway. These cells release various reactive free radicals to create an oxidative microenvironment in the airway [1] , which injures structural cells of airway such as bronchial epithelial cells. Repeated allergic inflammation leads to irreversible epithelial injury and causes the detachment of ciliated bronchial epithelial cells from the basement membrane. In support of this view, epithelial clumps have been found in sputum (creola bodies) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of asthmatic patients [2] . While inflammatory cells such as Th 2 lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells have historically occupied center stage in asthma research, recent reports have highlighted the critical role of epithelial stress in deciding the immune responses within the lung [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Epithelial injury is now considered to be one of the primary pathogenic mechanisms for the development of various features of allergic asthma [8] . Interestingly, restoring mitochondrial function of airway epithelia is sufficient to reduce acute lung injury, indicating the efficiency of mitochondria in maintaining epithelial homeostasis and thus the viability of the lung [9] . We and others have previously demonstrated the association of mitochondrial structural changes in bronchial epithelia with asthma, and the pro-inflammatory effects of mitochondrial dysfunction [10] [11] [12] . Thus, it is of interest to explore therapeutic agents that can restore mitochondrial function as a means of reducing the deleterious effects of airway epithelial injury.",

It possesses a wide range of biological activities such as antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and anticancer effects [13] . It has been shown to inhibit the activity of the 15-lipoxygenase , which has been implicated in mitochondrial degradation in reticulocytes. It also reduces eotaxin production in cultured human fibroblasts stimulated by the combination of interleukin-4 and TNF-a [14] . Though it has been suggested that baicalein may have anti-allergic effects based on in-vitro studies [15] , this has not been confirmed in vivo. Importantly, baicalein reduces neuronal injury [16, 17] , and inhibits retinal epithelial apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide [18] . In light of this, we hypothesized that baicalein may have antiasthma activity.",

To determine the effect of baicalein on AHR, single chamber plethysmography was performed (see Materials and Methods). The concentration of methacholine (MCh) at which mice had developed 200% increase in enhanced pause (Penh) from the baseline values (MCh PC200 Penh) was determined. Penh is an index of airway hyperresponsiveness and it is directly proportional to airway obstruction. At the end of allergen challenge, the OVA/OVA/VEH group (allergic control mice) exhibited the development of AHR as those mice developed airway obstruction even at the low doses of methacholine than the SHAM/PBS/VEH (normal control mice). In this model, BAIC reduced AHR in a dose dependent manner and the optimal effective dose was 10 mg/kg (Fig. 1B) . Therefore subsequent experiments were performed using the 10 mg/kg dose, unless otherwise indicated. For confirmation, we again estimated AHR, this time through invasive airway mechanics, which are considered more reliable. This confirmed that BAIC (10 mg/kg) treatment to OVA induced mice was associated with a significant reduction in AHR (Fig. 1C ).",

Thus, therapeutic strategies were focused on reducing airway inflammation. However, recent reports including ours suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction and epithelial injury are crucial in allergic airway inflammatory diseases, such as asthma [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In addition, it has been demonstrated that epithelia may influence the immune status of the lung. It has also been strongly suggested that different therapeutic approaches can be devised by focusing more on protecting vulnerable airways against allergen induced injury [8] . In this study, we have evaluated the potency of baicalein in reducing airway injury, mitochondrial dysfunction and alleviating the features of allergic asthma. We used allergic models and Th 2 cytokine models to demonstrate the efficacy of baicalein in preventing airway injury. We found that baicalein ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction, reduces airway injury and attenuates various features of airway inflammation, not only in the allergic model but also the Th 2 cytokine models.",

Earlier studies showed that baicalein reduced the production of eotaxin and stromal derived factor [14, 25] , which are well known for their chemoattractant properties to recruit different types of leukocytes and eosinophil from the vasculature. Interestingly, baicalein inhibits TNF-a induced adhesion molecule expression in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells [26] . In this study, baicalein treatment to allergic mice modulated the Th 1 /Th 2 response by increasing IFN-c, OVA specific IgG2a and decreasing IL-4 and IL-13. Further, baicalein treatment to OVA induced mice resulted in the reduction in TLR2 levels without affecting TLR-4 levels. A similar reduction of TLR-2 by baicalein has been reported in neurons [27] . In addition, baicalein reduced the levels of 15-LOX metabolites such as 13-(S)-HODE and 9-(S)-HODE, which have been shown to be important in various features of inflammation such as chemotactic stimulation of leukocytes, and the activation and migration of lymphocytes [28] . Consequently, the modulation of these different proinflammatory mediators by baicalein might explain the reduction of airway inflammation we observed in this study.",

Therefore, the reduction of mitochondrial dysfunction and restoration of ultra structural changes by baicalein could either be due to 15-LOX inhibition, or by indirect mechanisms such as the reduction of IL-4, IL-13 and lipid peroxidation. However, since baicalein is a nonspecific 12/15-LOX inhibitor, the observed effects of baicalein may not be due to 15-LOX inhibition alone. We have also found that baicalein treatment reduced the levels of secretory phospholipase A2 (data not shown), which is known to be a proinflammatory mediator in asthma pathogenesis [29] .

            "text": "Epithelial injury is one of the primary pathogenic mechanisms in asthma, since it initiates airway remodeling by inducing various growth factors such as TGF-b 1 . It has been shown that baicalein has anti-fibrotic properties in in vitro studies [38] . In this study, baicalein had reduced the expression of TGF-b 1 along with the reduction of collagen deposition in sub-epithelial regions. This is likely related to the inhibition of epithelial injury and pro-survival effects discussed above. Interestingly, baicalein treatment also reduced goblet cell metaplasia, which is an important aspect of other obstructive airway diseases like chronic bronchitis (Fig. 2) . The mechanism of this is unclear, but appears to be a direct effect since baicalein pretreatment to IL-13 induced human bronchial epithelia reduced Muc5Ac levels in an in vitro study (Muc5Ac levels in pg/25 mg protein were 6.260.4, 11.561.3, 11.667.2, 6.761.6, 5.761.9 for uninduced, IL-13 induced with vehicle treated, and IL-13 induced and pretreated with 7.5 mM, 15 mM and 30 mM baicalein, respectively). 15-LOX has been previously implicated in goblet cell metaplasia [39] [40] . Since baicalein has a broad spectrum of biological activities, the exact mechanism underlying its anti-asthma activities in this study are not clear. However, the inhibition of various proinflammatory mediators such as IL-4, IL-13, TGF-b 1 , 15-LOX, and reduction of 15-LOX metabolites such as 13-(S)-HODE and 9-(S)-HODE, are likely to lead to reduction of bronchial epithelial injury and consequent airway remodeling could be possible mechanisms by which baicalein reduces asthma features. In summary, baicalein treatment to either allergic or Th 2 cytokine induced mice reduces airway epithelial injury, ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction, and various features of airway inflammation, in a mouse models and this could have an important implication in developing therapeutic strategies towards airway injury in asthma.",

Baicalein was dissolved in 5-10% dimethyl sulfoxide, vehicle. BAIC or VEH was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) from day 21 to 32 twice a day in 100 ml volume per dose in preventive model and similar dose was given from day 27 to 32 in therapeutic model ( Figure 1A) . It is to be noted that other studies have used very high doses of baicalein (up to 520 mg/kg oral) without having any adverse effects [41, 42] . We have used two different treatment durations to demonstrate the preventive and therapeutic effects of baicalein. Importantly we have not observed any adverse effects such as inflammation, loss of weight etc. in these mice or in na\u00efve mice which have been given similar doses of baicalein for the similar duration (data not shown). In Th 2 cytokines model, 3 mg (30 ml) carrier-free recombinant murine IL-13 or IL-4 (R&D Systems) in 1% BSA or 1% BSA alone was instilled into the nasal openings of each isofluraneanesthetized mouse, twice a day for 2 days and mice were treated with BAIC or VEH intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice a day for two days ( Figure 4A ).

Then mice were challenged with PBS or different concentrations of MCh aerosol and signal were recorded with in-built software (Buxco) to determine the Penh values which are reliable in Balb/c mice [10] . Then MCh PC200 [the partial concentration of methacholine which is required to double the baseline enhanced pause (Penh)] was calculated. To confirm the findings from noninvasive body plethysmography, respiratory mechanics were determined during mechanical ventilation (flexiVent system, Scireq, Canada) as previously described [44] . Briefly, anesthetized mice were intubated after tracheostomy, ventilated with computercontrolled ventilator and airway resistance with different concen-trations of MCh was estimated using the flexiVent system (Scireq) that integrates ventilator with the respiratory mechanics [44] .",
