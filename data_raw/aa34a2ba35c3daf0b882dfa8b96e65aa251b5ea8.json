More and more, these models are being used for predicting, understanding and developing control strategies. To be used in specific contexts, modeling approaches have shifted from \"strategic models\" (where a caricature of real processes is modeled in order to emphasize first principles) to \"tactical models\" (detailed representations of real situations). Tactical models are useful for cost-benefit and scenario analyses. Good examples are the foot-and-mouth epidemic models for UK, triggered by the need of a response to the 2001 epidemic [1, 2] and the simulation of pandemic flu in differ-ent scenarios helping authorities to choose among alternative intervention strategies [3, 4] .",

One example would be a classification based on the states assumed by the nodes: networks with discretestate nodes have nodes characterized by a discrete variable representing its epidemiological status (for example, susceptible, infected, recovered). The state of a node changes in response to the state of neighbor nodes, as defined by the network topology and a set of transmission rules. Networks with continuous-state nodes, on the other hand, have node' state described by a quantitative variable (number of susceptibles, density of infected individuals, for example), modelled as a function of the history of the node and its neighbors. The importance of the concept of neighborhood on any kind of network epidemic model stems from its large overlap with the concept of transmission. In network epidemic models, transmission either defines or is defined/constrained by the neighborhood structure. In the latter case, a neighborhood structure is given a priori which will influence transmissibility between nodes.",

We expect that this software will stimulate the use and development of networks models for epidemiological purposes. The paper is organized as following: first we describe the software and how it is organized with a brief overview of its functionality. Then we demonstrate its use with an example. The example simulates the spread of a directly transmitted infectious disease in Brazil through its transportation network. The velocity of spread of new diseases in a network of susceptible populations depends on their spatial distribution, size, susceptibility and patterns of contact. In a spatial scale, climate and environment may also impact the dynamics of geographical spread as it introduces temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Understanding and predicting the direction and velocity of an invasion wave is key for emergency preparedness.",

Epigrass users are not limited to basing their simulations on the built-in models. User-defined models can be developed in just a few lines of Python code.

The variables and the magnitudes associated with endemicity threshold depends on the natural history of the disease [18] . Theses magnitudes may vary from place to place as it depends on the contact structure of the individuals. Predicting which cities are sources for the endemicity and understanding the path of recurrent traveling waves may help us to design optimal surveillance and control strategies.",
