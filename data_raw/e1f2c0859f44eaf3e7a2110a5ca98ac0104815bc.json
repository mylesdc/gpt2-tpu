The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that vaccines save around 2-3 million lives a year [3] . Traditional vaccines are based on two main methodologies: live-attenuated and inactivated/killed pathogens [4] . Even though vaccines produced with these methods are immunologically effective, they still show some disadvantages, such as the need for a cold-chain, reduced shelf life and the time-consuming processes involved in the production and purification [5] [6] [7] . On the other hand, new methodologies have been used such as subunit and recombinant vaccines that weakly stimulate the immune system and their immunological effect is of short durability, so they require the use of adjuvant to potentiate their effect. Currently available adjuvants may lead to unwanted effects such as the generation of granulomas, allergies and neurotoxicity due to the different components used [5, 8, 9] . However, even with the evolution of vaccines, vaccination continues to represent a high cost mainly for developing countries, due to the fact that they have the highest number of people vulnerable to infectious diseases [10] [11] [12] . An effective, low cost technology to produce thermostable vaccines would represent a major advancement in the fight against infectious diseases worldwide, and may significantly reduce the risk of pandemics [13] .",

The strategy is based on the generation of crystal structures known as polyhedra, where the virus is occluded and protected from the environment for several years. Most interestingly, a single protein (known as polyhedrin) forms the polyhedra crystal during the infection of insect cells. Polyhedrin self-aggregates inside the nucleus and during aggregation viruses get occluded inside the crystal. Thus polyhedra is a natural preservative of proteins, whose function is to maintain the virus viable for many years at ambient temperature [24, 25] .",

A transfer plasmid containing the strong polyhedrin promoter drives the expression of the PH followed by a poly-linker [29] , which allows the insertion of any sequence to generate the fusion protein ( Fig. 1a) . In this particular case we introduced the sequence from the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to produce the fusion protein PH (1-110) GFP [28] . This plasmid was utilized to produce recombinant baculovirus expressing the fusion protein in Sf9 insect cells. Sf9 insect cells infected with our recombinant baculovirus carrying the gene to expressed the fusion protein PH GFP were sonicated to release the particles. Particles were centrifuged at low speed and the protein purified in this manner was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1b) . As control we utilized a pure soluble form of GFP. As illustrated in the figure, a simple centrifugation results in highly pure PH GFP protein, showing that the major component is the expected protein. Figure 1c illustrates an example of a Sf9 insect cells expressing PH GFP visualized by confocal microscopy (for a 3D reconstruction of the particles please refer to Additional file 1: Video S1). Notice that all particles were contained within the nucleus (labeled with DAPI in blue). Electron microscopy (transmission electron microscopy in panel D and scanning electron microscopy in E) shows that the PH (1-110) GFP particles are polydisperse, formed micro and nanoparticles. A capillary electroforesis analysis indicates that over 80% of the protein content is PH GFP (see the Additional file 2).",

The immunization protocol included 2 vaccinations a week apart (Fig. 4a ). Blood samples were taken in two-week intervals for 24 weeks to assay for antibodies against GFP used as model antigen (Fig. 4a) . GFP is poorly immunogenic and adjuvants are required in order to obtain antibodies when using soluble GFP as antigen. Most interestingly, ELISA assays show the generation of anti-GFP antibodies in all animals vaccinated with the PH (1-110) GFP particles obtained from the sucrose gradients shown in Fig. 3 . As indicated by the data, no significant differences in the antibody generation were observed with any of the particles obtained from the 40-60% sucrose gradients (Fig. 4b ). When the different particle sizes where compared with the combined mixture (particle mix), no statistically significant differences in antibody levels were observed. Thus, particle size does not appear to influence in the production of immunoglobulin IgG. Therefore, in the subsequent experiments we use the mixture of particles. The presence of anti-GFP antibodies was observed even after 24 weeks, indicating the induction of a long lasting immune response by the PH (1-110) GFP particles (Fig. 4c) . The antibody titers obtained with our PH (1-110) GFP particles were high (12,800 dilution) without the use of any adjuvant. Using the gold standard adjuvant aluminum hydroxide (Alum) resulted in higher antibody titers (51,200, Fig. 4d ). High antibody titers were maintained for at least 24 weeks postvaccination (see the Additional file 4). Most noticeable, when GFP was used in the absence of any adjuvant, no antibodies were produced ( Fig. 4c -d, green triangles). These results show that even though the use of adjuvant improves the immune response, the PH (1-110) GFP particles can induce a robust, long lasting immune response comparable to that obtained with the use of an adjuvant ( Fig. 4c-d) . Thus, our results indicate that particles have an adjuvant effect, since using free GFP (without the particles) requires adjuvant in order to induce a measurable immune response ( Fig. 4c-d) .",

Every month during a year an aliquot of PH GFP particles stored at the different conditions specified above were used to immunize mice. The immune response was evaluated during the entire year by ELISA analysis of anti-GFP antibodies present in the sera from immunized animals. As illustrated in Fig. 6 , storing the PH (1-110) GFP particles at 4\u00b0C impacted negatively its ability to generate antibodies after 6 months and more evidently after 1 year of storage. Most interestingly, keeping the PH GFP particles at room temperature as dry powder (R.T.D.) maintained the efficacy of the particles to induce a robust immune response ( Fig. 6a-d) . Similar results were obtained with PH GFP particles stored at \u2212 20\u00b0C and \u2212 70\u00b0C. These results indicate that storing the PH (1-110) GFP Fig. 4 The PH GFP particles induce immune response against GFP without the use of adjuvant. a Immunization scheme of mice in which two immunizations are included on day 0 and 15, the blood sample was taken for 24 weeks at 15-day intervals. b First evaluation of the immune response induced by PH (1-110) GFP particles of different sizes obtained in the sucrose gradients. In the immunized mice the production of IgG against GFP was measured by ELISA. All groups were compared with the particles mix group at week 10. c The antibody response against GFP was compared between particles mix of PH GFP with and without Alum and free GFP with and without Alum. d Serial 2-fold dilution of the sera of the mice to evaluate the antibody titers on week 4. The gray line indicates the cut-off. Error bars indicate the means \u00b1 SD (n = 5). *** p < 0.001, ns = not significant. (For panel B, two-way ANOVA with Dunnett post-tests and for panel C was used two-way ANOVA with Tukey post-tests) particles as dry powder is equivalent to storing the particles at \u2212 70\u00b0C, since its ability to induce a robust immune response is not compromised after a year of storage.",

Under the promoter of polyhedrin (polh), the genetic sequence of the first 330 bp of the N-terminal region of the polyhedrin was cloned and the genetic sequence of the GFP was ligated into its C-terminal in an open reading frame to generate a fusion protein called PH (1-110) GFP [28] . The polh promoter and the polyhedrin sequence were taken from Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus virus (AcMNPV). For the generation of the PH-WT-GFP chimeric polyhedra, the pFastbac\u2122 Dual expression vector (Thermo Fisher, USA, cat. No.10712024) was used, the WT polyhedrin was cloned under the p10 promoter and the PH (1-110) GFP under polh promoter. The baculoviruses were amplified, purified and titrated by following the recommendations and protocols provided by the supplier (Thermo Fisher, USA).",
