LY6E-mediated enhancement is dependent on cell type. a LY6E or empty/fluc control constructs were expressed by lentivirus transduction in human STAT1 -/fibroblasts, immortalized wildtype human fibroblasts (HuFibr), U2OS, A549, Huh7.5, HEK293T, and BHK-21J cell lines. Cells were infected with YFV-17D-Venus (between 0.3 and 1 MOI, 24h). Percent infection was quantified by flow cytometry and is shown normalized to control. n = 3 biological replicates. b THP-1 transduced with lentivirus expressing LY6E or fluc control were infected with IAV (A/WSN/33, 0.02 MOI, 8h). Cells were permeabilized and stained for NP.

LY6E ortholog molecular phylogenetic analysis LY6E sequences from nineteen species were aligned using MUSCLE 5 as implemented in MEGA7 6 . The alignment was manually curated to ensure preservation of coding sequences. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed by the HKY85 substitution model. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-2703.7050) is shown.

            "text": "fibroblasts was isolated as described above and submitted to the UTSW McDermott Center Sequencing Core.Samples were run on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer to determine level of degradation thus ensuring only high-quality RNA is used (RIN Score 8 or higher). The Qubit fluorimeter was used to determine the concentration prior to staring library prep. Four micrograms of total DNAse-treated RNA were then prepared with the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep Kit from Illumina. Poly-A RNA was purified and fragmented before strand specific cDNA synthesis. cDNA were then a-tailed and indexed adapters were ligated. After adapter ligation, samples were PCR amplified and purified with AmpureXP beads, then validated again on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Before being normalized and pooled, samples were quantified by Qubit then run on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 using SBS v3 reagents. Samples were subject to single-end, 50 bp read length whole transcriptome sequencing with 35 x 10 6 read coverage. The McDermott Center Bioinformatics Core used edgeR for differential expression and statistical analysis. Only genes that exceeded a logCPM of 1 were included for further statistical analysis using GraphPad Prism.",
