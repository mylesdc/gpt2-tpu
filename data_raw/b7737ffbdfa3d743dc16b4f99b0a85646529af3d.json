Imported cases could only infect others, as we assume 87 their infection was acquired outside of the country.

Six cases imported 102 to El Salvador were P. falciparum, however, the remainder of cases were P. vivax. The serial interval 103 distribution of treated, symptomatic P. falciparum malaria, previously characterised using empirical 104 and model-based evidence 13 was adapted to inform the prior distribution for the relationship 105 between time and likelihood of transmission between cases in El Salvador. As a result the prior 106 distribution was altered to better reflect the biology of P. vivax and the dominant vector species in El 107 Salvador, Anopheles albimanus, but was sufficiently uninformative to allow for possible variation in transmission dynamics. In addition, there is a possibility of a small number of asymptomatic or 109 undetected and therefore untreated infections contributing to ongoing transmission, which will take 110 on a longer serial interval. By defining a prior for the shape parameter of a serial interval distribution 111 we can account for some of this uncertainty. 112",

However, methods based on Wallinga and Teunis make the 145 strong simplifying assumption that the likelihoods of all spanning trees on and therefore are 146 constant. Thus they fundamentally infer the most probable underlying network structure or jointly 147 consider all infection times at once. In contrast, by following the approach introduced by Gomez-148 Rodriguez and Sh\u00f6lkopf 17 , we solve the optimisation problem = max | |\u2264 ( | ) for a set of at most 149 edges, or transmission events linking cases. The two fundamental challenges with solving this 150 optimisation problem are (a) the sum \u2211 (\u22c5) \u2208 ( ) is evaluated over all directed spanning trees in , 151 which can be super-exponential in , and (b) max | |\u2264 ( | ) is a special case of the maximum coverage 152problem which has been proven to be NP-hard 18 and therefore unsolvable without searching a combinatorial graph space with brute force. Following previous approaches 17,19  , challenge (a) can be 154 solved by observing that the resulting matrix ( | ; , ) for all ( , ) \u2208 \u2130 pairs is an upper 155 triangular connectivity matrix. From Tutte and Gomez and Sh\u00f6lkopf 10 the connectivity matrix can be 156 expressed as a determinant, which for an upper triangular matrix is the product of the diagonal 157 elements. Therefore the likelihood in equation (1) becomes tractable and can be evaluated (b) it can be proved 17 that, while finding an optimum to solve max | |\u2264 ( | ) is NP-hard, 162",

As it currently stands our formulation 180 uses a proportional likelihood optimised by exploiting submodularity. However equivalent 181 frameworks exist 21 with explicit likelihoods derived from a survival view point of a temporal point 182 process. These methods can be used within a full Bayesian hierarchical model. 183Accounting for missing cases 184 Assuming all cases reaching community health workers or health facilities are recorded, missing cases 185 may be generated by two processes. Symptomatic cases may be missed by not seeking care or being 186 found through active case detection. On the other hand, cases may be asymptomatic and therefore 187 unlikely to seek care or be detected. They may have densities of parasites in their blood which are too 188 low to be detectable by microscopy if active case detection occurs. These reasons for missed detection 189 apply to both imported cases and locally acquired cases. We assume the pool of asymptomatic cases 190 in the country is low and has a small contribution to ongoing transmission. To explore the amount of 191 cases which may be going undetected within our independent cascade framework, we consider 192 additional edges , that represent unobserved individuals who can infect any observed individual, , 193 in a transmission chain. Every observed individual can get infected by unobserved individuals, , with 194 an arbitrarily small probability \u03b5. This so called -edge is connected to every node in our network and 195 do not, by design, participate in the diffusion propagation. The -edges prevents breaks in the network 196 diffusion cascade where the likelihood of transmission between observed cases is sufficiently low, the 197 case is linked to an external source. Additionally -edges ensure the likelihood is monotonic, that is, 198 converting an -edge to a network edge in only increases the likelihood. The addition of -edges 199 was achieved by augmenting our pairwise transmission likelihood as follows:The specific value of \u03b5 was set at 1e-5 to balance between false positives and false negatives when 202 linking cases by infection events. The higher the value of \u03b5, the larger the number of nodes that are 203 assumed to be infected by an external source. 204Estimating c (t) Covariate assembly 225 The environmental covariates (i.e., independent variables) used in the spatial mapping of c >1 risk 226 consisted of raster layers that spanned El Salvador 2.5 arc-minute (~5 km x 5 km) spatial resolution. 227Covariate choice was based on key variables used within past malaria mapping endeavours 22 . Raster 228 datasets were then acquired or produced, and wherever possible dynamic versions (i.e., temporally 229 varying products) were utilized to support the temporal aspect of the analysis. The majority of the 230 raster covariates were derived from high temporal resolution satellite images and then aggregated 231 to create dynamic covariates for every month throughout the study period (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) The underlying spatial statistical model was fitted to binomial data of > 1 = 1; < 1 = 0, 237 using the logit link function: 238 where >1, are the number binary data points for > 1 = 1; < 1 = 0, is the estimated >1 , 245 expressed as a logit transformed probability and modelled as a Gaussian process with and 246 precision Q. The GP mean is a linear function of a global intercept and space-time indexed 247 covariate values . Q is a sparse precision matrix constructed from a spatial process . 248 is the sparse finite element solution to the stochastic partial differential equation ( 2 \u2212 \u0394) 2 ( ( )) = 249 ( ), where \u0394 is the Laplacian, is the spatial scale/range parameter, controls the variance, is 250 the spatial smoothness parameter (fixed at = 2), and ( ) is the spatial white noise process. To 251 account for the curvature of the earth the distance metric s is defined on a spherical manifold in 252Cartesian \u211d 3 . A sensitivity analysis showed our analysis was robust to prior specifications. 253",
