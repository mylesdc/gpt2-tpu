            "text": "Knowledge of protein-protein interactions and their binding sites is indispensable for in-depth understanding of the networks in living cells. With the avalanche of protein sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is critical to develop computational methods for identifying in a timely fashion the protein-protein binding sites (PPBSs) based on the sequence information alone because the information obtained by this way can be used for both biomedical research and drug development. To address such a challenge, we have proposed a new predictor, called iPPBS-Opt, in which we have used: (1) the K-Nearest Neighbors Cleaning (KNNC) and Inserting Hypothetical Training Samples (IHTS) treatments to optimize the training dataset; (2) the ensemble voting approach to select the most relevant features; and (3) the stationary wavelet transform to formulate the statistical samples. Cross-validation tests by targeting the experiment-confirmed results have demonstrated that the new predictor is very promising, implying that the aforementioned practices are indeed very effective. Particularly, the approach of using the wavelets to express protein/peptide sequences might be the key in grasping the problem's essence, fully consistent with the findings that many important biological functions of proteins can be elucidated with their low-frequency internal motions. To maximize the convenience of most experimental scientists, we have provided a step-by-step guide on how to use the predictor's web server (http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iPPBS-Opt) to get the desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations involved.",

Actually, these kinds of interactions affect the biological processes in a living cell. To really understand protein-protein interactions, however, it is indispensable to acquire the information of protein-protein binding site (PPBS). Despite many studies on the binding site of a protein or DNA with its ligand (small molecule) have been made [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , relatively much less studies have been conducted on PPBS, particularly based on the sequence information alone. It is both time-consuming and expensive to determine PPBS purely based on biochemical experiments. Facing the enormous number of protein sequences generated in the postgenomic era, it is highly desired to develop computational methods to identify PPBSs for uncharacterized proteins so that they can be timely used for both basic research and drug development, such as conducting mutagenesis studies [9] and prioritize drug targets.",

In detection stage, a support vector machines (SVM) classifier is used to get the target quickly. Due to the two layers structure, the algorithm computational complexity becomes the prime concern.

Based on the above knowledge, we propose a framework consisting of two stages inspired by HVS as follows (See Figure 1) .

Due to the two layers structure, the algorithm computational complexity becomes the prime concern For the simplicity and high processing speed, saliency detection methods in the frequency domain are 0\u02d8, if its center is a PPBS P\u03be` clutters. In recent years, a series of simple and fast algorithm based on fourier transform was proposed such as spectral residual(SR) [5] , phase spectrum of fourier transform(PFT) [6] , hypercomplex fourie transform(HFT) [7] . With regards to small target detection, frequency domain method is quite differen from other methods. It transforms the airspace information to the frequency domain, defines significan target and tests in the frequency domain. While, spectral residual (SR) approach does not rely on the parameters. It calculates the difference between the original signal and a smooth one in the log amplitude spectrum, and then makes up a saliency map by transforming SR to spatial domain. PFT approach detects small targets from the reconstruction that is calculated only by the phase spectrum of the input signal It omits the computation of SR in the amplitude spectrum, which saves about 1/3 computational cost HFT approach explains the intrinsic theory of saliency detector in the frequency domain and use spectra filter to suppress repeated patterns.R Although numerous methods have been proposed, many of them may fail in certain circumstances e.g., ground-sky background [8] , which is common in the helicopter view. In this situation, targets are easily mixed up with the background clutters in size and easily overlapped by vegetation, roads, rivers bridges [9] , resulting a huge false rate in traditional algorithm.",

Ever since it was introduced in 2001 [36] , the concept of PseAAC has been penetrating into nearly all the areas of computational biology (see, e.g., [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] as well as a long list of references cited in [48, 57] and a recent review [58] ). It has also been selected as a special topic for a special issue on \"drug development and biomedicine\" [59] . Recently, the concept of PseAAC was further extended to represent the feature vectors of DNA and nucleotides [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] . Because of its being widely and increasingly used, three types of open access soft-ware, called \"PseAAC-Builder\" [65] , \"propy\" [50] , and \"PseAAC-General\" [57] , were established: the former two are for generating various modes of Chou's special PseAAC; while the 3rd one for those of Chou's general PseAAC.",

Therefore, for each working segment, we can get a feature vector that contains \u2126 \" 5\u02c64 \" 20 components by using each of the seven physicochemical properties of Equation (11) . In other words, we have seven different modes of PseAAC as given below:",

Although this might reflect the real world in which the non-binding sites are always the majority compared with the binding ones, a predictor trained by such a highly skewed benchmark dataset would inevitably have the bias consequence that many binding sites might be mispredicted as non-binding ones [88] . Actually, what is really the most intriguing information for us is the information about the binding sites. Therefore, it is important to find an effective approach to optimize the unbalanced training dataset and minimize this kind of bias consequence. To realize this, we took the following procedures.",

Three cross-validation methods are often used to derive metrics values in statistical prediction: the independent dataset test, subsampling (or K-fold cross-validation) test, and jackknife test [109] . Of the three the jackknife test is deemed the least arbitrary as it can always yield a unique outcome for a given benchmark dataset, as elucidated in [12] and demonstrated by Equations (28)-(32) therein. Accordingly, the jackknife test has been widely recognized and increasingly used by investigators to examine the quality of various predictors (see, e.g., [46, 53, 54, [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] .

This is because a dataset, after optimized by the KNNC and ITHTS treatments, may miss many experimental negative samples and contain some hypothetical positive samples. It would be fine to use such a dataset to train a predictor, but not for validation. Since the validation should be conducted based on all the experimental data in the benchmark dataset but not on the added hypothetical samples nor only on the data in the reduced negative subset, a special cross-validation, the so-called target cross-validation, has been introduced here. During the target cross-validation process for the positive samples, only the experiment-confirmed samples are singled out as the targets (or test samples) for validation; but during the target cross-validation process for the negative samples, even all the excluded experimental data are taken into account.

The reasons are as follows: First, the KNNC and IHTS treatments have been introduced to optimize the training datasets, so as to avoid many misprediction events caused by the highly imbalanced training datasets used in previous studies. Second, the ensemble technique has been utilized in this study to select the most relevant one from seven classes of different physicochemical properties. Third, the wavelets transform technique has been applied to extract some important key features, which are deeply hidden in complicated protein sequences. This is just like the studies in dealing with the extremely complicated internal motions of proteins, it is the key to grasp the low-frequency collective motion [74, 75] for in-depth understanding or revealing the dynamic mechanisms of their various important biological functions [84] , such as cooperative effects [78] , allosteric transition [80, 81] , assembly of microtubules [83] , and switch between active and inactive states [76] . Fourth, the PseAAC approach has been introduced to formulate the statistical samples, which has been proved very useful not only in dealing with protein/peptide sequences, but also in dealing with DNA/RNA sequences, as elaborated in a recent review paper [124] .",

            "text": "It is a very effective approach to optimize the training dataset via the KNNC treatment and IHTS treatment to enhance the prediction quality in identifying the protein-protein binding sites. This is because the training datasets constructed in this area without undergoing such an optimization procedure are usually extremely skewed and unbalanced, with the negative subset being overwhelmingly larger than the positive one. It is anticipated that the iPPBS-Opt web server presented in this paper will become a very useful high throughput tool for identifying protein-protein binding sites, or at the very least, a complementary tool to the existing prediction methods in this area.
