Forty-six patients with OSCC were analyzed for expression of TAMs in biopsy samples by immunohistochemistry. We examined TAM subsets and their production of immune suppressive molecules (IL-10 and PD-L1) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from three OSCC patients by flow cytometry. CD163 was detected around the tumor or connective tissue, while CD204 was detected in/around the tumors. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that CD163 + CD204 + TAMs strongly produced IL-10 and PD-L1 in comparison with CD163 + CD204 \u2212 and CD163 \u2212 CD204 + TAMs. Furthermore, the number of activated CD3 + T cells after co-culture with CD163 + CD204 + TAMs was significantly lower than that after co-culture with other TAM subsets. In clinical findings, the number of CD163 + CD204 + TAMs was negatively correlated with that of CD25 + cells and 5-year progression-free survival. These results suggest that CD163 + CD204 + TAMs possibly play a key role in the invasion and metastasis of OSCC by T-cell regulation via IL-10 and PD-L1 production.",

The heterogeneity of macrophages has been discussed with regard to different responses to various microenvironmental stimuli. Macrophages are classified into two distinct subtypes: the classically activated (M1) macrophage stimulated by microbial products and interferon-\u03b3, and the alternatively activated (M2) macrophage stimulated by IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10 1-4 . Several studies have shown that M2 macrophages infiltrating into the tumor microenvironment contribute to cancer progression and are associated with tumor progression, angiogenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression. This macrophage phenotype is referred to as the tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) 5-7 .",

In 1970's, many researchers thought that activated macrophages were important effector cells in cytotoxic killing of tumor cells 17 . Macrophages are classified into two major subsets: classically activated (M1) macrophages stimulated by Th1-type responses and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages stimulated by Th2-type responses 6, 7 . M1 macrophages secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and contribute to microbicidal and tumoricidal immunity, whereas M2 macrophages scavenge debris and contribute to angiogenesis, suppression of adaptive immunity, wound healing and fibrosis by producing IL-10 and CCL18. The population of 7-AAD + CD3 + T cells co-cultured with TAM subsets from a representative OSCC patient. The number of 7-AAD + CD3 + T cells co-cultured with TAM subsets was analyzed using flow cytometry (n = 3 for each subset).

Emerging evidence also implicates CD204 as a suppressor in the inflammatory response 30, 31 . Furthermore, in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, CD204 was demonstrated as a better marker for the TAM populations associating with tumor progression compared with CD163 32 .

Moreover, there is a positive correlation between number of IL-10 and PD-L1. IL-10 leads to the phosphorylation of STAT3 and then IL-10/STAT3 signaling induces PD-L1 overexpression 33 . We previously reported that phosphorylated-STAT3 expression was localized in the nucleus of the cancer cells and scattered widely in the cancer nests from patients with OSCC at advanced clinical stage 34 . In addition, CD163 + CD204 + TAMs were also found to activate the function of T cell regulation and apoptosis.
