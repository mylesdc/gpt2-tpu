A total of 4.0 \u03bcg of recombinant plasmid of pIR-DHAV-1 and in vitro transcribed product of 4.0 \u03bcg of RNA-launched infectious clone named pR-DHAV-1 were transfected into BHK-21 cells to analyze the rescue efficiency.

The qRT-PCR and western blotting results indicated that rDHAV-1 shared similar growth characteristics with pDHAV-1. Furthermore, DNA-launched infectious system possessed much higher rescue efficiency assay compared to RNA-launched infectious system. The mutation at position 3042 from T to C has no impact on viral replication and tissue tropism. From 1 h post infection (hpi) to 48 hpi, the viral RNA copies of rDHAV-1 in liver were the highest among the six tested tissues (with an exception of thymus at 6 hpi), while the viral RNA copy numbers in heart and kidney were alternately the lowest. Conclusion: We have constructed a genetically stable and highly pathogenic DNA-launched infectious clone, from which the rescued virus could be harvested by direct transfection with recombinant plasmids. rDHAV-1 shared similar growth characteristics and tissue tropism with pDHAV-1. The DNA-launched infectious system of DHAV-1 possessed higher rescue efficiency compared to the traditional RNA-launched infectious system.",

Up to date, there are at least four types of viral RNA rescued system, including RNA-launched system [18] , helper virus-launched system [19] and two DNAlaunched systems based on cellular RNA polymerases I and II [20] [21] [22] . Although the infectious DHAV genomic RNA could be harvested in vitro from a full-length DHAV cDNA clone by the RNA-launched reverse genetics system [23, 24] , the operative strategy still depends on in vitro transcription. Compared to the RNAlaunched infectious clone, the RNA polymerases IIbased DNA-launched infectious system is able to generate homogenous RNA transcripts from transfected cDNA clone in vivo, allowing for higher rescue efficiency with less cost and labor by skipping in vitro RNA transcription [25] [26] [27] . For porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), by the introduction of ribozyme elements at both termini of the viral genomic cDNA, an improved DNA-launched infectious clone improved the rescue efficacy with approximately 10-50-fold higher than the in vitro-transcribed RNAbased system [28] . The hammerhead ribozyme is a catalytic motif responsible for the self-cleaving activity of RNA virusoids [29] , while the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme also contains site-specific self-cleavage with the existence of divalent cations and a cytidine nucleotide [30] . After transcription, the ribozymes at both termini of DNA-launched infectious clones could lead into the selfcutting and releasing of the viral mRNA under the condition of existing Mg 2+ or other divalent ions and a cytidine nucleotide. By this way, the viral RNA can be harvested by direct transfection with the recombinant plasmid without in vitro transcription [31] .",

At 48 hpt, approximately 3-5% of the BHK-21 cells transfected with the pR-DHAV-1 RNA transcripts presented specific green fluorescence, whereas a much higher percentage of FITC-positive cells, approximately 50-60%, were observed when transfected with the pIR-DHAV-1 plasmid DNA (Fig. 6A) . Furthermore, we investigated expression levels of viral capsid proteins by western blotting assay. Obviously, the viral capsid protein concentration derived from pIR-DHAV-1 group was much higher than the pR-DHAV-1 group (Fig. 6B) , indicating that the DNAlaunched infectious system provided more sufficient viral capsid proteins for packaging infectious virions comparing to the RNA-launched system.

The results showed that the virus RNA copy number in pIR-DHAV-1 group was constantly higher compared to the pR-DHAV-1 group from generation 1 to generation 4 (Fig. 6C) , which demonstrated the higher rescue efficiency of the DNAlaunched infectious system than the RNA-launched infectious system.",

Although the previous research has reported about the establishment of the RNA-launched infectious clone of DHAV-1 [23] and DHAV-3 [24] , the in vitro transcription will raise the operation difficulty and experiment cost. The DNA-launched infectious system possessed selfcleaving ribozyme elements at both termini of the viral genomic cDNA, which was expected to retain the authentic terminal nucleotide sequences of the viral genome [28] . The 3\u2032 product of the HDV ribozyme was shown to serve as the substrate for polyadenylation [34] . Here, we established an improved DNA-launched infectious system based on the DHAV-1 LY0801 strain. The viral genome of DHAV-1 was placed under the control of a CMV promoter, allowing the conventional plasmid DNA transfection and generation of homogenous RNA transcripts in vivo by the cellular RNA polymerase II, which could reduce labor and experimental infectious clone were transfected into BHK-21 cells to analyze rescue efficiency between DNAlaunched system and RNA-launched system. Cell culture was collected at 48 hpt and run on SDS 12%-polyacrylamide gels. Anti-DHAV-1 monoclonal antibody 4F8 (dilution of 1:500) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (dilution of 1:3000) were used to conduct the western blot assay. BHK-21 cells that transfected with pIR vector were conducted as negative control. (c) BHK-21 cells were infected with transfected product of 4.0 \u03bcg of the DNA-launched infectious clones or in vitro transcribed product of the same amount of RNA-launched infectious clones, cell lysates were collected at 48 hpi, and were immediately used for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR measurement. Viral RNA copies were calculated with formula X = 6.7 \u00d7 10(40.812y)/3.285. \"X\" is a standard of viral copies while \"y\" is a standard of values derived from one step real-time PCR. Bars represent means and standard of three individual repeats. \"***\" represents p < 0.001 cost. Compared to the RNA-launched infectious system, the DNA-launched infectious system of DHAV-1 improved the viral rescue efficiency approximately 10 to 20 folds (Fig. 6) .",

Meanwhile, a similar pattern also occurred in the survival curves of the ducklings inoculated with the rDHAV-1 or pDHAV-1 (Fig. 7A) . In order to distinguish the rescued virus from parental virus, the genetic marker was engineered into pIR-DHAV-1. The virus copy number peaked at 48 and 60 hpi in supernatants and BHK-21 cells, respectively. The virus copy number was subsequently followed by a decline, which was consistent with the observation of parental group. Western blot results also confirmed the similar growth characteristics between the rescued virus and parental virus (Fig. 5) . The survival curve comparison between the rDHAV-1 and pDHAV-1 also showed almost identical infectivity characteristics. To sum up, the rescued recombinant virus was capable of infecting susceptible host cells and exhibited almost identical replication and infectivity efficiency as 5th passage of LY0801 strain. Based on that, we then investigated viral replication features of rDHAV-1 in young ducklings. In the previous study, the viral RNA could be detected in all the different tissues (heart, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus and BF) of the duckling inoculated with the rDHAV-1, which was consistent with the naturally infected ducks by DHAV-1 [33] . In our experiment, the viral RNA of rDHAV-1 was firstly detected in liver with viral load of 10 3.0 \u00b1 0.0 copies/g at 1 hpi, whereas the rDHAV-1 was detected in the other five tissues at 2 hpi or 6 hpi (Table 2) , which showed that liver might (1) Fragments were amplified with the template RNAs of the parental virus group and then digested with BamH I; (2) Fragments were amplified with the template RNAs of the rescued virus group and then digested with BamH I. Nucleotide sequence alignment (c) and amino acid sequence alignment (d) were also conducted by the Clustal W method (DNA Star LaserGene software, DNAStar Inc. Madison, WI) to investigate genetic marker in both groups be the most sensitive tissue during the early infection of DHAV-1 via subcutaneously. With an exception of thymus at 6 hpi, the liver tissue exhibited the highest viral load in the six selected tissues from 1hpi to 48 hpi, which could partly explain the severe liver damage induced by the infection of DHAV-1.",

The BamH I restriction enzyme site was introduced into the recombinant plasmid to create a genetic marker to distinguish the rescued virus from the parental virus (without BamH I enzyme site). Two 2290 bp-fragments derived from parental and rescued virus with primers DHAV-3F and DHAV-4R were digested with BamH I and analyzed on a 2.0% agarose gel. (M) DNA Marker DL2000; 1.
