            "text": "Introduction Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium and opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the nasal cavities of \ufffd30% of the population, increasing the risk of pathogenic infection, especially in the clinical setting [1] . Almost 120,000 cases of S. aureus blood stream infections occurred in the United States in 2017, with 20,000 associated deaths [2] . S. aureus resistant to methicillin (MRSA) and other antibiotics have become a major public health concern. Most resistance and virulence factors in S. aureus are encoded on mobile genetic elements (MGEs), including bacteriophages (phages) and genomic islands [3, 4] . Given the rarity of genetic conjugation loci and restriction against transformation, transduction via bacteriophages is considered the main mode of horizontal gene transfer of MGEs in S. aureus [5] . Some staphylococcal bacteriophages carry virulence factor genes in their genomes. Many phages are also capable of transferring unrelated genetic material through generalized transduction. Furthermore, certain \"helper\" phages are involved in highly specific, high frequency mobilization of S. aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs) and similar genetic elements [6, 7] . The underlying mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer and the ability of a particular phage to transfer genetic material to a new host are therefore central to genetic diversification and the emergence of novel pathogenic strains in S. aureus.",

            "text": "Bacteriophages of many Firmicutes, including S. aureus, interact with wall teichoic acid (WTA), a variable carbohydrate polymer present on the surface of most Gram-positive cells [8] . Most strains of S. aureus have a unique type of WTA that is distinct from that of other (coagulase-negative) staphylococci (CoNS) and generally blocks infection by CoNS-specific phages [9] . A key determinant of host specificity is provided by the phage tail tip complex (TTC) or more elaborate baseplate, specialized structures at the tips of phage tails that are usually the first point of contact between the phage and its host [10, 11] . Enzymatic activities associated with TTCs and baseplates degrade the cell wall, ultimately leading to penetration of the plasma membrane and ejection of the encapsidated DNA into the cell. Tailed, double-stranded DNA phages (order Caudovirales) are divided into three families based on the structures of their tails: long and flexuous (Siphoviridae); long and contractile (Myoviridae); or short (Podoviridae) [12] . TTCs and baseplates from these diverse groups vary greatly in complexity, but tend to share a common set of structural modules, combined with a variable set of host interaction proteins, including tail fibers and receptor binding proteins. The best-described bacteriophage baseplate structures are those of the lactococcal siphoviruses TP901-1, Tuc2009, and p2, and the Escherichia coli myovirus T4, for which various structures have been produced [11, 13] . In contrast, little structural information is available for baseplates from staphylococcal bacteriophages.",

The tail and baseplate gene cluster in 80\u03b1 includes open reading frames (ORFs) 53-68, which are part of the large late operon (ORFs 40-73) that encodes all structural proteins, the terminase proteins involved in DNA packaging, and the lysis proteins ( Fig 1A and 1B) . Here, we have determined the cryo-EM structure of the 80\u03b1 baseplate at 3.75 \u00c5 resolution, allowing most of the baseplate proteins and part of the tail to be modeled in atomic detail. This is the first high-resolution structure of a baseplate from a staphylococcal siphovirus and of a siphovirus tail. The 80\u03b1 baseplate structure has several unique features, including the presence of three tail fiber/receptor binding proteins, but also displays striking similarities to other phage baseplates, indicating a mix-and-match strategy for baseplate evolution across the phages of the Firmicutes. Our structure contributes to a broader understanding of the diversity of the cell recognition and penetration machinery of siphoviruses infecting Gram-positive bacteria and how these structures access the cell interior and trigger DNA ejection during infection.",

Initial cryo-EM datasets of up to \ufffd7,000 baseplate particle images were collected with a Philips CM20 microscope on SO-163 film or using an FEI Titan Krios microscope equipped with a Direct Electron DE-20 detector, and reconstructed with sixfold (C6) symmetry to 9.3 \u00c5 resolution (FSC 0.5 ) using EMAN and EMAN2 [17] . A larger dataset was subsequently collected with the Titan Krios and DE-20 detector, and processed with MotionCor2, Gctf and RELION-2 [18] , yielding a final C6 reconstruction at 3.75 \u00c5 resolution (FSC 0.143 ) from 74,294 particle images (Fig 1D-1F , S1 and S2 Figs). A reconstruction of the same data with application of only threefold (C3) symmetry was generated with RELION-3 [19] and reached 4.07 \u00c5 resolution (Fig 1G, S1 and S2 Figs) . The baseplate is 298 \u00c5 wide and 271 \u00c5 tall and consists of six peripheral structures surrounding a core that represents a continuation of the tail (Fig 2A and 2B ). The tail itself is 86 \u00c5 wide and consists of \ufffd39 hexameric rings with an inter-ring spacing of 41 \u00c5, enclosing a 42 \u00c5 wide lumen (Fig 2B) . Three of the tail rings are embedded within the baseplate itself. The peripheral structures consist of two large rings surrounding the embedded part of the tail, and six trefoiled, club-shaped features, about 85 \u00c5 wide and 124 \u00c5 long, connected to the baseplate core via six kinked stems. At lower cutoff level, six fibers can be seen to extend from the lower ring and wrap around the outside of the baseplate, terminating in globular densities near the baseplate tip (Fig 2C) . At least seven tail rings can be discerned, and a rod-like protrusion extends from the tip of the baseplate. Additional, noisy densities, disconnected from the rest of the baseplate, appear below this protruding rod. 2D class averages that represent end-on views of the baseplate (Fig 1E) suggested the presence of six thin fibers spread out radially in the plane of the ice, but these features were not observed in the 3D reconstruction.",

Other ORFs could be assigned by comparison with the closely related phage \u03d511 [21] , for which HHpred analysis [22] had identified homologs in the PDB structure database. These ORFs include the distal tail protein (Dit, gp58), which comprises the baseplate \"hub\", the tail-associated lysin (Tal, gp59), comprising the tip of the tail, and the receptor binding protein (RBP, gp61) (Fig 1A and 1B ; Table 1 ). The N-terminal part of \u03d511 gp54, corresponding to 80\u03b1 gp62, was shown to have some similarity with upper baseplate protein (BppU) of lactococcal phage TP901-1 [21, 23] . The crystal structure of \u03d511 RBP (gp45), which is 97% identical to the 80\u03b1 RBP, was recently determined [24] . Crystal structures have also been determined for Bacillus phage SPP1 Dit [25] and the baseplates of lactococcal phages p2 and TP901-1, which include Dit, Tal, BppU, and receptor binding proteins that are not similar to the \u03d511 RBP [23, 26] .",

Most importantly, gp62 was identified as a tail fiber (FibL) with coiled-coil structure, while gp68 was predicted as a collagen-like fiber protein (FibU). gp67 encodes a predicted cell wall hydrolase (Hyd) that is 97% identical to \u03d511 gp49, which was previously shown to exhibit muralytic activity [27] .

In addition, the tail tube fold has been identified in various baseplate proteins, tail terminator proteins, and the T4 capsid assembly protease, reflecting their evolutionary relationship [32] . HHpred analysis of 80\u03b1 gp53 yielded >98% probability matches to major tail proteins of several siphoviruses, including SPP1 gp17.1 and \u03bb gpV [33, 34] , and lower probability matches to two T6SS tube-forming proteins ( Table 2 ). Six copies of MTP were built into each of the two most well defined tail rings closest to the baseplate. Of the 193 residues of MTP, residues 4-169 were modeled in the lower ring (denoted MTP L ) and 4-150 into the upper ring (MTP U ) (Figs 2E and 3A). Each MTP subunit includes two four-stranded \u03b2-sheets folded into a \u03b2-sandwich and flanked by an \u03b1-helix ( Fig  3A) . In a complete tail ring, one of these \u03b2-sheets forms a 24-stranded, highly negatively charged \u03b2-barrel-42 \u00c5 in diameter-lining the tail lumen, presumably providing a slippery tube for the DNA during infection (Figs 2B and 3B ). This luminal \u03b2-sheet contains an extended insertion loop between \u03b22 and \u03b23 (the \"stacking loop\") that reaches across the \ufffd3 \u00c5 space that separates tail rings and inserts into a pocket between two subunits in the adjacent ring ( Fig 3A) . The equivalent loop in the major tail proteins of phages \u03bb, T5 and SPP1 was shown to play an essential role in tail polymerization [33] [34] [35] .",

Due to the quasi-sixfold nature of the Tal trimer, it matched quite well overall, but much of the density was blurred due to the superposition of non-identical Tal orientations. To obtain a reconstruction with only threefold symmetry imposed, we first subtracted all density not associated with Tal from the baseplate images. These signal-subtracted images were then subjected to symmetry expansion and 3D classification to group together consistently oriented Tal trimers within the larger C3 asymmetric unit. These orientations were used to generate a reconstruction of the whole baseplate with C3 symmetry, which reached a resolution of 4.07 \u00c5 ( Fig  1G, S1 and S2 Figs) . In this reconstruction, the density corresponding to the cap and the rod was well resolved (Fig 4A-4C ) and allowed modeling of residues 2-388 of Tal (Fig 4D and 4E) .

The two domains merge into a continuous 8-stranded \u03b2 sheet on one side (Fig 4E) . The two domains are separated by an insertion (Ins1) with a fold related to the type 3 secretion system protein EscC (PDB ID: 3GR5). The second tail tube domain has an additional domain (Ins2) inserted in a position that is topologically equivalent to the \u03b22-\u03b23 stacking loop in MTP (Fig 4E) . Residues 335-348 form an \u03b1-helix that extends into the tail lumen. In the Tal trimer, these helices form a twisted tripod that occludes the opening of the lumen (Fig 4D and 4F) . Residues 362-389 from the three subunits make up an \u03b1-helical coiled coil that forms the rod and extends to the unresolved CTD (Fig 4D and 4F ). The Tal fold is similar to proteins from systems as distant as E. coli phage Mu, Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e prophage A118 and an E. coli T6SS, with RMSDs ranging from 2.6 \u00c5 to 3.3 \u00c5 between equivalent C\u03b1 atoms (S4G-S4I Fig and S1 Table) .",

Gp45 was previously identified as the primary receptor binding protein for \u03d511, with binding affinity for WTA, and was thus denoted RBP [21] . RBP is a trimeric protein consisting of four domains: an N-terminal \u03b1-helical coiled-coil \"stem\" domain (residues 1-142) that is folded by 155\u02daat a central hinge; a fivebladed \u03b2-propeller \"platform\" domain (residues 143-442) that was previously suggested to bind to the GlcNAc residues of WTA on the host cell surface [21, 24] ; and two highly similar C-terminal \"tower\" domains (residues 443-636; S1 Table) , each consisting of a bent \u03b2-sheet superposed by an \u03b1-helix (Fig 5A) . Six such trimers surround the baseplate core, making up the bulk of the observed peripheral structures (Fig 2D) . As expected, the 80\u03b1 RBP is very similar to \u03d511 gp45 [24] (Fig 5B, S4J Fig; S1 Table) . The greatest difference between the 80\u03b1 and \u03d511 RBPs is in the orientation of the stem domains relative to the platform and tower domains ( Fig 5B) . As noted above, the N-termini of the coiled-coil domains from each RBP trimer connect to the RBP binding loop of Dit (Fig 3D and 3E) . The RBP hinge interacts with a ring formed by the FibL trimers (Figs 2D and 5D, see below) . Deletion of ORF61 led to a complete loss of peripheral structures and of infectivity, although tails still assembled normally (S5 Fig). The structure of RBP is remarkably similar to the \"tail fiber\" (gp17) of the distantly related staphylococcal podovirus P68 [37] (Fig 5C, S1 Table) , presumably reflecting specificity for S. aureus surface structures. However, in P68 gp17, the stem domain is less bent at the hinge compared to 80\u03b1 (66\u02davs. 155\u02da) (Fig 5C) . In addition, since P68 lacks a Dit equivalent, the gp17 stem domain is instead attached to the dodecameric portal protein. Consequently, P68 has twelve gp17 trimers, compared to the six RBP trimers in 80\u03b1.",

However, the bottom of the Iglike fold of FibL associates closely with the hinge domain of the RBP stem region (Fig 5D and  5E ). This is consistent with the observation that deletion of the gene encoding FibL (ORF62) led to a complete loss of peripheral structures, including RBP (S5 Fig), suggesting that the interaction between FibL and RBP is co-stabilizing.

A new reconstruction was made from modified images created by subtracting the density (Fig 5G) . This reconstruction reached 5.0 \u00c5 resolution (S1 and S2 Figs). In this map, FibL could be seen as an elongated structure with a globular \"knee\", extending beyond the tips of the RBP trimers, terminating in two additional globular densities. While this map was not fully interpretable in terms of the atomic structure of the proteins, models for the remaining domains of FibL based on the HHpred predictions were rigid body fitted into the density and connected to provide a complete pseudo-atomic model for FibL (Figs 2F and 5H ). In this model, the three coiled-coil \u03b1-helices continue with no twist between residues 180-238. This is followed by an RBP-like tower domain that was fitted into the knee in the middle of the fiber, followed by another, shorter coiled-coil region.

Based on its predicted collagen-like domain and similarity to FibL, FibU was expected to form trimers. However, there was only density for twelve copies of FibU in the upper ring, equivalent to the proximal (p1 and p2) subunits of FibL (Fig 5E and 5I ). Like FibL, FibU does not make close contacts with either MTP or Dit, but both FibU subunits contact the distal subunit of FibL ( Fig  5D and 5E ). FibU was not essential for infectivity, and deletion of the ORF68 gene did not affect the structure of the rest of the baseplate (S5 Fig). No density was observed for the predicted fibrous portion of FibU beyond residue 123 ( Fig  2C) . However, 2D class averages representing top views of the baseplate showed six thin fibers extending 9 nm radially from the baseplate and terminating in a 4 nm knob (Fig 1E) . These features might correspond to FibU fibers interacting with the air-water interface when the baseplate is oriented in the plane of the ice. When the baseplate is oriented laterally (Fig 1D) , the FibU fibers might be disordered and thus not observed in the reconstruction.",

Our identification of the C-terminus of TMP associated with Tal supports the assumption that tail assembly starts from a nucleus containing Dit, Tal, and TMP. The first MTP ring is added through interactions involving the MTP stacking loop and the Dit tail binding loop (Fig 3) . Additional MTP subunits are added through interactions of stacking loops and C-arms until the full length of the TMP is reached [10] . The peripheral structures are not required for this process, since deletions of the genes encoding RBP, FibL or FibU had no effect on tail formation (S5 Fig). The additions of RBP and FibL to the hub appear to be interdependent, whereas FibU is probably the last protein to be added to the baseplate. RBP (gp62) is the main receptor binding protein of 80\u03b1, and is essential for infectivity. The virtually identical RBP of \u03d511 was shown to bind WTA [21] , a polymer present in the cell wall of most Gram-positive organisms. WTA serves as receptor for many phages, but is highly variable between different species. Most strains of S. aureus have WTA that is distinct from that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, and is made from ribitol phosphate repeating units modified by GlcNAc [8, 9] . However, some pathogenic S. aureus strains belonging to the ST395 lineage express an altered form of WTA that is more similar to that of CoNS, resulting in altered phage susceptibility and immune system evasion [9] .",

The distantly related S. aureus-infecting podovirus P68 has a \"tail fiber\" protein (gp17) that is remarkably similar to the 80\u03b1 RBP [37] (25% sequence identity), suggesting that this structure is conserved among phages that infect S. aureus. In contrast, phage Andhra, which is structurally very similar to P68, but infects S. epidermidis [40] , has a completely different predicted RBP structure based on a \u03b2-helical architecture. Similarly, S. aureus phage \u03d5187, which infects the ST395 lineage of S. aureus, lacks an RBP-like protein, but has a tail fiber protein (gp24) that, by HHpred analysis, resembles parts of FibL, including an N-terminal Ig-like domain, a coiled-coil domain, a tower domain, and a C-terminal domain similar to the phage K tail fiber protein, gp68 (S6 Fig). A striking feature of the 80\u03b1 baseplate is the presence of two tail fiber proteins, FibL and FibU, in addition to RBP. These proteins are probably involved in host interactions, although it is not known whether they bind to WTA or other components of the staphylococcal cell wall. Although FibL was essential for 80\u03b1 infectivity, this could be because deletion of ORF62 also caused loss of RBP (S5 Fig). FibU was not essential, and deletion of ORF68 had no effect on either infectivity or baseplate integrity (S5 Fig). The two C-terminal domains of FibL are similar to those of phage K gp68 (S6 Fig), a large-genome myovirus that infects S. aureus strains belonging to several lineages [38] . Thus, while FibL and FibU may not be strictly required for infection of RN4220 under standard laboratory conditions, they could facilitate adsorption under certain conditions through low-affinity, reversible binding to surface structures (Fig 6A) . FibL and FibU could also be involved in binding divergent S. aureus strains that express altered WTA.",

Presumably, the presence of multiple copies of the receptor binding proteins increases the avidity of the low-affinity interaction with WTA and surface polysaccharides. In contrast, phages like \u03bb and SPP1 that use protein receptors-a high affinity interaction-generally do not have multiple receptor binding protein complexes. The conservation of the FibU and FibL NTDs with proteins from many phages suggests that this fold is optimized for making rings for the attachment of various structures to phage tails [41] .",

            "text": "Receptor binding is only the first step in the infection process that is mediated by the baseplate (Fig 6A) . Once bound, enzymatic activities associated with the baseplate are used to degrade the cell wall peptidoglycan and penetrate the cell wall. This process most likely requires conformational changes in the baseplate in order to expose the hydrolase domains of Tal and Hyd (Fig 6B) . We previously observed that treatment of 80\u03b1 with heat or low pH led to clustering of baseplates, presumably due to exposure of hydrophobic sequences resulting from a conformational change [16] . The observed conformational differences in the stem between the 80\u03b1 and \u03d511 RBPs and the phage P68 tail fiber (Fig 5B and 5C ) suggest that the hinge might constitute a pivot point that allows the RBPs to rotate. This movement might assist in orienting the baseplate perpendicular to the cell wall. Similarly, in p2, reorientation of its ORF18 receptor binding protein occurred as a consequence of a Ca 2+ -triggered conformational change in Dit [26] . Straightening of the RBP stem might also lead to release of FibL, which is bound to the RBP hinge (Fig 5D) .",

This conformational change is fundamentally different from the opening of the p2 baseplate [26] . Membrane penetration has to be signaled to the capsid in order to initiate DNA release and must be tightly regulated to avoid premature DNA ejection. Other studies have revealed no apparent conformational change in the tail tube associated with the infection process in siphoviruses [32] . Even in the myoviruses, tail contraction itself is not the signal that leads to ejection [11, 35] . Our observation of TMP \u03b1-helices associated with Tal resolves this conundrum: upon release by Tal, the TMP \u03b1-helices might act as a \"pull cord\" that drags the DNA along during injection (Fig 6C) . Most temperate bacteriophages with long tails (myoviruses and siphoviruses) share common features in structural and genomic organization, reflecting their common evolutionary origin [42] . According to the \"modular theory\" of phage evolution, phage genomes evolve by exchanging modular units consisting of protein domains, as opposed to whole genes or transcriptional units. In accordance with this principle, the tail and baseplate proteins in 80\u03b1 are based on a set of conserved modules that is found in a wide variety of phages. In 80\u03b1, MTP, Dit and Tal all incorporate the tail tube fold, one of the most highly conserved bacteriophage structural modules [31] . In contrast, the peripheral structures are far less conserved between 80\u03b1 and other phages, presumably reflecting different adsorption strategies between bacteriophages of different hosts. Nevertheless, the proteins that make up the peripheral structures share common domains with proteins from several bacteriophages, reflecting the modular evolution of these proteins. Modules such as Ig-like N-terminal domains, RBP tower domains and phage K tail fiber CTDs are repeated across phages from a broad range of hosts (S6 Fig) .",

The resulting 9.3 \u00c5 resolution (FSC 0.143 ) reconstruction was in turn low-pass filtered and used as an initial model in the reconstruction of the larger FSU dataset in RELION-2.1 [18] . 515,106 particles were picked from the 6,474 micrographs following frame alignment with dose weighting using MotionCor2 and CTF correction using Gctf, all from within RELION. After extensive 2D and 3D classification, the final reconstruction was calculated from 74,294 particles using the gold standard approach and assuming C6 symmetry throughout the reconstruction process. Following mask generation and map sharpening in RELION, the overall estimated resolution reached 3.75 \u00c5 (FSC 0.143 ) (Fig 1G and S1 Fig) , ranging from 3.1 \u00c5 in the baseplate core to >6.0 \u00c5 in peripheral parts of the fibers (S2 Fig). Generation of the C3 reconstruction used for modeling Tal and Dit required separation of the non-identical orientations of the C3 Tal trimer superimposed as a result of the initial assumption of C6 symmetry. The C6 reconstruction was segmented in UCSF Chimera [43] and a mask generated from all non-Tal density was used in subtracting the non-Tal density from the particle images using RELION-3.0 [19] . The resulting signal-subtracted images were C6 symmetry-expanded using relion_particle_symmetry_expand to create three copies of each particle where the Tal trimer, regardless of initial orientation, was superimposed with the 60r otated non-identical orientation. Masked 3D classification in RELION-3.0 of the expanded dataset using the Tal density from the C6 reconstruction as a reference yielded two good classes related by a 60\u02darotation and excluding particles with suboptimal Tal density. The more populated class was cleaned of duplicate particles, the orientations were transferred to the original, unsubtracted dataset, and the particles were reconstructed assuming C3 symmetry using RELION-3.0 with the C6 baseplate reconstruction as an initial model. Following post-processing, the resolution of the C3 reconstruction reached 4.07 \u00c5 resolution (FSC 0.143 , Fig 1G) . Focused reconstructions for RBP and the N-terminal parts of FibL and FibU were done in the same way, but without symmetry expansion and with the application of C6 symmetry to optimize the resolution of each for atomic model refinement. Reconstruction of signal-subtracted images lacking all non-FibL density (Fig 5G) in RELION-3.0 allowed assembly of a full-length FibL pseudo-atomic model by rigid-body fitting matched structures from HHpred to the density. These models were manually mutated to the FibL sequence and joined together and to the refined FibL NTD structure (Fig 5H) . The FSC curves and ResMap analysis for the various reconstructions are shown in S1 and S2 Fig, respectively. ",

Those best matching the baseplate reconstruction were fitted into the density using UCSF Chimera [43] . Changes to the protein sequence, extension of the models, and manual adjustments to the protein backbone, including local real-space refinement with secondary structure, torsion angle, rotameric, and Ramachandran restraints, were made in Coot [44] . The positions of large aromatic and basic side chains, as well as predicted secondary structures, were compared to the baseplate protein sequences and initial models to confirm the identity of proteins in the baseplate density and to correctly place the models during manual adjustment. The models were iteratively refined using real-space refinement in PHENIX [30] , followed by manual correction and local realspace refinement in Coot guided by geometry reports from MolProbity [45] and EMRinger [46] . All models except Tal and TMP were initially refined into the C6 reconstruction. The final Dit, Tal and TMP models were refined in the C3 reconstructions, while RBP, FibU and FibL were further refined in their respective focused reconstructions. All reconstructions were autosharpened in PHENIX for the final stages of model building. Simulated annealing, rigid body fitting, and morphing were included in early cycles of real-space refinement in PHENIX. Secondary structure restraints and non-crystallographic symmetry restraints generated from the models by PHENIX were included throughout. The model statistics for each protein are listed in S2 Table and the quality of the fit (FSC) is shown in S1 Fig. Model and map visualization was done in UCSF Chimera [43] .",
