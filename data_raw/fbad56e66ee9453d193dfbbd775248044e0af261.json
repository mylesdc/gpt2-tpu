The driving force for divergence in DNA composition among evolutionary related poxviruses is unknown, as is the ancestral composition, but range of DNA composition among genes is determined by at least 2 components: 1) the natural resistance of some genes to change because of restrictive amino acid requirements, and 2) the acquisition of novel genes after speciation of the viruses.",

One such technique is to draw a cumulative skew diagram, which plots the relative amounts of two nucleotides in a given DNA sequence [10] . A GC skew, for example, is calculated across a genome as the sum of a series of sliding windows of specified length; the window size can be 1 or much larger for a complete genome. The shape of the resulting cumulative dinucleotide curves have been correlated with important sequence features including viral origins of replication [11] and genome rearrangements in bacteria [12] . The \"DNA walk\" is another method used to study nucleotide distribution, first described by Lobry [7, 13] and used to detect origins of DNA replication in bacteria genomes. To graph a DNA walk, a direction (North, South, East, and West) is assigned to each of the four nucleotides and the sequence is then plotted on a graph, beginning at (0,0) and moving one step in the direction specified by each successive nucleotide. This paper describes GraphDNA, a new Java software application, that was developed as a platform-independent application to present DNA skews and walks of multiple sequences in a single graph and thus assist in the comparative analysis of nucleotide composition asymmetry.",

It was observed that the \"W\" shape of the purine skew ( Figures 1A and 1B) was very similar to the pattern for transcriptional orientation of the viral genes along the linear genome ( Figure 1C) . Examination of the genes from multiple orthopoxviruses confirmed that the coding strand of poxvirus genes tends to be slightly purine rich [21] . This information can be used to help annotate novel genes in poxvirus genomes in that if there are small ORFs on both DNA strands, then the strand with the highest purine content is most likely to be the coding strand; however, purine content is only one of a variety of information sources used in the annotation process [22] . Cumulative skew analysis may also be pertinent to some eukaryotic DNA sequences; for example, the coding strand of Leishmania major strain Friedlin chromosome 1 [23] is associated with an excess of pyrimidines.",

The program plots the cumulative dinucleotide counts calculated in a series of \"windows\", which may be as small as 1 nt, along the DNA sequences; GraphDNA offers all six possible cumulative skews (GC, AC, GT, TC, AG and AT). GC and AT skews have been widely used to predict termini and origins of replication in bacterial [1, 9] and mammalian genomes [8] , transcription start sites in plants and fungi [24] , as well as transcription regions in the human genome [25] . In poxviruses, some skews, for example the GA skew, appear to be independent of the orientation of transcription, and instead reflect the overall nucleotide composition of the genome ( Figure 2 ). However, when genomes are examined in more detail, heterogeneities can be observed. The GA skew of the 16 -38 Kb region of the crocodilepox virus genome from Figure 2 is displayed in Figure 3 . Genes 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34 and 35 appear to make up an island of unusual skew. This is interesting because genes 28, 33, 34 and 35 are distantly related and probably arose from ancient duplication events. Of all the genes in the region 28 -35, only gene 30 has any similarity to other known proteins; it is similar to DNAJ-like molecular chaperones and has an ortholog in MOCV, another GC rich poxvirus. The unusual overall base composition of this region may be the result of incorporation of foreign DNA into an ancestral crocodilepox virus genome. It is likely that this was through multiple events and an early smaller DNA island may have served as an integration site for subsequent insertions.",

When the SARS-coronavirus was first sequenced, it was reported that this novel virus was similarly and very distantly related to the three previously known groups of coronaviruses [26] . Subsequently, it was reported that SARS-coronavirus is slightly closer to the Group 2 coronaviruses [27, 28] and that it probably arose through a series of recombination events [29] . However, an examination of composition skews revealed that for most skews SARScoronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a Group 2 coronavirus are the most different; for example, see the keto, GA and AT skews in Figure 4A , 4B and 4C, respectively. Only the AC skews are most similar for SARS-coronavirus and the Group 2 MHV ( Figure 4D ). Several skews, and especially the purine skew ( Figure 4E ) indicate that the SARS-coronavirus genome is the most variable with regard to consistency of nucleotide composition across the genome. This is consistent with the ancient recombination events among ancestral coronaviruses proposed by Zhang et al. [29] after employing a battery of BLAST searches and 7 recombination detection techniques. Others have also examined nucleotide skews of coronaviruses, but this has been limited to GC skews [30, 31] that show a depletion of cytosine relative to guanosine in the 10 Kb at the 3' end of the SARS-coronavirus genome. Both Grigoriev [30] and Pyrc et al. [31] suggested that this resulted from the unusual transcription process of the coronaviruses, but differed in their detailed models.",

Gene annotations for this genome are show below the skew plot; genes are shown as red and blue bars to illustrate transcription towards the left and right ends of the genome, respectively. Green highlight shows 4 genes that are transcribed rightwards, which are flanked by genes transcribed leftwards. Panel B: Purine skew for the region highlighted in Panel A. Panel C: Plot of transcription orientation for Ectromelia virus genes. For genes transcribed to the left and right, the plot moves down and up, respectively. Green highlight as in Panel A.
