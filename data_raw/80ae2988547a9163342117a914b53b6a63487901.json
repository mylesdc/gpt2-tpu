            "text": "Replication of plus-strand RNA viruses depends on host factors that are recruited into viral replicase complexes. Previous studies showed that eukaryotic translation elongation factor (eEF1A) is one of the resident host proteins in the highly purified tombusvirus replicase complex. Using a random library of eEF1A mutants, we identified one mutant that decreased and three mutants that increased Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) replication in a yeast model host. Additional in vitro assays with whole cell extracts prepared from yeast strains expressing the eEF1A mutants demonstrated several functions for eEF1A in TBSV replication: facilitating the recruitment of the viral RNA template into the replicase complex; the assembly of the viral replicase complex; and enhancement of the minus-strand synthesis by promoting the initiation step. These roles for eEF1A are separate from its canonical role in host and viral protein translation, emphasizing critical functions for this abundant cellular protein during TBSV replication.",

These works demonstrated complex interactions between the host and plus-stranded (+)RNA viruses, the largest group among viruses. (+)RNA viruses contain relatively small genomes and greatly depend on the resources of the infected hosts in many steps during the infection process. These viruses recruit numerous host proteins to facilitate their replication and spread [8, 9, 10] . Many host RNA-binding proteins have been implicated in replication of (+)RNA viruses, including ribosomal proteins, translation factors and RNA-modifying enzymes [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] . In spite of the extensive effort, the actual function of host factors in (+)RNA virus replication is known only for a small number of host factors [8, 10, 15, 16, 17] .",

Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) expressing p33 and p92 pol replication proteins can efficiently replicate a short TBSV-derived replicon (rep)RNA [20, 21] . The tombusviral repRNA plays several functions, including serving as a template for replication and as a platform for the assembly of the viral replicase complex [19, 22, 23] . The viral RNA also participates in RNA recombination [6, 18, 24] , which likely plays a major role in virus evolution.",

Also, proteomics approaches with the highly purified tombusvirus replicase has determined at least seven proteins in the complex, including the viral p33 and p92 pol , the heat shock protein 70 chaperones (Hsp70, Ssa1/2p in yeast), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, encoded by TDH2 and TDH3 in yeast), pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1p), Cdc34p ubiquitin conjugating enzyme [14, 26, 27] and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) [25] . The functions of GAPDH and Hsp70 have been studied in some detail [14, 29, 30, 31] , but the roles of the other host proteins, such as eEF1A, in the replicase complex are currently undefined. eEF1A is a highly abundant cellular protein with a role in delivering aminoacyl-tRNA to the elongating ribosome in a GTPdependent manner. Many additional functions have been ascribed to eEF1A including quality control of newly produced proteins, ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation, and organization of the actin cytoskeleton [32, 33] . Although eEF1A has been shown to be part of replicase complexes of several RNA viruses [16, 34, 35, 36] , studies on determining its functions in virus replication are hindered by several major difficulties. These include (i) genetic redundancy: yeast has two eEF1A genes (TEF1 and TEF2), whereas animals and plants have 2-7 genes and several isoforms of eEF1A. (ii) eEF1A provides essential functions for cell viability and mutations could have pleiotropic effects on protein translation, actin bundling and apoptosis. (iii) eEF1A is a very abundant protein that constitutes 1-5% of total cellular proteins, making it difficult to completely remove eEF1A from biochemical assays using cell extracts. (iv) eEF1A is also required for the translation of viral proteins in infected cells, making it difficult to separate its effect on translation versus replication, processes that are interdependent.",

On the contrary, eEF1A was shown to enhance translation but repressed minus-strand synthesis of TYMV in vitro [37, 47, 48] . Overall, eEF1A likely plays a role in the replication of many RNA viruses. The interactions of eEF1A with viral RNAs and viral replication proteins and its high abundance in cells might facilitate recruitment of eEF1A into virus replication. eEF1A has been shown to interact with the components of the tombusvirus replicase, including the 39-UTR of the repRNA, as well as the p33 and p92 pol replication proteins [25] . eEF1A is also known to interact with the yeast Tdh2p (GAPDH) [49] , which is also a component of the tombusvirus replicase.

The obtained data support the model that eEF1A plays several roles during TBSV replication, including facilitating the assembly of the viral replicase complex. Moreover, using in vitro replication assays, we demonstrate that eEF1A enhances minus-strand synthesis via stimulating the initiation step of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Since eEF1A is also associated with several other viral replication proteins or binds to viral RNAs, it is possible that the uncovered functions of eEF1A might be utilized by other RNA viruses during their replication as well.",

            "text": "To determine the functions of eEF1A during tombusvirus replication, we generated ,6,000 yeast strains expressing eEF1A with random mutations (see Fig. S1A ) and tested the level of TBSV repRNA accumulation in a high-throughput assay [50] . In this assay, we used yeast strains, in which the two wt eEF1A genes (TEF1/TEF2) were deleted from the chromosome, while the wt or mutated eEF1A was expressed from plasmids. Importantly, a given eEF1A mutant is the only source of eEF1A in the yeast cells used. Using the high-throughput assay, we identified one yeast strain (N21) expressing an eEF1A mutant that supported reduced TBSV repRNA replication, while the other three strains with eEF1A mutants (named C42, C53 and C62) showed increased level of repRNA accumulation ( Fig. 1A and S1B-G). Interestingly, the eEF1A mutants supporting increased steady-state level of repRNA accumulation did not increase the relative level of p33 and p92 pol replication proteins (Fig. 1A , bottom panel; S1D-E). Thus, these eEF1A mutants likely affect TBSV replication directly. Accordingly, affinity purification of the solubilized tombusvirus replicase complex from yeast cells, followed by in vitro replicase activity assay revealed that the replicase from C42, C53 and C62 mutant eEF1A-expressing yeast strains had ,2-fold increased activities when compared with wt eEF1A-expressing yeast strain (Fig. 1B , lanes 1-6 versus 7-8). The amounts of replication protein p33 and the co-purified eEF1A were comparable in the purified replicase samples (Fig. 1B, bottom panel) , indicating that the differences in replicase activities in the mutants are likely due to enhanced replicase functions, and not due to altered proteins levels in the replicase complexes. Testing the ability of C42, C53 and C62 mutant eEF1As to bind to the viral RNA or to the p33 and p92 pol replication proteins in vitro ( Fig. S2B -C) did not reveal significant differences between the mutants and the WT. This further supports that these eEF1A mutations likely increase the function of the viral replicase without altering the protein and RNA components in the replicase.",

They replicate in the infected cells by assembling viral replicase complexes consisting of viral-and host-coded proteins. In this paper, we show that the eukaryotic translation elongation factor (eEF1A), which is one of the resident host proteins in the highly purified tombusvirus replicase complex, is important for Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) replication in a yeast model host. Based on a random library of eEF1A mutants, we identified eEF1A mutants that either decreased or increased TBSV replication. In vitro studies revealed that eEF1A facilitated the recruitment of the viral RNA template for replication and the assembly of the viral replicase complex, as well as eEF1A enhanced viral RNA synthesis in vitro. Altogether, this study demonstrates that eEF1A has several functions during TBSV replication. eEF1A mutants enhance TBSV RNA replication in a cellfree extract",

These yeast extracts contained comparable amount of total proteins as well as the amounts of eEF1A, ALP, PGK and Hsp70 (Ssa) yeast proteins were comparable ( Fig. 2A) . The advantage of the CFE extracts is that they can then be programmed with the TBSV (+)repRNA in the presence of purified recombinant p33 and p92 pol obtained from E. coli that leads to the in vitro assembly of the viral replicase, followed by a single cycle of complete TBSV replication, resulting in both (2)stranded repRNA and (+)-stranded progeny [31, 52] .

The template specificity of the recombinant TCV RdRp with TBSV RNAs is similar to the closely-related tombusvirus replicase obtained from yeast or infected plants [21, 54, 55, 56] . However, the recombinant TCV RdRp preparation lacks co-purified eEF1A, unlike the yeast or plant-derived tombusvirus replicase preparations, facilitating studies on the role of eEF1A on the template activity of a viral RdRp. When we added the highly purified wt eEF1A to the RdRp assay containing TCV RdRp protein and a TBSV derived (+)RNA template, which is used by the TCV RdRp in vitro to produce the complementary (2)RNA product (Fig. 3A , lanes 3-4) [55] , we observed a ,6-fold increase in (2)RNA synthesis by the TCV RdRp (lanes 11-12), while, as expected, we did not detect new (+)RNA progeny (not shown).

The second template was SL1m with a point mutation within the promoter sequence, which is being used more efficiently by the TCV RdRp in vitro. Note that eEF1A has been shown to bind to the replication silencer element. The RdRp assay had two steps: first, the shown components were incubated at room temperature to facilitate their interaction, followed 5 min latter the addition of the shown component and the ribonucleotides to start RNA synthesis. The RdRp activity in samples containing the template RNA and the RdRp were chosen as 100% (lanes 3-4).

DB inhibits the activity of GTP-bound eEF1A during translation by binding to a pocket in eEF1A involved in the interaction with the aminoacylated tRNA and the nucleotide exchange factor eEF1Balpha [59, 60] . GM has been shown to inhibit the actin bundling function, while it does not inhibit protein translation or GTP binding functions of eEF1A [61] . We found that both DB and GM efficiently inhibited TBSV repRNA replication in the in vitro assay with CFE, which contains the endogenous eEF1A (Fig. 4A ). Time-course experiments revealed that the inhibition by DB was the most effective when the inhibitor was added at the beginning or during the first 10-15 min of the assay (Fig. 4B , lanes 2-5), while GM inhibited the cell-free replication of TBSV repRNA when added not only at the beginning, but up to 40 min after the start of the assay (lanes [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . It is known that the recruitment of the viral RNA and replication proteins as well as the assembly of the viral replicase complex take place during the first 40-60 min in the cell-free assay [31] . Since DB could inhibit translation, we also tested the effect of another translation inhibitor, namely cycloheximide, which did not affect TBSV repRNA replication in our assay (Fig. S3) . These data suggest that the inhibition by DB and GM is unlikely through decreased translation in the replication assay. Therefore, the above data are consistent with the model that DB and GM interfere with the assembly of the viral replicase complex in the CFE. Also, GM seems to be a more potent inhibitor of TBSV replication than DB.",

In this assay, first, we only provide ATP and GTP in addition to the replication proteins, the (+)repRNA and CFE, which can support the assembly of the replicase, but cannot perform RNA synthesis due to the lack of CTP and UTP [31] . After 1 hr incubation, once the replicase assembly had taken place, we collected the membrane fraction of the CFE by centrifugation and removed the supernatant containing the unbound p33, p92, repRNA as well as the cytosolic fraction of the CFE. Then we added all four rNTPs (including 32 P-labeled UTP) to the membrane fraction of the CFE to allow for RNA synthesis by the pre-assembled replicase complex (second step, Fig. 4C ) [31] . Interestingly, adding either DB or GM during the first step resulted in robust inhibition of TBSV repRNA synthesis during the second step of the assay (Fig. 4C, lanes 2-3 versus 1) , whereas providing the same amount of DB and GM at the beginning of the second step did not result in inhibition of repRNA replication (lanes 4-6) . These data support a model that DB and GM could inhibit the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase complex, but not the RNA synthesis by the already assembled replicase.

We found that GM strongly interfered with the binding of eEF1A to the viral RNA in an EMSA assay (Fig. 4D, lanes 3-6 versus 2) , whereas DB did not affect the binding under the assay conditions (lanes 9-12). Since DB binds only weakly to eEF1A in solution, but it binds much more effectively to eEF1A in the presence of GTP and the ribosome [62] , we also performed in vitro co-purification experiments. First, 35 S-labeled eEF1A was produced in an in vitro translation system (containing ribosome and GTP) and, second, biotin-labeled viral (+)repRNA was added. After short incubation in the absence or presence of various amount of DB, we performed affinity-purification of the viral RNA. Phosphoimaging revealed that eEF1A was co-purified with the viral RNA and the amount of protein co-purified with the viral (+)repRNA was inhibited by increasing amount of DB in the assay (Fig. 4E , compare lane 1 with [2] [3] [4] [5] . This demonstrated that DB inhibits the binding of eEF1A to the viral repRNA. Moreover, both DB and GM interfered with the recruitment of the viral template RNA to the membrane of the CFE containing endogenous eEF1A (Fig. 4F,  lanes 5-8 versus 3-4) . On the other hand, DB and GM do not seem to affect the interaction between eEF1A and p33 or p92 replication proteins in vitro (Fig. S4B) . Altogether, these data suggest that inhibition of eEF1A function by DB and GM could block several steps during the assembly of the tombusvirus replicase complex, including template binding by eEF1A and viral RNA recruitment into replication.",

Translation factors, such as eEF1A, are among the most common host factors recruited for (+)RNA virus replication. eEF1A is an integral component of several viral replicases, including the highly purified tombusvirus replicase complex. Since eEF1A is an essential G protein involved in translation elongation, it is difficult to obtain evidence for its direct involvement in virus replication in living cells. Indeed, down-regulation of eEF1A in cells has led not only to decreased TBSV repRNA accumulation, but also reduced p33 levels [25] . However, using a small set of functional eEF1A mutants defective in various functions revealed that eEF1A is involved in stabilization of p33 replication protein in yeast [25] .",

Among these mutants, C42, C53 and C62 increased TBSV repRNA replication. Importantly, this effect by the eEF1A mutants was not due to changing the translation efficiency of p33/p92 pol , but likely via directly altering viral replication and affecting the activity of the viral replicase. On the other hand, N21 mutant of eEF1A resulted in decreased TBSV RNA accumulation and also led to reduction in the level of p33 replication protein. This is reminiscent of the previously characterized GDP-binding mutant T 22 S [25], which supported greatly reduced level of viral RNA replication and p33 accumulation due to shortened half-life of p33. Overall, N21 mutant further supports that one of the functions of eEF1A in TBSV replication is to stabilize the p33 replication protein in yeast.",

Since we used the same amount of purified recombinant p33/p92 pol in this in vitro assay (i.e., translation in the CFE is not needed for production of p33/p92 pol ), the role of eEF1A in TBSV replication must be separate from its role in protein translation. Altogether, these data strongly established that eEF1A is directly involved in TBSV replication, independent of the role of eEF1A in protein translation. Fig. 2 . DB (150 mM) and GM (100 mM) were added at various time points and the replicase assay was stopped after 3 hours for each treatment, followed by RNA analysis in a denaturing PAGE gel. The replicase activity in the samples containing DMSO added at the 0 time point was chosen as 100%. (C) A step-wise approach was used to separate the possible effect of DB and GM during either the assembly of the TBSV replicase or RNA synthesis steps. In step 1, the purified recombinant TBSV p33, p92 pol and (+)repRNA were added to the whole cell extract in the presence of ATP and GTP, which only supports the assembly of the TBSV replicase, but prevents RNA synthesis. This was followed by removal of the extra amount of p33, p92 pol and repRNA, which were not bound to the membranes of cell-free extract, and then by the standard replicase assay in a buffer containing 32 P-UTP and ATP, CTP and GTP (step ''RNA synthesis''). The denaturing PAGE analysis of the 32 P-labeled repRNA products obtained is shown. Note that DB (150 mM) and GM (100 mM) were added to the assay either at the beginning (prior to replicase assembly) or after the replicase assembly. See further details in panel B. (D) The effect of DB and GM on binding between the purified eEF1A and 32 P-labeled template RNA (SL1/SL2/SL3) based on EMSA. The bound and unbound RNAs are pointed at by arrowheads. GM and DB were applied in the following amounts: 0, 5, 50, 250, and 1000 mM. Note that the amount of unbound RNA in the absence of eEF1A (lane 1) was chosen as 100%. (E) The inhibitory effect of DB on co-purification of eEF1A with the viral repRNA. WT 35 S-labeled eEF1A was produced in a translation assay using rabbit reticulocyte lysate, followed by incubation with biotin-labeled DI-72(+) repRNA in the presence of 0, 50, 150, 500 and 1000 mM DB. Then the repRNA was captured with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, followed by elution of the co-purified proteins from the beads. SDS-PAGE analysis shows the amount of co-purified 35 S-labeled eEF1A. (F) The inhibitory effect of DB and GM on the template recruitment step in vitro. Purified recombinant p33/p92 and 32 P-labeled DI-72 (+)repRNA (indicated as W, lanes 1 and 3-8) or C 99 -G mutant (+)repRNA (indicated as M, lane 2) were added to a whole cell extract (CFE) in the presence of DMSO (control), 100 mM GM or 150 mM DB, followed by centrifugation/washing to remove the 32 P-labeled repRNA that is not bound to the membrane. Then the membrane-bound RNA was analyzed in a denaturing PAGE gel.

            "text": "We confirmed a direct role for eEF1A in RNA synthesis in vitro by using a highly purified eEF1A and the recombinant TCV RdRp, which is closely homologous with the TBSV p92 pol . Interestingly, it seems that eEF1A stimulates the RdRp activity directly, since pre-incubation of eEF1A and the RdRp prior to the RdRp assay led to the highest level of stimulation of (2)RNA synthesis (Fig. 3A) . On the other hand, pre-incubation of eEF1A with the TBSV-derived template RNA led only to ,2-fold increase in RNA synthesis in vitro (Fig. 3A) . Analyzing the amount of short abortive RdRp products, which are produced through initiation followed quickly by abortive termination [57] , in the in vitro assays revealed that eEF1A strongly enhanced the initiation of minus-strand synthesis (Fig. 3B) . Although the actual mechanism of stimulation of RdRp activity by eEF1A is currently unknown, we propose that eEF1A might facilitate the proper and efficient binding of the RdRp to the 39 terminal sequence of the viral RNA prior to initiation of (2)-strand synthesis (Fig. 5) . Accordingly, eEF1A was shown to bind to the so-called replication silencer sequence (RSE) in the 39-UTR, which is required for the assembly of the viral replicase complex [22, 58] . The binding of eEF1A-RdRp complex to the RSE might assist in placing the RdRp over the 39-terminal promoter sequence, thus facilitating the initiation of (2)RNA synthesis starting from the 39-terminal cytosine. Similar function of eEF1A in stimulation of (2)RNA synthesis has been proposed for WNV, based on mutations in the viral RNA within the eEF1A binding sequence that reduced the binding affinity of RNA to eEF1A and inhibited (2)RNA synthesis in infected cells [46] . eEF1A stimulates the assembly of the viral replicase complex during TBSV replication Recent intensive work revealed that the assembly of the viral replicase complex is a regulated process involving viral-and host factors, cellular membranes and the viral (+)RNA [8, 10, 19, 63, 64, 65] . The assembly of the viral replicase also depends on steps occurring prior to the actual assembly process, such as selection of the viral template RNA and the recruitment of (+)RNA/protein factors to the sites of assembly. Although our current understanding is rather poor about the factors involved and their functions during replicase assembly, rapid progress is being made in this area due to the development of a new cell-free assay based on yeast CFE [30, 31] . The yeast CFE is capable of assembling the tombusvirus replicase complex in vitro in 40-60 min in the presence of recombinant p33/p92 pol and the viral (+)repRNA [31] , allowing for studies on direct roles of various factors. We find that inhibition of eEF1A activity by either DB or GM also inhibited the assembly of the tombusviral replicase complex based on time-course experiments (Fig. 4B ) as well as a direct replicase assembly assay (Fig. 4C) . On the contrary, the replicase activity was not inhibited by these compounds after the assembly took place (Fig. 4B-C) . It is possible that after the formation of the eEF1A-RdRp-repRNA complex DB or GM are not effective in inhibiting the stimulatory effect of eEF1A on the RNA synthesis by the viral RdRp. Additional in vitro experiments with purified tombusvirus replicase preparations confirmed the lack of inhibition of RNA synthesis by DB or GM (Fig. S4A ) on pre-assembled virus replicases.",

The plasmid pESCHIS4-ADH-His33/CUP1-DI-72 expressing Cucumber necrosis virus (CNV) p33 and the TBSV replicon RNA, called DI-72, was described earlier [25] . The LYS2-based plasmid pRS317-Tet-His92, expressing CNV p92 under the control of Tetracycline-regulatable (Tet) promoter was constructed as follows: the Tet promoter sequence was obtained from pCM189-His92/Tet [73] by digestion with EcoRI and BamHI, and CNV p92 coding sequences from pGAD-His92 [7] digested with BamHI and PstI, followed by ligation into pRS317 vector treated with EcoRI and PstI. To generate mutations within TEF1 coding sequence by random mutagenesis, we constructed the TRP1-based plasmid pRS314-pTEF1-TEF1, which expressed TEF1 under the control of its native promoter. The TEF1 promoter sequence, the TEF1 coding region and the Cyc1 terminator sequences were amplified by PCR with the following primer pairs, #2764 (CCGCGAGCTCATAGCTTCAAAAT-GTTTCTAC)/#2765 (CCGCGGATCCGTAATTAAAACT-TAGATTAGATTGC), #2768 (CCGCGGATCCAAAATGGG-TAAAGAGAAGTCTC)/#1877 (CCGCCTCGAGTTATTTC-TTAGCAGCCTTTTGAGCAGC), and #2769 CCGCCTCG-AGGAGGGCCGCATCATGTAA/#2770 (CCGCGGTACCA-GCTTGCAAATTAAAGCCTTC), respectively.

The transformed yeast cultures were grown in a Synthetic Complete (SC) media with 2% glucose lacking leucine, histidine, lysine and uracil (SC-ULHK 2 ) by shaking at 29uC overnight. To completely suppress TBSV replication before induction, 1 mg/ml Doxycycline was added to the media to inhibit the expression of p92. The plasmid pool carrying the randomly mutated TEF1 gene was introduced into the yeast cells already transformed with the two virus expression plasmids by in vivo gap repair mechanism via homologous recombination (Fig. S1A) [75] . Briefly, pRS314-pTEF1-TEF1 was digested with enzymes to truncate the TEF1 coding sequence, and then the digested plasmid was recovered. The gapped plasmid (5-10 mg) was transformed together with overlapping PCR (20 mg) products carrying the TEF1 mutations created by random mutagenic PCR (see above). The transformed yeast cells were selected on SC media lacking uracil, tryptophan, leucine, histidine and lysine. The colonies were further streaked onto SC media plate lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine and lysine (SC-TLHK 2 ) with 0.1% (w/v final) 5-Fluoroorotic Acid (5-FOA) media to select against the URA3-based wild-type TEF1 plasmid (Fig. S1A) . This selection was repeated once and the loss of URA3 plasmid was confirmed by the inability of the yeast strains to grow on uracil-minus media. The yeast cells carrying the randomly mutated TEF1 were grown at 29uC for 24 h in SC-TLHK 2 media with 50 mM CuSO 4 to induce virus replication. Total RNA extraction from yeast cells and Northern blotting and Western blotting were done as previously described [7, 25] .",

The in vitro RNA recruitment reaction was performed according to [31] , except that 32 P-labeled DI-72 (+)repRNA were used and rCTP, rUTP, 32 P-labeled UTP, and Actinomycin D were omitted from the reaction. As a negative control, a recruitment-deficient repRNA, termed C 99 -G mutant, was used (Fig. 4F , lane 2) [23] . This mutant RNA is not recognized by p33/p92 replication proteins and it does not replicate in plants, in yeast or in the CFE in vitro [23, 31, 52, 77] . The RNA recruitment assay results in the assembly of the functional viral replicase, when wt repRNA is used, and nonfunctional replicase when the C 99 -G mutant is used in the assay (J. Pogany and P.D. Nagy, not shown) [31] . Inhibitors DB and GM were added at final concentration of 150 and 100 mM, respectively. After two hours of incubation at room temperature, 1 ml of reaction buffer was added to the in vitro assay, followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 35,0006 g for 1h, and the pellet was washed with 1 ml reaction buffer, followed by centrifugation at 35,0006 g for 10 min.

The cell-free TBSV replicase assay was performed as described in Fig. 4 . Cyclohexamide was added in the following amounts: 0, 2, 10, 50, 100 mg/ml. The membrane-bound tombusvirus replicase in a yeast lysate was solubilized with Triton X-100/SB3-10 detergent, followed by purification on a FLAG-affinity column as described. The activity of the affinity-purified TBSV replicase was tested on the same amount of DI-72(2) RNA added to each sample. DB (panel on the left) and GM (panel on the right) were added in the following amounts: 0, 100, 150, 200, 250 mM for DB and 0, 25, 50, 100, 200 mM for GM. Denaturing PAGE analysis of the 32 P-labeled RNA products obtained with the purified tombusvirus replicase is shown. Note that this replicase preparation is only capable of complementary RNA synthesis on the added template RNA, but incapable of supporting a full cycle of replication. (B) The effect of GM and DB on binding to the viral p33 and p92 proteins in vitro. MBP-tagged p92 and p33 were separately immobilized on amylose beads, followed by incubation in the presence of 0 or 100 mM GM or 150 mM DB with a cytosolic extract prepared from yeast expressing wt eEF1A. The bound eEF1A was eluted from the beads and were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and detected via Western blotting using anti-eEF1A antibody (Top panel). The affinity-purified recombinant MBP-TBSV p92, MBP-TBSV p33 and MBP were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue-staining (Bottom panel).

The yeast cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 5006g for 5 min at 4uC to remove unbroken cells and debris. The membrane fraction containing the viral replicase complex was collected by centrifugation at 21,0006 g for 15 min at 4uC and then solubilized in 1 ml TG buffer with a buffer containing 1% NP-40, 5% SB3-10 [caprylyl sulfobetaine] (Sigma), 1% [V/V] Ypic via gentle rotation for 1 h min at 4uC. The solubilized membrane fraction was centrifuged at 21,0006 g for 15 min at 4uC and the supernatant was incubated with 20 ml anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity resin (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with 0.7 ml TG buffer. After 2 h of gentle rotation at 4uC, we washed the resin 5 times with TG buffer containing 1% NP-40, the resin-bound replicase complex was eluted in 100 ml elution buffer[50 mM   Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 10% glycerol, 15 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM KCl, 0.05 M NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), 1% Ypic and 0.15 mg/ml Flag peptide (sigma)]. In vitro RdRp activity assay was performed by using DI-72 RI(2) RNA template transcribed in vitro by T7 transcription[25].",
