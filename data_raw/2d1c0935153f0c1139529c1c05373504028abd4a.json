C) NS5 has a retention volume around 68 mL in a superdex 200 gel filtration column, consistent with a monomeric state. that motif G of JEV NS5 adopt a canonical conformation. In a very recent report [2] , binding of an inhibitor helped resolve the missing part of motif G in the original DENV RdRP model. However, the observed conformation deviates significantly from the JEV model.",
