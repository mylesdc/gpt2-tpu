Only the laboratory confirmed cases were used in this study. The 96 occurrence points varied in terms of spatial clumping, so we subsampled them to reduce sampling bias and effects of spatial autocorrelation, as follows. We first generated models using all available occurrence points, and measured spatial autocorrelation among model pseudoresiduals (1 -probability of occurrence generated by model) by calculating Moran's I at multiple distance classes using SAM v4.0 [13] ; significance was determined using permutation tests. A minimum distance of 13 km was detected, after which we created a grid with cell dimensions of 0.11760.117u, and selected the occurrence point closest to the centroid of each grid cell; this procedure reduced the number of occurrences to 77 points for final model calibration.",

Sixteen-day NDVI composites were obtained for January 2012 to June 2013 at a resolution of 1 km 2 (http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/ data/). We used two approaches by which to reduce dimensionality from the initial 34 data layers. The first was to extract the first 10 principal component axes to summarize major axes of variation among the 34 NDVI layers (97.5% of overall variation); this dataset captured major dimensions of environmental variation across eastern China. The second 'bioNDVI' was based on all biweekly images from January 2012 -June 2013, transformed into data layers parallel to 'bioclimatic' variables (i.e. mean, maximum, minimum, range, and standard deviation) over the entire period, plus a parallel data set (mean, maximum, minimum, range, standard deviation) over spring 2013 (March-May) only, the period which we believe most relevant to the H7N9 outbreak.",

We thresholded model predictions to produce binary maps by assessing the highest suitability value at which 90% of input occurrence points were included in the predicted suitable area (i.e. Maxent's 10% training presence threshold).

The general distributional pattern of H7N9 has not been understood in detail to date, such that the distributional pattern so far has manifested sporadic and small clusters (Figure 1 ). Knowledge about the main virus reservoirs and the extent and distribution of the virus in animals remains limited, in spite of considerable efforts (e.g. [8] ), it is likely that most human cases were exposed to the H7N9 virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including markets that sell live poultry [16] . However clear links between infections in poultry and human cases have been difficult to establish, because this virus does not appear to cause clinical signs in infected poultry. Information to date also does not support sustained human-tohuman transmission [17] . Effective and predictive risk maps can provide a useful means by which to design targeted surveillance efforts [3] [4] [5] [6] , and ecological niche modeling approaches are offering novel views of the geography of potential for disease transmission [9, 18] . Many aspects of the natural history, geography, and ecology of H7N9 virus remain poorly known or unknown; in such cases, niche modeling can only be applied to the outputs of the overall cycle as a ''black box'', attempting to capture the integration of relevant niche components in H7N9 virus.",

Here, we developed multitemporal vegetation index datasets to match the H7N9 outbreaks in spatiotemporal coverage; the hope was to characterize ecological requirements of H7N9 optimally, although many questions concerning the sporadic outbreaks of H7N9 remain up in the air. Using these datasets, models showed good performance in anticipating the known geographic distribution of independent occurrence records (including the new emerging cases in January 2014); however, given that H7N9 is likely still in the process of spreading out to its full distributional and environmental potential, we are most confident in our result as near-term and local solution rather than as global summaries. For H5N1, researchers integrated large data sets combining information on poultry trade routes, numbers of birds being transported, distribution of live-bird markets, supply routes, waterfowl numbers, land use, and human population densities to trace H5N1 transmission (e.g. [21] [22] ). For H7N9, such analyses are only just beginning [3] [4] [5] [6] , particularly as sources of data on the virus and routes by which it infects humans remain unclear. Birds at live poultry markets have been suspected as a source, but broad testing of poultry and other animals have not turned up significant infection rates [3] ; only isolates from Shanghai live poultry markets showed high homology with viruses causing human infections [8] . Based on experience with H5N1, Butler [3] suggested that high suitability areas for H7N9 might include Shandong Province and a belt extending around the Bohai Sea to Liaoning Province in the north.",
