With the exception of the highly pathogenic SARS and MERS coronaviruses, human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-HKU1) circulate worldwide and typically cause the common cold. In most cases, infection with these viruses does not lead to severe disease, although acute infections in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients may progress to severe disease requiring hospitalization. Importantly, no drugs against human coronaviruses exist, and only supportive therapy is available. Previously, we proposed the cationically modified chitosan, N-(2hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC), and its hydrophobicallymodified derivative (HM-HTCC) as potent inhibitors of the coronavirus HCoV-NL63. Here, we show that HTCC inhibits interaction of a virus with its receptor and thus blocks the entry. Further, we demonstrate that HTCC polymers with different degrees of substitution act as effective inhibitors of all low-pathogenic human coronaviruses.",

CoVs are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with large genomes of approximately 27-32 kb, and their genomic RNA is capped and polyadenylated. The 5' two-thirds of the CoV genome encode a polyprotein that is post-translationally processed to yield all proteins required for RNA replication (non-structural proteins), whereas the 3' one-third of the genome encodes a canonical set of four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. The S glycoprotein of CoV belongs to class I viral fusion proteins and facilitates virus-receptor interactions.",

However, the virus disappeared before summer 2003 and never returned in its highly virulent form [2, 3] . The second, most recently isolated CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes pneumonia and renal failure, with a mortality rate exceeding 30% [4, 5] .

A thorough analysis of the HTCC activity proved that the polymer interacts with the S protein of HCoV-NL63 and blocks its interaction with the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) protein. Furthermore, we show that HTCC with different degrees of substitution (DSs) is to be a potent inhibitor of all four LP-HCoVs. DSs are expressed as the fraction of NH 2 groups substituted within the chitosan chain. The DS of the studied HTCC polymers varied between 57% and 77%; thus the polymers were named HTCC-57, HTCC-62, HTCC-63, HTCC-65 and HTCC-77. The previously described HTCC polymer of a DS of 63% (here marked as HTCC-63) demonstrated an inhibitory effect not only on HCoV-NL63, but also on HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. Interestingly, two different HTCCs, HTCC-62 and HTCC-77, proved to be effective inhibitors of HCoV-229E infection. Further, HTCC-65 effectively inhibited replication of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43, while HTCC-62 showed strong antiviral effect on HCoV-HKU1 infection. Taken together, the current analysis demonstrates that the combination of these cationically modified chitosan-based polymeric compounds into a single formulation may act as an effective broad-range anticoronaviral agent for the treatment of coronaviral infections.",

The suspension was subsequently centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to remove suspended unreacted chitosan. The product was separated from the supernatant via precipitation in acetone and subsequent centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 20 min. The solution was decanted and the resulting polymeric pellet was air dried and dissolved in distilled water. The purification process was repeated twice and the purified HTCC was dried in vacuum oven for 24 h. The DSs of the polymers obtained are given in Table 1 .",

For this, we analyzed the influence of HTCC-63 on different steps of HCoV-NL63 replication cycle. First, we determined whether the polymer interacts directly with HCoV-NL63 virions. To achieve this, concentrated virus stock was incubated with the polymer (200 \u03bcg/ml) or control 1 \u00d7 PBS at room temperature for 2 h. Subsequently, samples were diluted 200 times (polymer concentration was below the active range) and titrated as described by Reed and Muench; titers were evaluated on day 5 p.i. [11] . No decrease in virus titer was observed for the HTCC-63 polymer, compared to control sample (data not shown). Further, the effect of HTCC-63 on virus adhesion to susceptible cells was evaluated. Briefly, LLC-Mk2 cells were pre-cooled and incubated with gradient-purified HCoV-NL63 at 4\u00b0C for 2 h in the presence of HTCC-63 (200 \u03bcg/ml) or control PBS. At this temperature virus can bind to the receptor, while virus internalization is suppressed due to intracellular trafficking inhibition. Next, HCoV-NL63 cell surface adhesion was evaluated using flow cytometry. The virus adherence was not inhibited in the presence of HTCC-63, suggesting that the polymer does not hamper virus binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPs) (Fig 1) [13] . Surprisingly, the adherence of HCoV-NL63 particles seemed to be enhanced in the presence of HTCC. One may assume that HCoV-NL63 virions cluster in the presence of HTCC, as they bind to the polymer via the S protein forming aggregates. To support these data, another assay was performed, where LLC-Mk2 cells were pre-cooled and incubated with HCoV-NL63 (TCID 50 of 400) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of HTCC-63 (200 \u03bcg/ml) or control PBS. Next, culture media containing the unbound virus were removed and cells were rinsed 3 times with ice cold 1 \u00d7 PBS. Virus infection was evaluated at day 5 p.i., based on the occurrence of the cytopathic effect (CPE) and quantitative RT-PCR. Obtained results demonstrated that HTCC-63 did not inhibit adhesion of HCoV-NL63 virions to the cell surface (data not shown).",

For this, we analyzed virus co-localization with the receptor in the presence of the HTCC-63 or control 1 \u00d7 PBS. As naturally susceptible LLC-Mk2 cells express only low levels of the ACE2 protein, we used previously described A549 cells with directed ACE2 expression (A549_ACE2 + ) [13] .

Subsequently, cells were fixed and immunostained for the ACE2 and HCoV-NL63 nucleoprotein using specific antibodies. Virus co-localization with its receptor was examined using confocal microscopy. Obtained results demonstrated that in the control samples virions co-localize with the ACE2 protein, while in the presence of the polymer this interaction is abolished (Fig 2) .

Briefly, pre-cooled LLC-Mk2 cells were inoculated with ice-cold HCoV-NL63 at TCID 50 of 400 and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 h to allow virus binding, but not internalization. Next, virus particles were removed by washing with ice-cold 1 \u00d7 PBS and cells were incubated with the HTCC-63 (50-200 \u03bcg/ml) or control medium at 32\u00b0C for 2 h to enable virus penetration and to evaluate whether the polymer interferes with this process. Subsequently, the media were removed and cells were washed 3 times with acidic buffer (0.1 M glycine, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 3.0) in order to inhibit the fusogenic activity of virions that were not internalized [15] [16] [17] . The efficiency of virus deactivation using the low pH was verified prior to these experiment (data not shown). Subsequently, cells were washed with 1 \u00d7 PBS (pH 7.4), and overlaid with culture medium. Cells were incubated at 32\u00b0C for 5 days. The occurrence of the CPE at day 5 p.i. was evaluated and virus yield in cell culture supernatants was measured using a quantitative RT-PCR. First, no CPE was visible in cultures incubated with the polymer, while in control culture obvious signs of virus replication were visible. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed these qualitative results, as 4-log decrease in virus yield was observed in samples treated with HTCC-63 polymer, compared to control cells (Fig 3) .

The fact that polymers with different substitution levels are active against different CoVs suggest that these compounds interact with the S protein of different viruses, and may be optimized to be active also against other species. Thus, HTCCs hold great promise as anticoronaviral agents for use in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. Importantly, chitosan and chitosan-based polymers are not toxic in vivo, as shown by Yeh et al [28] . Further, Zeng et al demonstrated that HTCC is rapidly absorbed from gastrointestinal tract. The polymer was mainly distributed to lung, heart and kidney, whereas 24 hours later it was fully eliminated. These properties make HTCC a very promising compound for the use in clinic [29] .",

LLC-Mk2 cells were infected with HCoV-NL63 in the presence of HTCCs with DS ranging from 57% to 77% at a concentration of 200 \u03bcg/ml or control medium. Likewise, MRC-5 cells were infected with HCoV-229E and HCT-8 cells were infected with HCoV-OC43 in the presence of HTCCs with DS ranging from 57% to 77% at 200 \u03bcg/ml or control medium. HAE cultures were infected with HCoV-HKU1 in the presence of HTCCs with DS The combination of HTCCs with different DS exhibits broad anticoronaviral activityThis study showed that HTCCs with different DSs function as potent inhibitors of all four LP-HCoVs. However, the HTCC antiviral activity against different pathogens varied depending on the percentage of amine groups substituted with ammonium groups in the polymer chain, i.e., the DS of the polymer. For example, HCoV-NL63 infection was effectively inhibited by HTCC-63 and HTCC-65, whereas HCoV-229E replication was significantly reduced by HTCC-62 and HTCC-77. To analyze whether these two pathogens could be inhibited using a single HTCC preparation, we tested the inhibitory effect of HTCC-62/63 and HTCC-63/77 mixtures on HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E infection. The results of in vitro study using LLC-Mk2 and MRC-5 cell lines demonstrated a significant decrease (an approximate 4 log reduction compared to the control sample) in HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E virus yields in the presence of HTCC-62/63 or HTCC-63/77 mixtures (1:1 w/w)(Fig 6).",
