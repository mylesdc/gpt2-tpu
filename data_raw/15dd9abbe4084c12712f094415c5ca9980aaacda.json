            "text": "Background: The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is a genomic region containing genes with crucial roles in immune responses. MHC class I and class II genes encode antigen-presenting molecules expressed on the cell surface. To counteract the high variability of pathogens, the MHC evolved into a region of considerable heterogeneity in its organization, number and extent of polymorphism. Studies of MHCs in different model species contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of immunity, diseases and their evolution. Camels are economically important domestic animals and interesting biomodels. Three species of Old World camels have been recognized: the dromedary (Camelus dromedarius), Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) and the wild camel (Camelus ferus). Despite their importance, little is known about the MHC genomic region, its organization and diversity in camels. The objectives of this study were to identify, map and characterize the MHC region of Old World camelids, with special attention to genetic variation at selected class MHC II loci. Results: Physical mapping located the MHC region to the chromosome 20 in Camelus dromedarius. Cytogenetic and comparative analyses of whole genome sequences showed that the order of the three major sub-regions is \"Centromere -Class II -Class III -Class I\". DRA, DRB, DQA and DQB exon 2 sequences encoding the antigen binding site of the corresponding class II antigen presenting molecules showed high degree of sequence similarity and extensive allele sharing across the three species. Unexpectedly low extent of polymorphism with low numbers of alleles and haplotypes was observed in all species, despite different geographic origins of the camels analyzed. The DRA locus was found to be polymorphic, with three alleles shared by all three species. DRA and DQA sequences retrieved from ancient DNA samples of Camelus dromedarius suggested that additional polymorphism might exist. Conclusions: This study provided evidence that camels possess an MHC comparable to other mammalian species in terms of its genomic localization, organization and sequence similarity. We described ancient variation at the DRA locus, monomorphic in most species. The extent of molecular diversity of MHC class II genes seems to be substantially lower in Old World camels than in other mammalian species.",

            "text": "Pathogens are considered to be one of the driving forces of evolution. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a genomic region containing immune response (IR) genes, which play a crucial role in host and pathogen interactions. MHC class I and class II genes encode antigen-presenting molecules responsible for the dual recognition of antigenic peptides on the cell surface [1] . MHC-encoded antigen presenting molecules are thus directly involved in molecular interactions with specific peptides derived from pathogens to which a population is exposed. Therefore, the MHC genes are under strong selective pressure and contain signatures of both positive and negative selection [2] . To counteract the high variability of pathogens and pathogen-derived molecules, the MHC of Gnathostomata evolved into a region of considerable heterogeneity in its organization, number, and extent of polymorphism both within and between species [3] [4] [5] . Spanning approximately 4 megabases (Mb), the MHC region consists of hundreds of different genes with a variety of functions including antigen presentation and processing as well as non-immune processes [1] . Consequently, MHC class I and class II genes are amongst the most polymorphic genes studied in vertebrates with more than 100 alleles reported in different species, including humans [6, 7] . In MHC class II genes, a majority of the functionally important polymorphisms are concentrated in exon 2, which encodes the antigen-binding site of the molecule [8, 9] . This diversity is correlated with pathogen richness [10] .",

Currently, three extant species of Old World camels are recognized [14] [15] [16] . The dromedary (Camelus dromedarius) and Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) are key domestic species in semi-arid and desert areas and are used for food production and camel racing throughout many Arabian, Northern African and Asian countries. The only surviving and critically endangered wild camel species (Camelus ferus) is closely related to them and diverged from the domestic Bactrian camel approximately 1,000,000 years ago [14, 15] .",

Camel-specific primers were designed using the Primer3 software [34] . For this purpose, species-and locus-specific regions were identified by BLAST [33] search of bovine DRA, DRB, DQA, and DQB, exon 2 sequences against the wild Bactrian camel draft genome assembly [16] . This approach was successful for all loci except DQB, because no DQBlike sequences were found in the draft genomes available. In a second step, based on the camel-specific sequences retrieved during the first round of amplifications, primers located in the neighboring introns and amplifying the fulllength exon 2 sequences could be designed. In addition, we developed a set of primers specific for each locus separately to check possible allelic dropouts ( Table 3) . As for DQB, attempts to use bovine primers DQB-LA40, DQB-LA41 and DQB-LA48 [35] failed. Eventually, the zoo-primers GH28 and GH29 amplifying DQB exon 2 in various mammalian species were used successfully [36] . All primer sequences and resulting PCR product lengths are summarized in Table 3 . The PCR reactions were performed in a reaction volume of 12.5 \u03bcl containing 50 \u03bcg/ml of DNA, 1x KAPA2G Buffer A (with MgCl 2 ), 1x KAPA Enhancer 1, 0.2 mM of each dNTPs, 0.5 \u03bcM of forward and reverse primer and 0.5 U of KAPA2G Robust HotStart DNA Polymerase (Kapa Biosystems, USA). Negative controls were included in each PCR. Amplified PCR products were purified with ExoSAP-IT using standard protocol (Affymetrix, USA) and subjected to Sanger sequencing (Macrogen Europe, the Netherlands). Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used for a subset of samples (n = 20) as a part of our task to have all variants confirmed based on at least two independent PCRs. For the remaining samples, Sanger data available allowed the confirmation. Two platforms, Roche GS Junior or Illumina MiSeq were used according to standard protocols.",

The amplification programme consisted of initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 9 min followed by 60 cycles (94\u00b0C for 20 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 30 s) and a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 4 min. The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced in both directions on ABI 3730 XL-Analyzer (Eurofins MWG GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany). Each sequence position was determined from two independent PCR amplifications in both directions to avoid sequence errors caused by template damage. The MHC sequences obtained from the ancient samples were aligned to the MHC DQA exon 2 [Gen-Bank: AGVR01020882.1|:14962-15210] and DRA exon 2 [GenBank: AGVR01020883.1|:30918-31163] reference sequences using CodonCode Aligner v.3.7.1.2 (Codon Code Corporation, USA) and compared to the NCBI nucleotide database sequences, using the BLAST [33] with default blastn parameters.",

Our results indicated that the MHC region of these three species is structurally similar to that of New World camelids (llamas) and of bovids. These results are in agreement with data previously reported for llamas [32, 57] . A combination of different techniques was necessary to recapitulate the MHC organization. We have shown that even whole genome sequences with coverage 65x could not provide complete information on the MHC region in camelids and confirmed that targeted re-sequencing is needed to resolve the complexity of this region. New techniques, like long-read NGS, are needed to further characterize this important genomic region. FISH analysis located the MHC region on the short arm of chromosome 20 in dromedaries. Taking into consideration the high similarities between camelid genomes and karyotypes in general, we may assume that chromosomes Cba 20 and Cfe 20 carry the MHC in the other two species as well. The structure of the entire chromosome is evolutionary conserved between camelids and bovids and these chromosomes are homologous to the MHC-carrying llama and bovine chromosomes LPA20 and Bta 23, respectively [32, 55] . The MHC of camels is similar to the MHC of cattle and other bovids not only in terms of their physical location, but also of their genetic structure. The order and orientation of the three major regions, i.e. centromereclass IIclass III and class I as inferred from the WGS [25] were directly visualized by the FISH (Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "MHC class II genes are highly variable between different species due to differences in numbers of genes evolved by duplications as well as in the extent of polymorphism between individual genes [59, 60] . Intraspecific variation may be due not only to high numbers of genes and alleles, but also to variation in gene number among individual haplotypes observed in different species, including cattle [61] . It was therefore surprising to observe low variability in the MHC class II exon 2 genomic sequences in the three camelid species. Low numbers of alleles and high numbers of homozygotes in all loci, and many alleles shared across species substantially differ from most other mammalian species with tens or even hundreds of alleles and a high degree of heterozygosity [7] . Based on our observations, we extended the numbers of animals analyzed making sure that the camels studied originated from all major regions in the world (see Additional file 1). Three approaches (Sanger, NGS, cloning) were used to confirm the sequences retrieved and different primer pairs spanning overlapping regions were used to minimize allelic drop-outs. In addition, zoo-primers amplifying canonical MHC class II loci in other species were used. All these approaches produced similar results. The extent of allelic variation identified in groups of animals comparable to studies of other mammalian models seems to be unusually low in this particular family. We only can speculate whether there is another methodological limitation, which avoided us to assess the entire range of existing variation or whether there are reasons related to the biology of this family. Our data did not provide information about the extent of genetic variation in other MHC genes, especially in the class I loci. Lower MHC variation in different species is usually associated with (i) bottlenecks or reduced sizes of specific populations [62] , (ii) pathogen-poor environment [63] , (iii) particular traits of social interactions such as monogamy combined with small population numbers and low reproduction rate [64] , or (iv) limited chance for lateral pathogen transmission [65] . Out of these, the pathogen poor environment is an attractive hypothesis. We observed a lower overall genomic heterozygosity in dromedaries compared to domestic and wild Bactrian camels, which could hint to a generally lower genetic diversity in dromedaries (Fitak et al. in prep) . However, for the MHC region, the low level of genetic diversity was observed in all three species.",

In cattle, variation in the number of DQA genes among individual haplotypes were reported [71] [72] [73] . Our in silico search of the camelid genomes revealed two possible DQA loci. However, the lower scoring locus seems to be a non-functional copy, as no other MHC genes could be found within the same scaffold (data not shown). Although several SNPs allowing multiple haplotype combinations were observed in the camel exon 2 DQA nucleotide sequences, only three allelic haplotypes were observed, two of them shared by all three camel species although with different frequencies ( Table 5 ). The DQA sequences were also highly similar to human sequences (0.843 and 0.780 for nucleotide and peptide sequences, respectively), and in contrast to the DR loci, they showed high similarities with their cattle and pig orthologues ( Table 7) .",

For this reason probably, the camel whole genome sequences published so far do not contain this region. The fact that we were unable to amplify full-length exon 2 sequences by using several pairs of DQB zoo-primers (human, cattle, equine) and that even high-coverage whole genome sequencing and/or NGS did not allow resolving the organization of the DQB region, is in agreement with this assumption. In this situation, we had to use the zooprimers GH 28 and 29, shown previously to amplify exon 2 DQB sequences from at least two loci of multiple mammalian species [36, 74] . The partial DQB exon 2 sequences obtained here contained high numbers of SNPs, with many non-synonymous substitutions. However, they showed the same patterns like the DQA locus, with very few individual haplotypes. As the DQB sequences obtained here are truncated, some additional variation may exist in these putative loci. A unique feature of the DQB exon 2 sequences is the 12 bp insertion not observed in other mammalian species. Based on in silico translation, the putative polypeptide may be fully functional.",

Analyses of MHC genes from ancient domestic animal specimens thus can help to elucidate the historical events occurring during the domestication process. Most ancient DNA studies in domestic animals relied on mtDNA due to general difficulties associated with the recovery of nuclear DNA (nuDNA) from archaeozoological materials. Despite their importance, there have been no studies of ancient immune genes and their role in domestication and adaptation in livestock to date. This dataset represents the first MHC sequences retrieved from ancient camel specimens from hot and arid environments, which are notoriously the most unfavorable for the survival of DNA [76] . Although fragmentary at this stage, the data showed that some DRA haplotypes have been maintained over time. The three extra C/T substitutions observed in AQ30 still need to be validated as true polymorphisms in additional (historical) samples, rather than representing ancient DNA damage commonly observed as C to T (complementary G to A) change resulting from post-mortem cytosine deamination [77] .",

We described ancient variation at the DRA locus, monomorphic in most species. The extent of molecular diversity of MHC class II genes seems to be substantially lower in Old World camels than in other mammalian species. The major part of the diversity could reside in the complex DQB region, which was difficult to resolve and remained unannotated in the whole genome sequences.",
