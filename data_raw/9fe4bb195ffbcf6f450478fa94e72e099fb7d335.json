Methods: Clinical specimens, including throat swabs, sputum or tracheal aspirates, etc., were obtained from patients exhibiting influenza-like illness (ILIs), especially from those having pneumonia and a history of occupational exposure to poultry and wild birds. RNA was extracted from these samples and a multiplex one-step real-time RT-PCR assay was developed to specifically detect the influenza A virus (FluA). PCR primers targeted the conserved M and Rnase P (RP) genes, as well as the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the H7N9 virus.",

Positive detection of the H7N9 virus in sputum/tracheal aspirates was higher than in throat swabs during the surveillance of patients with ILIs. Additionally, detection of the matrix (M) and Rnase P genes aided in the determination of the novel avian H7N9 virus and ensured the quality of the clinical samples.",

FluA is further classified on the basis of two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) [1, 2] . All subtypes of FluA comprise various combinations of the H and N glycoproteins. Sixteen H subtypes (H1-H16) and nine N subtypes (N1-N9) have been characterized in avian species, while the H17N10 subtype is found in bats [3, 4] . Most subtypes of FluA virus such as H5 and H7 subtypes are not pathogenic in poultry, but outbreaks in poultry and wild birds are correlated with the highly virulent FluA virus, which can cause severe economic losses owing to massive numbers of deaths of domestic poultry [4] [5] [6] .",

The primers and probes for the H7 and N9 genes were designed within certain regions of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes that are relatively conserved among all H7N9 subtypes, thus allowing the detection of all human and avian H7N9 viruses.

Interestingly, the same detection limits were found for FluA, CNIC-H7 and CNIC-N9 assays in a previous study [13, 14] . Similarly, the specificity of the multiplex assay was evaluated individually using H7N9 virus culture and RNA transcripts. With respect to specificity, the multiplex assay detected the novel H7N9 virus, the FluA (H1N1 and H3N2) viruses and the novel influenza A H1N1 (2009) virus, and no cross-reactions were observed with the panel comprising 21 other respiratory pathogens or commensals.

            "text": "In March 2013, the novel reassortant avian influenza A (H7N9) virus firstly occurred in three persons in Shanghai of China, and then more and more peoples were killed by the novel virus that had been found in ducks, chickens and birds. Until Jul 31, 2014, 413 infections and 157 deaths by the novel H7N9 virus were reported in China. Additionally, several family clusters of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infection were reported during the outbreak of this virus in China [12] . Most of the cases of novel avian H7N9 infections reported were virulent, and the deaths resulted from the rapid development of severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [11, 12, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Tissue culture is the \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. However, PCR is significantly more sensitive and highly specific for the detection of respiratory viruses. Therefore, research into PCR techniques for detecting viral infections is conducted in many laboratories [1, 2] . There is an urgent need to develop a rapid and specific molecular test for the early detection and confirmation of the novel avian influenza A (H7N9) virus. In the earlier periods of the outbreaks of this virus, one real-time RT-PCR method, recommended by the WHO, was promptly announced for the detection of novel influenza A (H7N9) viruses [13] . Subsequently, additional real-time RT-PCR methods for the detection of avian influenza A (H7N0) were published as the virus emerged in China [14, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . These methods were only applied to the analysis of the H7 and N9 genes of the H7N9 virus and did not include the M gene, which aids in the determination of novel H7N9 viruses. Nor did they use the RP gene, which can be used as a control to monitor the quality of clinical samples to ensure accurate results [1, 2] . Additionally, the sequences of the primers recommended by the WHO contained slight discrepancies from those found in publicly available gene databases of novel H7N9 viruses isolated from human cases. Thus, the M, H, and N primer sets in the WHO protocol do not exactly match the sequences of the novel H7N9 virus (Table 1 ) [13] . For example, the 6th base of the FluA reverse primer was changed from \"G\" to \"A\", the 3rd base of the H7 reverse primer was altered from \"C\" to \"T\", and the 2nd and 23rd bases of the N9 forward primer and the 19th base of the N9 reverse primer were altered from \"T\" to \"G\", \"T\" to \"G\", and \"A\" to \"G\", respectively, relative to the novel H7N9 sequences. These errors may adversely affect viral detection in clinical specimens. Therefore, the nucleotide sequences of primers and probes should be modified according to the variation of novel influenza virus H7N9 sequences.",

The H7 and N9 primers and probes exactly match the sequences of the novel high virulent H7N9 virus for humans and low pathogenic avian H7N9 virus, and the FluA primers and probes completely match the M gene of most FluA viruses using base degeneracy rules (Table 1) . For example, the 6th base of the H7 forward primer and 15th base of the H7 reverse primer are \"R\", indicating \"A\" or \"G\", and the 5th, 23rd and 26th bases of the H7 probe are \"R\", \"Y\" and \"Y\", which indicate \"A\" or \"G\", \"C\" or \"T\" and \"C\" or \"T\", respectively. These changes contribute to the reliable detection of the virus by a PCR assay.",

The Ct values for the amplification of the H7, N9, and FluA genes were generally uniform in the multiplex assay, and were similar to the Ct values of the CNIC H7 and CNIC FluA primers used in the WHO protocol.

The positive results of the multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay were generally in accordance with that of the real-time RT-PCR assay in the WHO protocol. As previously noted, the Ct values for the amplification of the H7, N9, FluA and RP genes in the two assays were generally similar. In an addition, the Ct values for RP gene assessed by both assays were low with 18.5 to 29.8 in these clinical specimens, which indicated good qualities of clinical specimens. A reliable quality of clinical specimens is important for the determination of the result, and negative result of it has an effect on the assay of objective result in some clinical specimens. Interestingly, the WHO protocol resulted in three indeterminate results with respect to the detection of the N9 gene. These samples were subsequently considered positive based on genomic DNA sequencing, and samples of the three cases were positive when the sputum was re-collected and re-tested, respectively, so that their mischaracterization was factored into the sensitivity and specificity calculations. We suggest that the use of mismatched primers and probes, as well as extremely low viral concentrations, may have led to this discrepancy. The samples of uncertain results should be re-collected and re-tested, which were significant for the determination of the results.",

The results showed that the multiplex assay and the WHO-recommended assays did not significantly differ in their ability to detect H7N9 viruses; only one positive fecal sample detected by the multiplex assay was negative using the WHO protocol. Remarkably, the percentage of positive sputum or tracheal aspirate specimens (100%) was higher than that of the throat swabs samples (71.43%) on the first day after hospital admission, and the average number of days that patients' sputum or tracheal aspirate samples tested positive for H7N9 viruses (mean value =6.14 days) was significantly greater than that of the patients' throat swabs samples (mean value =2.42 days). This may result from the ability of the novel reassortant H7N9 virus to easily infect human lung tissue, which leads to severe pneumonia [10, 11, [15] [16] [17] [18] .
