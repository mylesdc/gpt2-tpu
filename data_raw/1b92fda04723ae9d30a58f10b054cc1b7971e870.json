            "text": "During a comparison of the infectivity of mNDK, a CD4-independent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain, to various cell lines, we found that HeLa cells were much less susceptible than 293T and TE671 cells. Hybridoma cells between HeLa and 293T cells were as susceptible as 293T cells, suggesting that cellular factors enhance the mNDK infection in 293T cells. By screening a cDNA expression library in HeLa cells, cystatin C was isolated as an enhancer of the mNDK infection. Because cathepsin B protease, a natural ligand of cystatin C, was upregulated in HeLa cells, we speculated that the high levels of cathepsin B activities were inhibitory to the CD4-independent infection and that cystatin C enhanced the infection by impairing the excessive cathepsin B activity. Consistent with this idea, pretreatment of HeLa cells with 125 mM of CA-074Me, a cathepsin B inhibitor, resulted in an 8-fold enhancement of the mNDK infectivity. Because cathepsin B is activated by low pH in acidic endosomes, we further examined the potential roles of endosomes in the CD4-independent infection. Suppression of endosome acidification or endocytosis by inhibitors or by an Eps15 dominant negative mutant reduced the infectivity of mNDK in which CD4-dependent infections were not significantly impaired. Taken together, these results suggest that endocytosis, endosomal acidification, and cathepsin B activity are involved in the CD4-independent entry of HIV-1.",

This process is generally initiated by binding of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 to CD4 on the host cell surface. The binding then induces conformational changes of the gp120, which allows the gp120 to interact with a cellular surface chemokine receptor, termed coreceptor [1] . HIV-1 can use many types of chemokine receptors as the coreceptors [2] , but the two most common types of coreceptors for HIV-1 entry are CXCR4 and CCR5.",

Gp120 coreceptor binding sites of CD4-independent HIV-1 variants are exposed before the CD4 binding, and the CD4-independent gp120 directly interacts with the coreceptor for the entry [5] . It has been reported that CD4negative cells such as liver, kidney, and CD8+ T cells are infected with the CD4-independent HIV-1 in AIDS patients, and such CD4independent variants are thought to be associated with hepatitis, nephropathy, and CD8+ T cell dysfunction in AIDS patients [6, 8, 9, 10] . Almost all simple retroviruses, including murine leukemia viruses (MLVs), recognize multiple membrane-spanning proteins as the HIV-1 coreceptors. CD4-independent variants of simian immunodeficiency virus have been isolated more frequently than CD4-independent HIV-1 [11, 12] . HIV-1 variants that recognize CD4 as a sole receptor have not been isolated. These results suggest that CD4-independent HIV-1 variants are prototypes of CD4-dependent strains.",

It has recently been reported that inhibitors of endosomal cathepsin proteases attenuate ecotropic MLV infection [19, 20] . These results indicate that the entry of these retroviruses occurs through acidic late endosomes and requires endosomal cathepsin proteases, such as Ebola virus, reovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and coronavirus [21, 22, 23, 24] . Because cathepsin proteases are activated by low pH in acidic endosomes, the endosome acidification inhibitors might attenuate the virus infections by suppressing cathepsin protease activation. However, the endosome acidification inhibitors do not suppress CD4dependent HIV-1 infections, but rather enhance them [25] . Therefore, the CD4-dependent HIV-1 entry likely occurs at the host cell surface, but not through endosomes. However, it has recently been shown that CD4-dependent HIV-1 enters into host cells via endosomes [26, 27] . Due to these conflicting observations, it is unclear whether the CD4-dependent HIV-1 entry occurs through endosomes or through direct fusion at the cell surface membrane.",

We aimed to identify the cellular factor by screening of a cDNA expression library prepared from human lymph nodes. Cystatin C, which inhibits cystein cathepsin proteases, was isolated as an enhancer of the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection in HeLa cells. A synthetic cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074Me, also enhanced the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection in HeLa cells, but did not affect the CD4-dependent infection. These results show that cathepsin B inhibits the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection. Because cathepsin proteases are activated by low pH in acidic late endosomes, the CD4-independent mNDK infection might occur through endosomes. Inhibitors of endosome acidification or endocytosis significantly attenuated the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection, but not the CD4-dependent infection, as expected. These results suggest that the CD4independent HIV-1 enters through acidic late endosomes but the CD4-dependent HIV-1 does not.",

HeLa cells expressing cystatin C were about 3 times more susceptible to the mNDK vector infection than control HeLa cells transduced by the empty MLV vector (Fig. 3A , upper panels). Cystatin C expression also enhanced the CD4-dependent infection, but the effect on the CD4-dependent infection was less than that on the CD4-independent infection. Cystatin C protein expression in these transduced cells was confirmed by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 3A , lower panels). Cystatin C expression resulted in a 1.5-fold enhancement of the susceptibility of TE671 cells to the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection, but did not affect the susceptibility of TE671/CD4 cells. Cystatin C expression did not affect the mNDK vector infection in CD4negative and -positive 293T cells. Cystatin C did not affect the cell surface expression of CXCR4 in HeLa cells (Fig. 3B) , indicating that cystatin C does not increase the CD4-independent vector infection by enhancing CXCR4 expression.

Target cells were pretreated with cathepsin inhibitors for 5 h. As expected, when HeLa cells were treated with a specific cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074Me, at 125 mM, the transduction titer of the mNDK vector was increased 8-fold (Fig. 5A) . Similarly, CA-074Me treatment of TE671 cells at 50 mM induced a 5-fold enhancement of the CD4-independent infection. In association with this change, cathepsin B activity was indeed reduced by these CA-074Me treatments in HeLa and TE671 cells to about 50%, a level similar to that in the control 293T cells (Fig. 4B ). These results indicate that cathepsin B inhibition by cystatin C or CA-074Me leads to enhancement of the CD4-independent vector infection, suggesting that cathepsin B plays a role in suppressing the CD4-independent HIV-1 infection in HeLa and TE671 cells, which express cathepsin B at a relatively higher level.",

To further confirm the result, susceptibility to the CD4-independent infection and cathepsin B activity of other two cell lines, SAOS-2 and C33A cells, were measured. Surprisingly, mNDK vector-infected cells were not detected in SAOS-2 cells (Fig. 6A ). Cathepsin B activity of SAOS-2 cells was higher than that of HeLa cells (Fig. 6B) , and CA-074Me treatment conferred SAOS-2 cells susceptible to the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection (Fig. 6C) , suggesting that SAOS-2 cells are completely resistant to the CD4-independent infection due to the high level of cathepsin B activity. However, because SAOS-2 cells were less susceptible to the VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-1 vector infection than 293T cells (Fig. 6A) , the infection resistance of SAOS-2 cells is likely to involve postentry mechanisms either. C33A cells were as susceptible to the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection as TE671 cells, and have similar level of cathepsin B activity to TE671 cells (Figs. 6A and B). CA-074Me treatment of C33A cells at 50 mM enhanced the CD4-independent infection about 5 times, like TE671 cells (Fig. 6D ). Statistical analysis reveals that susceptibility to the CD4independent mNDK vector infection was reverse-correlated with cathepsin B activity of the target cells (Fig. 6E ). These results strongly support the conclusion that cathepsin B is one of the critical cellular factors determining susceptibility to the CD4independent HIV-1 infection. ",

In contrast, the CD4-dependent HXB2 (Fig. 9 ) and mNDK vector (data not shown) infections were not inhibited by these inhibitors in CD4-expressing cells, and were actually increased in TE671 and HeLa cells, as previously reported [25] .

The chloroquine treatment of cells reduced cathepsin B activity of cell lysates prepared from the treated cells (Fig. 9D left panel) . However, when chloroquine was added to the cell lysates, their cathesin B activities were not reduced (Fig. 9D right  panel) . Because cathepsin proteases are activated by endosome acidification, the endosome acidification inhibitor treatment of cells suppresses cathepsin B activation, but not cathepsin activity. Treatments with these inhibitors did not reduce the cell surface expression of CXCR4 (Fig. 9E) , indicating that abrogation of the CD4independent infection by the endosome acidification inhibitors is not due to the suppression of CXCR4 expression.

To assess this hypothesis, the effects of endocytosis inhibitors, dynasore or an Eps15 dominant negative mutant (Eps15-DN) [37, 38] , on the CD4-independent and -dependent HIV-1 vector infections were analyzed. Target cells were pretreated with dynasore for 5 h. Dynasore inhibits dynamine GTPase and clathrin-dependent endocytosis [39] . Dynasore treatment more efficiently attenuated the CD4-independent mNDK vector infection than the CD4dependent mNDK (Fig. 10A ) or HXB2 (data not shown) vector infection in all examined cells (P,0.05). The dynasore treatment did not affect the cell surface expression of CXCR4 (Fig. 10B) , demonstrating that dynasore treatment attenuated the CD4independent HIV-1 infection through a mechanism other than the suppression of CXCR4 expression. The dynasore treatment of target cells moderately attenuated cathepsin B activity (Fig. 10C left  panel) . However, when dynasore was added to cell lysates, the cathepsin B activity was not affected (Fig. 10C right panel) . Inhibition of endocytosis by dynasore might suppress cathepsin B activity by reducing number of endosomes in the treated cells, because active cathepsin B is present in late endosomes. The dynasore treatment inhibited endocytosis of Cy3-conjugated transferin as expected (Fig. 10D) . However, the chloroquine or CA-074Me treatment did not. This result suggests that the chloroquine or CA-074Me treatment inhibits the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection by a mechanism other than endocytosis suppression.",

Cathepsin B activity was inversely correlated with cellular susceptibility to the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection. Overexpression of cathepsin B attenuated the CD4independent vector infection in 293T cells. The TLR4 signal activation also attenuated the CD4-independent vector infection by enhancing cathepsin B expression. These results indicate that cathepsin B is one of the host innate immune factors resisting to the CD4-independent HIV-1 infection. The endocytosis inhibitors, dynasore and Eps15-DN, suppressed the CD4-independent HIV-1 vector infection, showing that the CD4-independent infection occurs through endosomes. The mechanism by which cathepsin B inhibits the CD4-independent infection is suggested as follows; higher cathepsin B protease activity in SAOS-2, HeLa, and TE671 cells causes degradation of the HIV-1 particles in acidic endosomes, attenuating the CD4-independent HIV-1 infection (Fig. 13) . Inhibition of cathepsin B by the cystatin C expression or by the CA-074Me treatment increases the CD4-independent infection by suppressing the viral particle degradation.",

Another cystatin member, cystatin B, has been reported to be associated with higher susceptibility of monocyte-derived macrophages to CD4-dependent HIV-1 infection when compared to placental macrophages [41] . Because cystatin B is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, while cystatin C is generally located in late endosomes [42] or secreted, and because cystatin C did not affect the CD4-dependent HIV-1 infection in our study, the roles of cystatins B and C in HIV-1 infection should be different.",

This strongly indicates that the CD4-independent HIV-1 infection occurs through acidic endosomes, as in the case of other retroviruses (Fig. 13 ). In contrast, the inhibitors less efficiently attenuated the CD4-dependent HIV-1 vector infection than the CD4-independent infection, as they did in a previous report [25] , suggesting that the CD4-dependent infection does not occur through acidic endosomes. However, Miyauchi et al. recently reported that CD4-dependent HIV-1 enters host cells via endosomes [26, 27] . The CD4-dependent HIV-1 particles might be internalized by dynamin-independent endocytosis. Even if the CD4-dependent HIV-1 particles are internalized into endosomes for productive infection, the CD4-dependent HIV-1 entry might occur before HIV-1 particle-bearing endosomes become acidic in late endosomes (Fig. 13) . Further studies are needed to clarify this issue.",

Endosomal cathepsin proteases degrade microbes invading into host cells, and generate peptide presented on MHC class II in order to protect the host against the microbes [44] . In this context, it is interesting that several microbes encode cathepsin protease inhibitors homologous to the cystatin family [45, 46, 47] . Such microbial cystatins inhibit the host innate and adaptive immunity mediated by cathepsin proteases to allow efficient microbe proliferation in infected animals. The endocytic infection route of retroviruses might be changed to a cell surface infection route to escape from the host immunity mediated by endosomal cathepsin proteases, instead of having a cathepsin inhibitor.",

The HIV-1 particles could be degraded predominantly by cathepsin B after the viral particles are internalized into endosomes, reducing the CD4-independent infection. Additionally, in this study, it was speculated that the CD4-dependent HIV-1 entry into host cells does not occur through acidic endosomes. Even when the CD4-dependent HIV-1 particles are internalized to endosomes, the viral entry might occur before the HIV-1 virion-containing endosomes have become acidic. Comparative studies between CD4-dependent and -independent HIV-1 infections will pave the way to clarification of the novel mechanisms that have not been disclosed using only CD4-dependent HIV-1, as we have already reported [28, 48] .",
