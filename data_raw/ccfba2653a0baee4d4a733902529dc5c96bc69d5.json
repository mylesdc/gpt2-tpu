            "text": "Although metagenomics has been previously employed for pathogen discovery, its cost and complexity have prevented its use as a practical front-line diagnostic for unknown infectious diseases. Here we demonstrate the utility of two metagenomics-based strategies, a pan-viral microarray (Virochip) and deep sequencing, for the identification and characterization of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus. Using nasopharyngeal swabs collected during the earliest stages of the pandemic in Mexico, Canada, and the United States (n = 17), the Virochip was able to detect a novel virus most closely related to swine influenza viruses without a priori information. Deep sequencing yielded reads corresponding to 2009 H1N1 influenza in each sample (percentage of aligned sequences corresponding to 2009 H1N1 ranging from 0.0011% to 10.9%), with up to 97% coverage of the influenza genome in one sample. Detection of 2009 H1N1 by deep sequencing was possible even at titers near the limits of detection for specific RT-PCR, and the percentage of sequence reads was linearly correlated with virus titer. Deep sequencing also provided insights into the upper respiratory microbiota and host gene expression in response to 2009 H1N1 infection. An unbiased analysis combining sequence data from all 17 outbreak samples revealed that 90% of the 2009 H1N1 genome could be assembled de novo without the use of any reference sequence, including assembly of several near full-length genomic segments. These results indicate that a streamlined metagenomics detection strategy can potentially replace the multiple conventional diagnostic tests required to investigate an outbreak of a novel pathogen, and provide a blueprint for comprehensive diagnosis of unexplained acute illnesses or outbreaks in clinical and public health settings.",

Rapid point-of-care diagnostics were insensitive for diagnosing the novel virus, and while existing molecular methods such as RT-PCR were able to detect influenza, they could not differentiate 2009 H1N1 from seasonal H3N2 or H1N1 infection [4] . Initial efforts to characterize the virus relied on traditional Sanger sequencing and the use of PCR primers to highly conserved regions in the influenza genome, methods that would likely have failed had the virus been more genetically divergent [1, 2] . No clinical or laboratory test was initially available to identify 2009 H1N1 with high sensitivity and specificity, and the virus may have circulated undetected in the human population for months [5] . Thus, there is a clear need for the introduction of broad-range viral detection methodologies into clinical and public health settings to deal with emerging threats such as 2009 H1N1 influenza.",

The Virochip is a pan-viral microarray that is designed to simultaneously detect all known viruses [7, 8] . Novel viral species or strains can also be detected on the basis of conserved sequence homology to known viruses, as demonstrated by the discovery of the SARS coronavirus by Virochip in 2003 [9, 10] . Other novel viruses previously identified by Virochip include a new clade of rhinoviruses [11] , a human cardiovirus associated with respiratory and diarrheal illness [12] , and avian bornavirus, the etiologic agent of outbreaks of proventricular dilation disease (PDD) in birds [13, 14] . For detection of known respiratory viruses, the Virochip microarray was found to have a sensitivity and specificity comparable to or superior to conventional diagnostic testing [11, 15] . Deep sequencing is a complementary approach capable of detecting viruses that are too divergent from known viruses to be detected by either PCR or microarray techniques [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] ; reviewed in [6] . De novo pyrosequencing has enabled the discovery of two novel arenaviruses, an arenavirus associated with a fatal cluster of cases in solid-organ transplant patients (Dandenong virus) [22] , and a hemorrhagic feverassociated arenavirus from South Africa (Lujo virus) [21] .",

Seventeen samples from Mexico (n = 5), Canada (n = 9), and the United States (California) (n = 3) were suspected or PCR-confirmed cases of H1N1 infection. The remaining control samples, all from California, were positive for H1N1 seasonal influenza (n = 2), H3N2 seasonal influenza (n = 3), another respiratory virus (n = 6), or negative by all diagnostic testing (n = 1). Of note, the probes on the Virochip were designed prior to the emergence of pandemic 2009 H1N1. Virochip hybridization patterns corresponding to 15 of 17 samples suspected or confirmed positive for 2009 H1N1 grouped together by hierarchical cluster analysis, and were clearly distinguishable from patterns corresponding to seasonal H3N2 influenza virus ( Fig. 2A) . Two of the 17 samples, Mex-1225 and Mex-730, exhibited very weak microarray probe intensities on Virochip analysis and were grouped with the negative control samples. The finding of weak Virochip intensities for these two samples was reproducible, and likely secondary to low viral titers and/or high background from host nucleic acid which can interfere with the random PCR amplification step of Virochip analysis [8, 15] . The average normalized microarray intensities for the 2009 H1N1 samples were more pronounced with H1N1 probes derived from swine influenza (A/swine/Wisconsin/464/98) than with probes derived from human influenza (A/human/Puerto Rico/8/34); the difference was statistically significant for 13 of 17 samples by t-test analysis (Fig. 2B) . Microarrays corresponding to seasonal H1N1 influenza displayed the opposite pattern, with H1N1 probes derived from human influenza stronger in intensity than those derived from swine influenza. Minimal cross-hybridization in influenza A probes was observed with samples either negative or harboring other respiratory viruses. The Virochip microarray was also analyzed using Z-score analysis and E-Predict, an automated method for viral species identification in microarrays [7, 35] . Both methods incorporate information from all of the oligonucleotide probes on the Virochip simultaneously, including probes to the full range of influenza strains, and revealed that a virus most similar to swine influenza A (A/swine/Wisconsin/464/98) was present in these samples (data not shown). Thus, the Virochip detected the presence of a virus most closely related to swine influenza A/ H1N1 in samples from individuals infected with 2009 H1N1.",

Approximately 85% of reads from sample BC-59 aligned to bacterial sequences, mostly corresponding to the Streptococcus genus.

Given the high degree of conservation of rRNA sequences in bacteria, each read could only be unambiguously classified at the genus level (or at the family level in the case of Enterobactericeae) (Fig. 4) . In general, a high level of diversity of bacterial families was observed in different samples, reflecting the known diversity of bacterial flora in the nasopharynx [37] . Reads to the top three bacterial families comprised anywhere from 22 to 97% of all bacterial reads, depending on the sample (Fig. 4A ). Moraxellaceae or Enterobactericeae were the most common bacterial families found, accounting for one of the three most common bacterial families in 14 of 17 samples (Fig. 4B ).

In total, there were 30 nonambiguous nucleotide differences between BC-22 and the original California strain and 39 nonambiguous nucleotide differences between Cal-UC2 and the original strain, of which 80% and 85% were detected by Sanger sequencing and 77% and 72% by deep sequencing alone, respectively. These nucleotide differences corresponded to 12 and 18 nonsynonymous mutations in the BC-22 and Cal-UC2 genomes, respectively. The genome segment with the most amino acid changes was the HA gene (27 of 69 nucleotide differences, or 39.1%). For both BC-22 and Cal-UC2, there were no differences from the reference sequence A/California/06/2009(H1N1) at key sites in the genome corresponding to known mutations for antiviral resistance, enhanced transmission, or increased virulence. database in these 12 samples were considered to arise from mRNA transcripts. Since no RNA-seq data corresponding to nasopharyngeal samples from healthy individuals can be found in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.inh.gov/sra), we used a set of nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from 11 Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) patients with influenza-like illness but testing negative for influenza as background controls. Genes associated with immunity and interferon were significantly upregulated (p,0.05) in four of the 12 influenza samples as compared to the control samples, and from two study sites with different specimen processing protocols (Fig. 7A ).

Upregulation of interferon and immunity genes was seen in the four samples with the highest 1X coverage of the influenza genome but not necessarily in samples with a high number of total transcriptome reads (Fig. 7B ).

To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in elucidating the cause of outbreaks from hitherto novel or unknown viruses, we generated a modified NT database from which all sequences corresponding to the Orthomyxoviridae family had been removed (Fig. 8A) . Pure de novo assemblies of paired-end reads pooled from all 17 2009 H1N1 samples which did not align to the modified NT database were then constructed using Geneious software (Geneious, Auckland, NZ). Of the 582 final contigs (contiguous sequences) of length greater than 100 bp generated from the de novo assembly, 21 contigs mapped onto a reference sequence of 2009 H1N1 influenza, with an N50 contig size of 1,167 bp and coverage of 89.5% of the genome (Fig. 8B) . The four longest contigs all corresponded to 2009 H1N1 and included the nearly full-length sequences of the PB1 (polymerase), NP (nucleoprotein) and NA (neuraminidase) segments (Fig. 8C) . A cursory analysis of the remaining 561 contigs that did not map to the influenza genome revealed that ,90% of these sequences were low-complexity sequencing artifacts. From a similar analysis performed on the best single sample (BC-22), de novo assembly of 90.3% of the genome was possible. No misassemblies were observed even though the percentage of Orthomyxoviridae reads from all 17 H1N1 samples or BC-22 alone comprised only 7.6% or 2.6% of the corresponding unaligned reads to the modified NT database, respectively.",

The Virochip was capable of differentiating seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 influenza from the novel 2009 pandemic strain by the use of multiple probes designed a priori, and accurately characterized the novel virus as closely related to swine influenza viruses. Complementary deep sequencing of 17 clinical samples collected early in the course of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic enabled detection of reads to the novel strain in every sample, as well as de novo assembly of ,90% of the genome amidst an enormous background of unaligned sequence reads. As with the SARS coronavirus, the lack of a broad-based diagnostic test that was sufficiently sensitive and specific likely contributed to the delayed identification of 2009 H1N1 as the cause of an initial outbreak of influenza-like illness in Mexico. Our approach -using the Virochip microarray for rapid screening and deep sequencing for de novo assembly and more detailed characterization -is robust, comprehensive, and directly applicable for the investigation of future outbreaks from novel viral pathogens, especially those which do not grow in culture. Nearly all previous studies of metagenomic sequencing of viruses from human clinical material for detection and discovery have employed pyrosequencing [6, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 32, 42, 43] . The longer reads from pyrosequencing (250-450 bp) facilitate the assembly of individual reads into contigs, which assists in the classification of reads by homology-based BLAST alignments. Our results suggest, for example, that longer-read sequencing methods such as pyrosequencing may be better suited than Illumina sequencing for identification of bacteria. Accurate discrimination of bacteria at the species (or even genus) level was not possible with short 60-bp Illumina reads (Fig. 4B) , as rRNA sequences corresponding to related bacteria were found to be essentially 100% identical over a 60-bp range. We did not de novo assemble the short Illumina reads aligning to bacterial rRNA into longer, more easily identifiable contigs given the known presence of multiple related bacterial species in the nasopharynx and the very high (and likely) risk of producing misassemblies. On the other hand, a key advantage of Illumina sequencing is the significant increase in read depth (,100-fold) relative to pyrosequencing. The greater depth of sequencing provides better and more accurate genome coverage as well as increased capability to multiplex clinical samples.",

In addition, we were limited by the computational resources required for de novo assembly of ,11.5 million sequences in a reasonable amount of time. Our results demonstrate that a computational pipeline consisting of sequential alignments of individual reads using highstringency cutoffs (Fig. 1) , followed by de novo assembly of the remaining unaligned reads and detailed analysis of the resulting contigs (Fig. 8) , is an efficient strategy for analyzing the large datasets generated by Illumina sequencing of clinical samples and for pathogen discovery. In particular, the final de novo assembly step is critical in identifying divergent sequences that may correspond to novel pathogens. The assembly of longer contigs also eases the burden of computationally intensive amino acid comparison algorithms such as BLASTX, TBLASTX and PHI-BLAST by reducing the number of sequences that need to be analyzed.",

The fewest viral reads were detected in the five samples from Mexico that were not treated with DNase after nucleic acid extraction. These samples contained the highest percentage of human genomic sequence, with over 90% of sequences aligning to the human genome, as well as the fewest reads to bacteria. Nakamura et al. also found .90% host genomic material in nasopharyngeal aspirates from influenzainfected individuals, and detected a similarly low percentage of reads to influenza, despite the use of centrifugation to remove bacterial and cellular material [32] . Our data indicate that one of the most important steps in viral detection by deep sequencing may be the removal of host genomic DNA by post-extraction treatment with DNase -a relatively straightforward procedure for most clinical laboratories. As post-extraction DNAse treatment was not 100% efficient (with the observation of residual DNA mitochondrial reads in several samples), it is true that additional pre-processing by filtration, ultracentrifugation, or density-gradient purification would likely have resulted in even better enrichment of viral sequences [6] . However, for this metagenomics study, we sought to mimic as closely as possible a clinical/public health laboratory setting, and such enrichment strategies may be labor-intensive and neither conducive to the demands of clinical laboratories nor practical given the limited amount of clinical sample available. In addition, an important drawback of directed viral purification methods is that by biasing the sample towards virus detection, they can severely hinder the ability to detect potential non-viral pathogens or investigate patterns of human gene expression in response to viral infection, as we have done here.",

Deep sequencing revealed that only five samples had a significant number of bacterial reads to the Streptococcus genus, which may either represent potential pathogens (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae), or simply normal human nasopharyngeal viral flora (e.g. Streptococcus oralis, sanguis, and/or mitis). One sample from a Canadian patient with an upper respiratory infection from 2009 H1N1 (BC-22) did contain a small number of reads from adenovirus type 4 (n = 26). These results imply that copathogens did not play a significant role in infection by 2009 H1N1 influenza in the 17 samples analyzed.

In addition, one sample (BC-22) contained a paired-end read of 97 nt that was a 98% match to the filovirus Ebola-Sudan. We considered this most likely a laboratory contaminant, since we did not identify any other reads to filoviruses and were unable to amplify additional filovirus sequence from BC-22. However, the origin of this sequence ultimately remains unknown, as we could not subsequently detect it in any sample or reagent by specific RT-PCR, and none of the laboratories involved in the analysis works with Ebola virus. We also found reads corresponding to plant viruses in two samples (BC-76 and Mex-1225). Detection of plant viruses in nasal swab samples is not unexpected given that the nasopharynx is contiguous with the oropharynx, and that an abundance of plant viruses of presumed dietary origin can be found in the human digestive tract [45] . Our discovery of unexpected viral reads corresponding to murine leukemia viruses, filoviruses, and plant viruses in the deep sequencing data underscores the challenges of analyzing rare or unique sequences that may correspond to colonizing flora, reagent/sample contamination, or even true pathogens.",

Since the molecular determinants of influenza pathogenesis have been well-studied, we were able to analyze the genomic sequence for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that specifically correlate with antiviral resistance, enhanced transmission or increased virulence. For a novel virus, where such genotypic findings would not yet be correlated with phenotypic data, the overall sequence and structure of the genome may still yield valuable insights into viral transmission and mechanisms of pathogenesis.",

Interestingly, these 4 samples did not necessarily have a high number of transcriptome reads, but did have the highest 1X coverage of the influenza genome (Fig. 7B) . Coverage of the influenza genome may be the best proxy measure for influenza activity and the associated host response in deep sequencing analysis, as it is relatively independent of PCR duplication artifacts that can be introduced during sample preparation for deep sequencing [46] . Our finding of increased expression of interferon-associated host genes in clinical samples from patients with 2009 H1N1 infection is intriguing and consistent with very recent data showing that the NS1 protein of 2009 H1N1 lacks the ability to block general host gene expression in both human and swine cells in vitro [47] . Further studies are needed to assess the clinical relevance of increased interferon-associated host gene expression in 2009 H1N1 infection in vivo. Nevertheless, this finding highlights the power of an unbiased deep sequencing approach by not only facilitating detection of the viral pathogen but also enabling elements of the host response to be simultaneously interrogated, thus generating new hypotheses for analysis of host-pathogen interactions.",

In samples that are treated with DNase after nucleic acid extraction (''post-DNAse''), there is a linear correlation between percentage of viral reads in the deep sequencing data and viral titers as estimated by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5A ). There is no such observed correlation if samples do not undergo post-DNAse treatment, likely secondary to high residual host genomic background, and thus these findings may only apply to RNA viral targets. However, it is encouraging that sequence reads corresponding to 2009 H1N1 were detectable in all 17 samples, even in those samples with very low viral titers approaching the analytical limits of detection for RT-PCR assays (i.e. Cal-UC12 and BC-59) (Fig. 5B) .",

In addition, although the Virochip microarray has a 12 to 24 hour turnaround time and can be rapidly deployed as a comprehensive screen for viral pathogens in the setting of outbreaks, the complementary deep sequencing approach is currently limited by the time necessary to perform a full pairedend sequencing run on an Illumina Genetic Analyzer IIx (,1 week) and to analyze the data on a highly parallel computational platform running 32 cores simultaneously (,1 week).

First, we selected all genes in RefSeq that were significantly overexpressed in 2009 H1N1 nasopharyngeal swab samples relative to KLS background samples (p,0.05, by Bonferroni-corrected Fisher's Exact Test). To identify overrepresented categories of genes, we inputted the overexpressed RefSeq genes into the PANTHER (Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relations) database (http://panther.appliedbiosystems.com) and compared them to a human reference list of transcribed genes [52] . Categories of genes significantly up-regulated in the influenza data relative to the human reference list (p,0.05, by Bonferroni-corrected Fisher's Exact Test) were reported.",

Both pairedend read information and FASTQ-formatted quality scores were incorporated in the calling of SNPs. SNP calling was performed at very high stringency to ensure accuracy. Specifically, the Illumina deep sequencing data had a calculated overall error rate of ,1% by analysis of the PhiX control lane (Illumina Inc., Hayward, CA), and at least 5-fold coverage and a quality score of 30 were required for mapping of deep sequencing reads at any given position in the genome. A minority SNP was defined as present if occurring $25% of the time at a given nucleotide position.",

Initial generated contigs of size $100 bp were further assembled de novo in Geneious at high sensitivity with ''fine tuning'' of gaps and 3-nt trimming of contig ends. Final de novo assembled contigs were then mapped to the full-genome reference sequence A/California/06/2009(H1N1) (GenBank accession numbers FJ966960 -FJ966965 and FJ971074-FJ971075). Out of the remaining 561 contigs that did not map to influenza, ,90% of the contigs corresponded to low-complexity sequence that was identified as such by applying an LZW compression ratio of 0.5, slightly higher than that used in the initial filtering (0.4).
