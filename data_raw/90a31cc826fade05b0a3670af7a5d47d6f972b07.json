If you're like millions of other people, you might engage in a moment of Internet-enabled selfdiagnosis. You pop your symptoms into a search engine, and in the blink of an eye dozens of health-related websites appear on your screen. That search supplied you with information-some useful and some not-but in today's hyper-connected world, it also supplied a data point for those who survey disease outbreaks by monitoring how people report symptoms via social media. In fact, social media, cell phones, and other communication modes have opened up a two-way street in health research, supplying not just a portal for delivering information to the public but also a channel by which people reveal their concerns, locations, and physical movements from one place to another.",

And at the same time, government officials and institutions at all levels see the data's value and potential. To me, that's very exciting.\"",

The site aggregates those cases on a global map, with outbreaks displayed in real time. Brownstein's team recently launched Outbreaks Near Me, an iPhone application that delivers HealthMap directly to cell-phone users.

The timing of the spike and the search terms used (such as \"Rihanna\" alongside \"flu\") suggest the queries were as much in response to public curiosity as anything else, Fowlkes says. \"The Google Flu Trends system tries to account for that type of media bias by modeling search terms over time to see which ones remain stable,\" she says. Otherwise, it would be vulnerable to \"noisy\" queries (i.e., those that might have nothing to do with changes in disease incidence).",

Therefore, cell phones can track mass movements in which significant departures from the norm might reflect impacts from disease or migrations away from perceived threats. Scientists have long aspired to harness this capability to build elaborate models of social behavior.

This has direct implications for health, he says, if it means responders don't know where to find large groups of affected people. Cell-phone data could change that. In one of the few reports published on this topic so far, Bengtsson and colleagues showed that by mining anonymized cell-phone data it was possible to track population movements in Haiti after the 12 January 2010 earthquake and during the subsequent epidemic of cholera. 7 For his research, Bengtsson petitioned Haiti's largest cellular carrier, Digicel, headquartered in Kingston, Jamaica, for access to position data from roughly 1.9 million cell phones in the island nation corresponding to the period extending from 42 days before the earthquake until 158 days after. According to coauthor Johan von Schreeb, a surgeon from the Karolinska Institute, Digicel released the data only after company officials were satisfied that, as academics, Bengtsson and his team wouldn't use them for economic gain.",

The major recipients of that outflow, the phone data revealed, were three coastal towns: Les Cayes on the southern coast, Leogane to the east of the capital, and Saint-Marc to the north. In addition, an esti mated 120,000 people who were outside the capital prior to the quake moved into the city during the same 19-day period. These findings were consistent with a retrospective United Nations survey conducted 6 months after the disaster, the authors report. But, crucially, the movement patterns were far different than the Haitian government's official real-time estimates, upon which relief operations relied. 7 Bengtsson and colleagues subsequently used call records to investigate population movements after cholera took hold in Saint-Marc and surrounding areas. Their investigation revealed that many who left those areas wound up in Port-au-Prince and other urban centers to the north and south. 7 \"That's important because we know that people who leave a cholera-affected area can carry the disease with them,\" von Schreeb says.",

Eagle recently investigated that hypothesis in Rwanda after cholera took hold in August 2011.

The power of these models was illustrated in a 2010 study by two professors and longtime collaborators-Nicholas Christakis from Harvard University and James Fowler from the University of California, San Diegowho found that social network analyses can predict flu outbreaks earlier than traditional tracking methods. 8 That finding arose from a study in which Christakis and Fowler randomly selected a group of Harvard University students, asked each to name a friend, and then compared flu incidence among the \"friends\" group to that among the nominating group. The underlying hypothesis-attributed to professor Scott Feld of Purdue University-is that when asked to name a friend, most people will refer to someone with a higher social standing (i.e., by naming a popular friend, the person makes him-or herself appear to be more popular). Given that they have more social contacts, individuals of higher social status-dubbed \"central individuals\" by Christakis and Fowler-have more opportunity to become infected with transmissible illnesses.",

Whether the same approach would scale up in a larger regional, national, or even multi national context isn't clear, according to Stephen Eubank, a professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

Accuracy studies of how social media platforms cover epidemic health threats are rare. But one study, conducted by the consulting firm ICF Macro on behalf of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, found that blog and Facebook postings covering two environmental health issues-perchlorate in baby food and mold problems with drywall from China-matched up well with what appeared in official reports on the same topics. \"In general,we found that what most people were saying was fairly accurate,\" says Nicole Vincent, a senior associate with ICF Macro. The exception came with the \"comments\" sections that follow online coverage of these same topics by traditional media. \"There's a higher likelihood that people will pass around false information on these comments sections,\" she says. \"But then again, there's going to be a lot more opinion and discussion about personal experiences [in these sections].\" The research was presented at the American Public Health Association's 2011 Annual Meeting.11",
