TLR9 activates the innate immune system following the recognition of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs. Due to the considerable number of rotatable bonds in ODNs, high-throughput in silico screening for potential TLR9 activity via traditional structurebased virtual screening approaches of CpG ODNs is challenging. In the current study, we present a machine learning based method for predicting novel mouse TLR9 (mTLR9) agonists based on features including count and position of motifs, the distance between the motifs and graphically derived features such as the radius of gyration and moment of Inertia. We employed an in-house experimentally validated dataset of 396 single-stranded synthetic ODNs, to compare the results of five machine learning algorithms. Since the dataset was highly imbalanced, we used an ensemble learning approach based on repeated random down-sampling.",

Predictions on 6000 randomly generated ODNs were ranked and the top 100 ODNs were synthesized and experimentally tested for activity in a mTLR9 reporter cell assay, with 91 of the 100 selected ODNs showing high activity, confirming the accuracy of the model in predicting mTLR9 activity.",

There are 13 expressed TLR genes in mice (10 in humans), and each is devoted to recognizing a distinct set of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are not found in healthy vertebrate cells, making them an important tool to help fight infections [1] . TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 are extracellular and are situated in the plasma membrane where they bind bacterial cell wall components such as lipoteichoic acids, lipopolysaccharides, lipoproteins, and flagella. TLRs 3, 7, 8, 9 are located in endosomes where they recognize specific nucleic acid sequences expressed by various pathogens [2] . The extracellular signaling domain of TLR9 forms a horseshoe shaped dimer that forms a sandwich that clasps two CpG oligonucleotides (ODN) resulting in the cytoplasmic domains coming into close proximity thereby triggering downstream signaling [2] . Upon activation, TLR9 triggers an innate immune response characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12.",

Synthetic TLR9-active ODNs have shown utility as vaccine adjuvants and anti-cancer immunotherapeutic agents. To identify a good TLR9 ligand, typically a large library of ODNs needs to be synthesized and screened on cell lines, which is a time consuming and expensive task. We hypothesized that modern in silico high-throughput screening (HTS) methods may improve the ability to identify novel highly active TLR9 ligands. In silico screening, also known as virtual screening (VS), has been widely used to enrich datasets with compounds that have a higher probability of binding to the target of interest [3] [4] [5] , and has an advantage over traditional screening or physical HTS due to its massively parallel processing ability; hence millions of compounds can be assessed economically in parallel. This is particularly important when the search space for potential ODNs TLR9 ligands is taken into consideration. A typical singlestranded ODN TLR9 agonist is 24 nucleotides in length, which amounts to 4 24 total number of possible ODNs.",

If the 3D structure of a receptor is known, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) [6] techniques such as homology modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics can be used. However, if the structural information of the receptor is lacking, then ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) [7] techniques such as quantitative structure-activity relationship and machine learning are more appropriate. SBVS involves molecular complex optimization to find the most favorable 3D binding conformation of the ligand. Consequently, SBVS is unsuitable for highthroughput screening of ligands like 24-mer ODNs, which have over 100 rotatable bonds. On the other hand, LBVS is computationally inexpensive, easy to use and might therefore be useful in the screening of TLR9 activating ODNs.",

We therefore selected RF with the 20-fold cross-validation scheme, having maximum mean balanced accuracy and MCC and minimum standard deviation on both measures, to perform the Fig. 2 The effect of top 20 motifs in the high (a) and low (b) mTLR9 activity group of ODNs in the dataset.

Multiple sequence features such as simple counts of nucleotides, the distance between motifs and graphically derived features like the moment of inertia were calculated before building the RF model. We observed higher occurrence of several motifs such as 'CGGC', 'CCCG', 'GCC', 'CGG', 'GGC', 'CCG', 'CCC', 'GG' and 'CC' in high activity as compared to low activity ODNs. This means that these cytosine and guanine rich motifs along with the key unmethylated CpG dinucleotide contribute to strong mouse TLR9 activation. Interestingly, this is in contrast with the thymine rich motifs reported for TLR9 Fig. 3 Mean and standard deviation of Balanced Accuracy rates of the five classifiers on the twenty bootstrap test samples using k-fold crossvalidation scheme. Mean balanced accuracy rate of RF model was greater than all five algorithms in all the folds stimulatory ODNs by Nagpal et al. [11] . This may be due the fact that our ODN training set was mouse specific whereas the dataset used by Nagpal et al. [11] was not specific to any organism. On further analysis we found 15 and 4 motifs which significantly increased, or decreased, respectively, mTLR9 activity in the low activity group (Additional file 2), whereas, we found only 3 and 4 motifs in the high activity ODNs which significantly (p value < 0.05) increased or decreased, respectively, mTLR9 activity (Additional file 3). Furthermore, we discovered motifs which significantly decreased mTLR9 activity in both low and high groups. For example, 'CGCGTG' and sub motifs like 'GCGTG' and 'CGCGT', decreased the activity of ODNs in both the high and low groups. However, we were unable to identify motifs that increased mTLR9 activity for both groups of ODNs. This suggests that a combination of motifs might be required to increase activity of ODNs in the high group whereas the activity of low ODNs can be improved even by inclusion of a single motif. Cooccurrence of motifs and their effect on mouse TLR9 activity can be analyzed in the future to discover combinations of motifs responsible for the increase in the activity of ODNs in both groups.",

The dataset consisted of 396 ODNs with mTLR9 activity values ranging from 0.0 (no activity) to 1.14 (high activity). The ODNs were grouped into two classes (Fig. 5) based on their respective activity value (i.e. 0.4 and above: high activity and below 0.4: low activity), resulting in a high activity group (count 117) and a low activity group (count 279).",

Our dataset had neither missing values nor outliers and therefore, no further action was required in cleaning the dataset. However, to avoid overtraining the model with similar ODNs, the diversity of the dataset was increased by limiting the similarity within the group. This was achieved by clustering the ODNs within a group using the binary fingerprint features we developed during this study and applying a clustering cutoff of 0.85 to remove similar ODNs. This resulted in the removal of five ODNs from the low activity group with 274 remaining. All ODNs in the high group (count 117) were dissimilar enough not to breach the similarity cutoff and were retained. In our training dataset, the number of ODNs with low mTLR9 activity was approximately 2.5 times more than the number of ODNs with high mTLR9 activity. Therefore, we used the down-sampling technique to balance the dataset, so that 50% of the samples were derived from the set of ODNs with high activity and 50% from the set of ODNs with low activity. Subsequently, the down-sampled dataset was subdivided into training (80%) and testing (also known as validation) sets (20%), using a random sampling technique and the ODNs in the test set were excluded from model training. In order to choose the best classifier with k-fold cross validation, the performance of our models were measured using 20 down-sampled test sets.

In order to derive features, the 24-mer ODN sequences were represented as a 2D-graph, as previously described [16] . Briefly, each base in the sequence is represented as a material point on the graph which is treated as a rigid body and follows the rules of Newtonian dynamics. Numerical features such as the center of mass (\u03bc x , \u03bc y ), the principal moment of inertia(I 11, I 22 ) and radius of gyration (R g ) were calculated for each sequence as described in [16] .",

These can be broadly divided into filter methods (e.g. correlation matrix, information gain, Chi-square score, principal component analysis, regression coefficients, variable importance) and wrapper methods (e.g. forward/backward selection, randomized methods that combine PLS with the genetic algorithm or Monte Carlo algorithm) [19] [20] [21] . Filter methods are easy to implement because there is no learning involved and depend only on the application of a cut-off value to reject features due to the low importance in the model construction. In the wrapper methods, the performance of a learning algorithm is evaluated to select the optimum subset of features therefore, it is a very computationally expensive process [19] and is best suited for a limited number of features. Furthermore, filter methods work well for text mining [19] , and are applicable for ODN features, which are essentially nucleotide \"words.\" Due to the large number of fingerprint features available (67 in total), we first filtered out the constant and near-constant features (features with < 0.3 standard deviation) also known as zero and near zero variance features using the caret package in R. Constant or near constant features take a unique value across samples and are uninformative. This resulted in the removal of 26 features. Since these features are binary in nature, we also checked and removed any linear combinations of features if present. This resulted in the removal of 31 features. To understand the distribution in the high and low group of ODNs we created a Cricos plot using the circlize package in R [22] . For all numerical features in addition to removing zero and near zero variance features we also calculated the correlation matrix and filtered out features that were highly correlated. The correlation coefficient was set at 0.85 and features with correlation above the cutoff value were removed. We then normalized the remaining features using centering and scaling techniques to make them unit independent. Subsequently, we merged the fingerprint and numerical features to give us a merged set of 40 features, listed in Table 3 .",

The base learners are usually the Classification and Regression Trees (CART) constructed using a sample with replacement from the training data with the [23, 24] . Briefly RF takes advantage of two powerful statistical techniques, bagging and random feature selection. In bagging each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample (sampling with replacement) and the predictions are made by the majority vote of the trees. Furthermore, in RF instead of using all the features, RF randomly selects a set of features to split at each node when growing a tree. To assess the performance of the RF algorithm, RF performs a type of crossvalidation using the out-of-bag (OOB) samples (samples which are not included in the training set). The concept of variable importance is inbuilt in the RF algorithm and the importance is measured by the Gini impurity criterion index [25] . We used the caret package in R to evaluate the performance and developed an ensemble of 20 different RF models for final prediction. The mtry parameter was tuned using the tuneGrid argument in the train function.",
