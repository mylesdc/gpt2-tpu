This includes production complexity, downstream purification, quality and yield. In many instances, purified antigens are preferred for panning but this may not be possible for certain difficult target antigens. Here, we describe an improved procedure of affinity selection against crude or non-purified antigen by saturation of non-binders with blocking agents to promote positive binder enrichment termed as Yin-Yang panning. A na\u00efve human scFv library with kappa light chain repertoire with a library size of 10 9 was developed. the improved Yin-Yang biopanning process was able to enrich monoclonal antibodies specific to the MERS-CoV nucleoprotein. Three unique monoclonal antibodies were isolated in the process. the Yin-Yang biopanning method highlights the possibility of utilizing crude antigens for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies by phage display.",

It has since been widely employed for the in vitro development of monoclonal antibodies, trading places with the conventional hybridoma technology which was still mainly animal host dependent 2,3 . A detailed review on antibody phage display is provided by Ponsel, et al. 4 , Tohidkia, et al. 5 and Zhao, et al. 6 . To identify a target specific antibody, an in vitro selection process underlined by the affinity enrichment concept known as biopanning is commonly used 2 . The affinity enrichment process involves several steps: immobilization of target antigen, binding of phage to target antigen, elimination of unbound phage and elution of phage 7 . The target antigens used for biopanning includes recombinant proteins, peptides, tissues and whole cells 8, 9 . The main assurance is that these proteins are mainly prepared with good purity and yield. This is evident with the reports of antibody development for dengue virus 10 , herpes simplex virus 11 , cytomegalovirus 11 , Zika virus 12 , Ebola virus 7,13 , Plasmodium species 14 , Mycobacterium tuberculosis 15 , and nematodes responsible for filariasis 16 .",

            "text": "Nevertheless, several complications can be anticipated during antigen expression that hinders the availability of a target antigen for biopanning. Initially, solubility of the antigen is governed by the secretion of antigen into the cytoplasm (soluble form), periplasm (soluble form) and as inclusion body (insoluble form due to protein aggregation). Soluble proteins are desirable for protein purification whilst insoluble proteins must be solubilized, purified and re-folded. To overcome this issue, one has to go through a vigorous optimization process which includes cultivation temperature and conditions, expression using different E. coli expression hosts, co-expression with molecular chaperones, folding modulators and fusion partner proteins. A detailed explanation of recombinant protein expression has been reviewed by Gupta and Shukla 17 and Rosano and Ceccarelli 18 . On top of that, another obstacle in the quest for recombinant protein production is the purification process. Protein purification from crude extracts using chromatography approaches caters to different properties of the protein. A common approach to capture the desired protein independent of unwanted proteins is by using affinity tags like His6x and glutathione-S-transferase to facilitate the purification process 19-21 . Even so, the purification scheme also requires tedious optimization in order to acquire a product of highest purity. All in all, the recombinant antigen has to be pure and abundant before it can be used for biopanning. Hence, this presents a major limitation when attempting to develop antibodies against challenging target antigens.",

Herein, we propose a proof of concept panning process coined 'Yin-Yang' panning using antigen preparations devoid of purification for biopanning. We applied the process to isolate monoclonal scFv against the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nucleoprotein (MERS-NP). The 'Yin-Yang' concept takes its name from the Taoist concept of duality in striking a balance to form a whole. Here, the crude extract consisting of the antigen of interest in its native form alongside the endogenous E. coli proteins are used to achieve a balance between positive and negative selection. Due to the complex microenvironment during target enrichment, reducing non-specific binding interaction to E. coli proteins and blocking agents is paramount to allow effective antigen-antibody interaction to take place. A capture and elimination step was introduced prior to biopanning to remove the influence of binders against the non-target proteins. The complete workflow is outlined in the following schematic diagram (Fig. 1 ). The proposed approach was able to isolate monoclonal scFv clones against the MERS-NP utilizing a crude preparation. The antibodies were verified and identified for specificity against MERS-NP. This approach highlights the possibility of carrying out antibody phage display biopanning using crude antigens to identify antigen specific monoclonal antibodies.",

The extent of blocking was further determined by calculating the ratios of the difference between blocked \u03b1Ubi in a mixture of PTM buffer and lysate against other sets of blocking agents. There was approximately a 10-fold difference between \u03b1Ubi blocked with a combination of PTM buffer and lysate against the PTM buffer only and lysate only.

Based on the phage titres in Supplementary Fig. S2b , the amount of unbound M13KO7 (10 10 cfu/mL) were similar to that of the biopanning simulation using purified rUbi. This indicates the efficiency of E. coli lysate and PTM buffer blocking to remove non-specific interaction from crude fractions. As for bound phages, the number of bound M13KO7 (10 4 -10 6 cfu/mL) however was almost the same as the bound \u03b1Ubi phages (10 4 -10 5 cfu/mL) with a difference of only 0.5-4-fold. This pattern was expected, as the difference of bound phages in previous simulation (with pure rUbi) was also minimal. Notably, the amount of bound M13KO7 for sample 4 (PTM buffer and lysate) was 10-fold higher than \u03b1Ubi phage. This showed a dominant population of empty phages in the eluted phages rather than antibody presenting phages. The highest fold change between unbound and bound \u03b1Ubi phage was recorded from sample 2 (PTM only) at 6,800-fold, followed by sample 1 (PBS only) (5,500-fold) and sample 4 (PTM and lysate) (4,300-fold) (Fig. 6b) . On the other hand, the highest ratio of difference between unbound and bound M13KO7 was determined from sample 1 (PBS only) at 716,000-fold, followed by the PTM buffer and lysate combination (254,000-fold). This implied that the 'Yin' step was sufficient to deplete the non-specific binding of M13KO7. Moreover, the binding capacity of \u03b1Ubi phage towards crude rUbi was not affected by the 'Yin' effect, but in contrast helped to control the interference of background phages.",

Unfortunately, the problems of expression and purification of E. coli produced recombinant proteins are atypical. Some recombinant antigens have solubility and purity problems 18 , stability issues, difficult to be immobilized 24 and exist in multiple morphologies 25 . Due to these reasons, there is a need to develop an alternative procedure for selection towards relevant antigens presented in a complex mixture especially in situations when rapid antibody development is required or if the purified target is unavailable. Therefore, we demonstrated a capture and elimination step prior to affinity selection in order to provide a 'subtractive' effect to the phage population by blocking the undesired binders via binding to other components in the blocking mixture while freeing the positive binders to favour binding towards the relevant antigen.",

The main difference between this study and the previous methods is the approach and target of negative selection. The target for negative selection is the unspecific antibody phage binders that binds to proteins other than the target antigen. In light of this, the blocking mixture is mainly used to deplete the negative binders. In the previous approaches, polyclonal and mAbs are used to target the unrelated epitopes presented on phages in order to select and remove them, allowing the remaining phage clones to select for antibodies that have affinity towards specific epitopes 24, 26, 27 . Moreover, the 'Yin-Yang' method offers two rounds of negative selection during a single round of biopanning, one before positive selection and one simultaneously carried out with the positive selection. This creates a competitive situation where a small number of unbound negative phage will compete with a large number of unbound positive phage for the target antigen in the presence of target-unrelated proteins. We demonstrated an inexpensive immobilisation strategy of target-unrelated proteins onto a solid phase for negative selection, whereby unrelated proteins preoccupy non-specific binders, either bound to surface or in phage mixture. The limitation of this method is the inability to remove the non-specific binders prior to binding. However, imposing www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ a more stringent washing process during phage elution can compensate for this. Therefore, the phages binding to unspecific proteins can be washed away under stringent conditions, subsequently rescuing bound phages that is immobilised on the plate. Additionally, this method can also be adapted to membrane-bound proteins by using the western blotting system reported by Ding, et al. 28 and Liu, et al. 29 . A comparison of other published enrichment strategies and the 'Yin-Yang' method is provided in Table 2 .",

Competition is expected to occur between positive binders and non-specific binders against the target antigen. Thus, a competitive selection could be imposed by saturating the non-specific binders, M13KO7 with the competitive proteins (lysate and PTM) thereby promoting binding of \u03b1Ubi towards purified rUbi 32 . Despite the presence of other unknown E. coli proteins in the crude fraction of rUbi with the actual concentration of rUbi being expected to be lower than the purified rUbi, the binding capability of \u03b1Ubi is still unaffected as shown in phage ELISA assay upon affinity selection against crude rUbi. The blocking effect of PTM and E. coli lysate was the highest among the samples and was able to block M13KO7 from competing with \u03b1Ubi. There was no bias in the titres of packaged phages for ELISA assay as they were normalized to 10 11 before assayed.",

            "text": "During the 'Yin-Yang' (capture and elimination) step, preincubation of phage was performed in wells coated with E. coli lysate and subsequently with PTM. Proper blocking of the surface with blocking agent such as skimmed milk helps to inhibit unspecific binding [33] [34] [35] and phage preincubation can enhance the reduction of unspecific binders even to the treated surface 36 . The idea of using E. coli lysate proteins as one of the competitive proteins in biopanning originates from the whole cell biopanning approach, where target antigen and un-relevant proteins are presented in the cell lysate mixture 33 . Theoretically, it could be expected that non-binders were depleted during the 'Yin-Yang' step, subsequently allowing free positive binders to initiate binding against the target during affinity selection. The 'Yin-Yang' step complements the blocking effect by the lysate and PTM, www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ thereby allowing more non-binders to be trapped. This was evident as a higher number of unbound M13KO7 was recorded. However, throughout the biopanning simulation against rUbi in purified and crude forms, there were increasing numbers of non-binders being rescued, close to the amount of positive binders rescued. This could be attributed to insufficient washing that resulted in the rescue of non-binders together with positive binders during elution 37 . Despite this, the rescued phages from the crude rUbi were amplified and subjected to phage ELISA assay to determine the best performing sample. The best performing sample was the lysate and PTM combination that gave the highest readout after background subtraction. Hence, we demonstrated that the 'Yin-Yang' step is crucial during biopanning against crude antigen while the combination of PTM and lysate can help to control and reduce the disturbance of non-binders during antigen binding. Nevertheless, due to the rise of background phage elution, washing stringency should be revised accordingly. The rationale of coating the phage pre-incubation well with lysate and then with PTM is to inhibit the plastic binders from interfering in the optimization steps 38 and for further negative selection.",

            "text": "In this work, a na\u00efve human antibody phage library was generated for panning against the MERS-CoV nucleoprotein. The na\u00efve library was constructed from 52 healthy donors comprising of three ethnic groups. This is aimed to expand the diversity of antibody repertoire for a highly diverse antibody library 39 . The 'single pot' antibody library repertoire has a universal characteristic, which makes it suitable to be employed for antibody selection against a wide range of target antigens 39, 40 . To generate a library of highest possible diversity, size and quality, combinatorial mixing of heavy and light chains was performed to create all possible gene combinations. The V-gene repertoire was amplified using a gene specific primer set with a high coverage of antibody genes 5 . In addition to that, the genetic diversity from donor samples of three ethnic groups may offer additional sequence diversity. Cloning efficiency was improved by performing an intermediary cloning to ensure highest incorporation of full antibody gene sequences into the destination phagemid vector. The library generated has a modest diversity of 10 9 that is sufficient for antibody selection. Despite na\u00efve libraries have been reported to yield low affinity binders, it is still an important source for antibodies. A correlation between library diversity with antibody affinity was proposed to be directly proportional 41 . Even so, the low affinity binders can undergo in vitro affinity maturation to improve their binding affinity and specificity 5, 39, 42 . Kappa light chain isotype was solely used with the heavy chain IgM isotype repertoire for this na\u00efve library as more kappa antibodies are reported in the human peripheral blood than lambda antibodies. This is because rearrangement of kappa isotypes occurs earlier but when both kappa alleles failed to rearrange productively, this is followed by lambda rearrangement 43 . However, this ratio changes upon encountering antigens, suggesting that light chain rearrangement occasionally takes place in B cell after the onset of somatic hypermutation 44 . This is in line with the structural and physiochemical studies of kappa and lambda antibodies, with both exhibiting differential characteristics during adaptive immune response 43, 45 . However, in this context, we sought to generate a na\u00efve library for kappa antibodies while further studies on differential properties of lambda and kappa antibodies will be carried out later.",

            "text": "In this study, the na\u00efve library was subjected to the revised affinity selection to isolate antibodies against rMERS-NP from a crude preparation. 'Yin-Yang' biopanning was able to enrich antibodies against crude rMERS-NP after 2 rounds of selections by 2.5-fold. The low enrichment ratio was expected due to the loss of binders to interfering proteins from the crude fraction. The method is able to impose both the competitive and subtractive effect onto non-specific binders in order to increase the possibility of positive binders to bind the target in extremely low amounts. Reproducibility of this method is fairly good as good enrichment was achieved in several attempts using other in-house antibody libraries against different targets (data not shown). MAb selection was done and 3 full antibody clones were obtained for this work. Based on the sequence analysis, the V-gene combination of clone rMERS-NP-A4 is IGHV4-IGKV2, IGHV1-IGKV2 for rMERS-NP-C8 and IGHV3-IGKV1 for rMERS-NP-G12. The antibody fragments were expressed, purified and their binding specificity determined towards rMERS-NP. rMERS-NP-A4 binds specifically to rMERS-NP with very minimal background signal while rMERS-NP-C8 and rMERS-NP-G12 presented some degree of background signal indicating the clones as low performing clones. We noticed a slight difference in the antibody band migration which may likely be due to the introduction of chemical modifications 46 , which in this case is the biotinylation that contributed to the retardation of gel migration. In addition, previous reports examined the efficiency of biotinylation by comparing the gel migration of biotinylated products against non-biotinylated products in the presence of streptavidin and reveal a slower migrating of biotinylated products [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . Despite all three antibody fragments underwent biotinylation, the gel shift effect was more drastic for rC8scFv at approximately 3-4 kDa difference in comparison to rA4scFv and rG12scFv.",

            "text": "Previously reported neutralizing mAbs against MERS-CoV were specific to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV 52 . The RBD of MERS-CoV binds to human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) (cellular receptor) and gains entry into the target cell for viral infection. Most of the reported mAbs has been focused on the neutralization of RBD to block the interaction of RBD to hDPP4 and extreme potency has been exhibited by mAbs targeting RBD. Despite hDPP4 is another potential target for neutralization, it is also a particularly important molecule in the immune regulation of T cell activation and chemokine function. Therefore, clinical use of it is unadvisable as adverse side effects may arise 53, 54 . A recent report combined mAbs specific to RBD and non-RBD (other domains on S glycoprotein) to initiate neutralizing enhancement as different antigenic sites on S proteins are targeted 55 . Nevertheless, immune escape is always endeavoured by coronaviruses by expression of mutant S proteins while nucleocapsid proteins have less mutations. The abundant NP of MERS-CoV makes it another potential candidate target other than the S proteins. NPs are responsible for viral genomic RNA packaging, transcription and assembly 56 . In a previous report, three mAbs against MERS-CoV RBD with exceptional potency was found to originate from the IGHV1-69 heavy chain family 57 . Interestingly, in this study, we found that rMERS-NP-C8 clone targeting the NP also belongs to IGHV1-69 heavy chain family. Of note is that the IGHV1-69 gene was also found to be utilized by other antiviral antibodies targeting HIV-1, influenza virus and hepatitis C virus 54 . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ This 'Yin-Yang' method together with the na\u00efve scFv library was able to select antibodies against a complex antigen by providing competitive and subtractive effects to favour binding of positive binders. This permits antigens in different states (complex mixture, low purity, protein cocktails) to gain excess for affinity binding without the limitations of protein purity and yield. It is likely that optimization of this approach is required for different antigens produced in different host cells due to the differences in cell contents. The generated kappa light chain scFv library was able to generate mAbs against MERS-CoV NP using the proposed approach with crude rMERS-NP. Therefore, this kappa exclusive na\u00efve library is potentially useful for isolation of antibodies against other interesting antigens in the future. In conclusion, the 'Yin-Yang' panning together with the kappa na\u00efve scFv library can be used as an alternative selection process for mAb generation against challenging target antigens. ",

Blocking effects of PTM buffer and E. coli lysate. Optimizations were done step-wise to investigate the binding capacity of the antibody towards the antigen in various blocking agents and target-unrelated proteins. Initially, a one-step affinity selection was performed separately with \u03b1Ubi and M13KO7 against 10 \u00b5g of purified rUbi in the presence of various blocking agents. Eight microwells were coated with 100 \u03bcL of purified rUbi in PBS buffer overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The wells were washed three times with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (PBS-T) and blocked with 300 \u03bcL of PTM blocking buffer (2% (w/v) skimmed milk in PBS-T) for 1 h with 600 rpm agitation at room temperature (RT). Simultaneously, the \u03b1Ubi phage (10 10 cfu/mL) and M13KO7 (10 11 cfu/mL) were blocked separately with 4 sets of blocking agents in a total volume of 100 \u03bcL: i. PBS buffer, ii. 2% PTM, iii. E. coli lysate and iv. 2% PTM and E. coli lysate. The incubation took place for 1 h at RT, with gentle agitation at 600 rpm. Then, the antigen-coated wells were washed three times with PBS-T and the blocked phages were transferred into the wells accordingly. The binding took place at RT for 2 h at 600 rpm. The phage mixtures were collected at the end of incubation as 'unbound phages' and the wells were washed three times with PBS-T. The bound phages were eluted by enzymatic digestion with 100 \u03bcL of Trypsin (10 \u03bcg/mL in PBS buffer) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C, static. Serial dilutions were performed for both unbound and eluted phages. The serially diluted phages were allowed to infect 200 \u03bcL of exponentially growing TG1 culture (OD 600nm = 0.5) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min, static.
