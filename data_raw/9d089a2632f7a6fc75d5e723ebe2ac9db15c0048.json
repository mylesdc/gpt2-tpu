CD200-CD200R interactions induce a unidirectional inhibitory signal within CD200R-bearing cells that is mediated by tyrosine motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of CD200R that recruit DOK2 and RasGAP, resulting in inhibition of the ERK pathway [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

Importantly, CD200R also restricts viral-induced inflammation during respiratory influenza infection [9, 11] and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the cornea [11] . However, CD200R also restricts IFN-dependent control of corona virus infection via regulation of TLR7 [12] and control of intracranial HSV infection [13] , demonstrating that this inhibitory receptor can impinge on protective antiviral immunity.",

CD200 + cells did not express alpha smooth muscle actin (S1B Fig.) , also demonstrating these cells were not myoepithelial cells. Interestingly, CD200 + cells were often observed in ring-like structures around acinar epithelial cells (Fig. 2B) , indicative of capillary networks that surround acini [34] . CD200 + CD31 + cells were detectable in na\u00efve SGs (S1C Fig.) , and we observed no notable increase in the intensity of CD200 expression by CD31 + cells within infected tissue. In addition to abundant CD200 + CD31 + cells, a more scarce population of CD200 + CD45 + cells was also detectable within the SGs indicating the presence of CD200 on a hematopoietic cell type(s) (Fig. 2C) . Analysis by flow cytometry revealed significant CD200 expression by APCs and T cells within the SGs and spleen (Fig. 2D&E ) during MCMV infection. ",

            "text": "Infection of BM-DM with influenza did not trigger CD200 expression (Fig. 3D) , demonstrating that CD200 up-regulation is not a generic macrophage response to viruses. However, CD200 expression is induced by ligation of TLRs, including TLR3 and TLR9 [10] ; both of which are triggered by MCMV [35, 36] . In accordance, TLR3 ligation by PolyI:C induced substantial CD200 mRNA expression by macrophages in an IFN\u03b2-dependent manner (Fig. 3E ). To investigate whether MCMV induction of Cd200 transcription required productive replication, we compared expression following macrophage infection with IE3 knockout replicationdeficient MCMV ( \u0394 IE3) [37] and replication-sufficient wt MCMV (pSM3fr). Macrophage exposure to \u0394 IE3 MCMV induced a small, transient induction of CD200 mRNA in an IFN\u03b2dependent manner (Fig. 3F) , consistent with TLR-mediated induction of CD200 triggered during incomplete MCMV replication, and the moderate CD200 protein expression by uninfected (m06 -) macrophages derived from infected cell cultures (Fig. 3C ). In contrast, replicating MCMV induced substantial and prolonged CD200 mRNA expression independently of IFN\u03b2 (Fig. 3G) . Furthermore, inhibition of viral DNA polymerase with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) antagonized MCMV-induced CD200 expression in BM-DMs (Fig. 3H) , again demonstrating the requirement for productive virus replication in this process. Importantly, we observed that SG-APCs did not support MCMV replication in vitro in accordance with the absence of detectable infection in vivo [38] , and MCMV infection of splenic DCs did not further induce CD200 expression (Fig. 3B ). Thus, these data suggested that myeloid cells up-regulated CD200 during MCMV infection and, in the case of macrophages in secondary lymphoid tissues, MCMV induces CD200 expression independently of TLR stimulation during productive replication.",

Low levels of SG-APC homeostatic proliferation were measured in na\u00efve wt and CD200R -/mice (Fig. 5D) . However, infection-induced SG-APC proliferation was further elevated in CD200R -/mice as compared to wt mice day 7 pi (Fig. 5D&E) , a time at which CD200R was expressed by these cells in wt mice (Fig. 1D&E ). This suggested that increased SG-APC accumulation in CD200R -/mice was a consequence of heightened proliferation. Importantly, visualization of MHC II + cells within the SGs revealed that MHC II + cells were consistently located adjacent to large CD200 + cells 7 days (Fig. 5F ) and 14 days (S2B Fig.) pi. In accordance with CD200 expression by CD31 + cells ( Fig. 2A) , MHC II + cells were also observed surrounding CD31 + vessels (Fig. 5G) , suggesting that tissue-resident MHC II + SG-APC interactions with CD200bearing endothelial cells restricts infection-induced cellular proliferation. In support of this conclusion, chimeric mice lacking CD200 only in non-hematopoietic cells exhibited increased SG-APC accumulation (S2C Fig.) . Furthermore, improved control of MCMV in these mice (Fig. 4) in addition to the absence of an impact of non-hematopoietic cell-derived CD200 on splenic DC responses (S2D Fig.) points towards a role for local SG-APC expansion in determining control of MCMV replication in the mucosa.",

Despite the absence of measurable T cell expression of CD200R (Fig. 1D) , SG-infiltrating CD4 T cells in CD200R -/mice exhibited increased activation, indicated by CD69 and CD25 up-regulation 10 days pi (Fig. 6A&B) . Enrichment of CD25 hi CD4 T cells were not observed in either wt or CD200R -/mice (Fig. 6A) , consistent with the absence of regulatory T cell infiltration into the SGs in response to MCMV [31] . Importantly, IFN\u03b3 + virus-specific CD4 T cell numbers were elevated in the SGs of CD200R -/mice by 14 days pi (Fig. 6C ). In addition to activated T cells, CD4 + tissue-resident memory T cells also express CD69 [42] . Interestingly, whereas CD69 expression by SG CD4 T cells was elevated in CD200R -/mice 14 (Fig. 6D ) and 30 (S3A Fig.) days pi, elevated prolonged expression of CD25 by CD200R -/-SG CD4 T cells was not observed (S3B Fig.) , implying that CD200R may also restrict the accumulation and/or retention of CD4 T cells with a tissue-resident memory-like phenotype. Furthermore, MHC II + SG-APCs that proliferate and accumulate to higher numbers in CD200R -/mice (Fig. 5B-E) co-localized with CD4 T cells (Fig. 6E) , suggesting that elevated myeloid cell responses within the SGs of CD200R -/mice enhanced mucosal CD4 T cell responses. In addition, elevated splenic DC numbers 14 days pi in CD200R -/mice (Fig. 5A) were accompanied by an increase in virus-specific CD4 T cells in this organ at this time (Fig. 6F) .

Restriction of myeloid cell responses was central to the inhibitory action of CD200R. CD200R signaling limited accumulation of MHC class II-bearing APCs in both the periphery and mucosa thus restricting the ensuing virus-specific CD4 T cell response. CD200R restricted SG-APC responses by limiting virus-induced cellular proliferation. CD200R inhibition of this process has likely evolved to limit responses to harmless antigens that mucosal surfaces are continually exposed to.

Our data also demonstrated that CD200R impaired the accumulation of virus-specific CD4 T cells in the periphery that was accompanied by reduced splenic DC accumulation.

Improved control of MCMV replication in the SGs in CD200R -/mice was intriguing given that MCMV does not encode an obvious CD200 homolog. This may be explained in part by the existence of a structural CD200 ortholog encoded by MCMV that lacks sufficient sequence similarity to be detected, or by the existence of other viral ligands for CD200R. Importantly however, experiments utilizing CD200 -/mice highlighted a role for cellular CD200 in dampening antiviral immunity. Cellular CD200 restricts virus-induced immune responses in acute virus infections [8, 12, 45] , and our data supports the conclusion that some viruses may exploit host CD200-CD200R interactions to establish persistence. Intriguingly, in vivo experiments investigating a functional role for CD200 orthologs expressed by RCMV [26] and Rhesus macaque rhadinovirus [46] failed to detect significant benefit of these vCD200s in promoting herpesvirus persistence in these experimental models. Our data suggest the benefit of herpesvirus exploitation of host CD200 expression, irrespective of whether the virus also encodes its own vCD200 protein.",

Although SG-APCs did not support MCMV replication, splenic macrophages up-regulated CD200 following direct MCMV infection in vitro. MCMV infection of wt and CD200R -/bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in comparable expression of MHC II (S4B Fig.) , suggesting that MCMV does not exploit macrophage expression of CD200 to deliver an autocrine inhibitory signal; a conclusion further supported by comparable MCMV replication in wt and CD200R -/macrophages and consistent with the inability of CD200 to interact with CD200R in a cis-cellular fashion [47, 48] .",

Importantly, replication-competent virus induced Cd200 expression in macrophages independently of this pathway, and CD200 induction was dependent upon viral DNA polymerase activity. The mechanism through which MCMV actively regulates CD200 is not clear. CMV infection induces profound alterations in host cell protein production and gene expression [49] [50] [51] [52] . Concurrent analysis of Cd200 gene and surface protein expression highlighted that viral induction of CD200 occurred at the transcriptional level. The impact of PAA on virusinduced CD200 expression suggests the involvement of a gene product or products expressed during the latter stages of virus replication. However, this conclusion is guarded given that inhibition of viral DNA polymerase during HCMV infection also incompletely inhibits production of certain viral proteins expressed at early times during the virus life-cycle [53] .",

After QC using an Agilent Bioanalyzer, total RNA was labeled and hybridized to Mouse Gene 1.0ST microarrays (Affymetrix, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions using a WT Expression kit (Ambion, UK). After data capture, quality control metrics were assessed using Affymetrix Expression Console software and then all arrays were imported into Partek Genomics Suite (Partek, USA) for downstream analysis. In brief, arrays were normalized using the gcRMA algorithm [56] . After normalization, to increase confidence in the genes taken forward to statistical analysis, data was filtered to include genes with at least 1 signal value of > = 150 across the time course.",

To analyze viral load data from bone marrow chimeras, linear regression analysis was utilized. Data were first subject to square-root transformation to introduce stability. We then fitted a linear model for covariates (donor + recipient) with and without the interaction term. Subsequent ANOVA analysis of these models showed the interaction term not to be significant (p = 0.13). However a model without any interactions is strongly significant (p = 0.0015) and was therefore used. For paired analysis of flow cytometry data, the two-tailed Student's t test was utilized. For bone marrow chimeras, linear regression of nontransformed data was used. \u00c3p<0.05, \u00c3\u00c3p<0.01, \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3p<0.001. ",
