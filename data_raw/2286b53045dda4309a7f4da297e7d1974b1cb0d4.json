The architecture for the state-of-the-art CNN has many parameters; for example, the VGG-16 Model has 138 million parameters, where the parameters are learned from the ImageNet dataset containing 1.2 million general object images of 1,000 different object categories for training [16] . Deep neural networks are difficult to train using small datasets (i.e., a few hundred images). To circumvent this problem, we used the fine-tuning technique, which is one of the regularization techniques. We fine-tuned a modified VGG model with 16 layers (13 convolutional and three fully connected layers), which uses the convolution filters of the same size (i.e., 3 \u00d7 3) for all convolution layers, as seen in Table 1 . Our network configuration is depicted in Fig 2 and Table 1 . Each layer and feature map in the CNN is represented by a three-dimensional array of Table 1 ; \"conv\" represents a convolutional layer and \"FC\" represents a fully connected layer).",

A series of convolutional layers (conv1, conv2, conv3, conv4, and conv5) were followed by three fully connected layers: the first 2 fully connected layers (FC6 and FC7) had 4,096 channels each, where each followed a ReLU activation function, while the last fully connected layer (FC8) had 2 channels since our problem was a two-way classification problem (melanoma and non-melanoma class). It should be noted that the number of channels of the last fully connected layer was the same as the number of classes. Hence, we replaced the original fully connected layer (FC8: FC with 1000 channels) with a fully connected layer with two channels. The last layer had the soft-max activation function and predicted whether the input patch was a melanoma or non-melanoma lesion.",

To resolve this issue, we adopted a sliding window strategy and used the cropped patches instead of the full image at the training and inference time. At the inference time, we extracted about 12 image patches from each test image on a regularly spaced grid with a partial overlap between neighboring patches and then each patch was rescaled to the size of 224 \u00d7 224 pixels, as seen in Fig 3. In addition, to increase the robustness of the variation of geometric transformation in our CNN model, the training dataset was artificially augmented at training. Additional augmented data were formed by rotating and flipping images from the original training set. We generated 216 image patches from a single image using rotations by 0\u02da, 45\u02da, 90\u02da, and 135\u02da, as well as leftright and top-bottom reflections.

However, these cannot be directly applied to acral melanoma due to the different morphologic features such as ridge or furrow patterns. Although there was a new dermoscopic algorithm reflecting these characteristics for diagnosing acral melanoma: BRAAFF [26] , it has not yet been applied to the automated diagnosis. In addition, although there is a state-of-art automated classification method for acral melanoma, these methods cannot be generalized and only work well for a particular pattern of acral melanoma, which is a ridge-and-furrow pattern [27] . Automated diagnosis methods using particular features are able to reflect experts' perception and the speed of performance is fast. However, it is not easy to catch experts' perception, although we are trying to reach the goal with significant features. On the other hand, deep learning does not require specific features as inputs. It automatically finds the most correlated features with expert's perception by learning.

Our inferior results may be due to the characteristics of AM; it occurs on the pressure area, thick skin, callus, etc., which can hinder and transform the classic pigmented lesion into an atypical case. Because of this, experts in our experiment also showed an AUC of 0.82. Therefore, if the datasets are analyzed separately considering these anatomic characters, CNN may perform a more precise discrimination. Furthermore, if combined with images from noninvasive devices for melanoma diagnosis, which may overcome the problems presented by a thick skin, the accuracy of CNN can be markedly improved. Several non-invasive devices such as confocal and photon microscopy are being introduced to provide convenient ways to diagnose melanoma early [28] . However, they require much effort and time for a physician to gain expertise. An automated diagnostic system using a CNN, even with a small dataset, may alleviate the difficulty of learning how to use these newly developed devices.",
