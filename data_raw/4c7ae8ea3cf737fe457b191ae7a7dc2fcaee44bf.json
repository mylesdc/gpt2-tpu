It has been demonstrated previously that HCV non-structural protein 3 (NS3) is involved in cell transformation. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid screening experiment was conducted to identify cellular proteins interacting with HCV NS3 protein. Cytosolic 59(39)-deoxyribonucleotidase (cdN, dNT-1) was found to interact with HCV NS3 protein. Binding domains of HCV NS3 and cellular cdN proteins were also determined using the yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions between HCV NS3 and cdN proteins were further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal analysis in cultured cells. The cellular cdN activity was partially repressed by NS3 protein in both the transiently-transfected and the stably-transfected systems. Furthermore, HCV partially repressed the cdN activity while had no effect on its protein expression in the systems of HCV sub-genomic replicons and infectious HCV virions. Deoxyribonucleotidases are present in most mammalian cells and involve in the regulation of intracellular deoxyribonucleotides pools by substrate cycles. Control of DNA precursor concentration is essential for the maintenance of genetic stability. Reduction of cdN activity would result in the imbalance of DNA precursor concentrations. Thus, our results suggested that HCV partially reduced the cdN activity via its NS3 protein and this may in turn cause diseases.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [1] . Infection with HCV is also etiologically involved in the development of B-cell lymphomas [2] . This virus belongs to the genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviviridae. The HCV genome is a single, positive-stranded RNA with a nucleotide length of about 9.6 kb. It encodes a polyprotein precursor of approximately 3,000 amino acids. This polyprotein precursor is processed by host and viral proteases into at least 10 different proteins, which are arranged in the order of NH2-C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH. C, E1, and E2 are structural proteins while NS2-NS5B and perhaps also p7 are non-structural proteins. The release of C, E1, E2 and, p7 from the polyprotein is mediated by the cellular signal peptidase located in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the cleavages between NS2-NS5B are mediated by viral NS2/3 and NS3/4A proteases. NS3 protein contains a serine protease activity within its N-terminal 180 residues and NTPase and helicase activities in the C-terminus (for a review, [3] ). Molecular mechanisms regarding HCV pathogenesis are not well under-stood. It has been demonstrated that HCV NS3 protein is involved in cell transformation [4, 5] . To further understand the functions of the HCV NS3 protein, we have conducted a yeast two-hybrid screening experiment to identify the cellular proteins interacting with HCV NS3 protein. Our results indicated that the cytosolic 59(39)-deoxyribonucleotidase (cdN, dNT-1) interacts with HCV NS3 protein [6, 7] . We further demonstrated that this interaction can result in the partial repression of the cdN activity.",

However, the amount of HCV NS5A protein did not change in these cells (left panel, Fig. 8A ). On the other hand, cdN protein was probably not cleaved by NS3 protein because no potentially cleaved product of cdN was detected in these cells (right panel, Fig. 8A ). To further evaluate the effect of cdN proteins on HCV replication, cdN expression was knocked-down in HCV subgenomic replicon cells. As expected, the cellular cdN protein was reduced to 13%-59% by different shRNAs targeting cdN (middle panel, Fig. 8B ).

The intracellular dNTPs pools in mammalian cells are regulated by substrate cycles. Substrate cycles depend on the interplay between a deoxynucleoside kinase and a nucleotidase [25, 26] . Nucleoside monophosphate phosphohydrases or 59-nucleotidases dephosphorylate non-cyclic nucleoside monophosphate to nucleosides and inorganic phosphates. At least seven 59-nucleotidases with different subcellular localization have been cloned [19] . Some 59-nucleotidases are ubiquitous (eN, cN-II, cdN, and mdN) while others display tissue-specific expression (cN-I and cN-III). All 59-nucleotidases have relatively broad substrate specificities. Detection of individual nucleotidases by enzymatic assays in cell lysates is problematic because different nucleotidases are co-expressed in the same tissue or cell type. cdN is first purified to homogeneity from human placenta [6] . Our results (Fig. 4) showed that cdN contributed more than mdN to the total cellular 59(39)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity, which is consistent to previous reports demonstrating that cdN is responsible for the major 59(39)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity in cultured human cells [15, 27] .",

We further showed that HCV repressed the 59(39)deoxyribonucleotidase activity to 65% but did not affect the level of cdN protein expression (Fig. 7) . Therefore, we concluded that HCV down-regulated cdN activity, and this inhibitory effect is more pronounced in HCV replicons than in HCV infected cells due to the greater amount of NS3 protein in HCV replicon cells. Thus, attenuating cellular 59(39)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity may be a strategy for HCV to benefit its replication. However, neither over-expression nor knockdown of cdN gene affected HCV replication (Fig. 8) . The biologic meaning of attenuating cellular 59(39)-deoxyribonucleotidase activity in HCV-infected cells awaits further investigation.
