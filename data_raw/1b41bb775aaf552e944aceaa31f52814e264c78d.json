Here we describe the characterization of human mAbs from the plasmablasts of an acutely infected patient. One of the 18 mAbs had the unusual feature of binding to and neutralizing ZIKV despite not appearing to have been diversified by affinity maturation. This mAb neutralized ZIKV (Neut 50~2 \u03bcg/ml) but did not react with any of the four dengue virus serotypes. Except for the expected junctional diversity created by the joining of the V-(D)-J genes, there was no deviation from immunoglobulin germline genes. This is a rare example of a human mAb with neutralizing activity in the absence of detectable somatic hypermutation. Importantly, binding of this mAb to ZIKV was specifically inhibited by human plasma from ZIKV-exposed individuals, suggesting that it may be of value in a diagnostic setting.",

            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family and is related to dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and west Nile virus (WNV) [1] . The globally distributed mosquito species of the Aedes genus, vectors for many Flavivirus, can also transmit ZIKV [2, 3] . However, ZIKV remained a relatively minor and obscure cause of human disease for most of the second half of the 20 th century and was featured in a limited number of scientific reports. In fact, it was not until 2007 that autochthonous human infection was described outside Africa and continental Asia-in the Federated States of Micronesia [4] [5] [6] . Since then, reports from Brazil have chronicled a rapidly spreading epidemic that co-exists with DENV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The epidemic has spread north with mosquito-borne transmission being reported in many nations of the Americas as far north as Mexico and southern Florida [7] [8] [9] . More ominously, ZIKV has been implicated as the causative agent in fetal developmental problems [10, 11] . There are reports of ZIKV-associated birth defects, primarily brain abnormalities and microcephaly in infants born to mothers infected with ZIKV [12] . Virus has been recovered from amniotic fluid, placental, and brain tissues [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . ZIKV infection has been classified as an ongoing threat by the World Health Organization. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidance for the management of the infection in the general population, pregnant women, and infants [22] [23] [24] . Due to recent reports of sexually transmitted ZIKV infection, the CDC has also developed guidelines for prevention of this mode of transmission [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . More recently, ZIKV transmission has also been described in Miami, Florida [28] , suggesting that autochthonous spread could occur in any region of the U.S. inhabited by Aedes spp.",

For infectious disease, the Ebola epidemic highlighted the potential utility of a cocktail of three neutralizing (n)mAbs that block infection by the Ebola virus [29] . Most convincingly, the administration of a single nmAb up to five days post infectious virus exposure prevents the development of disease in Ebola-infected macaques [30] . Because mAbs can be engineered to prevent antibody-dependent enhancement by incorporating the L234A and L235A (LALA) mutations which reduce Fc\u03b3R binding [31] , they are a promising intervention in flaviviral therapies. Our long-term goal is to use a cocktail of LALA-mutated nmAbs to prevent ZIKV infection in at-risk individuals, primarily pregnant women.",

            "text": "Therapeutic nmAbs must be potent in order to be clinically viable, and most nmAb isolation strategies are based on the identification of high-titer, antigen-selected repertoires. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) in germinal center (GC) B cells provides the basis for selection of B cells producing Abs with increased affinity-a hallmark of the adaptive humoral response. This feature is conserved among mammals, highlighting the importance of Ab affinity enhancement for evolutionary fitness [32] . Thus, it is unsurprising that the vast majority of human Abs in the memory immunoglobulin (Ig)G pool have undergone affinity maturation and have, on average, 10-26 nucleotide substitutions from precursor genes [33] . The contribution of SHM to Ab-mediated viral neutralization is particularly clear for the chronicallyinduced broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV [34] [35] [36] [37] . Reversion of these anti-HIV nmAbs to precursor germline antibodies results in a drastic reduction or complete loss of viral neutralization [38] [39] [40] [41] . Although mutated mAbs are found after secondary DENV infection, the role of these mutations in acute virus-neutralization and clearance is less clear [42] [43] [44] [45] . Still, the prevalent thought is that antiviral Ab response involves the engagement of poor-or non-neutralizing germline clones generated by V(D)J rearrangement, followed by SHM-mediated refinement in germinal centers to enhance neutralization potency.",

Following the plasma block, the plate was washed and P1F12 was added to corresponding wells for 1 h at 37 C. P1F12 was detected using a rhesus IgG-specific antibody (mouse anti-monkey IgG-HRP clone SB108a; Southern Biotech). Thereafter, the plate was washed and wells were developed with TMB substrate at room temperature for 3-5 min before the reaction was stopped with TMB Stop Solution. Absorbance was determined at 450 nm.",

The previously healthy 56-year-old woman presented to the emergency room (D6) reporting a progressive paresthesia mainly in the extremities of her hands, along with acute, intermittent pain in her left forearm during the previous four days. At physical examination, the patient presented with a grade IV asymmetric muscular weakness and hypoesthesia in her left limbs, with abolished deep tendon reflexes in the lower limbs. A mild weakness of her left facial muscles was also noted. The patient reported no respiratory disorders and no hoarseness, and no signs of dysautonomia were detected at the clinical evaluation. Fever, conjunctivitis, and myalgia or joint pain were absent during the illness. Afterwards, the patient was hospitalized with a clinical diagnosis of GBS, for which an intravenous human Ig (IVIG) treatment was initiated at a dosage of 0.4 g / kg / day for 5 days.",

The most highly mutated mAbs (P1B08 and P1C03) were not ZIKV-specific by binding (S1 Table) . In fact, the eight ZIKV-binding mAbs had the lowest SHM levels, including four mAbs lacking clearly recognizable mutations when compared with putative heavy and light chain germline precursors (S1 Table, Fig 3) . Except for junctional diversity, the ZIKV-neutralizer P1F12 mAb heavy chain did not exhibit signs of antigenselected Ig diversification. P1F12 had an identical sequence to the Ig heavy chain variable (IGHV) genes segment IGHV3-7 \u00c3 01 up to the amino acid C105, prior to the CDR-H3 (International Immunogenetics Information System [IMGT]) [52] . However, position G106-the site of the junction between IGHV and the IGH diversity (IGHD) genes-differed from the germline reference. Interestingly, this region is part of a segment (N1) with non-germline nucleotides corresponding to six amino acids identified between the IGHV and IGHD genes (Fig 3C) . This segment is likely the result of N nucleotide additions generated during B cell Ig gene rearrangement, prior to antigen selection. Because of the lack of mutations elsewhere in the sequences, it is likely that the R106G substitution was also generated during this developmental step. The downstream sequence corresponding to the junction between IGHD3-22 \u00c3 01 and the IGH joining (IGHJ) IGHJ6 \u00c3 02 genes also revealed similar nucleotide insertions. Likewise, the Kappa (K) chain junction between the IGKV1-8 \u00c3 01 and IGKJ4 \u00c3 01 genes also contained one insertion. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of SHM-mediated nucleotide changes in the N insertion regions, no mutation was identified in the remainder of the regions of the heavy and light chains. Thus, the P1F12 mAb is likely very close or identical to the original V-(D)-J gene rearrangement in the na\u00efve B cell before antigen contact.",

In brief, this assay detects the presence of competing Abs that can inhibit the P1F12 mAb binding to its epitope. Because P1F12 did not bind to recombinant E protein (Fig 4) we used whole virus in our binding assays. We captured ZIKV on the plate using the 4G2 mAb (pan-Flavivirus), and incubated ZIKV with plasma from patients with diverse histories of DENV and ZIKV exposure (S2 Table) . We added unlabeled P1F12 (engineered with rhesus IgG1 constant regions) and detected binding of the mAb using a HRPlabeled mouse anti-rhesus mAb (Fig 5) . Nine of ten plasma samples from individuals that had been infected with ZIKV blocked the binding of P1F12 in a blinded test (Fig 5, S2 Table) . Similar blocking activity was observed regardless of whether individuals had been previously infected with DENV or had been vaccinated for yellow fever. In contrast, little or no blocking activity was observed by DENV+ plasma in the absence of prior ZIKV exposure (Fig 5) . Furthermore, this recognition was specific in that it was not observed in 14 of 14 DENV-only infected individuals. Thus, the P1F12 serological blocking assay accurately predicted previous ZIKV exposure, as confirmed by RT-PCR, in all but one of the patient plasma samples tested. Although this patient, donor 1302, had a positive urine RT-PCR result for ZIKV, plasma from 1302 did not block P1F12 binding to ZIKV (S2 Table) . Interestingly, the plasma did not exhibit detectable ZIKV-neutralizing activity, suggesting that this patient did not mount a measurable antibody response against ZIKV. In conclusion, only the plasma that inhibited ZIKV infection of Vero cells contained P1F12-blocking antibodies.",

The binding differences between the mutated and germline Abs were much less pronounced than might be expected [57] . Additionally, mice that cannot conduct SHM due to AID knockout still mounted neutralizing Ab responses against Friend virus, a strain of murine leukemia virus [55] .

Underlying factors that influence the potential association of GBS and ZIKV infection might involve an autoimmune process, which could influence the development of immune responses [61] . Additionally, IVIG may have had a role in the selection of the Ab responses mounted by peripheral B cell repertoires [62] . This is unlikely, however, since the patient initiated IVIG treatment on the same day that the plasmablasts were isolated. It is possible, then, that GBS or IVIG-treatment influenced the development of P1F12. These potential associations are difficult to determine and were outside the scope of this study. It is clear, however, that these responses were not exclusive to volunteer 533, as P1F12 binding can be blocked by the serum of most ZIKV-infected individuals (Fig 5) .",

In contrast, we isolated ZIKV-specific mAbs from circulating plasmablasts at D12. The peak recall of memory B-cell derived plasmablasts is thought to occur within the first week post-secondary infection [63, 64] . Thus, it is probable that most of the isolated mAbs did not have a memory-B cell origin, and it remains possible that some of the plasmablasts were sorted from the basal population that circulate in low frequencies in the blood. In conclusion, the isolation of mAbs using different B cell methods suggest that anti-ZIKV mAbs with germline characteristics are not limited to specific B cell subtypes [42, 45] . Notably, the anti-ZIKV mAbs isolated to date are less mutated than the mAbs isolated after related DENV infections [42] [43] [44] [45] . Together, these findings suggest possible differences in the development of Ab responses against ZIKV.",

Characterizing this interaction will, thus, require a significant effort that is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.

            "text": "Based on the cohort of human plasma samples tested in this study, it appears that most ZIKV-infected individuals mount Ab responses against the epitope recognized by P1F12. This epitope is recognized by Abs in individuals previously infected by ZIKV, thereby preventing the binding of P1F12. By contrast, Abs in the plasma from individuals previously infected by any of the DENV serotypes, do not prevent binding of P1F12. P1F12 may, therefore have potential as a diagnostic. Several diagnostic options for testing for ZIKV exposure exist, including RT-PCR, IgM ELISA, and PRNT methods [22, 68] . While it is relatively straightforward to detect ZIKV nucleic acid during the acute phase in blood, urine, saliva, and semen, it has proven more difficult to design rapid and effective diagnostics for ZIKV exposure in the chronic phase. For samples collected after the first week of symptoms, the initial test is an anti-ZIKV, anti-DENV, anti-CHIKV virus IgM ELISA [68] . However, in patients who have received a flaviviral vaccine (DENV, YFV, or JEV) and/or have been infected with any Flaviviruses in the past, these assays may be difficult to interpret due to the cross-reactivity of the Abs [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . Thus, a positive IgM test needs to be confirmed with a laborious PRNT assay. IgM antibodies persist for 2-12 weeks in serum, and sera from individuals previously infected for more than 12 weeks would also have to be confirmed with a virus neutralization-based method [68] . Our plasma inhibition assay may, perhaps, provide an alternative to these other techniques.",
