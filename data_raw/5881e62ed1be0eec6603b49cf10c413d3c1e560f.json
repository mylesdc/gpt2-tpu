            "text": "While influenza viruses are a common respiratory pathogen, sporadic reports of conjunctivitis following human infection demonstrates the ability of this virus to cause disease outside of the respiratory tract. The ocular surface represents both a potential site of virus replication and a portal of entry for establishment of a respiratory infection. However, the properties which govern ocular tropism of influenza viruses, the mechanisms of virus spread from ocular to respiratory tissue, and the potential differences in respiratory disease initiated from different exposure routes are poorly understood. Here, we established a ferret model of ocular inoculation to explore the development of virus pathogenicity and transmissibility following influenza virus exposure by the ocular route. We found that multiple subtypes of human and avian influenza viruses mounted a productive virus infection in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets following ocular inoculation, and were additionally detected in ocular tissue during the acute phase of infection. H5N1 viruses maintained their ability for systemic spread and lethal infection following inoculation by the ocular route. Replication-independent deposition of virus inoculum from ocular to respiratory tissue was limited to the nares and upper trachea, unlike traditional intranasal inoculation which results in virus deposition in both upper and lower respiratory tract tissues. Despite high titers of replicating transmissible seasonal viruses in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets inoculated by the ocular route, virus transmissibility to na\u00efve contacts by respiratory droplets was reduced following ocular inoculation. These data improve our understanding of the mechanisms of virus spread following ocular exposure and highlight differences in the establishment of respiratory disease and virus transmissibility following use of different inoculation volumes and routes.",

However, the properties that contribute towards the ocular tropism of select influenza virus subtypes, and the mechanisms of virus spread from ocular to respiratory tract tissue following ocular exposure to influenza virus, are not well understood. Here, we present a ferret model where influenza virus in a liquid suspension is placed on the surface of the eye and massaged across the surface of the eye within the conjunctival sac (ocular inoculation) to study the ability of human and avian influenza viruses to cause disease and transmit to na\u00efve animals. We found that both human and avian influenza viruses can mount a productive virus infection following ocular inoculation, attributable to replication-independent drainage of virus inoculum from the site of inoculation to respiratory tract tissue. The viral infection following ocular inoculation was capable of causing severe and fatal disease (in the case of H5N1 virus), but was less transmissible by respiratory droplets (in the case of seasonal influenza viruses) compared with infection following inoculation by the traditional intranasal route.",

Staining of ferret corneal epithelial sheets with biotinylated lectins specific for a2-3 and a2-6 sialic acids revealed a predominance of a2-3-linked sialic acids with relatively weak expression of a2-6 sialic acids on the epithelial surface, an expression pattern similar to human corneal and conjunctival tissue (data not shown) [2, 20] .",

However, influenza viruses of the H7 subtype frequently cause ocular and not respiratory symptoms during human infection, demonstrating that the eye represents an alternate location for influenza viruses to infect humans. Using a ferret model, we studied the ability of influenza viruses to cause disease following ocular inoculation. We found that both human and avian influenza viruses could use the eye as a portal of entry to establish a respiratory infection in ferrets. Influenza viruses were also detected in ocular samples taken from ferrets during virus infection. We identified that influenza viruses spread to different tissues in ferrets when inoculated by ocular or respiratory routes, and that these differences affected the transmissibility of influenza viruses in this model. This study is the first to confirm that virus can spread from the eye to the respiratory tract in a replication-independent manner, and offers greater insight in understanding the ability of influenza viruses of all subtypes to cause human infection by the ocular route. Figure 3 ). Ocular inoculation with all H7 influenza viruses tested resulted in elevated peak mean viral titers in NW samples and a higher incidence of detection in CW samples compared with H5N1 viruses (45% positive among H7 virus samples compared with 25% of H5 virus samples) (Table 2, Figure 2 ). However, despite reduced viral replication in NW samples, H5N1 viruses were capable of causing .20% weight loss and lethal disease in ferrets following i.o. inoculation (Table 1) . Interestingly, all seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses evaluated were detected at high titer in both NW and CW samples; i.o. inoculation with Mex/4108, Brisbane, and Panama viruses, along with the H7N7 NL/230 virus, resulted in the highest peak mean titers in CW samples (.10 3 EID 50 /ml) compared with all viruses examined (Table 2, Figure 2 ). All viruses with the exception of Thai/16 virus were also detected at low titer in RS samples, with peak titers 10 1.8 -10 2.7 EID 50 /ml observed days 3-7 p.i. (Table 2 ).",

While i.n. inoculation with the H7N7 viruses tested in this study results in high virus titers throughout the respiratory tract of ferrets, H7N7 virus dissemination following i.o. inoculation was generally restricted to the upper respiratory tract, with a .3 log reduction in titers in nasal turbinates (p,0.05) and only sporadic virus isolation in trachea and lung samples compared with intranasal inoculation (p,0.005) ( Table 3) . A similar pattern of virus dissemination following H7N7 i.o. virus infection was observed when ferrets were inoculated by the i.n. route using a 100 ml and not 1 mL inoculation volume ( Table 3 ). The H1N1 virus Brisbane replicated with comparable efficiency in nasal turbinate samples regardless of the inoculation route or volume chosen, but similar to H7N7 virus ocular infections, did not consistently replicate to high titers in lower respiratory tract tissues.

Ferrets which succumbed to Thai/16 virus infection following ocular inoculation exhibited pronounced lymphopenia in peripheral blood and systemic spread of virus to all regions of the respiratory tract and brain comparable to 1 mL intranasal inoculation, albeit with reduced lethargy and a delayed time-to-death ( [32] and data not shown). These data suggest that ferrets inoculated by the ocular route succumb to a similar course of disease as intranasally inoculated ferrets, however following i.o. inoculation there is a delay in both the kinetics of virus dissemination and the development of neurological signs and severe disease, potentially owing to differences in virus inoculum reaching lower respiratory tract tissues at the time of ocular inoculation.",

Therefore, we collected both left and right whole ferret eyes and all surrounding conjunctiva/eyelid for virus titration from ferrets inoculated by the intranasal or ocular route with NL/219, NL/230, or Brisbane viruses (Table 4) . Surprisingly, sporadic viral titers from both left and right eye and conjunctival tissue were detected following HPAI H7N7 virus infection by both i.n. (using either a 1 mL or 100 ml inoculation volume) or i.o. inoculation routes (Table 4) . While the magnitude of viral titers and viral RNA was generally similar between intranasal and ocular routes of inoculation, realtime RT-PCR detected CW-positive samples with a greater sensitivity compared with viral culture. Isolation of virus from ocular tissue may be a reflection of the ability of these HPAI viruses to spread to extra-pulmonary tissues post-inoculation as previously described [26] . However, virus was also detected in left and right conjunctival tissue following i.n. or i.o. inoculation of the H1N1 virus Brisbane, a virus which lacks a high capacity for systemic spread [28] . Comparable levels of viral RNA were isolated from CW samples from ferrets inoculated with Brisbane virus by either intranasal or ocular routes, although infectious virus was only detected in CW samples collected from the eyes of ferrets inoculated by the ocular route. To confirm that virus detected in the eye and conjunctiva was associated with tissue-specific virus replication, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to visualize the presence of influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) in ferret ocular tissues. As shown in Figure 3 , influenza virus antigen was detected in epithelial cells from both the lacrimal glands in the conjunctiva and the ciliary processes in the eye collected day 3 p.i. from ferrets inoculated by the ocular route. These results indicate that the route of virus inoculation in ferrets can affect the extent of virus dissemination in respiratory tract tissue, but extra-pulmonary spread, notably to ocular tissue, is present regardless of the point of entry once an infection is established.",

Reduced viral titers in the lungs of ferrets on day 3 p.i. following ocular compared with intranasal administration further indicates differential patterns of virus spread following inoculation (Table 3) . To visualize the deposition of virus immediately following different routes of inoculation, we labeled NL/219 virus with an AF680 fluorescent tag (NL/219-FL) and inoculated ferrets with equal quantities of NL/219-FL virus by the ocular (100 ml total volume) or intranasal (1 ml total volume diluted in PBS) route ( Figure 4 ). Ferrets were euthanized 15 minutes following virus inoculation for ex vivo imaging. In ferrets inoculated by the traditional intranasal route, the majority of virus was deposited in the nasal turbinates and lungs, consistent with a previous study demonstrating virus dissemination throughout upper and lower respiratory tract tissue following this route of inoculation [32] . In contrast, virus deposition in ferrets inoculated by the ocular route (right side only) was primarily localized in the nasal turbinates and right conjunctiva. Lower relative quantities of virus inoculum were present in the upper trachea and esophagus following either intranasal or ocular inoculation. These findings demonstrate that, following i.o. inoculation in ferrets, influenza virus rapidly spreads to the nasal turbinates and upper trachea in a replicationindependent manner, but in contrast to i.n. inoculation, does not immediately deposit in peripheral lung tissue. Furthermore, initial deposition of virus inoculum following ocular inoculation occurs not on the corneal surface of the eye but is rather concentrated in the surrounding conjunctival tissue.",

To assess virus transmission in the presence of direct contact, ferrets were inoculated by the ocular route with the H7N2 virus NY/107 or the H7N7 virus NL/ 230, both viruses which transmit efficiently by this route following i.n. inoculation in ferrets [27] . Twenty-four hours later, a na\u00efve ferret was placed in the same cage as each inoculated ferret to assess transmission. Both NY/107 and NL/230 viruses replicated efficiently in the inoculated ferrets following ocular inoculation as expected, and spread to 2/3 and 3/3 contact ferrets by day 7 postcontact (p.c.), respectively ( Figure 5A ). To assess virus transmissibility by respiratory droplets in the absence of direct contact, ferrets were inoculated by the ocular route with the H1N1 virus Brisbane or the H3N2 virus Panama, both viruses which transmit efficiently by this route following traditional i.n. inoculation [28, 30] . Twenty-four hours following i.o. inoculation, a na\u00efve ferret was placed in an adjacent cage with modified side walls, so that air exchange was permitted between inoculated and contact ferrets in the absence of direct or indirect contact. Unlike the efficient transmission observed with these viruses following traditional i.n. inoculation, ferrets inoculated by the ocular route with either Brisbane or Panama only transmitted virus by respiratory droplets to 1/3 contact ferrets ( Figure 5B ). Virus was not detected in CW or RS samples from the infected Brisbane contact ferret; the infected Panama contact ferret had a peak CW titer of 10 2.75 EID 50 day 5 p.c. and peak RS titer of 10 2.5 EID 50 day 7 p.c. While RD contacts with detectable virus in NW samples seroconverted to homologous virus at the end of the experimental period, contact ferrets which did not have detectable virus in NW samples did not exhibit seroconversion (data not shown). Ferrets inoculated intranasally with 10 6 EID 50 of Brisbane virus in a reduced 100 ml volume and tested for their ability to transmit virus by respiratory droplets exhibited a similar pattern of virus transmissibility as ferrets inoculated by the ocular route, with virus shedding and seroconversion detected in only 1/3 contact ferrets (data not shown). These findings suggest that despite high titers of virus in NW samples, the respiratory infection resulting from inoculation of ferrets with a reduced volume, by either ocular or intranasal inoculation routes, is distinct from that following traditional i.n. inoculation, characterized by a diminished incidence of sneezing and nasal discharge and resulting in reduced transmission of virus by respiratory droplets.",

Characterizing the progression of disease following alternate routes of inoculation with influenza virus will assist in the better understanding of unique features and the relative severity and risk associated with different exposure routes. In this study, we established an in vivo model using the ferret to assess the ability of influenza viruses of multiple subtypes to use the eye as a gateway to establish a productive infection. Both human and avian influenza viruses were capable of mounting a respiratory virus infection in ferrets following i.o. inoculation. The detection of virus in ocular samples collected from ferrets inoculated by either ocular or intranasal routes demonstrates the importance of studying ocular involvement in respiratory virus infection. Divergent patterns of virus transmissibility by respiratory droplets following use of different inoculum volumes and routes of inoculation highlights the complexity of properties which govern virus transmission.",

Bridging the a2-3 rich corneal and conjunctival epithelial surfaces with a2-6 rich upper respiratory tract tissue is the lacrimal duct, which expresses both a2-3 and a2-6 linked sialic acids [14, 34] . Characterization of the distribution of sialic acids in the ferret conjunctiva and lacrimal duct, in addition to the composition of ferret ocular mucins, will allow for a better understanding of virus attachment and replication in these locations. However, in a previous study, we demonstrated that the ability of influenza viruses to bind to or replicate in ocular tissue cannot be explained by sialic acid binding specificity alone [20] . Our detection in ferret ocular tissue of both human and avian influenza viruses with distinct binding specificities further underscores this point (Table 4 , Figure 3 ).",

Despite the absence of visible ocular complications, virus was consistently detected in CW samples from ferrets inoculated by the intranasal or ocular route (Table 2, Figure 2 ).

The presence of virus in RS samples following both i.n. and i.o. inoculation with influenza virus has been previously reported and likely originates from virus swallowed during inoculation [24, 32, 41] , as indicated by deposition of virus in the esophagus following initial virus inoculation by both inoculation routes (Table 3, Figure 3 ).",

However, the permissiveness of multiple virus subtypes to cause a productive infection following i.o. inoculation in the ferret points to a greater capacity of influenza viruses to use the eye as a portal of entry in an experimental in vivo setting, just as previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that numerous human ocular cell types distributed throughout the ocular area support infection and replication with both avian and human influenza viruses [42] [43] [44] . Cumulatively, these previous in vitro studies suggest that the apparent ocular tropism associated with viruses of the H7 subtype is not due to a superior ability to replicate in ocular cells compared with other virus subtypes. Future studies evaluating potential fine receptor specificity differences on the ocular surface and the composition of ocular mucins which may restrict exposure to the ocular epithelial surface to selected virus subtypes may provide a greater understanding of this property.",

Specifically, the nasolacrimal duct which links the ocular lacrimal sac to the nasal meatus could serve as a conduit for virus-containing fluid exchange between ocular and respiratory tract tissue [18] . Numerous reports have documented drainage of vaccine or immunizing agents to nasal tissue following topical ocular administration as well as the spread of intranasally administered solutions to the conjunctival mucosal surface [18, 45] . However, spread of virus from respiratory tract tissue to ocular tissue following i.n. inoculation with human or avian influenza viruses has not been observed previously in the ferret and only sporadically reported in the mouse, possibly due to relatively low titers of virus in nasal tissue or other anatomical differences [20, 24, 26, 46] . Detection of both human and avian influenza viruses in ferret eyes and conjunctival tissue following i.n. inoculation indicates that virus can circulate proximal to the nasal cavity and nasolacrimal canal more readily than previously considered and that more routine collection of ocular tissue during standard virus pathotyping in mammalian models is warranted to better understand the extent of viral ocular dissemination (Table 4 ). While it is unlikely that ferret grooming practices are solely responsible for virus spread between these locations, human studies with numerous respiratory viruses have demonstrated the ability to self-inoculate between ocular and respiratory sites, and it is possible that self-inoculation could be further contributing to virus spread in this model [47, 48] . Inoculation of ferrets by the ocular route with 10 6 EID 50 of selected human and avian influenza viruses in a 20 ml volume resulted in comparable results to those obtained employing a 100 ml inoculation volume, indicating that replication-independent drainage of virus to respiratory tract tissue and subsequent virus detection in NW and CW samples reported in this study was not contingent on the inoculum volume (data not shown).",

Using this technique, we confirmed previously hypothesized reports of replication-independent drainage from ocular to respiratory tract tissue [20, 33] . Viral load measured in respiratory tract tissues day 3 p.i. following i.n. or i.o. inoculation largely mirrored initial virus deposition patterns, with tissues possessing the greatest quantity of virus reflecting those sites of greatest initial virus deposition during virus inoculation (Table 3 -4, Figure 4 ). Both i.o. and i.n. inoculation using a 100 ml volume resulted in detection of virus at high titers in upper and not lower respiratory tract tissues day 3 p.i., indicating that inoculation with a reduced volume leads to limited initial virus deposition in respiratory tract tissues regardless of inoculation route. The delay in high virus titer recovery from lower respiratory tract tissues during HPAI virus infection after i.o. inoculation and the delay in onset of severe disease and lethal outcome with Thai/ 16 virus is likely due to replication-dependent spread (and not deposition) of virus to the lower respiratory tract, suggesting that during inoculation, the majority of virus was retained in conjunctival tissues, drained to the nasal turbinates, or swallowed and diverted away from the lower respiratory tract; future study of ferret lacrimal tissue in this role is warranted. Comparable delays in onset of severe disease compared with traditional i.n. inoculation were observed in a murine model of i.o. inoculation and a ferret model of aerosol inoculation, despite ultimately similar lethal outcomes [20, 32] . The finding here of H5N1 subtype viruses using the eye as a portal of entry to initiate a lethal infection, shown previously in a mouse model, underscores the risk of ocular exposure to influenza viruses, even those subtypes not typically considered to have a tropism for this tissue [20] .",

            "text": "Despite efficient replication of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets following i.o. inoculation, these viruses did not result in frequent detection of sneezing and nasal discharge, and did not transmit efficiently to na\u00efve contacts by respiratory droplets (Table 1, Figure 5 ). Infrequent sneezing is commonly observed among influenza viruses which do not transmit efficiently by respiratory droplets and could be contributing to the reduced transmissibility seen here [28, 30, 31] . Further research is needed to better understand the virologic and immunologic properties which confer the incidence of sneezing and nasal discharge and the role of these properties in virus transmissibility [49] . Additionally, the efficiency of virus transmission by respiratory droplets following i.o. inoculation was likely influenced by the reduced initial virus deposition and subsequent limited replication in the ferret trachea, as reduced virus transmissibility by respiratory droplets was observed following i.n. inoculation when using a 100 ml but not 1 mL volume (Table 3 , Figure 4 , and data not shown). Despite similarly high virus titers and duration of virus shedding in NW samples, the presence of expelled virus particles originating from tracheal replication which was present during traditional i.n., but not i.o. or i.n. inoculation using a reduced volume, may have contributed to differing transmission efficiencies between inoculation routes and may represent a previously unrecognized role for virus replication in tracheal tissue in virus transmissibility by respiratory droplets. In contrast, virus transmission in the presence of direct contact did not differ between inoculation routes. The reduced transmissibility of virus following i.o. inoculation is in agreement with epidemiological studies which demonstrate that the majority of human cases of conjunctivitis following H7 influenza virus exposure are self-limiting [50] . Further study evaluating the shedding of virus into the environment among persons infected with influenza viruses which cause respiratory or ocular disease will shed light on potential differences in transmission dynamics independent of virus subtype.",

The facile dissemination of virus inoculum from ocular to nasal tissue, and the detection of virus in both NW and CW samples throughout the acute phase of ferret infection, highlights the ability for concurrent ocular and respiratory disease following influenza virus infection; not surprisingly, reports of conjunctivitis and influenza-like illness in the same individual have been documented during H7 outbreaks resulting in human infection [40, 51] . While much regarding the properties which regulate the ocular tropism of influenza viruses remains to be determined, our results highlight the potential for a range of influenza A subtypes to initiate infection through the eye and support the use of eye protection during occupational exposure to aerosols containing influenza viruses [19, 52, 53] .",
