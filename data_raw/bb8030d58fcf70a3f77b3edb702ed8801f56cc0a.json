Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a begomovirus, which is the largest and most economically important group of plant viruses, transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. The circulation of TYLCV in the insect involves complex insect-virus interactions, whereas the molecular mechanisms of these interactions remain ambiguous. The insect gut as a barrier for viral entry and dissemination is thought to regulate the vector specificity. However, due to its tiny size, information for the responses of whitefly gut to virus infection is limited.",

TYLCV is transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci in a circulative persistent manner [2, 6] . B. tabaci is a cryptic species complex composed of at least 36 species [7] . In this species complex, the Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (Herein called MEAM1) species is highly invasive and a superior, co-adapted vector for begomoviruses. The epidemics of begomoviruses are usually associated with outbreaks of MEAM1 and the relationships between begomoviruses and whiteflies are complex [8] . When the MEAM1 viruliferous whiteflies were transferred onto non-host plants of the virus, the longevity and fecundity of the viruliferous whiteflies decreased [9] . This indicates that begomoviruses, in some cases, are insect pathogens. The transcriptional response of MEAM1 whiteflies to Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) demonstrated that TYLCCNV can activate whiteflies' immune response [10] . Further results showed that whiteflies use a variety of defense mechanisms to combat virus infection, such as autophagy and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) [11, 12] .",

In this process, midgut and salivary glands are the two major barriers that viruses have to overcome before successfully transmitted [2] . In fact, the gut barrier is the principal determinant for the ability of an insect species to transmit a virus. For instance, the greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum is a non-vector of TYLCV, because the viruses can't cross midgut into haemolymph [14] . Persistent viruses, whether propagative or nonpropagative, can be transmitted to plants after injection into the insect hemolymph [15] . In many cases, injected viruses are transmitted at higher rates than orally acquired viruses [16, 17] . Microscopic studies have shown that TYLCV virions is extensively localized in the filter chamber and cross the epithelial cells in the midgut [6, 18] . Compared to the whole body of whiteflies, TYLCV has a longer retention and higher quantity in the midgut [19] . Nevertheless, TYLCV infection can activate the autophagy pathway in whitefly midguts, which inhibits the efficiency of virus transmission [11] . These studies show that midguts are major reservoir where virions accumulate during acquisition and are critical in insect-virus interaction. However, due to the small size of whitefly midgut, the transcriptional responses of whitefly gut to virus infection remains unknown.",

In this study, we extracted 700 ng RNA from approximately 1000 whitefly guts for RNA-Seq to examine changes in gene transcription between viruliferous and nonviruliferous whiteflies. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a number of genes involved in the material transport, cell cycle, DNA repair, defense responses, signaling molecules and pathways were regulated in the viruliferous whitefly guts. These data provide a valuable source of molecular information for the research of guts in TYLCV-whitefly interactions. To our knowledge, this is the first report to study the direct effect of a plant virus on global gene expression profile of vector's gut using a high-throughput sequencing method. Two cDNA libraries of viruliferous and nonviruliferous guts  were sequenced and generated 51,471,400 and 51,554,406 raw reads, respectively. After filtering for high quality sequences, 44,362,142 and 45,610,802 clean reads were obtained for each sample (Table 1) . Subsequently, the clean reads from the two samples were combined to do de novo assembly, resulting in 69,836 contigs with a mean length of 1121 bp and an N50 of 2407 bp. The lengths of contigs ranged from 200 bp to over 25,000 bp. After clustering, these contigs generated 55,124 unigenes (Fig. 1a) . From these unigenes, a total of 18,574 predicted ORFs was obtained and the lengths ranged from 297 bp to 15,858 bp, with a mean length of 1049 and an N50 of 1491 ( Fig. 1b) . To annotate the unigenes, we searched reference sequences against NT, NR, PFAM and Uniprot databases, using Trinotate and Blast with a cut-off E-value of 10 \u2212 5 . 21,259 (38.57%) unigenes were annotated at least in one database, including 6623 in NT, 18,556 in NR, 12,457 in BLASTP and 17,772 in BLASTX against Uniprot (Fig. 2a) . On the basis of NR annotation, 15.53% (n = 2882) of unigenes matched to Zootermopsis nevadensis, followed by Acyrthosiphon pisum: 8.40% (n = 1560); Ceratitis capitata: 5.53% (n = 1026); Diaphorina citri: 5.15% (n = 956); Tribolium castaneum: 4.07% (n = 755) (Fig. 2b) .",

Six genes were confirmed to be significantly upregulated in guts samples (Fig. 5 ). Moreover, the fold changes obtained by the DEG were generally more extreme than those obtained by qRT-PCR. The inconsistency may be partially due to the lower sensitivity of qRT-PCR compared tosignificant DEG. In addition, the fold changes in guts were more significant than those in whole body. These results indicate that the transcriptome profiles of whitefly guts in response to TYLCV infection are a little different from the whitefly whole body. Nevertheless, qRT-PCR analyses confirmed the direction of change detected by DEG analysis, suggesting that DEG results are reliable.",

            "text": "Viruses depend on hosts machineries to replicate and express their genomes, and altering the host cell cycle is a common strategy of viruses inside the cell [28] . Perturbation of host cell cycle has been shown to be caused by geminivirus infection. For example, Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV) can activate genes expressed during S and G 2 phases and inhibit genes active in G1 and M phases [29] . We noticed that one gene encoding cyclin D2 was upregulated in viruliferous guts. Cylin D2 (CCND2) is a member of the D-type cyclin family, which associates the extracellular signaling environment with cell-cycle progression [30] . Moreover, cyclin D2 was also upregulated in Hepatitis B virus-infected cells and has a positive role in HBV replication [31] . Virus infection can produce a large amount of exogenous DNA [32] . Several mammalian viruses have been shown to induce a cellular DNA damage response during replication, and in some cases, this response is required for optimal virus replication [33] . In addition, cell cycle checkpoints govern cell cycle progression in the presence of DNA damage and incomplete DNA replication [34] . The upregulated genes in cell cycle checkpoints suggest that TYLCV infection may induce DNA damage and affect cell cycle in whitefly gut cells. Interestingly, we also noted that all of the 10 upregulated genes encoding ubiquitin regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Furthermore, 5 of these genes accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. G2/M phase-specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (G2E3) as a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein was implicated in the DNA damages response and cell cycle regulation [35] , and then attenuated replicative stress [36] . Previous study also showed that Beet severe curly top virus (BSCYV) can induce RKP (a functional ubiquitin E3 ligase), which is able to interact with cell cycle inhibitor ICK/KRP proteins to regulate the cell cycle [37] .",

            "text": "Defense responses in whitefly gut in response to TYLCV In our DEGs, 6 genes encoding AMPs were significantly upregulated. AMPs are evolutionarily ancient weapons that resist bacteria, fungi, viruses and any conceivable substance [38] . Previous study has shown that knottin genes are responsive to various stresses and related to TYLCV circulative transmission in the whitefly [10, 12] . Therefore, the observed upregulation of genes encoding the knottin proteins in our study are consistent with previous reports. For cellular responses, phagocytosis is a widely conserved cellular response and refers to the recognition, engulfment and intracellular destruction of invading pathogens and apoptotic cells [39] . Previous study in our laboratory has demonstrated that lysosome participate in autophagy, which could inhibit the efficiency of TYLCV transmission by whiteflies [11] . As stated above, all genes involved in humoral and cellular responses and most genes associated with lysosome were significantly upregulated, strongly suggesting that innate immune systems were activated in viruliferous whitefly guts. For regulators of defense responses, the beta 1, 3-glucan recognition protein (\u03b2GRP), which can lead to melanotic encapsulation in insects [40] , was upregulated in viruliferous gut. This result suggested that encapsulation might be activated after TYLCV infection. The altered genes encoding surface receptor were classified into three major classes; a) CD36 family (n = 4), b) epidermal growth factor (EGF)like (n = 3), and c) Toll receptor (n = 2). CD36 family is class B scavenger receptor that participates in apoptotic cell removal in Drosophila embryos and in phagocytosis of S. aureus [41] . Interestingly, scavenger receptor has been noticed in GO enrichment analysis, but just 1 out of 4 of these CD36 genes was categorized into scavenger receptor activity. The EGF, a transmembrane protein, mediates phagocytosis, has been demonstrated with knockdown experiments, in a broad range of bacteria in Drosophila [42] . Spaetzle (markedly upregulated) is the ligand for Toll receptor, leading to Toll signally pathway controlling the potent resistances to bacterial, fungal, and viral infections [43] . Toll is one of the major signal transduction pathways (another one is Imd), used by antimicrobial responses in Drosophila [44] .",

            "text": "We also observed that a number of genes involved in signal transduction of the defense response were upregulated after TYLCV invasion. Ras is a key regulator of cell growth in all eukaryotic cells and positioned centrally in signal transduction pathways that respond to diverse extracellular stimuli [45] . The medfly homologues of Ras proteins have been shown to affect phagocytosis in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and E. coli [46] . PI3K-Akt pathway is involved in apoptosis and autophagy in Drosophila [47, 48] , as well as in medfly apoptosis [49] . Decreases in phagocytosis produced by pathway inhibitor indicated that PI3-kinase was required for internalization of bacteria [50] . Several studies have implicated involvement of MAPKs in insect innate immune responses [51, 52] , and the activation of MAPK pathway contributes to efficient infection by baculoviruses [53] . Otherwise, several studies have documented that PKC plays an important role in regulating the receptor-mediated endocytosis of virus-receptors complexes [54] [55] [56] , and specific inhibitor . Here we found that all genes involved in the MAPK pathway and PKC were upregulated in DEGs. The intracellular signaling molecules and pathways are organized as communication networks that process, encode and integrate internal and external signals. For example, activated Ras can directly interact with MAPK kinase kinase and activates distinct MAPK cascades (ERK, JNK, p38) [58] . Upon activation, the ERKs can stimulate the activity of Elk-1 transcription factor [59] . Blockage of Elk-1 like protein phosphorylation indicated that an Elk-1 like protein was candidate for the regulation of phagocytosis of bacteria [60] . Moreover, JNK was also reported to be involved in phagocytosis in mosquito cell line [61] . In our results, Ras, MAPKK7, JNK, Elk-1, even phagocytosis were upregulated. Evidently, this signaling network in whiteflies was activated by TYLCV.",

Then the whiteflies were transferred onto virus-infected and uninfected tomato plants for 48 h, respectively. After that, they were separately transferred onto another tomato (Solanum lycopersicom L.cv. Zheza502), which is a resistant variety to TYLCV[11], to eliminate effects of host differences on whiteflies. After 24 h, the whiteflies were used for gut dissection. For sample collection, approximately 1000 guts were dissected from viruliferous and nonviruliferous whiteflies in PBS respectively, and frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C until RNA isolation. Additionally, all the guts were dissected in 36 h to minimize the impact of time on the results.RNA isolation and cDNA library preparationTotal RNA was extracted from pools of approximately 1000 guts using the Absolutely RNA Nanoprep kit (Agilent, USA) according to the manufacturer's manual with slight modifications[63]. RNA quantity and quality were assessed using 1% agarose gels, Qubit\u00ae 3.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA) and the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). RNA (700 ng per sample) was used to generate adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNA libraries for RNA-Seq using the NEBNext\u00ae UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina\u00ae (New England Biolabs, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol.
