            "text": "Precise dating of viral subtype divergence enables researchers to correlate divergence with geographic and demographic occurrences. When historical data are absent (that is, the overwhelming majority), viral sequence sampling on a time scale commensurate with the rate of substitution permits the inference of the times of subtype divergence. Currently, researchers use two strategies to approach this task, both requiring strong conditions on the molecular clock assumption of substitution rate. As the underlying structure of the substitution rate process at the time of subtype divergence is not understood and likely highly variable, we present a simple method that estimates rates of substitution, and from there, times of divergence, without use of an assumed molecular clock. We accomplish this by blending estimates of the substitution rate for triplets of dated sequences where each sequence draws from a distinct viral subtype, providing a zerothorder approximation for the rate between subtypes. As an example, we calculate the time of divergence for three genes among influenza subtypes A-H3N2 and B using subtype C as an outgroup. We show a time of divergence approximately 100 years ago, substantially more recent than previous estimates which range from 250 to 3800 years ago.",

Improved estimates equip epidemiologists and virologists to begin to correlate these important establishing events with historical demographic changes, geographical invasions and zoonoses, the transferring of a virus from one host species to another [7, 1, 25] . For example, archeological sequence data can furnish accurate dates and show that substantial genomic changes associate with geographical invasion and zoonosis [14, 17] . Further, the recent availability of viral gene sequences sampled at a pace commensurate with their rate of nucleotide substitution vastly augments the ability to rigorously infer the time scale of phylogenies and hence determine the time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for different viral types [18, 26, 6] .",

For the last three viruses, a unique zoonotic transfer appears to co-occur with substantial changes in both the composition of nucleotides and amino acids as well as alterations in the rate of nucleotide substitution [15, 14, 1] . In Dengue, where a single subtype simultaneously inhabits two hosts (humans and Aedes aegypti) in a persistent zoonotic process, the introduction of the virus to new geographical environments associates with a dramatic increase in sequence diversity [25] . Unfortunately, no studies thus far analyze the rate of nucleotide substitution during either geographical invasion or zoonosis. Consequently, studies of the date of origins of viral subtypes must use strong a priori assumptions on the rate structure of nucleotide substitution.",

            "text": "Two primary methods find use to date the time of viral subtype divergence. The most commonly employed approach determines the divergence time of subtypes using a molecular clock assumption (MCA) over an entire phylogeny [18, 21, 5, 26] . In its strict formulation, the MCA posits a proportional relation between the number of substitutions and the intervening time period over the entire phylogeny. Looser forms of MCAs require only that the proportionality hold along individual branches, with the rates across branches drawn from a pre-specified distribution [5] . Committed to some variant of the MCA, current algorithms then estimate the rate of nucleotide substitution over all taxa in a given set. Consequently, these methods provide inference most suitable for situations where sequence evolution follows a MCA (e.g. influenza A-H3N2 in human hosts, as in [9] ) or deviates from the MCA homogenously in time (e.g. perhaps influenza A in wild fowl, see [3] ). In considering divergence events between viral subtypes, even when the MCA well-approximates nucleotide substitution within a given subtype, the above methods may incorrectly infer the time of divergence across subtypes. By either assuming that a single rate of nucleotide substitution holds for the region preceding the common ancestor of each subtype or by smoothing the rate of nucleotide substitution over clades with different numbers of taxa, the adherence to a MCA prevents direct inference of the rate during subtype divergence. Suzuki and Nei (2002) propose an alternative, more heuristic method of estimation to counteract the problem of differing rates of substitution before and after zoonotic events [23, 25] . In these studies, the evolutionary models draw a distinction between the rate of substitution within a given subtype and the rate of substitution between subtypes. However, trouble arises since there are no methods for estimating the latter quantity. Consequently, the models assume that the rate of substitution for portions of the phylogeny between the subtypes equals the mean rate in the initial host species population. For instance, in dating the time of divergence between influenza B hemagglutinin and influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase, Suzuki and Nei use the rate of amino acid substitution for water fowl for the portions of the phylogeny previous to the TMRCA of these two proteins [23] . While this method may accurately reflect the rate within avian and human hosts, it neglects whatever additional changes in the rate of substitution are due to the process of zoonotic adaptation, likely leading to a substantial underestimation of the date of the TMRCA.",

Influenza has three types, A, B and C, classified based on serological analysis. To date, only type A sequences have been demonstrably associated with global pandemics [4] . Since modern surveillance began in the 1930s, type B has only been responsible for mild epidemics while type C has been nearly asymptomatic in human infection. Several subtypes of A, notably H1N1 and H3N2, are currently co-circulating in the human population. As the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes may be as divergent from each other as they are from types B and C, we will refer to all types and subtypes simply as subtypes for the remainder of this paper. We select for this study three genes, coding for hemagglutinin (HA), the matrix protein (MP) and the non-structural protein (NS) responsible for interfering with host immune response. Subtype C has a hemagglutinin-esterase gene that is analogous to the hemagglutin gene in other subtypes [1] . We hence refer to the hemagglutinin gene generally and the hemagglutininesterase gene when referring specifically to the subtype C sequences.",

Our estimator derives from the triplet statistic developed in [26, 22, 13] , where each sequence member of the triplet draws from a different subtype. In this manner, we generate from each triplet an estimate of the rate of nucleotide substitution between the most recently diverged subtypes, and consequently provide an estimate of the TMRCA. This circumvents the problems posed by earlier methods by directly estimating the pairwise rate of nucleotide substitution over the set of pairs of sequences straddling the subtype divergence without any further rate assumptions other than the existence of a mean. However, this method is only capable of determining the rate between two subtypes where a third, more distantly related, subtype functions as an outgroup. This method thus trades the ad hoc rate assumptions of the previous methods with two implicit conditions: (i) that subtypes have a unique divergence and (ii) a third, comparable subtype is available to serve as an outgroup. In exchange, we arrive at a precise statistical measure of the TMRCA that converges as the number of taxa increases and is robust to the balancing of the numbers of taxa between different subtypes. We show that applying this method to dating the divergence of influenza subtypes A-H3N2 and B gives a time of diver-gence approximately 100 years before present, substantially more recent than previous estimates.",

Starting from a given set of aligned sequences {s 1 , ..., s n } for n taxa, we define the pairwise distance in number of substitutions to be the estimates {K ij } under a given model of nucleotide substitution. Naturally the unobservable true values {D ij } of the pairwise distances differ from their estimates {K ij }. To understand this difference, we associate each D ij with an error \u03b5 ij and assume that \u03b5 ij tends to zero as sequence lengths increase without bound. We further assume that the covariance between errors, cov(\u03b5 ij ; \u03b5 mn ), is bounded and known. For time measurements, we assume that each sequence is labeled by a sampling time t i given in consistent units. Since we know only the sampling time of a given sample up to the unit of time reported (day, month, year) we posit an uniform error \u03bd i ~ U [0, 1] underlying each t i over the unit sampling interval. To complete the error structure specification we force the two forms of error (\u03bd i and \u03b5 ij ) to be independent. Finally, for a set of three sequences (s i , s j , s k ) and their associated pairwise distances, we enforce a fixed topology among sequences, as shown in Figure 1 , via methods outlined in [26] . We augment the topology with the observed sampling times of the three sequences, \u03b1, the divergence time between the two sequences of interest and \u03b2, the divergence time of all sequences. When necessary for clarity, we write \u03b1 ij to indicate the true time of divergence between sequences i and j.",

All genes are similar in dating the TMRCA for A-H3N2 to approximately 1965 (1964, 1965, and 1962 for HA, MP and NS genes, respectively). These dates are consistent with the emergence of the A-H3N2 subtype into global circulation dur-ing the 1968 pandemic [1] . Both the MP and NS genes date the TMRCA of subtype B to 1943, while the HA rate places the TMRCA at 1953. This latter value is inconsistent with the influenza B sub-epidemics of 1950-51 but is consistent with the emergence of the more lethal Victoria strain of influenza B in 1953 [11] . Each of these estimates has a standard error of approximately 2 years and so these discrepancies may be accounted by measurement uncertainty. The 10 year gap between the TMCRA suggested by the different genes can be explained by a reassortment event. Finally, the TMRCA of subtype C is calculated as 1952 and 1953 by the MP and NS genes, respectively, while the HA gene places the TMCRA at 1906. This nearly half century discrepancy suggests that the subtype C HA gene experienced a markedly different evolutionary history than either the MP or the NS gene. A biologically plausible explanation would be a reassortment event. Another possible explanation is that non-MCA rate behavior has lead to substantial bias in dating the TMRCA.",

As such estimates span paths between subtypes, they simultaneously capture the rate evolution along branches both within and between subtypes. From these estimates, we are able to directly infer the time of divergence between subtypes. As a trade-off for limited MCAs, the method requires an outgroup subtype to function as an origin relative to the subtypes under consideration. We feel that the triplet method provides a simple and widely applicable way to calculate the dates of divergence of rapidly evolving organisms without the pitfalls of the MCA.",

Additionally, the estimator of this method, a weighted sum of pairwise estimates, furnishes a defined variance for the time of the most common ancestor between subtypes. As a tradeoff for this increased precision, the structure of the triplet statistic requires an outgroup set of sequences, usually a closely related subtype. We apply this estimator to the case of influenza subtype divergence, considering three genes. We show that the estimated divergence time of subtypes A-H3N2 and B is more than a century later than those calculated with a molecular clock.",

The final expectation on the right hand side resolves by direct integration, We note that as the sampling time is independent of the rate of nucleotide substitution, the error increases in proportion to the magnitude of the initial statistic. We can then create a new, unbiased statistic by counterbalancing the original statistic with this factor, making a new statistic",
