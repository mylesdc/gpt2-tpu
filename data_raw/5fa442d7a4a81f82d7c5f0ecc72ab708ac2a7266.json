They also should include some discussion on influenza viruses as a possible contributor for seasonal pattern especially for URI. Moreover, the study period included 2009 when pandemic (H1N1) 2009 occurred. Significantly higher peak of URI in mid-2009 without any clear peak of LRI might be due to pandemic (H1N1) 2009. This point also should be discussed. 4) In low and middle-income countries, most of pediatric admissions are due to LRI, particularly pneumonia because IMCI guidelines are widely used to determine admission criteria. However, in this study, the large proportion of cases were patients with URI. Probably less severe cases are also admitted in Vietnam. I think some discussion would be useful to understand the situation in Vietnam. ",

However, in reality, in the three study hospitals, the decision to hospitalize ARI patients was not strictly based on IMCI guidelines and also depended on the preference of the patients' caregivers and the subjective patient evaluation of the attending physicians. Therefore, URIs contributed quite a large proportion (44%) of all ARI admissions in our data and many of those URI admissions were probably unnecessary.
