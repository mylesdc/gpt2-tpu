Previously, due to its \"complete insolubility\", the isolated NS3pro could not be experimentally studied and it remains elusive what structure it adopts without NS2B and why NS2B is indispensable. Here as facilitated by our previous discovery, the isolated NS3pro has been surprisingly deciphered by NMR to be the first intrinsically-disordered chymotrypsin-like fold, which exists in a loosely-packed state with non-native long-range interactions as revealed by paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). The disordered NS3pro appears to be needed for binding a human host factor to trigger the membrane remodeling. Moreover, we have in vitro refolded the NS3pro in complex with either NS2B (48-100) or the full-length NS2B (1-130) anchored into the LMPC micelle, and the two complexes have similar activities but different dynamics. We also performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the results revealed that NS2B shows the highest structural fluctuations in the complex, thus providing the dynamic basis for the observation on its conformational exchange between open and closed states. Remarkably, the NS2B cofactor plays a central role in maintaining the correlated motion network required for the catalysis as we previously decoded for the SARS 3CL protease. Indeed, a truncated NS2B (48-100;\u039477-84) with the flexible loop deleted is able to trap the NS2B-NS3pro complex in a highly dynamic and catalytically-impotent state. Taken together, our study implies potential strategies to perturb the NS2B-NS3pro interface for design of inhibitors for treating dengue infection.",

            "text": "The DENV genome is composed of an 11-kb single-stranded positive sense RNA. Upon infection, the RNA genome is translated into a large polyprotein by the host-cell translation machinery, that is subsequently processed into 10 proteins, including three structural proteins (capsid, membrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A/B, NS3, NS4A/B, and NS5). The structural proteins form the viral particle while the nonstructural proteins participate in the replication of the RNA genome, virion assembly, and attenuation of the host antiviral response. The cleavage of the polyprotein is carried out by host cell proteases including furin and signalaseas, as well as a virus-encoded serine protease NS2B-NS3pro, which has been established as a valuable target of therapeutic interest [5, 6] . The protease domain NS3pro consisting of the N-terminal part of NS3 adopts a chymotrypsin-like fold with two \u03b2-barrels, each composed of six \u03b2-strands, with the catalytic triad (His51-Asp75-Ser135) located at the cleft between the two \u03b2-barrels [7, 8] . Amazingly, unlike other proteases with a chymotrypsin-like fold, the flavivirus proteases including dengue protease, requires a stretch of approximately 40 amino acids from the cytosolic domain of NS2B for catalytic activity, thus called two-component protease [6] [7] [8] . Intriguingly, while the protease domains adopt highly similar structures in all crystal structures determined to date, the NS2B cofactors have been found to assume two distinctive structures, namely open (inactive) and closed (active) conformations by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "To understand why the NS2B cofactor is indispensable for activating the dengue NS3 protease is not only of fundamental interest for enzymology, but also bears considerable implications for design of molecules with high affinity and specificity to inhibit the protease [13, 14] . However, due to its \"complete insolubility\", it has been previously impossible to carry out any experimental studies on the isolated NS3pro domain. In 2005, we discovered that previously-thought \"insoluble proteins\" in fact could be solubilized in water with minimized salt ions [15] [16] [17] [18] , and therefore we have used this to study various previously-thought insoluble proteins including TDP-43 N-terminus [19] . Here with this approach, we have successfully characterized the solution conformations and dynamics of the isolated protease domain by CD, NMR and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). The results reveal that surprisingly the isolated NS3pro domain with the native sequence is intrinsically disordered without any stable secondary and tertiary structures, as well as has no detectable activity. Nevertheless, upon meeting the NS2B cofactor, the disordered NS3pro spontaneously folds into the well-structured and active enzyme highly similar to those co-expressed [10, 11] . We have also successfully refolded the NS3pro complexed with the full-length NS2B anchored into the LMPC micelle. To further decipher the roles of the NS2B cofactor in protein dynamics, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations which is very powerful in pinpointing the role of protein dynamics in the catalysis of proteases such as the SARS 3C-like protease [20, 21] . The correlation analysis reveals that the NS2B residues play a central role in coordinating the correlated motion network in the NS2B-NS3pro complex. Indeed, a truncated NS2B is able to form a buffer-soluble complex with NS3pro, but this complex is highly dynamic and catalytically-impotent. Our results imply that the discovery/ design of molecules to block the correct folding of the NS2B-NS3pro complex or/and to decouple its correlated motion network might represent promising strategies to inhibit the dengue protease, thus holding the considerable potential to treat dengue infections.",

The simulation cell is a periodic cubic box with a minimum distance of 10 \u00c5 between the protein and the box walls to ensure the protein would not directly interact with its own periodic images given the cutoff.

As shown in Fig 1A, NS3pro has very similar far-UV CD spectra in Milli-Q water (pH 4.0) and 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), with the maximal negative signal at 200 nm and no positive signal below 200 nm, which is typical of a predominantly disordered protein without any stable secondary structure. This indicates that the isolated NS3pro domain is highly disordered in aqueous solution. Indeed, the deconvolution of its CD spectrum reveals that the isolated NS3pro consists of 53% random coil, 14% turn, 29% extended strand and 4% helix secondary structures. Moreover, it has a HSQC spectrum with very narrow spectral dispersions at both 1 H (~0.9 ppm) and 15 N (~19 ppm) dimensions (Fig 1B) , further indicating the absence of tight tertiary packing.",

Further deconvolution shows that it contains 32% random coil, 24% turn, 7% extended strand and 37% helix secondary structures. Previously NS2B has been shown to have slightly different secondary structures in the open [7] and closed [8] states of the NS2B-NS3pro complexes. In the open (inactive) state (PDB ID: 2FOM), NS2B has a short helix over residues Glu62-Gly69 while in the closed (active) state (PDB ID: 3U1I), the NS2B only has \u03b2-strands but no helical segment. Therefore, it is possible that upon losing tertiary contacts with the NS3pro domain, the free-state NS2B has more helical conformations populated over residues Glu62-Gly69, or/and even has helical conformations populated over residues which adopt \u03b2strands in the NS2B-NS3pro complexes. Indeed, we previously observed that upon disrupting the all \u03b2-barrel native fold, the mutants of a SH3 domain became highly helical even over the residues which adopt \u03b2-strands in the native fold [31] . Unfortunately, HSQC peaks of the NS2B (48-100) are much more broadened than those of NS3pro, implying that the isolated NS2B (48-100) has dynamic aggregation or/and conformational exchanges on the \u03bcs-ms time scale, thus preventing from further high-resolution NMR studies.",

By contrast, the isolated NS3pro has dramatically decreased (\u0394C\u03b1-\u0394C\u03b2) over the whole sequence ( Fig 1C) . For example, many NS3pro residues in the complex have the absolute values of (\u0394C\u03b1-\u0394C\u03b2) > 4 ppm, while all isolated NS3pro residues have the absolute values of (\u0394C\u03b1-\u0394C\u03b2) < 2 ppm. Interestingly, many residues of the isolated NS3pro still have the (\u0394C\u03b1-\u0394C\u03b2) patterns similar to those in the complex, implying that similar secondary structures might be weakly populated over these residues. Indeed, we further analysed the NH, 15 N, C\u03b1 and C\u03b2 chemical shifts by Delta2D program [26] and the results indicate that the isolated NS3pro adopts highly-populated random coil conformations over the whole sequence. Nevertheless, over some short segments, the extended strand conformation is also populated to some degree but the helix conformation is almost lacking (Fig 1D) , completely consistent with the deconvolution result of the CD spectrum. Furthermore, as seen in Fig 1E, only sequential NOEs d NN(i,i+1) and d \u03b1N(i,i+1) manifest over the majority of the sequence, clearly indicating that the isolated NS3pro has no stable secondary structures and its NMR conformation represents an average of an ensemble of different structures. Taken together, CD and NMR results define the 172-residue NS3pro domain to be an intrinsically disordered protein which is lacking of both stable secondary and tertiary structures in the absence of the NS2B cofactor [22, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] .",

Previously, all except for several C-terminal residues of the complexed NS3pro were shown to have positive hNOE values, with many even close to 1, clearly indicating that the backbone of the NS3pro in the complex is very rigid [10] . By contrast, residues of the isolated NS3pro have small or even negative hNOEs (Fig 2A) , with an average hNOE of only 0.08. More specifically, all residues have hNOE values < 0.4, while many residues even have negative hNOE, such as N-/C-termini, Ser34-Gly39, Arg54-Arg64, Gln110-Ile139 and Arg157-Gly159 (Fig 2A) . This strongly suggests that the isolated NS3pro has largely unrestricted backbone motions on the ps-ns time scale, consistent with its absence of any stable secondary and tertiary structures.

Here, by site-directed mutagenesis, we introduced Cys residue into NS3pro one by one at three locations: Gln27, Glu86 and Ser158 (S1 Fig). Three single Cys mutants were subsequently labelled with the nitroxide free radical probe, MTSSL whose PRE were measured by HSQC (S1 Fig) as we previously described [18] . Fig 2B shows the intensity ratios of HSQC peaks from the oxidized (paramagnetic) and reduced (diamagnetic) spectra of Q27C mutant. Interestingly, the residues which were significant affected (ratio < 0.85) are all located in the first \u03b2-barrel of the chymotrypsin fold adopted by the NS3pro domain in the native NS2B-NS3pro complex (Fig 2C) . This suggests that these affected residues have long-range contacts with Cys27 with distances < 25 \u00c5. Interestingly, although residues Thr48-Glu66 assuming a short helix and \u03b2-sheet have very close contacts with Cys27 in the native structure, they were not significantly perturbed by the spin-label at Cys27. This strongly implies that the tertiary packing is non-native in the isolated NS3pro domain. The spin-label at the position 86 significantly affected the residues on both \u03b2-barrels (Fig 2D and 2E) , suggesting that these residues have long-range contacts to Cys86 with distances < 25 \u00c5. Again, many residues have very close contacts with Cys86 in the native fold but were not significantly perturbed by the spin-label at Cys88. The residues affected by the spin-label at the position 158 are mostly located on second \u03b2-barrel, the loop connecting two \u03b2barrels, and the last \u03b2-sheet over residues Ser68-Gly71 (Fig 2F and 2G) .",

On the other hand, only a small set of broad peaks could be detected in its HSQC spectrum (Fig 4B) , indicating that the NS3B (1-130) in the LMPC micelle undergoes significant conformational exchanges on \u03bcs-ms time scale, or/and dynamic aggregation, which thus prevents from further high-resolution NMR studies.

These residues were identified to be the C-terminal residues Glu173-Lys185 of NS3pro, which were not visible in crystal structures of the NS2B-NS3pro complexes, thus suggesting that they are similarly flexible in both complexes NS2B (40-100)-NS3pro in buffer and NS2B (1-130)-NS3pro in the LMPC micelle). On the other hand, some HSQC peaks of the NS3pro domain complexed with the NS2B (1-130) in the LMPC micelle are not superimposable to those in the NS2B (40-100)-NS3pro complex. This implies that these NS3pro residues may have different structures, or/and dynamics, or/and chemical environments in the NS2B (40-100)-NS3pro and NS2B (1-130)-NS3pro in the LMPC micelle. Furthermore the fact that most well-dispersed HSQC peaks disappeared (Fig 4C) implies that the NS3pro may undergoes significant conformational exchanges on \u03bcs-ms time scale upon being anchored in the LMPC micelle. Nevertheless, the NS2B (1-130)-NS3pro in the LMPC micelle is similarly active, with Km = 101.1 \u00b1 3.163 \u03bcM and Kcat = 0.2469 \u00b1 0.003 s -1 , which are very similar to the activity of the NS3pro in complex with the NS2B (48-100) with transmembrane regions deleted.",

            "text": "Molecular dynamics simulation is a powerful tool to gain insights into protein dynamics and folding/unfolding that underlies protein functions. Although it remains extremely challenging to simulate the folding/unfolding for large proteins such as NS3pro, which usually occurs on the ms-s time scale, short MD simulations in conjunction with the correlation analysis are able to capture the low-frequency correlated motions, which have been recently found to be essential for the catalysis of the SARS 3C-like protease [20, 21] . Therefore, to understand the role of the cofactor in the dynamics of the dengue NS3 protease, we conducted 20-ns MD simulations for both NS2B-NS3pro complex and isolated NS3pro respectively. Here we used the crystal structure of the NS2B-NS3pro complex (PDB code: 2FOM) with an open conformation [7] for MD simulations, because this complex has sequences almost identical to what we studied here, with only one and two conserved residue variations respectively as compared to our NS3pro and NS2B constructs. Furthermore, in this structure, the NS2B cofactor assumes an open conformation, thus has a minimal contact surface with the NS3pro domain as compared to other structures with the closed conformation. This would facilitate the identification of the most important residues of the NS2B in mediating the dynamics of the protease complex. Fig 5A and 5B present the structure snapshots in the first MD simulations for the NS3pro alone and the NS2B-NS3pro complex, showing that within 20 ns, both isolated NS3pro domain and that in the complex remains dynamically stable, in particular over the regions with regular secondary structures. By contrast, the NS2B cofactor has large structural fluctuations, particularly over the residues Thr77-Met84 which are invisible in all previous crystal structures with an open conformation. Fig 5C-5E show the root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of C\u03b1 atoms (from their positions in the energy minimized structures) for three independent simulations of the isolated NS3pro, the NS2B and NS3pro in the context of the complex respectively, and Fig   Fig 5. Overall dynamic behaviors in the MD simulations. Structure snapshots (one structure for 2-ns interval) of the first MD simulations respectively for the isolated NS3pro (A) and NS2B-NS3pro complex (B). Root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of the C\u03b1 atoms (from their positions in the energy minimized structures) for three independent MD simulations of the isolated NS3pro (C), the NS3pro (D) and NS2B (E) in the context of the NS2B-NS3pro complex. (F) RMSD trajectories averaged over three independent MD simulations of the isolated NS3pro (blue), the NS3pro (red) and NS2B (cyan) in the context of the NS2B-NS3pro complex. 5F shows their averaged RMSD trajectories. The averaged RMSD values are 1.85 \u00b1 0.23, 1.56 \u00b1 0.22 and 4.40 \u00b1 0.71 \u00c5 respectively for the isolated NS3pro, the NS3pro and NS2B in the context of the complex. This clearly indicates that upon removing NS2B, the isolated NS3pro domain will have higher conformational dynamics even within the 20-ns simulations. As such, it is expected that the isolated NS3pro domain may become unfolded if the simulations could reach ms-s time scale. On the other hand, even in the context of the complex, the NS2B cofactor has much higher structural fluctuations than NS3pro, implying that the bound NS2B cofactor is still capable to sample a large ensemble of conformations. The high flexibility of NS2B uncovered by MD simulations here is completely consistent with the invisibility of many cofactor residues in crystal structures and also provides a dynamic basis for the conformational exchange of NS2B between open and closed conformations as previously observed [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

Remarkably, a mutation N214A on the extra domain which is far away from the active site is sufficient to decouple the correlated motions and consequently leads to the inactivation of the enzymatic catalysis. Here, the correlation analysis of the MD simulation trajectories revealed that like the SARS 3C-like protease, a global correlation network does exist in the NS2B-NS3pro complex. Most strikingly, in this network, the majority of the significant correlated motions are established between the cofactor and NS3pro residues ( Fig 7A) . Surprisingly, although the cofactor residues Ser44-Glu63, Ser75-Thr94 are highly dynamic in the MD simulations, and Thr77-Met84 are even missing in all crystal structures of the open form, they were revealed to play a key role in coordinating the correlated motions with the NS3pro residues Asp20-Gln28, Gly39-Gly44, Met59-Glu66, Ly84-Val95, Pro106-Gln110, and Lys145-Gly148, which cover not only the residues having direct contacts with the cofactor, but also residues located far away from the cofactor (Fig 7B and 7C ). Furthermore, the global correlation network is largely eliminated as uncovered by the correlation analysis of the MD trajectories of the isolated NS3pro with the NS2B cofactor removed (Fig 7D) , which is similar to what was observed on the inactivated N214A mutant of the SARS 3C-like protease [19, 20] . Therefore, as implied by our previous results with the SARS 3C-like protease, slight manipulations of the NS2B-NS3pro interface may be sufficient to decouple the correlation network to inactivate the activity of the dengue protease.",

Therefore, we generated a truncated NS2B (48-100;\u039477-84) in which the residues Thr77-Met84 were replaced by three Gly residues and subsequently conducted the refolding of NS2B (48-100;\u039477-84) with NS3pro using the same protocol for refolding of NS2B . Interestingly, although the isolated NS3pro is completely insoluble in buffer, the NS3pro became highly soluble in buffer at pH 7.5 in the presence of NS2B (48-100;\u039477-84). This suggests that NS3pro forms a complex with NS2B (48-100;\u039477-84) and the complex is soluble in buffer. Indeed, as shown in, the decovolution analysis of the far-UV CD spectrum (Fig 8A) reveals that the NS2B (48-100;\u039477-84)-NS3pro complex contains 19% helix, much higher than those of the isolated NS3pro (4%), and NS2B (48-100)-NS3pro complex (8%).

Most strikingly, the NS2B (48-100;\u039477-84)-NS3pro complex had no detectable catalytic activity even with a concentration up to 10 \u03bcM in buffers at pH 7.5, suggesting that this complex is trapped in a highly-dynamic and catalytically impotent state.",

Indeed, drugs have been successfully developed to treat HIV and HCV infections by targeting their proteases [44, 45] . The Dengue NS3 protease has its catalytic machinery hosted by a chymotrypsin fold, which has been extensively shared by a variety of proteases. On the other hand, unlike most other chymotrypsin-like proteases, only flavivirus proteases including dengue NS3 protease need an additional cofactor NS2B to form the enzymatically active complex. Noticeably, even within the flavivirus proteases, the NS2B cofactors are very divergent, only with sequence identity of~19% among different members [6] . So the NS2B-NS3pro interface may represent an attractive target for developing molecules which specifically inhibit flavivirus proteases. However, due to its \"complete insolubility\", the isolated NS3pro domain has never been experimentally characterized so far.",

            "text": "In the present study, as facilitated by our discovery in 2005 [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , for the first time, the isolated NS3pro domain has been extensively characterized in solution by CD, NMR and PRE. The results decipher an unexpected fact that despite owning a high-complexity sequence which is very different from classic IUPs [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] , the NS3pro with the native sequence is intrinsically disordered without the NS2B cofactor, with no stable secondary structures and tight tertiary packing. This indicates that the isolated NS3pro becomes completely insoluble in buffers by following the same mechanism as we previously established for other \"completely insoluble\" proteins [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Nevertheless, in the presence of the NS2B cofactor, the disordered NS3pro domain folds into the well-structured chymotrypsin-like fold hosting the active catalytic machinery by the \"binding-coupled folding\" mechanism [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Previously, the chymotrypsin fold has been found to be an autonomous folding unit even in the context of the SARS 3Clike protease with an extra domain [46] . Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, the NS3pro domain represents the first intrinsically-disordered chymotrypsin-like fold which absolutely requests the additional cofactor to achieve its correct folding. So an interesting question is whether being intrinsically disordered for the isolated NS3pro bears any in vivo relevance? Interestingly, a recent study has revealed that the dengue NS3pro domain without NS2B was capable of binding human fatty acid synthase (FASN) to trigger the membrane remodelling [47] . As such, our biophysical results imply that this interaction needs the dengue NS3pro to be largely disordered. Indeed, we found that the well-folded NS2B-NS3pro complex only had weak binding to the FASN domain. Furthermore, DENV and other members of the Flaviviridae family are dependent on the host ER to translate, replicate and package their genome, and their infection has been found to induce significant rearrangements of intracellular membranes [47] [48] [49] [50] . In particular it has been recently revealed that the rearrangement and expansion of the ER appear to be driven by viral but not host protein synthesis early after DENV infection, independently of the UPR or SREBP2 pathways [50] . Therefore, on a speculative note, we propose that the highly disordered NS3pro itself might also play a role in triggering the early rearrangement of the ER before activating specific pathways [50] . Previously, we have shown that the ALS-causing P56S mutation of the ER-anchored VAPB protein rendered the well-structured \u03b2-barrel fold of its MSP domain to be highly disordered and also become \"completely insoluble\" in buffer [51] , similar to what we found here on the isolated NS3pro. Remarkably, the P56S-VAPB suddenly gained the novel capacity to remodel the ER structure which was not observed for the wild-type VAPB [52] . Therefore, the disordered human P56S-VAPB and dengue NS3pro may use similar mechanisms to remodel the ER structure. In fact, the degue NS3 protein itself is also anchored into the ER membrane before NS3 forms the catalytically-active complex with NS2B to cleave itself from the polyprotein.",

Strikingly, the NS2B residues show much higher structural dynamics than NS3pro even in the complex, suggesting that the cofactor is capable of sampling a large ensemble of conformations, thus providing the dynamic mechanism for the observed conformational exchange of NS2B between open and closed conformations [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "The correlated motions in proteins have been extensively recognized to be critical for their diverse functions [20, 21, 30, 53] . In particular, we have recently revealed that a global correlated motion network was essential for the catalysis of the SARS 3C-like protease [20, 21] , which also utilizes the chymotrypsin fold to harbour its catalytic machinery. More specifically, without altering the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, the N214A mutation on the extra domain is sufficient to inactivate the catalytic machinery by globally decoupling the correlation network, while the STI/A mutations also on the extra domain enhance the catalytic machinery by altering the correlation network pattern [20, 21] . In the present study, a similar scenario has been observed for the dengue NS2B-NS3pro complex. A global correlation network does exist in the NS2B-NS3 complex. Most intriguingly, this global correlation network is mostly coordinated by the NS2B residues which have very high structural dynamics. As such, the MD results not only rationalizes the central role of the NS2B cofactor in maintaining the dynamic stability of the NS3pro domain, but further implies that a slight perturbation of the NS2B-NS3pro interface may be sufficient to decouple the correlation network to inactive the catalytic machinery of the dengue NS2B-NS3pro protease, as we found on the N214A mutation of the SARS 3Clike protease [20, 21] . Indeed, by deleting the NS2B residues highly flexible in MD simulations, we obtained a truncated NS2B (48-100;\u039477-84), which is able to trap the NS2B-NS3pro complex in a catalytically-impotent state with significant \u03bcs-ms dynamics. In the further, it would be of significant interest to test whether this truncated NS2B can act as a specific inhibitor of the dengue protease in vivo.",

            "text": "Despite the success in treating viral infections with inhibitors to target the active sites of HIV and HCV proteases [41] [42] [43] , many challenges/difficulties still remain for this approach. For example, the structural architecture and catalytic mechanism of viral proteases are also largely shared by many human proteases. This makes it extremely challenging to design inhibitors which only specifically bind to viral proteases but not to human ones. Moreover, there is an addition challenge associated with the dengue NS3pro protease. It has been proposed that the flat and charged nature of its active site may at least partly contribute to the current failure in developing effective inhibitors [7, 45] . To overcome these difficulties, alternative strategies are requested to targets sites other than the active sites of the viral proteases, such as to inhibit the dimerization required for activity [46] , to trigger allosteric inhibition [45] , or even to block the folding of the protease [54] . In this regard, our present study successfully implies potential strategies to perturb the NS2B-NS3pro interface for future developing effective and specific inhibitors for the dengue protease. More specifically, inhibitory molecules might be developed to: 1) trap the NS2B-mediated folding into an inactive intermediate as exemplified by the truncated NS2B; and 2) decouple the global correlation network of the NS2B-NS3pro complex. Furthermore, our success in in vitro refolding of the active NS3pro in complex with both NS2B (48-100) in buffer and NS2B in the micelle provides experimental platforms for implementing the above-proposed approaches of inhibitor design as well as to decode the underlying mechanism for inhibitors obtained by high through-put screening. For example, recently the dengue protease inhibitors were identified by high through-put screening, which were implied to target the NS2B-NS3pro interface by in silico prediction or mutagenesis [55, 56] . It would be of significant interest to delineate how these molecules achieve the inhibitory effect: by trapping the folding or modulating the dynamics of the protease complex, if they directly target the NS2B-NS3pro interface.",
