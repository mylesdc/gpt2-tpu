Here, we examine how heterogeneity in contact shapes the genealogies of parasitic agents. Using extensive simulations, we find that contact heterogeneity can have a strong effect on how the structure of genealogies reflects epidemiologically relevant quantities such as the proportion of a population that is infected. Comparing the simulations to BEAST reconstructions, we also find that contact heterogeneity can increase the number of sequence isolates required to estimate these quantities over the course of an epidemic. Our results suggest that data about contact-network structure will be required in addition to sequence data for accurate estimation of a parasitic agent's genealogy. We conclude that network models will be important for progress in this area.",

So coalescent analysis of molecular data [3] provided a valuable and largely independent line of evidence that the increase in outbreaks was real.

In this paper, we use the term parasite to refer to all such infectious agents, including bacteria and viruses. The genealogy of these parasites must fit inside the tree of infections that forms as the parasite spreads from host to host, and this tree of infections must fit inside the host population's contact network.

First, we build contact networks with different levels of heterogeneity. Then, we simulate the spread of parasites through the networks, generating epidemic dynamics and a genealogy of the parasite with each simulation. Then, we use the BEAST software package [12] to produce Bayesian skyride [13] reconstructions of parasite population dynamics based on the simulated genealogies. We also use the framework of Volz et al. [11] to predict the skyride reconstructions based on the simulated epidemic dynamics. We explain how the contact-network structure affects the epidemic dynamics that, in turn, affect the predicted reconstructions. The close agreement between the predicted skyrides and the skyride reconstructions validates this explanation. We also examine how much of the simulated genealogy the skyride reconstruction requires as input in order to produce a reconstruction that agrees with the theoretical prediction.",

The number of nodes in the network was kept at 10,000, and the mean degree (degree is the number of edges coming out of a node) was kept at 4. The networks were built to be either regular, meaning that all nodes have the same degree, or with degree distributions sampled from Poisson, exponential, or Pareto distributions. The minimum degree in the Pareto networks was 1. The regular networks served as models with zero heterogeneity, Poisson networks as models with heterogeneity similar to a Poisson process, exponential networks as models with heterogeneity similar to a variety of social networks [14] , and Pareto networks (scale-free networks) as models with the extreme levels of heterogeneity that might be found in sexual contact networks [15] .

In the coalescent process, each pair of lineages in the sample coalesces into a common ancestral lineage at a constant rate. When time is measured in units of generations, this rate is the reciprocal of the effective population size. So the rate at which any of the pairs coalesces is equal to the number of pairs of lineages divided by the effective population size.",

Keeping the extent of sampling equal and increasing heterogeneity compressed the coalescent events in the sampled genealogy into the beginning of the epidemic. Figure 2 shows a representative example of this general trend that holds across intermediate levels of sampling. Consequently, increasing heterogeneity has a similar effect to reducing the proportion of nodes sampled: the time at which the prediction of the skyride based on prevalence and incidence diverges from the estimated skyride based on the genealogy occurs earlier. Figure 3 shows how differences in the scaling of prevalence of the skyride follows from differences in trajectories of prevalence and incidence. The ratio of prevalence to incidence is the expected time until an infected host transmits infection, and we here define it as the generation time (5). In Figure 3 , we see that generation times are at, or quickly reach, a minimum after an epidemic begins and then gradually increase until the epidemic ends. In the regular networks, the decline in the number of susceptible hosts over the course of the epidemic causes this increase to happen. In the other networks, which have hosts of varying degree, infection first moves to the high-degree hosts and then to progressively lower-and lower-degree hosts [26] [27] [28] . Because the degree of a host determines how much his/her infection increases incidence, this movement of infection from high-to lowdegree hosts translates into generation times being at first shorter and then longer in heterogeneous networks relative to regular networks (Figure 3 ).

Additionally, as is well known by practitioners of phylogenetics, substitution rates set fundamental limits on the amount of phylogenetic information that sequences may contain.

            "text": "It may be possible to work around the second problem by collecting sequences over time such that there are no branching points in the tree that are too far from every pair of tips. For the first problem, there is simply no information that the sequences alone can provide, and additional knowledge of events in the chain of infection is necessary to determine the infection tree. The panels labeled \"Time to coalescence\" in Figure 3 show that this additional information is most likely to be needed early in the epidemic and when there is a large amount of variance in the contact network. It is then perhaps fortunate that contacttracing methods are practiced by many health departments for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) [41, 42] , which are thought to have higher contact heterogeneity than airborne diseases [15] . However, we probably need more widespread practice of contact tracing for large genealogies Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Infectious Diseases to be assembled. A recent survey of physicians in the United States [43] found that less than one-third of physicians routinely screen patients for STDs and many physicians relied on patients to notify health departments and partners, and similar surveys in other countries [42, 44, 45] likewise indicate that contact tracing is not a routine in general medical care of STDs. There also may be a need for contact tracing to establish the genealogy for airborne infections because many airborne transmissions may occur in a single day during which a single strain may be dominant in a host, as the superspreading events in the 2003 SARS-coronavirus outbreak demonstrated [46] . Contact tracing is also practiced for airborne diseases. It has been used to help contain the SARScoronavirus outbreak [47] , smallpox [48] , and tuberculosis [49] . Given that contacts for airborne diseases can be quite transient, it seems that, even with the addition of contacttracing data, we may generally know less about parasite genealogies for airborne diseases compared to STDs. On the upside, our results suggest that the ability to reconstruct early parts of the epidemic is robust to much pruning of the full genealogy ( Figure 1 ). However, this robustness may depend on our sampling scheme. Using discrete-time simulations, Stack et al. [50] found that the difference between reconstructed prevalence and simulated prevalence depended largely on how the samples were distributed over the course of the epidemic. Also, it is unclear how any of our sampling levels might compare to realistic amounts of contact tracing and molecular data for a specific infectious disease.",

            "text": "In addition to being necessary to fill gaps in molecular data, contact tracing may be necessary because genealogies do not always match infection trees. Such discordance is likely to occur when there is relatively little time between transmissions. When there is little time for a mutant to become fixed between transmissions, the order in which alleles at loci of a sequence appear in transmitting inocula (or sequence isolates) need not match the order in which the alleles appeared in the within-host population. Measures of within-host viral load and sequence diversity may be informative of the chance of such discordance. If populations tend to be large and diverse, then sequence data may be useless for reconstructing the recent details of chains of infection but still useful in reconstructing deeper branches in the tree. Sequence data from diverse within-host populations could also be useful in parameter estimation for coalescent models (e.g., [51] ) that include the within-host dynamics of the parasite. Two properties that parasites may have that would help increase the chance that infection trees and genealogies match are a low level of diversity in transmitting inocula (i.e., a strong bottleneck effect at transmission) and reduction of diversity in an incubation period that precedes all transmission. In our simulations, we also knew the variance of the degree distribution. We do have some data about the structure of contact networks for some systems. We have survey data about human sexual-contact networks (e.g., [52, 53] ) and survey data about networks of close, but not sexual, human contacts [54] [55] [56] . Researchers have used field data to construct hypothetical contact networks for wildlife and vector-borne diseases (e.g., [57, 58] ), and researchers have also used census data to construct hypothetical contact networks for human diseases (e.g., [59, 60] ). It seems likely, however, that in the analysis of real sequence data the heterogeneity of the contact network will be at least as uncertain as disease incidence and prevalence. Thus, estimation of contact heterogeneity may be an important goal of the analysis. We note that previous work (e.g., [61] ) has also discussed the potential use of sequence data to estimate contact heterogeneity.",
