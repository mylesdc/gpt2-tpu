We conducted adult SARI surveillance in Blantyre, Malawi. From January 2011 to December 2013, individuals aged \u00b3 15 years with SARI (both inpatients and outpatients) were enrolled at a large teaching hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. We estimated hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI incidence rates and assessed factors associated with influenza positivity and clinical severity (Modified Early Warning Score > 4). We enrolled 1,126 SARI cases; 163 (14.5%) were positive for influenza. Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence was 50.3%. Annual incidence of hospital-attended influenza-associated SARI was 9.7-16.8 cases per 100,000 population. Human immunodeficiency virus was associated with a 5-fold greater incidence (incidence rate ratio 4.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.83-6.32). On multivariable analysis, female gender, as well as recruitment in hot, rainy season (December to March; adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.82, 95% CI: 1.57-5.06) and cool, dry season (April to August; aOR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.35-4.15), was associated with influenza positivity, whereas influenza-positive patients were less likely to be HIV-infected (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.43-0.80) or have viral coinfection (aOR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.36-0.73). Human immunodeficiency virus infection (aOR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.35-2.56) and recruitment in hot, rainy season (aOR: 4.98, 95% CI: 3.17-7.81) were independently associated with clinical severity. In this high HIV prevalence population, influenza was associated with nearly 15% of hospital-attended SARI. Human immunodeficiency virus infection is an important risk factor for clinical severity in all-cause and influenza-associated SARI. Expanded access to HIV testing and antiretroviral treatment, as well as targeted influenza vaccination, may reduce the burden of SARI in Malawi and other high HIV prevalence settings.",

            "text": "Pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in adults in sub-Saharan Africa. 1 However, the burden of severe respiratory illness and the contribution of influenza and other respiratory viruses are not well documented in the region. Lack of diagnostic capacity, similarity of influenza presentation with common febrile illnesses such as malaria and bacterial pneumonia, and prioritization of other high-burden public health problems are likely contributory factors. A recent systematic review concluded that most of the sub-Saharan African countries had insufficient epidemiological data to develop rational strategies for influenza prevention and control. 2 It is, therefore, unsurprising that although the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends seasonal influenza vaccine for high-risk groups, such as young children, pregnant women, and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, 3 few African countries have implemented these recommendations or have national policies. 4 Following the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, respiratory viral surveillance capacity has increased substantially in Africa. 5 Currently, 23 sub-Saharan African countries contribute data to the WHO Global Surveillance and Response System. 6 Emerging data suggest that influenza viruses are frequently detected in mild (6.7-40.4%) and severe (4.6-25.5%) acute respiratory presentations in the region 7 and are associated with a higher mortality compared with developed settings because of the high prevalence of HIV infection and other comorbidities. 8 However, only a handful of studies have focused on adults 9, 10 and few have comprehensively ascertained HIV status.",

Malawi has hot rainy (mean temperature > 22\u00b0C and rainfall > 100 mm; December to March), cool and dry (mean temperature < 22\u00b0C and rainfall < 50 mm; April to August), and hot and dry (mean temperature > 22\u00b0C and rainfall < 50 mm; September to November) seasons. The Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) is the only government inpatient facility providing free health care to the 1.3 million residents of Blantyre District. Consequently, most individuals requiring hospitalization from this community will present to QECH. Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence in Blantyre is estimated at 17.7%, 12 but up to 74% of patients admitted to the QECH medical wards are HIV infected. 13 Malaria is endemic in Malawi (peak transmission months January to June), and malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) positivity is 8% among adult inpatients at QECH. 14 Lower respiratory tract infections are the commonest cause of medical admission at QECH. 13 There is no national influenza vaccination policy in Malawi. A WHO-led influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 vaccine campaign targeting health-care workers and pregnant women occurred in 2010. 15 Study procedures. Patients aged 15 years and older presenting to the QECH Emergency Department during surveillance hours (8 AM to 3 PM on weekdays) were screened for study eligibility.

Among adults with SARI, female gender, in addition to recruitment in hot, rainy and cool, dry seasons, were associated with influenza positivity. Although HIV-infected adults with SARI were more likely to have an alternative etiology to influenza, HIV-infected adults aged 15-49 years had a 5-fold greater incidence of hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI compared with HIV-uninfected adults. Furthermore, HIV infection predicted clinical severity in all-cause SARI and influenza-associated SARI.",

Furthermore, the latter two studies included children aged 5-14 years, a group that typically has higher rates of influenza infection. 9, 24 It is important to stress that our incidence estimates represent minimum estimates because our surveillance only detected persons accessing care at QECH. A small proportion of patients may have presented to a traditional healer or to one of the two private hospitals in Blantyre; SARI cases may not consider their symptoms severe enough to warrant care; they may be too ill or too poor to attend, or may have died before presentation. 25 Human immunodeficiency virus infection, identified in more than 50% of adults with SARI, was the sole individual risk factor associated with increased clinical severity. Indeed, several African adult pneumonia cohorts have reported a high prevalence of HIV infection (52-94%). [26] [27] [28] Our result supports findings from others that HIV is an important driver of severe respiratory infection, 29 including influenza, in sub-Saharan Africa.",

            "text": "Influenza was less commonly identified in HIV-infected compared with HIV-uninfected SARI cases. This likely reflects the different spectra of organisms affecting HIV-infected adults, with greater relative contribution of opportunistic pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, rather than a lower absolute risk. This has also been described in HIV-infected children 30 and adults 10 in South Africa. In fact, after taking into account population denominators, HIV-infected adults aged 15-49 years had a 5-fold greater incidence of influenza-positive SARI than HIV-uninfected adults. Having comprehensively ascertained HIV status, our study corroborates with studies in Malawi, Kenya, and South Africa that have identified HIV as a major risk factor for influenza burden 25 and severe disease. 24, 31, 32 These results suggest that early HIV testing and expanded access to antiretroviral treatment, in addition to targeted influenza vaccination, could potentially have a substantial impact on burden of SARI in urban Blantyre and other similar high HIV prevalence settings. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for HIV-infected individuals. 3 Influenza vaccination in HIV-infected adults is safe and effective (pooled efficacy 85%), 33 but influenza vaccines are currently unavailable in most African countries. 4, 34 SARI cases recruited in hot, rainy season were associated with a 5-fold increased odds of clinical severity, compared with those recruited in the hot, dry season. This was also observed in our pediatric surveillance. 16 The reason for this is unclear but could be related to other unmeasured infections (we were unable to determine the presence of bacterial pathogens in our SARI cases), seasonal patterns of health-care utilization, and seasonal malnutrition. The hot, rainy season in Malawi coincides with the \"lean\" season before harvest. 35 A recent casecontrol study in Malawi identified food insecurity as a risk factor for influenza severity, 31 thus supporting our latter hypothesis. We identified at least one respiratory virus in nearly half of all SARI cases, higher than that described in South African adults, 10 and in developed settings. 36 ,37 Viral coinfections were common, occurring in 14% of adult SARI cases. We also found a nonsignificant trend toward increased severity in adults with viral coinfection (26.7% versus 20.3% with MEWS > 4, P = 0.11). There is growing recognition that viruses other than influenza, such as rhinovirus, adenovirus, hMPV, and parainfluenza viruses, can cause clinically severe disease. However, whereas the detection of influenza, RSV, and hMPV in adults with SARI likely indicates an etiologic role, 38, 39 the presence of other respiratory viruses is of uncertain significance, particularly as we did not enroll accompanying controls. Further understanding of the interactions and contribution of these viruses to severe respiratory disease will help to narrow the focus on pertinent targets for vaccine and antiviral development.",

            "text": "Our study has a number of limitations. First, we conducted single-site hospital-based surveillance. Although there are no other large inpatient facilities in Blantyre, we have not sampled from elsewhere in Malawi. Second, limiting recruitment to the first four cases of the day could have resulted in selection bias because individuals who present to hospital at different times of the day may have varying characteristics, such as healthseeking behavior or distance of residence from hospital. Third as discussed earlier, patients with SARI could have sought health care in facilities other than QECH, leading to an underestimation of our influenza-associated SARI rates. Underascertainment of SARI cases and resultant underestimation of incidence were also possible if SARI cases were not systematically recorded onto SPINE. Fourth, although we had nearcomplete ascertainment of HIV status (98.5%), data on CD4 + cell count and antiretroviral treatment status were not available. Comorbidities were also poorly recorded; thus, we were unable to evaluate chronic lung disease as a potential risk factor for influenza or adjust for underlying comorbidities in the multivariable analysis for clinical severity. Last, data on hospitalization and mortality were not systematically captured. Instead, we used the MEWS score as a surrogate marker for clinical severity. The score has been widely used in developed health-care settings to identify patients at risk of deterioration, and a threshold of greater than four is predictive of inpatient mortality. 19 It has also been validated in other African settings. 21, 22 This study provides a baseline for understanding the complexities of SARI epidemiology in adults in Malawi and other similar settings. In this high HIV prevalence setting, respiratory viruses were commonly identified in adults with SARI and influenza has a prominent etiological role. Human immunodeficiency virus-infected adults are at particular risk of severe disease and have a higher burden of influenzaassociated SARI than HIV-uninfected individuals. Ongoing surveillance for influenza and other respiratory viruses, with specific focus on severe disease in high-risk groups such as HIV-infected individuals and pregnant women, and greater effort to capture outcome data are critical to further characterize disease burden in these high-risk groups to inform public policy decisions. Improved HIV testing and early ART initiation, as well as targeted influenza vaccination could potentially substantially reduce the burden of SARI in Malawi and other sub-Saharan African countries with high HIV prevalence.",
