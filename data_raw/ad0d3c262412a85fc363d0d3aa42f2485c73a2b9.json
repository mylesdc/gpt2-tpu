            "text": "Phylogenetic tree analysis and comparative studies of taxa are essential parts of modern molecular biology. Phylogenetic reconstruction and comparative sequence analysis traditionally depend on multiple or pairwise sequence alignments. However, various limitations are encountered when analyzing large datasets using an alignment based approach. Whole genome alignment of higher eukaryotes can exceed computational resources. Moreover, factors such as the combinatorics of genomic rearrangements and duplications make the alignment of entire genomes impossible. Therefore, the alignable homologous segments of the genomes under study have to be identified in the initial steps. Recently, large amounts of sequence data produced by next-generation sequencing techniques have become available in private and public databases, which has created new challenges due to the limitations associated with alignment based approaches. This plethora of sequence information increases the computation and time requirements for genome comparisons in computational biology. Therefore, there is a high need for faster sequence analysis algorithms. For this, various methods have been proposed to overcome the limitations of alignment based approach 1-3 , and is termed as alignment-free methods. The alignment-free methods are not only used in phylogenetic studies 4,5 , but also for metagenomics 6-11 , analysis of regulatory elements 12-14 , protein classification 15,16 , sequence assembly 17 , isoform quantification from transcriptome data 18 , and to identify biomarkers in diagnostic tests 19 . The alignment-free methods fall into two broad categories: methods based on k-mer or word frequency, and methods based on match length 20 . Methods based on k-mer or word frequency are quite popular and studied extensively. The k-mer based methods were developed to compare DNA sequences, in which it counts the frequencies of substrings with k letters occurring in respective sequences 21 . In recent past, a lot of k-mer based methods have been proposed and implemented in sequence analysis and phylogeny, such as, feature frequency profile (FFP) 22 , return time distribution (RTD) 23 , frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) 24 , an improved complete composition vector method (ICCV) 25 , composition vector (CV) 26 and complete composition vector (CCV) 27 . For sequence comparison, ICCV method is more efficient and robust compared to CV and CCV methods. The other category of the alignment-free method is based on match lengths, where it employs the similarity of substrings between two sequences 28-31 . Examples of match length methods are, k-mismatch average common substring 32 , average common substring 28 , K r -method 28 , etc. These methods are commonly used for string processing in computer science. In this study, we propose to use fuzzy integral 33 to analyze DNA sequences based on a Markov chain 34 , which can be categorised as k-mer or word frequency method. The fuzzy integral similarity method 35,36 assigns a similarity score between two DNA sequences based on the estimated parameters of a Markov chain. A DNA sequence consists of four characters (A, T, G and C). By taking the state space as S = {A, T, G, C}, we used the k-th step transition probability matrix, a fuzzy measure 37 and fuzzy integral to describe the DNA sequences. We used the fuzzy integral similarity to obtain a distance matrix, which was used in the neighbor program in the PHYLIP package 38 to construct a phylogenetic tree. The similar fuzzy integral similarity approach was taken by 36 . However in 36 , the method of feature vector extraction from the DNA sequences is different from our method. In both our method and 36 , the extracted features are used as an input for the fuzzy integral similarity analysis. The proposed method is tested on 18S rDNA sequences from 11 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi isolates and 16S rDNA sequences from 40 bacterial isolates, and also tested on the following benchmark datasets, 41 mammalian mitochondrial genomes, 59 ebolavirus complete genomes, 30 coronavirus whole genomes, 30 bacterial whole genomes, 48 Hepatitis E virus (HEV) whole genomes, 24 Eutherian mammals sequences, 58 genome datasets from different species and 29 Escherichia/Shigella complete genomes. The method was also tested on large mammalian dataset. In addition, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 39-41 curve for measuring the performance of our method to compare the other alignment-free methods from Alfree repository 2 . The consistency can also be seen from the statistical analysis such as AUC (area under the ROC) values, calculated from ROC curves provided in Supplementary Material.",

If the total number of each adjacent nucleotide pair (s i , s j ) in the sequence is denoted by N s s i j , then the 1 st -step transition probability from state s i to state s j is estimated as represents the total number of each adjacent pair starting from nucleotide s i and ending with nucleotide s j .",

In other words, the fuzzy measure value of a given subset is not simply the summation of the measures of its elements. Therefore, to define a fuzzy measure, we need to know the fuzzy densities of each element of the measured set and the measure of each combination. This measure can be provided by an expert or extracted from the problem definition. However, when dealing with a set of numerous elements, this job may become noisy, tedious or even unfeasible. A possible solution to this problem is to use a \u03bb -fuzzy measure.

The length of sequences ranges from seven thousands to several millions base pairs. In order to compare and analyze various genomic data, we generated a distance matrix using Eq. (12) for each distinct step k using the method described above. We increased step k until we obtained the same distance matrix for two consecutive distinct k(suppose k = h and h + 1, where h is a fixed integer), (i.e., the root mean square distance 47 between two distance matrices generated by step h and h + 1 should be zero). Therefore, we considered k = h an optimal step and generate the phylogenetic tree at step k = h using the PHYLIP package. Here, we use the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) approach in the PHYLIP package 38 to generate the phylogenetic tree. To test the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we selected ten sets of test data: (i) 18S rDNA sequences from 11 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi isolates, (ii) 16S rDNA sequences from 40 bacterial isolates, (iii) 41 mammalian mitochondrial genomes, (iv) 59 ebolavirus complete genomes, (v) 30 coronavirus whole genomes, (vi) 30 bacterial whole genomes, (vii) 48 Hepatitis E virus (HEV) whole genomes, www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (viii) 24 Eutherian mammals sequences, (ix) 58 genome datasets from different species and (x) 29 Escherichia/ Shigella complete genomes.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (which is also called an AM fungi (AMF) or endomycorrhiza) is a type of mycorrhiza in which the fungus infects vascular plants by penetrating the cortical cells of the root. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are characterized by the formation of unique structures (arbuscules) and vesicles, these fungi belong to phylum glomeromycota. Arbuscular mycorrhizas fungi help plants to capture nutrients, such as www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen and micronutrients, from soil. The development of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is believed to have played a crucial role in the initial colonization of plants on land and in the evolution of vascular plants 48 . We built a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) using the optimal step k = 8 of 11 AMF sequences listed in Table S1 . To compare our method with an alignment-based method, we also constructed the phylogenetic tree (Fig. S1 ) by ClustalW method using MEGA package 49 . We characterized 11 AMF sequences based on their families and genera. All rhizophagus genera belonging to family glomeraceae were clustered together in cluster (a), except one genus of rhizophagus (i.e., the \"15 Rhi in\" sequence belongs to cluster (d)). All glomus genera belonging to family glomeraceae were clustered in cluster (b). All gigaspora genera belonging to family gigasporaceae were clustered in cluster (c). While comparing the tree prepared by our method (Fig. 1) with the tree prepared by ClustalW method (Fig. S1 ) using the UPGMA approach, we found that, glomus genera were clustered together in Fig. 1 which was lacking in Fig. S1 . An obvious flaw in both the phylogenetic trees (Figs 1 and S1) is, none of them clustered rhizophagus genera in the single clade.",

Endophytic bacteria are an essential part of plant systems and play significant roles in plant growth and development 50 . The 40 bacterial sequences were obtained from pure cultures of endophytic bacteria isolated from the www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ surface sterilized mature endosperms of six rice varieties. The rice seeds were collected from two different locations in north-east India: North-Lakhimpur, Assam, Aizawl and Mizoram. Genomic DNA was extracted from the pure cultures, and the full length 16S rDNA sequences were amplified using the primer pair 27f (5\u2032-AGAGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG) and 1492r (5\u2032-TACCTTGTTAYGACTT). The amplicons were sequenced in an Applied Biosystems sequencer using the BigDye terminator method. To minimize sequencing error, we also used two internal primers 533f/805r along with 27 f/1492r. We assembled the contigs based on their phred scores (15) using the Codon Code aligner v7.0.1, BioEdit and SeqTrace v0.9 software 51 . The contigs were checked for the presence of any chimeras in mothur v1.35.1 and were aligned for identification against the NCBI reference rRNA database using the blastn algorithm. Information, including the accession numbers, phyla, classes, orders and families for the 40 bacterial isolates are listed in Table S2 . With there 40 bacterial isolates, we generated a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2) with our approach using the optimal step k = 6. The tree (Fig. 2 ) obtained by our method was compared with the tree (Fig. S2 ) obtained by ClustalW method using MEGA package 49 . Our algorithm separated the 40 bacterial sequences into two major clades: clade A (purple) and clade B (green) (Fig. 2) . Clade A branched into two clades: clade A1 (bold black) and clade A2 (purple). Clade A1 contained only Staphylococcus warneri, which separated out as an outgroup from the sequences in clade A2. Clade A2 consisted of 25 sequences, of which one sequence represented phylum firmicutes, three sequences represented actinobacteria, and the remaining 21 sequences belonged to phylum proteobacteria. Our method successfully grouped sequences of genus pantoea together, but in one instance it placed pantoea and xanthomonas as sister groups. In the same clade, our method placed a third sequence belonging to xanthomonas as an outlier. Additionally, in clade A2, brevibacillus and pantoea were clustered as a sister group, which belong to phylum firmicutes and proteobacteria respectively and curtobacterium was grouped with luteibacter. None of the actinobacterial sequences were grouped together in this clade.",

            "text": "Phylogenetic tree analysis of 59 ebolavirus complete genomes. The benchmark dataset used in this study was 59 complete genomes of ebolavirus with nearly 18900 nucleotides (Table S4 ). The Ebolavirus genus includes five species: Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Reston virus (RESTV), Ebola virus (formerly Zaire ebolavirus, EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), and Tai Forest virus (TAFV) 53 . Ebola viruses are single-strand negative sense RNA viruses. Each ebolavirus genome encodes seven proteins in which glycoprotein is the only viral protein on the surface of ebolavirus. The first case of human, infected by EBOV, was reported in 1976 in Zaire (currently the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)) 54 . We applied our proposed method to generate the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4) using the optimal step k = 6 of 59 viruses in Ebolavirus genus. As shown in Fig. 4 , the five species were correctly separated. The EBOV strains from the recognized pandemics build a lineage independent of the other four species in genus Ebolavirus. The EBOV strains in Zaire (DRC) pandemic in 1976-1977 were clustered together as a clade. The EBOV strains in DRC pandemic in 2007 were clustered together with the exception EBOV_2007_KC242788, which was clustered with Zaire (DRC) in 1976-1977. The EBOV strains in Guinea epidemic in 2014 were clustered together as a clade. The three EBOV strains from the 1995 outbreak in Zaire (DRC) formed a clade. SUDV and RESTV formed separate clades. BDBV and TAFV viruses were positioned together. Our result was in consensus with the result generated using multiple encoding vector method 52 (Fig. S5) and FFP method 22 (Fig. S6) . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Phylogenetic tree analysis of 30 coronavirus whole genomes. The other benchmark dataset used for validation of the method was the 30 complete coronavirus genomes with nearly 25,000 to 32,000 nucleotides (Table S5 ). Coronaviruses 55 are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses within the family Coronaviridae 56 . The coronaviruses are pleomorphic RNA viruses that are widespread among avians, bats, humans and other mammals. They are known to cause mild to severe respiratory diseases, gastroenterological, neurological and systemic conditions. This group of virus can easily cross species-barrier and infect new species 57 . As a result of pandemics from coronaviruses especially the SARS, the classification and evolutionary relationships among these viruses have been extensively investigated. We employed our method to analyse the 30 coronavirus whole genome sequences along with 4 non-coronaviruses as outgroups. The 30 coronavirus were classified into www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ five groups according to their host type. As shown in Fig. 5 generated by our approach using the optimal step k = 7, we can observe that the 30 coronavirus along with 4 non-coronaviruses were correctly grouped according to their host type except group 1 (Table S5) . We compared Fig. 5 generated by our approach with Figs S7, S8, S9 and S10 collected from previous work 52, 58 . The limitation observed in our result (Fig. 5) is that, our method was unable to cluster group 1 as compared to Figs S7 and S8. While in Fig. S9 generated by k-mer 59 method and Fig. S10 generated by FFP method using substrings length six, the four non-coronaviruses were not clustered together. Therefore, for this dataset, tree generated by our approach has advantage over k-mer and FFP methods using substrings length six.",

The genomes included in this dataset were, four arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, six bacterial isolates, nine primates mammalian mitochondrial genomes, ten ebolavirus (five reston virus (RESTV), five bundibugyo virus (BDBV)) complete genomes, ten SARS coronavirus, eleven hepatitis E virus and eight eutherian mammals. We applied our proposed method to generate the phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 9 ) using the optimal step k = 8. As shown in Fig. 9 , we observed that all the different species genomes were clustered separately. This result (Fig. 9) showed the efficiency of our method in clustering genomes irrespective of their size and divergence. Our result (Fig. 9 ) was in consensus with the result generated using ClustalW method (Fig. S16) . The time taken by our method to generate the transition probability matrix was less than 1 second, while Clustalw has taken 3 hours and 12 minutes.",

The other benchmark dataset used in this study was 29 complete genomes from the genera Escherichia/Shigella with more than 1 million nucleotides (Table S9) . We applied our proposed method to generate the phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 10 ) using the optimal step k = 7. As shown in Fig. 10 , we observed that the genomes were clustered into distinct clades, Escherichia(green) and Shigella (red). We took the benchmark tree 64 as a reference which is based on concatenated alignments of the 2034 core genes and used the maximum likelihood method to infer the phylogenetic relationships. We calculated Robinson-Foulds distance (RF-distance) 65 of the tree produced by our method against the benchmark tree 64 . The RF-distance is often used to compare two trees of closely related species. Since, the species in this dataset (29 complete genomes from the genera Escherichia/Shigella) are closely related organisms, therefore, we employed the RF-distance, which evaluates the topological congruence between an inferred tree and a benchmark tree. We also collected the generated RF-distances from the previous study 66 . RF = 0 indicates that, the test-tree topology is completely similar to that of the benchmark tree, while similarity level decreases as the RF increases. As shown in Fig. S17 , RF-distance generated by our approach to the reference tree was higher than RF-distance generated by rest of the methods to the reference tree. This result demonstrates that our proposed method has a limitation in clustering of the closely related organism.",

Sequence comparison is one of the most useful and widely practiced methods in bioinformatics and computational biology. Alignment based methods perform well if the genetic sequences are homologous. High mutation rates and genetic recombination brings in a limitation of the alignment based method. Also at the genomic scale, alignment based methods become impractical due to their computational complexity. Alignment-free methods are of great value, because they reduce the technical constraints of alignments. We constructed a transition probability matrix using a Markov chain for each DNA sequences without performing prior alignment at the genomic scale. The fuzzy integral similarity technique is a method that can calculate similarity score between two transition probability matrices of DNA sequences. The main advantage of our approach is that, it does not require any additional parameters, which makes it fully automated and robust. We implemented and tested our method on suitable datasets.",

The length of the chromosomes X in these organisms ranges approximately from 6 to 147 Mb. Applying our method, we generated the phylogenetic tree (Fig. S18 ) of nine mammals using the www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ optimal step k = 8. Our method took only 18 seconds for generating transition probability matrix. Phylogenetic tree (Fig. S19 ) generated by multiple encoding vector method 52 , mouse clustered with primates, while dog and horse came together in a clade. Figure S18 generated by our method formed three major clusters. Branch point in the first clade shows a divergence event of horse and mouse from the primates. A comparative radiation hybrid map of chromosome X of human, horse and mouse reveals many conserved syntenies between the three species 67, 68 . This similarity may have placed horse and mouse in a sister group. Dog and oppossum formed a distinct clade, while platypus separated as an outgroup.",
