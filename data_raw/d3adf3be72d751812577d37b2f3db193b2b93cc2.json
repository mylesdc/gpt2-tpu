Physiologically, Mg 2+ is used as a co-factor by HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) to perform catalysis; however, alternative cations including Mn 2+ , Co 2 + , and Zn 2+ can also support catalysis. Although Zn 2+ supports DNA synthesis, it inhibits HIV RT by significantly modifying RT catalysis. Zn 2+ is currently being investigated as a component of novel treatment options against HIV and we wanted to investigate the fidelity of RT with Zn 2+ . Methods: We used PCR-based and plasmid-based alpha complementation assays as well as steady-state misinsertion and misincorporation assays to examine the fidelity of RT with Mn 2+ , Co 2+ , and Zn 2+ .",

Consistent with this, RT extended primers with mismatched 3\u2032 nucleotides poorly and inserted incorrect nucleotides less efficiently using Zn 2+ than Mg 2+ . In agreement with previous literature, we observed that Mn 2+ and Co 2+ dramatically decreased the fidelity of RT at highly elevated concentrations (6 mM). However, surprisingly, the fidelity of HIV RT with Mn 2+ and Co 2+ remained similar to Mg 2+ at lower concentrations that are optimal for catalysis.",

HIV-1 RT is a heterodimer consisting of p66 and p51 subunits, with the p66 subunit performing both the polymerase and RNase H activities [3] . Under physiological conditions, Mg 2+ functions as the co-factor for both activities. In addition to Mg 2+ , RT in vitro can use alternative divalent cations such as Mn 2+ , Cu 2+ , Co 2+ and Zn 2+ for polymerase activity [4] . These cations are important to many cellular processes and are tightly regulated. The total concentration of Zn 2+ in cells is~0.1-0.5 mM [5] [6] [7] [8] while the total concentration of Mn 2+ in red blood cells is~2.5-3 \u03bcM [9, 10] , and Co 2+ in the serum is in the low \u03bcM range [11] . The available free concentration of all these cations is kept extremely low by cellular mechanisms [12, 13] . Therefore, we believe these divalent cations do not play a significant role in the HIV replication lifecycle.",

Mn 2+ , Co 2+ , and Ni 2+ have all been shown to dramatically decrease the fidelity of DNA synthesis by several human, bacterial, and viral polymerases including HIV RT [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . Mn 2+ and Co 2+ decreased the fidelity of avian myeoblastosis virus (AMV) RT and human DNA polymerase I in a concentration-dependent manner [40] . Increased error frequency in presence of Mn 2+ has also been observed in vitro with HIV RT [43] , Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I [44] , phage T4 DNA polymerase [45] , DNA polymerases \u03b1 and \u03b2 [46] , and Taq polymerase [47] . Most of these experiments were performed using concentrations of divalent cation higher than those required for maximal enzyme activity. However, we recently reported that physiological Mg 2+ concentrations, which are lower than the high concentration typically used to optimize enzyme kinetics in vitro, can increase RT fidelity [48] .",

Although Mn 2+ and Co 2+ were previously demonstrated to support RT catalysis, our recent publication [20] was the first to show (to our knowledge) that Zn 2+ , a potent polymerase inhibitor, can also support polymerase catalysis [15] . Therefore, we wanted to look more closely at how this previously untested divalent cation affects RT fidelity. A better understanding of the fidelity of RT with these alternative cations could also be important for modulating the accuracy of RT-PCR reactions. Mn 2+ is already being used in PCR reactions to generate random mutations [47] . In this report, we show that under optimal extension conditions, Zn 2+ increases the fidelity of RT, a previously unprecedented observation of an alternative cation for a polymerase. We also show that presumed pro-mutagenic cations, such as Mn 2+ and Co 2+ , are not mutagenic with HIV RT at concentrations optimal for dNTP catalysis. The potential mechanisms by which Zn 2+ enhance fidelity as well as the reason for the concentration-dependence of mutagenesis is discussed.",

Optimal extension for each cation in the presence of 100 \u03bcM of each dNTP was observed at the following concentrations: 2 mM Mg 2+ , 0.4 mM Zn 2+ , 0.4 mM Mn 2+ , and 0.25 mM Co 2+ . Since a total concentration of 400 \u03bcM total nts (100 \u03bcM each) was used in the assays, the free concentration of each cation for optimal extension was~1.6 mM for Mg 2+ , 0.15 mM for Zn 2 + , 0.15 mM for Mn 2+ , and 0.07 mM for Co 2+ . Note that all 3 alternative cations showed maximal activity at much lower concentrations than Mg 2+ . This suggests that these alternative cations bind more tightly to RT than the physiological cation. Interestingly, we also found that Cu 2+ supported RT catalysis but optimum extension occurred at a much higher concentration of 3 mM (data not shown). Average and maximum extension rates were then calculated as described in Materials and Methods using the RNA template used for round 1 synthesis of the PCR-based lacZ\u03b1-complementation fidelity assay. As expected, the rate of synthesis was fastest using Mg 2+ and slowest with Zn 2+ (Figure 1 and Table 1 ). An average extension rate of 1.8 \u00b1 0.48 nts/s and a maximal extension rate of 7.4 \u00b1 1.9 nts/s was observed with 2 mM Mg 2+ , whereas with 0.4 mM Zn 2+ , extension rates were 0.03 \u00b1 0.02 nts/s and 0.19 \u00b1 0.10 nts/s, respectively. Both 0.4 mM Mn 2+ and 0.25 mM Co 2+ decreased the average and maximal rate of extension as well (Table 1) .",

The assay essentially mimics the reverse transcription process since both RNA-and DNA-directed RT synthesis steps are performed. Most of the possible background mutations can be accounted for by performing a control in which plasmid DNA is PCR amplified to produce an insert identical to those produced in the complete assay. These inserts should comprise all error sources except the errors derived from HIV RT and T3 RNA polymerase. An average background colony mutant frequency (CMF, number of white or faint blue colonies divided by total colonies) of 0.0019 \u00b1 0.0014 was obtained (Table 2) .

Although Co 2+ is reported to be mutagenic, its effect on the mutation rate of polymerases is concentration-dependent [40, 42, 46] . For example, the error frequency of avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) RT increased from about 1 error per 1680 nt additions with Mg 2+ to 1 error per 1100 nt addition with activating concentrations of Co 2+ (1 mM), but increased further to 1 error per 200 nt addition when excess amounts of Co 2+ were used (5 mM) [40] . Only 0.07 mM free Co 2+ was used in these assays and it is possible that Co 2+ does not have a profound impact on fidelity at this concentration.

The gap filled by the polymerase is in a plasmid construct, which after fill in, is directly transfected into bacteria. Bacterial colonies rather than phage plaques are scored by blue-white screening in this assay. This assay screens a large region (288 nts) of the lacZ\u03b1 gene including the promoter sequence and it avoids the enzymatic (T3 RNA polymerase and Pfu polymerase) background issues of the PCRbased assay. The results (Table 3 ) were in strong agreement with the PCR-based assay ( Table 2 ). In this assay, Mg 2+ was modestly more accurate than 0.25 mM Co 2+ , while Zn 2+ once again showed~2.5-fold greater fidelity than Mg 2+ . Interestingly, Mn 2+ , a known pro-mutagenic cation for several polymerases including HIV RT [43] , was comparable to Mg 2+ in the assays when used at its optimal concentration (0.4 mM total and 0.15 mM free). However, both Co 2+ and Mn 2+ were highly mutagenic when used at 6 mM, an amount which is in the same range shown by others to decrease the fidelity of several polymerases in vitro [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] 52] . There was a~25-fold decrease in fidelity with 6 mM Mn 2+ compared to 0.4 mM Mn 2+ . Similarly, a~7-fold decrease in fidelity was observed with 6 mM vs. 0.25 mM Co 2+ . Both cations also showed severely inhibited polymerase activity at the 6 mM concentration while Zn 2+ incorporates only a few nts even after prolonged incubation at high concentrations (see [4] , results with Co 2+ were similar to those shown with Mn 2+ in this report). Overall, the results from both the PCR-based and gapped plasmidbased lacZ\u03b1-complementation fidelity assays show that the fidelity of RT increases with Zn 2+ and presumed pro-mutagenic cations do not modify RT's error rate significantly when used at low concentrations optimal for catalysis.",

A line is drawn above the 92 nts that are in the detectable area for substitution mutations while frameshifts can be detected over the entire 115 nt region. Based on a previous cataloging of mutations in this gene [51] , the assay can detect 116 different substitutions (33.6% of the 345 possible substitutions in the 115 nt sequence) and 100% of the frameshift mutations. substitutions, total is 5.6 \u00d7 10 \u22125 for both (see Figure 3 legend for further details)). Synthesis with Zn 2+ resulted in a higher ratio of indels vs. substitution: indels~63% (26/41), and~37% substitutions (15/41) were obtained. With a CMF of 0.0025 (Table 1) , a mutation frequency of 1.9 \u00d7 10 \u22125 or~1 error per 53,000 incorporations was obtained for experiments with Zn 2+ . This value is also closer to the rate of~1 error per 77,000 incorporations that was observed with more physiological (0.25 mM), though sub-optimal Mg 2+ concentrations [4] .",

Although pre-steady-state assays are more useful for understanding kinetic parameters for misincorporation, steady-state assays are much simpler to perform and typically yield results that are broadly similar to results with presteady-state assays [54] . Mismatched primer extension In background assays, plasmid pBSM13\u0394PVUII ( Figure, 1B ) was used as a template in PCR reactions to generate the insert that was scored in the assays. Numbers shown are the \"colony mutation frequency\" (CMF) defined as white + faint blue colonies divided by total colonies. Refer to the Results and Methods sections for details. and running-start assays using the sequences shown in Figure 4 were performed with constant concentrations of free cation of 0.4 mM Zn 2+ or 2 mM Mg 2+ . Note that reactions with each cation were performed using different enzyme concentrations and time points (see Materials and Methods). This was necessary as catalysis with Zn 2+ is much slower than Mg 2+ yielding negligible levels of extension with the conditions used for Mg 2+ . The results with Zn 2+ were seemingly consistent with steadystate conditions as the reactions were conducted over a prolonged period (30 min) and the ratio of unextended to extended primers remained high (i.e. the substrate was not significantly depleted). However, it is possible that these reactions may to some extent reflect presteady-state conditions, to an extent, since RT-primer-template complexes are extremely stable in Zn 2+ while catalysis is slow [20] . Because of these constraints, a direct comparison of the kinetic and equilibrium constants between the two cations cannot be made. However, the fidelity with Zn 2+ relative to that with Mg 2+ can still be estimated by comparing misinsertion ratios calculated for particular mismatches with each cation. The running-start assays performed here test RT's ability to misincorporate at a template C or G residue (depending on the sequence) after a \"running-start\" on a run of T's immediately downstream of the primer 3\u2032 terminus. Experiments were analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gels ( Figure 4B ). A statistically pronounced (based on P-values) increase in fidelity was observed for all mismatches with Zn 2+ ( Table 4 ). The misinsertion ratio for the G.A mismatch, In background assays, the gapped plasmid was transformed into the bacteria allowing the bacterial polymerases to fill in the gap.

The ability of Mn 2+ to accommodate more than one type of symmetry may increase the reaction rate of misaligned substrates and hence decrease the fidelity of polymerization. It is important to note that although results presented here indicate Mn 2+ is not highly mutagenic at optimal concentrations, this may not be the case for other polymerases. Crystal structures of polymerases with Zn 2+ in the active site are not available, but Zn 2+ has been crystallized in a distorted tetrahedral symmetry in erythrocyte carbonic-anhydrase [58] , as well as in a near tetrahedral geometry in Zn 2+ superoxide dismutase [59] . It is possible that Zn 2+ supports a different geometry than Mg 2+ in the active site and promotes a configuration of the amino acid residues which may be better suited to discriminate against misaligned substrates.",

Although Mn 2+ is generally considered to be pro-mutagenic [57] , the error frequency for several DNA polymerases usually increased as the Mn 2+ concentration increased [52] . In one report, E. coli DNA polymerase I and mammalian DNA polymerase \u03b2 both showed relatively high fidelity when lower concentrations (below~100 \u03bcM) of Mn 2+ were used, whereas higher concentrations lead to greater mutagenesis. The high concentrations correlated with Mn 2+ binding to the single stranded template and possibly to secondary binding sites on the polymerase, raising the possibility that these factors promote the lower fidelity observed at high Mn 2+ concentrations [60] . In this regard, E. coli DNA polymerase I has been reported to have as many as 21 Mn 2+ binding sites on a single molecule but just a single high affinity binding site [61] . The effect, if any, of binding at the secondary sites is unknown. Still, when compared to Mg 2+ , careful analysis with other polymerases has suggested that Mn 2+ is promutagenic over a range of concentrations [62] . Differences between our results and these may stem from intrinsic differences in the enzymes or the different nucleic acid substrate used (many of the former experiments used homopolymers). Also, unlike RT, most DNA polymerases have intrinsic exonuclease activity. El-Deiry et al. [62] found that E. coli DNA polymerase I demonstrated a significant reduction in 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease proofreading activity in the presence of Mn 2+ . This effect exacerbated the accelerated misincorporation with Mn 2+ which was observed.",

            "text": "It is also possible that Zn 2+ affects the rate of conformational change in the enzyme and this leads to an alteration in fidelity. Catalysis with Zn 2+ is extremely slow (Table 1 and [20] ) even though the complex between the enzyme and primer-template is over 100 times more stable than with Mg 2+ [20] . This indicates that one or more of the steps in catalysis is slow. Conformational transition of the protein after binding the substrate has a significant contribution to the ability of RT to add the The sequence of the DNA used in each assay type is shown. The underlined nts show the only differences between the two templates. Only one primer was used in the running-start assays and it terminated at the 3\u2032 C nt before the dashes. The four dashes indicate the 4 A nts that must be incorporated before RT incorporates the target nt (denoted by X or Y). correct substrate [63] . Upon binding the substrate in Mg 2+ , the enzyme undergoes a conformational change to reach the transition state. A correctly matched nt then leads to tight binding and alignment of catalytic residues to promote catalysis, whereas a mismatched nt does not induce the tight binding state, thereby facilitating the rapid opening of the specificity domain and release of the misaligned substrate [63] . The conformational change in the specificity subdomain (fingers subdomain) of the polymerase plays a key role in determining the enzyme fidelity, and it will be interesting to investigate if the modified catalysis with Zn 2+ affects either the conformational change or the rate of conformational change in a way which might increase the specificity. Consistent with the model of slower catalysis promoting higher fidelity, suboptimal Mg 2+ concentrations also enhanced fidelity [48] . The observed enhancement was similar to what was observed with Zn 2+ as it resulted mostly due to a decrease in substitutions rather than insertion and deletion errors. Since insertions and deletions often result from primer-template slippage mechanisms, this suggests that both low Mg 2+ and Zn 2+ induce higher fidelity by intrinsically affecting RT catalysis rather than altering primer-template properties. It is possible that lowering the Zn 2+ concentration to suboptimal levels could also alter fidelity, however, catalysis dramatically declines as the concentration of Zn 2+ is either lowered or increased [20] , making it difficult to test this possibility.",

            "text": "For RNA-directed DNA synthesis, the~760 nt RNA template was hybridized to a radiolabeled 25 nt DNA primer (5\u2032-GCGGGCCTCTTCGCTATTACGCCAG-3\u2032). Full extension produced a 199 nt final product (see Figure 2A ). The long template was used to make it easier to separate DNA synthesis products from the RNA template on a denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel (see below). The primertemplate complex was pre-incubated in 48 \u03bcl of buffer (see below) for 3 min at 37\u00b0C. The reaction was initiated by addition of 2 \u03bcl of 5 \u03bcM HIV RT in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 80 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and 10% glycerol and incubation was continued for 30 min for Mg 2+ , 1 hour for Mn 2+ and Co 2+ , and 3 hours for Zn 2+ . Different time points were used to assure that all the reactions were essentially complete with each cation. The final concentration of reaction components were 200 nM HIV RT, 25 nM template, 50 nM primer, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 80 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.4% glycerol and 0.4 units/\u03bcl RNasin along with different concentrations of salts. A final concentration of 100 \u03bcM dNTPs was used along with one of the following divalent cation: 2 mM MgCl 2, 0.25 mM CoCl 2 , 0.4 mM ZnCl 2 . The final pH of the reactions was 7.7. After incubations, 1 \u03bcl of DNase-free RNase was added and the sample was heated to 65\u00b0C for 5 min. Typically two reactions for each condition were combined and material was recovered by standard phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Pellets were resuspended in 20 \u03bcl of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7) and 2X loading buffer (90% formamide, 10 mM EDTA (pH 8), 0.25% each bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol) and products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide-urea gels (19:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide). Fully extended 199 nt DNA was located using a phosphoimager (Fujifilm FLA5100), and recovered by the crush and soak method [65] in 500 \u03bcl of elution buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7). After overnight elution, this material was passed through a 0.45 \u03bcm syringe filter and recovered by ethanol precipitation after addition of 10% volume 3 M sodium acetate (pH 7) and 50 \u03bcg of glycogen. After centrifugation, the pellets were vigorously washed with 500 \u03bcl of 70% ethanol to remove any traces of EDTA that may have carried over from the gel and potentially interfere with the second round of synthesis. The recovered DNA was hybridized to another 20 nt radiolabeled DNA primer (5\u2032-AGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGC-3\u2032) with 10fold greater specific activity than the primer used for round one, and a second round of DNA synthesis was performed as described above except the reaction volume was 25 \u03bcl. Conditions for the cation, dNTPs, and pH were identical in the RNA-and DNA-templated reactions. Reactions were terminated with an equal volume of 2X loading buffer and products were gel purified as described above but on an 8% gel. The gel was run far enough to efficiently separate the 199 nt templates from the 162 nt full extension product of round 2.",

Briefly, the maximal extension rate was determined by calculating the length of the longest product on 8% polyacrylamide-urea gels (19:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) in reactions that had not proceeded to the end of the template (l). The primer length was then subtracted (20 nt) and the maximum extension rate was calculated using the formula: l\u221220where t is the reaction time in seconds. The average extension rate was calculated by taking into account the length and the relative intensity of all extension products in a time point. Average extension rate was estimated by calculating the size in nts of each band on the gel (s) and subtracting the primer length (20 nt), then using the imager to determine the relative proportion (with the total being set to 1) of the total extended primers to which each band corresponded (y). The band's contribution to the average extension rate can be represented by the following equation: (s \u2212 20) * y. The average extension rate can then be calculated using the following expression:Where t is the reaction time in seconds. Time points in which none of the extension products had reached the end of the template were chosen for the calculation of the maximal and the average extension rate. For example, time points of 30 s or 1 min were chosen for 0.4 mM Mn 2+ and 0.4 mM Zn 2+ reactions (see Figure 1 ). ",
