            "text": "The dynamics of infectious diseases spread via direct person-to-person transmission (such as influenza, smallpox, HIV/AIDS, etc.) depends on the underlying host contact network. Human contact networks exhibit strong community structure. Understanding how such community structure affects epidemics may provide insights for preventing the spread of disease between communities by changing the structure of the contact network through pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions. We use empirical and simulated networks to investigate the spread of disease in networks with community structure. We find that community structure has a major impact on disease dynamics, and we show that in networks with strong community structure, immunization interventions targeted at individuals bridging communities are more effective than those simply targeting highly connected individuals. Because the structure of relevant contact networks is generally not known, and vaccine supply is often limited, there is great need for efficient vaccination algorithms that do not require full knowledge of the network. We developed an algorithm that acts only on locally available network information and is able to quickly identify targets for successful immunization intervention. The algorithm generally outperforms existing algorithms when vaccine supply is limited, particularly in networks with strong community structure. Understanding the spread of infectious diseases and designing optimal control strategies is a major goal of public health. Social networks show marked patterns of community structure, and our results, based on empirical and simulated data, demonstrate that community structure strongly affects disease dynamics. These results have implications for the design of control strategies. Citation: Salath\u00e9 M, Jones JH (2010) Dynamics and Control of Diseases in Networks with Community Structure.

A rich body of research [1, 2, 3] has provided major insights into the processes that drive epidemics, and has been instrumental in developing strategies for control and eradication. The structure of contact networks is crucial in explaining epidemiological patterns seen in the spread of directly transmissible diseases such as HIV/AIDS [1, 4, 5] , SARS [6, 7] , influenza [8, 9, 10, 11] etc. For example, the basic reproductive number R 0 , a quantity central to developing intervention measures or immunization programs, depends crucially on the variance of the distribution of contacts [1, 12, 13] , known as the network degree distribution. Contact networks with fat-tailed degree distributions, for example, where a few individuals have an extraordinarily large number of contacts, result in a higher R 0 than one would expect from contact networks with a uniform degree distribution, and the existence of highly connected individuals makes them an ideal target for control measures [7, 14] .",

Community structure exists when connections between members of a group of nodes are more dense than connections between members of different groups of nodes [15] . The terminology is relatively new in network analysis and recent algorithm development has greatly expanded our ability to detect sub-structuring in networks. While there has been a recent explosion in interest and methodological development, the concept is an old one in the study of social networks where it is typically referred to as a ''cohesive subgroups,'' groups of vertices in a graph that share connections with each other at a higher rate than with vertices outside the group [18] . Empirical data on social structure suggests that community structuring is extensive in epidemiological contacts [25, 26, 27] relevant for infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g. influenza-like illnesses), and in social groups more generally [16, 17, 28, 29, 30] . Similarly, the results of epidemic models of directly transmitted infections such as influenza are most consistent with the existence of such structure [8, 9, 11, 31, 32, 33] .",

In practice, the number of people to be removed from the susceptible class is often constrained for a number of reasons (e.g., due to limited vaccine supply or ethical concerns of social distancing measures). From a network perspective, targeted immunization methods translate into indentifying which nodes should be removed from a network, a problem that has caught considerable attention (see for example [36] and references therein). Targeting highly connected individuals for immunization has been shown to be an effective strategy for epidemic control [7, 14] . However, in networks with strong community structure, this strategy may not be the most effective: some individuals connect to multiple communities (so-called community bridges [37] ) and may thus be more important in spreading the disease than individuals with fewer inter-community connections, but this importance is not necessarily reflected in the degree.

A network with strong community structure consists of smaller sub-networks (the communities) that have many connections within them, but only few between them. Here we use both data from social networking websites and computer generated networks to study the effect of community structure on epidemic spread.

While degree and betweenness centrality are often strongly positively correlated, the correlation between degree and betweenness centrality becomes weaker as community structure becomes stronger ( Figure 3 ). Thus, in networks with community structure, focusing on the degree alone carries the risk of missing some of the community bridges that are not highly connected. Indeed, at a low vaccination coverage, an immunization strategy based on betweenness centrality results in fewer infected cases than an immunization strategy based on degree as the magnitude of community structure increases ( Figure 4a ). This observation is critical because the potential vaccination coverage for an emerging infection will typically be very low. A third measure, random walk centrality, identifies target nodes by a random walk, counting how often a node is traversed by a random walk between two other nodes [39] . The random walk centrality measure considers not only the shortest paths between pairs of nodes, but all paths between pairs of nodes, while still giving shorter paths more weight. While infections are most likely to spread along the shortest paths between any two nodes, the cumulative contribution of other paths can still be important [40] : immunization strategies based on random walk centrality result in the lowest number of infected cases at low vaccination coverage (Figure 4b and 4c ).",

Thus, algorithms that are agnostic about the full network structure are necessary to identify target individuals. The only algorithm we are aware of that is completely agnostic about the network structure network structure identifies target nodes by picking a random contact of a randomly chosen individual [42] . Once such an acquaintance has been picked n times, it is immunized. The acquaintance method has been shown to be able to identify some of the highly connected individuals, and thus approximates an immunization strategy that targets highly connected individuals. We propose an alternative algorithm (the so-called community bridge finder (CBF) algorithm, described in detail in the Methods) that aims to identify community bridges connecting two groups of clustered nodes. Briefly, starting from a random node, the algorithm follows a random path on the contact network, until it arrives at a node that does not connect back to more than one of the previously visited nodes on the random walk. The basic goal of the CBF algorithm is to find nodes that connect to multiple communities -it does so based on the notion that the first node that does not connect back to previously visited nodes of the current random walk is likely to be part of a different community. On all empirical and computationally generated networks tested, this algorithm performed mostly better, often equally well, and rarely worse than the alternative algorithm. It is important to note a crucial difference between algorithms such as CBF (henceforth called stochastic algorithms) and algorithms such as those that calculate, for example, the betweenness centrality of nodes (henceforth called deterministic algorithms). A deterministic algorithm always needs the complete information about each node (i.e. either the number or the identity of all connected nodes for each node in the network). A comparison between algorithms is therefore of limited use if they are not of the same type as they have to work with different inputs. Clearly, a deterministic algorithm with information on the full network structure as input should outperform a stochastic algorithm that is agnostic about the full network structure. Thus, we will restrict our comparison of CBF to the acquaintance method since this is the only stochastic algorithm we are aware of the takes as input the same limited amount of local information.",

Thus, the same disease can exhibit markedly different epidemic patterns simply due to differences in the degree distribution. Our results extend this finding and show that even in networks with the same degree distribution, fundamentally different epidemic dynamics are expected to be observed due to different levels of community structure. This finding is important for various reasons: first, community structure has been shown to be a crucial feature of social networks [15, 16, 17, 19] , and its effect on disease spread is thus relevant to infectious disease dynamics. Furthermore, it corroborates earlier suggestions that community structure affects the spread of disease, and is the first to clearly isolate this effect from effects due to variance in the degree distribution [43] . Second, and consequently, data on the degree distribution of contact networks will not be sufficient to predict epidemic dynamics. Third, the design of control strategies benefits from taking community structure into account.",

Stochastic algorithms like the proposed CBF algorithm or the acquaintance method address both problems at once. To what extent targeted immunization strategies can be implemented in a infectious diseases/public health setting based on practical and ethical considerations remains an open question. This is true not only for the strategy based on the CBF algorithm, but for most strategies that are based on network properties.

Targeted immunization of individuals connecting subpopulations has been shown to be an effective low-coverage immunization strategy for the conservation of endangered species [46] . Under the assumption of homogenous mixing, the elimination of a disease requires an immunization coverage of at least 1-1/R 0 [1] but such coverage is often difficult or even impossible to achieve due to limited vaccine supply, logistical challenges or ethical concerns. In the case of wildlife animals, high vaccination coverage is also problematic as vaccination interventions can be associated with substantial risks. Little is known about the contact network structure in humans, let alone in wildlife, and progress should therefore be made on the development of immunization strategies that can deal with the absence of such data.

At each time step, infected nodes recover at rate c, i.e. the probability of recovery of an infected node per time step is c (unless noted otherwise, we use c = 0.2). If recovery occurs, the state of the recovered node is toggled from infected to resistant. Unless mentioned otherwise, the transmission rate b is chosen such that R 0 ,(b/c) * d<3 where d is the mean network degree, i.e the average number of contacts per node. For the networks used here, this approximation is in line with the result from static network theory [47] , R 0 ,T(,k 2 ./,k.21), where ,k. and ,k 2 . are the mean degree and mean square degree, respectively, and where T is the average probability of disease transmission from a node to a neighboring node, i.e. T<b/c. Note that the variation in the degree is too small to be of relevance here (see further below and Figure 1d ). The reason we chose c = 0.2 (i.e. an average length of infectious period of 5 days) and R 0 <3 in most simulations (unless mentioned otherwise) is that these parameter values reflect, very roughly, some of the most widespread infectious diseases to which our study is relevant (i.e. flu-like infectious diseases that are transmitted directly from person to person by the respiratory or close-contact route [8, 9, 48, 49, 50] ).",

We then add 2000 edges randomly between randomly chosen nodes, making sure that the edges fall between communities only. Thus, we create a graph with 2000 nodes and 10000 (i.e. (2000+50 * 40 * (8/2))) undirected edges where one out of five edges falls between communities. The average degree of the network is 10, which is in line with recent reports on social contact patterns [55] . Starting from this initial network where Q<0.76, we create networks with increasing community structure by rewiring between-community edges so that they become within-community edges. More precisely, at each rewiring step, we (i) randomly choose a betweencommunity edge, (ii) randomly choose one of the two communities that the edge connects, (iii) pick a random node of the chosen community, and (iv) rewire the edge by detaching it from the node of the community that was not chosen in step (ii), and attaching it to the new node in the community that was chosen in step (iii). At all times, edges must always fall between two distinct nodes, and there can only be one edge between any two pair of nodes.

Thus, using the raw friendship data and the available information on dormitory residence, major, and class year, we extract the subgraph which reflects our assumptions. Having extracted the subgraph, we remove all nodes who are not part of the largest connected component (i.e. small subgraphs that are not part of the larger network). The networks thus reduce to the following contact networks: We note that the modularity Q of these networks is within the range of modularities measured in the computationally generated networks (see for example Figure 1) , with the exception of one network (Georgetown). Clearly, these networks will contain contacts that are not relevant for the spread of diseases (false positives) -at the same time, they will also miss some relevant contacts (false negatives). However, given the accuracy and amount of data, these networks are well suited to study the spread of infectious diseases on human contact networks, in particular for diseases transmitted directly from person to person by the respiratory or close-contact route.

(e) Hence, v 2 is dismissed as a potential target, and the random walk continues to v 4 .

At every node v i$2 , check if there is more than one connection from v i to any of the visited nodes (the requirement for more than one connection stems from the simple fact that every node v i will have at least one connection to v i21 ). If there is just one back connection (i.e. from v i to v i21 ), a potential target v i21 has been identified. As an additional check, pick two random neighboring nodes of v i (other than v i21 ) and check for connections back to the previously visited nodes v j,i . If such connections exist, v i21 is not a potential target -continue the random walk at v i21 . If no such connections exist, immunize the potential target.

For example, the frequency of nodes that can potentially meet the immunization requirement set by the algorithm might be smaller than the desired immunization coverage. To prevent endless searches for community bridges, two additional checks are implemented. First, the number of nodes in any running random path does not exceed 10 (this is implemented using a first-in-first-out list that keeps track of the visited nodes). Second, we keep track of all nodes visited, and if a node has been visited at least k times (on any random walk), it will be immunized. In all results presented in this manuscript, we use k = 2. Figure S1 Results from simulations with the same parameters and settings as Figure 1a in the main text, but based on networks with lower community structure. The initial creation of these networks was identical to those created for Figure 1 in the main text (see description in Methods in the main text), but rather than rewiring between-community edges and turn them into withincommunity edges, we randomly rewired within-community edges in the following way: at each rewiring step, we (i) randomly choose a within-community edge, (ii) randomly choose one of the two nodes, (iii) pick a random node in the network, and rewire the edge by detaching it from the node that was not chosen in step (ii), and attaching it to the new node that was chosen in step (iii). At all times, edges must always fall between two distinct nodes, and there can only be one edge between any two pair of nodes.

Color code denotes the difference in the average final size S m of disease outbreaks in networks that were immunized before the outbreak using method m. The top panel (a) shows the difference between the degree method and the betweenness centrality method, i.e. S degree 2 S betweenness . A positive difference (colored red to light gray) indicates that the betweenness centrality method resulted in smaller final sizes than the degree method. A negative difference (colored blue to black) indicates that the betweenness centrality method resulted in bigger final sizes than the degree method. If the difference is not bigger than 0.1% of the total population size, then no color is shown (white). Panel (a) shows that the betweenness centrality method is more effective than the degree based method in networks with strong community structure (Q is high). (b) and (c): like (a), but showing S degree 2 S randomwalk (in (b)) and S betweenness 2 S randomwalk (in (c)). Panels (b) and (c) show that the random walk method is the most effective method overall. Panel (d) shows that the community bridge finder (CBF) method generally outperforms the acquaintance method (with n = 1) except when community structure is very strong (see main text). Final epidemic sizes were obtained by running 2000 SIR simulations per network, vaccination coverage and immunization method. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000736.g004",
