To achieve control of CMV replication and prevent tissue-invasive CMV disease CMV-specific T-cells are essential. In patients with prolonged immunosuppression, substantial reduction of CMV-specific T-cells is associated with an increased risk for CMV reactivation, progressive replication and disease [2] . HIV-infection leads to both a significant reduction of CD4 T-cell counts and exhaustion of CD8 T-cell function. The decline of CD4 T-cells below 100 cells/mL serves as a surrogate marker for an advanced state of immunosuppression and an increased risk of CMV disease [3, 4] . Significant reductions of CMV-specific T-cells have been described in such advanced states of immunosuppression [5] . In addition, CMV disease is rare during antiretroviral treatment and after stable immune recovery. Nevertheless, in HIV-infected patients the impact of CMV-specific CD4 T-cells on CMV replication remains controversial. The increase of overall CD4 T-cell frequencies was associated with significantly less CMV disease [6] . However, Singh and colleagues reported a reduction of CMV-specific CD8 T-cells in individuals with a history of CMV disease, despite normal CD4 T-cell reconstitution [7] . In addition, CMV-specific T-cells were shown to poorly predict CMV retinitis in HIV-AIDS patients [8] , suggesting a potential role for other (immunological) co-factors. In clinical states with impaired adaptive immunity such as transplantation or HIV-infection, the innate immune response may become a more decisive factor in enabling the host to gain control over virus replication.",

            "text": "Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins are components of the innate immune response and are integral in complement pathway activation. MBL, an oligomer of homo-trimeric protein subunits synthesised in the liver, binds in its oligomeric form to carbohydrates on bacteria, fungi, and viruses [9, 10, 11] . MBL has been found to bind directly to virions from a number of different virus families, including human immunodeficiency virus [12] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [13] , Influenza A virus [13] , Ebola virus [13] , dengue virus [13] , and West Nile virus [13] . This interaction subsequently was shown to lead to neutralization by deposition of complement C3 and C4 on the virus subsequently preventing the interaction of the virus with the host cell and leading to increased phagocytosis or lysis of the virus [14, 15] . With regard to CMV, evidence of involvement of the lectin pathway is controversial. CMV glycoproteins are potential targets for MBL binding which could prevent virion entry into host cells. Alternatively, MBL could recognize these glycoproteins in/on the surface of an infected cell subsequently inducing complement-mediated cell destruction of the viral reservoir (infected cells) [16, 17] . In contrast, in a previous study complement activation and C3 deposition on the surface of CMV infected human skin fibroblasts were not dependent on MBL but only on C1q, the initiating molecule of the classical pathway of complement [18] . Similar to MBL, M-ficolin (ficolin-1), L-ficolin (ficolin-2), and H-ficolin (ficolin-3) also show oligomers of trimeric subunits and utilize the same activation enzymes [19, 20] . However, the effects of MBL and ficolin activation are complex and not fully understood. Intriguingly, many viruses encode homologues of complement regulatory proteins, which interact with complement receptors. These virus-induced alterations of complement function may increase virus persistence and limit immune-mediated tissue destruction [14, 21, 22] . Thus, complement may play a role in both innate and adaptive anti-viral immune responses [23] .",

Case definitions were according to international and standardized criteria and this guarantees a high level of diagnostic accuracy. Definitive CMV retinitis was diagnosed by characteristic ophthalmological appearance, CMV-detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and response to CMV treatment. However, in older cases (.10 years) the code ''definitive'' CMV retinitis is related to previous CDC-definitions that did not require PCR. Presumptive CMV retinitis was diagnosed by characteristic appearance on ophthalmoscopic examination (discrete patches of retinal whitening with distinct borders spreading in a centrifugal manner, frequently associated with retinal vasculitis, haemorrhage and necrosis) and typical findings following the resolution of active disease (residual retinal scarring and atrophy with retinal pigment epithelial mottling). Invasive CMV disease at other sites was always definitive with histologically proven CMV-infection. A positive culture alone from any site (except cerebrospinal fluid) without histological evidence of invasive disease was not considered sufficient for the diagnosis of CMV disease.",

A key question for this study was whether MBL confers enhanced protection against CMV disease as immunodeficiency increases. To address this question, we added a covariate for the interaction between CD4 T-cell count and MBL to our model. The estimate for this interaction shows how the association between CMV disease and MBL changes at lower CD4 T-cell counts. In addition, we estimated the association between CMV disease and MBL depending on CD4 T-cell count. We calculated CD4 T-cell count strata to separate patients with CD4 T-cell counts below 20 cells/mL from those with CD4 T-cell counts above 20 cells/mL.",

Using a piecewise linear spline allows estimation of the association between CMV disease and MBL without assuming a continuous gradient across the entire range of observed MBL levels, but rather below 100, in between 100 and 500 and above 500 ng/mL. With plasma samples obtained at least 6 months before or after the date when CMV disease was first diagnosed not being essential for patient eligibility, we refrained from formal analyses in order to avoid a possible selection bias but rather plotted profiles from past measurements through index date measurements and measurements after the index date.

In a nested case-control study we compared 105 HIVinfected patients with histologically proven tissue-invasive CMV disease to a well-matched control group at risk of CMV reactivation (positive CMV-IgG, low CD4 T-cell count). Our study shows that low MBL and serum ficolin levels are not associated with an increased risk for CMV disease in HIV-infected patients. Our results further suggest that the association between MBL and CMV disease does not depend on CD4 T-cell count. However, CMV disease was more prevalent with increasing HIV RNA level and, surprisingly, less prevalent with increasing time since HIV-infection.",

In children with presumed primary CMV-infection, genotypes associated with lower MBL levels were more frequently observed in patients with active replication [43] . Another study failed to find a correlation between CMV replication in newborns and the frequencies of MBL genotypes [44] . After transplantation several studies have highlighted MBL deficiency as a potential risk factor for CMV replication and disease [29, 31, 32, 45, 46] . Manuel et al. reported an increased risk of CMV disease in a small study of high-risk CMV sero-negative recipients of CMV sero-positive kidney grafts with functional MBL deficiency [31] . The presence of MBL and ficolin-2 polymorphisms in the liver and lung transplant recipients were associated with increased CMV replication in the recipient [29, 45, 46] . However, in other transplant cohorts, either structural haplotype AA had higher rates of CMV disease compared to patients with A/O or O/O [34] . In addition, MBL and MASP-2 measurements were similar in patients with and without posttransplant CMV replication [35] . None of the studies discussed effects of immunosuppression as a potential confounder. In addition, studies showed higher proportions of functional MBL deficiency in transplantation compared to healthy individuals [47, 48] , implying selection biases. Ficolin deficiencies have been associated with an increased risk for bacterial infection. Munthe-Fog et al. described a case of a homozygous H-ficolin deficient patient with no detectable ficolin level and recurrent infections, suggesting a role for ficolin in the control of bacterial infection. In our study only one patient showed an H-ficolin level below 100 ng/mL. A functional protective threshold for ficolins has not yet been determined. Although we have not powered our study to determine a predictive threshold for CMV disease, our data does not indicate an association between M-ficolin, L-ficolin, and H-ficolin levels and CMV disease.",

With regard to the occurrence of opportunistic infections in cases versus controls we could not observe an apparent dysbalance between both patient groups. In HIV-infected patients, CMV retinitis is the most common manifestation of CMV disease, whereas this disease entity is extremely rare in transplant recipients [49] . A large increase in vitreous MBL levels in patients with endophthalmitis and retinal vasculitis has been described compared to non-inflamed eyes [50] . Although speculative, this suggests that MBL levels in general might be lower in the eye and therefore biologically not active against CMV. Our study was not designed to assess differences in MBL and ficolin levels between cases with CMV retinitis and those with other disease localisation. Another limitation is the lack of information on CMV viremia and CMV replication dynamics in the context of MBL levels. Indeed, patients with high CMV viremia do show an increased risk for CMV retinitis and might benefit from a pre-emptive antiviral therapy [51] . CMV disease, particularly CMV retinitis and CMV colitis, is often associated with absent or low level CMV viremia/antigenemia. However, other studies reported a poor positive and negative predictive value of CMV viremia in regard of CMV disease [52, 53, 54] . In this study, we focused on ''CMV disease'' as a clinical important outcome. A prospective study might address the association between viremia and MBL in more details.",
