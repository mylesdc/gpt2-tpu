Therefore, this study divided the entire population into a healthcare worker (HCW) group and the community (C) group to consider the heterogeneity of. After dividing the population into the HCW and C groups, each group was subdivided into the Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infectious (I), Hospitalized (J), Isolationtreated (Q), and Recovered (R) groups. During the isolated treatment period following the confirmed diagnosis, it is assumed that no spread of infection would occur. Since the J and R groups in the HCW and C groups have the same behavioral patterns, contact rates, and rates of transmission, they were not divided further into medical and non-medical groups. Figure 1 shows the flow of spread of EVD, and light blue color was used to demarcate the areas of the hospitals from the local community.",

Firstly, unlike Western Africa, where infection from the funeral customs was an important route for spreading, it was assumed that the Korean healthcare environment would not lead to infection through contact with the bodies of the deceased. In addition, all patients with EVD symptoms were assumed to be hospitalized and isolated. The duration from the day of onset of EVD symptoms to the day of hospitalization and isolation periods was set with reference to cases imported into the USA. Table   1 . The rate of transmission of infection ( ) is estimated by using the WHO report of new EVD case data for Sierra Leone at the time of the 2014 Western African EVD. EVD epidemic data were estimated by comparing data from the WHO's weekly accumulating patient number and that of the model from corresponding dates. It was also based on rates of transmission of infection that minimize the squared difference between the number of new cases from the data and from the model estimation, using the least square fitting method [2] . In parameter estimation, the direction of spread between the community and healthcare worker groups was not considered. In other words,",

            "text": "Flowchart of EVD modelThe S group, which has never contracted Ebola virus, is exposed to the virus through infected and hospitalized patients. It has been hypothesized that the spread of virus would be different depending on whether the infected and hospitalized patients are local community members or healthcare workers. The subscripts of each item, H and C, indicate the healthcare worker group andcommunity group, respectively. The model constant specifies the rate of transmission of infection, and the subscripts onto demonstrate the route of transmission. For instance, refers to the rate of spread in the case where infected persons from the community spread the virus to healthcare workers. The \u03bb was set by combining the different rates of infection from each group. Patients exposed to the virus become infected and can propagate the virus following a certain period. The constant is the rate of progression in the symptom onset of EVD, and 1/ signifies the mean latent period of EVD. Patients with the onset of symptoms will be hospitalized after a certain period of time. The rate of hospitalization of infected patients is indicated by , and 1/\u03b1 is the average duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization. Hospitalized patients become confirmed EVD cases through confirmatory diagnostic testing, and it is assumed that confirmed EVD patients will be isolated thereafter. The ratio of hospitalized patients to be isolated after confirmed diagnoses is defined as constant , and 1/\u03b4 is the average duration of hospitalized patients to be isolated after their confirmed diagnoses. The constant indicates the recovery rate of the isolated patients, and 1/ signifies the mean isolation period for recovery. It is presumed that after the patients have been isolated, no further propagation can occur to susceptible patients. The mathematical model of the spread of EVD infection is as follows: The definition and values of the parameters in the spread model of Korean EVD are shown in",
