            "text": "Health planners use forecasts of key metrics associated with influenza-like illness (ILI); near-term weekly incidence, week of season onset, week of peak, and intensity of peak. Here, we describe our participation in a weekly prospective ILI forecasting challenge for the United States for the 2016-17 season and subsequent evaluation of our performance. We implemented a metapopulation model framework with 32 model variants. Variants differed from each other in their assumptions about: the force-of-infection (FOI); use of uninformative priors; the use of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and the treatment of regions as either independent or coupled. Individual model variants were chosen subjectively as the basis for our weekly forecasts; however, a subset of coupled models were only available part way through the season. Most frequently, during the 2016-17 season, we chose; FOI variants with both school vacations and humidity terms; uninformative priors; the inclusion of discounted historical data for not-yet-observed time points; and coupled regions (when available). Our near-term weekly forecasts substantially over-estimated incidence early in the season when coupled models were not available. However, our forecast accuracy improved in absolute terms and relative to other teams once coupled solutions were available. In retrospective analysis, we found that the 2016-17 season was not typical: on average, coupled models performed better when fit without historically augmented data. Also, we tested a simple ensemble model for the 2016-17 season and found that it underperformed our subjective choice for all forecast targets. In this study, we were able to improve accuracy during a prospective forecasting exercise by coupling dynamics between regions. Although reduction of forecast subjectivity should be a long-term goal, some degree of human intervention is likely to improve forecast accuracy in the mediumterm in parallel with the systematic consideration of more sophisticated ensemble approaches.",

Influenzalike illness (ILI) describes a set of symptoms and is a practical way for health-care workers PLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.to easily estimate likely influenza cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects and disseminates ILI information, and has, for the last several years, run a forecasting challenge (the CDC Flu Challenge) for modelers to predict near-term weekly incidence, week of season onset, week of peak, and intensity of peak. We have developed a modeling framework that accounts for a range of mechanisms thought to be important for influenza transmission, such as climatic conditions, school vacations, and coupling between different regions. In this study we describe our forecast procedure for the 2016-17 season and highlight which features of our models resulted in better or worse forecasts. Most notably, we found that when the dynamics of different regions are coupled together, the forecast accuracy improves. We also found that the most accurate forecasts required some level of forecaster interaction, that is, the procedure could not be completely automated without a reduction in accuracy.",

Therefore, the efficient provision of elective procedures and other non-seasonal health care can be improved by accurate forecasts of seasonal influenza. Implicitly, most temperate health systems use knowledge of historical scenarios with which to plan for their influenza season. The current situation is then assessed against the deviation from the historical averages and worst-cases as observed in their own surveillance system.",

Because we require an absolute number of cases per week, the CDC ILINet data is converted from percent ILI cases per patient to ILI cases. We estimate the absolute number of weekly ILI cases by dividing the weighted percent of ILI cases in the CDC data by 100 and multiplying it by the total weekly number of patients.

The 2011 NAMCS [18] and NHAMCS surveys [19] estimated ambulatory visit rates of 3.32 visits per capita per year for physician's offices, 0.43 for hospital emergency departments and 0.33 hospital outpatient departments. We sum these rates to get an outpatient visit per capita-year of 4.08. We further estimate from the surveys that only half of these outpatient clinics are sites that report to ILINet, and hence we rounded to our two outpatient visits per year estimate.",

First, for the parameters we were informing, there was little correlation.

The Gaussian informed prior provides a simple way to penalize the likelihood when the parameter values sampled by the MCMC procedure are far from what was observed in a past similar season.

            "text": "Models that included humidity forcing performed better on average in our analysis of all historical data than equivalent models that did not include those terms, especially for the forecasting of ILI 1-to 4-weeks ahead [34] . However, we did not see similar support for the inclusion of school vacation terms improving accuracy, which has been suggested in a retrospective forecasting study at smaller spatial scales (by this group) [35] . The lack of support for school vacations in the present study could indicate that the prior work was under-powered or that averaging of school vacation effects across large spatial scales-both in the data and the model-degrades its contribution to forecast accuracy. Also, we chose to present our accuracy of predicting peak height and timing relative to actual epidemiological week so that it was consistent with our presentation of accuracy of other forecast targets. However, it may be more appropriate in some circumstances to present accuracy of targets associated with the peak relative to the eventual peak [10] .",

The green circle in each HHS region denotes the population density weighted location of the centroid of the region, and the radius of each circle is proportional to the weight of the region which is determined by its relative population. The population of each region is denoted on the map next to the centroid. Top, middle and bottom rows are onset week, peak week and peak intensity. The NULL result is calculated using the historic mean regional profile. The ensemble mode is the average of the 32 model variants. For all three targets, and all ten regions, the coupled method does better than the uncoupled with the details of the prior and force of infection models depending on the region. For nearly all targets and regions the selected model does better than the ensemble model. To view this Figure better please use the 'zoom' tool when opening it with a PDF viewer.

The Pearson correlation between the 1-, 2-, 3-and 4-week forward nation forecast calculated using all models and all 28 weeks of the 2016-17 CDC challenge. For the 1 \u2212 4 weeks forward forecasts the correlation within coupled models and uncoupled models is greater than between uncoupled and coupled. As the prediction horizon increases the correlation between models decreases significantly, but it remains high for the coupled models. ",

In the method/model labels (y-axis): UN-uncoupled and C-coupled. H, V, HV and F denote the four models for the force of infection: Humidity only, vacation only, both and fixed. The prior models are: uniform prior (UP), informed prior (IP), heated informed prior (HIP), data augmentation (DA), and heated data augmentation (HDA). Selected, is what we selected each week, the NULL model is the historic average and the ensemble is the average of the 32 model variants. Models are arranged based on their overall performance during the entire season (numbers on the right y-axis) from best (top) to worst (bottom). For all ten regions, and in agreement with the results for the nation, the coupled procedure performs better than the uncoupled. For nearly all regions and forecasts lead times the selected option does better than the ensemble model. To view this Figure better please use the 'zoom' tool when opening it with a PDF viewer.
