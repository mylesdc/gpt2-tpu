Currently, expensive and time-consuming biological assays can only determine a very small portion of all RPIs, which calls for computational approaches to help biologists efficiently and correctly find candidate RPIs. Here, we integrated a successful computing algorithm, conjoint triad feature (CTF), and another method, chaos game representation (CGR), for representing RNA-protein pairs and by doing so developed a prediction model based on these representations and random forest (RF) classifiers. When testing two benchmark datasets, RPI369 and RPI2241, the combined method (CTF+CGR) showed some superiority compared with four existing tools. Especially on RPI2241, the CTF+CGR method improved prediction accuracy (ACC) from 0.91 (the best record of all published works) to 0.95. When independently testing a newly constructed dataset, RPI1449, which only contained experimentally validated RPIs released between 2014 and 2016, our method still showed some generalization capability with an ACC of 0.75. Accordingly, we believe that our hybrid CTF+CGR method will be an important tool for predicting RPIs in the future.",

A variety of functional RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), usually work biologically through RNA-Protein Complexes (RPC) formed by the interactions between RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and these RNA macromolecules. Invalid interactions or mispairing could lead to human disease [10, 11] or pathogen resistance in plants [12, 13] . Therefore, determining whether a given RNA and a given RNA binding protein can form interactions or not is an essential prerequisite for dissection of RNA functions and regulatory mechanisms.",

Nowadays, there are 1973 RPI complexes available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB, as of March 2017), which contains over 15,000 protein chains and more than 3,000 RNA chains. However, according to research using high-throughput sequencing techniques (such as RNA-Seq), at least 30,000 lncRNAs were identified by 2013 [16] . This number will increase rapidly every year, and specifically, studies have identified over 60,000 eRNAs in 2015 [17, 18] . Obviously, the majority of those are not partnered with their target proteins (if they have partners), which calls for in silico prediction of RPIs.",

In the same year, Bellucci et al. [20] developed a tool, called catRAPID, to give rapid predictions of RPIs by training on 592 RNA-protein pairs from the PDB. They used the physicochemical properties of sequences as features and found three most predictive features: secondary structure propensities, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals [20] . Thereafter, Muppirala et al. [21] employed an idea from the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) prediction area, called Conjoint Triad Feature (CTF), to formulate protein sequences and then used normalized 4-gram frequencies to encode RNA sequences. They also constructed two benchmark datasets, called RPI369 and RPI2241, from PRIDB (a database of protein-RNA interfaces) [22] and achieved remarkable prediction accuracies by using CTF and 4-gram features on these two datasets. Two years later, Wang et al. [23] proposed a novel extended naive-Bayes-classifier to predict RPIs using the similar features of Muppirala et al. [21] Similar to catRAPID, Lu et al. [24] used the secondary structure, hydrogen-bonding, and the Van der Waals' propensities as features and then employed matrix multiplication to give a score for each protein-lncRNA pairs obtained from the PDB database.",

[25] integrated sequence information and predicted structure together to produce an accurate prediction of non-coding RNA-protein pairs on a newly-constructed dataset, called RPI1807. When tested on the RPI369 and RPI2241 datasets mentioned above, some improvements were achieved on prediction accuracies. Recently, Corrado et al. [26] developed a recommender system, named RNAcommender, to suggest candidate mRNA targets to the given RBPs by considering the domain information of proteins and predicted the structural information of RNA on datasets from the AURA 2, [27] which is a comprehensive database of experimentally determined interactions between transcription factor and human and mouse UTRs (untranslated regions in mRNAs). In 2016, Akbaripour-Elahabad et al. [28] integrated repetitive patterns and sequence motifs together with other traditional sequence composition features to predict RPIs, and the comparisons with other methods showed improvements on several of the datasets used previously.",

To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports in the area of RPI prediction that used the combination of CTF + CGR. CTF is a fundamental group of features to recognize the interaction of RNA and proteins and was shown to be successful in the majority of published prediction tools [21, 23, 25, 28] . Furthermore, CGR is an important group of features for protein studies and achieved remarkable results in many prediction tools [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Detailed comparisons with existing tools using RPI369 and RPI2241 demonstrated that the combinations of these two features indeed got achieved improvements, suggesting that our prediction model will be an important tool for RPI prediction.",

After that, another important task was to choose a powerful machine-learning algorithm or a classifier to discriminate true RPIs and non-RPIs based on the above representations. We employed random forest as our classifier, which had been proven as a successful tool for predicting RPIs [21, 24, 28] .

From the above three criteria, 1449 RNA-protein pairs (in dataset RPI1449) were considered as the independent test dataset (see Table 4 ). For a blind independent test, all the 1449 newly built RNA-protein pairs were put into the prediction model, which was previously developed based on the RPI2241 dataset, and then recorded the corresponding prediction accuracy. Note that RPI2241 was built in 2011, while 1449 RNA-protein pairs were constructed based on the RNA-protein complexes that were released between 2014 and 2016 in the PDB database. Therefore, no overlap exists between these two datasets, and the experiment is called the blind independent test. We compared our prediction result with the method of Muppirala et al [21] . on the independent test using the measurement of accuracy. The comparison results are shown in Table 4 , which indicate that 1092 out of 1449 RNA-protein pairs were correctly predicted in the independent test, leading to a predicting accuracy of 0.7536.

There are two advantages of RF: 1) easy training that requires researchers to tune only two internal parameters, 'ntree and mtry' during the training approach, and 2) powerful prediction ability on various datasets when comparing other machine-learning or statistical methods. These properties have helped make RF become one of the most successful machine-learning tools in the last two decades. Actually, it is an ensemble machine learning method whose prediction result is voted by a certain number of decision trees. Each tree is independently constructed with a bootstrap sample of the training set. Additionally, comprehensive theory and wide applications of RF can be found in a famous paper written by Breiman [37] . Here, we adopt a MATLAB toolbox of RF, which is available at http://code. google.com/p/randomforest-matlab/, to train and test our model. We chose the optimal combination of the two parameters of 'ntree' in [300,500] and mtry in [1,n] (n is the number of the total features in that dataset) and adopted the grid optimization to find the globe optimal solution.",

A number of previous studies all used CTF as representations of RNA-protein pairs and achieved remarkable prediction performances [21, 23, 25] ; CTF was considered the most important feature for RPI prediction. Up to this point, our work has shown that prediction performance can be significantly improved by adding CGR representations, which is the most significant finding of our current study. For detailed information of prediction results, when training and cross validating two benchmark datasets, RPI369 and RPI2241, the combined representation of CTF + CGR achieved the best prediction performance. Compared with four existing tools [21, 23, 25, 28] , the prediction model constructed from the combinatorial features of CTF + CGR showed some improvements, especially on RPI2241. Furthermore, a new independent testing dataset, RPI1449, was built using new experimentally validated RNA-protein interactions, and a blind independent test was performed. The corresponding prediction accuracy of 0.7536 demonstrated that our method has some generalization capability. In conclusion, the combinational representation of CTF + CGR appears to be a powerful method for RPI prediction, and our model based on CTF + CGR and random forest may prove to be an important tool for prediction of RPIs.
