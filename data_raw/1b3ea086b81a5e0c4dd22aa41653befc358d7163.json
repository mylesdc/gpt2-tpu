            "text": "Ebola viruses (EBOV) are filamentous single-stranded RNA viruses of the family Filoviridae. Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) causes severe haemorrhagic fever in humans, great apes and non-human primates (NHPs) with high fatality rates. In contrast, Reston ebolavirus (REBOV), the only species found outside Africa, is lethal to some NHPs but has never been linked to clinical disease in humans despite documented exposure. REBOV was isolated from pigs in the Philippines and subsequent experiments confirmed the susceptibility of pigs to both REBOV and ZEBOV with predilection for the lungs. However, only ZEBOV caused severe lung pathology in 5-6 weeks old pigs leading to respiratory distress. To further elucidate the mechanisms for lung pathology, microarray analysis of changes in gene expression was performed on lung tissue from ZEBOV-infected pigs. Furthermore, systemic effects were monitored by looking at changes in peripheral blood leukocyte subsets and systemic cytokine responses. Following oro-nasal challenge, ZEBOV replicated mainly in the respiratory tract, causing severe inflammation of the lungs and consequently rapid and difficult breathing. Neutrophils and macrophages infiltrated the lungs but only the latter were positive for ZEBOV antigen. Genes for proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins, known to attract immune cells to sites of infection, were upregulated in the lungs, causing the heavy influx of cells into this site. Systemic effects included a decline in the proportion of monocyte/dendritic and B cells and a mild proinflammatory cytokine response. Serum IgM was detected on day 5 and 6 post infection. In conclusion, a dysregulation/over-activation of the pulmonary proinflammatory response may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ZEBOV infection in 5-6 weeks old pigs by attracting inflammatory cells to the lungs.",

            "text": "Until recently, NHPs were considered the only animal species susceptible to REBOV. In 2008, REBOV was detected in pigs coinfected with porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) in the Philippines. Antibodies to REBOV were also detected in humans that had been in close contact with the infected pigs, suggesting pig to human transmission [4] . Since these pigs were co-infected with PRRSV, it was not clear whether the observed clinical signs were due to REBOV or the co infecting virus. Subsequent experimental challenge suggested that REBOV infection in pigs may be asymptomatic despite replication of the virus in the lungs and shedding in nasopharyngeal secretions [5] . Nevertheless, the emergence of REBOV in pigs had prompted our group to investigate whether the African EBOV species could also infect pigs [6] . Using experimental challenge with the highly pathogenic ZEBOV, we observed clinical disease in pigs in the form of fever, severe respiratory distress characterized by rapid abdominal breathing; inappetence and lethargy [6] . In addition, the infected pigs could transmit virus to contact animals. Gross pathological lesions included pulmonary consolidation, enlarged and sometimes haemorrhagic lung associated lymph nodes. Histopathology lesions consisted of alveolitis characterized by haemorrhage, presence of fibrin, neutrophils and macrophages in alveoli as well as inflammatory cells in thickened alveolar walls. Viral antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells, macrophages and in inflammatory exudates in trachea. Apparently, experimen-tal ZEBOV and REBOV in pigs seem to target the respiratory system but only the former induces overt clinical disease [5, 6] .",

Cellular changes included the infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes into alveoli, with macrophages being the only leukocyte subset in the lungs that stained positive for ZEBOV. The aim of the current report was to further elucidate the mechanisms involved in the cellular infiltration into the lungs, by using a porcine microarray to analyze changes in mRNA transcription for a range of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins in porcine lungs. In addition, we aimed to characterize the cellular infiltrates into the lungs using cell type-specific surface markers, also permitting the definitive identification of the cells harbouring ZEBOV antigen.

Animal use was approved by the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health animal care committee under animal use document (AUD) # C-11-004. The Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines were followed for all animal manipulations. Experiment 1. The experimental design and part of the data from this experiment has been published [6] . In the current report lung sections from this experiment were used for a porcine microarray to analyse changes in proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine transcription. Briefly, eight 4-5 weeks old pigs were obtained from a commercial farm in Manitoba and allowed an acclimatization period of at least 1 week at NCFAD. These pigs were negative for PRRSV and porcine circovirus -2 (PCV-2). Six pigs were given inhalation anaesthesia and then inoculated with 10 6 PFU of ZEBOV in sterile PBS per pig via the intranasal, intraocular and oral routes [6] . Two control pigs were mock inoculated with PBS and housed separately. Two ZEBOVinfected pigs were euthanized at 3, 5 and 7 days post infection (DPI) respectively and tissues collected. Mock infected pigs were also euthanized at DPI 7. Lung sections for microarray were stored at 270uC and processed as described subsequently. Experiment 2. Experiment 2 was a repeat of experiment 1 aimed at further investigating the findings in experiment 1 as well as the systemic effects of ZEBOV infection in pigs. Six pigs of the same age group and source as in experiment 1 were acclimatized and inoculated with ZEBOV as described above. Clinical signs were recorded daily. In addition, rectal temperatures were recorded and swabs (oral, rectal and nasal) collected in PBS for each pig before inoculation, and at 1, 3 and 5 or 6 days post inoculation (DPI) under inhalation anaesthesia. Blood was collected from each pig into BD vacutainer CPT TM cell preparation tubes with sodium citrate (Becton Dickinson, New Jersey, USA) at the indicated time points. Three pigs were euthanized at DPI 5 and 3 at DPI 6 and tissues collected for virus isolation and pathology.",

            "text": "Using specific surface markers, we have confirmed that alveolar macrophages were the only infiltrating leukocyte subset in the lungs susceptible to ZEBOV. The susceptibility of human/NHP macrophages to EBOV is well documented [14] . However, to the best of our knowledge, the presence of multinucleated cells within alveoli in the current report is a first in EBOV infection of any species. These cells could have possibly been in the lungs prior to ZEBOV infection since these pigs were not specific pathogen free. Nevertheless, the fact that the cells were positive for ZEBOV antigen would suggest that these giant cells could be a consequence of ZEBOV infection. Similar giant cells believed to be of macrophage lineage, were present in human lungs in fatal cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome but absent in ante-mortem samples [15, 16] . Interestingly, fatal ZEBOV infection in pigs manifests as a severe acute respiratory disease. We have revealed the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in lungs of ZEBOV-infected pigs. A network of cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins possibly interacted in the lungs of these pigs culminating in severe inflammation as suggested in our model in Figure 2 . This inflammatory process possibly occurred in a cyclical fashion, with an initial induction of cytokines in resident alveolar cells, followed by the attraction of more cells into the lungs and then further amplification of the inflammatory process. For example, human neutrophils exposed to EBOV in vitro, though not infected, rapidly activate triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) [17] which results in the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines that in turn attract more cells to the site via induction of vasodilation and increased vascular permeability [14] . Specifically, IL-8 is a strong attractant for neutrophils [18] while IL-5 is known to recruit and activate eosinopils at sites of inflammation [19] . Meanwhile, IL-22 activates IL-6 secretion and both cytokines are potent inducers of acute phase proteins which are also chemoattractants for inflammatory cells [20, 21] . In addition, alveolar macrophagederived chemotactic factor (AMCF-II) acts as a chemoactractant for neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils to the lungs [18, 22] . Other chemokines and chemokine ligands, most of which are induced by proinflammatory cytokines, also act as chemoattractants for these cells [23] . Furthermore, selectins enable cell adhesion and extravasation, thereby facilitating cell migration to sites of inflammation [24] . Moreover, the high and rapid upregulation of palate, lung and nasal epithelium associated (PLUNC) gene, a marker of airway inflammation [25] , conforms to the degree of inflammation observed in the lungs of ZEBOVinfected pigs. In addition, the increase in transcripts of markers (CD14 and CD163) and PRRs expressed on macrophages appears to correlate with the increased presence of these cells within the lungs. Similar proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses leading to infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages and other leukocytes into the lungs were linked to respiratory distress in pigs infected with highly pathogenic PRRSV [26] , hence the clinical picture observed in pigs co-infected with PRRSV and REBOV in the Philippines in 2008 [4] .",

            "text": "How does the EBOV-induced lung disease in pigs compare to primates, including humans? Apparently, the same cytokine profile, including IL-6, IL-8, IFN-c, IL-10 and chemoattractants, exists in both porcine and human/NHP ZEBOV infection. In both cases disease is linked to dysregulation of the proinflammatory response [1, 6, 14, 17, 28] . However, a major difference between ZEBOV in pigs and humans/NHPs is the site of the cytokine response. In pigs the response is more localized in the lungs with very mild systemic involvement while in humans/NHPs it is predominantly systemic. In addition, the high induction of tissue specific chemoactractants such as PLUNC [25] and AMCF-II [22] seems to further favour a severe pulmonary involvement in pigs. Nevertheless, difficult and rapid breathing have been observed in ZEBOV-infected human patients but were associated to underlying metabolic defects rather than pulmonary pathology [29, 30] . Furthermore, a chimpanzee naturally infected with CIEBOV had no gross pathological lesions and only few antigen positive alveolar macrophages in the lungs [31] . However, when rhesus monkeys were aerosol exposed to ZEBOV, they developed what was described as a bronchocentric pattern of interstitial pneumonia. Additionally, there was an increase in number of leukocytes including antigen-positive alveolar macrophages [32] . However, as opposed to what we have observed in pigs, the leukocytosis in monkeys was diffuse [32] . Indeed, we also noticed that although alveolar macrophages were the only leukocyte subset positive for ZEBOV in both NHPs and pigs, there was a significant difference between the 2 species in the type and numbers of cells infiltrating the lungs [33] . Macrophages were the main cells in NHP lungs as opposed to pigs that had a high density of both macrophages and neutrophils in their lungs. The underlying mechanisms for these differences are the subject of further investigation. Differences in type and range of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced in the lungs might be a factor. Note that NHPs challenged with EBOV by both parenteral or aerosol routes develop systemic disease involving numerous organs [32] . This is clearly different in pigs in which induction of proinflammatory molecules and disease is mainly in the lungs, with less pronounced systemic involvement.",

The mechanism for this depletion is not entirely clear. As in human/NHP, the direct infection of monocytes by EBOV could lead to cell death [34, 35] . Similar to the reports in humans/NHPs, porcine B and T lymphocytes are not infected by ZEBOV. The apparent decline in B cells and no effect on T cells in peripheral blood of infected swine is contrary to observations in humans/ NHPs. Depletion of T cells and not B cells as a consequence of bystander apoptosis is seen in human/NHPs [1] . The B cell depletion in infected pigs might also be due to bystander apoptosis; however additional mechanisms such as migration into spleen and lymph nodes could be involved.",
