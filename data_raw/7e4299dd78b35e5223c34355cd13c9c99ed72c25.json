            "text": "It has been reported that human bufavirus was detected predominantly in patients with diarrhoea in several countries. However, little is known about bufavirus or its close relatives in nonhuman mammals. In this study, we performed nested-PCR screening and identified bufavirus from 12 megabats of Pteropus spp. in Indonesia. Furthermore, we determined nearly the full genome sequence of a novel megabat-borne bufavirus, tentatively named megabat bufavirus 1. Phylogenetic analyses showed that megabat bufavirus 1 clustered with known protoparvoviruses, including human bufavirus but represented a distinct lineage of bufavirus. Our analyses also inferred phylogenetic relationships among animal-borne bufaviruses recently reported by other studies. Recombination analyses suggested that the most common recent ancestor of megabat bufavirus 1 might have arisen from multiple genetic recombination events. These results characterized megabat bufavirus 1 as the first protoparvovirus discovered from megabats and indicates the high genetic divergence of bufavirus.",

Megabats and microbats mainly consist of frugivorous bats and insectivorous bats, respectively 15 . In addition to their biological differences, they are phylogenetically distinguishable 16, 17 . Megabats are a potential reservoir of emerging zoonotic viruses, including Nipah virus, Hendra virus, SARS coronavirus and Ebola virus 18, 19 . In addition, a metagenomic study showed that megabats harbour various mammalian viruses, some of which are genetically related to human viruses 20 . However, BuVs or related parvoviruses were detected in microbats but not in megabats. In the present study, we investigated BuVs in flying foxes (Pteropus spp.), which belong to the megabat family. Based on the obtained sequence data, we examined the phylogenetic relationships between the identified-BuVs and previously identified BuVs. One of the BuVs identified in this study was further characterized and we obtained a nearly full genome sequence.",

In an earlier study, BuV was detected from the spleen tissues and faeces of shrews 9 . Therefore, we used nested-PCR targeting for the NS1 gene of BuV using 183 spleens and 96 faeces samples (faecal samples were unavailable for a subset of megabats). As shown in Table 1 , BuV was identified in three spleen and nine faeces specimens from Pteropus vampyrus, and one spleen specimen from Pteropus sp. Among these, one Pteropus vampyrus in Magelang was positive for BuV in both the spleen and faeces. With a limited number of samples, the detection rate of BuV in spleen (2%) was lower than that in faeces (9%).",

The obtained genome sequence of MgBuV1 (accession number LC085675) was 4765 nt in size and encoded three complete ORFs: the non-structural protein (NS1) and the viral capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2). These proteins showed 46-61% amino acid sequence identities to those of other BuVs of which complete genome sequences were available ( ( Fig. 2 ). NS1 contained a putative endonuclease metal coordination motif \"HIH\" and the helicase motif Walker A \"GPASTGKS\". The VP1 of most parvovirus species possesses a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) motif that is required for viral entry 22 . Three potential sites responsible for the enzymatic activity of PLA2 were strictly conserved in the VP1 of MgBuV1: a calcium-binding loop site \"YLGPG\" and two catalytic sites \"HDLEY\" and \"D\". The N-terminus of the VP1 and VP2 of MgBuV1 had a glycine-rich motif (G-rich) required for the cellular entry of parvovirus 23 .",

These sequences covered a partial coding region of NS1 and almost complete to complete coding regions of VP1 and VP2 (Fig. 2) . Therefore, using the coding region of VP2, we performed a phylogenetic analysis to infer the deeper phylogenetic relationships between these microbat-borne BuVs and megabat-borne MgBuV1 (Fig. 3 ). All microbat-borne BuVs formed a single cluster (group 5, Fig. 3 ). MgBuV1 branched from the common ancestor of human BuVs, non human primate-borne BuV (WUHARV parvovirus) and pig-borne BuV, and represented a distinct lineage of BuV (linage 4, Fig. 3 ). WUHARV parvovirus (linage 3, Fig. 3 ) fell into the cluster of human BuVs (group 2, Fig. 3 ), consistent with a previous study of past recombination events behind the origin of WUHARV parvovirus 13 . We searched for putative recombination events on the genome of MgBuV1 using two different approaches based on sliding window analyses, one using the Bootscan approach and the second using Bayesian inference (Fig. 4A,B) . Both analyses suggested a mosaic genome structure in MgBuV1 and possible recombinations among ancestors of MgBuV1, WUHARV parvovirus and porcine parvovirus Zsana, around nucleotide positions 778 to 2384 of the MgBuV1 genome (Fig. 4C) . These observations were supported by independent phylogenetic trees built from five regions bordered by the inferred recombination breakpoints (Fig. 5A-E) . Among the BuVs and related protoparvoviruses, MgBuV1 branched from the ancestor of porcine parvovirus Zsana in the phylogenetic tree at position 778 to 1219 (Fig. 5B) and position 1856 to 2384 (Fig. 5D) . However, MgBuV1 branched from its ancestor WUHARV parvovirus at position 1219 to 1856 in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5C ). In contrast, MgBuV1 formed a distinct lineage in phylogenetic trees constructed from position 2384 to 4765 (Fig. 5E ). Based on this evidence, we inferred the parsimonious origin of the mosaic genome in MgBuV1 from both recombination analyses (Fig. 4C) . ",

However, the phylogenetic relationships among these viruses remains to be elucidated. Our phylogenetic analyses covered the available sequences of these BuVs and showed a large degree of genetic divergence of BuV in the genus Protoparvovirus. Both phylogenetic analyses based on NS1 and VP2 genes showed that a group of BuVs comprised host-specific lineages and megabat-borne BuVs were clearly distinguished from microbat-borne BuVs. While the phylogeny of BuV is likely to be associated with their host, further studies of BuVs in animals are needed to infer the virus-host coevolution.",

Additionally, this study implemented a second analysis approach over the same sliding window that incorporated the power of Bayesian inference to support or reject hypotheses regarding the topology of the phylogenetic tree. For each window, a hypothesis of the clustering of two particular sequences was tested against the null hypothesis that the cluster was less likely than those sequences independently clustering with any other under the same model parameters. To maximize the inferential power of the approach, the marginal likelihoods of the models assuming opposite topological hypotheses were compared with the stepping stone 37 sampling approach implemented in MrBayes 3.2. Then, the difference of the calculated marginal likelihoods for both models, i.e., the model assuming a clustering and the model without the clustering, represented the Bayes factor, which usually is interpreted as supporting the first model if the difference exceeds three and strongly supportive when it exceeds five 38 .
