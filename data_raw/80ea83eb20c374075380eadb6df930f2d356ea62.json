            "text": "The synthesis of inactive enzyme precursors, also known as ''zymogens,'' serves as a mechanism for regulating the execution of selected catalytic activities in a desirable time and/or site. Zymogens are usually activated by proteolytic cleavage. Many viruses encode proteases that execute key proteolytic steps of the viral life cycle. Here, we describe a proof of concept for a therapeutic approach to fighting viral infections through eradication of virally infected cells exclusively, thus limiting virus production and spread. Using the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model, we designed two HCV NS3 protease-activated ''zymogenized'' chimeric toxins (which we denote ''zymoxins''). In these recombinant constructs, the bacterial and plant toxins diphtheria toxin A (DTA) and Ricin A chain (RTA), respectively, were fused to rationally designed inhibitor peptides/ domains via an HCV NS3 protease-cleavable linker. The above toxins were then fused to the binding and translocation domains of Pseudomonas exotoxin A in order to enable translocation into the mammalian cells cytoplasm. We show that these toxins exhibit NS3 cleavage dependent increase in enzymatic activity upon NS3 protease cleavage in vitro. Moreover, a higher level of cytotoxicity was observed when zymoxins were applied to NS3 expressing cells or to HCV infected cells, demonstrating a potential therapeutic window. The increase in toxin activity correlated with NS3 protease activity in the treated cells, thus the therapeutic window was larger in cells expressing recombinant NS3 than in HCV infected cells. This suggests that the ''zymoxin'' approach may be most appropriate for application to life-threatening acute infections where much higher levels of the activating protease would be expected.

            "text": "Previously, Alexander Varshavsky suggested the construction of a new kind of toxins referred as ''sitoxins'', a concept that artificially combines several functional protein domains to produce a therapeutically effective molecule. More specifically, a sitoxin is comprised of an effector domain, a domain bearing an intracellular signaling moiety; and a polypeptidic sequence located between the effector domain and the domain bearing the intracellular signaling moiety which specifies a cleavage site for a predetermined protease. Following the introduction of the sitoxin into the target cell (that expresses the specific protease), cleavage by the protease separates the effector domain of the sitoxin from the intracellular signaling moiety, resulting either in a longer-lived (and therefore more toxic) effector domain or in an effector domain that moves from a cellular compartment where the domain is nontoxic to a cellular compartment where the domain is able to exert its toxic effect [5] . This strategy was previously applied by Falnes et al., who described the construction of diphtheria toxin based sitoxins that contain a signal for N-endrule-mediated degradation just upstream of a cleavage site for the protease from HIV type 1. In-vitro cleavage by the viral protease substantially increased the ability of the toxins to inhibit cellular protein synthesis; however, the toxins were unable to selectively eradicate HIV-1-infected cells, apparently due to low cytosolic HIV-1 protease activity [6] .",

Domain 3 (a.a.395-613) is the ADP-ribosylating domain that inactivates elongation factor 2 and causes cell death. The pathway of toxin entry includes 1) binding to a surface receptor -PE binds and enters mammalian cells via binding of domain 1 to the alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor/low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) which is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues and cell types [7] . 2). Internalization via coated pits to endosomes. 3) Proteolytic cleavage between Arg-279 and Gly-280 within domain 2 and reduction of disulfide bonds [8] . This proteolytic cleavage is mediated by the cellular protease furin, generates the active Cterminal fragment (residues 280-613). 4) Finally, the enzymatically active C-terminal fragment is translocated by retrograde transport through the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum and from there to the cytosol [9, 10, 11] .

DT is cleaved at the surface of sensitive eukaryotic cells by the enzyme furin, and following receptor (the heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like precursor) binding, the di-chain protein that is linked by a single disulfide bond is internalized into clathrin coated pits and reaches the lumen of a developing endosome.

The toxin consists of two chains linked together by a disulfide bond, one chain of approximately 30 KDa with N-glycosidase enzymatic activity (the A chain), and one of approximately 35 KDa with lectin properties which binds carbohydrate ligands on target cell surface (the B chain) [17] . Cell-bound ricin is taken up by endocytosis. From here, most of the toxin molecules are recycled back to the cell surface or transported to the lysosomes and degraded.

Two virally encoded proteases participate in polyprotein processing, the NS2-3 autoprotease (which cleaves in cis at the NS2-3 junction) and the NS3-4A serine protease (also commonly referred to as NS3 protease, which cleaves at four downstream NS protein junctions). NS3 is an extensively studied HCV protein that possesses multiple enzymatic activities that are essential for HCV replication. The N-terminus, in complex with its co-factor NS4A, primarily functions as a serine protease, which cleaves the viral polyprotein precursor downstream to NS3. The remaining 2/3 of the protein has a helicase and NTPase activities, both of which are essential for HCV replication [22] .",

These advances resulted in the establishment of currently used models to study hepatitis C virus in which recombinant infectious HCV particles (of genotype 2a strain JFH1 and other chimeric viruses generated in the JFH1 background) could be produced in Huh7 hepatoma-derived cell lines that are permissive for HCV replication.

In these constructs, which we denote ''zymoxins'' (zymogenized toxins), a rationally designed inhibitory peptide/domain is fused to the C terminus of the constitutively active toxins. The inhibitory domain is preceded by the NS3-sensitive NS5A/B junction sequence which cleavage by the viral protease liberates the toxin from the inhibitory moiety. These toxins exhibit considerable level of NS3 protease-dependent activation as was detected by in-vitro enzymatic assays, as well as when applied to NS3 expressing model cells (expressing cytosolic or membrane bound NS3). When tested on HCV infected cells, a less dramatic, but still significant enhancement of cytotoxicity was observed, suggesting that eradication of viral protease expressing cells at specific ranges of toxin concentrations can be achieved.",

This format was chosen based on our previous unpublished finding that the expression level of scNS3 in mammalian cells is greatly enhanced upon fusion of efficientlyexpressed proteins (such as EGFP) to its N terminus. In addition, another construct was made, comprising a fusion of EGFP and the full length NS3 (protease/RNA helicase) followed by full length NS4A (of the 1a HCV genotype) [36] . As opposed to EGFP-scNS3, which is predicted to be a predominantly cytoplasmic or nucleocytoplasmic protein with relatively low affinity to membranes, the EGFP-full length NS3 (which strongly interacts with the full length NS4A following auto-cleavage) is expected to be associated with intracellular membranes when expressed in mammalian cells, more precisely mimicking the intracellular localization of this complex in HCV infected cells. The reason for that is that the hydrophobic amino terminal domain of the NS4A directs the NS3-NS4A complex to the ER membrane or an ERlike modified compartment [20, 37, 38, 39, 40] .",

This plasmid, denoted pCMV/MBP-EGFP-NS5AB-CBD, encodes for a fusion of maltose binding protein (MBP), enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), the 10 amino acid minimal NS3 cleavage sequence (P6-P49) from HCV NS5A/B site derived from HCV genotype 1b/1a ( for both 1b and 1a genotypes this sequence is identical) [41] and cellulose binding domain (CBD). As shown in Fig. 1 , addition of Tet to selected stable clones of the inducible system results in EGFP-scNS3 and EGFP-full NS3-4A expression, as assayed by fluorescence confocal microscopy ( Fig. 1B  and 1C , respectively) and immunoblotting (Fig. 1E, lower panel) . Regarding the intracellular localization of the proteases, EGFP-full NS3-4A was only partially colocalized with calnexin (ER) in these cells, but apparently was absent from the nucleus and has less diffuse distribution pattern in comparison to the nucleocytoplamic EGFP-scNS3, as was expected. A strong colocalization, however, was observed between EGFP-full NS3-4A and a chimeric fluorescent protein which was fused to the C-terminal ER membrane anchor of the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B [42] (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis also shows efficient cleavage of MBP-EGFP-NS5AB-CBD (referred to as the ''cleavable substrate'' (Fig. 1D) ) in cells transfected with pCMV/MBP-EGFP- immunofluorescence analysis of inducible NS3 expressing cells: 10 5 cells inducibly expressing EGFP-scNS3 or EGFP-full NS3-4A were seeded on coverslips in a 24 well-plate. After 12 hours, the cells were treated with 1mg/ml of tetracycline for 24 hours and then were fixed and permeabilized. Following immunostaining with rabbit anti-calnexin and Cy3-conjugated goat anti rabbit for ER visualization (red) and nuclei staining by Hoechst 33258 (Blue), slides were examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy.

Lower panel: in-vivo substrate cleavage by NS3: cells inducibly expressing EGFP-scNS3 were transfected with 2mg of the plasmid pCMV/MBP-EGFP-NS5AB-CBD (''cleavable substrate''-see scheme in D). After 24 hours, cells were treated with 1mg/ml of tetracycline or left untreated. 24 hours later, cells were lysed and 20mg protein from total cell extract where analyzed by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-EGFP antibodies (for detection of EGFP-scNS3) and mouse-serum anti-MBP (which is more sensitive than anti-EGFP in detecting the cleavage products of the substrate) followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL development (E). Bands corresponding to the full length substrate, cleaved substrate and EGFP-scNS3 are indicated by arrows. Similar results were obtained also in cells inducibly expressing EGFP-full NS3-A4. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0015916.g001 NS5AB-CBD and induced for NS3 expression (Fig. 1E) . A faint band, corresponding to the cleavage product, was also detected in a sample from uninduced cells. This is probably due to some degree of ''leakiness'' of the Tet inducible system, allowing a very low basal transcription of the protease in the absence of externally added Tet. In support to this assumption, only a single band corresponding to the full length substrate was detected when ''na\u00efve'' HEK293 T-Rex cells were transfected with the substrate encoding vector (data not shown).",

Considering that prediction, we assumed that a fusion of a bulky polypeptide moiety to the C terminus of DTA may hinder the toxin-substrate interaction. Furthermore, human alphadefensin 1 (HNP1) was found to neutralize toxins of the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase family (to which DTA belongs) [44] . To construct a zymoxin where the catalytic domain of DTA is inhibited by HNP1, and the inhibition is relieved by NS3 cleavage, we chose to fuse HNP1 to the C terminus of DTA. The HNP1 was preceded by the 10 amino acids minimal NS3 cleavage sequence (P6-P49) from HCV (genotype 1b/1a) NS5A/B site (referred to as ''cleavage site'') and a flexible linker of 15 amino acids rich in serine and glycine residues which should allow the HNP1 domain to ''fold back'' and interact with its interaction site on DTA. This construct was then fused in its N terminus to the binding and translocation domain of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) in order to enable internalization and trafficking to the cytosol of mammalian cells (demonstrated previously by Guidi-Rontani [45] ), as the natural binding and translocation domains of the diphtheria toxin, which are positioned to the C terminus of the W.T toxin, were substituted by the HNP1 polypeptide. In addition, a 6xHis tag followed by a KDEL ER retrieval signal were placed at the most C terminal portion of the construct (''PE-DTA-cleavage sitedefensin''), for facilitating the toxin purification and as the KDEL retrieval system is exploited by PE in order to reach the ER lumen [11] , respectively. This 6xHis-KDEL extension was positioned at the C terminus of all following chimeric constructs, which have been expressed in E. coli BL21 cells and purified from the periplasmic fraction as described in 'materials and methods'. As a control, an uncleavable chimeric toxin was constructed, in which the NS3 cleavage site was mutated by substituting P1 cysteine to arginine and P49 tyrosine to alanine (''PE-DTA-mutated cleavage site-defensin'', see scheme in Fig. 2A ). Protein sequences of the zymoxins described above, as well as all the zymoxins used in the study (that will be described later), can be found in supporting Text S1.",

In the recent years, several groups have investigated the nature of the this interaction and it was found that the conserved C terminus of the ribosome stalk proteins P1 and P2 interacts with both ricin and Shiga-like toxin 1 (SLT-1), another type II ribosome-inactivating protein, and this interaction is required for efficient ribosome binding and cytotoxicity. Moreover, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of the conserved C terminus of P1 and P2 was shown to inhibit the ribosome-inactivating function of SLT-1 [48, 49, 50] . Later on, the crystal structure of a similar peptide in complex with trichosanthin (TCS), a type I ribosome-inactivating protein (RIPs), was presented [51] . Based on these studies, we have cloned the coding sequence of the catalytic A chain of ricin (RTA), originated from Ricinus communis genomic DNA preparation, into a bacterial expression plasmid. Next, we have constructed a chimeric toxin in which two repeats of the acidic 16 residue peptide corresponding to the conserved C terminus of the ribosomal stalk proteins (EESEESDDDMGFGLFD) were fused to the C terminus of RTA.",

This construct was then fused in its N terminus to the binding and translocation domain of PE, as the natural binding and translocation domain of ricin toxin (RTB) undergoes N-glycosylation when produced in Ricinus communis, which is necessary for its lectin activity. By fusing RTA to the bacterially derived binding and translocation domains of PE, chimeric PE-RTA toxins that are capable of penetrating into the mammalian cell cytoplasm (demonstrated previously by Pitcher et al [52] ) may be produced in E. coli by standard methods. The enzymatic activity of RTA-based zymoxin is elevated following NS3 protease cleavage In order to assess the susceptibility of the RTA-zbased constructs to cleavage by NS3 and evaluate the influence of such cleavage on their ribosome depurination activity, an in-vitro cleavage reaction was carried out (as described for the diphtheria toxin chimera) following by ribosome depurination assay using the ''acidic aniline'' method on ribosomes from reticulocyte lysate [53, 54] . In this method, the phosphodiester bond at the 39 site of the depurinated adenine in the ricin treated rRNA is cleaved under treatment with aniline under acidic conditions, and a small fragment of about 460 nucleotides (''R fragment'') is released and can be detected by agarose or acrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide. A schematic representation of the PE-RTA chimeric toxins, the in-vitro cleavage and the ribosome depurination assay results are represented in Fig. 4 .",

This fragment was undetectable when ribosomes were treated with the same concentration of non-cleaved cleavable toxin (cleavable toxin without incubation with NS3) or with the uncleavable toxin ( Fig. 4B ). At higher toxin concentrations and in the presence of aniline, the R fragment could be detected after treatment with both the cleaved and the uncleavable toxins.

In contrast, toxicity of both cleavable zymoxins was enhanced upon treatment of full NS3-4A expressing Huh7.5 cells, demonstrating that NS3 expression is sufficient for sensitizing hepatoma-derived Huh7.5 cells to these toxins and further emphasizes the potential of these engineered toxins in eradication of NS3 expressing liver cells.",

            "text": "Varshavsky suggested an innovative concept for antiviral therapy based on the idea of taking advantage of a specific viral activity instead of inhibiting it. The proposed antiviral agents, which he denoted ''sitoxins'' (for ''signal-regulated cleavagemediated toxins''), were artificially composed of an intracellular signaling moiety that inactivates a toxin, e.g. a degradation signal, which can be cleaved off by a viral protease, resulting in a selective intoxication of virally infected cells [5] . In later studies, a slightly different strategy for construction of viral-protease activated agents was also applied. This strategy was based on a ''zymogenization'' of a potentially toxic enzyme, namely, converting a constitutively active enzyme to a protease-activatable form in a way which is not mediated by an intracellular signaling moiety. Such ''zymogenized'' agents were presented in three elegant studies in which Plasmodium falciparum, HIV and HCV protease activated zymogens were designed by circular permutation of bovine RNase A. the enzyme was modified to expose its natively structured active site only upon proteolytic cleavage specifically mediated by the above proteases, which elicited a profound enhancement in in-vitro RNase activity [63, 64, 65] . In another study that was carried out by Jucovic and colleagues, a random propeptide library was fused to the C-terminal end of Vip2, an actin modifying vegetative insecticidal protein (Vip) produced by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus cereus. By selecting for malfunctional fusion variants in yeast, they identified a Vip2 proenzyme with significantly reduced enzymatic activity and with the ability to be expressed as a transgene in corn plants without causing developmental pathology. Moreover, the engineered zymogen was still powerful enough to cause the mortality of western corn rootworm larvae, a major pest of corn in the United States, due to proteolytic activation in the rootworm digestive system [66] . Recently, Law et al have demonstrated the conversion of a natural zymogen, the maize ribosome inactivating protein (maize RIP), into an HIV proteaseactivated toxin [67] . The maize RIP is a type III ribosomeinactivating protein which in its native form is synthesized as inactive precursor (pro-RIP) and is activated by proteolytic removal of a 25 amino-acid inhibitory internal peptide in-planta [68, 69] . By replacing the first and the last 10 residues of the internal inactivation region with two HIV-protease recognition sequences, a modified zymogen toxin was prepared which showed enhanced enzymatic and anti-viral activity (it was demonstrated that several RIPs possess a potent antiviral activity [70] ) in HIV infected cells [67] . However, no data relating to differences between the cytotoxicity against uninfected vs. infected cells was provided; thus the potency of this re-engineered toxin in actual eradication of HIV infected cells cannot be determined. When treating retroviral infection, eradication of infected cells has an important ''added value'' over inhibition of viral replication and particle production in living cells. The reason for this is that the infected cells may contain an integrated proviral DNA in their genome, which can only be eliminated by destroying the cell itself. During our zymoxins study described herein, we have tried a similar approach in order to convert the maize RIP into an HCV protease-activated toxin. However, in our hands, insertion or replacement of sequences surrounding the internal inhibitory peptide with NS3 cleavable sequences did not generated a toxin that exhibits significant enhancement in cytotoxicity against NS3 expressing cells (unpublished data).",

Therefore, we first confirmed NS3 proteolytic activation of the two zymoxins by in-vitro activity assays. In order to assay translocation capability and NS3 proteolytic activation in-vivo, a model HEK293 cell line inducibly expressing the HCV NS3-protease was established. It was previously reported that sitoxins that are pre-activated in-vitro by the HIV protease have increased ability to inhibit cellular protein synthesis. However, these sitoxins subsequently failed to inhibit the growth of HIV infected cells, and it was suggested by the authors that this failure was due to the fact that the HIV virus-encoded protease is located at the plasma membrane and not available to activate the sitoxins [6] . Hence, zymoxins activation was assayed using both cytosolic and membrane-associated NS3 expressing cells as cellular localization of the protease may influence the probability of interaction with translocated toxins. The latter model of membrane associated NS3 expression system was particularly important since it should more precisely mimic the intracellular localization of the genuine viral-encoded NS3 protease domain.",

The ability of these agents to be activated by a viral protease provides a proof of concept for the feasibility of ''zymogenization'' of natural toxins by rational design relaying on previous knowledge on the toxin's structure, interaction with substrate and existence of peptidic inhibitors. Although practical use may require further research and development in order to broaden the ''therapeutic window'' and reduce potential immunogenicity of these drugs; eradication of virally infected cells by using zymogenized toxins may represent another strategy in fighting viral diseases. Still, the ''zymoxin'' approach may be most appropriate for application to life-threatening acute infections where much higher levels of the activating protease than the ones observed in HCV infected cells would be expected.",

The PCR product was digested with PstI and AatII and was cloned between the corresponding sites in the same plasmid that was used as template, generating the plasmid ''pET28a PE QQ delta -DTA(1-187)(instead domain III)-no cleavage site-15aa linker-HNP-HIS-KDEL ''. Construction of the vector encoding ''PE-DTA-cleavage site-defensin'' zymoxin in which the P6-P49 NS3 cleavage sequence derived from 1b genotype NS5A/B junction was replaced by the P10-P109 cleavage sequence derived from 2a genotype (strain JFH1) NS5A/B junction (''PE-DTA-full 2a JFH1 cleavage site-defensin''). A PCR was carried out using DNA of plasmid ''pET28a PE QQ delta -DTA(1-187)(instead domain III) -NS5AB-15aa linker-HNP-HIS-KDEL'' as template, the reverse primer : 19-DTA2aclv; and the forward primers: 20-DTA2aclv and 21-DTA2aclv . The PCR product was digested with StuI and XhoI and was cloned between the corresponding sites in a plasmid similar to the one used as template, in which the StuI site was introduced silently (without changing the protein sequence) upstream to the 1b derived NS5A/B sequence, generating plasmid ''pET28a PE QQ delta -DTA (1-187) (instead domain III)-full 2a JFH1 NS5AB-15aa linker-HNP-HIS-KDEL''.",
