In total, 7 of the 10 viruses investigated have been detected at least once in respiratory samples. Along with EAdV-2 and ECoV, EIV genome has never been found in NS or TW throughout the study. This latter was not unexpected since all horses were in active training and racing, and thus vaccinated (every 6 months) at the time of sampling. Alternatively, up to 4 different viral genomes have been concomitantly detected in either NS or TW. Previous studies documented concurrent infections between ERBV and either EHV-4 [21] , \u03b3-herpesviruses [21, 22] , or EIV [23] . To our knowledge, the present study is the first to report concomitant genome detection of EAdV-1 along with ERBV, EHV-1 or EHV-4. Among other bacteria, a relatively low prevalence was found for isolation of Streptococcus zooepidemicus in TW, when compared with previous longitudinal studies [10, 11] . However, cut-off values of 10 4 CFU/ml have been used for discriminating negative and positive samples, as described previously [24] . Similarly, identification and quantification have also been performed only on samples with up to 3 different strains. A moderate even significant association between identification of commensals, but not Streptococcus zooepidemicus, was significantly associated with coughing in the present [9] ; the odds of airway inflammation being also significantly increased along with CFU/ml [5, 6, 24] . Genome detection for \u03b3-herpesviruses (EHV-2, EHV-5) was highly prevalent in the present longitudinal study, which is in accordance with previously published data [12, 25] . Despite a moderately lower monthly incidence, both EHV-2 and EHV-5 have been detected on at least one occasion for all 52 horses of the study. Due to their capability of viral latency, it might then be determined that each of these horses was a permanent carrier for both EHV-2 and EHV-5. Previously published data also revealed that multiple strains of EHV-2 might be concomitantly detected in nasal swabs or TW of a single horse [7, 26] . However, no phylogeny has been performed for further characterising the strains detected among time in the present study.",

Based on the growing evidence of its implication in lower airway inflammation; elucidating the underlying EHV-2 pathogenesis warrants further investigation. On the other hand, EHV-5 detection, quantification or viral loads in either NS or TW have not been associated with coughing, nasal discharge nor airway inflammation in this study. Such observation might however not be surprising, since EHV-5 has repeatedly been detected in asymptomatic horses [25, 27] .

The prevalence of ERBV RNA quantification presently found in NS was slightly higher than previous data [12] , which might be partially explained by the differences in sampling methodologies (nasal vs. nasopharyngeal swabs) and qPCR assays. Conversely, the monthly incidence of 'quantifiable' samples for ERBV was comparable to previously reported serological results, based on complement fixation tests [11] . It has however been recently found that detection of ERBV RNA by PCR in nasal swabs might not coincide with seroconversion [14] . Besides, the low prevalence of ERAV RNA detection in NS or TW was somehow unexpected, since being previously associated with acute clinical cases of respiratory diseases [29] . In addition, a high seroprevalence has been previously described worldwide for this virus [30] and vaccination is currently not available in Europe.",

Interestingly, neither agreement nor correlation has been found between paired samples (NS and TW), for genome detection or viral loads of any investigated virus. In terms of subclinical infectious diseases, findings from upper airways (NS) cannot be considered as representative of lower airways (TW) in the same horse. Moreover, viral genome detection in NS seems not to be relevant in the clinical context of IAD, unlike acute infectious airway troubles [22, 29] . It might then be recommended to perform qPCR in TW samples for any virus detection on horses at training, as previously suggested for a limited number of herpesviruses [31] .",

The demonstration of increased antibody titres however requires two consecutive samplings with a 3 to 4-week interval, which is irrelevant on the field for any concomitant diagnosis of IAD. Apart from viruses and bacteria, non-infectious agents are also likely to be relevant to the development of IAD in horses [4] . Another limitation would then be the absence of environmental investigations within the different training yards throughout the study. Ultra-fine particles (< 10 \u03bcm) within the breathing zone of the horse were indeed recently found to be significant riskfactors for excess mucus and increased TW neutrophil proportions [32] .",
