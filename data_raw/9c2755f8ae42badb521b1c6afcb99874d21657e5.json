The classification of biological agents is a basic requirement for both biosafety and biodefense. We compared and analyzed the Biological Agent Laboratory Biosafety Category list and the defining criteria according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the European Union (EU) and China. We also compared and analyzed the Biological Agent Biodefense Category list and the defining criteria according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States, the EU and Russia. The results show some inconsistencies among or between the two types of category lists and criteria. We suggest that the classification of biological agents based on laboratory biosafety should reduce the number of inconsistencies and contradictions. Developing countries should also produce lists of biological agents to direct their development of biodefense capabilities.To develop a suitable biological agent list should also strengthen international collaboration and cooperation.",

The classification of biological agents is a basic requirement for biosafety and the development of biodefense capabilities. Biological agent classification can be based on two measures: laboratory biosafety and biodefense considerations. For laboratory biosafety assessment, the main consideration is the ability of biological agents to cause disease and the risk of exposure in laboratory accidents. For biodefense assessment, the main consideration is the potential for biological agent weaponization, terrorism and the harm associated with deliberate release [1] . Biological agents category lists also have other purposes, such as the Select Agents and Toxins List of the United States [2] and the Australia Group list of human and animal pathogens and toxins for export control [3] . However, their principle use is for biosecurity to avoid bioterrorist obtaining or abusing biological agents.",

            "text": "The study and handling of biological agents carries with it the potential for the infection of laboratory personnel and environmental effects. Some countries and organizations have compiled a biological agent category list according to evaluations of the risk of biological agents based on laboratory biosafety. The WHO publishes the ''Laboratory Biosafety Manual'' [4] . The first edition was published in 1983, second edition in 1993, and the third and latest edition was published in 2004. This manual suggests the criteria for classification of biological agents based on laboratory biosafety, but does not identify the specific category for each biological agent. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the United Stated (US) released ''NIH guidelines for research involving recombinant DNA molecules'' [5] , which divided biological agents into four groups, and published the category lists for each biological agent. Since its first publication in June 1994, NIH Guidelines have undergone numerous amendments. The European Union (EU) divided biological agents into four risk groups and in 2000 published the category lists in Directive No. 2000/54/EC ''on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to biological agents at work'' [6] . In China ''Pathogenic microbiology laboratory biosafety regulations'', which were published by the State Council in 2004 [7] , divided pathogenic microorganisms into four groups, with group 1 defined as the highest risk, in contrast to the WHO, NIH and the EU, which defined group 4 as the highest risk. The Chinese Ministry of Health published the ''List of human transmission of pathogenic microorganisms'' in 2006 [8] , which identified harmful levels of each pathogenic microorganism and the laboratory BSL at which they should be handled.",

Following the terrorist attacks of 9.11 and the anthrax mail event in 2001, the European Commission formed a task force on bioterrorism, which became operational in May 2002. As part of its effort, the Commission was tasked with developing lists of agents for which specific activities should be undertaken to improve preparedness in the EU, as a result two groups of potential bioterrorism biological agents were defined [13, 14] .

Many biological agents have no effective preventive or treatment measures, and even usable vaccines and drugs often have serious side effects. Therefore, the development of more effective and safer prophylactic and therapeutic measures is urgently required. The United States has launched ''Project Bioshield'' and other project to strengthen their biological defense capability [16] , which is mainly based on the CDC biological agent list. The EU and countries in other regions also attach great importance to the development of biological defense capabilities, based on their respective biological agent lists.",

Some countries can refer to the biological agent list of US CDC, but this is not a universal list as it may be suitable for the United States. During the developments of Biological Agent Biodefense Lists, developing countries should evaluate characteristics of each biological agent and threats faced, existing biodefense capabilities based on its specific regional conditions. The CDCs of developing country should play an important role in this process and cooperate with other related departments and organizations.",
