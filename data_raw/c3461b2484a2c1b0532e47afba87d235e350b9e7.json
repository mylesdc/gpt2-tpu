            "text": "Background: The Egyptian Rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), a common fruit bat species found throughout Africa and the Middle East, was recently identified as a natural reservoir host of Marburg virus. With Ebola virus, Marburg virus is a member of the family Filoviridae that causes severe hemorrhagic fever disease in humans and nonhuman primates, but results in little to no pathological consequences in bats. Understanding host-pathogen interactions within reservoir host species and how it differs from hosts that experience severe disease is an important aspect of evaluating viral pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutics and methods of prevention. Results: Progress in studying bat reservoir host responses to virus infection is hampered by the lack of host-specific reagents required for immunological studies. In order to establish a basis for the design of reagents, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the R. aegyptiacus transcriptome. We performed de novo transcriptome assembly using deep RNA sequencing data from 11 distinct tissues from one male and one female bat. We observed high similarity between this transcriptome and those available from other bat species. Gene expression analysis demonstrated clustering of expression profiles by tissue, where we also identified enrichment of tissue-specific gene ontology terms. In addition, we identified and experimentally validated the expression of novel coding transcripts that may be specific to this species. Conclusion: We comprehensively characterized the R. aegyptiacus transcriptome de novo. This transcriptome will be an important resource for understanding bat immunology, physiology, disease pathogenesis, and virus transmission.",

Despite the severe virulence of these viruses in humans, infected bats are often asymptomatic [13, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Nipah virus and Hendra virus interactions with their natural reservoir hosts, Pteropus vampyrus and Pteropus alecto, respectively, are well characterized. Experimental infections of bats with high doses of henipaviruses have shown virus replication and shedding with little to no disease [20] [21] [22] . Remarkably, the only viruses known to have induced any observable pathology in bats are rabies virus and Australian bat lyssavirus [2, 23] . Understanding mechanisms of disease and differential responses to infection in asymptomatic reservoir host species compared to species that exhibit severe pathology will help inform the development of novel therapeutics and disease prevention approaches.",

The majority of human outbreaks due to MARV have been associated with caves inhabited by R. aegyptiacus. Furthermore, epidemiological surveillance of the R. aegyptiacus colony located in the Python cave in Uganda revealed a biannual spike in Marburg virus prevalence. This pattern correlated strongly with spillover transmission events in humans [24] . Initial studies in captive bats evaluated clinical signs, virus dissemination, and virus shedding patterns during experimental infection with a MARV isolate derived from wild bats [13] . Consistent with a natural reservoir host, the bats showed little to no evidence of disease even though the virus disseminated throughout their body and was actively shed [13] . These results were confirmed when bats were infected with MARV Angola, a strain isolated from a lethal human case [18] . In the absence of genetic and transcriptomic information for R. aegyptiacus and with limited available reagents, studying this reservoir host animal model has been challenging.",

Without a common ground for comparison, it was difficult to perform downstream comparative analyses such as differential gene expression analysis; therefore, we combined contigs from all tissues into one unified, nonredundant reference transcriptome (Fig. 1d) . To this end, we iteratively merged the assemblies two at a time, similar to the approach employed in [37] (Fig. 1d) . We obtained 4,746,293 nonredundant contigs. Among the nonredundant contigs, 974,765 (20.54 %) of the sequences were annotated by bat sequences, 860,578 (18.13 %) by primate sequences, and 104,796 (2.2 %) by sequences in nt database (Fig. 2a) . The nonredundant contig set had slightly lower sensitivity, though it still remained high; 86.60 % of M. davidii, 85.95 % of M. brandtii, and 95.30 % of P. alecto transcripts were recovered. The resulting annotated contigs were assigned gene names and combined using the longest annotated ORF as the transcript. This resulted in an annotation for R. aegyptiacus that contained a total of 24,118 genes. To determine the efficiency of using the MSA pipeline, we determined that 84 % (20,207 genes) of the contigs were annotated using the bat database and 16 % (3,911 genes) were subsequently annotated using the primate database. These data show that the MSA pipeline, which utilizes known transcripts from related species only, is a sensitive and efficient method for de novo transcriptome annotation.",

If the transcriptome assembly and annotations were accurate, the expression profiles of a given tissue should cluster with those of the same tissue origin and segregate from those of different origins [36, 38] . A gene can result in more than one transcript isoform; therefore, to capture the highest amount of information, for each gene, we focused on the transcript with the longest open reading frame (ORF) (Fig. 2a) . After normalizing the expression values, we performed Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to determine the relationships between the gene expression patterns in different tissues. As expected, MDS showed a clear separation of the samples according to the tissue of origin (Fig. 3a) and explains 74 % of the variance in the data. To examine the evolutionary relationship among tissues, we performed hierarchical clustering of the gene expression profiles (Fig. 3b ). The brain, which has a different developmental pathway compared to the other organs, was classified as an outgroup. The spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow are all organs of the immune system and, as expected, clustered near each other. The peripheral blood contains some of the same cell types as the immune organs, thus, clustered near these tissues. Lastly, the gonads and kidney, which develop from the intermediate mesoderm, were grouped as neighbors in the tree. These results suggest that our transcriptome captured sufficient heterogeneity of gene expression to distinguish individual tissues while preserving their developmental relationships.",

One important aspect of reservoir host biology is how their immune response compares to that of animal species that experiences severe disease, such as humans. Therefore, we examined the transcriptome for the presence of immune-related genes. We associated the R. aegyptiacus gene set with GO terms based on the human-specific gene ontology annotation. This resulted in 14,781 genes that mapped to 14,817 GO terms. We used CateGOrizer [39] and applied the immune class GOSlim terms to identify immune-related genes from this set. Similar to previous studies in P. alecto and A. jamaicensis, we found that out of 14,817 GO terms, approximately 2.75 % were associated with immune response [32, 33] . Amongst the most represented GO terms were cytokine production, lymphocyte activation, T cell activation, regulation of apoptosis, and regulation of lymphocyte activation (Fig. 5) . We next searched for specific genes related to various aspects of the immune response in other mammals, primarily mice and humans. We first evaluated the annotation of the transcriptome for the presence of anti-viral genes. A multitude of pattern recognition receptors were identified including toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1-9, RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 along with the important scaffold and signaling molecules Myd88 and MAVS. A variety of antiviral molecules were also found, including Mx1 and Mx2, PKR, STING, IRF3, IRF5, IRF7, members of the IFIT and IFITM families, and ISG15. We also looked for the presence of type I, II, and III interferons (IFN). We were able to identify IFNgamma, IFNgamma2, and IFNalpha. Transcripts corresponding to the IFN receptor subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 were also identified. IFNalpha and IFNbeta have been previously characterized by cloning from stimulated cells [40] . We, however, did not find any contigs corresponding to IFNB. To eliminate the possibility of an impaired assembly, we aligned the processed RNA-seq reads to the IFNB sequence from P. alecto [41] (Additional file 2 and Additional file 3). We detected only 2 reads from R. aegyptiacus,which did not provide sufficient coverage to construct the transcript. These data suggest that IFNB expression in healthy tissues of R. aegyptiacus is low, consistent with other mammals in which IFNB is primarily expressed after exposure to a stimulus.",

Genes associated with natural killer (NK) cells, however, were less evident. We were able to identify transcripts of co-receptor gene CD56, but not CD16. Transcripts of genes encoding for molecules in the killer cell lectin-like receptor (KLR) family, including NKG2A and NKG2D, were also not found. In other bat transcriptomes, such as P. alecto and A. jamaicensis, coverage of NK cellrelated genes was more sparse than that of other mammals [32, 33] . A similar observation was made in the genome of M. davidii [30] . The absence of NK cell-related genes in the R. aegyptiacus transcriptome further strengthens the theory that bats might contain a different NK cell receptor repertoire than other species.",

Interestingly, we were able to identify transcripts for the TCR\u03b1 and TCR\u03b2 chains, but were unable to find transcripts for the TCR\u03b4 and TCR\u03b3 chains. The transcriptome annotation for P. alecto included these genes, but they were present at low levels [32] . This supports the notion that \u03b1\u03b2 T cells are the predominant T cell subset in bats. We also looked at genes associated with B cells and were able to find transcripts for CD19, CD20, CD27, as well as transcripts that were similar to The frequency shown is the percent of immune class GO slim terms associated with that particular pathway out of all the GO terms that were identified the immunoglobulin heavy chains A, E, G, and M and the immunoglobulin light chains \u03ba and \u03bb.

To evaluate the possibility of an incomplete or impaired assembly, we grouped the aligned contigs into a total of 1,012,664 clusters based on the presence of overlapping sequences. This reduction suggests that multiple isoform expression patterns between different tissues may have affected our assembly or that our short read assembly may have been incomplete. Nonetheless, the number of unannotated contigs that aligned to the P. alecto genome suggests that these contigs, either coding or noncoding, may be novel transcripts shared within the order Pteropodinae. Future studies evaluating the conservation and possible functions of these sequences are essential to determine the importance of these genetic elements. To validate novel contigs in R. aegyptiacus that appeared to be coding we utilized PCR. Primers were designed to produce amplicons for eight highly expressed, unannotated contigs that contained ORFs longer than 400 bp. Using RNA isolated from the spleen, we were able to produce amplicons of the expected size from at least one bat ( Fig. 6 and Additional file 4). The sequences of these amplicons were found to Fig. 6 Unannotated, novel transcripts from R. aegyptiacus were validated of by RT-PCR. RNA from the spleen of both bats was reverse transcribed to make cDNA. The cDNA was amplified using primers specific for one of 8 novel transcripts that were unannotated in the assembly, but contained a complete ORF larger than 400 nucleotides. The expected product sizes were: transcript 1, 457 bp; transcript 2, 450 bp; transcript 3, 419 bp; transcript 4, 548 bp; transcript 5, 469 bp, transcript 6, 277 bp; transcript 7, 507 bp; and transcript 8, 301 bp match the expected sequence from the assembled ORF of the unannotated contig. These contigs also showed high sequence similarity to the P. alecto genome. In particular, six of the 8 validated transcripts showed sequence similarity higher than 75 % at a query coverage greater than 64 %. The other two validated transcripts had a query coverage of 23 with 78.36 % identity (transcript 1 in Fig. 6 ) and a query coverage of 7 with 91.27 % identity (transcript 2 in Fig. 6 ) (Additional file 5); therefore, we hypothesize that these transcripts might be specific to R. aegyptiacus.

We exported all accession numbers of the bat sequences at NCBI and made a subset database from nt using \"blastdb_aliastool -db nt -dbtype nucl -gilistbats.sequence.gi.txt -title Bats -out Bats\". Using the same type of query, we also created a database for primates including humans due to their extraordinarily well-annotated transcriptomes, which will maximize the power of our annotation pipeline. We then used BLAST to iteratively align the contigs to the bat db, the primate db, and finally nt using a subtractive approach: what did not align to the bat db was aligned to the primate db, and what did not align to the primate db was aligned to nt.",

From the union of all contigs, we generated the nonredundant set of transcripts by iterative pairwise merging of contig set of all tissues; this yielded 68 % reduction of the contig set. a To generate Canonical Coding Transcript Set, we selected the contigs that are annotated with MSA pipeline. The annotated contigs are further filtered for contigs that have a gene symbol. For an individual gene cluster, we chose a transcript with the longest ORF to represent the corresponding gene (Canonical Coding Transcript Set). b For unannoated contigs, we selected for expression level, presence of an ORF with both start and stop codons in the CDS, and a minimum length of 400 nucleotides. We identified 8 high-confidence novel coding transcript candidates for validation",

The first two coordinates explained 73.9 % of the variance in the data. b We performed hierarchical clustering of expression profiles using 1-spearman correlation as distance. The clustering suggested presence of three groups that correspond to separate developmental origins. Tissues used are Bone (BM), Brain (BR), Heart (HT), Kidney (KY), Liver (LV), Lung (LG), Lymph (LN), Ovary (OV), PBMC (PB), Spleen (SP), Testes (TT) of the male (M) and female (F) bat",
