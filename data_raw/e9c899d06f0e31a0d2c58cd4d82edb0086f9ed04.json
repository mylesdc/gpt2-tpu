The virus that causes FIP (FIPV) is believed to occur sporadically and spread infrequently from cat to cat. Recently, an FIP outbreak from an animal shelter was confirmed in Taiwan. FCoV from all the cats in this shelter were analyzed to determine the epidemiology of this outbreak. Thirteen of 46 (28.2%) cats with typical signs of FIP were identified. Among them, seven cats were confirmed by necropsy and/or histopathological examinations. Despite the fact that more than one FCoV was identified in this multi-cat environment, the eight FIP cats were invariably found to be infected with a type II FCoV. Sequence analysis revealed that the type II FIPV detected from fecal samples, body effusions and granulomatous tissue homogenates from the cats that succumbed to FIP all harbored an identical recombination site in their S gene. Two of the cats that succumbed to FIP were found to harbor an identical nonsense mutation in the 3c gene. Fecal shedding of this type II virus in the effusive form of FIP can be detected up to six days before death. Taken together, our data demonstrate that horizontal transmission of FIPV is possible and that FIP cats can pose a potential risk to other cats living in the same environment.",

They exist in two serotypes, I and II [3] . Type I FCoV is predominant in the field, whereas type II virus represents only 2-30% of infection [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Accumulating genetic evidence indicates that type II FCoV have arisen by two homologous recombinations between type I FCoV and canine CoV (CCoV) [9, 10] . Both serotypes can mutate in the host to acquire macrophage tropism and cause a systemic disease known as feline infectious peritonitis [2, 11, 12] . Due to a lack of virus-shedding in studies of FIP cats, the mutant FIP viruses (FIP causing FCoV, FIPV) are presumably contained only within the diseased tissues and not transmitted by cat-to-cat contact under natural circumstances [2, 11, 13, 14] .",

After entering, these kittens played together and lived with the resident adult cats. Before the outbreak, the kittens were taken individually to a veterinarian for vaccinations and attended adoption activities. Fever was first observed in four of the kittens (cat 1, 3, 4, 5) within a period of a few days (from August 15 th to 18 th ) ( Table 1) . Clinical signs, e.g., fever, anorexia, neurological signs, panting and/or abdominal extension were observed for the following two months and the kittens died sequentially between September 1 st and October 22 nd ( Table 1 ). The caregivers at the shelter requested our help on September 27 th . All of the resident cats in the shelter were immediately screened for FCoV using RT-nPCR. All FCoV positive cats were isolated individually and kept separated. Nevertheless, starting in September, some of the adult cats with FIP (cats 7-13) showed clinical signs similar to those of the kittens and all of them died later. Six kittens (cats 1-6) with body effusions and/or neurological signs succumbed within the first two months without necropsy confirmation (Table 1) . Cat 1 was once presented to our teaching hospital, and ascites was taken from the cat. In cats 7-13, typical necropsy features, characterized by ascites and/or pleural effusions in the body cavities (effusive FIP) and granulomatous lesions in several organs, especially the kidney, liver, lung, omentum and eyes (non-effusive FIP), were found. Cats 9, 11 and 12 manifested mixed forms of the disease at necropsy (Table 1) .",

The current belief is that cats that succumb to FIP do not shed and transmit the FIPV to other cats [11, 13, 14, [18] [19] [20] . Our data indicate that this outbreak of FIP was caused by viruses from the same origin. First, all of the FIP losses involved a type II FIPV infection, and the recombination event of these seven type II viruses was mapped to the same site. The recombination sites of the type II viruses currently available in GenBank, i.e., FIPV 79-1146, FCoV 79-1683 and FCoV NTU156, were all unique and occurred independently [9, 10] . Second, the FIPV identified in the three kittens that died within the first two months after the onset of fever harbored an intact 3c gene, whereas the viruses from the cats that survived longer (died four to eight months later) all bore a nonsense mutation, i.e., G210* (cat 9 and 12), E47* (cats 11) and Q218* (cat 13). Because the three nonsense mutations detected in the FIPV from these animals were all located at different sites, the viruses that originally infected these cats should all harbor an intact 3c gene -like the virus recovered from the kittens that succumbed earlier. After infection, point mutations arose during the replication of the virus in the individual cats, giving rise to FIPV with a 3c gene bearing nonsense mutations at different locations. The finding that the viruses that were identified not only in the tissues but also in the fecal samples of two cats (cat 9 and 12) harbored an identical mutation in the 3c gene further confirmed that horizontal transmission had occurred (Table 3) . Taken together, all these findings demonstrated that a highly virulent FIPV had spread from animal to animal in a horizontal manner. This is the first report of a type II FIPV outbreak with evidence of horizontal transmission of a diseaseassociated FCoV. The outbreak of FIP started after introducing five kittens (cat 1, 3, 4, 8 and 10) into this shelter between June and July of 2011. Because the causative type II viruses with the distinct genetic marker in the S gene were confirmed to be a recombinant of feline and canine coronaviruses and some of the kittens that died earlier were found to have been living closely with dogs between being rescued and entering the shelter, any of these kittens could have been the source of this type II virus. Dogs, and especially young dogs, in shelters often shed large amounts of canine coronavirus in their feces and recombination between cat and dog and dog and pig coronaviruses has been well documented [21] [22] [23] . Additionally, these causative type II viruses Effusions  II  II  II   11  Feces  ---II  II   NOC swabs  --I I   Viremia  -----Effusions  +  II   12  Feces  -+  ----------+  I I  I I   NOC swabs  ----------I I  I I   Viremia  ---------II were detected in many excretions and secretions of cats dying of FIP (Table 3) , thus providing a vehicle for catto-cat spreading. Although directly following the first FCoV screening of all the animals in this shelter, cats shedding FCoV were caged separately, and transmission subsequently ceased, the mortality rate for this outbreak was high (28%, 13/46). Three studies regarding outbreak of FIP have been reported previously. In a four-year study conducted in a closed breeding cattery, the average mortality was 17.3% [24] , and in a 10-year study of a closed breeding colony, the mortality was 29.4% (5/17) [25] . Another epidemic study conducted in seven catteries/shelters revealed a > 10% mortality rate [20] . The high incidence of FIP in those closed breeding colonies might be influenced by the genetically predisposed breeding stock. In our study, only several FIP cats in this shelter were siblings, and the others were genetically unrelated. Our study demonstrates that without the influence of genetic predisposing factors, the mortality of FIP can still be high in a closed multi-cat environment as long as the spread of the disease-associated FCoV remains undetected.",

Type I FCoV were found only in the fecal samples, whereas type II FCoV were found in the diseased-associated samples, including body effusion, granulomatous tissue homogenates and cerebrospinal fluid. This finding indicates that in these dually infected animals, type II FCoV was the main cause of FIP. This finding is consistent with our previous finding that infection with type II FCoV appears to be significantly correlated with FIP [4] .",

Shedding of this type II virus through fecal and nasal/oral/conjunctival routes can be detected in effusive form FIP up to six days before death. Another experimental infection study showed that inoculated viruses could only be recovered for approximately two weeks after inoculation, before clinical signs of disease develop [14] . Taken together, the transmission of FIPV might occur at the onset, before disease manifestation and at the terminal stage. In this outbreak, all the cats were housed together in an open room at the very beginning. After seven cats succumbed sequentially, all FCoV-positive cats were caged individually, and kept separated. The isolation eventually terminated the transmission of the disease. This outbreak, which killed 13 cats, allowed us to determine clearly that FIPV could be transmitted horizontally and showed that isolation of diseased cats should be taken into consideration in a multi-cat environment.",
