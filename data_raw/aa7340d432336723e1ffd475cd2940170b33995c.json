For example, recent studies have estimated the worldwide incidence of diarrhoeal diseases in children <5 years of age [3] , and in older children and adults [4] , but did not provide aetiology-specific estimates. Lanata et al. [5] and Fisher Walker et al. [6] provided aetiology-specific estimates, but only for diarrhoeal deaths among children <5 years of age, and diarrhoeal cases in persons 5 years of age, respectively. Another large-scale study estimated diarrhoeal aetiologies in children <5 years of age in specific study sites, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [7] . Other studies have estimated the incidence of specific foodborne diseases, many of which cause diarrhoea, but each focused on a single developed country [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

Although some countries have published national incidence and mortality estimates for diseases caused by most of these nine pathogens, such estimates of foodborne diseases, which are considered to be the highest quality burden estimates for these diseases [17] , are only available from a limited number of countries. We therefore used two approaches to estimate the incidence and mortality of the diseases caused by the nine selected diarrhoeal pathogens, and applied one or the other approach in each country in the six regions. Approach 1 was applied to all countries in the European Region (EURO) and all other countries with overall low mortality as defined by WHO (http://www.who.int/choice/demography/mortality_strata/en/); approach 2 was applied to all remaining countries. Using these two approaches allowed us to utilize the highest quality available data in countries with overall low mortality which have similar sanitary and public health infrastructure and presumed incidence of foodborne diseases. The final results of the two approaches were merged in a last step to determine global estimates and estimates for the 6 regions.",

We conducted a literature review and consulted with the International Collaboration of Foodborne Disease Burden of Illness Studies (http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dfwed/international/enteric-burden-collaboration.html) to identify all published national estimates (with associated uncertainty intervals) of foodborne diseases. Such estimates were derived through studies that corrected national surveillance data to account for under-diagnosis and underreporting [8] . In cases where national estimates were expressed as number of cases and deaths, and not as incidence and mortality rates (per 100,000 population), we used United Nations population figures for the national study year to create such rates. If a national estimate only included domestically-acquired infections, we used the proportion of infections acquired during international travel in a neighbouring country to derive revised estimates that included infections acquired abroad. We applied the national incidence and mortality estimates, with the associated uncertainty intervals, to each country with such national estimates, and the median incidence and mortality of all studies, with uncertainty intervals associated with those median estimates, to each country in EURO, AMRO sub-region A, and WPRO sub-region A that did not have national incidence or mortality estimates. This approach resulted in incidence and mortality estimates (per 100,000 population), with uncertainty intervals, for each of the 61 countries for each of the nine diseases. Overall estimates were partitioned to the age groups <5 years of age and 5 years of age on the basis of the age distribution of the population in each region. Further details of this approach are available in S1 Appendix.",

Our next step was to estimate the proportion of diarrhoeal illnesses and deaths due to the nine pathogens by extracting the aetiological proportions of diarrhoeal cases and deaths for each pathogen by region from systematic reviews of studies reporting stool sample isolation and detection from inpatient, outpatient, and communitybased studies of persons with diarrhoea. We assumed that the distribution of pathogens observed among outpatient and community studies represented the pathogen prevalence among diarrhoeal cases, and that the distribution of pathogens among inpatients hospitalized for severe diarrhoea represented the pathogen prevalence among diarrhoeal deaths for all age groups. Due to data scarcity, we also included inpatient studies to estimate the aetiological proportions of diarrhoeal cases in persons 5 years of age (i.e. all available studies).

The norovirus-specific review was conducted because of the increased recent use of molecular diagnostics globally and as part of a parallel effort to estimate the global burden of norovirus disease [17] . For all other pathogens we included two previously published systematic reviews: 1) the aetiology of diarrhoeal disease studies for children 5 years of age published between 1980 and 2008 [3] and 2) the aetiology among children <5 years of age published between 1990 and 2011 [5] . We updated each of these reviews to include studies published through 2012. S2 Appendix details the systematic review methodologies and results of the updated reviews, including search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Studies focusing only on norovirus collected in the general reviews were excluded to avoid duplicates with the norovirus-specific review. The general systematic reviews collected data on isolation or detection of the nine pathogens included in our study and on pathogens not commonly transmitted by food (e.g. rotavirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, and coronavirus); the latter were grouped together as \"other pathogens\".",

For example, if 10 studies conducted in the Western Pacific region (WPRO) provided data on the number of Salmonella isolates among diarrhoeal cases, this region's Salmonella-proportion was estimated as the median of the estimated 10 study-specific aetiology proportions. Since several of the studies among children <5 years of age used narrower age ranges, in analyses a and b we calculated an age-adjusted proportion for this age group by calculating a conversion factor as the ratio of the median proportion in the age group 0-59 months to the median proportion in age group X ((median (prev0-59)/median (prevX)). We applied this approach when three or more studies for each pathogen contributed to each of the two medians. If this condition was not met, we borrowed the conversion factor for the age group from a similar age group within the same pathogen (for example, used the conversion factor calculated for studies including infants 0-11 months of age for studies that included infants 0-5 months of age). For persons 5 years of age, we have assumed that differences between narrower age categories would be diluted in this very broad population group and have chosen not to age-adjust medians.

Of these agents, we showed that norovirus was responsible for the largest number of cases followed by ETEC, G. lamblia and Shigella spp. Norovirus caused the most deaths among these nine pathogens, followed by EPEC and Shigella spp. Nearly 40% of all cases and 43% of deaths caused by these nine pathogens occurred in children <5 years of age, who represent only 8% of the global population. We also demonstrated regional differences in both the incidence and mortality of diseases caused by these nine pathogens. These differences are important to consider when defining interventions to reduce the burden of diseases commonly transmitted through foods. As an example, Campylobacter and Salmonella, which are pathogens that have mainly domestic food-producing animals as reservoirs and usually infect humans due to contamination in the food production chain, play a major role in the incidence of foodborne enteric disease in the EURO region but are less frequently observed in WHO-defined high mortality countries. In high mortality countries where poor sanitary conditions and food and water contamination are more important, pathogens such as G. lamblia and ETEC play more important roles. The predominance and relative ubiquity of norovirus across all regions suggests that targeted interventions, such as vaccines, may be necessary to reduce the burden of this human reservoir pathogen.",

It is important to recognize that the estimates we present include disease from all modes of transmission, including contaminated food, water, and environments, along with infected persons and animals. Our inclusion of only pathogens that are commonly transmitted through food also meant that we did not present estimates for important diarrhoeal agents, such as rotavirus. By including them into other pathogens, we have assured that we did not overestimate the incidence and mortality of remaining pathogens when distributing the diarrhoeal total cases and deaths to the nine diseases of interest. We used two approaches to estimate the relative contribution of different aetiologies for disease because the quality and availability of data varied substantially between countries and regions. National incidence and mortality estimates were available only from seven low mortality countries, but given the high quality of these estimates, we gave priority to these data by using them as the basis for estimating the incidence and mortality of the diseases caused by the nine pathogens for all EURO and other low mortality countries (sub-region A in AMRO and WPRO). For all other countries, we adapted the CHERG approach for estimating the burden of diarrhoeal diseases in these countries [5] . This approach was facilitated by the availability of estimates of the envelope of diarrhoeal deaths, along with recent advances in diarrhoeal disease diagnosis, such as widespread application of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for norovirus detection. We have divided countries for the two approaches on the basis of their overall mortality status, as defined by WHO, which we assume can be used as a proxy for differences in the public health status of the countries. The two approaches differed in terms of methodology, assumptions and type of data used. While approach 1 analysed national incidence and mortality of disease by pathogens commonly transmitted through foods estimated primarily by correcting surveillance data to account for underreporting and under-diagnosis, approach 2 relied on systematic reviews of studies identifying causative agents in patients with diarrhoea. Applying approach 2 for all regions was not possible due to the scarcity of community, inpatient and outpatient studies from low mortality countries for most pathogens. Because of these differences, we acknowledge that comparisons between regions should be made with care.",

Due to scarcity of data, some regional aetiological proportion estimates were informed by a single study. To avoid that studies with potentially over or underestimated aetiology-proportion estimates misrepresented the estimate for that region, we have defined criteria to identify outliers, and have excluded these estimates from the results. These overestimations or underestimations can have various causes, such as study locations with a particularly high or low prevalence of that pathogen, a small sample size, or a country not representative of the whole region. Excluded outliers were treated as missing values, and the aetiology-global median used to represent the regional estimate. In this approach, we also assumed that the distribution of pathogens among inpatients hospitalised with severe diarrhoea represented the relative importance of these pathogens for diarrhoeal deaths. This meant that we used severity of disease as a proxy for mortality, which may lead to an over-or under-estimation of the number of deaths caused by some pathogens. In the analyses for persons over five years of age, due to sparseness of data we decided to use data from inpatient studies to estimate aetiology-proportion of cases, which may also have led to an erroneous estimation of the contribution of pathogens to diarrhoeal incidence. Additionally, this approach relied on stool samples, but some patients that tested positive for a pathogen may have had asymptomatic infections. This is more likely to happen for pathogens that have long excretion periods after illness (e.g. norovirus). Carefully conducted longitudinal studies would be needed to distinguish clinical cases from asymptomatic infections [5] .",

In the EURO region, we made an extra extrapolation and assumed that all countries were similar to sub-region A countries in terms of foodborne diseases' incidence and mortality.

This study was fundamentally different from ours: among other differences, it calculated attributable cases of diarrhoea to each aetiology, comparing patients (moderate to severe diarrhoeal cases seen in health facilities) and controls (un-matched healthy children in a community sample). The GEMS study excluded mild diarrhoeal cases, which along with their moderate diarrhoeal cases would constitute our non-fatal incident cases. By including moderate and severe cases instead of only severe hospitalized cases, the GEMS study does not have a good proxy for fatal cases as we defined it. Still, the study's findings are generally consistent with ours; EPEC, ETEC, Shigella spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. were among the most important causes of diarrhoea. One important difference was on the relative contribution of norovirus for diarrhoea incidence and mortality: our results suggest that norovirus is amongst the most important causes of diarrhoeal cases and deaths, whereas the GEMS study estimated a lower contribution of this pathogen. This discrepancy may indicate that our approach may lead to an overestimation of the proportion of diarrhoea attributable to norovirus or other pathogens that are likely to be carried asymptomatically after the first exposure (like certain types of ETEC, e.g. LT-ETEC) because it does not account for the potential detection of norovirus in the stool of healthy individuals [17] . However, the GEMS study required that control individuals did not have a diarrhoeal episode in the 7 days prior to sampling; because norovirus patients can excrete the virus for 3 to 4 weeks after infection, it is likely that some controls included in this study corresponded to asymptomatic carriers of norovirus [5] . These findings may suggest limitations in ascribing pathogenicity based on case-control studies, particularly in developing country settings in which frequent exposures and a high degree of transmission results in common reinfections [19] . A recent community based prospective cohort study (the \"Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development Project\", the MAL-ED study), supported our results and estimated that norovirus was the most important cause of diarrhoea in young children [20] .",
