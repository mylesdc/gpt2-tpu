We aimed to explore the influence of demographic factors, clinical manifestations and underlying comorbidities on mortality in MERS-CoV patients. Retrospective chart reviews were performed to identify all laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-COV infection in Saudi Arabia that were reported to the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia between 23 April 2014 and 7 June 2016. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess the effect of sex, age, clinical presentation and comorbidities on mortality from MERS-CoV. A total of 281 confirmed MERS-CoV cases were identified: 167 (59.4%) patients were male and 55 (20%) died. Mortality predominantly occurred among Saudi nationals and older patients and was significantly associated with respiratory failure and shortness of breath. Of the 281 confirmed cases, 160 (56.9%) involved comorbidities, wherein diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease and chronic kidney disease were significantly associated with mortality from MERS-CoV and two or three comorbidities significantly affected the fatality rates from MERS-CoV. The findings of this study show that old age and the existence of underlying comorbidities significantly increase mortality from MERS-CoV.",

Most reported cases were from countries in the Middle East, among which 82% occurred in Saudi Arabia; other cases were reported from North Africa, Europe, the USA and East Asia, with the latter cases involving individuals who had travelled to the Middle East [3] . Owing to the high mortality rate and the lack of antiviral treatment or a preventative vaccine, MERS-CoV remains a major public health concern.",

The case fatality rate of MERS-CoV ranges from 30% to 60% [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , in which severe disease presentation is correlated with preexisting medical conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, renal failure, obesity and immunodeficiency [13, 18] . Thus, the present paper aims to investigate the effect of comorbidities on the mortality rate of confirmed MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia.",

Mortality was higher in male patients, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.45:1. The predominance of male cases is consistent with the findings reported in previous studies in Saudi Arabia and South Korea [19, 20] , which may be associated with cultural or occupational behaviours in males that increase the risk of infection. Saudi citizens showed significantly higher mortality than non-Saudi citizens. The demographic features of the laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-COV infection in the current study showed that only nine patients were aged <20 years; 73.2% were aged 21-60 years and 23.5% were aged >61 years. These findings are in agreement with those of previous studies reported in Saudi Arabia [14, [21] [22] [23] . In addition, the higher mortality rate among elderly patients (>61 years) is consistent with the rate reported in a previous study [24] . A possible explanation for this may be age-associated immunosenescence, which results in a suboptimal immune response in these individuals following exposure to MERS-CoV [25] and the possible interference of underlying comorbidities in elderly patients cannot be ruled out. The clinical presentations of MERS-CoV cases observed in this study have similar symptomatology and frequency to those previously reported [10, 13, 18] . Remarkably, among the noted symptoms, SOB and respiratory failure were significantly associated with higher mortality. In this study, chronic conditions such as DM, HTN, IHD, CHF and renal disease significantly influenced the severity of MERS-CoV. The observed increase in the mortality rate in MERS-CoV patients with underlying chronic conditions corroborates the findings of earlier studies in Saudi Arabia [13, 18] . This is also in line with the findings for other respiratory diseases such as influenza [26] , influenza A H1N1 [27, 28] and SARS [29] . A recent study found that obesity, cardiovascular, hypertension and neuromuscular disease were strongly associated with severe pandemic influenza [26] . In SARS, comorbidities such as immunological, neurological, metabolic and dermatologic diseases were strongly associated with the disease [29] . These conditions are known to weaken the host's innate and humoral immune systems, thereby limiting their ability to counteract any new infection [30] . The present study has some limitations. First, although all confirmed MERS-CoV cases were notified to the Saudi Ministry of Health from different regions and hospitals in Saudi Arabia. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that some cases have gone undetected. Second, comorbidity data for admissions without MERS-CoV infection were unavailable.",
