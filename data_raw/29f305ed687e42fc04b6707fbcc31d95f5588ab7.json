It can be a complete and timely source for estimating the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), a key indicator of disease transmissibility. Method: In this study, we developed a likelihood-based method using arrival times of infected cases in different countries to estimate R 0 for influenza pandemics. A simulation was conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method. We further applied the method to the outbreak of the influenza pandemic A/H1N1 in Mexico. Results: In the numerical application, the estimated R 0 was equal to 1.69 with a 95% confidence interval (1.65, 1.73). For the simulation results, the estimations were robust to the decline of travel rate and other parameter assumptions. Nevertheless, the estimates were moderately sensitive to the assumption of infectious duration. Generally, the findings were in line with other relevant studies. Conclusions: Our approach as well as the estimate is potential to assist officials in planning control and prevention measures. Improved coordination to streamline or even centralize surveillance of imported cases among countries will thus be beneficial to public health.",

The basic reproduction number (R 0 ), defined as the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical infectious individual in a whole susceptible population, is a common measure of disease transmissibility. Valid and reliable estimate of the R 0 can assist officials in planning control and prevention measures for an influenza pandemic. On the contrary, underestimation of the disease transmissibility will induce an insufficient public awareness on the risk of infection and therefore lower the general public's incentive to protect themselves against infectious diseases through vaccines, hand washing or other protective measures.",

[5] showed that these types of methods are not sensitive on R 0 estimation given an acceptable goodness of fit. Nevertheless, one of the caveats of using ILI surveillance data is the underreporting although several approaches were developed to adjust this problem [6] .",

During the initial outbreak of a new influenza pandemic, control measures will be initiated at the border points of entry by various concerned countries. On preventing infected persons from seeding local epidemics, local governments may identify the symptomatic passengers by implementing thermal screening, monitor the suspected cases having a travel history to the originating country and even take quarantine measures [11] . Some travel information such as arrival times of infected cases seeded by the originating country is a combination of the epidemic size and the transport network between the originating country and other at-risk countries. By adapting this information, the transmissibility of an originating country during the initial phase of a pandemic can be back-calculated in order to reduce errors from the underestimation of routine surveillance data [9, 12, 13] . The data about importation events is usually timelier than other available data sources such as seroprevalence data. In the H1N1 pandemic, empirical evidence showed that the flow of airline passenger from Mexico had a significant correlation to the detection of exported cases [14] . Because of intense screening for ILI travelers returning from Mexico, ascertainment of early cases in at-risk countries was timelier and complete compared with routine surveillance in Mexico. Hence, it is believed that the data type is able to provide a reliable estimate on disease transmissibility.",

We also conducted a simulation to assess the performance of proposed method. The method was applied to the initial outbreak of influenza pH1N1 in Mexico. We showed that the estimatedR 0 was equal to 1.69 with a 95% CI (1.65, 1.73) . The estimatedR 0 and the corresponding range of sensitivity were consistent to other findings of pH1N1, mentioned in the review of R 0 from Bo\u00eblle et al., the R 0 s of the 2009 pH1N1 were in range from 1.2 to 2.3 [16] . Compared with other similar studies, Fraser et al. developed a Bayesian method to draw a posterior distribution of R 0 for the pH1N1 in Mexico by assuming that tourists infected at a rate proportional to the density of tourists per local resident [12] . The approach adopted the number of infected travelers within a fixed period rather than using the times of exporting infections to countries. Although their estimate (posterior median R 0 = 1.4) was similar to us, time to event data combining the mobility and pattern of epidemic invasion is usually preferred to the count data. Balcan et al. used a MLE approach to fit the arrival time data to the simulated epidemics through a highly parameterized meta-population model in which the R 0 was their parameter of interest [12] . Their estimate ( R 0 \u00bc 1:75 ) was also closer to our finding. Although their transmission model required many details for parameterization and was computational intensive, it provides an estimate closer to the biological realism over a large population. Nevertheless, we believe our method provides a comparatively simpler way for the transmissibility estimation.",

Moreover, no adjustment for disease transmissions on aircrafts was incorporated in the estimation. Nevertheless, a retrospective cohort study indicated in-flight transmissions were unlikely [33] . As with many other approaches, we assumed homogeneous mixings at a country level and same risks of infections between travelers and the domestic population. In the early stage of a pandemic, stochastic effects usually induce spatial variations [9] . Apart from that, since airports are the main hubs of connection between countries, passengers will be more likely to be infected in the areas near the airport than areas far from the airports especially for an infectious disease with a short generation interval. Some cases would even recover before their travels. Further developments can take these issues into a consideration.",
