            "text": "The envelope (E) protein from coronaviruses is a small polypeptide that contains at least one a-helical transmembrane domain. Absence, or inactivation, of E protein results in attenuated viruses, due to alterations in either virion morphology or tropism. Apart from its morphogenetic properties, protein E has been reported to have membrane permeabilizing activity. Further, the drug hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not amiloride, inhibited in vitro ion channel activity of some synthetic coronavirus E proteins, and also viral replication. We have previously shown for the coronavirus species responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) that the transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) forms pentameric a-helical bundles that are likely responsible for the observed channel activity. Herein, using solution NMR in dodecylphosphatidylcholine micelles and energy minimization, we have obtained a model of this channel which features regular a-helices that form a pentameric left-handed parallel bundle. The drug HMA was found to bind inside the lumen of the channel, at both the C-terminal and the N-terminal openings, and, in contrast to amiloride, induced additional chemical shifts in ETM. Full length SARS-CoV E displayed channel activity when transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells in a whole-cell patch clamp set-up. This activity was significantly reduced by hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not by amiloride. The channel structure presented herein provides a possible rationale for inhibition, and a platform for future structure-based drug design of this potential pharmacological target.",

In SARS-CoV E the transmembrane domain spans ,25 residues [21] , approximately from residue 10 to 35 . Coronavirus E proteins are incorporated into the virion lipidic envelope, along with the spike protein (S) and the membrane protein (M). While the S protein is involved in fusion with host membranes during entry into cells, and the M protein is important in envelope formation and budding, E protein is not essential for in vitro and in vivo coronavirus replication. However, its absence results in an attenuated virus, as shown for SARS-CoV [22] . Recently, using a transgenic mouse model expressing the SARS-CoV receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE-2), SARS coronavirus lacking gene E was shown to be attenuated and, in contrast to the wild type virus, did not grow in the central nervous system [23] . In other coronaviruses, E protein affects viral morphogenesis, i.e., virus-like particle (VLP) formation and release [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Indeed, mutations in the extramembrane domain of E protein impaired viral assembly and maturation in MHV [30] . In TGEV, the absence of E protein resulted in a blockade of virus trafficking in the secretory pathway and prevention of virus maturation [31, 32] .",

The observed paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) of the six isotopically labeled residues in ETM ( Fig. 3A) was compared with the PRE calculated from our model according to Protocol S1 (and see Fig. S3 ). The good fit between observed and expected values validates the proposed orientation of the ETM helices in the a-helical bundle. This orientation was further confirmed by the observed broadening of the NOESY crosspeaks from aromatic side-chains of F20, F23 and F26 to aliphatic protons of DPC after addition of 3 mM 16-DSA (not shown). Cross-peaks from ETM N-and C-terminal residues, E8-T11 and T35-R38, remained unaffected, indicating that these residues are exposed to the aqueous environment.

In 2003, however, an animal coronavirus was able to infect humans and produced severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), causing a near pandemic. Such events are likely to reoccur in the future, and new antiviral strategies are necessary. A small coronavirus protein called 'envelope' is important for pathogenesis, affecting the formation of the viral envelope and the distribution of the virus in the body. In vitro studies have shown that synthetic coronavirus envelope proteins have channel activity that in some cases has been inhibited by the drug hexamethylene amiloride, but not by amiloride. In the present paper, we have characterized the structure responsible for this channel activity. We have also determined the binding site of the drug hexamethylene amiloride in the channel, and shown that amiloride has only a mild effect on the NMR signals from the protein. The validity of these results is supported using mammalian cells expressing full length SARS-CoV E, where channel activity was inhibited by hexamethylene amiloride, but only mildly by amiloride. The structural model described for this channel provides a valuable insight into coronavirus envelope protein ion channel activity, and could serve as a platform for the development of novel antiviral drugs.",

A 4% gel was subjected to axial compression (its lower density allows the application of greater compressive forces) while an 8% gel was subjected to radial compression using a gel press assembly. In both RDC measurements, a sinusoidal wave of residue periodicity of ,3.6 could be observed from residues 19 to 25, consistent with a-helical periodicity. The RDC of residue L18 could not be fit to this periodicity, due to either deviation from ideal a-helical geometry or to conformational dynamics. The RDCs were used to determine the alignment tensors of the helix, where one of the tensors coincided with the axis of symmetry of the helical bundle, consistent with the helix forming part of an oligomeric complex, as shown previously by other techniques [38] . Thus, to summarize, the present pentameric a-helical bundle model was built using (i) NOE constraints, (ii) paramagnetic relaxation data, (iii) the obtained alignment tensor/axis of symmetry from RDCs, and (iv) the known oligomeric size of the ETM a-helical bundle.",

We interpret the low periodicity in the central part of the a-helix as due to a tighter packing of the oligomer, i.e., lumenally oriented ETM residues are expected to experience a less hydrophilic environment in this region than in the less compact ends of ETM, leading to a more uniform hydrophobicity around the helix.",

Therefore, we tested the effects of both drugs on the ETM channel. When ETM in DPC micelles was exposed to HMA, changes in 1 H N chemical shift were observed throughout the peptide, with most affected ETM amide protons clustering at both ends of ETM, L19 exhibiting the largest chemical shift (Fig. 5A ). The NOEs observed between HMA and ETM ( Fig. S5) suggest the presence of two binding sites, one near R38 and another near N15. This figure also shows that a protonated form of HMA at nitrogen-5 is bound to the channel. This form may be stabilized by hydrogen bonding to the side-chain carbonyl of N15 and the guanidinium moiety of R38, resulting in an observable 1 H N5 signal at 10.7 ppm (Table S3 ). In the absence of ETM, this HMA resonance was only observed when the pH was lower than 3.5, indicating a possible role of ETM in the stabilization of this HMA protonated state.",

We note that DPC micelles and HMA exhibited identical diffusion rates, indicating that HMA partitions into the detergent phase. The shifts in the [ 1 H, 15 N]-HSQC spectrum after addition of HMA are apparent (Fig. S6 , AC). Amiloride, in contrast, did not produce significant chemical shift changes (Fig. S6 , BD), even at an ETM:drug molar ratio ten times higher than for HMA (not shown). For comparison, addition of AMT at ten times more concentration than HMA also produced similar chemical shifts as those observed for HMA (not shown).

Broadening was also reduced by addition of HMA at 30uC (Fig. S6, G) , suggesting stabilization of one of the ETM exchanging conformers by bound HMA.

Transfected cells produced significantly higher channel activity than the controls (Fig. 7A) . The whole-cell patch clamp recording (Fig. 7B ) reveal moderate inward (negative current) and large outward (positive current) conductance. The same figure shows significantly smaller 'control' currents obtained with cells transfected with the vector alone, or non-transfected HEK-293 cells. ACSF (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) was used as bath solution, which contained a high concentration of NaCl (124 mM), whereas the internal solution contained a high concentration of potassium ion (145 mM), close to the intracellular medium under physiological conditions. Under our recording conditions, the estimated equilibrium potentials, E Na and E k , were 65 mV and 287 mV, respectively. Strong selectivity for either of these cations would produce a reversal potential (i.e., zero current) near their corresponding equilibrium potential. If the channel was poorly selective, the reversal potential would have a value somewhere in between E Na and E k , whereas no selectivity would produce a reversal potential in the mid point between these values (,210 mV). The observed value of reversal potential at ,0 mV (Fig. 7B) indicates low selectivity between sodium and potassium, with perhaps a mild preference for sodium. This is consistent with previous results performed in planar lipid bilayers with synthetic E proteins [35, 36] .",

However, to facilitate resonance assignment and to unequivocally identify inter-monomer NOEs, six labeled amino acids were chemically incorporated near the center of the ETM a-helix. Selection of appropriate specific labels is facilitated by prediction of likely intermonomer interactions using other lower resolution biophysical techniques. In particular, the model reconstructed here with NMR data is consistent with a model that was derived from the analysis of evolutionary conservation of ETM in coronavirus envelope proteins [40] . The latter approach is data independent, and only relies on the reasonable assumption that all homologues share the same backbone structure [42] . Because by definition conservative mutations that appear during evolution should not destabilize the correct model of transmembrane interaction, but may destabilize incorrect low energy models that appear during the simulations along with the correct model, these mutations act effectively as an in silico filter [43] . The inter-helical orientation obtained for the ETM a-helices, and their orientation respect to the lumen of the ETM channel and detergent phase, is also in agreement with previous ETM helix rotational orientation measurements obtained by infrared linear dichroism [38] .",

The 1 H-15 N dipolar couplings from the six labeled backbone amides exhibited a periodicity of 3.6, consistent with a canonical a-helical periodicity, except for L18 which was found to be an outlier, i.e., its 1 H-15 N vector points in a direction not consistent with the other labeled residues. Additionally, the amide groups of L18 and L19 showed significant line broadening, which was reduced at more elevated temperature likely due to acceleration of the exchange rates. We interpret this as a conformational exchange-induced transverse relaxation at these residues, and we speculate that these conformational dynamics may be required for the channel's function.

In the present work, we observed a very mild preference for sodium over potassium. According to these data, only the apparent selectivity of HMV for sodium appears to be significant. The diameter of naked Na + is around 2 \u00c5 , and that of K + is 2.66 \u00c5 , and the diameter of the ETM pore at the level of N15 (4 to 5 \u00c5 ) is sufficient to accommodate a single dehydrated Na + or K + ion. Hence it may be speculated that N15, or its polar equivalent in other sequences, form a selectivity filter for cations. The equivalent residue to SARS-CoV E N15 in MHV E is Gln (Fig. S7) , which has a one methylene longer side chain. This may lead to further occlusion of the channel at this position, and may explain the observed higher selectivity for sodium in MHV E. We also note that the lumen-facing orientation of Asn and Gln may also have a structural role, as these residues are known to stabilize transmembrane interactions [44] [45] [46] .",

We speculate that the localization of HMA near N15 could be similar in other CoV E proteins because this position (lumenexposed) is always occupied by a polar residue in other CoV E sequences (N, Q, S, T) (Fig. S7) . However, HMA sensitivity has only been shown for E proteins that contain a long polar side chain at this position, e.g., N (SARS-CoV E (this paper), HCoV-229E [36] ) or Q (MHV E [36] ); IBV E, which contains a smaller polar side chain (Thr) was HMA-insensitive [36] . It would be interesting to test if E proteins containing a small polar side chain at this position, e.g., S or T, are generally HMA insensitive.",

The weak inhibition observed for amiloride is consistent with our NMR data, because addition of amiloride to ETM showed an increase in line broadening, but only small changes in peak positions, suggesting a global perturbation of protein structure but not a specific interaction. Finally, although the chemical shifts induced by AMT (not shown) were similar to those observed for HMA, we did not observe NOEs between AMT and ETM. This is not unexpected; in contrast with what we observed in a lysineflanked ETM peptide [37, 38] , the in vitro ion channel activity observed for ETM without flanking lysines, i.e., like the one used herein, was not inhibited by AMT [38] .",

The M2 open state (low pH) has been shown to be dynamic or heterogeneous [48] , as opposed to the less flexible closed state (high pH). Addition of AMT to M2 caused substantial narrowing of 15 N spectra [48] and a reduced M2 conformational distribution in a MAS 13 C and 15 N NMR study [49] , both indicative of a more rigid M2 channel in the presence of the drug. The latter studies conform to a model where M2 accesses several conformational states, and AMT would stabilize a 'closed' conformation. In SARS-CoV E, a similar rigidization of ETM may be partly responsible for inhibition, although physical blockage to ion passage is also possible. A more complete ETM labeling approach, which is in progress, will undoubtedly shed more light on the nature of this inhibition.",
