            "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a single-stranded RNA coronavirus that causes nervous dysfunction in the infected hosts and leads to widespread alterations in the host transcriptome by modulating specific microRNA (miRNA) levels. MiRNAs contribute to RNA virus pathogenesis by promoting antiviral immune response, enhancing viral replication, or altering miRNA-mediated host gene regulation. Thus, exploration of the virus-miRNA interactions occurring in PHEV-infected host may lead to the identification of novel mechanisms combating the virus life cycle or pathogenesis. Here, we discovered that the expression of miR-10a-5p was constitutively up-regulated by PHEV in both the N2a cells in vitro and mice brain in vivo. Treatment with miR-10a-5p mimics allowed miR-10a-5p enrichment and resulted in a significant restriction in PHEV replication, suggesting widespread negative regulation of the RNA virus infection by miR-10a-5p. The outcomes were also evidenced by miR-10a-5p inhibitor over-expression. Luciferase reporter, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting analysis further showed that Syndecan 1 (SDC1), a cell surface proteoglycan associated with host defense mechanisms, acts as a target gene of miR-10a-5p during PHEV infection. Naturally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SDC1 leads to a reduction in viral replication, implying that SDC1 expression is likely a favorable condition for viral replication. Together, the findings demonstrated that the abundant miR-10a-5p leads to downstream suppression of SDC1, and it functions as an antiviral mechanism in the PHEV-induced disease, providing a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of PHEV infection in the future work.",

PHEV is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus and coding five structural proteins, including small envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), and hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE) (Dong et al., 2014) . The main host of PHEV infection is the piglets under 3 weeks of age, manifested by vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) or encephalomyelitis, with a mortality rate of nearly 100% (Vijgen et al., 2006) . Previous studies have shown that the disease is widespread worldwide (Gao et al., 2011) , although it is often in a subclinical state in conventional swine farms owing to the colostrum antibodies and age-related resistance (Rho et al., 2011) . By now, there are no effective preventive vaccines or drugs for prevention; thus, research on PHEV infection is vital to prevent outbreaks.",

The mature miRNAs are single-stranded RNA of \u223c20 nucleotides, which participate in almost biological processes, including hostpathogen interactions (Huang et al., 2017) . Increasing studies demonstrate that miRNAs are involved in host-virus interactions and actively regulate the replication of pathogenic viruses (Haasnoot and Berkhout, 2011) . For example, miR-30e * inhibits the dengue virus (DENV) replication by restoring IFN-\u03b2 production (Zhu et al., 2014) . Host cells utilized miR-26a to defend against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection by activating innate antiviral immunity (Jia et al., 2015) . MiR-185-5p inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV) transcription and replication by targeting ETS transcription factor 1 (ELK1) (Fan et al., 2018) , whereas miR-520a inhibited HBV replication by inactivating the AKT signaling pathway (Sun et al., 2018) . Furthermore, several viruses hijack host miRNAs to promote their replication, such as miR-146a, which promotes HBV replication by targeting zinc finger e-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) . Our previous research found that some miRNAs, such as miR-21a and miR-142-5p, are involved in PHEV infection Lv et al., 2017) , and these findings lead to a better understanding of miRNA-mediated regulation of PHEV infection.",

Its expression was dramatically inhibited during PHEV infection in vivo and in vitro, which was determined by qRT-PCR and western blotting (Figures 3A,B) . An immunofluorescence assay (IFA) analysis further confirmed that SDC1 expression decreased in the PHEV-infected N2a cells compared with the uninfected ones ( Figure 3C) .

We found that the luciferase activity of SDC1-WT was significantly decreased when it was co-transfected with the miR-10a-5p mimic for 24 h in the HEK293T cells ( Figure 4A) .

No significant changes of luciferase activity were observed when co-transfecting with SDC1-MUT reporter and either miR-10a-5p mimics or inhibitors (Figures 4A,B) . To further validate the effect of the interaction between miR-10a-5p and SDC1, expression of endogenous SDC1 was analyzed in the N2a cells that pre-transfected with miR-10a-5p mimics or inhibitors. The application of miR-10a-5p mimics significantly decreased the mRNA and protein level of SDC1 at both doses of 50 and 100 nM (Figures 4C,E,F) . The promotion effects on SDC1 expression were observed in the miR-10a-5p inhibitor-transfected group (Figures 4D,F) . Together, PHEVinduced miR-10a-5p up-regulation was shown to lead to decreased SDC1 protein level, and SDC1 mRNA is a direct target of miR-10a-5p.",

The knockdown of gene level was determined by qRT-PCR and western blotting, and we found that the SDC1 mRNA was cut down by more than 70% at 50 nM of siRNA-1transfected cells (Figures 5A,B) . We next determined the effect of SDC1 defect on PHEV infection. N2a cells were transfected with 50 nM of SDC1 siRNA-1, followed by infection of PHEV at 37 \u2022 C for indicated times. At 24, 48, and 72 h post infection, the levels of PHEV replication were analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blotting, and the viral titers were measured by TCID 50 /ml on 96-well plates as well. We found that the viral load was markedly reduced in these cells (Figures 5C-E) . These results demonstrated that SDC1 is positively related with PHEV replication. Therefore, we draw a conclusion by summarizing several tentative findings of the study above and pointing out that the host cells make use of miR-10a-5p to reduce SDC1 levels, in response to PHEV infection.

PBS-injected mice were used as a mock control. Then, the brain tissues were collected and assigned to assess the expression of miR-10a-5p and SDC1. In the miR-10a-5p agomir-injected mice, an apparent accumulation of miR-10a-5p RNA was observed at 24 h after injection (Figure 6A) , thereby leading to SDC1 mRNA and protein level restriction, in compared with the control groups (Figures 6B,C) . Next, we infected the mice with PHEV, followed by miR-10a-5p agomir injection at 24 and 72 h post infection. At 5 days post infection, the expression of PHEV was analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blotting. We found that the viral replication appears to be considerably reduced in the brain of PHEVinfected mice after being injected with miR-10a-5p agomir (Figures 6C,D) . And also, the brain tissue was weighed and lysed in serum-free MEM, and the viral titration was performed by using a standard plaque assay. As shown in Figure 6E , the infectious viral titer was generally lower in the agomir-treated mice than that in the PBS or control group (Figure 6E ). Taken together with the research and analysis above, we concluded that SDC1 is a potential antiviral target, which is controlled by host miR-10a-5p miRNA at the post-transcriptional level in PHEV-induced disease.",

Of particular note is that many of novel miRNAs and related target genes have been identified to be involved in different stages of virus infections, but in-depth molecular mechanism studies are lacking. Cellular miRNAs can affect virus replication in a direct or indirect way. The former acts as an effected pathway by combining with the virus or viral components. For instance, cellular miR-17 promotes the stability and translation of viral RNA by targeting the 3 -UTR of RNA viruses (Scheel et al., 2016) . The latter affects virus replication by targeting host cellular mRNAs (Balasubramaniam et al., 2018) . For example, miR-200b and miR-429 suppress the expression of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2), the two cellular proteins that have key roles to establish and maintain latent infections of Epstein-Barr virus, thus leading to lytic reactivation of latently infected cells (Ellis-Connell et al., 2010) .

Yet more miRNA-PHEV interactome research is lacking. Our paper focuses on the host miR-10a-5p and how it evolved to use target gene to join PHEV replication and pathogenesis. The findings presented here firstly identified SDC1 as a promising and novel target of the miR-10a-5p and also provided the evidence that miR-10a-5p could weaken the function of SDC1, which is a cell surface proteoglycan that bears both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate and necessary for host defense mechanisms, angiogenesis, cancer proliferation and invasion, and microbial attachment and entry (Teng et al., 2012) .",

Agomir mixture of hsa-mir-127-3p, hsa-mir-486-5p, hsa-mir-593-5p, mmu-mir-487b-5p, and hsa-miR-1-3p protected mice from influenza (H1N1) virus infection (Peng et al., 2018) , whereas miR-m01-3-5p and miR-M23-1-5p agomirs have protective effects on reactivation of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) in animals (Deng et al., 2017) . Therefore, understanding the host regulatory machinery hijacked by miRNAs during PHEV infection has a potential sense in antiviral therapies. Advancement of knowledge on the interaction between RNA viruses and cellular miRNAs focuses on how the RNA viruses have evolved to use host miRNAs to evade antiviral immune responses, leading to enhanced viral replication and pathogenesis. In our study, miR-10a-5p agomir treatment decreased the virus load in the brain tissue of PHEV-infected mice, by miRNA-mediated changes in antiviral-associated effector activity, further supporting the validation of specific miRNAs as potential antiviral agents in the PHEV-induced disease. However, the role of SDC1 activity during PHEV infection remains unclear. Although the data of SDC1 knockdown assay preliminarily suggests that SDC1 might identify as a novel protein involved in the life cycle of PHEV, or specific functional contribution to viral pathogenesis, further experiments would be required to elucidate this point. It is likely that future work will obtain insights into the downstream signaling processes of the SDC1-dependent PHEV replication restriction. And identifying more miRNAs that are involved in down-regulating the innate immune response during PHEV infection is also of great significance.",
