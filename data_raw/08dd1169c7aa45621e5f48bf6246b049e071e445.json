The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (A); MagNA Pure LC2.0 Automatic extractor (B); KingFisher (C); and NucliSENS EasyMag (D) RNA extraction systems were evaluated for extraction efficiency and co-purification of inhibitors from stool suspensions. Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) of MS-2 coliphage spiked into each system's lysis buffer served as an external control for both. Cycle thresholds (Cts) of the MS2 were determined for RNA extracted from stool suspensions containing unknown (n = 93) or varying amounts of inhibitors (n = 92). Stool suspensions from the latter group were also used to determine whether MS-2 and enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibitions were correlated. Specifically 23 RNA extracts from stool suspensions were spiked with enterovirus RNA after extraction and 13 of these stool suspension were spiked with intact enterovirus before extraction. MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition varied for RNAs extracted by the different systems. Inhibition was noted in 12 (13.0%), 26 (28.3%), 7 (7.6%), and 7 (7.6%) of the first 93 RNA extracts, and 58 (63.0%), 55 (59.8%), 37 (40.2%) and 30 (32.6%) of the second 92 extracts for A, B, C, and D, respectively. Furthermore, enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibition correlated with MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition for added enterovirus RNA or virus particles. In conclusion, rRT-PCR for MS-2 RNA is a good predictor of inhibition of enterovirus RNA extracted from stool suspensions. EasyMag performed the best, however all four extraction methods were suitable provided that external controls identified problematic samples.

However, interpretation of results is not always straightforward. The sensitivity of the rRT-PCR is negatively impacted, by compounds present in the clinical sample that may partially or completely inhibit the RT and/or PCR chemistries [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] . Potential inhibitors that might be incompletely removed from stool suspensions during RNA extraction include hemoglobin, immunoglobulins, bilirubin, triglycerides, complex polysaccharides, organic and phenolic compounds, glycogen, fats, and metabolic products especially those from pathological conditions, bacteria, vegetables, medications, anticoagulants, and drugs or alcohol [4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11] . Adding to the list of endogenous rRT-PCR inhibitors are exogenous inhibitors from extraction protocols such as detergents, chelating compounds and guanidinium HCl [9] .",

No significant difference between inhibition of MS2 rRT-PCR and enterovirus rRT-PCR was noted when equivalent amounts of enterovirus RNA was added to extracts prepared by protocols A, B and C (Fig. 2. part 2) . However, when the higher amount of enterovirus RNA was added, there was significantly less inhibition of enterovirus rRT-PCR than MS2 rRT-PCR extracts prepared using protocols B, C, and D, but not A.

Among clinical samples, stool suspensions contain a wide range of materials that have the potential to inhibit RT and/or PCR chemistries [4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11] .

These four commercial extraction methods are among the most commonly used in the diagnostic laboratories. None of samples 1 to 93 contained MS2 RNA. Similarly Nonove et al (14) did not report any unusual amounts of MS2 RNA that would have indicated prior presence of MS2 in their samples when they added MS2 to 106 stool suspensions at concentrations two to eight-fold less than used in this study. MS2 coliphage was thus used as a non-competitive external control because of its absence from human clinical samples. MS2 is a better external control for rRT-PCR than plasmid or phage DNA since it also measures the efficiency of the RT reaction [5, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18] . Here, the MS2 was added to the lysis buffers to minimize sample manipulation and increase the uniformity between manual and semi-automatic extraction protocols. The presence of rRT-PCR inhibitors was evaluated by extracting equal volumes of stool suspension and eluting with equal volumes of elution buffer. Extractions were performed in parallel to eliminate storage related differences, and RNA was assayed on the same rRT-PCR run to minimize analytical differences [19] . Absence of MS2 in the stool samples 1-93 was confirmed by MS2 rRT-PCR of RNA extracted with the EasyMag RNA extraction system using lysis buffer without exogenous MS2. This extraction protocol, the system that had the least amount of samples with inhibitors, was chosen to increase the chance of finding any endogenous MS2 RNA in the stools.",

Stool samples extracted by the KingFisher and the NucliSENS easyMag had fewer extracts with inhibitors than the QIAamp [18, 20, 21, 22] found that procedures similar to that used by EasyMag outperformed manual extraction procedures similar to QIAgen, and that MagNA Pure and KingFisher-like procedures were intermediate. In contrast fewer did not find major differences between some of these systems [23, 24] . Results presented here further confirm that RNA extracted with magnetic bead-based systems contained fewer inhibitors than column-based systems [21] . The number of samples with inhibitors was low in the first group of samples (samples 1-93) that were used to compare RNA extraction procedures. In order to better compare the four extraction procedures, we selected from among previously tested samples, sufficient numbers of archived stool suspensions that had high, intermediate, and low levels of inhibitors after extraction by QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (samples 101-192). The stool suspensions were re-extracted in parallel by all four protocols and evaluated for inhibition of MS2 rRT-PCR.

We performed a similar analysis by adding enterovirus RNA to RNA samples after extraction and intact enterovirus to suspensions before extraction. The inhibition of enterovirus rRT-PCR correlated with MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition. It is important to note that all four extraction protocols yielded equivalent amounts of enterovirus RNA from enterovirus added to suspensions where there was no inhibition of MS2 RNA rRT-PCR in the samples for equal starting and elution volumes. The pattern and amount of enterovirus rRT-PCR inhibition was similar for specific suspensions regardless of whether enterovirus was added before extraction or viral RNA added to the reaction mix after extraction.

A reaction with a three-fold shift upwards in Ct due the presence of inhibitors would still be positive, i.e. a specific signal would still be detectable below the 40 cycle cap recommended for the majority of rRT-PCR assays. A two Ct difference is within the statistical variation that may occur between repeated analyses of the same RNA. In contrast, a positive signal would no longer be detectible if there were a six-fold shift in Ct, which would produce a false negative outcome. In conclusion, inhibition is a complex process. All four extraction methods were suitable provided that an external control was used to identify problematic samples. rRT-PCR of MS2 RNA recovered from MS2 coliphage added to the lysis buffers of RNA extraction systems is a good predictor of inhibition of enteroviral RNA extracted from stool suspensions. More than one inhibitor may be present in the stool suspensions or added during extraction and their efficiency of removal differs between the extraction protocols. The correlation between the extent of MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition and enteroviral rRT-PCR inhibition increases inversely in relation to the amount of enteroviral RNA in the sample. In agreement with Dreier et al [5] , MS2 rRT-PCR inhibition should be tested for each RNA sample from a stool suspensions each time it is tested since there is no way to predict in advance whether inhibitors have been efficiently removed during extraction or remain active after cycles of frozen storage. Viral rRT-PCR results should not be considered as quantitative results when MS2 rRT-PCR is inhibited by more than 3 Ct. Finally, we recommend that any negative viral rRT-PCR result from a sample with an inhibition of .6 Ct for MS2 rRT-PCR should be considered invalid and alternative methods used to re-assay or re-extract the sample. If the RNA is diluted and re-tested only samples with positive results for enterovirus rRT-PCR should be considered as valid. ",

Ninety-three of the stool samples contained unknown amounts of rRT-PCR inhibitors (Table 1; Fig. S1 ). The remaining ninety-two stools suspensions were selected from among 860 stool suspensions archived between 2009 and 2011 that had been sent for routine enterovirus analysis (Table 1 , Figs. 1, 2, 3 and S2 ). The RNA from these archived suspensions had been extracted manually with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and MS2 rRT-PCR and inhibition levels were known. MS2 rRT-PCR inhibitors .5 Ct were found in 93 (10.8%) of these samples. A non-random subset of 92 of these 860 samples (samples 101 to 192) with high, intermediate, and low levels of inhibitors were chosen for re-analysis so that would be a sufficient number of samples for comparison at each of these levels of inhibition.",

Negative values were set to 0 and the maximum values for inhibition ''C'' were capped at 29 Cts. Samples with inhibition $10, 6 to 9, 3 to 6, and 1 to 3 CT are indicated by the colors of the boxes: black, red, tan, and light yellow, respectively. 2. The mean inhibition of MS2 and enterovirus rRT-PCR results is listed for the above by protocol. Yellow boxes indicate the pairwise comparisons where the inhibition of enteroviral rRT-PCR and MS2 differed significantly by Repeated Measurements, Analysis of Variance. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039455.g003",
