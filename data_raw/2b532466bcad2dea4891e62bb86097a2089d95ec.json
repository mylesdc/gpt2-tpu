BNoV was the only enteric pathogen detected in outbreaks according to tests for enteric viruses, bacteria and parasites. The complete genome of the newly identified strain CH-HNSC-2018 was successfully sequenced and found to be 7342 nucleotides in length. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed that CH-HNSC-2018 belongs to GIII.2 BNoV. Further analysis of the major capsid protein demonstrated that it is separated by specific genetic distances from previous BNoV strains identified in China and has 4 new amino acid (aa) mutations, 134A, 327 T, 380 L and 423A, in the VP1 protein and 11 aa substitutions in the hypervariable P2 subdomain, suggesting that the BNoV strains circulating in China are diverse. Conclusions: This is the first detection of GIII.2 BNoV in the VP1 region in China. This report should form a basis for further molecular studies on NoV and bovine enteric viruses in China.",

NoV belongs to the family Caliciviridae and genus Norovirus, and its genome is approximately 7.5-7.7 kb, which encodes for 3 open reading frames (ORF1-3). ORF1 encodes a large polyprotein that is cleaved into 6 nonstructural proteins (N-terminal-NTPase-3A-like-VPg-3C-like-polymerase); ORF2 encodes VP1, the major capsid protein; and ORF3 encodes VP2, a minor structural protein. The pathogenesis of calicivirus remains unclear, and little is known about NoV. One important reason for this lack of knowledge is that NoV has rarely been successfully propagated in cell culture; the sole exception is the culture of a murine isolate.",

            "text": "NoVs are classified into seven genogroups (GI-GVII). Bovine norovirus (BNoV), which belongs to GIII (NoVs-GIII), is divided into two distinct genotypes based on amino acid (aa) diversity of the complete VP1 sequence, genotypes 1 (Bo/Jena/1980/DE) and 2 (Bo/Newbury2/ 1976/UK), which were originally discovered in Germany [2] and England [3] , respectively. Recently, a dual nomenclature system was established to characterize the genomic properties of BNoV strains based on the sequences of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRp (end of ORF1) and major capsid protein (beginning of ORF2). Based on this novel nomenclature system, BNoV GIII is reclassified into GIII.P1_GIII.1 (which contains polymerase and VP1 genes from the Jena strain), GIII.P2_GIII.2 (which contains polymerase and VP1 genes from the Newbury2 strain), GIII.P1_GIII.2 (which contains a polymerase gene from the Jena strain and a VP1 from the Newbury2 (recombinant) strain, e.g., the Bo/Thirsk10/00/UK strain), and GIII.P2_GIII.1 (which contains a polymerase gene from the Newbury2 strain and a VP1 gene from the Jena (recombinant) strain, e.g., the B-1SVD/03/US strain) [4] . Moreover, some studies have employed ORF3 to characterize the phylogenetic topology of BNoV [5] . Until now, the available BNoV strain sequences have been limited [6] and have not provided enough data to establish intensive phylogenetic relationships or rates of evolution of BNoVs. To date, BNoV has been reported worldwide, including in China [7] , Iran [8] , Egypt [9] , Argentina [10] , Italy [11] , the USA [12] , and New Zealand [13] , leading to substantial loss to the worldwide bovine industry. Furthermore, serum antibodies against BNoV (GIII) have been detected in humans [14] , and sequences of human NoVs have been identified in bovine stool specimens [15] , suggesting possible interspecies transmission [16] .",

NoV is one of the leading causes of human and animal gastroenteritis; however, BNoV is not usually included in the diagnostic algorithms of calf diarrhoea. In this study, during pathogen detection of diarrhoeal calves, only BNoV was detected, and other enteric viruses, Coccidium species and Cryptosporidium species were not found. However, the relationship between BNoV infection and diarrhoea in calves requires further epidemiological and experimental studies.",

Due to the limited epidemiological data on BNoV infections in China, the dominant strains cannot be accurately confirmed. More studies on the epidemiology of this emerging pathogen should be carried out in Henan Province and other provinces in China. A BNoV outbreak in China was reported in Hebei and Sichuan Provinces in 2018, and the 3 strains identified were BNoV-GIII.1 based on the partial region of the RdRp polymerase ORF (532 bp) [7] . Nevertheless, the BNoV strain detected in our study was BNoV-GIII 2. Given that strains with different BNoV genotypes co-exist in China, prevention and control are more complex. The results of our study will facilitate further research on the evolution and molecular pathogenesis of BNoV. The importance of BNoV surveillance should be stressed given the cattle industry-intensive area of China.",

X-ray crystallography structures for NoV [24] reveal that the main icosahedral core of the capsid is composed of a conserved S domain and a variable P domain. A sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies were conducted using complete VP1 sequences as phylogenetic markers. It is important to evaluate whether aa changes mainly occur in the P domain or the S domain. The P domain is further divided into a comparatively conserved P1 domain and a highly variable P2 subdomain. The latter has an external localization, and compatible with their functions, both cell receptors are involved in interactions with the host cell membrane [25] and have the most important epitopes [26] . In the present report, we identified four unique aa mutations of VP1 in CH-HNSC-2018 (134A, 327 T, 380 L and 423A) and two (327 T and 380 L) within the P2 subdomain. The hypervariable P2 domain contains putative receptor-binding sites and is responsible for host specificity and strain diversity [23, 24] . Therefore, it was speculated that the large shift in aa in the P2 domain may have major implications for the immunogenic characteristics of this novel genotype as well as significant implications for further vaccine development [27] . These substitutions may have major implications in the immunogenic characteristics of the emerging strain CH-HNSC-2018. Thus, further study of the impact of these aa mutations in the VP1 region on the function of the VP1 protein is required.",

The outbreak lasted for more than 10 days, despite routine treatment with antibiotics, including sulfonamides, penicillin, cephalosporin, and enrofloxacin, which were less efficient. Meanwhile, no clinical signs were observed in other bovine herd age groups, including young and adult cattle, during the outbreak. To diagnose the enteric pathogens, a total of eight faecal samples were collected from sick calves and used for RNA extraction and virus isolation.

A phylogenetic tree was generated by MEGA 7.0 software using the neighbour-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates To investigate the aetiologic features of the newly identified BNoV strain, we next analysed aa substitution mutations of CH-HNSC-2018. Compared to the other available BNoV strains in GenBank, CH-HNSC-2018 contains several aa substitutions in the VP1 protein, 19 aa substitutions throughout the P domain, and 11 aa substitutions in the P2 domain. Interestingly, 4 new aa mutations, 134A, 327 T, 380 L and 423A, were identified in the VP1 protein of CH-HNSC-2018. (Additional file 1:",
