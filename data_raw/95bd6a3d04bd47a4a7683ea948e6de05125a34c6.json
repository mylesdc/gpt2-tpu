According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between the 1960s and today, obesity prevalence more than quadrupled from 4% to 17% (1). Among obese teenagers, 80% will become obese adults, potentially suffering the gamut of weight-related problems. Physiologically, only imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure can explain the shifts in weight. However, diet and exercise--the primary recipients of research attention with respect to intake and expenditure--do not correlate with childhood obesity as much as might be expected (2) . Moreover, randomized clinical trials addressing diet and exercise have demonstrated little to no impact on childhood body mass index (BMI) indicating that, even if they are important, they are difficult to modify (3) . We hypothesize that the rise in childhood obesity is caused by the loss of recurrent and chronic infections in modern, industrialized society, beginning in utero and extending through early childhood.",

In the extreme, however, few would disagree that infection protects against obesity. Children who suffer severe, recurrent infection -e.g. children in the developing world -are rarely, if ever, fat. In the industrialized world, recurrent infections in cystic fibrosis result in heightened resting energy expenditure (REE) and poor weight gain despite good caloric intake (4) . Although these extremes may have little relevance to average children, the hypothesis that infection decreases weight in normal children is certainly plausible. Infections both increase expenditure and decrease caloric intake. Each degree Celsius elevation in temperature results in 7-16% increase in REE (5, 6) .",

Despite similar temperature curves and caloric intake during their period of illness, infants with neonatal sepsis have 120% the REE with 35% the weight gain of non-septic neonates (7) . Of course, just because temperature and REE are acutely elevated during fever doesn't mean that children will lose weight over a longer term. In fact, some studies indicate a rebound in weight after some acute illnesses (5) . However, chronic infections -e.g. asymptomatic HIV, bacteriuria, and schistosomiasis -have all been associated with prolonged REE elevations (8-10), as has elevation in C-reactive protein (11) . Similarly, treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) results in reduction of REE (12) . Adipocytokines, too, may be affected by infection. For example, eradication of Helicobacter pylori in pre-pubertal children decreases ghrelin levels and increases BMI compared to untreated children (13) . In fact, most chronic infections -symptomatic and asymptomatic -are likely to increase metabolic demands in their constant cross-talk with the host. Other mechanisms may be in play as well. Inflammatory cytokines suppress appetite and affect cell differentiation. Specifically, circulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF) both inhibits adipocyte differentiation and promotes lipolysis (14) . In this manner, short-term infections can have long-term effects on very young children.",

Triclosan is regulated by the FDA, which is currently conducting a review on its safety (26). To date, triclosan has been proven to reduce plague and gingivitis when used in toothpaste; no other evidence showing an extra benefit to health for triclosan in other consumer products has been demonstrated. The mechanism of action at higher concentrations is non-specific but at lower concentrations, appears to specifically target bacterial fatty acid synthesis. These antibiotic properties have led to concerns about development of antimicrobial resistance. In addition, there is evidence that triclosan may be an endocrine disruptor in animal models.
