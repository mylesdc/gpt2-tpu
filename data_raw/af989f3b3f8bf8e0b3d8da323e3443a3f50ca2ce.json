We conducted a retrospective study of children with histologically confirmed ELP at Red Cross Children's Hospital, South Africa. Twelve children of Zimbabwean heritage aged 2.1-10.8 months were identified between 2012 and 2017. Repeated oral administration of plant-based oil for cultural reasons was reported by 10 of 11 caregivers. Cough (12/12), tachypnoea (11/12), hypoxia (9/12), and diffuse alveolar infiltrates on chest radiography (12/12) were common at presentation. Chest computed tomography revealed ground-glass opacification with lower zone predominance (9/9) and interlobular septal thickening (8/9). Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens appeared cloudy/milky, with abundant lipid-laden macrophages and extracellular lipid on Oil-Red-O staining (12/12), with polymicrobial (6/12) and Mycobacterium abscessus (2/12) coinfection. Antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids, and therapeutic lavage were interventions in all eight and five patients, respectively.

Populations at risk include the elderly, children, and those with an underlying swallowing dysfunction or neurological disorder resulting in an unprotected airway. In addition, forced ingestion in the recumbent position in infants and young children who actively refuse oil may result in gagging and aspiration of the oil [5] . Common ailments for which oil has been used medically or culturally include constipation, colic, and nasal stuffiness [6] .",

Processing and examination of BAL and lung tissue were conducted according to the European Management Platform for Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease protocols [7] . Partial therapeutic lung lavage (using 2.8 mm Olympus \u00ae flexible bronchoscope) with 200-300 mL 0.9% warmed saline, targeting the worst affected regions of the lung, was performed in selected cases where clinically significant hypoxemia and/or symptoms did not resolve spontaneously with medical management and cessation of oil administration in hospital.

Common symptoms at presentation of these infants included: tachypnoea (11/12), hypoxia (9/12), fever (4/12), hyperinflation (2/12), and digital clubbing (2/12). Six of 12 children were hospitalized for pneumonia on at least one other occasion besides the episode in which the diagnostic BAL that was conducted provided histocytological evidence of ELP. Underlying risk factors that were documented included gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) confirmed on scintigraphy (3/6), in combination with silent aspiration confirmed on contrast swallow (2/4). Ten of the 11 mothers interviewed confirmed the administration of oil to their children. In five patients, this history was obtained after reviewing BAL findings. Oil administration emerged to be a nearly universal cultural practice by Zimbabweans, even in the Cape Town diaspora. (Table 1) .",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study from Africa describing histologically confirmed ELP. Our study reveals that this diagnosis may go unrecognized if a history of oil administration is not obtained in children presenting with recurrent/persistent pneumonia or ILD. Oil was administered to alleviate colic and constipation, consistent with findings from other regions [5, 8] . Furthermore, M. abscessus co-infection has not previously been reported in children with ELP. Other Nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) described in children with ELP include Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium chelonei, and Mycobacterium smegmatis [8, 11] . Mycobacterium abscessus complex has been reported in adult patients with ELP [12] . It is postulated that oil increases the pathogenicity of mycobacteria possibly by hindering macrophage function and phagocytosis [3] . Kudoh et al. demonstrated that there was increased virulence of NTM when inoculated in oil in comparison with aqueous solutions [13] . Similarly, the lipid environment in the lung may be responsible for other secondary infections detected in BAL cultures among children with ELP [6] , also seen in this series.",
