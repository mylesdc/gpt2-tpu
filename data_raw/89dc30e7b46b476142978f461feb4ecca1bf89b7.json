Nevertheless, we provide evidence that the pore forming activity of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin listeriolysin O (LLO) can induce autophagy subsequent to infection by L. monocytogenes. Infection of BMDMs with L. monocytogenes induced microtubuleassociated protein light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation, consistent with autophagy activation, whereas a mutant lacking LLO did not. Infection of BMDMs that express LC3-GFP demonstrated that wild-type L. monocytogenes was encapsulated by LC3-GFP, consistent with autophagy activation, whereas a mutant lacking LLO was not. Bacillus subtilis expressing either LLO or a related cytolysin, perfringolysin O (PFO), induced LC3 colocalization and LC3 lipidation. Further, LLO-containing liposomes also recruited LC3-GFP, indicating that LLO was sufficient to induce targeted autophagy in the absence of infection. The role of autophagy had variable effects depending on the cell type assayed. In atg5 2/2 mouse embryonic fibroblasts, L. monocytogenes had a primary vacuole escape defect. However, the bacteria escaped and grew normally in atg5 2/2 BMDMs.",

Autophagy is a mechanism by which cytoplasmic components, including long-lived proteins and damaged organelles (peroxisomes, ER, and mitochondria) are enveloped within specialized double-membrane-bound vesicles that deliver their cargo to the lysosome for degradation [19] [20] [21] . It has been hypothesized that basal levels of autophagy occur continuously inside of cells [20] . An increase in autophagic activity can be stimulated by amino acid starvation, hormone signaling, cytokines, TLR stimulation, immunity related GTPases and microbial infection [16] [17] [18] 20] .

            "text": "L. monocytogenes has been shown to interact with the host autophagic machinery. Rich et al. (2003) reported that approximately 92% of chloramphenicol treated L. monocytogenes were surrounded by double-membrane vacuoles in J774 macrophage-like cells 21 hours post infection. The number of these chloramphenicoltreated bacteria captured by autophagic-like membranes decreased in the presence of autophagy inhibitors [22] . Subsequently, Py et al. (2007) showed that L. monocytogenes induces autophagy, as measured by microtubule associated light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation and colocalization of LC3 with intracellular bacteria. Further, Py et al., (2007) provided evidence that L. monocytogenes replicate more efficiently in autophagy-deficient (atg5 2/2 ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to wild-type MEFs, suggesting that an Atg5-dependent process directly inhibits the replication of wildtype L. monocytogenes in mammalian cells. Using similar assays to test for autophagic induction, Birmingham et al. (2007) demonstrated that RAW 264.7 macrophages transfected with LC3-GFP, exhibited colocalization of transfected LC3-GFP with L. monocytogenes. However, the authors of this study did not observe that wild-type L. monocytogenes grew better in atg5 2/2 MEFs than in wild-type MEFs. Thus the role of Atg5 in the control of wild-type L. monocytogenes replication in cultured transformed MEF cells remains controversial. Py et al. (2007) and Birmingham et al. (2007) reported that L. monocytogenes lacking LLO did not induce autophagy, as measured by LC3I lipidation and colocalization. Further, both ActA and the bacterial phospholipases (PlcA and PlcB) were reported to play a role in escaping autophagy, as measured by LC3I colocalization and bacterial growth in the presence or absence of Atg5 [23, 24] . This suggested that autophagy may play a role in the control of wild-type L. monocytogenes replication that is effectively inhibited by the action of bacterial phospholipases and/or actin polymerization. However, this hypothesis has not been directly tested in primary cells. Yano et al. (2008) showed that autophagy in Drosophila hemocytes was induced in response to L. monocytogenes infection and was dependent upon detection of peptidoglycan by the cytosolic receptor PGRP-LE as well as on bacterial expression of LLO. Lastly, Zhao et al. (2008) revealed that mice lacking Atg5 in macrophages and neutrophils had a slight increase in susceptibility to L. monocytogenes as measured by bacterial levels in spleen and liver three days after infection. However, this work did not address whether the role of Atg5 in vivo was due to autophagy or an autophagy-independent role of Atg5. Furthermore, Zhao et al. (2008) did not address whether Atg5 controls L. monocytogenes replication in primary cells.",

Activation of autophagy triggers LC3-I lipidation resulting in the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, which is measured by a mobility shift on SDS-PAGE [27] . Within 40 minutes of infection with wild-type L. monocytogenes, the amount of LC3-II increased compared to uninfected cells (Fig. 1A) . Dhly (LLO-minus) L. monocytogenes and heat-killed bacteria stimulated almost no LC3-I to LC3-II conversion, as compared to wild-type L. monocytogenes over a 60 minute time course of infection ( Fig. 1B and data not shown) . Therefore, we concluded that while infection alone induced very little autophagy, wild-type bacteria secreting LLO induced increased amounts of autophagy. Further, we found that during a 60-minute infection, the absence of the bacterial proteins ActA and either of the phospholipases did not significantly affect the amount of autophagy activation as measured by LC3-I lipidation (Fig. 1B) .",

Because only ,10% of phagosomes harboring LLO-loaded liposomes are competent to rupture (as measured by dye release; KD Lee, personal communication), 8% was not statistically significantly different from this 10% expectation, while 2% was statistically significantly different from both the expected (10%) and observed (8%) values (p..99 by z-test, using a binomial distribution). These data are consistent with a model in which LLO-mediated membrane damage is sufficient to induce LC3 colocalization in the absence of bacteria.",

The capacity of L. monocytogenes to escape from phagocytic vacuoles was examined in both fibroblasts and macrophages that lacked functional autophagy due to the targeted disruption of the essential autophagy gene atg5 [33, 34] . L. monocytogenes escaped at an increased rate from primary vacuoles in the presence of autophagy in MEFs (Fig. 5A ). In contrast, the presence of autophagy had no measurable effect on escape rates in bone marrow-derived macrophages (Fig. 5B) . Further, contrary to a previous report, bacterial mutants lacking the secreted phospholipases that contribute to vacuolar escape had similar levels of cytosolic entry in both wild-type and atg5 2/2 MEFs as well as BMDMs (Fig. 5A, B) [24] . Finally, autophagy did not significantly affect the growth of wild-type L. monocytogenes in either MEFs or BMDMs (Fig. 5C, D) . Therefore, while LLO stimulated autophagy, there was no observable consequence in bacterial escape or growth in BMDMs. However, the decreased escape observed in atg5 2/2 MEFs suggests that under some conditions, autophagy may enhance, rather than prevent, bacterial escape.",

            "text": "There is mounting evidence that autophagy contributes to the innate immune response to microbial pathogens [16] [17] [18] . Pathogens that grow and or reside in the cytosol, such as: Shigella flexneri, Francisella tularensis, and Group A Streptococci lyse the host phagosomal membrane, escape into the cytosol and subsequently induce autophagy, as measured by LC3 colocalization, lipidation and electron microscopy [35] [36] [37] . Bacteria that reside in pathogen-modified vacuoles, such as Legionella pneumophila, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have also been reported to stimulate autophagy, also as measured by the above mentioned techniques [18, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . In both groups of bacteria that induce autophagy, it remains unclear if cytosolic translocation of bacteria and/or bacterial products, and/or phagosomal membrane damage, is the signal that induces autophagy. It is formally possible that all three induce autophagy under some conditions. In Drosophila, autophagy is induced by cytoplasmic peptidoglycan sensors, and the signaling pathway involved is independent of the known pathways that induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides [43] . Thus it is possible that L. monocytogenes induction of autophagy is multi-step process, with LLO falling upstream of an as-yet-unidentified receptor. However, the data presented here, with LLO-containing liposomes indicate that, while these other putative steps may play a role during bacterial infection, the presence of damaged membranes alone is sufficient to induce LC3 colocalization. The role of autophagy, if any, during L. monocytogenes infection is only just beginning to be appreciated. Previous studies have provided evidence that L. monocytogenes triggers autophagy, and that autophagy limits bacterial replication [23, 24, 43] . Further, bacterial mutants lacking the pore-forming cytolysin LLO fail to trigger autophagy [23, 24] . Zhao et al. (2008) recently reported that infection of mice lacking Atg5 in macrophages and neutrophils exhibited a modest increase in L. monocytogenes susceptibility.",

In contrast, autophagy slightly increased phagosomal escape and intracellular growth in transformed MEFs, which potentially highlights differences in autophagy utilization and/orfunction between various cell types. Additionally, our data provided no evidence that either ActA or bacterial phospholipases affect autophagy as measured by LC3I lipidation and autophagy-restrictive intracellular growth (some data not shown). Finally, by using heterologous expression of LLO and purified LLO encapsulated in liposomes, we showed that LLO activity was not only necessary but sufficient to trigger autophagy.

Additionally, we examined phagosomal escape much earlier during infection. The majority of wildtype L. monocytogenes escape the vacuole within the first 30 minutes following entry, however Py et al. (2007) assayed escape at four hours post-infection [44] . Since L. monocytogenes begin to spread from cell to cell as early as three hours post-infection and phospholipase mutants have a known defect in escape from a secondary vacuole, it is possible that the defect in growth observed by Py et al. (2007) was due to a defect in escape from vacuoles of secondarily infected cells [13, 45, 46] Autophagy plays a role in cellular homeostasis. For example, smooth ER, excess peroxisomes, damaged mitochondria and rough ER have been shown to be selectively targeted and removed from cells by the autophagic machinery [47] [48] [49] [50] . We propose that some or all of these organelles are targeted by autophagy due to membrane damage. For example, chemically damaged mitochondria are selectively targeted and removed by autophagy [49] . Selective removal is thought to be due to the disruption of the inner membrane by pores which occurs upon depolarization, a signal which may be similar to pore formation due to cytolysin expression [49] . Our hypothesis is further supported by two reports showing that two pore forming toxins secreted by extracellular pathogens, Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC) and the vacuolating cytotoxin from Helicobacter pylori (VacA), also induce autophagy in the absence of infection [51] [52] [53] . Autophagic bodies were identified inside of cells exposed to VCC [52] . Similarly, we noted non-specific induction of autophagy (diffuse puncta formation), when LC3-GFP BMDMs were exposed to increasing concentrations of extracellular LLO (data not shown). Further autophagic induction in response to VacA was blocked when the channel forming activity of the toxin was inhibited [53] . Therefore, autophagy may be a general response to membrane damage, and as a result may have evolved as a mechanism to recognize and target intracellular pathogens.",

For fluorescent labeling of B. subtilis: 1 mL of B. subtilis cultures at OD 600 of 0.8 to 1.2 was washed three times in PBS and resuspended in 1 mL PBS containing 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate pH 9.0 and 20 mg Alexa Fluor 594 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes). B. subtilis were incubated in the labeling reaction gently shaking on ice for 45 minutes. The reaction was washed three times in PBS containing calcium and magnesium and re-suspended in 800 mL PBS containing calcium and magnesium. A range of MOIs from ,46:1 to ,69:1 of Alexa Fluor 594 labeled B. subtilis was used to infect LC3-GFP BMDMs (2.3610 7 to 3.45610 7 B. subtilis and 5610 5 BMDMs). The infection was completed in the presence of 1 mM IPTG. At 30 minutes post-infection, cells were washed twice with PBS containing calcium and magnesium and incubated in fresh media containing 1 mM IPTG and 50 mg/mL gentamicin.",
