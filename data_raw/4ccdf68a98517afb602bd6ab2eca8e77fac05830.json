In this study, a rapid method for detecting PEDV was developed based on cross-priming amplification and nucleic acid test strip(CPA-NATS). Five primers specific for the N gene sequence of PEDV were used for the cross-priming amplification. Detection of amplification products based on labeled probe primers was conducted with strip binding antibody of labeled markers. The CPA method was evaluated and compared with a PCR method. The reverse transcription CPA system was further optimized for detecting PEDV RNA in clinical specimens. Results showed that the method was highly specific for the detection of PEDV, and had the same sensitivity as PCR, with detection limit of 10 \u22126 diluted plasmid containing the target gene of PEDV. It was also successfully applied to detecting PEDV in clinical specimens. The reverse transcription CPA-NATS detection system established in this study offers a specific, sensitive, rapid, and simple detection tool for screening PEDV, which can contribute to strategies in the effective control of PEDV in swine.",

At least seven open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified in the PEDV genome, with a characteristic gene order 5\u2032 -replicase (1a/1b)-S-ORF3-E-M-N-3\u2032 . Several methods including separation identification, serological method, PCR, and colloidal gold method have been used to detect PEDV. The traditional viral separation method has high specificity and sensitivity, but is time consuming and takes at least three to five days. The serological method is mainly used for the identification of PEDV in serum and not directly for fecal samples. The PCR method has high sensitivity, but requires special equipment and reagents that are unavailable at farm level. Although rapid detection through the immune colloidal gold technique has no requirements for a laboratory setting, its positive predictive value is low. The technology still needs bacterial culture as the ultimate standard. Thus, we applied the cross-priming amplification (CPA), which is a novel isothermal amplification reaction technology using Bst DNA polymerase, and multiple primers and probes, one or more of which is a cross primer. Five primers specific for the N gene of PEDV were used. The cross primer with a 5\u2032 tail encodes the complementary strand primer 7 . The amplification consisted of three steps: (1) extension and displacement with cross primer, (2) multiple extensions and 1 displacements with multiple primer binding sites, and (3) further primer extension by primers with stabilized hairpin-like structures that form and act as templates leading to the target products. Then, the products labeled with FAM (fluorescein dye) and biotin were detected using a strip covered with the antibody against FAM or biotin 7 . Two red bands indicate a PEDV-positive result, whereas one red band indicates a PEDV-negative result.",

Other reagents for the assay including MgSO 4 , betaine, deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), and Bst DNA polymerase were also optimized. The final volumes of dNTP (10 mM), MgSO 4 (50 mM), betaine (5 M), and Bst DNA polymerase (10 U/\u03bcL) were 0.8, 0.4, 6, and 1 \u03bcL, respectively ( Fig. 1e-h) . A reaction temperature of 63 \u00b0C was selected for the CPA assays, similar to previous report 8 . The reaction time was extended by 15 and 30 min on the basis of the optimum experimental conditions to determine the relationship between reaction time and sensitivity. Our results indicated that, when CPA reactions were incubated for 90 min, favorable results were obtained without nonspecific amplification (Fig. 1k) . The sensitivity of CPA was higher than that under 60 min (Fig. 1i) and 75 min (Fig. 1j ). In addition, amplification results from the optimized CPA assay correlated 100% with those based on gel electrophoresis.",

The CPA-NATS system based on an isothermal DNA amplification technology and does not require any sophisticated equipment. It has already been applied to clinical diagnosis of human infectious diseases such as tuberculosis 8 , where a double crossing CPA was used to amplify DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The present study employing the CPA-NATS technology was a single crossing CPA assay 7 , which is slightly different from a double crossing CPA. We successfully adopted the technology and optimize all reaction conditions to meet our objective in developing diagnostic system that combines reverse transcription and CPA for detecting RNA virus. Several methods for the detection and diagnosis of PEDV have been described. Recently, a real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) method was reported to be easy to operate and simple to read results, and did not require sophisticated instruments 9, 10 . However, RT-LAMP detects pathogens using reaction-turbidity as an indicator, which is sometimes difficult to determine without an instrument. The test strip result of CPA-NATS offers direct visualization by eyes, and is much easier to be interpreted. A variety of PCR methods have been developed to detect PEDV, such as a nanoparticle-assisted PCR assay 11 , duplex real-time RT-PCR 12 , and multiplex TaqMan probe-based real-time PCR 13 , which can detect and differentiate the variant and virulent strains of PEDV currently reported to be circulating in the US. The above mentioned molecular biology methods all need expensive instruments, which limits their clinical applications particularly in field laboratories or on farm.",
