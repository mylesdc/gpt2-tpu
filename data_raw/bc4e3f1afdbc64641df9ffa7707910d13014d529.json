            "text": "Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) is a plant comovirus in the picornavirus superfamily, and is used for a wide variety of biomedical and material science applications. Although its replication is restricted to plants, CPMV binds to and enters mammalian cells, including endothelial cells and particularly tumor neovascular endothelium in vivo. This natural capacity has lead to the use of CPMV as a sensor for intravital imaging of vascular development. Binding of CPMV to endothelial cells occurs via interaction with a 54 kD cell-surface protein, but this protein has not previously been identified. Here we identify the CPMV binding protein as a cell-surface form of the intermediate filament vimentin. The CPMV-vimentin interaction was established using proteomic screens and confirmed by direct interaction of CPMV with purified vimentin, as well as inhibition in a vimentin-knockout cell line. Vimentin and CPMV were also co-localized in vascular endothelium of mouse and rat in vivo. Together these studies indicate that surface vimentin mediates binding and may lead to internalization of CPMV in vivo, establishing surface vimentin as an important vascular endothelial ligand for nanoparticle targeting to tumors. These results also establish vimentin as a ligand for picornaviruses in both the plant and animal kingdoms of life. Since bacterial pathogens and several other classes of viruses also bind to surface vimentin, these studies suggest a common role for surface vimentin in pathogen transmission.",

The ability to generate nanoscale materials that can specifically target and image sites of disease is an important goal in biomedicine. A variety of nanoparticle strategies have been developed for targeting and imaging in vivo including antibodies [8] , dendrimers [9] , liposomes [10] , nanoshells [11] , quantum dots [12] , and viruses [13, 14] . Viruses are particularly suited for these applications because they are naturally designed for efficient circulation and specific ligand-binding and cellular internalization. Recently interest has turned toward self-assembling plant viruses, bacteriophages [4] , and protein cage [15] architectures that can be adapted for in vivo targeting purposes without the pathogenic properties of animal viruses. However these viruses must generally be tailored to recognize their targets using specific ligands.",

Recent studies have also shown that CPMV can be chemically modified with specific ligands to achieve tumor-specific targeting [14] . Although the host range for CPMV replication is restricted to plants, interestingly the unmodified CPMV capsid also naturally interacts with mammalian cells. Intravital imaging studies using fluorescently-labeled CPMV particles yielded highresolution images of normal and tumor vasculature in vivo [13] . These imaging studies showed that CPMV particles were readily internalized in mouse and chick endothelial cells following intravenous administration in living embryos, and this internalization produced high-resolution images of vasculature in real-time using epifluorescence microscopy [13] . Tumor neovasculature in particular was labeled very strongly by CPMV, and differential internalization by arterial and venous vessels was also observed, however the mechanism of uptake was unknown [13] .",

We also hypothesized that understanding the mechanism of CPMV attachment to mammalian cells would provide important information regarding the relationships between plant and animal picornaviruses.

The 54 kD protein is found in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction of cells, lacks N-and Oglycosylation, and was identified by its ability to bind directly to CPMV particles using a Virus Overlay Protein Blot Assay (VOPBA) [21] . The VOPBA technique has identified many high-affinity virus receptors including those for coronaviruses [22, 23] , adenoviruses [24] , and arenaviruses [25] . Mass spectrometry analysis focused first on enriched plasma membrane proteins that co-migrated with the 54 kD band on SDS-PAGE; this resulted in identification of 68 individual proteins (Table 1) . Surface biotinylation of cells, followed by isolation of enriched plasma membranes and streptavidin-sepharose purification of biotinylated proteins, separation on SDS-PAGE and VOPBA, yielded a sample in the 54 kD range that was also analyzed by LC-MS/MS and yielded 7 proteins ( Table 1 ). The third approach used the enriched plasma membrane fraction as starting material ( Figure 1A ) followed by sequential column chromatography ( Figure 1B ). Here the membrane fraction was first run over a concanavalin A-sepharose column to remove glycoproteins, and the flow-through fraction was bound to an affinity matrix that was generated when surface lysine residues on purified CPMV particles were directly conjugated to N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester-sepharose (CPMV-sepharose). The CPMV-bound sample was washed several times, and then CPMV-sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and bound proteins separated on SDS-PAGE ( Figure 1C ). Three bands were easily visible by SimplyBlue (Invitrogen) staining, corresponding to the 54 kD CPMV-BP, the 42 kD large capsid subunit of CPMV, and the 24 kD small CPMV capsid subunit. The 54 kD band was excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS using nano-electrospray on a linear ion trap mass spectrometer ( Figure 1D ). In this analysis two proteins were positively identified: vimentin and keratin. Keratin is a common laboratory contaminant that is isobaric with vimentin. Vimentin was also identified in all the preceding mass spectrometry analyses (Table 1) . A complete listing of all proteins identified in each screen can be seen in Table S1 .",

CPMV has been found to specifically interact with mammalian cells after oral or intravenous administration, as well as in intravital vascular imaging studies that used a fluorescently modified form of CPMV. Binding of CPMV to mammalian cells was shown to be via a cell-surface binding protein (CPMV-BP). Herein we identify this cell surface CPMV-BP through biochemical analysis, live cell experiments, and animal models. We found this surface exposed protein to be vimentin. Vimentin is principally a cytoskeletal protein that functions in the interior of cells to modulate architecture and dynamics. Our results now indicate surface vimentin can be used as a vascular endothelial marker and targeting option on the exterior surface of these cells. This work also unifies the relationship between CPMV and closely related mammalian viruses such as poliovirus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), and coxsackie virus through the collective use of vimentin during their infectious cycle. Several other bacterial and viral pathogens use surface vimentin as an attachment receptor as well, and this research may lead to the development of broad-spectrum strategies to inhibit infection. on several cell types including apoptotic neutrophils and T cells [27, 28] , activated macrophages [29] , platelets [30] , vascular endothelial cells [31] , brain microvascular endothelial cells [32] , Sezary T cells [33] , and skeletal muscle cells [32] . The mechanism by which vimentin reaches the cell surface, which domains are exposed, and its function at the surface, remain unknown.",

Since vascular endothelial cells are known to internalize CPMV in vivo [13] , enriched plasma membrane proteins isolated from HUVEC were used as a positive control (lane 1), along with HeLa and KB tumor cells (lanes 2 and 3) [21] . All cells contained the 54 kD band when probed with CPMV particles by VOPBA ( Figure 2A ). Significant signal could be observed even when incubating the virus with membrane for as little as 5 minutes. Mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from knockout mice lacking the vimentin gene (vim 2/2 , MFT-16; lane 5) [34, 35] were negative for the 54 kD CPMV-interacting band, while membranes isolated from control vim +/+ fibroblasts (MFT-6; lane 4) contained the 54 kD protein and bound CPMV by VOPBA. CPMV also bound to purified recombinant vimentin protein (lane 7), which migrated at the expected molecular weight. Expression of vimentin in the cell lines as detected by western blot using anti-vimentin antibodies ( Figure 2B ) correlated directly with binding of CPMV in VOPBA. CPMV capsid proteins were also included on the gels (Figure 2A , lane 6) as a positive control in the VOPBA for detection by CPMV-specific polyclonal antibodies. As expected CPMV capsid proteins did not react with anti-vimentin antibodies in the western ( Figure 2B , lane 6; in addition, a loading control for the VOPBA and western blot samples is provided in Figure S1 ). Together these results demonstrate that vimentin is present in the enriched plasma membrane fraction of human cells and binds directly to CPMV.",

HeLa and MFT-6 vim +/+ cells were capable of binding or internalizing CPMV, while MFT-16 vim 2/2 cells could not ( Figure 3 ). Since CPMV does not replicate in mammalian cells, the virus detected represents input virus particles only. In order to determine whether complementing vimentin expression in MFT-16 vim 2/2 cells would increase the CPMV interaction, these cells were transfected with vimentin cDNA. Although MFT-16 vim 2/2 cells had low transfection efficiencies (ranging from 0.1 to 8.0% of cells using a GFP-reporter plasmid, not shown), in the cell population that was transfected with vimentin, a statistically significant (p = 0.036) increase in CPMV binding or uptake was observed when compared to mocktransfected MFT-16 cells. On average 1.21% of vimentin-transfected MFT-16 vim 2/2 cells were CPMV-positive (data not shown). For comparison, under identical conditions 5.36% of mock-transfected HeLa cells were CPMV positive (data not shown). Together these results demonstrate that the lack of CPMV binding observed in vimentin-null cells can be complemented by vimentin expression.",

Fixation and staining procedures to verify cell surface and cytosolic staining were verified through the ability to detect b-COP, an intra-Golgi transport marker ( Figure S3 ). Approximately 50% of HeLa cells exhibited surface vimentin expression by confocal microscopy, and surface vimentin expression was also quantified by flow cytometry when HeLa cells were stained using an antivimentin antibody ( Figure S4 ). These data correlated with CPMV binding or uptake by flow cytometry ( Figure 4E ). CPMV-positive cells were observed within the surface-vimentin-expressing population in FACS (41.3% of the total population), although not all of these cells interacted with significant quantities of CPMV. The apparent CPMV binding of a few cells expressing surface vimentin at low levels was attributed to background staining ( Figure S5 ).",

It had previously been suggested that vimentin is expressed on the lumenal surface of vascular endothelial cells, in particular by identification of the endothelial-specific PAL-E antibody (although the specificity of this antibody for vimentin is controversial) [31] . Because the expression of murine vimentin is not efficiently recognized by the V9 mAb, we used rats for our studies to co-localize vimentin and CPMV in vivo. In order to focus on surface vimentin displayed on the lumenal surface of vascular endothelium rather than cytosolic vimentin, cylindershaped rat aorta segments were excised, and prior to sectioning were incubated with CPMV-A555 or V9 mAb, washed, and then embedded in OCT medium and 10 mm cryosections prepared. The sections were then stained with a secondary anti-mouse antibody. The expression of vimentin was observed on the lumenal surface of aortic endothelium, and co-localized with CPMV binding ( Figure 4F -J, and Figure S7 ). The colocalization of CPMV and vimentin in vessels correlated with the observed vascular endothelial uptake of CPMV in vivo ( Figure S6 and [13] ). Specificity of the staining procedure was also confirmed ( Figure  S8 ). There was no CPMV colocalization outside of the endothelial cell marker ( Figure S6 ), or outside the surface vimentin expressing cells ( Figure 4F -J). Taken together, the CPMV colocalization with vascular endothelium, the CPMV interaction with living vasculature shown previously through intravital imaging [13] , and our current results indicating that surface vimentin facilitates this interaction, illustrates that endothelial cell targeting of CPMV is mediated via vimentin.",

These results demonstrate that CPMV is a useful nanoparticle probe for examining the expression of surface vimentin on endothelial cells and circulating cells in vivo. The ability of CPMV to efficiently visualize tumor neovasculature and differentiate arterial from venous tissues [13] may now be attributed to upregulation of surface vimentin. Upregulation of cytosolic vimentin has long been associated with tumor progression and metastasis during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [39] , however our findings suggest that increased surface vimentin is also a key feature of tumor endothelium as evident by ability of CPMV to preferentially image these areas [13] and may signal a role for surface vimentin in tumor metastasis or invasion, in addition to cellular adhesion and stress. The use of CPMV as a natural endothelial probe may also extend into the investigation of other vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. Finally, the CPMVvimentin interaction may provide a tool for understanding the display and internalization of surface-expressed vimentin, the mechanism and function of which is currently unknown.",

Coupled with our findings, this further strengthens the link between animal and plant picornaviruses not only structurally and genetically, but with regard to attachment mechanisms as well. The original characterization of CPMV bioavailability was performed following oral administration of virus or infected leaves, whereby virus was subsequently found in the blood circulation [16] . The stability of CPMV in the gastrointestinal tract and its subsequent systemic biodistribution provides an opportunity for interactions between CPMV and mammalian cells following ingestion [16] . While there is no evidence for CPMV replication in mammalian or avian cells, the conserved interaction with vimentin, coupled with the conserved capsid structures of the plant, insect and animal picornaviruses, supports the hypothesis that the picornavirus superfamily of viruses evolved from a common ancestor.
