While local infection often remains asymptomatic, severe or even fatal diseases occur when streptococci become invasive and spread to different sites in the infected host. We have established porcine respiratory air-liquid interface cultures (ALI) from the porcine lung to analyze the interaction of streptococci with their primary target cells. As representative of the streptococcal family we chose Streptococcus suis (S. suis) that is not only a major swine respiratory pathogen but can also infect humans. Suilysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC), is an important virulence factor. By comparing a S. suis wt strain with a suilysin-deficient mutant, we demonstrate that suilysin contributes to (i) adherence to airway cells (ii) loss of ciliated cells (iii) apoptosis, and (iv) invasion. Furthermore, we show that cytolytic activity of suilysin is crucial for these effects. A striking result of our analysis was the high efficiency of S. suis-induced apoptosis and invasion upon infection under ALI conditions. These properties have been reported to be less efficient when analyzed with immortalized cells. We hypothesize that soluble effectors such as suilysin are present at higher concentrations in cells kept at ALI conditions and thus more effective. These results should be relevant also for infection of the respiratory tract by other respiratory pathogens.",

Streptococci are important pathogens that may initiate respiratory tract infections 2 . They comprise a number of diverse members infecting humans and/or animals 3-5 . In general, they have evolved effective mechanisms to adhere to and colonize different mucosal surfaces 6,7 . Adherence to surface-exposed host structures often results only in asymptomatic infections 6, 8, 9 . Severe diseases occur when streptococci succeed to invade the deeper host tissues 10,11 . Disease symptoms may range from pharyngitis, scarlet fever, and toxic shock syndrome caused by S. pyogenes, also referred to as group A streptococci. Further manifestations are peumonia, meningitis, or sepsis caused by S. agalactiae (group B streptococci) and S. pneumoniae (pneumococci) [11] [12] [13] [14] . Additionally, animal streptococci may have a zoonotic potential and induce disease not only in their host but also in humans. Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a major cause of meningitis, sepsis, arthritis and pneumonia in piglets with a worldwide distribution 3,15 . Moreover, it can cause severe infections to people that are in close contact with infected pigs. Two outbreaks of severe human infections by S. suis have occurred in China and affected several hundred persons in 1998 and 2005. The mortality rate was 56% and 18.6%, respectively 10,16 . In Vietnam, S. suis infections have been reported to be the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults 17 . In Thailand, S. suis also is considered as an emerging human pathogen 18 . Most cases of animal and human S. suis infections were caused by serotype 2 strains and some cases have been attributed to serotype 14 18-20 . Nevertheless, it has been only poorly studied which virulence factors of S. suis contribute to the early stages of infection, i.e. adherence to and colonization of mucosal surfaces or to crossing the mucosal epithelia to generate systemic disease.",

The well-differentiated airway epithelium is composed of different types of cells, such as mucus-producing (goblet) cells, basal cells, ciliated and non-ciliated cells.

When the cell monolayer had reached confluence, the medium was removed from the apical compartment and -under these ALI conditions -the cells started to differentiate. PTEC and PBEC were maintained at ALI conditions for at least 5 weeks. The presence of cilia, which is considered as an indicator of the extent of differentiation, was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1A,B) . Interestingly, cilia expression (in red) was more pronounced on PBEC (Fig. 1B) in comparison to PTEC (Fig. 1A) . Immature short cilia were first observed on cells at the border of the filter supports of cultures maintained for 7 days under ALI conditions (data not shown). The amount of cilia further increased until week 7 of cultivation. During the differentiation process, the monolayer adopted the appearance of a pseudostratified epithelium. Mucin production (in green) was demonstrated by mucin-5 AC staining after 5 weeks of culture under ALI conditions in both PTEC (Fig. 1A) and PBEC (Fig. 1B) . Moreover, the presence of tight junctions was demonstrated by a positive staining for occludin (Fig. 1C,D) , reflecting morphological stability and barrier function of PTEC and PBEC. As shown in Fig. 1E , scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed mature cilia at a high percentage of the epithelial surface of well-differentiated PBEC 7 weeks after cultivation under ALI conditions. A peak value of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) at 6 days of culture under ALI conditions indicated that PTEC and PBEC had adopted a polarized organization (Fig. 1F ). Afterwards TEER values decreased to some extent, but remained constant over the remaining observation period of 40 days. Taken together, we established well-differentiated porcine airway epithelial cells under ALI conditions in vitro, which closely resemble the cells of the airway epithelium.",

The strains were generated by complementation of strain 10\u0394 sly with either of two point-mutated suilysin genes, designated strain cS148, and strain cW461F, respectively. We included those strains to confirm possible effects of suilysin by complementation (strain cS148) and to elucidate whether effects might require cytolyctic activity of the toxin or not (strain cW416F).

LDH release induced by the wt strain at 4 hpi in PBEC (4-fold increase) was similar to that in PTEC (3-fold), but at 48 hpi it was significantly higher in PBEC (7.3 fold) than in PTEC (2.3 fold). To elucidate whether cytotoxic effects would also influence integrity of the cellular barrier, we determined the TEER of PTEC and PBEC, which is indicative of the formation of tight junctions and an intact epithelial barrier 23 . Results revealed that mock-infected PTEC and PBEC remained unaffected until end of the experiment (96 hpi). In comparison, TEER of PTEC and PBEC infected with the wt strain showed a significant decrease starting at 72 hpi and 48 hpi, respectively, whereas that of PTEC/PBEC infected by either of the two suilysin-deficient mutants was similar to the control ( Figure S2 ).",

The ability of S. suis to adhere to and colonize well-differentiated epithelial cells was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy at 4 hpi. PBEC were apically infected with 1 \u00d7 10 7 CFU of S. suis per filter. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h, cells were washed thoroughly to remove non-adherent bacteria and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. As shown in Fig. 3A , immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that streptococci were able to adhere to PBEC. Bound bacteria were mainly detected on ciliated cells. As shown in Fig. 3F , quantification of adherent bacteria revealed that suilysin-positive S. suis wt strain adhered to PBEC (0.16%) with significantly higher efficiency than the suilysin-deficient mutant 10\u0394 sly (0.075%), respectively. The number of adherent wt bacteria was 2-fold higher than that of 10\u0394 sly on PBEC cells. This result is consistent with a previous report that suilysin promotes the adherence of S. suis to the immortalized respiratory epithelial cell line HEp-2 and porcine ex vivo precision-cut lung slices 37, 39 . Interestingly, adherence of the two complemented strains cW461F and cS148, respectively, was similar to that of the wt and significantly higher than that of the suilysin-deficient mutant 10\u0394 sly. These results suggest that macropore-formation of suilysin was not involved in promotion of S. suis adherence to PBEC. On the other hand, it has been reported that nonencapsulated S. suis strain showed higher capacity of adherence to and invasion of host cells in comparison to the parental strain 42, 43 . Therefore, we also included a suilysin-deficient nonencapsulated mutant (10\u0394 cps\u0394 sly). As shown in Fig. 3A , lack of a capsule enhanced the adherence of the suilysin-deficient mutant to PBEC. Quantification of microscopic examinations confirmed significantly higher adherence of the nonencapsulated mutant 10\u0394 cps\u0394 sly as compared to the encapsulated wt and the mutant 10\u0394 sly (Fig. 3F) . These results indicate that suilysin and the capsule can both affect the adherence of S. suis to well-differentiated epithelial cells. Suilysin shows an enhancing effect on S. suis adherence to airway epithelial cells, which is independent of macropore-formation, whereas the capsule has a reducing effect.

The clear difference between wt and mutant S. suis was also found in the invasion of PTEC, for which the rate of intracellular wt bacteria was 28% (data not shown). We conclude that suilysin is crucial for efficient invasion of S. suis into airway epithelial cells, and that cytolytic activity of suilysin contributes significantly to this effect, since strain cW461F was significantly less invasive than wt strain and strain cS148.

In these experiments the suilysin-positive wt strain and the complemented strain cS148 induced damage to the PBEC resulting in the loss of a large proportion of ciliated cells at 48hpi (Fig. 5A ). Vertical sections of these samples illustrate that the loss of the ciliated cells enables the wt and cS148 bacteria to invade to deeper areas of the cell layer (Fig. 5B) . Strain cW461F was able to invade PBEC to a certain extent and caused only moderate local lesions at 48 hpi. In striking contrast, the suilysin-deficient mutants 10\u0394 sly and 10\u0394 cps\u0394 sly remained adherent to ciliated cells and were unable to cross this barrier. This effect was more pronounced at 96 hpi ( Fig. 5C ), when just a few cilia were detectable and invasive S. suis wt even reached the basal area of the epithelial cell layer. Similar results were obtained with strain cS148, i. e. many bacteria crossed the epithelial barrier. Accordingly, despite large numbers of adherent bacteria at 96 hpi, the suilysin-deficient nonencapsulated mutant 10\u0394 cps\u0394 sly was unable to invade the ciliated epithelium. Interestingly, infection of PBEC by the point-mutated suilysin cW461F for 96h revealed many intracellular bacteria but hardly any damaged ciliated epithelial cells or bacteria invading deeper areas (Fig. 5) .",

High density of membrane-associated suilysin was detectable on apoptotic cells, which is consistent with the localization of suilysin-positive wt streptococci in invasion areas described above (Fig. 6A ). As expected, no suilysin and only few cleaved caspase-3 positive cells were detected in PBEC infected by the suilysin-deficient mutant 10\u0394 sly. Interestingly, accumulated membrane-associated suilysin was detected in the complemented strain cW461F infected PBEC, but this accumulated suilysin did not induce increased apoptotic cells (as shown in Fig. 6C ). Quantification of apoptotic cells revealed that suilysin-positive S. suis wt strain and complemented strain cS148 induced a 40-fold and 35-fold increase of apoptotic cells compared to mock infection of PBEC, respectively. Increases were significantly higher than those caused by the suilysin-deficient mutant 10\u0394 sly (5-fold) and complemented strain cW461F (8-fold).

PCLS are maintained in culture medium, whereas ALI cultures acquire their nutrients from the medium only via the basolateral membrane, and the apical side of the cells has contact to air. In this respect the ALI system most closely resembles the situation of the airway epithelial cells in their respective host.

However, we cannot directly compare invasiveness of S. suis in both culture systems, since quantification was done by different methods due to the models applied in the present and the previous study. Because of the very low invasion of immortalized cells, encapsulated S. suis is considered as an extracellular bacterium 31, 39, 42 . It has been suggested that invasion by this streptococcus requires the down-regulation of the capsule to achieve efficient adherence and subsequent invasion. Following invasion, the capsule would have to be upregulated again to ensure bacterial survival in the blood stream. However, this has never been demonstrated in vivo. Our data show that encapsulated S. suis is very efficient in invasion suggesting that differential expression of the capsule may not be essential for efficient invasion.",

As suilysin is a soluble protein, the high efficiency of this process in the case of ALI cultures can be explained by the higher local concentration of this protein in the absence of apical medium. In the case of immortalized cells, suilysin produced by S. suis is immediately diluted by the medium and, thus, a homogeneous and low concentration of the protein is available for interaction with the cell surface. By contrast, suilyin released from S. suis to the apical side of airway epithelial cells in ALI cultures will not be diluted by the culture medium and, thus, can accumulate and be active on the site where it is released from the bacteria.",

It results in the loss of their barrier function and allows the bacteria to get access to deeper areas of the epithelium that are usually not exposed to the environment. This conclusion is supported by our infection studies with PCLS, another culture system for differentiated airway epithelial cells 37 . It has been suggested that dead cells may provide a rich source of nutrition and growth factors and thus enhance streptococcal growth 48 . We found larger numbers of bacteria in areas where the epithelium had been damaged. Interestingly, the infection with the complemented strain cW461F, which could only express subcytolytic toxin effects, revealed a high number of invasive bacteria in PBEC but only moderate damaging effects. These results demonstrate that macropore-formation acticity and subcytolytic effects of suilysin promote invasion of S. suis.",

Results of experiments with the complemented strain cW461F revealed that macropore-formation of suilysin is required for induction of apoptosis in airway epithelial cells. However, at present it remains unclear what the underlying mechanisms are. In S. pneumoniae a pneumolysin-induced calcium influx has been shown to mediate apoptosis in neuronal tissues 52, 53 . Thus, it is plausible to speculate that suilysin-induced apoptosis in airway epithelial cells may be initiated by calcium influx through the pores in the plasma membrane. Calcium influx induced by suilysin was observed in HEp-2 cells (unpublished data). Whether this can be translated to PBEC remains to be clarified in future studies.",

All incubation steps were performed at RT. All Infected cells were washed three times with PBS+ and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Formaldehyde-fixed preparations were washed and 0.1 M glycine in PBS was added for 5 min, after then samples were washed 3 times with PBS and followed by incubation in blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS to block nonspecific binding sites. All antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA in PBS. Blocking buffer was removed and preparations were incubated with rabbit anti-S. suis antiserum diluted 1:200 for 1h. After washed with PBS, samples were incubated for 45 min with green fluorescent anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488 anti-rabbit IgG (H+ L) antibody 1:1000 diluted (Life Technologies) to stain extracellular streptococci. Following, the preparations were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min. Then preparations were again incubated with the rabbit anti-S. suis antiserum 1:200 diluted for 1h, washed with PBS, then incubated with red fluorescent anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor \u00ae 568 anti-rabbit IgG (H+ L) antibody Scientific RepoRts | 6:26748 | DOI: 10.1038/srep26748 1:1000 diluted (Life Technologies)) for 45 min to stain intra-and extracellular bacteria.

Three areas were chosen randomly for each sample and all experiments were repeated three times. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of samples were performed using a TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a 63x/1.30 NA glycerin HC PL APO objective and a 63x/1.40 oil HCX PL APO objective (Leica). Image stacks with a z or y-distance of 0.5 \u03bc m per plane were acquired using 1 Airy unit pinhole diameter in sequential imaging mode to avoid bleed through. Maximum intensity projections were calculated for display purposes and adjusted for brightness and contrast using ImageJ/Fiji. FESEM studies of uninfected PBEC was performed as described previously 42 .",

For analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy, immunostaining was performed to visualize cilia (red) and streptococci (green). Nuclei were stained by DAPI (blue). Bars represent 25 \u03bc m in horizontal sections (A) and 50 \u03bc m (larger bar) or 5 \u03bc m (short bar) in vertical sections (B,C). Experiments were performed at least three times.
