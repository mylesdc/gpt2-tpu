The present study corrects the concept of the actual reproduction number, offering a simple framework for estimating R 0 without assuming exponential growth of cases. The proposed method is applied to the HIV epidemic in European countries, yielding R 0 values ranging from 3.60 to 3.74, consistent with those based on the Euler-Lotka equation. The method also permits calculating the expected value of R 0 using a spreadsheet.",

R 0 is the most widely used epidemiological measurement of the transmission potential in a given population. Statistical estimation of R 0 has been performed for various infectious diseases [2, 3] , aiming towards understanding the dynamics of transmission and evolution, and designing effective public health OPEN ACCESS intervention strategies. In particular, R 0 has been used for determining the minimum coverage of immunization, because the threshold condition to prevent a major epidemic in a randomly-mixing population is given by 1-1/R 0 [4] . In addition, R 0 gives an estimate of the so-called final size, i.e., the proportion of the population that will experience infection by the end of an epidemic [5, 6] .",

When one estimates R 0 using epidemic data of an emerging (or exotic) disease, the exponential growth rate, r, of infections during the initial phase of the epidemic is used [8, 9] . Assuming that the generation time, i.e., the time from infection of a primary case to infection of a secondary case generated by the primary case [10] , is known (or separately estimated from other empirical data), the growth rate r is transformed to R 0 using that knowledge (see below).

The relative frequency of secondary transmissions of HIV as a function of the time since infection. A step function is employed to approximately model the frequency of secondary transmissions relative to infection-age. For d 1 years shortly after infection, the frequency g 1 is very high. Subsequently, for d 2 years (i.e., during the asymptomatic period), g 2 is persistently low, followed by a time period with high infectiousness g 3 for d 3 years until death or no secondary transmission due to AIDS. Following a statistical study [20] , d 1 , R a coincides with R 0 as long as \uf062(\uf074) is constant. Nevertheless, in many instances, the contact frequency and infectiousness (which may be partly reflected, for example, in the viral load distribution of the infected host) vary as a function of infection-age \uf074. The variation in \uf062(\uf074) is particularly the case for HIV infection.

As has been known for some time [19] , the frequency of secondary transmissions is very high shortly after infection (for a duration d 1 = 0.24 years), followed by a long asymptomatic period with a low frequency of secondary transmissions (for d 2 = 8.38 years) [20] . Subsequently, the frequency rises sharply again resulting in a substantial number of secondary cases for a duration d 3 = 0.75 years until death or until the infected individual ceases risky sexual contact due to AIDS [20] [21] [22] . Assuming that the contact frequency does not vary as a function of infection-age, g 1 , g 2 and g 3 have been estimated at 1.30, 0.05 and 0.36 per year [20] . Here, g(\uf074) is the density function of the generation time, with a mean of 3.79 years.",

During the observation period, a total of 23,243, 13,126 and 11,491 AIDS cases were diagnosed in France, Western Germany and the UK, respectively. Although the time of HIV infection is not directly observable, the HIV incidence has been estimated by employing a back-calculation technique and using the AIDS incidence and the incubation period distribution of AIDS [23] . The present study does not discuss the details of back-calculation, but explanatory guides can be found elsewhere [24] [25] [26] . Figure 2B shows the enlarged HIV incidence curve during the initial phase of an epidemic. The peak incidence was observed in 1982 for Western Germany and 1983 for France and the UK. In the following, the time period from 1976 up to one year prior to the peak incidence is taken as the early growth phase.

Figure 3A shows a transmission tree, i.e., a representation of who infected whom, where each primary case on average generates two secondary cases. A transmission tree of this kind is usually unobserved unless rigorous contact-tracing with microbiological examination is implemented. Thus, a likelihood-based approach to reconstructing the tree is considered ( Figure 3B ) [29] [30] [31] . Given the total number of effective contacts that have equal potential for resulting in secondary transmission, the probability of a single effective contact resulting in a secondary transmission (or the probability that a secondary case is linked to an effective contact made by a single primary case in year t) is given by 1/R 0 . This is a simple binomial sampling process. In other words, the likelihood function for estimating R 0 is: (17) where T is the most recent time point of observation within an early (linear) epidemic growth stage. The maximum likelihood estimate of R 0 is obtained by minimizing the negative logarithm of (17) , and the 95% CI are derived from the profile likelihood. Table 1 shows the estimates of r and R 0 for HIV in France, Western Germany and the UK. The maximum likelihood estimates of r ranged from 1.15 to 2.15 per year with the smallest estimate in France and the highest in Western Germany. The 95% CI for Western Germany did not overlap with those of the other two countries, reflecting the steep rise in incidence in this region in Figure 2B . Based on the exponential growth assumption in (5), the estimate of R 0 ranged from 3.65-4.08. Again, Western Germany yielded the highest estimate without an overlap of the uncertainty bound with the other two countries. The maximum likelihood estimate of R 0 based on the proposed new method ranged from 3.59 to 3.74. Not only were the qualitative patterns for the expected values of R 0 consistent with those based on an exponential growth assumption, but the 95% CI also broadly overlapped with those based on the other method. In particular, although R 0 in Western Germany using the proposed method is smaller than that based on an exponential growth assumption, the 95% CIs of the two methods overlapped. The 95% CI based on the proposed method appeared to be wider than those based on exponential growth assumption. Since HIV is mainly transmitted via sexual contact, the above mentioned estimate may vary with the mixing pattern and contact frequency (thus, there is no general disease-specific R 0 , especially for HIV/AIDS). At least, compared with a previous estimate of R 0 as ranging from 13.9 to 54.5 in the USA, based on an exponential growth assumption that adopted a mean infectious period of 10 years [32] , R 0 in the present study appeared to be much smaller using a precise estimate of the generation time distribution.",

The previously available method using (5) forced us to adopt an exponential growth assumption, and moreover, an additional step towards the estimation of r (i.e., the translation of r to R 0 ) was required [9] . The proposed method does not necessarily require an exponential growth assumption and provides a \"short-cut\" to estimate R 0 from incidence data. The simple likelihood function employing a binomial distribution was also proposed to yield an appropriate uncertainty bound of R 0 . It should be noted that given the knowledge of g s and readily available incidence data, equation (15) permits calculation of the expected value of R 0 without likelihood. Such a calculation can be attained using any spreadsheet.",

However, it appears that R a does not precisely capture the secondary transmission if the transmission rate \uf062(\uf074) varies with infection-age \uf074 [18] , and moreover, the cohort-and period-reproduction numbers directly derived from the renewal equation have been suggested to be more accurate figures in capturing the underlying transmission dynamics [17, 33] . In the present study, replacing the denominator (i.e., prevalence) of R a by the total number of potential contacts, it was shown that the R 0 derived from the renewal equation coincides with the corrected actual reproduction number, R a , and also that the likelihood can be quite easily derived. The corrected R a does not require prevalence data, and uses only the incidence data and the generation time distribution.",

            "text": "Many future tasks remain, however. Most importantly, the estimation of R 0 from early epidemic growth data for a heterogeneously-mixing population is called for. R 0 in the present study can even be interpreted as R 0 for a heterogeneously-mixing population (i.e., the dominant eigenvalue of the nextgeneration matrix), provided that the early growth rate is the same among sub-populations (though it is not the case if the growth rate varies across sub-populations) [34, 35] . Analyzing heterogeneous transmission among approximately-aggregated discrete groups, the estimate of the next-generation matrix would give more detailed insights into the epidemic dynamics, including the most important target host for intervention [36] . As discussed in a modeling study in this special issue of the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health [37] , understanding the implications of sexual partnerships and their variations as a function of calendar time as well as infection-age is also of utmost importance. As the next step for a similar estimation framework, methods for estimating robust R 0 and the next-generation matrix from structured data (i.e., data stratified by age-and/or risk-groups) will be useful. Despite the future challenges, I believe the present study at least satisfies a need to offer a likelihood-based approach to estimate R 0 from early epidemic growth data, while being easily tractable and calculable among general epidemiologists.",
