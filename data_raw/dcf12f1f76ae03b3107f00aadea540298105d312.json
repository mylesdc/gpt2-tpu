This study attempted to quantify the effect of such changes on the risk of infection in different settings, i.e., the community and hospitals. The 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong, where 27% of cases were healthcare workers, was used as an example. A stochastic compartmental SEIR (susceptibleexposed-infectious-removed) model was used: the population was split into healthcare workers, hospitalized people and general population. Super spreading events (SSEs) were taken into account in the model. The temporal evolutions of the daily effective contact rates in the community and hospitals were modeled with smooth functions. Data augmentation techniques and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were applied to estimate SARS epidemiological parameters. In particular, estimates of daily reproduction numbers were provided for each subpopulation. The average duration of the SARS infectious period was estimated to be 9.3 days (60.3 days). The model was able to disentangle the impact of the two SSEs from background transmission rates. The effective contact rates, which were estimated on a daily basis, decreased with time, reaching zero inside hospitals. This observation suggests that public health measures and possible changes in individual behaviors effectively reduced transmission, especially in hospitals. The temporal patterns of reproduction numbers were similar for healthcare workers and the general population, indicating that on average, an infectious healthcare worker did not infect more people than any other infectious person. We provide a general method to estimate time dependence of parameters in structured epidemic models, which enables investigation of the impact of control measures and behavioral changes in different settings.",

The outbreak also demonstrated the possible existence of super-spreading events (SSEs) [10] , during which a few infectious individuals contaminated a high number of secondary cases. Hong Kong had two SSEs: the first occurred in Hospital X around March 3 and led to about 125 cases [11] ; the second occurred in Housing Estate Y on March 19 , and led to over 300 cases [12, 13] .

Better means of protection require understanding how healthcare workers were infected and assessing their role in disease transmission. Here, we describe a method for estimating the temporal profile of the risk of infection and probability of transmission in the community and hospitals. The 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong is used as an example. For the SARS epidemic, we show that the risk of infection in the community and hospitals decreased with time down to zero in hospitals but remained larger in the community. This observation suggests that public health measures and behavioural changes most effectively reduced transmission in hospitals. Besides, we find that the large number of cases observed among healthcare workers is more likely a result of large and sustained exposure to hospitalized cases than to transmission among healthcare workers. These results are of interest to design control measures in the event of an influenza pandemic. general population. In particular, susceptible individuals in the general population (S gp compartment) cannot be infected by infectious hospitalized SARS cases (H gp , H hw , and H hp compartments), and susceptible hospitalized patients (S hp compartment) cannot be infected by infectious not-yet-hospitalized cases from the general population (I gp compartment).",

These dynamics are conveniently summarized by critical, albeit non-observable, characteristics, such as the duration of the infectious period and effective contact rates. Estimation of these parameters from the observed data requires the development of mathematical models. Herein, we presented a model for epidemics that provides for social heterogeneity and time variability of transmission parameters. As a working example, the model was applied to the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. The effect of interventions and/or changes in behavior during the 2003 SARS outbreak may be modelled as time varying contact rates [12, 15, 25] or involve shortening of the infectious period [19] . Here, we adopted the first view. To assess if the data supported this choice, a model was fit where, in addition to time varying contact rates, we allowed the mean infectious period to change over three consecutive periods. The three posterior means were 9.5 days (before March 20), 9.2 (March 21 to April 9) and 10 days (after April 10), indicating that the time varying contact rates alone model the data adequately.",

While the daily effective contact rates are sensitive to short-term day-to-day variations in transmission, the reproduction numbers reflect the integrated influences of the temporal evolution of effective contact rates, the infectious period duration and other factors, such as time spent in the community before hospitalization. Here, estimates of daily reproduction numbers were obtained for each social category. Notably, unlike Cauchemez et al. [14] , it was not necessary to assume prior knowledge or constancy of the generation interval. The reproduction numbers showed a trend similar to the effective contact rates, with a clearly decreasing trend over time, suggesting that the epidemic was under control as early as mid-March (see Figure in Text S3). Moreover, the temporal patterns for the general population and healthcare workers were similar, with the reproduction numbers being higher for the general population, thereby indicating that on average, an infectious healthcare worker did not infect more people than any other infectious person. The reproduction numbers for nosocomial cases were much lower, either because they had fewer contacts or because the people they were in contact with were protected (typically healthcare workers wearing masks).",

The number of people affected by each SSE (i.e. population6duration6strength) was therefore correct, but its extent in time less robust.

Similarly, a more detailed model taking into account household transmission, and transmission inside and between hospitals, rather than assuming homogeneous mixing in the community and in hospitals, could be implemented, at the cost of a dramatic increase in the number of model parameters. More generally, the model can be easily accommodated to fit the specificities of any transmissible disease.",
