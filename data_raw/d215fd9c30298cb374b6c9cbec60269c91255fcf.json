In China, Weibo is an extremely popular microblogging site that is equivalent to Twitter. Capitalizing on the wealth of public opinion data contained in posts on Weibo, this study used Weibo as a measure of the Chinese people's reactions to two different outbreaks: the 2012 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak, and the 2013 outbreak of human infection of avian influenza A(H7N9) in China. Methods: Keyword searches were performed in Weibo data collected by The University of Hong Kong's Weiboscope project. Baseline values were determined for each keyword and reaction values per million posts in the days after outbreak information was released to the public. Results: The results show that the Chinese people reacted significantly to both outbreaks online, where their social media reaction was two orders of magnitude stronger to the H7N9 influenza outbreak that happened in China than the MERS-CoV outbreak that was far away from China. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that social media could be a useful measure of public awareness and reaction to disease outbreak information released by health authorities.",

The project's primary aim is to develop a data collection and visualization system for better understanding of Weibo in China. Details of the methodology have been reported elsewhere [16] . In summary, the project generated a list of about 350,000 indexed microbloggers by searching the Sina Weibo user database systematically using the Application Programming Interface (API) functions provided by Sina Weibo. The inclusion criterion was those users who have at least 1,000 followers. We used high-follower-count samples for two reasons: first, in social media, high-followercount users are relatively more influential and can often draw disproportionally larger public attention [23] . Second, this sampling strategy can minimize the influence of spam accounts, which were found widespread in China's social media [24] . Because of the heightened restriction on Sina Weibo API access, the microbloggers included in the data acquisition since January 2013 were restricted to a selective group of around 50,000 \"opinion leaders\" with at least 10,000 followers. This group of microbloggers was selected for analysis in the current study in order to have fair comparison between the keyword frequencies in 2012 and 2013.",

Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, SAS 9.3 Base and R 2.15.3. We first established the baseline for each keyword and then measured the online response (both magnitude and time to peak) compared to the baseline. We normalized the number of posts with a particular keyword on a given day by dividing it by the total number of posts in our sample for that day, and then multiplying it by 1,000,000 to obtain the number of tweets with a particular keyword per 1 million tweets. The 2012 data (January 3 -December 30) was used to establish the baseline data for Weibo posts with keywords \"avian flu\" and \"H7N9\". Likewise, part of the 2012 data, prior to September 23, 2012, was used to establish the baseline for the keywords that were related to MERS-CoV. We chose 2012 as the baseline year, assuming that the underlying Weibo conversations about health-related information were not significantly different between 2012 and 2013. One-sample t-test (twosided) was used to measure the statistical significance of the difference between the peaks and their corresponding baseline values.",

We found that the reaction to the H7N9 outbreak in 2013 was about two orders of magnitude stronger than the one to the MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012. The results confirmed our hypothesis that the Chinese online community reacted more strongly to an outbreak that was in China than one outside China. The reaction in the Chinese online community exploded within the first five days of the first case report of three human cases (two in Shanghai and one in Anhui) of avian influenza A(H7N9) [22] . Within these five days, more cases were identified in Shanghai and in two neighboring provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, attention soon declined rapidly. It declined until April 13, 2013, when the Chinese government announced that a child was found H7N9-positive in Beijing, the capital of China. This piece of news triggered a second explosion of online discussion via Weibo on that day. Attention then declined rapidly again (Figure 2) .",

As a keyword, \"\u975e\u5178\" (Feidian) was sensitive to rumors of SARS in the city of Baoding, China, on February 19, 2012.

This keyword, however, also led to a \"false positive\". On July 21, 2012, there was a severe flood in Beijing, resulting in dozens of deaths. The Chinese online community complained about the Beijing municipal government's disaster management. The government reacted by holding a press conference on July 24, saying that they had learned the lessons of SARS in 2003 and did not conceal the true death toll [28] . This incident also led to a peak in posts with the keyword \"\u975e\u5178\" (Feidian) (Figure 3b ).

These results again confirmed our hypothesis that the Chinese online community reacted more strongly to an outbreak that happened in China than one outside China. Drawing on the social amplification of risk model [31] , public risk perception is shaped by a process of interplays between psychological, cultural, social, and institutional factors that may result in amplifying or attenuating the public attention to risk. Mass communication is among the list of factors. Public health officials have long recognised the role of the mass media in disseminating risk and emergency information before, during, and after a catastrophe [32] . The World Health Organization establishes guidelines for \"effective media communication\", through which the authorities are able to disseminate information to the public [33] . Communication during crisis was traditionally understood to be a one-way and top-down process, in which the public are assumed to be \"deficient\" in knowledge, while the scientists, public health experts, and emergency managers, are \"sufficient\" [34] . But this presumption was profoundly challenged by the emergence of social media. For instance, Leung and Nicoll argued that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was the first pandemic in which social media \"challenged conventional public health communication\" [35] . In China, online messages were published ahead of the official statement in the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake [36] . Social media enabled people under crisis to share information and experience and to seek message credibility and confirmation via multiple media platforms and social networks [34] . Our study demonstrated that official data released by health authorities, whether in Beijing or Geneva, received strong reactions in the Chinese online community. With such knowledge, social media should be incorporated in the best practices for risk and crisis communication [37] . Social media data can also provide health authorities, researchers and the media a quantifiable measure of public attention towards a particular disease outbreak [11] .",

First, we can study how information about a given disease spread across the social network as represented by Weibo. Kwak et al. [40] identified a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter and low reciprocity in Twitter follower-following topology, which was different from most human social networks. Over 85% of the top trending topics on Twitter are headline news or persistent news. Once retweeted, a tweet would reach an average of 1,000 users regardless of original tweet's number of followers [40] . However, a previous study has found that Chinese Weibo exhibits a distinct pattern of information dissemination [41] . For example, the network connections between Chinese microbloggers are markedly hierarchical than those between Twitter users, i.e. Chinese users tend to follow those at a higher or similar social level [42] ; majority of Weibo posts are indeed re-posts that are originated from a small percentage of original messages [24] . It will be very interesting if further research can shed light upon how information sharing over Weibo can affect human response to the diseases off-line.",

Despite the fact that these microbloggers are more likely to be authentic users rather than spam accounts, the samples constitute less than 0.1% of the overall microblogger population [23] . However, a random sampling study finds that Weibo content contribution is unevenly distributed among users [23] . Over half of Sina Weibo subscribers have never posted, whereas about 5% of Weibo users contributed more than 80% of the original posts [23] . Hence, the sampled microbloggers in our study were the most influential microbloggers who contributed a majority of Weibo posts and drew the most attention in terms of the number of reposts and comments [23] . Therefore, for the purpose of this study, this group of highfollower-count microbloggers should be deemed fairly representative of the public attention towards the MERS-CoV and H7N9 outbreaks. But the reader should note that the findings of our study might not be generalizable to the samples collected by other sampling strategies. The operational parameters of sampling were not determined to optimize collection of data specific to a given disease. Future research is warranted to reconfirm the research findings by using a research design that is customized for specific epidemiologic research purposes.",
