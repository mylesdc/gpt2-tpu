Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis demonstrated that MERS-CoV M pro undergoes a monomer to dimer conversion in the presence of a peptide substrate. Glu169 is a key residue and plays a dual role in both dimerization and catalysis. The mutagenesis of other residues found on the dimerization interface indicate that dimerization of MERS-CoV M pro is required for its catalytic activity. One mutation, M298R, resulted in a stable dimer with a higher level of proteolytic activity than the wild-type enzyme.",

After centrifuging at 6,000 x g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min, the cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 250 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) and then lysed by sonication. The crude extract was then centrifuged at 12,000 x g at 4\u00b0C for 25 min to remove the insoluble pellet. Next the supernatant was incubated with 1-ml Ni-NTA beads at 4\u00b0C for 1 h and then loaded onto an empty column. After allowing the supernatant to flow through, the beads were washed with washing buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 250 mM NaCl, 8 mM imidazole, and 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol). The SARS-CoV papain-like protease [12] (1 mg in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5)) was then added and incubated for 3 h. The SARS-CoV papain-like protease digestion, which removed the 6 x His tag and Leu-Arg-Leu-Lys-Gly-Gly fragment, resulted in a native protein product with an authentic N-terminus. The digest was allowed to flow through and then loaded onto a S-100 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with running buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 2 mM dithiothreitol). The purity of the fractions collected was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the protein was concentrated to 30 mg/ml by Amicon Ultra-4 10-kDa centrifugal filter (Millipore).",

This substrate is cleaved at the Gln-pNA bond to release free pNA, resulting in an increase in absorbance at 405 nm. The absorbance at 405 nm was continuously monitored using a Jasco V-550 UV/VIS spectrophotometer. The protease activity assay was performed in 10 mM phosphate (pH 7.6) at 30\u00b0C.

Then 330 \u03bcl of peptide substrate at 0, 200 and 400 \u03bcM in D 2 O were respectively loaded into the bulk sample sector space. At a rotor speed of 42,000 rpm, the protein solution flowed into the substrate-containing channel and form a protein band. It can be detected by absorbance at 250 nm. During the centrifugation, the sediment protein continuously met and cleaved the substrate, which can be detected by absorbance change at 405 nm. The dataset from the multiple scans at 250 nm at various time intervals were fitted to a continuous c(s) distribution model using the SEDFIT program [31] , while the first five scans (0-30 min) at 405 nm were used to derive the product concentration and then initial velocity values.",

Instead, the bacteria are able to express the M pro when there is a N-terminal 6 x His-tag fusion that can be removed during the purification. However, thrombin digestion leaves two extra residues (Gly-Ser) at the N-terminus of M pro , resulting in protein with no proteolytic activity (data not shown). Therefore we used SARS-CoV papain-like protease [12, 30, 34] , which is a highly active viral deubiquitinase and does not leave any residues at the N-terminus of M pro . After gel-filtration, the purity of authentic N-terminus M pro was about 99% (S2 Fig). The size of the MERS-CoV M pro was found to be close to 30 kDa, while any uncut protein was located at higher molecular weight position. The typical yield was about 10 mg after purification from 0.8 liter of E. coli culture.",

Indeed, the r.m.s. distance between equivalent C\u03b1 atoms of the domain I+II of the two structures is 0.9 \u00c5, while that between the domain III of the two structures is 3.1 \u00c5. Compared with the structures of the ligand-bound complex (PDB entry 4YLU) and C148A mutant (PDB entry 4WME) [14, 15] , the r. m. s. distance is 0.8 and 0.7 \u00c5 over 540 C\u03b1 atom pairs, respectively (S3B Fig) . This indicates that the dimeric structures show no significant difference; although the present structure is a free enzyme and the other two structures involve enzyme-ligand complexes and higher resolution. Besides, there is minor difference between the present structure and bat-CoV HKU4 M pro (PDB entry 2YNA), with 80% sequence identity, as the r. m. s. distance over 539 C\u03b1 atom pairs is 0.8 \u00c5 (S3B Fig). Interestingly, the dimerization interface situation with the MERS-CoV M pro was found to be different to that of SARS-CoV M pro where there are four amino acid pairs with intermolecular polar interactions (Ser1. . .Glu166, Arg4. . .Glu290, Ser123. . .Arg298 and Ser139. . .Gln299). There are only two pairs of intermolecular hydrogen bonds, Ser1. . .Glu169 and Ser142. . .Gln299 that are associated with the dimer surface of MERS-CoV M pro according to the current structure ( Fig 1B) . This led us to compare the dimerization and catalytic activity of the two types of M pro . In the present study, in addition to using the wild-type MERS-CoV M pro , we also mutated several residues at the dimerization interface in order to evaluate their role in dimerization and catalysis of MERS-CoV M pro (see below).",

It is unable to confirm that our observation is a substrate-induced or substrate/product-induced dimerization. To solve this, a modified AUC technique, AEC [33] , was utilized to detect the quaternary structure change in the absence and presence of substrate (Fig 4) . Here the enzyme solution was put into the small well of band-forming centerpiece and then flowed into the substratecontaining channel when the centrifugation began. During the centrifugation, the protein layer gradually sediment and continuously met peptide substrates. Not surprisingly, there was a broad distribution between the monomer and dimer species in the presence of 200 \u03bcM peptide substrate, while a major species shifted to the dimer in 400 \u03bcM substrate (Fig 4B) . It suggests that MERS-CoV M pro acts as a rapid self-associated and substrate-induced dimerization. Using different strategies, Tomar et al. [14] confirmed that inhibitor binding can also induce and maintain the dimerization of M pro . On the other hand, we measured the velocity of the product formation during the centrifugation; although the rate (0.017 \u03bcM/s) is 10-fold lower than that by the spectrometric assay (Fig 4B) . The values were derived from a global fit of the AUC data to a monomer-dimer self-association model by SEDPHAT [32] . The experiments for the assay were obtained at protein concentration of 1.5 to 30 \u03bcM. c The value was from our previous studies for comparison [28] .",

The analysis indicated that the K d value of MERS-CoV M pro in the absence of substrate was 7.7 \u03bcM and this decreased 11-fold in the presence of substrate, which brings it close to the value for SARS-CoV M pro (1.7 \u03bcM; Table 2 ). Thus it can be concluded that, like the SARS-CoV M pro R298A mutant [25] , the presence of substrate is able to induce the dimerization of MERS-CoV M pro .

Here the equivalent residue, Glu169, was mutated and its influence on MERS-CoV M pro evaluated ( Fig 1B) . Not surprisingly, compared to the wild-type enzyme, the activity (k cat ) of E169A showed a 6-fold decrease (Fig 2B, open diamonds and Table 2 ). Furthermore, AUC analysis suggested that this enzyme consisted of a single species close to monomeric form even in the presence of substrate (Fig 3E) . The K d values of the E169A mutant without substrate was 14 \u03bcM, which is 2-fold higher than that of the wild-type and this did not decrease in the presence of substrate ( Table 2 ). The results suggest that mutation of Glu169 is able to block substrate-induced dimerization and that this results in a decrease in enzyme activity. Unexpectedly, as well as the monomer, some octamer (6.3%) with a sedimentation coefficient of 4.9 S was observed in the presence of substrate (Fig 3E) . Previous studies have suggested that a super-active octamer of SARS-CoV M pro can be locked by 3D domain swapping [35] . In this study, the presence of the octamer form of the MERS-CoV M pro E169A mutant in the presence of substrate may explain why this mutant is not totally inactive. Taking the above as a whole, the dual role of the conserved Glu residue in catalysis and dimerization is consistent for both M pro .",

Based on the sequence alignment, three residues in the dimerization interface vary in coronaviral M pro sequences (S1 Fig). In SARS-CoV M pro , residues Arg4, Ser123 and Arg298 are different to the equivalent ones in MERS-CoV M pro , which are Val4, Thr126 and Met298, respectively. Based on the above, three single mutants, V4R, T126S and M298R, were generated and their proteolytic activity and dimerization were assessed. Unexpectedly, both the V4R and the T126S mutant showed a higher K d for the dimer to monomer and a lower level of activity than wild-type M pro (Fig 2B and Table 2 ). K d values were decreased by 1.5-fold to 2.4-fold for the two mutants in the presence of substrate, which suggests reduced substrate-induced dimerization (Fig 3C and 3D) . Based on the current structure, residue Val4 showed a hydrophobic contact with another protomer's residue Gly141 (Fig 1B) . Mutation of valine to arginine may lose the contact. Furthermore, the side chain of residue Val131 of MERS-CoV M pro is hydrophobic while that of the equivalent residue, Cys128 of SARS-CoV M pro , is hydrophilic (Fig 1B) . Val131 is close to the Arg4 and will disfavor the electrostatic interaction of Arg4. . .Glu290 in MERS-CoV M pro . These variance may result in V4R failed to form a stable dimer. For the T126S mutant, after compared with the other two MERS-CoV M pro structures (PDB entry 4YLU and 4WME), we found that the side chain of Thr126 is free of rotation. It is able to make a hydrophobic interaction with the residue Tyr121, resulting in a 180\u00b0-rotation of the phenol ring, and lead to a hydrogen-bond with the backbone amide of Leu144 (Fig 1B) . It further results in the side chain of Leu144 toward another protomer's Ile300 and make a hydrophobic contact for the two protomers. Mutation of Thr126 to serine will lose this contact and may disfavor the dimerization.",

Furthermore, the stable dimer form showed higher proteolytic activity and the mutation transformed the enzymes rate constant pattern at various substrate concentrations into a classical saturation curve (Fig 2C, open triangles) . In addition, the K m of the M298R mutant is 5.8-fold lower than that of SARS-CoV M pro , which suggests a higher substrate binding affinity ( Table 2 ). It can be concluded that mutation of residue Met298 to arginine within the MERS-CoV M pro results in the stabilization of the dimer formation, which in turn gives rise to more efficient catalysis. Based on our structure, Arg298 is able to make a hydrogen bonding interaction with Thr126. Residue Thr126 can be replaced by serine because the T126S/M298R double mutant also shows similar dimerization characteristics ( Fig 3G) and saturated catalytic pattern to that of the M298R mutant (Fig 2C, open hexagons and Table 2 ).

To further delineate the binding of substrate to the enzyme, ITC was used to measure the K d for the substrate (or substrate/product)-enzyme complex and the binding stoichiometry (N) (Fig 5) . During the titration, the enzymatic hydrolysis might produce additional heat, resulting in higher \u0394H. So we can only compared the N and K d of the wild-type M pro with those of E169A and M298R mutants. The three enzymes exhibited similar N (0.89 to 1.06) and K d (14.2 to 20.3 \u03bcM) . This suggested that the monomeric and dimeric M pro show quite the same substrate binding affinity. Such phenomenon is also found in monomeric and dimeric SARS-CoV M pro , whose N and K d for the same substrate were 0.97 to 1.05 and 29.9 to 33.8 \u03bcM, respectively [28] . With the K m ((k -1 +k cat )/k 1 ), k cat and K d (k -1 /k 1 ), we are able to calculate the k 1 and k -1 , the rate of the association and dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex. The k 1 and k -1 for the M298R mutant and substrate is 0.049 s -1 \u03bcM -1 and 0.98 s -1 , while those for SARS-CoV M pro is 0.00246 s -1 \u03bcM -1 and 0.084 s -1 . The rate constants for M298R mutant showed 20-and 12-fold higher than those for SARS-CoV M pro . The more rapid association and relatively slower dissociation of enzyme-substrate complex may be used to explain why the catalytic efficiency (k cat /K m ) of the MERS-CoV M pro M298R mutant is higher than that of SARS-CoV M pro (Table 2) .",

Biochemical and AUC studies indicated that MERS-CoV M pro shows almost the same proteolytic activity as SARS-CoV M pro ; although it is a monomer in aqueous buffer and displays substrate-induced dimerization (Fig 6) . A conserved residue, Glu169, plays an essential role in the substrateinduced dimerization of both MERS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV M pro . Moreover, mutation of a residue in the dimerization interface, M298R, was found to result in a more stable dimer form in aqueous buffer that had higher enzyme activity; while other two mutations, V4R and T126S, showed the reverse effect. Critical assessment of the residues important to dimerization of and catalysis by MERS-CoV M pro provides valuable insights into the mechanism that controls the monomer-dimer switch of important and valuable enzyme.

(PDF) S3 Fig. Comparison with the structure of MERS-CoV M pro with that of SARS-CoV M pro (A) and those of ligand-bound complex, dimeric C148A mutant and bat-CoV HKU4 M pro (B). (A) An overlay of the current structure of MERS-CoV M pro (cyan and orange) with that of SARS-CoV (grey; PDB entry 1uk3). The red arrows show the orientation change affecting the two domain IIIs. Spheres show the two catalytic dyads. (B) Overlay of the current structure with ligand-bound complex (red; PDB entry 4YLU), dimeric C148A mutant (magenta; PDB entry 4WME) and bat-CoV HKU4 M pro (yellow; PDB entry 2YNA). (PDF) S4 Fig. Activity assay of SARS-CoV M pro . The plot of rate constant (k obs ) versus the concentration of TQ6-pNA are indicated. The line represented the best-fit results according to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Eq 1). The protein concentration was 1.1 \u03bcM. The assays were performed in 10 mM phosphate (pH7.6) and repeated twice to ensure reproducibility and the error bars were shown. The kinetic parameters are shown in Table 2. (PDF) S5 Fig. Continuous size distribution of MERS-CoV M pro at various protein concentrations. The protein concentration of 1.5 (solid line), 6 (dotted line) and 15 \u03bcM (dashed line) of MERS-CoV M pro were used and monitored the size distribution by AUC. The best-fit results suggest that the major species was a monomer with minor shift of sedimentation coefficient (1.74 to 1.97), while the calculated molar mass was from 35.8 to 36.6 kDa. The residual bitmaps of the raw data and the best-fit results are shown in the insets. (PDF) S6 Fig. Effect of substrate concentration on the dimerization of MERS-CoV M pro . (A) Continuous c(s) distribution of the enzyme at peptidyl substrate (TQ6-pNA) concentrations of 0 \u03bcM (solid circles), 80 \u03bcM (open circles), 200 \u03bcM (solid triangles), 340 \u03bcM (open triangles), 400 \u03bcM (solid squares) and 600 \u03bcM (open squares). The protein concentration was 0.25 mg/ ml. (B) Sedimentation coefficient shifts of the major species of MERS-CoV M pro at different TQ6-pNA concentrations.
