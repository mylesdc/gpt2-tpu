At present the most effective means for detection and strain-typing is quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), which can exhibit excellent sensitivity and specificity but requires separate tests for detection and genotyping, lacks standardization between available tests and between labs, and has limited practicality for widespread, point-of-care use. We have developed and previously described a silver nanorod array-surface enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (NA-SERS) biosensing platform capable of detecting M. pneumoniae with statistically significant specificity and sensitivity in simulated and true clinical throat swab samples, and the ability to distinguish between reference strains of the two main genotypes of M. pneumoniae. Furthermore, we have established a qualitative lower endpoint of detection for NA-SERS of < 1 genome equivalent (cell/\u03bcl) and a quantitative multivariate detection limit of 5.3 \u00b1 1 cells/\u03bcl. Here we demonstrate using partial least squares-discriminatory analysis (PLS-DA) of sample spectra that NA-SERS correctly identified M. pneumoniae clinical isolates from globally diverse origins and distinguished these from a panel of 12 other human commensal and pathogenic mycoplasma species with 100% cross-validated statistical accuracy. Furthermore, PLS-DA correctly classified by strain type all 30 clinical isolates with 96% cross-validated accuracy for type 1 strains, 98% cross-validated accuracy for type 2 strains, and 90% cross-validated accuracy for type 2V strains.",

Genetic diversity is relatively limited among M. pneumoniae strains, which can be categorized into two major groups (type 1 or type 2) based on variation within sequence of the P1 (MPN141) gene, although variant strains of the two are increasingly more common [7] . The P1 protein is an important virulence factor and immunogen in M. pneumoniae infection [8] [9] [10] . P1 must complex with several other proteins in order to localize to the tip of the terminal organelle, where it mediates receptor binding for attachment to the respiratory epithelium, an essential step in successful colonization of the airways [9, 11] . Variation in the P1 gene sequence is used to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 strains of M. pneumoniae, but little is known about phenotypic differences arising from this genetic variation. Perhaps notable in this regard is the periodicity of type-switching that occurs between the two major genotypes in regular patterns of four to seven years [12] .",

            "text": "M. pneumoniae infection is transmitted through aerosolized respiratory secretions and spreads slowly but efficiently through close living quarters, with incubation periods up to three weeks [13, 14] . Symptoms tend to be non-descript, often with complex and variable clinical presentations, which makes definitive diagnosis challenging [2, 6, 15] . As a result, diagnosis is often presumptive and relies heavily on the combination of physical findings and the elimination of other possible causes [4, 5, 14] . The success rate for laboratory culture is poor, even for experienced labs, while serologic testing, historically considered the foundation for diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection, has limited sensitivity and specificity, a high tendency for false-negatives, requires paired sera resulting in retrospective diagnosis, and must often be paired with another diagnostic method [2, 4, 5, 10, 14] . Of the currently existing alternatives, the most efficient means for detection is quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). At present, the only FDA-approved tests for the clinical detection of M. pneumoniae are the Illumigene automated detection system (Meridian Bioscience, Inc., Cincinatti, Ohio) and the FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire Diagnostics Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah). The Illumigene platform uses loop-mediated isothermal amplification and is capable of detecting M. pneumoniae in both throat and nasopharyngeal swab specimens with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. The FilmArray Respiratory Panel employs nested, multiplex qPCR with endpoint melt curve analysis on nasopharyngeal swabs to test for 21 different viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens, and is capable of detecting M. pneumoniae as low as 30 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml [16] . The current standard for M. pneumoniae genotyping is PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, but can also be done by nested PCR and sequencing, multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis, or by qPCR and high resolution melt curve analysis [15, [17] [18] [19] . These methods for detection and genotyping exhibit high sensitivity and specificity for all known strain variants, can allow for detection in the early stages of infection, and can be performed in hospitals and reference laboratories [2, 4, 5] . However, the requirement for separate tests for detection and genotyping, as well as the cost, complexity, and expertise required, limits the practicality for widespread, point-of-care use [2, [4] [5] [6] 14] . These limitations create a critical barrier to the accurate and timely diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection and epidemiological tracking, and a rapid, simple, diagnostic platform capable of simultaneous detection and genotyping would greatly improve the control of M. pneumoniae disease.",

Raman spectroscopy in particular has several advantages for application to biological samples, including narrow bandwidths, good spatial resolution, and the ability to analyze aqueous samples due to the absence of interference by water molecules [20, 21, 24] . Furthermore, Raman spectra provide detailed structural information on the chemical composition of a sample and can serve as a characteristic molecular fingerprint for pathogen identification [23, 24] . Despite these advantages, standard Raman spectra are inherently limited by weak signals for detection. As a result, the application of traditional Raman spectroscopy for biosensing applications was impractical and inefficient [13, 21, 24] until the discovery that sample adsorption onto nanoscopically roughened metallic surfaces results in significant enhancements in Raman signal and spectral intensity [23] [24] [25] . This enhancement, by factors up to 10 14 -fold, is attributed to the increased electromagnetic field for molecules in close proximity to the metallic surface [20, 21] . Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) retains the advantages of standard Raman spectroscopy, in addition to markedly improved sensitivity, allowing for considerable success at whole organism molecular fingerprinting [20, 24, 26, 27] .",

            "text": "Inconsistency and lack of reproducibility in the preparation of SERS-active substrates has hindered its widespread use for biosensing applications [20, 21, 24] . However, highly ordered silver nanorod array (NA) substrates fabricated using oblique angle deposition (OAD) yield consistent SERS enhancement factors of around 10 8 , with less than 15% variation between substrate batches [21] . The reproducibility of NA-SERS substrates can be improved further when patterned into a multiwell format with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) [20] . The highly reproducible detection capabilities of NA-SERS have been well demonstrated for multiple infectious agents, including RSV, rotavirus, influenza, HIV, adenovirus, SARS coronavirus, and M. pneumoniae [13, 22, [28] [29] [30] . Hennigan et al. described an NA-SERS-based platform capable of detecting M. pneumoniae with statistically significant sensitivity and specificity in both simulated and true clinical throat swabs, with the potential to detect and type M. pneumoniae within a single test [13] . We recently determined the sensitivity of NA-SERS for M. pneumoniae detection to be < 1 genome equivalent (cell/\u03bcl) qualitatively, and to have a quantitative multivariate detection limit of 5.3 \u00b1 1 cells/\u03bcl [31] . Initial evaluation of this biosensing platform's capabilities indicates the potential for application as a next-generation diagnostic tool for the clinical detection of M. pneumoniae, but a more comprehensive analysis is needed prior to proceeding with clinical validation. In the present study we further explored the specificity of NA-SERS for M. pneumoniae detection with a panel of 30 M. pneumoniae isolates collected from representative global outbreaks and spanning clinically relevant genotypes. Furthermore, since NA-SERS has inherent biochemical specificity, we analyzed a panel of 12 other human commensal and pathogenic mycoplasmas to demonstrate that this biosensing platform could distinguish M. pneumoniae from its clinically relevant closest phylogenetic relatives. Finally, we evaluated the ability of the NA-SERS platform to correctly type the 30 M. pneumoniae clinical isolates relative to known reference strains of M. pneumoniae.",

P1 genotype groups were determined by the Pneumonia Response and Surveillance Laboratory at the CDC in Atlanta, GA using DNA sequence analysis, qPCR in combination with high resolution melt curve analysis, and RFLP sequencing analysis. All mycoplasma isolates and controls were cultured in SP4 medium [2, 30] in tissue culture flasks with a 1\u03bcl/ml inoculation and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Strains grown at UGA were harvested at log phase when the phenol red indicator turned an orange color upon reaching a pH of~6.5. Strains grown at the CDC were harvested 14 days from the date of inoculation to ensure adequate growth for all isolates. At time of harvest, the spent growth medium was decanted for each flask and 0.1\u00d7 volume of sterile PBS (pH 7.2) was added to wash the adherent mycoplasmas. The PBS wash was then decanted and the PBS wash repeated 3\u00d7 before the cells were scraped into 1 ml sterile PBS. Cells were then syringe-passaged 10\u00d7 with a 25 gauge needle and aliquots made for determination of protein content, plating on PPLO agar [32] for CFU determination (for select isolates and controls), DNA extraction for genome equivalent determination, and SERS analysis.",

Full details regarding isolate origin and year, P1 genotype, macrolide susceptibility, protein and DNA content, and genome equivalents for M. pneumoniae strains are given in Table 1 . CFU values were determined for both reference strains and six randomly chosen additional isolates to assess cell viability at time of fixation and ranged from 1x10 5 to 1x10 7 CFU/ml. Due to the propensity for mycoplasma cells to clump, a confounding factor in using CFU values as a metric for sample content is the potential discrepancy between CFU value and actual cell number, which can differ by as much as 10 3 -fold [39] . Therefore, protein content and genome equivalents were determined in order to better define the content of the samples at the concentration analyzed by SERS. These values fell within comparable ranges and were consistent with published values for bacterial cells [40] . Protein concentration per cell was higher for M. pneumoniae isolates harvested during stationary phase relative to those harvested during log phase (growth phase based on the color of the pH indicator in the SP4 medium), but no notable differences in genome equivalents or SERS spectra were observed between M. pneumoniae samples relative to growth phase at time of harvest (data not shown). Average SERS spectra of the nanorod substrate background, growth medium control, and M. pneumoniae samples are shown in Fig 1, with each class exhibiting a distinct band pattern, as expected. PLS-DA was applied here to determine statistically significant detection of M. pneumoniae by NA-SERS. PLS-DA is a full-spectrum, multivariate, supervised statistical method whereby prior knowledge of classes is used to yield more robust discrimination by minimizing variation within classes while emphasizing latent variables arising from spectral differences between classes [41, 42] . A PLS-DA model was generated to discriminate between three classes: the nanorod substrate background (Fig 2A) ; the growth medium control ( Fig 2B) ; and all M. pneumoniae strains (Fig 2C) . The inclusion of substrate background and growth medium controls allowed us to ensure that any differences in growth medium and nanorod background signal within the substrate did not affect the ability of the model to discriminate between the presence or absence of M. pneumoniae. Two nanorod substrates were used for these experiments, with each containing duplicate wells of the bare nanorod substrate, independently prepared M129, FH, and growth medium controls, and 15 additional clinical isolates of M. pneumoniae. A total of n = 390 pre-processed NA-SERS spectra collected from both substrates were included in the model, consisting of 20 nanorod substrate background spectra, 20 growth medium control spectra, 25 M129 spectra, 25 FH spectra, and 10 spectra per additional clinical isolate. The cross-validated statistics for the model show that NA-SERS correctly classified all 32 clinical isolates as M. pneumoniae regardless of global origin, year isolated, genotype, or macrolide susceptibility phenotype, and distinguished them from the substrate background and the growth medium control with 100% cross-validated sensitivity and specificity. A critical question for clinical detection platforms is specificity for the pathogen of interest, particularly in the context of other organisms potentially present in a clinical sample. SERS is a structure-based technique that generates a Raman fingerprint or barcode based on the unique molecular content of the sample, and as such, the most likely organisms to generate false positives would be those most closely resembling M. pneumoniae structurally. To evaluate the specificity of the NA-SERS biosensing platform, 12 human commensal and pathogenic Mollicutes species closely related to M. pneumoniae in rpoB \u03b2-subunit nucleotide and amino acid sequence phylogenies and 16S rDNA phylogeny were chosen for analysis alongside M. pneumoniae strain M129 and a growth medium control [33] . In order to best define the content of the sample at the concentration used for SERS, analyses were done to determine total protein and DNA content, the latter allowing calculation of genome equivalents based on known genome sizes and G+C content ( Table 2 ). These fell within comparable ranges and were consistent with published values for bacterial cells [40] .",

To evaluate this capability we applied PLS-DA to the M. pneumoniae strain spectra above. Our panel of clinical isolates contained three distinct and clinically relevant genotypes of M. pneumoniae: 13 type 1 strains, 11 type 2 strains, and six type 2 variant (2V) strains. M. pneumoniae strains M129 (type 1) and FH (type 2) were used as reference strain controls, as they have been previously applied in this manner for evaluation of M. pneumoniae genotyping assays [19] . For the type 1 strains a PLS-DA model was generated using 180 pre-processed NA-SERS spectra consisting of the 25 M129 spectra and the 25 FH spectra as controls, and all spectra from the 13 other type 1 clinical isolate samples (10 spectra per isolate, 130 total spectra). The model was built to discriminate between 2 classes, either type 1 or type 2. PLS-DA was able to correctly classify all other 13 type 1 strains with the type 1 reference strain with 96.8% sensitivity and 96% specificity (Fig 4A) . For the type 2 strains a second PLS-DA model was generated using 160 pre-processed NA-SERS spectra consisting of the 50 type 1 and 2 reference strain control spectra and all spectra from the 11 other type 2 clinical isolate samples (10 spectra per isolate, 110 total spectra). This model was likewise built to discriminate between 2 classes, either type 1 or type 2. PLS-DA was able to correctly classify all 11 other type 2 isolates with the type 2 reference strain control with 99.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity (Fig 4B) .",

However, this model was built to discriminate between 3 classes, type 1 reference strain control, type 2 reference strain control, or type 2V clinical isolate spectra. A third class was necessary for classification of this genotype, as existing methods are capable of identifying variant strains as unique from type 1 and 2 isolate strains [18] , and as such for clinical purposes NA-SERS typing should be able to do the same. PLS-DA correctly classified the type 1 reference strain control as distinct from the type 2 control and the type 2V clinical isolates with 100% cross-validated sensitivity and 98.8% cross-validated specificity (Fig 5A) . Furthermore, PLS-DA distinguished the type 2 reference strain control from the type 1 control and 2V clinical isolates with a crossvalidated sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 90.6%, respectively ( Fig 5B) . Lastly, PLS-DA correctly classified all six type 2V strains as distinct from the type 1 and 2 reference strain controls with 100% cross-validated sensitivity and specificity (Fig 5C) . The drop in sensitivity and specificity observed for the type 2 reference strain control is likely due to the fact that these are variant strains of the type 2 parent strain, and variant strains tend to be more similar to their respective parent strains genetically than either are to the opposite strain type [18, 37] .",

For type 1 and 2 clinical isolates, two categories were used for cross-validation of the model, while for type 2V isolate strains, three categories were incorporated to cross-validate the model, as described above. For all clinical isolate types the model was cross-validated by using a Venetian blinds algorithm with seven data splits. These PLS-DA models were incorporated to simulate a potential strategy for future application of NA-SERS for M. pneumoniae genotyping wherein known strain type controls are used to predict the genotype of an unknown clinical sample. Full cross-validated statistics for all 30 PLS-DA models are given in Table 3 for all type  1 and 2 clinical isolates, and Table 4 for all type 2V clinical isolates. Overall, PLS-DA performance was consistent with the models shown in Figs 4 and 5.

The majority of the spectral fingerprint was identical for all three strain types, which is to be expected since they are all the same species and classify as such in the PLS-DA models shown in Figs 2 and 3. However, several visible differences in band pattern were present in the spectra for each genotype of M. pneumoniae, which could account for the ability of NA-SERS to distinguish between the three genotypes with statistically significant sensitivity and specificity. The averaged type 1 spectrum had two unique peaks, one at 1636 cm -1 that does not appear in the averaged type 2 or 2V spectra, and one at 959 cm -1 which appeared as more distinct and shifted slightly right in the type 1 spectrum when compared to the type 2 spectrum, and did not appear in the type 2V spectrum. The averaged type 2 strain spectrum was very similar to the type 1 strain spectrum aside from the differences mentioned above and the presence of a doublet at 767 and 778 cm -1 , which appeared as more distinct than that present in the type 2V spectrum pneumoniae spectra by open shapes that differ by cluster to indicate the different individual strains and isolates, and the human commensal and pathogenic Mollicutes species are represented by light gray shapes that differ by cluster to indicate the individual species.

            "text": "doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0131831.t003 [7] . Nucleotide and amino acid sequencing of 60 M. pneumoniae isolates indicates that trinucleotide short sequence repeats (SSR's) coding for serine can be found in all strain types anywhere from 5-14 times, but appear to be most prevalent in type 1 strains [7] . Serine repeats may form a hinge structure and lead to downstream conformational differences in the P1 protein between the different strain types, which could potentially affect its interaction with the host as a surface antigen [45, 46] . In addition, 14 of the 60 isolates in the Zhao et al. study had point mutations in several variant strains corresponding to amino acid changes in P1 to glutamine, proline, asparagine, and isoleucine residues [7] . In our study, the peaks unique to the type 1 spectrum are commonly associated with vibrational mode bonds present in lysine (959 cm -1 ) and amide I or alpha helix (1636 cm -1 ) molecular structures [47] [48] [49] . The peaks unique to the type 2 spectral fingerprint located at 767 and 778 cm -1 are commonly associated with vibrational modes found in histidine, tryptophan, or carbohydrate bonds [48] [49] [50] . Finally, the peaks unique to the type 2V clinical isolates found at 521, 875 and 890 cm -1 are frequently associated with bonds present in histidine, tryptophan, ribose, indole, asparagine, methionine, glutamine, and S-S and C-C stretching vibrational modes [48] [49] [50] . Interestingly, the unique peaks present in the average spectra for the strain types analyzed in this study are predominately associated with protein backbone, amino acid residue, and DNA bond vibrations. Furthermore, spectral features in the averaged spectrum of the 2V variant strains are consistent with the point mutations identified in the Zhao et al. study [7] , and our overall spectral interpretation of the averaged spectra for each strain type is consistent with what is known about the differences between strain types of M. pneumoniae infection.

In order to overcome this limitation and address the question in a clinically relevant classification system, individual pair-wise PLS-DA modeling was employed. For this analysis, we chose to focus on the nine other human commensal and pathogenic mycoplasma species most closely related phylogentically to M. pneumoniae. Individual PLS-DA models were built for each of the nine mycoplasma species to distinguish among three categories: the growth medium control (1), M. pneumoniae (2), or the mycoplasma species in question. Each model contained a total of n = 30 spectra, with 10 spectra representing each category. Furthermore, for each category eight of the 10 spectra were of known sample class, whereas two out of the 10 spectra were treated as unknowns and classified based on their resemblance to category 1, 2, or 3 spectra. Cross-validation of the prediction capability for each model was done using a Venetian blinds algorithm with five data splits. Models were designed this way to simulate the prediction of a potential unknown clinical sample as mycoplasma-negative, M. pneumoniae-positive, or positive for one of the other human commensal or pathogenic mycoplasma species. The cross-validated sensitivities and specificities for all nine models are given in Table 5 . Overall, the cross-validated sensitivity and specificity was 90% or greater for all nine models, which is very promising for further application of NA-SERS for species-level discrimination and prediction.",

Serologic testing was historically the gold standard for diagnosis but suffers from severe limitations that make it both unreliable and impractical for rapid detection. Advances in qPCR technologies have overcome many issues with sensitivity and reliability, but the cost of reagents and requirement for technical expertise are still high, and independent tests must be done for detection and genotyping, limiting diagnosis by qPCR to hospital or advanced laboratory facilities and making it impractical for pointof-care use. We previously established that this NA-SERS biosensing platform is capable of statistically significant detection of M. pneumoniae in true and simulated throat swabs and has a qualitative endpoint of detection for M. pneumoniae of < 1 cell/\u03bcl, a sensitivity exceeding that of qPCR [13, 31] . Here, NA-SERS showed statistically significant specificity for M. pneumoniae detection regardless of clinical isolate origin, year of isolation, macrolide susceptibility phenotype, or strain type, and was also able to distinguish all M. pneumoniae clinical isolates and control strains from 12 other human commensal and pathogenic Mollicutes species. Furthermore, NA-SERS discriminated between the two major strain types of M. pneumoniae with a high degree of statistically significant accuracy and correctly identified variant strains as different from the two major genotypes. Most importantly, NA-SERS was capable of detecting and strain-typing M. pneumoniae within a single test and thus has the potential to facilitate tracking epidemiological trends, such as type-switching and outbreak periodicity [12] . Studies with clinical samples are ongoing, and the effect of the presence of a clinically relevant sample background, for example from a patient's throat swab, on the ability of this platform to identify strain types or distinguish M. pneumoniae from other human commensal and pathogenic Mollicutes species remains to be determined. Furthermore, assessment of alternative methods of chemometric analysis to account for the increased number of classes and modeling complexity for species-level discrimination by NA-SERS is necessary. In addition, future clinical application of this technology will require collection of a larger spectral library of isolates and background controls. However, from a point-of-care clinical standpoint, the ability to detect M. pneumoniae rapidly is critical to informing appropriate treatment regimens consistent with the responsible use of antimicrobials. This feature is underscored by the availability of handheld Raman instruments having the potential for point-of-care use [52] [53] [54] . In combination with the minimal sample preparation requirements and expedient detection, NA-SERS shows great promise as a platform for future application to point-of-care M. pneumoniae diagnostics.",

For panel D, growth medium control spectra are represented by dark gray diamonds, M. pneumoniae spectra by open squares, and all 12 other Mollicutes species by light gray triangles. For panels A-D, clustering of samples is indicated by black circles or brackets. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0131831.g007",
