This virus is commonly found in environmental waters and is very resistant to water disinfection and environmental stressors, especially UV light inactivation. Molecular techniques, such as PCR-based methods (Polymerase Chain Reaction), are commonly used to detect and identify viral contamination in water, although PCR alone does not allow the discrimination between infectious and non-infectious viral particles. A combination of cell culture and PCR has allowed detection of infectious viruses that grow slowly or fail to produce cytopathic effects (CPE) in cell culture. This study aimed to assess the integrity and viability of human adenovirus (HAdV) in environmental water and evaluate circulating strains by molecular characterization in three sites of the water supply in Florian\u00f3polis, Santa Catarina Island, Brazil: Peri Lagoon water, spring source water, and water from the public water supply system.",

Viral integrity was evaluated by enzymatic assay (DNase I) and infectivity by plaque assay (PA) and integrated cell culture using transcribed mRNA (ICC-RT-qPCR).

Results: The analyzed sites contained 83, 66 and 58% undamaged HAdV particles (defined as those in which the genetic material is protected by the viral capsid) at Peri Lagoon, spring source water and public supply system water, respectively. Of these, 66% of the particles (by PA) and 75% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) HAdV were shown to be infectious, due to being undamaged in Peri Lagoon, 33% (by PA) and 58% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) in spring source water and 8% (by PA) and 25% (by ICC-RT-qPCR) in the public water supply system. ICC-RT-qPCR, a very sensitive and rapid technique, was able to detect as low as 1 \u00d7 10 2 HAdV genome copies per milliliter of infectious viral particles in the environmental water samples. The molecular characterization studies indicated that HAdV-2 was the prevalent serotype.",

However, this method has a disadvantage in that detection of nucleic acids of inactivated viruses from environmental samples adsorbed onto cell receptors without cell infection can result in false positives [10] .

The PA value (PFU/mL) equivalence, when compared to ICC-RT-qPCR values (GC/mL) immediately after the concentration of water samples and after a series of decimal dilutions (10 0 to 10 -8 ), is shown in Figure 1 . The average equivalence of a PFU unit for GC was 3.4 logs, which means that 10 2 PFU is equivalent to 10 5 GC. This proportionality was confirmed via statistical testing (Linear Regression test) conducted with GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (USA). The ICC-RT-qPCR assay was more sensitive than the PA in the detection of HAdV, demonstrating a detection limit of 1\u00d710 2 GC/mL (decimal dilution 10 -7 ), while the PA had a detection limit of 1\u00d710 1 PFU/mL (decimal dilution 10 -3 ) (Figure 1 ).",

Therefore, the processed samples were used to evaluate viral integrity (via enzymatic assay with DNase I) and infectivity (via PA and ICC-RT-qPCR-et) of HAdV present in the collected water samples. The majority of samples evaluated in this study contained intact HAdV particles, but this result does not mean that those particles were infectious, as factors such as temperature, pH and UV radiation are known to cause conformational changes in the viral capsid, resulting in Figure 2 Undamaged and infectious HAdV particle: Average number of undamaged and infectious HAdV particle detected in water samples: a) Lagoon water b) Spring source water, and c) Public supply system water.

HAdV serotypes that are responsible for gastroenteritis are HAdV40 and 41 that are usually difficult to propagate in cell culture, so the use of enzyme tests can infer on viral infectivity, being a less laborious than techniques in cell culture [28] . Molecular and bioinformatics studies have both demonstrated higher efficiency in characterization, as in the discovery of new virus subtypes [29, 30] . HAdV-2 is commonly found throughout the world. The virus subtype causes diseases that affect the upper respiratory tract, particularly in children [31, 32] . The results of the HAdV characterization performed in the present study, by sequencing and molecular characterization, indicated the prevalence of HAdV, serotype subgroup C in the samples evaluated. The viruses that belong to HAdV subgroup C (C1-C2-C5-C6, and C7) are known to cause respiratory viral infections [33] . Our findings corroborate those of other studies that reported the prevalence of HAdV-2 in the aquatic environment and in stool samples [34] [35] [36] . Taken together, these studies and others indicate that HAdV-2 is one of the serotypes most commonly excreted by humans [37] , suggesting that this virus is intermittently excreted in the feces of most individuals, even if they are asymptomatic [16] .",
