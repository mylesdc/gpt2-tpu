The VP1 gene region and complete genome sequences of EV-D68 positive cases were analyzed. Of 21816 ARTI cases, 619 (2.84%) were EV positive and 42 cases were EV-D68 positive. The detection rates of EV-D68 were 0 (0/6644) in 2015, 0.53% (40/7522) in 2016 and 0.03% (2/7650) in 2017, respectively. Two peaks of EV-D68 infections occurred in late summer and early-winter. Ten cases (23.81%) with upper respiratory tract infection and 32 cases (76.19%) presented with pneumonia, including 3 cases with severe pneumonia. The phylogenetic analysis suggested 15 subclade D3 strains and 27 subclade B3 strains of EV-D68 were circulated in China from 2016 to 2017. A total of 52 amino acid polymorphisms were identified between subclades D1 and D3. These data suggest an upsurge of EV-D68 occurred in Beijing in 2016, the new subclade D3 emerged in 2016 and co-circulated with subclade B3 between 2016 and 2017.",

One study by Cyril et al. showed that 2.6-7.1% diversity in nucleotide identity of EV-D68 VP1 gene region could be divided into different subclades 31 . The diversities of EV-D68 VP1 gene region in nucleotide were 2.6-3.8% between subclade D1 and D3, and 5.7-6.4% between subclade D2 and D3. Therefore, we defined the new subclade of EV-D68, subclade D3. In this study, the phylogenetic analysis showed subclade B3 strains with highly homologous were grouped into the same evolutionary branch with strains in other countries in 2016, but in separated evolutionary branches with the strains in Beijing, Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Taiwan during 2014 to 2015.",
