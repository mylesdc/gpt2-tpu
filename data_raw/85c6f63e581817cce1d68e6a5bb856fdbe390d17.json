Clinically, there are two main categories of anti-inflammatory drugs: steroidal drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Steroidal drugs generally refer to adrenocortical hormones, which have strong anti-inflammatory effect, but have obvious side effects such as water-sodium retention, puffiness, and osteoporosis [2] . And NSAID is one of the most widely used drugs in the world and are mainly classified into salicylates, propionic acids, indoles, fenamic acids, acetic acids and pyrazolones [3] . However, it has potential cardiovascular and gastrointestinal bleeding risks [4] . Due to the strong toxic and side effects of many synthetic drugs, and because traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has the advantages of abundant resources, definite therapeutic effectiveness, and fewer side effects, the discovery of novel anti-inflammatory drugs from natural compounds has gradually become a research hotspot [5] .",

However, the activated NF-B signaling pathway participates not only in immune regulation and inflammation, but also in infection, cell cycle regulation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis [13] [14] [15] . If the activation cannot be eliminated in time, it may lead to serious pathological reactions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, septic shock, atherosclerosis, and cancer [16] [17] [18] . Consequently, inhibitors of NF-B activation are of primary significance in protecting cells from the potential damage of inflammation. Based on the efficient separation and analysis functions of UPLC-Q-TOF-MS and cell biological method, seven compounds with NF-B inhibitory activity were screened from MC. Among them, gallic acid could inhibit NF-B activation by prevention of RelA acetylation [19] . And paeoniflorin could significantly inhibit NF-B by reducing the expression of the phosphorylation of I B and p65 [20] . Additionally, paeonol could suppress NF-B signaling through blocking MAPK/p38 signaling pathway [21, 22] . Furthermore, oxypaeoniflorin could inhibit the elevation of the expression levels of NF-B although the mechanism remained unclear [23] . Additionally, NF-B inhibitory activity of galloylpaeoniflorin, benzoyloxypaeoniflorin, and mudanoside C has not been reported in previous studies. In the present study, those three compounds could inhibit the activation of NF-B induced by TNF-a and could be considered as novel NF-B inhibitors. In general, the efficacy of drugs depends mainly on their chemical structures [24] . According to our results, other monoterpenoids with paeoniflorin as the core structure may also have NF-B inhibitory activity, which can be used as a lead compound for the study of innovative drugs. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the antiinflammatory activity of MC was related to the process of various components acting on multiple targets ( Figure 5) , which was consistent with the characteristics of TCMs with multiple components, multiple pathways, and multiple targets [25, 26] .",

Taking paeonol as an example, it showed significant NF-B inhibitory effects at a concentration of 10 \u22125 mol/L, which was much lower than its toxic content.
