The CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) gene family codes for such proteins and indeed shows tremendous species-specific variation between human and rodents. Since little is known about the CEA gene family in other lineages of placental mammals, we expected to gain new insights into the evolution of the rapidly diverging CEA family by analyzing the CEA family of the dog.",

We found that the gene coding for the ITIM-bearing immunoregulatory molecule CEACAM1 gave rise to a recent expansion of the canine CEA gene family by gene duplication, similar to that previously found in humans and mice. However, while the murine and human CEACAMs (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules) are predominantly secreted and GPI-anchored, respectively, in the dog, most of the CEACAMs represent ITAM-bearing transmembrane proteins. One of these proteins, CEACAM28, exhibits nearly complete sequence identity with the ligand-binding N domain of CEACAM1, but antagonizing signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic tail. Comparison of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions indicates that the CEACAM28 N domain is under the strongest purifying selection of all canine CEACAM1-related CEACAMs. In addition, CEACAM28 shows a similar expression pattern in resting immune cells and tissues as CEACAM1. However, upon activation CEACAM28 mRNA and CEACAM1 mRNA are differentially regulated.",

            "text": "The evolution of immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) members is largely influenced by the nature of their ligands. The extracellular part of IgSF members which are predominantly expressed in the nervous system are well conserved, while the extracellular domains of members expressed by immune cells or cells involved in reproduction tend to diversify much more rapidly [1] . The CEA gene family, which belongs to the IgSF, is a tandemly clustered multigene family. Such gene families are subject to rapid evolution due to ongoing gene duplication, deletion and mutational events [2] . At present, the CEA family is subdivided into two main subgroups: the CEA-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) and the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) subgroups. The CEACAM subgroup in humans consists of 12 members composed of a single immunoglobulin variable (IgV)-like N-terminal (N) domain followed by zero to six Ig constant (IgC)-like domains of A and B subtypes and one member which consists of two IgC-like domains and two IgV-like domains, one at each end of the molecule. CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM4, CEACAM18, CEACAM19, CEACAM20 and CEACAM21 are transmembrane molecules while CEA/ CEACAM5, CEACAM6, CEACAM7, and CEACAM8 are linked to the cell membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors and CEACAM16 is most likely a secreted molecule. For CEACAM1 (also known as CD66a, BGP and C-CAM105) and the recently discovered CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20, but not for other family members have orthologs been identified in rodents [3] . In addition to these orthologs, the transmembrane-bound CEACAM2 (in mice), CEACAM17 (in mice and rats) and the secreted members CEACAM9, CEACAM10, CEACAM11 CEACAM12, CEACAM13, CEACAM14, CEACAM15 (in mice and rats) exist in rodents [3, 4] . In mice, rats and cattle, at least two CEACAM1 alleles each have been identified, which differ considerably in their N domain sequences [5] . No such allelic variation has been observed in humans. The PSG, which are specifically expressed in the trophoblast, are the most abundant fetal proteins in the maternal bloodstream during late human pregnancy. The PSGs are thought to play a pivotal role in the regulation of the maternal immune response to the fetal semi-allograft [6] . The diversity of the CEACAM/PSG family of proteins is further enhanced by species-specific differential splicing of several family members [7] . As expected from the variable structure of the CEA family members, these molecules have diverse functions. It is well established that various CEA family members play crucial roles in cell-cell adhesion, tumor development, angiogenesis, insulin metabolism, reproduction and, as more recently realized, in immunity [8] . CEACAM1 functions as a natural killer cell inhibitory receptor [9, 10] , regulates T and B cell proliferation [11, 12] , induces dendritic cell maturation [13] and facilitates granulocyte and monocyte survival [14, 15] . In addition, CEACAM3, CEACAM6 and CEACAM8 were found to be pivotal for the regulation of granulocyte activation in humans [16] . While human CEACAM1 contains two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain, one CEACAM1 ITIM is replaced by an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM) in mice and rats. Human CEACAM3 and possibly CEACAM4, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 harbor functional immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) in their cytoplasmic tails [17, 18] . In contrast, except for CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 no such ITAM-containing CEA family members exist in rodents. Remarkably, several pathogens namely, Neisseria sp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in humans [19] [20] [21] and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [22] use CEACAMs to anchor themselves to or to invade host cells. In addition, it has been suggested that bacterial pathogens can down-regulate immune functions by binding to CEACAM1 on CD4+ T lymphocytes and signaling via the CEACAM1 ITIM motif [23] . It was recently proposed that the human granulocyte-specific CEACAM3 functions as a specifically adapted single-chain ITAM-dependent phagocytic receptor involved in the clearance of CEACAM-binding bacteria by human granulocytes [24] . This indicates that fixation of genes in the human genome coding for ITAM-bearing CEACAMs can be the result of a selective pressure mediated by CEACAM-binding pathogenic microbes. In contrast, one of the two allelic variants of murine CEACAM1 exhibits a significant lower virus receptor activity suggesting that, in mice, mutations in the CEACAM1 gene rather than the fixation of an activating virus receptor were acquired to evade pathogen attack. The availability of a high-quality draft genome sequence of the domestic dog (Canis familiaris) [25] provided the possibility to analyze the complete CEA gene family in a third mammalian order. Here we show that in the dog multiple ITAM-bearing CEACAM1-related CEACAMs evolved and that CEACAM28 and CEACAM1 have undergone concerted evolution by gene conversion. Based on sequence analyses and comparison of expression profiles we suggest that CEACAM28 and CEACAM1 are paired activating and inhibitory immune receptors involved in the regulation of T cell responses. The possibility that sporadic recurrence of selective pressure mediated by species-specific pathogens was the driving force for the evolution of multiple ITAM-bearing CEACAM1-related CEACAMs in the dog is discussed.",

The human and mouse CEA gene families are located within the expanded leukocyte receptor complex on chromosome 19q13 ( Figure 1A ) and chromosome 7, respectively. This approach yielded the sequences of the CEACAM1, CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 orthologs. Their predicted full length mRNA sequences (Additional file 1) encode proteins with domain organizations identical with their human and murine counterparts: CEACAM16 (N1-A-B-N2); CEACAM18 (N-A-B-TM-Cyt); CEACAM19 (N-TM-Cyt); CEACAM20 (truncated N-A1-B1-A2-B2-TM-Cyt) [3] . Like their mouse and human counterparts, both CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 contain presumed ITAM consensus sequences in their cytoplasmic domains. However, like in mouse, no CEACAM19 cytoplasmic domain exon 1 present in human CEACAM19 was found [3] . As for human CEACAM18, no cytoplasmic domain exon could be identified due to its small size and lack of corresponding EST sequences. In a second round of search we used the BLAST program and cDNA nucleotide sequences from the identified orthologous canine genes to screen the Gen-Bank and Ensemble databases. This strategy was employed in order to identify dog-specific genes which have evolved after the separation of the dog and primate/ rodent lineage. This approach led to the identification of 7 additional CEACAM genes (CEACAM23-CEACAM29) using CEACAM1 nucleotide sequences as query sequences. CEACAM23, CEACAM24, CEACAM25, CEACAM29, CEACAM28 and CEACAM1 are arranged between XRCC1 and LIPE, while CEACAM26 and CEACAM27 are located between CD79A and TGF\u03b21 on the opposite strand ( Figure 1) . Surprisingly, no genes corresponding to the PSG genes were found. The murine Psg genes are located between Hif3a and Pglyrp1 spanning nearly 1.8 Mbp. In dog, however, the distance between HIF3A and PGLYRP1 comprises only 0.1 Mbp which rules out the presence of a larger set of genes between these marker genes. Similarly, there is not enough space between XRCC1 and CEACAM23 (0.2 Mbp) to accommodate an expanded PSG gene family as found in humans at the corresponding chromosomal locations location where the distance is approximately 1 Mbp ( Figure 1B) . The canine CEACAM gene loci on dog chromosome 1 exhibit a similar arrangement to that found for the human CEA gene family on chromosome 19 but it is partially different from that of the murine CEA gene family on chromosome 7 ( Figure 1B) .",

Surprisingly, the 6 predicted transmembrane domain exons of the CEACAM1-related canine genes clustered with the sequences of the transmembrane domain exons of human CEACAM3, CEACAM4 and CEACAM21 which are connected to cytoplasmic domain exons encoding a C-terminal ITAM motif (CEACAM3 and CEACAM4) or a homologous truncated cytoplasmic domain with a premature stop (CEACAM21). The sequence of the transmembrane exon of canine CEACAM1 clustered with transmembrane sequences from murine Ceacam1 and Ceacam2 and with a group of exons coding for hydrophobic GPI signal peptides from human CEACAM1, CEACAM5, CEACAM6, CEACAM7, CEACAM8 (Figure 2A and data not shown). CEACAM5-CEACAM8 GPI signal peptide exons are thought to have evolved from the transmembrane exon of an ancestral CEACAM1 by introduction of a stop codon [26] . CEACAM1/Ceacam1 and Ceacam2 encode cytoplasmic domains which contain ITIM motifs. Taken together, this indicates that TM and cytoplasmic domain exons are exchanged together during evolution and predicts the presence of ITAM signaling motifs rather than ITIM in the cytoplasmic tails of the dog CEACAM23-CEACAM25, CEACAM28 and CEACAM29 molecules. Subsequently, we screened about 2,000 bp of nucleotide sequence downstream of the predicted canine transmembrane domain exons for the presence of the short cytoplasmic exons. Indeed, small cytoplasmic domain exons similar to the ones found in human CEACAM3 and CEACAM4 could be identified, which encode ITAM motifs close to the C-terminal end ( Figure 2B ). Although homologous cytoplasmic domain exons 1-3 are present in CEACAM29 the loss of the splice donor site in the cytoplasmic domain exon 3 leads to read through into the adjacent intron and truncation by a stop codon following after five codons. CEACAM26 and CEACAM27 probably represent pseudogenes due to multiple deletions in their extracellular (in particular N exons) and cytoplasmic domain exons (Figure 3) .",

As expected, the N domain sequences of the orthologous genes (CEACAM16, CEACAM18-CEACAM20) clustered pairwise, while all new canine N domain exon sequences (CEACAM23-CEACAM30) clustered with that from dog CEACAM1 ( Figure 5A ). Similarly, the primate-specific CEACAM1-related N domain nucleotide sequences (CEACAM3-CEACAM8) clustered with the human CEACAM1 N domain exon sequence except for CEACAM21 N. The close relationship between the new dog CEACAM genes and dog CEACAM1 could also be demonstrated when the A and B domain exon nucleotide sequences were compared ( Figure 5B ). Nine of the 17 IgC-like domains of the new CEACAM1-related canine molecules are of the CEACAM1 A2 type and five each were of the CEACAM1 A1 and B type ( Figure  5B ).CEACAM23 appears to be the only CEACAM1-related gene which contains all extracellular domain exons present in CEACAM1, in particular three IgC-like domain exons (A1, A2 and B). All other members of this subgroup either lack one of these exons or contain exons corrupted by nonsense, frame shift or splice site mutations leading to smaller predicted proteins (Figure 3, 4) . Assuming that the N domain is the most relevant domain for ligand interaction, the ligand specificity of CEACAM28 seems to be most closely related to that of CEACAM1. The N domain amino acid sequence of CEACAM28 differs from that of CEACAM1 in only two positions. These amino acid changes do not affect the center of the CFG face, a topological N domain region of CEACAM members essential for ligand and pathogen interactions ( Figure 6A,B) . Interestingly, CEACAM28 lies next to CEACAM1 in the CEACAM1 gene cluster which hints to an evolutionary recent duplication event ( Figure 1B) . CEACAM25 is the most distant CEACAM1 relative within the group of CEACAM1-related genes, sharing only 66% of its N domain exon encoded amino acid sequence (Figure 5A, 6A; Table 2 ). Most of the amino acid sequence differences cluster to the CFG face of the N domains, indicating a positive selection for ligand diversification. To test this possibility, we calculated the ratio of nonsynonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) nucleotide substitution rates on the branches of an N exon phylogenetic tree. The lowest Ka/ Ks ratio (0.1) is observed for CEACAM28. This indicates that the CEACAM28 N domain is under purifying selection. For all other canine CEACAM1-related CEACAMs, the N domain amino acid changes appear to evolve neu- (51) 56 (40) The trally or to be positively selected for during evolution since the corresponding Ka/Ks values are close to 1 or higher ( Figure 6C ).",

The downstream homologous region of ~1,700 bp demarcated by a SINE element in CEACAM28 exhibits a similarity of 92%.

The CEA gene family is well known in primates (humans) and rodents (mice and rats). However, both orders belong to the same principal lineage of placental mammals, the Euarchontoglires. Since carnivores belong to the Laurasiatheria clade, we expected to gain new insights into the evolution of the rapidly diverging CEA family by analysis of the CEA family of the dog. First of all, identification of CEACAM1, CEACAM16, CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 orthologs in the dog genome at corresponding chromosomal locations, strongly indicates that the CEA gene family of the common ancestor of Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria consisted of at least five genes. It remains to be seen whether species which represent older mammalian lineages like Afrotheria, marsupials and monotremes contain the same set of primordial genes. Furthermore, the findings of this work supports our previous hypothesis that CEACAM3-CEACAM8, CEACAM21 and CEACAM9-CEACAM15, CEACAM17, none of which is present in the dog genome ( Figure 2A and data not shown), represent primate and rodent-specific genes, respectively [3] . The ancestral members of the CEA gene family are located in three different loci (Figure 1 ). While CEACAM16, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20 are close together (CEACAM16 and CEACAM19 are next to each other), CEACAM1 is separated from this locus by more than 1 Mbp and CEACAM18 is displaced into the SIGLEC gene cluster in humans, mice and dogs.",

            "text": "This type of evolution also facilitates a mechanism for qualitatively changing a receptor's signaling potential. A number of type I transmembrane IgSF members including CEACAMs and KIRs are composed of an amino-terminal extracellular \"environmental sensor\" and a carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail which can contain either inhibitory (ITIM) or activating motifs (ITAM or a positively charged amino acid in the transmembrane region permitting coupling with activating adaptors such as DAP12 [42] ). Unequal crossing-over at such gene loci encompassing the corresponding exons could result, in a single step, in genes encoding receptors with a drastically changed signaling potential by combining the same extracellular domain with a cytoplasmic tail of opposite function. This allows rapid adaptation to environmental changes and the creation of so-called paired immune receptors. An example for such a mechanism is found for the KIR gene KIR3DL/S, where either an inhibitory variant or an activating variant encoding KIR gene is found in different human individuals at the same locus [43] . In addition, a change in the receptor's signaling potential which may be the result of an arms race between pathogens and the host immune system has been reported recently for mice. The murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) induces in infected cells expression of the virus-encoded GPI-anchored m157 protein, which binds to the activating, DAP12-associating killer receptor Ly49H in MCMV-resistant mice leading to NKcell-mediated cytotoxicity. MCMV-susceptible mouse CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 genomic regions involved in gene conversion Figure 9 CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 genomic regions involved in gene conversion. The 2332 bp genomic region of CEACAM1 which covers nearly 1 kb of the 5'-flanking region (5'-FR), the leader exon (L), intron 1 (IntI), the N domain exon (N) and part of intron 2 (Int II) is highly conserved in CEACAM28 (99%) and, therefore, probably participated in a recent gene conversion event. The homologous sequences upstream and downstream from the conserved region are less conserved (80% and 92%, respectively) (A). This can also be deduced from the degree of conservation of the amino acid sequences encoded by the leader, N and A domains which is much less outside of the gene conversion region. Note that CEACAM28 contains two A2 type domains (B). [44] . It was suggested that the activating receptor gene was derived from the gene encoding the inhibitory receptor to counteract a virus that exploits the inhibitory receptor during infection and that this mechanism may apply to many other activating receptors that have inhibitory counterparts [45, 46] . However, recently it was shown for the human SIGLEC5 and SIGLEC14 genes that the direction of gene conversion that generates paired immune receptors is not always the same. This indicates that also other needs drive the evolution of paired receptors like the fine tuning of immune responses [45] . Host-pathogen interactions involving both proteins with ITIM or ITAM signaling motifs have also been reported for humans. The primate-specific CEACAM1-related protein CEACAM3 which contains an N domain closely related to that of CEACAM1 (88% amino acid sequence identity) and a cytoplasmic tail with an ITAM is exclusively expressed in granulocytes. Due to its close relatedness with the ITIM-bearing gonococcal receptor CEACAM1 it can act as decoy receptor for Neisserial pathogens and is able to induce clearance of gonococcal infections by granulocytes. Mutational analyses demonstrated that the cytoplasmic ITAM is instrumental for this process [24] .",

CEACAM28 was probably formed from a CEACAM29 ancestor by a recent gene conversion encompassing the leader and the N exon from CEACAM1. The latter exon encodes the region most instrumental for ligand and pathogen binding in CEACAM molecules. Several findings, presented here, argue for a role of CEACAM28 as a CEACAM1 decoy receptor in the dog. First, the direction of the gene conversion was most likely from the inhibitory receptor to the activating receptor, second, the Ka/Ks ratio of the N domain exons of these family members is indicative for a purifying selection, whereby the specificity of the putative CEACAM1 ligand is probably conserved for CEACAM28, third, the amino acid changes observed for the CEACAM28 N domain most likely have no effect on the structure of that part of the N domain shown to be the pathogen binding site in human and mouse CEACAM1 and fourth, is expressed by immune cells (T, probably B and/or NK cells and granulocytes), a prerequisite for a defense function against a putative pathogen. Based on a highly similar amino acid sequence and expression pattern CEACAM30 can be envisioned to also function, like CEACAM28, as a decoy receptor.",

Most likely, selective pressure by pathogens changes with time. In times where the selective pressure exerted by pathogens on a receptor system is low, Darwinian selection will act and change the specificity of a receptor now possibly recognizing an endogenous ligand. Once the receptor has gained a new function it also can change the signaling properties which may explain why older i.e. more diverged ITAM-bearing receptors e.g. like CEACAM24 and CEACAM29 have lost the ITAM or have gained new splice variants which do not contain an ITAM.",

Comparisons with CEACAM1 from other species identified the cloned canine CEA family member unequivocally as CEACAM1. It is composed of a leader sequence, four extracellular immunoglobulinlike domains (N, A1, B and A2), a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain (Figure 4). The cytoplasmic domain contains an N-terminal ITIM and a C-terminal ITSM motif similar to that found in the long CEACAM1 isoforms of mouse, rat and cattle. According to the nomenclature system for the CEA family, the longest canine CEACAM1 splice variant was designated Genomic arrangement of the human extended Leukocyte Receptor Complex and syntenic relationship of the CEACAM and PSG loci in human, mouse and dog Figure 1 Genomic arrangement of the human extended Leukocyte Receptor Complex and syntenic relationship of the CEACAM and PSG loci in human, mouse and dog.

(A) Relationship of transmembrane domain and hydrophobic GPI signal peptide-encoding exon sequences of human and canine CEA family members. The nucleotide sequences of the transmembrane domain exons and exons encoding the GPI signal peptides of human CEA family members were aligned and the results displayed as rooted dendrogram. Three groups can be discriminated: the transmembrane domain sequences of the orthologous genes (CEACAM18, CEACAM19 and CEACAM20) form pairs, CEACAM3, CEACAM4 and CEACAM21 sequences are clustered together with the dog CEACAM1-related sequences (red box) and the GPI signal sequences are most closely related to the CEACAM1 transmembrane exon sequence (blue box). All transmembrane domain exons boxed red are followed by exons encoding cytoplasmic domains with an ITAM except for CEACAM21 and CEACAM29. Their cytoplasmic domains terminate prematurely due to a stop codon at the end of cytoplasmic domain exon 2 and loss of the splice donor site in cytoplasmic domain exon 3 with subsequent read-through into the following intron, respectively.

DQ975209) differs from CEACAM1-4L mRNA by the absence of the 53 bp nucleotide cytoplasmic domain exon1 that leads to a frame shift and to the use of a TGA stop codon in cytoplasmic domain exon 2 as found for CEACAM1 of other species. Splice variants without the A1 and the B domain designated CEACAM1-2L (GenBank accession no. DQ975210) and CEACAM1-2S (GenBank accession no. DQ975211) also exist as well as two splice variants without IgC-like domains [CEACAM1-1L (Gen-Bank accession no. DQ975212) and CEACAM1-1S (Gen-Bank accession no. DQ975213)]. Furthermore, we have cloned the most abundant full length CEACAM23, CEACAM24, CEACAM25, and CEACAM28 cDNAs. The CEACAM23 cDNA (GenBank accession no. EF137906) corresponds to the longest mRNA splice variant predicted from the genomic sequence of the boxer breed and exhibits an identical nucleotide sequence. CEACAM23 encodes four extracellular Ig-like domains, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail which harbors a typical ITAM motif (N-A1-B-A2-TM-Cyt1-Cyt4; Figure 4). The major CEACAM24 cDNA encodes a protein with an N and a transmembrane domain (GenBank accession no. EF137907). The cytoplasmic domain does not contain the expected ITAM motif due to the presence of the unspliced intron between the predicted cytoplasmic domain exons 3 Exon arrangement of canine CEACAM1-related genes Figure 3 Exon arrangement of canine CEACAM1-related genes.
