We also developed a computerized free-text search to identify clinical notes documenting at least two non-negated ARI symptoms.

Of the 21 additional structured clinical parameters considered, two contributed significantly to ARI detection: new prescriptions for cough remedies and elevations in body temperature to at least 38uC. Together with the diagnostic codes, these parameters increased detection sensitivity to 87%, but specificity and PPV declined to 95% and 25%, respectively. Adding text analysis increased sensitivity to 99%, but PPV dropped further to 14%. Algorithms that required satisfying both a query of structured EMR parameters as well as text analysis disclosed PPVs of 52-68% and retained sensitivities of 69-73%.",

Early electronic surveillance efforts have collected codified diagnoses, chief complaints, school absenteeism, over-the-counter medication sales and other independent data streams to detect the early stages of infectious illnesses, when mild signs and symptoms may not alarm clinicians [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] . While the utility of these pre-diagnostic, so-called ''syndromic'' surveillance systems (SSS) has thus far been less than persuasive, there is now increasing evidence that the electronic transfer of diagnostic test results can lead to more complete and timely reporting of notifiable diseases to the public health authorities [12, 13, 14] . These results encourage the continued search for new approaches aimed at improving the timeliness and usefulness of surveillance alerts.",

Notwithstanding the challenges of protecting patient privacy, an EMR-based surveillance system could also support the efficient flow of information necessary to promptly investigate alerts and manage evolving epidemics [15, 16, 17] . To gain insight into the potential of the EMR as a pre-diagnostic surveillance tool, we asked how information automatically retrieved from a comprehensive EMR could be arranged to detect patients with symptoms suggestive of ARI. More specifically, we hypothesized that structured and freetext clinical entries into the Veterans Administration's (VA) comprehensive EMR could be automatically extracted, transformed and combined to improve ARI detection compared to the sole use of ICD-9 diagnostic codes, a common basic avenue to electronic disease detection.",

A Text-only CDA achieved a higher sensitivity for ILI than its ICD-9-only counterpart ( Table 7 , 92%, CDA 18 vs. 79%, CDA 17) . Despite specificities of 91-96%, both detection approaches yielded PPVs in the 2-3% range.

Case definitions used for influenza surveillance vary widely [18] , reflecting both the variability of influenza's clinical presentation and differing views on what distinguishes an influenza-like illness from other ARI [19, 20] . Absent a standard, we crafted a case definition that would identify a broad population of patients with ARI. Most (78%) of our ARI patients had normal vital signs and thus probably suffered from mild, uncomplicated ARI [21] . Nevertheless, twothird of them felt ill enough to visit urgent or same-day care areas. Thus, the majority of patients who satisfied our case definition were seeking health services despite a mostly mild illness. These patients lie at the crosshair of syndromic surveillance.",

While our observed level of performance may not be duplicated in health systems where diagnostic codes are assigned by non-providers and/or have reimbursement repercussions, our findings reinforce results obtained in adult and pediatric emergency room populations [23, 24] . Note that the ICD-9 code parameter was retained statistically in all of the most successful ARI and ILI detectors, suggesting that diagnostic codes are not made redundant with the availability of a broad array of structured EMR parameters. Our results therefore suggest that ICD-9 codes represent a valuable, perhaps indispensible component of automated ARI detection algorithms, and bolster their widespread use. ",

While these results lend further support to the use of medications-related data elements for biosurveillance [29, 30, 31] , the practical difficulty is to devise database queries that, over time, will continue to reflect the concept of ''cough remedies''. Cough suppressants belong to a variety of drug classes (opioids, non-opioid antitussives, decongestants, antihistamines) that are often variably combined with each other and with other agents to relieve flu-like symptoms.

Our efforts at devising CDAs that target the subset of ARI patients with ILI hint at how fruitful incorporating structured non-ICD-9 EMR parameters may become as disease severity increases. For example, a parsimonious ILI CDA (VA ICD-9 codes AND Temperature .37.8uC, CDA 19) increased PPV by an order of magnitude with little losses in sensitivity compared to its ICD-9 codes-only counterpart. While we acknowledge that an ICD-9 code set optimized for ILI could narrow this performance gap, our observations that more diagnostic tests are ordered with increasing vital signs abnormalities ( Fig. 1 ) raise the prospect that as disease severity increases, so will the value of the structured EMR data.",

Because these practice patterns could change quickly with the emergence or fear of a more severe illness, and for the important situational and logistical insight they may provide during an epidemic, we would certainly retain disease-specific diagnostic and therapeutic EMR entries in ARI CDAs meant for an operational surveillance system.",

            "text": "For surveillance purposes, text analyses have been applied to limited data sources within the EMR, including ''chief complaint'' fields [34, 35, 36, 37, 38] , laboratory or imaging reports [34, 35, 38, 39, 40] or dictated hospital discharge summaries [41, 42] . We are aware of only one published study where ARI surveillance was performed by applying text analysis to the full outpatient notes typed in by the providers themselves [43] . This study illustrated the feasibility of using the full narrative text for surveillance in the ambulatory setting, and showed a temporal correlation between total daily ILI counts obtained using text analysis, queries of structured EMR data, categories of chief complaints or influenza isolates. Our work extends this knowledge in two significant ways. First, our reference review allowed us to provide insight into the performance of free-text mining per se. Despite ongoing challenges with non-standard grammar and abbreviations, spelling mistakes, lack of punctuation, copy-and-pasting, personal templates and checklists, our simple approach to free-text analysis discovered ARI cases with a sensitivity (88%) and a specificity (93%, CDA 10) not dissimilar to what could be reached with structured parameters (e.g. CDA 8) . Second, the relational nature of EMR data allowed us to observe the extent to which free-text and structured data sources could complement each other for case detection. On the one hand, we found that combining the results of the two mining approaches through an ''OR'' logical operand yielded near-perfect sensitivity, albeit at the cost of a much reduced PPV. These results support the common-sense belief that, at least with a disease characterized by relatively mild symptoms, significant information resides exclusively in the provider's note. On the other hand, we found that combining the two approaches through an ''AND'' logical operand could increase PPVs well above 50% while retaining sensitivities in the 70% range (CDAs 15, 16, 22) . These results suggest that cross-validating information obtained from structured data with that obtained from clinical narrative can reduce false-positive findings from either data sources and improve the noise environment through which a surveillance system must operate to uncover disease clusters. Whether or not the achievable gains in signal-to-noise ratio will outweigh the losses in detection sensitivity to improve the overall ability of the surveillance system to detect disease outbreaks will have to be determined empirically.",

Instead, we added common misspellings of negation and search terms (e.g. ''deneis'' instead of ''denies'', ''cocuphing'' instead of ''coughing'') identified during the chart review process. Thus, unencountered misspellings are left out of our final UMLS concept table and negation list; b) our adaptation of the NegEx algorithm is specific to the types of EMR note from only two VA medical centers.

A panel of specialists in pulmonary and infectious diseases arbitrated cases where there was disagreement. Sample size was adjusted so that we could reach ,140 reference ARI cases at each study site, a goal estimated by the need to have sufficient power to perform a regression analysis that included our planned candidate explanatory variables (EpiInfo, Version 2.2, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).",

To determine if concepts identified by the text strings were affirmed or negated, for example whether a patient was ''coughing'' or denied ''coughing'', we used the publicly available NegEx version 2 algorithm [55] . We sought to improve the performance of the native algorithm by iteratively reviewing 10-15% of notes associated with false negative and false positive cases, then correcting problems with negation detection. Reusable text templates and checklists, commonly imported into VA note documents, drove most of the modifications to the NegEx algorithm, which included: 1) adding pre-processing steps to remove extraneous white spaces, carriage returns and line feeds; 2) identifying special characters commonly associated with imported templates (e.g. series of ----------------, ********** to indicate section breaks) or indicating embedded data-mining software objects used to automatically retrieve vital signs or medication lists; 3) identifying headings of templates that often contained a list of non-negated ARI-related strings (e.g. ''Cough Assessment'', ''Clinician Instructions'', ''Problems to Report to Your Doctor'', ''Needed For'', ''Observe For''); 4) modifying the term list used by NegEx for possible negation status (e.g. adding the term ''absent''); 5) using regular expressions to identify non-textual patterns where the concept identified was either affirmed or negated by special characters or abbreviations (e.g. neg, pos, ",
