            "text": "Bats are reservoir animals harboring many important pathogenic viruses and with the capability of transmitting these to humans and other animals. To establish an effective surveillance to monitor transboundary spread of bat viruses between Myanmar and China, complete organs from the thorax and abdomen from 853 bats of six species from two Myanmar counties close to Yunnan province, China, were collected and tested for their virome through metagenomics by Solexa sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. In total, 3,742,314 reads of 114 bases were generated, and over 86% were assembled into 1,649,512 contigs with an average length of 114 bp, of which 26,698 (2%) contigs were recognizable viral sequences belonging to 24 viral families. Of the viral contigs 45% (12,086/26,698) were related to vertebrate viruses, 28% (7,443/26,698) to insect viruses, 27% (7,074/26,698) to phages and 95 contigs to plant viruses. The metagenomic results were confirmed by PCR of selected viruses in all bat samples followed by phylogenetic analysis, which has led to the discovery of some novel bat viruses of the genera Mamastrovirus, Bocavirus, Circovirus, Iflavirus and Orthohepadnavirus and to their prevalence rates in two bat species. In conclusion, the present study aims to present the bat virome in Myanmar, and the results obtained further expand the spectrum of viruses harbored by bats.",

            "text": "Bats, comprising the second largest mammalian population in the world and distributed globally with the exception of the two polar areas, belong to the order Chiroptera with 17 families and 925 species [1] . Bats are important virus reservoir animals and more than 60 viruses have been identified in them with many highly pathogenic to humans [2] , including henipaviruses, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, dengue virus, lyssaviruses and SARS-like coronavirus [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Most recently, Bokeloh and Shimoni bat viruses, circovirus, bocavirus, retrovirus, astrovirus, and Cedar virus have been identified as new bat viruses with some never having been reported in other animals, suggesting that bats could be a large virus bank and breeding ground for viruses [4, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In China, viruses are increasingly being detected in, or isolated from bats, such as coronavirus, circovirus, astrovirus, Xi River virus, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Chikungunya virus, Tuhoko virus, picornavirus, adeno-associated virus and adenovirus [5, 9, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Notably, SARS coronavirus, which has infected more than 8,000 people and killed almost 800 worldwide, has been identified as likely originating from horseshoe bats in China [5, 23, 24] . However, all available studies so far fail to provide a complete understanding of the pathogen ecology of bat populations.",

Yunnan province in China is a main and busy trading route between Southeast Asia and China and shares a long border with Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam. Studies have shown that many viruses, including Nipah virus, JEV, Chikungunya virus, and circovirus, are present in bats in Cambodia, Thailand and Yunnan [9, 17, 18, 35, [38] [39] [40] . To expand these studies to Myanmar, we applied viral metagenomics to determine the virome of bats collected from areas of Myanmar adjoining Yunnan. Results revealed 24 virus families in these bats, including phages and viruses of plants and insects as well as vertebrates. Several viruses of the genera Orthohepadnavirus, Mastadenovirus, Mamastrovirus, and Bocavirus, have been characterized as new viruses. This work has expanded our knowledge of bat viruses and their geodistribution in Southeast Asia and could be helpful in establishing effective surveillance of wildlife-associate zoonoses. ",

Members of the Alloherpesviridae, Herpesviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Papillomaviridae, Parvovirinae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae and Picornaviridae were likely common viruses harbored by bats since at least 3 of the 4 groups contained their sequences in viral contigs. These contigs relating to mastadenovirus, circovirus, dependovirus, bocavirus, parvovirus, mamastrovirus, kobuvirus, iflavirus, had strong BLAST bit to viruses with bit score .200 and e value ,10e220. Notably, there were .10 thousand contigs relating to Hepadnaviridae, which covered 43% full genome and shared .70% nt identity with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) and human hepatitis B virus (HBV). Herpesvirus-like contigs had diverse nt identities to known viruses, the longest reads with 210 nt sharing the highest nt identity of 70% with human herpesvirus 6B (data not shown). In the present study, ictalurivirus-, poxvirus-, polyomavirus-, papillomavirus-and hepacivirus-like sequences were not only annotated to viruses but also share nt/aa identities with some cellular organisms, probably as a result of integration of viral genes into their hosts or host genes into viral genomes since large DNA viruses have ability to acquire cellular genes over the course of their evolution [42] [43] [44] [45] . Therefore, to confirm the presence of above large DNA viruses PCR detection and sequencing of longer fragments at multiple viral genomic regions is needed in the future.",

For example, the sequences of phage in bat guano from California and Texas respectively accounted for 4% and 0.1% of the total reads [37] , while phage sequences constituted .60% of the total in previously reported bat fecal samples in China [35] . In the present study, three phage families, Myoviridae, Podoviridae and Siphoviridae, were detected as being harbored by all four groups of bats, constituting 4% viral contigs in group XM, 2% in XO, 31% in WM and 1% in WO. In groups XM, XO and WO, the family Podoviridae was the most abundant, accounting for 48%, 93% and 87% of the total phage-like contigs respectively, while in WM the family Myoviridae was dominant, constituting 80% of phage-like contigs within the group. The wide prevalence of these three phage families in all 4 groups likely reflects the common infection status of phages in the gut bacterial microecosystems of bats in these areas.",

In our study 35 and 22 contigs relating to genus Mamastrovirus were obtained from groups XM and WO respectively (Table 3) , but none from the other two groups. Testing of all bat lungs and guts by hemi-nested PCR using pan-bat astroviruses primers targeting a 422 nt fragment of ORF1b provided confirmation, resulting in 12 and 2 positive amplifications in guts of groups XM and WO respectively. The positive rate in Miniopterus fuliginosus was 4% (12/ 320). In group WO, only Rhinolophus ferrumequinum showed positive amplification in 2% (2/84) of samples, while all other bat species were negative. Of 15 amplicons, 8 (Accession numbers: JX863704-JX863711) were further sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed against representative astroviruses of all 19 species of Mamastroviruses based on the nt sequences. Results ( Figure 1 ) showed that the taxonomic tree of the 19 species of Mamastroviruses based on a partial ORF1b gene was the same as that based on ORF2. Bat astroviruses detected in this study, however, could be further grouped into two branches with 57-63% nt identity between them. Of these, BatAstv XMM137 amplified from M. fuliginosus in county Sedon shared the highest identity of 69% with Mamastrovirus 14 found in bats from Hong Kong [12] , and was likely a new Mamastrovirus species according to new ICTV criteria [48] . It was therefore tentatively classified as Mamastrovirus-related virus 1. The remaining 7 amplicons with 68-76% nt shared identity comprised a new group, and shared the highest nt identity (67-75%) with Mamastrovirus 18 found in Hong Kong bats [12] . These sequences constituted at least one new Mamastrovirus species according to new ICTV criteria, and were therefore classified as Mamastrovirus-related virus 2 [48] .",

In this viral metagenomic analysis, bocavirus sequence was detected in groups XM and WM, but not in XO and WO (Table 3 ). The finding by specific PCR of a partial VP1 ORF gene sequence using degenerated primers designed based on available bocavirus sequences in GenBank was consistent with the metagenomic analysis, and analysis of all bat samples further showed that 2% (6/320) of guts of M. fuliginosus in XM and 6% (20/320) of M. fuliginosus in WM were bocavirus positive (Table 1 ). Ten amplicons (five from each group, accession numbers: JX863718 -JX863727) with lengths of 620 nt were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed against representative sequences of bocaviruses identified to date. Results showed that the newly identified bat bocaviruses were significantly divergent from known bocaviruses, with 39-53% aa identity. The highest aa identity (53%) observed was with canine minute virus and only 43% aa identity with M. myotis bocavirus, the first bat bocavirus found in China [10] (Figure 3B ). Further phylogenetic analysis clustered our ten sequences into two independent groups. The highest amino acid identity between two groups was 85%, while that within a group was 97% ( Figure 3B ). This indicates the discovery of two new bocavirus species from bats. To further characterize the bocaviruses, nearly full length genomic sequences of Bt BoV XM30 in group 1 and Bt BoV WM40 in group 2 were obtained by gene walking. As shown in figure 3A , the genomes of Bt BoV XM30 with an incomplete 59 end (accession number: KC339250) and Bt BoV WM40 (accession number: KC339251) were 4,832 and 4,995 nt containing four ORFs: NS1, NP1, VP1 and VP2. ( Figure 3A ). The aa sequences of NS1 were used to construct the phylogenetic tree with other representatives ( Figure 3C ). Multiple alignments showed that Bt BoV XM30 and WM40 shared 76% aa identity, with 35-54% aa and 44-56% nt identities with other bocaviruses. The highest (54%) aa identity was with canine bocavirus HK882U but only 40% to Myotis myotis bocavirus 1, with the same results obtained by analysis of VP1 (data not shown).",

Further screening of all lungs and guts of bat samples by PCR of a partial hexon gene sequence of mammalian adenovirus (767 nt) confirmed that this sequence existed in guts of R. ferrumequinum of group WO but none of the other 3 groups. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that this bat adenovirus, given the name WOR1 (accession number: JX863729), is divergent from current mammalian adenoviruses with 40-55% aa identity and with only 55% and 53% aa identities with bat adenovirus TJM strain from Tianjin, China, and bat adenovirus 2 strain PPV1 from Germany respectively ( Figure 5 ) [22, 53] .

CVs were first discovered in American bats in 2010 and in Chinese bats in 2011 [9, 37] . In the present study, only group XO contained CV contigs (Table 3) . Further PCR confirmed this result and found that 7% (6/92) of guts of R. ferrumequinum in group XO were circovirus positive. Two complete genomes (BtCV XOR1, BtCV XOR7; accession numbers JX863737 and KC339249 respectively) were amplified by inverse PCR. Sequencing revealed that BtCV XOR1 and XOR7 DNAs were respectively 1,862 nt and 1798 nt in length and contained two ORFs in opposite strands ( Figure 6A , Table 4 ). As in other CVs, the two bat CVs had a stem-loop structure between the two ORFs with nonamer motif TAGTATTAC and TAGTATTAC, identical to that of canine CV strain NY214 (JQ821392), beak and feather disease virus, and finch CV ( Figure 6B ) (23, 32) . Moreover, three tandem copies of CGGCACA of BtCV XOR1, thought to bind the replicase when the viral DNA starts to replicate by the rolling-circle method, were present at nt 1862-26 with the highest identity to porcine CV-1 and -2 (PCV-1 and PCV-2). The tandem copies in BtCV XOR7, however, were shorter, consisting of the hexamer CGGCAG (Table 4) .",

Our results showed that about 2% (26,698/1,649,512) of total contigs were virus-related sequences. However, in previous viromes, the proportions of virus-related sequences in total reads or contigs ranged from 0.1%-58% [10, [35] [36] [37] . Of note is that 45% of viral contigs in our virome classified to vertebrate viruses, while insect viruses and phages constituted only 28% and 27% of viral contigs respectively (Table 3 ). This compares with less than 10% of total viral contigs related to vertebrate viruses in previous viral metagenomes of bats [10, [35] [36] [37] . In addition, among 24 viral families identified here, 54% (13 families) were mammalian viruses, much higher and broader than the rates reported in previous virome studies. This difference may be ascribed to the sample type: various organ tissue samples of all bats, along with intestine contents, were used in our study, while the samples used in previous studies were only feces or feces plus oral and pharyngeal swabs [10, [35] [36] [37] . Mammalian viruses require replication in host cells, with some, but not all, being excreted into the environment through the fecal and/or oral routes. Moreover, excretion of many viruses is intermittent, and therefore the virome obtained from excreted or secreted materials may not represent the complete viral complement of the host. Consequently, mixed tissue samples are likely to provide a more complete virome profile. For instance, since hepadnaviruses are strictly blood-borne viruses and normally not secreted through the fecal and oral routes, this could be the reason why previous metagenomic studies have not found Hepadnaviridae in any bat species. In the present study, sampling of bat livers may have permitted successful identification of a bat hepadnavirus. The fact that this constituted the largest population of mammalian viral sequences ( Table 3 ) additionally indicates that bats are potential reservoirs of hepadnaviruses.",

In addition, even the same species had a different viral constitution in different locations. For example, M. fuliginosus harbored astrovirus in Sedon, but not in Wutao; R. ferrumequinum harbored only CV in Sedon, but Astv, Adv and AVV in Wutao. These data show that bat virome varies among species and geo-locations, indicating that a complex viral ecology exists in the bat population.

In our virome study, contigs of Ectropis obliqua and Perina nuda insect viruses were detected only in M. fuliginosus of both XM and WM groups, suggesting that these bats frequently prey on these insects. The most likely explanation for the presence of plant viruses such as tospovirus and cucumovirus in some samples is that the bats prey on insects that feed on plants.

Members of the family Hepadnaviridae have a narrow host range and can infect rodents, primates and birds, but have never before been reported in bats [48, 61] . In the present study, hepadnavirus-like contigs were the second largest population, and showed a genetic similarity to WHV and HBV. PCR and sequencing of a partial S gene sequence showed that the bat hepadnavirus identified here had approximately equal identity with WHV and HBV, strongly suggesting that it should be classified as a new species in genus Orthohepadnavirus.",

These viruses have also been found in some avian species causing immumosuppression and growth retardation [62] [63] [64] [65] . However, a viral metagenomics analysis of bat guano in North America first identified their presence in bats [37] . Since then, CVs have been commonly found in bats and have shown a large genetic diversity [9, 10, 35] . According to ICTV criteria, BtCV XOR1, observed in this study, should be a new species since it shares ,60% aa identity with known circoviruses [48] . Topologically, the known bat circoviruses are grouped into genera Circovirus and Cyclovirus, with some having higher similarities to other animal circoviruses than to bat circoviruses ( Figure 6C ). For example, BtCV XOR1 in our study shared the highest (56% aa) identity with canine CV (No.JQ821392), and only 48% identity with BtCV YN-BtCV-2 (No. JF938079). The large genomic diversity of bat circoviruses suggests that co-evolution of the viruses could occur in bats.",

The genetically diverse mamastroviruses consisted of 6 species in 2009 [73] , but since the first bat Astv report in 2008 [12] identification of numerous new Astvs had expanded the list to 19 species by 2011, with 7 relating to bats [48] .

Our results, together with previous studies [10, [35] [36] [37] , show that the composition of bat viromes differs depending on geographical location and bat species. Current bat viromes have therefore uncovered only the tip of the iceberg as regards virus flora present in these mammals, and future studies involving a wider sampling of bat species in different locations will undoubtedly increase our understanding of the global diversity of bat viruses. However, most of the new viruses found in bats by metagenomic analysis have very low identity with known viruses and their direct transmission to cause diseases of humans and domestic animals is unknown. To determine the tropism restrictions and pathogenicity of these new mammalian viruses, routine virological approaches, such viral isolation and characterization by tissue culture and experimental infection, will still be necessary.",

All bats were collected from habitats in two Myanmar counties, Sedon and Wutao, which are close to Tengchong county of Yunnan. The organs of the thorax and abdomen of each bat were separately collected and stored at 220uC. The predominant species sampled was M. fuliginosus and all bat samples were separated into the following 4 groups based on their location and species: XM (M. fuliginosus from Sedon), XO (the remaining 3 species from Sedon), WM (M. fuliginosus from Wutao) and WO (the remaining 5 species from Wutao) (table 1). The collection and sampling of bats for this study was approved by the Administrative Committee on Animal Welfare of the Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China.",
