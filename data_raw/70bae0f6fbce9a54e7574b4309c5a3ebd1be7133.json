CHIKV being an emerging arthropod-borne pathogenic virus, is a public health concern worldwide. No vaccines or specific antiviral treatment is currently available for chikungunya disease. Thus, it is important to develop inhibitors against CHIKV enzymes to block key steps in viral reproduction. In view of this, CVCP was produced recombinantly and purified to homogeneity. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based proteolytic assay was developed for high throughput screening (HTS). A FRET peptide substrate (DABCYL-GAEEWSLAIE-EDANS) derived from the cleavage site present in the structural polyprotein of CVCP was used. The assay with a Z' factor of 0.64 and coefficient of variation (CV) is 8.68% can be adapted to high throughput format for automated screening of chemical libraries to identify CVCP specific protease inhibitors. Kinetic parameters K m and k cat /K m estimated using FRET assay were 1.26 \u00b1 0.34 \u03bcM and 1.11 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 sec \u22121 respectively. The availability of active recombinant CVCP and cost effective fluorogenic peptide based in vitro FRET assay may serve as the basis for therapeutics development against CHIKV.",

After autoproteolysis and the release of CP from structural polyprotein, Trp261 remains bound near the active site and makes the protein further inactive for either cis or trans proteolytic action. However, previous studies on alphavirus CP indicate that the activity of CP is restored on removal of the conserved C-terminal tryptophan residue 38, 39 . So, in order to evaluate the enzymatic activity of CVCP, both inactive and active proteins were expressed and purified. Firstly, the protease domain of CVCP was cloned into pET28c vector to form the expression plasmid pET28c-CVCP. The inactive protein contains the full protease domain (106-261 residues). Truncation of the last two residues including C-terminal Trp261 from the inactive construct results in generation of the active form of CVCP (106-259 residues). The optimization of expression conditions was done for both the proteins to get good amount of soluble protein. After optimization of induction temperature, induction time and IPTG concentration, both the proteins having the 6X-His tag at the N-terminus were expressed in the soluble form.",

The in vitro trans-protease activity of CVCP was monitored using the peptide substrate containing 4-(4-dimethylaminophenyl-azo)benzoic acid (DABCYL) and 5-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (EDANS) at the N-and C-terminus of the peptide respectively. This pair demonstrates FRET in which EDANS acts as fluorophore and DABCYL as quencher that quenches the fluorescence produced by EDANS. In the presence of protease, the peptide gets cleaved, which separates the two fragments and reduces the FRET signal. The active CVCP exhibits the efficient cleavage of the substrate peptide, which separates EDANS (fluorophore) and DABCYL (quencher) resulting in the increased fluorescence signal. The fluorescence was quenched before the proteolytic cleavage due to the presence of DABCYL within a particular distance range from the fluorophore EDANS (Fig. 3A) . The proteolytic reaction was carried out in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) in cuvette (1 ml reaction volume) as well as in 96-well plate (100 \u03bc l reaction volume). The substrate was added to start the reaction and the fluorescence enhancement was recorded with time (Fig. 3B) . The relative fluorescence units were calculated for all the readings. Figure 3B shows the typical fluorescence profile for the hydrolysis of the substrate. A control reaction was also performed using the same reaction without enzyme, which did not show change in the fluorescence intensity (data not shown).",

The graph shows a regular pattern of enzymatic reaction, which is optimum at pH 7.0 (Fig. 5A) .

The non-infectious CHIKV replicon having reporter gene and the cell based phenotypic assay for nsP2 inhibitors of CHIKV have also opened up the possibilities for antiviral screening 45, 46 . However, the follow up studies are missing. Also, the lack of an in vitro assay for antiviral screening studies promotes us towards more detailed understanding and development of newer methods for anti-CHIKV compounds screening. A few antiviral drugs have been developed in the last decade 47 , however, viruses are evolving rapidly and more are emerging in different areas. There is a lack of effective therapies against very important viruses. The re-emergence of CHIKV as an epidemic in a number of different regions 4-6 , the addition in the mosquito vector due to the evolution of virus (mutation in E1 glycoprotein) 12 and the pathogenicity of virus including persistent arthralgia 1 makes it a significant pathogen which needs proper attention. Hence, there is the necessity of anti-CHIKV drug development and efficient therapeutic protocol manifestation. Though the mortality rate for Chikungunya infection is not so high, the high evolution rate in the genome of CHIKV encourages us for the development of new promising antivirals and therapeutics against CHIKV.",

For the general assessment of the assay quality and reliability, the Z' factor and the coefficient of variation were determined in a 96 well plate and found to be 0.64 and 8.68% respectively. As demonstrated by the values of Z' factor and CV in this study, the FRET based in vitro proteolytic assay of CVCP is highly convenient and suitable for the HTS of the compounds. The assay might provide a perfect approach to explore first generation CVCP inhibitors. Using a fluorescence plate reader, this assay can be easily performed in a 96-and 384-well plate format for high throughput inhibitor screening against the CVCP. This high throughput protease assay is simple, convenient and cost effective. Few compounds were screened for the inhibition of the CVCP activity. The tryptophan, tryptamine compounds and peptides EW, EWS could not inhibit CVCP activity. Additionally, different serine protease inhibitors PMSF, benzamidine, TPCK and 3-acetylindole also did not seem to act as potent inhibitors of CVCP. This is consistent with the previous reports for the cis-autoproteolytic activity of CVCP and the trans-esterase activity of SFCP where complete resistance to the standard serine protease inhibitors was observed. The cis-autoproteolytic activity of the CVCP was not inhibited by serine protease inhibitor AEBSF (4-(2-Aminoethyl) benzene sulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) 53 . Additionally, the trans esterase activity of the SFCP did not show inhibition in the presence of the protease inhibitor PMSF, chloromethylketones (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-leucine-tyrosine-chloromethylketon and N-benzyloxycarbonylphenylalanine-chloromethylketone) and N-acetyl-glutamate-glutamate-tryptophan p-nitro-anilide 38 . Hence, it is possible that substrate specificity pockets of CVCP have a distinct conformation as seen in the crystal structure of active AVCP (PDB ID: 4UON) in which Pro215 obtrude to block Trp267 position 39 .",

In this respect, pH range, different NaCl and glycerol concentrations were used for the measurement of the activity and the relative activity was calculated. The optimum enzyme activity was found at pH 7.0 and 100 mM NaCl concentration. The optimum pH is neutral pH which corresponds to the pH of the mosquito saliva and the human cells. Thus, the optimal activity occurs at the physiological pH 7.0 to match with the host cell pH. The effect of pH on the enzyme activity might be due to the conformational variations in the enzyme structure at different pHs. Additionally, the response of the enzymatic activity with increasing ionic strength indicates the dependence of the protease structure on the salt concentration. The significant increase in enzymatic activity up to 100 mM NaCl concentration might be due to the stabilization of the enzyme with increasing ionic strength, however, the decrease in activity above 100 mM NaCl might be the result of alteration in molecular interaction at the active site or the specificity pocket at high NaCl concentration. The increase in ionic strength might disrupt ionic and polar interactions in the structure of CVCP leading to conformational changes in the active site.",

            "text": "The anti-chaotropic agent glycerol also affects enzyme function. Glycerol can be added up to 20% to the reaction buffer in the CVCP protease assay reaction. In general, glycerol acts as the stabilizing agent for the protein and is not expected to reduce the enzymatic activity. Interestingly, at 50% concentration of the glycerol in the reaction buffer, there is complete loss of the CVCP enzymatic activity. It might be due to the binding of glycerol molecule in the S 1 specificity pocket of CVCP that could block entry of the substrate inside the pocket and thus, inhibit catalytic reaction. To explore this possibility, the three dimensional structure of active CVCP was predicted by homology modeling based on the crystal structure of active AVCP (PDB ID: 4UON). CVCP molecular model consists of a chymotrypsin-like serine protease fold with two subdomains and the active site is located at the interface of the subdomains (Fig. 6B) . In CVCP, the active site is contributed by His139, Asp161 and Ser213 residues. The S 1 specificity pocket is present near the active site to which the conserved P 1 substrate residue Trp261 is expected to bind. Furthermore, the superimposition of the homology model of active CVCP in complex with glycerol onto the native AVCP (inactive AVCP, PDB ID: 4AGK) (RMSD = 0.127 \u00c5) shows interaction of glycerol molecule exactly at the same position where conserved P 1 tryptophan residue binds in the S 1 specificity pocket (Fig. 6C) . The S 1 specificity pocket of CVCP includes residues Trp189, Ile203 to Ser213, Ile227 to Asn233, and Thr238 to Leu240. These residues create a hydrophobic environment for the binding of substrate. The glycerol molecule fits perfectly inside this hydrophobic pocket in active CVCP structure. The hydroxyl groups of glycerol molecule show interactions with the backbone of Lys209 and also with the active site residue Ser213. In the crystal structure of active AVCP (PDB ID: 4UON), glycerol was used as a cryoprotectant during data collection and was assumed to stabilize the protein by binding to the S 1 pocket 39 . Hence, it can be concluded from the activity assay results coupled with the structural comparison and analysis that at high concentrations glycerol might be competing with the substrate peptide for binding to the S 1 specificity pocket of CVCP.",

The use of excess enzyme ensures the rapid and complete cleavage of the substrate. The curve between the relative fluorescence units (RFU) (fluorescence of the reaction minus the fluorescence obtained with the reaction in the absence of enzyme) and the varying substrate concentration was plotted. The slope of the curve was calculated which is assigned as the FEC for the substrate peptide.",

These compounds were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO) and the custom synthesized peptides were procured from Biolinkk Pvt. Ltd, Delhi. The stock solutions of 10 mM were made in 100% DMSO, and the required final concentrations of inhibitors were made by dilution in assay buffer. The concentrations of DMSO in the final reactions did not exceed 1.0% (v/v). The substrate was used at a final concentration of 1 \u03bc M to minimize the inner filter effect and to produce strong signal. The active CVCP was pre-incubated with the compounds for 30 min followed by addition of substrate peptide. The concentration of compounds used was 50-100 \u03bc M in the final assay volume of 100 \u03bc l.

The DABCYL (Quencher) and EDANS (fluorophore) are attached at the N and C terminus of the peptide respectively. The donor EDANS produces the signal upon excitation that gets quenched by DABCYL and thus shows FRET. In the presence of protease, the cleavage takes place and the fluorophore and quencher gets separated from each other, which results in the reduction of FRET signal. In the presence of protease inhibitors, the FRET should remain unaltered. (B) In vitro trans proteolytic assay was performed in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0 buffer and the fluorescence was measured at different time points. The fluorescence was measured till 5 hrs and the increase in fluorescence was observed. All the values are the average of triplicate data. The values were normalized using the reaction performed in the similar conditions with no enzyme. (C) To perform the kinetic studies of CVCP, different concentrations of the substrate ranging from 0.6 \u03bc M to 16 \u03bc M were used and initial velocities were calculated for all substrate concentrations. The kinetic data were fitted into the Michealis-Menten equation. (D)",

The rate of CVCP proteolytic activity was determined by measuring the increase in fluorescence intensity of enzymatic reactions conducted in a 1 ml fluorescence cuvette or a 96-well black microplate (Corning Inc., USA). The reactions were performed in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 with varied concentration of substrate for the kinetic measurements. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 \u03bc M enzyme from a concentrated stock, and were monitored continuously over a time period of approximately 15 to 300 min. All reactions were performed at 25 \u00b0C in temperature-controlled conditions. The fluorescence was monitored at 490 nm with the excitation wavelength of 340 nm using Fluorolog-3 Spectrofluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon) or Cytation 3, the fluorescence microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). The enhancement in the fluorescence readings due to the cleavage of peptide substrate leading to dissociation of FRET pair and decrease in energy transfer was observed with time. Cuvette based assays were conducted using quartz cuvettes with a pathlength of 1.00 cm in a reaction volume of 1 ml. The emission spectra were recorded and scanned from 440 to 600 nm with 1 nm bandwidth. The inner filter effect was negligible as the fluorescence measurements were carried out using low concentrations of fluorogenic peptide Scientific RepoRts | 5:14753 | DOi: 10.1038/srep14753",
