Viral particles in AM were detected by electron microscopy in 7 of 12 SARS patients with high HRCT score. On day 90, HRCT scores improved significantly in 10 of 12 patients, with normalization of BALF cell counts in 6 of 12 patients with repeat bronchoscopy.

SARS-associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the causative agent [2] . Typical clinical manifestations include fever, cough, dyspnea and rapid progression of pulmonary infiltration or consolidation [3] . The mean mortality rate is 9.6% [1], mostly attributed to hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the acute phase, typical pathological findings in the lungs include mononuclear cells infiltration, alveolar cell desquamation and hyaline membrane formation [4] . Those mononuclear cells may develop into multinucleated giant cells [4] . Proinflammatory cytokines released by alveolar macrophages may play a prominent role in the pathogenesis in SARS [5] . Marked elevation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12, of the Th1 cytokine, IFN-\u03b3, and of chemokines IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and IFN-\u03b1induced protein-10 (IP-10) have been reported [6] . High resolution Computed tomography (HRCT) findings at presentation include as unilateral or bilateral groundglass opacities or focal unilateral or bilateral areas of consolidation [7] [8] [9] . Such residual abnormalities have been described also after discharge from hospital at 36.5 days and at 6-months [10, 11] . However, limited information is available on recovery of inflammatory abnormalities during recovery from SARS, particularly at 60 days and beyond..",

The extent of involvement of each abnormality was assessed independently for each of three zones: upper (above the carina), middle (below carina up to the inferior pulmonary vein), and lower (below the inferior pulmonary vein). Each lung zone (total of 6 lung zones) was assigned a score, modified from previously described [9] , based on the following: 0 when no involvement, 1 when <25% involvement, 2 when 25 <50% involvement; 3 when 50% <75% involvement and 4 when 75% involvement. Summation of scores provided overall lung involvement (maximal CT score 24). The grading of the patient's chest radiograph and HRCT was the consensus of two observers who were blind to clinical information of the patients.",

These inflammatory responses may be elicited by the persistent presence of coronavirus in alveolar macrophages, since the patients with the highest HRCT changes had coronaviruses present and there was no evidence of bacterial or other viral infection in these patients.",

The most striking features of alveolar inflammation in patients were increased numbers of alveolar macrophages, T lymphocytes and NK cells, with a striking decrease in CD4/CD8 ratio. The HRCT score was highly correlated with T lymphocyte numbers and their subpopulations, and was inversely related to CD4/CD8 ratio. CD8+ T cells may act as cytotoxic cells and are key effectors of virus clearance [20] . The concurrent increase in CD4+ T cells may promote the clonal expansion of virusspecific CD8+ T cells and is essential for maintaining continued CD8+ T cells surveillance and effector capacity [19] .",

The CXC-chemokines, such as IL-8 or GRO-\u03b1, are major neutrophil chemoattractants [23] . MIG/CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 9 and IP-10/ CXCL10, both inducible by interferon-\u03b3, are ELR-negative CXC chemokines and are potent chemoattractants for mononuclear cells, specifically activated T lymphocytes and NK cells [24] . In this report, we demonstrated elevated levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, MCP-1, RANTES and IL-8 in BAL fluid in SARS patients compared to those of normal subjects. Increased secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 may be derived from virus-infected macrophages or from CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, and these cytokines may promote T-lymphocyte extravasation and macrophage activation [19] , but such processes may not be sufficient on their own to recruit and activate mononuclear cells in virus-infected lungs. The increased levels of MCP-1 and RANTES in BAL fluid of all SARS patients may be responsible for the generation of mononuclear infiltrates observed after coronavirus infection. IP-10 and MIG, whose levels are also increase in SARS patients, recruit monocytes and macrophages, NK cells and activated, but not resting T lymphocytes [25, 26] .",

However, IL-8 production can be induced by measles virus infection of fibroblasts [28] and by influenza A virus, RSV and rhinovirus in pulmonary epithelial cells or AM [28] [29] [30] [31] .
