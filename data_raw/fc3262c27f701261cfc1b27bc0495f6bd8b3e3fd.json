            "text": "Q\u03b2 is a positive (+) single-stranded RNA bacteriophage covered by a 25 nm icosahedral shell. Q\u03b2 belongs to the family of Leviviridae and is found throughout the world (bacterial isolates and sewage). The genome of Q\u03b2 is about 4.2 kb, coding for four proteins. This genome is surrounded by 180 copies of coat proteins (capsomers) each comprised of 132 residues of amino acids. The other proteins, the subunit II (\u03b2) of a replicase, the maturation protein (A 2 ) and the read-through or minor coat protein (A 1 ), play a key role in phage infection. With the replicase protein, which lacks proofreading activity, as well as its short replication time, and high population size, Q\u03b2 phage has attractive features for in vitro evolution. The A 1 protein gene shares the same initiation codon with the coat protein gene and is produced during translation when the coat protein's UGA stop codon triplet (about 400 nucleotides from the initiation) is suppressed by a low level of ribosome misincorporation of tryptophan. Thus, A 1 is termed the read-through protein. This RNA phage platform technology not only serves to display foreign peptides but is also exceptionally suited to address questions about in vitro evolution. The C-terminus of A 1 protein confers to this RNA phage platform an exceptional feature of not only a linker for foreign peptide to be displayed also a model for evolution. This platform was used to present a peptide library of the G-H loop of the capsid region P1 of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) called VP1 protein. The library was exposed on the exterior surface of Q\u03b2 phages, evolved and selected with the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) SD6 of the FMDV. These hybrid phages could principally be good candidates for FMDV vaccine development. Separately, the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) epitopes was fused with the A 1 proteins and exposed on the Q\u03b2 phage exterior surface. The engineered phages with MPER epitopes were recognized by anti-MPER specific antibodies. This system could be used to overcome the challenge of effective presentation of MPER to the immune system. A key portion of this linear epitope could be randomized and evolved with the Q\u03b2 system. Overall, antigens and epitopes of RNA viruses relevant to public health can be randomized, evolved and selected in pools using the proposed Q\u03b2 model to overcome their plasticity and the challenge of vaccine development. Major epitopes of a particular virus can be engineered or displayed on the Q\u03b2 phage surface and used for vaccine efficacy evaluation, thus avoiding the use of live viruses.",

There are many different alterations of genetic elements occurring during RNA genome replication [1, 2] . This plasticity is fundamental and caused by infidelity of the replication process [3, 4] . Evolution of RNA viruses is basically unpredictable due to the stochastic nature of the mutation and recombination events, as well as environmental factors. A fundamental concern regarding RNA viruses is their high mutation rate [2, 5] . RNA viruses exist as quasispecies which are the result of pressure, mutation, and selection, in ways which are poorly understood. These mutations could affect the binding capability of the virus to both neutralizing antibodies and host receptors which could result in emergence of new viral host ranges [6] . The chance that defined molecules may promote selection of escape mutants or a particular detection tool may fail to detect the virus is high.",

Unfortunately, these fail to address RNA viruses. This is largely due to the vast number of circulating quasispecies associated with RNA pathogens. The dynamics of viral quasispecies mandates careful consideration. In reality, prevention and therapy of infection due to an RNA virus should rely on multicomponent vaccines and antiviral agents that address the complexity of the RNA quasispecies mutant spectra.

RNA virus replication, particularly RNA phage was found to be the perfect model system for evolutionary investigation [16] . The life cycle of RNA virus was extremely short in time with a very high number of progenies per cycle making them the perfect candidates for this kind of work. Moreover, the genetic variation processes between offspring and parent were observed and due to occasional errors. The errors were found to be the result of enzymatic machinery that lacks the proofreading repair activities during replication, explaining the difference between parent and offspring [17, 18] . One of the major consequences of the lack of correction of errors during RNA replication is the existence of viruses as a complex population with a dynamic distribution of related genomes called quasispecies, by Manfred Eigen. The theory of Eigen shows that the target of selection includes not just the fastest growing replicator (replicon), but also a spectrum of mutants, which are evaluated as a single entity, the \"quasispecies\" and a model system of the first form of life on earth [13] .",

To be claimed perfect, a copy has to be much closer to the master. For RNA viruses, the term population was assigned to wild type and not limited to a single genome with defined sequence [14] . The step from the RNA replication to the live virus shows the persistence in the environment of the surviving population, meaning mutation can be the consequence of environmental factors [15] . The permanent interaction between viral population and the environment can generate long-term variants or survival quasispecies, which can be subjected to continuous mutation and competition for resources [16] and survive (\"Survival of fittest\" of Darwin).

The variation rate increases with the reduced genome size [17] . The adaptation potential of RNA viruses (RNA phages in particular) can be exploited for in vitro evolutionary biotechnology. Recently, plasmid variants and derivatives with the full cDNA of the RNA coliphage Q\u03b2 were obtained with plasmid pBR322 [18] , which produced Q\u03b2 phage after being transformed into Escherichia coli HB101 The subsequent construction of the vector could be used to insert foreign functional protein genes. The stable recombinant plasmid would be expressed in order to display a pool (library) of hybrid phages exposing the foreign proteins on the phage surface. The most adapted variant phages can then be concentrated and selected by panning which is an artificial selection against a known target [19] . In our recently developed biopanning, parameters of the natural pressure can be mimicked and adjusted, therefore generating the most adapted variants important for this in vitro evolution work.",

            "text": "The phage display technique has mostly been applied using the M13 phage which contains a single-stranded circular DNA genome with 6407 nucleotides [20, 21] . The M13 display system is however a DNA replication system with very low mutation rates, which prevent and negatively affect a rapid evolution and adaptation of display biomolecules [22, 23] . The polymerase of the RNA viruses (e.g., the replicase of Q\u03b2) lack the proofreading activity and for this reason the mutation rates of these RNA viruses greatly exceed those of DNA counterparts [22, 24, 25] . Q\u03b2 RNA phages possess very attractive features including high mutation rates, high population and short replication time all of which can be exploited for this study [26, 27] . Found throughout the world in bacterial isolates associated with sewage and animal feces, Q\u03b2 phages are small positive-stranded RNA viruses infecting E. coli [23, 24] . Each infectious Q\u03b2 virion is about 25 nm in diameter. Q\u03b2 is made up of four genes within the 4220 nucleotides genome encoding the subunit II (\u03b2) of replicase, a major coat protein, a maturation protein A 2 and the read-through or minor coat protein A 1 [24] . The main difference between Q\u03b2 and another RNA phage in the same family, the MS2 phage, lies in the minor coat protein, which is the key target in this study [28, 29] . The phage Q\u03b2 genome is surrounded by an icosahedral shell of 178 coat protein molecules (capsomers) and two additional capsomers are internal and associated with genomic RNA [26] . Each capsomer is comprised of 132 amino acids. A capsomer is made up of a five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet \"core\", a hairpin and two contiguous \u03b2-helices on the outside [28, 30] . These capsomers are linked together by disulfide bonds in covalent pentamers and hexamers with a stoichiometric ratio of 12:20 and a well-known crystal structure [31] . The A 1 protein shares the same initiation codon with the coat protein and is produced during translation when the coat protein's UGA stop codon triplet (about 400 nucleotides from the initiation) is suppressed by a low level of ribosome misincorporation of tryptophan [10, 21] (Figure 1 ). The development and achievement of this Q\u03b2 display system was based on some features and known functions of the genome and proteins of the phage described here. icosahedral shell of 178 coat protein molecules (capsomers) and two additional capsomers are internal and associated with genomic RNA [26] .

The Q\u03b2 virion contains only one copy of the 48.55 kDa maturation protein A 2 . Although the A 2 protein is insoluble in an isolated form, it remains soluble when fused to maltose-binding protein or MBP [30, 32] . Crystallography reveals a four-molecular structure, of a highly elongated shape, about 50 \u00c5 in width and 110 \u00c5 in length. Resembling a bow, half of the protein is built of four \u03b1 helices while the other half contains \u03b2 strands, both are located on opposite ends of the molecule. There are two distinct positive charged areas in the \u03b1-helical portion, their identified function will be uncovered below.",

Bernhardt and colleagues found that A 2 blocks the synthesis of murein precursors in vivo by inhibiting MurA which is the catalyst of the committed step of murein biosynthesis [34] . The expression of MurA or induction of a murAclone delays lysis or completely abolishes lysis respectively [34] . In a study conducted by Karnik and Billeter, overexpression of A 2 was shown to trigger cell lysis [12] . Karnik and Billeter cloned complete and partial (mutated and non-mutated) Q\u03b2 sequences [35] . In cells containing plasmids for the full Q\u03b2 genome and A 2 , phage production increased 100-fold over cells with the Q\u03b2 genome plasmid only.

It does this by hydrolyzing the power of GTP into GDP + inorganic phosphate. It also plays a role in the accuracy of translation. After hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, the GDP-bound EF-Tu is then released from the ribosome. Elongation factor subunit \u03b4 is a second elongation factor in E. coli that allows EF-Tu to hydrolyze GTP into GDP. Elongation factor subunit \u03b3 then releases the bound GDP where it can be recycled and allows for EF-Tu to bind a new GTP to catalyze another aatRNA. Upon infection of the host cell by the Q\u03b2 virus, the \u03b2 subunit hijacks these three subunits of the bacteria creating the replicase holoenzyme using the S1 subunit, EF-Tu, and EF-Ts as its coenzymes with the replicase becoming the \u03b2 subunit, and the S1, EF-Tu, and EF-Ts becoming the \u03b1, \u03b3, and \u03b4 subunits, respectively.

Once the 215 kDA replicase holoenzyme is completely assembled after hijacking the host's S1 ribosomal protein as well as the EF-Tu and EF-Ts elongation factors, replication of Q\u03b2's positive-stranded genome can begin, and the genome is first synthesized into a complementary negative-stranded RNA that will serve a template for the synthesis of more positive-stranded RNA that can serve as mRNA. Both the plus and minus strands will serve as templates during replication rather than just the minus strands. This causes replication to double in each round [34] .

This competition results in a repression of the translation due to ribosome removal. Replication occurs after the complete repression of translation in the absence of the ribosome. The minus strand of the RNA genome is the first product of this replication that serves as the template for the synthesis of the plus strand. The A 2 start region of the newly synthesized RNA on the plus strand, not completed, would be attractive to ribosomes. The temporary availability of the A 2 start gene to ribosomes, would produce a small amount of A 2 proteins. The openness of the A 2 protein gene to the ribosome is the result of a short relaxation (level free energy) of the RNA template secondary structure, which always prevents this accessibility. The plus strand produced by replication would serve as template for dual purpose: (i) replication and synthesis of progeny RNA molecules; and (ii) translation and production of more replicase enzymes and coat proteins for viral shells [46] . The further production of a large amount of the coat protein represses the replicase's \u03b2 subunit. This later repression of the replicase later in the phage cycle is done by the coat protein that binds to the RNA start of the replicase. The replicase repression induces the initiation of the coat protein shell formation and the final encapsulation of the plus strand RNA of the phage, yielding newly viable phages [47] .

Live viruses could be substituted or represented by this RNA phage display system, avoiding biohazards usually seen during live virus laboratory manipulations. With the volume of reports and papers on RNA viruses' replication, mutation, resistance to antiviral therapy, Red Queen Hypothesis, and escaping immune molecules, the struggle and difficulties to develop vaccines against these viruses can be alleviated in the coming century using RNA phage display system.
