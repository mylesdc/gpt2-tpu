The higher expression of GLDC derived from genetic variations may confer a higher risk to H7N9 and severe H1N1 infection. We sought to characterize GLDC as functional susceptibility gene that GLDC may intrinsically regulate antiviral response, thereby impacting viral replication and disease outcome. We demonstrated that GLDC inhibitor AOAA and siRNA depletion boosted IFNb-and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in combination with PolyI:C stimulation. GLDC inhibition and depletion significantly amplified antiviral response of type I IFNs and ISGs upon viral infection and suppressed the replication of H1N1 and H7N9 viruses. Consistently, GLDC overexpression significantly promoted viral replication due to the attenuated antiviral responses. Moreover, GLDC inhibition in H1N1-infected BALB/c mice recapitulated the amplified antiviral response and suppressed viral growth. AOAA provided potent protection to the infected mice from lethal infection, comparable to a standard antiviral against influenza viruses. Collectively, GLDC regulates cellular antiviral response and orchestrates viral growth. GLDC is a functional susceptibility gene to severe influenza in humans.",

A novel avian A(H7N9) virus has caused recurrent outbreaks of human infections in China since 2013 . Human H7N9 infection, mostly manifested as rapidly progressive pneumonia, showed variable susceptibility among individuals . The contribution of human genetic variations to susceptibility to severe influenza was clearly demonstrated in an earlier epidemiological study (Albright et al, 2008) . The variable susceptibility to H7N9 infection and diversified disease severity in pandemic H1N1 infection prompted us to decipher the genetic susceptibility and identify host gene predisposing to severe influenza, i.e., H7N9 and severe H1N1 infection.",

To prioritize the candidate susceptibility genes to H7N9 and severe H1N1 infection, we integrated the GWAS discovery with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis, a strategy which has been widely used to identify the trait gene targets (Musunuru et al, 2010; Zhu et al, 2016) .

Interestingly, Zhang et al uncovered a novel role of GLDC, which can promote pyrimidine biosynthesis and drive tumorigenesis of lung cancer (Zhang et al, 2012) . It has been well-established that cellular pyrimidine metabolism profoundly affects virus propagation. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme catalyzing the fourth step of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, was repetitively identified as the cellular target in high-throughput screening for antivirals conducted by several groups, including us (Hoffmann et al, 2011; Wang et al, 2011; Cheung et al, 2017) . Depletion of cellular pyrimidine inhibits the replication of an array of RNA viruses, DNA viruses, and retroviruses. Interestingly, Lucas-Hourani et al (2013 reported that pyrimidine deprivation suppresses viral growth through amplifying innate immune response, rather than depleting nucleotide precursors for viral genome replication as assumed previously (Hoffmann et al, 2011) . Consolidating prior knowledge and the findings of genetic association studies, we hypothesized a link between GLDC and innate immunity, which may impact viral growth and underlie the genetic association of GLDC with H7N9 and severe H1N1 infection. We performed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments and established GLDC as a functional susceptibility gene to severe influenza.",

An intronic SNP of GLDC, rs1755609, was significantly associated with the susceptibility to severe H1N1 infection. We verified the genetic association in a larger cohort including 174 severe patients and 258 mild controls. The carriers of AA and AG genotypes exhibited a 1.65-fold higher risk to severe H1N1 infection than the carriers of genotype GG (Table 1) . We chose rs1755609 for validation since this SNP is an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in 77 and 72 lymphoblast cell lines (LCLs) derived from Chinese and Japanese, respectively (Fig 1A) , and an eQTL in human lung tissues (Fig 1B; Hao et al, 2012) . Specifically, the differential expression levels of GLDC are significantly correlated to rs1755609 genotypes in LCLs and human lung tissues, the risk variants corresponding to higher GLDC expression. Interestingly, the genetic association of GLDC with severe H1N1 influenza was replicated in the H7N9 cohort including 102 H7N9 patients and 106 controls of healthy poultry workers. rs2438409, a SNP in high linkage equilibrium with rs1755609 in multiple ethnic groups (Fig 1C) , was significantly associated with the susceptibility to human H7N9 infection ( Table 2) . The risk allele G, in high linkage with rs1755609 A allele, was significantly over-represented in H7N9 patients than in controls. The carriers of GG and GA genotypes were conferred more than twofold higher risk to H7N9 infection compared to carriers of genotype AA. Collectively, the integration of disease association and eQTL datasets suggested that higher GLDC expression encoded by genetic variations may confer predisposition to H7N9 infection and severe H1N1 infection.",

GLDC probably acts as an intrinsic regulator of host antiviral response due to its role in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis (Zhang et al, 2012) , thereby impacting viral growth and disease outcome upon virus exposure. To establish the link that GLDC can modulate pyrimidine biosynthesis and regulate antiviral response, we performed two sets of experiments. Firstly, we intended to verify the role of GLDC in cellular pyrimidine biosynthesis as shown previously (Zhang et al, 2012) . After treatment with a GLDC inhibitor (aminooxy)acetic acid (AOAA) in A549 cells for 48 h, the amount of thymidine, one of pyrimidine compounds, was detected with LC-MS/MS. The GLDC inhibitor AOAA appeared to diminish the cellular pool of thymidine nucleoside in a dose-dependent manner (Fig EV1) , which verified the role of GLDC as an intrinsic regulator of pyrimidine biosynthesis as reported previously.",

To this end, A549 cells transfected with IFNb luciferase reporter plasmid were treated with AOAA or mock-treated for 24 h and then were applied to luciferase assay. However, AOAA treatment was unable to activate IFNb luciferase reporter gene (Fig 2A, 0 lg/ml Poly I:C). We postulated that AOAA may require additional signal to trigger IFN activation, similar to the pyrimidine inhibitor in a previous study (Lucas-Hourani et al, 2013) . To set up such a scenario, after transfection of the IFNb reporter plasmid, Poly I:C, an agonist of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) TLR3 and RIG-I, was subsequently transfected along with AOAA treatment. After Poly I:C transfection, IFNb reporter gene was slightly activated. Notably, in combination with Poly I:C stimulation, AOAA treatment further amplified IFNb activation to a significantly higher level than the mock treatment. We further evaluated the effect of GLDC inhibition in an A549 cell line (A549-Dual) stably carrying an interferonstimulated response element (ISRE) reporter gene. ISRE is a conserved DNA sequence element harbored in the promoters of most interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Likewise, AOAA treatment alone was unable to activate ISRE reporter gene. However, with simultaneous Poly I:C stimulation, AOAA further boosted ISRE activation to a significantly higher level. A549-Dual KO-RIG-I cells were generated from A549-Dual cells through the stable knockout of RIG-I gene. In these cells, AOAA-amplified activation of ISRE reporter gene was abolished (Fig 2A) , indicating the requirement of RIG-I/ PRR signaling for ISRE activation.",

These antiviral molecules also showed the consistent upregulation profile at 48 hpi ( Fig EV2A) . We also performed a cell viability assay to exclude the possibility that AOAA-mediated suppression of viral growth is related to any cytotoxicity ( Fig EV2B) . As aforementioned, DHODH is an important enzyme in de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. Brequinar, a well-known inhibitor of DHODH (Liu et al, 2000) , was shown to amplify the expression of ISGs (Lucas-Hourani et al, 2013) . We hypothesize that brequinar could recapitulate the effects of AOAA in H7N9 viral replication if these two compounds truly target the enzymes in pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. As expected, brequinar treatment prompted a heightened induction of IFNa and ISGs and significantly suppressed H7N9 replication ( Fig EV3) . The results lend further support to our finding that antiviral effect of AOAA is attributed to the pyrimidine deprivation mediated by GLDC inhibition.",

Three groups of BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with the mouse-adapted pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus and intranasally administrated with AOAA or zanamivir or PBS for three times as illustrated in Fig 6A. A total of 9 mice in each group were monitored for body weight change and survival rate for 14 days post-inoculation. In contrast to the survival rate of 11.1% in PBS-treated mice, all AOAA-treated mice survived the infection (Fig 6B) . Notably, AOAA provided an equivalent protection as zanamivir, a standard antiviral against influenza viruses, indicating that temporal GLDC inhibition could achieve a potent protection from fatal infection. The PBS-treated mice lost body weight significantly from day 4 post-inoculation while the body weights of AOAA-treated mice rebounded at days 3 and 4 ( Fig EV5) . Afterward, the body weights of AOAA-treated mice tended to be higher than those of the PBS-treated mice, yet comparable to those of zanamivir-treated mice. The viral load and viral titer in lung tissues of AOAA-treated mice were significantly lower than those in PBS-treated mice at days 3 and 5 post-infection ( Fig 6C) . In addition, a significantly higher level of IFNa was observed in the mouse lung tissues at days 3 and 5 post-infection in AOAA-treated mice than in PBS-treated mice ( Fig 6D) . The AOAA-amplified ISG production was also observed in the mice. The virus antigen-positive cells in mouse lung were more abundant in PBS-treated mice than in AOAA-treated mice (Fig 6E) , which is consistent with the higher viral titers in the former. Again, we excluded the possibility that AOAA-mediated reduction of viral growth was related to toxicity since the mice intranasally administrated with AOAA for 5 consecutive days did not exhibit any discernible difference in body weight loss in comparison with the mice treated with PBS ( Fig EV5) . Thus, GLDC inhibition in the H1N1-infected mice significantly boosted the antiviral response, decreased the viral growth, and protected the mice from lethal infection.",

Data shown are representative of three independent experiments, n = 3. epidemiological study clearly demonstrated the genetic contribution to fatal influenza infections (Albright et al, 2008) . In addition, host genetic variations were found to be associated with the development of severe pneumonia in influenza infections (Zuniga et al, 2012) . We sought to identify susceptibility gene(s) which may account for the inter-individual variability to severe influenza from the GWAS previously conducted in the H7N9 cohort and the pandemic H1N1 cohort. Besides the genetic contribution, emerging evidence suggested that broadly protective immune responses due to the childhood infection can provide long-term cross-immunity among different HA subtypes, especially those in the same phylogenetic group (Gostic et al, 2016) . At the first glance, the susceptibility to H7N9 infection and the susceptibility to severe H1N1 infection are not equivalent issues. In fact, H7N9 infection and severe H1N1 infection essentially shared the same pathology, i.e., viral pneumonia, the most lethal consequence of influenza (Nikolaidis et al, 2017) . Overall, pandemic H1N1 viruses exhibit binding specificity to human-type a2,6-linked sialic acid receptor (Zhou et al, 2013) ; the viruses tend to replicate more actively in human bronchus than in lung tissue . In nonhuman primates, the replication of pandemic H1N1 virus mainly affected the upper respiratory tract (Watanabe et al, 2013) . On the other hand, H7N9 viruses bind to both the humantype a2,6-linked sialic acid receptor and the avian-type a2,3-linked receptor, which are mainly distributed in human airway epithelium and lower respiratory epithelium, respectively. Accordingly, H7N9 virus can infect epithelial cells in human airway and lower respiratory tract including alveoli (Knepper et al, 2013; Zhou et al, 2013) and replicated efficiently in both the upper and the lower respiratory tracts in nonhuman primates. Thus, the biological characteristics of pandemic H1N1 virus and H7N9 virus largely determine the predilection of pandemic H1N1 infection as an upper respiratory tract infection, and H7N9 virus more likely to develop a lower respiratory tract infection . Given the existence of risk factors that facilitate viral growth or access the lower respiratory A B Figure 3 . GLDC inhibition suppressed viral replication.",

As an unbiased genomewide interrogation of genetic variations in association with diseases or clinical traits, GWAS could provide novel biological insights into disease pathophysiology and uncover new molecules and pathways related to diseases. GWAS of disease susceptibility demonstrated that the majority of association signals involve noncoding single nucleotide variants, so-called regulatory variants that modulate gene expression (Knight, 2014) . With the recognition of regulatory polymorphism in regulating gene expression, genome-wide correlation of genetic variants with gene expression has been systematically interrogated and established in various human tissues, known as quantitative trait loci (eQTL) (Fairfax & Knight, 2014) . eQTL can transform the GWAS association variants into candidate genes, which can be brought forward for functional validation experiments in vitro and/or in vivo (Zhu et al, 2016) . In this study, the intersection of the genetic associations and eQTL datasets suggested that higher GLDC expression encoded by genetic variations may predispose the affected individuals to H7N9 and severe H1N1 infection.",

GLDC can modulate pyrimidine biosynthesis (Zhang et al, 2012) ; meanwhile, pyrimidine deprivation can suppress viral replication via boosting antiviral innate immunity (Lucas-Hourani et al, 2013) . These evidences inspired us to hypothesize and subsequently uncover the GLDC/pyrimidine biosynthesis/innate immunity axis. We verify that a GLDC inhibitor AOAA substantially suppressed pyrimidine biosynthesis (Fig EV1) . But AOAA alone was unable to activate IFNb and ISRE luciferase reporter genes. In combination with TLR3/RIG-I stimulation, AOAA significantly activated both reporter genes (Fig 2A) . Accordingly, the AOAA-amplified ISRE activation was RIG-I dependent since the activation was abolished in RIG-I-knockout cells. Thus, we uncovered a novel role of GLDC as an intrinsic regulator of innate immunity due to its effect in modulating pyrimidine biosynthesis. In addition, AOAA treatment and GLDC siRNA knockdown invariably suppressed the replication of H7N9 and H1N1 virus due to the amplified induction of type I IFNs and ISGs (Figs 3-5 and EV2). Consistently, GLDC overexpression promoted viral growth via the compromised antiviral responses (Figs 5 and EV4 ). These results established GLDC as an important host gene for the replication of influenza viruses due to the GLDC/ pyrimidine biosynthesis/innate immunity axis. In addition, the axis may be functional in other viral infections since GLDC overexpression also significantly enhanced the replication of MERS-CoV ( Fig 5F) . We further demonstrated that in the H1N1-infected BALB/c mice, AOAA-mediated amplification of antiviral response and suppression of viral growth (Fig 6) are even more prominent than its in vitro effect in A549 cells. The outperformance of AOAA in vivo, we believe, was attributed to AOAA-triggered antiviral cascade. As aforementioned, AOAA-amplified IFN and ISG response is only elicited in the context of virus infection or simultaneous stimulation of PRR. However, the cytopathic effect caused by replicating viruses would gradually compromise cell viability and cellular antiviral response. Thus, in the virus-infected A549 cells, AOAA has a limited window to boost antiviral response before the cells are overridden by replicating viruses. However, the infected cells only represented a small percentage in mouse airway, large amounts of uninfected healthy cells can benefit from the AOAA-amplified antiviral response. Thus, AOAA-amplified antiviral response was more favorably exemplified in the infected mice than in the infected A549 cells. Conceivably, the differential GLDC expression encoded by genetic variation, probably with a modest effect, could be magnified in the virus-infected individuals and substantially affect the susceptibility to severe influenza.",

However, GWAS, especially those in infectious diseases, are notoriously confounded by many factors. In our case, the added hindrance was the limited sample size due to the infrequent occurrence of severe influenza. Despite all the obstacles, we reason that important host genes for the pathogenesis of severe influenza may survive the considerable variations in human genetic association study, if less stringent criteria (P value and odd ratio) are applied to filter association variants, and if the expression level of candidate gene is genetically correlated and thus can be captured by eQTL analysis. Under this line of reasoning, GLDC was prioritized as a candidate susceptibility gene to severe influenza, which prompted us to conduct in vitro and mouse studies and validated GLDC as a functional susceptibility gene to severe influenza.",

            "text": "In this study, we have used a GLDC inhibitor AOAA to demonstrate the role of GLDC for antiviral response, viral growth and mouse survival, followed by GLDC siRNA depletion and GLDC overexpression experiments to verify the AOAA-mediated effect in vitro. We exclude the possibility that AOAA-mediated antiviral effect is related to any cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, in the H7N9-infected A549 cells, AOAA acts similarly as an inhibitor of DHODH, an essential enzyme catalyzing pyrimidine biosynthesis. AOAA, a commonly used GLDC inhibitor, is a substrate analogue of GLDC with the amino (NH2) group of glycine replaced by an aminooxy (ONH2) group. AOAA occupies the GLDC substratebinding site and inhibits its activity (Nakai et al, 2005) . However, the less prominent effect mediated by the genetic modifications (siRNA depletion and overexpression) than AOAA treatment calls for more clarification of the specificity of AOAA in future study. In addition, our data coherently reached a conclusion that pyrimidine deprivation mediated by GLDC inhibition/depletion could amplify the antiviral response of type I IFN and ISGs and suppress viral replication, which reinforced the link between pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway and antiviral status as consistently demonstrated in other studies (Hoffmann et al, 2011; Wang et al, 2011; Cheung et al, 2017) . More recently, a pyrimidine inhibitor identified as a broadspectrum antiviral was found to activate RIG-I (Chung et al, 2016) , an essential cellular sensor to mount innate immune response in influenza virus infection (Loo et al, 2008) . However, the detailed mechanism linking pyrimidine deprivation and the boosted antiviral response definitely requires further study.",
