Spatial spread, R 0 (basic reproductive number), and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%), and intervention impact (4%). Most studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%), and demographic data (37%) were the most common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions, and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail to allow complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV predictions by a median of 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 30% of studies.",

We conducted a comprehensive review of such ZIKV prediction studies and evaluated their aims, the data sources they used, which methods were used, how timely they were published, and whether they provided sufficient information to be used or reproduced by others. Of the 73 studies evaluated, we found the accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied; indicating there is substantial room for improvement. We identified that the release of study findings before formal journal publication ('pre-prints') increased the timeliness of Zika prediction studies, but note they were infrequently used during this public health emergency. Addressing these areas can improve our understanding of Zika and other outbreaks and ensure forecasts can inform preparedness and response to future outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.",

ZIKV is also associated with Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and a spectrum of other neurological disorders including meningoencephalitis and acute myelitis [6] [7] [8] [9] . ZIKV was discovered in Uganda in a febrile non-human primate in 1947 [10] , and the first human case was detected in Nigeria in 1953 [11] . ZIKV outbreaks were detected in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands in the early 21 st century [12-16] followed by wide spread epidemics in the Americas from late 2014 onward, with a cumulative count of 583,144 suspected and 223,336 laboratory-confirmed Zika cases reported across 49 countries and territories by the end of 2017 [17, 18] .",

The urgency for immediate coordinated global response was further accelerated by the Olympic and Paralympic games set to take place in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil during August 2016 [20] . As public health and medical research efforts for Zika increased across the Americas, scientists developed mathematical models to anticipate further outbreak spread, evaluate possible control measures, and gain insight into outbreak dynamics. These models used a range of data sources including case counts, relative vector abundance and distribution, population age structure, human mobility, climate information, viral sequence and serological data, and internet 'big data' streams. A range of statistical and mathematical models predicted the spread and other epidemic dynamics of ZIKV, as well as the burden of its complications [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

Such an exercise is critical, not only due to the ongoing risk of Zika globally [28] , but also to inform modeling efforts for future major epidemics. We therefore undertook a systematic review to identify all published ZIKV prediction and forecasting studies during a time period which encompassed the PHEIC period and the peak and waning phase of the epidemic in the Americas. The first aim of this systematic review was to identify all published models that predicted, forecasted, or simulated any ecological or epidemiological phenomenon about the Zika pandemic and describe the predicted phenomena, the range of data sources used, and the modeling methods employed. This first aim sought to characterize the methods and data employed to answer key questions during the epidemic and to identify potentially underutilized data or methods. The second aim was to evaluate key scientific characteristics of these studies, including (i) accessibility and timeliness of the publication, (ii) reproducibility of the methods and access to the statistical code and data, and (iii) clarity of the presentation of the prediction results, including uncertainty in prediction estimates. The third aim was to describe the funding structure and major contributing sectors, such as government, industry, non-governmental organizations, or academia, behind these publications.",

In contrast to existing reviews on models developed during the ZIKV pandemic, which described specific contributions of modeling [113] or validated analytical assessment of results [114] , this systematic review focused on capturing lessons that could improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks. Extending an approach used by Chretien et al. in their evaluation of Ebola models, we focused on aspects of the studies that likely are particularly relevant to their usefulness during an outbreak [104] .

The most commonly predicted phenomena were spatial spread, R 0 , epidemic dynamics, microcephaly burden, and vector competence. Notably few of the studies modeled the impact or cost-effectiveness of interventions, sexual transmission risk, or GBS burden. Not surprisingly, the majority of the studies were set in the Americas where most of the cases were reported during the pandemic. Notably one of the global gaps for understanding ZIKV dynamics is Africa, where ZIKV was discovered, is endemic, and poses a risk of future epidemics [115] [116] [117] .",

            "text": "The leading data types for the examined studies were conventional case counts, vector, demographic, climate, and transport data. This finding reflects not only the availability but also the importance of such data. Case count data in particular are often hard to access but critical to many modeling approaches. Rapid sharing of case count data during international public health emergencies, as well as open, curated, rapidly accessible baseline demographic, human mobility, climate, and environmental datasets are essential to quickly leverage modeling and forecasting efforts [110] . Our review also identified several relatively underused data streams. First, socioeconomic and behavioral data were conspicuously absent. The lack of behavioral components in these models is concerning given the importance of these factors on disease dynamics [118] . Second, real-time internet-based data-streams, such as social media and internet search engine data, were used in a minority of ZIKV prediction studies identified in this systematic review. The limited use of internet 'big data' in the models suggests that either these data are of lower value for epidemic forecasting or that methods have yet to be developed to efficiently extract important information from them. Such data streams may be more commonly used in forecasting in the future as their strengths and weakness become clearer [119] . Genomic data were absent from these published models. During the pandemic, sequencing platforms were employed to generate data critical to diagnostic and countermeasure development [120] , but our systematic review revealed that these data were not incorporated into prediction frameworks during the first year of ZIKV pandemic. This may reflect that early molecular epidemiology studies aimed to reconstruct the invasion and evolution of ZIKV rather than forecasting future changes [121, 122] . Some phylodynamic studies were published after the time period of the systematic review, with interesting results highlighting the possibility for phylogenetic data to provide unique insight into epidemic dynamics and possibly forecasting [122] [123] [124] . The relative delay of these studies (relative to those using other data sources) echoes a similar time lag of phylogenetic studies during the 2015 Ebola epidemic [104] . The lack of phylogenomic studies captured by this review also suggests that substantial bottlenecks still exist in using these data sources in epidemic response, despite advances in mobile near \"real-time\" sequencing technologies [120] . In the future, as new methods are developed, and genomic data become more readily available, the use of these data will likely become more common in prospective forecasting frameworks.",

Both categories of models have pros and cons and their use is often informed by the specific question being addressed, in addition to data availability [125] . Deterministic models may generally be easier to produce, but they may have limitations for intrinsically stochastic processes like epidemics, such as underestimating uncertainty, although deterministic models can also be implemented to estimate uncertainty [126] . Uncertainty is particularly important in this context where uncertainties are generated by the epidemic itself, data collection, and analytical approaches. Moreover, forecasts are ideally used to inform the mobilization of resources to save lives, a context in which clearly characterizing uncertainties is paramount. This is also a clear area for improvement in model output reporting; only 43% of studies entirely reported estimates of uncertainty. However, studies which did not present, say a credible interval around a forecasted phenomenon, may still have incorporated uncertainty in other ways which were not captured by the data abstraction tool, for instance a scenario analysis or incorporating uncertainty around parameters in a deterministic model.",

Many other fields of biomedical research have established reporting guidelines to improve research quality and implementation [127] [128] [129] [130] . While reporting guidelines have been proposed for population health modeling on a broader scale [131] , none have been established for epidemics. This review also indicated that a majority of studies (60%) did not completely disclose the data they used. To the extent permissible with ethical and privacy constraints, publishing the aggregated data used to fit and validate models is critical. Not only would sharing data support full reproducibility, but sharing would also enable other researchers to use data in their own complementary modeling efforts. Modelers could therefore help answer calls for increased data sharing during public health emergencies [104, 110, 132] . Exploring how data can be shared more openly and quickly during a public health emergency would be useful, as this remains a challenge.",

Second, we found that only 30% of studies were made available as preprints prior to peer review despite endorsements of preprints by major public agencies, funders, and journals. Those posted were available a median of 119 days prior to peer-reviewed publication. An analysis of preprints for all Zika publications over a similar time period found similar publication delays but much lower overall preprint use compared to the studies analyzed here (3.4% versus 30%) [133] . This greater adoption may indicate a changing preprint culture which was also reflected by our finding that preprint posting did not have a demonstrable effect on the impact factor of the journal in which the study was published, and we suggest that pre-prints be more frequently used in future public health emergencies, echoing other similar recent arguments [133] .",

We may have therefore missed important research that had been posted but not yet peer-reviewed. Lastly, we had to restrict the time frame for publications to consider in the review. This restriction again led to missing studies, some of which may have already been published but not yet posted in EMBASE or MEDLINE. An additional challenge with our systematic review was that we did not provide a specific definition of \"forecasting\" and \"prediction\" to reviewers (to avoid an overly strict eligibility criteria).
