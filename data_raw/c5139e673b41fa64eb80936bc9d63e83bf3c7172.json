In the present study, we screened plasma of 88 HIV-1 infected ART na\u00efve individuals for their neutralization potential using a standard panel of 18 pseudoviruses belonging to different subtypes and different levels of neutralization. We identified 12 samples with good breadth of neutralization (neutralized >90% of the viruses). Four of these samples neutralized even the difficult-to-neutralize tier-3 pseudoviruses with great potency (GMT > 600). Analysis of neutralization specificities indicated that four samples had antibodies with multiple epitope binding specificities, viz. CD4-binding site (CD4BS), glycans in the V1/V2 and V3 regions and membrane proximal external region (MPER). Our findings indicate the strong possibility of identifying highly potent bNAbs with known or novel specificities from HIV-1 subtype C infected individuals from India that can be exploited as therapeutic tools or lead molecules for the identification of potential epitopes for design of a protective HIV-1 vaccine.",

Fifty eight samples were found to neutralize 4 or more of the viruses, and eight neutralized all the 6 pseudoviruses. > 60% neutralization was considered as good breadth of neutralization as defined by Montefiori (2005) . The 58 samples were further tested against a panel of six tier-2 pseudoviruses.

Four samples (NAB033, NAB059, NAB063 and NAB069) had varying amounts of RSC3 directed CD4BS antibodies (55, 40.2, 32.3 and 91% respectively), as indicated by their ability to bind selectively to the wild type protein but not to the mutant form (i.e., difference in binding activity between RSC3 and RSC3\u2206 371I/P363N was significant, p < 0.05). RSC3 specific IgG was eluted from these four samples and binding activity was compared with Table 1 . Clinical and Demographic profile of HIV-1 infected individuals in this study. A total of 101 samples were collected for the study; of these 4(*) could not be tested for CD4 count at the time of sample collection and hence not included in the above Table. that of well characterized MAbs such as VRC01, VRC03, b12 and 3BNC117 (Fig. 3A,B and Table 3 ). Further, neutralization titer assay was performed for RSC3-specific IgG eluted from the four BCN plasma samples with a VRC01-resistant and sensitive pseudovirus (DU422 and CAP45.2.00), a sensitive and resistant tier-2 pseudovirus (JR-FL wild type and JR-FL mutant D279A), as well as a tier-3 pseudovirus (PVO-4). Known CD4BS monoclonal antibodies VRC01 and b12, were used as positive controls. The known CD4BS antibodies showed stronger 3C and Table 4 ).",

Neutralization assay was performed for 8 of the 12 BCN samples, for which sufficient volume of plasma was available, with a wild type tier-2 HIV-1 subtype C virus (DU156), and its mutant forms (DU156N160K and DU156N332A). All 8 samples showed strong neutralization activity against DU156WT (Fig. 4A , Table 5 ). Four samples showed significantly lower levels of neutralization of DU156N160K; neutralization activity of one sample (NAB062) was 25 fold lower with the DU156N160K mutant as compared to DU156WT, but < 3 fold with the other three samples (NAB016, NAB033 and NAB069). The remaining four samples (NAB046, NAB059, NAB063 and NAB065) showed a higher level of neutralization of DU156N160K than the WT virus, indicating that antibodies in these samples do not specifically target N160 glycan but target other regions of the HIV-1 Env. The four samples (NAB016, NAB033, NAB062 and NAB069) that showed varying levels of dependence on N160 glycan were further studied to understand whether the glycan dependent antibodies in these individuals were similar to those belonging to the PG9/PG16 series by performing neutralization assay. It is known from literature that PG9/PG16 bNAbs do not neutralize the HIV-1 subtype B JR-FL WT strain due to presence of glutamic acid (E) at 168 position. However, when E is replaced with lysine (K) in the WT JR-FL strain by single mutation, it turned sensitive to neutralization by PG9/PG16 antibodies 13 . We therefore used these two pseudoviruses (JR-FL WT and JR-FL E168K) for further analysis of PG9/PG16 like bNAbs. Four samples strongly neutralized (> 3 fold) the mutant pseudovirus than the JR-FL WT ( Fig. 4B and Table 6 ). Neutralization was also performed for the identification of positional dependence using two double mutants JR-FL E168K N156K and JR-FL E168K N160K (Fig. 4C) . Three of the four samples (NAB016, NAB062 and NAB069) showed reduced neutralization of both double mutants (3-5 fold reduction) as compared to the single mutant (Table 7) . One sample (NAB033) showed < 3 fold reduction in neutralization of both the double mutants.",

            "text": "PepScan analysis showed that most of the samples had antibodies that bound strongly to the V3 and ID regions of gp160. Similar observations were also made by other groups of investigators 24, 32 who reported that most of the HIV-1 infected individuals harbour such antibodies, but these are generally non-neutralizing 34 . This region is known to contain three epitopes PDRPEG (KE1), IEEE (KE2) and ERDRD (KE3), and antibodies to these epitopes are thought to bind to HIV-1 particles after they attach themselves to the cell receptors 35 . In general, the antibody response to the Kennedy epitopes in HIV-1 infected individuals is thought to be very weak 36 . Interestingly, the Indian reference strain, 93IN101 (pIndie), has amino acid substitutions in KE1 and KE3, resulting in an altered amino acid composition of the epitopes (PDRLGR and EQDKDR respectively). NAB016 and NAB059 exhibited a high binding affinity to PDRLGR, suggesting that changes in KE1 of subtype C has relevance to improved binding antibody response, which might or might not translate to inactivation of HIV-1 by neutralization. MPER comprises the last 23 residues of the gp41 ectodomain. Several well characterized NAbs like 2F5, Z13e1, 4E10 and 10E8 bind to linear epitopes in MPER 17, 37 . In our study, three samples (NAB069, NAB120 and NAB122) showed binding reactivity to MPER peptides. The CD4 receptor on the target cell plays a major role in viral entry by interacting with the CD4 binding site present on the HIV envelope. Before 2009, b12 was the only CD4BS bNAb that was identified. However, since 2009, several CD4BS bNAbs with greater breadth and potency of neutralization than b12 have been isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals, such as VRC01-03, VRC23, NIH45-46, 3BNC117, etc 38 , and two of these, VRC01 and 3BNC117, are currently being tested for use as therapeutic vaccines against HIV-1 39,40 . We first tested plasma binding activity to the wild type RSC3 protein which selectively binds to VRC01-like CD4BS specific bNAbs, and a mutant form of the protein which shows decreased binding to CD4BS bNAbs 25, 41 . We identified four samples containing VRC01-like CD4BS antibodies, as demonstrated by their ability to preferentially bind to the RSC3 WT protein but not to the mutant form. In order to determine the neutralizing potential of the CD4BS specific antibodies in these samples, we eluted IgG from the plasma and tested them in a neutralization assay with tier-2 and tier-3 pseudoviruses. Two of the four samples, NAB069 and NAB063, exhibited strong neutralization of the tier-2 virus JR-FL WT and tier-3 HIV-1 subtype B pseudovirus PVO-4 but diminished neutralization of JR-FL D279A, just like VRC01. These observations provide clear evidence to show that these samples contain CD4BS specific antibodies with neutralization ability. Our findings mirror those of Landais et al. 42 and others that although RSC3 binding activity may be found in some HIV-1 infected individuals 42 , RSC3 reactive antibodies mediating broad neutralization were only detected in very few individuals. A major limitation of the RSC3 binding approach as observed by previous investigators (Walker et al. 14 ) is that some CD4BS bNAbs may not bind to the RSC3 protein, necessitating the use of additional recombinant gp120 (rgp120) core molecules 14, 43 . However, we could not perform further experiments with rgp120 adsorbed antibodies due to insufficient sample volume.",

            "text": "It is well known that HIV uses glycan shields to escape attack by the host immune system. The glycan shields hinder accessibility to the neutralizing antibody binding sites. Thus, identification of bNAbs that target some of the critical glycans on the HIV envelope could pave the way for designing an effective vaccine against HIV 44 . Potential N-linked glycans at positions 160 and 332 on the HIV envelope are known to be very crucial for the binding of glycan dependent antibodies belonging to the PG9/PG16 and PGT series, respectively 13, 45 . We evaluated the BCN samples identified in our study for the presence of potential N-linked glycan dependent antibodies. For this purpose, we performed neutralization assay with a subtype C pseudovirus, DU156WT, and its mutant forms DU156N160K and DU156N332A. Studies have shown that viruses, mutated at position 160 (V2 loop) escape neutralization by PG9/PG16 antibodies 26, 46 . We identified four samples (NAB016, NAB033, NAB062 and NAB069) that strongly neutralized DU156WT but showed reduced levels of neutralization of the mutant virus DU156N160K, suggesting that these samples are likely to contain PG9/PG16 like antibodies. One of the four samples, NAB062, showed a 25-fold reduction in neutralization of DU156N160K as compared to DU156WT, indicating the strong specificity of the antibodies present in this sample to this epitope. In addition, these four samples also demonstrated strong neutralization of the JR-FL E168K mutant pseudovirus as compared to WT JR-FL pseudovirus, providing further support for the PG9/PG16-like specificity of the antibodies in these samples. This is due to the presence of glutamic acid (E) at 168 position in JR-FL that masks the exposure of asparagine (N) glycans at positions 156 and 160 thereby abrogating the binding of PG9/PG16 like antibodies to this epitope 13 . We found a further reduction in the neutralization activity of the plasma on the double mutants (JR-FL E168K N156K and JR-FL E168K N160K) as compared to the single mutant, providing further proof to document the presence of PG9/PG16 like bNAbs in these samples. Interestingly, two of the samples (NAB033 and NAB069) that showed PG9/PG16-like neutralization activity also contained CD4BS antibodies as seen in the previous experiment. Four other samples (NAB046, NAB059, NAB063 and NAB065) showed a higher level of neutralization of the mutant virus DU156N160K, than the WT virus indicating the possibility that these samples contain NAbs that are independent of glycan at N160 but target other regions of the HIV-1 Env.",

To identify if antibodies with similar specificities were present in any of our BCN samples, we analyzed the plasma for neutralization activity against the subtype C virus, DU156WT and mutant DU156 N332A pseudovirus. Seven BCN samples neutralized DU156WT indicating the presence of antibodies belonging to the PGT series. Similar observations of a high frequency of N332 glycan-dependant antibodies among HIV-1 subtype C infected individuals from sub-Saharan Africa was recently reported by Landais et al. 42 . Of the seven samples, one sample NAB062, showed 24.3 folds reduction in neutralization of the mutant as compared to the WT. Two other samples, NAB046 and NAB069, also showed a reduction of 3.3 and 3.5 fold in neutralization of the mutant as compared to WT virus.

All study subjects were asymptomatic and na\u00efve to ART at the time of sample collection. Fifteen milliliters of venous blood was collected in K 3 -EDTA treated blood collection tubes. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 300 g and stored as 1 ml aliquots at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until use. The plasma samples were heat inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 1 hour before use. Pseudo viruses belonging to clades A, B, C, A/E and A/G, RSC3 WT and RSC3 \u0394 371I/P363N recombinant proteins were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program. Pseudoviruses were prepared by co-tranfection of pEnv and pSG\u2206 Env back bone plasmid into 293T cells using standard Calcium Phosphate method and titrated on TZM-bl cells 53, 54 . Neutralization potential of the plasma samples was determined based on an observed reduction in luciferase gene expression after a single round of infection in TZM-bl cells with env-pseudotyped viruses as described 53, 54 . Murine leukemia virus (MuLV) was used as a control virus.",

Samples exhibiting strong neutralization activity were diluted 1:50 in DMEM containing 10% FBS, and 1 ml of the diluted plasma was incubated with 0.5 ml of beads at room temperature for 30 minutes. This step was repeated three times for the better removal of antibodies. Beads coupled with RSC3 or MPER-specific antibodies were stored in PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 0.02% sodium azide at 4 \u00b0C. The remaining plasma was centrifuged three times at 16,100 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes each time to remove any residual Dynabeads and used subsequently for ELISA and neutralization assays. BSA-coated beads or blank beads were used as negative controls. The protein-coupled beads were washed three times with PBS containing 500 mM NaCl and once with PBS, and the antibodies were eluted by stepwise decrease in pH. First, the beads were mixed with 100 mM glycine-HCl elution buffer (pH 2.7) for 30 seconds. The beads were then centrifuged for 30 seconds and held in place at the bottom of the tube with a magnet. The acid-eluted solution containing IgG was quickly removed and placed in a separate tube containing 0.5 ml of 1 M Tris (pH 9.0) buffer to reach pH 7.0 to 7.4. This process was repeated three times. The eluted IgG was diluted in DMEM and concentrated over a 30-kDa Centricon plus filter (Millipore Corp.). Subsequently, the same procedure was performed on the beads at an elution pH of 2.2 to recover any IgG resistant to elution at pH 2.7. The IgG fractions recovered by both acid elution steps were combined and the concentration of the combined IgG fractions was measured using nanodrop technology (Thermofisher). The IgG was further characterized by ELISA using RSC3 protein and its double mutant RSC3\u0394 371I/P363N. Known monoclonal neutralizing antibodies (MAbs) VRC01, VRCO3, b12 and 3BNC117 that bind specifically to the CD4BS were used as positive controls.",

Briefly, 0.1 mg of protein or 1 mg of MPER peptide was coupled to 0.50 mg or 5 mg of tosylactivated magnet MyOne Dynabeads respectively. Coupling was done at room temperature (RT) in a total volume of 1.25 ml in coupling buffer (0.1 M sodium borate buffer [pH 9.5] with 1 M ammonium sulfate) with gentle rocking for 48 hours. The Dynabeads and bound protein were separated from the coupling buffer with a magnet and resuspended in 5 ml of blocking buffer (PBS [pH 7.4] containing 0.5% [wt/vol] bovine serum albumin [BSA] and 0.05% Tween 20) for an additional 48 hours. The blocking buffer was removed by aspiration, and the protein-coupled Dynabeads were washed two times with 5 ml of wash buffer (PBS [pH 7.4] containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20). The beads were then resuspended in 0.5 ml of storage buffer (PBS [pH 7.4] supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.02% sodium azide + protease inhibitors) and stored at 4 \u00b0C. On the following day, the protein-coupled beads were washed three times with Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated in DMEM containing 10% FBS at room temperature for 30 minutes to block nonspecific binding to the beads.",
