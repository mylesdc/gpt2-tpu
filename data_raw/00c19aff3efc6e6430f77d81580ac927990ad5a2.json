There is heterogeneity in the data and reported diagnostic yields range from 26 to 69%. Therefore, selection criteria for BAL to maximize yield and minimize complications are unclear. Objectives of this study were to determine the diagnostic yield and complication rate of BAL in immunocompromised patients presenting with lung infiltrates, and identify factors impacting these outcomes. Exploratory aims included characterization of pathogens, rate of treatment modification and mortality. Methods: Retrospective study from January 2012 to December 2016. Patients on mechanical ventilation were excluded. Positive diagnostic yield was defined as confirmed microbiological or cytological diagnosis. Results: A total of 217 patients were recruited (70.1% male and mean age: 51.7 \u00b1 14.6 years). Diagnostic yield was 60.8% and complication rate 14.7%. Complications (hypoxemia and endobronchial bleeding) were all sell-limiting. Treatment modification based on BAL results was 63.3%. In 97.0% an infectious aetiology was identified. HIV infection (OR 5.304, 95% CI 1.611-17.458, p = 0.006) and severe neutropenia (OR 4.253, 95% CI 1.288-14.045, p = 0. 018) were associated with positive yield. Leukemia (OR 0.317, 95% CI 0.102-0.982, p = 0.047) was associated with lower yield. No factors impacted complication rate. Overall mortality (90-day) was 17.5% and in those with hematologic malignancy, it was 28.3%.",

This population was beyond the scope of our study. Additionally, we aimed to determine the incidence of complications of BAL and identify factors associated with either higher diagnostic yields or lower complication rates. Exploratory aims include characterization of commonly isolated pathogens, the rate of post-procedure treatment modification as an indicator of clinical utility, as well as post-procedure 30 and 90-day mortality. Post-procedure treatment modification reflects the true value of the procedure since some microbiological findings may be of non-pathogenic commensals while other results may not be amendable to clinical intervention. Identification of such data will optimize patient selection, allowing endoscopists to counsel patients and recommend alternative diagnostic modalities for those with low likelihood of successful diagnosis or at high risk of complications.",

Neutropenia severity was categorized based on absolute neutrophil count from mild (1000-1499 per microliter), moderate (500-999 per microliter) and severe (< 500 per microliter). Exclusion criteria comprised BAL performed in an ICU setting on mechanically ventilated patients, due to differences in procedure such as bronchoscope intubation via an endotracheal tube. Prognosis is also different and poor when the patient has progressed to respiratory failure [1] . Patients who underwent transbronchial lung biopsies or other forms of bronchoscopic sampling were also excluded to avoid introduction of confounding factors. Data was extracted from a bronchoscopy database that prospectively collects, via endoscopists' reports, all bronchoscopy details performed at the hospital endoscopy centre. This ensured integrity and completeness of data collection over the study period. Data was rendered non-identifiable with removal of patient's name, identification card number and date of procedure. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were interpreted by a radiologist and consultant pulmonologist and the predominant abnormalities characterized according to the following categories: consolidation, ground glass opacities, tree-in-bud appearance, reticular infiltrates, nodular infiltrates and cavitation.

The remaining two cases were of endobronchial bleeding that did not require further endoscopic intervention (CTCAE 1). Both patients were thrombocytopenic with platelet counts of 27,000 per microliter and 126,000 per microliter. No patients required intubation or escalation of care. Post-procedure 30-day and 90-day mortality was 10.6% (23/217) and 17.5% (38/217) respectively. Patients who suffered complications had significantly higher median Charlson comorbidity index (median 5, IQR 3-7) compared to those who did not suffer complications (median 4, IQR 3-6; p = 0.011) [7] . Univariate logistic regression analysis for complication rate found dyspnea during disease presentation to be significantly associated with increased complications (unadjusted OR 2.508, 95% CI 1.169-5.382, p = 0.018). Multivariable logistic regression analysis found no factors significantly associated with complication rate (See supplementary material in Appendix 2). In non-HIV, hematologic malignancy patients diagnostic yield was 51.1% (47/92) and of these 70.2% (33/47) of cases impacted patient management with treatment modification. Isolated pathogens included 8 cases of parainfluenza virus, 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 rhinovirus, 4 respiratory syncytial virus, 3 Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 3 Klebsiella species and 3 coronavirus. Complication rate was 10.9% (10/92), while post-procedure 30-day and 90-day mortality was 17.4% (16/92) and 28.3% (26/92) respectively. Mortality rate was significantly higher for non-HIV, hematologic malignancy patients than for HIV and for non-HIV, non-hematologic malignancy groups.",

Infectious etiologies accounted for 97% of the positive diagnoses which reinforces current clinical practice of early use of empiric antibiotics. In addition, our study found no impact of prior anti-microbial therapy or duration of antibiotics on diagnostic yield. The mismatch between positive yield and post-BAL result treatment modification may be attributable to the fact that 40.5% (64/158) of pathogens detected were respiratory viruses for which therapeutic options were limited. In addition, in none of the 16 isolates of cytomegalovirus was there inclusion bodies detected in the corresponding cytology. This raises doubts over the pathogenic nature of the cytomegalovirus isolates. Cases where the BAL cytomegalovirus isolate was the only finding (including no antigenemia) were not labelled as positive diagnostic yield. There were 17.1% (37/217) cases of Pneumocystis jirovecii, 6.0% (13/217) cases of tuberculosis, 4.6% (10/ 217) cases of Aspergillosis and 3.7% (8/217) cases of Pseudomonas infection.

There was also a trend towards increased risk of post procedure hypoxia in HIV patients which endoscopists should note with respect to ensuring appropriate post-procedure monitoring.

Non-infective aetiology such as alveolar haemorrhage may be more prevalent in this group. BAL can only procure cytological and not histological specimens for analysis. Other conditions such as drug induced pneumonitis may not have pathognomonic findings and it may be difficult to establish a confirmed cause when it is a diagnosis of exclusion. Therefore, alternative sampling including lung biopsies should be considered early in patients with hematologic malignancies. Non-HIV, non-hematologic malignancy patients had a diagnostic yield that was in between the HIV patient and hematologic malignancy group. The most pertinent finding in this group was that the most commonly identified pathogen was Mycobacteria tuberculosis. This may be reflective of the endemic nature of tuberculosis in our population in Singapore [12] , as well as the nature of the immunosuppression. This finding is corroborated by the presence of radiological evidence of cavitation in 11% of our patients and the trend towards increased diagnostic yield if cavitation was indeed present.",

In a mixed aetiology study, the 30-day mortality was 7% in non-hematologic malignancy and 19% with hematologic malignancy [15] . This reflects the severity of illness that immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates have and should serve as an impetus to continue to improve bronchoscopic sampling and laboratory testing. Symptoms and radiological findings (besides the trend in presence of cavitation) also did not impact diagnostic yield in our study. Therefore, identifying patients who are unlikely to get a bronchoscopic diagnosis on the basis of only clinical presentation may be challenging.

This group with haematologic malignancy has a high 90-day mortality and delayed diagnosis risk clinical deterioration. Tuberculosis appears to be an important pathogen in endemic regions especially in the non-HIV, non-hematologic malignancy group. Aspergillus was the other commonly identified pathogen via culture and Galactomannan assay. Viruses accounted for 40.5% of positive diagnosis and this finding often leads to limited modification in clinical management.
