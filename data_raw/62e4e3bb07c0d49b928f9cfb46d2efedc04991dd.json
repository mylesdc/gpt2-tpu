In addition to good management practices, vaccination offers an attractive alternative for controlling mycoplasma infections in food animals, instead of using antibiotics, which often leave unacceptable residues. The use of live attenuated vaccines, however, carry the concern of reversion to virulence or genetic recombination with field strains. Currently there are no commercially available vaccines against ostrich-infecting mycoplasmas and this study therefore set out to develop and evaluate the use of a DNA vaccine against mycoplasma infections in ostriches using an OppA protein as antigen. To this end, the oppA gene of \"Mycoplasma nasistruthionis sp. nov.\" str. Ms03 was cloned into two DNA vaccine expression vectors after codon correction by site-directed mutagenesis. Three-months-old ostriches were then vaccinated intramuscularly at different doses followed by a booster vaccination after 6 weeks. The ability of the DNA vaccines to elicit an anti-OppA antibody response was evaluated by ELISA using the recombinant OppA protein of Ms03 as coating antigen. A statistically significant anti-OppA antibody response could be detected after administration of a booster vaccination indicating that the OppA protein was successfully immunogenic. The responses were also both dose and vector dependent. In conclusion, the DNA vaccines were able to elicit an immune response in ostriches and can therefore be viewed as an option for the development of vaccines against mycoplasma infections.",

Although ostriches are traditionally endemic to Africa, parts of Arabia and the Middle East (2), they are reared in several countries across the world. South Africa, however, is currently the largest producer of ostrich products (meat, leather, and feathers) on international markets (3) . Here, the majority of ostriches destined for slaughter are reared in free-range systems, but when environmental conditions are unfavorable for grazing, they are reared in grow-out camps from about 3 months of age (4) . Mycoplasma, a genus of bacteria that belongs to the prokaryotic class Mollicutes, is known to be highly infectious in these intensive rearing systems (5, 6) . Characteristic features of mycoplasma include the lack of a cell wall, small AT-rich genome and a minimal set of genes (7, 8) . The species found to specifically infect ostriches are \"Mycoplasma struthionis sp. nov.\" str. Ms01, Mycoplasma sp. str. Ms02, and \"Mycoplasma nasistruthionis sp. nov.\" str. Ms03 (9, 10) . They are typically associated with upper respiratory tract infections (9) , reduced growth rates, downgrading of carcasses and in extreme cases, chick mortalities (5, 9) . The severity of infections increases with exposure to environmentally induced stress, other bacterial and viral infections. Of the three Mycoplasma species, \"Mycoplasma nasistruthionis sp. nov.\" str. Ms03 was found to have the highest prevalence (6) amongst ostriches and therefore was the focus of this study.",

            "text": "Mycoplasma infections are currently managed using a combination of biosecurity systems and antibiotics. With antibiotics there is the risk of resistance (11) as well as an accumulation of residues in meat with concomitant risks for consumers (12) . Development of whole organism vaccines for use in ostriches is limited by the slow-growing nature of these organisms and the cost of medium required to sustain growth. DNA vaccines, on the other hand, do not require large scale cultivation of the pathogen, can be produced at relatively low cost and are more temperature stable than other vaccines (13, 14) . It is therefore an attractive alternative for use in ostriches where the vaccine market is small, relative to e.g., poultry, and ostriches are usually farmed in semi-arid or arid regions where temperatures are frequently high and cold storage of vaccines can be problematic. Similar to live vaccines, they are also able to stimulate humoral and cellular immunity as indicated by measuring antibody, T-helper cell and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses (15) . but unlike live vaccines cannot revert back to an infectious form (16) . El Gazzar et al. (17) has reported the reversion to virulence of a commonly used live mycoplasma vaccine in poultry, ts-11, whilst another has reported possible genetic recombination between live vaccines and field strains upon long term use (18) . This exchange or transfer of genes could have a negative impact on either the pathogenicity or transmissibility of field strains. Chromosomal integration of DNA vaccines is of some concern, but preclinical and clinical studies have shown the rate of integration of plasmid DNA into the host genome to be lower than that of spontaneous mutations (19, 20) . To date, DNA vaccines have not been tested in ostriches or any other ratites. The aim of this study was to use the OppA protein of \"M. nasistruthionis sp. nov.\" str. Ms03 as antigen in the development and evaluation of DNA vaccines in ostriches at different doses and using different vectors.",

As these responses against OppA were significant in comparison to the negative responses following the first vaccinations, this is evidence of a secondary immune response as a result of immune memory. If memory cells are produced after the initial contact with an antigen, subsequent exposure to the same antigen will allow the host to recognize the antigen faster, and with greater magnitude (49, 50) . The responses elicited by the DNA vaccines were, however, dose dependent as well as vector dependent since different results were produced by each vaccine when using the same dose. This highlights a possible role of the vaccine vector in the observed antibody responses. The VR1020_oppA vaccine, on average, elicited higher titer values compared to the pCI-neo_oppA vaccine, which might be due to the TPA signal sequence of the VR1020 plasmid, which is situated upstream of the oppA gene, and assists with protein expression in mammalian cells and export of the protein out of the cell. This would in turn increase the immunogenicity of the antigen (45) . In addition to this, sequences in the plasmid backbone have intrinsic immunostimulatory activity which enhance the immune system's response to the expressed protein antigen (51, 52) .",

It is possible that the mycoplasma infections had an influence on the observed antibody responses. In a study done by Yang et al. (26) using recombinant OppA protein as subunit vaccine against M. catarrhalis in mice, it was found that the ELISA titer values were already raised at the start of the vaccination trial which they ascribed to the presence of existing systemic antibodies to OppA as a result of existing infections.
