            "text": "Lassa virus (LASV) is the causative agent of Lassa Fever and is responsible for several hundred thousand infections and thousands of deaths annually in West Africa. LASV and the non-pathogenic Mopeia virus (MOPV) are both rodent-borne African arenaviruses. A live attenuated reassortant of MOPV and LASV, designated ML29, protects rodents and primates from LASV challenge and appears to be more attenuated than MOPV. To gain better insight into LASV-induced pathology and mechanism of attenuation we performed gene expression profiling in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) exposed to LASV and the vaccine candidate ML29. PBMC from healthy human subjects were exposed to either LASV or ML29. Although most PBMC are non-permissive for virus replication, they remain susceptible to signal transduction by virus particles. Total RNA was extracted and global gene expression was evaluated during the first 24 hours using highdensity microarrays. Results were validated using RT-PCR, flow cytometry and ELISA. LASV and ML29 elicited differential expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), as well as genes involved in apoptosis, NF-kB signaling and the coagulation pathways. These genes could eventually serve as biomarkers to predict disease outcomes. The remarkable differential expression of thrombomodulin, a key regulator of inflammation and coagulation, suggests its involvement with vascular abnormalities and mortality in Lassa fever disease.",

High viremia and elevated levels of AST in plasma are two major risk factors predicting fatal outcome [14] .

The ML29 vaccine candidate derived from Lassa and Mopeia viruses protects rodents and primates from Lassa fever disease. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy human subjects were exposed to either LASV or ML29 in order to identify early cellular responses that could be attributed to the difference in virulence between the two viruses.

While the function of the IFI35 gene is not well-defined, the IFITM proteins have roles in immune cell signaling and adhesion, cancer, germ cell physiology, and bone mineralization. IFITMs are also viral restriction factors that block entry of Influenza, Ebola, Dengue and West Nile viruses but not arenavirus-envelope pseudotyped particles [47] [48] [49] . IRF-7 is over-expressed in LASVexposed PBMC and others found that it could be up-regulated in 3-day LASV-infected monocyte-derived macrophages [50] . IRF-7 is also known to limit the burst size of LCMV in culture but is Table S1 in the supplemental material.

IRF-7 and IRF-3 are transcription factors which together with NF-kB and ATF-2/cJUN induce production of IFN-I. IRF-3 is required for the activation of IFN-b, which in turn, primes the expression of most IFN-a genes by IFN-induced IRF-7 through the STAT-1 pathway. Human SP110 plays an important role in resistance to intracellular pathogens such as human mycobacteria and intracellular cancers. Recently cellular proteins have been described that mediate the interaction of SP110 and viral proteins during viral infections [52] . Among apoptosis-related genes, the most striking difference was observed in the expression of matrix metalloproteinase, MMP-1 (interstitial collagenase), up-regulated .65-fold in LASV-exposed cells versus ML-29-exposed cells ( Table 2 ). Proteins of the MMP family normally breakdown extracellular matrix during embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. MMP-1 is known to interact with Tat, the HIV transactivating protein, and this interaction results in the degradation of Tat and depression of Tat-mediated neurotoxicity and transactivation [53] .",

Thrombomodulin (THBD), heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF), and integrin alpha M (ITGAM), were up-regulated after LASV exposure at all time-points in contrast to ML29 that downregulated them. Plasminogen activator urokinase (PLAU) and integrin beta3 (ITGB3) were mostly up-regulated with LASV exposure and remained unchanged or down-regulated with ML29. PD-ECGF (TYMP) was slightly up-regulated after exposure to both viruses. The analysis of those coagulation-related genes using the Gene Ontology (GO) software showed interaction between them and genes related to immune response ( Figure 3 ). In order to validate cDNA array results, THBD expression was measured on the surface of ML29 exposed-monocytes by flow cytometry, or quantified by ELISA in supernatants of DC exposed to LASV or ML29. There were no significant changes in thrombomodulin expression in CD14+ cells from PBMC treated with LPS or ML29 when compared with non-treated cells at 4 hpe (data not shown). However, as shown in figure 4A , there was a significant reduction in THBD expression on the surface of CD14+ cells after LPS (from ,74% control to 52% at 8 hpe and 47% at 24 hpe) or ML29 stimulus (from ,74% control to 57% at 8 hpe and 51% at 24 hpe), all in agreement with microarray results showing lower THBD RNA in ML29-exposed PBMC ( Figure 1 and Table S1 ). DC cultures exposed to LASV secreted significantly higher levels of THBD than DC exposed to ML29 (Figure 4B ), in agreement with transcriptome data. Control DC secreted 0.502 pg/ml THBD, whereas Lassa-exposed DC expressed 0.724 pg/ml THBD, significantly more than ML29-exposed DC (0.161 pg/ml). Treatment with LASV and LPS together diminished the THBD expression from 0.724 pg/ml after LASV exposure to 0.481 pg/ml. The other coagulation-related genes could also contribute to LF disease: Plasminogen activator urokinase (PLAU) expression could be contributing to the anti-clotting effect mediated by LASV exposure. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like (HB-EGF) expression is involved in several blood vessel physiologies [58] , in kidney pathology [59] , [60] , inhibition of NF-kappa B activation [61] , in cardiac hypertrophy, and together with PD-ECGF promotes vascular maturation [62] , [63] .

A given chain may combine with multiple partners resulting in different integrins. The ITGB3 is found along with the aIIb chain in platelets working as a receptor for fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, plasminogen, prothrombin, thrombospondin, fibronetin, osteospontin (SPP1), and vitronectin [64] , [65] , [66] .

This experiment was repeated with PBMC from 4 different healthy donors with similar results. After exposure to either LPS or ML29, cellsurface THBD was down-regulated by approximately 30%, at both 8 and 24 hours post exposure (hpe).

These genes were down-regulated at 4, 8 and, some, 24 hpe, suggesting a mechanism to avoid recognition by the innate immune system, and to interfere with essential signals in the pathway that leads to the development of type I immunity [73] , [74] , [75] . For example, interferon-alpha/beta inducible IFI44 is involved in the antiviral action of type I interferon [76] , [77] . ML29 down-regulation of IFI44 probably allows the virus to replicate early during the infection so that a strong immune response can control viral replication and spreading. In support of this notion, other antiviral genes such as RSAD2 (Viperin), and TRIM5 [78] , [79] , [80] were more expressed in LASV than in ML29-exposed PBMC.",

            "text": "Coagulation defects associated with LF disease could potentially be affected by LASV-upregulation of six coagulation-related genes, the most notable being thrombomodulin (THBD). THBD is predominantly synthesized by vascular endothelial cells as a 60 kDa type I trans-membrane protein that inhibits thrombotic, inflammatory and redox related responses [90] . THBD forms a 1:1 molar complex with thrombin and significantly enhances the rate of thrombin inactivation by ATIII while accelerating activation of protein C (aPC). We observed levels of secreted THBD in dendritic cell (DC) culture medium that correlated with our transcriptome data. DC exposure to LASV up-regulated secretion of THBD, whereas exposure to ML29 had the opposite effect. Notably, LPS treatment of LASV-exposed cells resulted in lowering THBD as well. In the presence of thrombin, THBD generates aPC, which inhibits pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory responses including: fibrinogen cleavage, factor V activation, platelet activation or local cytokine-induced chemotaxis for monocytes, neutrophils and up-regulation of leukocyte adhesion molecules [91] , [92] , [93] . It has been shown that THBD mRNA half-life is shortened by treatment of cells with IFN-c [94] . This observation in addition to the LASV-increased THBD expression seen here, and the absence of IFN responses seen in vitro, are in agreement with LF findings where there is no clear inflammatory response and no cellular infiltrates, in conjunction with the high viral loads seen in the presence of hemorrhagic symptoms. The absence of THBD up-regulation in the LCMV-WE infected model for LF may be a key failing of the model (see details in Table S2 ).",

It is also possible that, during high states of viremia, LASV binds directly to platelets inhibiting their function. After an arterial injury, leukocytes are recruited to the site and there is an increase in ITGAM expression allowing adhesion of platelets and fibrinogen to the vessel walls [96] . We propose that LASV induction of ITGAM could increase platelet adhesion to tissues and this may explain the decreased number of circulating platelets during hemorrhagic episodes. Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) is involved in angiogenesis and wound repair [97] , [98] . The differential expression of all those genes may be contributing to the non-pathogenic phenotype of ML29 and to the pathogenic phenotype of LASV.",

It remains to be shown whether the charge difference in LASV and ML29 GP2 proteins accounts for their different transcriptome profiles. ISG and genes involved in apoptotic and NF-kB pathways were among the most LASV-affected genes at 24 h after exposure. LASV and not ML29 also affected genes involved in coagulation pathways, e.g. LASV strongly up-regulates THBD suggesting a connection to the vascular abnormalities in fatal cases of LF. Based on our current knowledge about THBD involvement in pro-coagulant and pro-inflammatory pathways, THBD inhibition could be a promising drug target. Additionally, it is important to further investigate the immune response-related genes to elucidate the protective mechanisms that are undermined during LF pathogenesis.
