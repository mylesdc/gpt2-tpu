            "text": "A SARS-CoV lacking the full-length E gene (SARS-CoV-\u0394E) was attenuated and an effective vaccine. Here, we show that this mutant virus regained fitness after serial passages in cell culture or in vivo, resulting in the partial duplication of the membrane gene or in the insertion of a new sequence in gene 8a, respectively. The chimeric proteins generated in cell culture increased virus fitness in vitro but remained attenuated in mice. In contrast, during SARS-CoV-\u0394E passage in mice, the virus incorporated a mutated variant of 8a protein, resulting in reversion to a virulent phenotype. When the full-length E protein was deleted or its PDZ-binding motif (PBM) was mutated, the revertant viruses either incorporated a novel chimeric protein with a PBM or restored the sequence of the PBM on the E protein, respectively. Similarly, after passage in mice, SARS-CoV-\u0394E protein 8a mutated, to now encode a PBM, and also regained virulence. These data indicated that the virus requires a PBM on a transmembrane protein to compensate for removal of this motif from the E protein. To increase the genetic stability of the vaccine candidate, we introduced small attenuating deletions in E gene that did not affect the endogenous PBM, preventing the incorporation of novel chimeric proteins in the virus genome. In addition, to increase vaccine biosafety, we introduced additional attenuating mutations into the nsp1 protein. Deletions in the carboxyterminal region of nsp1 protein led to higher host interferon responses and virus attenuation. Recombinant viruses including attenuating mutations in E and nsp1 genes maintained their attenuation after passage in vitro and in vivo. Further, these viruses fully protected mice against challenge with the lethal parental virus, and are therefore safe and stable vaccine candidates for protection against SARS-CoV. PLOS Pathogens |",

A novel coronavirus causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was identified in Southeast China in 2002. SARS-CoV rapidly spread worldwide to more than 30 countries within six months, infecting 8000 people and leading to death in approximately 10% of the cases [2, 3] . While SARS-CoV has not reappeared in humans, CoVs including those similar to SARS-CoV, are widely disseminated in bats circulating all over the world, making future SARS-CoV outbreaks possible [4] [5] [6] [7] . Furthermore, in September 2012, a novel coronavirus infecting humans, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified in two patients with severe respiratory disease in Saudi Arabia [8, 9] , again indicating that emergence of other highly pathogenic CoVs is likely. Thus, development of efficacious and safe vaccines and anti-virus therapies for these pathogens is essential.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV E protein is a small integral membrane protein of 76 amino acids that contains a short hydrophilic amino-terminus followed by a hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic carboxy-terminus [20] . E protein oligomerizes to form an ion-conductive pore in membranes [21] [22] [23] , and contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) formed by its last four carboxy-terminal amino acids [24, 25] . PDZ domains are protein-protein recognition sequences, consisting of 80 to 90 amino acids that bind to peptide sequences (PBMs) [26] [27] [28] . These protein-protein interactions modulate cellular pathways important for viral replication, dissemination in the host and pathogenesis [29] . We previously demonstrated that a SARS--CoV lacking the E gene (SARS-CoV-\u0394E) was attenuated in different animal models [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , indicating that SARS-CoV E protein is a virulence factor. SARS-CoV lacking the E protein fully protected both young and elderly BALB/c mice against challenge with virulent mouseadapted SARS-CoV [32] ; therefore, rSARS-CoV-\u0394E is a promising vaccine candidate. Live attenuated vaccines are considered highly effective because of their ability to replicate within host cells, resulting in high levels of antigenic stimulation, and robust long-term immunological memory [35, 36] .",

            "text": "Interestingly, passage of SARS-CoVs lacking the E protein PBM led to regeneration of viral proteins containing PBMs, either by incorporation of novel chimeric proteins or by the insertion of new PBMs into existing proteins, such as the 8a protein or the E protein if E was only partially deleted. Strikingly, these modifications were not observed after passage of SARS-CoVs with mutated E protein that retained the PBM. In fact, we have shown that if instead of deleting the full-length E protein, only small deletions of 8-12 amino acids were introduced into the carboxy-terminus of E protein with retention of the PBM, the SARS-CoVs generated were attenuated and genetically stable both in cell culture or in mice. While this partial E protein deletion resulted in virus stability, we also augmented vaccine safety by introducing mutations into the SARS-CoV nsp1 protein. The nsp1 protein of CoVs suppresses host gene expression by inducing host mRNA degradation and inhibiting protein translation [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] , and is an IFN antagonist [45] [46] [47] . Nsp1 deletions resulted in attenuated murine coronaviruses that fully protected against the challenge with parental virus [48, 49] . In this manuscript we show that small deletions within SARS-CoV nsp1 protein resulted in virus attenuation, associated with reduction of inflammation and higher levels of IFN-\u03b2 and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Vaccination with mutated nsp1 variants protected against challenge with the virulent mouseadapted SARS-CoV (rSARS-CoV) virus. To generate safer vaccine candidates, viruses incorporating deletions in both the nsp1 and E proteins were constructed. These double mutants were protective against virulent virus challenge, and were genetically stable.",

Supernatants were serially passaged 16 times and the distal third of the genome, from the S gene to the 3\u00b4end (around 8 kb), was sequenced using specific primers (S1 Table) . In all cases, an insertion consisting of a partially duplicated M gene fused to the SARS-CoV leader RNA sequence, a 5\u00b4sequence common to coronavirus mRNAs [50] [51] [52] was detected upstream of the native M protein (Fig 1A) . In contrast, no chimeric proteins were detected after serial passage of the parental virus. All MCH genes encoded the amino terminus and the three transmembrane domains of M and also different PDZ-binding motifs at the carboxy-terminus of the protein (Fig 1B) . Genomic evolution occurred rapidly, as the chimeric genes were already detected within 5 passages in both cells lines, Vero E6 and DBT-mACE2. The expression of viral sgmRNAs corresponding to the chimeric genes was characterized by RT-PCR (S1A Fig). We used RNA harvested from infected cells after serial passage, plaque purification and amplification along with specific primers (S2 Table) . PCR products corresponding to specific MCH sgmRNAs were identified in MCH-Vero and MCH-DBT-infected cells (S1B Fig). Expression of the chimeric proteins encoded by these sgmRNAs was confirmed using an antibody specific for all M and MCH proteins and a second one that recognized the MCH-DBT protein. Vero E6 cells were mock infected or infected with different recombinant viruses (rSARS-CoV, rSARS-CoV-\u0394E, rSARS-CoV-\u0394E-MCH-Vero and rSARS-CoV-\u0394E-MCH-DBT) at a moi of 0.3. The expression of native M and MCH was confirmed at 24 hpi by Western blot analysis (Fig 1C and 1D ). These results indicated that, after serial passages of SARS-CoVs lacking the E protein in cell culture, a similar type of chimeric membrane protein was generated in three independent experimental settings.",

Vero E6 and DBT-mACE2 cells were infected with the recombinant viruses (moi of 0.001) and viral titers were determined at the indicated hpi (Fig 2) . MCH-Vero and M CH -DBT viruses showed lower titers at 24 hpi in Vero E6 cells compared to rSARS-CoV but both virus titers of the two chimeric viruses and rSARS-CoV were similar at 72 hpi. In contrast, a 100-fold decrease in viral growth was observed in rSARS--CoV-\u0394E-infected cells (Fig 2) . Interestingly, chimeric proteins seemed to be specific for each cell type, as a \u0394E virus containing a chimeric protein generated in Vero E6 cells (MCH-Vero) grew better in this cell line than in DBT-mACE cells, and the MCH-DBT virus generated in DBT-mACE2 cells specifically enhanced its growth in this cell line.

To identify such E protein functional domains, a set of recombinant SARS-CoVs (Fig 4A) , with mutations or deletions in different regions of E protein [23, 24, 53] , was passaged 16 times in Vero E6 cells (Fig 4) . In Mut 1, several amino acid substitutions were introduced at the E protein amino-terminal region. rSARS-CoV deletion mutants \u03942, \u03943, \u03944, \u03945 and \u03946 included sequential or partially overlapping small deletions of 6 to 12 amino acids in the carboxy-terminus of E protein. Interestingly, the last 6 amino acids within the \u03946 virus (YSRVKN; Fig 4) revealed an alternative PBM at the carboxy-terminal domain of the protein [53] . In recombinant \u0394PBM, the last 9 amino acids of E protein were deleted, truncating the carboxy-terminus and eliminating the E protein PBM. In mutPBM, the PBM was abolished by mutating the last 4 amino acids to glycine, maintaining the full-length E protein. In contrast, in altPBM, 4 amino acids within E protein carboxy-terminal region were mutated to alanine, maintaining an active PBM domain [24] . In SARS-CoV N15A and V25F mutants, ion channel activity of E protein was abolished by one point mutation in the transmembrane domain ( Fig  4A) . Vero E6 cells were infected with each of the recombinant viruses at a moi of 0.5 and supernatants were serially passaged for 16 times, and the presence of MCH gene was determined by sequence analysis. The results indicated that the MCH was not generated when the E protein contained a PBM sequence (rSARS-CoV, Mut 1, \u03942, \u03943, \u03944, \u03945, \u03946, altPBM, N15A and V25F) ( Fig 4B) . When the PBM was absent (\u0394PBM and mutPBM), a new PBM containing the original sequence was added to the carboxy-terminal end of mutated E protein in all cases, reinforcing the importance of the PBM domain during infection. A virus incorporating the chimeric MCH protein was only generated when E protein was completely deleted (\u0394E), i.e., when the restoration of a PBM on the E protein was not possible.",

To analyze the genetic stability of recombinant SARS-CoV-\u0394E in BALB/c mice, virus was passaged every 48 hours by intranasal inoculation. A partial duplication of 45 nucleotides was found within 8a gene (Fig 5) , leading to the incorporation of a fragment of 15 amino acids at the carboxy-terminus of 8a protein, and generating a novel 8a protein (8a-dup) with an internal PBM (CTVV) (Fig 5A and 5B ). To determine the virulence of this novel virus (SARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup), we infected a new cohort of BALB/c mice and assessed survival and weight loss, and measured virus titers. Mice infected with SARS-CoV-\u0394E did not lose weight and all survived. In contrast, SARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup grew to titers similar to those of rSARS-CoV and developed profound weight loss, developing signs of illness and death by 7 dpi (Fig 6A and 6B ). Histological examination of lungs from SARS-CoV-\u0394E-infected mice showed absence of lung damage at both dpi. In contrast, lungs of mice infected with rSARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup showed substantial perivascular, peribronchial and interstitial cellular infiltration and edema at 2 and 4 dpi ( Fig 6C) . To further confirm the relevance of the partial duplication within 8a gene in the induction of virulence, a recombinant SARS-CoV-\u0394E with an 8a-dup gene was generated (rSARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup). Virulence during infection with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup was evaluated as described above (Fig 6D) . The engineered virus (rSARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup) was as virulent as the SARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup generated after SARS-CoV-\u0394E passage in vivo ( Fig 6D) . These results indicated that SARS-CoV-\u0394E regained virulence after serial passage in mice. Mechanisms involving SARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup reversion to virulence SARS-CoV infection is associated with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [24, [54] [55] [56] . To begin to determine the basis of increased virulence exhibited by SARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup, p38 MAPK activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression were analyzed during infection (Fig 7) . p38 MAPK activation was analyzed by Western blot at 24 hpi using a phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38) specific antibody. Antibodies recognizing the total endogenous p38 MAPK and actin were used as controls. A significant increase in p38 MAPK activation, assessed at 24 hpi using a phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38)-specific antibody and Western blot analysis, was observed in SARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup-infected compared to SARS-CoV-\u0394E or mock-infected cells (Fig 7A and 7B ).",

BALB/c mice were mock- infected or infected with 100,000 pfu of recombinant SARS-CoV, and lungs were collected at 2 dpi. A significant increase in the expression of all pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs was observed during infection with virulent viruses (rSARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup) ( Fig  7C) . In contrast, infection with the recombinant virus lacking E protein at passage 0 (SARS--CoV-\u0394E) did not induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activation of p38 MAPK and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression during infection with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E-8adup were evaluated as described above. The engineered virus (rSARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup) induced similar p38 MAPK activation (Fig 7D and 7E ) and overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines ( Fig 7F) as compared with the SARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup generated after SARS-CoV-\u0394E passage in vivo. These data indicated that reversion of SARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup to a virulent phenotype was associated with an exacerbated immune response similar to that triggered during infection with the rSARS-CoV.",

To increase the genetic stability of the vaccine candidate, we introduced small attenuating deletions in the E gene, instead of deleting of the full-length E protein [53] as described above. In addition, to increase vaccine biosafety, we introduced additional attenuating mutations within the SARS--CoV nsp1 gene. To identify domains within the SARS-CoV nsp1 protein that could contribute to virulence, we compared the sequence to that of the MHV nsp1 ( Fig 8A) , with the goal of identifying conserved regions that could be functionally important. Based on this information, four mutant viruses (rSARS-CoV-nsp1 \u00c3 ) were generated by introducing deletions of 8 to 11 amino acids into the nsp1 protein (rSARS-CoV-nsp1-\u0394A, -\u0394B, -\u0394C and -\u0394D Fig 8A) . All the deletion mutants grew to similar titers as rSARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells (Fig 8B) . However the \u0394A and \u0394B mutants grew to lower titers in DBT-mACE2 cells.",

Mice infected with rSARS-CoV started to lose weight by day 2, and died by day 6 (Fig 15B) . In contrast, although mice infected with the SARS-CoV-nsp1\u0394D-E\u03943-p10M mutant initially lost 10% of their weight, at day 5 the mice started to regain weight, fully recovered from the disease, and 100% survived (Fig 15B) .

Nevertheless, unlike the parental virus, lungs of SARS-CoV-nsp1\u0394D-E\u03943-p10M-infected mice presented no significant increase of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, no obvious lung lesions, weight increases, nor substantial inflammatory cell infiltration, as determined by macroscopic and histological examination, were observed (S5 Fig). To further support the stability and attenuation of the double mutant virus, additional passages (up to 20) were conducted in mice. Evaluation of the passaged virus virulence showed that rSARS-CoV-nsp1\u0394D-E\u03943 remained attenuated ( Fig  15D) . These results indicated that despite the mutations that the virus incorporated after their passage in mice, the virus maintained the in vivo attenuated phenotype.",

In contrast, mice infected with rSARS-CoVs containing chimeric proteins generated in cell culture showed a decrease in viral titers in the lungs of infected mice even when compared with rSARS-CoV-\u0394E virus. Similarly, extensive passage in cell culture of other CoVs, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), led to less pathogenic strains compared to wild-type viruses, possibly due to the emergence of deletion mutants that lost sequence domain not needed for their growth in cell culture, but that influenced their tropism and in vivo replication [66] [67] [68] . Chimeric proteins containing a PBM inserted in the viral genome after passage increased viral fitness in cell culture in a tissue specific manner, i.e., the chimeric protein inserted into viral genome during passage in monkey cells promoted virus growth in cells from this species, whereas the one inserted during passage in murine cells specifically increased virus fitness in cells from mice. Furthermore, these chimeric proteins did not enhance viral growth nor virulence in vivo. These data indicated that the insertion of chimeric proteins specifically adapted the virus for an optimum growth in cell culture but did not enhance in vivo growth nor virulence. In this context, it is also important to note that the activity of PBMs is dependent on their specific sequence, and also on the sequence context in which they are inserted [27, 28, 69, 70] . Serial passage of rSARS-CoV-\u0394E in mice introduced a partial duplication of 45 nucleotides in the 8a protein, resulting in its reversion to a virulent phenotype. This phenotype was associated to its ability to activate p38 MAPK and to the induction of inflammatory cytokine expression and increased lung damage, as previously described [24, 71] . 8a protein is a short transmembrane protein composed of 39 amino acids that forms cationselective ion channels [72] . SARS-CoV variants with deletions in 8a ORF, have been transmitted and maintained in humans in the late phases of SARS-CoV epidemic [73, 74] . Interestingly, an 8a protein mutant generated during virus passage in vivo contained a new potential PBM (CTTV) localized in the internal region of the carboxy-terminal domain of the protein (Fig 5) . Despite the CTVV sequence was already present in the original 8a protein, it most likely does not represent a functional PBM, as it is located within the transmembrane domain of the 8a protein. Active PBMs are in general located in exposed regions of the proteins, usually the end of the carboxy-terminus or, exceptionally, in internal positions within the carboxy-terminal domain, allowing their interaction with PDZ domains, such as it has been observed in the NS5 proteins of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Dengue virus [75, 76] . However, PBMs forming part of a transmembrane domain are not accessible to PDZ-containing proteins and have not been described [29] . Therefore, the new CTVV sequence placed in an exposed environment may constitute a novel and active PBM. The PBM insertion within 8a protein after passaging in vivo could be due to the fact that the ORF8 is one of the regions where most variations were observed between human and animal isolates of SARS-CoV [4] . In fact, a complete genome sequence of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats isolates showed the presence of a PBM within the ORF8 [5] . As mentioned above, species of bats are a natural host of coronaviruses closely related to those responsible for the SARS outbreak.",

In the human genome, there are more than 900 PDZ domains in at least 400 different proteins [77] . Many pathogenic viruses produce PDZ ligands that disrupt host protein complexes for their own benefit, such as hepatitis B virus, influenza virus, rabies virus and human immunodeficiency virus, influencing their replication, dissemination in the host, transmission and virulence [29] . Generation of new proteins containing a PBM after passaging in cell culture and in mice may affect their interaction with a wide range of cellular PDZcontaining proteins, affecting diverse biological functions with high relevance in pathogenesis. E protein PBM participates in two different and independent issues, virus stability and virulence. Our data suggest that when the PBM was present in a proper environment at the end of the E protein, either a native or a mutant protein, viruses remained stable. An independent observation is that the presence of a PBM within E protein confers pathogenicity to the virus [24] . This virulence is prevented either by PBM removal [24] or by the introduction of small deletions within the carboxy-terminus of E protein [53] , which by themselves may cause attenuation or, alternatively, by indirectly affecting the PBM. Our results highlighted the critical requirement of viral proteins containing a PBM in the generation of CoVs with virulent phenotypes, and opened up new approaches for the rational design of genetically stable vaccines.",

To this end, the identification of the relevance of the presence of a functional PBM motif at the carboxy-terminus of a transmembrane protein of the virus has been instrumental in the development of a stable SARS-CoV vaccine candidate. To minimize the risk of regain of virulence after passage, we engineered viruses with small deletions in E gene, instead of deletion of the entire E gene. By preserving the PBM, we observed no evidence for the development of chimeric proteins and thus no gain in virulence. As additional measures to ensure safety of this live attenuated vaccine candidate, we incorporated attenuating mutations into nsp1, in the context of the rSARS-CoV-\u0394E or E\u03943. Nsp1 was chosen as a second attenuation target because this gene is located at a distant site (>20 kb) from that of the E gene in the viral genome, making it very unlikely that a single recombination event with a circulating wt coronavirus could result in the restoration of a virulent phenotype.",

Deletion of amino acids 121-129 and 154-165, in the carboxy terminal region of nsp1 led to virus attenuation, indicating that nsp1 enhanced virus pathogenicity, as was previously shown for MHV [45, 48, 49] . Interestingly, these attenuated mutants grew in mice to lower titers than rSARS-CoV, probably by inducing higher IFN responses, indicating that these regions of nsp1 are critical for IFN antagonism. The induction of a higher innate immune response by the nsp1 deletion is most probably responsible for the decrease in SARS-CoV-nsp1 \u00c3 virus titers observed in mice and, to a lesser extent, in DBT-mACE-2 cells. In fact, a rSARS-CoV lacking the nsp1 protein grew poorly in IFN competent cells, but replicated as efficiently as the wt virus in IFN deficient cells [46] , consistent with our findings. Similarly, titers of MHV deleted in nsp1 are restored almost to wild type levels in type I IFN receptor-deficient mice [48] .",

DNA fragments containing nucleotides 8142 to 9211, comprising the nsp1 gene of the SARS-CoV genome were generated by overlap extension PCR using as template the plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 and the primers indicated in S4 Table. The final PCR products were digested with the enzymes AvrII and BstBI and cloned into the intermediate plasmid pBAC-SfoI-MluI-SARS-CoV that contains the first 7452 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone [80] , to generate plasmids pBAC-SfoI-MluI SARS-CoV-nsp1 \u00c3 (pBAC-\u0394A, -\u0394B, -\u0394C, and -\u0394D) [80] . The plasmids pBAC-SfoI-MluI-SARS-CoV-nsp1 \u00c3 were digested with the restriction enzymes SfoI and MluI and the fragments were inserted into the plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15, digested with the same restriction enzymes, to generate pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-nsp1 \u00c3 plasmids. Mutant viruses SARS-CoV-nsp1\u0394D-\u0394E and SARS-CoV-nsp1\u0394D-E\u03943 were generated using the plasmids pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-\u0394E and -E\u03943 [33, 53] . The plasmids were digested with the enzymes BamHI and RsrII and the digested fragments were exchanged with the fragment of plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-nsp1\u0394D, to generate pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-nsp1\u0394D-\u0394E and pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-nsp1\u0394D-E\u03943 plasmids. Two fragments representing the nucleotides containing the chimeric proteins MCH-EPBM and 3aCH-3aPBM were chemically synthesized (BioBasic Inc) to generate SARS-CoV mutants. The final PCR products and synthesis fragments were digested with enzymes BamHI and MfeI and cloned into the intermediate plasmid psl1190+BamHI/SacII-SARS-CoV to generate the plasmids psl1190-\u0394E-MCH-EPBM and psl1190-\u0394E-3aCH-3aPBM. The plasmid psl1190+BamHI/SacII SARS--CoV contains a fragment corresponding to nucleotides 26045 to 30091 of the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone engineered into plasmid psl1190 (Pharmacia) [80] . These constructs were cloned in the infectious pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-\u0394E with the enzymes BamHI and SacII. Mutant virus rSARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup with small duplication of 8a protein was constructed using an infectious cDNA clone. cDNA encoding the genome of SARS-CoV-MA15-\u0394E strain was assembled in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-\u0394E) [32, 57, 80] . DNA fragments containing nucleotides 27779 to 27898, comprising the 8a gene of the SARS-CoV genome were generated by overlap extension PCR using as template the plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 and the primers indicated in S4 Table. The final PCR products were digested with the enzymes XcmI and NheI and cloned into the intermediate plasmid pBAC-BamHI-NheI-SARS-CoV that contains the nucleotides (nt) 26044 to 28753 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone [80] , to generate plasmid pBAC-BamHI-NheI-SARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup [80] . The plasmid pBAC-BamHI-NheI-SARS-CoV-\u0394E-8a-dup was digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and NheI and the fragments were inserted into the plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15, digested with the same restriction enzymes, to generate pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-\u0394E-8a-dup plasmid.
