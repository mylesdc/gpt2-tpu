The Korea Center for Disease Control (KCDC) operates a surveillance system to minimize infectious disease contagions. However, in this system, it is difficult to immediately act against infectious disease because of missing and delayed reports. Moreover, infectious disease trends are not known, which means prediction is not easy. This study predicts infectious diseases by optimizing the parameters of deep learning algorithms while considering big data including social media data. The performance of the deep neural network (DNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) learning models were compared with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) when predicting three infectious diseases one week into the future. The results show that the DNN and LSTM models perform better than ARIMA. When predicting chickenpox, the top-10 DNN and LSTM models improved average performance by 24% and 19%, respectively. The DNN model performed stably and the LSTM model was more accurate when infectious disease was spreading. We believe that this study's models can help eliminate reporting delays in existing surveillance systems and, therefore, minimize costs to society.",

It not only harms individuals, but also causes harm on a macro scale and, therefore, is regarded as a social problem [1] . At the Korea Center for Disease Control (KCDC), infectious disease surveillance is a comprehensive process in which information on infectious disease outbreaks and vectors are continuously and systematically collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Moreover, the results are distributed quickly to people who need them to prevent and control infectious disease. The KCDC operates a mandatory surveillance system in which mandatory reports are made without delay to the relevant health center when an infectious disease occurs and it operates a sentinel surveillance system in which the medical organization that has been designated as the sentinel reports to the relevant health center within seven days. The targets of mandatory surveillance consist of a total of 59 infectious diseases from Groups 1 to 4 by the KCDC. The targets of sentinel surveillance include influenza from Group 3 along with 21 infectious diseases from Group 5. Overall, a total of 80 infectious diseases in six groups are monitored. In the current Korean infectious disease reporting system, if there is a legally defined infectious disease patient at a medical organization, a report is made to the managing health center through the infectious disease web reporting system. The managing health center reports to the city and province health offices through another system and the city and province health offices report to the KCDC.",

For instance, in the traditional influenza surveillance system, around two weeks elapses between when a report is made and when it is disseminated [2] . The KCDC has been running an automated infectious disease reporting system as a pilot project since 2015. However, by 2017, only 2.3% of all medical organizations were participating in the pilot project. In medical organizations using the conventional infectious disease reporting system, a large number of missing and delayed reports can occur, which hinders a prompt response to infectious disease. As such, it is necessary to create a data-based infectious disease prediction model to handle situations in real time. Furthermore, if this model can understand the extent of infectious disease trends, the costs to society from infectious disease can be minimized.",

Among these, studies are currently being performed on detecting infectious disease using big data such as Internet search queries [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The Internet search data can be gathered and processed at a speed that is close to real time. According to Towers et al., Internet search data can create surveillance data faster than conventional surveillance systems [16] . For example, when Huang et al. predicted hand, foot, and mouth disease using the generalized additive model (GAM), the model that included search query data obtained the best results. As such, it has been reported that new big data surveillance tools have the advantage of being easy to access and can identify infectious disease trends before official organizations [17] . In addition to Internet search data, social media big data is also being considered. Tenkanen et al. report that social media big data is relatively easy to collect and can be used freely, which means accessibility is satisfactory and the data is created continuously in real time with rich content [18] . As such, studies have used Twitter data to predict the occurrences of mental illness [19] and infectious disease [20] [21] [22] [23] in addition to predictions in a variety of other scientific fields [24] [25] [26] [27] . In particular, a study by Shin et al. reported that infectious diseases and Twitter data are highly correlated. There is the possibility of using digital surveillance systems to monitor infectious disease in the future [20] . When these points are considered, using search query data and social media big data should have a positive effect on infectious disease predictions.",

However, as discussed above, it is necessary to also consider various big data and environmental factors such as weather when predicting infectious disease. In addition, in the case of models that use deep learning, it is possible to improve prediction performance by optimizing the deep learning model by optimizing its parameters. Therefore, the aim of this study is to design a model that uses the infectious disease occurrence data provided by the KCDC, search query data from search engines that are specialized for South Korea, Twitter social media big data, and weather data such as temperature and humidity. According to a study by Kwon et al., a model that considers the time difference between clinical and non-clinical data can detect infectious disease outbreaks one to two weeks before current surveillance systems [43] . Therefore, this study adds lag to the collected dataset to take temporal characteristics into account. In addition, in the design process, a thorough testing of all the input variable combinations is performed to examine the effects of each resulting dataset on infectious disease outbreaks and select the optimal model with the most explanatory power. The model's prediction performance is verified by comparing it with an infectious disease prediction model that uses a deep learning method and an infectious disease prediction model that uses time series analysis.",

The standards for the non-clinical data are as follows. Data from 576 days between 1 January, 2016 and 29 July, 2017 was used. The infectious diseases selected for this study are subject to mandatory reporting. Unlike those diseases subject to mandatory reporting, diseases subject to sentinel reporting aggregate data on a weekly basis. Since prediction is also performed on a weekly basis, it is difficult to cope with infectious diseases in real time. Therefore, diseases that are subject to sentinel reporting were excluded from the study. Moreover, the study excluded infectious diseases with an annual occurrence rate of less than 100 as well as infectious diseases that have a statistically insignificant model with an adjusted R-squared value of less than 0.25 when regression analysis is performed using all variables. Three infectious diseases satisfied all conditions, which include malaria, chickenpox, and scarlet fever. The search data was collected from the Naver Data Lab (https://datalab.naver.com/keyword/trendSearch.naver). The usage share data provided by InternetTrend (http://internettrend.co.kr/trendForward.tsp) on search engines in the health/medicine field in the first half of 2017 shows that the Naver search engine had the highest usage share (86.1%) in South Korea. Therefore, it was chosen as the search engine for extracting search data. Note that the collected search data consists of only Korean terms because the search engine is specific to South Korea. The search queries used in this study consisted of the infectious disease's proper name and symptoms (e.g., \"chickenpox\" and \"chickenpox symptoms\" in Korea). The frequency of inquiries using these search queries were used as the search data. The number of searches were normalized with respect to the largest number of searches within the study period.",

In Gyeonggi-do province, where around half of South Korea's population lives, there are many weather stations crowded together. There was a concern that simply finding the averages of the daily data for each station would cause errors to occur, so the following process was performed. First, the averages of the data from each station were collected for the eight provinces in South Korea (Gyeonggi-do, Gangwon-do, Chungcheongnam-do, Chungcheongbuk-do, Jeollanam-do, Jeollabuk-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do).

Table 2 shows the statistics for each of the infectious disease variables used in this study. In the case of temperature and humidity, the same conditions were used, which means they were put in a shared category. The data in Table 2 shows that an average of 166.76 people are infected with chickenpox daily with a standard deviation of 98.37 and the daily Naver frequency average is 33.94 with a standard deviation of 15.50. We observed that all the statistics for chickenpox are higher than those for other infectious diseases. Figure 1 shows the overall framework of the model used in this study including the data collection process and the comparison of models designed using the deep neural network (DNN) method, the long-short term memory (LSTM) method, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method, and the ordinary least squares (OLS) method. This study constructed an infectious disease surveillance model that uses non-clinical search data, twitter data, and weather data. To design the optimal prediction model, the OLS models that use all possible combinations of variables in the dataset were created. The adjusted R-squared values of each model were compared. In addition, lags of 1-14 days were added to each infectious disease and their adjusted R-squared values were compared in a preliminary analysis. A lag of seven days, which had high explanatory power for all infectious diseases, was selected as the optimal lag parameter. The optimal parameters were used to create the OLS, ARIMA, DNN, and LSTM models.",

LSTM analyses were carried out using the \"LSTM layer\" of the Keras package in the Python version 3.5.3. There are 23 parameters available in the LSTM layer. We only set the units, activation function, return sequence, and dropout. The rest of the parameters used the default values (e.g., use_bias = True, recurrent regularizer = None, recurrent_constraint = None, and unit_forget_bias = None). Figure 5 shows the parameter selection method for the deep learning approach used in this study. The Adadelta, Adagrad, Adam, Adamax, Nadam, RMSprop, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizers were compared. All parameters of each optimizer used the default values of the Keras package. For instance, in SGD, the learning late is 0.01, the momentum is 0, the decay is 0, and the Nesterov momentum is false. In addition, the following activation functions were evaluated: exponential linear unit (ELU), rectified linear unit (ReLU), scaled ELU (SELU), and Softplus. Lastly, various numbers of epochs (400, 600, 800, and 1000) were evaluated. The other parameters were fixed as follows: number of hidden layers = 4, number of units in each hidden layer = 32, batch size = 32, and drop out = 0. Prediction models with variable and fixed parameters were trained on the data and the resulting models were compared to determine the optimal prediction model.

The dataset was divided up in an 8:2 ratio and each part was used for constructing the regression model and prediction. Table 3 presents the OLS results. Each regression model had results that were below the level of significance (p < 0.05). The adjusted R-squared value was greater than 0.25 for all three infectious diseases, which means the models can be said to have significant explanatory power. Of the infectious disease regression models, the chickenpox model yielded significant results for the Naver search queries, temperature, and humidity. The scarlet fever model yielded significant results for the Naver search queries and humidity. Additionally, the malaria model yielded significant results for the Naver search queries and temperature (p < 0.05). Looking at these results together, the Naver search query data was significant for all three infectious diseases and the Twitter data was not significant for any of the three. It can be seen that the Internet search query data can be used to design an infectious disease prediction model, which was reported by previous studies. However, the results for the Twitter data differ from the results of previous studies. This is believed to be because Naver accounted for the largest share (86.2%) of Korean search engine use in the health/medicine field for the first half of 2017 while Twitter accounted for the smallest share (0.5%) of social media use in the health/medicine field for the same time period (http://internettrend.co.kr/trendForward.tsp). However, the Twitter data had an effect on the process of finding the model with the highest adjusted R-squared value. Therefore, it is expected to have an effect on future analysis as well. The temperature had a significant relationship with all infectious diseases except for scarlet fever and humidity had a significant relationship with all infectious diseases except for malaria. The values of the coefficients show that the most significant variables for chickenpox and scarlet fever was the Naver search query data (4.4589 and 2.1956, respectively) and, for malaria, it was the temperature values (0.0770). The effect of Naver search query data in particular was significant for all three infectious diseases, which confirms that it can be suitable for predicting infectious disease.",

The numbers inside the parentheses in each model's name represent the optimizer, the activation function, and the number of epochs used in the models (e.g., DNN (1, 2, 3) indicates that the optimizer, the activation function, and the number of epoch are Adadelta, ReLU, and 800, respectively). The metric used to compare the models is RMSE, which shows the difference between the actual and predicted values. A smaller RMSE value indicates a smaller difference between the actual and predicted values and indicates a higher prediction performance. Table S1 shows the RMSE and prediction graphs of the DNN and LSTM models with the lowest RMSE for chickenpox. It can be seen that the prediction graphs for each analysis method have similar shapes overall. The 10 DNN models for chickenpox had a mean RMSE of 72.8215 and a standard deviation of 1.28, which shows stable model performance. When the prediction performances of each model were compared based on RMSE, the top 10 DNN models showed a 24.45% performance improvement compared to the ARIMA model. The mean RMSE of the 10 LSTM models was 78.2850, which is higher than the DNN models. The standard deviation was 3.64, which shows that the difference among LSTM models was more marked than the difference among DNN models. Despite this, the top 10 LSTM models achieved an 18.78% performance improvement over the ARIMA model on average. There was a difference between the DNN and LSTM models' average figures and standard deviations. However, in the models with the lowest RMSE for each analysis method, there was not a big difference, which indicates that there was not a large difference in performance when the optimal parameters for each analysis method were used. Table S2 shows the RMSE and the prediction graphs of the DNN and LSTM models with the lowest RMSE for scarlet fever. The shapes of the graphs for the DNN models are similar. For the LSTM models, the shapes of the graphs are similar except for the model with the lowest RMSE. Unlike the graphs of the other LSTM models, the graph LSTM model with the lowest RMSE showed a strong tendency to follow the actual trend. This result infers that a prediction model that is better than existing prediction models can be designed by changing the deep learning parameters to achieve optimization. As is the case with chickenpox, the mean RMSE of the DNN model (34.4347) for scarlet fever was lower than that of the LSTM model (36.8140) . The standard deviation of the DNN model (0.80) was also lower than that of the LSTM model (1.37) . When comparing each model based on RMSE, the top 10 DNN models showed a 23.28% performance improvement over the ARIMA model and the LSTM models showed a 17.97% performance improvement over the ARIMA model. Table S3 shows the RMSE and the prediction graphs of the DNN and LSTM models with the lowest RMSE for malaria. Like other infectious diseases, the DNN model prediction graphs have a similar shape. However, the shapes of the LSTM model prediction graphs have a tendency to not follow the trend. The RMSEs of each prediction model, excluding the ARIMA model, showed little difference. This is believed to be because the number of malaria occurrences is fewer than those of the other infectious diseases. Therefore, adequate predictions could not be formed. diseases, the DNN model prediction graphs have a similar shape.

Figure 7 shows the chickenpox predictions of the model with the lowest RMSE out of the 10 models with the lowest RMSE for each analysis method. The DNN model with the best performance had the following specifications, which include optimizer = Adadelta, activation function = ReLU, and number of epochs = 400 (DNN (1, 2, 1) ). The LSTM model with the best performance had the following specifications, which include optimizer = Nadam, activation function = SoftPlus, epochs = 800 (LSTM (5, 4, 3) ). The OLS model's predictions had a smaller range of fluctuation than the deep learning models. From day 480, it seems to follow the trend, but it does not follow the small changes. After day 550, it cannot predict the downward shape even within a stable graph model. In short, the OLS model is not suitable as a prediction model. The ARIMA model's prediction graph has a very simple shape. This model is cyclic and there is a slight increasing trend in which the predicted value per cycle increases by a factor of about 2.5 each time. This model cannot predict the trend at all. It can only predict a stable cyclic behavior. In contrast, the DNN (1, 2, 1) predictions followed the actual occurrence trend well. Moreover, it had a large range of fluctuation, which means it made accurate predictions overall. However, when the number of occurrences rose rapidly in days 510-520, it was unable to follow these values. The LSTM (5, 4, 3) predictions had a smaller range of fluctuation than the DNN (1, 2, 1) model. Its range of variance was small, which means it had a stable shape and it performed better than DNN (1, 2, 1) when the number of occurrences rose rapidly. predictions overall. However, when the number of occurrences rose rapidly in days 510-520, it was unable to follow these values. The LSTM (5, 4, 3) predictions had a smaller range of fluctuation than the DNN (1, 2, 1) model. Its range of variance was small, which means it had a stable shape and it performed better than DNN (1, 2, 1) when the number of occurrences rose rapidly. Figure 8 shows the scarlet fever predictions of the models with the best performance for each analysis method. The DNN model with the best performance had the following specifications: optimizer = Adadelta, activation function = ELU, and number of epochs = 600 (DNN (1, 1, 2) ). The LSTM model with the best performance had the following specifications: optimizer = Adamax, activation function = ELU, number of epochs = 400 (LSTM (4, 1, 1) ). The OLS model's predictions were completely unable to follow the trend, which was similar with the chickenpox case. The ARIMA model's prediction has no particular merit because it also predicts a simple cycle. Much like its Figure 8 shows the scarlet fever predictions of the models with the best performance for each analysis method. The DNN model with the best performance had the following specifications: optimizer = Adadelta, activation function = ELU, and number of epochs = 600 (DNN (1, 1, 2) ). The LSTM model with the best performance had the following specifications: optimizer = Adamax, activation function = ELU, number of epochs = 400 (LSTM (4, 1, 1) ).

The ARIMA model's prediction has no particular merit because it also predicts a simple cycle. Much like its chickenpox prediction, it can only predict a stable cyclic behavior. The DNN (1, 1, 2) predictions were relatively close when the number of occurrences was low, but they were too low when the number of occurrences was high. LSTM (4, 1, 1) had a larger range of variance than DNN (1, 1, 2) and its predictions were close when the number of occurrences was high. In the prediction graphs for all of the top performing scarlet fever models, none of the models were able to follow the trend on days 480-500 when there was a severe variance in the number of actual occurrences. Looking at the mean of each model's predicted value for the number of occurrences, the LSTM model (88.7568) was larger than the mean of the DNN model (77.096). These same results were also seen in the case of chickenpox (DNN model mean = 237.5318, LSTM model mean = 241.5186). This showed that more suitable results can be obtained if the LSTM model is used to predict the maximum value for the number of occurrences and the DNN model is used to predict the minimum value. Figure 9 shows the malaria predictions of the models with the best performance for each analysis method. The DNN model with the best performance had the following specifications: optimizer = Adamax, activation function = SoftPlus, number of epochs = 800 (DNN (4, 4, 3) ). The LSTM model with the best performance had the following specifications: optimizer = Adadelta, activation function = SoftPlus, number of epochs = 800 (LSTM (1, 4, 3) ). The predictions of the analysis methods were not satisfactory, but the DNN (4, 4, 3) model's predictions seemed to follow the trend relatively well. The ARIMA model predicts values close to 0. It is believed that the occurrences in the malaria data are less than those of other diseases and, therefore, not suited to time series analysis because occurrences are concentrated in the summer seasons. As seen in Section 3.3, the lowest RMSEs of each prediction model excluding the ARIMA model showed little difference. LSTM (1, 4, 3) had a lower range of variance than OLS and it seemed completely unable to make predictions.

This study used social media big data and weather data, which have not been sufficiently considered in existing studies. It also used deep learning analysis, which yields high prediction performance to increase the performance of infectious disease predictions. The results showed that, when selecting the optimal parameters, adding all input variables had the highest explanatory power. This means that, by adding various data, it was possible to design a model with higher explanatory power.

It also constructed traditional prediction models such as OLS, ARIMA, and deep learning prediction models such as DNN and LSTM and compared their prediction performance to confirm that the models that use deep learning are the most suitable for infectious disease prediction. It is believed that infectious disease prediction models that employ deep learning can be used to supplement current infectious disease surveillance systems and, at the same time, predict trends in infectious disease. If this can reduce the time differences in reporting systems so that infectious disease trends can be known immediately, it is expected that immediate responses to infectious disease will become possible and costs to society can be minimized. According to a study by Shin et al., an emerging infectious disease known as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has a deep correlation with Internet search data [20] and it will become possible to expand these methods to the real-time surveillance and prediction of emerging infectious diseases as well.",

            "text": "However, this study has three limitations, which include a relatively short data collection period, regionally combined predictions, and a consideration of a narrow range of parameters in the deep learning model. The search query data collection time period used in this research was relatively short extending from 1 January 2016 to 29 July 2017. The particular spatial ranges of data were averaged across the whole of South Korea. It is believed that, if the data is expanded and the spatial ranges are subdivided, the model's performance will improve. In addition, an effort was made to change the DNN and LSTM model parameters and create a variety of prediction models, but the deep learning prediction models used in this study did not cover all the prediction models that could be implemented. Parameters such as hidden layers and batch size were not considered. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that the most effective model was created. If more parameters are considered and more prediction models are made in future research, it is believed that prediction performance can be increased somewhat.",
