However, understanding additional characteristics that predict disease outbreaks and uncovering landscape factors related to between-farm spread are crucial steps toward risk mitigation. This study integrates animal movements with environmental risk factors to identify the occurrence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreaks. Using weekly farm-level incidence data from 332 sow farms, we applied machine-learning algorithms to quantify associations between risk factors and PEDV outbreaks with the ultimate goal of training predictive models and to identify the most important factors associated with PEDV occurrence. Our best algorithm was able to correctly predict whether an outbreak occurred during one-week periods with >80% accuracy. The most important predictors included pig movements into neighboring farms. Other important neighborhood attributes included hog density, environmental and weather factors such as vegetation, wind speed, temperature, and precipitation, and topographical features such as slope. Our neighborhood-based approach allowed us to simultaneously capture disease risks associated with long-distance animal movement as well as local spatial dynamics. The model presented here forms the foundation for near real-time disease mapping and will advance disease surveillance and control for endemic swine pathogens in the United States.",

Numerous mechanisms play an apparent role in the spread of viruses between farms, including the movement of infectious animals, airborne spread of aerosols, wildlife, and contaminated fomites (i.e., trucks, equipment, boots), feed and personnel 2-5 . However, the relative importance of those drivers for between-farm transmission remains poorly understood. Movement of animals into a farm, for example, clearly increases the probability of disease introduction 6 , and understanding the network of livestock movements and analyzing the routes, volumes, frequency, and risks associated with animal movement is a prerequisite effective preventive, control, and disease surveillance measures in livestock 6-8 . At the same time, local spread of viruses between neighboring farms in close spatial proximity has been repeatedly demonstrated, perhaps mediated by windborne or fomite-related mechanisms 9,10 . A farm's risk of infection may thus be impacted not just by its own animal movements, but also by movements made by neighbors. These local spatial dynamics are rarely accounted for in network-based assessments of risks associated with livestock movement, although such dynamics are an emergent property of epidemiological models simulating disease spread in spatial networks 11, 12 .",

Briefly, PEDV is a RNA coronavirus in the family Alphacoronaviridae that causes high pre-weaning mortality in piglets 18 . The virus emerged in the United States in 2013 and rapidly spread to 30 states infecting approximately 50% of breeding herds by the middle of 2014 19 . PEDV transmission among individual pigs occurs primarily by direct and indirect contact via the fecal-oral route 19, 20 . Recent research has examined the role of animal transport in the spread of PEDV [21] [22] [23] . An analysis of the animal movement network for one swine system showed the frequency of movements declined during the initial emergence of PEDV 24 . Indirect transmission between farms may also be possible via airborne mechanisms 25, 26 . Potential environmental conditions that may facilitate virus survivability in the environment include temperature 27 and relative humidity 28 , but these environmental factors have not been integrated into broader analyses of risk factors for transmission. More generally, there is a lack of quantitative knowledge about the impact of meteorological, environmental, and topographic features (i.e. land cover, slope) on PEDV spread, though recent work on porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) suggests that there are potential relationships between environmental and topographic variables and between-farm virus transmission 29 .",

For this study, we define a neighborhood as a 10 km radius around each sow farm. First, we describe flows of pig movements into and between neighborhoods. Our second and main objective was to quantify the weekly risk of PEDV outbreaks in sow farms based on animal movements and the likelihood of exposure from neighboring farms. We evaluate the relative importance of \"neighborhood effects\" in determining infection risk, including animal movements into nearby farms, local hog density, environmental factors, and landscape structure. We used machine learning algorithms to model how potential predictors impacted whether a sow farm became infected, referred to as an outbreak, in each one-week period over the course of one year. We also identified the most influential variables on disease risk and evaluated the predictive accuracy of our models for predicting new outbreaks. Our approach for analyzing neighborhood effects on between-farm transmission significantly advances the understanding of PEDV epidemiology and spread and provides a powerful framework for analyzing the joint effect of patterns of animal movement and environmental factors on infection risk in livestock populations.",

Movements of pigs to slaughterhouses or cull sow stations were not included, as these were considered to be an epidemiological dead-end; there were also no slaughterhouses or cull sow stations located within any neighborhood.",

For each week, farms were classified as \"0\" if they were at-risk and thus susceptible to infection, and \"1\" if they reported clinical PEDV. Our goal was to predict when a farm transitioned from 0 to 1. Once a farm was infected, it was removed from that database as it was no longer considered at-risk. Given the one year duration of the study, farms were not allowed to return to 0. A 10 km radius around a sow farm was defined as a \"neighborhood\" based on reported distances of potential airborne spread of swine viruses such as PEDV and PRRS 25, 26, [30] [31] [32] . A spatial representation of sow farm neighborhoods and flows of pig movements between these neighborhoods in the first week are plotted in Fig. 3 . It is important to note that network visualizations provide a simplified view of the true dynamics of the network, and details of the day-to-day changes in the network and directionality of links are not shown. Further, we represent movements as a straight line (Euclidean distance) between neighborhoods rather than the actual transit distance of trucks on roads. For each sow farm, the 2014 PEDV outbreak history and all animal movements into neighboring farms as well as environmental and landscape variables at the level of the neighborhood was obtained (Fig. 3 , see Supplementary Material). Incoming pig movements are represented by blue lines, and were summed for all farms receiving pigs within a given neighborhood. Environmental/landscape variables (e.g. hog density): if the data layer have categorical nature, the variable was defined as the majority class (by area) within the neighborhood; if the data layer was a continuous raster, the variable was defined as the mean value within the neighborhood. (c) Descriptive analysis and machine learning approaches were used to explore the influence of neighborhood effects on outbreaks within the focal sow farm. *Dynamic variables (monthly means were calculated); # Static variables (for categorical variables, the major class was identified; if numeric, the mean was calculated-see Supplementary Information S2 for more details); for movements, the number of animals and number of batches were calculated each week. In total (n = 35, 10.5%) sow farms experienced outbreaks at some point during 2014. The number of pigs shipped into neighborhoods each week, along with total number of PEDV positive farms over time, are shown in Fig. 4 . The number of PEDV-positive farms reach the maximum during week 14 and 15 (April 2014), followed by gradual decrease. By October, less than ten neighborhoods were experiencing PEDV outbreaks. Although the number of batches per week increased slightly towards the end of 2014, movement frequencies did not seem to be substantially affected by the epidemic.",

The confusion matrix for all algorithms trained with the complete set of variables, averaged over the 10 repetitions of the 10-fold cross-validation, was used to generated accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

The AUC scores obtained for the algorithms were ~96% for RF and GBM and 92% for SVM. Accuracy estimates for the holdout test data were 97.0% (CI 95% : 96.0-98.1%) for RF, 92.4% (CI 95% : 91.0-93.8%) for SVM, and 93.0% (CI 95% : 92.2-97.8%) for GBM.

For the variable importance analysis, the eighteen variables used for model training were ranked according to their contribution to model predictions, as measured by the Gini index which represents the unscaled average decrease in node impurity (Fig. 6A) . The variable importance score (Gini Index) represents how relevant each variable was for predicting PEDV outbreaks, with larger values representing more important predictors. We also applied several additional approaches to select the most critical variables for the prediction algorithm. We calculated the \"accuracy decrease\" as the extent to which the accuracy of predictions changed when an explanatory variable was permuted relative to the outcome (Fig. 6B ). In addition, we calculated a p-value for each variable that were hypothesized to influence the occurrence of PEDV outbreaks (Fig. 6B) to evaluate whether it was used in the random forest more often than if variables were selected at random (see methods 33, 34 ). The combination of Gini Index and accuracy decrease (see Fig. 6 , y-axis: Gini decrease and x-axis: accuracy decrease) shows a natural division in importance amongst variables, with nine variables (highlighted in red in Fig. 6 ) revealed to be the most critical. The effect of these variables on the outcome was further explored via partial dependence plots, which measured the marginal effect of each variable on the outcome after controlling for the effects of all others.",

The approach presented here provides a realistic understanding of PEDV dynamics by capturing long distance spread via animal movements and linking it with epidemiological factors related to local area spread between neighboring farms. We used machine-learning algorithms to uncover factors most likely to predict PEDV outbreaks, providing crucial information toward more effective preventive actions for minimizing the risk of swine infectious diseases. Key predictors of PEDV included the dynamics of swine movements into a sow farm's neighborhood as well as environmental conditions, such as wind speed, temperature and precipitation (Fig. 6A ). The predictions generated by our model constitute an important baseline for disease surveillance and highlight directions for testable hypotheses about environmental influences on disease spread in the swine industry. If implemented, our results suggest that it could be possible to predict PEDV with substantial accuracy, explaining variation in risk even in areas with high farm density (Fig. 8) .",

In contrast to Lee et al. 16 , we did not identify a significant reduction in weekly movements as the PEDV epidemic grew in 2014 (Fig. 4) . That result may indicate that the industry may not consider the restriction or alteration of animal movements as a cost-effective or adequate measure to reduce disease spread, and highlights that different companies or geographic regions may have responded differently to the epidemic.",

In contrast to these studies, the uniqueness of our approach is that we moved beyond simply accounting for the focal farm's position in the movement network, and instead quantified the influence of movements into spatial neighbors. The hypothesis that movement of animals into a neighborhood influences disease risk in locations other than the farm that received the shipment is consistent with anecdotes by field veterinarians that viral outbreaks in a farm often occur soon after pigs were moved into a neighboring farm. While many movements do not originate from PEDV positive farms, the chance of infectious pigs being transported would increase probabilistically with the number of pigs moved. Our neighborhood-based approach allowed us to capture those local spatial dynamics, which are nearly always overlooked in analyses of livestock movement data. The importance of pigs moving into a neighborhood in our model can be interpreted as increased likelihood of a local introduction of the virus to neighboring farms.",

Season showed some association with outbreaks, with slightly higher probabilities observed during the winter and spring. However, it is difficult to determine the repeatability of seasonal patterns with only one year of data. Furthermore, seasonal effects did not seem as dramatic as other factors related to spread (Fig. 7) . Another important variable that distinguished outbreaks was the average wind speed. Spatiotemporal patterns of PEDV occurrence have been shown to be consistent with potential airborne spread 26, 45 , and PEDV viral RNA can also be recovered from air samples collected up to 16 km from infected farms 25 . Thus, the importance of wind speed is well aligned to other evidence regarding the possibility of airborne-mediated dispersal of the virus between farms, and other weather attributes such as precipitation and temperature may further influence the likelihood of this transmission mode (Fig. 7) . However, our results are correlational and it is possible that weather related effects may also influence other potential modes of PEDV introduction to a farm, such as fomites, feed, and trucks 28,36,46-48 . Our model also found a positive partial dependence between outbreaks and higher hog densities, which is an association that has also been described elsewhere for swine diseases in the United States 49 . Density dependence in transmission dynamics would be expected for most transmissible diseases 50 . However, it is interesting to note that even in areas with a high density of farms, our model still captured fine-scale spatial variation in which specific neighborhoods were at higher risk (Fig. 8 ). In addition, we identified that neighborhoods with higher altitudes and greater slope were more likely to outbreak with PEDV. This is in contrast to a study that investigated altitude and slope in the epidemiology of PRRSV, where farms in areas with higher slope (>5\u00b0) had lower rates of PRRSV outbreaks 49 . However, the area in which our study was conducted only included landscapes with a maximum of ~2.5\u00b0 slope, which may explain the discrepancy of these results. The model also found that sow farms were at reduced risk when the percent of the neighborhood that was vegetated ranged between 90 and 95%, which is similar to the finding of Arruda et al. 49 that showed that PRRSV outbreaks occurred at lower rates in farms that were surrounding by herbaceous cover and trees relative to cultivated or managed land. However, the increase in risk that we found at extremely high levels of vegetation may be due to the fact that we did not differentiate type of vegetation, and it is possible that neighborhoods with extremely high percent vegetation may be cultivated landscapes.",

It would be beneficial if movement data was available for several years. Furthermore, we have not yet considered alternate neighborhood sizes. Although our current algorithms based on neighborhood sizes of 10 km performed with considerable accuracy, suggesting that this radius indeed captures important aspects of the risk of PEDV spread, ongoing research will focus on optimizing the size of the neighborhood to maximize accuracy. In addition, our incidence database is comprised of veterinarian-reported outbreaks. While only a small number of veterinarians manage the systems included in this study, it is possible that different veterinarians used different criteria to declare outbreaks. That being said, PEDV is a pathogen with high morbidity and high mortality in swine breeding herds, and the time elapsed between introduction and detection of clinical disease in field settings is between two and five days, after which up to 80% of sows may be clinically affected 18, 51, 52 . Therefore, we have high confidence of veterinarian reports on the timing of outbreaks. Lastly, movement data was not available for one of the three swine production systems, which may have reduced our ability to predict outbreaks. However, our model performs well even in the absence of these movements, which suggests our approach is robust and the available data captures important aspects of PEDV dynamics even in the absence of full data. The goal of machine-learning algorithms is not only to produce accurate predictions, but also to provide insights on the predictive nature of the data. In addition, this modeling exercise was performed in the context of the introduction of a new virus to the swine industry, where all farms were probably na\u00efve. Predictions of PEDV in current endemic context, where the initial conditions have shifted, may be more challenging. Lastly, while our general machine learning approach has uncovered novel insights into factors related to the risk of PEDV outbreaks, the specific model built here is tuned to the region in which it was developed and thus cannot be directly extrapolated to a new region. However, our general approach could readily be applied to train models for others regions to account for their unique spatial heterogeneities. ",

Predicted probabilities of outbreaks and their contributing factors can be visualized and mapped to contribute to disease surveillance and control efforts. In general, the combination of animal movement dynamics and environmental factors suggests that PEDV outbreaks will be most likely in areas characterized by higher hog density, more pig movements, greater wind speeds and temperatures, less vegetation, and higher altitudes, precipitation and slope. Timely communication of these risks to producers is critical in the prevention of disease spread and targeting of risk mitigation methods (such as air filtration, biosecurity, etc.). Our unique approach also allows us to simultaneously capture disease risks associated with long-distance animal movement and local environmental dynamics. The model presented here forms the foundation for near real-time disease forecasting and will advance disease surveillance and control for endemic swine pathogens in the United States.",

Accuracy (ACC) was calculated as the overall proportion of observations correctly predicted. Specificity (SPE) was calculated by dividing TN by the sum of TN and FP (reported as a percentage).

To rank the importance of each variable in improving the accuracy of model predictions, we used the unscaled version of the function \"VarImp\" from the caret package. Briefly, regardless of the algorithm, the variable's importance score (i.e., Gini Index) represents how relevant each variable was for predicting PEDV outbreaks, with larger values representing more important predictors. In addition, we calculated the accuracy decrease that quantified the extent to which the accuracy of predictions changed when the variable was permuted relative to the outcome. For the best-fit algorithm (random forest), we examined how often each variable was selected by the algorithm to subdivide the data in the individual decision trees that make up the random forest; each subdivision in the tree is referred to as \"node. \" A p-value was additionally calculated for each variable to evaluate whether it was used in the random forest more often than if variables were included in decision trees at random. P-values were based on a binomial distribution of the number of nodes split on the variable assuming that variables are randomly drawn 33, 34 . The influence of the most important variables was further analyzed via partial dependence plots, which provide insights on the marginal effect of each predictor on the likelihood of a PEDV outbreak while controlling for the effects of all other variables. The partial dependence of a variable's effect is best understood by visually examining general patterns in relation to the values of the predictor variable 61 . Because we are modeling binary classification (i.e., presence/absence of PEDV outbreaks), partial dependence values are reported on the \"logit\" scale and are computed in relation to the probability for the positive class 62 ; larger values indicate higher risk of PEDV outbreak.",
