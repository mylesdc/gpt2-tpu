To enhance immunogenicity, both antigens were presented by retroviral virus-like particle produced in situ during MV-infection. All recombinant MV revealed normal growths, genetic stability, and proper expression and presentation of both antigens. Potent antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity were found in immunized MV-susceptible IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 -CD46Ge mice. These immune responses significantly inhibited metastasis formation or increased therapeutic efficacy compared to control MV in respective novel in vivo tumor models using syngeneic B16-hCD46/mCLDN6 murine melanoma cells. These data indicate the potential of MV to trigger selected tumor antigen-specific immune responses on top of direct tumor lysis for enhanced efficacy.",

In the past few years, novel treatment options have been developed that prime the immune system for tumor cell eradication. Amongst these, the presentation of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) has been shown to be a promising approach to induce potent and persisting antigen-specific T-cell responses. For this purpose, immunotherapies aim to break tolerance of the immune system against endogenous self-or to even target patient-specific mutant neo-antigens 1 . Cancer vaccines already licensed or currently in clinical trials comprise several different antigenic formats including vaccines targeting HPV antigens as the causative agent of cervical carcinoma 2 , dendritic cells loaded with antigens/peptides 3 , antigen-adjuvant conjugates (e.g. Sipuleucel-T/Provenge \u2122 ) 4 , or antigen-encoding modified RNAs 5 .",

Also GM-CSF encoding recombinant vaccine strain-derived measles viruses (MV) have been pre-clinically tested 10, 11 , but only marker-gene encoding MVs are currently developed in several phase I and two phase II clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Nevertheless, the co-expression of immune-stimulants significantly enhanced the efficacy in mouse tumor models 10, 12 . Although indicating the potential benefit of immune-stimulation, the (natural) selection of the tumor antigen(s), which the induced immunity is directed against, is presently not understood. This implies the risk of induction of autoimmune pathogenicity by selection of an antigen being also expressed on healthy tissue, especially, if combined with immuno-oncologic agents such as check-point inhibitors. To better focus induced anti-tumoral responses, other OVs, i.e. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or Maraba virus, have been equipped with expression cassettes encoding selected TAAs to direct immunity to those. However, these desired responses could only be induced by employing a heterologous prime-boost scheme using an adenoviral vector as prime, yet, since otherwise anti-OV immunity seemed too dominant 13, 14 . In parallel, recombinant MV is developed as a vaccine platform by encoding foreign antigens in extra expression cassettes, so called additional transcription units (ATUs). MV expressing antigens of a range of different pathogens have been generated and have shown protection in pre-clinical models 15, 16 as well as safety and immunogenicity in a phase I clinical trial 17 .",

VLPs can incorporate and present selected antigens of choice on their surface. For example, hepatitis B virus core antigen (HBcAg)-based VLPs presenting an immunogenic peptide of the TAA Claudin 18 isoform 2 (CLDN18.2) 34 or murine leukemia virus (MLV)-derived VLPs presenting immunogenic peptides of the amyloid beta protein 35 are able to effectively break immune tolerance against these auto-antigens.

The recombinant MVs expressed the inserted antigen(s) without critical impact on viral replication and revealed genetic stability.

            "text": "To analyze such immunotherapeutic effects, an at least partially immunocompetent animal model is necessary. For MV-driven virotherapy, this has been largely hampered by the resistance of mice and most murine cells against MV infection already at the level of cell entry, since murine MV receptor homologues are not 38, 39 or less well 40 recognized by the virus. Therefore, MV-based virotherapy has largely been analyzed in immunodeficient mice bearing human xenograft tumors. To analyze oncolytic MV in an immunocompetent mouse tumor model, entry restriction has been partially overcome by using re-targeted MV and target-transgenic murine tumor cell lines 10,12 . This system however not allowed the direct natural interaction 41 of replicating MV with immune cells due to the lack of respective MV receptors on murine immune cells. In this study, we have developed for the first time a largely immunocompetent albeit somewhat impaired, MV-susceptible tumor-bearing mouse model that allows assessment of direct and indirect interaction of the replicating MV vector with most components of the immune system in vivo. This model may therefore be more predictive for immune-mediated effects although lacking the type-I IFN-driven immune-stimulatory program, which comprises a powerful stimulus for adaptive immunity during virus infection 42 . In human patients, these limitations are not as severe since MV is a primate virus and man is the natural host. Therefore, virus-host adaptation is granted, and tumor cells are known to often up-regulate the vaccine-strain receptor CD46 43 to protect themselves from complement activity, since CD46 is the major complement regulating protein (MCP). Nevertheless, individual patients and their tumors will have to be stratified before treatment, since at least the oncolytic vaccine has to match the tumors' antigen profile, and susceptibility of primary tumor cells to measles virus infection is most likely quite advantageous to boost the lytic mode of action of such oncolytic vaccines. By additionally encoding a TAA to be presented either on the surface of infected cells or in situ produced VLPs, both cellular and strong humoral anti-TAA immune responses were induced using the MV-derived platform. Of note, humoral immunity became significant every time when the VLP-presenting vaccine has been used, an observation that may be defined more in detail by future experiments. This is even most remarkable, since the immune responses have been induced in a background lacking proper stimulation of adaptive responses by the type-I IFN pathway, which is likely to be also important for gaining full anti-tumor potency upon cancer vaccination 44 , especially since IgG-types with CDC effector function, in mice pre-dominantly IgG2a or IgG2b, became induced that are known to be typically associated with Th1-type responses. Therefore, our model may underestimate the potency of the vaccine component. Nevertheless, these tumor-specific responses substantially enhanced treatment efficacy against pre-established highly aggressive tumors and significantly inhibited metastasis formation.",

As an alternative to heterologous prime-boost, co-transfer of tumor antigen-specific T-cells 45 , or expression of cDNA libraries 46 has revealed efficacy, but this is obviously not needed when applying the MV-based vectors, despite significant immune responses also against the MV platform.

Indeed, passive immunotherapy with anti-CLDN6 mAb (IMAB027) is currently under clinical development for patients with recurrent advanced ovarian cancer (NCT02054351). Such antibodies are effective by inducing responses such as CDC and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against opsonized tumor cells 34, 48 . Here, we observed efficient killing of target-positive cells by CDC using the vaccine-induced antibodies of mouse sera that were most robustly induced when using VLP-encoding vaccines. The advantages of using an oncolytic vaccine to induce humoral anti-tumoral immunity compared to the application of respective mAbs may be two-fold: Firstly, oncolytic vaccines possess an additional mode of action by directly lysing tumor cells during virus replication. Secondly, the oncolytic vaccine induces polyclonal antibodies, thereby impairing resistance development of tumor cells harboring mutations of the single epitope targeted by a given mAb.",

Interestingly, the experiments using the vaccines encoding the DisOva model antigen may indicate some mechanistic background: Only for the VLP-encoding vaccine, induction of CD4 + T helper cells became significant. This T-cell help is required for efficient induction of humoral immune responses and may thus explain the high capacity of MV vac2 -gag-CLDN6 to induce humoral responses. Of note, the additional expression of the TAA turned out to be sufficient to induce potent anti-tumoral immune responses, different to previously studied alternative oncolytic vaccine platforms, which needed an heterologous prime for induction of anti-tumoral responses 13, 14 . Interestingly, antibody effector function as well as protection in the prophylactic setting became only significant using VLP-presented antigen, a quality that might be related to inducing a Th1-bias facilitating antibody class switch. Anyway, our data provide evidence that such targeted immune induction is more effective than virus replication alone, already acting by releasing stimulatory dangerand pathogen-associated motif patterns (DAMPs and PAMPs, respectively) during tumor cell lysis 49, 50 . Moreover, oncolytic viruses are known to additionally stimulate anti-tumoral immunity by direct or indirect interaction via infected tumor cells with immune cells 51 . This holds especially true for MV, which naturally is a lymphotropic virus, and also vaccine strain viruses reveal a strong preference for dendritic cells and macrophages in vivo 52, 53 . Moreover, the stimulatory action of such infection has already been shown 49 . These properties of the viruses allow the tumor vaccine activity also in the prophylactic setting in mice without tumors.",

The MV vaccine strain used is tested pre-clinically and clinically as platform for the generation of vaccines against at least 17 different pathogens, while the oncolytic efficacy is analysed in at least 7 clinical phase I or II trials. The recombinant vaccines provide powerful and protective immune responses in appropriate animal models and clinical testing. In this study, first evidence is provided that the MV platform combining both the oncolytic and tumor vaccination approach is even strong enough to break tolerance against endogenous tumor antigens and can thus be used to generate potent tumor vaccines. The potent and highly specific anti-tumoral immune responses significantly enhanced therapeutic efficacy in a novel, meaningful in vivo model for solid tumor growth and metastasis formation using a clinically relevant tumor antigen. Thus, oncolytic MV presenting selected TAAs may improve virotherapy efficacy by increasing the immunotherapeutic aspect of this approach.",

Ova-specific IgG antibody titers were determined as described 70 with the following modifications: Unspecific binding was blocked using casein-based blocking buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), and sera were tested pre-diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer. HRP-conjugated secondary goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:15,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Newmarket, UK) was used for detection. For non-linear regression analysis (curve fit), a standard curve was generated using anti-Ovalbumin mAb A6075 (Sigma-Aldrich) in serial dilutions. The IgG concentration of samples was calculated from \u0394OD values using GraphPad Prism. FACS binding assay. Antibody binding to native epitopes was analyzed by FACS as described 34 with CT26 (mCLDN6) or CHO-hCLDN9 cells as targets. Non-purified serum samples and an AlexaFluor488-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used for staining, while using FACSCantoII equipment (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). Neutralization Assays. Virus neutralizing titers (VNT) were determined as described 16 . ELISpot Assays. Murine IFN-\u03b3 ELISpot assays were performed as described 60 using 5 \u03bcg/ml per peptide of an overlapping mCLDN6 peptide mix (JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH, Berlin, Germany) for re-stimulating CLDN6-specific T-cells. The specificity of mCLDN6 reactivity was controlled by using 5 \u03bcg/ml ISQ-peptide for stimulation. Wells with too many spots to be separated were set to 750 spots (maximum spot count reliably determined).",
