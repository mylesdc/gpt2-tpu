All the compounds were tested for their antiviral (H1N1 and H3N2) activity. Compounds 2 and 3 showed significant activity against H3N2 with the prominent IC 50 values of 6.2\u02d80.08 and 8.9\u02d80.3 \u00b5M, respectively. In addition, compound 2 also exhibited inhibitory activity against H1N1 with an IC 50 value of 3.5\u02d81.3 \u00b5M.",

This is exemplified by the recent Ebola virus outbreak in Western Africa and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea [1] . Meanwhile, influenza viruses are still a great threat to human health [2, 3] . So far, only two classes of antiviral drugs, which include amantadine and the neuraminidase inhibitors, are currently used as anti-influenza therapeutic drugs, but both of them have some adverse side effects in humans as well as the resistance of the virus towards this drug [4, 5] . Hence, a concerted effort is aimed at discovering new antiviral agents to treat and eradicate these infectious agents [6, 7] .",

To further the scope of this particular research theme, a fungus, Aspergillus sp. SCSIO XWS02F40, attracted our attention because its crude EtOAc extract exhibited potential antiviral activity. Further isolation yielded three new compounds: asteltoxin E (2), asteltoxin F (3) and 7-hydroxy-2-(2-hydroxypropyl)-5-pentylchro mone (4), together with four known compounds: asteltoxin (1) [9] , sterigmatocystin (5) [10, 11] , dihydrosterigmatocystin (4), together with four known compounds: asteltoxin (1) [9] , sterigmatocystin (5) [10, 11] , dihydrosterigmatocystin (6) [11, 12] , diorcinol (7) [13, 14] (Figure 1 ). The antiviral (H1N1 and H3N2) activities of these compounds were individually evaluated. Herein, we described the isolation, structural elucidation, and bioactivity screening of these metabolites 1-7 from Aspergillus sp. SCSIO XWS02F40. ",

The molecular formula of 2 was established as C28H36O9 by the HRESIMS data (m/z 517.2440 [M + H] + ), requiring 11 degrees of unsaturations. The UV spectrum showed maxima at 356, 300, 267, 211 nm, indicating the presence of an extended conjugated moiety. The IR spectrum exhibited absorptions for a hydroxy group at 3390 cm \u22121 and an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl group at 1697 cm \u22121 [15] . Close inspection of the 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectra (Table 1 , Figures S1 and S2) of 2 using DEPT and 1 H-13 C correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) revealed the presence of six methyls (one oxygenated), two methylenes including one oxygen-bearing, 12 methines including three oxygenated methines, one double oxygenated methine (\u03b4H 5.27, \u03b4C 111.9) and eight olefinic methines ,as well as two sp 3 quaternary carbons (one oxygenated), four sp 2 quaternary carbons, including two oxygenated carbons (\u03b4C 154.7, 169.5) and two ester carbonyls (\u03b4C 163.7, 167.5). Comparing UV-vis and NMR data of compound 2 with those of asteltoxin (1) [9, 16, 17] revealed a high degree of similarity and a difference in the substituents of C-17. HMBC correlations observed from H3-28/C-24, C-25, C-26, H3-23/C-24 and H2-27/C-24, C-25, C-26 indicated the existence of a methyl crotonate moiety. In addition to this, the HMBC correlation of H2-27/C-17 and the chemical shift values of C-17 (\u03b4C 169.5) and C-27 (\u03b4C 65.9) suggested that C-27 was linked with C-17 through an oxygen bridge. Based on these analyses, the planar structure of 2 was determined to be as shown in Figure 2 .",

The 1 H-1 H COSY correlation of H2-14/H2-15, H2-17/H3-18 and HMBC correlations of H3-18/C-16 and C-17, H2-15/C-16 and C-17 indicated the presence of a pentyl moiety. In addition, the HMBC correlation of H3-14/C-5, C-6 and C-10 suggested that the pentyl was located at C-5 ( Figure 4 and Table 2 ). The absolute configuration of C-12 was established by comparison of the optical rotation of compound 4 r\u03b1s 25 D = +17.11 (c 0.31, MeOH) with that of 7-Hydroxy-2-(2-hydroxypropyl)-5-methyl chromone: r\u03b1s 25 D = +32 (c 0.02, MeOH) [21, 22] . Thus, this establishes the absolute configuration of C-12 to be S. Thus, the structure of compound 4 was determined and named as 7-hydroxy-2-(2-hydroxypropyl)-5-pentylchromone.",

Compounds 2 and 3 are analogues of asteltoxin. Compound 4 is a new chromone derivative and its pentylbenzene moiety is a rare incidence in nature. Compound 5 is a liver carcinogen and forms DNA adducts after metabolic activation to an epoxide at the furofuran ring [24] . It is noteworthy that compound 5 was obtained in a scale of 4.7 g and a new dimensional pharmacokinetic research of this compound is a part of our ongoing mission. In the screening to search for seeds of antiviral agents, compounds 2 and 3 showed significant activity against H3N2 with the prominent IC 50 value of 6.2\u02d80.08 and 8.9\u02d80.3 \u00b5M; respectively. In addition; compound 2 also exhibited inhibitory activity against H1N1 with IC 50 value of 3.5\u02d81.3 \u00b5M. Compounds 2 and 3 were published online on 30 November 2015 as new compounds after the date we submitted on 2 November 2015 [25] .",
