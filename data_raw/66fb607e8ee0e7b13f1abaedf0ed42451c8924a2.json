            "text": "Human adenoviruses (HAdV) are a common cause of acute respiratory diseases, causing sporadic infections, as well as community and institutional outbreaks. 1 Infection with HAdV rarely causes serious or fatal illness in otherwise healthy individuals, but may cause severe disease in newborn, elderly, or immunocompromised persons. 1 There are at least 69 recognized HAdV genotypes (http://hadvwg.gmu.edu/), which are assigned to seven subgroups (A-G) according to biophysical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics. 2 The spectrum of clinical disease associated with HAdV is broad and depends largely upon the infecting HAdV genotype. Clinical signs and symptoms include fever, rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, bronchitis, pneumonia, acute hemorrhagic cystitis, meningoencephalitis, and rarely life-threatening disseminated diseases. 1 New adenovirus genotypes are increasingly recognized through the use of phylogenetic analysis based on complete genomic sequences. Novel strains may arise from mutations or recombinations of two different adenovirus strains between the hexon gene and fiber genes. 3, 4 Recently, an emergent variant, HAdV-55, 5, 6 with a proposed recombination of hexon gene between HAdV-11 and HAdV-14 strains, has been described in association with multiple outbreaks of acute respiratory disease, mostly occurring in military camps. [7] [8] [9] [10] In 2005, a large outbreak of acute respiratory disease likely from HAdV-55 occurred in a military camp in Turkey. 8 Another two HAdV-55 outbreaks occurred among military training camps in 2005 (226 patients in Singapore 9 ) and in 2009 (108 patients in China 10 ). Nucleotide sequence analysis showed the strains from the two outbreaks were highly similar to the QS-DLL strain, which was the first HAdV-55 in China isolated from an ARDS outbreak in Shaanxi in t 2006 that occurred in a senior high school. 7 The most recent HAdV-55 outbreak occurred in February 2012 among patients with febrile respiratory tract infection admitted to PLA 252 hospital, Hebei Province, China (unpublished data). With rare precedent circulation of HAdV-11 and HAdV-14 in China, an increasing trend of adenovirus type 55 infections was observed among both civilian and military populations, probably due to the lack of immunity herd. This concern, in combination with its higher tendency in causing severe respiratory illness than other adenovirus, posed great threats to Chinese military that it has the potential to spread widely and cause severe epidemics. The status highlights the need for improved surveillance, with extensive molecular characterization, to identify the prevalence and the genetic variants of this emerging adenovirus. Thus far, HAdV surveillance in China is sparse, and HAdV-55 infections were chiefly identified during outbreak events. The current study was sought to acquire a better understanding of the prevalence and molecular evolution of HAdV-55 strains by performing an active surveillance for HAdV infections. This knowledge might assist with targeted population for disease prevention and geographic regions where type-specific vaccines should be administered if developed.",

These results suggested a possible recombination event occurred at a position between hexon gene and fiber gene, between mainland China strain and Taiwan strain, which resulted in the formation of the Singapore strain. All the strains in mainland of China seem to be different from other regional HAdV-55 strains. These characteristics might reflect either spatial or temporal dynamics of HAdV-55.",

The reason of this close relationship needs to be illustrated. A possible explanation is that all these HAdV-55 strains are derived from different lineages of a common ancestor. Data from the phylogenetic tree and molecular clock analysis suggest HAdV-55 evolved with a certain evolution rate and geographic subdivision occurred during the last 35 years, as well as Chongqing HAdV-55 strains were accumulating mutations at a certain speed from 2010 to 2012. Further molecular investigation based on HAdV-55 of wider origin might facilitate to understand its dissemination and transmission in China.",

Surprisingly, the closest genetic relationship existed between CQ-2903 and QS-DLL (Shaanxi 2006 strain). The comparisons of variations for all the HAdV-55 whole genome sequences were shown inFigure 3. Most variations were missense mutations and silent mutations. The indels occurred frequently in the ends and 10 000-180 000 bases. Phylogenetic analysis of human adenovirus based on partial hexon gene covering hypervariation regions 1-7 (nt 18353-20956, corresponding to the QS-DLL strain) and fiber gene (nt 30817-31752) was constructed using neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates.
