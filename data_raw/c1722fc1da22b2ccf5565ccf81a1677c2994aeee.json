We found that neutrophil elastase directly triggered human adenocarcinoma A549 cell migration and that EGCG suppressed the elevation of tumor cell migration induced by neutrophil elastase. We observed that EGCG directly binds to neutrophil elastase and inhibits its enzymatic activity based on the CDOCKER algorithm, MD stimulation by GROMACS, SPR assay and elastase enzymatic activity assay. As the natural inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, \u03b11-antitrypsin is synthesized in tumor cells. We further demonstrated that the expression of \u03b11-antitrypsin was up-regulated after EGCG treatment in neutrophil elastasetreated A549 cells. We preliminarily discovered that the EGCG-mediated induction of \u03b11-antitrypsin expression might be correlated with the regulatory effect of EGCG on the PI3K/Akt pathway. Overall, our results suggest that EGCG ameliorates the neutrophil elastase-induced migration of A549 cells. The mechanism underlying this effect may include two processes: EGCG directly binds to neutrophil elastase and inhibits its enzymatic activity; EGCG enhances the expression of \u03b11-antitrypsin by regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway.",

The clinical relevance of AAT is demonstrated in individuals with an inherited deficiency in circulating AAT, who exhibit increased susceptibility to early-onset pulmonary emphysema and liver and pancreatic diseases 12 . Neutrophil elastase and AAT are a protease and protease inhibitor counterpart pair 13 . It has been assumed that in AAT-deficiency, the protease/ anti-protease balance is shifted toward HNE, which leads to extensive tissue damage, particularly by causing emphysema.

The program was run using a Dell Optiplex755 server (Round Rock, TX). The CDOCKER algorithm employed a strategy involving the generation of the initial ligand orientation in the active site of the target protein followed by molecular dynamics (MD)-based simulated annealing and final refinement via energy minimization. The crystal structure of HNE (PDB ID: 2Z7F) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (http://www. rcsb.org/pdb/). The water molecules in the protein were removed, the protein was refined based on the root mean square deviation (RMSD), and EGCG was docked to the protein according to the appropriate parameters. Beginning from the EGCG configuration, a set of 10 different orientations was randomly generated. The co-crystalized ligand SEI300 was used as the positive control ligand, and the binding site was defined based on the binding of SEI300 and HNE. The interaction energy was calculated to analyze the interaction between the ligand and the receptor. Once the ligand was docked to the active site, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed using the GROMACS 4.6.6 program. The GROMOS96 53a6 Force Field and the SPC/E water condition were selected during the topology process. Water was position-restrained using a force constant (kpr) of 1000 kJ mol \u22121 \u00b7nm \u22122 . The protein was placed in the box at least 1.0 nm from the box edge, and the box was defined as a cube. During the GENION process, 10 Cl \u22121 were added to the system for charge equilibration. A 30-ns MD simulation was performed. The GROMACS program was used to constrain the bonds involving hydrogen atoms, allowing for an integration interval of 2 fs. The particle mesh Ewald method using a threshold of 1 nm was employed to account for the electrostatic interactions. A threshold of 1 4 nm was used for the van der Waals interactions. The non-bonded pair lists were updated every 0.010 ps. The coordinates were saved every 1 ps. Accuracy testing was performed by calculating the RMSD after re-docking the internal ligand to the protein using the algorithm.",

The results from the MTS proliferation assay showed that neutrophil elastase at a concentration of at least 20 nM enhanced tumor cell viability; among all of the concentrations tested, 40 nM neutrophil elastase displayed the strongest effect (Fig. 1B) . Thus, we selected 10 nM neutrophil elastase as the intervention condition. The MTS proliferation assay results showed similar cell viability between the control group and the groups treated with various concentrations of EGCG (Fig. 1C ) and also showed a non-significant change in cell viability between the group treated with neutrophil elastase (10 nM) and the groups treated with EGCG and neutrophil elastase (10 nM). However, in the wound healing assays, the cells treated with 10 or 20 \u03bc M EGCG migrated at a much slower rate than the control cells and the cells treated with neutrophil elastase (10 nM) ( Fig. 2A,B) , suggesting that EGCG displays anti-migratory properties. To confirm this result, we performed further cell migration assays using the transwell chamber model. As shown in Fig. 2C ,D, the group treated with 10 nM neutrophil elastase displayed significantly more migrating A549 cells than the control group. Alternatively, treatment with either 10 or 20 \u03bc M EGCG (after exposure to 10 nM neutrophil elastase), resulted in dramatically fewer migrating A549 cells than the control treatment and treatment with neutrophil elastase (10 nM) alone. These results indicated that treatment with EGCG at a concentration between 10 and 20 \u03bc M induces a substantial anti-migratory effect without affecting the proliferation of A549 cells exposed to neutrophil elastase.",

Nevertheless, the vimentin protein levels were clearly down-regulated in response to EGCG treatment in the presence or absence of HNE (Fig. 3B,C) .

The active binding site between EGCG and HNE (PDB ID: 2Z7F) was defined as the ligand-binding site with a 9-\u00c5 radius. As anticipated, EGCG stably docked to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) (Fig. 4B) . At least 8 residues in the LBD were involved in the interaction between EGCG and the HNE protein. EGCG potentially formed hydrogen bonds with SER166, THR165, ARG217 and ARG178. Moreover, EGCG possessed a potential aromatic interaction with ARG177 (Fig. 4D) . The binding mode of EGCG in the LBD of HNE provided detailed structural insight into the interaction between this compound and the HNE protein. Furthermore, we performed a 30-ns MD process using GROMACS 4.6.6 software. The time-averaged normalized ratio of the gyration radius, the RMSD, hydrogen bonds and the GROMACS energy were analyzed to reflect the distribution of EGCG molecules surrounding HNE. The gyration radius and the RMSD of the ligand EGCG and the receptor HNE trended toward stability as time progressed (Fig. 5A,B) .

EGCG suppresses proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by Toll-like receptor 9 agonists in prostate cancer cells 21 . In addition, EGCG suppresses lung cancer cell growth via Ras-GTPase-activating protein SH3 domain-binding protein-1 22 . Many molecules are involved in the anti-tumor activity of EGCG, including JAK/STAT, MAPK, PI3K/Akt, Wnt, Notch, NF-\u03ba B and AP-1 23 . Because cancer progression is a complex process, its pathogenic mechanism remains somewhat elusive. EGCG is considered as a natural multi-targeting chemopreventive agent. Thus, the possibility that EGCG inhibits tumor development via alternative mechanisms cannot be excluded. The purpose of this study was to investigate the novel inflammation-related mechanisms by which EGCG mediates anti-cancer migratory activity in lung cancer. Recent studies suggested that chronic inflammatory pulmonary diseases such as emphysema are highly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, independent of smoking 24 . HNE, among the most potent proteinases released by neutrophils, is considered to be responsible for the elastolytic damage in emphysema 25 . To some extent, neutrophil elastase may represent the link between emphysema and lung cancer. Recent reports showed that modest levels of neutrophil elastase led to the uncontrolled proliferation of A549 lung epithelial tumor cells 19 . We found that HNE treatment (10 nM) enhanced the , the pAkt (Thy308)/ Akt ratio (D), the pAkt (Ser473)/Akt ratio (E) and the pPI3K/PI3K ratio (F) in A549 cells treated with neutrophil elastase, EGCG and sivelestat sodium.

            "text": "As AAT is the specific and primary inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, we assumed that AAT might mediate the inhibitory effect of EGCG on neutrophil elastase-induced cell migration in vitro. AAT is predominantly synthesized in liver but is also expressed in extra-hepatic tissues and cells, including carcinoma cells 29 . The role of AAT in cancer development has been supported by some laboratory data; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the role of AAT in tumor cell migration is poorly understood. The primary function of AAT is the inhibition of neutrophil elastase. Our results indicated that the protein levels of AAT in A549 cells were clearly increased after treatment with EGCG. However, the contribution of AAT to the tumor development is somewhat controversial. In contrast to its effects against tumor growth, AAT has been shown to be correlated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma 30 and with the inhibitory effect of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) on the proliferation and invasiveness of lung cancer HCC cells 31 . Upon binding to neutrophil elastase, AAT activates cleavage within the reactive site loop (RSL) in a suicidal action 32 . Evidence has indicated that the AAT levels are significantly elevated in the skin of NE \u2212/\u2212 mice compared with NE +/+ mice in a murine model of the autoimmune disease bullous pemphigoid 33 . It has been reported that the deficiency of circulating AAT is highly associated with lung inflammation and, especially, the early onset of pulmonary emphysema 34 . Additionally, clinical findings have indicated that AAT, which is elevated in the serum of cancer patients, is a serum biomarker for the diagnosis of lung cancer and prostate cancer 35 . Previous studies showed that EGCG inhibits PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in various tumor cells 4, 36 . Our previous data demonstrated that the inhibition of neutrophil elastase-induced cell proliferation using curcumin (a type of polyphenol similar to EGCG) is also dependent on the PI3K pathway in A549 cells 14 . Recently, it was shown that neutrophil elastase released by activated neutrophils within the lung is absorbed by adjacent epithelial tumor cells and degrades IRS-1, which is a binding partner of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, thereby inducing the hyperactivity of the PI3K pathway, which leads to uncontrolled tumor cell proliferation 19 . Our results showed that the neutrophil elastase-induced decrease in IRS-1 expression was significantly inhibited by EGCG in A549 cells. The suppression of Akt and ERK1/2 has been thought to mediate the anti-tumor migration property of EGCG 37 . Therefore, we explored whether EGCG treatment remarkably suppressed neutrophil elastase-induced phosphorylation and activation of PI3K/Akt. Our results showed that the expression of Ser473-phosphorylated Akt was increased in neutrophil elastase-induced A549 cells and was down-regulated after co-treatment with EGCG and neutrophil elastase. Moreover, we observed the phosphorylation of Akt at Thy308. Compared with the regulation of Ser473 phosphorylation, the phosphorylation state of Thy308 was not significantly changed after treatment with neutrophil elastase. These results indicated that the migration-promoting effect of neutrophil elastase was not mediated by Akt phosphorylation at Thy308 but might be mediated by the regulation of p473-Akt. In the positive control group, neither p308-Akt nor p473-Akt expression was significantly changed after treatment with the inhibitor of neutrophil elastase sivelestat sodium. We speculated that sivelestat sodium, as a selective neutrophil elastase inhibitor, cannot suppress the metastasis of lung cancer, in contrast to the multi-targeting natural product EGCG, via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",

However, the molecules and signaling pathways that modulate the expression of AAT remain unclear, and it is important to explore the mechanisms that regulate AAT, which is a SERPIN that is highly related to lung inflammation and lung cancer. Additionally, the role of EGCG in the neutrophil elastase-induced induction of tumor metastasis and growth in other xenograft murine models of lung cancer remains to be investigated.",
