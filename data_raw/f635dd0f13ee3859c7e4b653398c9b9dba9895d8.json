In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the antiviral activity of crude extracts from B. licheniformis against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a highly contagious enveloped porcine virus that has caused great economic loss in pigs. In vivo, PEDV-infected piglets supplemented with air-dried solid state fermentative cultivate containing B. licheniformis-fermented products (BLFP) showed milder clinical symptoms and decreased viral shedding. Importantly, no significant systemic pathological lesions and no reduction in average daily gain were noted in pigs supplemented with the BLFP, which suggests that it is safe for use in pigs. In vitro experiments revealed that while B. licheniformis crude extracts exhibited no toxicity in Vero cells, co-cultivation of B. licheniformis crude extracts with PEDV significantly reduced viral infection and replication. Summarized current results suggest that the B. licheniformis-fermented products could be a novel candidate food additive for reducing the impact of PED on the swine industry. which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.",

The virus causes porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), which is characterized by watery diarrhea, vomiting, and severe dehydration in pigs of all ages, especially suckling piglets (Lee 2015; Song and Park 2012) . This highly contagious disease has spread quickly in porcine industries in several countries (Jung and Saif 2015; Lee 2015) . Furthermore, PEDV infection causes severe perturbations of gut microbiota, reducing probiotic bacterial abundance, enriching pathogenic bacteria, and even impairing the growth performance of PEDV-surviving pigs (Alvarez et al. 2015; Deping Song et al. 2017) . The development of effective protective agents against PEDV infection is urgently needed.",

This viral threat has prompted a global effort to develop antivirals against new variant PEDVs in vitro (Song and Choi 2011; Kwon et al. 2013) and in vivo (Cho et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2015) . Herein, we demonstrated that: (1) BLFP crude extract presents no cell toxicity to Vero cells, and exhibits significant antiviral ability against PEDVPT-P6 in Vero cells when biosurfactants are co-cultivated with PEDV; (2) Piglets supplemented with BLFP at concentrations of 5 kg/ton or less exhibited milder clinical symptoms and lower viral shedding compared to piglets supplemented with control food, and BLFP caused no significant toxicity. Therefore, BLFP is suggested to be a promising novel feed additive that can act as an additive against PEDV in the field. The main antiviral mechanism of BLFP crude extract is thought to be related to its unique biochemical structure that increases membrane permeability to disrupt and lyse microbial membranes (Huang et al. 2006 performing a direct-virucidal study of BLFP crude extract against PEDV, a ten-fold reduction of the viral titer was able to confirm the directed-antiviral ability of BLFP crude extract. According to our HPLC analysis, a peak of surfactin-like peptide was identified in the BLFP crude extract. Several different potential antiviral mechanisms of biosurfactants have been previously reported (Vollenbroich et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2017) . Lipopeptide biosurfactants have been previously suggested to possess probiotic attributes for animal and human use (Schneider 1998; Sen 2010) . A previous study demonstrated that the antiviral ability of surfactin from B. subtilis was achieved through competition with the TGEV entry receptor . The inhibition of viral enzymes such as proton-ATPase that are required for the entry of some viruses into cells by surfactin from B. subtilis (Vollenbroich et al. 1997 ) has also been reported. It is worth noting that not only did co-cultivation of the surfactin-like peptide in the BLFP crude extract with PEDV-infected Vero cells significantly reduce viral infection and replication in the study, but BLFP crude extract-treated PEDVinfected cells also exhibited an undetectable extracellular viral titer, suggesting that BLFP crude extract may play an important role in reducing the release of virions. These results suggest additional mechanisms of BLFP crude extract against PEDV in Vero cells. Although further study of the antiviral mechanisms of BLFP crude extract is needed in the future, observation of the diverse antiviral activities of BLFP crude extract will lead to further development of this new therapeutic candidate. Previous studies demonstrated that lipopeptides produced by various Bacillus spp. were safe in mice (Youn-Hwan Hwang et al. 2008 ) and weaned piglets (Torres et al. 2017) when administered under a certain concentration. In order to use BLFP as a feed additive for its antiviral properties, assessment of its antiviral and safety profile in pigs is essential. Our results demonstrated that piglets supplemented with BLFP show milder symptoms Fig. 8 Replication kinetics of PEDV in Vero cells treated with or without BLFP crude extract. a Extracellular viral titers in the supernatants of PEDV-infected Vero cells treated with and without BLFP crude extract were determined by viral titration in Vero cells using the Reed-M\u00fcench method and expressed as the 50% TCID 50 /ml. b Extracellular viral RNA levels in the supernatants of PEDV-infected Vero cells treated with or without BLFP crude extract were determined by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. c Intracellular viral titers in PEDV-infected Vero cells treated with or without BLFP crude extract were determined by viral titration in Vero cells. d Intracellular viral RNA levels in the supernatants of PEDV-infected Vero cells treated with or without BLFP crude extract were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test, and statistically significant differences were labeled with *(p < 0.05) and have reduced viral shedding. Importantly, no significant systemic pathological effects and no changes in average daily gain were noted. These results suggest that the biosurfactants at concentrations of 5 kg/ton or less will be very safe in pigs in future applications. In a previous study, it was found that administration of surfactin from B. subtilis at over 500 kg/ton leads to necrosis of hepatocytes in rats (Hwang et al. 2009 ). In the future, animal experiments using higher dosages of biosurfactants would be necessary to validate its maximal safety dosage.",
