However, no studies have evaluated mental health in individuals isolated due to risk of infection. During the MERS epidemic, more than 80% of the population feared MERS infection [10] . It can be assumed that individuals isolated for 2-week due to being in contact with MERS patients had greater anxiety symptoms and anger such as fear, isolation, and social stigma. With MERS being well-known for a mortality rate of 20%, it is thought that isolated patients had as much fear of being infected as those diagnosed with MERS. However, the effect of 2-week of isolation on the mental health of isolated individuals is not known. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and anger in isolated individuals due to being in contact with MERS both at isolation period and at four to six months after release from isolation. Additionally, we determined the factors associated with these symptoms at four to six months after release.",

Four hundred nine individuals (30.0%) had difficulties preventing them from participating in the study and reasons for refusal included the following: death in the family, nursing, inpatient hospitalization and surgery, work, opposition from the family, argument for inadequate qualification as a study subject, and reluctance to be known as a study subject. Three hundred fourteen individuals could not participate in the study for personal reasons, and eight individuals were not studied.

GAD-7 is a self-administered test to assess generalized anxiety disorder that is composed of 7-item highly relevant questions selected from a total of 13 items (nine questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, 4th ed. and four questions from the Anxiety Symptom Scale) [14] . For each of 7 items, subjects were asked about how frequently they felt each one during the isolation period for MERS and again four to six months after removal from isolation. The 4-point Likert scoring system was used as follows: not at all (0 point), several days (1 point), more than half the days (2-point), nearly every day (3-point). Higher scores implied greater anxiety symptoms. The total score ranged from o to 21, with a score range of 5-9 points classified as mild anxiety symptoms, 10-14 points as moderate anxiety symptoms, and greater than 15 points as severe anxiety symptoms. In the present study, a total score greater than or equal to 10 points was set as a cutoff score for moderate anxiety symptoms and individuals with that score were categorized into the anxiety group. In the study, Cronbach's alpha was 0.95.",

As of June 10, 2015, amid the MERS epidemic, people were isolated in 17 cities nationwide. There were nearly 500 people in isolation in areas where there was a major outbreak, and entire villages in some areas were isolated. At that time, the number of people isolated at home reached 3,000 nationwide, and there was a trend increasing by 200 to 300 people per day. With the rapid spread of MERS into Korean society, it is likely that people who were to be isolated had fears of infection and anxiety over MERS which had over a 20% mortality rate, concern over social isolation, and anxiety over the possibility of spreading infection to family members if isolated at home. Since community health care center staff members were monitoring the state of isolation to prevent MERS spreading further, it is likely that those isolated had high levels of anxiety over the fear of their isolation becoming a stigma among their neighbors. During the MERS epidemic, 80.2% of the general public reported fear of being infected, and 46% reported emotional distress. Risk factors associated with increased rates of fear were the following: concern about public transportation use, difficulty going outside, perception that the state is not protecting the people, helplessness in situations that cannot be controlled, and fear of infection [10] .",

Anxiety symptoms were determined based on 10 or more of the GAD-7 score were determined to have anxiety symptoms. A moderate range of anxiety symptoms is defined as having difficulty in daily life due to anxiety for an average of 10.7 to 16.8 days out of a 3-month period, as well as having 2.2 to 2.4 hospital visits due to anxiety symptoms [14] . When the GAD-7 cut-off point is set as 10 points or higher, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms in the general population is estimated to be around 3.3%. This is much lower than the prevalence rate of anxiety disorder (6.8%) using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview of the nationwide mental health epidemiologic survey in 2011 [15] . This suggests that there is a possibility of underestimating the actual prevalence of anxiety symptoms when the GAD-7 cut-off point is set as 10 points or higher. When anxiety symptoms in the Ansan and Gyeonggi areas were measured by the GAD-7 four to six months after the sinking of the passenger ship on April 16, 2014, 6.4% of residents in the Ansan area and 3.3% in the Gyeonggi area reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety symptoms [16] . When comparing these results, isolated people appear to have recovered to normal levels of anxiety four to six months after removal from isolation. However, among 19% of those in the 1st rank group who had anxiety symptoms during isolation During the isolation period, relief supplies must be provided on a timely basis. Precise information about the symptoms of the disease should be provided publicly, and psychological support is needed in those with persistent symptoms even after removal of isolation.
