Use of polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of the FBoV-1 DNA in several tissues, suggesting hematogenous viremia, with the viral nucleic acid, detected by in situ hybridization (ISH), was localized in intestinal cells and vascular endothelium of intestinal mucosa and serosa, and in necrosis areas primarily in various lymph nodes while FPLV-immunohistochemical analysis revealed viral localization only in cryptal cells, neurons, and limited to leukocytes in the mesenteric lymph node. Full-length coding genome analysis of the Thai FBoV-1 strains isolated from moribund cats revealed three distinct strains with a high between-strain genetic diversity, while genetic recombination in one of the three FBoV-1 strains within the NS1 gene. This is the first report identifying natural genetic recombination of the FBoV-1 and describing the pathology and viral tropism of FBoV-1 infection in cats. Although the role of FBoV-1 associated with systemic infection of these cats remained undetermined, a contributory role of enteric infection of FBoV-1 is possible. Synergistic effects of dual infection with FPLV and FBoV-1 are hypothesized, suggesting more likely severe clinical presentations.",

The BoV genome possesses three main open reading frames, ORF1-3, encoding the non-structural protein NS1, capsid protein VP1/2 and nuclear phosphoprotein NP1, respectively 1 . The BoVs have emerged and caused diseases in various animals and humans, including canine BoVs (CBoVs), porcine BoVs (PBoV), bovine parvovirus, gorilla BoV, California sea lion BoV, rodent BoV, feline BoVs (FBoVs) and human BoVs (HBoVs), and so suggests a potentially wide host range of BoVs 1-3 . Many researches have indicated the association of BoVs with various clinical symptoms. Respiratory and intestinal diseases have been observed frequently in BoV-infected hosts 4 , but other uncommon clinical presentations have also been reported. These include encephalomyelitis in a PBoV-infected pig, necrotizing encephalitis in HBoV-infected humans and hepatitis in CBoV-infected dogs 5-7 . Likewise, previous studies have reported the detection of the BoV genome in liver, lymph node, feces and blood of infected hosts, suggesting that BoVs could cause systemic infections 2 .",

Firstly, the novel FBoV-1 was detected in various samples, such as feces, blood, kidney and nasal swabs, collected from asymptomatic cats in Hong Kong 1 . Thereafter, FBoV-2 and \u22123 were discovered during high throughput metagenomic study of fecal viromes in healthy cats 8, 9 . However, neither the pathological roles of these FBoVs associated with intestinal disease nor other systemic diseases have been established. To date, the emergence of FBoVs has been reported in Belgium, China, Japan, Portugal and USA [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , where the FBoV genomes were detected in the feces of cats with and without clinical signs. Later, the FBoV-1 genome was detected in cats with severe enteritis 12 , but the relationship between FBoV-1 detection and clinical presentations with its pathogenesis in infected cats is still limited. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that the FBoV-1 genome was the most co-infected virus with other viral pathogens. For example, the FBoV-1 genome was detected in the brain of feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) infected cat showing neurological signs 10 . So far, the reports have addressed the potential role of FBoV-1 infections, yet the role of FBoV-1 when co-infected with FPLV is still unknown.",

Recombination allows viruses to quickly change their properties and results in novel genetic variants. For BoVs, genetic recombination has been focused on as a potential mechanism for virus evolution. For example, the evidence suggests that HBoV-3 emerged as a result of genetic recombination between HBoV-1 and HBoV-2 14 . Likewise, the HBoV-4 genome carried the admixture genome between HBoV-2 and HBoV-3 [15] [16] [17] . Furthermore, homologous genetic recombination among CBoV-2 strains was also evident 2 . These findings indicated that genetic recombination is likely to play an important role in the diversity of BoVs.",

However, clinical presentations of hemorrhagic syndrome with multi-systemic involvement are atypical findings for simple FPLV infections. Thus, an unknown concurrent infectious etiology, highly likely viral, may have played an important role in these outbreaks. This prompted us to expand the search for other unknown pathogens.

The FBoV-1 viral genomes have been previously detected in both cats with and without diarrhea 1,11,12 , but the pathological roles and viral localization are still debatable. In this study, the presence of FBoV-1 associated with these outbreaks was confirmed by the PCR from various fresh tissues of the moribund cats and fecal swabs from cats in the same households. Furthermore, the FBoV-1 localization and distribution were documented by ISH analysis, suggesting the extent of infection and viral tropism. Detection of FBoV-1 DNA using PCR showed the patterns of viral distribution. However, the demonstration of FBoV-1 in and other organs of moribund cats by PCR, in the absence of FBoV-1 ISH signal outside the intestinal tract and lymphoid tissues, was inconsistent, suggesting the possibility of viral spread via the blood stream. This finding was consistent with previous publications that documented the evidence of bocaviral viremia in the absence of viral localizations 2,18 . Since various BoVs were identified in intestinal tract of humans and other animals, with and without clinical diseases, investigations of FBoV-1 were recently conducted in intestinal tract samples of cats 1, 8, 9, [11] [12] [13] . However, the role of FBoV-1 enteric disease is not fully yet investigated. To better understanding the role of FBoV-1 associated with intestinal lesions, substantiation of virus localization in tissue and association of histological features are important. In the present of study, the FBoV-1 genomic signals were localized mainly in the nucleus of cryptal epithelium, intestinal stromal supporting cells and rarely detected in epithelium of villi. This finding indicated the first identification of FBoV-1 localization in the intestinal tissues and supported the previous evidences suggesting the FBoV-1 is more prevalent in fecal samples. This finding also indicated the common features of bocaparvoviral infection associated with intestinal diseases. Furthermore, the FBoV-1 signals were also detected in endothelium of small-sized blood vessels at intestinal submucosa and serosa, suggesting another possible evidence of FBoV-1 spread via the blood stream. Of note, the detection of FBoV-1 in many tissues would argue it is possible to be a persistent virus in cats, whether in blood or specifically in the tissues, as recent studies of persistent infection of BoVs [19] [20] [21] . Therefore, in this present study, a contributory role of FBoV-1 enteric disease is possible while a role of FBoV-1 viremia is needed further studies of FBoV-1 pathogenesis.",

However, the FPLV antigen was only detected at a low level in the mesenteric lymphoid tissue, while FBoV-1 antigens were detected at a large-scale, particularly in the necrotic areas of both the cortex and medulla of the lymph nodes. The presence of FBoV-1 antigens was not limited to mesenteric lymph nodes but was also systemically spread through the various lymphoid organs. The presence of FPLV and FBoV-1 antigens may also reflect the time point of infection, as the FPLV antigen might be cleared after necrosis of the lymphoid tissue. In addition, FBoV-1 may be associated with the lymphoid necrosis itself similar to reports of bocapavovirus infection in various host species 18, 22 . These results support that the pathological role of FBoV-1 can be associated with lymphoid necrosis, as reported previously, and may contribute to the acquired immunodeficient state of the host 18, 23, 24 . The role of immunocompromise situation, as FPLV infection in theses cats, may induce secondary viremia or vice versa. As such, hosts with FBoV infection are likely to be more susceptible to other infectious diseases. Subsequent systemic immunosuppression might allow the virulent bacteria to colonize in tissues and, therefore, contributed to lesions in other organs. In vivo study of the FBoV-1 infection may demonstrate the exact role of FBoV-1 in the focused diseases.",

            "text": "In this study, the possibility of a synergistic relationship between FPLV and FBoV-1 was hypothesized. A recent study showed that BoV can induce a DNA damage response (DDR) for cellular infection 20, [25] [26] [27] , and the fact that parvovirus has limited its genetic resource and requires the DDR process to facilitate its replication process 26, 28 . Thus, the association of BoV infection with enhanced parvovirus replication has been reported 29 , while vice versa, parvovirus can also induce the DDR process 26, 28 and help BoV infection 27 . Thus, we hypothesized the possible synergistic effect of FPLV and FBoV-1 infection in this study. Alternatively, many current studies have revealed that BoV causes not only acute infections but also probable persistent or subclinical infections by forming the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) structure and integrating into the host genome 21, 30, 31 . Furthermore, the BoVs have been associated with lymphoid necrosis 18, 23, 24 and may be a primary persistent infection resulting in immunosuppression, allowing secondary infection with FPLV, despite previous vaccination. In www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ this study, the role of FBoV-1 infections remains elusive, whether primary or secondary. Nevertheless, experimental study of such dual infections is needed to further clarify the true significance of the FBoV-1 infections.",

Although the role of FBoV-1 associated with systemic hemorrhage of these cats remained undetermined, a contributory role of FBoV-1 associated with enteric disease is possible. Since antigens/nucleic acid of the FPLV, but not those of other viruses, were detected in tissues of diseased cats, the clinical presentations are likely synergistic effects of dual infection with FPLV and FBoV-1, arguing the causative role of FBoV1 in the disease progression. Thus, we speculate the synergistic effects of dual infections with FBoV-1 and FPLV, ultimately resulting in a more severe and sudden clinical disease. The genetic recombination of FBoV-1 is firstly identified in this study, supporting the evolutionary mechanism of BoVs. Further in-depth studies of the pathology of the FBoV-1 infection are required to fully elucidate the significant clinical presentation of infected cats and to provide optimal guidance for diagnosis, surveillance and quarantine of FBoV-1 suspected cats. Further applied studies should be undertaken into FBoV-1 protein functions, to better understand how recombination events alter FBoV-1 pathogenesis and transmission. ",

The DNA probe covering 133 bp of the NS1 gene of FBoV-1 was prepared using a PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR reaction was performed under the same thermal cycling conditions described earlier using the described NS1 primers 1 except using the digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled oligonucleotides instead of the unlabeled oligonucleotides. Validation of the hybridization probe was performed by size resolution on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis and using control DNA for Northern blot immunolabelling (not shown). The ISH with chromogenic DNA was performed as previously reported 47 , with minor modification. Briefly, each 4-\u00b5m-thick FFPE slide was deparaffinized, rehydrated and subsequently rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

Fifty ul of hybridization buffer containing probes for FBoV-1 were applied on each slide while hybridization buffer containing DIG-labeled feline herpesvirus probe was placed on each negative control slide.

For blocking nonspecific binding, all slides were flooded with blocking solution mixture composed of 1 ml blocking solution and 9 ml of Maleic acid buffer (DIG Wash and Block Buffer Set, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), then were incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The slides were subsequently rinsed by 20 mM Tris-buffered saline (TBS) at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min. After nonspecific blocking, 100 ul of anti-DIG-AP Fab fragments (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) (1:200 in 1X Blocking solution) were placed on each slides, and the slides were incubated in the moist chamber for 60 min at room temperature, then washed three times with TBS for 5 min each, and placed in detection buffer (DIG Wash and Block Buffer Set, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for 5 min. Liquid permanent red (LPR) (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was applied in the dark room at room temperature for 30 min. Slides were then counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and coverslips applied. The brain, lung, liver, lymph node and intestine sections from cat no. 1 with an unrelated probe specific glycoprotein B of feline herpesvirus incubation were used as negative controls and the tissues of brain, lung and lymph node derived from a FBoV-1 negative cat served as additional negative controls.",

All FFPE tissues from the three necropsied cats were subjected to IHC analysis using the 1.B.450 mouse monoclonal anti-canine parvovirus antibody (Abcam AB59832, Cambridge, UK) as the primary antibody. Briefly, after deparaffinization and rehydration, tissue sections were pretreated by 0.1% (w/v) trypsin at 37 \u00b0C for 25 min, followed by blocking endogenous peroxidase activity with 5% (w/v) skim milk at 37 \u00b0C for 40 min. After washing three times with PBS, the sections were incubated with primary antibody (1:200 dilution) at 4 \u00b0C overnight followed by detection using the Dako REAL EnVision Detection System (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at RT for 45 min. After triplicate washings with PBS, a positive antigen-antibody reaction was observed by labeling with DAB and counterstained with Mayer's",
