However, little is known about JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in enterovirus 71 (EV71)-infected immature dendritic cells (iDCs). Thus, iDCs were induced from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and performed to explore the expressions and phosphorylation of molecules in the two signaling pathways as well as secretions of inflammatory cytokines and interferons during EV71 replication. Results: We showed that EV71 infection could activate both JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK in iDCs and phosphorylate their downstream transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun, which further promoted the production of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1. Moreover, EV71 infection also increased the release of IFN-\u03b2 and IL-12 p40. Pretreatment of iDCs with SP600125 and SB203580 (20 \u03bcM) could severely impair viral replication and its induced phosphorylation of JNK1/2, p38 MAPK, c-Fos and c-Jun. In addition, treatment of EV71-infected iDCs with SP600125 and SB203580 could inhibit secretions of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1.",

The results of RT-PCR showed that EV71 infection (MOI = 5) upregulated the expressions of c-Fos and c-Jun at mRNA level. To further investigate whether EV71 infection could activate and phosphorylate c-Fos and c-Jun, total and phosphorylated c-Fos and c-Jun were detected by Western blot. The results showed that c-Fos was rapidly phosphorylated by EV71 infection, reaching its peak at 24 h p.i.

And this effect was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with SP600125 and SB203580 ( Figure 3E and F).

            "text": "EV71 is a neurotropic picornavirus. Its infection could lead to neurological manifestations, ranging from aseptic meningitis to acute flaccid paralysis and brainstem encephalitis and is often associated with systemic features, such as severe pulmonary edema and shock, in young children [4] . The pathogenesis of its adverse clinical outcomes may be related to cell tropism, cell death and host immune responses, etc. [30] . DCs are essential for the induction of innate and specific immune responses against invading pathogens [31, 32] . Previous studies have shown that EV71 and dengue viruses could increase the viability, activation, cytokine release and T-cell priming activity of DCs [33, 34] . Particularly, iDCs are highly specialized and efficient in uptaking and processing antigens including various viruses. Whereas, JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways also play important roles in proinflammatory cytokine secretions and EV71 replication [27, 35] . However, whether EV71 infection could activate JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK in iDCs and the roles of their activation on EV71 replication have not been well explored. In this study, we investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways on EV71 infection in iDCs that are differentiated from PBMC. The mammalian JNKs are encoded by three distinct genes (jnk1, jnk2 and jnk3), and they are strongly activated in response to cytokines, UV irradiation, growth factor deprivation, DNA damaging agents, growth factors,and viral infection [36, 37] . JNK1 and JNK2 are expressed in most cell types, while JNK3 is found only in brain and testis [38] . The upstream activators for JNK pathway, i.e., MAP2Ks, are MEK4 and MEK7.The diversity of upstream activators of MEK4 and MEK7, infected with EV71 at a MOI of 5 at indicated times using antibodies against total and phosphorylated JNK1/2, p38 MAPK, as well as internal control GAPDH. The intensities of phosphorylated JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK were normalized to control level. The data were expressed as mean \u00b1 SE from three independent experiments and analyzed by one-way ANOVA (*p < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001).",

After activation in the cytoplasm, JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK translocate to the nucleus, where they phosphorylate Ser and Thr residues of specific AP-1 subunits to augment AP-1 transcriptional activity. Both JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK target to ATF2 (ATF subfamily), while JNK1/2 also targets to c-Jun and JunD [44] . Our results showed that EV71 infection enhanced mRNA level of c-Fos and c-Jun, and rapidly induced phosphorylation of c-Fos and c-Jun within 2 h. EV71-induced c-Jun phosphorylation was completely inhibited by inhibitor SP600125 and SB203580.",

EV71 infection can stimulate DCs to secrete various cytokines [33] . In the present study, EV71 infection of iDCs significantly increased the productions of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. Moreover, the enhanced secretions of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1, but not IL-12 and IFN, were remarkably inhibited by pretreatment with SP600125 and SB203580, indicating that the enhanced secretions of proinflammatory cytokines, but not IL-12 and IFN, by EV71 infection were mediated by JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways.

Moreover, inhibition of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways could effectively reduces viral replication and cytokine release, supporting the idea that the activation of these two pathways are important for EV71 infection. We speculate that JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK regulate viral replication by acting at certain specific steps of viral replication cycle, including attachment, entry, gene transcription, protein expressions, and assembly, as well as viral pathogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms need to be further studied in vitro or in vivo to highlight JNK1/2 or p38 MAPK as a potential broad antiviral molecular target for treatment of EV71 infection.",

To examine the role of JNK1/2 or p38 MAPK pathways in cytokine secretion in iDC, the culture supernatants of control iDCs, EV71-infected iDCs and iDCs pretreated with inhibitor SP600125 or SB203580 (20 \u03bcM) prior to EV71 infection were collected at 24 h p.i. and used to detect the levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, IL-12 p70, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 using luminex fluorescent technique. The results showed that EV71 infection (MOI = 5) significantly increased secretions of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, TNF\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 in iDCs, and pretreatment with SP600125",
