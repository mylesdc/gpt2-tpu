            "text": "Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) was the first virus of wide scale concern to be linked to possible transmission by livestock feed or ingredients. Measures to exclude pathogens, prevent cross-contamination, and actively reduce the pathogenic load of feed and ingredients are being developed. However, research thus far has focused on the role of chemicals or thermal treatment to reduce the RNA in the actual feedstuffs, and has not addressed potential residual contamination within the manufacturing facility that may lead to continuous contamination of finished feeds. The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the use of a standardized protocol to sanitize an animal feed manufacturing facility contaminated with PEDV. Environmental swabs were collected throughout the facility during the manufacturing of a swine diet inoculated with PEDV. To monitor facility contamination of the virus, swabs were collected at: 1) baseline prior to inoculation, 2) after production of the inoculated feed, 3) after application of a quaternary ammonium-glutaraldehyde blend cleaner, 4) after application of a sodium hypochlorite sanitizing solution, and 5) after facility heat-up to 60\u02daC for 48 hours. Decontamination step, surface, type, zone and their interactions were all found to impact the quantity of detectable PEDV RNA (P < 0.05). As expected, all samples collected from equipment surfaces contained PEDV RNA after production of the contaminated feed. Additionally, the majority of samples collected from non-direct feed contact surfaces were also positive for PEDV RNA after the production of the contaminated feed, emphasizing the potential role dust plays in cross-contamination of pathogen throughout a manufacturing facility. Application of the cleaner, sanitizer, and heat were effective at reducing PEDV genomic material (P < 0.05), but did not completely eliminate it.",

            "text": "The United States swine industry has suffered dramatic losses following the emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in May 2013. The virus is a highly contagious and deadly coronavirus that was only observed in Asian and European swine herds prior to 2013. Due to the high mortality rates (80-100%) in neonates, significant economic losses have been experienced [1, 2] . Traditionally, transmission of PEDV occurs through the fecal-oral route within a herd with acutely infected pigs shedding large quantities of the virus for several days after infection. Due to the large amount of virus that can be shed by infected herds, there is potential for the virus to contaminate facility surroundings, leading to contamination issues off-property. Other modes of transmission, in addition to infected pigs, include fecal contamination of animal transport vehicles, PEDV-positive aerosols, and contaminated animal feed or ingredients [1, 3, 4, 5, 6] . Observations also indicate presence of PEDV genetic material in feed transport vehicles suggesting these vehicles may be a potential vector [7] .",

The FSRC includes a containment mode, where a separate air handling system with HEPA filtration and biosafety protocols restrict pathogen exit during operation of equipment. Employees are required to wear personal protective equipment and follow strict biosafety guidelines while operating in containment mode. As a final decontamination step, the entire temperature of the facility can be raised to and maintained at 60\u02daC. Due to the dual functionality of the FSRC as a pilot-scale feed mill operated not under containment, effective decontamination is essential to prevent the contamination of research feeds. Thawing of the virus, preparation of the inoculum and subsequent inoculation of the larger feed batch was all done within the FSRC in containment mode. The FSRC was not removed from containment mode until completion of decontamination after the final replication.",

However, monitoring and elimination of PEDV within animal feed manufacturing facilities has received little attention from researchers. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the presence of PEDV within an animal feed manufacturing facility during the manufacture of a swine diet artificially inoculated with PEDV and the subsequent decontamination of the facility. Prior to the beginning of each replicate, subsamples of the feed to be used were evaluated for PEDV RNA. As expected all feed was negative, with no detectable PEDV RNA found via RT-qPCR analysis. In addition, all baseline swabs collected during each replication were negative for PEDV. After the introduction of PEDV-inoculum to the feed in each replicate run, three subsamples of inoculated feed were collected and evaluated for PEDV RNA by RT-qPCR. The PEDV cell culture had Ct values of 16.7, 15.9, and 16.2 for replicates 1, 2, and 3, respectively. While the PEDV-inoculated feed contained average Ct values of 32.6, 31.4, and 32.2 for replicates 1, 2, and 3, respectively. This is consistent with previously observed PEDV contaminated feed [13] .

Plastic and rubber surfaces were not significantly different from each other, but were both significantly different from concrete and metal surfaces. Additionally, concrete and metal surfaces were not significantly different from each other. The differences between the plastic and rubber vs concrete and metal surfaces could be attributed the specific characteristics of each surface type. Specifically, the plastic and rubber surfaces were smoother compared to the concrete and metal surfaces.

Significantly less contamination was seen in zone 3 (vs zones 1 and 2; P < 0.05), as expected due to the proximity to the contaminated feed. However, as seen with the facility swabs, dust generated during processing of contaminated feed can lead to contamination of previously uncontaminated surfaces.

The 5 evaluated decontamination steps were: 1) baseline prior to inoculation, 2) after feed production, 3) chemical cleaning with a quaternary ammonium-glutaraldehyde blend, 4) chemical cleaning with sodium hypochlorite, and 5) facility heat-up to 60\u02daC 48 hours.

These are consistent with protocols to document disinfection of pig transport vehicles [14] . Although effective, the wet chemical cleaning and facility heating are impractical on a large-scale basis for feed manufacturing facilities. These findings may provide solutions for biological hazard reduction on specific equipment or problem areas. It is also important to note the importance of equipment cleaning, as positive swabs were found after the final decontamination step (during replication 2, as stated previously). ",

The virus was spread to nearly all feed-and non-feed-contact surfaces and was particularly challenging to decontaminate, even with the aid of wet sanitizers and heat. Therefore, feed mill operators must be particularly judicious regarding use of good manufacturing practices and biosecurity protocols to exclude the virus from entry into the feed mill. Furthermore, additional research is necessary to understand the role of dust in animal food biological hazard transmission and to formulate practical feed mill sanitation recommendations to prevent and reduce PEDV contamination of equipment and facilities.",
