Among them, accessory protein 3b (also known as ORF4) was lately identified as one of the viral interferon antagonist. Recently our lab uncovered a new role for 3b in upregulation of AP-1 transcriptional activity and its downstream genes. Thus, we believe that 3b might play an important role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis and therefore is of considerable interest. The current study aims at identifying novel host cellular interactors of the 3b protein.",

Kinase assay and pharmacological inhibitor treatment implied that 3b also affect RUNX1b transcriptional activity by regulating its ERK dependent phosphorylation levels. Additionally, mRNA levels of MIP-1a, a RUNX1b target gene upregulated in SARS-CoV infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells, were found to be elevated in 3b expressing U937 monocyte cells.",

SARS-CoV, like other coronaviruses, is a positive sense, singlestranded enveloped RNA virus with a huge 29.7 Kb genome [3] . Its genome comprises of 14 ORFs which encode non-structural genes, structural genes and several unique group specific accessory proteins namely 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b. [4] . Recognition of peptides derived from accessory proteins by convalescent sera of SARS-CoV infected patients [5] as well as their immunohistochemical detection in infected VeroE6 cells and in clinical specimens [6] corroborates their expression during viral infection. However, these accessory proteins have been found dispensable for viral replication [7] .",

A recent report delineated a unique nucleo-mitochondrial shuttling behaviour of 3b-GFP wherein 3b was found to inhibit RIG-I and MAVS induced type I interferon induction in the mitochondria [9] . Recently, we published a role of 3b in induction of AP-1 transcriptional activity that was mediated by the activation of ERK and JNK pathways [12] .

            "text": "To uncover host interacting partners, of SARS-CoV 3b, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen of human lung cDNA library using 3b as bait. The screen identified RUNX1b (Runt related transcription factor 1, isoform b) as one of the host interacting partners of 3b. RUNX1 belongs to the RUNX family of genes which includes RUNX2 and RUNX3 additionally [13] . RUNX genes encode the a subunit, which heterodimerizes with the b subunit, CBFb to form transcription factor CBF (Core Binding Factor) [14] . RUNX1 has a 128 aa runt domain through which it binds CBFb as well as the consensus DNA element, TGT/cGGT [14, 15] . RUNX1 has three isoforms: RUNX1a, RUNX1b and RUNX1c. RUNX1a is a 250 aa protein with a runt domain. RUNX1b is a 453 aa protein and possess additional PST (proline, serine and threonine rich) region downstream to runt domain. RUNX1c differs from RUNX1b by 32 aa at N-terminus and is presumed to have similar functions in cells as RUNX1b [16] . RUNX1 is crucially required for definitive hematopoiesis and Tlymphocyte differentiation [17, 18] . At the molecular level, RUNX1 isoforms have been shown to regulate transcription of a number of genes including cytokines (IL2, IL3, GM-CSF etc.) and chemokines (MIP-1a, CSFR etc.). Based on the yeast two-hybrid screening results, we conducted our current study with the RUNX1b isoform. In this study, we confirmed the putative interaction of 3b and RUNX1b and observed in vivo recruitment of 3b on the RUNX1 binding element on the IL2 promoter in transiently transfected human T, jurkat cells. Further, 3b was found to increase the transactivation potential of RUNX1b on the IL2 promoter, which may partly be attributed to the enhanced ERK dependent phosphorylation of RUNX1b in 3b expressing cells. We next determined the positive effect of 3b-RUNX1b interaction on the expression of RUNX1b regulated chemokine MIP-1a, reported to be upregulated in SARS-CoV infected monocyte derived dendritic cells. Thus, we report a novel interaction of SARS-CoV 3b with RUNX1b and discussed its plausible significance in SARS virus pathogenesis.",

The interaction was further confirmed in Huh7 cells. Cells expressing flag tagged RUNX1b (pCMV-Tag2B Flag RUNX1b or Flag-RUNX1b) and myc tagged 3b (pCDNA 3.1 Myc/His-3b or Myc-3b), alone or together, were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation assay. Immunoprecipitation by anti-Flag detected 3b from cells co-expressing RUNX1b and 3b (Lane 3, Fig. 1D ) whereas no corresponding band for 3b was seen from cells expressing RUNX1b or 3b alone (Lane 1 and 2, Fig. 1D ).

To investigate whether 3b-RUNX1b interaction leads to the recruitment of 3b on RUNX1 binding elements on the endogenous IL2 promoter, ChIP assays were performed in RUNX1b/CBFb endogenously expressing jurkat cells that are abortively infected by SARS-CoV. Jurkat cells transfected with empty vector or HA-3b were subjected to the assay after 48 h of transfection. ChIP results from 3b transfected cells using anti-HA depicted co-immunoprecipitation of the IL2 promoter region containing RUNX1 binding site but not from mock transfected cells (Fig. 3) . However, the 39-distal IL2 promoter region, which does not contain RUNX1 binding site, was not immunoprecipitated by anti-HA in either of the samples, suggesting that 3b recruitment on the IL2 promoter region is specific to the RUNX1 binding. Control ChIP assays using anti-RUNX1 (positive control) and no antibody (negative control) were conducted simultaneously. These results clearly demonstrate an in vivo recruitment of 3b on the RUNX1 binding element on the IL2 promoter.",

To investigate the effect of SARS-CoV 3b protein on the RUNX1b transcriptional activity, reporter gene assays were performed using the mouse IL2 promoter. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with wild-type (WT) IL2 promoter luciferase plasmid, Flag-RUNX1b, Flag-CBFb and Myc-3b in combinations mentioned. Renilla luciferase plasmid (pRL-TK) was co-transfected as an internal control. 3b alone showed no significant increase in the luciferase activity whereas 3b along with RUNX1b and CBFb showed increase in the luciferase activity in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 4A ). Transfection in jurkat cells also showed 1.5-5.0 fold increase in the luciferase activity with increasing doses of Myc-3b (Fig. 4B) , suggesting that the increase in the luciferase activity in HEK293 and jurkat cells was specific to the 3b expression. To confirm whether 3b induced increase in the IL2 promoter activity was due to RUNX1b binding on the promoter, the IL2 promoter with all three RUNX1 binding sites mutated (mutant IL2-Luc) was used. Myc-3b transfected jurkat cells showed merely 0.3 fold increase in the luciferase activity with mutant IL2-Luc as against 2.0 fold with WT IL2-Luc (Fig. 4C) ; confirming that 3b dependent increase in Figure 2 . 3b partially co-localizes with RUNX1b in the nucleus.

Therefore, determination of ERK dependent phosphorylation levels of RUNX1b in 3b expressing cells was of our interest. To investigate this, an in vitro kinase assay with 3b and vector transfected HEK293 cells was performed. RUNX1b immunocomplex from transfected cells served as a substrate for the kinase assay. Results depicted a 1.5 fold increase in phosphorylated RUNX1b levels in 3b transfected cells compared to control transfected cells (Fig. 5A ). This suggests that 3b activated ERK may partly be responsible for the stimulated RUNX1b transcriptional activity in 3b transfected jurkat cells. To test this hypothesis, the reporter gene assay was performed in the presence of ERK inhibitor, U0126. 3b transfected jurkat cells were treated with DMSO or U0126 for 24 hrs prior to measurement of luciferase activity. Treatment of cells with U0126 led to the inhibition of luciferase activity which was otherwise observed in 3b expressing DMSO treated cells (Fig. 5B) . This experiment points out that 3b mediated increase in RUNX1b transactivation potential may also be contributed by stimulated ERK activity.",

Among them, 3b, like SARS6, belongs to a group of accessory proteins that are unique to SARS coronavirus. A recent study brought out plausible contribution of 3b in SARS pathogenesis, by affecting levels of chemokines that are found upregulated in SARS. We believed that the accessory protein 3b has more roles to play in virus pathogenesis which are still unknown. To unveil new cellular interactors of 3b, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen of human lung cDNA library and identified transcription factor RUNX1b as a putative interactor of 3b.

B-cell proliferation and immortalization by Epstein-Barr virus is mediated by downregulation of RUNX1, a consequence of the binding of RUNX3 on the RUNX1 promoter [50] . RUNX1 has been found to be upregulated in latently infected GM-Ps by human cytomegalovirus (CMV), a species specific herpesvirus [51] . In adenovirus infected cells, RUNX1 leads to significant mislocalization of E4Orf6, thus interfering with viral replication [52] . A comparative study by microarray analysis of host gene transcription in the Huh7 cell line infected with SARS-CoV and human coronavirus 229E found significantly increased RUNX1 expression with SARS-CoV infection as compared to human CoV22E [53] . This observation prompted us to study this novel interaction of SARS-CoV accessory protein 3b with RUNX1.",

Next, 3b was found to get recruited on the RUNX1 binding elements which led to increased transactivation of RUNX1b on the IL2 promoter, as depicted by reporter gene assays. Additionally, 3b also affected its transactivation on the IL2 promoter by modulating phosphoryla- tion levels of RUNX1b through ERK. A similar mode of regulation of immediate early gene X-1 through ERK-induced RUNX1 phosphorylation in response to thrombopoetin was reported by Hamelin and colleagues [54] . In order to explore the effect of 3b on RUNX1b target gene other than IL2, we measured mRNA levels of a MIP-1a, the promoter of which is reported to be regulated by RUNX1b [23] . MIP-1a has been observed to get upregulated in monocyte derived dendritic cells infected with SARS-CoV [24] . In our study, overexpression of 3b in monocytic cells U937 resulted in 5 fold increase in MIP-1 mRNA levels which rose to 13 folds, when overexpressed with RUNX1b. Interestingly, a recent report by Chen et al. Figure 5 . 3b expression increases phosphorylated RUNX1b levels through ERK activation. A. HEK293 cells were transfected with vector, 3b and RUNX1b expression plasmids. ERK immunoprecipitated from vector and 3b lysates were subjected to kinase assay with RUNX1b beads. Phosphorylated RUNX1b was visualized by autoradiography. Input levels of immunoprecipitated ERK and phospho ERK levels in lysates were probed by western blotting.

Jurkat and monocyte cells are abortively infected by SARS-CoV. Upon entry in these cells, RNA genome of the SARS-CoV will get transcribed and translated and expectedly, would lead to the synthesis of 3b along with other proteins. However, until now there is no direct report on the expression levels of 3b in these virus infected cells. Therefore, based on our study we have speculated the role of 3b in virus infected monocytic and T cells and put forth a plausible role of 3b in SARS-CoV pathogenesis which gives new directions to the understanding of SARS.",
