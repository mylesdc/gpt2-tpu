Entry processes are commonly analyzed by monitoring internalized virus particles via Western blotting, polymerase chain reaction, and imaging techniques that allow scientist to track the intracellular location of the pathogen. Such studies have provided abundant direct evidence on how viruses interact with receptor molecules on the cell surface, induce cell signaling at the point of initial contact with the cell to facilitate internalization, and exploit existing endocytic mechanisms of the cell for their ultimate infectious agenda. However, there is dearth of knowledge in regards to trafficking of a virus via endosomes. Herein, we describe an optimized laboratory procedure to isolate individual organelles during different stages of endocytosis by performing subcellular fractionation. This methodology is established using Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection of human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells as a model. With KSHV and other herpesviruses alike, envelope glycoproteins have been widely reported to physically engage target cell surface receptors, such as integrins, in interactions leading to entry and subsequent infection.",

Intracellular KSHV trafficking was directly traced in the isolated endosomal fractions. Additionally, the subcellular fractionation approach demonstrates a key role for integrins in the endosomal trafficking of KSHV.

KSHV binding to HS is thought to bring the virus in closer proximity to target cells such that perhaps more meaningful interactions with other receptor molecules, such as integrins [6] , can occur to promote the actual entry process [5] . In fact, KSHV sets precedence as the first herpesvirus shown to interact with adherent target cell integrins in a step initiating the entry process [7] . Integrins are heterodimeric cell adhesion receptors composed of non-covalently associated \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits [8] . To facilitate virus entry and infection, KSHV envelope associated glycoprotein B (gB) is shown to interact with integrins via its two distinct integrin recognition motifs: (1) RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp), the major integrin binding motif and minimal peptide region known to interact with subsets of integrins [7, 9] ; and (2) disintegrin-like domain (DLD), the lesser studied and highly conserved integrin recognition motif that binds integrins RGD-independently [10] [11] [12] . A multitude of studies have implicated KSHV gB interactions with RGD-binding integrins, \u03b13\u03b21, \u03b1V\u03b23, and \u03b1V\u03b25, as valuable for infectious virus entry [7, [13] [14] [15] . However, both RGD and non-RGD-binding integrins are believed to aid equally in virus entry [16] . For instance, recent studies by us [10] identified KSHV gB interactions with cell surface expressed integrin \u03b19\u03b21, a DLD-binding integrin, crucial to promoting viral infection of cells [10] . Aside from integrins, other receptors shown to have a role in KSHV entry are ephrin receptor tyrosine kinase A2 (EphA2) [17] , dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) [18] , and human cystine/glutamate exchange transporter system x-c (xCT) [1] . After binding to receptors (i.e. proteins, carbohydrates, or lipids), the vast majority of viruses utilize endocytic routes to enter target cells [19] .",

Upon fraction comparison, acid phosphatase activity in both the uninfected and KSHV infected HFF cells was detected in fractions 1-3 with fraction 1 displaying the highest phosphatase activity. Activity of acid phosphatase foreseeably coincided with the LE fractions (fractions 1-3; Fig. 2A ); although acid hydrolases (e.g. acid phosphatase) majorly localize in lysosomes, these enzymes can be found in LEs as well [27] . Therefore, such findings provide even further evidence for the presence of LEs in the said fractions.",

Earlier studies described KSHV entry as a rapid process wherein the capsid delivers the genetic material to the nucleus allowing eventual expression of viral transcripts in as early as 30 min post infection (PI) [30, 31] . Here, we monitored KSHV particles in endosomes 30 min PI. In the case of cells infected with KSHV, there was notably more KSHV DNA detected in EE containing fractions compared to the fractions containing LEs (Fig. 2C) . Similar results were observed in cells infected with a mixture of KSHV and BSA (Fig. 2C ). Though incubating soluble integrin \u03b19\u03b21 with KSHV did not significantly alter the levels of KSHV in EEs, it significantly impeded the ability of KSHV to escape the LEs (Fig. 2C) . These results suggest a possible role for \u03b19\u03b21 integrin in virus-mediated endosomal escape. Additionally, infection in the presence of our positive control, heparin, results in a significant drop in the number of virus particles observed in both EE and LE containing fractions (Fig. 2C) . Notably, pre-treatment of KSHV with soluble heparin is shown to impede the initial attachment of the virus to HS on the cell surface [32] , thus blocking binding, signal induction, entry, and efficient infection of target cells [5, 33] . Based on these results, as it pertains to HFF cells, we presume KSHV to be a late penetrating virus that exits from the LE into the cytosol. We could not detect HSV-2 in either the early or late endosome (data not shown), as earlier studies demonstrated HSV-2 to enter target cells via fusion at the cell membrane [20] .",

Expression of TRI-1 is ideal for detection of the virus, as the virus envelope is lost upon fusion/ penetration. At 1 min post KSHV infection, significantly more virus was observed in EE containing fractions 4-6 versus LE fractions with most virus being detected in fraction 5 (Fig. 3) . Similar patterns were observed at 1 min PI when the virus was incubated with BSA or soluble \u03b19\u03b21 (Fig. 3 ). Incubating KSHV with heparin lowered the percentage of virus being internalized as detected by limited staining for TRI-1 in EEs (Fig. 3) . By 5 min PI, a significant portion of the virus had reached LEs in KSHV infected cells or cells infected with a mixture of KSHV that was incubated with BSA or \u03b19\u03b21 (Fig. 3) . Heparin blocked KSHV internalization effectively as described at 1 min PI. By 30 min PI, there was a marked drop in the levels of virus in LEs (especially LE fraction 1) in cells that were infected with KSHV or a mixture of KSHV and BSA (Fig. 3) . Surprisingly, we found an increase in the levels of virus associated with LEs of cells that were infected with a mixture of KSHV and soluble \u03b19\u03b21. Overall, Western blotting results monitoring TRI-1 expression as an indicator of KSHV in collected gradient fractions of virus infected HFF cells (Fig. 3 ) mimic qPCR results (Fig. 2C) , thus confirming escape of KSHV from the LE to the cytoplasm in HFF cells.",

By as early as 1 min PI of cells, KSHV was associated with EEs as observed by co-localization of the FITC-KSHV with Rab5 expression (Fig. 4a) . Treating cells with antibodies to \u03b19\u03b21 or pre-immune IgGs did not significantly alter this co-localization (Fig. 4a) . At 30 min PI, a fraction of KSHV was associated with LEs as observed by co-localization of the FITC-KSHV with Rab7 expression (Fig. 4b) . A similar result was observed when the cells were treated with pre-immune IgGs (Fig. 4b) . However, the number of co-localizing events substantially increased when the cells were treated with antibodies to \u03b19\u03b21 prior to infection (Fig. 4b) . For further authentication, subsequent intracellular trafficking of KSHV upon cytosolic delivery (post-late endosomal penetration) was similarly analyzed via immunofluorescence microscopy using KSHV and antibodies directed against minor capsid protein TRI-1 (Fig. 5) . By 30 min PI, KSHV was shown to accumulate at the perinuclear region as observed by TRI-1 positive viral capsids (similar results were observed in cells treated with pre-immune IgGs) (Fig. 5A, B) . However, when cells were treated with antibodies against integrin subunits (\u03b19 or \u03b21), a substantial reduction in perinuclear TRI-1 expression corresponding to KSHV nucleocapsids was observed (Fig. 5A, B) . This reduction in the number of capsids positive for TRI-1 was not observed when the cells were treated with antibodies to integrin subunit \u03b15 (Fig. 5A, B) . Anti-integrin \u03b15 antibodies which have no effect on KSHV entry and infection [10, 14] served as a negative control (Fig. 5A,  B) . Thus, these results clearly denote the ability of antibodies against integrin subunits (\u03b19 or \u03b21) to block virus infection by preventing the escape of KSHV from LEs. Overall, we conclude virus:\u03b19\u03b21 interactions to play a key role in trafficking of KSHV via endosomes to eventually escape into the cytoplasm.",

Herpesvirus entry occurs via viral glycoprotein engagement of target cell receptor molecules. Those receptors considered valuable for KSHV entry into HFF cells are binding receptor, HS, RGD-binding integrins (\u03b13\u03b21, \u03b1V\u03b23, \u03b1V\u03b25; [5, 7, 14, 35] ), and DLD-binding \u03b19\u03b21 integrin [10] . In particular, integrins are known to alter different stages of the virus entry process. Much work has been done to establish a role for RGD-binding integrins in regulating KSHV infectious entry. Specifically, RGD of KSHV gB functionally interacts with integrins \u03b13\u03b21, \u03b1V\u03b23, and \u03b1V\u03b25 that have a role in the initial internalization of the virus [5, 7, 14, 35] . However, very little is known about the role of DLD-binding integrins during the initial stages of KSHV infection. Employing subcellular fractionation to assess endosomal trafficking of KSHV, the present study, for the first time, deciphers a role for DLD-binding \u03b19\u03b21 integrin in regulating KSHV entry.",

These findings have taken our current knowledge of KSHV entry a step further, delineating yet another dynamic role for integrins in a post-internalization stage of KSHV infection of HFF cells. Notably, a previous study by A B Fig. 4 Antibodies to integrin \u03b19\u03b21 inhibit KSHV escape from the late endosome. A KSHV is present in Rab5-positive EEs and Rab7-postive LEs. HFF cells were either uninfected or pre-treated (1 h at 37 \u00b0C) with antibodies (20 \u00b5g/ml) to \u03b19\u03b21 or pre-immune IgG prior to infection with FITC-KSHV for 1 min (A) and 30 min (B) at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were washed, fixed, and subsequently immunostained with TRITC labeled anti-Rab5 antibodies (A) and TRITC labeled anti-Rab7 antibodies (B ) prior to mounting using an anti-fade reagent containing DAPI and examining under a fluorescent microscope. Representative images are provided at \u00d71000 magnification. The white circles indicate co-localization of FITC-KSHV with the respective endosome marker within the cell (panels A and B) Schornberg et al. also provides evidence that viruses utilize integrins for regulation of virus entry at steps beyond binding and initial internalization to promote virus penetration from endocytic organelles. Specifically, they suggest that cell surface integrin expression mediates virus entry at this post-internalization step via controlling endosomal cathepsins (proteases found in endosomes that mediate intracellular proteolysis; [38, 39] ). With further studies, we seek to resolve: (1) the role for \u03b19\u03b21 in mediating proteolytic activity within endosomes; and (2) the link between post-internalization virus:integrin interactions and endosomal acidification in supporting a successful virus infection of cells.",

In order to map the endosomal location of KSHV, HFF cells (75 % confluent) cultured in 8 well chamber slides were either uninfected or infected with FITC-KSHV for 1 or 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Post-infection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 3.7 % formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After fixing, cells were washed, permeabilized using 0.1 % Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min, washed again, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with PBS containing 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) to block non-specific binding sites. Cells were then incubated successfully (1 h at 37 \u00b0C) with the appropriate primary (anti-Rab5, or anti-Rab7) and secondary (goat anti-rabbit TRITC) antibodies. Immunostained cells were washed in PBS and imaged with a Nikon fluorescent microscope using appropriate filters. To study the escape of KSHV from the LEs, we infected cells with KSHV for 30 min, fixed the cells as described above, and sequentially stained with anti-KSHV TRI-1 antibodies and goat anti-mouse TRITC antibodies prior to examining under a fluorescent microscope.",

B Statistical analysis on the viral capsids that accumulated around the perinuclear region was determined based on randomly counting the number of TRI-1 positive KSHV capsids around 10 different nuclei. The TRI-1 positive viral capsids around the perinuclear region for different treatments is presented as percentage (%) as compared to cells infected with KSHV alone (n = 60).
