Studies are rare on how local health departments and other health professionals are able to understand case definitions and to what extent case definitions are unambiguous enough to really assure reliability. To our knowledge, the only publication investigating this issue was focused on case definitions for nosocomial infections: Gastmeier and colleagues had investigated how uniform the case definitions of the nosocomial infections surveillance system in Germany had been applied by different investigators using a set of 60 case studies [10] . Due to the general importance of case definition for public health surveillance and the current need for harmonization in international surveillance systems we conducted a systematic evaluation of the national case definitions with the objective to identify general as well as specific criteria and recommendations for improvement of case definitions.",

The dominant effect of the disease-variable, however, made this association disappear in the multivariate model. The most convincing explanation for this effect is, that after initial experience with the national case definitions, RKI had already changed the way of defining the clinical picture when creating case definitions for the diseases only notifiable in Eastern German states: The clinical picture was now defined in a clear check-list of signs and symptoms, instead of an unspecific mentioning of various possible signs and symptoms, such as in the first edition of the IfSG case definitions. Based on the findings of this study we have in the meanwhile applied this principle of a clear check-list in the second edition of the IfSG case definitions.The results of the study were integrated in a case example book, which contains each of the 68 case examples followed by the required gold standard classification, descriptive statistics of the responses and a commentary interpreting these results and explaining the required gold standard. This case example book was mailed to all participants after termination of the study and is also available on the RKI website[22].",
