Children infected with MTB are more likely to progress to active TB (ATB); however, the molecular mechanism behind this process has long been a mystery. We employed the label-free quantitative proteomic technology to identify and characterize differences in plasma proteins between ATB and latent TB infection (LTBI) in children. To detect differences that are indicative of MTB infection, we first selected proteins whose expressions were markedly different between the ATB and LTBI groups and the control groups (inflammatory disease control (IDC) and healthy control (HC) groups). A total of 521 proteins differed (> 1.5-fold or < 0.6-fold) in the LTBI group, and 318 proteins in the ATB group when compared with the control groups. Of these, 49 overlapping proteins were differentially expressed between LTBI and ATB. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed most proteins had a cellular and organelle distribution. The MTB infection status was mainly related to differences in binding, cellular and metabolic processes. XRCC4, PCF11, SEMA4A and ATP11A were selected and further verified by qPCR and western blot. At the mRNA level, the expression of XRCC4, PCF11and SEMA4A presented an increased trend in ATB group compare with LTBI. At the protein level, the expression of all these proteins by western blot in ATB/LTBI was consistent with the trends from proteomic detection. Our results provide important data for future mechanism studies and biomarker selection for MTB infection in children.",

For instance, Shuxian Li et al. revealed that the proteins secreted by A549 cells were associated with the infection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae [6] . Dandan Xu and her colleagues found that the level of serum proteins (S100A9, SOD3, and MMP9) in ATB reflected the immune response to the MTB infection [5] .

According to the analysis of CC, the majority of the proteins had a cell and organelle distribution. According to the analysis of BP, the primary functions were cellular processes, metabolic processes and biological regulation; while others were related to cellular component organization, pigmentation, multicellular organismal processes and so on. According to the analysis of MF, these proteins could be classified into eight categories as follows: molecular transducer activity, translation regulator activity, enzyme regulator activity, transcription regulator activity, structural molecule activity, catalytic activity, binding, transporter activity. Among them, a large proportion had binding as a molecular function. To identify the most important proteins involved in the conversion from LTBI to ATB, proteins that were obviously up or down-regulated should be categorized into many different functional groups.",

Firstly, the four selected proteins all were also participate in the binding processes, including nucleic acid binding and protein binding. Additionally, XCRR4 and PCF11 had an effect on metabolic process while SEMA4A and ATP11A were related to the cellular process. Thus, these four proteins, being representative of the 49 different proteins, reflected the different status of MTB infection. At the mRNA level, the expression of XRCC4, PCF11and SEMA4A presented an increased trend in ATB group compare with that in LTBI and this agreed with the proteomic results. The ratio of ATP11A was apparently inconsistent with the proteomic data ( Figure 5A ). The mRNA result implies that regulation is occurring at the point of protein translation, not gene transcription. At the protein level, our results demonstrated that the plasma levels of XRCC4, PCF11, SEMA4A and ATP11A in the ATB group were significantly higher than the LTBI group (all P < 0.05; Figure 5B ). Representative western blots are shown in Figure 5C . These ratios were consistent with the trends of proteomics results.

Among these proteins, 49 were differentially expressed between LTBI and ATB. These proteins were further performed by volcano plot. The traditional volcano plot is a combination of fold change and t-tests. Note, for unpaired samples, the x-axis is log (FC). Y-axis is -log10 (P-value) for both cases, and can be based on raw or FDR adjusted P values. However, our data alignment strategy is: disease control and normal control, respectively, compared with ATB and LTBI, followed look at the difference between the significant difference between the part of ATB and LTBI.
