The recent emergence of strains resistant to all current drugs urges the development of compounds with new mechanisms of action. G-quadruplexes are nucleic acids secondary structures that may form in G-rich regions to epigenetically regulate cellular functions. Here we implemented a computational tool to scan the presence of putative G-quadruplex forming sequences in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and analyse their association to transcription start sites. We found that the most stable G-quadruplexes were in the promoter region of genes belonging to definite functional categories. Actual G-quadruplex folding of four selected sequences was assessed by biophysical and biomolecular techniques: all molecules formed stable G-quadruplexes, which were further stabilized by two G-quadruplex ligands. These compounds inhibited Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the low micromolar range. These data support formation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis G-quadruplexes in vivo and their potential regulation of gene transcription, and prompt the use of G4 ligands to develop original antitubercular agents.",

            "text": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), a disease existing for millennia and still remaining a major global health problem. Primary infection occurs by inhaling aerosol particles containing bacteria. Mtb is able to replicate inside alveolar macrophages and inflammatory cells recruited at the infection site determine formation of a histological pulmonary lesion named granuloma. In most cases Mtb is never cleared and survives inside granulomas in a non-replicative and non-infectious state known as latency 1 . Around one third of the world's population is affected by latent TB. Latently infected individuals have 5-15% probability to develop the active disease during their lifetime. According to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) report, 10.4 million new TB cases were estimated worldwide, with 480,000 new cases of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and 1.4 million deaths. In addition, the emergence of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) and totally drug-resistant TB (TDR-TB) is becoming one of the biggest threats to public health and TB control programs 2 . Therefore, new insights into Mtb physiology are required to better characterize the pathogenesis mechanisms that Mtb exploits to survive and persist in its host, in order to individuate strategies to eradicate this ancient pathogen.",

Four Gs bind via Hoogsteen-type hydrogen bonds base-pairing to yield G-quartets, which stack to form the G4. The presence of K + cations specifically supports G4 formation and stability 4 . Based on the strand orientation, G4s can adopt three main topologies: parallel, antiparallel, and hybrid-type structures. Stability studies about the formation of G4s have demonstrated that these non-canonical DNA secondary structures are able to destabilize the double helix, since many G4 structures are thermodynamically more stable than double stranded DNA and their unfolding kinetics are significantly slower 5, 6 . In eukaryotes G4s have been reported to be involved in key regulatory roles, including transcriptional regulation of gene promoters and enhancers, translation, chromatin epigenetic regulation, DNA recombination 6-10 . Expansion of G4-forming motifs has been associated with relevant human neurological disorders 8, 11 . Formation of G4s in vivo has been consolidated by the discovery of cellular proteins that specifically recognize G4s 12, 13 and the Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 Scientific RepoRts | 7: 5743 |",

Bacterial G4s have been implicated in antigenic variation of the cell-surface pilin proteins of Neisseria gonorrhoeae [43] [44] [45] [46] . In Mtb, whose genome is 65% GC rich, previous bioinformatics analysis identified more than 10,000 motifs with the potential to fold into G4 structures 32 . Additionally, evidence for the presence of a specific helicase that targets G4s (DinG) and for a G4 aptamer that inhibits a polyphosphate kinase involved in the inorganic polyphosphate intracellular metabolism has been provided in Mtb 47, 48 .",

A G4 was reported when at least four consecutive G-islands (n = 4) were identified. We also defined two parameters, l and d, corresponding to the minimal length of a G4 homopolymeric G-island and the maximum allowed distance between consecutive G-islands, respectively. Different combinations of l and d parameters were applied to allow the detection of G4 motifs with increasing stringency (i.e. 2 \u2264 l \u2264 5 and d = 7, 11, and 15); we chose G4s with loop length up to 15 nucleotides since it has been reported that they can fold into stable G4s 59 . Computational searches have detected a high concentration of G4 motifs near promoter regions both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes and in some cases a possible role of G4 motifs in transcription regulation has been reported 60 . For this reason and because of the abundance of GC content in Mtb, we restricted G4 analysis to regions close to transcription start sites (TSS).

            "text": "REsazurine Microtiter Assay (REMA). Drug sensitivity was determined using REMA as previously described 66 . Briefly, frozen stock cultures were grown on solid medium 7H10/ADN. Subsequently, a pre-culture was carried out in 2 ml of liquid medium (7H9/ADN) starting from an OD 540 of 0.05. Cultures were then grown up to mid-exponential phase (OD 540 0.6-0.8) and then diluted to an OD 540 of 0.01. Microplates suitable for fluorescence reading (96-well FluoroNunc TM black flat bottom plates) were used to determine the MIC of each bacterial strain. Serial dilutions were used to dispense the correct amount of each compound in each well. Each well was than inoculated with a bacterial suspension containing 5 \u00d7 10 4 cfu. The plates thus obtained were sealed and incubated for 1 week at 37 \u00b0C. After incubation, 10 \u00b5l (10% of final volume) of Alamar-Blue (Invitrogen) was added to each well and the plates, after another day of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, were read on a microplate reader (Tecan Infinite 200 Pro) to determine the relative fluorescence (excitation 535 nm and emission 590 nm). For each strain we used a positive control (cells without antibiotic) to determine the maximum fluorescence that could be obtained, and a negative control (medium plus antibiotic without cells). ",
