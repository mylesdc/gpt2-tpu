            "text": "Background: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is characterized by much diversity in terms of geography, society, economic development, and health outcomes. The health systems as well as healthcare structure and provisions vary considerably. Consequently, the progress toward Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in these countries also varies. This paper aims to describe the progress toward UHC in the ASEAN countries and discuss how regional integration could influence UHC. Design: Data reported in this paper were obtained from published literature, reports, and gray literature available in the ASEAN countries. We used both online and manual search methods to gather the information and 'snowball' further data. Results: We found that, in general, ASEAN countries have made good progress toward UHC, partly due to relatively sustained political commitments to endorse UHC in these countries. However, all the countries in ASEAN are facing several common barriers to achieving UHC, namely 1) financial constraints, including low levels of overall and government spending on health; 2) supply side constraints, including inadequate numbers and densities of health workers; and 3) the ongoing epidemiological transition at different stages characterized by increasing burdens of non-communicable diseases, persisting infectious diseases, and reemergence of potentially pandemic infectious diseases. The ASEAN Economic Community's (AEC) goal of regional economic integration and a single market by 2015 presents both opportunities and challenges for UHC. Healthcare services have become more available but health and healthcare inequities will likely worsen as better-off citizens of member states might receive more benefits from the liberalization of trade policy in health, either via regional outmigration of health workers or intra-country health worker movement toward private hospitals, which tend to be located in urban areas. For ASEAN countries, UHC should be explicitly considered to mitigate deleterious effects of economic integration. Political commitments to safeguard health budgets and increase health spending will be necessary given liberalization's risks to health equity as well as migration and population aging which will increase demand on health systems. There is potential to organize select health services regionally to improve further efficiency. Conclusions: We believe that ASEAN has significant potential to become a force for better health in the region. We hope that all ASEAN citizens can enjoy higher health and safety standards, comprehensive social protection, and improved health status. We believe economic and other integration efforts can further these aspirations.",

Since its inception in 1967, ASEAN has accomplished several notable achievements in the economic and nonproliferation realms (4, 5) . ASEAN is characterized by much diversity in terms of demographics, geography, society, economic development, political systems, and health outcomes (Table 1 ). These factors have not only contributed to the differences in health status of the region's diverse populations but also to the diverse nature of its health systems, which are at varying stages of evolution (6) . Consequently, UHC progress in these countries varies. The increasing multilateral collaboration between countries in the ASEAN region has led to the ambition to create the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by 2015. This regional economic integration aims to achieve a single market and production base, which is competitive, equitable, and integrated into global economy. The integration can potentially bring both positive and negative effects to country's effort in achieving UHC. This paper aims to describe the progress toward UHC in the ASEAN countries and discuss how regional integration could influence UHC.",

Significant progress has been made in expanding the coverage of health insurance, despite the existing gaps of insurance coverage across these countries (Fig. 1) . As of 2012, Thailand's entire population is covered by SHI. In Malaysia, technically the entire population can use public health services funded via general taxation and low user charges whilst in Singapore, 93% of the population is covered by Medi-Shield, the compulsory government organized health insurance scheme (7) . In Indonesia, about 60% of the population is covered by health insurance. The Indonesian government rolled out the Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial (BPJS) Kesehatan on January 1, 2014, with an ambition to achieve national coverage of UHC by January 2019. This initiative is coordinated by the BPJS \u00c1 the Social Security Administration, a national body under the auspices of the President of the Republic of Indonesia (8) . The coverage of health insurance is however, still low in Lao PDR (15%) and Cambodia (24%). In Lao PDR, the government is now considering the creation of a national health insurance authority through the integration of the four different social health protection schemes. The expectation is that a unified institutional arrangement will lead to universal coverage by 2020. In Cambodia, good progress has been made in using health equity funds to cover the poor. However, civil servants and private sector employees are not covered at all by insurance, while certain vulnerable groups such as the elderly and disabled are excluded from the user fee exemption scheme.",

In these countries, some to a greater extent than others, many policies and strategies have been established and implemented to facilitate progress toward UHC. For example, in Thailand, since 2002, the political commitment to universal access to healthcare was emphasized in the National Health Security Act that states that 'Thai population shall be entitled to a health service with such standards and efficiency'. In Indonesia, in 2004, the Presidential Bill No. 40/2004 on National Social Security System to protect Indonesian citizens from catastrophic household expenditure due to illness and death was enacted. In Cambodia, in 2005, a Master Plan for SHI was adopted, signifying an essential first step toward establishing a unified health protection system. In Vietnam, in 2012, the Prime Minister approved the Master Plan on UHC with a roadmap to achieve universal health insurance (UHI) coverage levels of 70% by 2015 and 80% by 2020, and to reduce OOP payment to 40% by 2020. In Myanmar, in 2012, the Government has endorsed the goal of achieving UHC by 2030 with aims to improve the health status of the poor and vulnerable, especially women and children. In the Philippines, in 2013, the president amended the National Health Insurance Act of 1995 by signing Republic Act 10606 which mandates the government to shoulder the premiums for the insurance of the indigent and informal sectors thus benefiting many Filipinos. Singapore recently announced the expansion of MediShield, a health insurance scheme designed to avert catastrophic OOP expendi-ture, which currently covers 93% of the population. The expanded program would be named MediShield Life. It will be mandatory with 100% population coverage and a stated aim of reducing co-insurance levels from the current 10\u00c120% to 3\u00c110% (9) . In Malaysia, the shape of UHC continues to be debated, with discussions currently centered on whether the country should transition to a SHI model, 1Care, which would allow the insured to access private facilities. Civil society and trade unions have expressed concerns that 1Care will subsidize private providers at the expense of the public, and discussions have since stalled (10, 11) . Furthermore, during the 11th ASEAN Health Ministers Meeting hosted by the Thailand Ministry of Public Health in 2012, a joint statement emphasizing five main health topics, including Building UHC, was signed (12) . Whilst there does appear to be a political commitment expressed for UHC, in reality it is difficult for policymakers to balance competing interests of the growing for-profit private sector (in most countries) and the moral imperative to ensure equal access to healthcare.",

Most countries in the ASEAN region allocated less than 5% of the gross domestic product (GDP) as expenditure on health in 2012, with the exception of Cambodia (5.4%) and Vietnam (6.6%). Government expenditure on health as a percentage of total expenditure of health ranged Health Organization argues that it is very difficult to achieve UHC if OOP as a percentage of total health spending is equal or greater than 30%, and that the target for UHC could be set at 100% protection from both impoverishing and catastrophic health payments for the population as a whole (2) . Government spending on health as a percentage of total government spending varies, from a low of 1.5% in Myanmar to 14.2% in Thailand. Overall, there are higher levels of private spending than public spending on health, with the exception of Brunei and Thailand (see Table 3 ). Government spending on health as a percentage of total health spending appears to be increasing moderately over time for most countries, except Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia and, to some extent, Cambodia (Fig. 2) . To ensure UHC, particularly given economic liberalization on the path to AEC, governments should safeguard health budgets and prioritize not only achievement but also maintenance of UHC. This is especially important among ASEAN's middle-income countries, which have arguably been underperforming in terms of social progress relative to countries at similar income levels in other regions (13) . The share of OOP as a percentage of total health spending in almost all the ASEAN countries, except Brunei and Thailand, was greater than 30% in 2012. As a consequence, the incidence of catastrophic medical expenditures based on the World Bank's methodology (using the cutoff point of 10% of total household spending) 1 was also high in these countries, especially in Vietnam and Cambodia (Table 3) . It should be noted that Singapore through Medisave has a compulsory health savings scheme with correspondingly higher OOP levels since these savings are considered private monies.",

The region is home to dynamic systems in which biological, social, ecological, and technological processes interconnect in ways that enable microbes to exploit new ecological niches (22) . At the same time, the ASEAN countries are facing an epidemiological transition with increased morbidity and mortality from NCDs. NCDs are now responsible for 60% of deaths in the region. The problem stems from the ageing of the population, life-style behaviors (tobacco use, alcohol use, unhealthy diet, and inadequate physical activity) and environmental factors. The triple burdens of diseases \u00c1 persistent and emerging infectious diseases, NCDs, and injuries \u00c1 pose significant threats to the populations in this region. Disadvantaged populations (such as the poor, people living in rural or remote areas, etc.) Table 4 . Health workforce in ASEAN countries are the hardest hit \u00c1 NCDs account for a high proportion of deaths in ASEAN and particularly as a proportion of deaths in wealthier countries, but they also kill more people in absolute numbers in the less developed countries of ASEAN, with the apparent exception of Cambodia (23) . As Table 1 shows, NCD age standardized mortality rates ranged highs of between 680 per 100,000 population in Indonesia and Lao PDR to 708.7 in Myanmar and 720 in the Philippines, compared to much lower rates observed in Singapore (264.8), Vietnam (435.4) and Thailand (449.1). Also important to note are that total mortality rates are relatively low in ASEAN. Deaths from infectious diseases have steadily declined, and currently there are relatively small proportions of older people (between 6 and 15% of those aged 60 or over among ASEAN countries, see (24) . The WHO at the 65th World Health Assembly in 2012 agreed to adopt a global target of 25% reduction in premature mortality from NCDs by 2025 (25), a target that we hope will be vigorously pursued in ASEAN. We refer to NCD data with caution, as few countries in ASEAN have complete causes of death information systems \u00c1 among them, Singapore is the only country with reliable cause of death certification and coding (6) . ASEAN also faces a demographic transition to a greater share of the elderly as a proportion of total population. In 2015, the percentage of those aged 65 and over is estimated to be 7.1% among ASEAN countries, with the highest proportion of elderly in Singapore (13.7%) and Thailand (12.0%). By 2030, the share of elderly is expected to almost double to a regional average of 12.3% of total population (26) . With increasing life expectancies and share of the elderly without commensurate increases in birth rates, population aging has implications for financing UHC and how benefits packages will evolve in the next 20 years, given that healthcare consumption increases with age.",

In Cambodia, having a responsive health financing system for both formal and informal sectors is the single biggest barrier to achieving UHC. There is no financial scheme for public servants due to low government salaries and low government spending on health. Furthermore, the concept of health insurance is rather new, with the non-existence of SHI financed by pay roll tax (27) . It is estimated that OOP for health was 61.7% in Cambodia in 2012 (27) . Women spent more than 10% of their total expenses on health, with the poorest spending 18% and the highest quintiles 14% (28) . In Indonesia, insufficient infrastructure (human resources, facilities, and equipment) has hindered progress toward universal coverage for the population, which policymakers aim to achieve by 2019. The ratio of doctors to population in Indonesia is amongst the lowest in Asia (only two for every 10,000 population in 2010, compared to an average of 5.5 per 10,000 population for countries in the WHO South East Asian region). Moreover, the ratio of hospital beds to the population is very low (six beds per 10,000 population against an average of 11 beds per 10,000 population in the WHO South East Asian region) (29) . With a large geographical archipelagic area, another huge challenge is to provide equal access to healthcare, including for populations in remote areas and islands of Indonesia. A national health information system (HIS) with unique individual identifiers is currently lacking in Indonesia. A complete and reliable HIS is essential for planning UHC; such a HIS should consider population movement, relevant to ease of obtaining access to healthcare outside of the person's residential area, and it should be possible to link health usage databases from different healthcare providers. In Lao PDR, the level of public expenditure on health, despite efforts to increase it, is still too low, and is currently insufficient to meet the health needs of the population. Geographically scattered and limited population coverage by social protection schemes are both major barriers to accessing care, resulting in a high level of OOP payments and impoverishment; a further government subsidy could help to ease the high burden of OOP payments. There is low utilization of health services because of geographically remote mountainous areas and poverty in Lao PDR. Despite prepayment schemes for four targeted population groups, there are still challenges to implementing these and expanding coverage (the ongoing health finance reform is now addressing this issue). The low quality of care at the health centers and district levels and the constraints of providing a full range of services at the primary care need to be addressed to gain people's confidence and increase utilization of services.",

The OOP payments, which decreased from 100% in 2000 to 71.3% in 2011, continue to account for almost all healthcare expenditure (31) . In the Philippines, the biggest barrier to achieving UHC is the increase in the coverage of insurance of PhilHealth without commensurate funding increases. In addition to under-funding, the devolution of health services by virtue of the Local Government Code of 1991 resulted in inefficient referral services. Richer Local Government Units tend to better support and maintain their facilities and services thus worsening health inequities between regions.",

In Vietnam, OOP payments as a share of total health expenditure have been always high, ranging from 50% to 70% (32). OOP payments are high and persistent, resulting in limited financial protection for the poor. Meanwhile, government subsidies for health are not sufficiently reaching the poor. Hospital subsidies, in particular, tend to favor the rich, exacerbating existing inequalities (33) .

            "text": "High and upper-middle income countries also face barriers in achieving UHC. In Thailand, access to healthcare is limited by the availability of service delivery, particularly health workforce. Despite having extensive networks of healthcare providers, challenges still exist in terms of healthcare provision in remote rural areas where it is difficult to attract and retain qualified health workers. The country has a low doctor-per-population ratio \u00c1 lower than other countries with a similar economic development level-due to an extended period of limited training capacity. Whilst the ratio of nurses to doctors is high, there is still a large discrepancy in the distribution of doctors and nurses across geographical regions, which is a major challenge for the government. In Singapore, the biggest hurdles are not financial or technical but ideological. The fears of moral hazard leading to overconsumption and over-servicing, as well as eventual financial unsustainability are the main reasons why the government is unprepared to embrace UHC in the spirit of other developed countries. Furthermore, there is a sincere belief that wealth and financial success must translate into better quality of living including healthcare \u00c1 'Work for reward, Reward for work' is a common mantra espoused by government officials (35) . In Malaysia, there are supply side constraints, with significant shortages of health professionals (36) . The MOH reported that they were able to fill just 64% of doctors' posts in 2009, 60% for dentists, and 77% for pharmacists. At the primary healthcare level, only 55% of family medicine specialist posts were filled, as well as 40% of doctors and 85% of nurses. Production capacity has been expanding in public and private medical schools, and the government continues to send medical students abroad on scholarships to receive their training to meet HR needs (36) . In Malaysia, a dual healthcare system has emerged, with private services for those who can afford them and public services for the rest, with quality perceived to be higher in the private than in the public sector (37) . This results in sicker and poorer patients using public services (36) . A barrier to achieving UHC will be to ensure that public sector service quality improves, and service capacity expands (especially in urban areas), to keep up with increased demand. Similar concerns have been voiced out about the emergence of a dual healthcare system in Thailand, where increased demand from the wealthy urban Thai population and to a lesser extent medical tourists for private health services may drive public health workers to the private sector (38) .",

The medical tourism industry in Asia is being catalyzed by the Medical Tourism Association (MTA), a US based non-profit organization that is aiming to set global standards for this industry. Health services tourism has become a substantial industry in Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia, combining health services for wealthy foreigners with recreational packages to boost consumption of such healthcare services (41) . However, each country has adopted different approaches toward medical tourism. In Malaysia, it is an explicit MOH policy to expand high-end private hospital care to cater to medical tourists (36) with the Malaysian Healthcare Travel Council established in 2009 as a promotional arm and subsidiary of the ministry. Of the 35 participating hospitals in 2010, some are corporatized public entities (e.g. National Heart Institute). Doctors in public hospitals with private wards can retain part of the fee for treating private patients, as they can in Singapore's corporatized public system. In Singapore, there is less explicit promotion to attract foreign patients by the MOH, as there has been in Thailand, where medical tourism is delivered and driven mainly by private hospitals (42) .",

Multinational healthcare companies are also required to establish local manufacturing facilities to promote knowledge transfer. Amendments to the negative investment list have been signed though by the President of the Republic of Indonesia through Presidential Decree Number 39 enacted on 23 April 2014 (44). This amendment was intended to increase foreign investment in Indonesia in preparation for the AEC. To illustrate some changes in the economic climate, the highest level of capital ownership of multinational pharmaceutical companies has increased from 75 to 85% (45) .",

Singapore is also establishing a proton beam therapy facility which should be affordably priced for appropriate ASEAN patients, perhaps through special government arrangements so that this resource can be well-utilized and made available to a much wider pool of patients. Expanding coverage of good-quality services and ensuring adequate human resources are also important to achieve UHC.
