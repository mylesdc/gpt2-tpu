To explore the feasibility of low-cost database construction, we studied the roadmap of HSMPD. A HSMPD-oriented tool, called \"signal-molecule-profiling (SMP) chip\" was developed for data acquisition, which can be employed in the routine blood tests in hospitals; the results will be stored in the HSMPD system automatically. HSMPD system can provide data services for the TBI community, which generates a stable income to support the data acquisition. The small-scale experimental test was performed in the hospital to verify SMP chips and the demo HSMPD software. One hundred and eighty nine complete SMP records were collected, and the demo HSMPD system was also evaluated in the survey study on patients and doctors. The function of SMP chip was verified, whereas the demo HSMPD software needed to be improved. The survey study showed that patients would only accept free tests of SMP chips when they originally needed blood examinations. The study indicated that the construction of HSMPD relies on the self-motivated cooperation of the TBI community and the traditional healthcare system. The proposed roadmap potentially provides an executable solution to build the HSMPD without high costs.",

Research on biobanks and medical databases provide opportunities for a broad spectrum of interests and applications in translational bioinformatics (TBI). Many countries plan to invest in health IT research by constructing biobanks and health information databases [1] . These projects make rapid improvements in this field. The ethical, legal and social needs of studies are integral concerns of the entire scientific community. A significant bioinformatics infrastructure effort that aims to construct high-capacity public health information databases is underway in Europe and the United States. For example, Biobank Norway will spend more than 13 million USD on the establishment of a biobank-based research infrastructure [2] . Many similar joint efforts on biobank infrastructure and research are available, in which governments around the world fund activities. Population-based health surveys and research biobanks gain much attention from TBI researchers and substantial international funding, such as the National Institute of Health in the United States, which is the largest funder of basic biomedical research in the world. Investments in the public health system enable large-scale surveys on medical issues to collect data and biological materials from large populations. The results of these surveys with the corresponding biomedical data or samples often turn into international open resources for TBI research. The Janus Serum Bank is an example of a useful biobank [3] . In this biobank, which includes 170,000 clinical samples, blood samples reserved for cancer research were collected through Norwegian health screening studies. Researchers in the field of biology, medical science, bioinformatics and health care systems will benefit from those types of biomedical databases and biobanks. For example, Thomas et al., applied bioinformatics approaches to identify pathways related to human leukemogens by using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database [4] .",

The IT service will substantially increase the efficiency and reliability of the medical diagnosis without increasing costs. Personalized Medicine and Telehealth may be achieved along with the development of HIT. The development of HIT usually begins with the construction of large biomedical databases [6] [7] [8] .

However, the existing databases mainly focus on laboratory studies instead of clinical studies. The completion and maintenance of these databases mainly depend on research funds from the government. Therefore, the current biomedical databases are still far from clinical auxiliary diagnoses. Few clinical databases have been established, such as ClinicalTrials, which currently lists 144,133 studies with locations in 50 states and 185 countries [15] .

            "text": "These biomedical databases can be roughly classified into three categories, according to the origin and properties of data. The first category, represented by ClinicalTrials [15] and Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR) [16] , which data came from biological studies or clinical trials is accumulated by scientific experiments. The scientific experiments were always designed for specific purposes, and the test objects were always selected. Consequently, the experimental data were restricted to a specific target field and had been investigated thoroughly before being included in the database. Not surprisingly, these multifarious data have little residual value for TBI researchers. The second category of biomedical database comes from gigantic scientific projects, such as the Human Genome Project (HGP) [13] . These prospective databases were directly designed for fundamental research, instead of a small-scale scientific topic. Before the data of genes were sequenced on a large-scale and collected, the standard data structure and file formats were defined in advance. Besides, the data acquisition in HGP was separated from in-depth analysis of the data, so the database could expand at a breathtaking speed. The final database is standard and ready for data processing, which greatly improved the research methodologies of genetics and correlative disciplines [17] . However, the investment of HGP reached an unparalleled peak in the field of biology and medical science. The third category of biomedical database is accumulated by hospitals. Incomputable clinical data are generated in the global healthcare system every day. These valuable data are derived from real clinical cases, rather than from simulation tests on animal models. In fact, they were used data of doctors, which means the costs of data acquisition have been majorly covered by the healthcare system. When the clinical data are translated to electronic health records (EHRs) in a public database, TBI studies will be greatly stimulated [18] . Unfortunately, these clinical databases often raise concerns about the privacy of patients, and are subject to multiple protections by laws and ethics rules. Moreover, the medical records are often irregular due to the multifarious treatment processes of different patients. Many researchers have conducted a large amount of pilot studies in clinical knowledge management. However, most of these studies have not entered into clinical use because of the high cost of data acquisition and the traditional work habits of doctors and nurses [19, 20] .",

Bioinformatics researchers seem to be the exclusive beneficiaries of EHRs at this stage. Therefore, two main strategies were proposed because of these circumstances. The first strategy is a compromise between the present healthcare systems and HIT, i.e., traditional medical records will be converted into EHRs without changing the equipment and working habits of the existing system. The primal challenge of this strategy is the cost and efficiency of EHR conversion. The second strategy aims to redesign medical tools to generate automatically standard EHRs during the manipulation of doctors and nurses. It will change the machines, instead of the doctors and nurses, to avoid the conversion of medical records. According to the second strategy, the project of human signal-molecule-profiling database (HSMPD) was proposed to take advantage of the current healthcare system to build a standard prospective database as HGD. HSMPD is different from the first category of biomedical databases, because it will not be limited by any scientific experiment and will not select the donors of clinical data. HSMPD is also different from the third category of bio-databases, or a data warehouse of common EHR. The data in HSMPD are designed and standardized on the purpose of TBI, which contains large quantity of redundant information to doctors, (shown in Figure 1 ). Besides, the HSMPD project is required to solve both the ethical and economic problems at the same time.",

            "text": "In this study, a 1,536-chamber microfluidic chip prototype called \"signal molecular profiling (SMP) chip\" was developed as a specific tool for the data acquisition of HSMPD. It can standardize the detection of multiple signal molecules in one blood sample. Signal molecules, e.g., hormones and cytokines, are biochemical molecules released in one part of the body and deliver messages to affected cells in other parts. Although the concentrations of signal molecules are usually extremely low, signal molecules are important to maintain and regulate the functions of the human body. SMP can be regarded a composite order set of the human body that can provide holographic data of the entire human body. Moreover, SMP is related not only to human gene mapping, but also to the interactions between the human body and the environment [21] . The concentrations of signal molecules could reveal the status of personal health [22] . When SMP changes irregularly, some drastic activities have been or will be occurring in the body. In most cases, this dramatic change indicates the advent of disease (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer and invasion of pathogens) [23] . Much effort has been made to discover the diagnostic relationships between serological biomarkers and their respective diseases. However, the progress is hampered by the absence of a high-capacity clinical database on human serological information. Only a small proportion of such diagnostic knowledge has been uncovered, whereas most mapping relationships remain unknown [24] . The network of signal molecules has a well-ordered structure, which has been studied worldwide for decades [4, 6, 11] . Biomedical researchers divide signal molecules into several overlapping functional clusters. Nowadays, clusters of signal molecules have been clinically employed as diagnostic bases. Translational relationships of signal molecules are more complex than what is known in physiology or pathology. For example, understanding that lung diseases have incomprehensible effects on sex hormones is difficult [25] . Medical and biological researchers find it difficult to reveal thorough relationships inside the complex system, whereas TBI researchers are competent for this work if a qualified database can be established. Figure 1 . Three categories of current biomedical databases. The current biomedical databases can be roughly classified into three categories according to the origin and properties of data. HSMPD was proposed to take advantage of the healthcare system to build a prospective database for TBI. HSMPD contains large quantity of redundant information to doctors, but the information is valuable to TBI researchers.",

The SMP chip can be employed to simultaneously measure at most 1,344 kinds of hormones and cytokines in one serum sample (Figure 4 ). In fact, several versions of SMP chip prototypes were designed on the basis of previous research experience [27] [28] [29] [30] and fabricated by using different materials and processes. The SMP chips here were fabricated in laminated poly(methyl methacrylate) slides by our laser engraving experience as described before [31, 32] . In the SMP chip, 12.5% of total chambers are preserved for calibration tests. Therefore, only 1,344 chambers were left for monitoring targeted molecules. The sensing capability of the chip depends on an isothermal amplification assay, which is regarded as a combination of sandwich immunoassay and quantitative NASBA assay [33] . The sensitivity of the immuno-NASBA assay provides a convenient solution to quantify traces of signal molecules in samples. Similar to the previous immuno-NASBA chips, the SMP chip has the same dimensions as the 1,536-well microtiter plate, thus making the SMP chip readable in a microplate reader. The capability of the SMP chip was not completely exploited at the pilot stage. To demonstrate the SMP chip, 16 types of different capture antibodies were integrated on the chip to measure 16 types of signal molecule targets, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), cortisol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), erythropoietin (EPO), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-8. Given that a specific chip reader was developing, the SMP chips were operated manually and read in a microplate reader as described in our previously publications [31, 33] .",

In total 200 SMP chip units were provided as new tools for ordinary blood testing to clinical laboratories in the cooperating hospital. Given that the testing samples for SMP chips were only diluted serums, a small volume of blood samples was enough for a single SMP test, which means that the remaining sample left from an ordinary blood test is usually sufficient for an additional SMP test. When patients are advised by doctors to examine the blood, the patients will go to the blood-collection room for blood sampling. Our researchers were permitted to wait in the room and give the patients suggestions to permit the additional SMP tests accompanied by their original blood tests. The data acquisition was performed in a passive way, i.e., the participators were randomly involved in. We orally interviewed the patients, doctors and nurses regarding their attitude towards the SMP test. The investigators for survey studies were divided into two groups: one group interviewed the people who will get their blood tested in the blood-collection room of hospitals, whereas the other group randomly interviewed the pedestrians in city streets far away from hospitals (Ziyang City, China). The subjects for this investigation were randomly selected and unfiltered. The time period of each group was consistent and was evenly distributed in two weeks. We made further inquiries 189 amicable interviewees who were willing to take the SMP tests about their background, as well as the privacy protection in SMP data. The patients were fully informed before the voluntary agreements for SMP tests were signed. The researchers obtained the respective remaining samples from nurses after the ordinary blood tests were performed. No extra sampling of blood was performed in this study.",

The reasons for the rejection can be divided into two: first, the patients considered the SMP tests useless for them; second, the patients were distrustful of this scientific project.

The privacy section cannot be accessed without the mediation of a trusted intermediary, whereas the public part is allowed to contain SMP values and medical comments from doctors. The identity information of patients is replaced by a string of numbers, PCP, which could make each clinical record anonymous to scientists. In addition, the PCP is also a pseudonym of each patient. PCP can help the TBI researchers to distinguish individual records in HSMPD and retain a clue for in-depth studies when it is necessary. To some important patients or doctors, TBI researchers could indirectly contact them through the trusted intermediary according to the PCPs. If the patients or doctors are willing to participate in the in-depth study, the researchers can access detailed clinical data. The role of PCP may then be acceptable for both parties. The decoding of the raw date in the curves was described before [33] . Multiple signal molecule targets in patient samples were measured on the SMP chips, while some patient samples were also quantified by the other ELISA kits. The input of MC in HSMPD seemed to be a challenge. From the interviews with doctors, the feedback shows their disfavour of electronic recording for the HSMPD. They prefer to use the traditional way of inputting their comments in the database system installed in the hospital. Moreover, doctors were unwilling to spend any time on filling unnecessary forms. To avoid the typing of medical comments, as some doctors suggested, the HSMPD interfaces could be merged into the local hospital information system (HIS), hence the medical records of the patients could be exported into the HSMPD automatically. Many HIS software applications have been commercialized. One of them was used inside the cooperating hospital, which has a well-designed database system to organize the daily work in the hospital. Most fields in the HSMPD, such as PN, DN, NN, MC and Time, have been built into the HIS. The HSMPD software of the next version might become an add-in program of current HIS system, which interfaces should strictly fit the current work habits of doctors and nurses.",

Shrinking the chips might save expensive antibodies, but the cost of detection modules will increase consequently. The compatibility of SMP chips provides multiple choices of detection modules. The current detection module was a microplate reader, whereas a more professional SMP-chip reading platform is still being developed potentially on the basis of our previous research achievements [35] [36] [37] .

Anonymous records have to be employed the infrastructure of the HSMPD, which means that the database will not release the fields of non-essential personal information, such as name, home address and birthday. Only physiological and medical information will be shared in the public database. Traditional consent norms and policies require participants to be fully informed of the nature and risks of the research [38] . However, considering the large number of participants and the long-term nature of the HSMPD, obtaining specific consent from millions of participants for each study is impossible [39] . A logical consequence is to seek alternative approaches such as having a trusted intermediary that consents on behalf of the participants, e.g., government departments. The hidden fields involving the private information of patients may be used to disclose the real identity of patients; therefore, those fields should be legally protected. Abuse of the data in the HSMPD could be prevented under legal supervision.",

This project needs to have relatively small investments at the early stage. However, given that the HSMPD relies on the information resource of the database, the HSMPD needs to acquire income to maintain its growth. This stage has entered a cycle of positive feedback. The larger the capability of HSMPD is, the more abundant the funding from the IT service becomes. When the HSMPD matures, commercialized HIT services will continue to bring a virtuous cycle for the entire system, whereas TBI researchers might obtain more resources for further study.",

The HSMPD, an ideal clinical database, is designed for TBI research and supported by its standardized tool for data acquisition. The clinical records in HSMPD could be a promising resource to significantly influence the TBI research. However, nontechnical challenges mainly hinder the construction of HSMPD, including the high cost of data acquisition and some ethical issues. By comparison, the technical aspect of HSMPD project is not very challenging. A feasible solution was proposed to build the HSMPD with minimum investment, which relies on the cooperation of IT, instrumentation engineering, health care systems and the TBI community. The SMP chip and the demo HSMPD system were developed and preliminarily evaluated in the hospital. The positive results in this study demonstrated a rational and acceptable mode for the construction of HSMPD, which will play a role as the prospective bridge between traditional health care systems and the TBI community.",
