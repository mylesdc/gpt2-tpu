This study identified that NS5 (VPg), is capable of inducing cell cycle arrest in the absence of viral replication or other viral proteins in an analogous manner to MNV-1 infection. NS5 expression induced an accumulation of cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase in an asynchronous population by inhibiting progression at the G 1 /S restriction point. Furthermore, NS5 expression resulted in a down-regulation of cyclin A expression in asynchronous cells and inhibited cyclin A expression in cells progressing from G 1 to S phase. The activity of NS5 on the host cell cycle occurs through an uncharacterized function. Amino acid substitutions of NS5(Y26A) and NS5(F123A) that inhibit the ability for NS5 to attach to RNA and recruit host eukaryotic translation initiation factors, respectively, retained the ability to induce an accumulation of cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase as identified for wild-type NS5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a VPg protein manipulating the host cell cycle.",

NS5 additionally has a role in genome replication, acting in place of an RNA 5 0 cap to provide a free hydroxyl that can be extended by the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS7) [10] . The NS5 protein also acts to aid viral translation, recruiting host eukaryotic translation initiation factors to initiate translation of viral proteins [11] .

The G 1 /S checkpoint controls progression from the first gap phase (G 1 ), a period of substantial cell growth, into the synthesis phase (S) where the host DNA is replicated. Progression through G 1 /S is predominantly controlled by the phosphorylation status of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which is in turn controlled by the activities of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) (reviewed in [22] ). Cyclins are expressed at various stages of cell division and bind to their corresponding CDK and phosphorylate numerous targets including pRb. In early G 1 phase, cyclin D family members bind to CDK4/6 and phosphorylate pRb, driving G 1 phase progression and expression of E and A cyclins. Cyclin E forms a complex with CDK2, which further phosphorylates pRb to release an E2F transcription factor, driving S phase entry [23] . Cyclin A levels continue to increase during S phase and help drive cell cycle progression through the later stages of the cell cycle, through to the initiation of prophase during mitosis [24, 25] .",

Flanking the 3 0 end of the NS5 sequence was a stop codon (bold) and a HindIII restriction site (TGAAAGCTT). The NS5 variants sequences had alanine substitutions inserted at the tyrosine 26 and phenylalanine 123, named NS5 (Y26A) and NS5(Y26A) respectively. The resulting plasmids were transformed into XL1-Blue MRF 0 E. coli cells and used as templates for in vitro RNA synthesis.",

We sought to determine if a viral encoded protein was responsible by analysis of the non-structural proteins of MNV-1 for effects to the host cell cycle. The NS5 protein from caliciviruses is essential to viral RNA transcription and translation and is essential for calicivirus replication. The NS5 protein has been shown to bind host eukaryotic translation initiation factors, recruiting these proteins for preferential viral translation and potentially inhibiting host protein expression [11, 30] . We hypothesized that an inhibition of host protein expression may contribute to a cell cycle arrest. The effect of NS5 on the host cell cycle was therefore determined by transfection of RAW-Blue cells with RNA transcripts, encoding individual viral genes, NS1-2 from MNV-1 was included as a negative control (Fig 1A) . NS1-2 and NS5 were detected by their corresponding antibodies 18 h posttransfection (Fig 1C) . Expression of NS5 increased the population of cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase by 28% and decreased the S phase by 27% when compared to the mock-transfected population ( Fig 1B) . Furthermore, NS5 expression decreased cyclin A expression by 68% when compared to the mock-transfected control ( Fig 1D) . The cyclin A protein governs S phase entry and progression, so a decrease in expression would imply a decrease in S phase entry, further indicating NS5 as the protein responsible for the MNV-1 induced cell cycle manipulation. NS1-2 had no significant effects on the host cell cycle or cyclin A expression.",

The transition through G 1 /S is a highly regulated checkpoint during cell division and is often targeted by viruses to induce changes to the host cell cycle [14, 18, 31, 32] . The transition of cells through the G 1 /S restriction point was examined in cells expressing NS5. Cells were synchronized to the G 1 phase through N-butyrate treatment, released from the arrest and transfected with NS5, NS1-2 and GFP coding RNA. NS1-2 was used as a viral control protein that did not affect the cell cycle and GFP as a non-viral RNA negative control. N-butyrate was also added to released populations and used as a positive control. Cells were then analyzed for their transition from G 1 into S phase by FACS analysis of the host cell cycle. GFP, NS1-2 and NS5 RNA transcripts were translated into protein and detected from 15 to 24 hours post-G 1 release (Fig 2A) . The Nbutyrate treated cells remained predominantly in G 1 phase post-release while the mock-transfected cells came out of the G 1 arrest, indicated by a decrease in the G 0 /G 1 population and an increase in the S phase cells post-release (Fig 2C) . Transfection of GFP and NS1-2 RNA had no effect on the transition of cells from G 1 into S phase compared to the mock-transfected population, with both GFP and NS1-2 transfected populations progressing into S phase, with a substantial decrease in the G 0 /G 1 population observed at 21 hours post-release, similar to the mock-transfected population (Fig 2C) . In contrast, transfection of NS5 RNA induced a G 1 /S phase arrest, as indicated by cells remaining in the G 1 phase post-release, with no increase in the S phase population. At 24 hours post-release in NS5 transfected populations, 73% of cells remained in the G 0 /G 1 phase compared to 46% in the mock-transfected population (Fig 2C) .",

In a G 1 arrested population expression of cyclin A is low, indicated by undetectable levels of cyclin A in N-butyrate treated cells (Fig 2D) . In mock-transfected, GFP and NS1-2 transfected populations, cyclin A expression increased from 18 to 24 hours post-release as cells entered S phase. In NS5 transfected cells, cyclin A levels remained below detectable limits post-release, as transfected cells remained in G 0 /G 1 phase and did not progress into S phase.

It was hypothesized that the manipulation of the host cell cycle by NS5 could be driven by its association with host eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4G, leading to inhibition of host translation, as seen with plant VPg proteins [34] , and thus potentially inducing a cell cycle arrest. The ability of MNV NS5 to bind to eIF4G can be abolished through the introduction of a phenylalanine to alanine substitution at position 123 (NS5(F123A)) [30] . Not only does the NS5(F123A) substitution inhibit binding to scaffold protein eIF4G, it abolishes viral replication. We predicted that the introduction of the NS5(F123A) substitution could inhibit its cell cycle control. RNA transcripts encoding WT NS5, NS5(F123A) and NS1-2 were generated, transfected into an asynchronous cell population and their cell cycle effects analyzed by flow cytometry. Both NS5 and NS5(F123A) could be detected by the \u03b1-NS5 antibody (Fig 3C) . Expression of viral NS1-2 had no effect on the host cell cycle while expression of both NS5 and the NS5(F123A) variant increased the G 0 /G 1 population by~22% and decreased the S phase population proportionally when compared to the mock-transfected population (Fig 3B) . Furthermore, the NS5(F123A) variant decreased cyclin A protein expression by 67% when compared to the mocktransfected population in a synonymous manner to NS5, strongly implying that the host eukaryotic initiation factor binding domain of NS5 does not play a role in its cell cycle manipulation (Fig 3D) .",

            "text": "The NS5 protein from MNV is covalently attached at the 5 0 terminus of viral RNA, acting as a cap to prime RNA synthesis [8] . Attachment of NS5 to viral RNA occurs via the tyrosine residue at position 26 (Y26) in MNV, lying within a highly conserved EYDE motif in caliciviruses [10, 35, 36] . Substitution of the Y26 residue with an alanine residue NS5(Y26A) prevents the formation of NS5-viral RNA [10, 37] . The nucleotidylation of NS5 at Y26 is likely contingent upon viral RNA polymerase (NS7), which is not present in the expression system used in this study. To further confirm that Y26 residue is not involved in the cell cycle arrest through an unidentified mechanism, an alanine substitution at Y26 was introduced (NS5 (Y26)). Although the viral genome and NS7 protein is absent in the transfection, we could not exclude that NS5 could be attaching via the Y26 residue to host RNA. RNA encoding WT NS5, NS5(Y26A) and NS1-2 were synthesized, transfected into an asynchronous cell population and their cell cycle effects analyzed by flow cytometry. Both NS5 and NS5(Y26A) could be detected by the \u03b1-NS5 antibody (Fig 4C) . Expression of viral NS1-2 had no effect on the host cell cycle while both NS5 and NS5(Y26A) expression increased the G 0 /G 1 population by~20% and decreased the S phase population proportionally when compared to the mock-transfected population ( Fig 4B) . Furthermore, WT NS5 and NS5(Y26A) decreased cyclin A protein expression by 69% and 73% respectively when compared to the mock-transfected population (Fig 4D) . These results, combined with the absence of viral RNA polymerase, imply that nucleotidylation to RNA via the Y26 residue has no role in NS5 ability to manipulate the host cell cycle.",

This study identifies that the NS5 protein from MNV-1 is able to induce a cell cycle arrest analogous to that of MNV-1 infection in a mouse macrophage cell line, in the absence of other viral factors. Changes to the host cell cycle post NS5 expression was nearly identical to that observed under MNV-1 infection with the G 0 /G 1 population increasing by 24% and 28% and the corresponding S phase population decreasing by 26% and 27% respectively. Expression of NS5 alone was sufficient to induce an accumulation of cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase and reduce cyclin A expression in an asynchronous population. Further confirmation of NS5 as the cell cycle regulator comes from analyzing the ability of NS5 to inhibit the G 1 /S transition and prevent cyclin A accumulating in a population progressing from G 1 into S phase. These effects on the host cell cycle are consistent with the observed effects of MNV-1 infection, showing NS5 to be a causative agent of this cell cycle arrest.",

The concentration of host eukaryotic initiation factors by VPg proteins is predicted to impair host translation [36] . Shut-off of host protein translation has been shown to induce cell cycle arrests in several cell phases including G 1 and G 2 /M [41, 42] . We analyzed the impact on the host cell cycle of NS5 binding to host eukaryotic initiation factors through the introduction of an amino acid substitution that was known to impede binding to eIF4G [30] . The NS5(F123A) substitution had no effect on the ability of NS5 to induce a G 1 arrest indicating an alternative mechanism is responsible for the cell cycle manipulation.",
