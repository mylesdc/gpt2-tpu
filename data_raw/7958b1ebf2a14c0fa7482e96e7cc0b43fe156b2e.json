A: Virus titres in MERS-CoV infectious camels used as a natural infection model were evaluated for 14 days post challenge (d.p.c.) using standard curve based RT-qPCR assay to report MERS-CoV GE (TCID 50 /ml). Dotted line represents the detection limit of the assay, which is determined in graph B. B: Viral RNA from a sample with a known TCID 50 /ml titre was utilised to set up the standard curve in RT-qPCR to evaluate the MERS-CoV GE (TCID 50 /ml) titres. The detection limit of the assay was considered as the value of the last dilution before the plateau curve.

The scores were recorded as arbitrary units of 0 (normal), 0.25 (recovered), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe) depending on the nasal discharge abundance. Statistical analysis on areas under the curve of these scores is presented in Figure 3 . +: seropositive; -: seronegative; C: control group; V: vaccinated group; Co-: co-housed camel. Seronegative dromedary calves, below 1 year old, were immunised with PBS (n=2) or ChAdOx1-eGFP (n=1) in group AG01 (black triangles) or with ChAdOx1 MERS in group AG02 (n=3; blue squares). Older calves, below 2 years old, were immunised with ChAdOx1 MERS in group AG03 (n=3; red circles). Anti-spike antibody levels were assessed in endpoint titre ELISA (A) and Euroimmun ELISA kits (B). Correlation between values in both assays is presented in (C). Linear regression between the antibody titres in the Endpoint ELISA and Euroimmun ELISA ratios showed a significant relationship with R 2 = 0.82 and p < 0.0001; and a significant correlation with Pearson r = 0.90 and p < 0.0001.
