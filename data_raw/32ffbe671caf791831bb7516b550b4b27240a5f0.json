The second study, Al-Turaiki et al, 17 utilized publicly available data from the Saudi Ministry of Health. The major shortcomings in their study were several potential confounding factors such as underlying medical conditions and a primary or secondary mode of MERS-CoV transmission that had not been included in the analysis. In addition, the recovery delay was not reported in their study, and thus, factors related to the recovery delay were not examined.",
