            "text": "Objective: The outbreak of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014 exerted enormous global public reaction via the Internet and social media. This study aimed to investigate and evaluate the public reaction to Ebola in China and identify the primitive correlation between possible influence factors caused by the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and Chinese public attention via Internet surveillance. Methods: Baidu Index (BDI) and Sina Micro Index (SMI) were collected from their official websites, and the disease-related data were recorded from the websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and U.S. National Ministries of Health. The average BDI of Internet users in different regions were calculated to identify the public reaction to the Ebola outbreak. Spearman's rank correlation was used to check the relationship of epidemic trends with BDI and SMI. Additionally, spatio-temporal analysis and autocorrelation analysis were performed to detect the clustered areas with the high attention to the topic of \"Ebola\". The related news reports were collected from authoritative websites to identify potential patterns. Results: The BDI and the SMI for \"Ebola\" showed a similar fluctuating trend with a correlation coefficient = 0.9 (p < 0.05). The average BDI in Beijing, Tibet, and Shanghai was higher than other cities. However, the disease-related indicators did not identify potential correlation with both indices above. A hotspot area was detected in Tibet by local autocorrelation analysis. The most likely cluster identified by spatiotemporal cluster analysis was in the northeast regions of China with the relative risk (RR) of 2.26 (p \u010f 0.01) from 30 July to 14 August in 2014. Qualitative analysis indicated that negative news could lead to a continuous increase of the public's attention until the appearance of a positive news report. Conclusions: Confronted with the risk of cross-border transmission of the infectious disease, online surveillance might be used as an innovative approach to perform public communication and health education through examining the public's reaction and attitude.",

We gathered the daily BDI with \"\u57c3\u535a\u62c9 (Ebola)\" as the keyword in cities/provinces to examine the public response. Additionally, Given Internet users in different locations, the average BDI was calculated to identify the mean attention of the netizens (1/100 million) in each province and some cities. Also, we used the same strategy to investigate the blogs posted and forwarded daily for the topic of \"Ebola\" by the Sina Micro Index (SMI). The headline news reports concerning \"Ebola\" were also collected. These media events were retrieved from two sources: the headlines by the Baidu Index and Baidu News [32] . The former does not carry news headlines of the same topic every day, especially of topics with minor fluctuations of BDI. The latter not only provides the related media events but also sorts focused news by the topic word. Finally, the collected media events were abstracted and categorized as positive or negative news. Media events were classified as negative if it generated negative sentiments or attitudes towards the topic of Ebola, or as positive if it aroused optimistic sentiments or supportive attitudes towards \"Ebola\". These were determined by two individuals, and were eventually decided by the third person if a discrepancy existed.",

To explore the public reaction, the average public reaction of the BDI (average BDI) among Internet users from different regions was calculated by the mean or median (P50), in which P50 was used as data distribution did not suffer the test of normality. Spearman's rank correlation was employed to check the relationship of epidemic trends with BDI and SMI. The autocorrelation analysis included general autocorrelation analysis and local autocorrelation analysis. The general autocorrelation used the global Moran's Index. According to the value of Moran's Index, the result would be determined as a clustered distribution, dispersed distribution, or random distribution, respectively [33] . When the p value of the global Moran's Index was less than 0.05, the local autocorrelation analysis would be carried out by local Getis's Gi* to identify the potential hotspots. Additionally, Kulldorff's space-time scan statistics was carried out to recognize the special cities/provinces with high attention to \"Ebola\" [34] . The parameters of the maximum spatial cluster size and maximum temporal cluster size used the default settings (50%). The log likelihood ratio (LLR) was calculated through comparing the real average BDI with the expected average BDI, and a Monte Carlo test (p < 0.05) was utilized to determine the most likely clustered regions. Spatial-temporal analysis was done using ArcGIS software (version 10.1, ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA) and SaTScan software (version 9.1.1, Boston, MA, USA). All of the results were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05.",

Compared with common network tools, including content analysis, indices such as BDI and SMI to investigate public attention possessed unique merits. Firstly, these indicators could identify nearly all retrieved information to the specific keywords on the Big Data platform, while content analysis might only be implemented in limited samples. Additionally, BDI and SMI could mirror the public attention in a timely manner, whereas conventional methods might cause bias, and even be seriously affected by information deletion in websites. In our study, both indices consistently suggested the tremendous public concern to the Ebola event in China. Then, included in the study were the centralized tendency of BDI and average public attention to the Ebola outbreak as indicated by average BDI in different cities/provinces of China. The highest BDI was observed in Guangdong, the province with the largest number of Internet users in China. This might be partly attributed to the opportunities brought about by China's booming economy, inducing large numbers of West Africans coming to southeast coastal cities including Guangdong, which might lead to overreaction by local netizens. Additionally, the highest average attention to the Ebola outbreak was found in Beijing, the political center of China, along with comparable average BDI in Shanghai, the economic center of the country. The direct flights from these cities to West Africa might contribute to the increase of the average BDI. Interestingly, comparable public attention to Ebola was captured in Tibet, an underdeveloped region, which might be explained by the unique geographical location. Tibet has an underdeveloped transportation system, lower population density, and limited communication, all factors probably contributing to the more frequent web access to acquire information. Therefore, more attention should be paid in Tibet concerning public health education and rumor management. The spatio-temporal analysis had identified 13 clustered regions with higher average attention in China from 30 July to 14 August. During the same period, the daily BDI also indicated higher attention than other periods in China. Thus, we thought that the 15 days after the peak of the BDI was a critical period for infectious diseases with imported risk and that necessary health education intervention should be adopted in these clustered regions.

Contrary to our expectation, no existing statistical correlation was established between case-related influencing indicators and BDI/SMI, which was discrepant with our previous findings [18] and other studies [7, 37] . This might be attributable to the fact that Ebola epidemics did not occur in China. The public, justifiably, pays more attention to the disease-related data when the outbreak takes place in their location. Otherwise, the public focuses more on the news reports and the notices from the authorities. The assumption was partly testified by the observation that the peaks of BDI and SMI were usually accompanied with some negative news reports and the decline of the indices followed the positive reports. Additionally, the appearance of a suspected Ebola case in Hong Kong might serve as the vital reason for the first peak of BDI and SMI. Moreover, the particular geographic location and administrative position of Hong Kong should be considered as influencing factors of the public's attention.",

Thanks to the worldwide spread of diseases coupled with the easy access to network information, communicable diseases such as Ebola, did not only affect the locations of the outbreak but also could cause panic or even major public health events in non-endemic areas. In the public health field, increased Internet searching implied the tremendous need of Ebola-related preventive knowledge to the public. That is to say, high attention areas could be more susceptible to rumors or false online information if public health authorities did not address the emerging public concerns in a timely manner. To handle the demand warranted by this emerging situation, traditional epidemiological methods and public health education modes were obviously inadequate. Online surveillance, with the aid of opinion indices, may have sensitively detected the emergence of serious infectious diseases at their initial stage via the Big Data platform in previous studies, which could buy time for controlling outbreaks of these diseases and reducing the risk of transmission to humans [28, 38, 39] . That is to say, this modality, different from classic epidemiology questionnaires and telephone interviews developed to know the public reaction after the disease outbreak, enables surveillance beforehand and saves health resources. More importantly, online surveillance can reflect public reactions to emergency public health events and disease outbreaks in a timely manner so that public health interventions can be implemented during epidemic crises to avoid deterioration. Additionally, compared to the classical health education mode aimed at high-risk populations in high morbidity regions, our results implied a need for a shift in health education methods to a public-attention-based mode, especially in non-epidemic areas, to identify the regions of high attention. This new mode should be based on the findings of opinion monitoring through public reaction indices like BDI and SMI. Different interventions, in the future, should be adopted for areas with different indices, more attention being targeted at high-index areas in terms of public propaganda and education.",
