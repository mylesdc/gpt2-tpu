            "text": "Rodents and bats are now widely recognised as important sources of zoonotic virus infections in other mammals, including humans. Numerous surveys have expanded our knowledge of diverse viruses in a range of rodent and bat species, including their origins, evolution, and range of hosts. In this study of pegivirus and human hepatitis-related viruses, liver and serum samples from Vietnamese rodents and bats were examined by PCR and sequencing. Nucleic acids homologous to human hepatitis B, C, E viruses were detected in liver samples of 2 (1.3%) of 157 bats, 38 (8.1%), and 14 (3%) of 470 rodents, respectively. Hepacivirus-like viruses were frequently detected (42.7%) in the bamboo rat, Rhizomys pruinosus, while pegivirus RNA was only evident in 2 (0.3%) of 638 rodent serum samples. Complete or near-complete genome sequences of HBV, HEV and pegivirus homologues closely resembled those previously reported from rodents and bats. However, complete coding region sequences of the rodent hepacivirus-like viruses substantially diverged from all of the currently classified variants and potentially represent a new species in the Hepacivirus genus. Of the viruses identified, their routes of transmission and potential to establish zoonoses remain to be determined.",

Rodent meat is a popular source of protein for human consumption in Vietnam, particularly in the Mekong Delta, where rats (Rattus spp. and Bandicota indica) are commonly trapped and sold live in wet markets [21] . The total annual consumption of rat meat in Vietnam is estimated at 3300-3600 tonnes [22] . Hoary bamboo rats (Rhizomys pruinosus) are additionally farmed for human consumption. Moreover, bat faeces collected from bat caves or farms is used as natural fertilizer (\"guano\") in Vietnam. As rodents and bats are reservoirs or carriers of a significant number of zoonotic pathogens [23] and viruses with unknown zoonotic potential, there are health risks that are associated with exposure to these animals. However, a previous study [22] showed none of the surveyed rat catchers or processors were aware of infection risks from contact with live rats. Consequently, no precautions were taken for the handling of rodents.",

Coinfection with hepacivirus and HEV was observed in a sample from Rattus losea. All liver samples from bats were negative for hepacivirus and hepatitis E related virus and no sample was positive for pegivirus. and 335 other rats whose liver samples were screened for hepacivirus as above. Hepacivirus RNA was only detected in serum samples of 10 bamboo rats with positive liver samples. Pegivirus RNA was detected in two samples from Rattus tanezumi.",

After exclusion of primers, the obtained screening sequences from each targeted virus clustered in one or two clades of those with high identity and were most closely related to sequences previously reported from rodents or bats from the US [17, 18] , China [7] and Vietnam [16] . Rodent hepacivirus sequences (360 nucleotides) formed two well supported clades (Figure 2a) . Clade 1 included all of 35 sequences from Rhizomys pruinosus which shared 84.5-100% pairwise nucleotide identity while three sequences (nucleotide identity of 89-99%) from Rattus losea and Rattus argentiventer grouped in clade 2. These clades differed from each other by mean distances of 39.6% and 33.2% at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. While the four Vietnamese bamboo rat hepacivirus genomes were highly similar to each other (<12% nucleotide and <3% amino acid distances in the complete coding region (cds)), they were remarkably different from the closest sequence (KC815310) with the corresponding distances of 40% and 36%, respectively ( Table 2 ). The amino acid p-distances of the obtained hepacivirus sequences and KC815310 in the regions 1123-1566 and 2536-2959 (numbered relative to M62321) were 30% and 32%, respectively. The newly identified hepaciviruses therefore could be provisionally classified as members of a new hepacivirus species (Figure 2b ) [32] . The other bamboo rat hepaciviruses in clade 1 may also belong to this new virus species on the basis of the high sequence identity in this clade. Similarly, although complete genome sequences were not determined for hepaciviruses in clade 2, they likely belong to species Hepacivirus G due to their low amino acid p-distances (7.6-8.4%) in the screening region to KJ950938. The 5' untranslated region sequences of these hepaciviruses contain two miR-122 seed sites (CACUCC), which were located 51 nucleotides from each other, as consistent with the suspected hepatotropism of the viruses.",

While the identified rodent hepaciviruses appear host species specific, four rodent species were infected with highly similar HEV homologues, which were phylogenetically interspersed, indicative of low host species specificity. This is a characteristic that may lead to their establishment and emergence in new hosts. Understanding the receptor usage for cell entry of HEV in rodents and other host species would potentially help predict the host range of the virus. Furthermore, a surrogate assay with pseudotyped viruses carrying surface/envelope proteins of the identified viruses may be useful in assessing their potential to infect human liver cells.
