            "text": "The laboratory mouse is the workhorse of immunology, used as a model of mammalian immune function, but how well immune responses of laboratory mice reflect those of free-living animals is unknown. Here we comprehensively characterize serological, cellular and functional immune parameters of wild mice and compare them with laboratory mice, finding that wild mouse cellular immune systems are, comparatively, in a highly activated (primed) state. Associations between immune parameters and infection suggest that high level pathogen exposure drives this activation. Moreover, wild mice have a population of highly activated myeloid cells not present in laboratory mice. By contrast, in vitro cytokine responses to pathogen-associated ligands are generally lower in cells from wild mice, probably reflecting the importance of maintaining immune homeostasis in the face of intense antigenic challenge in the wild. These data provide a comprehensive basis for validating (or not) laboratory mice as a useful and relevant immunological model system.

Laboratory mice have been genetically isolated from their free-living relatives for more than 80 years such that laboratory strains capture only a small part of the genetic variation present in wild populations [1] [2] [3] . The genome of the laboratory mouse is a mosaic of the M. musculus domesticus and Mus musculus musculus genomes 4 . Laboratory mouse strains are also mostly genetically homozygous often resulting in phenotypes caused by recessive alleles. Indeed, major differences exist among inbred mouse strains in immune phenotype and function, and resistance or susceptibility to infectious or inflammatory diseases. Many of these traits have been mapped to specific loss of function mutations in genes that affect the immune response 5 .",

In adaptation to the laboratory, mice have been selected for rapid growth, early maturation, high fecundity and docility 6 and inadvertent selection for immunological traits is almost certain. Equally important for immune function, laboratory mice typically live in highly controlled and optimized environments, have unlimited access to food and are kept free of pathogens; the increasing trend towards housing animals in individually ventilated cages further reduces exposure to environmental antigens. By contrast, wild mice are continually exposed to environmental antigens, are typically infected by numerous microparasites and macroparasites, and face competition for resources (for example, food, mates, safe nesting places). Wild mouse populations are subject to continual selection in this very different antigenic and physical environment, where immune responses make an important contribution to their fitness.",

It is remarkable that mice-the central model used in immunology-are so immunologically understudied in the wild. In these studies, wild caught mice co-housed with laboratory mice and immunized with either sheep red blood cells 9 or keyhole limpet haemocyanin 10 developed higher anti-sheep red blood cells and anti-keyhole limpet haemocyanin antibody responses (greater lytic activity; and higher concentration and avidity, respectively) than laboratory mice. Small scale, ex vivo flow cytometric studies report higher proportions of activated CD4 \u00fe T cells, B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells in spleens of wild mice compared to laboratory mice 10 , and skewing of the natural killer (NK) cell population to a supposedly less mature phenotype but with higher resting levels of NK cell activation in wild mice compared with laboratory mice 11 . A small-scale comparison of wild and pet mice with laboratory mice found that the non-laboratory mice had more antigenexperienced CD8 \u00fe T cells than laboratory mice, commensurate with living in unsterile conditions 12 . Although these studies support the idea that wild and laboratory mice differ immunologically, the lack of an extensive, immune system-wide analysis of populations of wild mice tempers this conclusion. It therefore remains the case that the immune responses of wild mice are essentially unknown and thus that the validity of laboratory mice as a model immunological system is uncertain.",

Wild mice had proportionately more germinal centre B cells in their spleens than did laboratory mice and PNA binding was comparatively higher on all B-cell subsets in wild mice, consistent with recent activation 15 (Fig. 4d , Supplementary Table 2 ).

For most C57BL/6 laboratory mice, NK cells expressed Ly49D, Ly49G and Ly49H (Fig. 6e-h) with 5-45% of NK cells expressing each of the receptors, consistent with previous reports 18 . In contrast very few wild mice had any Ly49H \u00fe NK cells (10%, n \u00bc 125, Z1% of Ly49H \u00fe cells, Supplementary Data 1), suggesting that the gene encoding this receptor is rare in this wild mouse population or that allelic variation precludes recognition by the anti-Ly49H antibody. We genotyped mice at the Ly49h locus for a deletion that is associated with susceptibility to MCMV (ref. 17) , finding that 18% of the wild mice were homozygous for this deletion (95% confidence interval 9.5-30%, n \u00bc 98 mice from HW site; frequency of deletion allele 0.42 assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). This likely partially contributes to the scarcity of Ly49H \u00fe NK cells among wild mice, but raises questions about the presence of additional null alleles at the Ly49h locus, and whether other receptors can compensate for the lack of Ly49H in wild mice, especially given the high prevalence of MCMV in the wild mouse populations, reported to be 62 and 79% (refs 19,20) . The apparent absence of Ly49H among the wild mice may explain their much more frequent expression of the alternative activating receptor Ly49D and suggests that there may be important differences between wild and laboratory mice in the contributions of NK cells to functional immunity.",

Among wild mice most Ly49G2 \u00fe cells were Ly49G2 low , whereas in laboratory mice Ly49G2 high cells predominated. This suggests the presence of different alleles at the Ly49G2 coding locus in the wild and laboratory populations. Among laboratory mice, interstrain differences in Ly49G receptor expression have been linked to allelic variation in promoter activity 21 and may influence the threshold for NK cell activation 18 . These data support the idea that there is extensive, hitherto undocumented, allelic diversity among Ly49 receptors with likely important consequences for NK cell function in the wild. We wanted to understand the balance of expression of activating and inhibitory Ly49 receptors on NK cells, and so compared the proportions of NK cells expressing or not Ly49D and Ly49G2 (Fig. 6e) . Wild mice had significantly higher proportions of Ly49D \u00fe G \u00c0 cells than laboratory mice whereas laboratory mice had significantly higher proportions of Ly49D \u00c0 G \u00fe cells than wild mice ( Table 2 ), suggesting that NK cells of wild mice may have a lower threshold for activation, although this will be heavily influenced by MHC class I genotype and expression of other Ly49 receptors not assayed here. Together these results show that NK cells of wild mice can be, and are, much more readily activated than those of laboratory mice, which may be a necessary response to the high pathogen load of the wild environment.",

Of particular note, wild mice produced significantly less IL-12 (p40 and p70) and less IL-13 than laboratory mice in response to ARTICLE pathogen-related ligands and there was also a trend for IL-10 production to be lower in wild mice, although this was only significant at baseline. These comparatively depressed cytokine responses are in significant contrast to the highly activated cellular immune state of wild mice. We speculate that some form of innate immune tolerance may be operating to limit the degree of inflammation in chronically and highly pathogen-exposed wild mice. The only cytokine responses that were significantly higher in wild mice than in laboratory mice were the IFN-g, IL-4 and MIP-2a responses to anti-CD3/anti-CD28, which are consistent with the higher proportions of memory and effector T cells in wild mice. These results suggest that innate cytokine responses, and their functional effects, may need to be re-evaluated in laboratory mice.",

            "text": "Laboratory mice are the mainstay of experimental immunology and underpin work that has had a transformative effect on human and animal lives through vaccination and, more recently, immunotherapy. As the human population ages, understanding immune-mediated disease and immunosenescence is of ever increasing importance. For laboratory mice to be useful in understanding these processes, and for treatments and therapies to be effectively translated into human populations, we need to appreciate both the strengths and limitations of the model. Given that the ultimate purpose of the immune system is to provide protection from external environmental threats, the environment in which the immune system is studied is a priori likely to have profound effects on its response. The rationale for this work was therefore to understand the immune systems of mice in their natural environment. This uniquely extensive and detailed immune characterization of wild mice shows that their immune systems are highly activated and antigen-experienced, likely because wild mice are continuously exposed to high levels of environmental antigenic challenge, have high levels of infection and high cumulative exposure to infection over their, often remarkably short, lives. By complete contrast, innate immune function-as measured by cytokine secretion in response to pathogen-associated ligands-is remarkably similar between highly infected wild mice and pathogen-free laboratory mice and, where there are differences, the responses of wild mice are suppressed. We suggest that this suppression of the innate immune response in the wild mice is also driven by their very high levels of antigen exposure, as a homeostatic mechanism to prevent immune-mediated pathology. These observations somewhat go against the emerging concept of 'trained immunity' or 'innate immune memory'-that Our results also suggest that there may be much wider functional diversity in NK cells in wild mice than has hitherto been indicated by studies in laboratory mice. The status of the immune systems of wild and laboratory mice therefore appears very different. Our data are consistent with the immune systems of wild mice dynamically responding to a large and ever changing diversity of antigens: wild mice seem to be constantly immunologically multi-tasking. In contrast, laboratory mice are likely responding to a very limited antigenic repertoire, allowing greater immunological focus. A typical laboratory mouse experiment will introduce a single pathogen or antigen, often at a high dose and/or with an immune stimulating adjuvant, into an immunologically naive animal. The immune system this antigen encounters is in a largely antigen-inexperienced state, likely acting at baseline cellular turnover rates. In contrast, the same pathogen or antigen in a wild mouse would encounter an immune system that is already highly active and responding to many other antigens. The different states of the immune systems of wild and laboratory mice are therefore predicted to quantitatively and/or qualitatively alter the response to any given antigen. Further, in wild mice, there will be considerable inter-individual differences in these responses. Studies with laboratory mice therefore show what immune responses are possible, but these are not necessarily the immune responses that will actually occur in the real world. The immune response observed in a laboratory mouse is thus just one example of the myriad immune responses that can be generated by outbred, free-living individuals. Considerable caution should therefore be exercised in extrapolating results from laboratory mice to free-living animals and human populations. The research resource we provide here will allow results obtained in laboratory mice to be better contextualized, facilitating the translation of laboratory-based studies to real-world populations.",

It is likely that selection of laboratory mice for a range of life-history traits (such as rapid growth and reproduction, and docility) has resulted in alteration of a range of traits, including immunological traits. This makes the important point that animals' immune responses need to be considered as one aspect of their wider range of life-history traits, and truly understanding wild animals' immune responses therefore needs to be embedded within the wider context of their life-history biology.",

This resulted in the selection of nine highly informative analytes comprising IL-1b, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IFN-g and MIP-2a (Fig. 7) .
