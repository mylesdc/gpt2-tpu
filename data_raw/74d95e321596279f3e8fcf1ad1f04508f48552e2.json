[6] [7] [8] PCT and biomarkers are debated for the usefulness and clinical application, but the previous literatures revealed that PCT could support the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients. Among these biomarkers, PCT and CRP were included in the diagnostic criteria of inflammatory variables in Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2013. 9 However, in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2016, PCT was revised to be a recommended biomarker for sepsis prognosis but not for diagnosis. 10 Both diagnosis and prognosis are important in sepsis, and several biomarkers including PCT, sTREM-1, presepsin, and cytokines have been studied for predicting prognosis under former definition of sepsis. 7, [11] [12] [13] [14] In addition, PCT is related to antimicrobial stewardship, a treatment that encompasses initiation and tapering of antimicrobial treatment. 15, 16 The biomarkers evaluated for previously defined severe sepsis might not reflect the performance in revised sepsis due to differences in the details of definitions. In addition, diagnosis of sepsis was revised suing SOFA score, which requires three clinical variables and three laboratory variables, leading to a score range from zero to 24 . We hypothesized that the PCT, CRP, WBC, and ESR might result in capabilities to diagnose sepsis and reflect prognosis. Diagnostic capability of biomarkers could be evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) value, and prognostic capability of biomarkers could be evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated accessible biomarkers including PCT, CRP, ESR, and WBC in the clinical setting for their utility in the diagnosis and prognosis of revised sepsis.",

A total of 248 patients were enrolled from 124 male and 124 female, respectively. After the patients were admitted to Emergency Department, routine venous blood sampling was performed before administration of therapeutics. Suspected infection was defined as clinical assessment of signs and symptoms, laboratory and radiologic results, concomitant administration of oral or parenteral antibiotics, and sampling of body fluid cultures including blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and peritoneal fluid. 5,17 Patients were excluded from the study if they had evidence of an immunocompromised state (eg, malignancy) or of a viral infection including respiratory virus or hepatitis virus. Hepatitis A viral infection was excluded if anti-HAV antibody was negative. Acute hepatitis B viral infection was excluded if HBsAg, anti-HBc antibody, and HBeAg were negative. Chronic Hepatitis B viral infection was excluded if duration of HBsAg positivity was <6 months. Hepatitis C viral infection was excluded if anti-HCV was negative. Respiratory virus infection was excluded if the interpretation of radiologic study was negative or 14 kinds of multiplex virus PCR (influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza 1,2,3, respiratory syncytial virus A, B, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, three kinds of coronavirus and bocavirus) were negative. 18,19 Demographic data and baseline characteristics of patients were collected at the time of admission.",

            "text": "Under the revised definition of sepsis, our data on the diagnostic performance of PCT yielded an AUROC of 0.682, which was slightly lower than expected compared with the literature. One of the possible reasons for the low AUROC could be a control group. As control group used in this study also had bacterial infection without sepsis, this group also showed increased PCT level of 3.2 ng/mL and 36 out of 63 cases had definite bacterial infection. These 36 cases of definite bacterial infection proven by culture might have been classified as a sepsis based on the previous sepsis definition. If healthy control groups or systemic inflammatory response syndrome group were recruited as a control group, the AUROC might be been increased. As PCT is expected to reflect a bacterial infection with or without organ dysfunction, further studies are required for the diagnostic performance of PCT under revised sepsis definition. Other biomarker that specifically reflects organ dysfunction might be required for accurate sepsis diagnosis.Unlike diagnostic performance, the prognostic performance of PCT was better than expected and the odd ratio of PCT (log scale) was 2.004 (95 CI, 1.240-3.238), which was higher than SOFA score and demographic parameters. The probability of unfavorable prognosis increased associated with higher PCT concentration. These results were in line with previous data that the PCT predicted prognosis of sepsis patients.30 Further studies are required for prognostic utility of PCT based on new definition.There was no statistical difference between the non-survivor and survivor group for CRP, ESR, and WBC. Lower hemoglobin level in non-survivor group implies that oxygenation or oxygen supply is associated with survival or underlying chronic disease might have affected the survival. Although age was higher in sepsis group, relatively small sample size might have resulted in statistical insignificance. Higher PCT concentration in non-survivor group is related to unfavorable prognosis that was in line with multivariate model in this study.",
