We report herein that gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT), a lysosomeassociated ISG, restricts the infectious entry of selected enveloped RNA viruses. Specifically, we demonstrated that GILT was constitutively expressed in lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts and its expression could be further induced by type II interferon. While overexpression of GILT inhibited the entry mediated by envelope glycoproteins of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV) and Lassa fever virus (LASV), depletion of GILT enhanced the entry mediated by these viral envelope glycoproteins. Furthermore, mutations that impaired the thiol reductase activity or disrupted the N-linked glycosylation, a posttranslational modification essential for its lysosomal localization, largely compromised GILT restriction of viral entry. We also found that the induction of GILT expression reduced the level and activity of cathepsin L, which is required for the entry of these RNA viruses in lysosomes. Our data indicate that GILT is a novel antiviral ISG that specifically inhibits the entry of selected enveloped RNA viruses in lysosomes via disruption of cathepsin L metabolism and function and may play a role in immune control and pathogenesis of these viruses.",

Many ISGs are cellintrinsic restriction factors that are constitutively expressed in barrier cells such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells and macrophages and restrain viral infection by directly targeting various stages of virus life cycle [7] . So far, several ISGs, including interferoninduced transmembrane proteins (IFITM), cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H), ArfGAP with dual pleckstrin homology domains 2 (ADAP2) and a short isoform of nuclear receptor coactivator 7 (NCOA7) have been identified to block the viral entry by inhibiting virus-host cell membrane fusion or endocytic trafficking of internalized virions [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Some other ISGs target post-entry steps of viral life cycle, as exemplified by TRIM5\u03b1 and Mx that block the nucleocapsid uncoating, RNase L and ISG20 that degrade viral RNA, PKR that inhibits viral protein translation, BST2 and Viperin that inhibit virion assembly or budding (reviewed in [7] ). Although the critical role of these antiviral ISGs in control of viral infections has been demonstrated in animal models and human diseases [14] , the roles and mechanisms of many other ISGs in controlling virus infections remain to be determined.",

Upon translation, GILT is sorted by mannose 6-phosphate receptor pathway to endocytic compartments and finally transported into the lysosome that provides optimal low pH for its thiol reductase activity [16, 17] . As the only thiol reductase in endolysosomes and phagosomes, GILT contributes to the degradation of lysosomal protease cathepsin, maintenance of cellular normal redox state and prohibition of aberrant autophagy [18] [19] [20] [21] . GILT utilizes two cysteine residues in the CXXC reductase motif to reduce the disulphide bond of endocytosed antigens to facilitate antigen processing and presentation by MHC II and MHC-I [16, 17, [22] [23] [24] . Hence, GILT has been demonstrated to play an essential role in the cross-priming of viral-specific T-cell response [22] . However, its role in intrinsic and innate antiviral immunity has not been explored.",

While Vesicular stomatitis virus and HCV enter host cells via Rab5 + early endosome, many flavivirus and influenza A virus invade cells through Rab7 + late endosome (reviewed in [25] ). Notably, SARS-CoV and EBOV are transported to lysosomes to fulfil infectious entry [26] . Given that GILT plays a crucial role in unfolding internalized viral glycoproteins and affecting the environment in the lysosome [22, 27] , an cellular compartment utilized by SARS-CoV, EBOV and many other viruses to invade into the cytoplasm of host cells and initiate viral replication [26, [28] [29] [30] , it is conceivable that GILT may affect the infectious entry of this group of viruses. In this study, we demonstrated that GILT is constitutively expressed in lung epithelial cells and restricts the entry mediated by envelope glycoproteins (GP) from SARS-CoV, EBOV and LASV. We also found that mutations altering two cysteine residues in CXXC motif or abrogating N-linked glycosylation impaired GILT-mediated restriction, implying that lysosomal localization and thiol reductase function are essential for GILT to inhibit the entry of these viruses. Our study thus revealed an important role of GILT in the control and pathogenesis of selected RNA virus infections.",

To test this hypothesis, we established FLP-IN T Rex 293 cell line that expresses human GILT in a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible manner and determined its effects on the entry mediated by envelope GP from a panel of enveloped viruses, including five human coronaviruses (HCoVs), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1 and murine leukaemia viruses (MLV). Tet treatment efficiently induced GILT expression, as judged by Western blot ( Figure  2A ) and immunofluorescence staining assays ( Figure  2B ). Interestingly, only the infection by lentiviral particles pseudotyped with spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARSpp) was significantly inhibited by GILT expression ( Figure 2C ). Considering that GILT is mainly localized in lysosomes and the SARS-CoV enters into the cytoplasm of host cells via lysosomes [26], we speculated that GILT may not restrain the viral entry that occurs at plasma membrane or early/late endosomes, but only impede the virus entry in lysosome. We thus further examined whether GILT could inhibit the entry of EBOV and LASV that enter cells in lysosomes [29, 39, 40] . To this end, A459 cells stably expressing ACE2, the receptor of SARS-CoV, were transduced with retroviruses expressing GILT or empty retrovector pQCXIP as a control, respectively. The expression of GILT in transduced A549 cells was at a level comparable to that induced by IFN-\u03b3 treatment ( Figure 2D ). As shown in Figure 2 (E), both IFN-\u03b3 treatment and expression of GILT in A549 cells significantly inhibited the infection by Blam-Vpr lentiviral particles pseudotyped with envelope glycoprotein from EBOV, LASV and SARS-CoV. However, while IFN-\u03b3 treatment significantly inhibited Blam-Vpr lentiviral particles pseudotyped with IAV hemagglutinin 1 (H1) and neuraminidase (N1), expression of GILT did not, suggesting that other ISG(s) mediate IFN-\u03b3 suppression of IAV entry.",

The genome sequencing analyses revealed that the gene of ifi30 was ablated in the different clones of GILT/KO THP-1 cells ( Figure 3C ). Moreover, a high level of GILT expression was observed in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells, while the GILT expression is abolished in GILT/KO THP-1 cells ( Figure 3D ).

To investigate whether N-glycosylation is required for GILT lysosome localization and antiviral function, three asparagine residues (N63, N95 and N108) of GILT were substituted by alanine individually or in combination ( Figure 4A ). Our results showed that the single alanine substitution of the three asparagine residues and their combined mutation (N3A) increased GILT migration by electrophoresis due to its impaired glycosylation and reduced the steady-state levels of GILT protein ( Figure 4B ). Compared to wild-type GILT, the mutant GILT protein exhibited impaired or lost activity to restrict the entry of SARS-CoVpp, EBOVpp and LASVpp ( Figure 4C ). Consistent with previous reports, wild-type GILT was observed in the perinuclear compartment and mainly co-localized with LAMP1. As anticipated, single mutation of glycosylation sites (N63A, N95A and N108A) partially reduced the co-localization of GILT with LAMP1, and triple mutation of glycosylation sites on GILT (3NA) completely abolished its co-localization with LAMP1 ( Figure 5 ). These results collectively indicate that N-glycosylation of GILT is crucial for its lysosomal localization, which is essential for GILT to impede the viral entry occurring in lysosomes.",

Because induction of GILT expression did not alter the levels of cathepsin L mRNA (data no shown), GILT might destabilize cathepsin L in a thiol reductase-dependent manner. In addition, GILT also reduced proteolytic activity of cathepsins L and S ( Figure 6E ). Since cathepsins L is an essential factor for the infectious entry of SARS-CoV and EBOV [42] [43] [44] , our results thus imply that GILT inhibition of the cellular entry of SARS-CoV and EBOV is most likely by modulating the stability and enzymatic activity of lysosomal proteases, such as cathepsin L.

            "text": "As key antiviral cytokines, IFNs inhibit viral replication by inducing the expression of hundreds of ISGs that disrupt distinct steps of viral replication. Enveloped viruses enter cells by fusion with the plasma membrane or the membrane of endocytic vesicles and lysosomes. Thus far, several ISGs had been identified to modulate the entry of different viruses by altering the endocytic trafficking or membrane fusion. Our studies reported herein showed that GILT is a new ISG that restricts GILT, an IFN-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase, which reduces the disulphide bonds in internalized viral glycoproteins to facilitate their unfolding or processing and regulates the function of cathepsins in lysosomes, might affect the infection by certain viruses whose entry occur in lysosomes. Indeed, our studies revealed a unique profile of viruses that is susceptible to GILT-mediated restriction. GILT only inhibited the cellular entry of viruses including SARS-CoV, EBOV and LASV, which enter host cells via NPC1positive lysosome (Figure 2) . In contrast, other tested viruses such as MLV, VSV, IAV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV, whose entry occur through cell surface, early endosome and late endosome, are refractory to GILT-mediated restriction ( Figure 2 ). It is likely that GILT impedes viral entry in lysosome where the enzyme has the optimal activity of thiol reductase at low pH (pH = 4.5). In support of this scenario, our mutagenesis study demonstrated that the mutations altering the CXXC reductase motif or abrogating N-linked glycosylation, which is required for GILT lysosomal localization and optimal reductase activity, largely compromised GILT-mediated restriction of viral entry driven by GP proteins from SARS- CoV, EBOV and LASV (Figures 4 and 5) . Of note, GILT might interfere cathepsin L metabolism and function to inhibit viral entry in lysosomes, which also relies on its thiol reductase ( Figure 6 ). More importantly, trypsin treatment of SARS coronavirus activated the pseudovirions to directly fuse at the plasma membrane and circumvented GILT-mediated restriction (Figure 7) . These data collectively indicated that GILT-mediated restriction of viral entry correlates with viral entry site and GILT optimal enzyme activity in the lysosome (Figure 8) .",

            "text": "Diverse biological functions of GILT have been uncovered since this enzyme was identified. GILT contributes to T-cell development, modulates tolerance and autoimmunity, and improves cancer survival (reviewed in [27, 38] ). Importantly, GILT also has a critical role in microorganism infection. GILT plays a crucial role in antigen presentation by facilitating the unfolding of disulphide-rich viral glycoproteins to prime virus-specific T-cell activation in adaptive immunity [22] . Moreover, GILT functions as a host factor essential for Listeria monocytogenes infection by facilitating the phagolysosome escape through the reduction of bacterial hemolysins [46] . Furthermore, GILT inhibits dengue virus translation and replication by diminishing virus-induced autophagy [21] . In our study, we demonstrated that GILT is a critical restriction factor inhibiting viral entry of several pathogenic viruses. GILT is expressed in lung epithelial cells, a primary infection site of SARS-CoV. More importantly, a high level of GILT is expressed constitutively in macrophage, the primary target cells for filovirus replication. The knockout of GILT in THP-1 cells confers the cells higher susceptibility to EBOV and LASV GP-driven infection than parental THP-1 cells (Figure 3 ). These findings suggest that GILT may play an important role in restricting the infection by EBOV and LASV, although this finding should be validated with an authentic virus infection. Interestingly, it was reported previously that GILT restricted human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) entry in a thiol reductase-dependent manner [47] . Because HIV-1 enters host cells at the plasma membrane or early endosome [48] , it is very interesting to know how GILT restricts HIV-1 entry at those subcellular compartments. However, our preliminary studies indicated that expression of GILT did not inhibit the infection of GHOST cells, a cell line derived from human bone osteosarcoma, by HIV-1 strains utilizing either CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptor (data not shown). Obviously, further studies are under way to investigate the discrepancy.",

Relative infection represents the ratio of luciferase activity in cells treated with tetracycline over that in cells cultured without tetracycline.

(D) The intracellular expression of GILT in A549 cell lines stably transduced with GILT or empty vector (pQCXIP) treated with IFN-\u03b3 at indicated concentration for 12 h was determined by a Western blot assay. (E) The entry mediated by GP proteins from SARS-CoV, EBOV, LASV and H1N1 in IFN-\u03b3-treated A549 cells was determined by using the BlaM-Vpr assay. Cells were analysed by flow cytometry 24 h after infection and infectivity was determined by measuring cleaved CCF2 (Blue) from uncleaved CCF2 (Green). Relative infection efficiency was calculated by setting the infection of empty vector (pQCXIP) to 1.0.
