In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of galloyl-hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP)-glucose isolated from pomegranate leaves on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. Male BALB/c mice were treated with different doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose (5, 50, and 100 mg/Kg) or dexamethasone at 5 mg/Kg (per os) 6 h after intra-tracheal instillation of LPS. Vehicle-treated mice were used as controls. Twenty-four hours after LPS challenge, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung samples were collected for analyses. They were evaluated by monitoring the expression of NF-\u03baB, JNK, and cytokine genes and proteins, as well as cell migration and lung function. All doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose inhibited LPS-induced JNK and NF-\u03baB activation. Likewise, the galloyl-HHDP-glucose-treated animals presented reduced expression of the TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 genes in the lungs and reduced TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 protein levels when compared with the vehicle-treated LPS-challenged mice. In addition, the ALI mice treated with galloyl-HHDP-glucose also presented reduced lung inflammatory cell accumulation, especially that of neutrophils, in their BALF and lungs.

Vehicle-treated mice were used as controls. Twenty-four hours after LPS challenge, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung samples were collected for analyses. They were evaluated by monitoring the expression of NF-\u03baB, JNK, and cytokine genes and proteins, as well as cell migration and lung function. All doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose inhibited LPS-induced JNK and NF-\u03baB activation. Likewise, the galloyl-HHDP-glucose-treated animals presented reduced expression of the TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 genes in the lungs and reduced TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 protein levels when compared with the vehicle-treated LPS-challenged mice. In addition, the ALI mice treated with galloyl-HHDP-glucose also presented reduced lung inflammatory cell accumulation, especially that of neutrophils, in their BALF and lungs. In addition, galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatment markedly ameliorated the LPS-induced pulmonary mechanism complications and attenuated weight loss. Overall, we showed for the first time that galloyl-HHDP-glucose protects against ALI, and may be useful for treating ALI and other inflammatory disorders.",

Acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in mice is a well-accepted model for investigating ARDS because it mimics the inflammatory and histological changes observed in this disease. In this model, LPS stimulates alveolar macrophages via the TLR4/CD14/MD2 complex and the MyD88-dependent response, and activates nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) that regulate the secretion of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines (e.g., IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) (3). The secreted inflammatory mediators then trigger neutrophil infiltration into alveolar space (4). This intense inflammatory response is associated with ARDS exacerbation (5) . Despite the advances in ARDS diagnosis and treatment in the last 5 years, treatment options are limited and no pharmacology treatments aimed at the underlying pathology have proven effective.",

The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% bis-acrylamide). Protein electrotransfer of proteins from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) was performed for 90 min at 15 V (constant). Non-specific protein binding to nitrocellulose was reduced by preincubating the membrane overnight at 4 \u2022 C in blocking buffer (5% milk/Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20).

LPS stimulates acute inflammation through the activation of lungresident macrophages, which in turn activate intracellular mediators (17) . The transcription factor NF-\u03baB regulates innate and adaptive immune functions, and serves as a pivotal mediator of inflammatory responses (3) . We observed that galloyl-HHDP-glucose blocked the activation of NF-\u03baB, thus, regulating lung inflammation. LPS-activated macrophages induces a phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB developing a proinflammatory profile by gene expressing and releasing cytokines as observed in animals with ALI (18) . IKB (inhibitor of Kinase B) is a key factor in NF-\u03baB activation (19) . Moreover, the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) is one of the IKK activators by different stimulis such as TLRs, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, and others (19) . Three main MAPKinase pathways have been described in mammalian cells: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the JNK pathway and the p38 MAPK pathway (20) . JNK is activated in lung tissue of ARDS mice and its inhibition by specific inhibitors may significantly improve the pulmonary histopathology and lung permeability in rats (21) . Reinforcing the importance of JNK in the modulation of inflammation in ALI, we showed that LPS activates JNK in lung and Galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatment is able to inhibits lung JNK phosphorylation similar to dexamethasone.",

Therefore, to further evaluate the effects of galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatment in lung inflammation, we measured the inflammatory markers TNF-\u03b1, IL1-\u03b2, IL-8, and IL-6. The LPS-induced increase in the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines was significantly reduced by galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatment. In a previous study, the hydroalcoholic extract of pomegranate leaves reduced TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression in peritoneal leukocytes obtained from rats FIGURE 7 | Efficacy of galloyl-HHDP-glucose treatments in reducing respiratory system and lung tissue elastance in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mice.

The mice received different doses of galloyl-HHDP-glucose (5, 50, and 100 mg/kg) 6 h after intra-tracheal instillation of LPS. The values are presented as mean and SD. Significances were calculated by One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey test.

Galloyl-HHDP-glucose may be one of the compounds related to the anti-inflammatory effects previously observed in treatment with the hydroalcoholic extract and ethyl acetate fraction of pomegranate.",

However, variations in intensity are mainly associated with lung dysfunction caused by an intense inflammatory response (23) . Hence, inflammation-modulating molecules are widely employed in the treatment of ARDS patients (1) . In this study, we observed that galloyl-HHDP-glucose suppresses lung inflammation in the airways of mice intratracheally challenged with LPS. Moreover, this treatment attenuated the loss of weight induced by LPS suggesting that this treatment not only improve lung function but also reduced the systemic effects of LPS instillation. We showed the main therapeutic effect exhibited by Galloyl-HHDP-glucose was to reduce the cytokine production by suppressing NF-\u03baB and MAPKinase activation; these results strongly suggest that Galloyl-HHDP-glucose possesses potent anti-inflammatory actions in the lungs. Thus, we suggest that Galloyl-HHDP-glucose impairs the generation of these inflammatory mediators by interfering with these signaling pathways in leukocytes.",
