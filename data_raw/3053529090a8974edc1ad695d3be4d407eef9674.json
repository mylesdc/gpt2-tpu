We then generated recombinant MUPs (rMUPs) and found that the sexual attractiveness of urine from castrated males to females significantly increased after the addition of either recombinant OBP3 (rOBP3) or recombinant MUP13 (rMUP13). Using c-Fos immunohistochemistry, we further examined neuronal activation in the brains of female rats after they sniffed rOBP3 or rMUP13. Both rOBP3 and rMUP13 activated the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), medial preoptic area (MPA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), medial amygdala (MeA), posteromedial cortical amygdala (PMCo) and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH), which participate in the neural circuits responsible for pheromone-induced sexual behaviours. In particular, more c-Fos-immunopositive (c-Fos-ir) cells were observed in the posterior AOB than in the anterior AOB. Conclusions: The expression of OBP3 and MUP13 was male-biased and androgen-dependent. They attracted females and activated brain areas related to sexual behaviours in female rats, suggesting that both OBP3 and MUP13 are male pheromones in rats. Particularly, an OBP excreted into urine was exemplified to be a chemical signal.",

            "text": "Pheromones play a crucial role in mediating socio-sexual interactions between conspecific members in rodents [1, 2] . In mice, pheromone components comprise both volatile organic compounds and non-volatile proteins, such as exocrine gland-secreted peptide 1 (ESP1) secreted by tear glands [3] and darcin (MUP20), a member of the major urinary proteins (MUPs) [4] . MUPs are low-molecularweight (approximately 19 kDa) members of the large lipocalin family and are produced by the liver, filtered by the kidneys and secreted into the urine in some rodent species, such as mice and rats [5] . In rats, MUPs are also referred to as alpha-2u globulin (i.e. \u03b1 2U-globulins) [6] . MUPs are highly polymorphic and encoded by at least 21 MUP genes on chromosome 4 in mice and approximately 9 genes and 13 pseudogenes on chromosome 5 in rats [7, 8] . MUPs are usually more prevalent in males than in females in rodents, implying a male-biased trait [9] . Rodents use voided urine to extensively mark their territories for chemosensory communication [10] . The MUPs in the deposited urine bind to and slow the release of volatile compounds, which is critical for the longevity of scent marks [11] [12] [13] . However, MUPs themselves function as chemosignals to convey socio-sexual information for conspecific receivers and thus regulate socio-sexual interactions. These two roles of MUPs are both related to urine-mediated chemical communication [1] .",

Sex pheromones are released by animals to elicit a sexual interaction with a member of the other sex of the same species and particularly mediate female mate choice for male mates in rodents [14, 15] . The identification of male pheromones has been a major focus of studies of sexual selection for many years. Currently, a few organic volatile compounds have been chemically characterized from mouse and rat urine and preputial glands and identified to be male pheromone components [12, 14, 16, 17] . Several MUPs have been characterized from male urine in mice, and some of them have been demonstrated to promote male-male territorial aggression, female attraction, conditioned place preference, or play a role in signaling individual identity [4, [18] [19] [20] . In rats, about 13 MUPs have been found in urine, including OBP3 (PGCL4), MUP13 (PGCL1), and PGCL2 [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Since the genes of the MUP family share high sequence homology, the purification of MUPs from urine and expression of a single specific protein in vitro is difficult [26] , and the role in intraspecific communication of each MUP isoform in male urine, is rarely experimentally verified in rats [25, 27] .",

Male pheromone components partially or completely restore the sexual attractiveness of castrated male urine to female rodents [14, 16, 17, 28] . Male pheromones are primarily received by females via the vomeronasal organ (VNO), which then sends neuronal signals to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). The AOB directly targets higher centres in the brain, including the medial amygdala (MeA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH), to process the sensory information [3] . The hypothalamus acts as a major source of neuroendocrine hormones that influence reproductive behaviour, and the activation of the hypothalamus by male pheromones arouses female sexual behaviour [2] . In the VNO, vomeronasal type 1 receptors (V1Rs) are specifically expressed in the apical cell layer projecting to the anterior portion of the AOB (aAOB) and are responsible for receiving signals from volatile pheromones; vomeronasal type 2 receptors (V2Rs) are mostly expressed in the basal region projecting to the posterior portion of AOB (pAOB) and receive signals from non-volatile pheromones, such as ESP1 and MUPs [29] [30] [31] .",

Researchers have not directly shown which single MUP isolated from rat MUPs may act as a male pheromone candidate, although a few MUPs that have been purified from urine are sexually dimorphic and positively correlated with quality, sexual attractiveness and copulatory opportunities in male rats [27, 32] . Among rat MUPs, MUP13 (also referred to as alpha-2u globulin PGCL1, UniProtKB accession number: P02761) has been isolated from rat urine and confirmed to be a kairomone, inducing fear reactions in mice [25] . OBP3 (odorant-binding protein 3, also referred to as alpha-2u globulin PGCL4, UniProtKB accession number: Q78E14), is named due to its nasal expression and odorant-binding characteristics, and has been demonstrated to be a member of the MUP family by sequence comparison [33] . Questions were raised about whether MUP13 and OBP3 function as male pheromones for conspecific communication in rats.",

The rMUPs had clean bands of approximately 20 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5a) , suggesting similar molecular weight to the native MUPs, and exhibited high sequence coverage by LC-MS/MS (83.24% for rOBP3, Fig. 5b for rMUP13, Fig. 5c ), which was sufficient to confirm the expression of correct proteins. Two-way choice tests revealed that females spent more time investigating the urine from males in the shamoperated control group than from males in the castrated group (P = 0.001, t = 4.852, n = 12, paired t-test). According to the IEF results, urine from intact males contained approximately 0.92 mg/mL OBP3 and 0.23 mg/mL MUP13. When rOBP3 or rMUP13 was added to urine from castrated males at the same physiological level observed in intact males, female rats showed greater attraction to treated than untreated urine from castrated males (rOBP3, P = 0.006, t = 3.434; rMUP13, P = 0.006, t = 3.366; n = 12, paired t-test).

Sexual dimorphism was also observed for total MUPs and darcin in mice [4, 39] . However, total MUP levels were more than ten-fold higher in males than in females in the present study, consistent with previous findings that the dichotomy is much more pronounced in rats than in mice [40, 41] . Serum testosterone exerts a stimulatory effect on MUPs, indicating that male-biased MUPs might be regulated by male hormones [36, 38] . Therefore, rat MUPs have the necessary features of chemicals used as male pheromones in rodents [15, 28] . We selected three predominant protein bands from IEF for identification by nLC-MS/MS. The three proteins were putatively identified as MUP13, Alpha-2u globulin PGCL2 and OBP3. These proteins have also been found in the voided urine of Sprague-Dawley rats, Wistar rats and wild rats [21] [22] [23] [24] 42] . Considering the possible technical difficulties in isolating MUP members and acquiring a single specific MUP [26] , we first investigated OBP3 and MUP13, for which purification has been reported [25, 33] . We generated rMUP13 and rOBP3 according to previous studies [25, 33] , and studied their biological functions. The sequencing results of the clones confirmed that the genes we amplified were mup13 and obp3. The identities of the two recombinant proteins were further confirmed by LC-MS-MS assay.",

IEF resolves proteins that differ in their pI values by as little as 0.01. Some studies have efficiently separated MUPs and characterized MUPs related to kinship and individual recognition in mice using IEF [10, 34] castrated and castrated + rOBP3-treated or castrated + rMUP13-treated males, sham-operated and castrated + rOBP3-treated or castrated + rMUP13-treated males and castrated + rMUP13-treated males and castrated + rOBP3-treated males (n = 12 for each group, mean \u00b1 SE, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05, Paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test) flight/time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry in outbred Wistar rats [21] , and a unique malespecific MUP resolved by narrowed-range IEF was also characterized by MS/ MS in mouse urine [44] . Inbred Lewis rats may express fewer MUP isoforms than outbred Wistar rats, and thus, IEF is more manageable for separating MUPs from Lewis rats [45] . Although more than one MUP is contained in a single band/spot on a 2-DE gel [21] , a greater number of specific unique peptides with high sequence coverage are contributed by the most abundant proteins [46] and are used for MS-based quantification to successfully identify proteins [26, 47] . In our study, the considerable sequence coverage of the matching peptides (82.32%, 78.45% and 75.98% for MUP13, Alpha-2u globulin PGCL2 and OBP3, respectively) was sufficient to demonstrate that these three bands in IEF were the predominant MUPs. Female preferences for synthetic analogues of putative male pheromones in two-way choice tests are often utilized for the experimental verification of the sexual attractiveness and identity of male pheromones [4, 14, 17] . Volatile male mouse pheromones, such as farnesenes, hexadecanol acetate and hexadecanol, and non-volatile male mouse pheromones, including ESP1 and darcin, and volatile male rat pheromones, such as 4-heptanone, 2heptanone and 9-hydroxy-2-nonanone, were previously a d e b c Fig. 7 Male urine treated with rOBP3 induced c-Fos expression in females. The c-Fos-ir cells were distributed in the AOB (a) and higher brain areas (d). (b), (c) and (e) showed the statistical analyses of the number of c-Fos-ir cells in different brain regions (n = 6, mean \u00b1 SE, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05, independent-sample t-test for five brain areas, AOB, aAOB and pAOB between the PBS-treated control and experimental groups; paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test for aAOB and pAOB in PBS-treated control or experimental rats. Scale bars = 25 \u03bcm) identified using this methodology [3, 4, 14, 17, 28, 48 ]. In the current study, female rats exhibited consistent chemosensory preferences for MUP-enriched urine from males compared with that from castrated males; female rats also exhibited a preference for urine from androgen-treated castrated males compared with that from castrated males. In particular, the urine from castrated males supplemented with rMUP13 or rOBP3 showed the same attractiveness to females as urine from intact males, suggesting that both MUP13 and OBP3 in male urine aroused female attraction and were male pheromones. Besides Lewis, we have also found in Sprague-Dawley and wild-captured rats that the MUP13 and OBP3 exhibited male-biased sexual dimorphism and were associated with sexual attractiveness to female rats (unpublished data), suggesting MUP13 and OBP3 identified in Lewis male rats might be common male pheromones across strains or populations of rats.",

They are highly expressed in male liver and the submaxillary, lachrymal, preputial glands in both sexes and also expressed in female mammary glands [53, 54] . In rats, the mRNA of mup13 is expressed in liver, preputial gland, and spleen, and the mRNA of obp3 was found in liver, salivary gland, submaxillary gland and nasal cavity [5] . MUPs enter urine via hepatic biosynthesis [37] . The hepatic expression of rat MUPs is under regulation of multiple hormone, and the hepatic expression is sex-dependent and under developmental control [32, 38, [55] [56] [57] . In the present study, the hepatic mRNA levels of both mup13 and obp3 are decreased by castration, consistent with previous findings that castration decreases the synthesis of MUPs, and the hormonal control of MUPs synthesis is associated with hepatic mRNA level [36, 38] . However, obp3, but not mup13, was significantly higher in T-treated group than in sham-operated control group, suggesting that the expressions of obp3 was slightly different from mup13 in response to testosterone. The mRNA of obp3, as well as the volatile pheromones which we reported in previous work, was overexpressed in T-treated group [14] . The total testosterone levels in serum were measured, and no significant difference was found between sham-operated control and T-treated group (1.03 \u00b1 0.18 ng/ml vs. 0.85 \u00b1 0.07 ng/ml, mean \u00b1 standard error, n = 7 for each group).

Moreover, small individual variations were found within inbred Lewis males, possibly due to spontaneous mutations, stochastic and environmental events or epigenetic changes as we have evidenced for the quantitative changes of volatile pheromones among inbred C57BL/6 mice [58] [59] [60] . Previous studies on rat urinary MUPs were carried out mainly with Wistar, Sprague-Dawley and Lewis strains of rats [21] [22] [23] [24] .

The eluted peptides were electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer, and raw MS data were acquired in the data-dependent acquisition mode. The Proteome Discoverer software system (version 1.4.0.288; Thermo Scientific, USA) was used to analyse the raw data and score peptides for identification. A search of the MS/MS data against the Rattus norvegicus database (SwissProt, 2012) was performed using the built-in Sequest-HT search engine. The mass deviation of the precursor ion, the fragment ion tolerance and the false discovery rate were set to 10 ppm, 0.05 Da and 0.01, respectively. The minimal peptide length was 6 amino acids, and two missed trypsin cleavage sites were allowed. The acrylamide modification of cysteines and methionine oxidation were set as fixed and dynamic modifications, respectively. When the search results were filtered, the matching proteins with a high peptide confidence for at least one unique peptide were considered significant [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] . The pIs of the identified proteins were calculated using ExPASy-Compute pI/Mw (https://web. expasy.org/compute_pi/), and DANMAN software (version 6.0, Lynnon Biosoft, USA) was used to align the protein sequences.

Then, qRT-PCR was conducted with the SYBR Green SuperReal PreMix Plus Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) and Mx3000P quantitative PCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Specific oligonucleotide primers were designed using the NCBI-Primer-BLAST online tool (https:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/index.cgi?LINK_-LOC=BlastHome), and Gapdh was chosen as a control gene. The primers were designed as follows: Mup13-F: 5\u2032-GGGAACCT CGATGTGGCTAA-3\u2032, Mup13-R: 5'-GCAC TCTCCATTTTCCTTAATACG-3\u2032, Obp3-F: 5\u2032-GT TGCC GACAAAACAGCAAAG-3\u2032, Obp3-R: 5\u2032-AAGGATGAAG AAATAGAT CTTGCCC-3\u2032 and Gapdh-F: 5'-GACAATG AATATGGCTACA GCAAC-3\u2032, Gapdh-R: 5\u2032-TTTATTG ATG GTATTCGAGAGAAGG-3\u2032.

The positive clones were selected and sequenced using the universal primers (T7 promoter and T7 terminator primer). Analysis of the clone sequences was performed by NCBI BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

One female subject was left in the home cage while its cage mates were temporarily moved to another clean rat cage. Each subject was allowed a 15 min acclimation period prior to a trial and was used once every 4 days in a balanced order. Urine samples from 7 individuals were mixed equally for each group. The mixed samples were used to prepare scent stimuli, and rOBP3 and rMUP13 were added to urine from castrated males at the same levels observed in intact males. We painted a 2-\u03bcL scent sample on one end of the glass rod (20 cm long, 4 mm diameter) and held the other end with plastic gloves. Two glass rods painted with different scent samples were simultaneously poked through the lid of the cage in the centre of the cage and were located 1.5 cm from each other to allow the subject to freely investigate each sample. The investigation time was recorded for 3 min after the subject started to sniff or lick the rod.",
