The familial clustering of human A(H5N1) infection among blood relatives argued for a possible genetic susceptibility to the infection 12 . Furthermore, accumulating evidence demonstrated that human genetic polymorphisms contribute to the outcome and disease severity of influenza infection. We and others have demonstrated that genetic polymorphisms of IFITM3, SFTPB and CD55 gene may contribute to the disease severity of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza [13] [14] [15] . The same variant, rs12252 of IFITM3, was associated with disease progression of human H7N9 infection 16 . However, the comprehensive understanding of genetic susceptibility to novel A(H7N9) infection remained largely elusive.",

            "text": "Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been widely utilized to uncover the genetic basis of human diseases. However, compared to other prevalent diseases, the relative small number of human A(H7N9) influenza cases posed a considerable difficulty to the study of genetic susceptibility to the infection. With a total of less than 400 cases of human A(H7N9) infection when we started the study, we managed to obtain the genomic DNA samples of 102 Chinese patients from Southern China. With a sample size at this level, it is unlikely to identify an association variant with genome-wide significance, i.e. 5 3 10 28 , unless the effect size is very large (e.g. odds ratio of more than 3). Despite the existing difficulty, we proceeded to GWAS since it allows the comprehensive understanding of the pos-sible genetic determinism of human A(H7N9) influenza in an unbiased manner. We performed a GWAS in 102 A(H7N9) patients and 106 local healthy poultry workers, who have been intensively exposed to A(H7N9) viruses without clinical evidence of infection. To tackle the stringent significance cutoff of GWAS, we utilized various approaches to analyze GWAS data. We applied an artificial imputation program SnipSnip 17 to improve the association signals and facilitate the discovery of association variants. We performed pathway-based analysis to uncover the biological pathways associated with the higher risk to A(H7N9) infection. The expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping was also leveraged to facilitate the identification of the association variants. We demonstrated that genetic variations in lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 1 (LGALS1, also known as Galectin 1) are contributable to the differential susceptibility to A(H7N9) influenza. Moreover, two biological pathways, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling are significantly enriched pathways associated with the susceptibility to influenza A(H7N9) infection.",

There was no significant difference in the proportion of female between the A(H7N9) cases and poultry worker controls (34% (35/102) vs 35% (37/106), P 5 1.000).

Our attempt to recruit age-comparable controls for the patients was unsuccessful due to the job requirement for poultry workers; since poultry trafficking and transaction involve numerous physicallychallenging labors, which would be too demanding for people at their sixties.",

The software uses a sophisticated algorithm to select an optimal nearby partner SNP for each anchor SNP based on the correlation between the two SNPs. In simulation studies, the program successfully identified causal variants which would otherwise be missed by the conventional single-SNP analysis 17 . In this study, all variants in our GWAS dataset were subject to SnipSnip analysis. As shown in Figure 2 , SnipSnip implementation substantially increased the association signals compared to the traditional single-SNP analysis. Interestingly, the top 4 causal variants were mapped to C8B and LGALS1 (Table 2) , the identical genes discovered in single-SNP analysis as top candidates. The artificial imputation (AI) P value (6.72 3 10 28 ) of the top association signal, a variant of C8B, marginally met the genome-wide significance threshold; while the AI P values of the next three variants, which were mapped to LGALS1, fell at 10 27 level. Despite the failure to achieve genome-wide significance for variants of LGALS1, our results did yield variants with higher statistical significance than would be expected by chance as shown in Q-Q plot of our data (supplementary Figure 1 ). The two C8B variants, rs1960384 (the top SNP) and rs646606 (the anchor SNP) are both intronic SNPs. There has been little evidence implicating the functional alteration related to these two variants. On contrary, the anti-influenza activity of LGALS1 has been demonstrated in a recent study 18 . In this study, three out of the top four association variants from SnipSnip analysis were mapped to LGALS1. Therefore, we focused on LGALS1 to explore the possible functional mechanism underlying the genetic associations.",

Notably, three variants of LGALS1 were associated with the susceptibility to A(H7N9) infection (Table 2) . Among the three anchor SNPs, rs4820294 and rs62236673 were in high LD in our study participants (r 2 5 0.98) and other populations (r 2 5 1.0, Figure 1 ), indicating the anchor/partner pair rs4820294/ rs2899292 and rs62236673/rs2899292 captured the identical causal variant. We chose one pair rs4820294/rs2899292 for further analysis. The causal variant captured by SnipSnip analysis was represented as an anchor/partner pair, which are in weak LD with causal variant but can optimally capture the association signal for the latter. Although AI P values of causal variants are illustrated in Table 2 , we are unaware of their distribution in the patient and control group; neither can we postulate the possible molecular mechanism underlying the associations. Now that the anchor and partner SNP are in weak LD with the causal variant, we inferred the distribution of the causal variant by haplotype analysis of the anchor and partner SNP although the association and distribution of anchor/partner haplotypes as surrogate for those of non-genotyped causal variant may be an underestimation 17 . We simulated the association signal of the causal variant by haplotype analysis of anchor/partner pair rs4820294/rs2899292. As shown in Table 3 , due to the LD between rs4820294 and rs2899292 ( Figure 1 ; A(H7N9)), the haplotype AA was rarely present in our study subjects with an overall frequency of less than 2%. The strongest association signal was haplotype GG, which was significantly overrepresented in controls (35.58%) than in A(H7N9) patients (14.33%). The odds ratio of 0.26 for haplotype GG with the liability to infection can be translated into a more comprehensible interpretation that carriers of this haplotype were conferred 3.84 (95% CI, 2.24-6.58) fold of protection from A(H7N9) infection compared with non-carriers (P 5 5.92 3 10 27 ). The approximation of the P value of rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG to the AI P value of rs4820294/rs2899292 (2.13 3 10 27 ) suggested that the haplotype GG can appropriately simulate the signal of causal variant represented by SNP pair rs4820294/ rs2899292. The identification of rs4820294/rs2899292 haplotype GG was literally an advantage of SnipSnip over other commonlyused imputation softwares since SnipSnip can capture the association signals when they derive from a genuine haplotype effect but not to the effect of any ungenotyped single-locus variant.",

The protective allele A was over-represented in control group (29.3%) than in patient group (10.8%) with an odds ratio of 0.29, which can be translated into 3.41 fold higher protection from A(H7N9) infection to carriers of the allele A than the non-carriers. Actually, rs13057866 A allele can mark rs4820294/rs2899292 GG haplotype due to the complete linkage between rs13057866 and rs4820294 (D' 5 1.0) in all the queried populations (our cohort, ASN, AMR and CHB) as well as the high LD between rs13057866 and rs2899292 in our study cohort (D' 5 0.92) and other populations (D' $ 0.74, Figure 1 ). Specifically, rs13057866, rs4820294 and their high LD variants form a high LD block in the regulatory region of LGALS1 ( Figure 1 ). Based on experimental evidence of ENCODE, most of these variants are functional (supplementary Table 2 ). Namely, the variants aggregated in the regulatory region form a functional haplotype which may affect LGALS1 gene expression. As mentioned above, the standard imputation in the region accommodating LGALS1 failed to obtain any variant with dramatically increased association signal than rs13057866. Therefore, the ''nongenotyped causal variant'' captured by SnipSnip implementation is unlikely a single-locus variant. Instead, the functionally haplotype(s) tagged by rs13057866, rs4820294 and their high LD variants are the real causal variants which generated the strong association signals in SnipSnip implementation (Table 2) . Collectively, integrating our experimental findings and data mining from the public databases, we demonstrated that rs4820294, rs13057866 and their high LD variants may jointly encode LGALS1 expression variations, thereby caused the differential susceptibility to A(H7N9) infection among humans.",

Pathway-based analysis or gene set enrichment analysis have emerged as a powerful approach to overcome the limitation of traditional single-SNP analysis of GWAS 21 , based on the concept that genes do not work in isolation; functionally related genes in the same molecular network or pathway are often involved in the disease susceptibility 22 . In contrast with single-SNP association, pathway-based analysis examines groups of functionally related genes, each of which may have too small effect to be detected individually, but can be detectable when analyzed as a functional group. In our study, all the variants with P , 0.001 were mapped to 536 unique genes with ANNOVAR 23 , which were then applied to a WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt) 24 . WebGestalt was used to identify the enriched pathways in association with the susceptibility to A(H7N9) infection in Kyoto Encyclopedia of the Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway collection, which consists of 390 well-defined categories. The top two hits were the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (Table 4 ). For example, there are totally 85 reference genes in the ECM-receptor category. Among our gene set of 536 genes, 8 polymorphic genes fell in this category while the expected number is 1.03 by chance. After correction for the multiple tests, the ECMreceptor network represents a significantly enriched category with an enrichment ratio of 7.76 and an adjusted P value of 0.0008. Similarly, 12 genes in our gene set were components of MAPK signaling pathway with the enrichment ratio of 3.69 (adjusted P value 5 0.0045). Therefore, the gene set analysis suggested that ECMreceptor interaction and MAPK signaling were the significantly enriched pathways associated with the increased susceptibility to the A(H7N9) infection.",

Both experimental and computational data support the notion that a considerable proportion of trait-associated loci harbor variations that impact the abundance of specific transcripts 27 . These expression-related variations are referred as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), which have been mapped by paralleled genome-wide analysis of gene expression and genetic variations in LCLs 28 and various human tissues 20, 29 .

Especially we have 106 local healthy poultry workers who have been heavily exposed to A(H7N9) viruses and serve as better controls than general population in this study. Moreover, we are unable to replicate our findings in a replication cohort, which is required for a standard GWAS. A genetic association at the early stage of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza encountered the same dilemma, in which 91 cases and 98 controls were applied to a GWAS. In that study, the cutoff P value was set as 1 3 10 24 for the identification of susceptible variants 42 . Apparently, we have identified the association variants with more stringent criteria. Especially, some of variants identified in this study have been substantiated with functional validation. Nevertheless, further study with more A(H7N9) patients to replicate the identified variants and enriched biological pathways are warranted.",
