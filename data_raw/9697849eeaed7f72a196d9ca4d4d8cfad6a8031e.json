The recent increase in H7N9 infections during the fifth outbreak in China has caused concerns of a possible pandemic. In this study, we describe a previously characterized human monoclonal antibody, HNIgGA6, obtained by isolating rearranged heavy-chain and light-chain genes from patients who had recovered from H7N9 infections. HNIgGA6 recognized multiple HAs and neutralized the infectivity of 11 out of the 12 H7N9 strains tested, as well as three emerging HPAI H7N9 isolates. The only resistant strain was A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9-SH1), which carries the avian receptor alleles 186V and 226Q in the sialic acid-binding pocket. The mAb broadly neutralized divergent H7N9 strains from 2013 to 2017 and represents a potential alternative treatment for H7N9 interventions.",

            "text": "The H7N9 influenza virus was first isolated in southeastern China in early 2013 1 . Since then, five epidemic waves have been reported that have caused 1258 human infections, with~40% resulting in death 2 . H7N9 causes severe respiratory distress syndrome in patients and is frequently associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumonia 3 . Noticeable dysbiosis of the oropharyngeal microbiome in H7N9 patients has also been observed 4 . During the fifth epidemic alone, 688 human infections were confirmed, making it the largest H7N9 epidemic to date. Although no sustained humanto-human transmission of the H7N9 virus was confirmed, limited human-to-human transmission has been observed 2 . Because H7N9 viruses are able to be transmitted by the airborne route between ferrets 5 and can infect and replicate in the human lower airways 6 , they have the potential for efficient human-to-human transmission and are an increasing pandemic threat. Furthermore, unlike H5N1, a high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus that causes severe disease in birds and poultry, most of the currently isolated H7N9 viruses are low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses that typically elicit no observable signs of disease in birds after viral infection. Early warning and disease control for an H7N9 pandemic may be extremely difficult, although HPAI H7N9 viruses that are more pathogenic in birds and mammals have recently emerged [7] [8] [9] . H7N9 cases have spread to 22 provinces and municipalities in mainland China 2 . Due to its ability to more readily be transmitted from birds to humans, avian-origin H7N9 has raised concerns regarding its potential for increasing the possibility of a pandemic. Thus, it is prudent to conduct clinical trials to identify an effective treatment against H7N9 influenza.",

            "text": "As a typical member of influenza A viruses, H7N9 is classified into subtypes based on the two major surface glycoproteins, haemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA), which are responsible for viral recognition, attachment to the cellular receptor and viral release. HA and NA are ideal targets for antiviral drug design. NA inhibitors, including oseltamivir and zanamivir, are currently the primary therapeutic treatment against H7N9 infection in clinical settings 10, 11 . However, because of the emergence of escape mutants that are resistant to oseltamivir or zanamivir or even both 10, 11 , alternative treatment options for human H7N9 infection are urgently needed. Vaccination is the most effective intervention against seasonal influenza. It has been demonstrated that the H7N9 vaccine is able to induce the production of both neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies in humans 12 , and an inactivated H7N9 vaccine has entered clinical trials 13 . It was very interesting and encouraging to discover that some nonneutralizing antibodies could also protect mice from H7N9 infection through Fc-FcgR interactions 12 . Vaccination with seasonal H3N2 strains was also shown to elicit H7 cross-reactive antibodies, although the level of serum protection in the general population remains to be determined 14 . However, in the event of a pandemic outbreak, massive vaccinations against an emerging virus cannot promptly achieve herd immunity. Limited by antiviral drug resistance, neutralizing therapeutic antibodies are considered to be a potentially effective treatment for influenza infections. Passive immunotherapy using convalescent plasma from patients to treat H5N1 and H1N1 infections has achieved encouraging results and has reduced mortality [15] [16] [17] . However, the large-scale production of antiserum is not possible in response to an emergency epidemic. The production of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) would provide a feasible solution to this problem. Recent studies have characterized several neutralizing antibodies from human donors that target different epitopes on viral HA proteins, such as CT149 18 , H7.167 19 , m826 20 , HNIgGD5 21 , and HNIgGA6 22 , all of which represent potential interventions in the event of an H7N9 pandemic.",

However, after the initial outbreak, a broad dissemination of the virus was observed that indicated the occurrence of more frequent amino acid changes in HA. Previously, we reported that an H7N9-neutralizing antibody, HNIgGA6, recognized the viral receptor binding site (RBS) on HA1 23 . To evaluate potential antigenic drift, we performed an alignment of 12 randomly selected HA1 sequences and assessed the amino acid substitutions in the viral RBS.

All the mutants were confirmed, and as shown in Fig. 3a , all five mutants retained the ability to bind HNIgGA6. Nevertheless, the V186G or L226Q mutations led to a noticeably reduced affinity. Dual mutations at V186G and L226Q resulted in complete loss of binding to the mAb (Fig. 3b ). In contrast, when 186G and 226Q in H7N9-SH1 were reversely mutated to V186 and L226, the mutants were restored in their ability to bind HNIgGA6 (Fig. 3c) . These findings were further confirmed with full-length viral HA by The mAb was immobilized on a CM5 chip, and a series of concentrations of HA1 were flowed over the immobilized mAb.

In this study, to avoid the lethal pathogenicity of the live H7N9 virus, we took advantage of a pseudovirusbased neutralization assay to evaluate the neutralizing activity of HNIgGA6. Pseudoviruses expressing the NA of H7N9-AH and divergent HAs were produced in 293T cells, and the neutralizing activity of HNIgGA6 was tested on susceptible MDCK cells. As in the neutralization assay with live H7N9-AH viruses, HNIgGA6 neutralized the H7N9-AH pseudovirus in a dose-dependent manner with an IC 50 of 41.66 ng/ml (Fig. 4a) . The neutralizing activity of HNIgGA6 against divergent H7N9 strains was also tested. As expected, although the H7N9-SH1 strain was resistant to HNIgGA6, the antibody could neutralize the other 11 strains with estimated IC 50 values from 36.53 to 63.47 ng/ml (Fig. 4b) . The V186G and L226Q mutations led to antigenic drift for viral HA1 and the fulllength HA protein, and the ability of the mutations to confer resistance against the mAb was also determined c The mutations G186V and Q226L restored the ability of the mAb to bind the HA of H7N9-SH1. d Viral HA and the mutated HA proteins were expressed in HeLa cells and detected via IFA using pseudovirus entry assay. As shown in Fig. 4c , when V186G and L226Q were present in H7N9-AH, the pseudovirus successfully escaped from HNIgGA6 pressure. In contrast, when G186 and Q226 were replaced by V186 and L226, the mutated H7N9-SH1 was neutralized the mAb. Taken together, these results confirmed that V186G and L226Q were responsible for antigenic drift in H7N9-SH1.",

A few RBS-directed antibodies have successfully achieved modest cross-reactivity 36,39,40 by interposing a smaller footprint into the receptor binding groove. However, most RBS-directed antibodies have exhibited a limited breadth in their neutralization activity, including 2D1 41 and 5J8 42 , due to extra contacts with variable residues in the periphery of the conserved pocket. In this study, we tested the binding affinity of HNIgGA6 for 12 different HAs of prevalent H7N9 strains isolated from April 2013 to January 2017. H7N9 HA has been rapidly evolving (Fig. 1a) , which is consistent with the previous result that H7 HA is continually mutating at a high rate 43 . Our results showed that HNIgGA6 utilizes avidity to extend its breadth of recognition and to increase its affinity against a large portion of divergent HA strains (11 out of 12), including the A143V/R148K variant, which has become the dominant circulating strain in the fifth wave 43 . HNIgGA6 exhibited a loss of binding to the HA variant on the H7N9-SH1 strain, an earlier isolate from the 2013 Shanghai epidemic carrying an avian H7 signature 1 . The preference for avian \u03b1\u22122,3-linked sialic acid cellular receptors rather than human \u03b1\u22122,6linked sialic acids receptors limited its transmission to humans, and the SH1 strain was rarely observed in latter outbreaks. Two amino acids substitutions (V186G and L226Q) were responsible for the preference of different cellular receptors, as well as the antigenic drift of H7N9-SH1 (Fig. 3) . Although HNIgGA6 recognized 11 other HAs, the observed binding affinities were not completely consistent. An approximately tenfold decrease in binding affinity was observed for A/Hebei/01/2013 and A/Guangdong/15SF001/2015 carrying the L226Q and V186A mutations, respectively, indicating important roles of V186 and L226 in binding HNIgGA6. The reason for the attenuated binding affinity to A/Jiangsu/ 06306/2014, A/Fujian/1/2016, A/Anhui/13433/2017, and A/Zhejiang/5/2017 remains to be determined. However, the A135V substitution in the RBS that the four strains share in common is surely worth studying further.",

However, because the pseudotyped virus particle entry assays may be overly sensitive, an accurate assessment of the in vitro and in vivo neutralizing activity of HNIgGA6 using live H7N9 viruses is still needed. This is especially necessary since mutations on other genes besides HA are also associated with viral replication capacity, pathogenicity, and transmissibility. The E627K mutation in the polymerase basic 2 (PB2) gene enhances H7N9 replication in mammals 44 . The K526R mutation in PB2, which was identified in a HPAI H7N9 (A/Taiwan/1/2017) strain, also contributes to improve replication efficiency together with 627K 45 . The NA R292K mutation confers resistance to both oseltamivir and peramivir 46 . Nevertheless, based on genetic and phylogenetic analyses, the WHO has recommended that H7N9-AH may serve as a viable vaccine candidate for broad protection against H7 47, 48 .

The HA1 proteins were serially diluted to between 0.078 and 2.5 nM (0.078, 0.156, 0.3125, 0.625, 1.25, and 2.5 nM) and were then flowed over the mAb.

Supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection. The H7N9 pseudovirus was purified by ultracentrifugation and dissolved in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) before being stored at \u221280\u00b0C in aliquots until their use in the neutralization assay. The 11 HAs were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the H7N9-AH HA-encoding gene according to the gene alignment results in Fig. 1b . The HA genes of three HPAI H7N9 variants, including A/Guangdong/17SF006/2017, A/Guangdong/Th005/2017, and A/Taiwan/1/2017, were custom synthesized and cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 vector. All the clones used were confirmed by sequencing. The viral titers were determined in MDCK cells by luciferase activity as the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ). Neutralization assays were performed by incubating 100 TCID 50 of pseudovirus with serially diluted antibodies at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The mixture was added to the cultured MDCK cells. Viral infection was quantified by the luciferase activity 48 h after infection. An irrelevant human IgG protein (anti-HIV, Immune Technology) was used as a negative control.",
