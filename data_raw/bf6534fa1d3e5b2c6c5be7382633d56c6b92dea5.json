The purpose of the present study was to assess and compare the incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in nursing home (NH) residents and staff, to identify viruses involved in ARI and to correlate viral etiology with clinical manifestations of ARI. Methods: The prospective surveillance study was accomplished in a medium-sized NH in Slovenia (central Europe). Ninety NH residents and 42 NH staff were included. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from all participants at enrollment (December 5th, 2011) and at the end of the study (May 31st, 2012), and from each participant that developed ARI within this timeframe. Molecular detection of 15 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal swab samples was performed. Results: The weekly incidence rate of ARI in NH residents and NH staff correlated; however, it was higher in staff members than in residents (5.9 versus 3.8/1,000 person-days, P = 0.03), and was 2.5 (95 % CI: 1.36-4.72) times greater in residents without dementia than in residents with dementia. Staff members typically presented with upper respiratory tract involvement, whereas in residents lower respiratory tract infections predominated. Respiratory viruses were detected in 55/100 ARI episodes. In residents, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus were detected most commonly, whereas in NH staff rhinovirus and influenza A virus prevailed. 38/100 ARI episodes (30/56 in residents, 8/44 in staff) belonged to one of three outbreaks (caused by human metapneumovirus, influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, respectively). NH residents had higher chances for virus positivity within outbreak than HN staff (OR = 7.4, 95 % CI: 1.73-31.48, P < 0.01). Conclusions: ARI are common among NH residents and staff, and viruses were detected in a majority of the episodes of ARI. Many ARI episodes among NH residents were outbreak cases and could be considered preventable. Trial registration: The study was registered on the 1 th of December 2011 at ClinicalTrials (NCT01486160).",

Pneumonia is the most common reason for hospital admittance among NH residents and a significant cause of mortality. It has been estimated that 40 % of lower respiratory tract community-acquired infections in persons >65 years old in the US are caused by viruses [2] . Each year about 54,000 deaths that occur in this population are due to infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (InfV) A and B [3, 4] . Infections caused by other viruses such as human rhinoviruses and human enteroviruses (hRV/EV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human coronaviruses (hCoV) have also been reported, but data on the role of these viruses in the elderly are scant [5] .",

            "text": "Infection with respiratory viruses may be asymptomatic or symptomatic; symptomatic infection may range from mild upper to severe lower respiratory tract infections, and may cause exacerbation of underlying diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [6] . Viral respiratory infections can be sporadic or epidemic. RSV epidemics in adults usually alternate with epidemics of influenza and are clinically difficult to distinguish. Picornaviruses (hRV/EV) are predominantly associated with the common cold but are also the cause of lower respiratory tract infections, especially in small children and the elderly [7] .] HMPV and hCoV are distributed worldwide, and in countries with temperate climates they usually cause winter epidemics, which often follow an RSV outbreak [8, 9] . Nevertheless, knowledge about infections with these viruses in NH residents is incomplete. In comparison to acute care hospitals, infection control practices in NH cannot be as strict; many vulnerable people with underlying chronic diseases share common spaces for daily activities and infections can spread easily. Due to daily visitors and NH staff, viral infections from the community can be introduced into the NH. In addition, scant clinical symptoms combined with a shortage of medical personnel and limited diagnostic facilities can lead to delayed recognition of infections and consequently delayed introduction of preventive measures.",

Potential other explanations for the lower ARI incidence rate could have been the result of a fewer number of visitors to demented in comparison to nondemented residents (not found in the present study) and/or less intensive personal contacts among family members and demented residents (not assessed in the present study).

We used a multiplexed real-time RT-PCR method, which is highly sensitive for detecting viruses in nasopharyngeal swabs [23, 24] ; consequently, a higher percentage of viruses was detected among ARI episodes in our study as compared to studies not based on PCR methodology. Our findings in NH residents corroborate the findings of Liebermann et al., who reported a very high proportion of viruses involved in pneumonia (31.7 %) and in other LRTI (51.7 %) in adult patients [2] . However, the etiological role of viruses demonstrated in nasopharyngeal swabs in patients with ARI is associated with some ambiguity and is particularly problematic in patients with LRTI. Although the viruses may cause LRTI, they may also cause only URTI but not concurrently present LRTI (this may be due to bacterial superinfection, which viral URTI predisposes toward), or could simply be innocent bystanders. In this study, viruses were detected in nasopharyngeal swabs of 7.4 % healthy NH residents (mostly hRV/EV) and in 6.9 % of healthy NH staff (exclusively hRV/EV). These results are comparable with the 4 % occurrence of viruses in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from healthy elderly persons living in the community [21] and with the findings of Liebermann et al.

Because visits were prohibited during the influenza outbreak (i.e., during the highest occurrence of ARI), the appraisal remained indecisive. Another limitations of our study are that the investigation was performed only during the winter, when viral infections are more common, and that no bacterial causes were sought. With the extension of the analysis in the same nursing home over several seasons we would have been able to assess if the conclusions of present study had a more general appliance. Further limitations of the present study are the lack of viral sequencing (comparison of sequences would enable to reliably confirm the presumed links between the cases for each of the viruses), as well as small overall sample size and the low observed prevalence of most viruses, which drastically reduces the statistical power of any statistical comparison aimed at comparing specific viruses. For this reason we did not attempt to compare the prevalence of viruses among subgroups of participants.",

Since study is performed on a publicly known location and in a small collective it would be possible to identify individuals. At time of the study the authors where not aware of incentives or need to publicly share other research data than i.e. DNA sequences, so it also didn't seek permission from participants for clinical data sharing. However, the authors fully agree that the datasets analysed during the current study will be available directly from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Author's contributions TU, NGM, FS, and LL wrote the manuscript. The study was designed by MP, FS, TU, and NGM. The diagnostics for respiratory viruses from clinical samples was performed by TU and MP. The data were statistically analyzed by LL and NGM.
