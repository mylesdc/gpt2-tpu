The use of antibiotics remains highly prevalent in young children, but can lead to antimicrobial resistance as well as reinforcing the idea that parents should re-consult for similar symptoms. One of the main drivers of indiscriminate antimicrobial use is the lack of evidence for, and therefore uncertainty regarding, which children are at risk of poor outcome. This paper describes the protocol for the TARGET cohort study, which aims to derive and validate a clinical prediction rule to identify children presenting to primary care with respiratory tract infections who are at risk of hospitalisation.",

Following informed consent, symptoms, signs and demographics will be measured. In around a quarter of children from the Bristol centre, a single sweep, dual bacterial-viral throat swab will be taken and parents asked to complete a symptom diary until the child is completely well or for 28 days, whichever is sooner. A review of medical notes including clinical history, re-consultation and hospitalisations will be undertaken. Multivariable logistic regression will be used to identify the independent clinical predictors of hospitalisation as well as the prognostic significance of upper respiratory tract microbes. The clinical prediction rule will be internally validated using various methods including bootstrapping.",

First, they are mostly managed in primary care and are extremely common and costly to service providers, families and employers [1, 2] . Second, there is clinical uncertainty in primary care regarding the diagnosis and best management of RTIs, as reflected by the variation in the use of antibiotics in primary care for RTIs between nations [3] , general practitioner (GP) practices [4] and clinicians [5, 6] . Thirdly, antibiotic prescribing by primary care clinicians in the UK is again on the rise [7] and finally combined with the slowing in the development of new antibiotics, the overuse and misuse of existing antibiotics is associated with the development and proliferation of antimicrobial resistance between [8] and within [9] nations as well as individuals [8] [9] [10] . The use of antibiotics also leads to the subsequent 'medicalisation of illness' in which patients believe they should consult for similar symptoms in the future [11] . Thus, the increasing or decreasing use of antibiotics can lead to vicious or virtuous re-consultation cycles.",

This plausible possibility will of course in itself alter the risk of the hospitalisation outcome amongst children in the study, and hence in turn reduce the apparent associations between some risk factors and the outcome. In addition, in order to ensure an unbiased sample of the full illness spectrum, clinicians are asked to identify a systematic recruitment strategy. Clinicians are asked to specify how many children per week they expect to recruit. To measure the success of clinicians' recruitment strategies, and to establish the generalisability of recruited children to the population as a whole, clinicians are asked to complete some brief details on those children that they invited to participate but declined and those they missed. Clinicians are asked to use the online database or complete and send postcards to record the child's illness severity and the reason for decline or missed opportunity to recruit. A 'missed' opportunity to recruit is defined as those children who would have normally met the clinician's own strategy criteria and the study inclusion criteria but where the clinician decided not to recruit for whatever reason (for instance, the clinician forgot or was too busy).",

The web-based data collection and management system was created by the Bristol and London teams, with input from all centres and collaborators. As a time-saving facility, when a recruiting clinician completes the CRF as an online form, a summary of the data collected is created for the clinician to copy and paste into the recruited child's medical record. The symptom diary is available for Bristol centre parents to complete online. Parents/carers access their child's online symptom diary by entering the child's study identification number and date of birth. Only parents/carers who have completed a valid consent form can use this facility. Each study centre has an MS Access (Microsoft, US) database, which facilitates primary care site, recruiting clinician, and notes review management. The Bristol study centre holds a combined version, updated at least weekly, so that weekly recruitment and notes review completion monitoring summaries are produced and reviewed.",

First, descriptive statistics will be used for: children's clinical and microbiological characteristics; hospitalisations; symptom duration and severity; and primary care re-consultations; immunisation and antibiotic exposures pre-recruitment; antibiotic prescribing and consumption. For outcomes such as hospitalisation, re-consultation, lengthy symptom duration and antibiotic prescribing testing will include chi-square for categorical variables (or Fisher's exact test when the expected cell is less than 5) and both a parametric and non-parametric approach for continuous variables depending on the nature of the distribution. Internal validation will be used for assessing the value of a derived rule [34] . We will also explore alternative approaches including bootstrapping and subdivision of the sample on a selective rather than a random basis so as to assess the robustness of the rule in different circumstances (such as geographical location). The clinical prediction rule will be developed based on the linear predictor in a logistic regression model in which the outcome variable is hospitalisation among children not treated with antibiotics. Candidate prognostic variables will be categorised into demographic background, and symptoms and signs (for example, overall illness severity, fever, shortness of breath). Variables included in logistic regression models will be based on an 'inclusive' p-value threshold of 0.1 in the univariable analysis. Significance in the multivariable model will take into account the number of variables tested using multiple testing methods such as the Bonferroni Correction. We will check for nonlinear effects of continuous variables, and will examine candidate interactions specified a priori. Such effects will be included in the final models as necessary. We will begin by examining the predictive value (based on diagnostic odds ratios and confidence interval (CI) statistics) of the best predictors from the socio-demographic variables. We will then examine the additional prognostic value of presenting signs and symptoms (compared with socio-demographic data alone).",
