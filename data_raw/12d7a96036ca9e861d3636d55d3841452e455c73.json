A total of 324 patients underwent their first HDCT/ auto-SCT between October 2004 and September 2014, and 283 of them proceeded to their second HDCT/auto-SCT (a total of 607 HDCT/auto-SCTs). During the early transplant period of 607 HDCT/auto-SCTs (from the beginning of HDCT to day 30 post-transplant), bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), respiratory virus infection, and varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation occurred in 7.1%, 2.3%, 13.0%, and 2.5% of HDCT/auto-SCTs, respectively. The early transplant period of the second HDCT/auto-SCT had infectious complications similar to the first HDCT/auto-SCT. During the late transplant period of HDCT/ auto-SCT (from day 31 to 1 year post-transplant), bacteremia, UTI, and VZV reactivation occurred in 7.5%, 2.5%, and 3.9% of patients, respectively. Most infectious complications in the late transplant period occurred during the first 6 months post-transplant. There were no invasive fungal infections during the study period. Six patients died from infectious complications (4 from bacterial sepsis and 2 from respiratory virus infection). Our study suggests that infectious complications are similar following second and first HDCT/auto-SCT in children.",

However, the number of CD34 + cells for each session of tandem HDCT/auto-SCT could be lower than in single HDCT/auto-SCT because about half of the collected stem cells are infused during each HDCT/auto-SCT session. In addition, the second HDCT/auto-SCT could require a longer time for hematologic recovery than the first HDCT/auto-SCT, even when similar numbers of CD34 + cells are infused [17] . These findings suggest that infectious complications might be more frequent or severe in the second HDCT/ auto-SCT than in the first, but studies addressing infectious complications during tandem HDCT/auto-SCT have been limited. Accordingly, we investigated infectious complications during tandem HDCT/auto-SCT.",

For coagulase-negative staphylococci and corynebacteria, isolation from at least two sets of blood cultures with the same antibiogram was required. Septic shock was defined as bacteremia with hypotension or the use of inotropic agents. Urinary tract infection (UTI) was defined by urinary symptoms and/or a fever and a hospital record of a positive urine culture. A positive urine culture was defined as the growth of !10 5 colony-forming unit/mL of a single organism in midstream or bag urine specimens. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) required the presence of diarrhea (defined as !3 unformed stools in 24 hours) or radiographic evidence of ileus or toxic megacolon and a positive stool test result for toxigenic Clostridium difficile or its toxins, or colonoscopic or histopathologic findings demonstrating pseudomembranous colitis [18] .

RVs were categorized into 2 groups according to the symptomatology and clinical outcome. The low-risk RV group included RhV and CoV, and the high-risk RV group included RSV, PIV, AdV, and IV.

These infections included 43 (7.1%) episodes of bacteremia, 14 (2.3%) episodes of UTI, and 11 (1.8%) episodes of CDI. Of 43 episodes with bacteremia, 33 were caused by Gram-negative organisms and 13 by Gram-positive organisms. A total of 10 septic shock episodes occurred, which were caused by 9 Gram-negative bacteremias and 1 Gram-positive bacteremia. Three patients died from bacterial sepsis during the early transplant period of HDCT/auto-SCT. All UTIs were caused by Gram-negative bacteria. Table 3 shows multivariate analysis for risk factors of bacteremia in the early transplant period of HDCT/auto-SCT.

This study evaluated infectious complications in 324 patients with high-risk solid tumors, 283 of whom underwent tandem HDCT/auto-SCT, over a 10-year period in a single institue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cohort of children and adolescents who underwent tandem HDCT/auto-SCT. In general, the frequency and severity of infectious complications in our cohort were similar to those in a cohort of 320 children and adolescents at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH), most of whom underwent single HDCT/auto-SCT [21] . We initially hypothesized infectious complications might be more frequent or severe in the second HDCT/auto-SCT than in the first HDCT/auto-SCT. In contrast, we found that episodes of fever were more frequent and the proportion of cases using second-line antibiotics was higher in the first HDCT/auto-SCT than in the second. Otherwise, there was no difference in infection parameters between the first and second HDCT/auto-SCT. In the multivariate analysis for risk factors of infectious complications during tandem HDCT/auto-SCT, inclusion of TBI and/or thiotepa which frequently causes severe mucositis, was a significant high-risk factor; however, the second HDCT/auto-SCT (compared to the first HDCT/auto-SCT) was not a significant factor. Collectively, these findings suggest that the second HDCT/auto-SCT does not increase the severity of infectious complications compared to the first, and that the severity of infectious complications during tandem HDCT/ auto-SCT might be associated with HDCT regimens rather than the number of HDCTs. In our study, the overall incidence of bacteremia during the early transplant period after HDCT/auto-SCT was 7.1%, which was lower than results from adult studies [13, 22] and similar to the 7% incidence of overall bacteremia seen 0-30 days post-transplant in a SJCRH cohort [21] . This incidence of bacteremia might be acceptable considering the nature of treatment and the usual prognosis for tumors included in this study; however, the MDR bacteremia might be a significant clinical problem [10, 23] . In this study, the incidence of MDR bacteria, particularly ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, appeared to increase over time, and four patients died from MDR bacterial infection. These findings suggest that infection from MDR bacteria might be a substantial clinical problem during HDCT/auto-SCT in the future; therefore, careful consideration in the use of antibiotics is needed to reduce the emergence of MDR bacteria.",

There were no cases of IFI in the SJCRH study using fluconazole up to 30 days post-transplant [21] . In our study, most cases received prophylactic or empirical antifungal prophylaxis and no IFI occurred. These findings suggest that the incidence of IFI in children with solid tumors might be lower than the incidence reported in adults with hematologic malignancies [25] . In this study, no antifungal agent was used in 46 (7.6%) HDCT/auto-SCTs, and there was no IFI. Collectively, these findings suggest the need to evaluate whether antifungal prophylaxis is needed in HDCT/auto-SCT for children with solid tumors. For patients with RV infection, HDCT/auto-SCT is usually postponed until the RV infection disappears. However, in some patients, RV infection might persist for a long time without symptoms, as seen in our study. Significant delay of HDCT/auto-SCT until viral clearing might increase the risk of tumor progression, so clinicians might have to determine when to start HDCT/auto-SCT in these patients. In this study, 14 RV-positive patients without respiratory symptoms proceeded to HDCT/auto-SCT, because RV did not disappear during the waiting period. Eight of them experienced clinical respiratory infection including 2 LRTIs; however, there was no mortality. This study showed that the incidence of LRTI was relatively low (10.0%) in low-risk RV infection and there were no cases of mortality. Taken together, these findings suggest that patients with low-risk RV infection prior to HDCT/auto-SCT could proceed to HDCT/auto-SCT with relatively low-risk of severe respiratory infection, when the risk of tumor progression is high. However, for patients with high-risk RV infection, careful consideration is needed to determine when to start HDCT/auto-SCT.",

In addition, most infectious complications in the late transplant period occurred during the first 6 months after the second HDCT/auto-SCT; therefore, careful immune surveillance should be continued until at least 6 months post-transplant.",

In addition, the incidence and severity of infectious complications in the second HDCT/auto-SCT was not higher than in the first HDCT/auto-SCT. However, our study is a retrospective study and diversities in disease and treatment limit our ability to draw a solid conclusion. Further study is needed to reduce the risk of infectious complications during and after tandem HDCT/auto-SCT for children with high-risk or recurrent solid tumors.",

A total of 38 patients (13.5%) experienced 42 episodes of infection other than RV infection during the late transplant period. These infections included 21 (7.5%) episodes of bacteremia, 7 (2.5%) episodes of UTI, 2 (0.7%) episodes of CDI, 11 (3.9%) episodes of VZV infection (10 localized zoster and 1 varicella), and 1 (0.4%) episode of CMV disease. There were no cases of IFI and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Most infectious complications during the late transplant period occurred during the first 6 months after HDCT/auto-SCT and were comprised primarily of bacteremia (14/21, 66.7%), VZV reactivation (8/11, 72.7%), and UTI (5/7, 71.4%). Of 21 episodes of bacteremia, 17 were caused by Gram-positive organisms and 4 by Gram-negative organisms. Eighteen of 20 patients who developed 21 episodes of bacteremia had indwelling central catheters at the time of infection. One patient who had suffered severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease and had been dependent on a mechanical ventilator at the time of infection died from bacterial sepsis during the late transplant period.",
