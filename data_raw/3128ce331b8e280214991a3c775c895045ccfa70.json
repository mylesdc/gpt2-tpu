Oral treatment using L. lactis NCDO 2118 resulted in a milder form of recurrent colitis than that observed in control diseased mice. This protective effect was not attributable to changes in secretory IgA (sIgA); however, NCDO 2118 administration was associated with an early increase in IL-6 production and sustained IL-10 production in colonic tissue. Mice fed L. lactis NCDO 2118 had an increased number of regulatory CD4 + T cells (Tregs) bearing surface TGF-\u03b2 in its latent form (Latency-associated peptide-LAP) in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen. Conclusions: Here, we identified a new probiotic strain with a potential role in the treatment of IBD, and we elucidated some of the mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory effect.",

However, Lactococcus lactis strains are in constant transit through the GIT after ingestion of fermented dairy and vegetable products, and a few studies have shown that they can exert beneficial effects [20] . Among these, Nishitani et al. [22] demonstrated that L. lactis subsp. cremoris FC possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. Oral administration of L. lactis FC reduced inflammatory cytokine production as well as inducible nitric oxide expression in dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice, suggesting that orally administered L. lactis FC may have a beneficial impact in human IBD [22] . Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential mechanisms involved in the antiinflammatory effects of L. lactis strains that are still poorly understood.",

Caco-2 cells secreted baseline levels of IL-8, which increased after stimulation with IL-1\u03b2. None of the live cell fractions were able to reduce IL-1\u03b2-induced IL-8 secretion ( Figure 1A) ; however, the supernatant of NCDO 2118 cultures reduced the production of IL-8 by 45% ( Figure 1B) , whereas the other 2 supernatants did not show similar effects.

This experimental protocol mimics the remission and active periods of IBD. As shown in Figure 2B , the body weight of mice significantly decreased during DSS treatment compared to the body weight of water-treated mice (control group). After DSS withdrawal, the mice gradually recovered their body weight in all experimental groups. Treatment with L. lactis NCDO 2118 did not contribute to a significant change in weight gain ( Figure 2B ). A reduction in colon length at day 14 in the DSS and DSS + NCDO2118 groups was also observed ( Figure 2C ). Nevertheless, at the end of the experiment on day 21, oral treatment with L. lactis led to the restoration of colon length ( Figure 2C ). Mice consuming L. lactis exhibited significantly reduced clinical symptoms (macroscopic inflammatory score) in the recovery phase and upon colitis induction ( Figure 2D ), despite the severity of inflammation after the second colitis cycle. These findings suggest that L. lactis NCDO2118 administered in vivo has an anti-inflammatory effect.",

IBD is generally believed to be driven by T cells and has been thought to be associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines, especially from Th1 and Th17 cells. Specialised regulatory T cells counterbalance these proinflammatory responses [44, 45] . The numbers of activated T cells expressing the earliest inducible cell surface glycoprotein acquired during lymphoid activation, CD69, were analysed after colitis induction. The numbers of CD4 + CD69 + T cells were increased only in the spleens of mice fed L. lactis NCDO 2118. Therefore, some L. lactis products were able to activate T cells. Transfer of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells or innate immune activation in leukopenic mice have been reported to induce colitis, whereas co-transfer of CD4 + CD25 + CD45RB low T cells can prevent disease induction [46] . This T cell population was further identified as a regulatory T cell subset. Despite the anti-inflammatory activity of L. lactis NCDO 2118, its administration did not enhance the frequency of this regulatory T cell population. However, another type of peripherally induced Treg cells characterised by their surface expression of LAP, which is the N-terminal propeptide of TGF-beta precursor, were increased in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens of mice treated with L. lactis NCDO 2118. Previously, Di Giacinto et al. [17] showed that administration of the probiotic VSL#3 during the remission period of TNBS-induced colitis increases the numbers of regulatory CD4 + LAP + T cells, and this is essential to the protective effect of the probiotic.",

In the chemically induced colitis model, we found increased numbers of CD11c + CD103 + DCs in mice treated with DSS. However, oral administration of L. lactis NCDO 2118 enhanced the numbers of CD11c + CD103 + DCs to a greater extent. Gyu Jeon et al.

Orally administered Lactococcus lactis NCDO 2118 is able to induce an early increase in IL-6 production and to sustain IL-10 secretion in colonic tissue of the dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced murine model of ulcerative colitis. It also increases the number of local tolerogenic dendritic cells (CD11c + CD11b \u2212 CD103 + ). These cells migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes and stimulate the expansion of CD4 + CD25 + LAP + cells, a regulatory type of T cell (Treg), leading ultimately to downmodulation of colitis.",

[53] . Body weight loss was calculated as the difference between the initial and actual weight. Diarrhea was determined by assessing mucus/faecal material adhering to anal fur and was confirmed by the presence or absence of faecal pellet formation and continuous fluid faecal material in the colon. Rectal bleeding was defined as diarrhea containing visible blood and gross rectal bleeding. The three major clinical signs (weight loss, diarrhea, and occult/gross bleeding) were scored separately. The macroscopic score was calculated from the score of the clinical signs using the following formula: (weight loss score) + (diarrhea score) + (rectal bleeding score). After the mice were sacrificed, their spleens, mesenteric lymph nodes and colons were excised. Spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes were used for cell population analysis. Colon samples were fixed in formalin and processed for histological analysis. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections were blindly scored based on a previously described semi-quantitative scoring system [54] . The following features were graded: extent of destruction of normal mucosal architecture (0: normal; 1, 2 and 3: mild, moderate and extensive damage, respectively), presence and degree of cellular infiltration (0: normal; 1, 2 and 3: mild, moderate and transmural infiltration, respectively), extent of muscle thickening (0: normal; 1, 2 and 3: mild, moderate and extensive thickening, respectively), presence or absence of crypt abscesses (0: absent; 1: present) and the presence or absence of goblet cell depletion (0: absent; 1: present). Scores for each feature were summed up to a maximum possible score of 11.",
