It is a quantity which is commonly collected during a pandemic and is of fundamental importance to public health policy and mathematical modelling. In this paper we present a novel method for calculating the serial interval distribution for a Markovian model of household transmission dynamics. This allows the use of Bayesian MCMC methods, with explicit evaluation of the likelihood, to fit to serial interval data and infer parameters of the underlying model. We use simulated and real data to verify the accuracy of our methodology and illustrate the importance of accounting for household size. The output of our approach can be used to produce posterior distributions of population level epidemic characteristics.",

This approach allows an accurate calculation of the mean and possibly other moments. However, an obvious drawback of such an approach is that the estimate itself gives no understanding of the underlying mechanics, and hence it is difficult to make predictions with quantifiable confidence or to assess the impact of proposed control policies. This is because the serial interval is not a biological quantity in its own right but the convolution of the processes of transmission and incubation. This is further confounded by the fact that the time of infection is almost certainly unobservable, and because households are small, depletion of susceptibles has a large impact on the (stochastic) transmission process [14] . For these reasons, the only way to infer both epidemiological and dynamical quantities from serial interval data is by assuming and fitting a transmission model [15, 16] . This approach not only provides an estimate of the serial interval distribution, but estimates a full mechanistic model which may be used to make predictions and assess the impact of intervention policies [6] .",

In these it is assumed that there are two levels of mixing: strong mixing within a household and weaker mixing between households [17] . As the overall population is assumed to be large and randomly mixing, then during the early stages of an epidemic repeated introduction of infection into a single household is negligible. The assumption of only one introduction allows for deeper analysis of the model, and also allows for computationally-efficient methods to be developed for evaluating early-time quantities [17, 21] ; here it allows us to ignore the external infection rate, and use serial interval data to estimate the other parameters. Obviously during the mid-to-late stages of an outbreak, this assumption breaks down and hence more complex models are required, but for this study we confine ourselves to this common assumption. This early stage of an epidemic is important as we want to infer parameters which can then be used (with further assumptions) in population level models to assess possible interventions and inform public health policy.",

The data is generated by first choosing a random number of household sizes (from 2 to 7) from the size-biased distribution. For each household, a serial interval observation is sampled according to the true distribution binned into days (D max~1 0). Figure 1B shows the simulated serial interval data stratified by household size. Figure 1C shows the simulated serial interval data summed over all household sizes. Figure 2 shows how the serial interval distribution changes with household size, for sizes N~2,3 and 8 with frequency dependent mixing (b is held constant for different N). Larger households have higher probability of shorter serial intervals because there are more possibilities for who is the first individual to display symptoms. The change is greatest between N~2 and 3, and decreases thereafter. This is because there is a trade-off between more people competing to show symptoms and the fact that these must have been infected later than the first person. As the household size increases the distribution therefore tends to a limiting case. As the variance of the exposed period decreases (j Figure 1C .

This situation often arises when trying to analyse aggregated data from the literature. Figure 3 shows samples from the posterior distributions assuming three different (fixed) household sizes: N~2,3 and 4. The serial interval data used is that summed over all households, shown in Figure 1C , corresponding to a total of 300 serial interval observations. The case N~2 is biased by a large amount away from the true values, severely underestimating the infectious period parameter c and overestimating the exposed period parameter s. The N~3 case provides the best estimate of the parameters although there is still bias. Biases arising from using a model with Nw4 grow larger, with s underestimated and c overestimated. The serial interval is most sensitive to the mean exposed period, 1=s, and thus this is more accurately estimated. Although the parameter estimates from the three models are different, the estimated serial interval distributions corresponding to mean parameter estimates are all very similar (see Figure 3D ), thus so are the mean serial intervals. The fit using N~4 is the best in terms of the mean likelihood.",

These can be inferred as well, but as noted earlier k cannot be inferred easily because the serial interval distribution is not very sensitive to it. In contrast the serial interval distribution is typically very sensitive to the variance in the exposed period (j) so in practice the actual value is almost always recovered.

Specifically, we are interested in how the estimated posterior distribution depends on the number of observations available and how it can be skewed due to the random nature of the observations. To assess this we fit the full model to 8 sets of randomly generated serial interval distributions with 15, 50, 100, 200 and 300 data points respectively. The resulting posterior distributions are shown in Appendix B of File S1. The results of this show that exposed period parameter s is found accurately most of the time, even for very small sample sizes. The other two parameters, transmission parameter b and infectious period parameter c cannot be accurately determined until there are many more samples (typically at least 200). It is likely that we would need to include more of the later infection events within a household to resolve these parameters with more accuracy for smaller sample sizes.",

For these reasons it is commonly recorded during the early stages of a pandemic. The difficulty arises when attempting to use the observations for modelling, or inference, because the serial interval is the convolution of two processes: infection and incubation, and the infection time is effectively unobservable. In this paper we have provided methodology for parametrising a quite general Markovian model of household disease dynamics to serial interval data. Not only does this approach provide an estimate of the distribution of serial interval, but it also provides an estimate of a mechanistic model of the disease dynamics. This approach facilitates the prediction of disease dynamics and the assessment of alternative control options, of much importance in the early stages of disease invasion.",

By fitting to serial interval distributions stratified by household size we can can obtain accurate posterior distributions for all three of the basic parameters: transmission parameter b, exposed period parameter s, and infectious period parameter c. The parameter j, controlling the variance of the exposed period, can also be inferred, although we have not implemented this within the MCMC scheme. The serial interval distribution is relatively insensitive to the parameter k, controlling the variance in the infectious period, so we have not attempted to infer this and have held it constant. If full time series of symptomatic' events are available then our method is potentially wasteful because we do not use the later events. Our methods can be extended to inference of full time series and it is likely that this is required to get better estimates on the parameters b and c. Such a project is currently under way.",

This demonstrates that the methodology reliably produces estimates as would be obtained via traditional parametric fitting, but has the added benefit of producing estimates of parameters for our stochastic, mechanistic model of disease dynamics. Of course, one must be careful in using household quantities to make population level predictions [9] ; to do this we typically need to make more assumptions about population level mixing and transmission. In related work on antiviral effectiveness [6] we have used this method with a simpler model to effectively estimate the exposed period parameter s and infectious period parameter c from a larger influenza serial interval dataset [4] . Although this dataset was larger, the data was not stratified by household size, so we had to use a mean household size in our estimation. This then allowed us to evaluate posterior distributions for population level quantities such as the household basic reproductive number, R \u00c3 , and early growth rate [17, 21, 31] .",
