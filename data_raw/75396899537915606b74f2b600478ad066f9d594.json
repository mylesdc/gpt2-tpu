            "text": "Although many studies provide strong evidence supporting the development of HCV virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccines, the fact that heterologous viral vectors and/or multiple dosing regimes are required to induce protective immunity indicates that it is necessary to improve their immunogenicity. In this study, we have evaluated the use of an anionic self-adjuvanting lipopeptide containing the TLR2 agonist Pam 2 Cys (E 8 Pam 2 Cys) to enhance the immunogenicity of VLPs containing the HCV structural proteins (core, E1 and E2) of genotype 1a. While co-formulation of this lipopeptide with VLPs only resulted in marginal improvements in dendritic cell (DC) uptake, its ability to concomitantly induce DC maturation at very small doses is a feature not observed using VLPs alone or in the presence of an aluminium hydroxide-based adjuvant (Alum). Dramatically improved VLP and E2-specific antibody responses were observed in VLP+E 8 Pam 2 Cys vaccinated mice where up to 3 doses of non-adjuvanted or traditionally alum-adjuvanted VLPs was required to match the antibody titres obtained with a single dose of VLPs formulated with this lipopeptide. This result also correlated with significantly higher numbers of specific antibody secreting cells that was detected in the spleens of VLP+E 8 Pam 2 Cys vaccinated mice and greater ability of sera from these mice to neutralise the binding and uptake of VLPs by Huh7 cells. Moreover, vaccination of HLA-A2 transgenic mice with this formulation also induced better VLP-specific IFN-c-mediated responses compared to nonadjuvanted VLPs but comparable levels to that achieved when coadministered with complete freund's adjuvant. These results suggest overall that the immunogenicity of HCV VLPs can be significantly improved by the addition of this novel adjuvant by targeting their delivery to DCs and could therefore constitute a viable vaccine strategy for the treatment of HCV.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects an estimated 200 million individuals worldwide and contributes to significant morbidity and mortality rates associated with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Approximately 80% of infected individuals do not clear the virus following acute infection and will develop chronic infection that can lead to end-stage liver disease and complications. Although treatment options using a combination of pegylated interferon-a and ribavirin are available, sustained clearance of the virus is only achieved in approximately 40% of individuals infected with HCV genotype 1 and 60-70% of those who are infected with genotypes 2 or 3 [1] . Recent advances in the treatment of HCV using directly acting antiviral agents (DAAs) such as boceprevir and telaprevir have improved SVR rates in both treatment na\u00efve and experienced patients (reviewed in [2] ). However, treatment can be prolonged, expensive and also associated with substantial side effects. The development of an effective vaccine that can significantly reduce the number of new infections and improve sustained virological response rates could therefore be a useful adjunct to current therapeutic approaches and reduce the impact of infection on global health care systems.",

            "text": "Whilst the immune correlates mediating the clearance of virus are still not entirely clear or defined, there is substantial evidence demonstrating that the development of a broad multifunctional T cell response against an array of key viral proteins such as core, E1, NS3, NS4 and NS5 during acute HCV infection is associated with disease resolution [3, 4] and may also provide a level of protection against reinfection [5] . It is also becoming increasingly apparent that such responses alone are not enough [6] and that neutralising antibodies also play an integral role in conferring protection [7, 8] and facilitating viral clearance by mechanisms including antibodydependent cellular cytotoxic mechanisms [9] . An effective HCV vaccine will need to induce antibody and cell-mediated responses and also provide cross protection against different viral genotypes and quasispecies. Neutralising antibodies induced against conserved, conformational epitopes in the viral envelope E1 and E2 glycoproteins [10] [11] [12] , notably antigenic region 3 (AR3) [13] of E2, including the critical neutralisation contact residues contained within domain I of E2 [14] and amino acids 313-327 of E1 [15] , can be broadly cross-neutralising. The fact that these antibodies neutralise different HCV genotypes highlights the importance of including epitopes from both envelope proteins for a vaccine strategy to be effective.",

For example, it has been shown that vaccination with recombinant HCV envelope proteins expressed in mammalian cells, but not in yeast or insect cells, protect chimpanzees from primary infection by an homologous HCV isolate [20] . Similarly, Rosa et al have demonstrated that mammalian cell-derived recombinant envelope proteins bind to human cells with higher affinity than those produced in yeast or insect cells and appear to be antigenically and functionally similar to the viral proteins produced in an infected host cell [21] . More recently, vaccination of macaques using VLPs in a prime-boost regime has been reported to induce broadly neutralising antibody responses against different HCV genotypes [22] . Although all of these studies provide encouraging results supporting the development of HCV VLP-based vaccines, the fact that heterologous viral vectors and/or unrealistic dosing regimes are required to induce protective immunity indicates that it is necessary to improve their immunogenicity.",

Fmoc-lysine(Mtt)-OH (Novabiochem, L\u00e4ufelfingen, Switzerland) was first coupled to the support and the Fmoc protecting group present on the a-amino group then removed and Fmoc-lysine(Fmoc)-OH was then coupled to the exposed N-terminal amino group. Subsequent de-protection and acylation of another two rounds of Fmoc-lysine(Fmoc)-OH yielded eight branch points to which glutamic acid residues were coupled. The primary amino groups of the glutamic acid residues were then acetylated using a 20-fold excess of acetic anhydride and a 40-fold excess of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA; Sigma, Australia) to generate E 8 which has an overall charge of 28. Lipidation of E 8 was then carried out by removing the Mtt protective group present on the e-amino group of the C-terminal lysine followed by acylation of the exposed e-amino group with two serially added serine residues. The Pam 2 Cys lipid moiety was then coupled according to Zeng et al [25] to generate E 8 (Pam 2 Cys) ( Figure 1A ).",

Exposure of DCs to VLPs pre-mixed with the lipopeptide E 8 Pam 2 Cys also resulted in higher levels of cell fluorescence compared to untreated DCs. The percentage of fluorescenated cells in these cultures was similar to cultures that contained FITC-VLPs alone ( Figure 1C) .",

Of relevance to the present study, the use of adjuvants to enhance VLP immunogenicity has been shown to induce strong antibody responses using dose-sparing amounts of HIV [39] or Norwalk virus-derived VLPs [40] and also elicits cell-mediated were incubated with VLPs (5 mg) alone or formulated with E 8 Pam 2 Cys (0.01 nmoles/ml) or Alhydrogel (5 mg) in a total volume of 1 ml.

Not only are greater antibody titres induced following vaccination with VLPs formulated with E 8 Pam 2 Cys compared to the use of VLPs alone or when co-administered with Alhydrogel but up to 3 doses of nonadjuvanted or traditionally adjuvanted antigen were required to match the titres obtained with a single dose using lipopeptide. Most importantly in the context of HCV the trend translates to improved E2-specific antibody responses and the use of lower doses of VLPs to achieve this while maintaining efficacy has major advantages by providing cost benefits to vaccine manufacturers.",

Our previous work also demonstrated that association of antigen with charged lipopeptide facilitates trafficking of antigen to lymph Cys. Supernatants were clarified by centrifugation, incubated with Huh7 cells (5610 5 ) in a total volume of (500 ml) for 1 hour. Cells were then harvested and cellular fluorescence levels analysed by flow cytometry.

Splenocytes were obtained 28 days later and restimulated for 7 days in the presence of 10 mg VLPs or an irrelevant HCV-derived HLA-A2restricted epitope not part of the VLP construct. The frequency of peptide-specific T cells producing IFN-c was determined in an ELISPOT assay.

Coadministration of VLPs using charged lipopeptide has the added benefit of eliciting VLP-specific cell-mediated responses in HLA-A2 transgenic mice, a fact that may also be attributed to DC targeting and activation. Given the results of the work described in this study, we conclude that the use of this branched anionic lipopeptide together with VLPs containing HCV antigens in order to provide a broad spectrum of conformational epitopes can provide benefits in terms of inducing improved levels of neutralising antibody titres and eliciting cell-mediated responses. This strategy could therefore constitute a valuable addition to the armamentarium of current VLP-based vaccine developments against HCV. ",
