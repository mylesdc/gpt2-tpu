The mechanism used by the protein to restrict viral entry is unclear given the unavailability of the membrane topology and structures of the IFITM family proteins. Systematic site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies of IFITM3 in detergent micelles identified a single, long transmembrane helix in the C-terminus and an intramembrane segment in the N-terminal hydrophobic region. Solution NMR studies of the same sample verified the secondary structure distribution and demonstrated two rigid regions interacting with the micellar surface. The resulting membrane topology of IFITM3 supports the mechanism of an enhanced restricted membrane hemi-fusion.",

This family restricts a wide range of pathogenic viral infections, with different inhibitory extents for different viruses 1-3 . For example, IFITMs inhibit the cellular entry and replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the influenza A virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, the rabies, the West Nile virus, the dengue virus, the SARS corona virus, the Marburg virus, the Ebola virus, the Semlikiforest virus and other viruses 3-9 . Five members of the IFITM family have been identified in human cells, including IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM5 and IFITM10 10 . Among them, IFITM1, 2 and3 can be induced by both type-1 and type-2 interferons 2 . IFITM5 cannot be induced by interferons, but it is involved in bone mineralization 11 . The detailed function of IFITM10 remains unclear 12 . IFITM2 and 3 are typically concentrated in the endosomal membrane, the lysosomal membrane or other intracellular compartments. Their subcellular distributions depend on the cell or tissue type and their expression level, but IFITM1 is expressed mainly on the plasma membrane 13,14 .",

Moreover, post-translational modifications of IFITM3 were reported to regulate viral membrane fusion inhibition. S-palmitoylation of IFITM3 enhanced its membrane affinity and antiviral activity, whereas ubiquitination of IFITM3 decreased endo-lysosome localization and antiviral activity 17, 18 .",

Then, a total of 72 sequential residues (from W60 to Y132, except T65, which was not expressed after cysteine mutation) covering the two predicted hydrophobic regions were mutated to cysteine residues (supplementary Figure 1 ). All purified IFITM3 mutants in dodecyl-phosphocholine(DPC) micelles were identified in a monomeric state using SDS-PAGE, same as the wild-type (WT) IFITM3 protein (Fig. 1c) . The spin labeling reaction with methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) was subsequently performed to attach the side chain R1 to the IFITM3 mutants, showed as Fig. 1b 27 . Then, the systematic site-specific continuous wave (CW)-EPR spectra of spin-labeled IFITM3 were acquired in DPC micelles at ambient temperature(298K).",

Total of 71 CW-EPR spectra are presented in Fig. 2 , and the typical nitroxide three-line CW-EPR spectra of spin-labeled IFITM3 variants were observed. Although most of the spectra exhibited only one motional state, several residue sites (S61R1, L73R1, G74R1, A79R1, S81R1 and D92R1) had multiple components. For a clear presentation, spectra of spin labels at these residue sites were plotted in Fig. 3a , indicating the presence of both the immobilized (i) and mobilized (m) components. Interestingly, all these residues with multiple motional states were identified in the first half of the putative hydrophobic region(from W60 to G95 ), which strongly suggests that this segment adopts two different motional or conformational states. (a) Three different topology models proposed recently for IFITM3. The hydrophobic region of IFITM3 from W60 to Y132 was analyzed using EPR methods. (b) The spin labeling reaction for cysteine substituted IFITM3 mutants to introduce the nitroxide side chain, which is denoted R1. (c) SDS-PAGE analysis of IFITM3 in detergent micelles. Both wt-IFITM3 and IFITM3-W60C were purified as monomers in detergent micelles. Figure 2 . CW-EPR spectra of 72 spin-labeled Cysteine mutants, covering the hydrophobic region of human IFITM3 (form W60 to Y132, except T65). Spectra composed of multiple components were highlighted with \uf0ea. All spectra were normalized by the height of the central peak. The CW-EPR spectra exhibit multi-components in detergent micelles. \"i\" and \"m\" represent the \"immobile\" and \"mobile\" components, respectively. (b,c) represent the oxygen accessibility (\u03a0 O2 ) and NiEDDA accessibility (\u03a0 NiEDDA ) of the hydrophobic region of IFITM3 in detergent micelles. Sine waves with a periodicity of 3.6 were drawn to indicate the \u03b1 -helix secondary structure. (d) The membrane immersion depth (\u03a6 ) of sequential residues span the hydrophobic region of IFITM3 in detergent micelles. The grey region represents the putative transmembrane region and the dashed line indicates the suggested membrane interface. Then, EPR power saturation studies were conducted as shown in supplementary Figure 2 . These experiments illustrate the accessibility of spin radical side chains, which can be used to derive secondary structure and the membrane topology information of proteins 24, 29, 30 . The systematic accessibility parameters (\u03a0 ) were investigated for the sequential residues (form W60 to Y132, except T65), covering the two putative hydrophobic regions of IFITM3. Oxygen in the air was used as the hydrophobic paramagnetic reagent to evaluate membrane exposure, while NiEDDA served as the hydrophilic paramagnetic reagent to study the extent of aqueous exposure. \u03a0 O2 and \u03a0 NiEDDA were plotted against the residue numbers in Fig. 3b ,c. As we can see, the \u03a0 NiEDDA values progressively decreased from A98 to G114, followed by a lower flat region (from I115 to I121). Then, the \u03a0 NiEDDA values increased from residue I122 to A131. On the contrary, the value of \u03a0 O2 first increased starting from residue A98 and then slowly decreased. These two typical changing patterns of \u03a0 O2 and \u03a0 NiEDDA demonstrated that a highly hydrophobic transmembrane region exists in IFITM3 starting from residue A98 to A131 in detergent micelles. However, no similar patterns in the accessibility parameters (both \u03a0 O2 and \u03a0 NiEDDA ) were observed in the first half of the putative hydrophobic region (from W60 to G95), indicating that no transmembrane property exist in this segment of IFITM3. Moreover, a close examination of the accessibility parameter values (\u03a0 O2 and \u03a0 NiEDDA ) of the spin labeled residues revealed some periodic behaviors. The periodicity covered the residues from A96 to A131 in Fig. 3b ,c, indicating that this segment adopts an \u03b1 -helical secondary structure in detergent micelles. In addition, the accessibility parameter values of two short segments (L62-F67 and I76-R85) in the N-terminal region were also observed with same periodicity, suggesting that two short \u03b1 -helices potentially exist in this segments. Moreover, the immersion depth parameter (\u03a6 ) was derived from the conjugated accessibility parameters of \u03a0 O2 and \u03a0 NiEDDA 29 . As shown in Fig. 3d , the \u03a6 values of the residues covering the entire putative hydrophobic region of IFITM3 can be separated into two apparently different patterns. In the first pattern starting from W60 to G95, the \u03a6 value fluctuated around a relatively low value, indicating that the residues in this segment were partially buried in the micelles. However, the second pattern highlighted in gray ( Fig. 3d ) was totally different ( the \u03a6 values progressively increased from residue A98 to T118, followed by a decrease until residue Y132), indicating that a transmembrane segment was embedded in this region of IFITM3. Collectively, the analysis of the accessibility parameter (\u03a0 O2 and \u03a0 NiEDDA ) and the immersion depth parameter (\u03a6 ) derived from the power saturation experiments demonstrated that the IFITM3 protein contains a long transmembrane \u03b1 -helix covering the residue sequence from A96 to A131 in the putative hydrophobic region. This coincides with the previously predicted topology I and topology III model, but totally different from the topology II model (Fig. 1a) . At the same time, two short \u03b1 -helices without transmembrane properties were observed in the first half of the putative hydrophobic region, which was similar to the predicted topology model I or model II (Fig. 1a) . Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3a , several residues in the first half of the putative hydrophobic region were revealed to contain multi-motional states by the CW-EPR spectra. Thus, our EPR analysis of IFITM3 in detergent micelles suggested that IFITM3 might adopt a membrane topology structure similar to the topology model I in Fig. 1a .",

            "text": "Solution NMR structure determination and backbone relaxation analysis of IFITM3. With information on the secondary structure and membrane topology of IFITM3 as determined by the EPR studies, solution NMR studies were also conducted to determine the atomic resolution structure of IFITM3 in DPC micelles. The backbone chemical shift assignments ( 1 H, 15 N, 13 CO, 13 C \u03b1 , and 13 C \u03b2 ) of full-length IFITM3 protein in DPC micelles were achieved using series of two-and three-dimensional solution NMR spectra (Fig. S3 ). Heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the specifically 15 N labeled amino acid ( 15 N-Leucine, 15 N-Isoleucine, 15 N-Valine, 15 N-Methionine or 15 N-Phenylalanine) in the IFITM3 samples were acquired to assist the residue assignments (Fig. S4 ). Based on the backbone chemical shift values of assigned residues, the program TALOS + was used to estimate the secondary structure of IFITM3 31 . As shown in Fig. 4a , three segments with relatively large negative TALOS + index values were obtained, representing three \u03b1 -helix segment. The remainder of the IFITM3 protein exhibited TALOS + index values close to zero, indicating a random coil. Compared with the previously predicted topology model that contains two long hydrophobic regions, the first two short \u03b1 -helixes of IFITM3 resided in the first putative hydrophobic region while the third long \u03b1 -helix correspond to the second putative hydrophobic region. To further verify the secondary structure, backbone relaxation analysis of IFITM3 was performed. As shown in Fig. 4c , residues with small T2 values were mainly observed in three regions, suggesting high backbone rigidity. This finding is consistent with the \u03b1 -helix structure predicted by program TALOS + in the same region. While most residues in the N-terminus have large T2 values, indicating high flexibility property of the backbone. Thus, the overall results were consistent with the derived secondary structure of IFITM3 as determined by TALOS + analysis (Fig. 4) . However, the final atomic resolution structure of full-length IFITM3 could not be obtained, mainly due to the lack of an adequate number of NOE restraints and the intrinsic random coil structure in the N-terminal region. Instead, low resolution structural topology of full-length IFITM3, especially the putative hydrophobic region, can still be derived from the limited NMR data. As shown in Supplementary Figure 5 , an ensembles of 10 conformers with the lowest energy and best convergence were selected from 100 calculated structures of the N-terminally truncated IFITM3 (from W60 to A131). A kink or unusual dihedral angles could be found in the C-terminal of the transmembrane helix, which were probably derived from the unassigned residues nearby and the existence of Pro125 ( Figure S5 ). When superimposing the relatively long C-terminal \u03b1 -helix (from A96 to A131), the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values of the backbone atoms and heavy atoms were 3.139 \u00c5 and 2.985 \u00c5, respectively. For a clear presentation of the structure and predicted membrane topology of the putative hydrophobic region of IFITM3, one conformer was selected out (Fig. 5a ). The structural model of IFITM3 shows that a long C-terminal transmembrane helix and two short intramembrane \u03b1 -helices in the N-terminal of the hydrophobic region was connected by a small flexible loop between them, which is perfectly consistent with the structural topology derived from the EPR analysis. Taken together with the EPR and solution NMR results, we conclude that the hydrophobic region of IFITM3 adopts a topology containing two short intramembrane \u03b1 -helices followed by a long transmembrane \u03b1 -helix (Fig. 5b) .",

The results from flow cytometry experiments and cell surface immune-staining experiments argued that IFITM3 is a dual-transmembrane protein with both its N-and C-termini exposed to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen or extracellular space (Model III of Fig. 1a) 3, 19 .

At the C-terminus of human IFITM3, a long \u03b1 -helix covering residues from A96 to A131 spans through the micelles. While two short discrete intramembrane \u03b1 -helices were discovered in the first predicted hydrophobic segment of IFITM3. As shown in Fig. 3d , the EPR immersion depth (\u03a6 ) data demonstrated that these two short \u03b1 -helices possessed no transmembrane properties, but only buried partially in the micelles. And the relatively larger \u03a6 values of the residues in the second short helix indicated that it might be more deeply buried in micelles than the first short helix. Moreover, the random coil property of the N-terminus of IFITM3 was revealed by NMR analysis.",

Here in our topology structure of IFITM3 in micelles, two short intramembrane \u03b1 -helices were discovered in the first predicted hydrophobic region. These two short helices were likely to induce membrane curvature when they inserted into only one leaflet of the lipid bilayers (Fig. 5b) , although lipid bilayers adopt different curvature and membrane thickness from micelles. Hence, our membrane topology of IFITM3 could provide direct structural evidence to support the antiviral mechanism proposed by Li et al. Moreover, three types of post-translational modifications have been reported to regulate the antiviral activity through influencing the subcellular localization, trafficking, clustering or interaction with potential receptors. The S-palmitoylation occurs at Cysteines 71, 72 and 105 17 , and ubiquitination takes place at Lysines 24, 83, 88 and 104 18 , whereas Tyrosine 20 is phosphorylated 8, 34 . These post-translational modifications can only occur when these residues are exposed to cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which is consistent with our IFITM3 structure and proposed membrane topology model (Fig. 5b) , with an intracellular N-terminal domain and an intramembrane segment facing the cytoplasm. Moreover, CW-EPR spectra analysis indicated that residues with multi-motional or multi-conformational states all resided in the intramembrane hydrophobic segments (W60-G95). We suggested that the multi-conformational property of the intramembrane hydrophobic segments might closely relate to its multiple roles in post-translational modifications, such as different structural states might interact with different enzymes.",
