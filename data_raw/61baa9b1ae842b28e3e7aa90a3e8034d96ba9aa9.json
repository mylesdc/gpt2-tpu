By the application of reverse genetic manipulation of an infectious PRRSV clone, the current study is the first to demonstrate that Nsp12 is a key component of PRRSV replication. In addition, the biochemical properties of Nsp12 were evaluated, revealing that Nsp12 forms dimers when exposed to oxidative conditions. Furthermore, we systemically analyzed the function of Nsp12 in PRRSV RNA synthesis using a strand-specific PCR method. To our surprise, Nsp12 was not found to be involved in minus-strand genomic RNA (-gRNA) synthesis; importantly, our results indicate that Nsp12 is involved in the synthesis of both plus-and minus-strand subgenomic mRNAs (+sgmRNA and -sgmRNA). Finally, we found that the combination of cysteine 35 and cysteine 79 in Nsp12 is required for sgmRNA synthesis. To our knowledge, we are the first to report the biological role of Nsp12 in the PRRSV lifecycle, and we conclude that Nsp12 is involved in the synthesis of both + sgRNA and -sgRNA.",

The genomic RNA encodes RNA replicases (ORF1a and ORF1b), glycoproteins GP 2 to GP 5, the integral membrane protein M, and the nucleocapsid protein N (ORFs 2-7) [1] . ORFs 2-7 have been extensively investigated [1] [2] [3] , and an increasing number of studies have focused on ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode polyproteins that are processed into smaller protein products designated as nonstructural proteins (Nsps). The roles for most Nsps in PRRSV have been explored to date, and Nsp1\u03b1/\u03b2, Nsp2, Nsp4 and Nsp11 have been implicated in modulating host immune responses to PRRSV infection [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . In addition, Nsp1 function is related to subgenomic mRNA synthesis regulation [10] , and Nsp2 and Nsp3 are involved in inducing replication-associated membrane rearrangement [11, 12] . Moreover, the Nsp9 RNA polymerase and Nsp10 helicase are key enzymes for arterivirus RNA synthesis and are reportedly responsible for the virulence of highly pathogenic PRRSV [13] . The roles of Nsps in viral pathogenesis and host immunity are also being explored.",

Dong et al. investigated the Nsp12 interactome with cellular proteins, verified the interaction between the cellular chaperone HSP70 and Nsp12, and demonstrated that Nsp12 recruits HSP70 to maintain its own stability and promote viral replication [14] . Recently, Li et al. reported that porcine galectin-3 (GAL3) interacts with Nsp12 and showed that GAL3 overexpression significantly suppresses the replication of type 1 and 2 PRRSV strains [15] . Nsp12 was also found to induce the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10), which may contribute to PRRSV pathogenesis [16] . However, all of these studies focused on the interaction of host proteins with Nsp12, but no information describes how Nsp12 participates in the replication phase of the PRRSV lifecycle. A recent study attempting to explore the interaction network involving most PRRSV Nsps demonstrated that Nsp12 may serve as a hub of the Nsp interactome along with Nsp9 [17] ; this study also indicated that Nsp12 may be a major component of the replication and transcription complexes (RTCs) [17] .",

As shown in Figure 1A , the coding region for Nsp12 is located at the end of ORF1b, at an MOI of 0.01; 72 h later, the supernatants were collected and pelleted twice through a 30% sucrose cushion, after which the purified virions were fractionated using 10% to 35% sucrose cushions. Samples were collected from the top to the bottom and analyzed by Western blotting. These experiments were performed three times, and a representative result is shown. and the protein is cleaved from the ORF1ab large polyprotein by Nsp4 [26] . To assess whether Nsp12 is a key component of PRRSV replication, we introduced triple continuous stop codons into the N terminal region (6-8 amino acids) to abrogate the translation of nsp12; we designated this clone HuN4-F5-Del-Nsp12 ( Figure  1B) . After confirmation by DNA sequencing, we transfected both the HuN4-F5 and HuN4-F5-Del-Nsp12 infectious clones into MARC-145 cells and detected the N protein of PRRSV by immunofluorescence. The result indicated that Nsp12 is required for PRRSV replication (Figure 1C ), which was confirmed by Western blotting ( Figure 1D ). We next determined whether Nsp12 is conserved in PRRSV by comparing the Nsp12 amino acid sequences of different type II PRRSV strains, including two classic strains, VR-2332 and CH-la, and the highly pathogenic strains HuN4, JXA1, NADC30 and NADC34. As shown in Figure   1E , Nsp12 sequences are highly conserved in PRRSV regardless of whether the strain is classic or highly pathogenic, suggesting that Nsp12 may play an important role in the PRRSV lifecycle.",

After transfection, we found that Nsp12 could form dimers and even polymers; this ability was similar to that of the N protein of PRRSV [22, 27] , which was used as a positive control (Figure 2A and B) . However, Nsp12 dimer formation was significantly blocked when reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and 2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME) were added (Figure 2A and B) , indicating that dimerization is mediated by covalent disulfide bonds. There are three cysteines at positions 29 (Cys29), 35 (Cys35), and 79 (Cys79) of Nsp12 that may contribute to dimer formation. Thus, we replaced all of the cysteines with alanine, either singly or in combination (Fig. S1A) , and found that only the triple cysteine mutation completely blocked dimer formation ( Fig.  S1B and C) , suggesting that any cysteine in Nsp12 can form disulfide linkages. N protein homodimerization occurs upon exposure to the oxidizing extracellular environment after cell lysis [22] ; to evaluate whether Nsp12 has similar biochemical properties, transfected cells were harvested in lysis buffer in the presence or absence of 1 mM Nethylmaleimide (NEM), a small membrane-permeable compound that can irreversibly modify the free thiols of cysteine residues, thereby preventing de novo disulfide bond formation. In the presence of NEM, we did not detect dimerization of either the N protein or Nsp12 ( Figure 2C and D), indicating that Nsp12 dimerization occurs under oxidizing conditions. We next investigated whether the disulfide bonds of Nsp12 can be detected in extracellular virions, similar to the N protein [22] . To detect whether Nsp12 has the potential to incorporate into virions, purified virions were fractionated using 10% to 35% sucrose cushions, and samples were collected from the top to the bottom and analyzed by Western blot. Using the N protein as a positive control, no Nsp12 was observed in highly purified virus particles ( Figure 2E ). These results indicate that Nsp12 has an intrinsic ability to form disulfide bonds but only under oxidizing conditions in cell lysates.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that Nsp12 may be involved in viral -gRNA synthesis. The PRRSV infectious clone used in this study is very large and difficult to transfect. Because the transfection efficacy of BHK cells was higher than that of MARC145 cells, we used the former cells in this study. To investigate the involvement of Nsp12 in viral gRNA synthesis, we transfected BHK cells with HuN4-F5 and HuN4-F5-Del-Nsp12, respectively, isolated total cellular RNA at 24 hpt, and used a strand-specific PCR method to detect + gRNA and -gRNA as previously described [24, 25] . The reverse transcription primers, PCR primers and PCR products are depicted in Figure 3 (upper panel). To our surprise, the + gRNA and -gRNA of HuN4-F5-Del-Nsp12 was not affected (Figure 3A and B) . To confirm this, we further detected gRNA by qPCR and obtained similar results ( Figure 3C and D) . We next examined whether + sgmRNA and -sgmRNA were affected, and the results showed that both + sgmRNA and -sgmRNA were abolished when Nsp12 was inactivated ( Figure 3E and F). The above data demonstrate that Nsp12 is involved in viral sgmRNA synthesis but not in gRNA synthesis.",

We replaced three cysteines in the PRRSV HuN4 infectious clone with alanine by reverse genetic manipulation to produce PRRSV HuN4-F5-C29/35/79A and found that these three cysteines were critical for PRRSV replication ( Figure 4A and B) . Strand-specific PCR analysis indicated that -gRNA was not affected ( Figure 4C and D) but that the sgmRNA synthesis of HuN4-F5-C29/ 35/79A was completely blocked ( Figure 4E and F). We next assessed whether single and double cysteine mutations affected viral replication by constructing six mutant clones: HuN4-F5-C29A, HuN4-F5-C35A, HuN4-F5-C79A, HuN4-F5-C29/35A, HuN4-F5-C29/ 79A and HuN4-F5-C35/79A. According to the results, the single cysteine mutations (C29A, C35A and C79A) successfully rescued the virus, as did the double cysteine mutations C29/35A and C29/79A ( Figure 5A and B). However, to our surprise, we failed to rescue the virus with the recombinant clone HuN4-F5-C35/ 79A ( Figure 5A and B) , indicating that the combination of C35 and C79 in Nsp12 is critical for PRRSV replication. Further analysis indicated that the sgmRNA synthesis of HuN4-F5-C35/79A was also blocked. Thus, the combination of C35 and C79 in Nsp12 is crucial for PRRSV sgmRNA synthesis ( Figure  5E and F).",

Arterivirus RNA synthesis requires the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) [12, 32] , which provide replication sites for RTC formation [33, 34] . It has been proposed that Nsp2, Nsp3 and Nsp5 of arteriviruses participate in modulating membrane curvature and DMV formation [12, 35] . PRRSV is closely related to EAV, and Nsp2, Nsp3, and Nsp5 of PRRSV may also have the same roles in DMV formation [17] . As the arterivirus RNA polymerase, Nsp9 has been recognized as a core component of RTCs, and PRRSV Nsp9 plays a central role in the RTC machinery and interacts with the N protein [36] , Nsp7\u03b1 [37] , Nsp1\u03b1, Nsp1\u03b2, Nsp3, Nsp7\u03b2, Nsp8, Nsp11, and Nsp12 [17] . Furthermore, RNA synthesis efficiency correlates closely with Nsp9 and consistently with PRRSV virulence [13, 38, 39] . Nonetheless, arterivirus sgmRNA synthesis depends on the Nsp1 autoprotease [10, 40, 41] . PRRSV Nsp1\u03b1 reportedly binds directly to Nsp9 [17] , and EAV Nsp1 controls the accumulation of full-length and subgenome-length minus-strand templates for viral mRNA synthesis [42] . We speculate that the component necessary for PRRSV gRNA synthesis differs from that required for sgmRNA synthesis, which may be the reason that gRNA is not influenced by Nsp12. However, further exploration is needed.",

We speculate that C35 and C79 of Nsp12 may be located at an interface motif that interacts with other proteins (including viral or host proteins) critical for PRRSV sgmRNA synthesis, whereby double mutation in this region abolishes these interactions. Similar to the lack of a direct association between the RNA helicase (Nsp10) and Nsp9, there may be indirect interaction of PRRSV Nsp10 with Nsp9 via Nsp12 [17] . A recent study demonstrated multiple interactions of Nsp12 with viral Nsps, suggesting that Nsp12 likely plays an important role in the viral RNA synthesis process as a crucial component of the RTC. Furthermore, double mutation of the two cysteines may also directly influence the folding and function of nsp12 even though the two residues are not on the protein surface.",
