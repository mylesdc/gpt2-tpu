The continual outbreaks of MERS-CoV highlight the importance of developing antiviral therapeutics. Here, we rationally designed a novel fusion inhibitor named MERS-five-helix bundle (MERS-5HB) derived from the six-helix bundle (MERS-6HB) which was formed by the process of membrane fusion. MERS-5HB consists of three copies of heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and two copies of heptad repeat 2 (HR2) while MERS-6HB includes three copies each of HR1 and HR2. As it lacks one HR2, MERS-5HB was expected to interact with viral HR2 to interrupt the fusion step. What we found was that MERS-5HB could bind to HR2P, a peptide derived from HR2, with a strong affinity value (K D ) of up to 0.24 nM. Subsequent assays indicated that MERS-5HB could inhibit pseudotyped MERS-CoV entry effectively with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of about 1 \u00b5M. In addition, MERS-5HB significantly inhibited spike (S) glycoprotein-mediated syncytial formation in a dose-dependent manner. Further biophysical characterization showed that MERS-5HB was a thermo-stable \u03b1-helical secondary structure. The inhibitory potency of MERS-5HB may provide an attractive basis for identification of a novel inhibitor against MERS-CoV, as a potential antiviral agent.",

MERS-CoV causes severe respiratory disease in the lower respiratory tract and is often accompanied by renal failure, showing similar clinical, epidemiological, and virological features to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which widely spread in China in 2003 [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . As of June 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been notified of 2037 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV and at least 710 deaths related to MERS-CoV, showing a much higher fatality rate (about 35%) [7] compared to SARS-CoV (less than 10%) [2, 3] . Since September 2012, 27 countries have reported cases of MERS-CoV globally while most cases were found in Saudi Arabia [8, 9] . Various therapeutics including peptide inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, and vaccines are under development for the treatment and prevention of MERS-CoV [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, there are still no licensed vaccines or antiviral agents against MERS-CoV approved for human use. Therefore, development of efficient countermeasures to curb the spread of MERS-CoV is of great importance.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus and belongs to the lineage C betacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae [16] . Its spike glycoprotein (S) is a class I membrane fusion protein, and contains a surface subunit (S1) and a transmembrane subunit (S2). S1 is in charge of receptor binding, while S2 mediates membrane fusion. MERS-CoV initiates infection through the interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 and the receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) [17] [18] [19] [20] . Then, S2 changes conformation by inserting its N-terminal fusion peptide into the host cell membrane, after which three heptad repeat 1 (HR1)segments and three heptad repeat 2 (HR2) segments form a six-helix bundle (MERS-6HB) fusion core [10, 11] . The three HR1s constitute the central homotrimeric core, and the three HR2s surround the core at the HR1 side grooves in an antiparallel manner. This strong interaction of HR1s and HR2s brings the viral and cell membranes close to each other which triggers fusion. Disrupting the process of MERS-6HB formation can inhibit cell-cell fusion, which leads to abortion of the viral infection. Based on this mechanism, several peptide inhibitors against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV derived from HR2 have been identified, such as P1 [10] , HR2P [11] and CP-1 [21] , which prevent the formation of the fusion core by competitively binding to HR1 and blocking the native interaction between HR1 and HR2. Hence, we have put forward an idea that the blockage of fusion core formation could also be achieved through binding to native HR2 by a foreign inhibitor. Therefore, we designed a potential inhibitor named MERS-five-helix bundle (MERS-5HB) including three HR1s and two HR2s. Since MERS-5HB lacks one HR2 segment when compared to MERS-6HB, it is intended to bind with native HR2 in S2 and prevent the formation of the fusion core. A series of experiments were performed to verify our rational design.",

The gene of MERS-5HB was synthesized as a codon of HR1-SGGRGG-HR2-GGSGGSGG-HR1-SGGRGG-HR2-GGSGGSGG-HR1 and subcloned into the vector pET-28a(+) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for expression in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen). The bacteria were grown at 37 \u2022 C in 2\u00d7 to an optical density (OD 600 ) of 0.8 and induced with 1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 22 \u2022 C for 8 h. The cells were harvested and re-suspended in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) containing 500 mM NaCl, then lysed with 1% Triton X-100 by ultrasonication on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and the supernatant was passed over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) Resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) column pre-equilibrated with PBS containing 500 mM NaCl. The protein was eluted with different concentrations of imidazole. Purified protein was concentrated to a proper concentration determined by the experimental requirements and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C for further analysis.",

In order to accurately determine the binding affinity of MERS-HR2P to MERS-5HB, biolayer interferometry was conducted. The optical sensors were prepared in advance, and consisted of a small length of optical fiber with streptavidin modified on the top. The biotinylated MERS-HR2P was immobilized on the top of the streptavidin biosensors, and the interactions with MERS-5HB at six different concentrations were monitored ( Figure 2C ). The interaction kinetics result showed that the KD value was 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u221210 M, the association rate constant was 5.26 \u00d7 10 4 \u00b1 1.41 \u00d7 10 2 M \u22121 s \u22121 , and the dissociation rate constant was 1.26 \u00d7 10 \u22125 \u00b1 7.78 \u00d7 10 \u22127 s \u22121 . This demonstrated that the interaction between MERS-5HB and MERS-HR2P is strong and specific, which could make it possible for MERS-5HB to inhibit virus entry as we expected. Heptad repeat 1 (HR1) (residues 984 to 1062) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) (residues 1245 to 1289) are from the major parts of HR1 (residues 984 to 1105) and HR2 (residues 1246 to 1296) domains in the S2 subunit. MERS-5HB contains three HR1 segments and two HR2 segments. The linker of HR1 to HR2 is SGGRGG and the linker of HR2 to HR1 is GGSGGSGG. (B) Models of the MERS-CoV fusion core (MERS-6HB) (PDB: 4MOD [10] ) (left) and MERS-5HB (right). As a solved crystal structure, the six-helix bundle contains three HR1 segments (shown in blue) which form a central core, and three HR2 segments (shown in cyan) which pack into the HR1 side grooves.",
