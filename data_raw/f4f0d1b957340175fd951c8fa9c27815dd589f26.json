However, whether DMGF suppresses tumor metastasis is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-metastatic activities of DMGF on the metastatic processes of melanoma cells in vivo and in vitro. A transwell assay showed that DMGF could effectively attenuate the motility of B16F10 cells, and the results of real-time PCR revealed that DMGF also suppressed the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Moreover, DMGF did not influence tube formation but inhibited the migration of endothelial cells. Furthermore, animal models were used to monitor the effects of DMGF on tumor metastasis, and all models showed that DMGF significantly suppressed the metastatic behaviors of B16F10 cells, including intravasation, colonization, and invasion of the lymphatic duct. In addition, DMGF could also reduce the densities of the blood vessels in the tumor area in vivo. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms of anti-metastatic activity revealed that DMGF can down-regulate the levels of key modulators of the Cdc42/Rac1 pathway to interfere in F-actin polymerization and suppress the formation of lamellipodia by reducing the phosphorylation of CREB.",

Among polyphenolic substances, biflavonoids have potent anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-virus, anti-microbial, vasorelaxant and anticlotting properties [1] . Currently, many biflavonoids exhibit bioactive functions, and the mechanisms of such effects have been explored. For example, the amentoflavone derived from Selaginella tamariscina or Torreya nucifera has been shown to not only have potent anticandidal or anti-SARS-coV activities [2, 3] , but also exhibits anti-neovascularization by interfering in the interaction of VEGF and VEGFR-1 [4, 5] . In addition, 7,7\"-dimethoxyagastisflavone (DMGF, the structure was shown as Figure 1A ) has been found to have anti-HSV-1 and -HSV-2 activity [6] , and it can cause the cell death via apoptosis or autophagy [7] . Moreover, ginkgetin is a strong NF-\u03baB inhibitor (IC50 = 7.5 \u03bcM) [8] , and it selectively inhibits the growth of human ovarian adenocarcinoma [9] . Moreover, morelloflavone has anti-oxidative, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties [10] , and it was recently shown to inhibit tumor angiogenesis by targeting Rho GTPases and the ERK signaling pathway [11] . Therefore, the biflavonoids in these traditional medical plants are a potential source of new therapies for many human diseases.",

Thus, the development of anti-metastasis drugs is important and necessary. However, tumor metastasis is a complex process and consists of a series of sequential steps [12] in which cell movement, extravasation [13] , and expressions of matrix metalloproteinases [14] are important processes that result in systemic spread. In addition, angiogenesis is not only required for nourishment and the removal of metabolic wastes from the tumor region, but it also facilitates tumor metastasis. Thus, chemoprotective drugs that can simultaneously inhibit the processes of metastasis and angiogenesis may provide better chemotherapeutic efficiency by inhibiting tumor spread.",

By analyzing the promoters of these DMGF-effective genes for the binding sites of transcriptional factors listed on GeneCards (http:// www.genecards.org), the results showed that only one transcriptional factor binding site is displayed on all 5 promoter sequences of these genes-CREB. According to this information, we examined the interaction of DMGF and CREB by bioinformatics tool and the results predicted DMGF would interact with several residuals in CREB (PDB code: 2LXT) including Arg131, Pro132, Tyr134, Lys136, Ile137, Tyr658, Gln661 and Lys662 ( Figure 8A ). Therefore, the phosphorylation on Ser133 of CREB may be interfered by DMGF. Consecutively, we further examined the CREB protein expression level and its phosphorylation after DMGF treatment. The results showed that DMGF did not notably decrease CREB protein expression, and CREB was only minorly reduced after DMGF treatment ( Figure 8B ). However, the results indicated that phosphorylation at Ser133 of CREB was suppressed by DMGF treatment ( Figure 8B ). These results revealed that DMGF could interfere with phosphorylation on the Ser133 of CREB which involves in the transcriptional activity.

Hicksii [7] ; however, little is known about its functions in tumor angiogenesis, metastasis and tumor growth except for its effect on inducing tumor death through apoptosis or autophagy in different cancer cells [7] . In this study, the DMGF was shown to dramatically suppress the spontaneous metastasis of B16F10 melanoma cells from subcutaneous sites to the spleen ( Figure 4 ). Another two in vivo animal models further indicated that DMGF could suppress the processes of metastasis, including colonization from blood Oncotarget 60051 www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget circulation ( Figure 5 ) or invasion/intravasation into the lymph system ( Figure 6 ). These results showed that the decrease in the metastasis of melanoma cells may result from low migratory ability ( Figure 1B ) because DMGF could reduce the formation of lamellipodia ( Figure 7A ) by interfering with F-actin polymerization by lowering the phosphorylation of CREB to suppress the expression of Cdc42/Rac pathway associated genes (Figures 7 and 8 ). This study is the first to show the medical potency of DMGF to suppress the metastasis of melanoma.",

Flavonoids such as quercetin and EGCG have been shown to decrease the expression of both MMP2 and MMP9 in human melanoma cells [16] and breast cancer [20] , respectively. These flavonoids inhibit the activities of both MMP2 and MMP9. However, 1 mg/ml DMGF only significantly suppressed the expression of MMP-2, but not MMP-9, at 12 h. Perhaps the dosages needed to inhibit the expression of MMP-2 or MMP-9 are different. The other possibility is that the mechanism by which DMGF suppresses MMP expression may be different from these flavonoids; it may suppress the signals needed by the MMP2 expression pathway.",

Tumor cells utilize this organelle to explore and move into the surrounding environment, then form invasive matrix-degrading structures [21] . In addition, the Rac1 or Cdc42 pathways can lead to the formation of membrane lamellipodia or filopodia, respectively, and have been shown to regulate a variety of biological functions, including changes in cell shape, adhesion, and motility, through the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton [22, 23] . Recently, the literature demonstrated that some flavonoids could suppress such cell activity.

Moreover, 30 \u00b5M luteolin Oncotarget 60053 www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget inhibits the migration of human glioblastoma U-87 MG and T98G cells through the down-regulation of Cdc42 gene expression and ERK protein phosphorylation [24] . Moreover, 60 \u00b5M wogonin could suppress cell migration and actin remodeling of B16F10 cells by inhibiting the expression of Rac1 [25] . Here, the F-actin of the DMGFtreated B16F10 cells was remarkably disintegrated (Figure 7A) , and the formation of lamellipodia was decreased to influence the cell's shape in vitro ( Figure 7A) . Sequentially, the expression of the relative genes in Cdc42/ Rac1 pathways were examined, and the results showed that the expression of all relative genes was down-regulated by DMGF treatments ( Figure 7B ). Taken together, the decrease in the expressions of genes in Cdc42/Rac1 pathway may involve in the blockade of cell migration and invasion for DMGF's anti-metastatic activity as other flavonoids.",

Only one factor, CREB, was proposed to regulate the expression of all relative genes. Therefore, it was assumed that DMGF may reduce the phosphorylation or expression of CREB to down-regulate the expression levels of the genes related to the Cdc42/Rac1 pathway. Sequentially, our data fit with such suppositions. Figure 8A showed that DMGF treatments reduced the phosphorylation at Ser133 of CREB, but it did not influence the expression of CREB protein, which is in accord with the bioinformatics result which DMGF interacted with the amino acids near Ser133 of CREB ( Figure 8B ). These results indicated that the transcriptional activity of CREB would be decreased by DMGF. As previously reported, the metastatic phenotype of melanoma could benefit from the expression of CREB transcription factors [26] . Moreover, Xie et al. also demonstrated the decrease of CREB activity in metastatic melanoma cells by a dominant-negative form of CREB (KCREB), which led to a decrease in their tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in nude mice [27] . Moreover, a p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) inhibitor, PF-3758309, Oncotarget 60055 www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget could suppress migration and invasion by reducing the phosphorylation of CREB and ERK1/2 [28] .

Tumor angiogenesis could provide an escape route for those tumor cells that can loosen themselves from the primary tumor to new sites via new vessels [29] . Figure 3 shows in vivo DMGF treatment reduced the formation of new vessels and caused a decrease in the intensity of vessels in tumor areas. In vitro, DMGF could inhibit neovascularization by suppressing the motility of SVEC4-10 endothelial cells but not influencing the capillary-like tube formation in endothelial cells in vitro ( Figure 2B and 2C) . Therefore, we assume that DMGF could inhibit angiogenesis at early stages, and its anti-angiogenesis activity may also result from the blocking movement of the endothelial cells. Interestingly, the published literature also shows that two biflavonoids, amentoflavone (AF) and morelloflavone (MF), have anti-angiogenic activities. However, these reports only focus on the anti-angiogenic abilities of the two biflavonoids, but not their anti-metastatic effects. The anti-angiogenic activity of AF is due to its ability to bind VEGF-A and VEGF-B, preventing the interaction with VEGF receptors [5] ; however, our data indicated that DMGF did not impact VEGF-induced capillary-like tube formation in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells ( Figure 2B ). Based on this different effect, we thought that DMGF may not bind to VEGF to prevent interactions with VEGF receptors for anti-angiogenesis. In addition, MF could inhibit the activation of Raf/MEK/ERK protein kinases and suppress the activation of AP-1 and p90RSK [11] . DMGF could suppress the phosphorylation of CREB, which is also an event downstream of ERK activation. Therefore, we assume that DMGF may inhibit both tumor angiogenesis by blocking the ERK/pCREB pathway in the same way as MF.",

DMGF inhibited the cell proliferation of SVEC4-10 as well as B16F10. SVEC4-10 is a highly proliferative endothelial cell line derived by SV40 transformation of endothelial cells. Therefore, SVEC4-10 is sensitive as B16F10 cells. However, in our previous results, DMGF had different antiproliferative effects between cancer cell lines and primary cells, including human PBMCs and mouse splenocytes [7] . These results showed that DMGF has selective cytotoxicity between normal and tumor cells. Thus, DMGF was assumed to be a novel chemoprevention drug with limited toxicity in normal tissues. Here, we first reported that DMGF has could suppress metastasis, including angiogenesis, due to its ability to suppress F-action polymerization by inhibiting the relative gene expression through the suppression CREB phosphorylation. Therefore, we propose that DMGF may be considered to be a potential chemoprevention drug for the inhibition of tumor metastasis.",
