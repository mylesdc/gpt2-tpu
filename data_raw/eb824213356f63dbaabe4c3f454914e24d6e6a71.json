The classification of sodium channels is based on the trigger that opens the channel for ions, i.e. voltage-gated sodium channels (triggered by a voltage-change) and ligand-gated sodium channels (triggered by binding of a ligand to the channel) [1] . The mutations in genes coding for sodium channel proteins have been linked with several genetic disorders, called 'sodium channelopathies' such as inherited febrile epilepsy, autism, Brugada syndrome, ventricular fibrillation, long QT syndrome, etc [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Recently, SCN9A gene which encodes for NaV1.7 voltage-gated sodium channel, has been linked to molecular pathophysiologies of pain disorders like inherited erythromelalgia and inherited paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD) and has emerged as a therapeutic target for treatment of neuropathic pain [8] Additionally, nearly 20 disorders affecting skeletal muscle contraction, cardiac rhythm, or neuronal function have been linked to these mutations in human. It has also been shown that sodium channel mutations could cause alteration in the physiological properties (hyperexcitability or hypoexcitability) of the cells depending upon which sodium channels genes are expressed. Both sodium channel mutations and cell background contribute to neuronal function and clinical manifestations [9] .",

Text-mining also ensures the investigation of latest and wider range of publications. We present here Dragon Database for Exploration of Sodium Channels in Human (DDESC), a sodium channel biology resource, compiled based on text-and data-mining. It provides comprehensive information about genes and proteins, metabolites and enzymes, toxins, chemicals with pharmacological effect, disease concepts, human anatomy, pathways and pathway reactions, potentially associated with sodium channel, and provides potential links between these entities. The present study introduces a database for exploring human sodium channels in order to provide useful information for drug development. Various computational approaches, such as structural bioinformatics [11] [12] [13] [14] , molecular docking [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , pharmacophore modelling [21] , QSAR [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , protein sub-cellular location prediction [28, 29] , identification of membrane proteins and their types [30] , identification of enzymes and their functional classes [31] , identification of proteases and their types [32] , protein cleavage site prediction [33] [34] [35] , and signal peptide prediction [36, 37] , provide useful information and insights for both basic research and drug design. All these fields of research can further benefit from DDESC and hence the database can serve a wider science community. The database is accessible via the worldwide web http://apps.sanbi.ac.za/ddesc, where it will be regularly updated. The access is free for academic and nonprofit users.",

For text-mining, a dictionary based method is used where comprehensive list of genes and other entities are matched against the documents for entity recognition and information extraction. If an entity is found, it is tagged as originating from the dictionary that is being processed at that moment. Due to the sequential processing of the dictionaries, it is not possible to tag already tagged entity again, even if such an entity exists in the other, not yet processed, dictionaries. Once all dictionaries are processed, all analysed PubMed abstracts are annotated by the entities from dictionaries as identified in the text. However the main difficulty in entity recognition is the lack of standardisation of the name. Each gene and protein has several synonyms and abbreviations, some of which are common English words. Entity association is based on the co-occurrence of the entities within the abstracts or sentences. If the two entities are repeatedly mentioned together, there are chances that they are linked directly or indirectly. The users could further explore such associations in the context of sodium channels by, for example, inspecting the documents from which the association was extracted. DDESC gives the user flexibility to change the reference dictionary to explore different type of entity associations (see documentation for details). Networks can be generated for the different types of entity associations, which can further be zoomed into the chosen terms and relations by expanding the correlation tree and selecting the preferred subsets of dictionaries. Networks help in bringing different types of data at one platform for its better understanding.",

We hope that this database will serve as a useful complement to the existing public resources as being specialized for sodium channel biology. We also hope that the ability to generate association hypotheses could lead to new scientific concepts for further exploration. DDESC will be updated every six months and the information from all new studies published in that period will be incorporated.",
