However, tremendous sequence data from NGS study has posed great challenge both in accuracy and velocity for application of NGS study. Here we describe VIP (\"Virus Identification Pipeline\"), a one-touch computational pipeline for virus identification and discovery from metagenomic NGS data. VIP performs the following steps to achieve its goal: (i) map and filter out background-related reads, (ii) extensive classification of reads on the basis of nucleotide and remote amino acid homology, (iii) multiple k-mer based de novo assembly and phylogenetic analysis to provide evolutionary insight. We validated the feasibility and veracity of this pipeline with sequencing results of various types of clinical samples and public datasets. VIP has also contributed to timely virus diagnosis (~10 min) in acutely ill patients, demonstrating its potential in the performance of unbiased NGS-based clinical studies with demand of short turnaround time.

The identification of viral pathogens has a tremendous impact on infectious diseases, virology and public health. Nearly all of the outbreaks of public health issues over the last decade have been caused by viruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 1 , 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 2 , H7N9 avian influenza viruses 3 and the recently described Ebola virus in West Africa 4 . Traditional diagnostic methods for viruses, such as cell culture, serodiagnosis, or nucleic acid-based testing are narrow in scope and require a priori knowledge of the potential infectious agents 5,6 . Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment for the infection dramatically reduced the risk of continued transmission and mortality in hospitalized patients 7 . Wild interest in comprehensive detection of these newly emerging and re-emerging viruses from clinical samples highlight the need for rapid, broad-spectrum diagnostic assays.",

Although metagenomics is typically applied to understanding genomic diversity from environment samples, this methodology has also revolutionized virology with comprehensive applications, including viral pathogen identification of infectious disease in clinical laboratories 8 and virus discovery in acute and chronic illnesses of unknown origin 9 . Many novel viruses have been discovered using popular next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms such as pyrosequencing (454 Roche), semiconductor sequencing (Life Technology) and illumina dye sequencing (Illumina) 10-12 . Achievements obtained by viral metagenomics show significant advantages over traditional methods of identifying a viral pathogen, including no need of sequence information for that pathogen, identifying multiple pathogens in a single assay and eliminating the need for time-consuming culturing or antibody laboratory tests.",

            "text": "data generated in viral metagenome sequencing must be performed within a timeframe suitable for actionable responses. Most commercial NGS services, however, offer basic bioinformatics support such as de novo sequence assembly or mapping to reference genomes, but will not process further to the specifics of virus identification and discovery. There are many bioinformatics tools developed specifically for virus detection from NGS data. In general, the strategies in these pipelines are computational subtraction to pathogen detection. Reads corresponding to the host (e.g., human) are first removed, followed by alignment to reference databases (DB) that contain sequences from candidate pathogens [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The most common for virus identifying are local alignments with reference DB, such as the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm 19 . Analysis pipelines that use faster algorithms (e.g., Bowtie or Bowtie2) for host computational subtraction, such as VirFinder 15 and VirusFinder 16 rely on traditional BLAST approaches for final pathogen determination. BLAST is generally used in these tools for classification of viral reads at the nucleotide level (BLASTn), followed by less stringency protein alignments using a translated amino acid alignment (BLASTx) for identification of novel viruses with divergent genomes. However, BLAST is too slow for massive data from NGS. For example, end-to-end processing times, even on multicore computational servers, can take several days to weeks 14 . Another issue is related to de novo assembly. The majority of pipelines utilized to assemble metagenomics data were originally developed to assemble single genomes, However, single-genome assemblers were not aimed to assemble multiple genomes from metagenomics data which were with nonuniform sequence coverages 20 . Problems in the assembly results may include chimeric contigs (reads artificially combined during assembly) which are not easy to be recognized. Additional limitations of these available bioinformatics software for viral pathogen identification include high hardware requirements (multicore servers), the need for bioinformatics expertise, and the lack of validated and clear results to permit confident identification of viruses from metagenomics NGS data. Biologists often have to rely on professional bioinformaticians to process NGS data, posing a bottleneck in data analysis.",

            "text": "Here we present VIP (Virus Identification Pipeline), a one-touch bioinformatic pipeline for virus identification with fairly self-explanatory results in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). VIP performs extensive classification of reads against DB collected by Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) 21 and Influenza Research Database (IRD) 22 nucleotide DB in fast mode and against the virus sequences with NCBI Refseq (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/refseq/) and their neighbor genomes in sense mode (Fig. 1) . Novel viruses are firstly identified in sense mode by amino acid alignment to NCBI virus Refseq amio acid DB and followed by phylogenetic characterization. Raw NGS reads are first preprocessed by removal of adapter, low-quality, and low-complexity sequences, followed by computational subtraction of host-related reads using Bowtie2. In fast mode, viruses are identified by Bowtie2 alignment to ViPR/IRD nucleotide DB. In sense mode, bacteria and related rRNA (ribosomal RNA) reads are removed and the remaining reads are aligned to virus database. Unmatched reads are then aligned to a viral protein database from NCBI Refseq DB using RAPSearch. All matched reads are classified under a genus for de novo assembly and phylogenetic analysis. VIP reports include reads distribution, a summary table of classified reads with taxonomic assignments. In addition, results of phylogenetic analysis and genomic coverage map are attached. Notably, VIP generates results in a clinically actionable timeframe of minutes to hours with lower hardware requirements by leveraging two alignment tools, Bowtie2 23 and RAPSearch 24 , which have computational times that are orders of magnitude faster than BLAST packages. Here we evaluate the performance of VIP for viruses characterization using various NGS datasets public available generated by cross-platforms (454, Ion Torrent and Illumina). These data sets encompass a variety of clinical infections, detected pathogens, sample types, and depths of coverage. We also demonstrate the use of the pipeline for detection of re-emerging dengue virus 1 (DENV-1) from a case with a febrile status in Guangzhou.",

In order to evaluate the accuracy of the two-steps classification strategy (sense mode), a query data set of 125 base pair (bp) reads was generated in-silicon. The viral reads were generated at different mutation rate ranging from 1% up to 40% from four known representative viruses which were Dengue Virus 2 (DENV-2, a single positive-standed RNA), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, a double stranded DNA), Norovirus (a genetically diverse group of single-stranded RNA) and H7N9 (segmented negative-sense RNA) using wgsim (https://github.com/lh3/wgsim). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 25 were generated to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the classification methods at different mutation rate in classifying viral reads. (Figure 2 and see Supplementary Information) Nearly all the results shared the superior 100% specificity. The specificity was slightly reduced (99.83%) when classifying the DENV-2 viral reads at 40% mutation rate. The sensitivity was reduced while the mutation rate was increased. Accurate virus identification, where sensitivity > 90%, was still achieved for with mutation rate at 20% using optimal parameters. Nevertheless, the overall poor performance in classifying the viral reads at high mutation rate (> 20%) required further investigations.",

These samples were infected with viruses of diverse types and all of results were confirmed by independent experiments.

For example, the viruses from data source SRR1106123 was isolated from serum, Hepatitis C virus and Hepatitis G virus were found with VIP pipeline, and the genome coverage were both 100% for the two identified viruses, which was confirmed by independent experiments. Furthermore, the VIP has the power to discover more undetected viruses from the dataset. In data source SRR1170820 from Ion Torrent PGM platform, Bovinecircovirus (BoCV) was reported by traditional test, while with VIP in addition to the Bovinecircovirus, the Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) was also identified, and the genome coverage were 99.90% and 86.13% respectively. We also evaluated VIP using additional 3 in-house samples from different sequencing platforms, including 2 mixed samples (sequenced by Hiseq 2000 and 454 respectively) .

For the mixed swab samples, we found Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Human coronavirus 229E using our method, and the genome coverage were 98.41% and 17.00% respectively, it is worth noting that the number of reads of Human coronavirus 229E was only 262, which was merely 0.01 percent of its total reads (5,147,814 reads), the presence of Human coronavirus 229E was then confirmed by nested PCR experiment.

SURPI searched against the entire both nucleotide and amino acid collection from NCBI (nt/nr) for comprehensive identification of pathogen. Coverage map, a very attractive feature provided in SURPI, was also carried out in VIP with strategy as previously described. The major difference was the way to select the close reference. SURPI would map to all nucleotide reference sequences corresponding to that genus picked out during alignment. VIP will choose a close reference based on abundance of reference genome due to the proposed hypothesis that the genome coverage percentage was alongside with the sequencing depth. The approaches for assembly share little similarity. VIP implemented the \"classification to assembly\" while SURPI used the entire data set to perform assembly. Results suggested higher N50 were achieved by VIP. (Data not shown) Compare to other pathogens, like bacteria, fungi and parasite, most viral pathogens are RNA viruses which suggested the potentially high mutation rate or divergent genomes. It could be impossible to find a suitable reference genome during alignment procedure in some cases which undermined the coverage map and underscored the phylogenetic analysis. The construction of a phylogenetic tree allows us to visualize the underlying genealogy between the candidate divergent virus and existing reference sequences. The overall effective de novo assemblies benefitted from the classification method in VIP generated longer and accurate contig to help construct the phylogenetic tree. Nevertheless, SURPI was proved to provide more comprehensive information for pathogen identification by searching against nt/nr while VIP focused on viruses. (see Supplementary  Table S3 and S4) .",

For a genus, sequences with Refseq standard sunder that genus and the reference sequence which is used to generate the coverage map are selected to carry out multiple sequence alignment to build a backbone using MAFFT 33 (Fig. 5) .",

Still de novo assemblies from virus samples, especially RNA viruses, into a genome sequence is challenging due to extremely uneven read depth distribution caused by amplification bias in the inevitable reverse transcription and PCR amplification process during library preparations. We present the Multiple-k method in which various k-mer lengths are used for de novo assembly with Velvet-Oases [34] [35] [36] . In case that sparse reads do not overlap sufficiently to permit de novo assembly into longer contiguous sequences, assigned reads and contigs are retained if they are the most appropriate empirical >1.5 \u00d7 longer than the average length of the candidate Scientific RepoRts | 6:23774 | DOI: 10.1038/srep23774 reads. Finally the largest contig after de novo assembly is added into the backbone to generate phylogenetic tree by unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA) and visualized by Environment for Tree Exploration 37 .",

Minimum hardware requirements for running VIP include a 4 GB of RAM, PC running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (preferred). VIP and its external dependencies require about 500 MB of disk space. Reference data requires about 70 GB of disk space. During VIP runtime, up to 10 \u00d7 the size of the input file may be needed as additional temporary storage. All high quality reads were subject to viral database using nucleotide alignment (Bowtie2) or amino acid alignment (RAPSearch2). Reads would be classified into each viral genus based on alignment results. VIP would choose a close reference based on abundance of reference genome due to the proposed hypothesis that the genome coverage percentage was alongside with the genome sequencing depth. Candidate reads would map against to the selected reference with optimal BLASTn at reward/penalty score (1/\u2212 1), followed by coverage map generation. Figure 5 . Sequences with Refseq standards under that genus and reference sequence which is used to generate the coverage map are used to generate backbone.
