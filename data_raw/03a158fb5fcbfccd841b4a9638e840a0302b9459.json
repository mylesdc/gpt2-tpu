A degree of vaccine-induced cross-protection has also been demonstrated against genetically-related genotypes in the Alpha-7 (HPV18-like) and Alpha-9 (HPV16like) species groups which is coincident with the detection of L1 cross-neutralising antibodies. In this study the L1 domains recognised by inter-genotype cross-neutralising antibodies were delineated. L1 crystallographic homology models predicted a degree of structural diversity between the L1 loops of HPV16 and the non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotypes. These structural predictions informed the design of chimeric pseudovirions with inter-genotype loop swaps which demonstrated that the L1 domains recognised by inter-genotype cross-neutralising antibodies comprise residues within the DE loop and the late region of the FG loop. These data contribute to our understanding of the L1 domains recognised by vaccine-induced cross-neutralising antibodies. Such specificities may play a critical role in vaccineinduced cross-protection.",

HPV natural infection antibodies and the majority of type-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which neutralise HPV infectivity recognise one or more of these surface exposed loops 12, 13 . Cryo-electron microscope analysis recently demonstrated that the epitope footprints recognised by a number of HPV16 MAbs include amino acid residues from multiple L1 loops 14, 15 . The epitope of one of these MAbs, H16.V5, included loops from two neighbouring L1 monomers with the majority of contact residues predicted to be in the DE and FG loops with a minor number of contact residues located in the EF and HI loops 15 . In comparison, the epitope footprints recognised by four HPV31 MAbs appear to be restricted to amino acid residues within the FG loop 16 . L1 virus-like particles (VLP) precipitated on an aluminium salt adjuvant are the basis of the prophylactic vaccines, Cervarix \u00ae and Gardasil \u00ae , additionally Cervarix \u00ae also contains monophosphoryl lipid A. Clinical trials have demonstrated that both vaccines are highly efficacious against the development of cervical cancer precursors and other anogenital diseases attributable to vaccine genotypes HPV16 and HPV18 17 . A degree of cross-protection has also been reported against oncogenic genotypes HPV31 and HPV33 which are related to HPV16 within the Alpha-9 species group and HPV45 which is related to HPV18 within the Alpha-7 species group 18, 19 . Reductions in infections due to the vaccine types and HPV31, HPV33 and HPV45 have been reported in vaccinated populations 20 , supporting the findings of the vaccine efficacy trials. A third L1 VLP-based prophylactic vaccine, Gardasil \u00ae 9, has recently been licensed for use following successful clinical trials 21 .",

Conversely, the introduction of the HPV31 FG loop into the HPV35 L1 backbone significantly Fine-mapping of cross-neutralising antibody epitope footprint. In order to predict the residues within the DE and FG loops which may be involved in the epitope footprint(s) recognised by vaccine-induced cross-neutralising antibodies, the DE and FG loop amino acid sequences of HPV16, HPV31 and HPV35 were aligned (Fig. 4a) . Amino acid positions for which HPV16 (vaccine type) and HPV31 (cross-neutralising antibody target) shared the same residue but HPV35 (background control) did not, were identified in the DE (Ala 137 ) and FG loops (Ser 281 , Gly 282 , Ser 283 , Ala 285 , Ala 288 and Ser 290 ). These residues were selected to undergo site-directed mutagenesis to determine their contribution to the epitope footprint recognised by cross-neutralising antibodies, alongside additional sites where the residue differed between HPV31 and HPV35 (DE: Phe 127 , Gly 139 and Pro 140 ; FG: Ser 271 and Thr 274 ) (Fig. 4b) .",

Amino acid residues within the L1 loops also appear to play critical roles in maintaining capsid stability 36 and initiating virus-host interactions 9 which may account for the structural similarity predicted between HPV16 and the non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotypes in some L1 loops. The computer modelling of L1-L2 protein interactions suggests that regions of the DE and FG loops interact with proline-rich regions of the L2 36 whilst a cysteine residue within the EF loop is crucial for the formation of inter-capsomeric L1-L1 disulphide bonds 6, 37 .

Two or more L1 loops appear to contribute towards the majority of identified L1 MAb epitopes, although there are instances where a single loop has supported an epitope footprint, for example the BC loop alone is targeted by some HPV6, HPV33 and HPV16 L1 MAbs 45, 50, 51 . The epitope footprints of four neutralising HPV16 MAbs have recently been resolved using cryo-electron microscope analysis and demonstrated for the first time that, alongside FG and HI loop residues, residues in the DE loop formed the core of each epitope with minor contributions from residues in the BC and EF loops 14, 15 . Amino acid residues within the DE loop also formed the majority of the epitope footprint recognised by the HPV16 neutralising human MAb 26D1, which was isolated from a HPV vaccine recipient 52 . In this present study, we found that the DE loop of HPV31 enhanced cross-neutralising antibody recognition of the HPV31 FG loop within the HPV35 L1 backbone.

Cross-neutralising antibodies appeared to primarily target amino acid residues located in the late region of the FG loop particularly the amino acids at positions 281 and 282, the deletion of which resulted in almost complete loss of recognition by cross-neutralising antibodies. In contrast, the mutation of two amino acid positions in the early region of the FG loop had no effect upon cross-neutralising antibody recognition, indicating that the early region is not a target for such antibody specificities.",

The early region of the FG loop is known to harbour residues involved in the epitope footprints of type-specific, neutralising HPV31 MAbs 16 whilst the late region contains the majority of residues involved in the epitope footprints of type-specific, neutralising HPV16 MAbs 14 . The data in this study appear to demonstrate that the late region of the FG loop harbours the amino acid residues recognised by HPV vaccine-induced cross-neutralising antibodies and that direct overlap exists with residues in the HPV16 type-specific antibody footprints. This observation suggests that HPV31 type-specific antibodies and HPV31 cross-neutralising antibodies generated against HPV16 recognise different L1 domains and that the domain recognised by HPV31 cross-neutralising antibodies is subdominant within the epitope footprint of HPV16 type-specific antibodies.",

The crystal structure of the HPV16 L1 capsomer (PDB code: 2R5H) 41 was used as the template to which the target L1 amino acid sequences of the Alpha-9 PsV were modelled. The quality of a predictive model is measured by the GMQE score which ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the expected accuracy of the resulting model, with a score of 1 indicating the highest level of quality estimation reliability 58 . L1 Modelling. DeepView Swiss-Pdb viewer v4.0 59 was used to perform pairwise L1 model comparisons by superimposition and predicted structural differences between models were measured in \u00c5. The superimposition of L1 homology models was supported by a RMS value, which represents the average \u00c5 distance between corresponding atoms in the two models. The lower the RMS value the closer two models are related, with a model compared to itself generating an RMS value of 0 59 . The crystal structure of the HPV35 L1 capsomer (PDB code: 2R5J) 41 was used as a pairwise comparison control for the HPV35 L1 homology model. The DeepView programme was additionally used to model the positions of amino acid residues of interest on to the L1 homology models. L1L2 PsV. The L1 genes with HPV31 or HPV35 backbones and reciprocal inter-genotype loop swaps were synthesised by GeneArt \u00ae (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and were applicable site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). L1 genes were subcloned into the p31sheLL or p35sheLL plasmids in conjunction with the Rapid DNA Dephos & Ligation kit (Roche). HPV31, HPV35 and chimeric L1L2 PsV carrying a luciferase reporter were expressed and purified as previously described 33 . Particle formation and size were determined by electron microscopic analysis of negatively stained particles. Ten PsV particles were measured in nanometres (nm) from each preparation and the median diameter and inter-quartile range calculated (Fig. 2b) . The equivalent of a 50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID 50 ) was estimated for each PsV preparation using the Spearman-Karber equations and a standardised input of 300 TCID 50 was used for all PsV 33 . The L1 concentrations of PsV stocks were estimated by semiquantitative L1 Western blot analysis using CamVir-1 antibody (Abcam, United Kingdom). Particle-to-infectivity ratios were determined on the basis of an estimated particle amount of 3 \u00d7 10 7 particles per ng L1 protein (http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/lco/production.asp), with the ratio being normalized for the input volume and the TCID 50 Gardasil \u00ae n = 17) taken 1 month after receiving the final dose, were selected for analysis based upon HPV31 cross-neutralisation antibody titres 23 .",

This effect was most dramatic when the FG loop was in combination with the DE loop of HPV31, resulting in a median increase in cross-neutralising antibody recognition of 155.7-fold (IQR, 49.7 to 288.4-fold; p < 0.001) compared to the HPV35 PsV. The cross-neutralising antibody recognition of the chimeric L1L2 PsV was independent of the HPV vaccine received. For example, the replacement of the FG loop within the HPV31 L1 backbone with that of HPV35 resulted in a median 17.8-fold (IQR, 8.2 to 39.8-fold; p < 0.001) and 20.1-fold (IQR, 10.8 to 40.5-fold; p < 0.001) decrease relative to the HPV31 PsV for Cervarix \u00ae and Gardasil \u00ae sera, respectively.
