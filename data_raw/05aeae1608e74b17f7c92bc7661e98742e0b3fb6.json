Here, we test the hypothesis that the Ubl2 domain is not required for the catalytic function of MERS PLpro in vitro. The X-ray structure of MERS PLpro-\u2206Ubl2 was determined to 1.9 \u00c5 and compared to PLpro containing the N-terminal Ubl2 domain. While the structures were nearly identical, the PLpro-\u2206Ubl2 enzyme revealed the intact structure of the substrate-binding loop. Moreover, PLpro-\u2206Ubl2 catalysis against different substrates and a purported inhibitor revealed no differences in catalytic efficiency, substrate specificity, and inhibition. Further, no changes in thermal stability were observed between enzymes. We conclude that the catalytic core of MERS PLpro, i.e. without the Ubl2 domain, is sufficient for catalysis and stability in vitro with utility to evaluate potential inhibitors as a platform for structure-based drug design.",

Pp1a and pp1ab are processed by two virus-encoded cysteine proteases, termed the papain-like protease (PLpro) and the 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Together, these two proteases cleave the polyproteins to produce 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), which are essential for the formation of the replicase complex and hence RNA replication.

            "text": "Interestingly, the CoV RNA genome encodes for two Ubl domains within nsp3 that are denoted as Ubl1 14 and Ubl2 5 according to their location in the nsp3 multi-domain protein. The Ubl2 domain of SARS-CoV, previously named the Ubl, was first identified by our lab through X-ray structural studies where it was found to reside directly adjacent to the N-terminus of the PLpro catalytic domain 5 . Since our original structure, the Ubl2 domain has been found to be conserved among CoVs to date, including MERS-CoV 15 , murine hepatitis virus (MHV) 11 , and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) 16 . However, the functional roles for Ubl2 in viral pathogenesis and RNA replication remain enigmatic. So far, the majority of studies aimed at understanding the roles of viral Ubls in CoV replication have focused on the Ubl2 domain due to its location in the RNA genome and potential to modulate the enzymatic activity of PLpro. For example, we investigated the function of Ubl2 in SARS-CoV 7 and MHV 17 and found that the Ubl2 fold is crucial for maintaining PLpro structural integrity in vitro. Interestingly, in cell-based assays, SARS-CoV PLpro without its Ubl2 domain was no longer able to antagonize the pathways involved in the host innate immune response and thereby act as an IFN antagonist 7 . However, the mechanism that leads to this loss of function is not well understood because the enzyme retained its protease and DUB activities. In the case of MHV, a single point mutation in the Ubl2 domain was found to reduce the thermal stability of the papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) domain rendering the enzyme DUB deficient in cells 17 . When this mutation was inserted back into the virus, the mutant virus was attenuated in infected mice with the ability to replicate and induce a protective immune response against wild-type virus. This study revealed that the Ubl2 domain could be used as a strategy to attenuate CoV pathogenesis leading us to further investigate the function of the Ubl2 domain in MERS-CoV.",

This intriguing discovery engendered the hypothesis for this study that the MERS-CoV Ubl2 domain is not required for PLpro catalytic function and stability in vitro. Here, we report a series of X-ray structural and kinetic studies on the MERS-CoV PLpro-\u0394 Ubl2 construct to elucidate the importance of Ubl2 domain in MERS-CoV stability, substrate specificity and enzymatic catalysis as well as to evaluate the efficacy of a reported MERS-CoV PLpro inhibitor 18 . .

Weak electron density for the catalytic His278 is observed in final F o -F c omit maps (Fig. 2c ). Due to the partially modified Cys111, His278 is observed to occupy at least one alternative position in order to accommodate the bulky, modified Cys111 residue. On the other hand, and in contrast to previously reported unbound MERS-CoV PLpro structures, including Protein Data Bank (PDB) codes 4P16 15 , 4PT5 (unpublished), 4REZ 13 and 4RNA 18 , strong (> 3\u03c3 in F o -F c maps) and well-defined electron density is observed for the flexible loop encompassing residues 271-277 in the MERS-CoV PLpro-\u0394 Ubl2 structure (Fig. 2d) . The substrate-binding loop has been observed in the Ub-bound MERS-CoV PLpro structures 13, 19 . As a result, we were able to readily build and refine the entire loop that is responsible for substrate binding and inhibitor recognition in CoV PLpros and PLP2s 9,20 .

There are currently four structures of MERS PLpro flanked with the N-terminal Ubl2 domain that have been determined in the absence of any bound ligand 13, 15, 18 . To determine if the Ubl2 domain elicits an effect on the conformation of the MERS-CoV PLpro catalytic core, we superimposed the structures of PLpro-\u0394 Ubl2 and PLpro-Ubl2 (Fig. 2a,b) . The MERS-CoV PLpro catalytic domain is observed to adopt a conformation that is nearly identical to the structure with the Ubl2 domain intact. The resulting root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) is 0.4 \u00c5 when the C \u03b1 of 254 residues in PLpro-\u0394 Ubl2 are aligned with C \u03b1 of 258 residues in PLpro-Ubl2. The catalytic triad, Cys111-His278-Asp293, aligns well for both enzymes except for the His occupying the conformation near the modified cysteine group. Truncation of the Ubl2 domain appears to cause only slight deviations in the ridge helix of the thumb domain due to the loss of two helix residues, Thr61 and Ala62. We also observe some variation in the position of the zinc atom in the fingers domain, which is reminiscent of the open and closed conformations observed in the Ub-bound complex 13 . This observation suggests that the zinc-fingers binding motif has high flexibility, which may provide an explanation as to why there is weaker electron density and increased B-factors associated with this region that includes residues 225-230. The \u03b2 -turn-substrate-binding loop of MERS-CoV PLpro-\u0394 Ubl2, observed in this study, is also indicated as '\u03b2 -turn' . (b) Magnified views (elongated-left and helical wheel projection-right) of the ridge helix show the similarity between the two structures. (c) Electron density maps associated with the catalytic triad residues (Cys111, His278, Asp293) and \u03b2 -mercaptoethanol (CME111) are shown in green mesh (F o -F c ) and blue mesh (2F o -F c ). F o -F c electron density omit maps, where the catalytic triad residues were omitted from the calculations, are contoured to 3\u03c3 . Final 2F o -F c maps are contoured to 1\u03c3 . His278 was observed to reside in two positions after occupancy refinement -one at slightly higher occupancy (0.55). (d) Electron density maps associated with substrate-binding loop (residues 271-277) containing the \u03b2 -turn are shown in green mesh (F o -F c ) and blue mesh (2F o -F c ) and are contoured to 3\u03c3 and 1\u03c3 , respectively. The entire loop could be modeled into the observable density and is represented as sticks. Atoms in Panels c-d are colored as follows; nitrogens (dark blue), oxygens (red), sulfur (yellow), carbons (light blue).",

The kinetic assays for each substrate were performed side-by-side with each enzyme in the same assay plates under identical assay conditions. The kinetic response of each enzyme to increasing concentrations of substrate are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 . We were unable to reach saturation with the Z-RLRGG-AMC peptide substrate up to concentrations of 75 \u03bc M, a concentration that begins to approach the concentration range whereby the inner filter effect for the AMC fluorophore can confound the assay 9 . Therefore, this first-order range of the kinetic data were fit to a line to obtain the slope, which is the apparent k cat /K m or catalytic efficiency. In contrast, both enzymes could be saturated with ISG15-AMC and Ub-AMC substrates, and the kinetic data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain individual k cat and K m values. The resulting kinetic parameters for both enzymes against all three substrates are summarized in Table 2 .",

Compared to the k cat /K m value for the Z-RLRGG-AMC peptide, both enzymes hydrolyze Ub-AMC (~1,600 times) and ISG15-AMC (~5,000 times) more efficiently. MERS-CoV PLpro with and without the Ubl2 domain hydrolyzes ISG15-AMC substrate ~3-fold more efficiently than Ub-AMC although the turnover numbers, k cat , are identical. The higher catalytic efficiency is mainly due to the lower K m value observed for ISG15-AMC. Assuming that the K d \u2245 K m , PLpro may bind ISG15 3-fold tighter compared to Ub.

MERS-CoV PLpro has been proposed to use a single monoubiquitin recognition sub-site, S1, for Ub binding to processes all Ub chains 9, 10 . It is possible that the MERS-CoV Ubl2 domain could function to assist PLpro in its ability to discriminate between different Ub 2 linkages. We therefore tested the ability of MERS-CoV PLpro with and without an intact Ubl2 domain to process different Ub 2 isopeptide linkages, including Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, and Lys63, and linear Ub 2 , which is linked via the amino-terminal Met residue. We incubated each of the substrates with MERS-CoV PLpro-Ubl2 or PLpro-\u0394 Ubl2 for 2 hours and analyzed the cleaved products by SDS-PAGE. The results are shown in Fig. 3 , and they indicate that the Ubl2 domain does not impact the ability of PLpro to recognize different isopeptide linkages. MERS-CoV PLpro is capable of recognizing and processing all Ub 2 linkages except the peptide linkage (linear). Linkages that were efficiently cleaved to nearly all monoubiquitin after the time course were Lys11, Lys48, and Lys63. However, linkages with partially reacted or unreacted Ub 2 species were Lys6, Lys27, Lys29, and Lys33. These results are also consistent with recent findings that MERS-CoV PLpro without the Ubl2 domain was still able to be modified by a K48-linked Ub 2 warhead supporting the hypothesis that the Ubl2 domain is not involved in substrate recognition 10 .",

The cleavage assay was performed over a 2 hour time course, and reaction products were analyzed at various time points from 5 minutes to 2 hours using SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4a,b) . Ub 4 substrates without addition of enzyme served as the negative control. The cleavage assays for Lys63-Ub 4 (Fig. 4a) and Lys48-Ub 4 (Fig. 4b ) are nearly identical for the reactions catalyzed by MERS-CoV PLpro with and without the Ubl2 domain. Both substrates are readily converted into monoubiquitin species after 2 hours with no apparent accumulation of other Ub forms consistent with previous reports 9, 10 .

            "text": "We investigated the function of the Ubl2 domain of MERS-CoV PLpro in substrate recognition and catalysis, structural stability and inhibition by a purported small molecule inhibitor. We also report the first X-ray crystal structure of a CoV PLpro or PLP2 without its flanking Ubl2 domain. We found using X-ray crystallography that removal of the Ubl2 domain from MERS-CoV PLpro did not alter the structure of the catalytic domain significantly nor did it change the structural stability as determined by melting temperatures derived from CD melting curves. Steady-state kinetic studies revealed that the Ubl2 domain associated with MERS-CoV PLpro is not required for its enzymatic function, including DUB, deISGylating, and proteolytic activities. In addition, examining MERS-CoV PLpro-mediated catalysis towards different polyubiquitin substrates with different isopeptide linkages revealed that the Ubl2 domain does not influence high-order Ub chain processing or Ub chain specificity. Overall, these studies indicate that the core catalytic domain of MERS PLpro is a robust enzyme that can be used in cell-based and in vitro assays making it highly amenable for high-throughput screening to evaluate potential inhibitors. Whether other domains within the MERS-CoV nsp3 participate in the discrimination of different Ub chain linkages still remains unclear. Our findings suggest, however, that the Ubl2 domain is likely not involved in this function. MERS-CoV PLpro is capable of cleaving a variety of different chain linkages, though some chains are more favored. The substrate recognition of MERS-CoV PLpro is therefore similar to MHV PLP2 11 . Our findings support that the recognition and cleavage of these Ub 2 chains by MERS-CoV PLpro is independent of the presence of the Ubl2 domain.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV PLpro can also hydrolyze both Lys48-and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains to monoubiquitin at equal rates either with or without the Ubl2 domain. The rapid processing of both chains to monoubiquitin suggests that MERS-CoV PLpro, similar to MHV PLP2, utilizes monoubiquitin recognition at a single S1 sub-site to cleave all Ub chains and ISG15. In contrast, SARS-CoV PLpro prefers to utilize Ub 2 recognition to hydrolyze substrates. For example, SARS-CoV PLpro hydrolyzes Lys48-linked chains more efficiently by using two Ub binding sites across S2-S1 sub-sites as opposed to Lys63-linked chains, which are recognized by the single S1 sub-site 8 . The structural basis for Ub 2 recognition was recently revealed via the crystal structure of SARS-CoV PLpro in complex with Lys48-linked Ub 2 supporting the previous models [8] [9] [10] 24 . In the S2 binding pocket, the ridge helix of SARS-CoV PLpro, which is immediately adjacent to the Ubl2 domain, actively engages with the distal Ub of the K48-linked Ub 2 substrate 24 . We propose that the ridge helix of MERS-CoV PLpro may not actively participate in substrate binding as with SARS-CoV PLpro. However, we can only conclude from the two residues removed from the ridge helix that these specific residues are not involved in ISG15 or polyubiquitin catalysis, as no further mutagenesis was done in this region. Altogether, our findings, coupled with the aforementioned studies, clearly show that MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PLpro utilize different mechanisms when recognizing and cleaving host proteins, and specifically, MERS-CoV PLpro likely does not contain the S2 sub-site. Our original X-ray structure of SARS-CoV PLpro revealed for the first time the presence of Ubl domains in CoV nsp3s, and it established the first known vUSP defining a new class 5 . This seminal work on vUSPs set the stage for new discoveries, including a bioinformatics study on the homologies of human USPs which revealed that the Ubl fold, resembling the \u03b2 -grasp architecture of Ub, is predicted to be present in at least 16 human USPs 25 . The locations of these Ubl domains can be found at either their N-and C-termini or embedded within their catalytic core. A plethora of Ubl domains residing within human USPs suggest that they may play a significant functional role in the tightly orchestrated process of protein degradation as well as other critical signaling processes. Thus far, the function of Ubl domains in USPs have been attributed to the alteration of enzyme catalysis and specificity, or the recruitment of binding partners to mediate processes, including cellular localization, trafficking, and signal transduction 25 .",

            "text": "Although extensive studies have characterized Ubl domains from human USPs, the function of viral Ubl domains in biological systems remains elusive. Initially, the function of the Ubl2 domain was evaluated in cell-culture with SARS-CoV PLpro where the Ubl2 domain was found to be essential for PLpro's ability to act as an IFN antagonist and inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation or NF-\u03ba B signaling 7 . Interestingly, when the Ubl2 domain was removed from PLpro, SARS-CoV PLpro-\u0394 Ubl2 maintained its DUB and protease activity. However, further characterization of SARS-CoV PLpro-\u0394 Ubl2 in vitro was not pursued due to its instability during expression and purification. Interestingly, in a recent study both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PLpro-\u0394 Ubl2 constructs were expressed and purified in vitro. Both enzymes maintained their catalysis towards a K48-linked Ub 2 warhead as compared to PLpro with the Ubl2 domain 10 . These results suggest that the Ubl2 domain may not be involved in the mechanism of substrate recognition or catalysis for PLpros. However, the Ubl2 domain was found to be important for MHV PLP2 thermal stability 17 . Previous work evaluated the effect of a conserved single Val787Ser mutation in the Ubl2 domain, which was found to decrease PLP2 enzymatic activity at physiological temperatures and attenuate mutant virus in mice. We propose that a similar mutation could provoke an \"unraveling effect\" if introduced in other Ubl2 domains adjacent to PLpro. However, in the case of MERS-CoV PLpro, we show that we can completely remove the Ubl2 domain of MERS-CoV PLpro, and the resulting PLpro catalytic core is still able to maintain its stability and catalysis in vitro and in cells 9 .",

For over 20 years, F2124-0890 was seldom reported in the literature until in 2014 when it was identified as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro by Lee et al. 28 .

We also evaluated the inhibitory ability of F2124-0890 under reducing conditions by either placing DTT in the biochemical assays or using the natural reducing environment of the cell. We found that reducing agent either greatly diminished or eliminated the ability of F2124-0890 to inhibit MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PLpro and the USPs tested. Possible explanations as to why the compound may only show efficacy under non-reducing conditions could be that the compound binds in a non-specific manner to viral and human USPs and promotes reversible-oxidation of the active site cysteine. Another explanation could be that chemical reducing agents may directly compete against the inhibitor for binding to the active site. Reducing agents, such as DTT and BME, can modify active site cysteines. The bulky modified cysteine formed by the BME reducing agent observed in the crystal structure supports the fact that the inhibitor may not be able to bind under the reducing conditions due to the encumbered active site pocket. However, F2124-0890 is unable to inhibit MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV PLpro under the natural reducing conditions of a cell indicating that inhibition by this compound is complex and likely non-specific. It is clear from our data and the data presented in the literature that F2124-0890 has poor selectivity among cysteine proteases, lacks inhibitory potency in cell-based assays, and has greatly reduced or no inhibitory potency in in vitro assays in the presence of reducing agents. Therefore, F2124-0890 is likely a PAIN that should not be pursued further as a lead compound for therapeutic development or other uses.",

The change in thermal melting temperature (\u0394 T m ) of only 0.6 \u00b0C indicates that MERS-CoV PLpro is a structurally stable enzyme even in the absence of the N-terminal Ubl2 domain. In fact, MERS-CoV PLpro-\u0394 Ubl2 remains folded at higher temperatures compared to MHV PLP2, which unfolds at temperatures less than 50 \u00b0C 17 . Therefore, we conclude that the MERS-CoV Ubl2 domain does not stabilize or destabilize the catalytic domain in vitro. Evaluation of compound F2124-0890, a purported inhibitor of MERS-CoV PLpro. Recent studies by Lee et al. reported that compound 4, commercial code F2124-0890 (Life Chemicals), inhibits MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PLpro activity with IC 50 values in the low micromolar range 18 . We performed an independent analysis of the ability of compound F2124-0890 to inhibit MERS-CoV PLpro and PLpro-\u0394 Ubl2 in addition to other viral and cellular USPs. First, we varied concentrations of compound F2124-0890 and measured the percent inhibition of viral papain-like proteases, including MERS-CoV PLpro-Ubl2, PLpro-\u0394 Ubl2, SARS-CoV PLpro and MHV PLP2 both in the absence and presence of 5 mM DTT, a reducing agent (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Compound F2124-0890 equally inhibits both MERS-CoV PLpro-Ubl2 and PLpro-\u0394 Ubl2 both in the absence and presence of reducing agent and supports our general observation that the Ubl2 domain does not influence MERS-CoV PLpro catalytic function. The resulting IC 50 values are given in",
