This study used microarray-based transcriptomic analysis of PBMCs from experimentally infected pigs to explore the patterns of immune dysregulation after infection with two East European PRRSV strains from subtype 2 (BOR and ILI) in comparison to a Danish subtype 1 strain (DAN). Transcriptional profiles were determined at day 7 post infection in three tested groups of pigs and analysed in comparison with the expression profile of control group. Microarray analysis revealed differential regulation (> 1.5-fold change) of 4253 and 7335 genes in groups infected with BOR and ILI strains, respectively, and of 12518 genes in pigs infected with Danish strain. Subtype 2 PRRSV strains showed greater induction of many genes, especially those involved in innate immunity, such as interferon stimulated antiviral genes and inflammatory markers. Functional analysis of the microarray data revealed a significant up-regulation of genes involved in processes such as acute phase response, granulocyte and agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, as well as down-regulation of genes enrolled in pathways engaged in protein synthesis, cell division, as well as B and T cell signaling. This study provided an insight into the host response to three different PRRSV strains at a molecular level and demonstrated variability between strains of different pathogenicity level.",

Clinically the disease manifests by reproductive disorders in sows and respiratory lesions and poor growth performance in growing pigs. The etiological agent of the disease, PRRS virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped, positive-sense single-strand RNA virus classified in the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae. Two genotypes, Type 1 and Type 2, sharing approximately 60% of genetic similarity were described [1] . A newly proposed classification denotes both types as different species within Arteriviridae family (https ://talk.ictvo nline .org/taxon omy/). Type 1 can be further divided into at least four genetic subtypes, namely Pan-European subtype 1 and subtypes 2, 3 and 4 represented by strains circulating in Eastern European countries [2] . Gathering evidences suggest the existence of additional 1 3 subtypes. However, the genetic subtyping based on a small genomic fragment of ORF5 and ORF7 can be affected by genetic recombination [3] [4] [5] .",

The virus utilizes a range of mechanisms to influence the immune response including weak stimulation of interferon production and slow development of cell-mediated immunity, inhibition of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and weak and delayed neutralizing response [13] . As a result, the course of infection may advance to a chronic stage lasting even up to 21 weeks [14] . Insufficient stimulation of an immune response and high level of genetic variability also constitute key problems in the development of efficient vaccines. None of the currently used vaccines provides full protection against infection and their effectiveness is often compromised towards heterologous strains [15] .

In short, piglets from three sows were divided into four experimental groups, ensuring that each litter was equally represented in every group. Three groups of 8-week-old pigs were infected with a PRRSV Type 1 strains including subtype 1 strain 18,794 (DAN) isolated in 1993 in Denmark [19] , a Russian isolate ILI6 (ILI) and a Belarusian isolate BOR59 (BOR) from 2009, each classified as subtype 2 strain based on ORF5 sequence, respectively. Pigs were inoculated intranasally with 2 ml of virus inoculum prepared based on 5th (titre of 5.4 log10 TCID50/ml), 3rd (titre of 6.8 log10 TCID50/ml) and 2nd (titre of 4.4 log10 TCID50/ml) passage in porcine alveolar macrophages culture for DAN, ILI and BOR strains respectively. The fourth, PRRSV-negative control group, was sham-inoculated with 2 ml of Eagle's medium. Individual pigs were subjected to daily clinical examination and measurement of rectal body temperature. The severity of clinical lesions was assessed based on a scoring system adapted to PRRS [18] . An overall well-being, respiration, eye disorders and appetite were scored as 0 (normal condition) to 3 (severe disorder). The scores for individual pigs were added up to a cumulative clinical score (CS) per day. During the experiment no mortality was recorded and none of the animals displayed the acute clinical signs defined as endpoint criteria. Euthanasia of the pigs was performed on 22-24 DPI by intravenous injection of pentobarbiturate (50 mg/ kg) followed by exsanguination by cutting arteria axillaris.",

As the experiment was performed using pigs of highly uniform genetic and environmental background, RNA samples representing template of animals from each control and experimental group were pooled. Each pool was processed in four repeats using Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis, Low Input Quick Amp Labeling-Agilent Technologies. Briefly, 50 ng of total RNA (equal amount of RNA of each animal were pooled) was reverse transcribed to generate cDNA and then transcribed into Cy3-labelled cRNA (samples obtained from control animals) and into Cy5-labelled cRNA (samples obtained from infected animals). After purification of labelled RNA (Qiagen RNeasy Kit), the yield (ng of cRNA) and specific activity (pmol of Cy3 or Cy5/\u00b5g of cRNA) were quantified using Nanophotometr Pearl (IMPLEN). Hybridization was performed by preparing a target solution containing 300 ng Cy5-labeled pool cRNA from infected animals, 300 ng Cy3-labeled pool cRNA of uninfected animal and then fragmentation buffer was added and incubated at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min. After stopping fragmentation, samples were hybridized on Agilent arrays for 18 h at 65 \u00b0C in Agilent hybridization chambers in an Agilent hybridization oven rotating at 10 rpm. After hybridization the arrays were subsequently washed with 'GE wash buffer 1' for 1 min at room temperature, 'GE wash buffer 2' for 1 min at approximately 37 \u00b0C, each chamber washed twice. After washing, slides were scanned using Agilent G2505C US10353831. Images obtained after scanning were analyzed using Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 10.7.3.1). A detailed analysis including filtering of outlier spots, background subtraction from features and dye normalization (linear and LOWESS) was performed.

The lists of candidate genes identified by GeneSpring analysis were uploaded to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis program (IPA; https ://www.qiage nbioi nform atics .com/produ cts/ingen uity-pathw ay-analy sis/) to identify most biologically relevant changes. Separate lists of up-and down-regulated genes were analyzed using Canonical Pathway analysis, which used right-tailed Fisher's Exact Test to identify pathways enriched in the gene set compared to the reference set of genes which included all genes in the human genome.",

Moreover, these genes were previously described in the context of PRRSV infection. Results were normalized using \u03b2-actin as a reference gene. These quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCRs were carried out using the pooled RNA samples subjected to microarray study. Furthermore, to validate whether analysis of pooled samples reflects the gene expression in the individual specimens, also the relative expression of four selected genes (OAS1, CXCL2, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2) was assessed in RNA from the individual pigs by RT-qPCR. The list of primers used in the study is shown in Table 1 . Primers specific for the \u03b2-actin gene were used as described elsewhere [20] , while the primers for target genes were designed using Primer 3 Plus bioinformatics tool (http:// prime r3plu s.com/cgi-bin/dev/prime r3plu s.cgi). Similarly as for microarray experiment, RNA samples from each control and experimental group were pooled ensuring the same concentration of RNA from each animal. Then 1.5 \u00b5g of each pooled sample were digested with DNase I Amplification Grade (Invitrogen) and after reverse transcribed using NG dART RT kit (EURX). The synthesis of cDNA was performed at 47 \u00b0C for 50 min. The qPCR was performed in a Rotor Gene Q (Qiagen). Each reaction mix contained 80 ng of cDNA, 2x QuantiTect SYBRGreen Mix (Qiagen) and 10 \u00b5M of forward and reverse primers specific for each tested gene and adjusted to a total volume of 25 \u00b5l. Every qPCR reaction was performed in duplicate (technical replicates). The efficiency of each reaction was determined based on a serial dilution of cDNA template (100, 10 and 1 ng) and remained within a 90-110% range. Relative gene expression levels were calculated using E-method described by Pfaffl [21] and fold-change units were calculated by dividing the normalized expression values coming from infected animals by the normalized expression values in the controls. The same procedure was applied for individual samples where 80 ng of each individual RNA sample was used.",

Despite many complex studies carried out over the years, understanding of the disease is still far from complete. The answer to such a challenge might be the use of high-throughput analysis tools, like DNA microarrays or deep sequencing, to study transcriptional response of the host after virus infection. Most of such studies included only Type 2 PRRSV strains [23] [24] [25] , while only single ones enrolled Type 1 strains [26] . Even recently published data on the virulence of subtype 2 strains of Type 1 showed that some of those strains may characterize with high pathogenicity which implies distinct mechanisms shaping the course of infection [18] . However, transcriptional response to infection by subtype 2 strains of Type 1 PRRSV was not studied before. The aim of a present study was to shed a light on the host-virus interactions during the course of infection with PRRSV strains of commonly present in Central and Western Europe subtype 1 and much less studied subtype 2 strains. The biological material analysed in the present study was collected in the first animal experiment with the use of such strains [18] . Changes in expression of genes involved in immunological processes were evaluated in each infected group of pigs and compared to control pigs.",

Unfortunately, still little is known about particular interactions between PRRSV and ISGs like OAS, IFIT1 or Mx1. Recently Badaoui et al. [38] described up-regulation of OAS1 expression in LV-infected PAMs. In addition, Zhao and co-workers [39] observed in an in vitro system that PRRSV infection led to induction of OAS1, while knockdown of endogenous OAS1 increased the PRRSV mRNA In our analysis also other genes from OAS family were observed to be strongly up-regulated. OAS2 gene showed increased expression in BOR and ILI groups, while OASL gene was found to be up-regulated in all three groups of infected animals. Those observations suggest the involvement of OAS proteins in various mechanisms engaged in the defense against PRRSV infection, also observed in studies of other viral infections [40] [41] [42] .",

Transcription of IFIT genes is triggered usually in the case of viral and bacterial infections, mostly by Type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bbs) [46, 47] . Independently, IFIT genes are induced in cells infected with RNA viruses which are sensed by pattern recognition receptors [48] . In the presented study increased expression of IFIT1 was noted in DAN (FC = 5.313) and ILI (FC = 3.983) groups, while IFIT2 up-regulation was observed in BOR (FC = 11.521) and ILI (FC = 5.432) groups, as well as IFIT3, which expression increase reached FC = 17.080 in BOR, FC = 10.152 in ILI and FC = 3.245 in DAN group. Interestingly, up to now only IFIT3 was linked to PRRSV infection as an important modulator of innate immunity inhibiting virus replication in MARC-145 cells by induction of IFN-\u03b2 [49] . In our study, the profile of IFITs expression differed between subtype 1 strain and subtype 2 strains, thus raising the question whether the same mechanisms are utilized during infection with PRRSV strains by those genetic groups. The specific role of IFIT1 and IFIT2 is binding single-stranded RNA, thereby acting as a sensor of viral single-stranded RNAs and inhibiting expression of viral messenger RNA [50, 51] . Some differences in antiviral activity between IFIT proteins were previously described for human parainfluenza virus type 3 [52] . Based on those observations it seems that there are some individual features, like distinct tertiary structures, which allow IFIT proteins to bind different partners and selectively affect host-virus interactions.",

Tight junctions are specialized membrane domains, which maintain adjacent cells close enough to avoid uncontrolled passage of small molecules, microorganisms and cells, across the paracellular space [63, 64] . They are also involved in regulation of some cellular processes, including polarization, proliferation, differentiation and gene expression [65] [66] [67] . Our results suggest that also PRRSV may hijack tight junctions to use cellular machinery to support its own replication. It has been already reported that some viruses are able to regulate the expression or localization of tight junctions proteins to induce cell transformation or make their exit process more efficient. Reports evidenced the importance of tight junction for the infection of different viruses, including reoviruses, influenza virus or human immunodeficiency virus 1 [68] [69] [70] [71] .",

The coincident down-regulation of mTOR Signalling in DAN group and PI3K Signaling in B Lymphocytes in ILI and BOR groups indicate the clear influence on inhibition of cellular protein synthesis. This picture, clearly observed in ILI and DAN groups, is known to be one of the hallmarks of interferon signaling [72] . A similar picture was observed by Wilkinson and co-workers in pigs infected with PRRSV Type 2 strain [73] . Additionally, Cell Cycle: G1/S Checkpoint Regulation pathway controlling the passage of the cells from the G1 into the DNA synthesis (S) phase, was associated with downregulated genes in BOR group. Zhou et al. showed already that the genes relevant to cell cycle and DNA replication can be regulated by highly pathogenic PRRSV [74] . Similarly, Sun and co-workers noticed in microarray experiment that PRRSV nsp11 is able to regulate cell cycle and DNA replication and by in vitro experiment proved that nsp11 induced the delay of cell cycle progression at the S phase. Such cell cycle arrest may be beneficial for the virus, since it can redirect cellular replicative machinery for viral replication, as can be observed for other DNA and RNA viruses [75] .",

Ligation of CD40 on the surface of dendritic cells controls the production of particular proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, MIP-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12), while its ligation on monocytes is required for stimulation of production of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8, and in the rescue of circulating monocytes from apoptosis. The impairment of this pathway affects simultaneously both cellular and humoral immune response. The impairment of B cell receptor signaling strongly affects humoral immune response, since signals propagated through the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) are crucial to the development, survival and activation of B lymphocytes. Furthermore, it is also linked with stimulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways resulting in the nuclear accumulation of transcription factors and enhancement of protein synthesis and therefore its down-regulation impairs mentioned processes, accompanying already mentioned pathways, EIF2 and EIF4 [76] . In BOR group, additionally, Antiproliferative Role of TOB in T Cell Signaling and T Helper Cell Differentiation processes were found to be significantly associated with down-regulated genes. A transducer of ERBB2 (TOB) is a negative regulator of T cell proliferation and cytokine transcription, which is constitutively expressed in unstimulated peripheral blood T lymphocytes and selectively expressed in anergic T cells. Down-regulation of TOB is necessary for T cell activation what is crucial during infection [77] . But when this whole process undergoes down-regulation, together with T Helper Cell Differentiation process, it changes the situation and heavily impairs cellular immune response and cytokines signaling, crucial in the face of infection [78] .",

Similarly, an increase of activity in TREM 1 pathway was noted for ILI and BOR strains. Furthermore, in infection with Lena as well as ILI and BOR strains, the expression of IL-8 and TLR4 was upregulated.

The same additive effect for this inflammatory mediator was noted in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells BMDCs pre-infected with PRRSV (IAF-Klop PRRSV genotype 2 strain) after a subsequent infection with S. suis (wild-type virulent S. suis serotype 2 strain P1/7) [84] . CCL-4 is considered as the most potent chemoattractant and mediator of virus-induced inflammation in vivo [85] , thus acitivation of Chemokine Signaling pathway and up-regulation of CCL-4 can contribute to the higher virulence of BOR and ILI strains compared to DAN observed in an animal experiment.",
