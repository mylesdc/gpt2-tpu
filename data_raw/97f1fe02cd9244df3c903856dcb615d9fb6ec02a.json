            "text": "To date there are no approved antiviral drugs for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Based on our in vitro evidence of antiviral activity of interferon (IFN)-\u00df activity against Ebola virus, we conducted a single arm clinical study in Guinea to evaluate the safety and therapeutic efficacy of IFN \u03b2-1a treatment for EVD. Nine individuals infected with Ebola virus were treated with IFN \u03b2-1a and compared retrospectively with a matched cohort of 21 infected patients receiving standardized supportive care only during the same time period at the same treatment unit. Cognizant of the limitations of having treated only 9 individuals with EVD, the data collected are cautiously considered. When compared to supportive care only, IFN \u03b2-1a treatment seemed to facilitate viral clearance from the blood and appeared associated with earlier resolution of disease symptoms. Survival, calculated from the date of consent for those in the trial and date of admission from those in the control cohort, to the date of death, was 19% for those receiving supportive care only, compared to 67% for those receiving supportive care plus IFN \u03b2-1a. Given the differences in baseline blood viremia between the control cohort and the IFN-treated cohort, an additional 17 controls were included for a subset analysis, from other treatment units in Guinea, matched with the IFNtreated patients based on age and baseline blood viremia. Subset analyses using this expanded control cohort suggests that patients without IFN \u03b2-1a treatment were~1.5-1.9 fold more likely to die than those treated. Viewed altogether the results suggest a rationale for further clinical evaluation of IFN \u03b2-1a.",

Since December 2013 the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa has claimed 11,314 lives of the 28,630 confirmed cases. Clinical symptoms at onset of EVD include headache, fever, asthenia, arthralgia and myalgia. Gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea develop, leading to an electrolyte imbalance associated with intravascular volume depletion. Indeed, EVD is associated with profound endothelial dysfunction leading to fluid shifts that may result in cardiovascular collapse and renal failure [2, 3] . Notably, the overall fatality rates differed in the 3 countries with the greatest number of confirmed cases: 67% in Guinea, 45% in Liberia and 28% in Sierra Leone [4] . Variables such as extent of viremia, time to onset of supportive care, and the level of supportive care, contributed to the case fatality ratio [5] . In the absence of any approved treatments, the high case fatality ratio prompted the consideration of potential treatment options, including the repurposing of approved drugs.",

IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production occurs as the earliest non-specific response to viral infection, directly inhibiting viral infection and activating the innate and adaptive immune responses to clear virus. Indeed, viruses have evolved immune evasion strategies specifically targeted against the type I IFN response, confirming the importance of IFNs as antivirals. This immune evasion strategy is particularly relevant when one considers IFN and EBOV infection. Experimental data indicate that the EBOV proteins VP24 and VP35 inhibit host cell systems that lead to type I IFN production and also inhibit events associated with an IFN response [7] [8] [9] . Accordingly, early post-exposure treatment with type I IFN might override these inhibitory effects of EBOV. IFN \u03b2-1a therapy has been shown to prolong survival in a rhesus macaque model of lethal EVD [10] and IFN-\u03b12b treatment reduced viremia and extended the time to death in a similar cynomolgus model of lethal EVD [11] . A combination of monoclonal antibodies targeted against EBOV (ZMAb) protects macaques from lethal EVD, with decreasing efficacy if treatment is delayed to 2 days post-infection [12] . Addition of an adenovirus expressed vectored IFN-\u03b1 to ZMAb extended the treatment window and improved protection [12] . Moreover, in mice and guinea pigs, using this replication-deficient human adenovirus expressing recombinant IFN-\u03b1 alone, post-exposure treatment elicited full protection from lethal doses of the mouse-and guinea pig-adapted EBOV [13] . Notably, examination of serum samples from infected individuals during the 2000 outbreak of Sudan EBOV in Uganda revealed that surviving patients had significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b1 within the first few days of the onset of critical illness [14] .",

In studies using transcription competent virus-like particles and infectious eGFP-Ebola virus, we provided evidence that IFN-\u03b1/\u00df limit Ebola virus (EBOV) infection in vitro, and showed that IFN \u00df-1a exhibits superior antiviral potency compared with IFN-\u03b1 [15] . These findings provided the basis for this single arm proof-of-concept pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IFN-\u03b2 treatment for EVD. This study was undertaken in an ETU close to Coyah, Guinea, during the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak. While a placebo-controlled study was not permitted by the Guinean Health Authorities due to ethical concerns, laboratory and clinical data from EBOV-infected individuals who received only supportive care at the same treatment center and during the same period as those who received IFN \u03b2-1a was available for comparison. We provide preliminary evidence supporting further evaluation of IFN \u03b2-1a in any subsequent outbreak. ",

Recruitment of patients was difficult in the declining outbreak, limiting this proof-of-concept study to a pilot study. Nine patients met the inclusion criteria for IFN \u03b2-1a treatment. A cohort of historical controls of 28 patients was available for comparison with the treated patients. 7 patients of this cohort were excluded: 4 were younger than 17 years of age, 2 had onset of symptoms more than 6 days before admission and 1 was older than 70 years of age. The 21 control patients were admitted to the Coyah ETU during the same time period as the IFN \u03b2-1a treated patients, with RT-PCR-confirmed blood EBOV (Table 1) .

It is important to note that while IFN \u03b2-1a was available as a treatment option, EBOV-infected individuals and/or their designate had the right to refuse IFN \u03b2-1a treatment, which 4 did. The IFN \u03b2-1a treatment and control groups did not differ in age, sex or day of admission relative to symptom onset (Table 1) . Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine (CRE) and C reactive protein (CRP) levels were consistent features of EVD in all study participants. Of the 9 patients treated with IFN \u03b2-1a, 5 started IFN treatment on day 3 post-symptom onset, 1 on day 4 post-symptom onset, one on day 5 post-symptom onset and one on day 6 post-symptom onset. One patient started treatment the next day following admission to the treatment unit based on being a high risk contact who was asymptomatic, but was PCR positive. Given the elevated ALT, AST and CRE levels in all patients with EVD, we were unable to determine whether IFN \u03b2-1a treatment negatively affected these biochemical blood measurements. 1 patient (Table 2 , #4) with a PCR negative result received a dose reduction (3 x10 6 IU), related to elevated AST and ALT levels, and had a second 2 consecutive PCR negative result on this reduced dose. Another patient (#5) received a dose reduction (3x10 6 IU) because of rapid resolution of clinical symptoms and a coincident first negative PCR result. This patient also had a consecutive PCR negative result on the reduced IFN \u03b2-1a dose. 1 patient had treatment discontinued because of severe clinical symptoms and subsequently died. 2 patients received treatment beyond 10 days, until they became PCR negative ( Table 2 ). 3 of the 9 patients who received IFN \u03b2-1a died. Notably, ALT, AST and CRE were significantly elevated in all 3 patients who died, despite one patient (#7) exhibiting reduction in blood viremia from a CT value of 20.1 at start of IFN \u03b2-1a treatment, to a CT value of 38 on day 10, when the patient succumbed to disease ( Table 2) .",

Notably, these patients were never approached to participate in the IFN \u03b2-1a treatment trial. Since no data were available to us on serial CT values for these additional patients, we only used vital status (alive or dead) as the outcome. Three logistic regression analyses were performed: (i) An analysis in which all patients were included: 9 IFN-treated and 38 controls. The results suggest that the treatment is significant even when the model is adjusted for CT value. The patients without treatment had an odds ratio of dying 7.54 fold more likely than those treated, when adjusting for the CT value. For a CT value of 20 (median for CT) the probability of dying for those untreated was 1.89 fold larger than for those treated (S1 Table) (ii) An analysis in which patients older than 50 years (which is the maximum age in the IFNtreated group) and with baseline CT values <16 or >31 (the range of values for the IFNtreated group) were excluded. The patients without treatment had an odds ratio of dying 6.39 fold more likely than those treated, when adjusting for the CT value. For a CT value of 20 (median for CT) the probability of dying for those untreated was 1.81 fold larger than for those treated (S2 Table) . (iii) A matched analysis.

Our strategy at the outset was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IFN treatment, hence the decision to use a non-pegylated version of IFN with a short half-life, that could be discontinued or dose-reduced, with rapid clearance, to address potential concerns of adverse events. Moreover, extensive clinical experience with IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 prepared us for potential adverse outcomes and solutions to these. The decision to undertake this trial was based on preliminary scientific pre-clinical data and, perhaps most pertinently, the absence of any approved antivirals to treat EVD.

Since there is more than one observation for each patient, the model also considered the possible correlations among the specified observation for the same patient (hence gee rather than a simple logistic model). The columns contain: the effect in the control arm, the effect in the IFN \u03b2-1a treated arm, and represent how the symptoms changed over time. If the OR was >1, then the frequency of the symptom increased over time, while if the OR was <1, the frequency of the symptom decreased over time.

Although the current outbreak of EVD in West Africa was declared over on January 14, 2016 by the WHO, a new case was reported in Sierra Leone in the ensuing days with identified contacts at risk of developing EVD. Therefore, there continues to exist the possibility of resurgence of EVD or emergence of a divergent strain [19] . Certainly, vaccines offer the potential to protect populations from a resurgent EBOV strain identical to that reflected in the current vaccines under evaluation, yet it remains unclear whether these vaccines offer post-exposure protection or what the duration of protection is prior to exposure. Accordingly, the need exists for antivirals that provide a broader spectrum of activity against different EBOV strains. Viewed altogether, the data support further evaluation of IFN \u03b2-1a for the treatment of EVD.",
