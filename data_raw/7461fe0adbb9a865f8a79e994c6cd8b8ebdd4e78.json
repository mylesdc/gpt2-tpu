Two types of vaccines have been used against it since the 1950s and 1960s: IPVinactivated polio vaccine, which induces humoral immunity but does not prevent intestinal infection, and OPVan attenuated oral polio vaccine which induces a local and mucosal immune response in the intestinal mucous membrane and is later excreted. It thus not only protects the individual but can also be spread to others in close contact with the vaccinated individual and induce the \"incidental\" immunization of people who have not been directly vaccinated. A recipient of an OPV or an unimmunized close contact may rarely develop paralytic polio as a result of the vaccine. However, giving an OPV to someone already immunized with an IPV is very safe [1] .",

The Ministry of Health chose to provide the public with information about the vaccine without sanctioning parents who decided not to vaccinate their children. In choosing this policy, the Ministry of Health sought to preserve the parents' right for autonomy. A petition against the vaccination campaign later was submitted to the Supreme Court by an anti-vaccination group. The petitioners claimed that the Ministry of Health was not providing sufficient information about the nature and the dangers of OPV including the fact that the vaccine does not benefit the children who receive it. The Court heard the case on August 29, 2013 and recommended that the petitioners withdraw their petition, which they did [7] .",

Gostin the public in a democratic society authorizes the government to act for the common welfare. The government thus possesses the sole authority to empower, regulate, or carry out activities designed for the protection or promotion of the general health, safety, and welfare of the population [12] . The IOM emphasizes that \"There are solid legal, theoretical, and practical grounds for government in its various forms to assume primary responsibility for the public's health\" [12, 13] . 1 The Israel Supreme Court (Justice Barak-Erez) addressed the issue in the 2013 Adalah decision which will be described in detail below [14] , and held that the market failure which derives from individual nonvaccination decisions grounded in the notion of \"herd immunity\" justifies government intervention. Moreover, the Israeli Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty ( \u00a74) provides that the government has an obligation to protect the life, body, and dignity of every individual. Although the right for health has not been recognized as a basic right, an intervention meant for the eradication of a contagious disease may be considered essential to the protection of human dignity as well as human life and the human body [14, 15] . 2 In attempting to promote vaccination compliance, public health authorities can employ such intervention strategies as client reminders or recalls, the enhancement of access to vaccination services, and the provision of information to target populations or vaccination providers [16, 17] . However, sanctions against individuals who refuse vaccination require specific legislative authorization.",

The committee advised that less intrusive measures should be adopted in order to increase vaccination compliance, and also stated that a mandatory vaccination requirement would not be effective due to enforcement difficulties and the expected number of exemptions that would be granted to parents opposing vaccination. It was therefore decided that a vaccination reminder would be given to all parents who registered their child in an educational institution but that no measures aimed at compelling them to do so would be taken. The possibility of using preschool registration to promote vaccination compliance was re-discussed by the Advisory Committee on Infectious Diseases and Immunization in January 2013. Among other things, the committee discussed the suggestion of requiring a confirmation from a Mother and Child Clinic that the child entering preschool had been vaccinated in the manner recommended by the Ministry of Health. It also discussed a suggestion requiring parents who oppose vaccination to sign an objection form. Both suggestions were rejected by the committee for several reasons: first, Israeli law does not permit the requirement of vaccinations as a precondition for education; second, the committee believed municipalities would encounter difficulties in implementing the requirement; and third, there was insufficient evidence to indicate that the implementation of such policies would be efficient and that it would promote vaccination compliance [22] . The committee agreed that the Central Vaccination Registry (which did not exist at the time) would be used to remind parents to vaccinate their children and to promote vaccination compliance.",

While curative medicine deals with the health of an individual, public health interventions deal with the health of a population. A population's interests may sometimes contradict individual interests and justify interventions which do not assure an individual's consent or despite her or his refusal [36] [37] [38] . Moreover, it is unrealistic to obtain informed consent to a public health intervention when the health professional cannot predict whether a specific unvaccinated individual will benefit from the intervention in the future. This is because those members of the population who would stand to gain from the intervention are unknown, and their number can only be estimated in advance [39] . The legitimacy for exercising state power without receiving \"informed consent\" derives from Social Contract Theory, which suggests that people agree to accept certain obligations by choosing to live in a society. The presumption of obligation acceptance is based on the \"tacit consent\" of an individual who resides in the state to government rule in exchange for the benefits of society. Other sources for the presumption of obligation acceptance are the \"hypothetical consent\" of an individual to be bound by the state which is necessary for social functioning, as well as a fairness of balancing the state's benefits to the individual against the limits that are necessary for maintaining those benefits [36, 37, 40] .",

According to the state law, any refusal to the smallpox vaccination resulted in penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment. Henning Jacobson refused both the vaccination and the payment of a $5 fine. Jacobson argued before the U.S. Supreme Court that the Massachusetts law violated the due process and equal protection provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment (\"nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\") Jacobson further alleged that it was unreasonable for the state to interfere with his liberty when he had not been taken with any illness. The US Supreme Court decided in favor of Massachusetts in 1905, declaring that the state had the authority to enact health laws of every description to guard the common good in whatever way the citizens, through their elective representatives, thought appropriate: \"Even liberty itself, the greatest of all rights, is not [an] unrestricted license to act according to one's own will\" [45] .",

Given that the eradication of contagious diseases reduces medical care expenses and adds years of productive life to members of society for a small per-person cost, an increased compliance with OPVs with a view to the eradication of polio is considered a proper purpose according to the aforementioned economic-theoretical methods [46, 47] . 3 However, economic methods, which help in the determination of public health policy, and especially in cases of limited public health resources, do not reflect moral considerations and preferences that may also justify the violation of individual autonomy. One of these moral considerations is social justice, which is a commitment to the attainment of a sufficient level of health for all [48, 49] . The eradication of polio such as would protect the unimmunized population correlates with these social justice values. Moreover, the Syrian Civil War that was still raging in 2013 made it increasingly more difficult for Syrians to access medical services and vaccines. Many Syrian residents and refugees were not vaccinated against polio and were at risk of poliovirus infection. The promotion of polio eradication in the region under these circumstances would have the potential of protecting the vulnerable Syrian population. Protecting population health (as opposed to community health) without national or geographical limitations correlates with the \"global justice\" which is required in a globalized world where communicable diseases can easily cross borders [50] .",

Low compliance rates which derive from the vaccination hesitancy of Israeli parents who seek an open and trusting relationship with their health care providers and who wish to make autonomous decisions regarding vaccination would not be increased by sanctions [55, 56] . Sanctions would also be certain to provoke Israeli parents who already believe that the government is too intrusive with respect to their freedoms as well as parents who are convinced that the vaccine would endanger their child 5 . 6 Beside concerns that sanctions would not stimulate hesitant parents as well as parents who oppose government interference, the sanctions' effectiveness would likely be reduced by enforcement difficulties: imposing the obligation to follow, register and report the immunization status of every Israeli child would require additional budgetary allocations to the health system. The lack of such an additional budget would interfere with the attainment of the stated objective. 7 Over and above budgetary shortfalls, the imposition of sanctions on parents who refuse to vaccinate their children also involves legal and ethical issues associated with the registration of unvaccinated children. The Israeli Privacy Protection Law (1981) forbids the disclosure of an individual's private matters (including medical information), although a violation of this privacy is permitted when it is done in accordance with a valid legal provision. The Public Health Ordinance (in \u00a765b) authorizes the Minister of Health to establish a national immunization registry and thus legitimizes the disclosure of vaccination statuses [57] . However, the ethical dilemma that exists between the violation of healthy people's medical confidentiality and the promotion public health remains and requires an in depth discussion in and of itself. Moreover, the registry's legal objectives were the supervision of vaccines administered at public Mother and Child Clinics, HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations) and schools as well as the implementation of \u00a768 of the National Insurance Law, which deprived an additional child allowance from the nonvaccinated. The implementation of child allowance reductions is no longer relevant as the associated legal amendment has been repealed. The registry's sole objective at present is thus the supervision of the vaccines administered to the population. Using these records in order to impose sanctions on unvaccinated children would deviate from this objective and would very likely provoke opposition [58] .",

If we were to overcome parental opposition and enforcement difficulties, and conclude that a mandatory OPV would be an effective intervention for promoting compliance and eradicating polio, we must examine whether the enforcement of OPVs through criminal sanctions would also be the least autonomy-infringing intervention from an effectiveness perspective. According to Childress et al. [38] , \"The fact that a policy will infringe a general moral consideration provides a strong moral reason to seek an alternative strategy that is less morally troubling\". 8 Reviews of evidence regarding interventions which sought to improve vaccination coverage in children, adolescents and adults, hold that strong scientific evidence supports the assumption that non-intrusive interventions (i.e. client or provider reminder/recall or expanded access to health care settings) can be effective enough in improving vaccination coverage [16] . In the Adalah case [14] , both Justice Arbel and Justice Barak-Erez held that deducting an additional child allowance from parents who refuse to vaccinate their children is the least infringing intervention that would promote vaccination compliance, and that a criminal sanction would surely be more intrusive.",

It was noted that a multi-country response was needed despite the fact that polio cases had only been detected in Syria, given the ongoing civil war in this country and the mass displacement of its population into neighboring countries. \"The primary goal is to ensure that oral polio vaccine (OPV) is urgently delivered into all communities\" [51] . 5 Sanctions applied against those who refuse vaccination (depriving the right to education) in the US resulted in increased immunization rates [16, 62, 63] . However, given that the majority of the population in Israel complies with vaccination recommendations voluntarily, and in light of Israeli parents' motivation toward making autonomous decisions, the imposition of a mandatory vaccination may result in resistance and attain the opposite of its intended purpose [56, 64] . 6 The enactment of the Vaccination Act in England (1853), which imposed fines on parents who failed to allow their children to be vaccinated, led to riots in the streets and to serious protests made not only by those opposing the vaccination itself but also by opponents of government intrusion on personal autonomy [19, 20] . 7 The work of ensuring that all US students were vaccinated according to school admission laws required the cooperation of both health and education administrators with different priorities. School principals had difficulty keeping track of students' medical records and claimed that budget shortages prevented the implementation of enforcement measures [19] . 8 Gostin suggests that adoption of equally effective and less restrictive alternatives would also encourage voluntary compliance [60] . 9 Imposing tort liability on parents who refuse to vaccinate their children may also encourage vaccination. However, such liability may only be imposed when the parents' choice of non-vaccination results in harm to others. Proving that a particular unvaccinated child transmitted a disease to another and caused harm can be a difficult and in some cases an even impossible task [65] . 10 In the Adalah case, Justice Barak-Erez (in \u00b665 of the Court's decision) held that public education was essential to promoting compliance with vaccination, and referred to Alberstein M, Davidovitch N. .Therapeutic Jurisprudence and Public Health: Israeli Perspectives. Bar Ilan studies. 2010; 26: 549, which called for the implementation of therapeutic Jurisprudence in public health [31] . 11 The minority opinion in the Adalah case considered the partial deprivation of child benefits as a financial sanction which would be legitimate as part of a general piece of legislation that would address vaccination issues [26] . 12 According to the Nuffield Council of Bioethics, the \"intervention ladder\" relates to public health interventions in general, and includes both intrusive and nonintrusive interventions which do not require legislation. 13 The law should clarify the risk which justifies a certain sanction according to the mode of transmission, the risk's duration, the probability of harm and the severity of harm [12] . 14 The Israeli Mental Healthcare Law 1991, which replaced a former law passed in 1955, is an example of a statute that balances society's interest in protecting the individual or the public from the symptoms of mental illnesses against the need to promote human rights and individual autonomy. Among other things, the law provides for limited psychiatric discretion in the imposition of forced hospitalization, and further provides for the option of appealing a psychiatric decision, as well as the entitlement to legal counseling (for the individual facing hospitalization).
