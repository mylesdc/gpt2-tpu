Amino acid sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicated the emergence of a new Moroccan genotype, clustering with regionally related isolates from Spain (Spain/05/866) and belonging to a new sub-genotype. Conclusion: Our sequencing results demonstrate a co-circulation of wild-type infectious bronchitis viruses in broiler chickens. These results justify permanent monitoring of circulating strains in order to rationally modify vaccination strategies to make them appropriate to the evolving field situation.",

IBV has a linear, single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity of approximately 27 kb in length and produces enveloped virions. IBV particles consist of three major structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The spike of IBV is formed by post-translational cleavage of S into two separate polypeptide components, S1 and S2 [5, 6] . S1 mediates virion attachment to IBV host cells and is a major target of neutralizing antibodies in chickens. Genotype evolution of IBV is associated primarily with changes in the S1amino-acidsequence [7, 8] . Hence, the evolutionary characterization of IBV is mainly based on the analysis of the variable S1 gene or the expressed S1 protein [9, 10] .",

Six isolates were obtained, of which isolates designated D, E, F, H, and M were found to be serologically related to the Massachusetts (Mass) serotype, whereas the sixth isolate, G, differed from the Mass serotype and other serotypes known at the time. Importantly, El-Houadfi et al. demonstrated that Mass-based IBV vaccines provided poor protection against infection with isolate G [15] . In 2004, Alarabi conducted a study to determine the relationship between IBV and nephropathogenic disease outbreaks observed in broiler flocks in Morocco between 1996 and 2000. Three different groups of IBV isolates were identified using RT-PCR coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Group I belonged to the Mass serotype, whereas groups II and III were distinct. Isolate 12/97 of group III, found to be closely related to isolate G, caused more severe kidney lesions and higher lethality in experimentally infected animals compared to isolate 7/97 of group II [16] . In 2005, El Bouqdaoui et al., while studying nephropathogenic IBV using RT-PCR and RFLP techniques, identified five genotypes, three of which differed from vaccine strains [17] .",

The official data regarding the general poultry rearing systems in Morocco are: broiler production, 450 million/year (among 6,800 farms); layers: 20 million/year (250 farms); turkeys: 12 million/year (25 % imported d-old chicks); broiler breeders: 3.2 million/year (70 % imported from Spain and 30 % from other European countries); 48 hatcheries. The Interprofessional Federation of Poultry Sector (FISA) aims to develop exports of poultry products in particular to Northern and Western Africa. FISA is affiliated with Association of Moroccan Exporters (ASMEX) under the objective of promoting poultry product export in Africa, including chicks, hatching eggs, and compound feed for poultry. In 2012, 6.7 million hatching eggs and 1.9-million-d-old chicks were exported to Mauritania, Mali, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Senegal, and 25,000 tons of compound feed were exported to Mauritania. Breeder chicks (182,000) were imported in January 2014 (an increase of 28 % compared to 2013). However, imports of layer and broiler breeder and turkey poults declined in recent years, mainly due the development of local production.",

Vaccination programs largely rely on the use of the IBV Massachusetts strain, which is also the most commonly used IBV vaccine strain in Morocco. However, despite the use of this vaccine, the common presences of IB in vaccinated chickens continue to have a major negative economic impact [18] . In this study, IB was diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2013 in southern and central regions of Morocco. Suspected IBV infections were found in 47 commercial broiler chicken farms. Among these, three flocks showed severe clinical signs and mortality.

Of those isolates, three isolates, classified as the Moroccan Italy 02 genotype, underwent further sequencing to include all three hypervariable S1regions (nucleotides 1-1,095). These three IBV strains were isolated from trachea, lungs, and kidneys of broiler chickens. Between the first and fourth passage, virus propagation from the three suspect samples in specific pathogen-free eggs resulted in characteristic IBV lesions (e.g., curled and dwarfed embryos with head pressed over the feet and covered by a thickened amnion)in 90 %-100 % of the embryos. Results of both RT-PCR targeting the IBV N gene and RT-PCR using primers amplifying a partial sequence of the IBV S1 gene were positive, confirming the identity of the three isolates. The amplified partial S1 fragments (approximately 700 bp in length) of the three isolates were sequenced. The sequences were submitted to GenBank and assigned the accession numbers KJ701019, KJ701020 and KM594187 for isolates gammaCoV/chicken/ IBV/Morocco/I38/2013 (IBV/Morocco/38), gammaCoV/ chicken/IBV/Morocco/I30/2013 (IBV/Morocco/30), and gammaCoV/chicken/IBV/Morocco/I01/2013 (IBV/Morocco/ 01), respectively (Table 1) .",

Phylogenetic analyses comparing the partial S1 gene sequences of the three Moroccan field isolates with those of reference and variant strain sequences revealed that the Moroccan isolates were 69.4 % to 76.8 % homologous with Spanish isolates of the Italian 02 genotype [19] . This similarity can be explained by the geographical proximity and close transboundary of Morocco and Spain. Moreover, these two countries have an ancient history of commercial exchanges.

On d 2 after inoculation, three eggs were chilled at 4\u00b0C for 2 h, and the allantoic fluids were harvested, centrifuged at 8,000 rpm (xxx x g) for 15 min, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The remaining eggs were further incubated for 5 more d and observed for typical embryonic lesions of IBV infection, such as dwarfing, stunting, and curling.
