Patients over 65 years old who were newly diagnosed with PD during 2007-2011 were identified. The integrative therapy group was defined as patients treated with both Korean medicine (KM) and biomedicine, and the monotherapy group consisted of patients treated with biomedicine alone. From PD diagnosis to 2013, the prevalence and annual length of hospitalization because of PD and major complications (dementia, depression and pneumonia/sepsis) were analyzed using logistic regression, ANOVA and t-tests after propensity score (PS) matching with a 1:1 ratio.",

The prevalence of hospitalization due to pneumonia/sepsis was 0.50 times (95% C.I.: 0.26-0.96) lower in the integrative therapy group than the monotherapy group, which was statistically significant (p = 0.038).

However, PD is progressive and worsens with time, and there is currently no cure; accordingly, it is necessary to treat and care for PD-related symptoms of patients (Elbaz et al., 2016) . Therefore, about 40% of PD patients use alternative therapies including acupuncture, tai chi, and herbal medicine to complement their standard treatments (Ghaffari and Kluger, 2014) . Indeed, previous studies have shown that herbal formulas, acupuncture and tai chi might be safe and beneficial to PD patients (Bega and Zadikoff, 2014; Cwiekala-Lewis et al., 2017; Lee and Lim, 2017; Noh et al., 2017; Shan et al., 2018) .

Patients who were diagnosed with PD during the eligibility period were excluded; therefore, only those newly diagnosed with PD from 2007 to 2011 were included (Figure 1 ). Patients were divided into two groups by treatment type, an integrative therapy group that received both biomedicine and KM, and a monotherapy group that was only treated with biomedicine.

The propensity score (PS) was used to increase the level of causality revealed in the observational study (D'Agostino, 1998) . Specifically, the PS was used to match the subjects with similar characteristics in the two groups. Several variables were used to create the PS index: age, sex, index year, CCI, treatment period in neurology, hospitalization period in neurology, severity of disability and anti-parkinsonism medication. Comparison of the PS between groups was repeated using the greedy algorithm and 1: 1 matching continued until there were no more matching pairs (Parsons, 2001) . The PS fit was confirmed by c-statistics and the Hosmer and Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit test. In the case of a c-statistic value over 0.5, the Hosmer and Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit test was considered to be good when the p-value was 0.05 or higher (D'Agostino, 1998; Maldonado and Greenland, 2002) . The prevalence and annual length of hospitalization were analyzed using logistic regression analysis and t-tests. A pvalue < 0.05 was considered significant. Additionally, the integrative therapy group was divided into two groups by treatment period, less than 30 days and over 30 days. The prevalence and annual length of hospitalization were analyzed using logistic regression analysis and ANOVA. After ANOVA, Duncan's post hoc test was applied. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Finally, survival analysis of the integrative therapy group and monotherapy group was performed using the Cox proportional hazard analysis.",

The prevalence of melanoma in PD patients taking levodopa is significantly higher than that of the general population (Shalaby and Louis, 2016) . Dementia in PD patients is a common complication of PD that makes treatment difficult and leads to disability. Depression is also a common complication of PD (Brown and Marsden, 1984; Cummings, 1992) , and infectious diseases such as pneumonia are considered factors that increase mortality in PD patients (Pinter et al., 2015) . Additionally, patients with a longer duration of PD have more complications and lower quality of life (Ou et al., 2018) . Subthalamic stimulation has been attempted to improve quality of life with positive results. However, surgery can be accompanied by unintended adverse events, even death (Dafsari et al., 2018) . Therefore, the use of relatively safe treatment regimens such as CAM should be considered. This study investigated whether KM could reduce hospitalization in the management of PD patients in the South Korea. Two groups of patients, an integrative therapy group using both biomedicine and KM and a monotherapy group using only biomedicine, were compared by PS estimation and matching based on confounders such as sex, age, comorbidity, and anti-parkinsonism medication. The prevalence of hospitalization because of pneumonia/sepsis was significantly lower (0.50 times) in the integrative therapy group than the monotherapy group. Traditional medicine may have beneficial immunomodulatory effects for preventing viral infections (Poon et al., 2006) . For severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), advantages to treatment with integrative Chinese medicine and biomedicine were observed when compared with that of biomedicine alone, especially with respect to improvement of clinical symptoms, promotion of the recovery of immune function and reduction of treatment duration (Qiang et al., 2003) . Hence, KM seems to have a positive effect on infectious diseases such as pneumonia and sepsis.",

For example, PD patients with acupuncture showed significant improvement in motor function compared to those without acupuncture. Moreover, brain imaging revealed that putamen and the primary motor cortex were activated in patients with acupuncture (Chae et al., 2009) . Korean herbal formulas such as Chungsimyeoldatang or Yeoldahanso-tang induce autophagy and prevent diseases associated with misfolded/aggregated proteins in various neurodegenerative disorders, including PD (Bae et al., 2011 (Bae et al., , 2015 . In China, 48.6% of patients underwent CAM treatment and herbal medication, primarily rehabilitation exercise and acupuncture. These treatments were effective in half of the patients who received them, while they produced negative results in 11% of the patients (Pan et al., 2018) . Additionally, the incidence and prevalence of PD in Asian countries, including South Korea, have been shown to be lower than in Europe and America (Pringsheim et al., 2014) . This difference may result from genetic and ethnic differences, but the possibility of the effects of CAM, including KM, cannot be ruled out.",

First, the number of subjects was not sufficient because of data limitations; therefore, we cannot be sure of whether the non-significance of results is due to the absence of a relationship between the groups or to a lack of statistical power. Accordingly, comparative studies with increased duration and number of patients are required to clarify the effects KM on PD. Second, we assessed whether PD and its complications have been wellcontrolled by alternative outcomes-related measures such as the prevalence of hospitalization and annual length of hospitalization after PD diagnosis. Generally, the outcome of PD recovery or management is evaluated based on the UPDRS, SCOPA, or the PDQ-39. However, the NHIS-NSC does not contain this information because it consists of only health insurance claim data. Third, the number of KM monotherapy patients was very small. In the Korean health insurance system, PD is a serious rare disease that is registered and managed by the government. After PD patients are confirmed and registered 90% of the cost of treatment is supported by the government. In addition to receiving standard drug therapies such as levodopa, registered patients can also concurrently use KM such as herbal formulas and acupuncture if they desire. Therefore, further study is necessary to analyze the total national insurance dataset because the NHIS-NSC, which was used in our study, is equivalent to only 2.2% of the population of the South Korea.",
