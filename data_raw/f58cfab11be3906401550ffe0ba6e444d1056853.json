            "text": "RNA helicases and chaperones are the two major classes of RNA remodeling proteins, which function to remodel RNA structures and/or RNA-protein interactions, and are required for all aspects of RNA metabolism. Although some virus-encoded RNA helicases/chaperones have been predicted or identified, their RNA remodeling activities in vitro and functions in the viral life cycle remain largely elusive. Enteroviruses are a large group of positivestranded RNA viruses in the Picornaviridae family, which includes numerous important human pathogens. Herein, we report that the nonstructural protein 2C ATPase of enterovirus 71 (EV71), which is the major causative pathogen of hand-foot-and-mouth disease and has been regarded as the most important neurotropic enterovirus after poliovirus eradication, functions not only as an RNA helicase that 3 0 -to-5 0 unwinds RNA helices in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent manner, but also as an RNA chaperone that destabilizes helices bidirectionally and facilitates strand annealing and complex RNA structure formation independently of ATP. We also determined that the helicase activity is based on the EV71 2C ATPase middle domain, whereas the C-terminus is indispensable for its RNA chaperoning activity. By promoting RNA template recycling, 2C ATPase facilitated EV71 RNA synthesis in vitro; when 2C ATPase helicase activity was impaired, EV71 RNA replication and virion production were mostly abolished in cells, indicating that 2C ATPase -mediated RNA remodeling plays a critical role in the enteroviral life cycle. Furthermore, the RNA helicase and chaperoning activities of 2C ATPase are also conserved in coxsackie A virus 16 (CAV16), another important enterovirus. Altogether, our findings are the first to demonstrate the RNA helicase and chaperoning activities associated with enterovirus 2C ATPase , and our study provides both in vitro and cellular evidence for their potential roles during viral RNA replication. These findings increase our understanding of enteroviruses and the two types of RNA remodeling activities.",

Among the nonstructural proteins of enteroviruses or picornaviruses, protein 2C ATPase is the most conserved and complex but the least understood. On the basis of sequence analyses, this protein has been predicted as a putative superfamily 3 (SF3) helicase that supposedly plays a pivotal role in enteroviral RNA replication. However, attempts to determine the helicase activity associated with 2C ATPase have been unsuccessful. We found that eukaryotically expressed EV71 or CAV16 2C ATPase does possess an ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity that 3 0 !5 0 unwinds RNA helices like other SF3 helicases; surprisingly, it also functions as an RNA chaperone that remodels RNA structures in an ATP-independent manner. Moreover, we determined the domain requirements for these two RNA remodeling activities associated with 2C ATPase and provide both in vitro and cellular evidence of their potential roles during viral RNA replication. Additionally, our study provides the first evidence that RNA helicase and chaperoning activities can be integrated within one protein, thereby introducing an extended view of RNA remodeling proteins.",

To make the scenario more complex, RNA molecules frequently function via transient base pairing with target RNAs and/or dynamic association/dissociation with distinct RNA-binding proteins [3] . However, correct folding of RNAs is quite challenging and time-consuming, because RNAs can easily become trapped in thermodynamically stable intermediates that are misfolded and inactive. In response, cells and viruses encode a variety of \"helper\" or RNA remodeling proteins, such as RNA helicases and RNA chaperones, that can destabilize RNA-RNA or RNA-DNA base pairing, thereby lowing the thermodynamic barrier between RNA conformations and promoting the proper formation of RNA tertiary structures [4] [5] [6] .

They are thought to participate in most ATP-dependent remodeling of structured RNAs and are classified into six superfamilies (SFs), designated SF1 to SF6, on the basis of conserved helicase motifs [7] . On the other hand, RNA chaperones are a heterogeneous group of proteins that share no consensus sequences or motifs but are able to destabilize RNA duplexes and assist in the formation of more globally stable RNA structures. The major difference between RNA chaperones and helicases is that RNA chaperones do not require ATP binding or hydrolysis for their remodeling activities [8] . (Of note, the definition of RNA chaperones is sometimes blurred, as some publications have defined helicases as a subgroup of ATP-dependent RNA chaperones [2] . Herein, like in most publications, we define RNA helicases and chaperones as two separate classes of the RNA remodelers for the sake of clarity.)",

            "text": "Enteroviruses are a large group of positive-stranded RNA viruses in the Picornaviridae family that contain numerous important human pathogens, including poliovirus, enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackie viruses, and echoviruses. They cause approximately 3 billion human infections annually and are responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases, ranging from relatively mild conditions, such as common cold, upper respiratory illness, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), to severe conditions such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, neonatal sepsis-like disease, and poliomyelitis [13] . So far, although vaccination has almost eradicated poliomyelitis worldwide [14] , no effective vaccine or antiviral therapy is available for many other important human enteroviruses, particularly neurotropic EV71, which is the major causative pathogen for HFMD and a serious lethal threat to children. Enterovirus encodes a single polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into separate structural and nonstructural proteins. Among them, the multifunctional protein 2C ATPase is the most conserved and complex but the least understood ( Fig 1A) . Enterovirus 2C ATPase has been reported to participate in diverse processes, including RNA binding [15, 16] , RNA replication [17] [18] [19] , membrane anchoring and rearrangement [20, 21] , autophagy inhibition [22] , encapsidation and viral morphogenesis [23, 24] , and suppression of nuclear factor kappa B activation [25] . 2C ATPase has long been predicted as a putative SF3 helicase on the basis of its AAA+ ATPase activity and conserved SF3 signature motifs (Fig 1B) [26, 27] . Similar to other well-defined SF3 helicases, such as Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (LTag), human papillomavirus (HPV) E1, and adeno-associated virus (AAV) Rep, enterovirus 2C ATPase has been reported to form homo-oligomeric ringlike structures in vitro, which is required for its ATPase activity [28] . Moreover, this protein appears to associate with vRNA in the vRNA replication complexes in infected cells [29] , implying that 2C ATPase directly participates in enteroviral RNA replication. However, previous attempts to determine the helicase activity associated with 2C ATPase or other enteroviral proteins have been unsuccessful [27] . Thus, whether enteroviral or picornaviral RNA replication requires the involvement of any virus-encoded RNA remodeling activity is not known, and this gap hinders our understanding of this large group of medically important pathogenic viruses.",

This finding obtained from an insect picorna-like virus prompted us to determine whether enterovirus 2C ATPase could be an RNA remodeler. Herein, we report that although bacterially expressed EV71 2C ATPase did not exhibit any RNA remodeling activity, eukaryotically expressed EV71 2C ATPase functions not only as an RNA helicase that unwinds RNA helices from 3 0 to 5 0 in an ATP-dependent manner but also as an RNA chaperone that destabilizes helices from either direction and facilitates strand annealing and complex RNA structure formation independently of ATP. Moreover, we determined the domain requirements for these two RNA remodeling activities associated with 2C ATPase and showed that protein 2C ATPase facilitates the EV71 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)-mediated synthesis of vRNA from vRNA template in vitro. When the helicase activity of 2C ATPase was disrupted by point mutation, the RNA replication and virus production of EV71 were mostly abolished in cells. These data indicate that 2C ATPase -mediated RNA remodeling plays a critical role in the enteroviral life cycle, particularly in enteroviral replication. In addition, our data show that the RNA helicase and chaperoning activities are also conserved in CAV16 2C ATPase .",

Our structural alignment of EV71 2C ATPase and AAV2 Rep40 shows that the predicted HC domain of 2C ATPase is structurally similar with the counterpart region of Rep40. Moreover, similarly with Rep40, 2C ATPase is also predicted to contain a P-loop connecting with the central \u03b2-sheet, and the predicted ATP binding site of 2C ATPase is also exposed to the exterior and perfectly overlapped with the structurally determined ATP/ADP binding site of Rep40 in the structural alignment of these two proteins ( Fig 1D) .

In total, four proteins (MBP-2C ATPase , \u03b1-tubulin, actin and cytochrome P450) were identified with FDR value of 0.97%. MBP-2C ATPase turned out to be the highest scoring protein (score: 11200) identified with high protein coverage of 81.6%.

The helix unwinding assay was conducted by incubating the RNA helix substrate with purified MBP-2C ATPase , followed by gel electrophoresis. Interestingly, our data showed that, although bacterially expressed MBP-2C ATPase did not unwind the RNA helix in the presence of MgCl 2 and ATP ( Fig 1F, lane 5) , consistent with observations reported previously by another group [27] , eukaryotically expressed MBP-2C ATPase efficiently unwound the RNA helix substrate under the same conditions ( Fig 1F and Fig 2A) . Of note, EoV 2C ATPase and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 [30, 34] were used as positive controls in this assay (Fig 2A) . Moreover, EV71 2C ATPase could unwind the RNA duplex with 42 matched base pairs but not the duplex with 49 matched base pairs (S3 Fig) , as the latter substrate might be too long to be unwound. Altogether, these results indicate that EV71 2C ATPase can unwind an RNA helix when the protein is eukaryotically expressed.",

Each substrate was then incubated with 2C ATPase for the helix unwinding assay. Our results showed that EV71 2C ATPase could unwind either the 3 0 -or 5 0 -protruded RNA helix (Fig 3C) , and its efficiency to unwind the 3 0 -protruded helix was apparently higher than its efficiency to unwind the 5 0 -protruded one (Fig 3C, lanes 3 vs. 6 ). Moreover, 2C ATPase could not unwind the blunt-ended helix ( Fig 3E) . All these experiments were independently repeated several times.

Our results showed that the ATPase activity of EV71 2C ATPase was strictly Mg 2+ -dependent, as this protein was almost unable to hydrolyze ATP in the absence of Mg 2+ (Fig 4F) . On the other hand, although 2C ATPase requires the presence of Mg 2+ to reach its optimal unwinding activity, it was still able to unwind a portion of the RNA helix in the absence of Mg 2+ or any divalent ions ( Fig 4G, lane 3; S4D Fig, lane 3) , further confirming that 2C ATPase retains partial helix unwinding activity in the absence of its ATPase activity. Moreover, when the Mg 2+ concentration was lower than 2 or 2.5 mM, increasing Mg 2+ concentrations gradually promoted both the ATPase and helix unwinding activities of EV71 (Fig 4F and 4G ), whereas at higher Mg 2+ concentrations (>2.5 mM), Mg 2+ inhibited both activities in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 4F and 4H ). Of note, both no protein supplementation and boiled MBP-2C ATPase were used as negative controls (S4C Fig, lanes 1 and 5) . In addition, the biochemical properties of EV71 2C ATPase , including the requirement of divalent ions (Mn 2+ , Ca 2+ , and Zn 2+ ) and pH, were also determined (S4D- S4F Fig) . Our data showed that while 2.5 mM Ca 2+ is dispensable for the helix unwinding activity of EV71 2C ATPase , 2.5 mM Mn 2+ or Zn 2+ blocked the helix unwinding by 2C ATPase (S4D Fig). When the concentration of Zn 2+ is higher than 0.5 mM, the presence of Zn 2+ completely blocked the helix unwinding activity of 2C ATPase (S4E Fig) . Moreover, EV71 2C ATPase prefers a neutral pH as an optimal reaction condition, as this protein exhibited the highest helix unwinding activity with pH 7.5 (S4F Fig) .",

            "text": "To distinguish these two activities, we designed a set of experiments based on their fundamental difference in helix unwinding directionality and ATP dependency. First, we constructed two RNA helix substrates, each of which contained the same 42-bp double-stranded region as well as a 6-nt 3 0 or 5 0 single-stranded protrusion ( Fig 5A) . Then, each helix substrate was reacted with MBP-2C ATPase in the absence or presence of ATP. Our results showed that although the 2C ATPase unwound the 3 0 -protruded helix in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig 5B  and 5E ), it unwound the 5 0 -protruded helix exactly like an RNA chaperone, which was able to unwind the helix in the absence of ATP, and increasing ATP concentrations could not further enhance the helix unwinding (Fig 5C and 5E ). Moreover, since the motif A \"GKS\" is recognized as the NTP binding site and the core ATPase site of SF3 helicases, we generated the ATPase-defective GK134AA mutant of 2C ATPase . Our data showed that the GK134AA 2C ATPase mutant was able to unwind the 5 0 -protruded helix substrate in the absence or presence of ATP at an efficiency similar to that of wild-type 2C ATPase , further confirming that the unwinding of the 5 0 -protruded helix by 2C ATPase is independent of its ATPase activity (Fig 5D  and 5E ). Furthermore, the unwinding activity of 2C ATPase on the 5 0 -protruded helix could not be promoted by any individual NTP (S5 Fig). Altogether, our data indicate that the 5 0 -protruded helix could be unwound via the RNA chaperone activity but not the helicase activity of 2C ATPase , whereas the 3 0 -protruded helix substrate could be unwound via both activities. These findings are consistent with our previous observation that 2C ATPase unwinds the 3 0 -protruded RNA helix more efficiently than the 5 0 -protruded one in the presence of ATP (Fig 3C) . We conclude that EV71 2C ATPase possesses an ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity that unwinds RNA helices with 3 0 !5 0 directionality, which is consistent with all known SF3 helicases [41] , together with an ATP-independent RNA chaperone activity that unwinds RNA helices from either direction. EV71 2C ATPase destabilizes structured RNA strands and stimulates annealing RNA chaperones are generally thought to destabilize misfolded RNAs and assist in the formation of more globally stable RNA structures. After determining that EV71 2C ATPase possesses an RNA chaperone activity, we adapted a canonical assay [42] to further verify and characterize EV71 2C ATPase . Two 42-nt complementary RNA strands, each of which formed defined stem-loop structures, were designed and constructed (Fig 6A) . Of the two, one strand was 5 0 HEX-labeled, and the other was not labeled as indicated. Equal amounts of HEX-labeled and non-labeled strands were incubated in the presence or absence of MBP-2C ATPase , and then gel shift assays were conducted to examine the hybridization of the two strands. Of note, all the experiments were ATP-free. Our results showed that although minimal spontaneous hybridization could be observed in the absence of 2C ATPase (Fig 6B, lanes 3-4; Fig 6C, lane 3; and Fig 6D, lanes 3-6) , the presence of EV71 2C ATPase dramatically enhanced the two strands' hybridization, as did EoV 2C, which is a well-defined RNA chaperone (Fig 6B, lanes 5-6) . Moreover, increasing either the amount of 2C ATPase or its incubation time resulted in an apparent increase in strand annealing (Fig 6C and 6D) . Overall, our data show that 2C ATPase can destabilize structured RNA strands and accelerate the formation of more stable hybrids, fitting the characteristic of RNA chaperones.",

Since the functionality of a hammerhead ribozyme strictly relies on its correct tertiary structure, hammerhead ribozymes often serve as the models for studying the structure and properties of RNAs. RNA chaperones are probably able to enhance the activity and turnover of ribozymes by promoting ribozyme formation, ribozyme-substrate association, and/or ribozyme dissociation from cleaved substrates. Therefore, a canonical hammerhead ribozyme enhancement assay [44] was used to further verify and characterize the RNA chaperone activity of EV71 2C ATPase . In this assay, unlabeled ribozyme RNA was reacted with a 5 0 HEX-labeled RNA substrate, and the cleavage was expected to take place 16 nts from the 5 0 end (indicated by arrow), resulting in a HEX-labeled 16-nt cleavage product that could be detected by electrophoresis (Fig 7A) . Our data showed that the presence of 2C ATPase effectively enhanced ribozyme activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 7B) , indicating that the RNA chaperone activity of EV71 2C ATPase can assist in the proper formation and function of relatively complex RNA structures.",

To assess the role of specific domains on the different activities of 2C ATPase , a series of truncations of EV71 2C ATPase were generated and eukaryotically expressed. Moreover, since the motif A \"GKS\" and motif C \"STN\" are conserved in SF3 helicases, the GK134AA and \u0394STN mutants of 2C ATPase were also generated. The predicted structures of these 2C ATPase fragments and mutagenesis sites are illustrated in S6A-S6C Fig  Our data showed that the GK134AA mutant of 2C ATPase lost most ATPase activity (Fig 8B) but retained the RNA chaperone activity that is insensitive to ATP, as determined in these and previous experiments (Figs 5D, 8C and 8D); the motif C deletion (\u0394STN) of 2C ATPase resulted in the loss of most helix unwinding activity (S6D Fig). Moreover, although 2C ATPase CTD had no detectable helix unwinding activity and little ATPase activity (Fig 8A, lane 5; and Fig 8B) , the loss of CTD resulted in the complete loss of helix unwinding in the absence of ATP ( Fig  8C, lane 4) , showing that the CTD is required for the RNA chaperone activity of 2C ATPase . Interestingly, in the presence of ATP, the helix unwinding activity of 2C ATPase \u0394CTD was partially restored (Fig 8D, lane 4) , indicating that the CTD plays an important but nonessential role in the helicase activity of 2C ATPase , probably by maintaining the proper structure of the 2C ATPase helicase core domain.",

It has been proposed that during vRNA replication of (+) RNA viruses, replicative intermediate double-stranded RNA must be unwound [45] . To assess the potential role of 2C ATPase in enteroviral RNA replication, we first incubated purified His 6tagged 3D pol , the EV71 RdRP, with the (-)RNA template [i.e., we transcribed in vitro the 3 0 -end 1-357 nts of EV71 (-)RNA], and with an excessive amount (at a ratio of 5:1) of primer RNA, which was a long oligonucleotide and was pre-annealed to the template in the presence or absence of 2C ATPase (Fig 9A) . Of note, the RdRP reactions were conducted at 22\u00b0C as previously described [46] , and at this temperature, EV71 2C ATPase was still able to hydrolyze ATP and unwind the RNA helix, although both activities were moderately lower at 22\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C (S4A and S4C Fig). Our data showed that the presence of 2C ATPase significantly promoted the synthesis of (+)RNA strands from the (-)RNA template by 3D pol , and the promoting effect of 2C ATPase was dose dependent (Fig 9B and 9C; Fig 9D, lower panel; and Fig 9E) . Interestingly, when the amount of primer RNA was less than that of the (-)RNA template (at a ratio of 1:5), the presence of increasing amounts of 2C ATPase was unable to promote (+)RNA synthesis ( Fig  9D, upper panel; and Fig 9E) , indicating that the major role of the 2C ATPase helicase activity is not to directly enhance the RdRP activity of 3D pol or smoothen the template. Of note, when the primer was absent, 3D pol was unable to mediate RdRP or elongation reaction in the presence or absence of 2C ATPase (Fig 9F, lanes 2 and 3) . In addition, the GK134AA mutant of 2C ATPase failed to promote (+)RNA synthesis as expected (Fig 9F, lanes 6-8; and Fig 9G) . Altogether, our results show that 2C ATPase can facilitate the 3D pol -mediated production of enteroviral RNA strands in vitro via promoting the efficiency to re-utilize the RNA template.",

            "text": "As the most conserved nonstructural protein among all enteroviruses and even picornaviruses, 2C ATPase has been reported to participate in diverse processes critical for the enteroviral life cycle. Although this protein has long been predicted as a putative SF3 helicase on the basis of its AAA+ ATPase activity and conserved SF3 motifs, its potential role in viral RNA remodeling and replication remains elusive. Previous studies have shown that the ATPase activity of poliovirus 2C ATPase could be inhibited by GnHCl. This compound is a potent inhibitor of enteroviral RNA replication in vivo, which has been reported to inhibit poliovirus (-)-vRNA synthesis and the uridylylation of the protein primer VPg [38, 39] , suggesting that the ATPase activity of 2C ATPase is critical for enteroviral RNA replication. Here we report that protein 2C ATPase of EV71 possesses a nonconventional RNA remodeling activity that can function as both an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and an ATP-independent RNA chaperone and facilitates EV71 RdRP-mediated vRNA synthesis from vRNA template in vitro. The mutation of GK134 to AA, which disrupts 2C ATPase helicase activity, mostly abolished EV71 RNA replication and virus production. These data indicate that 2C ATPase -mediated RNA remodeling is pivotal for the enteroviral life cycle. Moreover, our results show that the RNA remodeling activities of 2C ATPase are also conserved in CAV16. Although 2C ATPase contains conserved motifs typical of SF3 helicases, previous attempts to identify its helicase activity were unsuccessful [27] , leading us to ask why the RNA helicase/ chaperoning activity of 2C ATPase can be detected in this study. It is noteworthy that the recombinant poliovirus 2C ATPase protein used in the previous assay was produced in E. coil, while the EV71 and CAV16 2C ATPase proteins used here were expressed using an eukaryotic system (baculovirus). Interestingly, we found that although both the prokaryotically and eukaryotically expressed 2C ATPase proteins possessed similar ATPase activity (S7 Fig), only the eukaryotically expressed 2C ATPase protein possessed the RNA duplex unwinding activity (Fig 1F) . Moreover, the eukaryotically expressed 2C ATPase showed an apparently higher molecular mass than the prokaryotically expressed one (Fig 1E) , implying that the former protein contains some posttranslational modifications that potentially play a critical role(s) in the helicase activity of 2C ATPase . Future research would uncover the potential post-translational modifications of 2C ATPase .",

            "text": "Although they have mainly been characterized in vitro, the RNA remodeling activities of virus-encoded proteins are generally believed to play critical roles in the viral life cycle [48] . The RNA genomes contain multiple cis-acting elements, including the 5 0 cloverleaf, 3 0 UTRpoly(A), internal origin of replication (oriI or cre) [49, 50] , internal ribosomal entry site [51, 52] , and the cloverleaf at the 3 0 -end of (-)-vRNA [53] [54] [55] . These highly structured RNA elements play indispensable roles in the replication, translation, and encapsidation of enteroviral RNAs [23, 24, 54, 56] and probably require the RNA chaperoning activity of 2C ATPase to facilitate their proper folding and refolding. On the other hand, during the RNA replication of RNA viruses, replicative intermediate dsRNA must be unwound, thereby allowing the efficient recycling of vRNA template for progeny vRNA synthesis. It is very likely that the RNA helicase activity of 2C ATPase plays such a dsRNA unwinding role during enteroviral RNA replication, which is consistent with our observations that 2C ATPase can facilitate RdRP-mediated enteroviral RNA synthesis in vitro by promoting the recycling of vRNA template (Fig 9) , and disrupting 2C ATPase RNA helicase activity in EV71 resulted in an almost complete loss of enteroviral RNA replication and virus production in cells (Fig 10) . Interestingly, although RNA chaperones can also unwind/destabilize RNA duplexes, RNA chaperones are normally not considered to be involved in unwinding viral replicative dsRNA, as they usually destabilize short base pairs or hairpins within structured RNA elements. Indeed, Banerjee et al. reported that poliovirus 2C ATPase can bind the 3 0 -end cloverleaf structure of (-)-vRNA [15] , implying a role of 2C ATPase in this structured element. In addition, our finding that disrupting 2C ATPase helicase activity but not chaperone activity mostly abolished enteroviral RNA replication and viability strongly suggests that the functions associated with RNA helicase and chaperone play different roles in the same RNA molecule (vRNA) and cannot replace each other.",

Previous studies by DeStefano and colleagues showed that poliovirus 3AB is an RNA chaperone [42, 57] ; moreover, our previous report confirmed that EV71 3AB also contains in vitro RNA chaperone activity [58] . In addition, poliovirus 3D pol has been reported to display unwindase activity that does not require ATP hydrolysis but does require an RNA chain elongation reaction [59] . It is plausible that 2C ATPase and 3D pol work synergistically to unwind nascently synthesized vRNA strands from template. On the other hand, the chaperone activities of 2C ATPase and 3AB may function collaboratively or separately on different structured cis-acting elements of enteroviral RNA. However, owing to technical limitations, it is almost infeasible to determine the exact role of RNA helicase or chaperoning activity in the structures and functionalities of RNA molecules in cells or in vivo. Future studies may overcome these technical barriers and provide a mechanistic view of how RNA remodeling proteins function in cells.",

            "text": "RNA helicases and ATP-independent RNA chaperones are recognized as the two distinct classes of RNA remodelers. RNA helicases participate in most ATP-dependent rearrangement of structured RNAs and RNA-protein complexes [60, 61] . On the other hand, RNA chaperones are able to unwind RNA duplexes and facilitate RNA strand annealing, thereby aiding the folding or refolding of RNA molecules into correct structures. The major difference between RNA helicase and chaperone is that the former needs the participation of ATP, but the later does not. Different from previously characterized RNA remodeling proteins, enteroviral 2C ATPase can function as both a typical RNA helicase and an ATP-independent RNA chaperone. That a single protein can contain these two different types of RNA remodeling activities is intriguing. Our structural analyses of protein 2C ATPase may provide some hints. Protein 2C ATPase contains a 137-a.a. middle domain that includes the conserved SF3 signature A, B, and C motifs and is structurally similar to the helicase core domains of other SF3 viral helicases, indicating that the middle domain provides the basis of its RNA helicase activity. On the other hand, although RNA chaperones have been studied for decades, the mechanism(s) governing their ATPindependent remodeling activity remains elusive. A popular model proposed to explain the mechanism is the \"entropy or disorder transfer\", in which certain intrinsic disordered or unstructured regions of RNA chaperones can transfer their disorder or entropy to RNA molecules, and such a transfer of disorder or entropy can destabilize misfolded RNAs and aids RNA refolding. Indeed, many RNA chaperones, such as HIV-1 Vif, Tat and nucleocapsid, flavivirus core protein, hantavirus N protein, and cypovirus VP5, have been predicted to contain multiple intrinsic disordered regions [40, 48] , providing support for this model. Structure modeling using ROBETTA indicated that the CTD of 2C ATPase contains a highly unstructured or disordered coiled-coil region that links the helicase core domain and the CTD (Fig 1C) . When the CTD was deleted from the protein, the truncation completely abolished the RNA chaperoning activity of 2C ATPase (Fig 8C) . The truncation of CTD reduced but did not abolish the RNA helicase activity (Fig 8D) , suggesting that the presence of CTD is also important for the helicase activity, probably by affecting the protein's global conformation. Moreover, the CTD alone does not contain any RNA remodeling activity (Fig 8A) , suggesting that the RNA chaperoning function of 2C ATPase requires the RNA binding capacities of other 2C ATPase domains. The coiled-coil regions and the middle core domains are highly conserved in enteroviruses and other picornaviruses, such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and foot-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) (S8 Fig). On the basis of all these findings, we propose that the RNA helicase function of enteroviral 2C ATPase relies on the conserved helicase motifs and ATPase activity, while specific structural characteristics, like the architecture of RNA binding and intrinsic disorder regions, are the basis of its RNA chaperoning function. Moreover, these findings provide evidence of the correlation between intrinsic disorder and RNA chaperone activity, which supports the \"entropy transfer\" model of RNA chaperones.",
