A copy of the transcription regulatory sequence for ORF6 (TRS6) was inserted between the N protein and 3\u2032-UTR to drive the transcription of the EGFP gene and yield a general purpose expression vector. Successful recovery of PRRSV was obtained using an RNA polymerase II promoter to drive transcription of the full-length virus genome, which was assembled in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). The recombinant virus showed growth replication characteristics similar to those of the wild-type virus in the infected cells. In addition, the recombinant virus stably expressed EGFP for at least 10 passages. EGFP expression was detected at approximately 10 h post infection by live-cell imaging to follow the virus spread in real time and the infection of neighbouring cells occurred predominantly through cell-to-cell-contact. Finally, the recombinant virus generated was found to be an excellent tool for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compound screening. The newly established reverse genetics system for PRRSV could be a useful tool not only to monitor virus spread and screen for neutralising antibodies and antiviral compounds, but also for fundamental research on the biology of the virus.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), characterized by respiratory diseases in nursery pigs and reproductive failure in sows [1, 2] , has become one of the most economically important infectious diseases in the global swine industry [3] . PRRS virus (PRRSV), the causative agent of PRRS, is a member of a group of enveloped RNA viruses from the genus Arterivius of the family Arteriviridae within the order Nidovirales. PRRSV genome is a linear, non-segmented, single stranded, positive-sense RNA with 15 kb in size [4] , capped at the 5\u2032 end and polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 terminus. The PRRSV genome consists of at least six genes, encoding the structural proteins GP2 or GP2a, GP3, GP4, GP5, M, and N, which are in the order of 5\u2032-ORF1-GP2-GP3-GP4-GP5-M-N-3\u2032 on the genome [5, 6] . Two distinct genotypes of PRRSV, the European genotype (type 1) and North American genotype (type 2) [2, [7] [8] [9] [10] , share only 60% nucleotide identity and are represented by the North American prototype VR-2332 and the European prototype Lelystad virus (LV) [11] . In 2006, the highly pathogenic PRRS (HP-PRRS), characterized by high fever, high morbidity and mortality in pigs of all ages, occurred in China and resulted in the culling of an estimated 20 million pigs in 2006-2007 [12] . The causative agent of HP-PRRS is HP-PRRSV and was more virulent than the classical PRRSV [13] . Genomic analysis showed that nearly all of emerging HP-PRRSV isolates share a unique discontinuous deletion of 30 amino acids (aa) in nonstructural protein 2 (Nsp2). However, a number of newly isolated PRRSV variants with different deletions or recombinants was reported in China and the HP-PRRSV variant continues prevailing and accelerating evolution in China [14] [15] [16] .",

In PRRSV, rescue systems to recover infectious viruses from full length complementary DNA (cDNA) clones have been established for type 1 and type 2 PRRSV to understand the viral life cycle, determine the function of viral protein, and study mutant virus pathogenesis [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its variant enhanced GFP (EGFP) inserted into a number of viral genomes have become the widely used reporter genes to study viral entry mechanisms, observe the transport of viral nucleic acids in and out of the nucleus region, track the assembly and transport of newly synthesized viral components, and visualize the cell-tocell spread of newly synthesized viral particles [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] .",

The first recombinant HA-tagged PRRSV lost foreign HA epitope fused with the ORF7 from the second passage [43] . The rescued PRRSV with the green fluorescent gene fused with the Nsp2 protein, lost the green fluorescent after 7 serial passages due to the deletion of N-terminal amino acids (1 to 159aa) of GFP [44] or the accumulation of point mutations [45] . In addition, apart from the fusion of the green fluorescent gene with Nsp2, a recombinant PRRSV expressing GFP gene proved the stability of the foreign GFP gene even after 37 serial passages. This was done by using the transcription regulatory sequence of gene 2 (TRS2) to drive transcription of the GFP gene and inserting an extra synthetic TRS6 to drive transcription of the ORF 2a and 2b [22] .",

The samples of culture medium plus cells collected every second passage were assayed for total (cell-associated and released into culture media) virus titre and for EGFP expression quantification detection. The results show that the virus titre ( Figure 3b ) and EGFP expression (Figure 3c ) from different passages was kept almost constant. To determine whether the EGFP gene was stable and no expected mutations or deletions were incorporated into the genome, intracellular RNA was isolated after infection with viruses from passages 5 and 10 (P5 and P10, respectively) and subjected to RT-PCR and direct sequence analysis. The results demonstrate that the intact EGFP gene was detected in both P5 and P10 samples, indicating that at least during propagation in cell culture rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP was stable and that its growth kinetics were similar to those of the parental virus.",

Photomicrographs of 10 different positions were captured every 15 min from 1 h pi for a period of 3 days (Additional file 1). Individual infected cells expressing EGFP were observed at about 10 h pi and EGFP expression in neighbouring cells was detected between 10 and 11 h later with a mean value of 10.5 h, which correlates with the PRRSV replication cycle of approximately 10 h [24] . Moreover, EGFP expression in surrounding cells was observed as late as 24 h pi in some infectious positions and EGFP fluorescence was distributed evenly on the monolayer in the late infection stage. In addition, observation of infected cells shows that EGFP was initially present in cells without CPE. Therefore, detection of fluorescence could be an early indicator of PRRSV infection in the cells. On one hand, single infected cells were observed in early infection, and then the infection spread to cells in close proximity to the initially infected cell (Additional file 1). On the other hand, virus spread could be promoted by viral replication in actively dividing cells (Additional file 1). Overall, these data suggest that PRRSV spread occurred by direct cell to cell contact rather than by release of infectious viral particles to the medium. ",

For the construction of HP-PRRSV as an expression vector, we first selected the sites of insertion. American types of PRRSV have only two non-overlapping regions located between ORF1b and ORF2a, as well as between ORF4 and ORF5 of the genome. Since these intergenic regions are reduced in size (about 11 to 220 nts), the insertion of an extra cassette could alter the expression of the ORF downstream from the insertion site due to the proximity to the TRS of the next gene [48] . Except for the intergenic regions, the extra cassette can also be inserted just before the ORF1, or after the ORF7 regions since there were no overlapping genes. Insertions before ORF1 may block the early translation of pp1a and pp1ab, which are responsible for the subsequent replication and formation of subgenomic mRNA. As a result, the site between N gene and 3\u2032-UTR was chosen for the insertion. Secondly, the TRS6 was chosen because it had the shortest distance (24-bp) between the body TRS and downstream ORF. Taken together, this position was selected for the insertion of a copy of the TRS6 in order to drive transcription of EGFP as a separate transcription unit.",

In a recombinant PRRSV expressing GFP gene fused to the nsp2 gene, the heterologous insertion was lost after 7 serial passages due to a N-terminal deletion of GFP from aa 1 to 159 [44] . Similarly, the foreign EGFP gene was lost after 5 serial passages due to a single aa mutation [45] . However, a recombinant PRRSV expressing GFP gene with an extra TRS-ORF cassette inserted between ORF1ab and ORF2 was stable even after 37 serial passages using TRS2 to drive transcription of the GFP gene and inserting an extra synthetic TRS6 to drive transcription of the ORF 2a and 2b genes [22] . Taken together, these data show that PRRSV can tolerate the addition of a foreign gene at specific positions, although the insertion of extra non-viral genetic material may lead to the reduction of the level of the viral replication or result in variants that no longer encode a functional foreign gene. In an attempt to circumvent these disadvantages and to reduce to a minimum the modification of the PRRSV genome, we cloned the heterologous gene between N gene and 3\u2032 UTR using a BAC approach to recover recombinant HP-PPRSV [46, 47, [49] [50] [51] [52] . The EGFP was introduced into the HP-PRRSV/SD16 genome with limited modification of the genome to create a marked recombinant PPRSV, rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP, which stably expressed EGFP as a separate transcription unit. Importantly, rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP shows similar patterns in growth rate and maximum titre in comparison with the parental virus.",

Insertion of EGFP as a separate transcription unit did not affect replication of the recombinant virus in the infected cells. Furthermore, the fact that EGFP fluorescence in EGFP recombinant viruses was expressed stable and at higher levels in different passages, suggests that the cDNA infectious clone represents a useful tool for construction of potential recombinant vaccine candidates, in which the EGFP ORF can be replaced by sequences encoding immunogenic antigens of other viruses. Overall, the virus recovered from the infectious cDNA clone exhibited the same genotypic and phenotypic properties as the parental virus.",

Early observation of infected cells showed that EGFP was expressed in cells with no apparent CPE. This could be due to high expression levels associated with genes located close to the genome end. In addition, EGFP may passively spread into adjacent cells through cell-to-cellcontact from the earlier infected cells. Therefore, the detection of fluorescence could be more sensitive than PRRSV antigen detection. Finally, PRRSV replication was observed in actively dividing Marc-145 cells, indicating that PRRSV could infect quiescent and dividing cells. These results clearly show that EGFP fluorescence can be an early indicator of the infection in cells and a useful tool to show the processes of the rapid spread of PRRSV from cell to cell. In addition, the rHP-PRRSV/SD16/ TRS6-EGFP was found to be an excellent tool for screening neutralising antibodies.",

The effect of CsA on cell viability was determined at 36 h after treatment with CsA using a CellTiter 96 A Q ueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the effect of CsA treatment on the production of infectious virus progeny, Marc-145 cells were infected with rHP-PRRSV/ SD16/TRS6-EGFP or HP-PRRSV/SD16 at 0.1 MOI and treated with CsA at various concentrations (2-8 \u03bcM) for 24 h.
