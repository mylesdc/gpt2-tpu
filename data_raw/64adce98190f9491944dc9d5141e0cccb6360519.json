            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are key players in the antiviral response. IFN sensing by the cell activates transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) able to induce an antiviral state by affecting viral replication and release. IFN also induces the expression of ISGs that function as negative regulators to limit the strength and duration of IFN response. The ISGs identified so far belong to coding genes. However, only a small proportion of the transcriptome corresponds to coding transcripts and it has been estimated that there could be as many coding as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). To address whether IFN can also regulate the expression of lncRNAs, we analyzed the transcriptome of HuH7 cells treated or not with IFN\u03b12 by expression arrays. Analysis of the arrays showed increased levels of several wellcharacterized coding genes that respond to IFN both at early or late times. Furthermore, we identified several IFN-stimulated or -downregulated lncRNAs (ISRs and IDRs). Further validation showed that ISR2, 8, and 12 expression mimics that of their neighboring genes GBP1, IRF1, and IL6, respectively, all related to the IFN response.These genes are induced in response to different doses of IFN\u03b12 in different cell lines at early (ISR2 or 8) or later (ISR12) time points. IFN\u03b2 also induced the expression of these lncRNAs. ISR2 and 8 were also induced by an influenza virus unable to block the IFN response but not by other wildtype lytic viruses tested. Surprisingly, both ISR2 and 8 were significantly upregulated in cultured cells and livers from patients infected with HCV. Increased levels of ISR2 were also detected in patients chronically infected with HIV. This is relevant as genome-wide guiltby-association studies predict that ISR2, 8, and 12 may function in viral processes, in the IFN pathway and the antiviral response. Therefore, we propose that these lncRNAs could be induced by IFN to function as positive or negative regulators of the antiviral response.",

Among the non-coding transcriptome, there is a group of poorly studied transcripts longer than 200 nt and with low coding potential that have been collectively called long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (1, 3) . It has been estimated that there could be as many lncRNA genes as coding genes, but the number of lncRNAs is still growing and some authors consider that it could increase to up to~200000 (4, 5) . Therefore, there is a great need to identify novel lncRNAs and to understand their function and regulation.",

Compared to mRNAs, most lncRNAs are more cell-type specific, less expressed, and less conserved at the nucleotide sequence level (7) . Many lncR-NAs have been shown to be functional. Some lncRNAs function to regulate the expression of neighboring or antisense genes by transcriptional interference, by recruitment of chromatin modifiers and remodelers, or by regulation of imprinting, editing, splicing or translation, and stability (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and lncRNA-activating RNAs (lncRNA-a) are transcripts that control the expression of neighboring genes in \"cis\" (13) (14) (15) . However, lncRNAs can also function in \"trans,\" away from their site of synthesis. For instance, some pseudogenes regulate the expression of their parental gene, located in a distant genomic location (16) (17) (18) (19) . LncRNAs have especially emerged as regulators of development, pluripotency, and proliferation as some function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors (6, 12, (20) (21) (22) (23) . Therefore, several lncRNAs have been implicated in cancer and in other human diseases (24) (25) (26) .",

Besides, several signaling molecules, including those involved in the immune response, have been shown to induce the expression of specific lncRNAs (28) (29) (30) (31) . Induction of TLR2, TLR3, or TLR4 leads to the activation of lncR-NAs, including lncRNA-COX2, which regulates the expression of several immune genes or NEAT1, which functions to increase the expression of some antiviral genes such as IL8 (32) (33) (34) . Downregulation of IL1\u03b2-eRNA and IL1\u03b2-RBT46 lncRNAs decreases IL1\u03b2 and the accumulation of LPS-induced RNAs (34) . Similarly, downregulation of lnc-IL7R decreases the LPS-induced inflammatory response (35) . Treatment of THP1 macrophages with an innate immunity activator also induces the expression of several lncRNAs. One of them, linc1992 (or THRIL) activates the expression of TNF\u03b1 and other genes involved in the immune response (36) . In turn, TNF\u03b1 also induces many lncRNAs in fibroblasts, including Lethe, a pseudogene that responds to NF\u03baB and inhibits NF\u03baB DNA-binding activity leading to reduced inflammation (37) . Besides, dendritic cells (DCs), CD4+, and CD8+ T-cells express a specific set of lncRNAs that may regulate cell activation and differentiation (6, 38, 39) . NEST lncRNA controls the IFN\u03b3 locus in CD8+ T-cells causing decreased Salmonella enterica pathogenesis (40, 41) . Downregulation of lnc-DC, expressed in conventional DCs, impairs DC differentiation from monocytes, and reduces the capacity of DCs to activate T-cells (42) . LncR-NAs also respond to viral infections. Infection with enterovirus, influenza virus, HIV, hepatitis B, and C (HCV) viruses as well as the SARS coronavirus leads to altered levels of lncRNAs (33, (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (Carnero et al., in prep) . From the collection of infectionaltered lncRNAs, it is difficult to distinguish those that respond to the virus from those that respond to the cellular antiviral pathways activated by the infection. Recently, some lncRNAs regulated by infection have also been found to be regulated by IFN\u03b1 in mice (46) .",

When type I/III IFN is released, it is sensed by the IFN receptors, which induce the JAK/STAT pathway. STAT1 and 2 coupled to IRF9 form a complex that binds IFNstimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoters of IFNstimulated genes (ISGs) and activates their transcription. ISGs induce an antiviral state by several means, including inhibition of viral replication, transcription, and translation. Well-characterized ISGs are Mx1, OAS, GBP1, but also STAT1 and IRF9, which amplify the IFN response. Further, STAT1 induces the expression of proinflammatory genes such as IRF1, a transcription factor that also activates ISGs, and whose induction is dependent on de novo protein synthesis (52, 53) . Besides, IFN also induces the expression of negative regulators that limit the strength and duration of the IFN response (54) (55) (56) . Finally, IFN activates expression of several miRNAs that contribute to the antiviral state or to the control of the IFN response (57) .",

Therefore, we have performed a high-throughput analysis of lncRNAs whose expression is deregulated in response to IFN\u03b1. The conditions we used aimed to identify genes controlled by the IFN pathway directly or by other ISGs. The results show that several lncRNAs are controlled in response to type I IFN in several cell lines tested. The best candidates are lncRNA genes upregulated in response to IFN that are found in the genome adjacent to IFN-related coding genes. They have been called ISR2, 8, and 12. Interestingly, guilt-by-association genome-wide studies predict that the function of these lncRNAs is related to the cellular antiviral response and to viral infections. In fact, ISR2, 8, and their neighboring genes are also increased after infection of cultured cells with HCV. A similar increase is detected in the livers of patients infected with this virus or, in the case of ISR2, in blood cells of patients infected with HIV.",

Some ISGs are transcription factors able to regulate the expression of genes with antiviral potential in a secondary wave of IFN response. Other ISGs are inhibitory factors that function to decrease the response. Therefore, to identify lncRNAs regulated by IFN or by ISGs, one should analyze the transcriptome of cells treated by IFN at different time points. However, to simplify the analysis, we decided to check first whether we could find conditions showing a wide IFN response at a single time point. To this aim, we tested whether high doses of IFN could lead to increased expression of well-known ISGs even at late times post-IFN treatment. HuH7 cells were treated for 6, 24, 48, or 72 h with increasing doses of IFN\u03b12 up to 10,000 units/ml, and the expression levels of GBP1, IRF1, BST2, OAS, IL6, and ISG15 were evaluated by qRT-PCR (Figure 1) . The results show that GBP1 and IRF1 are induced to highest levels at 6 h post-treatment, while BST2 and OAS are induced to similar levels at all times tested. In contrast, IL6 is only significantly induced at 3 days post-treatment (Figure 1 and data not shown). However, compared to untreated cells, a significant upregulation of all the genes, including GBP1 and IRF1, can be detected at 3 days post-treatment with 10,000 units/ml of IFN\u03b12 ( Figure 1B) . In fact, this dose induced the highest levels of these transcripts at most of the time points. Before analyzing the transcriptome of cells treated with 10,000 units/ml of IFN\u03b12 for 3 days, we confirmed that these conditions induced antiviral effects. When HuH7 cells infected with HCV were treated with these conditions, we indeed detected a drastic decrease in viral protein expression by immunofluorescence and a decrease in the levels of HCV viral genomes by qRT-PCR (data not shown).",

Many sequences corresponded to coding genes or seemed to be 3 UTR extensions of coding genes and were discarded for further analysis. The remaining Frontiers in Immunology | Molecular Innate Immunity www.frontiersin.org sequences corresponded to 48 genes, including 29 genes annotated as lncRNAs and 19 located in non-annotated areas of the genome ( Figure 2D , Table S4 in Supplementary Material) . Surprisingly, while 90% of coding genes were upregulated by IFN, only 54% of the lncRNAs were upregulated. Most of the downregulated lncR-NAs corresponded to the non-annotated category. This suggests that there could be a relevant IFN-mediated repression of genes that more strongly affects lncRNAs. We named these genes IDRs, for IFN-downregulated RNAs, and accordingly named the IFNstimulated RNAs ISRs. The fact that almost 40% of the ISRs and IDRs correspond to non-annotated areas of the genome suggests that the percentage of the genome able to react to different stimuli could be even larger than expected.",

TNF\u03b1, similarly to some pathogenassociated molecular patterns, induces NF\u03ba\u03b2 signaling and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. However, the NF\u03ba\u03b2 pathway is a poor inducer of ISGs. A treatment of HuH7 cells with 20 ng/ml of TNF\u03b1 for 6 h, induced the expression of CXCL10, used as a positive control, more than 100-fold.

Interestingly, the ISR8 promoter has sites for STAT1 and 2 as well as IRF1 and 2, suggesting that ISR8 could be a bona fide ISG. Besides the non-coding transcript that we name ISR8, six other transcripts could be expressed from the ISR8 area according to UCSC and Ensembl databases ( Figure  S2A in Supplementary Material). These transcripts have certain coding capacities and could be translated to proteins of up to 126 amino acids named C5ORF56. The syntenic region in the mouse also comprises non-coding transcripts together with transcripts with certain coding potential that lead to peptides no longer than 32 amino acids (data not shown). Only five amino acids in the N-terminal part of the putative protein predicted in mouse are conserved in human. Given the poor conservation and the short size of the predicted peptides all the transcripts from this mouse region could be classified as non-coding (80, 81) . To analyze the expression of ISR8 and all the putative coding transcripts annotated in the human ISR8 area, we used qRT-PCR. The results show that most of the transcripts are poorly detected in HuH7 or HeLa cells treated or not with IFN.

In the cells treated with IFN for 3 days, we found, with a very high statistical significance (B > 7), an upregulation of well-characterized ISGs such as Mx1, STAT1, IRF9, ISG15, BST2 and several members of the GBP, OAS, and IFI families (Figure 2) .

However, even if IDRs showed a generally decreased expression in the presence of IFN (Figure 3B) , the downregulation was mild. Validation of downregulated genes showed that only IDR16 was strongly affected by IFN at late times post-treatment (Table S5 in Supplementary Material). Further experiments will be required to determine whether there is a relevant downregulation of lncRNA genes in response to IFN. Notably, the majority of the IDRs match with genomic regions that have not been associated with active transcription in public databases. This is surprising, as some of them such as IDR4, 7, 15, or 16 are expressed at high levels in HuH7 cells according to",

ISR2 is in tandem and downstream of GBP6. It is very unlikely that ISR2 results from run-off transcription from GBP6, as GBP6 expression could not be detected in HuH7 cells (data not shown). ISR12 is in tandem and upstream of IL6 while ISR8 is convergent with IRF1. None of the transcripts annotated for ISR2 or ISR12 overlaps with the transcripts annotated for GBP6 or IL6, respectively ( Figure  S3 in Supplementary Material). However, the region of ISR8 and IRF1 is more complex. While ISR8 does not overlap with its coding neighbor IRF1, the IRF1 gene also transcribes a longer transcript of poor coding capacity called lncIRF1 ( Figure 4B , Figure S2A in Supplementary Material). LncIRF1 expression is induced by IFN\u03b1 to similar levels than ISR8 ( Figure S2C in Supplementary Material). As ISR8 is antisense to lncIRF1, they could potentially regulate each other by transcriptional interference or by antisense mechanisms, although only 17 nt of the mature form of ISR8 are antisense to the mature form of lncIRF1 ( Figure 4B and Figure  S2A in Supplementary Material).",

The ISR8 and ISR12 promoters have NF\u03baB binding sites, although only ISR12 is reproducibly induced in response to TNF\u03b1 under the conditions tested. Furthermore, ISR8 seems a bona fide ISG as the promoter has sites for STAT1 and 2 as well as IRF1 and 2. In spite of this, the possibility exists that IFN activation of a coding ISG could result in an unintended recruitment of transcription factors to the promoter of lncRNAs located nearby. We do not think that this is a general phenomenon, as in the microarray or RNASeq analysis, we do not observe that many lncRNAs located close to ISGs are induced after IFN treatment. Besides, if such unintended transcription occurs, we would expect that the expression of ISR2, 8, and 12 should always correlate with the expression of their neighboring coding genes.

            "text": "Further experiments will be required to determine whether these ISRs have a proviral or an antiviral role by affecting the function of ISGs. The only preliminary evidence of an anti-IFN role is the highly significant anti-correlation between ISR2/ISR12 and key factors of the IFN pathway found by genome-wide guiltby-association studies. Similarly, inhibition of a lncRNA located close to viperin, an ISG that also inhibits HCV replication, has been shown to increase the levels of many IFN-inducible genes (82, 89) . Therefore, several lncRNAs could act as negative regulators of the IFN pathway. The guilt-by-association study also shows a positive correlation of ISR8/IRF1 and the IFN response, suggesting that ISR8 could have a positive role in the IFN pathway. One possible approach to further dissect the function of these ISRs in the future will be their inhibition via RNAi. However, resistance to RNAi is a common feature of many lncRNAs that locate in the nucleus away from the RNAi machinery or contain poorly accessible structured sequences. An alternative could be the use of gene editing technologies, provided that the function of the targeted lncRNAs is not essential for the cell, which would prevent their complete deletion. Moreover, it may also be feasible to overexpress selected lncRNAs from plasmids or viral vectors, in order to study gain-offunction phenotypes. In the long run, we are optimistic that these and other approaches will help to further delineate the potential role of lncRNAs in the IFN pathway and in the antiviral response.",
