We started an investigation to identify the etiologic agent, find additional cases, develop and implement control measures. Methods: We defined probable cases as students, teachers and other staffs in the school developed fever (T \u2265 37.5\u00b0C) with cough or sore throat; or a diagnosis of pneumonia during May 1-June 31, 2018. Confirmed cases were probable cases with Mycoplasma pneumoniae detected in oropharyngeal (OP) swabs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We searched case by reviewing school absenteeism records and interviewing students, teachers and staff in this school. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from symptomatic students. Two qPCR) assay, a duplex qPCR assay, and sequencing were performed to determine the pathogen, genotype and macrolide resistance at the gene level, respectively. Results: From May 1st to June 31st, 2018, we identified 55 cases (36 probable and 19 confirmed), of whom 25 (45%) were hospitalized for complications. All cases were students, none of the teachers and other staffs in the school were with similar symptoms. The attack rate (AR) was 3.9% (55/1398) for all students. The cases were mainly male (58%), with an age range of 7-8 years (median: 7 years). 72% (18/25) of inpatients had radiograph findings consistent with pneumonia, and some cases were hospitalized for up to 4 weeks. Pathogen detection results indicated that Mycoplasma pneumonia (M. pneumoniae) P1 type 1 was the causative agent in this outbreak, and the strain harbored one point mutation of A to G at position 2063. Conclusions: The infections by macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae are not always mild and pneumonia was common and M. pneumoniae could causes serious complications which require long-term hospitalization. In the future infectious disease prevention and control practice, M. pneumoniae should be paid more attention. It is necessary to establish and improve the pathogen and drug resistance surveillance system in order to prevent and control such mutated strains of M. pneumoniae from causing future outbreaks or epidemics in China.",

M. pneumoniae infections develop in persons of all ages, especially in children and teenagers [4] . M. pneumoniae infections range clinically from mild, self-limiting respiratory symptoms to radiographically confirmed pneumonia in an estimated 30% of cases [5] . In rare cases, M. pneumoniae can cause extrapulmonary manifestations, including neurologic, dermatologic, hematologic and cardiac syndromes which can result in hospitalization and death [6, 7] . Macrolide antibiotics are commonly used drugs for the treatment of M. pneumoniae infection. With the widespread or inappropriate use of antibiotic, macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMP) has become an emerging threat worldwide [8] [9] [10] . In recent years, MRMP has become very serious in Asia [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

In China, M. pneumoniae infection is not a notifiable disease, most patients infected with MP are seldom symptomatic, patients rarely seek medical attention, and the clinical syndrome overlaps with other pneumonia etiologies, so the M. pneumoniae infection prevalence in the community was widely underestimated. However, several recent outbreaks of M. pneumoniae infections among children and adults have been reported, and macrolide-resistant strains have emerged [18, 19] . On 7 June, 2018, a primary school in Beijing, China notified Shunyi center for disease control and prevention (CDC) of an outbreak of acute respiratory disease characterized by fever and cough among students and resulting in nine hospitalization cases during the preceding 2 weeks.

All cases were promptly treated outpatient or inpatient and discharged from school until afebrile for \u226548 h. Shunyi CDC communicated with parents of students about respiratory infection prevention and control measures, including good hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene, and seeking medical attention when you have a cough and fever. Six dinner tables with cases were closed. Shunyi CDC and the relevant departments informed the dinner table around the school the epidemic situation. In order to characterize the possible continuing circulation of M. pneumoniae and identify the potential need for adjustments to control measures, an active surveillance for pneumonia was established in the primary school.

Wang et al. [18] found that the major risk factor was the distance (less than 3 m) between the school children at an outbreak of M. pneumoniae in a nursery school. In our study, the field epidemiological investigation result showed that the outbreak began in class 8 grade 1 and the sunflower dinner table where the first case studied and rest. Subsequently, cases began to appear in the neighboring class. This result was different from previous research result of outbreaks in two primary schools [19] . This result indicates that good environmental and hygienic conditions are important for the prevention and control of respiratory infections disease outbreaks. This M. pneumoniae outbreak was identified after a significant number of acute respiratory disease cases were reported among students at Shunyi CDC. The multiplex qPCR assay for respiratory viruses and bacteria was used as the primary testing method in this investigation. The multiplex qPCR assay was useful for outbreaks in which the etiology is initially unknown, like this one, because it enables simultaneous testing for multiple pathogens within a specimen. After the outbreak's etiology was confirmed, active surveillance for probable cases and specimen collection for diagnostic testing began and clinicians frequently prescribed antibiotics on the basis of reports of a fever or cough rather than on patient evaluation or diagnostic test results. In our study, the positive rate of M. pneumoniae in pneumonia cases was significantly higher than that of students with URI and carriers and all 19 strains were classified as P1 type 1. A reduction in the time between outbreak recognition and initiation of active surveillance with prioritized specimen collection will lead to appropriate patient treatment and implementation of timely and strict infection control measures to prevent morbidity and mortality.",
