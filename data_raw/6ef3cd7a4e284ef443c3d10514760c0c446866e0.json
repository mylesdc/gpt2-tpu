The assay specifically detected ZIKV strains of both Asian and African genotypes without crossreactivity with other arboviruses, including Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. The assay detected viral RNA at 14.5 TCID 50 /mL in virus-spiked serum or urine samples within 15 min, although it was slightly less sensitive than reference real time RT-PCR assay. We then evaluated the utility of this assay as a molecular diagnostic test using 90 plasma or serum samples and 99 urine samples collected from 120 suspected cases of arbovirus infection in the states of Para\u00edba and Pernambuco, Brazil in 2016. The results of this assay were consistent with those of the reference RT-PCR test. This portable RT-LAMP assay was highly specific for ZIKV, and enable rapid diagnosis of the virus infection. Our results provide new insights into ZIKV molecular diagnostics and may improve preparedness for future outbreaks.",

In May 2015, the first case of infection with ZIKV on the South American continent was reported in Brazil 2,3 . By early 2016, the number of ZIKV infections in Brazil increased dramatically, and an unusual number of cases of foetal and newborn microcephaly associated with ZIKV infection in pregnant women were reported 4,5 . To control ZIKV disease outbreaks and the spread of ZIKV infections, the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. ZIKV infections have also been reported in other American countries and continue to expand.",

In addition, sexual transmission and the probable transmission through blood transfusions have been reported [8] [9] [10] . ZIKV infection usually causes a mild and self-limiting illness, e.g., fever, rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis. Since these clinical symptoms are commonly observed in infections with other arboviruses, such as Dengue (DENV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses, it is difficult to diagnose ZIKV infection by clinical symptoms alone 1,2 . Therefore, accurate laboratory diagnosis to identify ZIKV infections is urgently required, especially for pregnant women who are at risk of bearing children with microcephaly.

ZIKV has been isolated from humans in East and West Africa and in Southeast Asia and Polynesian countries where the host mosquitoes, A. aegypti and A. albopictus, are found 1, 11 . Based on phylogenetic analyses, these isolates can be categorised into two genotypes, African and Asian. Epidemiological studies have revealed that the recent outbreak of ZIKV in Brazil occurred via the introduction of a virus from French Polynesia, where an outbreak of the disease occurred in 2013 12 . All of the viruses isolated in Brazil and other countries on the American continent belong to the Asian genotype 13 .",

The NAATs such as RT-PCR and other technologies (e.g. recombinase polymerase amplification) are highly accurate, and RT-PCR is considered the gold standard to confirm ZIKV infection 21, 24 . RT-PCR, however, requires a step for viral RNA extraction prior to the assay and the use of expensive equipment, such as thermal cycler, to conduct the test. Moreover, there is a risk of reduced sample quality due to RNA degradation during transportation to the laboratory. For ELISA, serological cross-reaction between ZIKV and other circulating flaviviruses like DENV makes accurate diagnosis with serology difficult 21, 26 . Therefore, novel diagnostic technologies that can be conducted at the point-of-care or in regional laboratories are greatly needed to control ZIKV infections.",

Each genotype-specific primer recognised the same genomic position. To detect all known ZIKV strains, we used a mixture of primers specific for each genotype in a single reaction. First, we examined the sensitivity of the assay using serial 10-fold dilutions of in vitro synthesised standard RNAs from strain 976Uganda, which was isolated from a rhesus macaque in Uganda, and strain PRVABC59, which was isolated at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from a patient who travelled to Puerto Rico in 2015 32 . Ten copies of the RNA standards were detected from both strains in quadruplicate reactions (Fig. 1a) . The times to obtain positive results (Tp) for RNA standards ranging from 10 6 to 10 1 copies were mostly less than 15 min, and within this range, Tp was correlated with the number of RNA copies ( Fig. 1b and c) . Single copies of the standard RNAs from the 976Uganda and PRVABC59 strains were detected with 75% and 50% positivity, respectively, and Tp values were dispersed. These results suggested that the RT-LAMP assay could be used as a rapid, sensitive diagnostic test for ZIKV, the Tp value (i.e., less than 15 min) can be used as an indicator of the number of RNA copies in each reaction.",

Twenty-seven sequences of African genotype isolates collected in 1947-2001 and 149 sequences of Asian genotype isolates collected in Southeast Asia and Polynesia in 1966-2014 as well as from the current outbreak in the Americas were used for this analysis. The LAMP primers consist of 159 nucleotides in total length and recognise eight separate sites on ZIKV genome (Fig. 2a) . We determined the proportion of sequences that had identical nucleotides at each position for either the Asian or African genotype primers (Fig. 2b) . African genotype ZIKV sequences had identical residues at 129 out of 159 positions (81.1%) in the African or Asian genotype-specific primers. At 14 positions in the primer recognition sites, more than 10% of African genotype ZIKV sequences had mismatched nucleotides. At six positions, scattered in the F3, F2, LF, and B2 sites in the Asian and African genotype primers, more than 40% of the African genotype ZIKV sequences had nucleotide differences (Fig. 2b, upper panel) . Asian genotype sequences showed greater identity than African genotype sequences to the LAMP primers. Asian genotype sequences had identical residues at 131 out of 159 positions (82.4%) in the Asian or African genotype primers. For one residue at the 3\u2032 terminus of the F1 site of the FIP primers, 16.8% of the Asian genotype sequences had nucleotide differences (Fig. 2b, lower panel) . To assess the primer specificity for ZIKV strains, we synthesised RNAs with the partial genome sequences of two African genotype ZIKV strains, 41525-DAK and ArD157995, and two Asian genotype ZIKV strains, P6-740 and CPC-0740, which had more mismatched nucleotides against the primer sequences compared with the average for all strains. These RNA sequences were also detected using the RT-LAMP assay, in addition to the sequences in the 976Uganda and PRVABC59 strains (Table 2) . Furthermore, no cross-reactions with other tested arboviruses, including DENV, YFV, West Nile virus (WNV), CHIKV, and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), and Plasmodium falciparum were observed. These results suggested that the RT-LAMP assay developed here was highly specific for detecting ZIKV strains of both African and Asian genotypes.",

These viral titres were higher than those reported in previous studies. To examine whether the assay can detect viral RNA in samples with lower titres, we randomly selected two ZIKV-positive samples confirmed in this study, MRL51 and MRL53, and conducted a dilution test (Table 6 ). While the RT-LAMP failed to detect samples with the Ct value > 37, however, it detected viral RNA at the Ct < 37, consistent with our earlier results obtained using the virus-spiked serum and urine samples (Table 3 ). These results show that the rRT-LAMP assay had sufficient specificity for the detection of ZIKV as a molecular diagnostic test.

ZIKV-infected clinical samples often show high Ct values (>35) 19, 23 . However, the ZIKV-positive samples detected in this evaluation showed Ct values of less than 22.9 (more than 1.6 \u00d7 10 6 geq/mL), which was a higher titre than that reported in other studies. To confirm its clinical utility, this assay should be tested using samples with lower titres or borderline ZIKV infections. It has been reported that viral RNA can be detected for longer periods in urine than in blood 19, 23 . Therefore, we considered urine to be one of the best sample types for detecting ZIKV infections. Recently, Paz-Bailey et al. reported contradictory results for the persistence of viral RNA in blood samples of ZIKV patients; RNA can be detected 1 or 2 weeks after the onset of illness 17 . In some cases, viral RNA can also be detected at higher titres in saliva than in blood, but persists for shorter periods 15, 17 . It is necessary to determine the sample types suitable for the RT-LAMP assay and to establish a standardised RNA extraction protocol adjusted to each clinical specimen type in order to improve the sensitivity of this assay.",

African genotype strains supposedly have a longer history of circulation in African mosquitos and humans than that of Asian genotype strains 11 , and African genotype sequences showed a lower identity at some positions in the LAMP primers. The LAMP primers designed here showed high identities at most positions against the sequences of strains involved in the recent outbreak on the American continent, as well as its ancestral Southeast Asian and Polynesian isolates. During the outbreak of ZIKV in Americas, confirmed or probable ZIKV-infected cases has been continuously reported in Southeast Asia 39 . Our assay will be useful for virus detection and may contribute to preparedness for future outbreaks in these ZIKV endemic countries as well as in Asia and Africa.

The assay may be sufficiently sensitive for detecting ZIKV in clinical specimens.Clinical evaluation of the RT-LAMP assay. We conducted a clinical evaluation of this assay using samples from patients with suspected arbovirus infection in the states of Para\u00edba and Pernambuco, Brazil in February-July 2016. The samples included 90 plasma/serum and 99 urine samples from 120 suspected arbovirus infection cases, including paired samples from 69 cases. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of this assay, we simultaneously conducted the CDC rRT-PCR assay as a reference test. In the RT-LAMP assay, eight out of sixteen serum samples collected in Pernambuco state in February 2016 were positive. However, all 74 plasma samples as well as urine samples collected in Para\u00edba state in March and July 2016 were negative. These results were concordant with those of the reference rRT-PCR assay (",
