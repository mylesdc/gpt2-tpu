Ideally, new sampling strategies should be simple to implement, technologically uncomplicated, and applicable to areas where emergence events are known to occur. To this end, xenosurveillance is a technique that makes use of blood collected by hematophagous arthropods to monitor and identify vertebrate pathogens. Mosquitoes are largely ubiquitous animals that often exist in sizable populations. As well, many domestic or peridomestic species of mosquitoes will preferentially take blood-meals from humans, making them a unique and largely untapped reservoir to collect human blood.

Specifically, blood was collected from humans via finger-stick and by aspirating bloodfed mosquitoes from the inside of houses. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of RNA and DNA derived from these specimens was performed to detect pathogen sequences. Samples obtained from xenosurveillance and from finger-stick blood collection produced a similar number and quality of reads aligning to two human viruses, GB ",

The burden of infectious disease, from persistent infections [2] to intermittent outbreaks [3] , is especially high in developing countries of the tropics [4] . The amount of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost (YLL) due to infectious diseases has decreased globally in the last decade, however in areas of the tropics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), infectious diseases still account for the majority of DALYs and YLL [5] . Despite this, the burden of infectious disease in SSA is likely underestimated due to misdiagnoses stemming from inadequate healthcare infrastructure with limited availability of diagnostic tests, procedures, and surveillance [6, 7] . These factors contribute to an environment conducive for EIDs to go unrecognized until they have caused substantial morbidity and mortality in a human population. This is highlighted by the recent outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa [8, 9] , and demonstrates the need for an improved diagnostic and surveillance framework in SSA. Almost two-thirds of all infectious diseases of humans are of zoonotic origin [10] . Of these, 60% are EIDs [10, 11] . Pathogen emergence has been described as a step-wise process consisting of three parts; pre-emergence, localized emergence, and pandemic emergence [12] . Preemergence describes pathogen transmission in natural reservoir populations where some disturbance results in pathogen expansion within natural populations, an increase in pathogen host range (non-human), and/or pathogen spread to a new geographical area. Localized emergence is characterized as pathogen spillover into human populations with restricted animalhuman and/or human-human transmission. Finally, pandemic emergence refers to global spread of the pathogen through human-human transmission, or sustained transmission through the appropriate vector [12] .",

Active sampling of wildlife and domestic animals has identified pathogens that may be capable of causing pandemics (i.e. pre-emergence) [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, substantial physiological, ecological, and evolutionary barriers exist to pathogen host switching, and the majority of animal pathogens cannot become zoonotic [12, [25] [26] [27] [28] . In order to recognize pathogens prior to pandemic emergence, it would be helpful to sample pathogens that are circulating in human populations at the stage of localized emergence. Active sampling of human blood and/or tissue is the ideal strategy to detect localized emergence, however, human sample acquisition can be invasive, costly, logistically challenging, and requires institutional review board (IRB) approval. Consequently, developing non-invasive and cost effective strategies to collect human samples for pathogen screening are necessary.",

A local public health worker explained the details of the study and acquired signatures or thumb prints from individuals providing consent. The IRB protocol allowed for thumb prints to be used as informed consent for illiterate individuals. Informed consent was first obtained from the heads-of-households, followed by individual members of the household. Parents and guardians provided consent on behalf of children within the household. Body temperature was collected from each consenting individual within the household at the beginning of the study. All febrile patients (based on a body temperature ! 38\u02daC) were offered a SD Bioline Malaria Antigen rapid diagnostic test (Standard Diagnostics, Republic of Korea) to determine the presence of malaria parasites [31] . Patients with a positive test were offered treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy by a nurse and public health worker per WHO Standards [32] . No adverse events were reported. (Fig 1) . Individual households within two villages were enrolled. In an attempt to make our sample size as large as possible, each house in each village was visited, although not every house chose to participate. Upon enrollment, all members of the household provided blood via finger-stick performed by a local nurse recruited into the study. The finger surface was swabbed with an ethanol wipe prior to blood collection. Finger prick blood (hereafter referred to as human dried bloodspots (H-DBS)) was pipetted onto CloneSaver FTA cards (GE Healthcare, USA), and immediately soaked in 25\u03bcL of RNAlater (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) in order to facilitate diffusion of blood into the FTA card, as well as stabilize the nucleic acid.

Both individuals were positive for P. falciparum infection based on the results of a SD Bioline Malaria Antigen rapid diagnostic test and were provided artemisinin-based combination therapy. Anopheles gambiae sensu lato was the most commonly collected species of mosquito from within households in both villages, making up over 80% of mosquitoes collected during the study (Table 1) . Few other taxa of mosquitoes were collected from inside households. Of the other taxa, Aedes and Culex mosquitoes were the most common genera, with 9 and 3 females, respectively. The vast majority of An. gambiae mosquitoes collected contained a full blood meal, indicating they fed the previous night. Village A was slightly more populous than Village B, resulting in a higher number of people enrolled into the study. As well, a greater number of blood fed An. gambiae mosquitoes were collected from households in Village A (Table 1) . Following successive collection of mosquitoes from Village B, substantially more H-DBS were collected than were M-DBS. Previous experience aspirating mosquitoes from inside houses in West Africa implied this was an unexpectedly low number. Consequently, H/M-DBS from Village A were used for the remainder of our study.",

Prior to quality control and host filtering, each DBS produced over 1.8 million reads on average (S2 Table) . Following quality control and host filtering, an average of~50,000 reads remained per H-DBS and~11,000 per M-DBS. The greatest reduction in reads was seen after the dataset was collapsed to unique reads, removing PCR duplicates (S2 Table) . The remaining samples were subjected to DNA sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. In total, 98 H-DBS were pooled separately from the remaining 127 M-DBS. The H-DBS pool produced over 700,000 reads while the M-DBS pool produced almost 900,000 (S2 Table) . The greatest reduction in reads from DNA sequencing samples was observed following the filtering out of the human and mosquito genomic reads (S2 Table) .

While specialized equipment is necessary (e.g. Insectazookas) and training is required for xenosurveillance, needles, sharps containers, antiseptics, and bandages are not needed, the occupants can continue with their regular activities, and residents do not need to be present when sampling occurs. The non-invasive nature of this technique also facilitates more frequent sampling, resulting in more blood samples collected, thus increasing the possibility of sampling pathogens that occur transiently in the blood. Additionally, no specific training is required to collect and process the mosquitoes and IRB approval is not required, as human blood is not being sampled directly. Furthermore, storing blood spots on FTA cards with RNA Later allows for bypassing cold chain, ensures deactivation of potential pathogens in samples [50] , and results in nucleic acid that is a high enough quality to sequence.",

A large number of reads were produced in both our RNA and DNA NGS datasets, however, we observed a considerable reduction in reads following quality control and host filtering. Greater than 99% of reads were removed in all sequencing libraries. This is likely due to multiple factors. The RNA NGS pools saw a greater than 90% reduction in reads following removal of PCR duplicates. Because a very low quantity of RNA is recovered from individual DBS, a substantial amount of amplification is required to bring libraries to a usable quantity of nucleic acid. For RNA NGS, increasing the number of DBS per pool would reduce duplicate reads. For DNA NGS, less amplification was required as more DNA is eluted off of individual DBS. This indicated that Field validation of xenosurveillance DNA from mosquito blood-meals was more stable on FTA cards compared to RNA, which allowed us to pool more individual DBS per pool. Predictably, more unique reads were produced from DNA sequencing libraries than RNA sequencing libraries. Substantial losses of reads were observed following filtering of host nucleic acid, indicating most of the sequenced nucleic acid was derived from either humans or mosquitoes, as expected (Fig 2) . These reads are not informative for pathogen identification, however they indicate mosquito blood meals were likely taken from humans. Although our in-house depletion strategy worked at clearing our M-DBS RNA sequencing samples of mosquito rRNA, the remainder of the samples would benefit from improved host depletion or pathogen nucleic acid enrichment strategies.

            "text": "Following quality control and host filtering, an adequate number of reads remained to detect genetic signatures of viruses and parasites. Following further analysis, reads aligning to parasitic worms proved to be largely spurious based on additional bioinformatics scrutiny. This is likely the result of bacterial sequences from our samples aligning to misassemblies in the published genomes. The incorporation of contaminating bacterial sequences into whole genome assemblies is not uncommon [51 -53] . As well, Liberia is endemic for lymphatic filariasis and An. gambiae is a primary vector of W. bancrofti in West Africa, therefore any reads aligning to this parasite in xenosurveillance samples must be from an infected host or and infected vector [54] . Similarly, multiple reads aligning to P. falciparum were identified in all sequencing pools, which is expected, however we cannot say with confidence from xenosurveillance samples whether the reads are host or vector derived. Reads aligning to P. falciparum do highlight the fact that while xenosurveillance is intended to identify any human pathogens present in peripheral blood, not just those transmitted by mosquitoes, these samples can also contribute to routine vector surveillance efforts (e.g. identifying the malaria parasite in local Anopheles mosquitoes). While we did not quantify the prevalence of P. falciparum from individual DBS in this study, the sample collection and storage method would allow for such testing. Furthermore, xenosurveillance can be conducted using other hematophagous arthropods, although a clear understanding of the natural history of the chosen organism and their ability to vector pathogens is crucial when conducting downstream analysis. Reads from two viruses, GBV-C and HBV, were identified using bioinformatics and molecular methods (Fig 3) . Interestingly, although GBV-C, an RNA virus closely related to hepatitis C virus, is not known to be pathogenic, infection with this virus is associated with an increased rate of survival in patients co-infected with either HIV or Ebola virus [41, 55] . As this virus infects and replicates in CD4-positive T cells, we would expect to be able to detect GBV-C RNA in blood [56] . GBV-C has an estimated prevalence between 10-28% in West African countries, which is similar to our findings, albeit derived from a small sample size (Table 3) [41]. Both H and M-DBS, collected from the same household, produced a similar number of reads that aligned with high confidence to GBV-C (Fig 3A) from pooled samples. HBV reads were identified in DNA NGS pools [57] . Chronic HBV infection is the leading cause of chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is responsible for up for up to 30% of liver cirrhosis cases globally [58, 59] . Prevalence is highly variable across Africa, but is estimated to be between 4-8% in Liberia as determined by HBV surface antigen, which is congruent with our data (Table 3 ) [60] . Phylogenetic analysis clearly indicates both viruses are of human origin and from West Africa (Figs 4 and 5 ). Fewer reads from H and M-DBS aligned to HBV compared to GBV, however substantially more DBS made up the sequencing pool ( Fig 3B) . As well, the DNA NGS was performed on an Illumina MiSeq, producing substantially fewer overall reads than RNA NGS pools sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq (S2 Table) . Nevertheless, these results indicate that NGS can be a sensitive enough technique to detect a pathogen \"signal\" through host \"noise\" in complex pooled samples of blood collected by either method. GBV-C and HBV nucleic acid was amplified using qRT-PCR and qPCR, respectively, from individual DBS, showing alternative methods can be used to detect the presence of pathogens in lieu of NGS. Due to similarity in read quality and composition collected from by each method, our data suggest xenosurveillance is a viable alternative for collecting human blood samples used in pathogen surveillance.",

            "text": "Xenosurveillance can be a useful strategy to supplement existing public health efforts in developing regions of the world. As mosquitoes constantly take blood meals from humans, especially in the tropics, the availability of samples is enormous. Xenosurveillance is less invasive and logistically challenging compared to traditional sampling methods. Sample storage is simple and cost effective. As well, sample quality does not appear to suffer from being collected by a mosquito, as there are no substantial differences between samples collected via xenosurveillance or finger-stick. However it remains to be determined if samples collected by xenosurveillance are useful for other means of disease surveillance (e.g. serology). Xenosurveillance is capable of detecting a wide array of pathogens [30] , although this study did not reliably detect parasites and bacteria infecting humans. However, zoonotic, viral pathogens are disproportionately likely to reach pandemic emergence, as compared to parasites or bacteria [14] . Recent pandemics of zoonotic viruses, including Ebola virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and Zika virus support this notion [61] [62] [63] . In theory, routine xenosurveillance could provide early warnings by detecting emerging pathogens circulating at low levels in vulnerable populations. As well, xenosurveillance can be targeted to support epidemiological services by collecting engorged mosquitoes in areas where suspected pathogen transmission is occurring [64] . Species specific PCR can be used to identify known or suspected pathogens from xenosurveillance samples, although the use of NGS provides an unbiased detection approach. As the cost of high throughput NGS continues to decrease, large scale sequencing projects are becoming more universal [65] . Furthermore, as field applicable sequencing tools are being further developed and optimized, the use of real-time NGS for surveillance and diagnosis of pathogens is being realized [66] [67] [68] [69] . The combination of xenosurveillance and novel sequencing strategies has the potential to bring active, real-time, disease surveillance to resource-poor areas of the world. ",

The two study villages were located in rural Lofa County, Liberia and made up of~30 households each. Both Village A and Village B were visited by the research team consisting of researchers from CSU and LIBR, as well as a nurse and local public health worker. A total of 23 households from Village A and 20 households from Village B were enrolled into the study.
