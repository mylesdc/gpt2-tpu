The development of a detection method for this virus that can lead to rapid and accurate diagnosis would be significant. In this study, we established a nucleic acid visualization technique that combines the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique and a vertical flow visualization strip (RT-LAMP-VF) to detect the N gene of MERS-CoV. The RT-LAMP-VF assay was performed in a constant temperature water bath for 30 min, and the result was visible by the naked eye within 5 min. The RT-LAMP-VF assay was capable of detecting 2 \u00d7 10 1 copies/\u00b5l of synthesized RNA transcript and 1 \u00d7 10 1 copies/\u00b5l of MERS-CoV RNA. The method exhibits no cross-reactivities with multiple CoVs including SARS-related (SARSr)-CoV, HKU4, HKU1, OC43 and 229E, and thus exhibits high specificity. Compared to the real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) method recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), the RT-LAMP-VF assay is easy to handle, does not require expensive equipment and can rapidly complete detection within 35 min.",

CoVs exhibit a high frequency of recombination and high mutation rates, which may allow them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches (Woo et al., 2009) . Currently, six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified, including, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV.

Some evidence demonstrates that dromedary camels are a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV, and virus from infected dromedary camels can be transmitted across species to infect humans (Azhar et al., 2014; Ling et al., 2015) . Additionally, the virus can be transmitted human-to-human by close contact (Nazer, 2017) . As of the 26th of January 2018, 2143 laboratoryconfirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported, and these cases include 750 deaths globally.

After amplification, the amplicons are simultaneously labeled with FITC and biotin. The amplicons that are labeled with biotin can bind to colloidal gold particles conjugated with streptavidin to form a complex. Then the complex, labeled with FITC, is captured by an anti-FITC antibody that is coated on the text line of the strip, and the test results are presented as a colored line that is visible to the naked eye (Figure 1 ).",

Because no licensed effective vaccines or treatment methods exist, timely diagnosis and isolation are the most effective methods to control viral outbreak. LAMP technology is a promising method for nucleic acid detection. Under constant temperature conditions, nucleic acids can be rapidly amplified using specific primers with advantages that include high specificities and short detection times. Currently, LAMP technology has been widely used for the detection of West Nile virus, influenza virus, yellow fever virus, Marburg virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus, and other virulent viruses (Kurosaki et al., 2010; Ge et al., 2013; Kwallah et al., 2013; Cao et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2016; Chotiwan et al., 2017) . In the field of MERS-CoV detection, Bhadra et al. (2015) established a real time quantitative method, i.e., a one-step strand displacement RT-LAMP, which can detect 5-50 PFU/ml of MERS-CoV. Shirato et al. (2014) established a real-time quantitative RT-LAMP assay for the N gene by adding pyrophosphate or nucleic acid dyes to the amplification system. Lee et al. (2016) developed a real time one-pot RT-LAMP method to target the N gene. These methods are relatively feasible, specific and rapid molecular diagnostic technologies.",

In contrast with previous RT-LAMP methods, six primers are used in the reaction mixture which enormously increases the amplification efficiency. Additionally, two loop primers (LF and LB) are labeled with FITC or biotin, creating the visible results on the test strip.",

First, the RT-LAMP-VF assay requires AMV Reverse Transcriptase to reverse transcribe the RNA into cDNA. AMV Reverse Transcriptase exhibits its highest activity at 42-55 \u2022 C, while Bst DNA polymerase operates best at 65 \u2022 C. The higher reaction temperature likely decreased the efficiency of reverse transcription. Therefore, when synthesized RNA transcripts were used as the template, the temperature was lowered to facilitate reverse transcription. Furthermore, the supercoiled structures of the recombinant plasmids were steady, thus making it necessary to maintain the helix state at a high temperature.",

To investigate the efficiency of the RT-LAMP-VF assay after inserting TTTT into the FIP and BIP primers, two sets of inner primers were designed (Supplementary Table 3 ); one set contained the TTTT sequence and one set did not. Under the same amplification conditions, the primer set containing the TTTT sequence produced better results (Supplementary Figure 2) , which is consistent with the conclusion drawn by Lee et al.
