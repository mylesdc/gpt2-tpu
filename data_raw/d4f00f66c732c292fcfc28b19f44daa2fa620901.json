            "text": "This study aimed to identify a broad spectrum of respiratory pathogens from hospitalized and not-preselected children with acute respiratory tract infections in the Farhat Hached University-hospital of Sousse, Tunisia. Between September 2013 and December 2014, samples from 372 children aged between 1 month and 5 years were collected, and tested using multiplex real-time RT-PCR by a commercial assay for 21 respiratory pathogens. In addition, samples were screened for the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae 16S rDNA using real-time PCR. The viral distribution and its association with clinical symptoms were statistically analyzed. Viral pathogens were detected in 342 (91.93%) of the samples of which 28.76% were single positive and 63.17% had multiple infections. The most frequent detected viruses were rhinovirus (55.64%), respiratory syncytial virus A/B (33.06%), adenovirus (25.00%), coronavirus NL63, HKU1, OC43, and 229E (21.50%), and metapneumovirus A/B (16.12%). Children in the youngest age group (1-3 months) exhibited the highest frequencies of infection. Related to their frequency of detection, RSV A/B was the most associated pathogen with patient's demographic situation and clinical manifestations (p<0.05). Parainfluenza virus 1-4 and parechovirus were found to increase the risk of death (p<0.05). Adenovirus was statistically associated to the manifestation of gastroenteritis (p = 0.004). Rhinovirus infection increases the duration of oxygen support (p = 0.042). Coronavirus group was statistically associated with the manifestation of bronchiolitis (p = 0.009) and laryngitis (p = 0.017). Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA was detected in 143 (38.44%) of tested samples. However, only 53 samples had a concentration of C-reactive protein from equal to higher than 20 milligrams per liter, and 6 of them were single positive for Streptocuccus pneumoniae. This study confirms the high incidence of respiratory viruses in children hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infections in the Sousse area, Tunisia. Fig 2. Distribution of viral infection rates in relation to the age of patients. Four age groups are defined: G1 (1-3 m, blue), G2 (4-6 m, orange), G3 (7-12 m, red), and G4 (13-60 m, green). The rates of viral infection are represented in the y-axis, and the x-axis is described by tested viruses. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188325.g002 Acute respiratory tract infections in children from Sousse area, Tunisia PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188325 November 17, 2017 9 / 17 0.042 0.535 0.088 0.102 0.714 0.893 0.296 0.863 0.075 Side symptoms Anemia (Yes, No) 0.222 0.751 0.825 0.578 0.558 0.382 0.293 0.003 0.175 Vomiting (Yes, No) 0.073 0.898 0.049 0.552 0.205 0.710 0.434 0.728 0.552 Gastroenteritis (Yes, No) 0.697 0.613 0.533 1.000 0.004 1.000 0.668 1.000 1.000 Predictive severity factors Respiratory irritation (Yes, No) 0.112 0.539 0.613 0.608 0.539 0.221 0.209 0.290 0.294 Apnea (Yes, No) 0.258 0.375 0.561 0.841 0.435 0.755 0.233 0.781 0.782 Saturation of O 2 <94% (Yes, No) 0.697 0.680 0.843 0.351 0.059 0.545 0.016 0.097 0.929 Dehydration (Yes, No) 0.737 0.377 0.512 0.749 0.494 0.411 0.582 1.000 0.387 Post-hospitalization Nosocomial infection (Yes, No) 0.505 0.411 0.000 0.895 0.113 0.846 0.031 0.564 0.049 Death (Yes, No) 0.403 0.998 0.013 0.559 0.907 0.739 0.542 0.032 0.708 Upper/Lower ARTIs Bronchiolitis (Yes, No) 0.437 0.009 0.118 0.300 0.897 0.598 0.429 0.739 0.124 Pharyngitis (Yes, No) 0.195 0.127 1.000 0.667 0.716 0.003 0.736 0.573 0.610 Laryngitis (Yes, No) 0.142 0.017 0.458 0.328 0.408 1.000 0.293 0.648 1.000 Rhinitis (Yes, No) 0.301 0.141 0.696 0.567 0.915 0.909 0.462 0.109 0.367",

The WHO estimates that ARTIs account for 1.9 to 2.2 million childhood deaths annually, with 42% occurring in Africa [2] . The etiologic agents include viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Among the viruses responsible for ARTIs are members of the Orthomyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Adenoviridae, and Parvoviridae. Bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), and Chlamydia pneumoniae are the most common involved microbes [3] . However, in general, viral infections are shown to be responsible for about 80% of ARTIs and are the cause of 90% of hospitalizations in children below 5 years of age [4] .",

Even so, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly between different causes of childhood respiratory infections [7] . Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests that identify the cause of LRTIs in children can reduce the use of antibiotics, improve the targeted use of drugs and help to control nosocomial transmission [8] . New technologies permit the detection of more than one pathogen in a single probe and are more relevant than non-multiplex approaches such as conventional PCR, viral cell culture and, immunofluorescence or immunochromatography assays. The recently developed commercial diagnostic assays based on multiplex real-time PCR (qPCR/qRT-PCR) allow sensitive and specific detection of a broad panel of conventional and emerging viruses in respiratory tract specimens. Thus, they have been established as a standard method within the past few years. These technological advances have changed the landscape of virus detection and provide the opportunity to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of respiratory viruses [9] .",

Both of these pathogens were also identified by other studies as the major etiologic agents for ARTIs in infants and young children [27, 28] . RSV is well established as a common agent of ARTIs, especially in the manifestation of bronchiolitis. In addition, studies from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia reported RSV infection rates between 18.00% and 29.80% [10] [11] [12] 18] . In contrast to RSV, few studies were published describing RV epidemiology in the Arab Maghreb. Similar to our findings, Jroundi and collaborators detected a high rate of RV infection (53.00%) in Moroccan children hospitalized with ARTIs [11] . In another hand, a recent study describing the circulation of respiratory viruses in Tunisia over 3 consecutive years found that RV infection was predominant in only 1 of the 3 years, while RSV was predominant in the other 2 years. Such findings indicate a possible fluctuation of RV and RSV circulation [20] . The interpretation of the presence and the pathogenic role of RV in LRTIs remain unclear. According to Vandini et al, RV is the second most common cause of viral bronchiolitis and the most common virus associated with wheezing in children aged 1 to 2 years [29] . However, the detection of RV in asymptomatic children, or its long persistence after an acute respiratory infection has been also described [30] .",

RV and RSV A/B were the most common pathogens found in combination with other viruses (RV-AdV in 53/235 total co-infections, then RV-RSV A/B and RV-MPV A/B in 44/235 co-infected samples, each). This finding is supported by Cebey-L\u00f3pez et al, who studied viral co-infections in a pediatric environment in which RSV and RV are the most detected pathogens [36] . Although the size of the samples is limited, the present study allows us to analyze putative associations between multiple infections and clinical manifestations (Table 5 ) as the probability of being infected by the combination of at least 2 respiratory viruses increases when children were breastfed after birth, and the risk for developing respiratory irritation raised with viral multiple infections. The association of multiple infections with increased severity of the course of infection is controversial in the literature. Some reports showed no association between multiple virus infections and disease severity, whereas the findings of others indicated that clinical manifestations and illness severity were more prevalent in multiple infected patients, especially in co-infections with RSV [37] [38] [39] .",

In most of S. pneumoniae positive patients (81/143), CRP concentrations were low (<20 mg/l) indicating that the detected bacterial DNA is not representing the causative agent for the observed ARTIs, but may demonstrate a colonization status. S. pneumoniae-carriage rates in children of 60.00% up to 93.00% in low-and lower-middle-income countries have been reported [43, 44] . In our study 47 cases from a total of 53 S. pneumoniae positive PCR and a concentration of CRP equal or higher than 20 mg/l; viral RNA/DNA was additionally detected, indicating a possible bacterial co-infection. On the other hand, increased colonization rates of S. pneumoniae in children during RSV epidemics have been reported [45] . In only 6/53 children with CRP concentration values equal or higher than 20mg/l and S. pneumoniae detection, no virus was found in our study, leading to the interpretation that these children were hospitalized due to S. pneumoniae-associated ARTIs. Pneumococcal vaccination is available in many countries. However, in Tunisia, there is no national vaccination program against pneumococcal in public hospitals. Vaccination is available only in the private hospitals and thus is not accessible to all population [46] .",

The presentation of clinical symptoms does not often enable clinicians to discriminate between viral or bacterial pathogens. The recommended early and easy use of antibiotics is not effective in viral ARTIs, and can only prevent the occurrence of bacterial super-infection. In this context, viral diagnosis can prevent the use of unnecessary costly antibiotics. For this reason, rapid and reliable diagnostic tools are required for intervention with the appropriate infection treatment measures. This study aimed to profile a large number of viruses and the most common bacteria in the respiratory tract of infected children in Sousse area in Tunisia using the multiplex qRT-PCR for virus's genome detection and the qPCR assays for bacteria identification. The results of the study should provide a better understanding of the viral/bacterial etiology in this region.",

Nucleic acids extraction and multiplex qRT-PCR The QIAsymphony Sp automate (QIAGEN, Cat No./ID: 9001297) and the QIAsymphony DSP virus/Pathogen Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Austria) were used for the total nucleic acids extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extraction procedure was carried out from a 600 \u03bcl original material resulting in a final eluate of 150 \u03bcl. For the detection of respiratory pathogens the FTD Respiratory pathogens 21 Kit (Fast-Track Diagnostics, FTD-2-64) was used which allows the identification of influenza virus A (InfV-A), influenza virus B (InfV-B), influenza virus A (H1N1) swl, rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1 (CoV-NL63,CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-HKU1), parainfluenza virus 1-4 (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3 and PIV-4), metapneumovirus A and B (MPV A/B), bocavirus (BoV), RSV A/B, adenovirus (AdV), enterovirus (EV), parechovirus (PeV) and M. pneumoniae.
