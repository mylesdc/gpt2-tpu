            "text": "An expansion of effector/activated V\u03b42 T-cells was recently described in acute Zika virus (ZIKV)-infected patients, but their role in the protective immune response was not clarified. The aim of this study was to define the antiviral activity of V\u03b42 T-cells against ZIKV-infected cells. The V\u03b42 T-cells expansion and their cytotoxic activity against ZIKV-infected cells were tested in vitro and analyzed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. We found that ZIKV infection was able to induce V\u03b42 T-cells expansion and sensitized A549 cells to V\u03b42-mediated killing. Indeed, expanded V\u03b42 T-cells killed ZIKV-infected cells through degranulation and perforin release. Moreover, ZIKV infection was able to increase the expression on A549 cells of NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs), namely MICA, MICB, and ULBP2, at both the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting the possible involvement of these molecules in the recognition by NKG2D-expressing V\u03b42 T-cells. Indeed, the killing of ZIKV-infected cells by expanded V\u03b42 T-cells was mediated by NKG2D/NKG2DL interaction as NKG2D neutralization abrogated V\u03b42 cytotoxicity. Our data showed a strong antiviral activity of V\u03b42 T-cells against ZIKV-infected cells, suggesting their involvement in the protective immune response. Other studies are necessary to investigate whether the lack of V\u03b42 T-cells expansion in vivo may be associated with disease complications.",

Given the range of clinical symptoms, there is a pressing need to elucidate the protective immunological profile and to identify the immune signature associated with complication. Effective control of ZIKV involves both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Neutralizing antibodies are produced after ZIKV infection, control viral replication [10], and correlate with protection against secondary infection [11] [12] [13] .",

In mice, polyfunctional cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells are activated [14] and reduce ZIKV burden, whereas their depletion resulted in greater ZIKV infection and mortality [15] . Adoptive transfer of ZIKV-specific CD8+ T-cells can protect against ZIKV infection [16] , confirming the role of CD8+ T-cells against ZIKV. Nevertheless, CD8+ T-cells could also have pathological consequences in the brain [17] resulting in ZIKV-associated paralysis [18] . The role of CD4+ T-cells in the protection/pathogenesis of ZIKV infection is not fully elucidated. CD4+ T-cells proliferated and produced Th1 cytokines in mice [19] , and their depletion reduced humoral response [20] . In ZIKV-infected humans, CD4+ T-cells differentiated into effectors cells but showed an impaired IFN-\u03b3 production [21] .",

In order to define the capability of ZIKV-infected cells to expand V\u03b42 T-cells in vitro, we co-cultured mock or ZIKV-infected A549 cells with PBMC of HD for 7 days in the presence of IL-2. As a positive infected with ZIKV MR766 strain and the frequency of ZIKV+ cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using the PANFLAVI antibody after 24, 48, and 72 h. Flow cytometry panels of one representative experiment out of 15 are shown. PANFLAVI+ gate was set to include \u22640.2% of events when using primary or secondary antibody isotype controls or uninfected cells (mock). (b) Expansion index of V\u03b42 T-cells in co-culture with ZIKV-infected cells was shown. A549 cells were not infected (mock) or infected with ZIKV MR766 and cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy donors (HD). IL-2 or IL-2 + PhAg were added in parallel cultures as controls. V\u03b42 T-cells frequency was calculated at baseline (T0) and after 7 days (T7). The expansion index was calculated by dividing V\u03b42 T-cells frequency at 7 days in respect to T0. Results from 13 independent experiments are shown.

As a positive control of V\u03b42 T-cells expansion, PBMC were also stimulated with either PhAg and IL-2 or IL-2 alone. The expansion was evaluated by using a proliferation index defined as the ratio between the frequency of V\u03b42 +CD3 + cells before (T0) and after 7 days (T7) of co-culture (T7/T0). As reported previously, we found that mock-A549 induced V\u03b42 T-cell proliferation ( Figure 1B ) [21] . Interestingly, ZIKV-infected A549 cells significantly increased the expansion of V\u03b42 T-cells above the levels observed with mock A549 cells (p < 0.001) ( Figure 1B) , indicating that ZIKV infection enhanced V\u03b42 T-cells expansion. To analyze the cytotoxic capability of V\u03b42 T-cells against ZIKV infected cells, we generated V\u03b42 T short-term lines from PBMC of HD. After 12 days of culture, we purified expanded \u03b3\u03b4 T-cells by magnetic separation reaching a purity >95%. We therefore co-cultured expanded V\u03b42 T-cells with mock or ZIKV-infected A549 cells for 18 h at two effector/target ratio (1:1 and 5:1) and analyzed their ability to kill ZIKV-infected cells by flow cytometry using AnnexinV/PI staining.

Representative histograms of NKG2D expression are shown in Figure 5A . We found that a large fraction of freshly isolated ex vivo V\u03b42 T-cells express NKG2D [median + IQR: 61.5% (48.9-67.6)] that was significantly increased in expanded V\u03b42 T-cells [97.9% (82.0-98.7)] ( Figure 5B ). To verify whether V\u03b42 T-cells were able to kill ZIKV-infected cells through NKG2D receptor, we pre-treated V\u03b42 T-cells with anti-NKG2D (aNKG2D) neutralizing antibody. Then, we cultured untreated/treated expanded V\u03b42 T-cells with mock or ZIKV-infected A549 cells for 18 h and analyzed the frequency of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry. Representative histograms are shown ( Figure 5C,E) . While untreated-expanded V\u03b42 T-cells were able to kill ZIKV-infected cells, pre-treatment of expanded V\u03b42 T-cells with aNKG2D antibody completely abrogated the cytotoxic effect ( Figure 5D ,F) (p < 0.001), indicating that V\u03b42 T-cells killing of infected cells is mediated by NKG2D activation.",

These data are in accord with results showing an increase of stress ligands on cells infected with another Flavivirus, the West Nile Virus (WNV) [38] but in contrast with Glasner and colleagues showing an inhibition of NK cells response [39] . This discrepancy may be due to different experimental condition (different ZIKV strain, different MOI, different time kinetic analysis). In our settings, we therefore demonstrated the role of NKG2D in ZIKV antiviral activity of V\u03b42 T-cells, as the neutralization of NKG2D abrogated the V\u03b42 T-cells-induced infected cells killing. Moreover, a reduction of NKG2D expression on NK cells in WNV-infected patients that can act as a possible viral escape mechanism to avoid NK-mediated recognition has been reported [38] . In this context, further analysis in ZIKV-infected patients are mandatory in order to verify the effect of ZIKV infection on NKG2D expression on V\u03b42 T-cells in vivo.",
