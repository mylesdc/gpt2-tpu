            "text": "With the rapidly expanding body of medical knowledge, clinicians need access to appropriate, relevant information to guide their clinical decision making. For many conditions, clinical experts have used available evidence and experience to generate guidelines that endeavour to assist clinicians, and improve patient outcomes. A major problem, however, has been finding the best strategies to implement these guidelines in a busy hospital environment. [1] [2] [3] Group lectures, one to one academic detailing, laminated cards and advertising material such as posters have all been tried with variable success. [4] [5] [6] [7] With the increasing role played by computers as a source of information in the hospital setting, computerised decision support may provide a useful alternate strategy. [8] [9] [10] [11] At the Royal Melbourne Hospital, a transferable web based computerised decision support system was developed, with the capacity to present any guideline or algorithm. [12] We chose in the first instance to deploy a guideline for the management of patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) as this is one of the most common conditions presenting to hospital emergency departments. International and national guidelines have been produced to guide the management of CAP [13] [14] [15] , but uptake has been poor. [16] The general aim of this study was to describe the impact of different methods of guideline promotion on clinician prescribing behaviour. More specifically, a comparison of the impact of both academic detailing (AD) and a computerised decision support system (CDSS) on the management of patients with CAP in an emergency department (ED) was examined. The outcomes of interest included the prescription of antibiotics that were concordant with guideline recommendations, the early identification of the severely ill patients and adjustment of antibiotics to meet recommendations for prescribing in the severely ill group, and adjustment of antibiotics to accommodate known patient allergies.",

Use of these scores was not, however mandated. Users could choose to skip the score to obtain antibiotic advice alone. Antibiotic allergy reminders were included. If a user had previously registered an allergy for a patient this was presented, otherwise a reminder was given to check with the patient. Detailed information was included about unusual pathogens to consider, the most appropriate choice of empiric antibiotics, the duration of therapy, and the timing of change from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy. Users had access to medical literature via the Internet, along with local interpretation of this literature within the CDSS. Users could browse the CDSS content without logging a patient in, so it could be used as an educational tool as well as providing patient specific advice. There was general agreement between the empiric antibiotic recommendations made in the national guideline, the AD directives and the content of the CDSS.",
