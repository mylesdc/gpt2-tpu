            "text": "The design of optimized nanoparticles offers a promising strategy to enable DNA vaccines to cross various physiological barriers for eliciting a specific and protective mucosal immunity via intranasal administration. Here, we reported a new designed nanoparticle system through incorporating anionic liposomes (AL) into chitosan/DNA (CS/DNA) complexes. With enhanced cellular uptake, the constructed AL/CS/DNA nanoparticles can deliver the anti-caries DNA vaccine pGJA-P/VAX into nasal mucosa. TEM results showed the AL/CS/DNA had a spherical structure. High DNA loading ability and effective DNA protection against nuclease were proved by gel electrophoresis. The surface charge of the AL/CS/DNA depended strongly on pH environment, enabling the intracellular release of loaded DNA via a pH-mediated manner. In comparison to the traditional CS/DNA system, our new design rendered a higher transfection efficiency and longer residence time of the AL/CS/DNA at nasal mucosal surface. These outstanding features enable the AL/CS/DNA to induce a significantly (p,0.01) higher level of secretory IgA (SIgA) than the CS/DNA in animal study, and a longer-term mucosal immunity. On the other hand, the AL/CS/DNA exhibited minimal cytotoxicity. These results suggest that the developed nanoparticles offer a potential platform for DNA vaccine packaging and delivery for more efficient elicitation of mucosal immunity.",

            "text": "The development of efficient and safe vaccines remains a major goal in globe public health. Recently, considerable attention has been focused on the development of DNA vaccines as an effective immunogenic strategy to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. DNA vaccines are considered to be inexpensive, stable, relatively safe compared to attenuated viral vaccines [1, 2, 3, 4] and flexible to integrate genes encoding antigens and immunostimulatory sequences. Thus, DNA vaccines are in favor of worldwide transportation and vaccination. Though intramuscular (i.m.) vaccination is still widely used, unfortunately, it usually failed in inducing local immunity at mucosal sites where tremendous infectious agents enter the body [5] . Interestingly, nasal mucosa is an attractive site for DNA vaccines to evoke both systemic and mucosal immune response [6, 7, 8, 9] , due to its accessibility, lower enzyme distribution compared to the oral route and dense population of immune cells, often referred to as the nasal associated lymphoid tissue (NALT).",

In previous studies [10] , the DNA vaccine pGJA-P/VAX against dental caries has been successfully constructed by encoding a GLU domain of GTF enzymes along with the A and P regions of surface protein antigen (PAc) of S. mutans. The pGJA-P/VAX can induce specific saliva SIgA response and serum IgG response via i.n. or i.m. immunization in animals, including adult mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys [10, 11, 12] . In addition, the increase of the specific saliva SIgA is found to be correlated with reduction of dental caries [13, 14] . However, without adjuvants or delivery system, the single DNA vaccine (pGJA-P/VAX included) displayed low efficacy via i.n. administration [15, 16] , possibly attributed to poor antigen delivery, as a result of various physiological hurdles, including mucociliary clearance, enzyme degradation and poor internalization by antigen presenting cells (APCs).",

Chitosan (CS) NPs are of special interest in nasal DNA vaccine delivery because of its unique properties, including bioadhesiveness, effectiveness in transport of antigens by transiently opening tight junctions of cells, biocompatibility and low toxicity [17, 18] . More evidences have shown that DNA vaccine complexed with the CS significantly improved mucosal sIgA levels via i.n. administration [19, 20] . As a DNA vaccine delivery system, the CS NPs are expected to increase the uptake and expression efficiency of the DNA vaccine in target cells. However, as compared to other non-viral carriers, the CS NPs mediated transfection efficiency is still relatively low [21, 22] . It has been suggested that the strength of electrostatic interactions between CS and DNA prevents their dissociation within cells, thus precluding transcription of DNA and resulting in low transfection [23] .",

It has been reported that a core-shell nanoparticle system comprised of an anionic PLGA core and a glycol CS/DNA shell surface has been shown for enabling intracellular release of the loaded DNA via a pH-mediated manner, so as to facilitate DNA vaccine transfection in target cells [25] . Anionic lipids, the natural component of eukaryotic cell membranes, have been shown to significantly increase the gene transfection efficiency in cell lines, even better than commercial cationic liposomes [26] . In addition to powerful membrane fusion ability, the anionic liposomes exhibit more advantages compared with the cationic liposomes, especially in cytotoxicity. It has been reported that cationic liposomes are extremely toxic to phagocytic cells, and thus should be used with caution in vivo [27, 28] . Interestingly, mucosal immunization with liposomes seems to be limited and especially dependent on co-administration of other co-stimulants, which is caused by the modulation interaction of liposomes with mucosa and the instability of liposomes under physiological conditions [29] . These results inspired us whether a new system comprised of the AL and CS/DNA could render the transfection efficiency, and further improve the mucosal immunity of DNA vaccine. To our knowledge, very little has been focused on the combined use of bioadhesive CS with AL in nasal DNA vaccine delivery.",

CS/DNA NPs were prepared by adding an equal volume of the diluted CS solution to a DNA (1000 mg/ml) solution at different N/P ratios (amine:phosphate = 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, mole ratio) at room temperature, using a vortex mixer. To prepare AL/CS/ DNA NPs, anionic liposomes (DOPG/DOPE, 4 mg/ml) in 10 mM HEPES buffer were mixed with a DNA (1,000 mg/ml) solution at different lipid/DNA ratios (1, 2, 3, 4, w/w) to a final volume of 100 ml. CS solutions at different N/P ratios were then added dropwise under mild stirring. The pH values of the CSbased NPs were adjusted to 7.4, 7.1, 6.8 or 6.4 for characterization.",

We found that the fluorescence of the two NPs in the cavity exceeded 40% of total fluorescence after i.n. administration within 2 h (Fig. 4B) . However, in comparison to the CS/DNA, a more powerful ability in prolonging the nasal residence time was verified on the AL/CS/DNA. The CS/DNA and AL/CS/DNA were also evaluated for their mucin adsorption ability, which is a measure of mucoadhesive ability of delivery system (Fig. 4C) . The CS/DNA was found to retain more mucin (0.27 mg/mg of DNA) than the naked DNA (0.08 mg/mg of DNA) (p,0.01). The AL/CS/DNA had the more powerful adhesive ability than the CS/DNA, since the mucin adsorption reached 0.36 mg/mg of DNA. However, the increased fold was less than 1.5. These results indicated that addition of AL to the CS/DNA complexes increased the nasal residence time of DNA vaccine on mucosal surface. The prolonged residence time in nasal cavity offered a sustained antigen-mucosa interaction without being cleared away.",

It is proved that FITC modification on CS did not interfere with DNA entrapping capacity and release (Table 1 and Fig. S1 ). As shown in Fig. 5B , the AL/FITC-CS/ DNA was found to penetrate into the deep mucosa layer (up to 17.6 mm) within 2 h. The fluorescence intensity increased to the peak value in the depth of 8.8 mm and lasted to the depth of 13.6 mm, then decreased gradually in the deeper depth. The images of the sections (x, z and y, z) taken in the depth of 8.8 mm inside the mucosa were also shown below. It clearly showed that the AL/FITC-CS/DNA were internalized into mucosal epithelia and transported into deeper regions of mucosal area. However, as shown in Fig. 5A , less FITC-CS/DNA was found to penetrate into the mucosa layer. The three dimensional reconstruction animations from CLMS results were shown in Movie S1 and Movie S2. These results provided the evidence that the AL/CS/DNA was more powerful in penetrating the mucosa layer.",

When formulations were prepared in water at pH 5.5, the ionized CS, DNA and DOPG can form ternary complexes (AL/ CS/DNA) by electrostatic interactions between the positively charged amino groups on CS and the negatively charged phosphate groups on DNA and DOPG. TEM results revealed that the AL/CS/DNA had a relatively spherical shape and an AL core at pH 6.4 (Fig. 3C) . Theoretically, when CS, DNA and AL are mixed together, two domains (CS/DNA and CS/AL) are formed because of electrostatic interactions. Thus, it is more likely that the DNA, AL and CS separately yielded two types of domains (CS/DNA and CS/AL), which were bridged by CS chains in the AL/CS/DNA NPs (Fig. S2) . Similar two-domain structure has been reported by incorporation of poly(g-glutamic acid) in CS/ DNA complex [24] . The AL/CS/DNA had a micron scale size and negative zeta potential when pH increased to 7.4 from 6.4 (Fig. 3A) . In this process, most CS amine groups were deprotonated and CS became hydrophobic. As the electrostatic interactions were no longer significant, hydrogen bonding might be the driving force for CS/DNA binding and CS/AL binding. As both CS/DNA and CS/AL carried negative charges, the electrostatic repulsion between the two resulted in disintegration of the AL/CS/DNA structure and favored the release of loaded DNA. This might explain why the DNA release from the AL/CS/ DNA was pH-dependent (Fig. 3F) . In contrast to AL/CS/DNA, it was reported that the binding of CS and DNA was even tighter for CS/DNA complexes when pH increased to physiological environment and CS/DNA complexes were not disrupted [38] .",

Another reason might be responsible for the high tranfection efficiency of the AL/CS/ DNA.

The PG lipids were proved to have nucleusfusogenic ability [41] , which might facilitate the nuclear translocation of DNA. In addition, the nasal mucosal pH is approximately 5.5-6.5 [42] , which is in favor of stabilizing the AL/CS/ DNA without DNA release before internalization.

It can be explained that CS and its derivatives are considered to be able to transiently open the tight junctions between cells [45, 46, 47] . Surprisingly, enhanced intracellular uptake was verified on the AL/CS/DNA than that of the CS/DNA (Fig. 6B ). Physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, shape, molecular weight and composition play a key role in the cellular uptake of NPs [48] . DOPE lipid has a packing parameter value .1 and is known to adopt an inverted hexagonal structure that favors membrane destabilization for enhanced intracellular uptake. On the other hand, it is reported that globular GC (glyco chitosan) NPs showed an enhanced distribution in cells compared with the irregular GC polymers [49] . Powerful mucosal permeability and enhanced intracellular uptake results explained why more AL/CS/DNA was delivered into mucosal cells (Fig. 5B ) resulting in prolonged nasal residence time, while the CS/DNA was gradually removed by mucociliary clearance. Another reason might be taken into consideration. It can be inferred that the spherical AL/CS/DNA can penetrate the mucus gels through the pores between mucin fibers to contact mucosal epithelia. However, the network shaped CS/DNA might be trapped in the luminal mucus layer because of its steric hindrance. Finally, it was gradually removed by mucociliary clearance. More details about the exact mechanism need to be explored.",

            "text": "It has been verified that prolonging antigen retention in nasal cavity is especially important for enhancing mucosal immunity [43] . As we expected, the AL/CS/DNA was more powerful in inducing specific mucosal and systemic responses compared with the traditional used CS/DNA system. The advantage of increased saliva anti-PAc SIgA production is obvious, which aggregates the unattached S. mutans and interferes with both S. mutans pathogenesis and colonization on the tooth surfaces. Naked DNA without delivery system via i.n. was challenged by ciliary clearance, nuclease degradation and difficulties in uptake and expression, making it unefficient in inducing mucosal and systemic immune responses. It has been indicated by several reports that, in contrast to soluble antigens, particulates could be preferentially taken up by M cells following nasal administration [50] . Noticing the relatively less populations of M cells in NALT [51] and the notorious difficulty in transfection of the APCs with non-viral vectors [52] , we considered that a non M cells or APCs target strategy might be also effective in nasal mucosal immune. In fact, it has been reported that a new pathway of polymer-based DNA vaccine delivery via bystander cells without direct targeting of APCs is successful [53] . In addition, anti-PAc SIgA production in vaginal wash was evaluated (Fig. S4) . The result confirmed that the AL/ CS/DNA can induce a distal mucosal immune response which is agreed with most studies, because the stimulated lymphocytes in NALT can distribute to other mucosal sites such as vagina. This result also confirmed the advantage of incorporating AL. Finally, the AL/CS/DNA showed minimal cytotoxicity and favored quick clearance via digestive tract (Fig. S5) . No obvious distribution of the AL/CS/DNA was detected in other organs (heart, spleen, liver and kidney) except the lung, which reminded us of paying close attention to drug adsorption in lung via i.n. administration.",
