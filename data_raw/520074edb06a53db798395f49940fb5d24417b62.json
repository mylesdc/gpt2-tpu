Although PRRSV infection-induced cell apoptosis has been established, the related viral protein is still unknown. Here, we reported that PRRSV nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) was a critical apoptosis inducer. Nsp4 could activate caspase-3, -8, and -9. Using truncated constructs without different domains in nsp4, we demonstrated that the full-length of nsp4 structure was required for its apoptosis-inducing activity. Furthermore, using site-directed mutagenesis to inactivate the 3C-like serine protease activity of nsp4, we showed that nsp4-induced apoptosis was dependent on its serine protease activity. The ability of nsp4 to induce apoptosis was significantly impaired by His39, Asp64, and Ser118 mutations, suggesting that His39, Asp64, and Ser118 were essential for nsp4 to trigger apoptosis. In conclusion, our present work showed that PRRSV nsp4 could induce apoptosis in host cells and might be partially responsible for the apoptosis induced by PRRSV infection. PRRSV 3C-like protease-mediated apoptosis represents the first report in the genus Arterivirus, family Arteriviridae.",

PRRS was first reported in the United States in 1987 and in the Netherlands in 1991 [3] . The etiologic agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is an enveloped single-stranded positive sense RNA virus and is classified into the genus Arterivirus, family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales [4] . The genome is approximately 15.4 kb in length and contains 10 open reading frames (ORFs), designated as ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORFs 2-7. ORFs 2-7 encode structural proteins including GP2a, GP2b, GP3, GP4, GP5, GP5a, M, and N protein, respectively. The replicative enzymes of PRRSV are encoded in ORF1a and ORF1b, which constitute almost 75% of the genome [1] .",

At least 14 nonstructural proteins (nsp) are generated as a result of serial cleavages of pp1a and pp1ab, including nsp1a, nsp1\u03b2 nsp2, nsp2TF, nsp3, nsp4, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8 nsp9 nsp10 nsp11 and nsp12 [1, 6] . The processing of pp1a and pp1ab is believed to be mediated by accessory proteases, nsp1 and nsp2, and the main serine protease nsp4 [1] . Nsp4 serine protease is responsible for most of the nonstructural protein processing [7, 8] , and is a member of a relatively rare group of proteolytic enzymes, 3C-like serine proteases named after the picornavirus 3C protease [4, 5, 9] . The monomeric enzyme, nsp4, folds into three domains including two chymotrypsin-like \u03b2-barrel domains and an extra C-terminal \u03b1/\u03b2 domain, which are located at 1-69 amino acids (aa) (domains I), 89-153 aa (domains II), and 157-199 aa (domains III), respectively [8] .",

The three mutant constructs were shown schematically in Figure 5A , and their expressions were confirmed by western blot analysis ( Figure 5B ). Next, we investigated the abilities of the deletion mutants to induce apoptosis in Hela cells. As shown in Figure 5C and Figure 5D , the apoptosis level declined remarkably in N69, MID, and C157-transfected cells compared to that in wide-type nsp4transfected cells. In addition, with the double-labeling assay, we observed that wild-type and mutant nsp4 proteins were expressed with no significant differences ( Figure 5E ). However, apoptosis-inducing abilities of N69, MID, and C157 were nearly abolished when compared to wild-type nsp4 ( Figure 5F ).

To assess the role of 3C-like serine protease activity in nsp4-triggered apoptosis, three single-point mutants were generated, including His39Ala (H39A), Asp64Ala (D64A), and Ser118Ala (S118A). The mutants were schematically shown in Figure 6A , and the protein expression of each mutant was confirmed using western blot analysis ( Figure 6B ).

As shown in Figure  6C and Figure 6D , the apoptosis rate induced by either H39A, D64A, or S118A mutant was significantly lower compared to that of wild-type nsp4 with a reduction of about 23.1%, 24.5%, and 50.1%, respectively.

NSP3'4 mutant protein was used as the substrate, which included the last 8 residues of nsp3 and the whole amino acid sequence of nsp4 with Ala substitution for Ser118. If the substrate had been cleaved at the nsp3 and nsp4 junction (E/G) by the active 3Clike protease, nsp3 moiety and nsp4 (Ser118 to Ala) moiety would be expected. As shown in Figure 6G , although NSP3'4 had the 3C-like protease sequence, autocatalytic cleavage did not occur because of the Ser118 to Ala mutation. Furthermore, the substrate was recognized and cleaved by wild-type nsp4, but not by any of the three nsp4 mutants ( Figure 6G , lane 2, 3, 4, and 5).

Like many other positive-strand RNA viruses, PRRSV-infection can induce cell apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro [26] . Evidence of apoptosis has been reported in alveolar macrophages, porcine intravascular monocytes, and lymphocytes in the lungs and lymph nodes of infected pigs, which might be responsible for the dramatic reduction in the number of these cells in PRRSVinfected pigs [19, 26, 27] . Furthermore, PRRSV could replicate in testicular germ cells and induce germ cell apoptosis in vivo [27] . Recently, apoptotic cells were found in B-and T-cell areas of lymphoid organs of infected pigs, as well as in fetal implantation sites at the late stage of gestation [28, 29] . In agreement with these observations, we showed that PAMs infected with HP-PRRSV HV strain exhibited characteristic of apoptosis. In addition, apoptosis was detected both in PRRSVinfected and the neighboring cells, which was consistent with the results published before. Apoptosis in uninfected bystander cells could be induced by the local release of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 from infected cells [13, 27] . An alternative mechanism could be that increased surface expression FasL on surrounding cells is induced by PRRSV infection, and these cells become sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis [24] .",

In addition, the role of 3C-like protease in virusinduced apoptosis was also characterized in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [35] . In the current study, we presented evidence that PRRSV 3C-like protease nsp4 could induce apoptosis in Marc-145 cells and many other cell lines. Interestingly, apoptosis occurred both in nsp4-expressing cells and the surrounding cells, which is similar to the apoptotic phenomenon induced by PRRSV infection. The possibility that nsp4 induces the local release of cytokines (i.e., TNF-\u03b1), or the high expression of surface TNF receptor superfamily could not be excluded. Further investigation is required to explain the molecular mechanisms under this phenomenon. Of note, PRRSV nsp4-induced apoptosis represents the first report of 3C-like proteasemediated apoptosis in the genus Arterivirus, family Arteriviridae.",

EAV induced apoptosis initiated by caspase-8 activation and subsequently by mitochondria-dependent caspase-9 activation [36] . Similarly, in PRRSV infection, both death receptor and mitochondrial pathways were involved in PRRSV-induced apoptosis, and the potential crosstalk between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways was proven by the dependency of caspase-9 activation on caspase-8 activity and the cleavage of Bid in PRRSV-infected cells [24] . In our study, we showed that caspase-3, -8, and -9 were activated evidently both in PRRSV-infected PAMs and nsp4-transfected cells. Blocking caspase-8 activation by its inhibitor led to a nearly complete inhibition of PRRSV-induced or nsp4-induced apoptosis (data not show), implicating that the crosstalk between intrinsic and extrinsic pathways may exist in nsp4-induced cell apoptosis. Further study is necessary to uncover the mechanisms.",

            "text": "PRRSV nsp4 protein is a 22.4 kDa protein, which consists of three domains. Domain I and II form the typical chymotrypsinlike two-\u03b2-barrel fold. The C-terminal domain III, which is dispensable for proteolytic activity, may be involved in polyprotein proteolysis [5] . Using deletion analysis, we showed that each of the three domains was essential for nsp4 to induce cell apoptosis. We also demonstrated that when the 3C-like protease activity of nsp4 was abolished by single-point mutation, the ability of nsp4 to induce apoptosis was significantly impaired. These results were in accordance with the previous report that protease activity was necessary for 3C protease of enterovirus 71 to induce apoptosis in human neural cells [31] . Furthermore, apoptosis was nearly absent in S118Atransfected cells, suggesting that Ser118 might be a more important factor for nsp4 to induce apoptosis. However, we need to indicate that separation of domains might destabilize the protein tertiary structure, resulting in loss of function. So it is hard to conclude the involvement of a particular domain of nsp4 in apoptosis. For the point mutation, even though the effect might be less on the structure, we also could not exclude the possibility that single mutation has effect on its structure, and subsequently lead to the loss of its protease activity.",
