Herein we conceptualize hospital surge elements, and lessons learnt from such events, to help build appropriately matched responses to future ID surge threats. Methods: We used the Interpretive Descriptive qualitative approach. Interviews (n = 35) were conducted with governance and public health specialists; hospital based staff; and General Practitioners. Key policy literature in tandem with the interview data were used to iteratively generate a Hospital ID Surge framework. We anchored our narrative account within this framework, which is used to structure our analysis. Results: A spectrum of surge threats from combinations of capacity (for crowding) and capability (for treatment complexity) demands were identified. Starting with the Pyramid scenario, or an influx of high screening rates flooding Emergency Departments, alongside fewer and manageable admissions; the Reverse-Pyramid occurs when few cases are screened and admitted but those that are, are complex; during a 'Black' scenario, the system is overburdened by both crowding and complexity. The Singapore hospital system is highly adapted to crowding, functioning remarkably well at constant near-full capacity in Peacetime and resilient to Endemic surges. We catalogue 26 strategies from lessons learnt relating to staffing, space, supplies and systems, crystalizing institutional memory. The DECIDE model advocates linking these strategies to types of surge threats and offers a step-by-step guide for coordinating outbreak planning and response. Conclusions: Lack of a shared definition and decision making of surge threats had rendered the procedures somewhat duplicative. This burden was paradoxically exacerbated by a health system that highly prizes planning and forward thinking, but worked largely in silo until an ID crisis hit. Many such lessons can be put into play to further strengthen our current hospital governance and adapted to more diverse settings.",

Some key challenges include shortage of Protective Personal Equipment (PPE), communication, and systems incident management [4, 5, 8] . Systems bottlenecks are the largest crosscutting issue for surge planning and response. For example, according to a study of 29 disasters prior to 9/11 in USA, in only 6% of cases was there a supply shortage and only 2% suffered manpower shortages [9] . The issue therefore is often about getting the right resources to the right places at the right time.",

Given that surge events can be meaningfully conceptualized [8, [13] [14] [15] and are also bound to realities and shifting contexts, the IntD theoretical underpinnings are well aligned to our work.

From a capability perspective, it appears more efficient to centre the bulk of resources in one place; yet we were reminded by our participants that this comes with risks (contagion during transportation and transfer), and requires planning of transport and investment in logistics. It is nevertheless underway (S14) that a state-of-the-art ID hospital is being built. Largely, it appears, to be able to deal with a Reverse-Pyramid hospital surge scenario. This new facility should particularly cater adequate isolation wards, unlike wards during SARS: 'So from a ward that is 30-35 bedder, suddenly you are dealing with ward with seven beds.

Transportation of suspected cases from one hospital to another is another big area of concern. Ambulatory personnel can be infected while transferring patients from one hospital to other [30] . There were divided opinions on the usefulness of a single centre taking charge of ID surge. Yet to have a designated ID hospital equipped with the right capability and improving the capability of chosen 'sister' institutions will save total shutdowns and duplications of planning measures. Singapore has planned a centre solely for ID [22] , this coupled with creation of appropriately selected and provisioned alternate treatment sites, and cutting down of electives [32] keeps the system working a as whole. Peripheral hospitals tend to have fewer ID staff, nor funding to establish high capability in handling IDs [4, 5, 33, 34] .",

For example, in settings that cannot prevent vector outbreaks at source so well, endemic outbreaks -e.g. Malaria during the rainy seasons -may not be manageable, and will instead be typified as a pyramid scenario. Likely with more admissions than was the case with H1N1 in our setting due to higher transmissibility, thus a wider middle tier and admissions peak. And not all Peacetime settings will be predisposed to capacity limitations from the start. The current study fills in the shapes of what is 'known' to help plan for 'unknowns' [39] during ID outbreaks.",

The analysis and theoretical IntD underpinnings were agreed and undertaken by ZH and SS. SS organized the data according to the Framework for ID hospital surge planning & response. This framework was iteratively derived from key literature and the data and agreed by ZH. SS coded the data for explanatory themes in each of the categories of the framework. YSL, ZH, AC and SS generated the typology and all authors commented on the proposed lessons learnt strategies, which are narrated and co-constructed, based on the lived experiences of multiple upsurges, according to the IntD approach. SS wrote an initial draft, which was subsequently co-written, and analyses revised and the DECIDE model conceived by ZH. ZH responded to reviewers' comments and wrote the final draft. All authors commented on the paper and agreed the submission.
