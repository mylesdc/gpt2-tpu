            "text": "Background: The mortality rate of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) patients is a major challenge in all healthcare systems worldwide. Because the MERS-CoV risk-standardized mortality rates are currently unavailable in the literature, the author concentrated on developing a method to estimate the risk-standardized mortality rates using MERS-CoV 3-and 30-day mortality measures. Methods: MERS-CoV data in Saudi Arabia is publicly reported and made available through the Saudi Ministry of Health (SMOH) website. The author studied 660 MERS-CoV patients who were reported by the SMOH between December 2, 2014 and November 12, 2016. The data gathered contained basic demographic information (age, gender, and nationality) , healthcare worker, source of infection, pre-existing illness, symptomatic, severity of illness, and regions in Saudi Arabia. The status and date of mortality were also reported. Cox-proportional hazard (CPH) models were applied to estimate the hazard ratios for the predictors of 3-and 30-day mortality. Results: 3-day, 30-day, and overall mortality were found to be 13.8%, 28.3%, and 29.8%, respectively. According to CPH, multivariate predictors of 3-day mortality were elderly, non-healthcare workers, illness severity, and hospital-acquired infections (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) =1.7; 8.8; 6.5; and 2.8, respectively). Multivariate predictors of 30-day mortality were elderly, non-healthcare workers, pre-existing illness, severity of illness, and hospital-acquired infections (aHR =1.7; 19.2; 2.1; 3.7; and 2.9, respectively). Conclusions: Several factors were identified that could influence mortality outcomes at 3 days and 30 days, including age (elderly), non-healthcare workers, severity of illness, and hospital-acquired infections. The findings can serve as a guide for healthcare practitioners by appropriately identifying and managing potential patients at high risk of death.",

This results in an overall mortality rate of 41% on reported cases in Saudi Arabia. However, a number of other studies in Saudi Arabia have reported MERS-CoV with widely varying mortality rates. Assiri reported a 60% mortality rate on a sample 47 cases [4] , while another study reported a mortality rate of 42% [5] . Two other studies reported a mortality rate of 40% [6, 7] , and Coleman reported a mortality rate of 38% [8] . The reported mortality rates in Saudi Arabia tend to be higher than in other countries [9] . A study in Jordan reported a mortality rate of 22% in MERS cases [10] , while two studies in South Korea reported 19% [11] and 20.4% [12] mortality rates in MERS cases.",

Little data has been collected on risk-standardized mortality rates and multivariate risk factors of 3-and 30-day mortality in the MERS-CoV population. Per the author knowledge, a single study used Poisson regression to identify risk factors for overall mortality and severe MERS-CoV disease [18] .

The ages of patients were classified into two groups: elderly \u226560 years and <60 years old. MERS-CoV source of infections was investigated and reported as camels, household contact, hospital-acquired infection, and unknown infection source.

No significant difference in the overall mortality rate was noted between males and females (31.2% vs. 27.1%; p = 0.281). However, there was a significantly higher mortality rate in elderly patients (\u2265 60 years) compared with patients aged <60 years (45.2% vs. 20.0%; p = 0.001). A higher mortality rate was found in those of the Saudi nationality (35.8% vs. 15.5% non-Saudi nationality; p = 0.001), those with preexisting illness (60.6% vs. 15.7% non-preexisting illness; p = 0.001), and the severity of illness (50.0% vs. 14.9% stable condition; p = 0.001). It was found that healthcare workers had a significantly lower mortality rate (1% vs. 29.6% nonhealthcare workers; p = 0.001). A high risk of mortality was noted in patients with unknown (39.5%) sources of infections as compared to 4.5% household contact, 25.2% camels, 27.4% healthcare acquired; p = 0.001. The West/North region reported the lowest mortality rate (22.1%) as compared to 29.2% South, 31.7% East, 31.1% Central; p = 0.026.",

This data was also publicly available through the WHO website along with other MERS-CoV new case situational reports from other countries. Although the overall mortality rate (29.8%) in this study slightly decreased from what had been reported in Saudi Arabia, 60% [4] , 42% [5] , 40% [6, 7] , 38% [8] , with approximately one death in three of those infected with the MERS-CoV virus, it is still troubling and remains high when compared to South Korea [11, 12] . The recent declining in MERS-CoV mortality in Saudi Arabia could be due to implementation of prevention and control policies and placing great attention on MERS-CoV management in order to improve patient clinical outcomes. It was noted that there was a decline in the incidence of MERS-CoV infection reported over the past 2 years. A prior study has indicated that cases occurring later in the MERS-CoV emergence were less of a serious threat [18] . Little is known on 3-and 30-day survival of MERS-CoV patients. The study investigated 3-and 30-day survival rates and their risk factors. The 3-and 30-day survival rates in MERS-CoV patients were found to be 86.2% and 71.7%, respectively.",

Being elderly was associated with a 1.7 times higher risk of 3-and 30-day mortality as compared with those under age 60. The hazard of death in the elderly with MERS-CoV infections was 70% higher than with those under age 60. This evidence is consistent with most of previous studies, supporting the fact that older age is associated with increased risk of mortality in MERS-CoV patients [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Since it is not clear whether MERS-CoV related-death can be prevented among elderly patients, medical investigation and screening are warranted in elderly MERS-CoV patients to identify the reasons behind the high risk of death. The study findings suggest that there was no statistically significant difference in the 3-and 30-day survival between males and females, unlike other studies that suggest males have a higher risk of death [19, 20] , while another study contradicts these two studies' findings and suggest that males have a low risk of death [21] .

However, a large epidemiological study is needed to evaluate the high risk of death among the non-healthcare worker group. In such a study, modifiable factors could be assessed.

The study data was based on Saudi Ministry of Health situational reports which are publicly available sources and not directly aggregated from patients' medical records or follow-ups. The date from symptoms onset was not reported publicly by the Saudi Ministry of Health, thus the time of the MERS-CoV diagnosis to outcome was used, rather than the date of symptom onset. Not all patients experience MERS symptoms, while other patients may experience mild or severe respiratory illness, thus the survival rate may differ if the date of symptom onset was used. A delay in the MERS diagnosis could worsen patient outcome and increase the risk of death. The patient outcomes (died/alive) and new cases are updated daily by the Saudi Ministry of Health. Thus, the patient outcomes may not represent the final outcomes. The new cases, time of diagnosis, death status, and date of death were recorded at the time of reporting. However, the current analyses were based on the report as of November 12, 2016, where the data has been accessed by the study author. As this data is gathered from public sources, there is no information on cause of death or details on underlying conditions. Not having the specific underlying conditions at hand, the current study findings suggest that this type of association might become a prerequisite for interventional studies. There is no information regarding patients' occupations, however it may be that there are possible links between occupation and MERS-CoV infection. Nonetheless, the current study evaluated MERS-CoV outcomes, such as 3-and 30-day mortality and their risk factors. A great advantage of the conducted study is that the author extracted large MERS data and took several prognostic factors into account to predict 3-and 30-day mortality in MERS. This study could be of value to policymakers and healthcare systems worldwide in identifying patients with high risk of death and shorter survival. The study revealed several prognostic factors that might explain the high rates of early mortality. It looks promising (in both bivariate and multivariate analyses) that having such information was associated with 3-and 30-day mortality. The results of this study may be useful to healthcare professionals who are providing medical care for MERS patients by appropriately identifying and managing potential patients at high risk of death.",
