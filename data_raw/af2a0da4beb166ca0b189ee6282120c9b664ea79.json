            "text": "The azurophilic granules of human neutrophils contain four a-defensins called human neutrophil peptides (HNPs 1-4). HNPs are tridisulfide-linked antimicrobial peptides involved in the intracellular killing of organisms phagocytosed by neutrophils. The peptides are produced as inactive precursors (proHNPs) which are processed to active microbicides by as yet unidentified convertases. ProHNP1 was expressed in E. coli and the affinity-purified propeptide isolated as two species, one containing mature HNP1 sequence with native disulfide linkages (''folded proHNP1'') and the other containing non-native disulfide linked proHNP1 conformers (misfolded proHNP1). Native HNP1, liberated by CNBr treatment of folded proHNP1, was microbicidal against Staphylococcus aureus, but the peptide derived from misfolded proHNP1 was inactive. We hypothesized that neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase 3 (PR3) or cathepsin G (CG), serine proteases that co-localize with HNPs in azurophil granules, are proHNP1 activating convertases. Folded proHNP1 was converted to mature HNP1 by both NE and PR3, but CG generated an HNP1 variant with an N-terminal dipeptide extension. NE and PR3 cleaved folded proHNP1 to produce a peptide indistinguishable from native HNP1 purified from neutrophils, and the microbicidal activities of in vitro derived and natural HNP1 peptides were equivalent. In contrast, misfolded proHNP1 conformers were degraded extensively under the same conditions. Thus, NE and PR3 possess proHNP1 convertase activity that requires the presence of the native HNP1 disulfide motif for high fidelity activation of the precursor in vitro.",

In mammals, defensins and cathelicidins are the primary AMPs expressed in professional phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages [1] . Mammalian defensins comprise three structural subfamilies termed a-, band h-defensins. While all defensins are arginine rich, tridisulfide containing peptides, they are distinguished from each other by the presence of unique disulfide motifs [2] . In addition, h-defensins, which are approximately half the size of aand b-defensins, are macrocyclic molecules which have only been isolated from leukocytes of Old World monkeys (reviewed in [2, 3] ). Defensins have antimicrobial activities against diverse microbial targets that include bacteria [4] , fungi [5, 6] , viruses [7, 8, 9] , and protozoa [10] . Certain a-, b-, and h-defensins function as regulators of adaptive immune cells and thus function to modulate inflammation [11, 12, 13] and bridge innate and adaptive immunity [14] .",

In neutrophils, HNP 1-4 are stored in the cytoplasmic azurophil granules which are mobilized during phagocytosis resulting in the exposure of ingested microorganisms to high concentrations of HNPs in the phagolysosomes [2] . In the setting of bacteremic sepsis, HNPs also accumulate in the extracellular compartment [15, 16] . Several studies have demonstrated an extracellular role for myeloid adefensins in regulating cellular activities including cell proliferation [17, 18, 19] , neovascularization [20, 21] , chemotaxis [22] , and regulation of cytokines [23, 24] and signal transduction pathways [17, 19, 24, 25] .

Neutrophil elastase (NE), an azurophil granule protease, was shown to correctly process RMAD4, a rhesus macaque neutrophil a-defensin in vitro [32] . Bovine and human cathelicidins, a distinct class of antimicrobial peptides, are processed by the azurophil granule proteases, NE [33] and proteinase 3 (PR3) [34] respectively. Studies with HL-60 cells, a human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line, show that HNPs are biosynthesized and processed to mature peptides in these cells [35] , but the proteases involved in maturation of human myeloid a-defensins have not been identified. Because HNPs co-localize to neutrophil granules containing the serine proteases NE, PR3 and cathepsin G (CG) [36] , we hypothesized that HNP maturation is mediated by one or more of these proteinases. In this study, recombinant proHNP1 was used as substrate to analyze the human a-defensin convertase activities of NE, PR3, and CG. The requirement for the native HNP1 fold was analyzed by assessing the processing of folded and misfolded preparations of proHNP1. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of the resulting HNP-1 peptides was analyzed utilizing Staphylococcus aureus as the test organism.",

This was confirmed by the finding that DTTreduced proHNP1A and proHNP1B co-eluted on RP-HPLC (data not shown) and by demonstrating that folding of proHNP1B in the presence of reduced/oxidized glutathione led to the formation of proHNP1A (Text S1 and Figure S1 ). Thus, proHNP1A and proHNP1B contain folded and misfolded His 6 -proHNP1 respectively. ProHNP1A and proHNP1B-containing fractions were pooled separately and purified to homogeneity by a second round of RP-HPLC (Fig. 2F ).",

Cleavage of proHNP1A with CNBr, followed by C18 RP-HPLC, gave rise to a major peptide product (Fig. 3A ) with a mass (Fig. 3B ) and HPLC retention time (Fig. 3C ) matching that of natural HNP1. However, CNBr digestion of proHNP1B generated multiple species (Fig. 3A ) that had masses consistent with oxidized HNP1 (Fig. 3B ), but which eluted later than native HNP1 in RP-HPLC (Fig. 3C) . On AU PAGE, HNP1 derived from proHNP1A comigrated with natural HNP1. However, HNP1 derived from proHNP1B migrated more rapidly than the natural standard (Fig. 3D) . These data demonstrate that proHNP1A contained folded HNP1 with native disulfide linkages but the mature peptide in proHNP1B, although oxidized, is misfolded and contains non-native disulfide linkages. In solution, HNP1 exists as a non-covalent dimer [37] and the dimeric form corresponds to the single band observed in AU PAGE (Selsted et al., unpublished data) . Therefore, it is likely that the higher mobility of proHNP1B-derived HNP1 (Fig. 3D ) is due to the monomeric state of this conformer.",

To test for the role of these granule serine proteases in human HNP processing, proHNP1A was incubated in separate reactions with NE, PR3, or CG, and the RP-HPLC-purified cleavage products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and analytical HPLC ( Fig. 5 and Table 1 ). Incubation of His 6 -proHNP1 with NE or PR3 generated peptide products that coeluted with native HNP1 in RP-HPLC (34. Table 1 ). The identities of HNP1 derivatives were also confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS of each peptide following reduction and S-carboxyamidomethylation. In each case reduction and alkylation produced a mass increase of 348 A.M.U., confirming the presence of 6 disulfide-linked cysteine residues ( Table 1 ). The NE-and PR3-derived peptides also comigrated with native HNP1 on AU-gels ( Fig. 5C ; lanes 1-3).

To test this, we produced proHNP1 without the Nterminal tag by incubating proHNP1A with enterokinase, thereby releasing the 41-residue tag sequence.

In previous studies with HL-60 and chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, Valore and Ganz demonstrated sequential proteolytic processing of proHNP with the formation of a 56-residue intermediate that is subsequently processed to mature HNP. While proHNPs were found exclusively in the cytoplasmic/microsomal fraction, the granule fraction contained only the intermediate and mature HNP [35] . Therefore it is likely that proHNP-processing by NE and PR3 occurs during the packaging of HNPs in azurophil granules. CG processing of proHNP1A produced a peptide that was extended at the amino terminus by two residues (Asn-Met) expressed at the carboxyl terminus of the HNP1 prosegment. Harwig et al. identified a minor form of HNP3 in fully differentiated neutrophils with the same Asn-Met dipeptide extension [41] reported here.

Since MMP7 is not present in neutrophils, it was proposed that MMP7 may be involved in the extracellular processing of proHNP1 released from the specific granules of neutrophils. In this regard, Borregaard and co-workers showed that proHNP1 is present in the specific granules of mature human neutrophils and that the propeptide is secreted by activated cells [43] . Since enzymatically active NE is present in inflammatory exudates [44] , we hypothesize that proHNP1, elaborated by activated PMNs, may be activated by NE (and possibly other enzymes such as PR3 and CG) in the extracellular milieu.

In a previous study, Wu et al. demonstrated efficient folding of proHNP1 in vitro using reduced/oxidized glutathione to mediate thiol-disulfide exchange [29] . Employing this approach, 10 mg of HPLC purified His 6 -proHNP1 was dissolved in 500 ml 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 0.8 M urea and 100 mM NaCl (TUN buffer) with or without 2 mM reduced and 0.4 mM oxidized glutathione and incubated at 37uC for 4 h at which point the reaction was stopped by addition of 50 ml acetic acid. Reaction products were purified by RP-HPLC on a Vydac analytical C18 column (4.6 mm6250 mm) using a 20-to-55% (1% per min; 1 ml/min flow rate) linear gradient of ACN in 0.1% TFA acetonitrile. Peak fractions were collected and analyzed by AU-PAGE. In the absence of glutathione, the retention time during RP-HPLC and electrophoretic pattern was unchanged compared to the respective starting materials (Fig. S1A and B ). After incubation with glutathione, the behavior of proHNP1A was unchanged on C18 RP-HPLC (Fig. S1C) and on AU PAGE (Fig.  S1C, lane 5) . However, treatment of proHNP1B with glutathione generated a new species that behaved like proHNP1A on both C18 RP-HPLC and AU-PAGE (Fig. S1C) . These data indicate that proHNP1A and proHNP1B are folded and misfolded forms of His 6 -proHNP1respectively and that proHNP1B can be folded in the presence of reduced/oxidized glutathione. (DOC)",
