A CNE alignment led to the detection of a set of highly conserved nucleotide clusters that occupy strictly conserved positions in the CNE sequence. The significant length of the CNE and conservation of both its length and cluster architecture were identified as a combination of characteristics that make this CNE different from known viral non-coding functional sequences. The essential role of the CNE in the Alphabaculovirus life cycle was demonstrated through the use of a CNEknockout Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) bacmid. It was shown that the essential function of the CNE was not mediated by the presumed expression activities of the protein-and non-protein-coding genes that overlap the AcMNPV CNE. On the basis of the presented data, the AcMNPV CNE was categorized as a complex-structured, polyfunctional genomic element involved in an essential DNA transaction that is associated with an undefined function of the baculovirus genome.",

Numerous nfes have been identified in viral genomes, including the common elements shared by all life forms (e.g., transcriptional regulatory sequences, replication origins (oris)) and virus-specific elements. The latter involve viral DNA processing and packaging signals, which are characteristic of the vast majority of viruses [1] , and signals that govern the integration and excision of viral DNA into and out of the host genome, which are characteristic of some integrative phages [2] and viruses that are exemplified by adenoassociated viruses [3] , retroviruses [4] , and herpesviruses [5] . The diversity of strategies developed by different viruses to successfully propagate themselves has resulted in a wide variety of viral nfes with regard to structure and mechanism of action.",

            "text": "The family Baculoviridae comprises a diverse collection of arthropod-specific viruses with large, covalently closed, circular double-stranded DNA genomes that are predicted to comprise up to 180 genes [6] . The family is traditionally divided into two genera, namely Nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) and Granulovirus (GV), on the basis of the morphology of the occlusion bodies (polyhedra and granules, respectively) produced by the members of each genus in the final stage of infection. Modern taxonomy reflects the co-evolution of baculoviruses with their hosts, and accordingly, the Baculoviridae family includes the Alphabaculovirus, Betabaculovirus, Deltabaculovirus, and Gammabaculovirus genera represented by lepidopteran NPVs (classified into Group I and II), lepidopteran GVs, dipteran NPVs, and hymenopteran NPVs, respectively [6] . A comparative analysis of baculoviral genomes has revealed that baculoviruses are highly diverse in terms of their GC content, genome length, gene content, and gene organization [7] [8] [9] , which likely reflects their long evolutionary history in adapting to different hosts. The conservation of the general mechanisms of baculoviral pathogenesis can be deduced from comparative genomic studies; specifically, 37 core genes shared by all sequenced baculovirus genomes [10] [11] and common DNA nfes have been identified. The latter include (i) homologous repeat regions (hrs), specifically organized sequences interspersed at multiple locations throughout the genomes of representatives of all baculovirus genera [10] , which function as enhancers [12] [13] and oris [14] [15] , and (ii) the so-called non-hr oris revealed in both Alphabaculovirus [16] [17] [18] [19] and Betabaculovirus [20] genomes.",

The infection process characteristic of this virus-cell system was associated with the emergence of linear viral genomes, a phenomenon that has never been reported before in relation to other baculovirus-host systems. The ''break site'', referred to herein as the ''linearization site'', was localized to a defined locus on the ManeNPV genome map [23] . The terminal sequences of the linear ManeNPV genome were considered to be of great interest because, when linked together in a circular genome, the terminal sequences were expected to compose an nfe involved in some unexplored aspect of baculoviral genome activity that is associated with the conversion of the original circular DNA into a linear derivative.",

A comparative sequence analysis demonstrated that, although the homologous sequences overlap with short, putative protein-coding ORFs in the genomes of some viruses, the non-protein-coding content of the sequence is likely to be subject to strong negative selection. This observation became the basis for categorizing the newly identified element as a conserved non-protein-coding element (CNE). An examination of the consensus sequence obtained by aligning the CNEs extracted from 38 Alphabaculovirus genomes revealed highly conserved nucleotide clusters represented by specifically arranged repeated sequences.

In the present study, the BamHI-D fragment of the genome harboring the linearization site was cloned into pBR325. A physical map indicating the KpnI, BamHI, PstI, BglII, and HindIII cleavage sites of the resulting recombinant plasmid pMB-D was constructed ( Figure S1 ), and the linearization site was positioned on the plasmid map less than 100 bp downstream of the PstI site, in accordance with its location on the physical map of the ManeNPV genome. The smallest fragment containing the linearization site, a 2.1-kbp BglII-HindIII fragment, was subsequently subcloned into pUC18 and sequenced (GenBank accession number KF460031). Three ORFs longer than the usual gene length limit of 150 bp were detected within the nucleotide sequence of the fragment ( Figure 1A ) ( Figure S2) . A BLAST search across the nucleotide databases revealed homology between one of three ORFs and baculovirus hoar, a gene encoding a zinc-finger-containing protein with an as-yet-undefined function [24] . In addition, numerous sequences homologous to the nucleotide segment representing the central part of the 649-bp spacer region between hoar and the ORF were identified. These sequences were detected in all Alphabaculovirus genomes sequenced to date, whereas a BLAST search failed to detect such a conserved element (CE) in the rest of the baculovirus genomes available in the databases, namely in 14 Betabaculovirus, 3 Gammabaculovirus, and 1 Deltabaculovirus genomes. To determine the CE boundaries, CEcontaining regions of approximately 200 bp in length from 38 Alphabaculovirus genome sequences were aligned. The CEs represented by the conserved portions of the compared sequences were found to range from 154 to 157 bp in length. The CE alignment is shown in Figure S3 , and the list of alphabaculoviruses and the CE location in the genome of each virus are shown in Table 1 ; the abbreviations for the virus names used herein are also provided in this table. The recently published baculovirus phylogenetic tree was used as a source of information regarding the evolutionary relationships between the viruses for which CEs were compared [9] . The ClustalW alignment summary (Table S1 ) was analyzed to estimate the degree of CE sequence conservation between 38 Alphabaculovirus species, revealing a high degree of CE sequence similarity, ranging from 66% (for a pair of distantly related viruses, such as EupsNPV-OpMNPV) to 100% (for some virus pairs that appear to be variants of each other, e.g., BomaNPV-BmNPV).",

Based on the comparison of the PstI site position (17 bp upstream of the CE, in accordance with the sequencing data, and less than 100 bp upstream of the linearization site, in accordance with the ManeNPV physical map, with the CE size (155 bp), it was concluded that the linearization site must be located within the CE.

An analysis of their localizations demonstrated that none of them overlapped with the CE region, and, therefore, the possibility that the CE encodes a conserved alphabaculovirus-specific protein was excluded. However, although ORFs with more than 50 codons are more commonly considered potential protein-coding regions, shorter ORFs should not be absolutely ignored; in fact, they may encode functional, short oligopeptides. To test the potential of CEs of different alphabaculoviruses to encode common short oligopeptide, an examination of the ORFs that overlap each CE locus was performed. A BLAST-based comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences of the polypeptides potentially encoded by numerous ORFs that completely or partially overlap the CEs or their complements failed to identify a putative product shared by all alphabaculoviruses. Thus, it was concluded that a putatively functional, conserved element of Alphabaculovirus genomes may be represented by the non-protein/oligopeptide-coding sequence. The above conclusion does not, however, preclude the possibility that the CE could overlap with protein-coding sequences in the genomes of certain Alphabaculovirus species. Thirteen of the ORFs that overlapped the CE in Alphabaculovirus genomes were selected as the most probable protein gene candidates (Table 1) , as their lengths were found to be more than 150 bp.",

Interestingly, as AT pairs represent 76% of the absolutely conserved bases of the CNE sequence, they constitute a remarkable proportion of the sequences of the conserved clusters.

Two nucleotide clusters (cluster 1 and cluster 7) localized at the CNE termini were found to be represented by similar imperfect DSs (named the left DS (DSl) and right DS (DSr), respectively), each of which was organized as a pair of short A/T-rich inverted repeats (IRs) separated by five asymmetric nucleotides. A comparative analysis of all the DSls and all the DSrs found in the 38 CNEs ( Figure S5 ) demonstrated that a minimal DS arm shared by the vast majority of the DSs analyzed was represented by the hexanucleotide TTTTTG in the forward and reverse orientations. The arm length of many DSs was found to exceed the 6-bp limit due to the presence of less conserved symmetrical complementary bases located proximally to the 6-bp IR, termed the ''core IR''; therefore, the arm length of 71 of the 76 DSs was found to range from 6 to 14 bp. The core IRs different from TTTTTG/CAAAAA were only detected in the DSs of four virus species; specifically, symmetrical T-A/A-T substitutions in IRl and IRr' of AgMNPV and CfDEFNPV (viruses that occupy neighboring branches on the phylogenetic tree) resulted in the transformation of minimal IRs into TTATTG and CAATAA, respectively, and point mutations in both hexameric IRls' and IRr' of ManeMNPV and in a hexameric IRl' of ApMNPV converted them to CAAAAT ( Figure S5 ). Taking into account these five degenerate hexanucleotides, it could be postulated that the WTTWTG motif in the forward and reverse orientations is a common core structural unit of both the DSl and DSr. A minimal 17-bp DS composed of core IRs was designated the ''core DS''. It is remarkable, that symmetrical complementary bases framing core DSs in the majority of the CNEs are predominantly represented by T/A ( Figure S5 ), i.e. both DSl and DSr exhibit a tendency to the AT-richness preservation. Further analyses concerning the core Dsl and DSr revealed that these elements are enclosed in the two 33-bp protein-binding regions identified by Krappa and co-workers in the AcMNPV genome ( Figure S4 ).",

An examination of the AcMNPV genome demonstrated that the CNE constitutes the central part of a symmetrically arranged region located between the coding sequences of the divergently transcribed immediate early genes ie2 and pe38 [62] ( Figure 1B ) ( Figure S4 ). Both ie2 and pe38 are transcriptional transactivators, participating in many processes, among which DNA replication (ie2 and pe38) and cell cycle arrest (ie2) [22] . Gene knockout experiments clearly demonstrated a non essential role of pe38 in the AcMNPV infection in Heliothis virescens larvae [63] . Although the mutational analysis of the ie2 gene provided evidence of a non essential role of several ie2 activities [64] [65] in virus propagation in Sf21 cells, the dispensability of full ie2 in the AcMNPV life cycle remains questionable. Functional studies demonstrated that the 43-bp sequence (132212-132254) that overlaps DSl, the 43-bp sequence (132345-132387) that overlaps DSr, and a 243-bp (132173-132415) sequence that overlaps the full CNE increased ie2 core promoter activity [58] , but not pe38 promoter activity when the DSr-containing part of the AcMNPV CNE was tested [56] . Remarkably, the AcMNPV DNA motifs that bind proteins in uninfected and infected cells at early stages of infection (see previous section) are enclosed in 43-bp ie2 promoter-activating sequences. Thus, according to its location and activity, the AcMNPV CNE can be categorized as an upstream, early transcriptional regulator.",

            "text": "Transcripts. A comprehensive analysis of the AcMNPV transcriptome [60] revealed three transcription start sites (TSSs) associated with the synthesis of RNAs that overlap the CNE/ Ac152-containing region ( Figure 1B) (Figure S4 ). The identified TSSs were located at positions 131594, 132300, and 132968 in the AcMNPV genome. While TSS 132968 and TSS 132300 are marks of same-strand overlapping genes (or alternatively, a single gene encoding two overlapping transcripts), TSS 131594 is assigned to the third overlapping gene that is transcribed from the opposite strand. An analysis of each TSS location relative to Ac152 suggests that TSS 132968 is a component of the putative protein-coding gene responsible for the synthesis of Ac152 product. The detection of six additional upstream start codons in the 381-bp putative 59untranslated region of RNA initiated at TSS 132968 suggests that Ac152 translation from this RNA is rather questionable. However, Ac152 protein expression is not impossible; the translational activity of RNAs of some eukaryotic and viral proteins are regulated by one or several additional AUG located upstream of the true start codon [66] [67] . Furthermore, it has been suggested that different TSSs may be used for the initiation of mRNA during virus propagation in different hosts [60] . Therefore, as TSS 132968 was predicted on the basis of the AcMNPV transcriptome analysis derived from infected Tni cells, the utilization of an alternative TSS for the expression of Ac152 protein in Sf9 cells cannot be ruled out.",

Accordingly, it can be concluded that an as-yet-undefined essential function other than transcriptional cis-regulation must be attributed to the CNE.

However, the infectious nature of vAc CNE-KO-REP-EGFP is consistent with the conclusion that even if Ac152 represents a coding sequence, its product is not essential for viral pathogenesis (vAc CNE-KO-REP-EGFP is unlikely to express the active Ac152 product because it carries a truncated gene consisting of 179 bp of Ac152 preceded by only 21 bp of its 59-proximal region that is not expected to enclose a minimal promoter).

During the experiment described in the previous section, the bacmids vAc CNE-KO-EGFP , vAc GP64-KO-EGFP , and their mixture, were used to transfect Sf9 cells. The number of cells emitting fluorescence was found to be comparable between all transfected monolayers at 48 h p.t. A further inspection of the samples at 96 h p.t. revealed an unaltered number of fluorescent cells in the monolayers that were transfected with each of the deletion mutants (vAc GP64-KO-EGFP or vAc CNE-KO-EGFP ) alone and a greatly increased number of fluorescent cells in the monolayers that were co-transfected with the vAc GP64-KO-EGFP and vAc CNE-KO-EGFP mixture. The subsequent passaging of the inocula harvested from the transfected cell monolayers onto fresh Sf9 cells verified that the inoculum from the mixed transfected cells contained infectious virus ( Figure 4A ). It was predictable that the observed ''rescue of infectivity'' should be a result of the recovery of the wild-type phenotype (vAc EGFP ) caused by recombination between the gp64and CNE-deficient mutant genomes and as a result of the viability of vAc GP64-KO-EGFP complemented with gp64 expressed from the vAc CNE-KO-EGFP genome. To confirm this and to address the question of whether CNE deficiency was also complemented in trans, viral DNA was purified from both the transfected and infected cells and subsequently tested for the presence of different genotypes. Two pairs of primers (31, 32 and 45, 46) were designed (see Materials and Methods) to amplify fragments that could be indicative of CNE-deficient, gp64deficient, CNE-intact, and gp64-intact genomes (Figure 3) . The PCR analysis demonstrated that only CNE-intact genomes were present in the cells inoculated with the viruses that originated from the mixed transfection; only the 0.2-kbp fragment indicative of the intact CNE was amplified, and there was no evidence of the 1.2kbp fragment, which is indicative of a CNE-deficient genome, on the electropherogram ( Figure 4C , line 6) in three repeated experiments. As expected, the 1.2-bp fragment indicative of vAc GP64-KO-EGFP was amplified ( Figure 4C , line 69) together with the 1.5-kb fragment indicative of a gp64-intact virus. Taking into consideration the amplification pattern discussed above ( Figure 4C , line 6), the 1.5-kbp fragment could not be attributed to the presence of the vAc CNE-KO-EGFP genomes in the DNA sample analyzed. Plaque assays confirmed the presence of vAc EGFP in the virus population that originated from the mixed transfection (data not shown), thus explaining the amplification of the 1.5-kbp fragment.",

These results convincingly demonstrate that the AcMNPV CNE essential activity is not mediated by any trans-factors encoded by it or by the CNE transactivity itself. Thus, the AcMNPV CNE can be defined as a sequence that includes an essential nfe, a genomic element whose non-coding content is directly involved in certain essential DNA transaction. The recovery of infectivity of the CNE-deficient virus by inserting the CNE into the heterologous genomic locus demonstrated that this nfe is a genomic element that plays an essential role in the AcMNPV life cycle independently of its genomic location. It should be emphasized that although the genomic segment containing the CNE together with its 19-bp 59proximal and 25-bp 39-proximal regions was sufficient for an essential nfe, the possible involvement of additional sequences adjacent to the CNE in modulating its essential activity cannot be excluded.",

The data from earlier studies of sequences spanning the AcMNPV CNE suggest that the CNE represents the conserved region of overlapping transcription, it operates as a transcriptional activator, and its DSs function as protein-binding motifs [56] [58] [60] . This study demonstrates that the AcMNPV CNE also includes some additional nfe absolutely required in the viral life cycle.

It is generally accepted that the expression activities of each of two closely spaced divergently transcribed genes may be interdependent, such that transcription from one promoter influences the transcription from other promoter [72] [73] . The detection of several genes (ncRNA genes and putative protein-coding gene) spanning the ie2-pe38 intergenic region [60] (Figure S4 ) strongly suggests that RNA interference [74] can also be involved in the regulation of both ie2 and pe38 expression. It should also be noted, that the ie2-pe38 intergenic region contains numerous binding sites for some proteins, the true and putative regulators of ie2 and pe38 promoter activities [56] [61] ( Figure S4 ). Taken together these facts these facts suggest the existence of a very complex regulatory mechanism driving the coordinated expression of ie2 and pe38. The AcMNPV CNE as a part of ie2-pe38 intergenic region includes three of the six protein-binding sites found in this region, and represents the conserved part of the overlapping genes ( Figure  S4 ). Transient expression assays aimed to investigate the effect of deletions in the 59 untranslated region of ie2 demonstrated that the sequence recognized as the CNE in this study appeared to be an upstream activator of the core ie2 promoter. However, as the CNE may be expected to play in concert with other regulatory elements of the ie2-pe38 intergenic region, its role in ie2-pe38 expression may be more complicated.",

            "text": "The detection of CNEs in all Alphabaculovirus genomes indicated a high probability that this new sequence plays an indispensable role in the Alphabaculovirus infection cycle. Transfection-infection assays showed an inability of the CNE-knockout AcMNPV-based bacmid to spread the infection, thereby providing experimental evidence of an essential role of the CNE in virus propagation. Regardless of whether the CNE regulates the activity of one or both immediately early promoters, this cis-regulatory activity would be expected to correlate with its essential role. However, further assays refuted the suggestion regarding the association of the essential role of the AcMNPV CNE with its cis-regulatory activity, as the CNE repair bacmid harboring CNE inserted into a heterologous region was shown to be infectious. Additionally, the complementation test demonstrated that an essential function of the AcMNPV CNE cannot be determined by the activity of any trans factors (ncRNAs or proteins) encoded by sequences that overlap the CNE. The conclusion regarding the existence of an additional DNA transaction performed by the CNE, which could not be assigned to the cis-regulation of the immediately early genes, was based on the aforementioned experiments, and this conclusion was consistent with the data available from two earlier studies. First, the evidence that the CNE is implicated in two temporally distinct processes arises from the observation of Krappa and co-workers [56] that, although the AcMNPV DSr and DSl bind proteins of cellular origin at an early stage of infection, the DSc-protein complex may be detected at 40 h p.i. (the protein partners of DSc are expected to be of viral origin because the cessation of host protein synthesis occurs at this time [75] ). In other words, the polyfunctional nature of the CNE can be considered to be a derivative of different specializations of the DSs composing it. Second, as the linearization of the ManeNPV genome mediated by the CNE sequence is unlikely to be attributed to the CNE transcriptional regulatory activity, it is logical to suggest that a DNA double-stranded ''break'' is associated with CNE involvement in some other DNA process related to the conversion of the ManeNPV genome form. However, it remains unclear whether this suggestion concerns only the ManeNPV CNE or whether it is applicable to the CNEs of other alphabaculoviruses. The analysis of some uncharacterized phenomena observed earlier by Oppenheimer and Volkman [76] suggests an answer to this question. The resolution of single-cut, nuclease-digested replicative intermediates of AcMNPV DNA by pulsed field electrophoresis demonstrated the existence of a short 14-kbp fragment in the pool of full-size genomes, which may be indicative of genomes with defined free ends. Oppenheimer and Volkman reported that the mapping of a 14-kbp fragment terminus resulted in the identification of the genome locus corresponding to the ie2 -pe38 intergenic spacer, i.e., the linearization site of the AcMNPV genome was localized to the aforementioned region. The comparison of the location of the AcMNPV ie2-pe38 intergenic region (132083-132526) to that of the AcMNPV CNE (132228-132383) led to the finding that the AcMNPV CNE is enclosed within this region. Although the position of the linearization site in the AcMNPV ie2-pe38 intergenic region was not precisely determined by the authors of the work, the location of the linearization site within the ManeNPV CNE strongly suggests that the analogous site may be a requisite of the AcMNPV CNE. Thus, the conversion of the genome form associated with the CNE may be a feature shared by alphabaculoviruses. It can be assumed that the specificity of the ManeNPV-Anpe cell system is most likely not attributable to the generation of DNA linear forms but rather to the abnormal accumulation of these forms to easily detectable levels during ManeNPV DNA propagation in Anpe cells. The implication of the ManeNPV CNE in genome form conversion allows the hypothesis that this element may be involved in process associated with DNA replication and/or recombination and/or cleavage because these transactions should inevitably result in short-lived linear intermediate genomes. The localization of the linearization site in the AcMNPV genome is required to determine whether this hypothesis can be extended to the AcMNPV CNE.",

Accordingly, there is a high probability that the regions of extended homology between the non-coding sequences of representatives of same taxonomic group are merely a result of background conservation caused by the short evolutionary distances between the compared species. However, this is not the case with the Alphabaculovirus CNE, as may be deduced from the following. As protein-coding sequences are under strong evolutionary constraint, the average level of amino acid identity between proteins shared by two genomes appears to be a robust measure of the whole-genome level of relatedness between the species being compared. This level of identity was found to be relatively low for particular pairs of Alphabaculovirus species, exemplified by HearSNPVG4-BmNPV and LyxyMNPV-AcMNPV, which exhibit 41% and 33% amino acid identity, respectively [77] [44] . In addition, a high variability in GC content and gene number (ranging from 118 to 169 genes) across Alphabaculovirus genomes, a relatively low proportion of homologous genes shared by all alphabaculoviruses (among them are 37 core and 14 Alphabaculovirus-specific genes) compared to the entire gene content of each genome [9] , and a large number of rearrangements in the genomes of particular alphabaculoviruses [78] suggest that the Alphabaculovirus genus includes highly diverged species. Therefore, background conservation is not expected to be significant between the CNEs of distantly related alphabaculoviruses. The detection of highly variable regions along the CNE consensus sequence (Figure 2 ) is in accordance with the above conclusion.",

            "text": "The recognition of a CNE in the genomes of distantly related species on the basis of the primary structure makes the CNE different from other baculovirus nfes, promoters, non-hr oris, and hrs. A/G/TTAAG and CAGT motifs are highly conserved transcriptional initiators of late and early baculoviral promoters respectively [79] [80] , however the overall nucleotide sequences of baculoviral promoters are variable even between orthologous genes of quite closely related viruses. Non-hr oris share common elements (repeated sequences, AT-rich regions, and recognition motifs for transcription factors) but do not exhibit a tendency of sequence conservation between Alphabaculovirus species [16] [17] [18] . All baculoviral hrs consist of similar building blocks represented by stretches of direct repeats centered by palindromic sequence [7] [21] [10] , with only short core palindromes exhibiting homology when the hrs of distantly related alphabaculoviruses are compared [34] . Similar to baculoviral hrs, many of the diverse viral non-coding functional elements exemplified by the herpesvirus packaging signal [81] , coronavirus packaging signal [82] , and poxvirus signal of DNA concatamer resolution [83] are represented by evolutionary conserved short single sequence motifs (regions of structural significance or binding sites for enzymes) embedded in sequences, with their lengths and nucleotide contents varying widely among the members of a virus family. In the genomes of some viruses, diverse nfes are concentrated within specifically organized regions; consequently, short conserved motifs that specify different elements may be found in close proximity to each other in those regions. The most prominent examples of such polyfunctional regions include the following: retroviral LTRs (long terminal repeats), which appear to be highly conserved with regard to the composition and arrangement of short conserved motifs (i.e., identifiers of the integration signal, signal of transcription regulation, and signal of RNA processing) but are not conserved with regard to the length and overall nucleotide sequence [84] ; and the Alphapapillomavirus LCRs (long control regions) of variable length, which share numerous short sequence motifs (identifiers of ori and cisregulatory elements) but do not exhibit long stretches of sequence similarity when different alphapapillomavirus types are aligned [85] . The distinct protein recognition motifs grouped together within the limited genomic region may also specify a single functional unit in the genomes of certain viruses, e.g., the attP sites of some phages (sequences that are engaged in the process of phage genome integration into the host chromosome) consisting of recombinase recognition motif(s) supplemented with recognition motif(s) for accessory proteins [86] . Accordingly, the CNE can be regarded as a sequence that consists of several conserved motifs arranged in a certain order relative to each other that does not appear to be extraordinary compared to known viral nfes and known polyfunctional genomic regions consisting of several nfes. However, to my knowledge, there is neither a known viral nfe nor a known viral genomic region composed of several nfes that exhibits an evolutionary tendency toward preservation of both overall sequence length and motif composition and arrangement. Thus, the location of several closely spaced, conserved motifs at strictly conserved positions along the CNE length, which determines the strictly fixed length of the CNE and its easy recognition on the basis of the overall sequence homology, makes the CNE unique among the known viral nfes.",

            "text": "It is well established that the target motifs of many DNAbinding proteins exhibit nucleotide variability and the conserved nucleotides of such slightly mismatched motifs were shown to constitute the loci of direct DNA-protein interactions [87] . Taking into account the established roles of AcMNPV DSs as proteinbinding sites, the core arms of DSs (hexameric IRs, requisite of both DSl and DSr, and nanomeric IRs, requisite of DSc) appear to be good candidates for the degenerate motifs directly involved in the binding of two identical cooperatively acting proteins or, alternatively, in the binding of homodimeric protein subunits. The resemblance between the left arm of the DSc (GtAGACTaT) and the conserved nucleotide cluster 2 (gTAgTaTAT), as demonstrated by the CNE consensus (Figure 2A) , suggests that the latter may represent a third degenerate motif for the binding of the DScassociated protein. It also appears reasonable to suggest that the TAT conservation at two additional positions along the CNE length may also reflect this triplet embedded in the motif for the binding of the above-mentioned protein. A comparative analysis of the TAT-containing 9-bp sequences found at all 5 positions (including the complement of the right DSc arm) using the WebLogo tool failed to identify significantly conserved nucleotides, except for TAT (data not shown). This result, however, may be considered to be in agreement with the hypothesis that TAT-containing sequences may represent a variable motif similar to the highly degenerate protein-binding motifs frequently found in the genomes of different origins [88] [89] and in viral genomes in particular. Some examples include some bacteriophages attPs, which enclose the target site for a site-specific recombinase, clustered with the additional multiple degenerate binding sites for recombinase and/or for accessory proteins [86] [90] [91] and the Epstein-Barr virus ori P, which contains 26 18-bp motifs that are slightly variable with regard to their nucleotide composition and affinity for the EBNA1 initiator protein [92] .",

It is now widely recognized that DSs (palindromes) appear to be the major participants in many biological processes, and their functions are often associated with their capacity for intra-strand base-pairing, which results in the formation of alternative DNA structures called hairpins (if one DNA strand is engaged in the process) and cruciforms (if both strands participate in the process) [93] . Hairpins also represent the dominant secondary structure element in many RNAs, where they define nucleation sites for folding, determine tertiary interactions in RNA enzymes, protect mRNAs from degradation, and are recognized by RNA-binding proteins [94] . The CNE DSs exhibit an evolutionary tendency toward the preservation of a palindromic structure despite the turnover of the nucleotides framing the core DSs ( Figure S5 ). This tendency suggests that the CNE is a type of sequence that is potentially capable of structural transitions, and, consequently, the conservation of both DSs and TAT-containing sequences may reflect the role of these sequences in cruciform/hairpin extrusion and/or maintenance in DNA and/or RNA. The AT-rich sequences were shown to facilitate DNA structural transitions as they have the common feature of being easily unwound [95] [96] [97] . Accordingly, the correlation between the CNE extrusion capacity and the high AT content of the CNE may be expected.",

First, DH10B cells containing bMON14272 and DH10B cells containing vAc EGFP were transfected with pKD46, a plasmid carrying the genes involved in the production of recombination-stimulating factors. A CAT cassette with the CNE-flanking regions was amplified using the primers 27-(59-ACGACTGATAAGACAATA GTGGT-fGGGGGAACTTGCCAGGCAATTTCACCAGCGTTTCTG-G-39) and 28-(59-GGGGG ACAGATAACAGAAACTGCAG-CCTGTGATATGATAAATAAGGGCACCAATAACTGC-39) with pBR325 as the template. These primers contained 42 and 41 bp (underlined) homologous to the CNE-flanking regions. The amplified fragment was electroporated into DH10B cells harboring bMON14272 or vAc EGFP together with pKD46. The electroporated cells were incubated at 37uC for 4 h in 1 ml of SOC medium and plated on agar medium containing 8 mg of chloramphenicol and 50 mg of kanamycin per ml. The plates were incubated at 37uC overnight, and the colonies resistant to the antibiotics were selected. The primers 7-(59-CGGAATTCGGCTGGGCTGGTAGGAT-39) and 8-(59-CGGATCCTTTGCTTATTGGCAGGC-39) were used for a PCR-based test to confirm the insertion of the CAT gene into the CNE locus.

The DpnI-treated DNA was ethanol-precipitated, dissolved in water, and subjected to a PCR-based analysis.

            "text": "A transfection/infection assay was performed to assess whether the virus infection cycle was affected by the CNE deletion and whether CNE activity was dependent on the CNE position within the AcMNPV genome. Semi-confluent monolayers of Sf9 cells were transfected with each of three bacmids, vAcEGFP  , vAc CNE-KO-EGFP , or Ac CNE-KO-REP-EGFP , and the transfected cells were examined using fluorescence microscopy at different times posttransfection (p.t.) to follow the development of the infection process. Similar transfection efficiencies were achieved, as approximately 20% of the fluorescent cells were detected in each monolayer at 48 h p.t., irrespective of the transfected bacmid. Further observation revealed that the number of fluorescent cells in the vAc CNE-KO-EGFP -transfected monolayers remained unaltered at 96 h p.t., whereas nearly 100% of the cells emitted fluorescence in the vAc EGFP -and vAc CNE-KO-REP-EGFP -transfected monolayers at this time point (Figure 4A). The cells were then incubated for up to 3 days, and fluorescence monitoring was performed daily. No increase in the amount of cells emitting green light in the vAc CNE-KO-EGFP -transfected monolayers was observed during this time, clearly reflecting the inability of the CNEdeficient DNA to generate infectious virus particles capable of spreading the infection from the initially transfected cells. In contrast, the increase in the number of fluorescent cells in the vAc CNE-KO-REP-EGFP -transfected monolayers up to 96 h p.t. undoubtedly suggested virus transmission from cell to cell. To confirm the obtained results, fresh Sf9 cell monolayers were inoculated with supernatants harvested from the transfected cells. The subsequent fluorescence-based monitoring of the infection process revealed an absence of egfp-expressing cells in the monolayers incubated with the vAc CNE-KO-EGFP supernatants at any time point post-inoculation (p.i.) and an increase in the number of egfp-positive cells up to 96 h p.i. in the monolayers incubated with the vAc EGFP and vAc CNE-KO-REP-EGFP supernatants, results that are consistent with the data from the transfection assay.The transfection/infection assay data clearly demonstrated the inability of vAc CNE-KO-EGFP to spread the infection. Regardless, these data were not considered as sufficient to postulate the infectious nature of vAc CNE-KO-REP-EGFP due to the following reason. Because the CNE-containing fragment replaced by CAT in the vAc CNE-KO-REP-EGFP genome is 29 bp shorter than the CNEcontaining fragment inserted into the ph locus, identical 14-and 15-bp sequences flank both the transposed CAT and the CNE located within the heterologous locus. Due to the recombinogenic nature of baculovirus DNA[70] [71], identity between the sequences flanking both inserts could be considered a prerequisite for the generation of recombinant genomes in which the CNE would be reinserted in its original position by homologous recombination. Although 14-and 15-bp flanking sequences appear to be too short to provide efficient genome fragment exchange, the low-frequency occurrence of recombinant genomes during viral replication in cell culture cannot be absolutely excluded. Thus, to assess whether the infectious virus harvested from vAc CNE-KO-REP-EGFP -transfected cells was not a recombinant virus carrying the CNE in its original position, PCR-based analyses of the viral DNA were performed. Primers 7 and 8 (see Materials and Methods), located upstream and downstream of the CAT insert, respectively(Figure 3), were used in the reaction. Only a 1.4-kb fragment, indicative of the originally constructed vAc CNE-KO-REP-EGFP genome, was amplified from the viral DNA template extracted from both the vAc CNE-KO-REP-EGFP -transfected cells and the cells inoculated with the corresponding supernatant",

The recombinant genomes were derived from the Escherichia coli system for bacmid bMON14272. An egfp-producing virus (vAc EGFP ) resulted from the insertion of a gentamicin-resistant gene (Gm)-enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (egfp) cassette into the polyhedrin (ph) locus of bMON14272 via transposon-mediated recombination using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The egfp-expressing CNE-and gp64-knockout bacmids, vAc CNE-KO-EGFP and vAc GP64-KO-EGFP , respectively, were constructed by replacing the CNE or gp64 in vAc EGFP with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (CAT) PCR cassette using the l Red recombination system (see Methods for the PCR primers used). The same technique was used to generate a CNE-knockout virus lacking egfp (vAc CNE-KO ) from bMON14272. vAc CNE-KO was used as an intermediate construct for the generation of the egfp-expressing CNE-repair virus (vAC CNE-KO-EGFP-REP ) by the site-specific transposition of the Gm-egfp-CNE cassette into the ph locus using the Bac-to-Bac system.
