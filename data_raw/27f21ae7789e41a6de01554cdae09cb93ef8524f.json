Twenty-one out of 100 cats were found to have serum antibodies (Ab) against FmoPV-N protein by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IF) using FmoPV-N protein-expressing HeLa cells. Twenty-two of the cats were positive for FmoPV RNA in the urine and/or renal tissues. In total, 29 cats were positive for Ab and/or viral RNA. These FmoPV-infected cats were classified into three different phases of infection: RNA+/Ab + (14 cats), RNA+/Ab-(8 cats) and RNA-/Ab + (7 cats). In immunohistochemistry (IHC), 19 out of 29 cats were positive for FmoPV-N protein in kidney tissues; however, the FmoPV-N protein was located in the inflammatory lesions with severe grade in only four out of the 19 cats. Since 15 out of 29 infected cats were positive for viral RNA and Ab, approximately half of the infected cats were persistently infected with FmoPV.",

FmoPV is genetically most closely related to viruses such as canine distemper virus (CDV), measles virus (MV), rinderpest virus (RPV), peste-des-petits-ruminants virus (PPRV), phocine distemper virus (PDV) and cetacean morbillivirus (CMV), belonging to the genus morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . FmoPV showed genetic diversity among isolates [3] [4] [5] , and a natural recombination in the envelope protein region between viruses in different clades was also found [4] . In Germany, three groups of feline paramyxoviruses (FPaV) have been detected, and these were associated with feline chronic kidney diseases (CKD) including lower urinary tract diseases (LUTD) [5] . Phylogenetically, the first group of these viruses belongs to the same cluster of FmoPV with 99 % homology, whereas the second group represents a new cluster between FmoPV and other morbilliviruses. The third group represents a group that is distinct from FmoPV and other morbilliviruses. A seroepidemiological survey of CDV infection in Asian countries showed that domestic cats were susceptible to CDV infection, but CDV was not virulent in domestic cats [9] . At the moment, it is not yet confirmed that FmoPV is classified in the genus morbillivirus or in a novel genus separate from the genus morbillivirus.",

It can be divided into acute kidney disease (AKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), or inherent kidney disease and acquired kidney disease [10] [11] [12] [13] . AKD, which could be caused by toxins, trauma, infection, shock, blockage of the blood flow and heart failure [11] , is reversible and can affect cats of all ages. CKD affects domestic cats, especially middle-aged or older cats [14] , and its prevalence increases according to age, affecting up to half of cats older than 15 years [14] . CKD could result from infection, blockages, dental disease, high blood pressure and cancer. In particular, idiopathic CKD such as pyelonephritis, glomerulonephritis and chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) due to unknown causes has been reported extensively [10, 11, [15] [16] [17] . It is suspected that FmoPV is one of the causative agents of CKD [1, 5] , such as chronic TIN. Therefore, it is important to clarify the characteristics or the pathogenicity of FmoPV and the pathogenesis in domestic cats as the natural host. In this respect, large-scale epidemiological investigation is considered to be indispensable.",

Phylogenetic analysis of the FmoPV detected in Japan showed FmoPV was clustered in three groups. However, a phylogenetic relationship with geographic distribution of FmoPV in Japan and Hong Kong was not observed. Further, a significant relationship between FmoPV cluster and renal disease in the cat was not observed (data not shown). It is, however, necessary to compare the FmoPV sequences in cats from other regions in future to confirm this hypothesis. Recently, several partial sequences of FmoPV detected in cats in Germany were reported [5] , however, we could not compare our data with them because the region of the sequences were not overlapped. RNAs and proteins of FmoPV were detected in cat urine, sera and/or renal tissues. Anti-FmoPV Abs were also demonstrated in cat sera. FmoPV-infected cats in the present study were divided into three groups: RNA +/Ab+, RNA+/Ab-and RNA-/Ab+. Cats in the RNA +/Ab-group were considered to be in an acute phase of FmoPV infection. Cats in the RNA+/Ab + group were considered to be in either a subacute or a chronic phase of the infection. Since it is not confirmed that the nested R-PCR used in the present study detected all the FmoPV strains because of the genetic diversity of the viruses, thus it is possible that there are some false negative results in the RT-PCR. Since humoral immune response in addition to cellular immune response to the virus are thought to eliminate the virus from animals, cats in the RNA-/Ab + group were considered to be in a convalescent phase. Consequently, it appears that FmoPV could establish as an acute, subacute or chronic infection, and could be eliminated. Additionally, there were cases in which RNA of FmoPV was negative in urine but positive in renal tissues. Since approximately half of the infected cats (14 out of the 29 infected cats) were positive for viral RNA and Ab, it seems likely that cats are easily chronically or persistently infected with the virus. However, further long-term follow-up studies in FmoPVinfected cats are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.",

No relationships among the clinical data, except age and sex, with the infection by FmoPV could be found. The infection rate of FmoPV was significantly high in unneutered male cats (P < 0.005) in this study (Fig. 6) . These tendencies could be due to differences of behavior patterns, such as more aggressive or active behavior in unneutered male cats than neutered male cats and female cats, and such behavior might result in an increase in opportunity of infection with FmoPV from other infected cats. The transmission of FmoPV between cats could occur in veterinary hospitals, boarding In a pathological examination, 25 out of 29 infected cats had renal lesions, from mild mononuclear cell infiltration to chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. Half of them were mediate to severe cases. As a result of IHC, 19 out of 29 cats showed FmoPV-N protein in their kidney tissues. Four of the 19 cats showed severe lesions with FmoPV-N protein in the inflammatory lesions. The FmoPV-N protein-positive cells were identified to be renal tubular epithelial cells in the renal cortex, medulla and pelvis. FmoPV-N protein-positive mononuclear cells could not be found in this study, different from a report in Hong Kong [1] . These cases had RNA of FmoPV both in urine and renal tissues and relatively high IgG titer of 1: 640 to 20,480, except one case, representing the chronic phase. However, the IHC-positive sites were focally located, not distributed widely in the lesions.",

No statistically significant correlations were found between the grades of lesions and the infection of FmoPV. However, a statistically significant relationship with the presence of inflammatory lesions and the infection of FmoPV was found, regardless of TIN. Consequently, no meaningful direct relationship between infection by FmoPV and chronic TIN was confirmed in this study. It might be plausible that FmoPV antigens in the lesions were already eliminated by host immune responses in the case of severe chronic TIN. A similar phenomenon was reported in other virus infectious diseases such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by hantavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [19, 20] . In these cases, uncontrolled responses in cytokines and chemokines are considered to be responsible for the pathogenesis. In this regard, it would be necessary to analyze innate immune responses in cats with FmoPV.",

The purified RT-PCR amplicons were used as templates for sequencing on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) with the first and second PCR primers. Phylogenetic analysis was performed according to previous reports [4, 33, 34] . Briefly, phylograms were constructed using with the maximum likelihood method with the Kimura two-parameter model included in the MEGA6 package. The robustness of the resulting branching patterns was tested using the bootstrap method with 1000 replicates. In the analysis, the sequences of FmoPV (Hong Kong : M252A, 761U and 776U, Japan : SS1, OtJP001, MiJP003 and ChJP073, outgroups : CDV-Acc.No. AB476401.1 and Nipah virus-Acc.No. JN808863.1) deposited in the GenBank were included in the analysis. To support the result of phylogenetic tree, pairwise distances were analyzed by MEGA6 package and a distribution of pairwise distances was represented by histogram [18] . Statistically significant differences were calculated by Welch's t test.",

Infected Tn5 cells were harvested at 3 days post-infection and his-tagged FmoPV-N protein was purified by Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and His-Bind\u00ae buffer kit (Novagen, San Diego, CA, USA). Purity of the purified FmoPV-N protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Bio-Safe TM Coomassie G-250 stain, Bio-Rad, CA, USA). Stained bands were quantified using ImageJ 1.50i [39, 40] . The purified FmoPV-N protein was subcutaneously injected into three rabbits five times.
