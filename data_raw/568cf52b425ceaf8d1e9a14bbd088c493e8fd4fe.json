The general correlation between base composition and codon usage bias suggests that mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in those polioviruses. Depending on the RSCU data, it was found that there was a significant variation in bias of codon usage among three genotypes. Geographic factor also has some effect on the codon usage pattern (exists in the genotype-1 of polioviruses). No significant effect in gene length or vaccine derived polioviruses (DVPVs), wild viruses and live attenuated virus was observed on the variations of synonymous codon usage in the virus genes. The relative abundance of dinucleotide (CpG) in the ORFs of polioviruses are far below expected values especially in DVPVs and attenuated virus of polioviruses genotype 1. Conclusion: The information from this study may not only have theoretical value in understanding poliovirus evolution, especially for DVPVs genotype 1, but also have potential value for the development of poliovirus vaccines.",

As an important evolutionary phenomenon, it is well known that synonymous codon usage bias exists in a wide range of biological systems from prokaryotes to eukaryotes [4, 5] . Codon usage analysis has been applied to prokaryote and eukaryote, such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and human beings [6] [7] [8] . These observed patterns in synonymous codon usage varied among genes within a genome, and among genomes. The codon usage is attributable to the equilibrium between natural selection and mutation pressure [9, 10] . Recent studies of viral codon usage has shown that mutation bias may be a more important factor than natural selection in determining codon usage bias of some viruses, such as Picornaviridae, Pestivirus, plant viruses, and vertebrate DNA viruses [9, [11] [12] [13] . Meanwhile, recent report also showed that the G+C compositional constraint is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in iridovirus genomes [11, 14] . Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution or individual genes of the viruses.",

However, the A have no correlation with A 3 , G 3 and C 3 , and U have no correlation with A 3 (Table 4 ).

The significant correlation was found between nucleotide compositions and synonymous codon usage to some extent excluding Axis 1 and the value of A ( Table 4 ). The analysis revealed that most of the codon usage bias among ORFs of polioviruses strains was directly related to the base composition. Finally, the ENC-plot [ENC plotted against (G+C) 3 %] was used as a part of general strategy to investigate patterns of synonymous codon usage and all of the spots lie below the expected curve (Figure 1 ).

Specifically, after accounting for dinucleotide biases, the proportion of codon usage bias explained by mutation pressure often increases, as seen in human RNA viruses [25] . Our study revealed that CpG and the eight CpG-containing codons are notably deficient in ORFs of 48 poliovirus genomes. The explanation for the CpG deficiency is immunologic escape. A high CpG content may be detrimental to small DNA (or RNA) viruses, as unmethylated CpGs are recognized by the host's innate immune system (Toll-like receptor 9) as a pathogen signature [32] . As with vertebrate genomes, methylated viral genomes would face a high chance of mutation at CpGs, that would result in a reduction of this dinucleotide [9, 33] . We found that DVPVs and live attenuated virus of genotype 1 have lower frequencies of CpG dinucleotide compare with wild viruses of polioviruses genotype 1. The most popular explanation for lower frequencies of CpG in ORFs of DVPV genomes is that when OPV viruses turning into VDPV genotype 1, a lower frequencies of CpG dinucleotide maybe help VDPV out of the host immunity.",
