Beginning in 2008, we conducted in-hospital follow-up for SARI patients to determine outcome. Specimens were tested by real time RT-PCR for influenza A and B. Influenza A-positive specimens were subtyped for H1, H3, H5, and (beginning in May 2009) A(H1N1)pdm09.",

In all, 2,378 (9.6%) SARI cases and 2,041 (14.6%) ILI cases were positive for influenza viruses. Most influenza-associated SARI cases (58.6%) were in children ,2 years old. Of all influenza-positive specimens, 78% were influenza A, 21% were influenza B, and 1% were influenza A/B coinfections. Influenza circulated in every month. In four of the six years influenza activity peaked during July-November. Of 9,419 SARI patients, 2.7% died; the median length of hospitalization was 4 days.",

We used Pearson's chi square test to compare demographic and clinical variables between SARI and ILI patients. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios in bi-variate and multivariate analyses comparing influenza-positive and influenza-negative ILI patients, and influenza-positive and influenza-negative SARI patients. We used generalized linear models (GLM) to estimate relative risk when comparing fatal and non-fatal cases. Multivariable logistic regression and GLM models were constructed using factors that were significant at p,0.2 in the bi-variate analysis. SARI patients ,5 years old and those $5 years old were analyzed separately because different case definitions were used for the two age groups.

Overall, 90% of SARI samples and 87% of ILI samples were collected from children ,5 years ( Table 1 ).

Young children ,2 years old could be a logical initial target population if a nationwide influenza immunization program is implemented in the future. Maternal immunization could also be considered to protect infants ,6 months old [20] . Additionally, we found that nearly one-sixth of all influenza-associated SARI patients had been hospitalized in the previous 12 months, a trend that has also been documented in studies in the United States [21] . We observed this same trend among influenza-negative SARI patients. Hospitalized patients, although a much smaller population, could also be a costeffective target for vaccination in Kenya if more influenza vaccine were to become available in the country. Although we conducted surveillance over six years, a relatively robust time period to detect seasonal trends, we were not able to detect a consistent, discrete seasonality to influenza activity in Kenya. However, in most years, influenza activity was most pronounced during July to November, a period of low precipitation, relatively lower temperatures, and variable humidity in Kenya [22, 23] , and activity was minimal during December and January, which tend to be the warmest months of the year in Kenya [22] . This same seasonal influenza pattern has been described in neighboring Uganda [24] . However, in Kenya, influenza circulated year-round and was detected during a minimum of ten months per year throughout the six year period. In some years, like 2011, influenza also circulated early in the year, during a period typical of high temperatures and heavy rains.",

In addition, information about the concordance between circulating strains in Kenya and southern and northern hemisphere vaccine strains, which is being evaluated in a separate analysis, will be essential to this recommendation. In Kenya, influenza types and subtypes co-circulated through the six years of surveillance.

Of the nearly 10,000 hospitalized SARI patients we followed, 0.9% of the 754 influenza-positive SARI patients died. This case-fatality ratio for influenza-associated hospitalizations is substantial. It is higher than estimates of in-hospital case-mortality rates for children in the United States [27] and Thailand [3] , although it is lower than rates recently reported for seasonal and pandemic influenza in India [28] . This may reflect a difference in underlying chronic illness or acute conditions, such as HIV or malaria, which we did not routinely test for in SARI or ILI patients. In our surveillance population, the median age was very young (16 months), and the median age of patients who died was 2 years old; this contrasts with the findings from the studies in Thailand and India, where most patients who died were adults, and many were older than 50. While there were not any reports of patients who refused to be consented, it is possible that sicker patients, particularly those who died in the hospital, were not enrolled. If sick patients came into the hospital in the evening or on weekends and died in the hospital before the next weekday morning, we would not have captured them in our surveillance system. Additionally, we would have missed patients who died shortly after arriving in the hospital, before even being admitted to a hospital ward. Therefore the CFRs we report for SARI in general and influenza-associated SARI may be under-estimates. The estimated CFR should not have been affected by the surveillance project at the hospital; surveillance officers evaluated patients on admission but were not involved in patient management.",

            "text": "Less than 3% of SARI patients we captured were adults; while this may reflect a lower burden of severe influenza in adults in Kenya, it likely reflects a component of relatively lower health clinic utilization in this age group [29, 30] . This disparity may also reflect the requirement of measured fever in the case definition of SARI in patients .5 years old; a recently published longitudinal cohort study in England showed that only a minority of people with PCR-confirmed influenza had fever with a temperature greater than 37.8uC [31] . Finally, the difference may reflect a possible sampling bias in our surveillance system; surveillance officers may have preferentially captured children in pediatric wards, although they were instructed to routinely survey all wards. In our surveillance system in Kenya, the median duration of hospitalization was 4 days for influenza-positive patients. This length of stay is similar to results from studies in the United States, India and Thailand [3, 27, 28] .",

            "text": "Our findings are subject to several limitations. First, the case definition for SARI was different for children ,5 years old and persons $5 years old, which limited our ability to compare SARI patients across age groups. In addition, we know from previous studies in Kenya that the SARI case definition does not capture all influenza cases [17, 32] ; therefore we likely missed some hospital-ized influenza cases. Second, we only sampled the first three ILI patients of the day. This could have biased our ILI findings towards sicker patients or patients who lived closer to the health facilities and arrived at the clinic earlier. We did not collect data regarding non-enrolled ILI patients, which would have helped us to better understand how representative sampled ILI patients were of all ILI patients. Furthermore, our surveillance system did not include specialty wards like obstetrics; therefore we were not able to collect data on the relative burden of influenza among pregnant women, a priority group for vaccination [33] . Given that pregnant women can transfer protective antibodies to infants, for whom no influenza vaccine is currently available [20] , future surveillance in Kenya should monitor pregnant women. In addition, for the last 18 months, because of budgetary constraints, we scaled back our surveillance to include only nine hospitals, all but two of which conducted SARI surveillance only. Therefore, results for this period were likely not as nationally representative compared to the previous results. This change to a more limited surveillance system reflects the sustainability challenges of conducting surveillance, particularly in resource-poor settings. Finally, our surveillance system was facility-based rather than population-based. Because we were not able to determine catchment areas for each site, and because health utilization practices vary considerably in different parts of Kenya [29, 30] , we were not able to determine the overall incidence of influenza in the population. We were also not able to determine the relative hospital burden of influenza because we did not collect data on overall admissions.",
