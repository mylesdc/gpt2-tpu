Inspite of large scale morbidity, with long lasting polyarthralgia, so far no licensed vaccine or antiviral is available. CHIKV nsP2 protease is crucial for processing of viral nonstructural polypeptide precursor to release enzymes required for viral replication, thus making it a promising drug target. In this study, high cell density cultivation (HCDC) of Escherichia coli in batch process was carried out to produce rCHIKV nsP2pro in a cost-effective manner. The purified nsP2pro and fluorogenic peptide substrate have been adapted for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based high throughput screening (HTS) assay with Z' value and CV of 0.67 \u00b1 0.054 and <10% respectively. We used this cell free HTS system to screen panel of metal ions and its conjugate which revealed zinc acetate as a potential candidate, which was further found to inhibit CHIKV in Vero cells. Scale-up process has not been previously reported for any of the arboviral nonstructural enzymes. The successful scale-up method for viral protease together with a HTS assay could lead to the development of industrial level large-scale screening platform for identification of protease inhibitors against emerging and re-emerging viruses.",

The incursion of African genotype into Asia and Asian genotype into Americas led to massive unprecedented outbreaks in na\u00efve population 2,3 .

The nsP2pro domain is responsible for cytoplasmic cleavages of polypeptide nsP123/1234 at junctions between nsP1/nsP2, nsP2/nsP3, and nsP3/nsP4 (AGA/GII, AGC/APS and AGG/YIF respectively) 9, 10 . Thus, the pivotal role of nsP2pro in CHIKV replication makes it a potential antiviral target, as disruption of protease activity is lethal for virus. Inhibition of viral protease has already been successfully exploited for development of antiviral compounds against Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus [11] [12] [13] . These successes have generated immense interest for development of protease inhibitors against other viral infections.",

The purified CHIKV nsP2pro amplicon was cloned in pET41a vector in frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and 6xHis at N-terminal, under T7 promoter. Screening of selected clones by sequencing revealed correct reading frame. SDS-PAGE analysis of the expressed protein on induction with 1 mM IPTG, showed expression of ~71 kDa CHIKV nsP2pro fusion protein with a dual (His 6 -GST) affinity tag. According to the densitometric analysis of bands on SDS-PAGE gel, under standard induction conditions (37 \u00b0C, 1 mM IPTG, 4 h), the recombinant CHIKV nsP2pro was found mainly in insoluble inclusion bodies (~80%), whereas, a very small fraction of protein remained in soluble form (~20%). Optimization of inducer concentration, temperature and induction time (18 \u00b0C, 0.5 mM IPTG, overnight) resulted in higher expression level of soluble CHIKV nsP2pro (~75%).",

The recombinant fusion protein showed the affinity to react with all three antibodies and a specific band of ~71 kDa representing recombinant CHIKV nsP2pro fusion protein was detected. To monitor the proper enterokinase cleavage of the fusion protein, the immuno-reactivity of the cleaved fraction was also confirmed by western blot analysis using anti-nsP2 polyclonal antibody with a band size of ~39 kDa.

Thus, for batch cultivation, cells were propagated in 2XLB broth supplemented with 1% glycerol and at an OD 600 of 20, the culture was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG. In batch run, during the growth period, the dissolved oxygen (DO) level was maintained at >20% using agitation speed up to 600 rpm and air flow rate was maintained at 4-9 L/min along with supplying pure oxygen whenever it was required. Initially, DO level was >30% and it started declining during the course of growth of cells. Figure 1a -c shows the growth profile of the batch fermentation process. This study yielded ~22 g/L (>100 g/batch) of wet cell paste that was frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C till further use.

Initially, we used fluorescence intensity (FI) based tripeptide substrates, t-butyl-oxycarbonyl-Ala-Gly-Gly-7-methoxycoumarin-4-acetyl (Boc-AGC-MCA) and t-butyl-oxycarbonyl-Ala-Gly-Gly-7amino-4-methylcoumarin (Boc-AGC-AMC) for the trans-proteolytic activity assay of CHIKV nsP2pro. Although, fluorescence unit of test reaction with these substrate were found higher than the background signal but a proper enzyme curve with time was not obtained ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Subsequently, a highly sensitive FRET-based octapeptide substrate (DABCYL-Arg-Ala-Gly-Gly-Tyr-Ile-Phe-Ser-(Glu-EDANS)-NH 2 ) was used for determining the activity of CHIKV nsP2protease. The active CHIKV nsP2protease exhibits the efficient cleavage of the substrate peptide, which separates fluorophore, 5-[(2-aminoethyl) amino] naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (EDANS) and quencher, 4-[(4-(dimethylamino) phenyl-azo] benzoic acid (DABCYL) resulting in the increased fluorescence signal. Fluorescence profile for the hydrolysis of the FRET-based substrate with time is depicted in Fig. 2a . A control reaction was also performed using the same reaction without enzyme, which did not show change in the fluorescence intensity. Finally, experiments were carried out to estimate kinetic parameters of CHIKV nsP2pro by carrying out assay with increasing substrate concentration (Fig. 2b) . Enzyme kinetic constant K m and V max derived were 0.98 \u00b1 0.135 \u00b5M and 0.77 \u00b1 0.024 \u00b5M min \u22121 respectively (Fig. 2c) . Therefore, a proper reaction velocity saturation curve was obtained using longer FRET-based peptide substrate. Further, purified mutated C478A CHIKV nsP2pro was used as a negative control. C478A CHIKV nsP2pro was not able to cleave the substrate efficiently indicating that the C478 is crucial for nsP2pro activity. (Supplementary Fig. S3 ).",

The optimal temperature for protease activity was found to be 22-28 \u00b0C (Fig. 3b) . The effect of glycerol (anti-chaotropic agent) was also observed. At 10-20% glycerol concentration slight increase in protease activity was seen. However, further increase in glycerol concentration resulted in the decrease of protease activity (Fig. 3c) . The results with different Na + concentrations indicated that the optimal concentration was around 50-100 mM and that the enzyme is relatively insensitive to Na + (Fig. 3d) . Effect of different divalent cations like Ca 2+ , Cd 2+ , Cu 2+ , Hg 2+ , Mg 2+ , Ni 2+ and Zn 2+ were studied on activity of nsP2pro. Although Mg 2+ or Ca 2+ did not affected protease activity however, Cu 2+ (p value = 0.0005), Zn 2+ (p value = 0.0002), and Hg 2+ (p value = 5.0 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ) decreased protease activity remarkably (Fig. 3e) . Further, the effect of different universal protease inhibitors was also tested. The enzyme was completely resistant to the inhibitors of serine proteases (PMSF, trypsin protease inhibitor I), aspartic proteases (pepstatin) and metalloproteases (EDTA). It was moderately inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitor (leupeptin; p value = 0.05) followed by chymostatin (p value = 0.008) (Fig. 3f ). The addition of sulfhydryl reagents such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; p value = 0.002) and methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS; p value = 7.1 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ), almost completely inhibited the protease activity of rCHIKV nsP2pro. Moreover, the addition of DTT or \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME), partially restored the enzyme activity inhibited by MMTS, indicating that Cys residue in the catalytic site of CHIKV nsP-2pro is important for the proteolytic activity (Fig. 3g ).",

Viral proteases are excellent target for development of antiviral therapeutics, due to their crucial role in viral polyprotein processing. Thus, as a pre-requisite for screening of small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) against CHIKV nsP2pro, we standardized large scale production of a soluble, catalytically active recombinant viral protease, with high yield and homogeneity in prokaryotic system. Further, we developed a reliable HTS assay with high sensitivity, selectivity and reproducibility to screen targeted compounds with anti-CHIKV nsP2 activity.",

The GST moiety of this vector increases the stability and solubility of the protein as well as act as a chaperone to facilitate protein folding 26, 27 . Typically, some nonbacterial proteins are produced in the form of insoluble inactive inclusion bodies, when overexpressed in E.coli.

No robust protocols for large scale production and purification of rCHIKV nsP2pro have been described so far. Therefore, HCDC batch fermentation was performed to produce large amount of biomass for purification of rCHIKV nsP2pro using 7 L volume bioreactor (with ~5 L working volume). The cultivation medium used for batch run was 2X LB with 1% glycerol. The components of the growth media are important for enhancement of product yield as well as reduction in by-product formations. Different cultivation medium like LB, TB and SB with some modifications were tried at small scale, results were satisfactory using simple 2XLB with 1% glycerol regarding overall yield of a bioactive enzyme. Glycerol reduces the acetate formation and also used as an antifoaming agent 28 . Final dry cell weight after the batch process was found to be increased more than 10 times when compared with that of the shake flask culture. This work yielded ~22 g/L of wet cell paste, which upon purification resulted in ~62 mg/L of GST-nsP2pro and 6 mg/L active untagged protease. The yield was superior to shake flasks and proved to be an efficient, easy to run, and inexpensive method for production of active protease. The enzymatic activity of rCHIKV nsP2pro was further characterized by using fluorescence substrate. Fluorescence-based approaches have been widely used in assays for proteases and other drug targets mainly because of their high sensitivity. For development of HTS assay two different approaches have been used to measure protease activity i.e., FI and FRET based. The success of FI based assays remained ambiguous for alphaviruses 16 , though this was reported successful for flaviviruses 29, 30 . In this study, Boc-AGG-MCA substrate was used in FI assay. Although, florescence unit of test reaction was found higher than the background signal but a proper enzyme curve with time was not obtained. Therefore, we tried similar type of substrates (Boc-AGG-AMC) with different fluorophore (AMC), but similar result was observed. Subsequently, FRET based substrate (DABCYL -RAGGYIFS-(E-EDANS)-NH 2 ) was used with success. FRET based substrate are reported to be superior than FI based substrate for characterization of endopeptidases due to its low background signal 24 . The cleavage site preference of the CHIKV nsP2pro enzyme is nsP3-nsP4 > nsP1-nsP2 > nsP2-nsP3 9 . Since nsP3-nsP4 substrate is preferred for cleavage in trans 31 , we used this in our study. Further, mutated protease, C478A CHIKV nsP2pro used as a negative control was not able to cleave the substrate efficiently indicating that the C478 is crucial for nsP2pro activity.",

Zinc and its conjugates have been proven effective for inhibiting SARS-CoV replication in vivo as identified by inhibition of viral proteases in a biochemical assay 34 . Thus, we were interested in testing the influence of metal conjugated compound on CHIKV nsP2 protease activity. We first examined the ZnAc in our biochemical assay, which inhibited protease similarly like Zn 2+ . As ZnAc is FDA approved drug and is already used as therapeutics in humans 35 , therefore we further tested the efficacy of ZnAc to inhibit CHIKV on Vero cells. Interestingly, it was found to significantly inhibit CHIKV titer by more than 3 log. The mechanism of action of ZnAc has been successfully reported for Wilson's disease, where it act on metallothionein, a family of cysteine-rich proteins 34 . Therefore, ZnAc might also inhibit the CHIKV cysteine protease in a similar manner. Further, docking studies showed that zinc has the highest possibility of binding to the catalytic dyad Cys and His at the active site. Similar zinc coordination sites are observed in the crystal structures of caspase-3 and mammalian NOS regulator dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase. In caspase-3, the residues Cys163 and His121 along with two water molecules stabilize the Zn ion in the active site 36 . In the structure of the mammalian NOS regulator dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase, the Cys273 and His172 along with two water molecules stabilize the Zn ion in the active site with Asp78 residue showing coordination with water molecules 37 .

Thus, a robust and sensitive method for identification of nsP2protease inhibitors in a HTS format was developed with the goal of identifying compounds with anti-CHIKV drug activity. We have optimized the signal window (S/B > 5) of the assay by determining the most favourable assay parameters such as pH, temperature, salt tolerance, assay buffer, assay stability and volume. Finally, the optimized assay was statistically validated for use in a FRET-based HTS biochemical assay for screening SMIs with low variability. Thus, a reliable and reproducible assay have been developed with Z'-factor 0.67 \u00b1 0.054 and intra-plate, inter-plate, day to day variability of CV < 10%. This platform provides an opportunity for identification of potent nsP2pro inhibitors for subsequent use as lead molecule, which would potentially provide drugs capable of treating CHIKV infection in the near future. Further, identification of zinc and its conjugate (ZnAc) as an inhibitor of CHIKV nsP2pro in this study provides an opportunity for repurposing of these kind of approved drugs and mineral supplements for antiviral therapy against CHIKV infection.",

Cells were then probed with primary antibody CHIKV E2 mAb 40 in 3% BSA/PBS and incubated for 30 min at RT followed by washing the cells thrice by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min with ice cold PBS. Further secondary antibody anti-mouse FITC in 3% BSA/PBS was added and incubated for 30 min at RT in the dark. Washing was repeated as above and cells were resuspended in ice cold 3% BSA/PBS and acquired by FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer and analyzed by CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences, USA).",

The donor EDANS (fluorophore) at C-terminal of octapeptide substrate produces the signal upon excitation that gets quenched by DABCYL (quencher) at N-terminal and thus shows FRET. In the presence of rCHIKV nsP2pro, the cleavage takes place and the EDANS and DABCYL gets separated from each other, which results in the reduction of FRET signal. Thus, control reaction with protease and substrate showed an increase in fluorescence unit (FU) with time (positive control, PC). A negative control (NC) reaction was also performed without enzyme, which did not showed change in the fluorescence intensity. In the presence of CHIKV nsP2pro inhibitors, the FRET should remain unaltered with loss of signal. (b) Real-time profile of proteolytic assay with different substrate concentrations ranging from 0.5-50 \u03bcM, using 5 \u03bcM protease was performed and the fluorescence was measured at different time points every 5 min till 15 h and the increase in fluorescence was observed.

CHIKV nsP2pro and substrate were incubated in a buffer of 20 mM BisTrisPropane (pH 8.0) containing the indicated concentrations (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mM) of NaCl. (e) Effects of various divalent cations (2 mM) on protease activity. (f) Effect of various universal protease inhibitors. CHIKV nsP2pro and substrate were incubated in the 20 mM BisTrisPropane (pH 8.0) with each of the indicated inhibitor. (g) Effects of thiol protease inhibitors (NEM and MMTS) on protease activity and the addition of DTT or \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (\u03b2-ME), restored the enzyme activity inhibited by MMTS when added simultaneously or 1 h post enzyme-substrate reaction. The standard errors of the means of results from three independent experiments are shown. The asterisk indicates statistical significance (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, *** < 0.001) with respect to control ( # p value indicates significance with respect to MMTS).

For development of HTS assay two different fluorescence-based approaches have been used to measure protease activity i.e., FI and FRET-based. (a-c) Real time profile of time course of product formation for FI and FRET based assay have been illustrated. The Z' factor value > 0.5 has been considered as an indicator of an authentic HTS assay. (d) The scatter plot shows the positive control (diamond shaped) and negative control (square shaped) data for the Z' factor calculation. Data shown here is representative of one of the intraplate assay, using FRET-based substrate. Statistical analysis of data is tabulated which indicates mean, SD, CV, Z'-factor, S/B and S/N for each 96-well plate having 48 replicates of positive control (signal) and negative control (background) for intra-plate whereas mean, standard deviation (SD) and CV were calculated for interplate and day to day variability[Z' = 1 \u2212 3*(SD signal + SD background )/(Mean signal \u2212 Mean background ), CV = SD signal / Mean signal \u00d7 100, S/B = Mean signal /Mean background and S/N = Mean signal \u2212 Mean background /SD background ].
