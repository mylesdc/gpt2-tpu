            "text": "The 39 untranslated region (39UTR) of human astroviruses (HAstV) consists of two hairpin structures (helix I and II) joined by a linker harboring a conserved PTB/hnRNP1 binding site. The identification and characterization of cellular proteins that interact with the 39UTR of HAstV-8 virus will help to uncover cellular requirements for viral functions. To this end, mobility shift assays and UV cross-linking were performed with uninfected and HAstV-8-infected cell extracts and HAstV-8 39UTR probes. Two RNA-protein complexes (CI and CII) were recruited into the 39UTR. Complex CII formation was compromised with cold homologous RNA, and seven proteins of 35, 40, 45, 50, 52, 57/60 and 75 kDa were cross-linked to the 39UTR. Supermobility shift assays indicated that PTB/hnRNP1 is part of this complex, and 39UTR-crosslinked PTB/hnRNP1 was immunoprecipitated from HAstV-8 infected cell-membrane extracts. Also, immunofluorescence analyses revealed that PTB/ hnRNP1 is distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of uninfected cells, but it is mainly localized perinuclearly in the cytoplasm of HAstV-8 infected cells. Furthermore, the minimal 39UTR sequences recognized by recombinant PTB are those conforming helix I, and an intact PTB/hnRNP1-binding site. Finally, small interfering RNA-mediated PTB/hnRNP1 silencing reduced synthesis viral genome and virus yield in CaCo2 cells, suggesting that PTB/hnRNP1 is required for HAstV replication. In conclusion, PTB/hnRNP1 binds to the 39UTR HAstV-8 and is required or participates in viral replication.",

            "text": "Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in children constituting an important public health problem. The astroviruses belong to the Astroviridae family, consisting of non-enveloped viruses whose plus-sense, singlestranded polyadenylated genome of approximately 7 kb, is organized in three open reading frames (ORFs) ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF2 [1, 2] , preceded and followed, respectively, by the 59 and 39 untranslated regions (UTRs) of 80 to 100 nucleotides (nt) [3] . It has been suggested that RNA viral replication occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum-derived intracellular membrane, and is mediated through interactions between the ORF1A-encoded nsP1a/4 phosphoprotein -which includes residues of the viral genome-linked protein (VPg) -and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)-encoding ORF1b [4] [5] [6] [7] . Viral 39UTRs participate in the interaction with host-cell and viral proteins, and may interact with other parts of the viral genome [8] , thus contributing to host specificity, tropism and pathogenesis. In spite of this, only one report exists regarding the RNA secondary structure of the 39 end of HAstV-1, which is similar to those of other RNA viruses [9] , and little is known about the specific interactions involved in viral 39UTR recognition and the underlying molecular mechanisms. The RNA elements within the highly conserved 39UTR may help recruit the cellular factors that mediate viral translation and replication [10] .",

In addition, some viral proteins are also recruited to the UTRs in order to form a functional viral replication complex (VRC) on subcellular membrane surfaces [18, 19] . The role of these proteins in viral replication has been depicted, but the precise mechanism underlying the function of all viral and cellular proteins involved has not been fully unraveled. For example, some might be involved in membrane remodeling, creating a favorable microenvironment for viral replication, others as chaperones that facilitate proper folding during VRC assembly and function [19] .",

As predicted in silico, the RNA structures these 39UTRs are conformed by two hairpins joined by a single stranded linker, and a putative PTB binding site located either within or next to the linker. This structural conservation suggests that the 39UTR might be involved in the regulation of viral activities, such as replication. To explore the role of the HAstV-8 39UTR RNA in the regulation of viral functions, we studied the interaction of human CaCo2 cellular factors with RNA probes of this region with or without the PTB binding site. Mobility shift assays evidenced the formation of two RNA-protein complexes, CI and CII, and the supershift of complex CII by PTB antibodies. UV cross-linking assays showed that seven proteins of 35, 40/45, 50, 52, 57/60 and 75 kDa were directly bound to this 39UTR, and immunoprecipitation assays identified PTB in the 57/60-kDa bands. Also, immunofluorescence analysis showed perinuclear PTB signals localized mainly in the cytoplasm of HAstV-8 infected cells. Moreover, recombinant PTB was cross-linked to 39UTR probes containing intact helix I, and PTB binding sites. As expected, siRNA-mediated PTB knockdown in HAstV-8 infected CaCo2 cells showed reduced RNA viral genome synthesis and viral yield. Our results suggest that PTB binds to the cognate UCUU site, localized in the linker of the 39UTR of HAstV-8, that helix I is also required for such binding, and that it is required and participates in viral replication.",

It is arranged in two helixes (I and II) connected through a linker (Fig. 1A) ; splitting the 39UTR facilitated comparisons between strains. Between serotypes, linker lengths are the source of variation in the helix I-linker regions, albeit in helix II nucleotide variations were found ( Fig. 1B; nucleotide changes are shown for each strain). Putative PTB/ hnRNP1 binding sites UCUU are found in the single-stranded (or partly) linkers of HAstV-3, -5, and -7, whereas in HAstV-1 and -4 these elements are localized nearby. At the beginning of helixes II (Fig. 1A) , all but HAstV-4 contain the previously reported PTB/ hnRNP1 binding element CUCUCU [36] . This structural arrangement could partially explain the prevalence of serotypes in the world [8] , probably as a consequence of the interaction with cellular and viral factors that may impact viral functions [37] .",

Mobility shift assays showed that two protein complexes (CI and CII) were recruited on the HAstV-8 39UTR RNA, with two different amounts of uninfected and infected CaCo2 cells extracts (data no shown). The specificity of the interactions between the HAstV-8 39UTR and infected cells extracts was analyzed in a competition assays using 20-fold and 60-fold molar excess of unlabeled homologous RNA 39UTR as a competitor. The cellular proteins-viral RNA Complex CII was competed with cold homologous RNA (Fig. 2B) , indicating that RNA binding of these proteins was specific and probably through PTB/hRNP1 binding sites. In contrast, in complex CI the binding of cellular proteins to the 39UTR RNA sequences seems to be non-specific, since it was competed both by homologous and heterologous RNAs, without PTB/hnRNP1 binding sites. Therefore, RNA-protein interactions in CI are likely mediated by motifs other than the PTB/hnRNP1 binding site.",

However, stronger signals of individual proteins of infected cell extracts were observed (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) , reflecting the presence of infection-specific factors resulting in more efficient binding of proteins to the 39UTR. Except for the 75 kDa protein, proteins of similar molecular weight were previously reported. To exclude cross-contamination between cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, western blots were carried out with anti-Actin and anti-Lamin A antibodies (Fig. 2D ).

Incubation of anti-hnRNP1 antibody with cytoplasmic uninfected and infected cell extracts (Fig. 3A ) after the addition of the labeled 39UTR RNA, resulted in the formation of an additional supershifted CIII complex. Complex CIII was absent in the control reactions without antibody and with an unrelated antibody (lanes 2, 4, 6 and 8 in Figs. 3A). Apparently complex CIII is slightly enriched in infected cells suggesting that PTB/hnRNP1 is present in the complexes recruited in the 39UTR RNA. To exert its role in viral processes, upon viral infections, nuclear PTB/hnRNP1 shuttles rapidly to the cytoplasm, retaining its predominant nuclear localization [44] . For example, during dengue and feline calicivirus infections, PTB/hnRNP1 shuttles to the cytoplasm and participates in viral replicative cycles of both viruses [45, 46] . PTB/hnRNP1 is maintained in the cytoplasm upon cellular stress, such as viral infections [44, 50] . In steady state cells, PTB/hnRNP1 also functions in mRNA transport and stability as well as IRESmediated translation. Cytoplasmic localization is achieved mainly by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-16 within the nuclear localization signal. To further confirm the sub-cellular distributions of PTB/hnRNP1 during HAstV-8 infection, western blot and co-localization assays were carried out with anti-hnRNP1 and anti-PTB antibodies ( Fig. 3B and C) . Monoclonal antibodies against the RNA binding domain (C-terminus) of PTB showed that in HAstV8 infected cells, nuclear PTB/hnRNP1 moves out to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B) . Similarly, the polyclonal anti-hnRNP1 antibody, against the nuclear localization and export signals -NLS and NES -(N-terminus) of PTB/hnRNP1, also shows the same nuclear-cytoplasm shuttling of PTB/hnRNP1. Due to the difference of epitope recognition this antibody was also useful in detecting the nuclear and cytoplasmic localizations of PTB/ hnRNP1, regardless of infection. Then, the localization by confocal microscopy of PTB/hnRNP1 in mock-infected cells was observed mainly in the nucleus (Fig. 3Cb) , and upon HAstV-8 infection PTB/hnRNP1 was distributed to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3Cf) . This redistribution of PTB/hnRNP1 is due to PTB/ hnRNP1 phosphorylation at Ser-16 which modulates the nucleocytoplasmic distribution [44] , in an analogous fashion of nsp1a/4 phosphorylation that capacitates nsp1a/4-RNA polymerase interaction for the establishment a productive infection by HAstV-8 [6] . Positive HAstV-8 infected cells were monitored by the typical fluorescence signal of the VP34 capsid protein distributed throughout the cytoplasm as prominent accumulation of bright punctate granules around the nuclear membrane (Fig. 3Cg ) as previously described [4] . As expected, VP34 HAstV-8 capsid protein was not detected in mock infected CaCo cells (Fig. 3Cc) .",

For example, viral replicase complexes from other positive-strand RNA viruses assemble on intracellular membrane surfaces [10, 19] , around the viral RNA comprising viral replication proteins and coopted host proteins, including PTB/hnRNP1. Therefore, we explored the presence of PTB/hnRNP1 in cytoplasmic membrane-associated proteins from uninfected and HAstV-8 infected cells by western-blot assays carried out with hnRNP1 antibodies and NP40 membrane extracts obtained at different hours post infection (h p.i.). In both extracts, PTB/ hnRNP1 was detected in all p.i. time points (Fig. 4A) . Positive membrane fractionation and cytoplasmic and nuclear markers were assessed with anti-PDI, anti-Actin and anti-Lamin A antibodies, respectively. Additional supershifts were carried out with cytoplasmic membrane fractions as described above. The results showed a similar pattern than the S10 cytoplasmic preparation. Interestingly the intensity of all complexes signal was stronger (Fig. 4B) . These results suggested that PTB/ hnRNP1, cellular proteins and probably viral proteins, from membrane fractions were sufficient for 39UTR HAstV-8 RNAprotein complex formation.",

            "text": "PTB/hnRNP1 is one of the most frequently IRES-specific cellular trans-acting factors implicated in RNA stability, translation and replication of several human viruses as poliovirus, dengue, hepatitis C (HCV) and other positive-strand RNA viruses [47, 48] . For example, in picornavirus, HCV and Feline calicivirus, PTB/hnRNP1 may act as an RNA chaperone facilitating the replication-translation switch [49, 50] . To delineate the minimal protein-interacting region of the HAstV-8 39UTR and to explore whether Helix I or Helix II are required in this interaction, radiolabeled wt and mutant 39UTR probes (shown in Fig. 2A) were used in UV cross-linking experiments with recombinant His-PTB. The wt 39UTR probe rendered strong 60 and 62 kDa bands (Fig. 5A ) that disappeared when the UCUU PTB binding site was mutated to CGAA (Fig. 5B) . Whereas rPTB was able to bind to HI probe lacking Helix II, rendering the same two 60 and 62 kDa bands (Fig. 5C) , rPTB signals were barely apparent when probe H1/mPTB was used (Fig. 5D ). Since probe HI rendered almost the same results as the wt probe, we suggest that the additional CUCU PTB binding localized on Helix II does not contribute to PTB binding. Therefore a PTB dimer binds face-to-face to the wt UCUU site, as suggested by Auweter and Allain [50] . Although we cannot rule out that the CUUCCU element could be recognized by PTB in all probes (except mPTB in which the spatial configuration of Helix II might sterically hinder its recognition), we interpret the two PTB signals as a result from distinct RNAprotein cross-link products after RNase treatment. As seen before, no cross-linking was observed with different amounts of BSA however with the unrelated RNA probe a band about 35 kDa was observed (Fig. S1 ). These results strongly suggest that maintaining an intact PTB site (and probably an intact Helix I as well) is important for protein recognition around position 6700, whereas the second PTB/hnRNP1 binding element is not sufficient for binding.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, human astrovirus replication occurs within the replication complexes formed in the cytoplasm. Also, PTB/hnRNP1 is mainly located in the nucleus, although it can shuttle to the cytoplasm upon viral infections. In order to analyze a possible role of PTB/hnRNP1 in HAstV-8 replication, uninfected CaCo2 cells were first transfected with siRNAs against PTB, and the levels of PTB/hnRNP1 expression were monitored by western-blot and immunofluorescence analysis. PTB/hnRNP1 was detected as a 57/60 kDa doublet, suggesting that at least two PTB/hnRNP1 isoforms are present in CaCo2 cells (Fig. S2A) , and depending on the siRNA concentration used, the expression of both PTB/hnRNP1 isoforms was reduced at least 10-fold, respectively, whereas PTB/hnRNP1 expression was unaffected in mock and scrambled-siRNA transfections (Fig. S2B) . PTB/ hnRNP1 knockdown was confirmed by IF also. As expected, PTB was observed in the nuclei of transfected CaCo2 cells with the scrambled siRNA. In contrast, PTB was absent from the nuclei of siPTB treated cells (Fig. S2C) . PTB knockdown-cells and controlcells were then infected with HAstV-8; the samples were harvested following the protocol depicted in Fig. 6A . We first showed that siPTB-treatment for 72 h was sufficient for sustained PTB silencing without apparent cell morphological perturbance (Fig.  S2) . Then, compared to the scrambled siRNA (land Sc), a 77% reduction of PTB protein expression was achieved with 2.5 mM of siPTB (Fig. 6B) . To understand whether PTB/hnRNP1 knockdown expression affects HAstV-8 RNA replication, the viral RNA polymerase (nsP1b) protein expression and viral RNA were determined by Western blotting and qRT-PCR, respectively ( Fig. 6C and D) . As expected, viral nsP1b expression was lower in 2.5 mM siPTB-treated than siScrambled-treated cells (Fig. 6C) . The level of viral negative strand RNA in cells transfected with siPTB was reduced dramatically (&90%), in comparison with siScrambled (Fig. 6D , bars Infec Sc and Infec siPTB), indicating that silencing of PTB induced a reduction in viral replication. The transfected uninfected cells were used as negative control (bars Uninf siSc and Uninf siPTB). Furthermore, reduced viral production in the culture supernatants (monitored as in references [20, 25, 26] ) was observed upon PTB knockdown (Fig. 6E) . The siRNA treated cells resulted in a 42% (2.35-fold/2.5 mM) reduction of viral production (7610 6 ffu/ml) with siPTB in comparison with siScrambled-transfected cells (1.8610 7 ffu/ml) (monitored as reported in reference [52] ). This result is consistent with the knockdown of host cell proteases, which result in less than one log viral release reduction reported previously [51] ; however our system allowed more reproducible results. A possible explanation for this modest viral particle reduction relies in the fact that the astroviral RNA negative strand synthesis appears 12 hours post-infection, coincident with the detection of the positive strand RNA and the ORF2 subgenomic RNA (sgRNA, encoding the capsid proteins). Notably at this time point, the amount of plussense sgRNA is tenfold greater than the minus-sense replicative intermediary RNA [52] , which is translated into capsid proteins used for packaging of new viral particles [37] . It is possible that in the time frame used in our experiments, which overlap the HAstVs viral particles release (12 to 24 hpi), we were able to detect newly packaged viral particles whose RNA molecules escaped or were synthesized before PTB knockdown.",

PTB/ hnRNP1 is redistributed to the cytoplasm during HAstV-8 infection in membrane-associated fractions, and it is required, directly or indirectly, for HAstV-8 replication. We are currently investigating other factors involved in such process. Figure S1 UV-cross linking was carried out with radiolabeled an unrelated RNA was incubated with 1 mg of recombinant His-PTB (A) or 0.25, 0.50, and 1 mg of BSA were incubated with the wild type 39UTR RNA (B). Free probes appear in lanes 2 and 3 respectively. The molecular mass markers (MWM) are shown. (TIF) Figure S2 Caco-2 cells were mock-transfected (M) or transfected with the indicated siRNA (A). Total protein was harvesting to demonstrate PTB knockdown by western blot, Actin was used as loading control. The reduction of PTB/hnRNP1 expression was quantitating by densitometry (B) taking actin or/ and mock transfected cell as the reference, arbitrary density units (vertical axis) was plotted against the siRNA concentration (horizontal axis). The PTB/hnRNP1 knockdown was verified by confocal immunomicroscopy Olympus Fv300 (C). (TIF)",
