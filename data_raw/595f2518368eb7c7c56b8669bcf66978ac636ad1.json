Angiogenic (thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP)) and anti-angiogenic (tryptophan-tRNA ligase (WARS)) factors were identified in migrating CD8 + T cells and CD68 + macrophages. Proteins related to virus replication and cell proliferation, including probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DEAD box helicase 5 (DDX5) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (HNRNPH1), were identified.

We performed a proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded pancreatic islet tissues of enterovirus-associated fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1DM), a representative subtype of virus-related human type 1 diabetes in which most of the islets are affected by insulitis [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Furthermore, we immunohistochemically validated the localization of the identified proteins in type 1 diabetic islets. An important feature of our findings was how selectively many proteins function in affected islets, including remaining islet cells and infiltrating immune cells. The catalog of profiled proteins and the protein-protein network model presented here provide new insights that will both enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of virus-induced type 1 diabetes and facilitate development of future interventions. In addition, our LMD-LC-MS method is applicable to routine analysis of pathological specimens of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues.",

For variable peptide modifications, methionine oxidation and formylation of lysine, arginine, and N-terminal amino acids were taken into account. Reported results were obtained from triplicate LC-MS runs for each sample with all peptide hits included. Unique peptides and proteins were identified by the following proteomics guidelines. Mascot search results were processed through Scaffold software (version 3.3.3, Proteome Software, Portland, OR) for gene ontology analyses and validation of MS/ MS-based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at a Scaffold peptide probability of .95%. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at a Scaffold protein probability of .99% and contained at least two identified peptides. Identified proteins were also analyzed in terms of putative functional association networks using the STRING 9.01 Server (http://www.string-db.org).",

LCP1 has been implicated in cell migration [12, 13] .

Ribosomal proteins are vital for cell proliferation, apoptosis and survival processes [25] . 40S ribosomal protein S24 (RPS24) and 60S ribosomal protein L15 (RPL15) were identified as part of cluster 3. RPL15 also plays a role in innate immune responses stimulated by type I IFN [26] . Cluster 4 included several proteins related to viral infection, innate/adaptive immunity, and successive signal transduction. Thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP) was highly expressed in CD68 + macrophages and CD8 + T cells infiltrating to FT1DMaffected islets ( Figure 2I , J, K, L). TYMP is a well-known mediator induced by pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic conditions [27] [28] [29] . However, there are no reports regarding the involvement of TYMP in islet inflammation and beta cell destruction. In many types of cancers, TYMP is expressed in the cancer cells and by infiltrating macrophages [27] . TYMP is assumed to contribute to angiogenesis by accelerating the migration of endothelial cells. Expression of TYMP is induced by many inflammatory mediators including IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta [27, 28] . The JAK-STAT signaling pathway, probably through STAT1 (see below), mediates IFN-gamma-induced activation of macrophages/T cells and exhibits angiogenic effects, such as migration to islet cell clusters and vascular neogenesis with bleeding, which are characteristic pathological feature of FT1DM. This in turn leads to aggressive macrophages/T cell infiltration to the islets and massive destruction of beta cells. TYMP is a target of manipulation in oncology, suggesting that it could serve as a target for interventional applications of anti-cancer agents [29] to the treatment of type 1 diabetes.",

Proteasomes are constitutively expressed in almost all cells and function in cleaving peptides in an ATP/ubiquitindependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. PSME 1 and 2 are constituents of the immunoproteasome, which is an alternative type of proteasome that plays a central role at the interface between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Immunoproteasomes are constitutively expressed in immunity-related cells and somatic cells, including islet beta cells, after stimulation with IFN-gamma and IFN-beta [40] . The immunoproteasome degrades peptides in a ubiquitin-independent manner and is exclusively connected with the adaptive immune response and increased MHC class I antigen presentation. In addition, the immunoproteasome maintains protein homeostasis against IFNinduced oxidative stress [40] . We previously reported strong expression of IFN-gamma and IFN-beta in FT1DM-affected islet cells [11] . In response to IFN-gamma-induced oxidative stress, PSME1 and 2 will act to maintain cell homeostasis and MHC class I expression.",

We detected expression in islet cells of viral replication-associated proteins typically induced by virus infection and proteins for which expression is induced by IFN-gamma. These proteins exert their major effects through the JAK-STAT1 signaling cascade, which leads to activation of innate/adaptive immunity, up-regulation of angiogenesis and antiangiogenesis factors, and initiation of cell repair mechanisms through chaperone activity. In CD8 + T cells and CD68 + macrophages in the islets, proteins involved in cell motility and migration to target islets are over-expressed. We hypothesize that through immunological mechanisms and angiogenesis with bleeding in the pancreas, some of the identified proteins play crucial roles in the aggressive beta cell destruction that is a characteristic pathological feature of FT1DM. Other molecules we identified have antiviral, cell repair, and anti-inflammatory actions.
