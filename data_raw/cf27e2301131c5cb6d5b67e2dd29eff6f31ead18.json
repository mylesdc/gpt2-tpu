Shown are the number of networks rejected (out of 100) using a \u03c7 2 goodness-of-fit test at 5% significance for each estimator.

From each network, we formed 100 snowball samples by using 100 independent seed sets of 49 nodes (so 10,000 samples in total). For each sample we used a \u03c7 2 goodness-of-fit test at 5% significance to compare the estimated degree distribution of the sample with the degree distribution of the corresponding network. Column three of Table 1 shows the mean number of samples rejected (with 95% confidence intervals), calculated as the mean over 100 samples per network, then the mean over 100 networks. We expect rejection rates higher than the level of the test because the samples are only a fraction of the data. Estimator three (the sample degree distribution on waves 0, 1 and 2) does the best at capturing the degree distribution of the population. Although this estimator will be biased by the higher likelihood of including higher degree nodes, it seems (in this case) this effect on producing good distribution estimations is small in comparison to the effect from excluding waves, the inaccuracies from the assumptions of estimator five, or the approximations of estimator six. Thus, we use estimator three to generate edge-triangle type networks. Column one identifies which estimator was studied. Column two shows the number of simulated edge-triangle networks rejected (of 100) at 5% significance using degree distribution estimators 1-6. For each network the sample degree distribution is compared with the sample degree distribution of the observed snowball sample using a \u03c7 2 goodness-of-fit test. Column three shows results from a simulation sub-study using 100 simulated ERGMs and 100 snowball samples per ERGM network (so 10,000 samples in total). For each snowball sample, the estimated degree distribution is compared with the degree distribution of the population network (\"known truth\") using a \u03c7 2 goodness-of-fit test. Both results suggest estimator three generates a degree distribution most like that of the population network.",
