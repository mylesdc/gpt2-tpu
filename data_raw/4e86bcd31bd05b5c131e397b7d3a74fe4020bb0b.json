Deaths were estimated from vital statistics data and disease incidence was estimated from reportable disease, healthcare utilization, and cancer registry data, supplemented by local modeling studies and national and international epidemiologic studies. The 51 infectious agents and associated syndromes accounted for 729 lost HALYs, 44.2 deaths, and 58,987 incident cases per 100,000 population annually. The most burdensome infectious agents were: hepatitis C virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Staphylococcus aureus, influenza virus, Clostridium difficile, and rhinovirus. The top five, ten, and 20 pathogens accounted for 46%, 67%, and 75% of the total infectious disease burden, respectively. Marked sex-specific differences in disease burden were observed for some pathogens. The main limitations of this study were the exclusion of certain infectious diseases due to data availability issues, not considering the impact of co-infections and co-morbidity, and the inability to assess the burden of milder infections that do not result in healthcare utilization.",

Where possible, we adjusted for under-diagnosis and under-reporting using estimates from epidemiologic studies from comparable populations. We also used epidemiologic studies and expert opinion to determine the distribution of the health states typically experienced by new cases. For diseases where reported cases do not reflect incident cases due to delays from time of infection to symptomatic presentation, diagnosis, and reporting (HIV, hepatitis B virus [HBV] , and hepatitis C virus [HCV]), we used mathematical models to generate more accurate estimates of disease incidence and resulting health states. [21, 22] Healthcare utilization data were used to estimate the incidence of infectious diseases where reportable disease data would be suboptimal, including non-reportable pathogens, pathogens for which only a subset of infections are reportable (e.g., invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae), and syndromes for which etiologic agents are not usually defined by laboratory testing. These data were collected from validated linked population-based databases; data on physician visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were abstracted from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan physician billing claims database, the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System, and the Canadian Institute of Health Information's Discharge Abstract and Same-Day Surgery databases, respectively. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Encrypted health card numbers were used as unique identifiers for linkage of individuals across datasets. Generally, the healthcare utilization data were used to determine episodes of syndromes that can be caused by multiple infectious agents (e.g., pneumonia). These cases were attributed to various pathogens based on estimates from epidemiologic studies. Repeat healthcare utilization events for the same patient were considered to represent a single episode of infection if they occurred within a pre-specified time period (Table S1 ).",

We estimated the incidence of anogenital warts from an epidemiologic study. [33] We adapted the approach developed by Statistics Canada for estimating the burden of cancers. [34] Briefly, individuals with cancer experience some or all of the following health states: diagnosis (good, fair, or poor prognosis), treatment (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and certain combinations of those options), remission (after one or more treatment modalities), and if death occurs within five years, palliative care and terminal care (last month of life) attributable to the cancer. We obtained stage distributions at diagnosis (i.e., proportion of individuals diagnosed at a particular stage) from the OCR for 2007 and 2008. Five-year relative survival estimates and treatment distributions were determined from epidemiologic studies and expert opinion. We made several simplifying assumptions. The first was that all incident cases underwent some form of treatment. In reality, some patients are too frail at diagnosis to receive treatment, but the proportion not undergoing any treatment is generally small. Second, we simplified the treatment options by not distinguishing between curative and palliative radiation therapy and by not considering chemotherapy associated with mild, moderate, and severe toxicity (keeping the mild form only). Third, we assumed that only deaths that occurred within five years of diagnosis were attributable to the cancer (i.e., those who survived past five years due to another diagnosis), and those who survived past five years had a life expectancy that was the same as the rest of their age-sex stratum. Fourth, we assumed that the proportion dying within five years was independent of the type(s) of treatment and that those who died experienced on average 2.25 years in remission (five years minus the time spent in palliative (five months) and terminal care (one month) divided by two = 4.5 years/2 = 2.25 years). Fifth, we assumed the reduction in functioning to be similar when in remission, regardless of the treatment modality (or modalities) employed. Finally, we did not consider recurrent cancers. These parameters are presented in Tables S4 and S5. S. pneumoniae: using healthcare utilization data and infectious disease syndromes: We used healthcare utilization data and vital statistics to determine the number of episodes and deaths, respectively, of each of the syndromes resulting from S. pneumoniae infection (bacterial meningitis, septicaemia, pneumonia, septic arthritis, acute bronchitis, otitis media, and conjunctivitis). We also considered seizures, motor deficits, and deafness as sequelae of bacterial meningitis. We used epidemiologic studies to determine the percentage of each syndrome attributable to S. pneumoniae (to estimate both deaths and incident cases) and the duration of each health state. These parameters are presented in Table S6 .",

[6] The seven infectious diseases were ranked in a similar order, except for influenza, which was ranked lower in the ECDC study because their primary analysis only considered laboratory-confirmed cases, which dramatically underestimates the burden. [6] In contrast to previous studies reporting a slight dominance of the contribution of premature mortality over morbidity for infections, [2, 4] we found most of the burden was from premature mortality. This discrepancy relates to methodological differences in calculating ONBOIDS HALYs and GBD DALYs, with the use of more severe disability weights, discounting, age-weighting, and standard life expectancy all impacting the relative contribution of morbidity versus premature mortality. Despite uncertainty regarding which method should be considered the gold standard, it is reassuring that the rankings of these infectious diseases were similar.",

Some differences have clear biological explanations, such as the differential burden of HPV (cervical cancer in females), and E. coli (anatomical differences resulting in more urinary tract infections in females). The difference for HIV is related to behaviours (i.e., anal intercourse among men who have sex with men and injection drug use, more prevalent among males). [36] For HBV and HCV, the differences may be due to a combination of biological and behavioural risk factors. [37, 38] The syndrome-based results can guide prioritization of 'horizontal' prevention methods that are independent of the causative pathogen (e.g., smoking cessation and hand hygiene as methods of preventing pneumonia). Further work is needed to assess the benefits of possible interventions to prevent each of the syndromes and pathogens. Part of such an analysis could address the possibility of clustering of risk factors including social determinants of health.",

This may be less applicable to infectious diseases as incidence and severity frequently vary over time. We also did not consider the impact of co-infections (e.g., HIV and HCV) and other co-morbidities (e.g., diabetes and influenza virus). Important synergies exist between infectious diseases; notably, HIV can interact with other infectious diseases in terms of natural history and transmissibility. [41] While ONBOIDS is the most comprehensive examination of infectious diseases to our knowledge, the study was not exhaustive. We excluded certain pathogens (e.g., norovirus), syndromes (e.g., surgical site infections), and health states (e.g., amputations due to serious infection). The most significant exclusions may have been the oncogenic pathogens Helicobacter pylori and Epstein-Barr virus, given our finding that other oncogenic pathogens are among the most burdensome infectious agents. We also were unable to assess many milder infections that do not result in healthcare utilization, or take a societal perspective in assessing the impact of outbreaks (e.g., economic, psychological). Other important limitations include: the uncertain validity of the diagnostic codes for ascertaining infectious diseases; the assumption that etiologic agent distributions from studies of non-fatal outcomes also apply to fatal outcomes; reliance on a single underlying cause of death, which may have led to underestimation of the true burden of infectious diseases (e.g., deaths hastened or precipitated by infectious diseases would likely be attributed to pre-existing conditions); and the missed burden of undiagnosed infections. Finally, data were extracted from multiple sources of varying quality. Further details concerning the limitations of this work are described in the ONBOIDS technical report. Table 3 .

These results provide a crude ordering of infectious diseases that can be used to guide policy, planning, and research. Although data limitations preclude a greater level of precision and quantification of uncertainty, these results provide a sense of the relative importance of the infectious diseases studied. Less important than the precise position on the list is the fact that the top 20 agents capture such a large proportion of the total burden and that some recent high profile infections are absent. The next step is to translate these findings into information that is tailored for local decision-making. The WHO GBD project has had significant impacts on global and regional agencies, but a provincial analysis such as ONBOIDS provides information closer to the level of government responsible for healthcare policy-setting and funding. However, these findings are likely generalizable to other high-income settings. In translating findings such as these into policy, decision-makers must appreciate the ''herd-dynamic'' aspects of infectious diseases, such that, for example, funding for highly successful vaccination programs is not diverted towards the high-impact diseases identified here. The communicable nature of vaccine-preventable diseases means that ongoing investment is necessary to maintain existing successes. Also, while novel interventions (e.g., new vaccines) are required to further reduce the burden of infectious diseases, much of the burden can already be reduced by improved implementation of existing interventions (e.g., hand hygiene, improved vaccine uptake, safe injection sites). Setting priorities requires knowledge of disease burden as well as critical evaluation of the feasibility, cost, and impact of available interventions, and knowledge translation for decision-makers. Future work should assess the economic and other broad societal burdens associated with infectious diseases.",
