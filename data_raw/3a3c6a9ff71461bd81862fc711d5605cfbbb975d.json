            "text": "Background: Reconstructing individual transmission events in an infectious disease outbreak can provide valuable information and help inform infection control policy. Recent years have seen considerable progress in the development of methodologies for reconstructing transmission chains using both epidemiological and genetic data. However, only a few of these methods have been implemented in software packages, and with little consideration for customisability and interoperability. Users are therefore limited to a small number of alternatives, incompatible tools with fixed functionality, or forced to develop their own algorithms at considerable personal effort. Results: Here we present outbreaker2, a flexible framework for outbreak reconstruction. This R package re-implements and extends the original model introduced with outbreaker, but most importantly also provides a modular platform allowing users to specify custom models within an optimised inferential framework. As a proof of concept, we implement the within-host evolutionary model introduced with TransPhylo, which is very distinct from the original genetic model in outbreaker, and demonstrate how even complex model results can be successfully included with minimal effort. Conclusions: outbreaker2 provides a valuable starting point for future outbreak reconstruction tools, and represents a unifying platform that promotes customisability and interoperability. Implemented in the R software, outbreaker2 joins a growing body of tools for outbreak analysis.",

Transmission tree reconstruction has been used to specify the contribution of individual cases and locations to overall transmission [1] , characterise heterogeneous infectiousness within outbreaks [2, 3] , evaluate the impact of control measures on transmission intensity [4, 5] and identify transmission routes [6] . Consequently there exists significant interest in designing methodologies for the inference of transmission trees from outbreak data, including temporal data (e.g. date of symptom onset), contact data, pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) and geographic locations.",

Primarily, a large proportion of the methods described in the literature is not available as readily useable software (Table 1) , requiring the user either to directly modify the original code if it is available, or implement the algorithm themselves if not. Moreover, the existing software tools were developed in parallel with little consideration for interoperability, accepting similar types of data or outputting similar results in different formats. This results in unnecessary time spent preparing and formatting the data, and hinders effective comparison of results produced under different models. Finally, the current software are generally inflexible, with few options to specify algorithm behaviour without modifying the often complex source code (e.g. [7] ). This ranges from simple implementation issues, such as being limited to specific distributions for priors [14, 15] , to more fundamental restrictions on the inferential process itself, in that the underlying epidemiological and genetic models are hardcoded and not customisable by the user.",

Most consider the same data, namely WGS and some form of temporal data (i.e. dates of symptom onset and assumptions on the distribution of incubation and infectious periods [7, 9, 12, 14, 15] , or explicitly defined exposure intervals [10, 13] ). The majority are also implemented in a Bayesian framework, and therefore describe prior distributions on parameters and likelihood functions that evaluate the plausibility of a given parameter sets under specific transmission and evolutionary models. Unobserved data, including the transmission tree itself, times of infection and unobserved cases, are generally modelled using augmented data [17] . Finally most methods use a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to derive samples from the posterior distributions, using often complex proposal functions to explore alternative transmission scenarios.",

            "text": "outbreaker2 generalises this procedure and allows the user to implement their own models by specifying custom prior distributions, likelihood functions and movement functions, which are then employed within a wider inference framework. This enables sophisticated customisation of the algorithm with minimal effort by the user, allowing a greater focus on methodological developments rather than their implementation. Importantly, it also permits for different modules to be developed and easily combined, so that outbreak reconstruction approaches can be tailored to specific diseases and epidemiological contexts. outbreaker2 is implemented as a package for the R software [18] , as part of a larger toolkit for epidemics analysis developed under the R Epidemics Consortium (www.repidemicsconsortium.org). In the following, we explain the rationale of this implementation and illustrate its modularity using a simple case study. Implementation outbreaker2 is written in R and C++, making extensive use of Rcpp [19] to facilitate the integration of C++ into R. The original method for outbreak reconstruction introduced with outbreaker [7] has been entirely re-implemented using a modular and highly customisable approach ( Fig. 1 ). This was achieved by distinguishing the architecture which underpins the inferential process from model-specific regions of code (i.e. code that varies between model implementations), and treating these components as independent modules (Fig. 1) . Non-specific components of the implementation include data and overall configuration infrastructure, as well as all post-processing of outputs including summaries and graphics. The three central, model-specific components of our Bayesian inference framework are the prior distributions, likelihood functions and MCMC functions defining movements of the parameters. By abstracting these components into algorithmic functions with predefined input and output structures, we designed simple procedures allowing users to customise most aspects of the outbreak reconstruction, including the model itself and the MCMC used to explore the parameter space ( Fig. 1 ). The following sections describes the structure of the core components of outbreaker2, and the mechanisms by which they can be changed. Extensive documentation, including a full description of the API and example of customised models, are available from the outbreaker2 website (http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/outbreaker2/).",

The outbreaker_data class stores the data which remains unchanged throughout the inference process. Users pass temporal data (e.g. sampling times) as a vector of dates, and genetic data as either DNA sequences (DNAbin objects [20] ) or phylogenetic trees (phylo objects [20] ). Generation time and incubation period distributions are also specified by the user. Extensive data validation is achieved by the constructor of this class to prevent often intractable errors at a later stage. The outbreaker_config class stores the global properties of the algorithm and can be optionally specified by the user. Importantly, this allows the user to declare which parameters and augmented data should be moved and inferred during the MCMC procedure. Again, the constructor of this class ensures validation of the inputs. The outbreaker_param class is used internally for storing a single state in the MCMC chain, and describes parameters and augmented data. Objects of this class are proposed, accepted or rejected, and sampled during the MCMC procedure. The advantage of this fixed internal structure is that it greatly simplifies writing new, customised movement functions. Finally, results of the reconstruction are output as outbreaker_chains objects, for which various methods (e.g. plot, print, summary) have been defined to summarise and visualise results, or carry on further secondary analyses.",

Customised likelihood functions can be specified by the user for each of these components, to use alternative epidemiological or evolutionary models.

Well designed movement functions are necessary to achieve efficient chain convergence and ensure rapid and representative sampling from the posterior distribution. In outbreaker2, the MCMC is decomposed as a list of movement functions, each of which is evaluated at each step of the chain. Given the size and complexity of the parameter space when inferring temporally resolved transmission trees with unobserved cases, efficient movement functions are difficult and time-intensive to develop. outbreaker2 allows users to access the optimised, default movement functions for various parameters and augmented data (including, crucially, the transmission tree) while using custom prior distributions and likelihood functions. Default movements, likelihood and prior functions can all be accessed through the function get_cpp_api, so that these components can be used when designing new MCMC procedures.",

In other words, the whole machinery of the code is added seamlessly to custom movement functions where it is needed. Importantly, as the acceptance-rejection step is specified within movement functions, users are not restricted to Metropolis-Hastings methods [21] , and could use alternative MCMCs such as a Gibbs sampler [22] .",

In contrast to the model of evolution used by outbreaker2 [7] , which treats mutations between all transmission pairs as independent events, TransPhylo uses a phylogenetic tree to account for patterns of common evolution amongst the sampled isolates. Briefly, TransPhylo takes a time-stamped phylogenetic tree as input, and explores ways of \"coloring\" this tree with one color for each infected host, thus revealing the evolution that occurred within this host. Transmission events are therefore also represented as the points of transition from one color to another, or in other words from one host to another. This approach is completely different from the one implemented in the default setting of outbreaker2, making it a good case study for the flexibility of implementation of custom models in the outbreaker2 framework.",

Across 100 outbreaks, on average 76.5% of ancestry assignments were equivalent. This represents a significant increase over the baseline similarity between the default outbreaker2 model and TransPhylo, which agree on only 41.3% of ancestries on average, as confirmed by individual comparisons of consensus trees in reconstructed outbreaks (Fig. 4) . It is important to note that 100% agreement between o2mod.TransPhylo and TransPhylo is not expected, as the epidemiological model of the latter parametrizes an offspring distribution and incorporates additional prior knowledge on its shape. However, the significant convergence in results upon using a custom likelihood acts as a proof of concept that outbreaker2 can accurately recreate high level behaviour of largely different inference frameworks, and therefore represents a promising starting point for the implementation of future models.",

An infector of 0 (bottom row) indicates that the individual is the index case. Black crosses represent the true simulated ancestries by the community, distributed as separate R packages. Further adjustments may be made to accommodate additional epidemiological and evolutionary data and parameters currently not implemented in outbreaker2, and which may limit the scope for additional modules.
