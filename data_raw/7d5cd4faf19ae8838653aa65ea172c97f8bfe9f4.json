The 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) is essential for the coronaviral life cycle and is an appealing target for the development of therapeutics. We report the expression, purification, crystallization and 2.10 \u00c5 X-ray structure of 3CL pro from PEDV. Analysis of the PEDV 3CL pro structure and comparison to other coronaviral 3CL pro 's from the same alphacoronavirus phylogeny shows that the overall structures and active site architectures across 3CL pro 's are conserved, with the exception of a loop that comprises the protease S 2 pocket. We found a known inhibitor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CL pro , (R)-16, to have inhibitor activity against PEDV 3CL pro , despite that SARS-3CL pro and PEDV 3CL pro share only 45.4% sequence identity. Structural comparison reveals that the majority of residues involved in (R)-16 binding to SARS-3CL pro are conserved in PEDV-3CL pro ; however, the sequence variation and positional difference in the loop forming the S 2 pocket may account for large observed difference in IC 50 values. This work advances our understanding of the subtle, but important, differences in coronaviral 3CL pro architecture and contributes to the broader structural knowledge of coronaviral 3CL pro 's.",

Subsequently termed porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), it was classified as a coronavirus as a result of its appearance in electron microscopes and its polypeptide structure 3-5 . Before its occurrence in the United States, there were numerous reports of PEDV in various European countries, as well as in Korea, China, Japan, the Philippines and Thailand 6 . The first four reports of PEDV in the United States occurred within 10 days of each other on four farms in Iowa in late April of 2013 7 . The disease is characterized by porcine epidemic diarrhea with concomitant vomiting and dehydration, resulting in high fatality rates especially in piglets where mortality rates approach 100% 8 . The origin of transmission of PEDV to the United States is still unknown; however, in the past two years, it has resulted in a sizeable and negative impact on the US economy. The estimated net annual loss for the US economy as a result of PEDV, summed across all effects, is reported to range from $900 million to $1.8 billon as of June, 2014 9 .",

Two long ORFs encode for the replicase proteins, ORF1a and ORF1b, which are connected by a ribosomal frame-shift and produce the coronaviral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab upon translation 10 . These viral polyproteins are processed at 14 cleavage sites by two or three cysteine proteases producing 16 non-structural proteins (nsps). The papain-like protease (PLP1 and PLP2 or PL pro ) cleaves the polyprotein at 3 sites, whereas the 3C-like protease (3CL pro ), also known as the main-protease (M pro ) or nsp5, cleaves the polyprotein at 11 sites. The function of both proteases is essential for viral replication and therefore they are attractive targets for the development of anti-coronaviral therapeutics. In this study, we report the expression, purification, crystallization, and X-ray structure of PEDV-3CL pro in its unbound state to 2.10 \u00c5. We tested PEDV-3CL pro for inhibition by (R)-16, a compound known to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CL pro , and found (R)-16 to inhibit PEDV-3CL pro with an IC 50 of 25.4 \u00b1 1.4 \u03bcM.

The active site of PEDV-3CL pro , which contains a catalytic dyad formed from residues Cys144 and His41, is located in a cleft between domains I and II (Fig. 1a) . Domain III is involved in monomer dimerization, which is ultimately responsible for forming the active protease ( Fig. 1a) 12, 13 . In the absence of substrate, water and solvent molecules (MPD, DMSO, and IPA) reside in the active site of PEDV-3CL pro , which is solvent exposed on one side (Fig. 1a,b) . Interestingly, different solvent molecules are found in the respective active sites of the PEDV-3CL pro monomers composing the PEDV-3CL pro dimer, where the a single DMSO molecule resides in the Chain A active site and the Chain B active site houses both isopropanol (IPA) and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) (Fig. 1b) . The presence of different solvent molecules in each of the active sites of the dimer supports the assignment of one biological dimer in the asymmetric unit.",

LSQ superposition resulted in an all-atom RMSD value of 2.11 \u00c5 and a C-alpha RMSD value of 1.69 \u00c5.

Interestingly, in both the superimpositions of PEDV-3CL pro with 229E-3CL pro and FIPV-3CL pro , the loops comprising the protease subsites of the 3CL pro active site are in nearly identical structural locations, with the exception of the loop that comprises the S 2 subsite, the S 2 loop. The S 2 loop forms the outer boundary of the S 2 binding pocket and shows positional variability across the X-ray structures of 229E-, FIPV-, and PEDV-3CL pro , which may lead to differences in the size of the S 2 subsites across 3CL pro 's ( Fig. 2b,d) .",

SARS-3CL pro belongs to a different phylogenetic lineage than PEDV-3CL pro and shares lower sequence identity (45.4%) with PEDV-3CL pro ; however, we reasoned that the similar tertiary structure and conserved active site architecture of 3CL pro 's would allow for inhibition by the same molecule. We therefore tested the inhibition of PEDV-3CL pro by (R)-16, which was developed as a non-covalent inhibitor against SARS-3CL pro with potential broad-spectrum activity (Fig. 3a) 15 . We found (R)-16 to inhibit PEDV-3CL pro with an IC 50 value of 25.4 \u00b1 1.4 \u03bc M, where the representative curve for (R)-16 inhibition of PEDV-3CL pro is shown in Fig. 3a and the data for (R)-16 inhibition of SARS-3CL pro has been previously published 15 . The previously reported IC 50 of (R)-16 against SARS-3CL pro is 1.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bc M 15 , which indicates a ~17-fold weaker interaction of (R)-16 with PEDV-3CL pro . The inhibition of PEDV-3CL pro by (R)-16, though weak, is significant because it indicates that the development of non-covalent broad-spectrum inhibitors of 3CL pro 's may be possible.",

We were therefore curious if the difference in position of the S 2 loop between PEDV-and SARS-3CL pro may be important for (R)-16 binding. A structural alignment of the ligand-bound structures of FIPV-and SARS-3CL pro (4ZRO and 3V3M, respectively) shows that compounds 6 and (R)-16 bind to the respective 3CL pro 's by positioning their sterically bulky, hydrophobic groups in the S 2 subsite (leucine and t-butylanilido, respectively; Fig. 4a ).

A sequence comparison of the S 2 loops of FIPV-, TGEV-, NL63-, 229E-, PEDV-, and SARS-3CL pro shows that the SARS-3CL pro S 2 loop is one residue longer than those from the alpha-coronaviruses and shares no sequence identity with FIPV-, TGEV-, NL63-, 229E-and PEDV-3CL pro (Fig. 4b) . Additionally, the S 2 loop of SARS-3CL pro contains anionic amino acids, Glu and Asp, at positions 47 and 48, respectively. These variations in the S 2 loop between the alpha-coronavirus 3CL pro 's and SARS-3CL pro may explain the large observed difference in the IC 50 value of (R)-16 against PEDV-3CL pro as compared to SARS-3CL pro (25.4 \u00b1 1.4 \u03bc M vs. 1.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bc M, respectively). Furthermore, the combination of the increase in length and charge properties of the S 2 loop of SARS-3CL pro relative to that of the alpha-coronavirus 3CL pro 's likely changes the size and shape of the S 2 binding pocket and therefore may allow for increased variability at the P 2 site of inhibitor and substrate molecules.",

The S 2 -subsite residue preference is identical for PEDV-and SARS-3CL pro in most all cleavage sites, with the exception of nsp5/6 and nsp12/13. SARS-3CL pro can accommodate a larger P 2 -phenylalanine, e.g. at the nsp5/6 cleavage site, while PEDV-3CL pro recognizes residues only as large as a P 2 -leucine at this position in the polyprotein. At the nsp12/13 cleavage site, PEDV polyprotein 1ab has a serine at the P 2 site, while SARS polyprotein 1ab has a P 2 -leucine. A larger size of the S 2 pocket in SARS-3CL pro is consistent with the SARS polyprotein 1ab having a phenylalanine residue at the P 2 position of the nsp5/6 cleavage site. This larger S 2 -pocket in SARS-3CL pro may allow for better binding of (R)-16, allowing the bulky t-butylanilido group to take full advantage of hydrophobic interactions within the S 2 subsite and position (R)-16 to optimize hydrogen-bonding with SARS-3CL pro Gly143 and His163.",

Fractions containing pure PEDV-3CL pro , as judged by SDS-PAGE and specific activity, were pooled, dialyzed into storage buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol), and concentrated using a spin concentrator (Millipore) with a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff membrane. The protein was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C in a freezer until further use (Fig. 1a) . Prior to crystallization, PEDV-3CL pro was concentrated to 4.0 mg mL \u22121 using a spin concentrator (10 kDa cutoff membrane, Millipore) and loaded onto a 24 mL Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion chromatography column equilibrated with 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 2.5 mM DTT. Peak fractions containing PEDV-3CL pro , as determined via visualization of SDS-PAGE and confirmed by protein activity assay, were pooled and concentrated to protein concentrations of 1.5, 2.8, and 4.0 mg mL \u22121 for crystallization.",

Crystallization trials (150 nL protein and 150 nL of crystallization solution) were set up in a 96-well sitting drop tray (Intelli-Plate 96) using a TTP LabTech Mosquito \u00ae liquid robotics system at PEDV-3CL pro concentrations of 1.5, 2.8, and 4.0 mg mL \u22121 in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 2.5 mM DTT. An initial hit of clusters of needle-like crystals was obtained at 20 \u00b0C from the PEGS II Suite condition No. 50 consisting of 10% (w/v) PEG-4000 and 20% (w/v) isopropanol. Crystals were also obtained at each of the other PEDV-3CL pro concentrations. Optimization of this condition was achieved by varying the concentration of both isopropanol and PEG-4000 between 15-30% and 7-22% respectively, where diffraction quality crystals grew at a variety of conditions from this round of optimization. The best crystals grew at 20 \u00b0C in 25% isopropanol and 22% PEG-4000 at a protein concentration of 1.5 mg mL \u22121 and appeared after 24-72 hours (Fig. 4) . Crystals were transferred using 0.05-0.1 \u03bc m nylon loops to small drops containing the crystallization solution plus the cryo-protectant, which was 15% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD). After cryo-protection, the crystals were remounted into the nylon loop and rapidly flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.",

The program Phaser-MR (simple interface) module of PHENIX 26 was used to perform MR and the X-ray structure of the human coronavirus 229E-3CL pro in complex with the peptidomimetic compound EPDTC (PDB entry 2zu2 13 ) with ligands and waters removed was used as a search model. Iterative rounds of manual building and structural refinement were completed using PHENIX, and manual inspection, rebuilding and the addition of water molecules were accomplished using the programs Coot 27 and the refinement module of PHENIX.

Inhibition of PEDV-3CL pro by (R)-16 at a concentration of 100 \u03bc M was first tested in an enzymatic assay containing the following buffer (50 mM HEPES, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.01% TritonX-100, 1 mM DTT). The assays were carried out in triplicate using Costar 3694 EIA/RIA 96-Well half-area, flat bottom, black polystyrene plates from Corning Incorporated. 1 \u03bc L of 100X inhibitor stock in DMSO was added to 79 \u03bc L of enzyme in assay buffer and the enzyme-inhibitor mixture was incubated for 10 minutes. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 \u03bc L of 10 \u03bc M UIVT3 substrate, a custom synthesized F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer peptide substrate with the following sequence: HilyteFluor TM 488-ESARLQSGLRKAK-QXL520 TM -NH 2 , producing final concentrations of 100 nM for the 3CL pro enzyme and 2 \u03bc M UIVT3 substrate. The increase in fluorescence intensity of the reaction was then measured over a period of 10 minutes as relative fluorescence units (RFU t ). An excitation wavelength of 485 (bandwidth of 20 nm) and an emission wavelength at 528 (bandwidth of 20 nm) was used to monitor the reactions using a BioTek Synergy H1 multimode microplate reader. The percent inhibition of the PEDV-3CL pro was determined using the following equation (1) The IC 50 value of (R)-16 against PEDV-3CL pro was determined at ambient temperature using 100 \u03bc L assays conducted in the following buffer: 50 mM HEPES, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0. The increase in fluorescence intensity over time during the reaction was then measured. The average percent inhibition of PEDV-3CL pro was then calculated from triplicate data, and the final averaged data with standard deviation were then plotted as a function of inhibitor concentration. The data were fit to the following equation (2) where %I max is the percent maximum inhibition of 3CL pro . The errors in the IC 50 and %I max values are the errors in the fitted parameters resulting from fitting of the equations to the data.",
