            "text": "The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus (CoV) belonging to the \u03b1-CoV genus and it causes high mortality in infected sucking piglets, resulting in substantial losses in the farming industry. CoV trigger a drastic reorganization of host cell membranes to promote their replication and egression, but a detailed description of the intracellular remodeling induced by PEDV is still missing. In this study, we examined qualitatively and quantitatively, using electron microscopy, the intracellular membrane reorganization induced by PEDV over the course of an infection. With our ultrastructural approach, we reveal that, as most of CoV, PEDV initially forms double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), which probably serve as replication/transcription platforms. Interestingly, we also found that viral particles start to form almost simultaneously in both the endoplasmic reticulum and the large virion-containing vacuoles (LVCVs), which are compartments originating from the Golgi, confirming that \u03b1-CoV assemble indistinguishably in two different organelles of the secretory pathway. Moreover, PEDV virons appear to have an immature and a mature form, similar to another \u03b1-CoV the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). Altogether, our study underlies the similarities and differences between the lifecycle of \u03b1-CoV and that of viruses belonging to other CoV subfamilies.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped positive single-stranded RNA viruses that are characterized by crown-like spikes on the virion surface under an electron microscope [1] . Mostly based on phylogenetic clustering, this virus family has been divided into four subgroups: the \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u2206-CoV [1, 2] . The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an \u03b1-CoV and the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, which is characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and loss of weight. PEDV infections have a substantial detrimental effect on the swine industry because they cause high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in sucking piglets [3] [4] [5] . Since its first identification in Belgium in 1978 in growing and fattening pigs [6] , PEDV has been reported in Europe and Asia, and a remarkable increase of PEDV outbreaks occurred in the pig-producing provinces of China in late PEDV-infected cells by quantitative EM and immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) to establish a more comprehensive inventory of the membrane remodeling induced by this virus and in more general by \u03b1-CoV. We opted for a time-course approach to determine at which stage of the viral lifecycle the different membranous structures appear. By combining the ultrastructural data with the measurement of viral RNA synthesis, viral replication, progeny virus release, and immunofluorescence analyses, our results show that PEDV infection induces a profound reorganization of the ER and Golgi, which precedes the formation of DMVs, CMs, and LVCVs. Consistently with these observations, we also found that the ER and Golgi undergo alterations not observed for other CoV, such as ER proliferation and a Golgi vacuolarization, which results in an organelle that we have named the irregular vesicle clusters (IVCs). Importantly, and similar to HCoV-NL36 and TGEV, we also found that together with the Golgi, the ER is the major platform of virion assembly. Altogether, our study provides an overall comprehensive picture of the ultrastructural events taking place inside a cell over the course of a PEDV infection.",

Based on their morphology, PEDV particles could be grouped in two categories. The first were particles with an annular stained region under the external envelope ( Figure 1C ,D,F, black arrows). The second were smaller virions with a less circular and denser core, which was more markedly stained ( Figure 1C -E, white arrows). These same phenotypical differences in viral particles have also been observed in TGEV-infected cells, another \u03b1-CoV, for which it was shown that the particles represent immature and mature virions, respectively [29] . PEDV viral particles were mainly present in the lumen of two morphologically distinguishable compartments, where they were assembling through inward budding at the limiting membrane ( Figure 1C ,D, arrowheads). One of these two compartments was what appeared to be an expanded rough ER with irregular shape, as the surface was decorated with ribosomes and they were often observed to be connected to an ER with normal morphology ( Figure 1C ). These structures have already been reported in cells infected by other \u03b1-CoV [23, 29] . The other compartments were large vacuoles with a diameter of 865 \u00b1 270 nm, limited by a single membrane, which have previously been named LVCVs ( Figure 1D ) [12, 17, 18, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29, 30] . Virions were also detected in large single-membrane vacuoles with a diameter of 800 \u00b1 160 nm, which also contained compact membrane whorls and amorphous material ( Figure 1E ). Similar compartments, but smaller in size and without virions, were also observed in uninfected cells, indicating that they do not represent structures induced by PEDV. These characteristics suggested that these vacuoles could be endolysosomal compartments. This notion was confirmed by the immunogold labeling of cryo-sections obtained from PEDV-infected cells at 72 h p.i. using antibodies against CD63 and the transferrin receptor (TfR). These two marker proteins of the endolysosomal system [44] were present in these virion-containing vacuoles ( Figure S1 ). Altogether, these characteristics indicate that these vacuoles are expanded endolysosomal compartments. Interestingly, both types of virions could be observed in ER and LVCVs, but only the smaller dark mature virions were found in the endolysosomal compartments.",

At 24 h p.i., 2% of the cell sections started to show visible signs of infection, and this percentage gradually increased over time until it reached 84% at 72 h p.i. (Figure 3A) .

In particular, the percentage of cell profiles containing a specific structure was determined for each p.i. timepoint ( Figure 3B ,C). DMVs were one of the first structures to be detected, and they were observed in about 2% of cell sections at 24 h p.i. The number of cell sections positive for these vesicles gradually increased over time, reaching a maximum of 38% at 60 h p.i. ( Figure 3B ). Interestingly, the localization and morphology of the DMVs changed over the course of the PEDV infection ( Figure S2 ). At early timepoints, i.e., 24 and 36 h p.i., DMVs had always a regular circular shape and they were distributed throughout the cytoplasm in small clusters of less than five DMVs. From 48 h p.i. onwards, DMVs became organized in larger clusters, with 10 or more vesicles, and mostly were found in the perinuclear region of the cell. The DMVs invaginations also became more pronounced from 48 h p.i. CMs were initially detected at 24 h p.i., but only in 0.5% of cells ( Figure 3B and Figure S2 ). They became more apparent at 36 h p.i., reaching a plateau at 60 h p.i. The CMs were always found in between or around the cluster of DMVs. A dramatic change in the percentage of CMs was observed at 60 h p.i., increasing from 6% to 21%, when the DMVs also increased markedly. Overall, these data indicated that the CMs are structures that are functionally connected with DMVs, as previously reported [15] .",

It has previously been shown that LVCVs are expanded Golgi stacks [12, 29] . Therefore, we decided to quantify at the ultrastructural level the number of cell sections displaying the presence of at least one Golgi complex over the course of the PEDV infection ( Figure 4A,B) . During the first 48 h after the inoculum, the number of cell sections displaying this organelle did not change noticeably ( Figure 4B ). The Golgi complex, however, was practically no more detectable with its known morphology (i.e., a series of adjacent stacks) from 60 h p.i., at the exact same timepoint when the LVCVs became prominent ( Figure 4B) . Interestingly, the percentage of cell sections with LVCVs at the late p.i. timepoints was similar to those of cell sections with Golgi prior to exposure to PEDV. Altogether, these data indicated that, as for MHV and TGEV [12, 29] , the LVCVs originate from ERGIC/Golgi, which probably expand as a consequence of a large local production of virions.",

These structures have not been detected in other CoV infections and therefore they could be specifically induced by PEDV.

We named those structures irregular vesicle clusters (IVCs).",

In non-infected cells, GM130-labelled Golgi localized perinuclearly ( Figure 4G ) [47] . GM130 lost its compact organization in infected cells, recognized by dsRNA staining, and became more scattered throughout the cytoplasm in numerous puncta at 24 h p.i. (Figure 4G ). At 72 h p.i., the distribution of the GM130 signal changed again, forming cytoplasmic clusters, but those had a less compact shape compared to the ones observed in uninfected cells. We did not observe a colocalization between dsRNA and GM130 at any timepoint, indicating that the Golgi membranes very likely do not contribute to the establishment of the PEDV replication sites ( Figure 4G ). When the same samples were labeled with another Golgi protein marker, GIANTIN [48] , and one for the trans-Golgi network, TGN46 [48] , and analyzed by immunofluorescence, we detected the same reorganization of the Golgi in infected cells as that observed for GM130 ( Figure S3C,D) .",

The ER proliferation first appeared at 8 h and reached a peak at 24 h p.i., before becoming less prominent during the following hours of infection ( Figure 5C ). These changes in the ER area were confirmed by estimating the ER surface area using the point-hit method ( Figure 5D ). Interestingly, the ER proliferation alleviation starting from 24 h p.i. coincided with the emergence of ER-derived structures, such as DMVs, CMs, and virion-positive ER, in the infected cells ( Figure 5C ). Next, we confirmed that the ERBs as well as the virion-containing compartments seen in Figure 1C originate from ER by immuno-EM analysis using an anti-KDEL antibody ( Figure 5E ,F and Figure S4 ). Since the ERBs only appeared from 48 h p.i. and increased gradually afterwards ( Figure 5C ), this observation suggests that these structures are probably not functionally connected with ER proliferation.",

            "text": "The description of the membrane remodeling induced by PEDV in host cells remains poorly described despite the increasing veterinary importance of this virus [40, 51] . This type of information is also scarce for \u03b1-CoV in general, as the infection of only two other viruses belonging to this genus, i.e., HCoV-NL36 and TGEV, have been characterized at the ultrastructural level so far [23, 29, 33] . HCoV-NL36 and TGEV virions have been observed in ER, Golgi, and LVCVs, while DMVs were solely detected in cells exposed to HCoV-NL36. Thus, although those studies have revealed some similarities between the host membrane rearrangements caused by \u03b1-CoV and members of the other CoV genera, a temporal and comprehensive description of all morphological alterations induced in host cells by \u03b1-CoV is still lacking. The limitation in the ultrastructural studies on HCoV-NL36 and TGEV has been the analysis of a single infection timepoint, which makes it difficult to obtain a complete repertoire of induced intracellular structures, because their frequency and morphology change over the course of an infection, as shown for MHV [12] . Therefore, we decided to take a time-course approach to examine PEDV infection in Vero E6 cells by qualitative and quantitative EM. In addition to structures like DMVs and LVCVs, already shown to be induced by \u03b1-CoV, this strategy allowed us to detect structures such as CMs, that have been reported for other CoV, as well as novel structures, such as IVCs and ERBs. It has recently been reported that PEDV triggers autophagy [52] , but we did not observe evidence in our samples indicating an induction of this pathway. In particular, we did not detect autophagosomes, which are morphologically different than the observed DMVs. These latter are much smaller (180-280 versus 500-1500 nm [53] ) and they do present cytoplasmic component in their interior.",

Considering the functional interrelationship between DMVs and ER [15, 45, 50] , one hypothesis is that the ER proliferates to accommodate the increasing mass of viral proteins that will form the DMVs and luminal virions.

ERBs have a geometrical organization and are connected with the ER ( Figure 1F ). Their ER origin is also demonstrated by the fact that they are positive for the ER marker peptide KDEL ( Figure 5D ,E). These observations render the ERBs reminiscent of the TBs and CMSs induced by MHV and SARS-CoV [12, 16, 17, 31] . TBs and CMSs also appear at the late stage of an infection and contain a single viral protein, which self-aggregates when massively overproduced. As a result, it is tempting to speculate that ERBs also represent aggregates formed by one or more PEDV proteins that are present in the ER in elevated amounts. The morphological differences between ERBs, TBs, and CMSs are probably due to a difference in the structural and self-aggregating properties of the proteins that lead to their formation.",

            "text": "In our study, we observed virions in several compartments, i.e., ER, LVCVs, endolysosomal organelles, and very rarely in the ERBs ( Figure 1C-F) . However, we first detected them forming in both ER and LVCVs at the same timepoint (i.e., 24 h p.i.). This is in contrast with what has been reported for CoV belonging to other subfamilies, i.e., their viral particles assemble in the ERGIC/Golgi compartments [12, 56] , but also TGEV. The virions of this \u03b1-CoV start to form in the ERGIC/Golgi compartment and only at later timepoint in the ER [29] . The reason behind these differences might be due to differences between genera, viruses, and/or infected cell types. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that PEDV particles assemble in both the ER and Golgi complex. PEDV virions were also detected in what appear to be endolysosomal-like compartments from 36 h p.i., but, intriguingly, we never noted them assembling on the limiting membrane of these organelles. Altogether, these observations lead us to postulate that the endolysosomal compartments are not the site of viral particle assembling, but rather a location where excess virions are nonspecifically delivered, or that could eventually represent a transport for intermediates involved in the secretion of viral particles. Alternatively, the virions observed in the endolysosomal compartments could be secreted viral particles that are re-infecting cells through endocytosis. Very interestingly, we observed two types of virions appearing simultaneously ( Figure 1C,D) , which have been so far described exclusively in cells exposed to another \u03b1-CoV, TGEV, suggesting that this could be a unique characteristic of this CoV genus [29] . In the morphological study of TGEV-infected cells [29] , smaller viral particles with denser cores were identified as mature virions, while larger annular ones were noted as the immature precursors. Our observations suggest that PEDV virion maturation does not occur in a specific organelle, as both types of viral particles were found to be present in the ER and LVCVs ( Figure 1C,D) , indicating the structural maturation of PEDV virion particles could happen in both the ER and LVCVs. This result is in part dissimilar from that obtained from the study of TGEV, where it was shown that virion maturation mainly takes place in the Golgi [29] . Again, this difference could be specific to the virus or the infected cell type. Another possibility is that some mature virions are retro-transported to the ER after maturation in the Golgi due to their local massive production. Interestingly, we also found that only mature virions are present in the compartments of the endolysosomal system ( Figure 1E ), further supporting one of our hypotheses made above.",
