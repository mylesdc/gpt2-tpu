Autoimmunity plays an important role in this pathology outcome and body's own immune system attacks on the myelin sheath causing the damage. The etiology of the disease is partially understood and the response to treatment cannot easily be predicted. Results: We presented the results obtained using 8 genetically predisposed randomly chosen individuals reproducing both the absence and presence of malfunctions of the Teff-Treg cross-balancing mechanisms at a local level. For simulating the absence of a local malfunction we supposed that both Teff and Treg populations had similar maximum duplication rates. Results presented here suggest that presence of a genetic predisposition is not always a sufficient condition for developing the disease. Other conditions such as a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate and allow peripheral tolerance should be involved.",

It features an extensive documentation and multiple tutorials and a worldwide community that furnishes great support. It is free and open-source and cross-platform. NetLogo represents a good choice to simulate multi-agents, networks and complex dynamical systems [46] . Another choice for developing the ABM model was represented by the use of a general purpose computer language, for example ANSI C. We used such an approach several times [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . However, NetLogo allowed a faster developing of the model as, at this stage, we did not manage a large quantity of details, entities and interactions. Moreover models developed in NetLogo can be easily shared as Java applets i.e., they are able to be run in almost (if not all) computer platforms. Finally NetLogo models take advantage of the graphical interface that easily allows the plot of various entities dynamics. Of course the implementation of a more detailed model would require the flexibility and the speed given by the use of a pure programming language. For huge simulations, parallel computing is highly advisable and the use of a programming language as C is imperative.",

To this end we built a model that uses a grid of 51x51 cells (namely patches) to simulate a small portion of white matter. Every patch is colored in light gray and is initialized at the beginning of the simulation with non-zero quantity init_mye of myelin that covers the axons in healthy patients. In order to simulate recoverable and unrecoverable damage, we supposed that every patch that is attacked by Teff loses a given value of myelin ate_mye, in this case the patch is colored in dark gray to simulate the presence of damage. If the patch still contains a quantity of myelin that is greater than zero, the damage can be recovered (recoverable damage) at every time-step with a given rate rec_mye up to the initial quantity init_mye; otherwise (i.e. the remaining quantity of myelin is zero) the patch is colored in black and the damage cannot be recovered anymore (unrecoverable damage). This mechanism is supported by several facts in reality. Resident oligodendrocytes (if still present) are activated and are able to restore the lost percentage of myelin [11] . We used a time-step of \u0394(t) = 2.4 hours. We chose such a time-step because it allowed to keep, from a temporal point of view, a good degree of granularity that enabled to simulate singular relapses, yet allowing to reproduce, using reasonable computational resources, the progress of the disease in a time-window of five years (18250 time steps).",

As suggested in [54] , the introduction of agents using stochastic impulses is advisable in order to gain more realistic and general understanding of the effect of environmental fluctuations leading to extinction of the species. Gaussian white noise assumes the presence of a continuous perturbation, and this is not in line with thymic selection where the selection newborn resting T cells with a given specificity can be seen a sequence of discrete stochastic events. As in the paper by V\u00e9lez de Mendiz\u00e1bal et al. [13] , both the introduction of resting Teff and Treg is done using trains of 100 randomly distributed impulses per year. This reflected the fact that the generation of a given self-reacting T-cells can be seen as a consequence of unrelated stochastic events [55] . Also viruses are introduced with the same technique.",

Of course other conditions may be the cause of such a malfunctioning.",

            "text": "In this work, we presented the first simple model of MS using agent based modeling approach. It shows the main behavior of this neural disease i.e., the relapse-remitting one. Compared to the real biological scenario, the model is naive, but takes into account the main entities involved at cellular level in the pathogenesis of MS. It allows to grasp how the role of regulatory vs effectors cells and their internal dynamics are crucial in the understanding the evolution of neural damage in the progression of the pathology. We will continue working with this model to Simulation of eight randomly-selected hill virtual patients. We suppose that the breakdown of the cross regulation mechanism is due to a lower duplication rate p t of Treg. Simulation time is 5 years (18250 time-steps). Red lines represent activated Teff behaviors, blue lines represent activated Treg behaviors and green lines viruses behaviors. In this case the number of Teff peaks is higher. Moreover each peak reaches higher values in respect to healthy patients, thus indicating that higher numbers of selfreactive Teff may entitle higher probabilities of having unrecoverable damage. Red lines represent activated unrecoverable damage, blue lines represent recoverable damage and black lines total damage (recoverable + unrecoverable). Some spikes on the recoverable damage curves are present. However such damage is usually recovered in healthy patients, as at the end of simulations the total damage is mostly 0. Red lines represent activated unrecoverable damage, blue lines represent recoverable damage and black lines total damage (recoverable + unrecoverable). In this case it is possible to observe more frequent spikes in the reversible damage curves. Furthermore unrecoverable damage (that can be correlated with the appearing MS plaques) is also present. Figure 6 Spatial plot at the end of the simulation in healthy patients. Figure gives a spatial representation of the simulated scenario (i.e. a small portion of brain tissues) at the end of the simulation for eight randomly-selected healthy virtual patients. Light green patches represent non-damaged areas. Dark green patches (see for example plot (c)) represent areas with recoverable damage. Black patches (see for example plot (b), yellow circle) represent areas with unrecoverable damage. Red dots represent activated Teff and blue dots represent activated Treg. Green dots represent viruses. White and black dots represent resting Teff and Treg, respectively.",
