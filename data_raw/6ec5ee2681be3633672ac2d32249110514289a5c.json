In the USA, prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in males over the age of 50 years and ranks as the second deadliest cancer in males [4, 5] . Traditional treatments for prostate cancer include prostectomy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and hormone deprivation therapy [5] . These treatments can impair the quality of life for patients and thus new approaches to combating prostate cancer are warranted [4] . Several groups are exploring methods for harnessing the immune system to recognize and kill prostate cancer cells [2] . One such effort has led to Sipuleucel-T, a licensed, autologous cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer [6] . Additional immunotherapies for prostate cancer now under development include a number of vaccine candidates, as well as approaches using targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) [7] .",

Levels of PSMA are further elevated on prostate cancer cells, and studies indicate a strong correlation between increased PSMA expression and prostate cancer progression [4, 5] . PSMA expression levels can also be elevated on other malignant cells including those of urologic origin (i.e., kidney and bladder) suggesting this glycoprotein may play a role in their oncogenic progression as well [11] . In other solid tumors including colon, ovarian, breast, and kidney cancers, elevated PSMA expression has been observed on tumor neovasculature, but not normal vasculature suggesting a role for PSMA in angiogenesis [12] . Unlike prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PMSA is a membrane protein which makes it an attractive target to develop mAbs against it for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes [13] . Several therapeutic anti-PSMA mAbs have been developed, and many of these have been used in radioimmunotherapy for targeting cytotoxic radionucleotides, specifically to PSMAexpressing cells [5] . Some anti-PSMA mAbs, such as clone 2C9, have been demonstrated to mediate a therapeutic effect by promoting an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) effect that kills prostate cancer cells [5, 14] .",

Recently, our group has explored developing synthetic DNA plasmids as a means of delivering the genes of MAbs that neutralize infectious agents. We have reported that constructs expressing DNA-encoded monoclonal antibody (DMAb) can direct in vivo production of functional levels of antibody targeting human immunodeficiency, dengue, and chikungunya viruses in mice [15] [16] [17] . Such an approach possesses several advantages over both conventional protein-based mAbs and viral vector-based delivery of antibody genes including; (1) lower production costs; (2) the ability to generate durable, high levels of in vivo antibody production without gene integration; and (3) the ability for repeated administrations due to the non-immunogenic nature of DNA plasmids. While early applications of DNA plasmid technology suffered due to poor in vivo transgene production, recent enhancements in the design of DNA vectors along with new delivery methods including adaptive in vivo electroporation (EP) have combined to boost transgene expression to potent levels in clinical vaccine studies, without compromising safety [18] .",

Injected mice were bled at various time points post-injection to obtain sera that was evaluated by ELISA to quantitate human IgG levels. Human IgG became detectable in sera of injected mice beginning on day 5 post-injection, with peak levels achieved at day 14 post-injection in both C57BL/6 nude (1.17 \u00b1 0.41 \u03bcg/ml, Fig. 2a ) and C57BL/6 (0.82 \u00b1 0.11 \u03bcg/ml, Fig. 2b ) mice. While elevated human IgG levels persisted in C57BL/6 nude mice beyond 50 days, the levels in C57BL/6 mice dropped to baseline values by day 35 post-injection likely due to the mouse anti-human antibody response [21, 22] . Serum collected at day 14 post-injection from PSMA-DMAb plasmid-injected C57BL/6 nude mice was evaluated by ELISA (Fig. 2c) and Western blot (Fig. 2d) to evaluate the affinity and specificity of serum IgG for recombinant human PSMA.

Mice were followed for up to 56 days with regular measurements of tumor size made on each mouse during this period (Fig. 6a) . Tumors in the pVax1-treated mice began to grow at day 7-10 post-implantation, while tumors were not detectable in PSMA-DMAb-treated mice until days 15-17. Rapid tumor growth was noted for the control groups (pVax1), but the PSMA-DMAb-treated group exhibited an obvious suppression of tumor growth due to the antibody-mediated tumor-protective immunity. Over the course of the 56-day observation period, there was a statistically significant reduction in average tumor volumes (p = 0.0201) (Fig. 6b) and a significant improvement in survival (p = 0.0280) in mice receiving the PSMA-DMAb construct compared to the control mice (Fig. 6c) . It is likely that this effect might be further enhanced in the absence of the mouse anti-human antibody response. Visual inspection (Fig. 6d) that developed in each group revealed that the tumors in the PSMA-DMAb group were impacted early and remained small and subdermal, while tumors in the pVax1 control group protruded out of the skin and became ulcerated.",

Natural killer cells express high levels of Fc\u03b3Rs, therefore we also examined the contribution of NK cells to the observed effects of PSMA-DMAb on tumor growth. Previous studies have reported that human IgG can bind to all activating mouse Fc\u03b3Rs and can induce ADCC/ADCP with mouse NK cells and mouse macrophages [29] . Groups of mice were treated with either control IgG or the NK celldepleting anti-AGM1 IgG antibody and then implanted with TRAMP-C2 cells. One week later, mice were given a single injection of either pVax1 or PSMA-DMAb plasmid and were subsequently evaluated for tumor growth up to 56 days. There was a rapid onset of tumor development, accelerated tumor growth, and decreased survival in PSMA-DMAbimmunized, NK cell-depleted mice (p = 0.0019, Fig. 6e ), but not in those pretreated with the control IgG. Taken together, these data demonstrate that PSMA-DMAb can exert a profound therapeutic effect on a PSMA-expressing tumor in vivo, supporting the possible application of this therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.

A DNA plasmid encoding the V H and V L segments of a human anti-PSMA mAb was constructed and demonstrated to direct the expression of full-length, antigen-specific IgG in vitro and in vivo following electroporation-enhanced injection into the muscles of mice. PSMA is highly expressed on prostate carcinoma as well as other tumor cells, and it is considered an attractive target for antibody-based therapy due to its expression on the surface of cells. PSMA-DMAb in the serum of mice injected with PSMA-DMAb plasmid was able to bind to PSMA on the surface of the TRAMP-C2 and LNCaP prostate tumor cell lines and to sections of bladder and kidney tumors. Serum antibody levels of 1-2 \u03bcg/ml were achieved in mice injected with the PSMA-DMAb plasmid by day 14 post-administration, and the antibody remained detectable in the sera for several weeks. Importantly, PSMA-DMAb retained the ability to recognize PSMA on the surface of implanted tumor cells and to mediate a potent anti-tumor response in vivo, due at least in part through interacting with and no antibody, and a rPSMA-mAb as a positive control were used. Luciferase activity was measured. Results are representative data from two independent experiments. b Flow cytometric analysis of the effects of sera collected from PSMA-DMAb plasmid-administered mice on LNCaP cell death. Day 14 sera were incubated with LNCaP cells in the absence or presence of human PBMCs. Following washing, cells were stained with Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI), according to the manufacturer's assay specifications. Gated FACS scan panels are shown for the various treatments: pVax1 control (10 \u03bcg), 1 or 10 \u03bcg PSMA-DMAb and non-treated cell control. Figure illustrates a representative experiment out of two performed independently NK cells to mediate ADCC/ADCP of tumor cells. ADCC has been hypothesized to be the major mechanism mediating the anti-tumor activity of mAbs targeting diverse malignancies [7] .",

            "text": "Several mAbs targeting tumor-specific antigens or immunomodulatory molecules are in use or under development for cancer immunotherapy regimens, but there are impediments to their widespread use [7, 31] . One of the primary impediments involves the cost of the treatment regimen stemming from the laborious, time-consuming manufacturing and purification processes associated with making these protein-based drugs [2, 7, 14] . Additionally, multiple infusions of mAbs are often required to attain and maintain their efficacy, which imposes further cost and logistical constraints on patients [31] . Given these challenges, alternative approaches to generate and deliver mAbs are important. Gene-based administration approaches are focused on delivering the genes encoding protective antibodies so that the antibodies can be generated in vivo in a sustained manner. Several groups have developed viral vectors for delivery of mAb genes and have shown that these vectors can be used to drive production of mAbs in vivo [2, 13] . However, viral vector delivery of genes carries its own challenges, such as high development and distribution costs as well as the potential for neutralization of gene delivery and the inability to re-dose patients because of immune responses generated against the viral vector.",

Primary among these is the potential for significantly lower costs were measured weekly, in mice for up to 56 days post-tumor administration. c Kaplan-Meier curves (n = 10) showed the tumor survival time of mice in the pVax1 and PSMA-DMAb groups. d Representative mice with TRAMP-C2 tumors from pVax1 and PSMA-DMAb plasmid-injected groups at day 56 post-tumor administration. e Kaplan-Meier curves (n = 10) show the effect of NK cell depletion on PSMA-DMAb-mediated tumor survival time stemming from lower manufacturing costs of DNA plasmids, as well as lower distribution costs because DNA is more stable and simple to produce. Synthetic DNA vectors delivered into muscle or skin with the aid of adaptive electroporation can produce high and durable levels of in vivo transgene expression without integration, and there is abundant clinical data that speaks to its favorable safety profile [18] . Since DNA plasmids are non-immunogenic, multiple administrations of the same or different plasmids can be contemplated for delivery. This feature is particularly important if serum antibody levels decrease or another antibody treatment is required. This is the first report describing the use of a DNA plasmid-based delivery system to direct in vivo generation of a therapeutic mAb that targets a relevant oncology target, PSMA. It is also the first report to illustrate functional engagement of host NK-immune clearance by a DNA-vectored mAb. Due to the flexibility of this platform, combination of DMAb plasmids with other anticancer treatments or immunotherapy agents is important to consider. Furtherr study of this approach for neoplastic disease is warranted.",
