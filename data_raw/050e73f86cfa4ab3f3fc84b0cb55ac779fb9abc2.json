LACV is a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in North America and infects up to 300,000 persons each year of which 70-130 result in severe disease of the central nervous system (CNS). As an initial step in the establishment of useful animal models to support vaccine development, we examined LACV infectivity, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in both weanling mice and rhesus monkeys.",

The peripheral site where LACV replicates to highest titer is the nasal turbinates, and, presumably, LACV can enter the CNS via the olfactory neurons from nasal olfactory epithelium. The mouse infectious dose 50 and lethal dose 50 was similar for LACV administered either intranasally or intraperitoneally. LACV was highly infectious for rhesus monkeys and infected 100% of the animals at 10 PFU. However, the infection was asymptomatic, and the monkeys developed a strong neutralizing antibody response.",

Ae. triseriatus feed on Eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus grinseus) and Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) which serve as amplifying hosts for LACV [7] [8] [9] . Interestingly, the virus can be maintained in the mosquito population in the absence of vertebrate hosts by transovarial (vertical) transmission, thus allowing the virus to over-winter in mosquito eggs [9] . More recently, LACV has been isolated from naturally infected, non-native Aedes albopictus mosquito [10] .

Currently, a vaccine or specific antiviral treatment is not available, but could serve to reduce the clinical and economic impact of this common infection.",

LACV administered subcutaneously to suckling mice first replicates in muscle, and viremia develops with virus invading the brain across vascular endothelial cells [28] [29] [30] [31] . Virus replication in muscle was confirmed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and the predominant cell type infected in the CNS is the neuron [28, 32] . The virulence of LACV for mice decreases with increasing age, similar to humans in which it causes CNS disease predominantly in pediatric populations [13, 28] . As an initial step in the establishment of animal models useful for vaccine development for humans, we sought to better characterize the tissue tropism of LACV in mice by identifying the tissues that support LACV replication after peripheral inoculation. We have previously described Swiss Webster mice as suitable for characterization of LACV infection at birth and at 3weeks of age [6] . Here we inoculated 3-week old Swiss Webster mice with either 1 or 100 LD 50 of virus intraperitoneally. Twenty tissues were individually collected for six consecutive days and processed for virus titration, immunohistochemical staining, and histopathology studies.",

In this study, rhesus monkeys were infected intramuscularly or subcutaneously with a mosquito or human isolate of LACV. These two isolates were used since preliminary genomic sequence analysis indicate that there are host specific differences between LACV isolated from humans and mosquitos [6] . LACV was found to be highly infectious for rhesus monkeys, but infection did not result in viremia, disease, or significant changes in blood chemistries or cell counts. However, high titers of neutralizing antibodies developed in all monkeys indicating that rhesus monkeys, although not optimal, will be useful for studying the infectivity and immunogenicity of LACV vaccine candidates.",

Following inoculation of either dose, virus could first be detected in tissue near the inoculation site such as inguinal lymph nodes, spleen, and ovaries/uterus. Virus was detected in serum on days 1-3, but rarely on subsequent days even in moribund mice. By day three, virus distribution was widespread and could be found in the majority of tissues sampled, albeit at very low levels with titers rarely exceeding those found in serum. The highest virus titers detected were present in nasal turbinates, brain, and spinal cord.

Previous LACV pathogenesis studies in suckling mice inoculated subcutaneously with a mosquito isolate of LACV demonstrated that viral antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of striated muscles, the interscapular brown fat, and the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of small arteries and veins [28] . When virus was first detected in the brain, it was confined to cerebral vascular endothelial cells but later spread to neurons. The authors suggest that the late infection of the dorsal route ganglion indicates that the virus does not penetrate the CNS via nerves but rather by vascular endothelial cells [28] . This previous model therefore suggests that virus first replicates in muscle cells leading to the development of viremia with subsequent hematogenous spread to the CNS, and we sought in the present study to examine if this pattern of infection also occurred in weanling mice. In weanling mice inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 or 100 LD 50 of LACV, virus was first detected on days 1 -3 in tissues near the inoculation site. At either dose, virus was no longer detectable by days 4 and 5 in these tissues, suggesting that it was rapidly cleared by the innate immune system. Interestingly, the virus was not detected in muscle tissue until day 3 post inoculation and clearly did not preferentially infect this tissue. Rather, outside the CNS, the virus replicated to highest titers in the nasal turbinates and appears to spread from this site into the brain. Immunohistochemical staining of the nasal turbinate tissue was not sensitive enough to identify the LACV infected cells, but is thought LACV may gain access to the CNS via cells in the nasal turbinates. This suggestion is offered with the caveat that respiratory epithelial cells could also have been infected, but the magnitude of the infection could not be detected with the IHC staining. To travel from the nasal olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb, the virus a Days with significant number of monkeys 1 SD from the pre-inoculation mean (day -7 and 0 combined) are boxed (chi square, p < 0.05, n = 16), mean values displayed. b Abbreviations: MCV-mean corpuscular volume, MCH-mean corpuscular hemoglobin, MCHC-mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations, ASTaspartate aminotransferase, ALT-alanine aminotransferase, ALP-alkaline phosphatase, BUN-blood urea nitrogen. c Pre-inoculation mean determined from samples collected on days -7 and 0 post inoculation.",

A mammalian host that drinks the water would intake both fluid, which might contain free virus from lysed larvae, and infected larvae, either of which could initiate an infection in the mammalian host. Thus, exposure to such water could lead to an alternate route of infection for the natural hosts, i.e., the oral/nasal route in addition to the vectorbourne route.

Mice were able to control virus infection at doses at or below the LD 50, and developed strong neutralizing antibody responses. The LACV ID 50 for humans is unknown, but if human exposure is limited to a small dose, the virus may be effectively controlled by the immune system and CNS infection may be averted. If, like our mouse model, an individual is exposed to a greater dose of virus, virus growth may outpace control mechanisms leading to CNS infection. To further support the role of immune control affecting human disease outcome, it has been shown that individuals residing in endemic areas with major histocompatibility complex molecule B49 on CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (HLA-B49) had a greater relative risk of developing encephalitis after infection (relative risk 17.65, \u03c7 2 = 7.3, P < 0.1).

LACV is highly infectious both by the IP and IN routes suggesting that infection of natural mammalian hosts such as the chipmunk or squirrel might occur by the oral/intranasal route in addition to the bite of an infected mosquito. In rhesus monkeys, LACV is highly infectious with as little as 10 PFU resulting in the development of neutralizing antibodies, but clinical disease is not observed at any dose tested, suggesting that rhesus monkeys will be useful for studying the infectivity and immunogenicity of live attenuated virus vaccine candidates, but will be of limited usefulness for the evaluation of their level of attenuation.",
