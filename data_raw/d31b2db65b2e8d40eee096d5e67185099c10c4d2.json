Thus, we investigated the importance of basal autophagy for HSV-2 infection, using pharmacological autophagy suppression or cells genetically deficient in an autophagy-essential gene (ATG5). Interference with basal autophagy flux in cells significantly reduced viral replication and diminished the infection. These results indicate that basal autophagy plays an indispensable role required for a productive infection. Importantly, this study draws a sharp distinction between induced and basal autophagy, where the former acts as a viral clearance mechanism abrogating infection, while the latter supports infection.",

HSV-2 genital disease represents a top-alert condition due to the fact that the virus may be transmitted from mothers to neonates causing a neonatal infection with high mortality rate 5,6 and the fact that HSV-2 infection is a serious risk factor for HIV infection, enhancing HIV acquisition rate by 3-4 fold 7,8 .

During conditions of nutrient deficiency, autophagy is induced to maintain energy pools in the cell, and prevent translational arrests, cell cycle delays or cell death [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . At the basal levels, autophagy plays other important homeostatic functions such as clearance of protein aggregates, and damaged organelles 12-14 .

HSV-2 ICP34.5 shares some common features with HSV-1 ICP34.5 and also shows differences 26-28 . For example, HSV-2 ICP34.5 gene, contrary to HSV-1 ICP34.5, contains an intron and undergoes alternative splicing, yielding various structurally unique splice-variants 27 and protein products 28 . However, whether HSV-2 ICP34.5 inhibits autophagy responses in cells, similarly to HSV-1 ICP34.5, remains to be established. Very little is known about the role of autophagy in HSV-2 infection. Therefore, we investigated the role of autophagy in regulating HSV-2 infection. Our results demonstrate that basal autophagy, which is maintained at stable levels during productive HSV-2 infection, is required for successful HSV-2 infection, as its disruption prevented infection to a great extent.",

In response to HSV-1 infection, we previously found that autophagy levels may be slightly inhibited, or in most cases remain unchanged, during productive HSV-1 infection 29 . The autophagic response to HSV-2 infection was not previously assessed. Thus we monitored autophagy flux in cells during HSV-2 infection using sequestosome1 (or p62) immunoblotting. p62 is a protein that is degraded mainly by autophagy and thus its levels represent a reliable indicator of autophagy flux in cells [30] [31] [32] . Id est, accumulation of p62 marks suppression of the autophagy flux, whereas its depletion reflects autophagy induction [30] [31] [32] . We found that HSV-2 infection does not cause any significant changes in autophagy flux in host cells (Fig. 1a-d) . This result indicated that HSV-2, similarly to HSV-1, prevents autophagy induction in response to infection, but meanwhile maintains the basal autophagy activity of the host mostly unhampered.",

To investigate such a role of autophagy in HSV-2 infection, we used pharmacological means to suppress cellular autophagy levels. First, we used chloroquine to suppress autophagy. We found that chloroquine treatment of the cells led to reduced viral yields in cells (data not shown). Various chemical agents have been classically used in the field to suppress autophagy, however some of these agents suffer from side effects that make it difficult to interpret whether the results are directly caused by autophagy. For example, 3-methyladenine, a commonly used autophagy inhibitor, was also reported to enhance basal autophagy despite suppressing starvation-induced autophagy 33 . In addition, chloroquine and vinblastine were shown to cause autophagy-complicating nonspecific effects such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition 34 . In a comparative study testing various side effects of autophagy inhibitors, bafilomycin A1 (BFN), a well-known autophagy inhibitor that blocks fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes 35 , was shown to have least nonspecific effects, and no effect on mTOR activity, in treated cells in contrast to other agents tested 34 . Thus, we decided to confirm the chloroquine preliminary finding with a more specific autophagy inhibitor, BFN.",

We then confirmed BFN-mediated suppression of autophagy through p62 and LC3 immunoblotting. Suppression of basal autophagy by BFN was confirmed by the accumulation of p62 along with LC3-II (Fig. 2a ). To rule out any possible effects of BFN on viral entry, we incubated the cells with HSV-2 for 2 hrs, and the cells were then untreated or treated with BFN. Using HSV-2-GFP virus, we monitored the progress of infection microscopically. We observed a significant drop in virus levels in BFN-treated, relative to mock-treated, cells (Fig. 2b,c) . To confirm this finding, we employed a quantitative FACS-based assay to measure virus yields in cells. We found that BFN-mediated block of autophagy suppressed viral yields and HSV-2 infection (Fig. 2d,e) . To further confirm, we determined virus levels in the cells via qPCR virus genome quantification. qPCR assay confirmed that BFN treatment significantly reduces HSV-2 infection (Fig. 2f) . Moreover, the possibility of cell death upon BFN treatment was ruled out (Fig. 2g) . These results demonstrated that suppression of basal autophagy in host cells interferes with viral replication and the progress of infection.",

Even at higher MOIs, ATG5 \u2212/\u2212 MEFs still showed significant block of infection ( Fig. 5a,b) . qPCR assay also showed that ATG5 knockout in cells dramatically diminishes the infection (Fig. 5c ). Finally, we determined virus titer from WT or ATG5 \u2212/\u2212 cells using plaque assay. While WT cells secreted approximately 10 2 -10 3 plaque-forming units (PFU)/monolayer, ATG5 \u2212/\u2212 cells secreted approximately 10 6 -10 7 PFU/ monolayer (Fig. 5d) . Additionally, in order to rule out the possibility that autophagy deficiency may interfere with virus entry into cells, we assessed internalized virus levels in WT or ATG5 \u2212/\u2212 cells. We found that autophagy deficiency does not affect virus entry into the cells (Fig. 5e ). Together, our results indicate that basal autophagic activity of the host cells supports HSV-2 infection, which is consistent with results of pharmacological autophagy inhibition (Fig. 2 ).",

Induction of autophagy was previously shown to enhance HSV-1 viral clearance and diminish viral growth 23, 39 . HSV-1 establishes virulence through inhibiting cellular autophagy 22, 23 , or at least preventing its activation 29 , during infection. In this study, we show that HSV-2 prevents autophagy induction but maintains the basal levels of the pathway (Fig. 1) . Although reports suggested that HSV-1 may inhibit autophagy via ICP34.5-mediated beclin1 binding while HSV-2 ICP34.5 was not tested for its ability to bind beclin1, our results may suggest that HSV-2 ICP34.5 also binds beclin1 to a certain extent; however this hypothesis remains to be experimentally investigated. Notably, a closely related \u03b1 -herpesvirus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which lacks the ICP34.5 gene can allow robust induction of autophagy responses to infection 40, 41 . Moreover, in similarity to HSV-2 results shown here, autophagy suppression downregulated VZV virus replication and growth in cells 40 . Thus, these findings together suggest that these different viruses may benefit from the autophagy pathway to varying extents and perhaps the viral autophagy-modulating genes serve to optimize or fine-tune the autophagy flux to levels that bolster each virus's growth, according to the differential reliance of each virus on autophagy. The present study provides insights that may support this concept which requires further work to be firmly established.",

Under certain autophagy-inducing conditions such as nutrient deficiency and some viral infections, autophagy may be induced above its constitutive levels. Induced autophagy qualifies the cell to adapt to drastic conditions and generate required energy from alternative sources, or to combat infections [12] [13] [14] 39, 42, 43 . On the other hand, basal autophagy performs various homeostatic and quality control functions such as preventing protein aggregation or limiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) production 37, 38 . Basal autophagy takes place at low or modest levels under normal conditions and regardless of the feeding conditions, as in embryogenesis 44 . A prominent example of basal autophagy is autophagy in neuronal cells and the brain. Autophagy in the brain proceeds at its basal levels, without significant induction even under nutritional deficiency (due to the fact that the brain can quickly compensate nutrient deficiency by relying on nutritional supply from other organs). Disruption of such basal autophagy leads to neurodegeneration, indicating that the role of basal autophagy is important for normal neuronal cell functioning and survival 45 . Moreover, suckling and non-suckling ATG7 \u2212/\u2212 mice all died at the same time, within 1 day of birth 38 , suggesting that the reason of death is not due to nutrient deprivation and that it may be due to disruption of a cellular function performed by basal autophagy. The absence of induced autophagy in HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection and persistence of basal autophagy suggest a role for this basal autophagy that supports infection (as we show here for HSV-2).",

            "text": "Another possibility for the reason of resistance of ATG5 \u2212/\u2212 cells to HSV-2 infection may be attributed to an aberrant proinflammatory cytokine response to infection in these cells. For example, HSV-1 blocks NALP3 (or NLRP3) inflammasome activity during the course of infection 49 . Inflammasomes induce maturation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines 50 , which represent powerful antiviral effectors [51] [52] [53] . Autophagy-deficient cells (lacking LC3B or beclin1) showed increased NALP3 inflammasome activity and caspase-1 levels, and exhibited enhanced inflammatory responses (e.g. interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 , and IL-18) to lipopolysaccharide in vitro and in vivo 54 . Autophagy could also limit inflammasome activity directly through targeting inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 for autolysosomal degradation 55 . Additionally, several autophagy proteins target components of the antiviral type-I interferon (IFN) response. Atg5-Atg12 blocks caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-mediated signaling and the downstream production of type I IFN 56, 57 . Also, Atg9 was shown to regulate STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) cytoplasmic localization and thus control IFN-I responses 58, 59 . It is thus possible to hypothesize that autophagy-deficient cells inherently possess elevated cytokine levels that help confer on these cells resistance to HSV-2 infection.",

First, autophagy-mediated removal of damaged organelles such as mitochondria (mitophagy) prevents accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Ref. 60) . ROS may induce NALP3 inflammasomes 61 , type-I IFN responses 62 , or cytokine production in response to infection 63 . Compounds that enhance ROS production suppress HSV infection 64 , while factors that relieve herpesvirus-induced oxidative stress 65 significantly enhance infection 66, 67 . Second, protein aggregation under autophagy-deficient conditions 38 could also present a reason for infection halt. Third, dysregulation, in ATG5 \u2212/\u2212 cells, of metabolism and turnover of metabolites known to regulate infection 68,69 may contribute to their resistance to HSV-2 infection. Finally, a distinct role of autophagy machinery in enodosomal trafficking and endolysosomal functions was recently reported 70 . Perhaps, impairment in autophagy-deficient cells of intracellular endosomal trafficking of viral, or infection-regulating cellular, components participates to infection suppression in these cells.",
