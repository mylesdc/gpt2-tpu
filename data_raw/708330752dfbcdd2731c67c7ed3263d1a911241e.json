            "text": "Foamy viruses (FVs) are globally prevalent retroviruses that establish apparently apathogenic lifelong infections. Feline FV (FFV) has been isolated from domestic cats with concurrent diseases, including urinary syndromes. We experimentally infected five cats with FFV to study viral kinetics and tropism, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) phenotype, urinary parameters, and histopathology. A persistent infection of primarily lymphoid tropism was detected with no evidence of immunological or hematologic perturbations. One cat with a significant negative correlation between lymphocytes and PBMC proviral load displayed an expanded FFV tissue tropism. Significantly increased blood urea nitrogen and ultrastructural kidney changes were noted in all experimentally infected cats, though chemistry parameters were not outside of normal ranges. Histopathological changes were observed in the brain, large intestine, and other tissues. In order to determine if there is an association of FFV with Chronic Kidney Disease, we additionally screened 125 Australian pet cats with and without CKD for FFV infection and found that FFV is highly prevalent in older cats, particularly in males with CKD, though this difference was not statistically significant compared to controls. Acute FFV infection was clinically silent, and while some measures indicated mild changes, there was no overt association of FFV infection with renal disease.",

            "text": "Feline foamy virus (FFV) is a retrovirus belonging to the ancient Spumaretrovirinae subfamily that infects domestic cats (Felis catus) and was originally discovered following development of cytopathic effects (CPEs) in feline cell lines [1, 2] . Foamy viruses (FVs) cause multiple CPEs in vitro including multinucleation, giant cell formation, and vacuolization, leading to cells looking \"foamy\" (and where the \"spuma\" originates) [1, [3] [4] [5] . In naturally-occurring and experimental infections of the domestic cat, however, FFV infection does not cause obvious disease, and has not been definitively associated with pathology despite establishing a persistent, life-long infection with a wide tissue tropism [3, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . It is believed the apathogenicity of FVs in general is due to long periods of co-evolution with their hosts that has led to a disease-free or highly-attenuated infection [2, 12, 13] . FV transmission is thought to primarily occur via salivary shedding and ongoing contact between animals, though alternate routes such as vertical transmission through lactating dams have been reported [7, 14] . In cats, biting and amicable prolonged contact, such as grooming, have been suggested as routes of transmission [7, 15, 16] . Global FFV prevalence in pet and feral domestic cats can be high and varies from 8 to 80% based on geographic location, population sampled, and assay type [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . FFV prevalence studies of cats in the USA have documented infection rates of 10 to 75%, with age and male sex identified as risk factors in some cohorts [7, 16, 27] .",

Zoonotic transmission of FFV to humans has not been detected thus far [12, 19, 35] . Because of the apparent apathogenicity, wide tissue tropism, and large vector cassette packaging capacity, FVs have been used to develop vaccine and gene therapy vectors in multiple species including cats and non-human primates as a model for human therapies [10, 13, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Many aspects about FV biology, including target cells, latency reservoirs, the specific receptor used for cell entry, viral kinetics over time following infection, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) population changes during infection have been poorly documented [6, 12, 43, 44] . Experimental FFV infection studies in disease-free specific-pathogen-free (SPF) domestic cats with age-matched negative controls using modern and specific assays are rare; the majority have been conducted with domestic cats kept as pets or from shelters [3, [6] [7] [8] 11, 38, 42, 45] .",

German and others reported histopathological changes in kidney and lung following experimental FFV inoculation [6] . A recent study of zoonotic infection with SFV in African hunters found alterations of urinary parameters including blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, among other hematological changes [30] . These findings in both cats and humans call into question whether chronic infections with FVs are truly apathogenic.",

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed renal diseases in cats, with prevalence rates reaching up to 85% in geriatric cats [57] [58] [59] . CKD is characterized by functional and structural loss of kidney tissue likely resulting from prolonged or repeated renal insults [60] [61] [62] [63] . As renal function declines, urine concentrating ability is lost and glomerular filtration rate falls, which eventually manifests as azotemia characterized by elevated BUN and serum creatinine. While the etiologies of CKD are often unknown, a list of comorbidities have been associated with the development of CKD, including retroviral infections [64] [65] [66] [67] .",

Due to the renal findings in this study and the detection of FFV in cats suffering from urinary disease, we sought to establish if there is an association between FFV and CKD in cats. We compared FFV prevalence rates in pet cats suffering from CKD in Australia (AU) (as measured by increased blood creatinine) and compared findings to age-matched cats without evidence of CKD. We hypothesized that (1) FFV causes subtle perturbations in immunological and hematological parameters in addition to histopathological changes that could potentially lead to disease in domestic cats, and that (2) FFV is associated with chronic kidney disease in cats. We identified mildly altered hematological and biochemical parameters associated with mild histopathological changes in the lung, brain, and other tissues, and ultrastructural changes in the kidney. We additionally found that while FFV is highly prevalent in AU, there was no direct association between FFV infection and CKD pathology in our sampled population.",

Cases were defined as CKD-positive (\"CKD\") if serum creatinine was elevated above the reference range, USG (measured concurrently) was <1.035, and clinical signs consistent with CKD were present [71] . Age-matched control samples were from non-azotemic clinically healthy cats with USG > 1.050.",

P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. For cat FFV5, the timeline following re-inoculation on day 53 with FFV was adjusted so that day 53 equaled day 0 pi. To have consistent timelines with the main FFV group, timepoints after day 53 for cat FFV5 were grouped with either the equivalent day or the nearest date post-inoculation to the cats in the FFV cohort. A Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to determine presence of a correlation and its significance between lymphocyte population numbers and FFV proviral load over time. To assess distributions of viral load to lymphocyte counts, we ran a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with the individual cat as a random factor and lymphocyte count as a fixed factor. Data were only run through the GLMM if viral load was at detectable levels and the data fit a negative binomial distribution.",

Given that both nPCR and ELISA were used to determine FFV infection, CKD analyses were performed on both assays' results to see if conclusions differed. If a chi-square test produced a P-value < 0.05, risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated as an additional post-hoc test. Risk ratios describe the probability of a health outcome occurring in an exposed group to the probability of the event occurring in a comparison, non-exposed group. A Risk ratio >1 suggests an increased risk of that outcome in the exposed group, and a risk ratio <1 suggests a reduced risk in the exposed group.

The tonsils of infected animals exhibited minimal (n = 1), mild (n = 3), and moderate (n = 1) lymphoid hyperplasia with multifocal infiltration of small numbers of lymphocytes beyond the capsule in one mildly affected animal. Two infected cats exhibited mild thyroiditis characterized by multifocal infiltrates of small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages within the interstitium and surrounding colloid-filled follicles of varying size.

Additionally, minimal (n = 3) to mild (n = 1) lymphoplasmacytic colitis was observed in FFV-infected cats, with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration into the submucosa that caused disruption of the submucosal architecture (n = 3), as well as small numbers of degenerate neutrophils scattered within the submucosa (n = 1).

Cat FFV5 also had small numbers of small lymphocytes within the meninges (lymphocytic meningitis) ( Figure 5C ). Scattered neurons within these regions were multifocally swollen, rounded, and demonstrated mild central dispersion of Nissl substance (chromatolysis), as well as rare, scattered neurons that exhibited hypereosinophilic and/or fragmented cytoplasm (potentially indicative of neuronal necrosis) (n = 2) ( Figure 5D ). One cat had mild multifocal lymphohistiocytic mastitis.

Provirus was primarily isolated from lymphoid tissues including PBMC, the retropharyngeal lymph node, and spleen as previously reported (Table 3) [6, 11, 27] . The expanded tissue tropism found in cat FFV3, with 10-fold higher PBMC proviral load than the other cats, also included the oral mucosa, suggesting that animals with higher viral loads could have dissemination to non-lymphoid sites. We were unable to detect virus in the tissues of one cat (FFV4) which also tended to have lower PBMC proviral load [10] . Viral RNA was detected once in the saliva of cat FFV4 ( Table 2 ), indicating that limited amounts of virus was being shed, and that salivary excretion may not correlate with widespread tissue distribution. A recently published report by Cavalcante and others on FFV-infected cats in Brazil found that pet and feral cats were more likely to be FFV positive in PBMC than in buccal swabs, as tested by PCR [83] . This has also been reported in primates due to a delay in salivary excretion of virus compared to blood [84] . A wide variability of FV positivity has been shown in different nonhuman primate species and even within the same species [85] [86] [87] . It is possible that due to the acute time period in our study, viral titer had not yet reached high enough levels in the oral cavity to be detected in the saliva.",

FFV-associated lung lesions have previously been noted in another experimental FFV infection study which reported mixed cellular infiltrates and eosinophilic fluid within alveolar walls [6] , similar to findings reported here. Alterations in CNS histopathology of FFV-infected cats suggest viral replication or associated inflammation as is seen in other retroviral infections [88] [89] [90] . FFV has previously been isolated from the CNS of cats, and may therefore indicate that FFV is capable of productive CNS infection and subtle neurologic alterations [91] . These findings suggest a potential role for FFV in the development of mild acute inflammation in a variety of parenchymal organs and brain. FFV proviral load did not appear to correlate to the presence or severity of histopathology and histopathological changes were observed in tissues that were not FFV PCR positive and vice-versa. The changes observed were mild and consistent with inflammation due to nonspecific immune stimulation, and cannot be unequivocally associated with FFV infection, which would be ideally confirmed by viral propagation from isolated tissues or immunohistochemistry [11] . Nevertheless, the findings of consistent mild inflammation in multiple tissues of SPF cats exposed to FFV suggest that microscopic alterations occur during acute FFV infection.",

Similar structures have been found in the central nervous system in both cats and humans. Cook and others described similar tubular structures as \"paramyxovirus nucleocapsid-like\" in the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes taken from demyelinating lesions in the optic nerve of three clinically healthy adult cats [95] . These inclusion-body like structures were of 16-17 nm in diameter and fused into penta-to septa-laminar shapes and 900 nm in length. The authors suggested a possible viral etiology. Wilcox and others (1984) reported similar structures in optic nerves and brains of 24 clinically healthy cats from which FFV was isolated [91] . While also finding 10-18 nm wide and 500 nm long structures, they also reported structures in much smaller shapes, appearing as \"short, disorganized fragments,\" located next to where budding virions were observed, in addition to intranuclearly. These structures were, however, found in the cytoplasm of cells that did not display CPEs and thus these lesions were not attributed to FFV but perhaps a morbillivirus [91] .",

            "text": "FFV was highly prevalent in Australian domestic cats as reported previously [16, 19] , and could be due to the lifestyle of Australian cats which are commonly allowed outside [96, 97] , allowing more opportunities to interact with other potentially infected cats. The samples analyzed also consisted of sera/plasma assayed by ELISA and whole blood analyzed by PCR. PCR is not as sensitive as ELISA for detection and can yield false negatives [8, 10, 16, 26, 72] , therefore it is possible that FFV prevalence is even higher in Australia. Similar prevalence rates in males (68%) and females (69%) indicates that there are no sex-related differences in prevalence rates in Australian pet cats [16] . A recent study of feral cats in the USA found an association between FFV infection and male sex [27] . However, our epidemiological results were obtained from client-owned desexed animals. Another epidemiological study of FFV in Australia did not find an association between sex and FFV infection in desexed domestic cats, but did see higher incidences of FFV in female feral cats [16] . Our findings suggest that while overall there appears to be no association between FFV and CKD, CKD in male cats may be associated with FFV infection, though any effect is mild, and evaluation of a much larger cohort is required to assess actual associations. Male sex has not been found to be an overall risk factor for CKD, however males can be overrepresented in certain age groups [98] .",

Evaluation of a multitude of hematologic and immunological parameters did not reveal significant host responses to infection. However, our detailed analysis of serum chemical and histopathological changes indicates sub-clinical alterations that could contribute to metabolic or degenerative diseases over time, supporting our hypothesis and work conducted by earlier researchers, and recent reports in humans [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 24, 30, 45, 47, [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . The negative correlation between lymphocyte count and viral load in one cat with higher viral load suggests that a differential susceptibility and potential pathogenicity may exist in some individuals. Studies with larger cohorts of animals with well-characterized disease phenotypes may reveal subtle relationships between FFV and feline health, since the virus is clearly widely distributed in free-ranging cat populations.",
