Investments in health research and development (R&D) have never been higher-global spending on health research increased from US$30 billion in 1990 to US$105.9 billion in 2001. But despite advances in technology and unparalleled research spending, the medical needs of many of the world's population go unmet. For example, only 1% of new drugs approved between 1975 and 1999 were specifi cally developed for tropical diseases and tuberculosis-diseases that account for over 10% of the global disease burden (Figure 1 ) [1] .",

Second, the system encourages counterfeiting-counterfeit drugs may represent up to 10% of the global market for pharmaceuticals [9] . Third, patented drugs are promoted through excessive marketing-on average, twice as much is spent on marketing a drug as on its R&D [10] .

This legally binding treaty covers all plant genetic resources relevant for food and agriculture. Through the treaty, countries agree to establish an effi cient, effective, and transparent multilateral system to facilitate access to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, and to share the benefi ts in a fair and equitable way. While there has been a growing consensus in development circles that more international public goods need to be supplied as part of the development strategy, increasing their provision will be infl uenced by the extent to which inspirational groups of individuals step in to play a leadership role to meet the collective need.",

New, effective drugs and diagnostics are urgently needed. (Photograph: Copyright Espen Rasmussen/MSF, Somalia, 2004)",
