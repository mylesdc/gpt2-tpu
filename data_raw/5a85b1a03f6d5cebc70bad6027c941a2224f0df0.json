The disease was observed in 6 young dachshunds pups of a litter from a breeding kennel and caused the death of 2 dogs. Upon full-genome analysis, the virus detected in one of the dead pups (strain Bari/411-13) was closely related to DogCVs that have been recently isolated in the USA. The present study, if corroborated by further reports, could represent a useful contribution to the knowledge of the pathogenic potential of DogCV and its association with enteritis in dogs.",

The other dogs completely recovered within 12-15 days after the onset of clinical signs. One dog carcass was frozen at 220uC after three days of storage at +4uC and sent to our Department for necropsy and laboratory investigations only after three months. Samples from the other dead dog and from the surviving animals were not available for additional analyses, as they were not collected timely.",

Similar to other animal circoviruses, the genome of strain Bari/ 411-13 contained two intergenic noncoding regions (203 and 135 nt in length) located between the start and stop codons, respectively, of the replicase and capsid protein genes. The 59intergenic region contains a thermodynamically stable stem-loop for initiation of rolling-circle replication and a conserved nonanucleotide motif, TAGTATTAC [13, 15] . On the bases of the similarity with other circoviruses, the origin of replication site for strain Bari/411-13 was predicted to consist of a palindromic sequence that includes dodecanucleotide pairs in the stem, whereas the loop is formed by the decanucleotide motif CATAGTATTA.

However, analysis of archival samples has revealed that this novel virus has been circulating in dogs for at least 5 years before being discovered [13] . The data gathered in this study extend the geographical distribution of DogCV to the European continent. In addition, our findings suggest a possible association between DogCV and canine enteritis. Unfortunately, the carcass of the CV-infected dog had been stored frozen for some months before being delivered to our laboratory. Long-term storage at low temperatures hindered the execution of histopathology, and valuable information on tissue localization and alterations of DogCV could not be gathered.",
