            "text": "Background: Infections by RNA viruses such as Influenza, HIV still pose a serious threat to human health despite extensive research on viral diseases. One challenge for producing effective prevention and treatment strategies is high intra-species genetic diversity. As different strains may have different biological properties, characterizing the genetic diversity is thus important to vaccine and drug design. Next-generation sequencing technology enables comprehensive characterization of both known and novel strains and has been widely adopted for sequencing viral populations. However, genome-scale reconstruction of haplotypes is still a challenging problem. In particular, haplotype assembly programs often produce contigs rather than full genomes. As a mutation in one gene can mask the phenotypic effects of a mutation at another locus, clustering these contigs into genome-scale haplotypes is still needed. Results: We developed a contig binning tool, VirBin, which clusters contigs into different groups so that each group represents a haplotype. Commonly used features based on sequence composition and contig coverage cannot effectively distinguish viral haplotypes because of their high sequence similarity and heterogeneous sequencing coverage for RNA viruses. VirBin applied prototype-based clustering to cluster regions that are more likely to contain mutations specific to a haplotype. The tool was tested on multiple simulated sequencing data with different haplotype abundance distributions and contig sizes, and also on mock quasispecies sequencing data. The benchmark results with other contig binning tools demonstrated the superior sensitivity and precision of VirBin in contig binning for viral haplotype reconstruction. Conclusions: In this work, we presented VirBin, a new contig binning tool for distinguishing contigs from different viral haplotypes with high sequence similarity. It competes favorably with other tools on viral contig binning. The source codes are available at: https://github.com/chjiao/VirBin.",

The genetic diversity could be caused by multiple infections of different strains or by mutations during the virus replication inside the host. In the latter case, the high replication rate, coupled with the low fidelity of the viral polymerase in most RNA viruses, results in a group of different but related strains infecting the same host, which is often termed as *Correspondence: yannisun@cityu.edu.hk 2 Electrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article \"quasispecies\" [6] . Previous studies have revealed that patients with chronic virus infections, such as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), are often the reservoir of new viral variants, which are likely produced during the replication process [7] . Because different strains could have very different biological properties such as virulence, transmissibility, antiviral drug resistance etc, characterizing the genetic diversity within viral populations is very important for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies. For example, if some strains have developed antiviral drug resistance, they may become the dominant strains and lead to treatment failure. Thus, characterization of the strain-level diversity of viral populations is indispensable for understanding the viruses and is of great clinical importance.",

A relatively straightforward analysis is to understand the local diversity of known viruses by performing read mapping against reference genomes. While this type of analysis can produce a collection of local changes (mutations, insertions, or deletions) of the strains inside the quasispecies, it is not sufficient to infer the biological properties of the strains, which are more likely to be determined by multiple genes. In particular, epistatic interactions are abundant in RNA viruses, where the mutation of one gene masks the phenotypic effects of a mutation at another locus.

The goal is to assemble short reads from sequenced viral populations into correct haplotype sequences. When the reference genome is available, read mapping can be conducted first to identify local mutations and then cluster the local mutations (or short contigs) into genome-scale haplotypes. When quality reference genomes are not available, which is often the case for emerging viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, read mapping is not a very effective strategy to identify all mutations.

High similarity between haplotypes in the same quasispecies and the heterogeneous sequencing depth along the viral genomes present barriers to adoption of existing assembly programs. A recently published comparison showed that none of the tested haplotype reconstruction tools were able to successfully reconstruct the five known strains for a mock HIV quasispecies [9] . We had the same observations when comparing several popular metagenomic assembly tools and haplotype assembly tools such as IDBA-UD [10] , IVA [11] , SAVAGE [12] , MLEHaplo [13] on the same data set [14] . Many methods output a set of contigs with various sizes that are much shorter than the genomes. With these outputted contigs from assembly programs, it still remains to infer the number of haplotypes and to match the contigs to their originating haplotypes. Thus, there is a need to cluster the contigs into different groups so that each group represents a haplotype.

Thus, composition-based features such as tetranucleotide frequencies or GC contents are not informative enough to separate contigs from different haplotypes, which usually share high sequence similarity (over 90%). Tools that heavily rely on sequence composition-based features will not be able to estimate the number of haplotypes correctly. Second, RNA virus sequencing tends to be compounded by gene expression and fast degradation and thus the observed sequencing coverage along each haplotype, or even a contig, can be more heterogeneous than expected. In addition, if a contig contains a region that is common to multiple haplotypes, that region tends to have higher coverage than a haplotype-specific segment. All these challenges require carefully designed methods to use the coverage information for contig binning.",

Most of the existing contig binning tools for microbiome sequencing data are designed for bacteria. These methods usually estimate the bin number by aligning metagenomic data to a pre-established marker gene database, and then assign assembled contigs to different bins using sequence composition information and read coverage levels. For example, MaxBin [15] uses both tetranucleotide frequencies and contig coverage levels to assign assembled contigs into different bins. Some binning tools [18] leverage co-abundance of genes across multiple metagenomic samples. The rationale is that if two contigs are from the same bin, their coverage profiles across multiple samples should be highly correlated.",

If there is no consensus haplotype membership (e.g. a tie), we map the clusters to haplotypes based on the ranking of the abundance. Let a cluster be B and its paired haplotype be H. As the input to our program is a set of contigs, let the contig set originating from H be C H . Define B \u2229 C H as the common regions between the two contig sets. Following other contig binning tools [15, 18] , the base-level recall for H is thus |B\u2229C H | |C H | , which quantified how many of the bases in C H are correctly clustered in B. The base-level precision is defined as |B\u2229C H | |B| , which quantifies how many of the bases in cluster B are from contig set C H .

Our experimental results show that VirBin works better for longer contigs that can cover bigger regions of the underlying genomes. When the genome coverage by the contigs is below 70%, the performance of VirBin deteriorates because it becomes harder to estimate the correct number of haplotypes. In addition, the empirical experience shows that it is difficult to classify two viral strains when the abundance difference between them is below 3%.

Although abundance-based clustering has been used for contig binning from multiple samples [15, 19] , existing tools are not designed Fig. 7 The pipeline of VirBin to tackle key challenges of distinguishing contigs of different haplotypes. First, the observed coverage of each contig not only depends on the abundance of the underlying haplotype, but also depends on whether it is a unique or shared region by two or more haplotypes. Second, heterogeneous coverage of each haplotype in an RNA viral quasispecies is common, which is caused by sequencing-related biases and compounded by gene expression. Thus, directly applying existing prototypebased clustering models such as Gaussian-mixture model to contigs is not expected to produce accurate clustering. Our solution to this problem is to cut the contigs into \"windows\" and to apply the clustering on sub-contigs that are more likely to represent one haplotype. In addition, instead of assuming any parametric distribution, which is usually not the case for haplotype contigs, we will use a non-parametric distribution.",

We define the number of contigs inside each window as the window depth, d. Based on these definitions, we have the following observations. When each position of the underlying haplotypes can be covered by at least one contig, d is equal to or larger than the number of haplotypes. Note that the common regions between different haplotypes are regarded as different positions and thus should be covered by different contigs. This conclusion can be proved by contradiction easily. Fig. 8b shows the contigs satisfying the conditions in the ideal case. There are three haplotypes with different abundances. They only contain mutations at three positions that are far away from each other. Because of the long common regions among them, assembly programs usually won't be able to recover all the three genomes. Instead, they can generate short but correct contigs. In Fig. 8b , each position in the three haplotypes is covered by at least one contig. In this case, all the windows have depth of at least 3. If every position of a haplotype is only covered by one contig, the windows will have depth N, which is the number of haplotypes. As some positions can be covered by multiple contigs, the overlaps between contigs contribute to window depth larger than N.

Because each contig can contain both haplotype-specific region and shared regions among different haplotypes, using the read coverage profile of the whole contig will confuse the clustering algorithm and makes the convergence slow or leads to wrong assignment of the objects. For example, in Fig. 8c , the contig \"A S 2 \" contains mutation A from one haplotype and also a shared region S 2 . Thus, significantly more reads will be mapped to the shared region and make the coverage for this contig highly heterogeneous. Thus, the objects as input to the clustering algorithm are \"subcontigs\" in windows of depth N, where the sub-contigs are substrings of the contigs in these windows. They are more likely to represent the relative abundance of one haplotype. After clustering on sub-contigs, a post-processing step will be applied to get the cluster membership for each contig based on its sub-contigs' memberships.",
