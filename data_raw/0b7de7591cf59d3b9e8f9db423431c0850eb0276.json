In real time, the Malthusian parameter or the epidemic growth rate, \u03b1 is arguably the most important parameter. A key theorem in branching processes [1, Thm.6.8.1] states that if the number of infected individuals in the population grows large, then it roughly grows at a rate proportional to e \u03b1t , where t is the time since the infectious disease was introduced. From a generation perspective the essential parameter is R 0 , the basic reproduction number, i.e. the average number of infections per typical infectious individual in an otherwise fully susceptible population. An outbreak can become large only if R 0 > 1, which happens if and only if \u03b1 > 0. Note that if R 0 > 1, then it is still possible that the epidemic will go extinct quickly. The probability for this to happen can be computed [3, Eq. 3.10] and is less than 1.",

It is however worth remarking that in homogeneously mixing populations, in (configuration model) network populations and in multi-type populations, we can deduce straightforwardly the required control effort or critical vaccination coverage, v c from R 0 (see main text). For more extensive discussions on control effort and vaccination in the household model see [4] . We note that the critical vaccination coverage is based on vaccination uniformly at random, i.e. all people have the same probability of receiving the vaccine. As stated in the article, this vaccination strategy is not optimal if the population structure is known exactly, but since this relevant population structure is generally hard to obtain for emerging diseases, vaccination uniformly at random might be the best feasible method.",

In this model pairs of individuals make (close) contacts independently at a rate which might depend on the pair (depending on the population structure). If an infectious individual contacts a susceptible one, the susceptible one becomes latently infected (exposed) and stays so for an exponentially distributed time with mean 1/\u03b4, after which the individual becomes infectious. An individual stays infectious for an exponentially distributed time with mean 1/\u03b3, after which he or she is removed, which might mean that the individual dies, he or she recovers with permanent immunity or is isolated in a 100% effective way. We also discuss the Markov SIR epidemic, in which there is no latent period (or \u03b4 = \u221e), but is the same as the Markov SEIR epidemic in all other respects. We assume that there are only a few initially infective individuals in the population and all others are susceptible.",

For ease of exposition we assume that the derivative of \u00b5(t) exists and is given by \u03b2(t). Thus \u00b5(t) = t 0 \u03b2(s)ds. This assumption is not necessary and the results below can be generalized in a straightforward way to the case where \u00b5(t) is not differentiable. From the theory of branching processes [1] , we know that R 0 = \u00b5(\u221e) = \u221e 0 \u03b2(s)ds.

Thus, by Chebyshev's integral inequality (or FKG inequality [5, p.86 ]), we have that e \u2212\u03b1Y and e \u2212\u03bb (net) Y are positively correlated, whence R is small if \u03ba is relatively large compared to R (hom) 0 and the standard deviation of the infectious period is not large compared to the mean. (See Figure 2 of the main article). It can easily be seen that the opposite makes the approximation worse. Infections taking place a long time after the start of an infector's infectious period contribute relatively little to \u03b1; on the other hand all infections make the same contribution to R 0 . Also note, that if in the network model a given individual infects all of his/her acquaintances with large probability (say 99%) if he/she is infectious for a middle-long time (say T ), then increasing the infectious period to 2T has little effect on the epidemic both on its size (which relates to R 0 ) and its speed (which relates to \u03b1). However, in a homogeneously mixing model, the offspring (which contributes to R 0 ) would double in expectation in this situation, while the speed of the epidemic would hardly change. Thus, if the standard deviation of the infectious period is large, we cannot ignore the large infectious periods which cause the discrepancy between R . Now consider the second special case discussed above: the infectivity profile, conditional upon still being infectious,\u0125(\u03c4 ) is not constant, but is proportional to h(\u03c4 ) for the homogeneous mixing model, where \u03c4 is the time since an individual starts to be infectious.

Additionally we assume that the number of individuals of each type is large, and in what follows we assume that there is no relevant depletion of susceptibles of any type during the initial stages of the epidemic. We assume that a fraction \u03c0 i of the community is of type i. Furthermore, we assume that not all close contacts lead to infection. However, we do assume that the probability that a close contact between a susceptible and an infectious individual leads to infection depends only on the time since infection of the infectious one, \u03c4 . This probability is random (i.e. different for different individuals) and is denoted by \u039b(\u03c4 ). Note that we assume that the distribution of \u039b(\u03c4 ) does not depend on the types of the individuals. The random function \u039b incorporates the latent and recovered period, in the sense that before the end of the latent period and after recovery \u039b(\u03c4 ) = 0. We use g(\u03c4 ) = E(\u039b(\u03c4 )) for the expected probability of infection at age \u03c4 of a randomly selected individual. In an SIR epidemic the infectivity is often a function of \u03c4 conditioned on the individual still being infectious at time \u03c4 . In that case g(\u03c4 ) can be written as h(\u03c4 )P(I > \u03c4 ). Close contacts are not necessarily symmetric. That is, if individual x makes a close contact with individual y, then it is not necessarily the case that y makes a close contact with x. The rate of close contacts from a given type i individual to a given type j individual is \u03bb ij /n. Therefore the expected number of j-individuals that an infected i-individual infects up to its \"age\" (time since infection) t during the early stages of an outbreak when all individuals are susceptible is given by",

However, in the article we consider the case where the population structure is hard to obtain. In that case vaccination uniformly at random seems to be the most natural vaccination strategy. Reproduction numbers for household epidemics and the relationships with vaccination uniformly at random and the epidemic growth rate are studied in great detail in [9] and some of the results will be repeated here. For the household model we assume that the population is partitioned in n/m households (or groups or cliques) of equal size m. So, we assume that n is an integer multiple of the positive integer m. For a population where the households are not of equal size we refer to [10] . We consider only SEIR models in which individuals have constant infectivity during their infectious period. Individuals contact each other with global contacts at perpair rate \u03bb G /n, while members of the same household make additionally local contacts at per-pair rate \u03bb H . Note that, unlike in Section 1.5, we assume that close contact of an infective with a susceptible necessarily results in the infection of the latter.",

The estimate\u03b1 is obtained from the development of the number of infectious people over time between the time the 100th individual becomes infectious and the time the 1000th individual becomes infectious, by using least square estimation of the natural logarithm of the number of infecteds against time. More specifically, if t 100 , t 101 , . . . , t 1000 denote the times that these individuals become infected then\u03b1 is obtained by fitting a straight line to the points (log(i), t i ), i = 100, 101, . . . , 1000 using linear regression, s\u00f4",

An epidemic starts with 10 uniformly chosen individuals which are at the start of their infectious period at time 0. We estimate the epidemic growth rate \u03b1 based on the time between the total number of individuals which are infectious or recovered/deceased (the individuals that have shown symptoms) increases from 200 to 400. We exclude all simulations in which the total number of affected individuals stays below 400. The estimate of R 0 based on the real infection tree is obtained by looking at the epidemic from a generation perspective: All individuals infected by the initially infectious individuals are in generation 1, individuals infected by generation 1 infectives are in generation 2 etc. [10] . We consider as a reference generation the first generation in which there are 75 individuals (say generation k) and we divide the number of individuals in generation 2 up to k + 1 by the number of individuals in generation 1 up to k. We exclude the initial individuals from the estimation of R 0 , because those individuals are chosen uniformly at random and therefore independently of the population structure. By trial and error investigation we tune the infection parameter \u03bb such that the estimate of R 0 using the infection process is close to 2. Using this \u03bb we run 1000 simulations. A typical graph of how the number of observed individuals (i.e. infectious + removed) is given in Figure S2 (a). In part (b) we show the same graph but now we subtract 0.05 times the time to show that the growth of the number of individuals is indeed close to exponential over a large time.",

Such an event causes a sudden strong increase in the observed cases. These atypical trajectories are possible to identify if one observes the number of infectious individuals for a single epidemic and better estimates can be obtained in this way.

This part is relatively small and we restrict ourselves to the largest connected component (containing 1034 individuals). This network has a high mean degree (51.7) and mean excess degree (93.5). Because of its relatively small size, and the observation that some substantial parts of the network are connected to the other parts of the network through only a few connections, the estimate of R 0 through the epidemic growth rate is less good.
