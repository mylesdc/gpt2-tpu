People were considered vaccinated three weeks after receiving a dose of vaccine. ILI and pandemic A(H1N1) laboratory-confirmed cases were obtained from two surveillance networks of general practitioners. During the epidemic, 99.7% of influenza isolates were pandemic A(H1N1). Pandemic and seasonal vaccine uptakes in the population were obtained from the National Health Insurance database and by telephonic surveys, respectively. Effectiveness estimates were adjusted by age and week. The presence of residual biases was explored by calculating vaccine effectiveness after the influenza period. The effectiveness of pandemic vaccines in preventing ILI was 52% (95% confidence interval: 30-69) during the pandemic and 33% (4-55) after. It was 86% (56-98) against confirmed influenza. The effectiveness of seasonal vaccines against ILI was 61% (56-66) during the pandemic and 19% (210-41) after. It was 60% (41-74) against confirmed influenza.",

Trivalent 2009-2010 seasonal vaccines had a statistically significant effectiveness in preventing ILI and confirmed pandemic influenza, but were not better in preventing confirmed pandemic influenza than in preventing ILI. This lack of difference might be indicative of selection bias.",

Medical and paramedical staffs working in hospitals were first called, on October 20 th (week 43). Individuals working with ambulatory patients presenting with influenza or working with patients at high risk of complication for influenza were called on November 2 nd (week 45). Risk factors of complication, stated in a High Committee of Public Health advice, on September 7 th 2009, were: pregnancy (in particular from the second trimester), obesity, and chronic conditions such as broncopulmonary diseases, heart diseases, diabetes and immunosuppression [2] . On November 12 th (week 46) all other health care professional were called (880,000), as well as all persons in contact with infants younger than six month-old (1,200,000), childminders working with children under three year-old (500,000), and every person between six months and 64 years of age with a risk factor (2,815,000). Pregnant women from their second trimester and 6-to 23 month-old children without risk factor were called on November 20 th (week 47). High school pupils were called on November 25 th (week 48). People over 65 year-old with a risk factor (3, 200 ,000) and children older than 23 month-old (7,700,000) and were called in week 49. Finally, adults over 18 year-old without a risk factor were called in week 53 (39,000,000).

In the first weeks of the pandemic, the sharpest increase in ILI incidence was observed in children under five yearold. After five weeks, 5 to 14 year-old children became the most affected group. The biggest difference between age-specific incidence rates was observed at the peak of the epidemic. It can be seen in Figure 2 that adults over 65 year-old were almost unaffected by the pandemic wave in France.",

Patients consulting a GP for an influenza episode might not be comparable to the rest of the population. In particular, if people vaccinated with influenza vaccine consulted differently than the rest of the population for an influenza episode, because of comorbidities or because of a different propensity to seek care for example, this could be a confusion factor when estimating VE. As suggested by several authors, such a selection bias should affect VE estimated on GP data during the influenzacirculation period as well as VE estimated outside this period [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . This is particularly interesting when using ILI, as influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing ILI should be null outside the influenza-circulation period, if no bias was present. We therefore calculated VE against ILI after the influenza epidemic period, as an indication of selection bias in our data. As no vaccine was given before the epidemic start, pre-epidemic VE could not be assessed. We did not calculate VE against laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1) influenza outside the influenza-circulating period.",

This result cannot be explained by ILI comprising an appreciable number of seasonal influenza cases against which seasonal vaccine could have proven effective: more than 99% of influenza isolates during the 2009-2010 season were pandemic A(H1N1) [4] . This result might, instead, indicate that our effectiveness estimates of seasonal vaccines are driven by biases, in particular case selection biases. Indeed, the population that yearly vaccinates against seasonal influenza might be distinct from the rest of the population, in particular in its propensity to consult. This could induce a selection bias, since influenza cases are recruited through GPs.

However, as our study was integrated in an ongoing surveillance system based on GP voluntary reporting of ILI cases, adjustment covariates were not collected in order to keep the questionnaire as short as possible. As a compromise, only essential covariates for VE calculation were asked to GPs: age, vaccine status (pandemic and seasonal), delay since vaccination (dichotomized at three weeks), and vaccine trademark (for pandemic vaccine only). Considering the small number of reported vaccinated influenza cases, pandemic VE was not calculated by vaccine trademark.",

Call et al reviewed the probabilities of presence of different symptoms in influenza cases, i.e. the sensitivity of these symptoms for detecting influenza: depending on the age group, they were between 0.3 and 0.9, with lower sensitivities in the elderly [43] . Orenstein et al demonstrated in a simulation study that poorly sensitive outcomes could lead to underestimation of field vaccine effectiveness in three different observational designs [16] . However, our analysis seems more subject to overestimation biases.",

Another potential source of bias in our study is the uncertain comparability of cases recruited by GPs with samples drawn from the general population. To further assess the possible lack of comparability between cases and population samples, an alternative population sample taken directly among GPs usual patients could be used for validation. To that effect, during 2010-2011 influenza season, a cross-sectional survey at GPs offices will be carried out to assess the vaccine coverage among Sentinelles GPs patients.",

To try and further evidence these selection biases, vaccine effectiveness against ILI was computed after the influenza circulation period. Effectiveness of pandemic vaccine during this period was significantly above zero (33%, 4-57), although not significant in most age subgroups except in the six to fourteen year-old group. Effectiveness of seasonal vaccines was, as for it, not significant, whether overall (19%, 210-41) or in each age subgroup. In conclusion, for both vaccine types, a moderate vaccine effectiveness was found after the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus stopped circulating at appreciable levels, which is indicative of upward biases in our VE estimates, but this postpandemic effectiveness was mainly not statistically significant.",
