For rapid detection of PEDV, a new immunochromatographic assay (ICA) based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was developed in this study. Results: The mAbs were prepared by using PEDV positive hybridoma cells that were selected by using cell surface fluorescence immunosorbent assay (CSFIA). Fourteen mAbs against PEDV strain isolated from south of China were prepared. The optimal mAb 4A11 was coated on NC membrane as the capturing reagent and the mAb A11H7 was coupled to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as detection reagent for the new ICA. The new ICA was used to measure PEDV in phosphate buffer containing tween-20. Results indicated that the limit of detection (LOD) of the new ICA was 0.47 \u03bcg/mL (5.9 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 /mL) and the liner detection range of the ICA was 0.625-10 \u03bcg/mL (7.8 \u00d7 10 3 -10 5 TCID 50 /mL). The specificity analysis results showed that this new ICA had no cross reaction in the presence of other porcine viruses. The ICA was also validated for the detection of PEDV in swine stool samples with little interference from swine stool. To compare its accuracy to other traditional detection methods, 27 swine stool samples from south of China were investigated with the new developed ICA, commercial strip and RT-PCR. Results showed that the new ICA was more comparable to RT-PCR than commercial test strip.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, due to the fact that PEDV and a different Alphacoronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), have the same epidemiological and clinical features. These two viruses have led to complications in clinical diagnosis. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop differential laboratory tests [9, 10] . To date, several methods including RT-PCR [11] , separation identification [12] , serological method [13] , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [14] and colloidal gold method [15] [16] [17] have been used to detect the PEDV antigen. Although RT-PCR serves as a good standard due to its high sensitivity and accuracy, this method relies heavily on sophisticated equipment and expensive apparatus. Several other common methods are also not suitable for on-site diagnosis due to the following reasons. Separation identification means to isolate PEDV in Vero cell cultures from the small intestine of a PEDV infected piglet. It is a classical method for PEDV detection, but it is time-consuming for it needs at least one week. The serological method can only detect PEDV antibody. However, whether the PEDV antibody is from vaccine infection or wild infection is still unknown. ELISA is a cheap and simple approach for PEDV detection, however, it involves long incubation period, multiple washing steps, and the assistance of a microplate reader. In contrast, recently developed immunochromatographic assay (ICA) is much more applicable for on-site diagnosis of PEDV for it is simple, sensitive, specific and can be operated without training. Therefore, this method could be useful for monitoring the infection of PED [18] [19] [20] .",

Considering regional differences in strains, it might not be the best choice for PEDV detection in south of China. A PEDV strain CHYJ130330 was isolated from the fecal specimen of a 3-day-old dead piglet in March 2013 on a commercial swine farm in Guangdong Province in the south of China [22] .

The assembly of the new ICA was as follows: The new ICA was made of PVC plate, NC membrane, sample pad, conjugate pad and absorbent pad. PBS (0.015 M, pH 7.4) diluted mAb (0.875 mg/mL) and goat anti-mouse IgG (1 mg/mL) were dispensed on specific areas of NC membrane called the test line (T-line) and calibration line (C-line) using an automatic dispenser at a volume of 1 \u03bcL/cm. The NC membrane was dried at 37\u00b0C and saved for later use. The AuNPs-mAb was loaded onto the conjugate pad using an automatic dispense system set to 5.0 \u03bcL/cm and then dried at 37\u00b0C. The pretreatment of sample pad involved soaking in PBS (0.015 M, pH 7.4, containing 2.5% (w/v) sucrose, 2% (w/v) BSA, and 1% (w/v) Tween-20) and drying at room temperature and then at 37\u00b0C. The PVC plate acted as the holder of the new ICA, onto which sample pad, conjugate pad, NC membrane and absorbent pad were pasted with an overlap of 2 mm between each part. After the assembly was completed, the new ICA was cut into 3.8-mm-wide and 60-mm-long strips using a programmable HGS201 strip cutter and kept in a suitable plastic cassette for further use.

After identification, protein concentration was determined to be 4 mg/mL. The prepared PEDV was used to immunize mice to generate mAbs against PEDV [24] . From the hybridoma cells generated against PEDV, 14 clones that could produce mAbs with strong PEDV binding ability were selected. Immunoglobulin isotyping suggested these clones were IgG2a. To select PEDV mAb pairs with high sensitivity and specificity, a double antibody sandwich ELISA was used. The amount of capture antibody for coating and detecting antibody in both experimental and control group was 10 \u03bcg/ml. 1 \u03bcg/ml PEDV was added to each well of experimental group while an equal volume of PBS was added to the control group. Only the mAb pairs which have strong signal (OD \u2265 1.0) in PEDV group and no obvious signal (OD \u2264 0.2) in PBS group were marked as positive. All the mAb pairs which have no strong signal in PEDV group or have obvious signal in PBS group were marked as negative. As shown in Tables 1, 5 of the 14 mAbs were successfully paired using double antibody sandwich ELISA matrix method.

The assay was based on mAbs to CHYJ130330, which is a new strain of PEDV found in south of China and therefore is an appropriate target antigen for PEDV detection. First, to prepare PEDV specific monoclonal antibody, immune antigen PEDV was cultured and purified in the normal way to ensure the quality of immune effect. T he well prepared 14 PEDV mAbs were used to do a double antibody sandwich ELISA matrix, in which these 14 mAbs were used as capture antibody and the same 14 mAbs labeled with HRP were used as detection antibody. The aim was to find which mAb as capture antibody and which HRP-mAb as detection antibody can produce the best detection result. That means, which mAb pair had the best binding ability to PEDV. Results showed that 4A11, 5H9, 5A9, A11H7 and 4H7 were these mAbs that can pair successfully. Second, due to the fact that the paired antibodies selected by double antibody sandwich ELISA matrix may not be suitable for the new ICA due to the differences in materials and environment, the new ICA was optimized by selecting the best pair from the 5 selected mAbs. 4A11 was proved to be the best capturing mAb while A11H7 was the best detection mAb. This optimization experiment greatly improved the sensitivity of the new ICA.",

The spray volume of AuNPs-mAb was also optimized. If the spray volume was too high, it was easy to produce nonspecific adsorption. However, if it was too low, the result would have low sensitivity. 5 \u03bcL/cm was selected considering both sides.",

It has been described that RT-PCR is the most sensitive and trustworthy method for PEDV detection. In this study, the commercial strip was included for comparison purpose.

The gold nanoparticle signal of the test strip was of superior strength with very low background noise. The LOD of the new ICA was 0.47 \u03bcg/mL (5.9 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 /mL) and the liner detection range was 0.625 to 10 \u03bcg/mL (7.8 \u00d7 10 3 to 10 5 TCID 50 /mL). In addition, the new ICA exhibited high specificity with little interference from swine stool, and could achieve recoveries ranging from 90 to 110.27% in spiked samples. Compared to RT-PCR and ELISA, the new ICA does not require sophisticated instruments and training. Relative to commercial test strips, the new ICA provides more accurate detection of PEDV in swine stool samples from south of China. Our study highlighted the potential of the on-site application of this new ICA for diagnosis and prevention of PED.",

Therefore, no aggressive operation was conducted against pigs for sampling purpose and no pigs were sacrificed in this study. The study used mice for generation of mAbs and those mice had to be sacrificed. The mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Thumb and forefinger were used to press down on the mice's head. The other hand grabbed the mice's tail and pulled it slightly back to the top to make the cervical spine disengage. The spinal cord was separated from the brain and the animal died immediately. There was no destruction of brain or section of major blood vessels in the neck during the process. All animal experiments were performed using protocols approved by Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee of Jinan University.",
