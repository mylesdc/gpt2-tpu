            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection has claimed hundreds of lives and has become a global threat since its emergence in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The ability of MERS-CoV to evade the host innate antiviral response may contribute to its severe pathogenesis. Many MERS-CoV-encoded proteins were identified to have interferon (IFN)-antagonizing properties, which correlates well with the reduced IFN levels observed in infected patients and ex vivo models. In this study, we fully characterized the IFN-antagonizing property of the MERS-CoV M protein. Expression of MERS-CoV M protein suppressed type I IFN expression in response to Sendai virus infection or poly(I:C) induction. This suppressive effect was found to be specific for the activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) but not nuclear factor-\u03baB. MERS-CoV M protein interacted with TRAF3 and disrupted TRAF3-TBK1 association leading to reduced IRF3 activation. M proteins from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have three highly similar conserved N-terminal transmembrane domains and a C-terminal region. Using chimeric and truncation mutants, the N-terminal transmembrane domains of the MERS-CoV M protein were found to be sufficient for its inhibitory effect on IFN expression, whereas the C-terminal domain was unable to induce this suppression. Collectively, our findings suggest a common and conserved mechanism through which highly pathogenic MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV harness their M proteins to suppress type I IFN expression at the level of TBK1-dependent phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 resulting in evasion of the host innate antiviral response.",

            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 as a novel coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory disease. 1 Since then, this virus has caused recurrent outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula and has spread, occasionally, to other parts of the world. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] According to the World Health Organization, 1626 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported between September 2012 and 7 January 7 2016 with 586 related deaths in 26 countries. 10 In particular, 186 people were infected and 36 were killed in one recent outbreak in South Korea. 10 MERS-CoV is classified into lineage C of Betacoronavirus and is most phylogenetically related to two bat coronaviruses, HKU4 and HKU5, providing insight on its evolutionary origin. 11, 12 MERS-CoV is a polycistronic positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a genome of~30 Kb in size. The 5\u2032 most two-thirds of MERS-CoV genome encodes polyproteins 1a and 1ab, which are further cleaved to yield 16 non-structural proteins, whereas the 3\u2032 end of the genome encodes several structural or lineage-specific proteins. 13 Upon infection, these proteins are expressed to facilitate viral replication and propagation in the host. 14 MERS-CoV infection has been widely reported to mildly induce type I interferons (IFNs), including IFN-\u03b1 and -\u03b2, in patients as well as in animal and cellular infection models. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] This has been attributed to the IFNantagonizing property of some MERS-CoV-encoded proteins, which directly perturb the host IFN production mechanisms, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] lending support to the notion that MERS-CoV uses multiple strategies to evade the innate immune response.",

In a comparative analysis of MERS-CoV structural and accessory proteins, it has been shown that M, ORF4a, ORF4b and ORF5 possess IFN-antagonizing properties. 22 We, and others, have characterized the ORF4a protein as a dsRNA-binding protein that interferes with the activation of RLR by either a dsRNA ligand or the protein co-activator PACT. 24, 25 However, the molecular mechanisms through which other MERS-CoV proteins manipulate the RLR signaling pathway to disrupt IFN-\u03b2 expression have not been elucidated.",

Coronavirus M protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein localized predominantly to the Golgi complex and is required for virion assembly. [30] [31] [32] MERS-CoV M protein is of particular interest because SARS-CoV M protein also inhibits IFN production through a mechanism by which the formation of TRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK-\u03b5 complex is impeded to ablate the activation of IRF3 transcription factor. 30 In contrast, M protein encoded by human coronavirus HKU1 associated with common cold has no influence on IFN production. 32 Here we reported that the MERS-CoV M protein also specifically inhibited IRF3 activation but not NF-\u03baB signaling. MERS-CoV M protein was capable of interacting with TRAF3 adapter protein and hampered TRAF3-TBK1 interaction leading to diminished IRF3 activation. Using a chimeric protein containing the MERS-CoV M protein N-terminal transmembrane domains and a dormant SARS-CoV M protein C-terminal domain, we confirmed that the N-terminal transmembrane domains of MERS-CoV M protein sufficiently account for its inhibitory effect. Although another chimera containing SARS-CoV M protein N-terminal transmembrane domains and a MERS-CoV M protein C-terminal domain was fully competent in IFN antagonism, a truncation mutant lacking the functional first transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV M was not, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of the MERS-CoV M protein is largely dispensable for its immunosuppressive activity.",

To address this issue, two different luciferase reporter constructs, in which tandem copies of either IRF3-or NF-\u03baB-binding elements were inserted into their promoter region, were used. The truncation mutant of RIG-I known as RIG-I N that contains only the N-terminal CARD domain was chosen to be the inducer in these assays because it is constitutively active and highly competent to induce these two pathways. 28 The MERS-CoV M protein was able to suppress the promoter activity of the IRF3-driven luciferase construct in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2), but no inhibitory effect was observed with the NF-\u03baB-driven construct ( Figure 2B ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2) although the canonical inhibitor I\u03baB-\u03b1 could efficiently blunt its activation as a positive control ( Figure 2B ; bar 6 compared with bar 2).

The activation signal will be mostly unaffected if the activation event mediated by that transducer is downstream of the action point where M protein exerts its inhibitory effect. As described above, RIG-I N is a constitutively active mutant that resembles (1 \u03bcL/mL) in C for 16 h before harvest for dual-luciferase reporter assay. Bars represent the mean of three biological replicates (n = 3) and error bars indicate their s.d. The statistical significance between selected samples was evaluated using a two-tailed Student's t-test for unpaired samples with equal variance and P-value (P) was indicated. Figure 3A ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2). A similar result was also obtained using MAVS as an activator ( Figure 3B ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2), which is a mitochondrial adapter that diverts the activation signal from RIG-I to the IRF3 and NF-\u03baB pathways. [44] [45] [46] [47] When activators committed to the IRF3 pathway were used, greater inhibitory effects were observed, as in the cases of TBK1 ( Figure 3C ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2) and IKK-\u03b5 ( Figure 3D ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2), which are kinases which recognize and phosphorylate IRF3 as direct substrate. [48] [49] [50] [51] Surprisingly, when a constitutively active mutant of IRF3 transcription factor (IRF3 5D), with five inducible phosphorylation sites at Ser/Thr residues mutated to Asp, 52 was employed, the expression of the M protein no longer quenched the IRF3-induced activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter ( Figure 3E ), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of M protein occurs upstream of IRF3 activation.",

Several RLR transducers were ectopically expressed with MERS-CoV M protein in cultured cells for a coimmunoprecipitation experiment. When the transducers were precipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, the M protein was only detected in TRAF3-containing precipitate ( Figure 4A ; lane 4 compared with lanes 1-3) even though M protein was abundantly expressed in all samples with other transducers (Figure 4A ; lower panel for input), TRAF3 functions as an adapter that bridges the mitochondrial transducer MAVS with the downstream signaling complex containing TBK1 and IKK-\u03b5 kinases that are essential for IRF3 activation. 34, 53 The physical association of the MERS-CoV M protein with TRAF3 ( Figure 4A ) prompted us to test whether the adapter function of TRAF3 would be particularly affected by M protein. We performed another co-immunoprecipitation experiment to explore the possibility that M protein could perturb the interaction of TRAF3 with the downstream transducer complex. When TRAF3 and TBK1 were ectopically expressed in cultured cells, the detection of TBK1 in TRAF3-immunoprecipitate confirmed the specific recruitment of TBK1 to TRAF3 in the absence of M protein ( Figure 4B ; lane 2 compared with lane 1). However, when M protein was added to the system, the interaction between TRAF3 and TBK1 was significantly disrupted ( Figure 4B ; lane 3 compared with lane 2), demonstrating that the physical association of MERS-CoV M protein with TRAF3 perturbs TRAF3-TBK1 interaction.",

We then evaluated whether IRF3 activation would be affected by the expression of M protein. IRF3 dimerization visualized by non-denaturing native PAGE is a sensitive assay for evaluating direct IRF3 activation. 39 Therefore, we ectopically expressed IRF3 and M protein with the inducer RIG-I N in cultured cells and subjected cell lysates directly to native PAGE to check for IRF3 dimerization. When the inducer RIG-I N was exclusively co-expressed with IRF3, the detection of an additional slow-migrating band indicated the activation and dimerization of IRF3, which would otherwise be entirely in its monomeric form in the absence of any activator ( Figure 4C ; lane 2 compared with lane 1). Interestingly, when M protein was expressed, the signal reflecting the dimeric form of IRF3 molecules was significantly diminished, even though the total IRF3 level expressed in all samples was highly comparable as detected by conventional denaturing SDS-PAGE ( Figure 4C ; lower panel for SDS-PAGE), suggesting that IRF3 activation was greatly inhibited by the MERS-CoV M protein. IRF3 phosphorylation was also suppressed with the expression of MERS M protein in a similar experimental setup ( Figure 4D ; lane 3 compared with lane 2). Together with other results, MERS-CoV M protein was thought to interact with TRAF3 to perturb TRAF3-TBK1 interaction, which, in turn, affects IRF3 phosphorylation and activation.",

This innate immunosuppressive activity of the MERS-CoV M protein was due to its conserved N-terminal transmembrane domains. Our mechanistic study complemented the previous work that showed that MERS-CoV M protein had IFN-antagonizing activity. 22 Both studies demonstrated that MERS-CoV M protein suppressed IRF3 activity but not NF-\u03baB signaling. It is known that the activation of RIG-I and MAVS results in the activation of both IRF3 and NF-\u03baB. 28, [44] [45] [46] Our results indicated that the MERS-CoV M protein was capable of differentially suppressing the RIG-I-induced activation of IRF3 (Figure 2 ). This provides further support to the bifurcation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB signaling subsequent to RIG-I and MAVS activation. Further investigations should elucidate the mechanism by which the MERS-CoV M protein preferentially modulates IRF3 activators such as TBK1, while sparing NF-\u03baB activators such as CARD9. 47 We provided evidence that the TRAF3-TBK1 interaction as well as IRF3 phosphorylation and dimerization were affected by the MERS-CoV M protein (Figure 4 ). Our findings fill the knowledge gap by providing novel mechanistic insight into the innate immunosuppressive activity of MERS-CoV M protein.",

The MERS-CoV M protein is a transmembrane protein that was shown to co-localize with markers of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartments in the perinuclear area. 22 Although TRAF3 is known to adapt the mitochondrial transducer MAVS, it is not associated with mitochondria but rather with the Golgi apparatus and ER-Golgi intermediate compartments in unstimulated conditions, 30, 54 rendering it susceptible to interaction with the MERS-CoV M protein. Upon stimulation with ligands or viral infection, TRAF3 appears on membrane-bound fragments originating from Golgi. Retention of TRAF3 in ER-to-Golgi compartments and inability to form Golgi fragments rendered IFN-\u03b2 expression inefficient. 54 Therefore, whether TRAF3-containing Golgi fragment formation is affected by MERS-CoV M protein warrants further analysis. This may serve as a novel mechanism by which virus-encoded proteins counteract host IFN production.",

On one hand, the development of relevant prophylactic and therapeutic agents has been well under way. [55] [56] [57] On the other hand, the identification of the pathogenic factors in these viruses is also in full swing. The M protein is a pathogenic factor by virtue of its IFN-antagonizing property. Both the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV M proteins were found to suppress IFN production with a highly similar mechanism in which the IRF3phosphorylating complex of TRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK-\u03b5 was affected by their N-terminal transmembrane domains. 30, 32 Interestingly, in the case of community-acquired human coronavirus HKU1, which normally causes common cold in infected individuals, its M protein showed no IFN antagonistic property, 32 further supporting the importance of the M protein in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Using a side-by-side comparison of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV M proteins, we discovered that the extent by which the MERS-CoV M protein suppressed IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity was lower than that by SARS-CoV M protein. This difference might be explained by the strengths of the interaction of MERS-CoV M protein with other transducers. Whereas the MERS-CoV M protein was found to be strongly associated with TRAF3, its interaction with TBK1 or IKK-\u03b5 was undetectable (data not shown). This distinguished MERS-CoV M protein from the SARS-CoV M protein, which interacts potently with every component of the TRAF3\u00b7TANK\u00b7TBK1/IKK-\u03b5 complex. 30 Further investigations are required to shed light on how the interaction of the M protein with TRAF3 complex might influence MERS-CoV pathogenesis.",
