The first step was rescuing in cell cultures Sendai virus minigenomes encoding the proteins of interest, with the help of wild type Sendai virus. The second step was propagating such recombinant defective viruses, together with the helper virus, in the allantoic cavity of chicken embryonated eggs, and passage to optimize protein production. When compared with the production of the same proteins in the culture supernatant of cells infected with vaccinia recombinants, the yield in the allantoic fluid was 5-10 fold higher. Mutant forms of these soluble proteins were easily constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in eggs using the same approach.",

Rescue of recombinant SeV [7] and other mononegavirales from cDNA copies of their respective negative single-stranded RNA genomes has been achieved, as well as expression of foreign proteins from the recombinant viruses [8] . However, cDNA cloning and rescue of recombinant paramyxoviruses still entails laborious and time-consuming steps. These difficulties are circumvented in rescuing replication defective minigenomes. These are short negative-stranded RNA molecules in which most of the internal coding sequences of the viral genome have been replaced by a reporter gene (or any other heterologous sequence). Paramyxovirus minigenomes obtained by cDNA cloning can be amplified in transfected cells either expressing a minimal set of complementing viral proteins or superinfected with a wild type homologous helper virus. Although the minigenome can then be amplified in tissue culture, SeV replication is much more efficient in eggs than in cultured cells. Therefore, a SeV minigenome seemed an attractive and versatile vector for the expression of foreign proteins in chicken eggs.",

Both, HRSV F and HMPV F are structural proteins that are synthesized as inactive F0 precursors that need to be cleaved proteolytically before becoming membrane-fusion competent. Whereas HRSV F0 is cleaved twice at sites I and II containing furin recognition sequences [11] , HMPV F0 is cleaved only once after a single Arg residue [12] . Both proteins are trimers in which each monomer is made of the two chains (F1 and F2) generated after precursor cleavage. A membrane-anchorless HRSV F protein that lacks the C-terminal 50 amino acids (F TM -), including the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions, has been expressed in HEp-2 cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus [9] (rVV). HRSV/F TM -folds into trimers that are seen under the electron microscope as cone-shaped molecules [13] . An analogous rVV expressing an anchorless form of HMPV/F protein has been made (described in Methods).",

Transcription of SVec/HA-M by the T7 polymerase results in a positive polarity RNA that, after ribozyme self-cleavage, contains at both ends SeV sequences required for replication and transcription by the SeV polymerase. Therefore, expression of the HA-M protein can be achieved by transfecting BSR-T7/5 cells [15] (which express constitutively the T7 polymerase) with SVec/HA-M and three other plasmids encoding, also under a T7 promoter, the following set of complementing proteins: i) the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the SeV L gene, ii) the phosphoprotein (P), a cofactor of the viral polymerase and iii) the nucleoprotein (N), a major structural protein that binds tightly to both SeV genome and anti-genome (a replication intermediate of positive polarity), protecting them from RNase degradation.",

Maximal levels of HA-M, HRSV/F TM -or HMPV/F TMproteins in allantoic fluids correlated with low expression levels of SeV F protein and vice versa ( Figure 1C ). This is likely to reflect the competition between minigenomes and full-length SeV genomes for replication and incorporation into virus particles. Minigenomes being shorter are expected to replicate more rapidly than full-length viral genomes. Consequently, minigenomes should quickly outnumber full-length genomes in the infected cells and in the virus particles produced. However, since minigenome amplification and packaging requires helper virus functions, excess minigenome will result in a decrease in minigenome accumulation in the virus stock.",

Thus, after sedimentation of virions from the allantoic fluid, HA-M was found exclusively in the pellet fraction, in agreement with previous demonstration that this molecule can replace the matrix protein of helper SeV in mature particles [17] . In contrast, HRSV/F TM -and HMPV/F TM -were found mainly, in their respective supernatants. The small amount of HRSV/F TM -found in the pellet was probably due to aggregates, generated after complete cleavage of monomers in the protein trimer [11] , that may have co-sedimented with SeV particles. Figure 2B shows comparative Western blots of rVVinfected cell supernatants and allantoic fluids containing either HRSV/F TM -or HMPV/F TM -glycoproteins. Densitometric quantifications estimated that the concentrations of F TM -proteins in the allantoic fluids were 5-10-fold higher than in the cell supernatants. Considering that one egg yields 5-10 ml of allantoic fluid, the amount of F TMprotein produced in one egg is equivalent to that found in the supernatant of rVV-infected cells grown as monolayer in a plastic flask of 175 cm 2 (~10 8 cells). This yield reduces the production cost of F TM -proteins about 10 times, considering only the cost of plastic and medium for growing animal cells in comparison with the cost of eggs. However, other significant advantages of embryonated eggs are: i) shorter incubation times, ii) simplicity of manipulations and iii) inexpensive equipment needed for production. These considerations are applicable at the laboratory scale, but other cost calculations may need to be done for industrial processes that require different manipulations and equipment.",

            "text": "Production of active human monoclonal antibodies [22] and single-chain antibodies [23] has been achieved in eggs of chimeric hens. Expression levels were very high, although the recombinant proteins were found in the egg white that has a high ovalbumin concentration. Whereas chimeric chickens may be useful bioreactors for expression of pharmaceutical molecules [24, 25] , the intense labor-and time-consuming steps involved in obtaining the transgenic chickens limits the system versatility. In contrast, manipulation of the SeV minigenome involves very simple steps that facilitate incorporation of foreign genes and generation of mutant heterologous proteins for comparative studies. Expression of these recombinant proteins in the allantoic fluid, that has a limited number of chicken derived molecules, also facilitates the purification steps of the target proteins.",

(A) Allantoic fluids (4.5 ml) from eggs inoculated with mixed stocks of SeV and SeV minigenomes expressing HA-M, HRSV/F TM -or HMPV/F TM -were centrifuged through a 25% glycerol cushion. Pellets were resuspended in 100 \u03bcl of PBS. All fractions were analyzed by Western blot. Five microliters of allantoic fluid from uninfected eggs (0) were compared with 5 \u03bcl of allantoic fluid from eggs inoculated with virus stocks encoding the indicated proteins (1), 5 \u03bcl of resuspended pellet (2), and 15 \u03bcl of the ultracentrifugation supernatant (3). (B) Comparison by Western blot of the expression levels of HRSV/F TM -and HMPV/F TM -from allantoic fluid or the supernatant of rVV-infected cells. Twenty microliters of culture supernatant from mock-infected HEp-2 cells (1), and 5, 10, or 20 \u03bcl of supernatant from rVV-infected cells (2, 3 and 4, respectively) were compared with 20 \u03bcl of uninfected allantoic fluid (5) and 5, 10, or 20 \u03bcl of allantoic fluid harvested from passage 4 (see",
