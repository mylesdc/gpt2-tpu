            "text": "The identification of a new circovirus (Porcine Circovirus 3, PCV3) has raised concern because its impact on swine health is not fully known. In Fujian Province in eastern China, even its circulating status and genetic characteristics are unclear. Here, we tested 127 tissue samples from swine from Fujian Province that presented respiratory symptoms. All of the PCV3 positive samples were negative for many other pathogens involved in respiratory diseases like PCV2, PRRSV, and CSFV, suggesting that PCV3 is potentially pathogenic. From phylogenetic analysis, PCV3 strains are divided into two main clades and five sub-clades; PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3, PCV3b-1, and PCV3b-2. Our identified strains belong to genotypes PCV3a-1, PCV3a-2, PCV3a-3, and PCV3b-2, indicating a high degree of genetic diversity of PCV3 in Fujian province until 2019. Interestingly, we found the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of PCV3 was dated to the 1950s, and PCV3 has a similar evolutionary rate as PCV2 (the main epidemic genotypes PCV2b and PCV2d). In addition, positive selection sites N56D/S and S77T/N on the capsid gene are located on the PCV3 antigen epitope, indicating that PCV3 is gradually adaptive in swine. In summary, our results provide important insights into the epidemiology of PCV3.",

            "text": "The Circovirus genus claimed veterinarians' attention shortly after its discovery, most members infect avian species but swine also serve as natural hosts [1, 2] . PCV1 and PCV2 are infectious agents in swine [3] ; PCV1 was first detected as a contaminant of PK-15 cell cultures and has not been associated with clinical disease, PCV2 is a ubiquitous, economically important pathogen to the swine industry [4] . PCV2 infection leads to a diverse range of clinical diseases collectively termed PCV2-associated disease (PCVAD), which includes post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), interstitial pneumonia, enteric disease, and reproductive failure [5] . Porcine Circovirus 3 (PCV3) is the third member of the Circovirus genus to infect swine [6] , it has a circular ssDNA genome of approximatively 2000 bases containing three identified ORFs [6] , although only ORF1 and ORF2 have been characterized. ORF1, located on the positive strand, apparently codes for a single replication-associated protein (Rep) of 296-297 aa [6] . ORF2 is on the negative strand and encodes the capsid protein (Cap). Despite the common genomic organization, PCV3 is distantly related to other known circoviruses, although a relatively close relationship with bat circoviruses has been suggested based on phylogenetic analysis [7] . There is also some unresolved opinion on the genotyping of PCV3. For example, Li et al. divide PCV3 into 3a and 3b, while Ouyang et al. suggest that PCV3 can be divided into PCV3a, 3b and 3c [7, 8] .",

In addition, we aimed to elucidate the evolution and genetic diversity of PCV3 at the national scale.",

Samples were homogenated then subjected to three cycles of freeze-thaw followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C, after which supernatants were collected for DNA extraction. Viral DNA was extracted using the Virus Genomics DNA Isolation Kit (Tianlong Biotech, Suzhou, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR with pair specific primers (Table 1) was used for detecting PCV3, PCV2, CSFV, and PRRSV [20, 21] . PCR conditions were as follows: for each sample 12.5 \u00b5L of 2\u00d7 Taq Master mix (Vazyme Biotech, Shanghai, China), 9.5 \u00b5L of double distilled water (ddH2O), 1 \u00b5L of template DNA, 0.4 nmol/L forward and 0.4 nmol/L reverse primer were combined. Thermocycler conditions were 95 \u2022 C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 30 s, annealing at 59 \u2022 C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u2022 C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72 \u2022 C for 10 min. Samples were held at 4 \u2022 C until further use. Complete genomes were amplified using the Phanta Max Super-Fidelity DNA polymerase (Vazyme Biotech, Shanghai, China) with the same amplification conditions, subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, then sent to Tsingke (Nanjing, China) for sequencing. Sequences were assembled using the BioEdit software [22] . Table 1 . Primers used in this study.",

MUSCLE [23] was used to align sequences, and manual adjustments were made to the alignment using MEGA7.0 [24] . After poor quality sequences were removed, 272 reference sequences remained. The best fit nucleotide substitution model was selected using ModelFind in IQ-tree [25] . The maximum likelihood (ML) tree was reconstructed using RAxML (version 2.8.10) [26] . For nucleotide substitution, we used the General Time Reversible parameter plus the GAMMA distribution model (GTR + G) pre-estimated, with 1000 bootstrap replicates. To estimate the time elapsed since the most recent common ancestor and the rate of PCV3 evolution, we constructed a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, using BEAST (v1.8.4) [27] and the Cap protein sequences. The substitution model was set to GTR + G with a relaxed molecular clock (lognormal), and the tree prior was coalescent (Bayesian skyline) according to model comparison built in Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/). The total chain length was 1 \u00d7 10 8 , with sampling every 10,000 steps. Two independent runs were performed and then combined using LogCombiner. The final MCC tree was annotated using TreeAnnotator and visualized using Figtree.",

Positively selected branches were identified using the adaptive branch-site REL test for episodic diversification (aBSREL) [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . A site was considered to be under positive selection only if it satisfied at least two algorithms (p < 0.1 in SLAC, p < 0.05 in FEL and MEME, p > 0.9 in FUBAR). Cap sequences from strains PCV3a and PCV3b were used to predict protein structures in I-TASSER (https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) [33] . Structures were visualized using PyMoL.

This agrees with the report by Li et al. [7] , but not fully with Ouyang et al., who are using ORF2 gene for analysis [8] . PCV3a is the most wide spread genotype in Fujian province consisting of PCV3a-1, PC3a-2 and PCV3a-3. Meanwhile, PCV3b-2but not PCV3b-1 was also found in Fujian province. Thus, in Fujian province, PCV3 has a high genetic diversity, in addition, the tMRCA of PCV3 is estimated later than in Saraiva et al. [39] . From previous important studies [7] , it is known that an alanine at amino acid number 24 distinguishes PCV3a from PCV3b, which has a valine at that site. In our study the strain PCV3-CN-FJ27-2018 had a valine at position 24 but it belongs to the PCV3a group. This prompts us to propose that PCV3 subtypes might recombine with each other during infections, similar to PCV2. After MCMC analysis we found that the evolutionary rate of PCV3 exceeds that of canine parvovirus or porcine pseudorabies virus but is similar to PCV2b and PCV2d [40, 41] , this result is similar to that reported by Li et al. [7] . However, based on more reference sequences than used in the studies of Li et al., the tMRCA of PCV3 is earlier than reported in those studies. The estimated Ne\u03c4 value of PCV3 is greater than that of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. We expect scaled effective population size Ne\u03c4 to follow I/2\u03b2, where \u03b2 is the equilibrium rate of transmission and I is the equilibrium number of infections. Although the duration of infection time of PCV3 in swine is unknown, given the large population size, its true value should also be similar to or greater than the estimated value.",
