The binding of hemagglutinin (HA) on the viral surface to host sialic acid (SA) receptors is a requisite step in the infection process. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that H5N1 viruses can be divided into 10 clades based on their HA sequences, with most human IVs centered from clade 1 and clade 2.1 to clade 2.3. Protein sequence alignment in various clades indicates the high conservation in the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) is essential for binding with the SA receptor. Two glycosylation sites, 158N and 169N, also participate in receptor recognition. In the present work, we attempted to construct a serial H5N1 HA models including diverse glycosylated HAs to simulate the binding process with various SA receptors in silico. As the SA-a-2,3-Gal and SA-a-2,6-Gal receptor adopted two distinctive topologies, straight and fishhooklike, respectively, the presence of N-glycans at 158N would decrease the affinity of HA for all of the receptors, particularly SA-a-2,6-Gal analogs. The steric clashes of the huge glycans shown at another glycosylation site, 169N, located on an adjacent HA monomer, would be more effective in preventing the binding of SA-a-2,3-Gal analogs.",

According to phylogenetic analysis, IVs originated in waterfowl; due to antigenic mutations, including antigenic drift and antigenic shift, the mutation in the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) could result in a human pandemic similar to H1N1 [1] . Since the last century, there are increasing numbers of reports about avian IVs, such as the H5N1, H7N7 and H9N2 virus, that have infected humans [2, 3] . As of 02 May 2012, 603 confirmed human cases with avian influenza H5N1 virus were reported to the WHO since 2003; of these patients, 356 died (fatality rate: 59.03%) [4] .",

The RBD consists of three secondary structure elements and four conserved residues: Helix190, Loop130 and Loop220 combined with 98Tyr, 153Trp, 183His, and 195Tyr [13] . The Q226L and G228S mutations in HA of H3N2 and H2N2 virus, correlated with the host switching from SA-a-2,3-Gal to SA-a-2,6-Gal receptor specificity [14] . Actually, as the pocket is shallow, the mutation of one or two residues in the RBD would be responsible for host switching. The S227N mutation resulted in binding to SA-a-2,3-Gal receptors with lower affinity, which caused several human infections in Hong Kong and Egypt [15] . The combination of the Q226L and G228S mutations would be more efficient in binding SA-a-2,6-Gal, though there is no such mutation in H5N1 [16] .",

Among the different subtypes of IV HA, there are extensive variations in the glycosylation sites of the head region, whereas the stem region are more conserved [17] . Glycans near the antigenic epitopes interfere with antibody recognition to escape immune pressure from hosts, and those near HA0 cleavage site protect their infectivity [18, 19] . The gain or loss of glycosylation sites near the RBD can also affect viral receptor recognition [20, 21] . Sun et al. describe several alternative models of glycosylation sites that affect the influenza virus, such as increasing the number of glycosylation sites and changing their positional conversion. One conspicuous feature is that, when a new human epidemic virus emerges, the virus would reveal a high affinity to the host target. As co-evolution occurs with the host, the virulence of the virus would decrease, accompanied by a lower affinity and increasing numbers of glycosylation site [22] .",

According to a nomenclature system devised for H5N1 in 2008, the HAs can be divided into ten phylogenetic clades (0-9), of which three clades, namely clade 0, clade 1 and clade 2, are responsible for most human infections [45] . There was a marked divergence in the last four years, as several new subclades emerged and predominated in the H5N1 epidemics. When some groups in one monophyletic clade meet the divergence criteria (bootstrap values .60), they can split into second, third or even fourth-order clades [46] . [4] . However, several previously circulating clades were not detected for the past 4 years, and it was likely that these clades were supplanted by the new clades. Based on an updated unified nomenclature system, the current circulating H5N1 virus in the past two years are centralized primarily in clades 1. [46] .",

All of the 169N glycosylation site deficiencies presented an avian specificity, and the earliest deficient record was A/Turkey/England/1991, the root of the tree in Figure 3 . This glycosylation site was conserved until 2006; henceforth, sporadic deficiency cases have been reported in China, Vietnam and Egypt. Most of these cases were in clade 2.2.1 or clade 7.1. The conservation rate of the glycosylation on 158N was 47.61%. Strains with glycosylated and non-glycosylated 158N have co-existed extensively even before 1997. According to our phylogenetic analysis, viruses with 158N glycosylation site deficiency existed in nine clades extensively (all except clade 7, Figure 3 To confirm the evolutionary position of the HAs in the PDB and remodel the comparable HA models, further investigation was undertaken in H5N1 HAs from the PDB. Seven H5 HA structure files were available, of which three incomplete structures, 1JSO, 1JSM and 1JSN, represent the A/Duck/ Singapore/3/97 monomer [47] . The files of 2FKO and 3GBM correspond to A/Viet Nam/1203/2004, whereas 2IBX and 3FKU represented A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 [48, 49, 50] . The similarity of the last four HA sequence was 98.27%, with the identical RBD ( Figure 4) . Accordingly, 3GBM would represent four HAs in subsequent experiments due to its minimal structural resolution. Although two strains mentioned above are responsible for human infections, Yamada et al. showed that A/ Viet Nam/1194/2004 still had a high affinity for SA-a-2,3-Gal receptors [49] . Coincidentally, A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 and A/ Viet Nam/1203/2004 belong to clade 1 and both are chosen as candidate vaccine viruses. A/Hong Kong/213/2003 is another definite human virus that also belongs to clade 1. As Figure 4 showed, the RBDs of various H5N1 clades were highly conserved, the only differences among the three strains were residue 227 and the glycosylation site at 158N. A T160A mutation in ''158NST'' would result in the deficiency of this glycosylated site. The RBD in H5N1 HA consists of three secondary structure elements, Loop130, Loop220 and Helix190, together with four 100% conserved residues at the bottom (red). The residues with a conservation rate higher than 99% are labeled in yellow. (B) The statistics of the conserved amino-acid residues in the RBD. The predominant amino-acid residues are underlined, and the number of different types of mutations are shown as various blocks. Those with conservation rates lower than 99% are labeled. All of the residue numbers were adopted from the H3 HA numbering system. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0038794.g002",

The RMSDs and the energies converged in all of the systems, which indicated well-behaved simulations ( Figure 5A ). We found that the helical structure and the overall protein backbones were stable during the whole equilibrium, whereas the loop experienced larger fluctuations relatively. Loop220 may fluctuate more than Loop130 and Helix190, based on their respective RMSFs. Considering the results from the phylogenetic analysis, four most conserved residues, 95Tyr, 153Trp, 183His and 195Tyr, located at the bottom of the RBD, had lower RMSFs compare with the nonconserved residues ( Figure 5B ). By analyzing the MD trajectories, the replaced residues in 03HK would affect their acroteric aminoacid residues. The RMSF of 222Lys in 03HK decreased, which was responsible for the interaction of the basic group in 222Lys with the newly introduced, weakly acidic amide group of the S227N residue, a motion that made the two sides of Loop220 become closer. Moreover, by changing S159N and T160A in 03HK, the RMSFs of the adjacent residues were also changed, which indicated the steric alteration.",

H- bond was the essential interaction in stabilizing ligand-receptor complexes. There were copious polar groups in the receptors and RBD that facilitate hydrogen-bond formation. During the course of dynamic bonding, several persistent and transient hydrogen bonds could be observed: most persistent H-bonds were formed from the hydroxyl groups offered by SA and Gal with the side-chain groups. In all of the docking complexes, the four most conserved residues located at the bottom of the RBD have formed stable H-bonds with SA: the glycerol group in SA interacted with the p-hydroxyphenyl group of 195Tyr, the imidazole group of 183His interacted with the glycerol group of SA and the carboxyl group in SA formed a stable H-bond with the p-hydroxyphenyl group of 95Tyr. Obviously, Loop220 played an important part in the formation of H-bonds with the penultimate Gal. Many observable transient H-bonds were formed from the remainder of sialoglycans and non-conserved residues around the RBD. One typical example was the residue 194Leu or 190Glu, located in Helix190, which would form an H-bond with the antepenultimate GlcNAc/Man, especially in a-2,6-sialoglycans. In various hydrophobic interactions, one common stacking force was formed by the N-acetyl group in SA and 153Trp, whereas other aromatic groups are far from the docking pocket. Several residues, such as Ser226, Trp153, His183, or Gln191, would also form hydrophobic interactions with sialoglycans, as in the previous descriptions [27] .",

A persistent H-bond between 226Gln and Gal formed in several HA-a-2,3-sialoglycan docking complexes but rarely in HA-a-2,6-sialoglycans docking complexes [12] . After the introduction of the S227N mutation, an amide group would interact with the adjacent basic group in 222Lys, forming a more compact Loop220, which moved 226Gln away from its previous position. This change would decrease the probability of the above H-bond formation, which caused most S227N strains exhibiting a decreased affinity for a-2,3-sialoglycans. Moreover, almost all S227N mutations are followed by the loss of the 158N glycosylation site (File S1), the deficiency of this glycosylation site is conducive to bind the a-2,6-sialoglycans.

By conformation analysis of a three-dimensional structure, a concrete target can be found readily.

Conformation analysis showed that the acquisition or deficiency of an N-glycosylation site would be more effective than simple amino-acid residue mutations.

In contrast, the human virus belonging to clade 1.1 or clade 2.3.4 in Southeast Asia were conservative for the 158N glycosylation site. This discrepancy confirms that no close relationship exists between the loss of the 158N glycosylation site and host switching. Moreover, approximately 55 dual-glycosylation site (158N and 169N) deficiency virus were responsible for avian infections, most of which clustered in clade 2.2 during 2007 and 2008.",
