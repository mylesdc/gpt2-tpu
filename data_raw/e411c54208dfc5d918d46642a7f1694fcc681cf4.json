It is estimated that about 4.2 million of deaths are attributed to SARI annually [2] . Estimation in 2010 have shown that 11 million of children aged less than 5 years were admitted for SARI in developing countries, with an estimated case fatality ratio of 2.3%, compared to 570 000 cases and a case fatality ratio of 0.6% in developed countries [3] . In low income countries, the annual incidence of pneumonia is estimated at 151 million children of whom 13% are severe enough to warrant hospitalization [1, 4] . Nearly 2 million children die from pneumonia every year, 70% of which occur in Africa and Southeast Asia [5, 6] . SARI may be caused by various pathogens. While bacterial infections play a critical role in causing life-threatening pneumonia [1, [7] [8] [9] , viral infections are associated with significant proportion that range from mild to severe infections [10, 11] . However, due to the lack of gold standard methods to rapidly differentiate between viral and bacterial infections, most of the patients may be treated empirically with antibiotics [12] . Rapid etiologic diagnosis is therefore needed to select the most appropriate treatment protocol and to avoid the development of bacterial resistance.",

So far, only few sub-Saharan African countries are collecting data on hospitalization associated to acute respiratory illness [14] [15] [16] . In Madagascar, the sentinel syndromic surveillance has been collecting SARI data since 2010. However, hospitals only collect few data that are not exploitable for analysis. Thus, data are still scarce regarding the epidemiology of SARI in this country. During the last influenza pandemic in 2009, an excess of mortality was observed among inhabitant of the main capital city of Antananarivo [17] . Following the pandemic, health authorities requested to develop an active surveillance of SARI in order to better understand the epidemiology of this disease in the context of Madagascar. The present study aimed to identify etiologies of SARI and to assess clinical features of hospitalization linked to SARI in 2 hospitals during 3 years of surveillance.",

Most of the included patients were children less than 5 years old (78.5%). This study confirms that young children are the most vulnerable group to suffer from SARI [22, 23] .

The increased circulation of RSV that coincided with the peak of SARI cases may be informative for clinicians to predict an epidemic due to RSV and to choose the most appropriate care for patients in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics.

Nevertheless, it is not clear what this high proportion of bacteria means due to the notion of carriage. The substantial rate of S. pneumoniae detected might be partly explained by the very low pneumococcal vaccination rate among the younger population (estimated at 0.4%) because most of the positive cases were detected before the introduction of pneumococcal vaccine into the expanded program on immunization (EPI) in Madagascar in 2012 [33] . This vaccine is believed to reduce substantially the burden of pneumococcal disease. Thus, it would be interesting to evaluate the proportion of SARI associated to S. pneumoniae more than 5 years after the introduction of the vaccine in Madagascar. On the other hand, the role of atypical bacteria in hospitalized ARI is poorly understood. One assumes that certain bacteria predispose to bacterial super-infections [34] . While RV is considered as the common cold virus, the present study showed that this virus accounted for 14% of total SARI cases. This finding highlights the potential role of RV in public health like other authors already postulated [35] [36] [37] .",

First, data were collected only from 2 sites that are not representative of the whole population preventing us to real estimate the prevalence at the national level. Indeed, prevalence of each pathogen may differ for regions having different bioclimatic or demographic patterns, access to healthcare, and connectivity. Since children are more at risk to develop severe infection, our sampling was skewed toward the younger group and likely underestimate the prevalence in adult. Indeed, few adult cases had been identified at the adult ward mainly because the duration of symptoms prior to admission exceeded the 7 days limit of our SARI case definition. It was also observed that severe cases were treated on external consultation or admitted at the emergency department for a few hours and then discharged. Patients that did not recover, worsened at home, and returned to the hospital were then admitted resulting in prolonged duration of illness (usually more than 7 days) at the time of admission. Another limitation is to attribute the pathogen(s) that is (are) the main cause that lead to severe illness. Indeed, we could not exclude that some pathogens may be present due to carriage.",

Further challenges in such program include efforts to implement strategies that capture adult cases as it is relevant to measure the impact of SARI in this population. Since vaccines play an important role in preventing SARI, vaccination against important pathogens, including RSV, should be accessible at least for high-risk population in developing countries. Indeed, although use of synthetic antibodies against RSV can be provided to certain at-risk infants, this treatment only provides a short-term protection, is not always effective, and is also expensive, putting it beyond the reach of developing countries like Madagascar.",
