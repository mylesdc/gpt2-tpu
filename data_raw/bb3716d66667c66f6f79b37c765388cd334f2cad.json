Rotaviruses (RVs) are a major cause of diarrhoea among infants, young children, immunocompromised people, and domesticated animals. Our work is first to determine anti-RV activity of marama bean and tuber ethanol and water extracts; in this case on intestinal enterocyte cells of human infant (H4), adult pig (CLAB) and adult bovine (CIEB) origin. Marama cotyledon ethanolic extract (MCE) and cotyledon water extract (MCW) without RV were not cytotoxic to all cells tested, while seed coat and tuber extracts showed variable levels of cytotoxicity. Marama cotyledon ethanolic and water extracts (MCE and MCW, resp.) (\u22650.1 mg/mL), seed coat extract (MSCE) and seed coat water extract (MSCW) (0.01 to 0.001 mg/mL), especially ethanolic, significantly increased cell survival and enhanced survival to cytopathic effects of RV by at least 100% after in vitro co-and preincubation treatments. All marama extracts used significantly enhanced nitric oxide release from H4 cells and enhanced TER (\u03a9/cm 2 ) of enterocyte barriers after coincubation with RV. Marama cotyledon and seed coat extracts inhibited virion infectivity possibly through interference with replication due to accumulation of nitric oxide. Marama extracts are therefore promising microbicides against RV.",

These may include phenolic constituents, carbohydrates, and certain fatty acids, among many components. Large amounts of gallic acid have been detected in T. esculentum plant [3] . Gallic acid esterifies with glucose, the resultant hydrolysable tannins (HTs), secondary metabolites widely distributed in the plant kingdom, are known to be effective antagonists against viruses [3] . Tylosema esculentum tubers contain yet to be determined phenolics [3] . High amounts of phytosterols have also been detected in T. esculentum oil (about 75% of all phytosterols being 4-desmethylsterols and about 15.72% of the total being 4,4-dimethylsterols) [4] . Rotavirus (RV) infections are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children, accounting for about 611,000 deaths each year worldwide, mostly in developing countries [5] . Rotavirus is also an important pathogen in many agricultural species, inducing serious diarrhoeal diseases in neonatal and postweaning pigs and calves [6] [7] [8] . Rotavirus infection is limited to the mature enterocytes of the tips of the intestinal villi of humans, domestic animals, and mice, leading to severe gastroenteritis in the young [9] . Some strains of bovine and human RV have high sequence homology and interspecific infectivity, both implying phylogenetic relatedness [10, 11] . Previous in vitro tests of the bovine RF strain of RV on human, pig, chicken, and goat intestine epithelial cells in our laboratory have shown interspecific infectivity of rotavirus [12] , and, therefore, the bovine strain of rotavirus was used to infect human and pig intestinal cells in the current study.",

Survival of CLAB and H4 cells was moderately to highly correlated to release of nitric oxide (r = 0.79 and r = 0.43, resp.); similarly very high positive correlation was observed in levels of nitric oxide release from H4 and CLAB cells (r = 0.9) exposed to T. esculentum extracts (Table 3 ).

Coincubation of RV and marama seed coat ethanolic extract (MSCE), cotyledon ethanolic extract (MCE), or tuber water extract (MTW) on H4 cells resulted in generally higher enhancement of TER than Combivir throughout 67hour test period. Enhancement of polarity across intestinal epithelial cells can be an important mechanism to control entry of RV across the intestinal epithelial barrier. Rotaviruses are known to disrupt tight junctions, resulting in loss of transepithelial resistance (TER) [13] , but without cell death during viral replication [35] ; hence T. esculentum bean seed coat and cotyledon ethanolic extracts (MSCE and MCE, resp.) and T. esculentum tuber water extract (MTW) can reduce entry of RV across the intestinal barrier in vitro.

It is herein suggested that the observed inactivation of RV may be through interference with either viral replication or capacity to bind to permissive cells. Clark et al. [36] have shown that some phenolic acids, which were expected to dominate the ethanolic extracts, have inactivation effect against RV. Similar observations were also made with extracts from peppermint, sage, and lemon balm leaves, which were highly inhibitive against HIV [37] . The inhibitive effects of T. esculentum extracts, especially seed coat and cotyledon ethanolic extract (MSCE and MCE) and tuber water extract (MTW) (\u2265100%), could additionally be due to enhanced release of nitric oxide (NO) from intestinal cells. Nitric oxide has been shown to inactivate RV, mainly by inhibiting replication of the virus [38, 39] . The observed enhancement of nitric oxide release from the human and pig cells was viewed as one of the mechanisms T. esculentum crude extracts can induce a nonspecific immune response in intestinal epithelium.",

            "text": "Certain plant phytochemicals have been shown to inhibit RV activity through inhibition of viral penetration and viral replication. Some flavonoids were shown to inhibit penetration of RV in rhesus monkey epithelial cell line (MA104) [31] , while others have an effect on the viruses or on the enzymes responsible for their replication [40] . These effects could not be singly demonstrated in this study; further work on these possible mechanisms of antiviral effects of T. esculentum extracts is, therefore, encouraged. The observed antirotaviral effects can be attributed to the high phenolic acid content (especially gallic acid), in bean cotyledons, among other components (Marama II report, unpublished). Gallic acid was previously shown to prevent viral replication, inhibition of virus attachment to and penetration into cells, and virucidal effects [41] . Interference with attachment and penetration into cells could not be proved in this study. Tylosema esculentum tubers may contain some yet to be determined phenolics (Marama II report, unpublished). Ethanolic extracts had notably higher antiviral activity than aqueous bean and tuber extracts (Figures 3  and 6 ). Some essential oils as found in T. esculentum beans may contribute towards the observed antiviral effects; similar findings were reported by Astani et al. [42] using essential oils extracted from Melaleuca alternifolia. Moreover, recently, a Kunitz-type inhibitor, distinct from other known plant serine protease inhibitors and shown to be specific for elastase, was isolated in T. esculentum beans [43] . The quantity of this elastase inhibitor present in T. esculentum beans is many times greater than in soybean or any other bean or nut source reported to date [43] . Certain protease inhibitors have been shown to impart high antienteroviral effects through interference with proteolytic cleavage during the replication process [44] . The high phytosterol content of T. esculentum bean oil 4-desmethylsterols (75%) and 4.4-dimethylsterols and 4-monomethylsterols (15.72%) [4] could also contribute to the high antiviral activity in bean extracts. Phytosterols have been determined to have antihuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and antiherpes simplex virus (HSV) effects [45] . The antiviral activity of phytosterols is through the blocking effect on immediate-early antigen expression in fibroblast cells and blocking of virus-cell interaction and/or virus multiplication [45] .",

Mechanisms of antiviral action may include release of nitric oxide and may also interfere with viral cytopathic effects (as shown by moderate to high positive correlation between survival from rotavirus and release of nitric oxide), inactivation of RV (inhibition of virus replication or entry into cells may be responsible), possibly through interference with replication, and enhancement of tight junctions (though not directly related to levels of survival) (Figure 1 ). Our findings suggest that T. esculentum beans can be an important source of microbicides against RV. Further phytochemical characterization of T. esculentum extracts, identification of the responsible bioactive compounds, and the elucidation of other modes of action and quality standard studies are essential.",

While pretreatment of RV with all T. esculentum extracts resulted in significant enhancement of all cell types used (CLAB, CIEB, and H4 cells), T. esculentum seed coat water extract (MSCW) significantly reduced cytopathic effects of RV at the lowest concentration (0.001 mg/mL), implying high potency of this extract. Additionally other extracts significantly reduced cytopathic effects of RV, namely, T. esculentum cotyledon extracts (MCE 1 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL; MCW 2 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL). There was species-specific improvement in cell survival by the extracts, mainly bovine intestinal epithelial (CIEB) showed the highest response to pretreatment of virus with extracts.
