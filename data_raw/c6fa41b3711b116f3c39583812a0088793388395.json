            "text": "Survival of mosquitoes from dengue virus (DENV) infection is a prerequisite of viral transmission to the host. This study aimed to see how mosquito cells can survive the infection during prosperous replication of the virus. In C6/36 cells, global protein translation was shut down after infection by DENV type 2 (DENV2). However, it returned to a normal level when infected cells were treated with an inhibitor of the protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) signaling pathway. Based on a 7-Methylguanosine 5 -triphosphate (m7GTP) pull-down assay, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex was also identified in DENV2-infected cells. This suggests that most mosquito proteins are synthesized via canonical cap-dependent translation. When the PERK signal pathway was inhibited, both accumulation of reactive oxygen species and changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential increased. This suggested that ER stress response was alleviated through the PERK-mediated shutdown of global proteins in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells. In the meantime, the activities of caspases-9 and -3 and the apoptosis-related cell death rate increased in C6/36 cells with PERK inhibition. This reflected that the PERK-signaling pathway is involved in determining cell survival, presumably by reducing DENV2-induced ER stress. Looking at the PERK downstream target, \u03b1-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1), an increased phosphorylation status was only shown in infected C6/36 cells. This indicated that recruitment of ribosome binding to the mRNA 5 -cap structure could have been impaired in cap-dependent translation. It turned out that shutdown of cellular protein translation resulted in a pro-survival effect on mosquito cells in response to DENV2 infection. As synthesis of viral proteins was not affected by the PERK signal pathway, an alternate mode other than cap-dependent translation may be utilized. This finding provides insights into elucidating how the PERK signal pathway modulates dynamic translation of proteins and helps mosquito cells survive continuous replication of the DENV2. It was ecologically important for virus amplification in mosquitoes and transmission to humans.",

            "text": "Dengue fever is caused by infection of dengue viruses (DENVs), leading to a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms including asymptomatic or undifferentiated febrile illness and sometimes severe forms of symptoms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [1] . The virus is naturally transmitted between humans by Aedes mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti [2] , meaning that it is able to grow in both arthropod and human/mammalian cells. DENVs and other flaviviruses are dependent on the host endoplasm reticulum (ER) for translation, replication and packaging of their genome [3] . It results in inducing the unfolded protein response (UPR) because of the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER [4] . The UPR is composed of three different classes of ER stress transducers, i.e., inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) and protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) signaling pathways [5] . All of these consist of a luminal domain and a cytosolic domain; the luminal domain recognizes unfolded/misfolded proteins inside the ER, while the cytosolic domain relays signals to turn on downstream genes [5] . DENV infection in mammalian cells mostly leads to death, necrosis and/or apoptosis, due to the persistence of the UPR [6, 7] ; which has also been observed in mosquito cells [8] .",

Such translational control by the virus may help cells subvert ER stress [10] . The PERK signal pathway may be an important factor as it is usually activated and subsequently phosphorylates the downstream effector, \u03b1-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1), which functions to suppress general protein translation [4, 11] . Modulation of the UPR in DENV-infected cells was found to override the shutting down of translation, delay cell death and prolong the viral life cycle [12] . The UPR was also identified in mosquito cells with DENV2 infection [8] . However, it usually does not impair the growth of those cells [13] , frequently leading to persistent infection in mosquito cells [14, 15] . Regulation of the UPR via virus-controlled translation of cellular proteins could be critical for a cell's fate during infection in both mammalian and mosquito cells.",

            "text": "Protein translation initiation of messenger RNA (mRNA) in cells is generally implemented by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, which is composed of the cap-binding protein, eIF4E, the RNA helicase, eIF4A, the adaptor protein, eIF4G and other essential proteins [16] . The complex functions to link 7-methylGpppG caps at the 5 -end and poly-A tails at the 3 -end [17] . This machinery requires the binding of eIF4E to the cap structure during initiation of mRNA translation. Therefore, this process is called cap-dependent translation and is implemented by most proteins translated for physiological purposes [18] . Cap-dependent translation is initiated by activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (TOR; mTOR) that phosphorylates eIF4E-BP in response to extracellular stimuli in such viral infections [19] . For instance, inhibiting cap-dependent translation may thus shut down protein translation of cells infected by the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [20, 21] . Based on our previous reports about mosquito cell responses to DENV2 infection [8, 22] , we herein aimed to demonstrate and discuss how DENV2 regulates protein translation and subsequent cell survival via the PERK signaling pathway in mosquito cells. Hypothetically, the result could be applied to elucidate how the mosquito vector can healthily transmit the DENV and maybe other arboviruses to the host. ",

Furthermore, protein shutdown was not shown in cells inoculated with UV-inactivated DENV2 for 24 h, while it was observed in untreated DENV2 ( Figure 1D ). In the meantime, total proteins were obviously reduced in cells treated with different concentrations of tunicamycin (Tm), which is known as a strong ER stress inducer ( Figure 1E ). This reveals that shutdown of global protein translation triggered by DENV2 entering C6/36 cells was compatible to that treated with the ER stress inducer. SUnSET also showed that total protein synthesis decreased in cells infected with untreated DENV2, but there was no obvious change in cells inoculated with a UV-inactivated virus; (E) In C6/36 cells treated with tunicamycin (Tm), a strong endoplasmic reticular (ER) stress inducer, for 6 h, the expression of total proteins decreased, even when the concentration of the drug was as low as 2 \u03bcg/mL.",

Though off-target-effects have ever been of concern, this drug seems to be specific enough for observation on its functional trend of PERK inhibition [27, 28] . The result showed that inhibition Viruses 2017, 9, 262 11 of 23 of total protein translation was recovered ( Figure 4A ). Statistically, it returned to a level close to normal, showing an insignificant difference between PERKi-treated cells with and without infected by DENV2 (Student's t-test; p > 0.05) ( Figure 4B) . Dengue viral proteins, capsid (C) and NS3, remained to be synthesized in PERK inhibitor-treated C6/36 cells even those that have been infected by DENV2 for 48 h ( Figure 4C ). No significant difference of protein amounts was shown between cells with and without PERK inhibitor treatment ( Figure 4D ). Meanwhile, no significant difference of viral RNA level was shown between cells with and without PERK inhibitor treatment ( Figure 4E ). In addition, no obvious morphological defects were observed in cells treated with the inhibitor for up to 48 h ( Figure 4F ), indicating that at 5 \u00b5M, the PERK inhibitor did not have adverse effects on cells. Moreover, reduced protein translation in cells treated with tunicamycin (Tm) was recovered by adding the PERK inhibitor at 5 \u00b5M ( Figure 4G ). In the meantime, phosphorylated (p-) eIF2\u03b1 was shown to increase after treatment with Tm, but returned to be a lower level of amount when the PERK inhibitor was added ( Figure 4G ). The eIF2\u03b1 is known to be a key downstream target of the PERK signaling pathway and involved in protein translation in eukaryotic cells [29] . This suggested that the PERK signaling pathway is involved in regulating cellular protein translation when ER stress is induced by DENV2 in mosquito cells.",

A similar reaction was also observed in mammalian cells infected with lytic RNA and DNA viruses [32, 33] . This suggests that arboviral infections in host cells, either mammal or mosquito derived, change the translation of cellular proteins [34] . Within cells, proteins are generally synthesized using mRNA as a template; this has been highly conserved across species of eukaryotes throughout evolution [35] . It usually follows a cap-dependent translation mode [18] ; which is generally regulated by activated mTOR, which contributes to the phosphorylation and activation of eIF4E-BP and the ribosomal protein, S6 kinase (S6K) [36] . A TOR-mediated pathway may have been involved in such cap-dependent translation, which may be inhibited when dephosphorylated eIF4E-BP binds to eIF4E and thus prevents the formation of the eIF4F complex [24] . This is compatible with our observations in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells, indicating that global cellular proteins are translated by a cap-dependent translation mode [37] . Normally, they are processed by the 40S ribosomal subunit that binds in the vicinity of the cap structure at the 5 -end of mRNA and scans until an AUG codon in the mRNA is encountered [18, 38] .",

The dual luciferase reporter assay in this study also supported that DENV2 infection negatively regulates cap-dependent translation in C6/36 cells. eIF2\u03b1 being obviously phosphorylated in C6/36 cells with DENV2 infection firmly demonstrates that Met-tRNAi binding to the 40S ribosome may have been impaired, even though the eIF4F complex eventually formed [39, 40] .",

            "text": "The UPR as mentioned above is caused by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER; which actually resulted in changes in X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and splicing activity [41] . The UPR generally leads to activation of three signaling pathways including PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 [5, 42] . Apparently, the PERK signaling pathway is highly involved in modulating the dynamic translation of cellular proteins and subsequently regulating ER stress induced by DENV2 infection. Interestingly, decreased translation of global cellular proteins in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells significantly recovered once a PERK inhibitor (GSK2606414) was applied to cells. This indicates that the PERK signaling pathway was activated in response to DENV2 infection, leading to suppressed translation of mosquito proteins. In the meantime, PERK inhibition in this study was further shown to increase MMP changes and ROS accumulation, indicating that DENV2-induced ER stress may be reduced by activating the PERK signal pathway since such cellular responses were not evidently shown in uninfected PERKi-treated cells (Figures S1-S3) . It is known that GSK2606414 is a small molecule that inhibits PERK phosphorylation [27] . Thus, it may reduce eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [29] , resulting in enhanced efficiency of protein translation and the increase of ER stress levels in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells. In addition to ER stress, initiator and effector caspases and the apoptosis rate also obviously increased in DENV2-infected C6/36 cells after the PERK signal pathway was inhibited. This revealed that DENV2-induced ER stress in mosquito cells can be alleviated via the shutdown of cellular proteins by eIF2\u03b1, which was phosphorylated by the PERK signal pathway. Undoubtedly, this pro-survival \"byproduct\" of mosquito cells was also advantageous for viral replication. Indeed, a similar feature was also observed infected by DENV [43] .",

However, it raises an interesting question of how the virus translates its proteins for continuous replication. Although DENVs possess an m7GpppN cap structure at the 5 -end of genomic RNA, they lack a poly A-tail at the 3 -end [46] . As a result, DENVs may utilize a unique mode for protein translation, likely a cap-independent process [26, 47] .

This phenomenon is relatively important for elucidating how the mosquito vector can healthily serve as a transmitter of DENV and may-be other arboviruses, as well. ",

However, it had increased by 48 hpi (2.52-fold increase) compared to the two control groups (1.20-and 1.18-fold for untreated and DMSO-treated cells, respectively; Student's t-test; *** p < 0.001); (B) A similar changing trend of caspase-3 was seen in the same cell group, having remained unchanged at 24 hpi, but having significantly increased at 48 hpi (2.13-fold increase) compared to the control groups (1.29-fold for the untreated and 1.17-fold for the DMSO-treated group; Student's t-test; *** p < 0.001).

(A) The C6/36 cells were infected with DENV2 at MOI of one, then treated with 5 \u03bcM PERK inhibitor or DMSO. The activity of eIF2\u03b1 was shown to increase the degree of phosphorylation in response to viral infection, while its protein level mostly remained at a stable level. On the other hand, the amount of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 was significantly reduced when the PERK inhibitor was applied to infected cells. As synthesis of the NS3 viral protein did not show an evident change even when cells had been infected for 24 h, an alternative mechanism for translation of viral proteins in C6/36 cells may exist; (B) Statistically, levels of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 significantly increased (Student's t-test; ** p < 0.01) in cells without PERK inhibitor treatment and in those cells treated with DMSO only. In contrast, there was no significant difference between DENV2-infected cells and the control groups (Student's t-test; p > 0.05).
