            "text": "The aim was to study associations between work and home environment and prevalence and incidence of respiratory health and a history of atopy in a 3-y cohort of commercial pilots. A questionnaire was mailed in 1997 to all pilots in a Scandinavian airline company (N = 622); 577 (93%) participated. The same questionnaire was sent to the participants 3 years later, 436 participated (76%). There were questions on asthma, respiratory symptoms and infections, allergies, the cabin environment, psychosocial environment and the home environment. Associations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, calculating odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The incidence of doctors' diagnosed asthma and atopy were 2.4 and 16.6 per 1000 person years, respectively. Pilots changing type of flight during follow-up got more airway infections (OR = 11.27; 95% CI 2.39-53.14). Those reporting decreased work control (OR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.03-3.31 for 1 unit change) and those with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home (OR = 3.73; 95% CI 1.09-12.83) had a higher incidence of atopy during follow up. Dampness or mould at home was associated with a higher prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR = 3.55; 95% CI 1.43-8.82) and airway infections (OR = 3.12 95% CI 1.27-7.68). Window pane condensation in winter at home, reported at baseline, was associated with increased incidence of asthma symptoms (OR = 4.14; 95% CI 1.32-12.97) and pilots living in newer buildings at baseline had a higher incidence of airway infections (OR = 5.23; 95% CI 1.43-19.10). In conclusion, lack of work control and ETS at home can be a risk factors for development of allergic symptoms in pilots. Window pane condensation at home can be a risk factor for incidence of asthma symptoms. Dampness and mould at home can be a risk factor for prevalence of asthma symptoms and airway infections and living in newer buildings can be a risk factor for incidence of airway infections.",

Furry pet allergens in settled dust in the indoor environment can cause allergic reactions among sensitized subjects. Our previous study investigated levels of furry pet allergens and fungal DNAs by analysing dust collected from the cockpit as well as from the aircraft cabin. Furry pet allergen levels were found in elevated levels in the cockpit as well as in the cabin environment. The mean concentration of cat (Fel d1), dog (Can f1), and horse (Equ cx) allergens in the cockpit were 3.5\u03bcg, 2.4\u03bcg, and 10.8\u03bcg per gram dust respectively [22] . The concentration of total fungal DNA in the cockpit was 3.86 \u00c3 10 4 cell equivalents (CE) per gram dust. The concentration of Aspergillus/Penicillium DNA and Aspergillus versicolor DNA were 6.14 \u00c3 10 3 CE/g and 44 CE/g respectively [22] .",

Besides the psychosocial work environment, the ban of smoking on board for Scandinavian airlines started from 1 Sep, 1997. Before that smoking was allowed and the level of respirable particles was high in the cockpit environment [19, 25] . Beneficial effects of ban of smoking on board with respect to eye symptoms and tiredness among pilots has been reported [25] , but we found no previous studies evaluated the effects of ban of smoking on board with respect to respiratory illness and allergies among pilots.",

The second set was about, specific work environment factors for airline crew, including flight type (long-/short-haul flight) and psychosocial work environment. Short haul flights were defined as flights within Europe with duration of less than 7 hours. Long haul flights were defined as intercontinental flights between Scandinavia and America or Asia with flight duration of 7-12 hours. The third set was about current home environment. The fourth set was about asthma, bronchitis, nonspecific hyperreactivity, and airway infections. The questions on asthma and respiratory symptoms were obtained from European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) [26] , and two Swedish population studies [24, 27] . The questions on psychosocial work conditions were obtained from a standardized indoor questionnaire (MM 040 NA) developed by the Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine in \u00d6rebro University Hospital [28] .The questions on specific work environment factors relevant for airline crews were obtained from another questionnaire [6] , which was developed by the Clinic for Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University.

The home environment seemed to be the most important indoor environment with respect to prevalence and incidence of respiratory illnesses and self-reported allergy. Dampness/mould at home was a risk factor for prevalence of asthma symptoms and window pane condensation in winter was a risk factor for incidence of asthma symptoms. Moreover, living in a newly constructed home was associated with a higher incidence of airway infections and pilots exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home had a higher incidence of atopy. We could find a few associations between working conditions and health. Changing type of flight (long or short haul flight) was associated with new onset of airway infections and those reporting that they got less control of their working conditions during the follow up developed more atopy (self-reported pollen or furry pet allergy). The study has some strengths and limitations. It is based on historical data for pilots from one airline company collected around 15 years ago. The study is unique and we found no previous longitudinal study on development of asthma, bronchitis, nonspecific hyperreactivity and airway infections among pilots. However, the number of incident cases was relatively low, which limits the power of the study. Despite this limitation we found a number of significant associations but sometimes with wide confidence intervals. Moreover, the study only covered pilots from one airline company which could limit the generalizability of the study. Another limitation is that we did not have any clinical tests to diagnose airway infections, asthma or pollen or furry pet allergy (self-reported atopy). However, some validation studies on e.

            "text": "questionnaire data on asthma and allergy are available. A review article concluded that selfreported data on doctors' diagnosed asthma has high specificity (94%) when validating against clinical diagnosis but lower sensitivity (68%) [31] . Three European validation studies of selfreported allergy to pollen or furry pets in adults, using objective allergy testing as gold standard, found good specificity (89-97%) but lower sensitivity (28-55%) for self-reported allergy [32] [33] [34] Thus a majority of those reporting doctors' diagnosed asthma, pollen or furry pet allergy could be expected to have asthma or atopic sensitization (allergy), and an underestimation rather than an overestimation of the true prevalence could be expected. Epidemiological studies can be influenced by selection bias and information bias (recall bias). The study population consisted of all Stockholm based pilots in one Scandinavian airline company. The participation rate was 93% at baseline investigation, and 76% of those participants at baseline. Despite the relatively high participation rate, we found that nonparticipants were older and had a higher prevalence of wheeze and nonspecific hyperreactivity at baseline, as compared to participants. Moreover, nonparticipants were less satisfied with their working conditions and were less exposed to ETS on board at baseline. These results indicate a health based selection where more healthy pilots tended to join the cohort, which could lead to an underestimation of the risks of the work exposure. However, for home environment exposure, we found no difference between participants and nonparticipants. The questionnaire included questions on the symptoms, as well as questions about the work environment and the home environment. This may introduce recall bias in the cross-sectional analysis. However, in the longitudinal analysis of new onset and development of symptoms over three years, when baseline data on exposure was used, recall bias should not be a major concern. Changes of work or home environment factors from baseline to follow up is not further discussed since it has been reported in a previous publication from the study [8] . Most of the pilots (94.7%) were men, mean age at baseline was 45 y. At baseline, totally eleven pilots reported that they had ever had asthma and six of them had the asthma diagnosed by a doctor (1.4%). The low prevalence of doctor's diagnosed asthma could be due to selection since pilots have regular medical examinations, and are not allowed to have severe or uncontrolled asthma. However, mild or moderate asthma is allowed if it is well controlled [35] . The incidence of doctors' diagnosed asthma was 2.4 cases per 1000 person\u00c1years in our study, if we exclude the pilot reporting asthma, not diagnosed by a doctor, at baseline. A Swedish population based cohort study (mean age 34 years at baseline) from 1980-1993 reported that the overall incidence rate of adult onset asthma was 1.1 per 1000 person\u00c1years, 1.0 per 1000 person\u00c1years among males, Table 6 .

Thus we can conclude that the incidence of doctor diagnosed asthma in our study among commercial pilots was similar as in the general population in Northern Europe. In our study, the prevalence of self-reported atopy (pollen or furry pet allergy) was 20.4% at baseline and the incidence rate was 16.6 per 1000 person\u00c1years during follow-up. The prevalence among the pilots was higher than the 14% of pollen or furry pet allergy reported from a study from 1997 in a random sample of the Swedish population follow-up [38] . We found no study on incidence of atopy in the general adult population in Sweden from the same time period as our study. Female pilots had a higher prevalence of asthma symptoms (borderline significance p = 0.059) and significantly more nonspecific hyperreactivity than men. The small proportion of female pilots makes the confidence intervals wide when comparing men and women. The higher prevalence of asthma symptoms among female pilots is in agreement with other population studies reporting a higher prevalence of asthma symptoms in women [37] . One study reported that females have stronger airway response to cigarette smoke, fuels or other pollutants [39] and that they can be more exposed to perfumes, cooking fumes and cleaning detergents [39] .",

It could be a selection effect, where pilots who easily get airway infections leave the occupation. It could also be that age is associated with the family situation. Older pilots may have less smaller children at home who can bring infections from schools or day care centres to the family. Moreover, we found that the prevalence of airway infections was positively associated with atopy. We found no previous population study from Sweden on associations between atopy and airway infections among adults. Finally, we found that smokers reported more bronchitis but less nonspecific hyper-reactivity in the cross-sectional study. It is well known that smokers develop bronchitis [40] , but the negative association between smoking and nonspecific hyper-reactivity was unexpected. However, the question on nonspecific hyperreactivity asked about irritation easily in eyes or airways when exposed to traffic exhausts, perfume or tobacco smoke and the negative association could be because smokers are more used to environmental tobacco smoke. However, since smokers have a lower ability to smell and taste [41, 42] , they may have less ability to perceive sensory irritation from odours or irritants.",

This indicator of dampness was associated with incidence of asthma symptoms. Moreover, change of window pane condensation status was associated with incidence of asthma symptoms. Window pane condensation in winter as a proxy variable for poor indoor environment have been studied in Sweden. It is a sign of damp indoor environment and is a risk factor for growth of house dust mites in homes [43] . Homes with reported window pane condensation in winter has significantly lower air exchange rate, higher relative air humidity and higher levels of house dust mite allergens and total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) as compared to homes without window condensation [44] . Window pane condensation has been reported to be associated with increased prevalence of wheeze in children in Sweden [45] and female university students in Japan [46] . In addition, we asked about presence of signs of dampness and mould the last 12 months in the home [26] . Reports on dampness or mould at home were associated with increased prevalence of asthma symptoms and airway infections. This finding is in agreement with previous studies and a review from WHO have concluded that there is sufficient evidence that dampness and mould is associated with asthma symptoms [47] symptoms. Dampness and mold have also been reported to be associated with respiratory infections [48] .",

We found that those living in newer home buildings (after 1975) had a higher incidence of airway infections. In a previous population study among adults in Sweden, there was an increased prevalence of respiratory infections among adults living in houses constructed from 1976-1985 while no increased prevalence was observed for homed constructed after 1985. In this study, adults living in buildings constructed before 1960 were used as reference category [49] . The drastic increase of the energy price in 1975 initiated measures to reduce the energy consumption in Swedish buildings. Moreover, a self-level mortal containing casein was used in Swedish buildings from 1997-1983. This product caused emission of odorous compounds such as ammonia and 2-acetophenone from the floor [50] . Thus it is possible that the increased prevalence of respiratory infections among pilots living in homes constructed after 1975 was due to energy saving measures as well as the introduction of new building materials, resulting in an impairment of the indoor environment. Moreover, one recent study from South Korea found that moving to a new house may increase the prevalence of asthma symptoms [51] .",
