            "text": "Background: In 2009, China launched a health reform to promote the equalization of national essential public health services package (NEPHSP). The present study aimed to describe the financing strategies and mechanisms to improve access to public health for all, identify the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches, and showed evidence on equity improvement among different regions. Methods: We reviewed the relevant literatures and identified 208 articles after screening and quality assessment and conducted six key informants' interviews. Secondary data on national and local government health expenditures, NEPHSP coverage and health indicators in 2003-2014 were collected, descriptive and equity analyses were used. Results: Before 2009, the government subsidy to primary care institutions (PCIs) were mainly used for basic construction and a small part of personnel expenses. Since 2009, the new funds for NEPHSP have significantly expanded service coverage and population coverage. These funds have been allocated by central, provincial, municipal and county governments at different proportions in China's tax distribution system. Due to the fiscal transfer payment, the Central Government allocated more subsides to less-developed western regions and all the funds were managed in a specific account. Several types of payment methods have been adopted including capitation, pay for performance (P4P), pay for service items, global budget and public health voucher, to address issues from both the supply and demand sides. The equalization of NEPHSP did well through the establishment of health records, systematic care of children and maternal women, etc. Our data showed that the gap between the eastern, central and western regions narrowed. However the coverage for migrants was still low and performance was needed improving in effectiveness of managing patients with chronic diseases. Conclusions: The delivery of essential public health services was highly influenced by public fiscal policy, and the implementation of health reform since 2009 has led the public health development towards the right direction. However China still needs to increase the fiscal investments to expand service coverage as well as promote the quality of public health services and equality among regions. Independent scientific monitoring and evaluation are also needed.",

After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese government made various innovations for better delivery of public health services. For example, at the beginning of 1960s, China launched a village doctor training program to create a front-line workforce, providing public health services and essential medical services including clinical treatment and drugs [1, 2] . In addition, disease prevention and primary care were the two most important tools at that time and people were able to receive some basic vaccines to prevent infectious diseases. All of these interventions lead to great health outcomes in China [3] .",

In the 2009 health care reform policy, an essential public health package, including nine types of basic services and six types of catastrophic services, was launched. The PCIs including community health care centers, township hospitals and village clinics provided basic services and the specialized public health institutions like centers for disease control (CDCs) provided catastrophic services. The government regulated the guideline for basic services and provided training for public health workers. The financial supports were shared by the central and the local governments. Until 2015, the package included 12 types of basic services and seven types of catastrophic services. The budget per capita for basic services increased from 15 Renminbi (RMB) in 2009 to 40 RMB in 2015. Almost every Chinese citizen has equal access to this essential public health package. By summarizing China's experiences and lessons learned during development of both public health service systems and financing strategies, especially with regard to improving universal access, the present study will provide significant policy implications for public health development and health systems strengthening in other developing countries.",

Policy articles or other documents and reports on public health revenue collection, management, allocation, or financing strategies for improving access to public health for all were included. Two reviewers identified titles and abstracts of all articles from the search, and retrieved the full text articles. Finally, we obtained a total of 208 literatures studies after data screening. The following literature information has been collected from relevant studies including background, content, mechanism and effect of the policy interventions. The main results and conclusions in the reviewed studies have been extracted.

Government procurement of public health services refers to the following two ways, government proposes specific tasks, objectives, requirements and assessment criteria, and PCIs provide free essential public health services to people. The government allocated the public health fund in terms of seven kinds of financial payment methods [34] : capitation, line budget, salary, pay for performance [33, 35] , global budget [36, 37] , fee for Service [38, 39] and public health voucher [14, 40, 41] . Actually mixed payment methods were often used in practice. The government also purchase the public health services by signing a contract with the private sector such as village doctors and the latter receive a modest subsidy for providing public health services associated with the package. The willingness of village doctors to provide public health services has been improved since the introduction of the package and a minimum subsidy, although village doctors do not find the subsidy to be sufficient remuneration for their efforts [42] [43] [44] .",

Before the current policy of essential public health service equalization, public funds were only available for staff salaries but not institutional management. As a result, strategic performance of the public health services suffered. After adoption of the policy, pooled government procurement of services has led to greater purchasing efficiency for public health services. Health workers in PCIs are additionally more motivated, because their compensations are linked to performance assessment. Furthermore, the government can purchase services provided by private sector actors such as village doctors, in order to effectively alleviate public health workforce shortages. ",

Both process indicators and outcome indicators are used to evaluate NEPHSP policy. Process indicators are mostly service utilization indicators, used to measure the process effects of resources allocation. Outcome indicators are used to reflect the final outcomes of the resource allocation.
