            "text": "The emergence of neurotropic Zika virus (ZIKV) raised a public health emergency of global concern. ZIKV can cross the placental barrier and infect foetal brains, resulting in microcephaly, but the pathogenesis of ZIKV is poorly understood. With recent findings reporting AXL as a type I interferon antagonist rather than an entry receptor, the exact entry mechanism remains unresolved. Here we report that cell surface sialic acid plays an important role in ZIKV infection. Removal of cell surface sialic acid by neuraminidase significantly abolished ZIKV infection in Vero cells and human induced-pluripotent stem cells-derived neural progenitor cells. Furthermore, knockout of the sialic acid biosynthesis gene encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase resulted in significantly less ZIKV infection of both African and Asian lineages. Huh7 cells deficient in \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid through knockout of ST3 \u03b2galactoside-\u03b12,3-sialyltransferase 4 had significantly reduced ZIKV infection. Removal of membrane-bound, uninternalized virus with pronase treatment revealed the role of sialic acid in ZIKV internalization but not attachment. Sialyllactose inhibition studies showed that there is no direct interaction between sialic acid and ZIKV, implying that sialic acid could be mediating ZIKV-receptor complex internalization. Identification of \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid as an important host factor for ZIKV internalization provides new insight into ZIKV infection and pathogenesis.",

ZIKV was first isolated from a febrile sentinel rhesus macaque in 1947 and from an Aedes africanus mosquito in 1948 in Zika Forest, Uganda [2] . ZIKV infection has been associated with mild symptoms such as fever, rash, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis. Sporadic cases of ZIKV infections were reported over the next half century before ZIKV emerged in major outbreaks in Yap Island in 2007 [3] , French Polynesia in 2013 [4] , and Brazil in 2015 [5] . These ZIKV outbreaks have been associated with Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and congenital microcephaly [6, 7] .",

The TAM receptor AXL, through soluble intermediates growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6) was recently shown to support ZIKV infection of human foreskin fibroblast [9] , glial cells [10] , neural stem cells [11, 12] , and foetal endothelial cells [13] . However, recent findings also suggest that AXL is not required in ZIKV infection in mouse models [14] [15] [16] , neural progenitor cells, and cerebral organoids [17] .

However, our previous findings suggested that heparan sulfate has no role in ZIKV infection [21] . Sialic acids are typically found on terminating branches of N-glycans, O-glycans and glycosphingolipids (gangliosides).

Sialic acid is known to be an attachment or entry receptor for multiple viruses of significant public health concern, including human and avian influenza viruses [23, 24] , paramyxoviruses [25] , picornaviruses [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , and coronaviruses [31, 32] .

To test the role of sialic acid in ZIKV infection, we used neuraminidase to remove cell surface sialic acid prior to ZIKV infection. We first validated the efficacies of the neuraminidases in removing sialic acid using FITC-conjugated WGA lectin staining. Neuraminidase from C. perfringens (preferentially removing \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid) was shown to be more efficient than neuraminidase from A. ureafaciens (preferentially removing \u03b12,6linked sialic acid) in Vero cells (Figure 1(a) ).",

Specifically, ZIKV, MR766 was reported to efficiently infect hNPCs derived from induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) [36] . Therefore, we next sought to examine whether sialic acid is also involved in ZIKV infection in human iPSC-derived NPCs. Human induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), reprogrammed from human dermal fibroblasts were used for neural progenitor cell induction. As shown in Figure 3 (a), neural progenitor cells treated with 1 U/ml of C. perfringens neuraminidase displayed less sialic acid on the cell surface. When treated at the final concentration of 1U/ml, there was a significant decrease in ZIKV infection for multiple strains as determined by real-time PCR (Figure 3(b) ). Plaque assays (Figure 3 (c)) showed decreasing viral titres of 2.6 log PFU/ml, 1.4 log PFU/ml and 1.7 log PFU/ml for ZIKV MR766, Paraiba and 16-922, respectively. As shown in Figure 3 (c), ZIKV MR766 replicates more efficiently in neural progenitor cells as compared to other ZIKV strains. As an additional control, we demonstrate that neural progenitor cells are permissive to H1N1 A/NWS/33 and PRV3M infection. Neuraminidase treatment significantly inhibits A/NWS/33 but failed to reduce PRV3M infection (Figure 3(d) ).",

To characterize the mechanistic role of sialic acid during ZIKV infection, neuraminidase-treated Vero or Vero\u0394GNE cells were incubated with ZIKV PF13 either at 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C to promote virus attachment and internalization, respectively. For virus internalization, ZIKV-infected cells were subjected to pronase treatment to remove plasma membrane-bound but un-internalized viral particles after incubation at 37\u00b0C (Figure 6(a,b,c) ). This experiment was performed in order to differentiate the role of sialic acid in attachment versus internalization. As shown in Figure 6(d) , there was no difference in ZIKV particles that attached to the neuraminidasetreated and untreated cells at 4\u00b0C. As a control, it was evident that neuraminidase-treated cells significantly reduced influenza H1N1 A/NWS/33 attachment (Figure 6(d) ). By using pronase to remove un-internalized virus particles, we observed a significant reduction (3-fold) of the viral RNA in the neuraminidase-treated Vero cells (Figure 6(e) ). This finding indicates that ZIKV internalization is, at least in part, dependent on sialic acid.",

Similarly, sialic acid is previously reported to enhance adeno-associated virus 2.5 T internalization through sialic acid-dependent endocytosis [46] . The failure of blocking ZIKV infection by pre-incubation of ZIKV with 3 \u2032 or 6 \u2032 sialyllactose and fetuin further suggests that there was no direct interaction between sialic acid and ZIKV virus particles during virus attachment. The mechanism underlying sialic acid-dependent internalization remains unclear. Sialic acids are not able to transmit signals across the plasma membrane and therefore, require additional signalling receptors to trigger internalization or endocytosis [47] . The binding of influenza A virus to sialic acid on the cells results in clustering of lipid rafts and activation of epidermal growth factor receptor and other receptor tyrosine kinases, which subsequently recruit PI3K to trigger the endocytosis pathway [47] .",

The exact mechanism underlying sialic acid-mediated internalization requires further investigation. To date, multiple receptors have been reported for flaviviruses [51] . It is, therefore, possible that sialic acid is not the only internalization factor used by ZIKV. Our findings may also explain why the GNE gene was not identified in the CRISPR-cas9 library screen reported by Savidis et al. [52] . GNE knockout in mice causes early embryonic lethality [53] , which limits the in vivo investigation of the role of sialic acid in ZIKV infection in mice.",
