            "text": "Natural killer (NK) cells serve essential functions in immunity and reproduction. Diversifying these functions within individuals and populations are rapidly-evolving interactions between highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands and variable NK cell receptors. Specific to simian primates is the family of Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR), which recognize MHC class I and associate with a range of human diseases. Because KIR have considerable species-specificity and are lacking from common animal models, we performed extensive comparison of the systems of KIR and MHC class I interaction in humans and chimpanzees. Although of similar complexity, they differ in genomic organization, gene content, and diversification mechanisms, mainly because of human-specific specialization in the KIR that recognizes the C1 and C2 epitopes of MHC-B and -C. Humans uniquely focused KIR recognition on MHC-C, while losing C1-bearing MHC-B. Reversing this trend, C1-bearing HLA-B46 was recently driven to unprecedented high frequency in Southeast Asia. Chimpanzees have a variety of ancient, avid, and predominantly inhibitory receptors, whereas human receptors are fewer, recently evolved, and combine avid inhibitory receptors with attenuated activating receptors. These differences accompany human-specific evolution of the A and B haplotypes that are under balancing selection and differentially function in defense and reproduction. Our study shows how the qualitative differences that distinguish the human and chimpanzee systems of KIR and MHC class I predominantly derive from adaptations on the human line in response to selective pressures placed on human NK cells by the competing needs of defense and reproduction.",

NK cells provide first-line, innate immune defense against infection [1] and cancer [2] , and through interaction with dendritic cells [3] help initiate the second-line, adaptive immune response [4] . During embryo implantation and placentation, NK cells control the trophoblastmediated widening of maternal blood vessels necessary to nourish the fetus throughout pregnancy [5] . Controlling both NK cell development and effector function is a variety of interactions between NK cell receptors and their ligands [6] , the class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC): called the HLA complex in humans. Some interactions are conserved, such as that between human HLA-E and the CD94:NKG2A receptor [7] , whereas others are highly variable, notably those between HLA-A, B, C and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) [8] . Pointing to the clinical importance of these interactions, various combinations of HLA and KIR factors associate with the outcome of viral infection, susceptibility to autoimmune disease, relapse of leukemia following therapeutic transplantation, and reproductive success [9] [10] [11] .",

This diverse family of NK cell receptor genes is restricted to simian primates, having expanded from a single copy KIR3DL gene during the last ,40-58 million years [13] . In rodents, where KIR genes are expressed in the brain, but not by NK cells [14] , the Ly49 gene family independently evolved as a variable family of NK cell receptors for MHC class I [15] . Prosimians have a single, non-functional KIR3DL gene, but a diversified system of CD94 and NKG2 genes [13] . Also having a single KIR3DL gene, cattle expanded and diversified the distantly related KIR3DX gene [16] , which in humans is non-functional. This strong element of species-specific evolution likely reflects the variety and inconstancy of selection imposed on NK cells by immune defense and reproduction; the former being essential for individuals to survive, the latter being necessary for the survival of populations and species [17] . In this context of rapidly evolving NK cell receptors, the study of chimpanzees, our closest living relatives, becomes an imperative, not only for clinical studies in which the chimpanzee is the preferred animal model, for example hepatitis C virus infection [18] , but also for defining those aspects of NK cell function that are unique to the human species [19] .",

Although the chimpanzee has well-defined orthologs of all the human HLA class I genes [22] , exploratory studies of chimpanzee KIR cDNA and one KIR haplotype [23, 24] , raised intriguing possibilities: first that only a small minority of KIR genes is shared by humans and chimpanzees; and second, that the organization of KIR genes into haplotypes is qualitatively different in the two species.

These two genes distinguish the human group A and B KIR haplotypes, a difference correlating with a wide range of clinical effects [10] . KIR2DL5 is the only inhibitory KIR restricted to B haplotypes, 2DS4 the only activating KIR of A haplotypes (Figure 2A and 2B) . Whereas human 2DS4 is restricted to the telomeric region and present on ,50% of KIR haplotypes, chimpanzee 2DS4 is restricted to the centromeric region ( Figure 2B ) and present on only 8% of haplotypes ( Figure 1C ). Also varying between species are the location of 2DL5 and its linkage disequilibrium (LD). Restricted to the centromeric region, chimpanzee 2DL5 has absolute LD with inhibitory KIR2DL8, whereas human 2DL5 has absolute LD with activating KIR2DS3/S5 and is alternatively found in the centromeric region, the telomeric region, or both (Figure 2A and 2B). Thus human-specific evolution of the KIR locus involved 'colonization' of the telomeric region of the KIR locus, with assembly of A and B haplotype gene-content motifs around the 2DS4 and 2DL5 genes, respectively. Consequently, human KIR haplotypes all have 2DS4 and/or 2DL5, while almost half the chimpanzee haplotypes (44%; arithmetic sum of the individual frequencies of haplotypes 1, 6, 9 and 15) lack both of them.",

Because Pairs 1, 3, and 5 have absolute or very high LD ( Figure 1C ), gene-content diversity of chimpanzee KIR haplotypes derives from asymmetric recombination between seven units, these three high LD pairs and the individual genes of Pairs 2 and 4. In humans, a similar number of units is divided between the centromeric and telomeric regions and separated by a unique and repetitive sequence that facilitates symmetric recombination [26] (Figure 2A ).

Contrasting with this battery of potent MHC-C receptors is the set of six variable human lineage III KIR without chimpanzee equivalents. These comprise high-avidity inhibitory receptors for C1 (2DL2/3) and C2 (2DL1), a C2 receptor with lower avidity (2DS1) and three KIR with no detectable binding to HLA class I (2DS2, 2DS3, and 2DS5) [29] .

Essential to NK cell development, diversification and function are variable families of surface receptors that recognize equally variable determinants of polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, better known as the tissue types matched in clinical organ transplantation. These ligand-receptor interactions evolve rapidly, exhibiting much species specificity and convergent evolution. Consequently, mice represent a poor model, because their receptors are so disparate from the independently evolved human counterparts that are restricted to simian primates. To identify unique and shared aspects of human NK cell biology, we have defined the genomics, population biology, and immunology of variable chimpanzee NK cell receptors and ligands to a level permitting accurate, informed comparison with the well-characterized human system. In both receptors and ligands there are dramatic, qualitative differences between humans and chimpanzees. We show these differences arose during human evolution from the last common human-chimpanzee ancestor, while the chimpanzee system remained relatively stable. That two so closely related species exhibit major differences in NK cell receptors and ligands testifies to the strong and varying selection imposed by the different demands and competing needs of defense and reproduction. extracellular domains but different cytoplasmic tails ( Figure 3A ). In reciprocal manner, the same cytoplasmic tail can be associated with different extracellular domains. Thus, the T3 tail is alternatively associated with the extracellular domains of 3DL3, 2DL9 and 2DL6, as is the T7 tail with the 2DL8, 3DL5 and 2DL7 extracellular domains ( Figure 3A and 3B). These chimeric forms are the products of intergenic recombination that brought together the extracellular domains of one KIR with the signaling domain of another. The effect of this mechanism is to generate receptors with altered inhibitory signaling function ( Figure 3C and 3D). For example, of the three tails associated with 3DL3, T1 has no immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), T2 has Chimpanzee KIR having no human strict ortholog are colored green.

'Genes' gives the number of KIR per haplotype ('All'), and the number of activating receptor genes ('Act'). Chimpanzee KIR haplotype diversity stems from recombination involving five pairs of variable KIR: for each pair the top percentage indicates the observed 'pairing frequency' (genes both present or both absent) and the bottom percentage is the expected 'pairing frequency' under random distribution. *, significant linkage disequilibrium (p,0.001).

The extent this occurred among the three haplotypes sequenced, points to the prevalence of the phenomenon and its significant contribution to the functional diversity of inhibitory chimpanzee KIR. Consistent with this thesis, sequence variability in the chimpanzee lineage III inhibitory KIR concentrates in the signaling domain ( Figure 3E ). However, that is not the case for human lineage III KIR, for which tail-swapping has principally served to convert inhibitory to activating receptors [31] , and allotypic variability more evenly distributes between ligand-binding and signaling domains ( Figure 3F ). Consequently, chimpanzee 3DL3 and inhibitory lineage III KIR display more allelic variability than their human counterparts ( Figure 3E and 3F). Particularly striking is 3DL3, for which four chimpanzee allotypes have 11 variable positions, compared to 12 in 31 human allotypes [32] .",

In contrast, the regions containing the lineage III KIR genes have diverged to form four sublineages ( Figure 4A ). Of these, two are chimpanzee-specific, one is human-specific and one is shared. The two chimpanzeespecific sublineages correspond precisely to C1-and C2-specific KIR. Functionally, these sublineages were lost during human evolution (a non-functional remnant is KIR3DP1), being replaced by the human-specific sublineage that includes both C1-and C2specific receptors. The shared sublineage includes additional chimpanzee inhibitory C2 receptors and 2DS4. The differences in the MHC-C system of receptors in human and chimpanzee are seen to be mainly the result of human-specific evolution. These differences alter basic functional characteristics such as the number and avidity of receptors ( Figure 4B ), suggesting that natural selection played distinctive roles in the evolution of human and chimpanzee lineage III KIR.",

Eight point mutations independently introduced V76 and the C1 epitope into a range of HLA-B allotypes having N80. In contrast, V76 is never present in HLA-B allotypes having either isoleucine or threonine 80 (33% of the total), a distribution unlikely to occur by chance (a = 0.05). Likewise all 11 chimpanzee MHC-B allotypes with V76 have N80 ( Figure 6A ). Thus selection has favored MHC-B variants having C1 (V76-N80) and eliminated variants having V76-I80 or V76-T80. A possible mechanism for the latter effect is that HLA-B allotypes having I80 and T80 carry the Bw4 epitope recognized by KIR3DL1 [42, 43] , and that V76 perturbs this interaction while failing to introduce either C1 or C2.",

From HLA and KIR frequencies, we determined the average number per individual of distinct interactions (ANDI) between KIR2DL receptors and HLA ligands. In all population groups ANDI ranged from 1.7-2.4, with a median of 2.0 ( Figure 7B and Figure S5 ). Because of their low C2 and KIR2DL2 frequencies, Southeast Asians have the lowest ANDI worldwide, despite the significant contribution of B*46 (shown in red in Figure 7B and in Figure S5 ). When B*46 is excluded from the analysis, Southeast Asian ANDI values fall out of the normal range. Thus the rise of B*46 in these populations has compensated for their reduced frequency of functional ligandreceptor pairs ( Figure 7C , Figure S5 , and Figure S6 ).",

Of eighteen locus-specific sites detected, sixteen are in the a1 domain, nine of them (including three of the four with strongest support) within residues 66-76 of the a1 helix ( Figure 7D ) [49] , the segment recombined in forming B*46 [50] . Type I functional divergence was greater in MHC-C (nine positions, including the four with the strongest confidence) than MHC-B (five positions). The nine Cspecific positions are fixed in MHC-C but variable in MHC-B and Old World monkey MHC-B/C. Thus during evolution of MHC-C to become the major ligand for lineage III KIR, functionally favorable residues were fixed at positions throughout the a1 helix ( Figure 7D ).

In contrast, chimpanzee KIR haplotypes are variations on a theme emphasizing multiple and variable high-avidity C1 and C2 receptors. The character of the A haplotypes is closer to that of the chimpanzee KIR haplotypes: they have genes encoding high-avidity inhibitory C1, C2 and Bw4 receptors and lack their attenuated activating counterparts. In contrast, B haplotypes carry genes for the attenuated activating receptors and distinctive variants of the inhibitory receptors. Disease associations suggest a basis for the balancing selection, in that A haplotypes favor successful antiviral defense, whereas maternal B haplotypes favor successful reproduction [10] . Consistent with the evolutionary plasticity of viruses and other pathogens, the A haplotype KIR genes are more polymorphic than their B haplotype counterparts [52] , as is also seen for chimpanzee KIR haplotypes. In this context, humanspecific evolution of group B KIR haplotypes can be seen as an adaptation to life-threatening complications of pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, which have not affected the chimpanzee. For example, these hypertensive conditions could have arisen from imbalance between the supply and increased demands on maternal blood caused by selection to increase the size of the neonatal human brain, to double that of the chimpanzee [53] .",

Similarly, because the cytoplasmic tail of KIR2DL3*007 and the D2 domain of KIR2DL1*004 showed evidence of gene conversion, additional analyses were performed where these sequences were discarded: datasets CYT-R2 and D2-R, respectively. 2DL, two times the difference in likelihood between the models allowing for positive selection (M2a and M8) and the models that do not (null models: M1a, M7 and M8a). The only one rare HLA-B allotype, B*73, has retained C1 and the capacity to bind KIR2DL2/3 [46] . Thus the trend for much of human evolution has been for HLA-C to become the exclusive source of ligands for lineage III KIR, potentially reducing competition between NK-cell KIR and T-cell receptors, which have overlapping binding sites on HLA class I [33, 34] . In this significance level (a) is indicated when the null models were significantly rejected. NS, not significant. *: a,0.01. When significant evidence of positive diversifying selection was obtained, the residues detected with model M8 were listed (underlined residues: p.0.95; boldened residues: p.0.99; **: p,0.90). (B) Residues observed at the positively selected positions in the D1, D2 and CYT domains. Amino acids unique to one species are highlighted in yellow. In the summary section, amino acids only found on activating KIR are highlighted in red while those only found on inhibitory KIR are highlighted in green. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1001192.g005 scenario, HLA-C became more specialized in controlling NK cell functions leaving HLA-A and -B to dominate T cell responses. A remarkable reversal of this trend occurred in Southeast Asia during the last ,55-65,000 years [45] , where HLA-B*46, a recombinant allele that carries C1 and functions well as a ligand for KIR2DL2/3 [46] , underwent a selective sweep to become the most frequent HLA-B allele. Resolution of human hepatitis C virus infection was associated with homozygosity for KIR2DL3 and its C1 ligand [55] . The potential benefit of HLA-B*46 is that it allows individuals to express three or four C1-bearing HLA-B and C allotypes. Thus the selective sweep of B*46 could have been driven by epidemic infection caused by a pathogen like the hepatitis C virus that is preferentially resisted by individuals having enhanced representation of C1 and its cognate inhibitory KIR. Interestingly, several reports describe B*46 as a risk factor for various current infectious diseases ( Figure S8 ), illustrating the dynamic nature of these polymorphic genetic factors and the variable pressures placed on them by functions in both immune defense and reproduction.",

For human and chimpanzee, we also investigated KIR haplotype structures using KIR2DL5 as a reference. In these analyses, gene linkage to 2DL5 +/2 was estimated for each KIR as a ratio: for example KIR3DS1 is seven times more common on 2DL5A + haplotypes than on 2DL5A 2 haplotypes. All ratios were normalized to account for the difference in frequency between 2DL5 + and 2DL5 2 haplotypes. In the human locus, KIR2DS3/5 can occupy two different genomic locations [64, 65] and linkage between 2DL5 (A or B) and 2DS3/5 was assumed to be absolute, as supported by currently available haplotype sequences. Gene linkage to 2DL5 in human was assessed from Caucasian individuals [66] .",

Amongst the components of the KIR2DL/ HLA-C interactions HLA-C2 and KIR2DL2 display the widest range of phenotypic frequencies in populations (Figure 7C). HLA-C2 and KIR2DL2 frequencies also correlate with the average number of distinct KIR2DL/HLA-C interactions (A) and their combined frequency distribution (B) mimics that obtained with all KIR2DL-HLA-C interactions (Figure S5) indicating they represent the main source of HLA-C/KIR2DL variability in human populations. KIR2DL2 and HLA-C2 frequencies display a positive correlation (C-D) that amplifies the difference between populations. Indeed, five of the seven African populations are, for example, in the high range of the KIR2DL2-HLA-C2 frequencies (B) while six to eight of the ten Southeast Asian populations are in the low range of this distribution (B-D) and have KIR2DL3/ HLA-C1 as their main KIR2DL-HLA-C interaction. The correlation between KIR2DL2 and HLA-C2 frequencies is the strongest amongst all KIR2DL-HLA-C1/C2 combinations (E), although the correlation between KIR2DS2 and HLA-C2 is almost equally as strong due to the strong linkage disequilibrium between KIR2DL2 and KIR2DS2.

(A) D0 domain (or pseudoexon 3). (B) D1 domain. (C) D2 domain. (D) Stem, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (S/TM/CYT). (E) Full-length coding sequences (including the pseudoexon 3). White brackets indicate non-recombinant alleles. Allelic relationships were established based on the overall distance in the full-length sequence analysis and consistency in the domain-by-domain analysis (panels A-D).

Amino acid variation is listed for 12 of the 13 chimpanzee KIR for which such data are available (A-L). For each KIR, the positions of variability are displayed.The origin of each sequence is given in parenthesis: Hxx and Tx (KIR haplotypes), cDNA (first cDNA study [23]), cDNA2 (cDNA sequences characterized in the present study), and cDNA3 (unpublished sequences deposited in Genbank with the following accession numbers: AM279149, AM292657-63, AM396937, and AM400232-36). Position, amino acid residue in the mature protein. L, leader peptide. D0-D2, Ig-like domains. S, stem. TM, transmembrane domain. CYT, cytoplasmic tail. FS, frameshift. *, Stop codon.
