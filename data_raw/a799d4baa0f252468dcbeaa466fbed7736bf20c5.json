Therapeutic antibodies are key tools for preventing and treating MERS-CoV infection, but to date no such agents have been approved for treatment of this virus. Nanobodies (Nbs) are camelid heavy chain variable domains with properties distinct from those of conventional antibodies and antibody fragments. We generated two oligomeric Nbs by linking two or three monomeric Nbs (Mono-Nbs) targeting the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD), and compared their RBD-binding affinity, RBD-receptor binding inhibition, stability, and neutralizing and cross-neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV. Relative to Mono-Nb, dimeric Nb (Di-Nb) and trimeric Nb (Tri-Nb) had significantly greater ability to bind MERS-CoV RBD proteins with or without mutations in the RBD, thereby potently blocking RBD-MERS-CoV receptor binding. The engineered oligomeric Nbs were very stable under extreme conditions, including low or high pH, protease (pepsin), chaotropic denaturant (urea), and high temperature. Importantly, Di-Nb and Tri-Nb exerted significantly elevated broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against at least 19 human and camel MERS-CoV strains isolated in different countries and years. Overall, the engineered Nbs could be developed into effective therapeutic agents for prevention and treatment of MERS-CoV infection.",

It is composed of S1 and S2 subunits: the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit mediates MERS-CoV binding to its cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and the S2 subunit subsequently mediates viral and cell membrane fusion, leading to viral entry into target cells [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . The RBD of MERS-CoV S protein contains a critical neutralizing domain fragment capable of inducing strong neutralizing antibodies, and it is therefore considered to be an important therapeutic and vaccine target [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

These antibodies have distinctive properties, including high binding affinity, strong specificity for target antigens, good tissue penetration, and intrinsic stability under harsh conditions, such as extreme pH values, proteases, chemicals, and high temperature. Accordingly, they represent promising therapeutic tools for the treatment of human diseases [35] [36] [37] . Moreover, because Nbs do not require paired light and heavy chain domains to maintain antigen-binding activity, they can be easily modified by protein engineering techniques without loss of functionality [38] . Several monomeric Nbs can be readily fused to form multivalent or multispecific constructs, thereby improving their binding affinity and functionality. For example, monomeric proteins have been engineered into dimeric or trimeric proteins [38, 39] . Also, multidomain Nbs have been generated by linking different Nbs targeting influenza virus hemagglutinin protein; the resultant agents have greater breadth, avidity, potency, and cross-neutralizing activity against divergent influenza viruses than the parent molecules [40] , demonstrating the feasibility of engineering Nbs targeting multiple epitopes to increase their activity. It is therefore worthwhile to attempt to generate multidomain Nbs with improved activity against other emerging and re-emerging infectious viruses.",

In this study, we constructed two oligomeric Nbs, including dimeric Nb (Di-Nb) and trimeric Nb (Tri-Nb), and compared them to the Mono-Nb in terms of their ability to bind RBD proteins, inhibit RBD-DPP4 receptor binding, and cross-neutralize MERS-CoV infection. In addition, to demonstrate the advantages of the oligomeric Nbs relative to conventional antibodies, we evaluated the stability of these Nbs under the extreme conditions mentioned above. Overall, our data show that the engineered oligomeric Nbs have been significantly improved from the standpoint of binding affinity to the RBD, inhibition of the RBD-DPP4 binding, and cross-neutralizing activity against divergent strains of MERS-CoV. They also maintained greater pH, protease, chemical, and thermal stability than their mAb counterparts.",

Previously, using PCR to amplify the MERS-CoV RBD-specific VHH gene, we constructed a Mono-Nb targeting the MERS-CoV RBD. We linked this construct to a C-terminal His 6 tag for easy purification [41] , resulting in a total molecular weight of about 16 kDa. We generated the Di-Nb and Tri-Nb specific for MERS-CoV RBD by linearly linking two and three Mono-Nbs, respectively, with a flexible GGGGS linker between each Mono-Nb and a C-terminal His 6 tag ( Figure 1A , right). As with Mono-Nb, Di-Nb and Tri-Nb were expressed in culture supernatants of yeast expression cells at high yield and purity, and formed dimers and trimers with molecular weights of about 32 and 48 kDa, respectively ( Figure 1B, left) . These MERS-CoV RBD-targeting Nbs reacted strongly with an anti-llama antibody ( Figure 1B, right) . These data suggest that, like Mono-Nb, MERS-CoV RBD-specific Di-Nb and Tri-Nb maintained their native conformations and strong antigenicity. and SARS-CoV RBD-specific mAb (SARS mAb) were used as controls. Anti-llama antibody was used for Western blot analysis.",

These data indicate that, relative to traditional mAbs targeting MERS-CoV RBD, MERS-CoV RBD-specific Nbs maintain greater stability under all extreme conditions tested. Note: Nbs were tested for stability under extreme conditions, including pH, protease (pepsin), chaotropic agent (urea), and temperature. Nbs were treated at different pH values (pH 5.0, 7.0, and 8.0) for 24 h at room temperature, the indicated concentrations of pepsin for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C or urea for 24 h at 25 \u2022 C, and different temperatures (4 \u2022 C, 37 \u2022 C, and 60 \u2022 C) for 24 h, followed by measurement of their neutralizing activity against pseudotyped MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain) infection. Neutralizing activity of Nbs is expressed as mean 50% neutralization dose (ND 50 ) (n = 2). Experiments were repeated twice, yielding similar results. MERS mAb and SARS mAb were used as controls. Significant differences between treatment and no-treatment groups under each condition were compared by mean ND 50 \u00b1 s.e.m. *, **, and *** indicate the level of significance of the differences between MERS mAb, with or without treatment under the indicated conditions.

Hence, it is critical that MERS-CoV RBD-specific Nbs maintain potent cross-neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV of divergent strains. In addition to pseudotyped MERS-CoV expressing the S protein of the prototypic MERS-CoV strain (EMC2012), we constructed 18 additional pseudotyped MERS-CoVs containing RBD mutations from MERS-CoVs isolated from seven countries (Saudi Arabia, UK, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, South Korea, and UAE), different time periods (2012-2016), and two hosts (human and camel) ( Table 2 ). In addition, we tested the neutralizing activity of MERS-CoV RBD-specific Nbs. As shown in Table 2 , relative to Mono-Nb, Di-Nb, and especially Tri-Nb, had significantly elevated neutralizing activity against all these 18 viruses tested. ND 50 ranged from 0.81 to 27.1 nM for Mono-Nb, from 0.07 to 3.29 nM for Di-Nb, and from 0.01 to 0.61 nM for Tri-Nb. The neutralizing activity of MERS mAb was much lower than that of Di-Nb and Tri-Nb against all MERS-CoV strains tested, and SARS mAb had no neutralizing activity against these viruses. These data indicate that MERS-CoV RBD-specific oligomeric Nbs exhibited higher levels of cross-neutralization activity against divergent MERS-CoV strains. RBD mutations indicate mutant residues in the RBD of S protein of the indicated MERS-CoV isolates. A MERS-CoV neutralization assay was performed to test cross-neutralizing activity of MERS-CoV RBD-specific Nbs against pseudotyped MERS-CoV expressing the S protein of these strains. Neutralizing activity of Nbs is expressed as mean ND 50 (n = 2). Experiments were repeated twice, yielding similar results. MERS mAb and SARS mAb were used as controls.

As expected, engineering of the RBD-specific Mono-Nb had no impact on antibody expression. As with Mono-Nb, Di-Nb and Tri-Nb could be expressed at high levels in a yeast cell expression system and purified with high purity, retaining their conformation and antigenicity. In addition, the larger size of the oligomeric Nbs did not affect their stability. Like Mono-Nb, the oligomerized Di-Nb and Tri-Nb maintained stability under all extreme conditions tested, including acidic or alkaline pH, protease (pepsin), chaotropic denaturant (urea), and high temperature. By contrast, the protease, chemical, and thermal stability of MERS mAb significantly decreased after these treatments. Thus, unlike the mAb control, the engineered MERS-CoV RBD-specific Nbs developed in this study maintained the key characteristics of Nbs, including intrinsic stability, high expression, and intact conformation. Because these Nbs are stable under above extreme conditions, they can be transported and stored without the need for refrigeration or special care, a marked advantage relative to traditional antibodies. This will significantly simplify the transportation and therapeutic processes of antibodies, particularly in Middle Eastern countries that generally have inadequate transport services and high temperatures during summer.",

First, they exhibited significantly greater ability than the Mono-Nb to bind MERS-CoV RBD proteins with or without RBD mutations from divergent MERS-CoV strains isolated from different years and hosts, facilitating the Nb-RBD interaction and increasing the time that the Nbs are bound to MERS-CoV. We have previously demonstrated that the Mono-Nb recognizes an epitope at residue around D539 of MERS-CoV RBD [41] . Second, relative to Mono-Nb, the engineered oligomeric Nbs strongly blocked RBD binding to MERS-CoV receptor DPP4, which is involved in a key step of viral entry and infection [14, 56] , thereby more effectively blocking entry of MERS-CoV into its target cells. Third, Di-Nb and Tri-Nb had significantly greater capacities to neutralize homologous MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain), as well as potently cross-neutralize dozens of heterologous MERS-CoV strains harboring one or two mutations in their RBDs, all of which were isolated from different countries, hosts (human and camel), and time periods. Overall, the engineered oligomeric Nbs have great potential to neutralize new MERS-CoV strains with mutations in the RBD, and could therefore play a key role in preventing camel-to-human and human-to-human transmissions of MERS-CoV.",

Therefore, these small Nbs may be rapidly eliminated from the bloodstream by renal clearance, thus they might have shorter half-lives than mAbs [41, 55] . One approach of increasing the in vivo half-life of Nbs is to fuse them with albumin-binding domain (ABD) or human Fc (hFc) [55, 57, 58] . We have also successfully fused monomeric Nb with a C-terminal hFc, increasing its half-life as well as its therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy against MERS-CoV infection [41] . In future studies, we plan to extend the half-lives of the constructed oligomeric Nbs by fusing them with ABD or hFc, and then compare their in vivo efficacy with that of Mono-Nb with or without hFc against MERS-CoV.",
