Overexpression of RNF166 rather than its homologous proteins RNF114, RNF125, and RNF138, enhanced Sendai virus (SeV)-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. Knockdown of endogenous RNF166, but not other RNFs, inhibited the IFN-\u03b2 production induced by SeV and encephalomyocarditis virus. RNF166 interacted with TRAF3 and TRAF6. SeV-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6 was suppressed when endogenous RNF166 rather than RNF114/138 was knocked down. These findings suggest that RNF166 positively regulates RNA virus-triggered IFN-\u03b2 production by enhancing the ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6.",

After binding viral RNA, RIG-I and MDA5 undergo conformational changes as well as modifications with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by TRIM25 and REUL (also known as Riplet or RNF135) 5-8 . Ubiquitinated RIG-I and MDA5 interact with VISA (also named MAVS, Cardif or IPS-1) and this results in aggregation of the latter 9-12 . VISA polymers then recruit TRAFs such as TRAF3 and TRAF6 to promote the ubiquitination reaction which is critical for recruiting IKK and TBK1 to the VISA signaling complex 13 .

RNF166 is closely related to RNF125, which has been reported to negatively regulate RIG-Imediated anti-RNA virus signaling by conjugating ubiquitin chains to RIG-I and leading to the degradation of RIG-I by the proteasome 23 . RNF125 and its homologous proteins RNF114, RNF138, and RNF166 form a subfamily of small C3HC4 RING ubiquitin ligases 28 , so we investigated whether RNF114/138/166 also play a role in RNA virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. We transfected plasmids that encoded RNF114, RNF125, RNF138, and RNF166 into HEK293T cells to perform reporter assays. We found that overexpression of RNF166 but not it's homologous RNF114, 125, and 138, potentiated Sendai virus (SeV)-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. However, RNF166 had no apparent effect on the overexpression of cGAS and the STING-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Fig. 1A) , suggesting that RNF166 specifically enhances RNA but not DNA virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. Overexpression of RNF166 can also enhance the transcription of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG15 and MX1 (Fig. 1B) .",

We found that knockdown of RNF166 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter, transcription of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA, and the secretion of IFN-\u03b2 triggered by SeV infection (Fig. 1D,E) . We also generated stable RNF114-, RNF125-, and RNF138-knockdown HEK293T cell pools to determine their functions (Fig. 1F ). Consistent with a previous report that RNF125 acts as a negative regulator of the RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway 23 , knockdown of RNF125 slightly enhanced the SeV-elicited IFN-\u03b2 production compared to the control cell pool, while knockdown of RNF114 clearly enhanced the SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production, and knockdown of RNF138 had no appreciable effect (Fig. 1G) .",

So we then determined whether TRAF3 or TRAF6 plays a critical role in SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production by using shRNA to stably knock down endogenous TRAF3 or TRAF6 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A) . We found that VISA-mediated activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter, SeV-induced transcription, and the secretion of IFN-\u03b2 were markedly reduced (Figs 2G and 3B), and SeV-induced phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3 was apparently inhibited when TRAF3 or TRAF6 expression was suppressed (Fig. 3C) . (C) HEK293T cell pools with stable knockdown RNF166 were generated by shRNA. Knockdown efficiency was determined by RT-PCR (left) and Q-PCR (right). (D) SeV-mediated activation of the IFN-\u03b2 reporter was inhibited when the endogenous RNF166 was stably knocked down. Transfection and luciferase assays were performed as in (A).

However, the functions of its homologous proteins RNF114, RNF125, and RNF138 in innate immune signaling pathways remain elusive. Here, we report that RNF166 rather than RNF114, RNF138, and RNF125 potentiates the RNA virus-induced production of IFN-\u03b2 . Several lines of evidence support this finding. First, overexpressed RNF166 potentiated the SeV-and VISA-mediated induction of IFN-\u03b2 . Second, knockdown of endogenous RNF166 by shRNA reduced the RNA virus-and dsRNA analog-induced production of IFN-\u03b2 . Third, RNF166 interacted with endogenous TRAF3 and TRAF6, and these interactions were enhanced upon viral infection. Furthermore, we found that the potentiation of the antiviral effect of RNF166 was mediated by enhancing the virus-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6. Notably, endogenous RNF114 and RNF138 had no apparent effect on the virus-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6, and this finding may explain why RNF114 and RNF138 do not enhance SeV-induced antiviral activity while RNF166 did.",

Although a recent study has shown that TRAF3 is dispensable for the RNA virus-induced activation of TBK1 and IRF3 13 , our data suggest that TRAF3 is critical for the SeV-elicited production of IFN-\u03b2 in HEK293T cells.

We noted that expression of a mutant with the RING domain deleted, RNF166-\u2206RING, markedly suppressed VISA-mediated activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and anti-NDV activity. These data indicate that, as a dominant-negative mutant, RNF166\u2206RING competes with endogenous RNF166 to bind with TRAF3 or TRAF6, so they cannot be efficiently ubiquitinated and blocks VISA signaling. However, STING has no apparent TRAF-binding motifs that are critical for recruiting TRAFs and can directly recruit IRF3 and TBK1 for activation via its carboxyl terminal region 40 ; this may explain why RNF166 does not potentiate the cGAS-and STING-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter.",

However, the analysis of cells with RNF114 knockdown yielded a heterogeneous set of results that may have been due to the presence of different populations within the polyclonal cell lines or a redundant role of RNF114 43 . Recently, another independent study revealed that RNF114 acts as a negative regulator of NF-\u03ba B-dependent transcription by stabilizing the A20 protein and I\u03ba B\u03b1 44 . Our data from overexpression and knockdown experiments indicated that RNF114 acts as a negative regulator of SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 signaling. A20 has been demonstrated to negatively regulate RIG-I-mediated signaling in several independent studies [45] [46] [47] , so it is possible that RNF114 depends on A20 to play negative regulatory roles.
