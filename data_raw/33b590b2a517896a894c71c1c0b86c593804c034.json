            "text": "Burkholderia pseudomallei, the etiologic agent of melioidosis, is a saprophytic bacterium readily isolated from wet soils of countries bordering the equator. Burkholderia mallei is a host-adapted clone of B. pseudomallei that does not persist outside of its equine reservoir and causes the zoonosis glanders, which is endemic in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. Infection by these organisms typically occurs via percutaneous inoculation or inhalation of aerosols, and the most common manifestation is severe pneumonia leading to fatal bacteremia. Glanders and melioidosis are difficult to diagnose and require prolonged antibiotic therapy with low success rates. There are no vaccines available to protect against either Burkholderia species, and there is concern regarding their use as biological warfare agents given that B. mallei has previously been utilized in this manner. Hence, experiments were performed to establish a mouse model of aerosol infection to study the organisms and develop countermeasures. Using a hand-held aerosolizer, BALB/c mice were inoculated intratracheally with strains B",

            "text": "Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative bacterium found in water and wet soils of endemic areas bordering the equator, particularly Southeast Asia and Northern Australia [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The organism infects most mammals and causes the disease melioidosis in humans [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Clinical manifestations vary greatly and may present as flu-like symptoms, benign pneumonitis, acute/chronic pneumonia, or fulminating septicemia. Infection generally occurs via inhalation of aerosols or through skin abrasions, and the risk of contracting the disease is proportional to the concentration of B. pseudomallei in soil and water. In endemic areas, heavy rainfalls result in a shift from percutaneous inoculation to inhalation as the primary mode of infection, which also leads to a more severe illness. Melioidosis commonly affects the lungs and is characterized by the spread and seeding of bacteria to the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes. The incubation period is not clearly defined, but may range from 2 days to many years. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, cirrhosis, thalassemia, and chronic lung disease. Most infected patients become bacteremic and the mortality rates remain high (19-51%) despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy. Burkholderia pseudomallei is refractory to most antibiotics and resistance mechanisms include efflux pumps and \u03b2-lactamases [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The recommended treatment for melioidosis entails the use of ceftazidime and meropenem (intensive phase) and TMP-SMX and co-amoxiclav (eradication phase) for several months [11] . Response to treatment is slow and eradication of B. pseudomallei is difficult to achieve, resulting in recrudescence [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Though considered exotic to the US and most European countries, B. pseudomallei is a leading cause of sepsis and bacteremic pneumonia in endemic areas, and melioidosis is recognized as an emerging infectious disease in many tropical regions of the world [12] [13] [14] .",

Burkholderia mallei causes the highly contagious zoonotic disease glanders, which primarily affects horses, mules, and donkeys. In humans, infection generally occurs by contact with infected animals via the cutaneous or respiratory route. Disease progression and pathology in humans and horses are similar, though the clinical presentation of any 2 cases in the same species, even if related by direct transmission, may vary. The clinical manifestations include febrile pneumonia with necrosis of the tracheobronchial tree, or pustular skin lesions and development of multiple abscesses (AKA farcy). Most patients become bacteremic and B. mallei disseminates to the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes where it rapidly causes necrosis. The course of disease may range from acute and rapidly fatal to very slow and protracted with alternating remissions and exacerbations. Even with antibiotic treatment, the mortality rate for human glanders is 50%. Like B. pseudomallei, B. mallei is resistant to most antibiotics [8, 9, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

Burkholderia pseudomallei was studied by the US and Russia as a potential bioweapon, but was never used in this capacity [25, 31, 32] . However, the ease of acquiring B. pseudomallei from the environment coupled with its resistance to antibiotics, severity of illness upon aerosol inoculation, difficulties in diagnosis, and persistence in the host make this possibility a serious concern. If the organism was cultured, concentrated, and delivered as an aerosol, significant casualties would ensue. For these reasons, the US Federal Select Agent Program classifies B. pseudomallei and B. mallei as Tier 1 agents, and the development of countermeasures is a priority. Protection against the pulmonary form of glanders and melioidosis is of particular interest as the lung is the most likely portal of entry for the organisms during a biologic attack.",

The method is quick, cost-effective, and relies on the mouse breathing in the agent, hence mimicking the natural route of aerosol infection for human disease. The availability of transgenic strains and the wealth of murine immunological tools provide a powerful platform to study and understand pathogenesis by the organisms and develop anti-infective approaches. However, unlike humans, mice are obligate nasal breathers and possess a greater surface area in their upper respiratory tract in addition to enhanced olfactory senses [41, 42] . Consequently, intranasal inoculation results in a significant proportion of the inoculum remaining in the nasal passages (and not reaching the lungs) [43, 44] , and leads to high rates of infection of the nasal associated lymphoid tissues and central nervous system (via olfactory tissues), which are not common in humans [37, 45, 46] . Moreover, intranasal inoculation entails inhalation of a liquid suspension, not smallaerosolized particles. Whole-body and nose-only aerosol exposure models have been utilized to study B. mallei and B. pseudomallei [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . Though these platforms deliver small aerosol particles, they too depend on the normal the mouse breathing in the agent through the nasal passageways and favor the aforementioned alternative portals of entry into the body.

Next, a fiber optic arm equipped with a light source (Fisher Scientific) was placed over the front of the throat of suspended animals in order to visualize the tracheal opening. The mouth of the mouse was opened and the tongue was moved to the side with forceps. A modified pediatric otoscope (Braintree Scientific, Inc) was then used to guide the blunt needle portion of a MicroSprayer\u00ae model I-1C (PennCentury\u2122) inside the tracheal opening and between the vocal cords.

The respiratory route of infection, and ensuing pulmonary disease, are also of particular concern with respect to the use of B. mallei and B. pseudomallei as agents of biological warfare. Hence, we developed a mouse model of aerosol inoculation to study the organisms. Our model entails the use of a MicroSprayer\u00ae (PennCentury\u2122) to deliver bacteria directly into the lungs. The device generates aerosols from the tip of a bent needle attached to a high-pressure stainless steel syringe that contains the agent. A modified pediatric otoscope is used to introduce the needle part of the MicroSprayer\u00ae into the trachea of anesthetized mice, and 50 \u00b5L of bacterial suspension is aerosolized into the airway. To our knowledge, this inoculation method has not been reported for B. pseudomallei or B. mallei.",

Because the aerosol is generated by pushing fluid through an atomizer (sapphire) located at the tip of the needle part of the device, we tested whether this procedure affects the viability of B. pseudomallei and/or B. mallei. Bacterial suspensions containing 10 5 organisms per mL were loaded into the high-pressure syringe component of the MicroSprayer\u00ae and a 50 \u00b5L dose was sprayed into 1 mL of PBS, serially diluted, and plated onto agar medium to calculate the number of viable bacteria. The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 1A and demonstrate that the use of the MicroSprayer\u00ae does not adversely impact viability of the agents. Experiments were also performed to verify that the number of viable organisms delivered into the lungs of mice is consistent with the number of bacteria in the inoculum. To accomplish this, plate-grown Burkholderia were suspended in PBS to concentrations of 1X10 6 , 1X10 5 and 1X10 4 cells per mL, serially-diluted, and plated onto agar medium to calculate the number of viable organisms in the inoculum prior to infection. The MicroSprayer\u00ae was then used to deliver the agents in the murine lungs. Thirty minutes postinoculation, mice were euthanized (n=3 mice per dose) and their lungs were collected, homogenized, diluted, and plated on agar medium to determine bacterial loads. The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 1B and indicate that the number of organisms deposited into the lungs is equivalent to the inoculum.",

            "text": "Next, we determined the median lethal dose of B. pseudomallei 1026b and B. mallei ATCC23344 according to the method of Reed and Muench [55] . Cohorts of mice were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of the organisms using the MicroSprayer\u00ae and monitored for clinical signs of illness and morbidity for a period of up to 30 days. Based on the data shown in Figure 2 , the calculated LD 50 for the agents are 5,100 \u00b1 820 (B. pseudomallei 1026b) and 818 \u00b1 173 CFU (B. mallei ATCC23344). The value for strain ATCC23344 is consistent with published reports utilizing alternative aerosol delivery methods. Using the intranasal route of inoculation, the LD 50 has been reported to be 820 CFU [39] . The use of whole body aerosol exposure chamber produced values of 1X10 3 -1.8X10 3 organisms [47, 50, 64] . The LD 50 of B. pseudomallei 1026b in our model is higher than that reported for the intranasal route of inoculation and whole body exposure chamber, which were calculated to be 1 X 10 3 and 10 CFU, respectively [39, 50] . Factors such as the age and weight of mice, and how bacteria were cultured prior to infection (i.e. broth versus plate-grown), may account for this difference. The intranasal route of inoculation and the use of the whole body exposure chamber entail mice breathing in the agent through the nasal passages and can cause infection of the nasal associated lymphoid tissues and central nervous system (in addition to pulmonary disease), which could have contributed to the lower LD 50 in these models. Intratracheal inoculation with the MicroSprayer\u00ae circumvents the mouse nasal passageways and may have reduced the potentially confounding complications due to infection of the nasal associated lymphoid tissues and central nervous system, resulting in a higher LD 50 value for B. pseudomallei 1026b.",

Between 30-min and 48-hr post-infection, the number of viable B. mallei bacteria increased by 2 orders of magnitude, regardless of the dose used to inoculate animals ( Figure 4B ). Thereafter, bacterial numbers continued to increase, albeit at a slower rate, to reach a maximum of 10 8 (dose 1, 10 LD 50 ), 10 7 (dose 2, 1 LD 50 ), and Burkholderia pseudomallei was first cultured from the bloodstream 24-hr post-infection and the bacterial counts were proportional to the number of organisms delivered in the lungs with the MicroSprayer\u00ae (Figure 4E ). The presence of the agent in peripheral blood at 24-hr, and colonization of the spleen with commensurate bacterial numbers at the same time point (Figure 4C ), suggest dissemination via the bloodstream. In mice infected with 1 and 10 LD 50 , the numbers of viable bacteria in blood continue to rise and reached 10 5 CFU/ml at the experimental end-points ( Figure 4E ). Though B. pseudomallei was cultured from the bloodstream of animals infected with 0.1 LD 50 during the first 48-hr post-challenge, the bacterial loads peaked at 10 1 CFU/ml at 48-hr and no bacteria were cultured from peripheral blood thereafter. Burkholderia mallei was not recovered from the blood at 24-hr post-infection, regardless of the dose used to inoculate animals ( Figure 4F ). The organism was first detected 48-hr post-infection in mice challenged with 10 LD 50 , and only at the 72 and 96-hr time points in animals inoculated with 1 and 0.1 LD 50 , respectively. The early, rapid replication of B. mallei in the lungs, the colonization of the spleen at 24 and 48-hr ( Figure 4D) , and the absence of bacteria in the bloodstream at those specific time points ( Figure 4F ), especially in mice infected with 1 and 0.1 LD 50 , suggest that B. mallei was phagocytized by alveolar macrophages and disseminated primarily via the lymphatic system. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of phagocytosed bacilli in macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavages (see below). More definitive experiments are needed to determine the precise mechanism(s) by which the bacteria disseminate from the site of infection to peripheral sites.",

No inflammatory infiltrates were observed in these animals. In contrast, BALF from mice infected with B. mallei ATCC23344 or B. pseudomallei 1026b were inflamed, consisting primarily of degenerate neutrophils (neutrophils that have lost ability to control water homeostasis and have swollen, eosinophilic nuclei) and activated macrophages with few, if any, respiratory epithelial cells. Degenerate neutrophils form in the presence of bacterial endotoxins like LPS, which are known to perforate their nuclear and cellular membranes. For this reason, the presence of degenerate neutrophils in cytologic preparations, even in the absence of bacteria, suggests bacterial infection [65, 66] . Neutrophils ingest bacteria by receptor-mediated phagocytosis, a process which internalizes bacteria within a vacuole (e.g. phagosome) with the ultimate goal of fusing that vacuole with a lysosome, where bacteria are digested [67, 68] . While the presence of extracellular bacteria and degenerate neutrophils suggests infection, the presence of intracellular bacteria, specifically bacteria contained within intracytoplasmic vacuoles, is indicative of bacterial infection [65, 66] . Several neutrophils and macrophages were found to contain phagocytosed bacteria, confirming active infection. The BALF from infected mice also contained cellular debris and free nuclei, which along with the presence of degenerate neutrophils, indicate on-going cell necrosis, presumably due to bacterial endotoxins like LPS. Some lavage samples appeared hemorrhagic, as they possessed low to moderate numbers of erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs] ) and/or macrophages with intracellular RBCs and hemosiderin pigment (hemoglobin breakdown product from RBCs). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from mice infected with 10 4 organisms possessed the greatest bacterial burden and marked pyogranulomatous inflammation ( Figure 6B ), while animals inoculated with 10 2 CFU displayed moderate bacterial numbers and degree of inflammation (data not shown). The BALF from mice infected with 10 3 organisms demonstrated intermediate inflammation and bacterial burden ( Figure 6C and 6D). Overall, no cytologic differences were observed between BALF from mice infected with B. mallei ATCC23344 and B. pseudomallei 1026b in terms of the type or magnitude of inflammation (when comparing equivalent inoculating doses). Additionally, the presence of hemorrhage and intracellular bacilli in BALF suggests that both organisms may disseminate by both lymphatic and hematogenous routes via infected macrophages or as extracellular bacilli, which is consistent with the results depicted in Figure 4 at the 72-hr time point.",

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from control and infected animals (see Figure 5 ) were concentrated onto a glass slide, fixed with methanol, air-dried, stained with modified Wright-Giemsa, and examined by microscopy (100X objective). Panel A shows a representative field of a sample collected from a mouse inoculated with sterile PBS (control). These control samples are low in cellularity and consist of occasional macrophages (arrow) and ciliated, columnar respiratory epithelial cells (inset). Panel B shows a representative field of a sample from a mouse infected with 10 4 B. mallei bacteria. Large numbers of degenerate neutrophils (block arrows) and foamy macrophages (arrows) are seen admixed with cellular debris and occasional red blood cells. Medium-sized bacilli are seen phagocytosed by neutrophils (asterisk). Extracellular bacteria are also present (arrowheads). Panel C is a representative field of a sample from mouse infected with 10 3 B. mallei cells, and Panel D is a representative field of a sample from mouse infected with 10 3 B. pseudomallei CFU. In both panels, moderate numbers of degenerate neutrophils and foamy macrophages are present, along with intracellular bacilli, illustrating the similar type and magnitude of inflammation elicited by the two species at the same dose. The inset in Panel C demonstrates that neutrophils contain bacilli adhered to their surface and within the lumens of intracytoplasmic vacuoles. reported for several agents including Aspergillus fumigatus (rats [85] ), monkeypox (non-human primates [86] ), coronavirus (rats [87] ), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mice [88] ), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (mice [89] ). This study is the first report describing the use of the device to study B. pseudomallei and B. mallei. Our results demonstrate that this aerosol delivery method produces the hallmarks of melioidosis and glanders (low infectious and lethal doses, rapid replication of agents in the lung and dissemination to spleen, bacteremia) and is consistent with other published models of aerosol infection for the organisms (intranasal, whole-body and noseonly aerosol exposure).",

We routinely infect 80 mice in less than 3 hours, and this time period encompasses anesthesia, inoculation and recovery from anesthesia. Furthermore, the model is safe. All manipulations are performed inside a Biosafety Cabinet, do not involve surgical procedures, and do not require extensive or expensive specialized equipment. These considerations are particularly relevant when studying highly pathogenic organisms under BSL3 containment.",

These investigators used whole body imaging and histopathology to demonstrate that mice inoculated with B. pseudomallei develop the primary focus of infection in the lungs, not the nasal passages. The key difference between their method and our delivery platform is the MicroSprayer\u00ae, which produces small aerosol particles. Revelli et al used 22sgauge needles attached to gastight syringes and infused bacterial liquid suspensions into the trachea [90] . Both intratracheal inoculation approaches provide a route of aerosol infection that circumvents the mouse nasal passageways, reduces the potentially confounding complications due to infection of the nasal associated lymphoid tissues and central nervous system, and thus represent valuable surrogates to study pulmonary disease caused by B. pseudomallei and B. mallei. , and His-tagged BPSS0908-BMAA1324 (panel E).

The x-axis represents serial two-fold dilutions of sera starting at 1:100 to 1:12,800. The results are expressed the mean absorbance (\u00b1 standard error).

The MicroSprayer\u00ae was used to deliver the indicated number of bacterial CFU into the lungs of BALB/c mice. Animals were then monitored for clinical signs of illness and morbidity. Survival data were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method and the LD 50 values were calculated according to Reed and Muench[55]. The number of animals/group is shown in parentheses. Control mice were inoculated with 50 \u00b5L of PBS using the MicroSprayer\u00ae. Panels A and B show 2 separate experiments to determine the LD 50 of B. pseudomallei strain 1026b. Panels C and D show 2 independent experiments to determine the LD 50 of B. mallei ATCC23344. With the exception of the survival curves for PBS and the lowest inoculating CFU dose, survival curves were found to be statistically different using the Logrank test for trend (panels A through D, p \u2264 0.05).doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0076804.g002 replicated at a faster rate than B. mallei during the first 48-hr of infection, as bacterial numbers increased 1000-fold for all 3 inoculating doses (Figure 4A). In mice infected with 10 LD 50 , B. pseudomallei loads reached ~ 5X10 7 CFU by 72-hr, and all animals succumbed to infection before the 96-hr time point. In mice challenged with 1 LD 50 , the bacterial numbers rose from 2X10 6 to nearly 10 8 organisms between 48 and 96-hr postinfection. In contrast, a 100-fold reduction in CFU was measured during the same time period in mice inoculated with the equivalent of 0.1 LD 50 of B. pseudomallei.Both agents were first detected in the spleen at 24-hr postchallenge (Figure 4C and 4D). Burkholderia pseudomallei disseminated to the organ in greater numbers than B. mallei, especially at the challenge doses of 10 and 1 LD 50 . Between 24 and 72-hr, the number of viable B. mallei bacteria increased by 4 orders of magnitude for all 3 inocula (Figure 4D). Thereafter, bacterial loads in animals infected with 0.1 and 1 LD 50 reached a plateau of 10 5 and 10 4 CFU, respectively, whereas the number of B. mallei cells in the spleen of mice challenged with 10 LD 50 continued to increase up to 10 6 organisms at 96-hr. Twenty-four hours after infection, the spleen of mice inoculated with 10 LD 50 of B. pseudomallei were heavily colonized and the agent continued to proliferate, nearly reaching 10 8 bacteria at 72-hr. Between 24 and 48-hr post-challenge, the bacterial loads in the spleen of animals inoculated with 1 and 0.1 LD 50 increased 50-fold. From that point forward, the bacterial counts remained constant in mice infected with 1 LD 50 , but steadily declined to undetectable levels by 96-hr in animals challenged with 0.1 LD 50 .",
