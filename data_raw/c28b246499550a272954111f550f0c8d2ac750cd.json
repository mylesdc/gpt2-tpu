However, the use of antiviral medications for pre-exposure prophylaxis has a very limited role and is generally not recommended for the majority of the population [10] . Also, NAIs confer only modest decreases in symptom duration for individuals presenting with uncomplicated illness [11] [12] [13] , and this treatment suffers from the selection of resistant strains, adverse effects, and high cost [14] [15] [16] . While the most effective way to prevent influenza disease and its severe outcomes is by vaccination, current coverage estimates are well below the Healthy People 2020 goal of 70% [17, 18] . Additionally, vaccine/strain mismatch can result in low vaccine efficacy [19] [20] [21] [22] . Vaccines may also be contraindicated, unavailable, less effective in immuno-compromised individuals, and suffer from perceived risks leading to \"vaccine hesitancy\" [23, 24] . Therefore, the development of effective novel strategies to prevent and treat influenza disease is a significant unmet need.",

For this reason, CPC and other quaternary ammonium compounds are commonly employed in the prevention of bacterial and fungal infections within healthcare settings. Yet there is little evidence demonstrating their effectiveness against respiratory viruses. Here, we evaluated CPC efficacy against the prototypical respiratory influenza virus demonstrating: (1) direct virucidal activity against influenza, (2) rapid activity following exposure, (3) viral ultrastructure disruption, (4) absence of influenza resistance following prolonged exposure, and (5) prevention and treatment of influenza infection in a murine model. -34) were cultured at 37\u00b0C and in 5% CO 2 to 90% confluence in DMEM supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, L-glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco, N.Y., USA). Increasing concentrations of CPC (10\u00b5g/mL to 250\u00b5g/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were added to media and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Following exposure, cells were washed 3 times in DMEM to remove residual CPC. Complete media was then reapplied and cells were returned to 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Viability was quantitated by neutral red uptake at 48 hours as previously described [30] . Toxicity data were used to determine the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50, Prism; v6.0 software). Influenza Cell Culture: Growth of the influenza virus was performed as previously described [31] . Briefly, MDCK were grown to 90% confluence followed by inoculation with influenza virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 1 hour. The inoculum was then removed and 500 \u00b5L of optiMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO)] was applied. Infected cells were grown at 32\u00b0C for 72 hours at 5% CO 2 . Tissue Culture Infective Dose 50% (TCID 50 ) analysis was performed as detailed elsewhere [32] . The TCID 50 was defined as the amount of virus required to produce a cytopathic effect in 50% of culture wells. The cytopathic effect was defined as focal rounding, degenerative changes, and detachment of cell monolayers.",

Moreover, continued exposure to CPC for 90 minutes led to a 90% decrease in influenza titer (Figure 2A) . Second, TEM analyses showed that while the viral envelope of untreated influenza viruses was intact, exposure to CPC led to disruption of the envelope and gross distortion of viral ultrastructure (eg cavitation, Figure 3 ) To further confirm that CPC disrupts the influenza virus envelope, we used ELISA to monitor the release of nucleoprotein from viruses in response to increasing concentrations of CPC. We found that exposure of virus to increasing concentrations of CPC (7.5, 10, and 20 \u00b5g/mL) resulted in significantly increased levels of viral nucleoprotein into the media supernatant (P \u2264 0.05, Figure  4 ). The level of released nucleoprotein reached a plateau at CPC concentrations above 10 \u00b5g/mL.

To determine the physiological relevance of CPC against influenza, we evaluated the efficacy of the CPC-based clinical formulation ARMS-1 containing 0.1% CPC w/v as the active ingredient [34] . We tested whether ARMS-1 conferred protection from the widely used mouse-adapted influenza H1N1 strain PR8 [36] in both prophylactic and therapeutic models of influenza infection. Evaluation of the prophylactic efficacy of ARMS-I showed that body weights of PBS-treated mice were significantly reduced at 3, 4, 5, and 6 days post infection (dpi), compared to ARMS-I treated mice (P \u2264 0.046, Figure 6A ). The increase in relative body weight between ARMS-I-treated and untreated mice ranged between 14% on day 3 and 24.8% on day 6 post-infection. Of note, ARMS-I-treated animals tended to exhibit higher body weights than oseltamivir-treated mice, with a significant difference noted on day 3 (95.7% vs 86.8%, respectively; P = 0.033). Increased weight in ARMS-I-treated animals was consistent with increased activity (decreased morbidity) noted during daily observation.

Interestingly, influenza B had lower EC 50 and EC 2log compared to influenza A suggesting that this strain is more susceptible to the effects of CPC. The reasons for this remain unclear as both influenza A and B derive their envelope from the host cell. However, reports have shown that the phospholipid composition of purified virions differs from that of the host cells. Whereas phosphatidylcholine is the major component in most mammalian cell membranes, in purified virions phosphatidylethanolamine dominates. In addition, analysis of lipid species of the viral envelope revealed subtle differences between influenza A and B strains [39] .

However, it is important to note that MDCK cells are quite robust; further cytotoxicity testing of CPC in human-derived cells, such as A549 cells, may add to our understanding of potential toxicity. We expect that longer exposure may also portend increased toxicity. Importantly, CPC has been deemed safe for human use when applied at concentrations up to 1000 \u00b5g/mL [25, 27, 28] . Additionally, extensive safety studies have already been conducted with CPC, including animal pharmacokinetic absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME), carcinogenicity, developmental toxicity, and reproductive toxicity studies [25, 26, 28] . These studies were conducted in a wide array of animal models (mice, rats, hamsters, rabbits, cats, and dogs) and humans demonstrating that CPC is safe for human use at the doses used in this study, including the 0.1% w/v clinical formulation.

The common annual epidemic of these viral pathogens in addition to influenza highlight the unmet need for broad anti-virals. The potential activity of CPC against non-enveloped pathogens including rhinovirus, bocavirus, or adenovirus remains unclear. However, since CPC has been shown to cause structural damage in non-enveloped bacteriophage [40] , this agent may have activity against non-enveloped human viral pathogens as well.

In contrast, QACs, including CPC, have been actively deployed since the 1930s with no apparent reduction in their effectiveness against bacteria and fungi [29] . The reason that resistance to CPC has not been observed is likely attributable to its mechanism of action, which involves binding to the microbial lipid bilayer, and CPC acts against influenza by disrupting the lipid envelope, which is analogous to the activity against bacteria and fungi. Since the viral envelope is host derived, the physicochemical mechanism of CPC is independent of intrinsic viral proteins and unlikely to be influenced by mutation. We have shown that influenza strains had no significant increase in EC 50 after 10 passages in the presence of sub-inhibitory CPC concentrations. This lack of resistance potentiation by CPC contrasts with the dramatic development of oseltamivir resistance after as little as 4 to 6 passages under similar conditions [42, 43] . In this regard subtherapeutic oseltamivir exposure can result in > 1000-fold increase in IC 50 [43, 44] . However, continued exposure of influenza to CPC beyond 10 passages should be performed to ensure that there is no late development of resistance.",

In addition, no toxicity was detected in the mice treated with ARMS-1 in our experimental mouse model. In fact, the ARMS-1 treatment group had higher weights and normal activity when compared with untreated, PBS-treated and oseltamivir-treated groups. This protection was most prominent when ARMS-1 was given either 15 minutes before or 4 hours after infection. Both of these time points are prior to clinical symptoms. These findings support prophylactic use and indicate that a CPC-based treatment would probably not work after infection is established.
