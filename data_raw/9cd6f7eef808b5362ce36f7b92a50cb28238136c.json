            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly infectious intestinal disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). A PEDV strain was isolated from the piglet intestinal tract in Vero cells in Jiangsu Province, designated as the JS-A strain. PEDV was identified as the isolated virus by cytopathology, immunofluorescence assay, western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, and sequence analysis. The full-length genome of the JS-A isolate and the S gene were systematically analyzed, indicating that PEDV JS-A belongs to the G2a subtype, which is closely related to the prevalent PEDV in many countries and different from many current vaccines. Animal regression tests showed that piglets that are orally infected with the virus continue to develop diarrhea with yellowish and unpleasant odors. Further, piglets showed reduced food consumption and weight loss in the challenged group, while there were no abnormalities in the control group. In addition, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I, and the downstream medium gene in the intestinal mucosa of newborn pigs infected with PEDV JS-A strain were studied. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) was the only IgG transport receptor and protected IgG from degradation. Therefore, PEDV JS-A infection might inhibit FcRn expression by downregulating TLRs and downstream signaling molecules. Taken together, isolation of the JS-A variant contributes to evolutionary analysis of the diarrhea virus. Further, the experimental infection model lays a foundation for further research related to vaccine development and the antiviral natural immune response of infected piglets, which helps us to better understand PEDV pathogenesis and immune mechanism.",

Subsequently, the virus affected many countries such as the Czech Republic, Belgium, Hungary, South Korea, Italy, and Thailand (Song and Park, 2012) . Since 2010, a large-scale outbreak of PEDV has occurred in swine herds around China. Then, the emergence of PEDV occurred in Ohio in the United States in 2013, which spread throughout the United States . Currently, due to lack of effective vaccines, isolation and identification of new PEDV strains to develop appropriate vaccines for prevention and control of the disease have garnered great interest.",

            "text": "PEDV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus within the Coronaviridae family (Brian and Baric, 2005) . Its genome size is about 28 kb, and it possesses at least seven open reading frames (ORF): ORF1a, ORF1b, spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). PEDV S protein plays a critical role in inducing neutralization antibodies, specific receptor binding, and membrane fusion. In addition, the S gene has shown a high degree of genetic variability. Therefore, it is often used to analyze PEDV genetic variation. According to phylogenetic analysis of S genes, PEDV strains have been divided into two clusters: genome I subtype and genome II subtype (Lee et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2014) . Further, several variant PEDV strains have been identified, which were characterized by insertion and deletion (INDEL) in labeled (S) genes named S-INDEL PEDV. The pathogenesis of PEDV is strain specific. Studies on its pathogenesis in piglets suggest that the PEDV non-S-INDEL strain has stronger pathogenicity compared to the PEDV S-INDEL strain (Chen et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2015; . PEDV JS-A belongs to the non-S-INDEL strain.",

In our study, the pathogenicity of JS-A in 5-day-old piglets was studied by clinical evaluation, quantitative analysis of virus copy number in the feces, histology, and immunohistochemistry. We also studied the gene regulation of TLRs, RIG-I, and downstream signaling pathways in the intestinal mucosa of pigs newly infected with JS-A. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genomic characteristics and pathogenicity of JS-A and the expression of TLRs, RIG-I, NF-\u03baB, and FcRn in the intestinal mucosa of infected piglets.",

In 2013, a sudden PED outbreak occurred in the United States and spread quickly throughout the country, as well as Canada and Mexico, resulting in high mortality of newborn piglets and serious financial problems (Mole, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013; Vlasova et al., 2014) . In this study, the isolated JS-A strain was more similar to the PEDV GD-1 strain, which was distant from classical strains such as CV777, LZC, and SM98, suggesting that PEDV is continuously evolving, with variation in the epidemiological process. Therefore, vaccines made from classical strains cannot provide effective protection, which is consistent with current findings. The PEDV S gene evolutionary tree and homology were further analyzed. The phylogenetic tree was divided into two evolutionary branches, namely G1 and G2 groups. The G1 group contained classic strains such as CV777, DR13, and SM98. The G2 group has been the most prevalent strain since 2010. JS-A, which has been separated this time, also belongs to G2a. This shows that JS-A is indeed the dominant strain in current pig farms. Induced stronger primary and anamnestic immune responses. The JS-A strain belongs to the non-S-INDEL, which is highly pathogenic.",

As expected, vomiting and severe diarrhea were observed in piglets from 1 to 6 dpi, indicating that JS-A was pathogenic to newborn piglets. Fecal swabs were collected from piglets infected with PEDV, and viral fecal shedding was detected by real-time PCR. PEDV RNA was detected from 1 to 14 dpi, suggesting that PEDV infection via fecal-oral contamination may be the main transmission route of piglet diarrhea in pig farms. Previously, it has been reported that coronavirus HKU15 may be transmitted via the respiratory route, in addition to fecal-oral transmission (Woo et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018) . Notably, we only observed microlesions in the jejunum and ileum of piglets infected with JS-A, but PEDV infection did not cause death of newborn piglets, despite drowsiness, anorexia, and watery diarrhea in these animals. These results suggest that PEDV JS-A has a milder toxicity and may be a weak strain. At the same time, there were slight differences in body weight and no significant differences in body temperature during infection. We also tested the serum-specific IgG, IgA, and neutralizing antibody levels in piglets at 7, 14, and 21 dpi and found that the antibody levels of IgG and IgA gradually increased with time. Further, the serum IgA level was higher than that of IgG. PEDV-challenged protection during the first infection was positively correlated with IgA and IgG antibodies in intestinal-associated lymphoid tissues and blood (de Arriba et al., 2002) , indicating that VN antibody can be detected in piglets inoculated with PEDV JS-A, and the titer of VN antibody gradually increases and remains high at the end of the experiment (Chen et al., 2016) . In our study, PEDV VN antibody was detected as early as 7 dpi in piglets infected with PEDV. The antibody titer of VN increased and remained high up to 21 dpi, at which point all pigs in the challenged group recovered completely.",

PEDV has been reported to induce innate immune responses in vivo. However, few studies have been reported. Therefore, in this study, in vivo models were used to further observe the natural TLRs and signaling pathway homeostasis regulated by the gut microbiota. Natural immunity is the first line of host defense against a variety of pathogenic infections . Furthermore, in vitro PEDV N and E protein mediated NF-\u03baB activation and had effects on cell growth and ER stress, upregulating IL-8 expression (Xu et al., 2013; Cao et al., 2015b) . However, PEDV non-S-INDEL N and nsp1 protein inhibited NF-\u03baB activation (Ding et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2017) . MyD88 is an essential component of the innate immune response to SARS-CoV infection in mice in vivo (Totura et al., 2015) . The pathogenesis of PEDV is strain specific. The lack of TRAF6 leads to enhanced viral replication and a significant reduction in the production of type I IFN after infection with RNA virus. In vivo, PEDV non-S-INDEL down-regulates the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway through negative regulation of TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, resulting in the final attenuation of MyD88, TRIF, and TRAF6 gene expression (Temeeyasen et al., 2018) .",

The study results showed that JS-A was a variant PEDV strain with weak pathology to piglets, compared to other emerging strains. High levels of serum IgG, IgA, and VN antibodies were also detected in the sera of infected piglets at 21 dpi. In addition, inoculation of piglets with JS-A suppressed FcRn expression via TLR, RIG-I, and NF-\u03baB mRNA expressions at 4 dpi, yet induced FcRn expression at 21 dpi in infected intestinal mucosa. All results showed that innate immunity was suppressed at 4 dpi and that innate immunity might have been activated by the virus at 21 dpi. The down-regulated expression of FcRn resulted in its incapacity to transport antibodies, providing another insight into the immune escape strategy of PEDV.",
