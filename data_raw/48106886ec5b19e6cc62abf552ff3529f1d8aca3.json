            "text": "We compared the rates of fever in adult subjects with laboratory-confirmed influenza and other respiratory viruses and examined the factors that predict fever in adults. Symptom data on 158 healthcare workers (HCWs) with a laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection were collected using standardized data collection forms from three separate studies. Overall, the rate of fever in confirmed viral respiratory infections in adult HCWs was 23\u00b74% (37/158). Rates varied by virus: human rhinovirus (25\u00b73%, 19/75), influenza A virus (30%, 3/10), coronavirus (28\u00b76%, 2/7), human metapneumovirus (28\u00b76%, 2/7), respiratory syncytial virus (14\u00b73%, 4/28) and parainfluenza virus (8\u00b73%, 1/12). Smoking [relative risk (RR) 4\u00b765, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1\u00b733-16\u00b725] and coinfection with two or more viruses (RR 4\u00b719, 95% CI 1\u00b721-14\u00b752) were significant predictors of fever. Fever is less common in adults with confirmed viral respiratory infections, including influenza, than described in children. More than 75% of adults with a viral respiratory infection do not have fever, which is an important finding for clinical triage of adult patients with respiratory infections. The accepted definition of 'influenza-like illness' includes fever and may be insensitive for surveillance when high case-finding is required. A more sensitive case definition could be used to identify adult cases, particularly in event of an emerging viral infection.",

Of respiratory infections, influenza is the most well studied viral infection, and is commonly reported (around 50%) as the cause of epidemics of respiratory infection, including nosocomial outbreaks [6] .

            "text": "Fever is thought of as the most common presenting symptom of influenza in hospital emergency departments; however, the presence of fever depends on the age of person and the type of virus [7] [8] [9] [10] . It is known that fever is less common in adults than children with influenza, and that adults may have atypical presentations [5, 6, 11] . In a matched case-control study in Finland, 317 laboratoryconfirmed influenza cases and 353 controls with respiratory symptoms were recruited in children aged 413 years. Fever was present in 89\u00b78% (317/353) and 35\u00b77% (126/353) of cases and controls, respectively [12] . In contrast to this, fever is not a common presentation in adults with laboratory-confirmed influenza. Monto et al. [13] examined clinical trial data of 3744 adult ILI cases (defined as body temperature 537\u00b78\u00b0C or patients subjective feeling of feverishness) and of those 2470 (66%) had laboratory-confirmed influenza. Fever (537\u00b78\u00b0C) was reported in 68% of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, compared to 40% other ILI cases [13] . During a randomized clinical trial (RCT) around the efficacy of facemask and hand hygiene in the household setting, 44% (15/34) of secondary cases with influenza A and 32% (8/ 25) of cases with influenza B had fever history [14] . The rate of fever was 66% (137/207) in hospitalized influenza cases in a US study [15] . Another US study showed that less than half (42\u00b74%) of healthcare workers (HCWs) with laboratory-confirmed influenza presented with fever [5] . Fever is a less common presenting symptom in elderly people which may lead to diagnostic and treatment delays [16] . In patients admitted with myocardial infarction, 9% had unrecognized and undiagnosed influenza on testing at admission, highlighting the low level of clinical suspicion of influenza [17] .",

The same methods, data collection forms and outcome measures, were used across the three studies, allowing the data to be pooled [21] [22] [23] . Two studies were conducted in Beijing China: trial 1 (2008/2009) and trial 2 (2009/2010) and another study (trial 3) was conducted in Hanoi, Vietnam in 2010/2011 [21] [22] [23] . In all clinical trials, participants were asked to complete diary cards on a daily basis to collect information on number of working hours, patients seen, mask use hours, high-risk procedures performed and appearance of respiratory symptoms. Thermometers were given the participants to measure their temperature daily and at symptom onset. Symptomatic cases were asked to complete sick patient follow-up forms and detailed information was collected on the following symptoms: chill or fever, cough, congestion, runny nose, sore throat, sneezes, lethargy, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, muscle or joint aches. Swabs of both tonsils and the posterior pharyngeal wall were collected on the day of reporting.",

Ninety (57%) cases were from China and 68 (43%) were from Vietnam. The mean age of HCWs was 32\u00b78 years and most participants were nurses (65%) and female (87%). Most cases were non-smokers (92%) and had not received influenza vaccine (86%). Viruses isolated included rhinovirus (n = 75, 47%), RSV (n = 28, 18%), influenza (n = 13, 8%), PIV (n = 12, 8%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV; n = 7, 4%), coronavirus (n = 7, 4%) and ADV (n = 1, 1%). More than one virus was isolated in 15 cases (9\u00b75%), including nine cases with influenza co-infection. Fever was documented in 23\u00b74% cases (37/158) with a positive laboratory viral diagnosis. Table 2 details rates of fever (538\u00b0C) associated with individual viral respiratory infections. HRV was the most common infection and 25\u00b73% (19/75) of these had a fever. In 28 cases of RSV, four (14\u00b73%) had fever; 8\u00b73% (1/12) of PIV and 30% (3/10) of influenza A cases had fever. Seven cases of coronavirus and hMPV each were confirmed and of those two (28\u00b76%) had fever. When cases with influenza and a co-infection were included, 36\u00b74% (8/22) had fever. In univariate analysis, country, gender and smoking were significant predictors of fever. Country and smoking remained significant predictors in multivariate analysis while gender became non-significant. Fever rate was significantly higher in HCWs in Vietnam compared to HCWs in China [RR 2\u00b799, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1\u00b724-7\u00b720]. Smokers were around five times more likely to have fever compared to non-smokers (RR 4\u00b765, 95% CI 1\u00b733-16\u00b725). Virus type was not associated with fever in univariate analysis; however, after adjusting for other variables, rates of fever were significantly higher in HCWs co-infected with more than one virus compared to all other viruses excluding influenza (RR 4\u00b719, 95% CI 1\u00b721-14\u00b752) ( Table 3) .",

The standard clinical case definition of ILI requires fever to be presentthe majority of influenza cases in this series would have been missed using the ILI definition. This has implications for effective triage, early antiviral treatment and preventive measures for adults with influenza, particularly during outbreaks and pandemic situations. For other respiratory infections, clinical case definitions need to be more sensitive, or >75% of cases will be missed. The main implication for future surveillance, measurements and research studies is that the ILI case definition in adults may be highly insensitive. For some types of surveillance systems, this may not be an issue, but for diagnostic screening in event of an emerging viral infection (such as for triage and implementation of infection control protocols) [24, 25] , a more sensitive case definition is needed.",

However, this variation may be due to different study base, case definition and viral strains, as well as the prospective measurement of incident infections. Many research studies use fever as an inclusion criterion for laboratory testing [13, 26] . While this may be suitable for studies in children, it is not adequately sensitive for studies of adults, as we have shown the majority of confirmed cases will be missed. The cut-off point for fever could be another factor in sensitivity. Some studies have set lower cut-off points for fever, and report higher rates of fever in laboratory-confirmed influenza cases [13, 27] . Carrat et al. collected data of cases presented in 35 general practices in France and collected nasal swabs from suspected influenza cases and defined fever as 537\u00b78\u00b0C. They found fever in influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1) and influenza negative cases in 95\u00b72%, 77\u00b75% and 72\u00b77%, respectively. Applying a cut-off of 538\u00b72\u00b0C, the corresponding rates are 82\u00b72%, 59\u00b73% and 43\u00b79% [27] .

Pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza cases will also be missed, although infectivity and transmissibility of these cases is yet to be proven [29] .

Fever (539\u00b70\u00b0C) was recorded in 68% cases with ADV, 84% influenza A virus, 65% influenza B, 41% PIV-1, 50% PIV-2, 47% PIV-3, and 52% RSV. Van den Hoogen and colleagues estimated the prevalence and clinical symptoms of hMPV infection, in The Netherlands and fever was reported in 61% of the hMPV-positive cases [31] . In Hong Kong, hMPV was found in 5\u00b75% (32/587) of children admitted in hospitals and all had fever [32] . Manoha et al. examined nasal wash specimens from 931 hospitalized children and found hMPV (6%), RSV (28\u00b75%), rhinoviruses (18\u00b73%), influenza A (6%), PIV-1 (0\u00b72%) and PIV-3 (0\u00b73%). Fever was reported in 39\u00b72% cases with hMPV, 37\u00b78% cases with RSV and 30\u00b72% with rhinovirus [33] . Of the 210 elderly patients with influenza and 145 with RSV, fever was reported in 65% and 50%, respectively [3] .

The implication of this finding is that for rapid treatment and reducing the risk of transmission of infection, clinicians should be aware that a diagnosis of viral respiratory infection, even influenza, is possible in the absence of fever. Many of these infections are transmissible even when infected persons are asymptomatic or presymptomatic, and greater vigilance for respiratory symptoms in HCWs could reduce nosocomial transmission of respiratory viral infections. The absence of fever should not preclude a differential diagnosis of influenza or other respiratory viruses in adults.",
