            "text": "During the outbreak of SARS in 2002/3, a prototype virus was isolated from a patient in Frankfurt/ Germany (strain Frankfurt-1). As opposed to all other SARS-Coronavirus strains, Frankfurt-1 has a 45-nucleotide deletion in the transmembrane domain of its ORF 7b protein. When overexpressed in HEK 293 cells, the full-length protein but not the variant with the deletion caused interferon beta induction and cleavage of procaspase 3. To study the role of ORF 7b in the context of virus replication, we cloned a full genome cDNA copy of Frankfurt-1 in a bacterial artificial chromosome downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Transfection of capped RNA transcribed from this construct yielded infectious virus that was indistinguishable from the original virus isolate. The presumed Frankfurt-1 ancestor with an intact ORF 7b was reconstructed. In CaCo-2 and HUH7 cells, but not in Vero cells, the variant carrying the ORF 7b deletion had a replicative advantage against the parental virus (4-and 6-fold increase of virus RNA in supernatant, respectively). This effect was neither associated with changes in the induction or secretion of type I interferon, nor with altered induction of apoptosis in cell culture. However, pretreatment of cells with interferon beta caused the deleted virus to replicate to higher titers than the parental strain (3.4-fold in Vero cells, 7.9-fold in CaCo-2 cells).",

This difference could explain earlier observations of enhanced virulence of Frankfurt-1 in Hamsters as compared to other SARS-Coronavirus reference strains and identifies the SARS-CoV 7b protein as an attenuating factor with the SARS-Coronavirus genome. Because attenuation was focused on the early phase of infection in-vivo, ORF 7b might have contributed to the delayed accumulation of virus in patients that was suggested to have limited the spread of the SARS epidemic.",

Because these ORFs are not shared between different CoV groups, they are referred to as group-specific ORFs [20] . Proteins encoded by group-specific ORFs have been shown to influence pathogenesis, virus replication, or host immune response [17, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . During the human SARS epidemic, SARS-CoV has rapidly acquired deletions in several of its group-specific ORFs [7, [25] [26] [27] .

The study of proteins in the whole virus context reflects virushost interactions more realistically, and takes into account intraviral protein interactions. Such experiments can be done using reverse genetics techniques which for most plus-strand viruses rely on cloned cDNA copies of the whole RNA genome that can be mutagenized in-vitro [28] [29] [30] . Different approaches have been followed to implement CoV reverse genetics. A great challenge in this regard is the huge size of the CoV genome, making cloning procedures difficult because plasmid-based cDNA constructs are instable in E. coli. In-vitro ligation of subgenomic cDNA fragments without the assembly of full-length plasmids has been successfully used to establish CoV reverse genetics [31] [32] [33] . As an alternative, full-length cDNA copies have been reconstructed and kept in vaccinia virus [34, 35] . A third approach is based on bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) for keeping full-length CoV cDNA stable, owing to a low copy number of BAC DNA per E. coli cell [36] [37] [38] [39] . The first two systems use T7 RNA polymerase promoter-driven in-vitro transcription of capped, infectious RNA that is transfected into cells. The latter uses a CMV promoter and relies on the transfection of full-length cDNA into cells, which is then transcribed in the nucleus into infectious RNA. In this study we have implemented a modified approach to CoV reverse genetics by cloning the entire SARS-CoV genome downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promotor in a BAC. Using the linearized BAC construct as a template for in vitro transcription, this system combines plasmid-based handling of cDNA constructs with direct delivery of genome-like RNA into the cytoplasm.",

The protein is a type III integral transmembrane protein located in the Golgi compartment [41] . It has been shown previously that the protein is a structural virion component, that it is dispensable for replication in various cell cultures, and that it induces apoptosis in cultured cells if overexpressed [18, 40] . The pro-apoptotic effect seems to be limited to late stages of the apoptotic cascade [18] . Qualitatively the same effect was confirmed in studies on a recombinant virus, containing a combined deletion of ORF 7a and ORF 7b [18] . However, it is unclear to what extent either the ORF 7a or ORF 7b proteins, respectively, contribute to the effect. It is also unclear to what degree the ORF 7b protein alone influences virus replication in-vivo. This is relevant for the Frankfurt-1 virus because it has been used as a model virus in several studies on pathogenesis and antiviral drug research (e.g [42] [43] [44] [45] ). Finally it is unclear whether the Frankfurt-1 ORF 7b deletion has been acquired during cell culture, or whether it may have been present already in the patient and may have undergone transmission.",

Of note, clinical samples from the wife of the index patient, who got infected by her husband in later course, did not contain the deletion either ( Figure 1 ). To exclude that a minor background of the virus population in patient samples might have carried the deletion already prior to virus isolation, a second PCR was done with a primer bridging the deleted region (i.e., it bound up-and downstream of the deletion and would only amplify deletion-containing viruses).

As shown in Figure 2B , expression of both ORF 7a and ORF 7b but not ORF 7b del induced IFN-dependent reporter gene expression. In those cultures superinfected with SeV, none of the plasmids reduced the SeV-associated, IFN-dependent reporter gene expression. The Ebolavirus VP35, a known antagonist of interferon induction, clearly showed reduction of reporter gene expression if used in the same system ( Figure 2B ) [48, 49] .",

Fragments were initially cloned in high copy number plasmid vectors, or, if refractory to cloning, in low copy plasmids as shown in Figure 3 . Except some marker mutations (see below), the sequence of cDNA inserts in the seven resulting subclones was corrected to match that of the cell culture-derived virus by plasmidbased inverse PCR and fragment-extension PCR. For construction of the variant with an intact ORF 7b, the 45 nt deletion was filled in by oligonucleotide extension PCR on subclone pF ( Figure 3 ). Corrected subclones were assembled in a stepwise procedure into four BAC clones containing about a quarter of the SARS-CoV genome each, which where then joined into a full length BAC cDNA clone (refer to Figure 3 and the Materials and Methods section for more details on the construction). BACs containing both versions of subclone F were assembled. Both BACs were sequenced, confirming presence of all marker mutations and absence of any further mutations (refer to Influence on apoptosis and type I interferon induction by overexpression of ORF 7a, ORF 7b, and ORF 7b with the Frankfurt-1-specific deletion Interferon beta promoter-specific reporter gene expression (y-axis), shown as the factor of induction as compared to the mock-transfected, non-superinfected control (see below).

Interferon-specific reporter gene expression was determined 24 h after superinfection (black bars) or mock infection (grey bars). The experiment was done in triplicate and standard deviations are shown. To determine interferon-specific expression, the Firefly luminescence signal was divided by the Renilla luciferase signal.",

Several SARS-CoV accessory gene products have been implicated in the induction of apoptosis, including the ORF 7a and ORF 7b proteins as confirmed in this study (Figure 2 ). Activation of apoptosis was therefore compared in cells infected with either rSCV or r7b\u0394TMD. Vero cells were infected at an MOI of 5 of either virus and assayed by Western blot for activation of caspase 3, the central element of the apoptosis induction cascade. As opposed to the clear effect seen in overexpression experiments ( Figure  2 ), both viruses induced partial cleavage of procaspase 3 at 60 hours post infection, and complete cleavage after 72 hours (Figure 8 ). To confirm these results we analyzed cleavage of poly-ADP ribose polymerase type 1 (PARP-1), a downstream effect of caspase-3 activation [51] . As shown in Figure 8 , Western blot showed little differences in processing of PARP-1 in Vero cells with both viruses. It was concluded that the deletion-dependent ablation of the pro-apaptotic effect of ORF 7b as observed in overexpression experiments was irrelevant in the context of full virus replication in cell culture.",

Syrian Golden hamsters have been shown to be an acceptable rodent model for SARS-CoV replication and pathogenicity [52, 53] . Four groups of three hamsters were infected via the intranasal route with 10 4 PFU of either rSCV or r7b\u0394TMD, and sacrificed on day 1 or 3, respectively. Whole lungs were minced and tested for infectious virus and viral RNA. The deleted virus yielded 95-fold more infectious particles and 23-fold more RNA copies in the lungs on day 1 (Figure 9 and Table 1 ). Differences decreased but remained qualitatively equivalent by day 3 (16-fold and 1.8-fold more infectious virus and RNA, respectively). The differences in RNA concentrations were borderline significant on day 1 (Table 1) . T-tests did not identify further significant differences between our small groups of animals, and we did not want to use more animals for these experiments. In one of three animals sacrificed on day 1 post infection, rSCV failed to replicate entirely ( Figure 9 ). The replication advantage for r7b\u0394TMD was in concordance with findings in CaCo-2 and HuH-7 cell cultures ( Figure 5 ).",

            "text": "In the present study we have characterized a naturallyacquired deletion in the ORF 7b of the primary SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 isolate by reverse genetics. In contrast to other plus strand RNA viruses it has taken rather long to complete the first coronavirus reverse genetics systems [28, 30, 31, 34, 37, 54] . It has been difficult to clone complete CoV genomes due to their large sizes and toxicity or lability of constructs in E. coli [31, 34, 37] . This has been circumvented by Baric et al. by the use of subgenomic plasmids that are ligated in-vitro to full genomic cDNA, prior to transcription and electroporation [32] . We tried this approach initially, but we failed to generate sufficient amounts of full-length cDNA for in-vitro transcription. Thiel et al. have described an approach to generating fulllength cDNA by stepwise assembly of an entire coronavirus genome in a pox virus backbone [34] . As we had not worked with pox viruses before, this technique appeared rather difficult to establish. As a third alternative, Enjuanes and coworkers have presented an approach based on cloning of the entire genome in BAC and transfecting the BAC-contained viral cDNA under the control of a CMV promoter [37] . The use of BAC DNA provides the remarkable benefit of being able to handle full length genomic DNA in one plasmid backbone, using standard DNA cloning techniques. As demonstrated in several studies of that group [24, 36, 37, [55] [56] [57] , BAC manipulations are rather fast and straightforward, while providing little opportunity for de-novo mutations resulting from DNA manipulation steps. In our strategy we used a bacteriophage T7-derived RNA polymerase promoter instead of the CMV promoter because we wanted to provide a genome that most closely resembled that of the virus, using cytoplasmic sites for replication and circumventing transcription and possible splicing in the nucleus [37, 38, 56] . A T7 promoter has not been used before with a plasmid-contained CoV cDNA genome; it was conceivable that leaky transcription might enhance underlying toxicity of CoV genomes in E. coli. Our study shows that the SARS-CoV genome is stable in BAC despite the T7 promoter. Interestingly, Enjuanes and colleagues have made BAC-based full length clones for different CoV and reported that their SARS-CoV BAC clone was more stable than, e.g., the one they developed for TGEV [36] . The SARS-CoV genome may thus be more stable in E. coli than that of other CoVs. It remains to be seen whether combined T7/BAC infectious cDNA clones can also be constructed for other CoVs.",

This strain has been employed as a prototypic SARS-CoV in several studies on pathogenesis and antiviral therapy (e.g., [42] [43] [44] [45] ). By analysis of primary clinical samples from the patients treated in 2003 for SARS in Frankfurt, we could show that the mutation has been selected during initial isolation in cell culture, and that it did not stem from the Frankfurt index patient [2] . Initial characterizations of the protein by overexpression experiments suggested reduced induction of interferon and apoptosis in association with the deletion, which led us to reconstruct the corresponding viruses with and without the deletion by reverse genetics. In concordance with earlier findings, type I interferon was neither induced nor produced by either SARS-CoV variant in our study [50, [58] [59] [60] [61] . It is assumed that CoV either encode a range of proteins interacting with interferon sensing, or shield their RNA from immune recognition through the formation of double membrane vesicle-based replication compartments [60, [62] [63] [64] . Our experiments suggest that ORF 7b is not necessary for SARS-CoV counteraction against the induction of the interferon beta promoter. It also seems unlikely that ORF 7b contributes to the interference of SARS-CoV with secretion of interferon alpha [62] . However, the deleted virus showed slightly decreased sensitivity to pretreatment of cells with interferon. This effect was remarkable since earlier studies only determined opposite (= evasive) effects on the interferon response for CoV accessory proteins. These include interference with the interferon signalling cascade in the case of SARS-CoV protein 6, or prevention of activation of interferon-sensitive Induction of apoptosis by recombinant coronaviruses rSCV and r7b\u0394TMD In-vivo effect of the ORF7b deletion Figure 9 In-vivo effect of the ORF7b deletion. Golden Syrian hamsters were infected with 10 4 PFU of rSCV and r7b\u0394TMD (x-axis). Heat inactivated rSCV served as mock control. For each point of time post infection, three animals per virus variant were sacrificed (animals 1, 2, 3 as identified on the xaxis). Lungs were taken in total. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay and viral RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Light grey bars represent log copies of viral RNA, dark grey bars represent PFU per g lung tissue.

However, the additional extent of attenuation on top of the effect of interferon beta was of the same size as that observed in untreated cell cultures (compare Figure 5 and Figure 7 ) and did hardly increase with increasing interferon concentrations. This suggests an additive rather than a synergistic effect of ORF 7b and interferon on the attenuation of virus replication. In spite of the high relevance of the interferon response for controlling SARS-CoV replication, we should therefore assume that ORF 7b plays no role in the context of the type I interferon system [62, 66] .",

Our initial overexpression experiments pointed to a strong pro-apoptotic effect of intact ORF 7b, which was in concordance with a study by Schaecher et al. who found that sgRNA 7-derived proteins activated caspase 3 if overexpressed [40] . Complementary to their study, however, our experiments did not confirm any similar effect specifically for the ORF 7b protein in the full virus context. Schaecher et al. studied a recombinant virus with a double deletion of both ORF 7a and 7b, and this virus induced apoptosis clearly less efficiently than the parent full-length virus [18, 19] .

This is remarkable because SARS-CoV variants with deletions in the ORF 7 (and also ORF 8) gene region have been transmitted and maintained in humans in the late phases of the 2003 epidemic [25] [26] [27] . It has never been formally addressed whether these viruses might have undergone particularly efficient transmission. We therefore determined whether the ORF 7b deletion in Frankfurt-1 conferred a replicative advantage in-vivo, using Syrian Golden Hamsters as a model of human SARS-CoV infection [52, 53] . Interestingly, the enhancing effect of the ORF 7b deletion was even more pronounced in hamsters than in cell culture. Hamsters infected with the deleted variant had significantly more virus RNA and a 95fold increase of infectious virus titers in their lungs after 24 h. The rate of successful infections was 6/6 with the deleted virus and 5/6 with the full virus. In concordance with these observations, Roberts et al. have described ca. 10-fold more efficient replication of Frankfurt-1 in hamsters as compared to Urbani and HKU-39849 [52, 53] . Mortality in Hamsters was only observed with Frankfurt-1 (3 of 20 animals) but not Urbani and HKU-39849 [52, 53] . It was suggested that an amino acid exchange (L1148F) in the S2-domain of the spike protein of Frankfurt-1 against both Urbani and HKU-39849 might explain the difference. However, a replicative difference in extent similar to that reported by Roberts et al. was observed in our study between two variants of Frankfurt-1 that differed only by the ORF 7b deletion. As the deletion is not present in Urbani or any other prototype strain, this identifies the 7b protein as a potential attenuating factor within the genome of SARS-CoV.",

Pellets were dissolved in 50 \u03bcl of 1\u00d7 Chaps buffer containing 1 mM PMSF and 5 mM DTT followed by three freeze/thaw cycles. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 16,000 g and the clarified lysate was dissolved in 1\u00d7 SDS loading buffer. 10 \u03bcl of postnuclear lysate were loaded on precast 412% Bis-Tris gradient gels. Separated proteins were electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Dassel, Germany) and blocked for 1 h with 1\u00d7 RotiBlock (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Membranes were washed with PBS and incubated over night with primary antibody at 4\u00b0C. Rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-3 and anti-PARP antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, USA) were diluted 1:1000 in PBS-T. Rabbit anti-flag antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was diluted 1:5000 in PBS-T. Membranes were washed 4 times for 5 minutes with PBS-T. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, USA) was used at 1:2000 dilution in PBS-T and incubated on membranes for 1 hour. Membranes were washed four times with PBS-T before LumiGLO reagent (Cell Signaling, Danvers, USA) was added. Membranes were exposed to scientific imaging film (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) for appropriate times before development.",
