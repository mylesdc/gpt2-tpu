The objectives of this study were to identify content volume and sentiment polarity of social media records relevant to healthcare services in China. A list of the key words of healthcare services were used to extract data from WeChat and Qzone, between June 2017 and September 2017. The data were put into a corpus, where content analyses were performed using Tencent natural language processing (NLP). The final corpus contained approximately 29 million records. Records on patient safety were the most frequently mentioned topic (approximately 8.73 million, 30.1% of the corpus), with the contents on humanistic care having received the least social media references (0.43 Million, 1.5%). Sentiment analyses showed 36.1%, 16.4%, and 47.4% of positive, neutral, and negative emotions, respectively. The doctor-patient relationship category had the highest proportion of negative contents (74.9%), followed by service efficiency (59.5%), and nursing service (53.0%). Neutral disposition was found to be the highest (30.4%) in the contents on appointment-booking services. This study added evidence to the magnitude and direction of public perceptions on healthcare services in China's hospital and pointed to the possibility of monitoring healthcare service improvement, using readily available data in social media.",

For example, patient-initiated violence against health workers [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , and the tension between doctors and patients for their dissatisfaction with the quality of healthcare [7, 8] , were wildly covered in the Chinese media. While patient experience surveys on the national level showed that patients were generally satisfied with both in-patient and out-patient services [9] . Such differences may result from biases rooted in the survey and media coverage; however, the inconsistency also pointed to the need for additional data sources to monitor public opinions on Chinese healthcare services.",

Users' posts on the social media platforms would generate a large volume of real-time data regarding public or private issues, among which healthcare related information scatters. Therefore, the utilization of social media data for healthcare research becomes a dramatically growing field and already covered various medical and healthcare research fields [11, 12] . Sinnenberg and colleagues proposed four ways in which social media data were used in healthcare studies:",

For the content analysis, most studies focused on measuring public discussion on specific diseases [13] [14] [15] , sentiment analysis for medical interventions (e.g., cancer screening) [16, 17] , identifying safety concerns among health consumers [18] , detecting adverse events of health products [19, 20] . Several researchers studied patient experience, based on the comments posted by patients from online health communities in China [21, 22] , but few studies have been conducted to gather information on healthcare services related topics using social media data. Meanwhile, although sentiment analysis has been wildly applied to process user sentiments associated with health-related text [23] , the lexical resource and tools designed for doing health-related sentiment analysis in Chinese language are few and far between. Fast-advancing in technology and economy, social media users and their activities spiked in China, which made social media a promising source for healthcare service monitoring. In China, the internet penetration rate reached 55.8% at the end of 2017 [24] , with local providers dominating the market, rather than Facebook and Twitter, which are not accessible in China. Chinese social media sites have a unique landscape, and it may not only be used as a communication software but also as an entry point for information. As subsidiaries of Tencent Holdings Limited, Shenzhen, China, WeChat and Qzone are two leading social media and networking services platforms. Each of them reached more than 938 million and 632 million monthly active user accounts in the first quarter of 2017 [25] . According to the 2016 WeChat Data Report, typical users of WeChat were born in the 80s or 90s [26], representing a wide breadth of demographic group in China. Besides providing multimedia communication and supporting social networking, WeChat also has \"Official Accounts\", which serve as channels for publishing articles to the public. Any individual or organization can apply for having their own official account to broadcast their ideas and believes. As for Qzone, it is a platform bundled with QQ, a popular online messaging application in China. Qzone allows users to create their own personal page to write blogs and post updates. And users could be able to express their individual opinions and attitudes freely and instantly on the social media platforms. Subject to the platforms' terms of service and privacy policy agreed upon by users [27, 28] , three kinds of information were collected, stored, and used by the platforms: (1) Personal information;",

And this lexicon contains six information technology service-related terms, namely, \"Weibo\", \"WeChat\", \"website\", as well as \"Self-service machine\". Second, we developed a set of searching strategy to extract the relevant data from the two sources based on the corresponding lexicon of topics. The entire list of search terms for each category and its corresponding searching strategy were provided in Supplementary  Table S1 . Finally, we applied the search strategies to the database of publicly posted materials to screen for posts related to the healthcare service categories to construct the corpus.

Such services enable us to split reviews and blogs into sentences, and each sentence was filtered to classify whether it contained target service topic keywords and terms. If the sentences, containing certain keywords and terms, belonged to the corresponding topic of healthcare services categories as listed in Table S1 , then they would be divided into a certain category. By counting the appearances of each service topic keywords in terms of the number of sentences in the corpus, we can aggregate the counts at the topic level and calculate the proportion of different topics from the social media corpus. For the sentiment analysis tool in Chinese, we also select Tencent NLP, as its algorithm was trained by hundreds of billions of entries of internet corpus data in Chinese and with successful application in other Tencent products (https://nlp.qq.com). OpenAPI with function of Chinese batch texts automatic summarization and sentiment analysis of Tencent NLP enable us to categorize the sentences on certain topic in the social media corpus into a sentiment polarity classification (i.e., neutral, positive, and negative).

For instance, the contents related to doctor-patient relationship only take percentage of 2.5% in the corpus, however 74.9% of the content revealed negative feedback. The varied sentiment polarity distribution of the topics may have important policy implications for healthcare reform in China. For example, 30.4% of the social media references to appointment-booking service reflected neutral feedback, which may suggest that the unsureness of the public on this novel service.",

Findings from a recent qualitative study found that patients cared about the environment and facilities in hospital the most [39] , whereas in our study patient safety issues had the greatest volume. Another research examined the online doctor reviews in China revealed that most posts expressed positive attitudes towards the physicians [21] .

Furthermore, although all the material in the databases are in Chinese, and therefore most likely be generated by users from China, we are currently not able to determine whether the posts, containing the key terms on healthcare, were describing the Chinese healthcare system or discussing foreign healthcare systems in Chinese language.

The findings provide an overview of public opinion on healthcare services, which could help regulators to set up the benchmark, on a national or regional level, to monitor the progress of healthcare improvements between comparator districts and services domains. It is also a necessary complement to the traditional paper-based consumer survey.
