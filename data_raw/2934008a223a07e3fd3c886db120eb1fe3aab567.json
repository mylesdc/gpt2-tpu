Fever \u2265 39\u00b0C (66.7%), fatigue (64.6%), and purulent sputum (52.1%) was the most common symptoms in viral pneumonia patients. On multivariate analysis, myalgia was included in the model for pneumonia associated with influenza infection. In the CURB-65 model only influenza infection was found independently associated with severe disease (CURB-65 score \u2265 3) out of variables, including age(years), sex, current smoking status, sick contact with febrile patients, numbers of comorbidity, presence of influenza infection, presence of PIV infection, with P = 0.021, OR 7.86 (95% CI 1.37-45.04). Conclusion: Respiratory virus was not a bystander, but pathogenic in pneumonia and was a common cause of CAP.",

Base on our methodological design, finally, we found that virus detected in pneumonia was not a bystander, but pathogenic. Respiratory virus accounted for about one-third of pathogens in CAP. Hence, it was a common cause of CAP. In view of high prevalence of viral CAP, there was an urgent need to consider routine laboratory detection in hospitalized CAP patients for an adequate diagnosis of respiratory viruses. In addition, considering positive correlation between influenza infection and severe disease, we recommended testing for influenza virus routinely in severe individuals, especially during the active period of influenza activity. Virus in pneumonia may be a bystander, but not pathogenic. In Johnstone's and de Roux's reports, though aetiology of nonimmunocompromised CAP patients were reported, the real role of virus was not determined [5, 16] . Whether samples obtained from upper respiratory tract can really mirror the true situation occurred in the lower respiratory tract and lung, it needs to be further studied. Hence, two control groups were introduced in the present study to answer this question. One of the purposes of enrolment of these two control groups was to describe inapparent infection in volunteer individuals without clues of acute respiratory illness within one month and a higher rate of viral infection in ILI patients. Another question was that the extreme sensitivity of the NATs was thought to be due to false-positive previously. Then, volunteer controls in our study turned to be virus negative, just what we expected. Comparison of positive rate of virus between two control groups and CAP patients in our study revealed that false positive of NATs did not appeared in our study. Second, in both ILI and pneumonia patients, seroconversion of IgG did not happen in all viral positive patients. Similarly, in report by Gencay, seroconversion of IgG was found only in 41% of patients diagnosed with lower respiratory tract viral infection [18] . Hence, even if four-fold elevation of virus specific antibody titer did not appear, the positive results from NATs were deemed to be the pathogen of current pneumonia. Similar to Jennings's finding [3] , positive results of virus by NATs in CAP should be considered as the pathogens.",

            "text": "Likewise, clinical features varied among studies. Jennings in New Zealand reported that the presence of myalgia was associated with pneumonia caused by any respiratory virus and influenza pneumonia [3] . The presence of chest pain and leukocytosis had been found to be far less common in those patients with a viral infection than in those with a bacterial infection [4, 5] . It was similar in our study that leukocytosis was less common in virus infected patients, when compared to viral negative patients. While, Roux demonstrated that chronic heart failure and the absence of expectoration was associated with pure viral pneumonia when comparing to pneumococcal CAP [16] . However, although several variables were associated with some types of pathogen, clinical characteristics were unable to reliably distinguish viral pneumonia from viral negative pneumonia or bacteria pneumonia. All of these differences were clinically insignificant unless combined with the detection of viruses. It should be noted that all of the differences identified in the clinical characteristics among studies, may also be related to diverse geographical, cultural, and healthcare environments, though, this has not been confirmed [25] .",

Viral pneumonia seemed to be a self-limited illness. However, one influenza pneumonia patients in our study died, because of worsen of comorbidity. Also, clinical course of other two patients with viral pneumonia went deteriorated and died after discharge from hospital. However, illness in virus positive patients was similar to virus negative patients in length of hospital stay, intensive care requirement and 30-day mortality. Hence, one of our puzzled questions remained that among viral pneumonia patients, who needed to be treated with antiviral agents? Until now, only influenza can be effectively treated with neuraminidase inhibitors. Obviously, considering the high prevalence of viral CAP in Guangzhou and influenza infection as an independent variable in the severe disease model, routine laboratory detection should be taken in hospitalized CAP patients at admission for an adequate diagnosis of respiratory viruses, especially influenza virus in severe individuals. Then they may be benefited from antiviral treatment, if the latter was conducted in early stage [26] .",

Plenty of evidences had shown that virus infection predisposes the respiratory tract to superinfection by another pathogen, with bacteria the most common [27] [28] [29] . However, they were not benefited from preventive prescription of antibiotics [30] . Antibiotics in these patients had been reported to lead to the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in clinically relevant bacteria [31] . In our study, three pneumonia patients had virus and bacteria co-infection. They were not treated with any antiviral drug. With the \"aid\" of antibiotics, they recovered from illness. There was not enough information to illustrate the real role of antibiotics in the treatment of viral pneumonia in our study yet. Hence, further randomised placebo-controlled trials of antibiotic treatment for adult viral pneumonia, similar to that in the paediatrics [32] , is needed to help answer the question.",

Increasing the sample types, such as nasopharyngeal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and sputum, may improve the yield of virus. Although multiple methods were applied, we were undoubtedly still underestimating the prevalence of respiratory virus infection and other types of pathogens. Hence, viral negative patients could not be ruled out from other viruses' infection, which was outside the scope of testing in our study. Second, bacteria and atypical pathogens were not studied. Hence, comparisons of clinical characteristics were only made between virus positive patients and virus negative patients. Finally, only three seasons were covered in our study. A longer time that lasted two or more years and more patients enrolled may provide us more useful information. However, further work is ongoing to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of viral CAP deeply.",
