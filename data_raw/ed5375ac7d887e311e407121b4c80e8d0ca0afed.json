We report recent extensions to this approach. Results: We have rebuilt the original RNASHAPES as a repository of components that allows us to integrate several established tools for RNA structure analysis: RNASHAPES, RNAALISHAPES and PKNOTSRG, including its recent extension PKISS. As a spin-off, we obtain heretofore unavailable functionality: e. g. with PKISS, we can now perform abstract shape analysis for structures holding pseudoknots up to the complexity of kissing hairpin motifs. The new tool PALIKISS can predict kissing hairpin motifs from aligned sequences. Along with the integration, the functionality of the tools was also extended in manifold ways. Availability and implementation: As before, the tool is available on the Bielefeld Bioinformatics server at",

Relying on the recent BELLMAN'S GAP system (Sauthoff et al., 2013) , which implements the ADP framework, we have built a repository of components that allows us to integrate several established tools for RNA structure analysis: RNASHAPES, RNAALISHAPES and PKNOTSRG, including its recent extension PKISS.

RFAM (Burge et al., 2013) holds the corresponding family model RF00507, although the tools of RFAM cannot explicitly model pseudoknots. PKISS (Theis et al., 2010) in -enforce mode reveals that for 11 family members, minimal free energy structures are H-types, another 11 are K-type pseudoknots and for only one member a purely nested structure has the best energy. The recently sequenced MERS genome (KF958702.1) is annotated with a homologous frameshift site, whereas the structure of the triggering element remains unclear. Structure prediction with PKISS for a 100 bp stretch downstream the slippery site attests a most stable K-type pseudoknot (see Fig. 2) . A second run of PKISS, this time in probability mode, shows that the shape class of this particular K-type pseudoknot has an overwhelming Boltzmann probability of 99%; leaving not much probability mass for any other shape classes.",

For example, '[[ ][ ][ ]]' indicates a cloverleaf shape, and '[_[_[ ]_]]' a single stem-loop with a 5 0 bulge and an internal loop. Classical abstract shape analysis reports minimum free energy structures from different shape classes, or Boltzmann structure probabilities accumulated by shape. This gives synoptic information about the folding space of a given RNA sequence, without heuristics or sampling. Extending RNASHAPES, we added different modes of treating dangling bases (consistent with RNAFOLD options -d0, -d1 and -d2)(Janssen et al., 2011;Lorenz et al., 2011), computation of base pair probabilities and maximum expected accuracy (MEA) folding(Lu et al., 2009).",
