Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a critical role in lung innate immunity, but contradictory results have been reported regarding their functionality following HIV infection. Here, using the SIV rhesus macaque model, we document the effect of SIV infection on the phenotypic and functional properties of AMs. Following infection with SIV mac251 , AMs in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sampled over 2-to 20-weeks post-infection (wpi) were compared to those in BAL samples from na\u00efve macaques. AM expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and chemokine RANTES drastically increased 2-wpi compared to AMs of na\u00efve macaques (p < 0.0001 for all), but dropped significantly with progression to chronic infection. Phagocytic activity of AMs 2-and 4-wpi was elevated compared to AMs of naive animals (p = 0.0005, p = 0.0004, respectively) but significantly decreased by 12-wpi (p = 0.0022, p = 0.0019, respectively). By 20-wpi the ability of AMs from chronically infected animals to perform SIV-specific antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) was also diminished (p = 0.028). Acute SIV infection was associated with increased Fc\u03b3RIII expression which subsequently declined with disease progression. Frequency of Fc\u03b3RIII + AMs showed a strong trend toward correlation with SIV-specific ADP, and at 2-wpi Fc\u03b3RIII expression negatively correlated with viral load (r = \u22120.6819; p = 0.0013), suggesting a contribution to viremia control. Importantly, PD-1 was found to be expressed on AMs and showed a strong trend toward correlation with plasma viral load (r = 0.8266; p = 0.058), indicating that similar to over-expression on T-cells, PD-1 expression on AMs may also be associated with disease progression. Further, AMs predominantly expressed PD-L2, which remained consistent over the course of infection. PD-1 blockade enhanced SIV-specific ADP by AMs from chronic infection indicating that the PD-1/PD-L2 pathway may modulate functional activity of AMs at that stage. These findings provide new insight into the dynamics of SIV infection leading to AM dysfunction and alteration of pulmonary innate immunity. Our results suggest new pathways to exploit in developing therapies targeting pulmonary disease susceptibility in HIV-infected individuals.",

Although earlier studies reported that macrophages were the major cell type initially infected by HIV (1), more recent studies have shown that CD4+ T cells are preferentially targeted by HIV/SIV at the site of transmission (2, 3). However, macrophages still serve as targets for the virus in vivo (4) . They can sustain viral replication, disseminate virus, and serve as a viral reservoir post-infection (5) (6) (7) . Cells of the macrophage/monocyte lineage vary greatly in phenotype, longevity, and in phagocytic, immunoregulatory, and secretory properties (8) (9) (10) (11) . Macrophages are categorized as classically (M1) or alternatively (M2) activated based on surface markers and functional role (12, 13) . M1 macrophages mediate inflammatory responses against pathogens while M2 macrophages have anti-inflammatory properties, promoting tissue repair and remodeling (14) . Alveolar macrophages (AM) in the lung uniquely express both M1 and M2 phenotypic markers, indicating ability to quickly respond to pathogens but also prevent immune activation in response to harmless antigens that enter the alveolar lumen (15) .",

Some studies have shown impaired phagocytosis of opportunistic pathogens by AM (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) ; others have reported no change in AM phagocytic activity during infection (27, 28) . Such variations in outcome may result from differences in length of infection or reliance on the use of monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) and infected cell lines which may not ideally represent clinical situations. Macrophages can utilize Fc\u03b3 receptors to internalize antibody-opsonized virions or infected cells, potentially leading to antibody-mediated clearance of infectious material (29) . Antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) by AM contributes to protection against viral infections such as influenza (30) , West Nile (31), adenovirus (32) , and SARS coronavirus (33) .

The AM response to SIV infection consisted of phenotypic changes and alterations in proinflammatory responses, ability to respond to gp120 antigen, and phagocytic activity. Fc\u03b3RIIIb expression on AM was linked to SIV-specific ADP and viral control during acute infection. Novel results showed increased expression of Programmed Cell-Death-1 (PD-1) on AM from chronically infected macaques and positive correlations between PD-1 expressing AMs and SIV viremia. We believe this is the first report of PD-1 expression on AMs of SIV infected macaques. Our results suggest associations between PD-1 expression, macrophage dysfunction, and lack of viremia control.",

However, a clear dynamic of the cytokine and chemokine response by macrophages over the course of HIV/SIV infection has not been shown. Here we characterized cytokine levels in AM collected from SIV infected rhesus macaques between 2 and 20-wpi and compared them to levels in AMs from na\u00efve macaques. A strong proinflammatory response was seen during the acute phase of infection. Expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 in AMs was significantly increased by 2-wpi (p < 0.0001 for all; Figures 2A-C) . By 4-wpi expression levels were significantly lower. Cytokine expression remained low until the 20-wpi time point except for IL-6 expression, which increased significantly by 12-wpi compared to 4-wpi ( Figure 2B) . The IL-6 expression level at 20-wpi was not significantly higher than levels seen in na\u00efve populations. Similarly, a higher level of the chemokine RANTES was found in AMs from macaques at 2-wpi ( Figure 2E) . Expression decreased to levels comparable to na\u00efve samples by 4-wpi and remained low until the 20-wpi time point (Figure 2E ). MIP-1\u03b1 expression did not change over the course of infection ( Figure 2D ). Overall, we observed a transient increase in the proinflammatory cytokine responses, which decreased to levels comparable to those of na\u00efve macaques during the chronic phase of infection. To assess whether AMs were leaning toward an anti-inflammatory role during chronic infection, we evaluated the intracellular expression of IL-10 by AMs ( Figure 2F ). AMs play an important role in maintaining an anti-inflammatory environment in the lung (21, 41) . Indeed, IL-10 expressing AMs were detected in na\u00efve animals and the frequency of IL-10+ cells was significantly higher compared to that of acutely infected animals ( Figure 2F) . Interestingly, the percentage of IL-10 expressing AMs further decreased significantly as infection progressed into the chronic stage ( Figure 2F) . Thus, SIV infection was associated with a significant spike in the AM proinflammatory response by 2-wpi, which waned in chronic infection. In addition, the low proinflammatory cytokine response in chronic infection was not associated with an increase in IL-10-expressing AMs.",

While the BAL samples contained a high percentage of AMs (Figure 1B) , the cells were further enriched for AMs using MACS by depleting CD2, CD20, and EPCAM positive cells ( Figure 4A) . To assess phagocytic capacity independent of SIV antibody, enriched cells were incubated with SIV mac251 gp120-coated fluorescent beads and BAL-F from na\u00efve macaques prior to quantification of bead uptake. A significant increase in phagocytic activity was detected during the acute phase, 2 and 4-wpi (Figure 4B) . At 8-wpi, phagocytosis decreased and was comparable to na\u00efve cells. Activity further decreased significantly at the 12 and 20-wpi time points compared to the acute and na\u00efve time points (Figure 4B ). Prior to evaluating ADP by AMs, we assessed SIV gp120specific IgG in BAL-F ( Figure 4C) . Specific IgG was detected at 8-wpi with levels maintained or continuing to rise until 20-wpi. To determine SIV-specific ADP, AMs from na\u00efve macaques or sampled over the course of SIV infection were incubated with antigen-coated beads along with autologous BAL-F. Phagocytosis scores were normalized against the score obtained using na\u00efve BAL-F to highlight phagocytic activity associated with the presence of SIV-specific antibody ( Figure 4D) . Significantly higher phagocytic scores were detected at 12-wpi compared to those at na\u00efve and 4-wpi time points, indicating that AMs could perform SIV-specific ADP ( Figure 4D) . To further assess ADP by AMs in chronic infection, phagocytic scores at chronic time points (Figure 4D ) were normalized against SIV-specific antibody levels ( Figure 4C) . Results showed that in the presence of comparable antibody levels, AMs mediated ADP activity at 12-wpi. However, this activity was significantly compromised by 20 week PI ( Figure 4E) . Thus, AM are capable of gp120specific ADP for a limited time period during chronic infection. This diminished functional capacity of AMs in the chronic stage further highlights the dysfunction observed upon LPS and gp120 stimulation (Figure 3) .",

            "text": "Three classes of Fc\u03b3R are constitutively expressed on AMs with an active role in protecting against pathogens in the airway: high-affinity Fc\u03b3RI (CD64) and low-affinity Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) and Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16) (42) . Fc\u03b3RIII occurs in two isoforms: Fc\u03b3RIIIa (expressed mainly on NK cells and macrophages) and Fc\u03b3RIIIb (expressed on neutrophils) (43) (44) (45) . Infected MDMs have shown compromised expression of the \u03b3 signaling chain of Fc\u03b3RIIIa, possibly leading to altered phagocytic activity (46) . Monocytes from chronically infected individuals have also shown reduced expression of Fc\u03b3RIIIa and diminished phagocytic activity (47) . However, thus far no correlations have been found between ADP and HIV/SIV viral load, CD4 count or Fc\u03b3R expression. Given the unique features of AMs compared to other tissue macrophages and monocytes, and the importance of phagocytic function in the lung, we investigated whether there was altered Fc\u03b3R expression on AMs over the course of SIV infection and any association with ADP. BAL from naive macaques contained over 80% of Fc\u03b3RI + and Fc\u03b3RII + AMs (Figures 5B,C) . Both the frequencies and MFI of Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RI remained high and unchanged over the course of infection (Figures 5B,C,E,F) . In contrast, the mean frequency of Fc\u03b3RIII + cells was 30% in na\u00efve macaques. At 2-wpi there was a significant increase in Fc\u03b3RIII + AM frequency but levels significantly decreased by 8-wpi (Figure 5A) . The low frequency of Fc\u03b3RIII + AMs was maintained until 20-wpi. A similar increase in AM Fc\u03b3RIII MFI was not observed in the acute phase of infection compared to na\u00efve animals ( Figure 5D ). However, expression levels were significantly reduced at the 8 and 20-wpi time points compared to levels at 2-wpi ( Figure 5D ) in concert with the decreased frequencies observed. The SIV-specific ADP observed at 12-wpi ( Figure 4E ) exhibited a strong trend toward positive correlation with the percentage of Fc\u03b3RIII + AMs at the same time point ( Figure 5G) . Further, the Fc\u03b3RIII MFI at 2-wpi ( Figure 5D ) negatively correlated significantly with acute plasma viral load ( Figure 5H) . These data suggest that Fc\u03b3RIII plays an important role in SIV-specific ADP and that its expression is associated with early viral load control.",

Since the initial description of T cell exhaustion in chronic viral infections (48, 49) , common phenotypic and functional properties have been attributed to a dysfunctional state regardless of the type of pathogen. High and prolonged expression of inhibitory receptors are a key feature of T cell exhaustion in chronic viral infections (50) . In particular, overexpression of the PD-1 receptor on CD8 + T-cells plays a major role in T cell dysfunction associated with HIV infection (51) (52) (53) . Here, we identified PD-1 + AMs in rhesus macaque BAL and assessed changes in its expression on AMs from 6 macaques over the course of SIV infection (Figure 6A) . When the frequency of PD-1 + AMs was assessed in naive macaques and compared to frequencies in SIV infected animals, five out of six SIV + macaques showed an increase in frequency (Figure 6B) . The PD-1 + AM frequency at 20-wpi was significantly different from both na\u00efve and 2-wpi time points: p = 0.0419 and p = 0.0294, respectively. AMs at 20-wpi also displayed a significant increase in PD-1 MFI signifying increased expression of the receptor ( Figure 6C) . Furthermore, the percentage of PD-1 + AMs correlated positively with viral load at 20-wpi ( Figure 6D) . We also observed a strong trend toward correlation between PD-1 MFI and viral load at 20-wpi (Figure 6E) , indicating an association between PD-1 expression in AMs and SIV disease progression.",

While PD-L1 has been shown to be expressed broadly in both hematopoeitic and non-hematopoeitic cells, a more restricted expression pattern has been documented for PD-L2, namely antigen presenting cells (APC) (54) . In order to identify a potential role for the PD-1 pathway on AM function, we looked for expression of these ligands on AMs after SIV infection. AMs from na\u00efve macaques predominantly expressed high levels of PD-L2 (Figure 7B) . This expression decreased modestly, but not significantly, after SIV infection and remained consistent thereafter. On the other hand, we observed minimal expression (\u223c10 fold lower than that of PD-L2) of PD-L1 on AMs from na\u00efve macaques ( Figure 7A) . Further, PD-L1 expression significantly decreased over the course of SIV infection. These results indicate that AM dysfunction is more likely associated with increased PD-1 expression rather than changes in the expression of its ligands and may occur through the PD-1/PD-L2 pathway.",

Interestingly, we found higher phagocytic scores in the PD-1 blockade group in 6 out of the 7 animals (p = 0.0312), indicating that PD-1 expression is likely mechanistically linked to impairment of phagocytic activity (Figure 7C) . We further assessed cytokine expression of PD-1 expressing AMs. We stimulated AMs from chronically infected macaques with 10 \u00b5g/ml LPS and compared cytokine expression between PD-1 + and PD-1 \u2212 populations. Although not significant, we found lower expression of TNF-\u03b1 on PD-1 expressing cells compared to the PD-1 \u2212 population ( Figure 7D) . Comparisons with additional cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and RANTES) are not reported here as expression of these cytokines could not be detected in the AMs from the infected macaques that were tested. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that PD-1 expression on AMs during SIV infection may be a marker of dysfunction.",

The rapid secretion of cytokines and chemokines was expected as the innate immune system initiates lymphocyte recruitment to establish adaptive immunity prior to viral spread. Although the HIV/SIV infection rate of AMs may be low, macrophages respond to exposure to viral particles or virus-derived gene products such as Nef, Tat, and the gp120 envelope (18, 58) . Following the acute phase, the elevated cytokine and chemokine responses by AMs were not sustained despite exposure to viral products and likely LPS from the gut (59) . Further, stimulation with LPS or native gp120 ex vivo showed an impaired IL-6 and MIP-1\u03b2 response of AMs from chronically infected macaques (Figure 3) , indicating a potentially compromised inflammatory response against lung pathogens. This novel observation is consistent with data showing inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 release by macrophages in response to Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 stimulation during HIV infection, even though the expression level of TLR-4 remained unchanged (60) . Desensitization of TLR ligands on AMs as a result of viral respiratory infections has also been reported (61) . The \u03b2-Chemokines MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, and RANTES can bind to the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5 indicating a potential protective effect against entry of R5-tropic viruses (62) (63) (64) (65) . The pattern of chemokine expression here shows that any protective effect of \u03b2-chemokines expressed by AMs is likely limited to the acute phase of infection (Figures 2, 3) .",

Despite reports that AM function is not affected by HIV-1 infection (27, 28) , recent studies have shown that phagocytic activity can be impaired (26, 70) . As viral load and activation status of macrophages can vary over the course of infection, here we tracked the phagocytic activity of AMs following SIV infection, providing new insights into the dynamics of AM function. AMs readily internalized antigen coated beads during acute infection, but this ability markedly decreased in chronically infected animals ( Figure 4B ). The initial phagocytic activity was non-specific, as no gp120-specific antibody was present, and was likely due to the rise in proinflammatory responses during acute infection (Figures 2A-E) . ADP was observed in the chronic stage of infection when gp120specific antibody levels increased in BAL-F (Figures 4C,D) . However, a continued rise in gp120 antibody levels was not associated with increased ADP. In fact, decreased ADP activity was seen later in chronic infection. Therefore, even though the pattern of chemokine expressing AMs over the course of SIV infection (Figures 2A-E) suggested that frequencies returned to naive levels during the chronic phase of infection, the diminished functional activity observed suggested AM dysfunction.",

These data are partly in contrast to data from HIV-infected MDMs that showed either elevated or no change in Fc\u03b3R expression [reviewed in (6) ]. The Fc\u03b3RIII isoform expressed in macrophages (Fc\u03b3RIIIa) consists of a ligand binding\u03b1-chain associated with disulfide-linked \u03b3-chains (71, 72) . The \u03b3 signaling subunit of Fc\u03b3Rs has been shown to be downregulated as a consequence of HIV infection, resulting in aberrant downstream signaling required for phagocytosis (46, 73) . The Fc\u03b3RIII antibody used here recognizes the ligand binding Fc\u03b3RIII \u03b1-chain (74); thus the loss of Fc\u03b3RIII expression cannot be explained by downregulation of the \u03b3-chain alone. Our data suggest that in spite of an initial increase in the frequency of Fc\u03b3RIII + AMs during acute infection (Figure 5A) , prolonged HIV infection may lead to diminished expression of Fc\u03b3RIII.",

PD-1 expression on T cells following immune activation and its role in T-cell exhaustion when highly expressed during HIV-1 and other chronic viral infections have been described (52, 76). Regarding macrophages, PD-1 expression has been linked to diminished ability to clear microbial invasion in septic mice (77) , inhibition of phagocytic activity and tumor immunity (13) , and inability to perform phagocytosis and intracellular killing in patients with tuberculosis (78) . Unlike on T cells, PD-1 expression on macrophages in these studies described a single positive population. Here, we also identified a single PD-1 + population of AMs derived from chronically infected macaques (Figures 6C,D) . The macaques were clear of lung infections at the time of BAL collection, suggesting PD-1 expression was only associated with SIV infection. Until now, no direct evidence has implicated PD-1 in AM dysfunction. Our data show a direct correlation between PD-1 and SIV viremia and suggest that in keeping with correlations described with T cells (53) , disease progression can also be associated with PD-1 expression in AMs ( Figure 6E) .",

This result was unexpected and in contrast to a study on MDMs that showed up-regulation of PD-L1 and PD-L2 after exposure to inactivated HIV virions (79) . However, the alveolar environment is indeed unique and it is unsurprising that AM responses to SIV infection differ from in vitro exposure of MDMs to virions. Rodriguez-Garcia et al. further indicated differential regulation of PD-L1 and PD-L2 by IL-10, whereby presence of IL-10 increased PD-L1 expression and its blockade increased PD-L2 expression (79) . Analysis of IL-10 expression by AMs in our study showed a gradual decrease after SIV infection and may be one explanation as to why we observed decreased PD-L1 expression ( Figure 2C) . PD-L2 expression, however, remained high and did not increase with decreased IL-10 expression. Future analysis of the factors found in BAL-F could provide further insight into the dynamics of PD-L expression on AMs.",

Here, we also found that blockade of PD-1 could significantly improve phagocytic activity further highlighting PD-1 as a factor playing a role in dysfunction of AMs ( Figure 7C ). In addition, although not significant potentially due to small sample size, we found lower abundance of TNF-\u03b1 expressing PD-1 + AMs compared to the PD-1 \u2212 population during chronic infection ( Figure 7D) .
