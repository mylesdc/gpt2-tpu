Based on calculations performed with the geNorm VBA applet, which determines the most stable genes from a set of tested genes in a given cDNA sample, the ranking of the examined genes in adult Atlantic salmon was EF1A B >EF1A A >\u03b2-actin>18S rRNA>S20>GAPDH. When the same calculations were done on a total of 24 individuals from four stages in the smoltification process (presmolt, smolt, smoltified seawater and desmoltified freshwater), the gene ranking was EF1A B >EF1A A >S20>\u03b2-actin>18S rRNA>GAPDH.",

It should also be expressed at roughly the same level as the RNA under study [1] . However, data normalization in real-time RT-PCR remains a real problem, especially for absolute quantification [1] . Numerous studies have revealed that no single universal gene has a constant expression level under all developmental or experimental situations. The best choice of reference gene to use as an endogenous control varies, depending on the tissues of interest in the experiment. A large number of genes have for this reason been selected for normalization of mRNA expression data [2, 3] . If the selected reference gene fluctuates randomly between samples, small differences in expression between the genes of interest will be missed. Gene expression coefficient of variation (CV) between different groups of individuals should ideally be as low as possible [4] . In general, the stability of several potential reference genes should be tested in every examined tissue or cell, and under different experimental design [5, 6] . An increasing number of papers are discussing the selection of reference genes in real-time RT-PCR analyses [3, 7] .",

            "text": "Two of the most commonly used reference genes are those encoding glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and \u03b2-actin. Recently, the use of these two genes as endogenous controls has been scrutinized, and several studies have documented that the GAPDH and \u03b2-actin genes should be used with caution as controls [2, 8, 9] . GAPDH in mammals is known to play a role in a broad range of cellular mechanisms (for review see Sirover [10] ), including being a key enzyme in glycolysis. Overall, GAPDH mRNA levels might be regulated under a large number of physiological states, and its use as a reference is inappropriate for most experimental conditions. Actin is a major component of the protein scaffold that supports the cell and determines its shape, and is the most abundant intracellular protein in eukaryotic cells. Even though commonly used as a reference, the application of the \u03b2-actin gene has recently been characterized as a historical carryover from northern blots and conventional RT-PCR (for a general discussion on the use of 'classic' reference genes like GAPDH and \u03b2-actin, see Huggett et al. [7] ). Eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A, formerly elongation factor 1 alpha) plays an important role in translation by catalyzing GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site of the ribosome. However, the protein is involved in a broad diversity of functions and constitutes 1-3% of the total cytoplasmic protein content of the cell. In human, cDNAs of two actively transcribed isoforms have been cloned (eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2) (for review see Thornton et al. [11] ). Two paralog EF1A genes (A and B) have recently been applied as references in real-time qRT-PCR of Atlantic salmon [12] . It is plausible to assume that the presence of these highly similar genes is a result of a tetraploidization event that occurred in a salmonid ancestor in the comparatively recent past [13, 14] .",

We used the geNorm software which determines the individual stability of a gene within a pool of genes [5] . The stability is calculated according to the similarity of their expression profile by a pair-wise comparison, using their geometric mean as a normalizing factor. The gene with the highest M, i.e. the least stable gene, is then suggested excluded in a stepwise fashion until the most stable genes are determined, and an index suggested, based on the best genes. geNorm has been used to select the most stable reference genes in several recent studies (e.g. [4, 17, 18] ).",

Salmonid fish are among the most widely studied model fish species in general, and extensive basic information on many different aspects of their biology has been collected [19] . Large-scale DNA-sequencing projects on salmon have been initiated in several laboratories http://www.sal mongenome.no/cgi-bin/sgp.cgi; http://web.uvic.ca/cbr/ grasp/; http://www.abdn.ac.uk/sfirc/salmon/; http:// www.bcgsc.ca/gc/salmon. In this work we selected the two 'classic' reference genes encoding GAPDH and \u03b2-actin, two genes encoding 18S rRNA and S20 ribosomal protein and two paralog genes encoding elongation factor 1A (EF1A A and EF1A B ). To evaluate their usefulness as reference genes, RNA from eight tissues of six adult salmon were subjected to real time PCR. The relative transcription levels of the genes were also estimated in four phases of young salmon going through smoltification, in order to check their stabilities under physiological stressful conditions.",

Not surprisingly, the GAPDH gene was ranked worse in five tissues (liver, head kidney, spleen, brain and thymus), confirming the general skepticism against the use of this gene as reference [7, 16, 20] .

            "text": "To be able to evaluate gene stability under stressful conditions, mRNA expression of the selected genes was examined in gills of salmon going through smoltification. Prior to seawater entry, juvenile anadromous salmon undergo a parr-smolt transformation, characterized by behavioral, morphological and physiological changes, known to be challenging for the fish. Physiological alterations include increased seawater tolerance, olfactory sensitivity, metabolic rate, scope for growth and changed hemoglobin and visual pigments [21] . We selected to examine the gills during smoltification, because this tissue plays a major role in ionic and osmotic regulation during adaptation to hyperosmotic seawater. Figure 1 shows the raw Ct values of the studied genes in gills before, during and after smoltification (smoltified in seawater and desmoltified in freshwater). In Figure 2 the same data are presented, but now normalized against an index calculated by geNorm of the three most stable genes (\u03b2-actin, EF1A A and EF1A B ). Based on the M values, geNorm ranks the stability of the six genes from 24 fish going through smoltification in the following order: EF1A B >EF1A A >\u03b2-actin>S20>18S rRNA>GAPDH ( Figure 3 ). In Figure 1 it can be seen that the 18S gene had the lowest individual raw Ct variation. Most individual raw Ct variation of the studied genes is seen in the presmolt and smolt groups. A characteristic drop in expression can be seen for all genes in the smolt group, compared to the presmolt group. After transfer to seawater, the individual raw Ct variation decreased for all genes. Overall, the raw Ct data suggest that the physiological challenging smoltification process affected the expression of all six genes. When the same data were normalized against an index of the three most stable genes, \u03b2-actin, EF1A A and EF1A B , the relative expression levels were altered for all genes. Now the ribosomal 18S gene emerges as the second worse, whereas the two paralog EF1A genes became the most stable. This might have to do with the fact that geNorm will top-rank co-expressed genes [22] , a weakness that has to be considered when evaluating paralog genes likely to be co-regulated. Even though the eEF1A-2 gene has been identified as an important oncogene and has been shown to be differently expressed in human tissues [11] , Hamalainen et al. [23] found the eEF1A-1 gene to be a good reference gene in real-time RT-PCR examinations. A similar finding was reported by Frost and Nilsen [24] in salmon louse, where they showed that the eEF1A and S20 genes were valid candidate references, whereas the 18S rRNA and GAPDH genes were unsuitable. The current findings based on geNorm evaluation question the recommended application of ribosomal genes as references (as suggested for example by Ambion (see reference [15] ), and are in line with earlier warnings against the use of rRNA genes as references [5, 6] . To avoid the normalization of the genes for \u03b2-actin, EF1A A and EF1A B against an index partly based on their own expression, the S20 gene was included in the index instead, and the mean normalized expression for these three genes calculated with the new index. The patterns of expression, however, were approximately the same for the three genes as seen in Figure 2 , suggesting that the gene-stability measure M can be used to find the most appropriate reference genes.",

We have seen that the A260/230 ratios are quite low in samples that give inadequate PCR efficiency slopes, especially with RNA from head kidney, thymus and intestine tissues, in which the gradient of the standard curve is less than -3.3 ( Table 2 ).

These individuals were not separated based on sex, size or sampling time, but treated as one heterogeneous group to examine the width of mRNA expression of the studied genes in eight different organs. This group of fish was handled and fed according to normal aquacultural management, and none of these individuals were exposed to any particular treatment. To examine if physiological stress may alter the gene expression in the gills, a total of 24 individuals were collected before (termed presmolt, 18.3 \u00b1 0.9 g), during (termed smolt, 28.7 \u00b1 3.7 g) and after smoltification. After smoltification, one group was kept and desmoltified in freshwater (termed desmolt FW, 30.0 \u00b1 3.8 g), while the other group was transferred to seawater (termed smoltified SW, 30.2 \u00b1 4.3 g) (n = 6 in each group). The Atlantic salmon examined during smoltification were from the anadromous population \"Vosso\" of the river Vosso in Southwestern Norway (see Nilsen et al. [27] for details on how these fish were treated). All fish were treated and euthanized according to Norwegian national legislation for laboratory animals.",

The primers amplify PCR products between 57-98 basepairs (bp) long, which is within the range of 50-150 bp as suggested by Applied Biosystems for their Taq-Man assays. qPCR assays were designed using Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to select appropriate primer and probe sequences from known Atlantic salmon genes. The mRNA sequences encoding S20 ribosomal protein and GAPDH were obtained from GenBank accession numbers BG936672 and BU693999, respectively (exon-exon borders were not considered).

For 18S rRNA the PCR primers and probe were designed from the Atlantic salmon sequence AJ427629, and placed in a conserved region of the gene based on comparison with the human gene. RNA samples were subjected to DNase treatment to avoid genomic DNA contamination. Amplified PCR products of all actual cDNAs were sequenced to ensure that the correct mRNA sequences were quantified.

Input total RNA concentration was 500 ng in each reaction. All 24 samples for each gene were run on the same plate together with six serial dilutions. The final concentration of the other chemicals in each RT reaction was: MgCl 2 (5.5 \u00b5M), dNTP (500 \u00b5M of each), 10\u00d7 TaqMan RT buffer (1\u00d7), RNase inhibitor (0.4 U/\u00b5l) and Multiscribe Reverse Transcriptase (1.67 U/\u00b5l).2.5 \u00b5l of 10-fold diluted cDNA for \u03b2-actin, GAPDH, EF1A A and EF1A B , and 1000-fold diluted cDNA for 18S rRNA and S20 ribosomal protein from each RT reaction was transferred to a new 96-well reaction plate, and the realtime PCR run on the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System from AB. Real-time PCR was performed by using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, which contains Ampl-iTaq Gold \u00ae DNA polymerase, and gene specific primers (900 nM). Fluorescence marked TaqMan MGB probes (200 nM) were used for data collection during the log linear phase of the reaction. PCR was achieved with a 10 min activation and denaturation step at 95\u00b0C, followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 60 s at 60\u00b0C.
