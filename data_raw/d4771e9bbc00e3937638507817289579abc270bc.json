After establishing the maximum non-cytotoxic concentration of BTE, A549 and Vero cells and HSV-1 virions were treated with varying concentrations of BTE, respectively. A549 and Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 with green fluorescent protein (GFP) insert at the UL46 gene. The effect of infectivity was determined by viral DNA extraction followed by PCR, plaque assays, adsorption assays, and electrophoresis of PCR products. Results: BTE was not cytotoxic to A549 and Vero cells, as confirmed by cell viability and proliferation assays, in which BTE treated groups paralleled the positive control group. For both cell lines, plaque assays and fluorescent microscopy indicated an inverse relationship between BTE concentration (from 0.14 \u03bcM -1.4 mM) and HSV-1 infectivity. Specifically, PCR and electrophoresis showed a reduction in the viral genome following treatment with BTE. In addition, there was a noticeable decrease in the amount of viral plaques for BTE treated samples in the adsorption assays. Conclusions: BTE consisting primarily of theaflavins is not cytotoxic and can reduce or block the production of infectious HSV-1 virions in cultured A549 and Vero cells, thus inhibiting the infectivity of the virus by interfering in the attachment, penetration and viral DNA replication of HSV-1 particles. These findings indicate that BTE enriched with theaflavins has the potential to be developed as a safe, therapeutic antiviral agent to prevent the spread of HSV-1.",

Both attachment and penetration take place when viral glycoproteins bind to suitable receptors on the plasma membrane of the host cell. The presence of the receptors determines the tropism of HSV-1 and places a limit on the types of cells to which it is capable of attaching, and thus, infecting [3] [4] [5] . Green, oolong, and black teas are produced from the same plant, Camellia sinensis. While the main type of flavanol in green tea extract is the catechin, that in BTE is the theaflavin, a dimer of different catechins, which includes: theaflavin (TF-1), theaflavin-3-monogallate (TF-2A), theaflavin-3'monogallate (TF-2B) and theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (TF-3) [6, 7] . Since green tea is not fermented, it contains a relatively high amount of catechins as compared to black tea; fermentation causes the catechins to polymerize, which produces the theaflavins and thearubigens found in black tea, but absent in green tea [6] .",

Additionally, it has been found that theaflavins are capable of inhibiting certain types of cancer [10] , as well as inhibiting viruses, including bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus [11] , HIV-1 [12, 13] , and three different subtypes of influenza strains [14] .",

Since theaflavins in BTE are composed of a dimer structure formed from catechin monomers found in green tea, which have been found to inhibit HSV-1 [15] , it is reasonable to infer that theaflavins in BTE may also produce similar results based on structural similarities. Despite the fact that theaflavin molecules are larger than catechins, larger polyphenolic compounds such as tannins have been shown to inhibit other viruses [16, 17] , indicating that the size of the molecule may not necessarily be a factor required for viral inhibition. Rather, the large amount of hydroxyl groups on these polyphenolic compounds seem to be the one common structural component among these various, natural viral inhibitors; thus, BTE, with high concentrations of theaflavins, may be an effective inhibitor of HSV-1.",

Theaflavins, polyphenols found mainly in black teas, are natural antioxidants and viral inhibitors. As such, black tea extracts may be useful in future pharmaceutical developments [20] . One concern for human health is HSV-1. Infections caused by this herpesvirus are estimated to affect anywhere from 45% -98% of the world population, and up to 40% of these infected individuals are subject to recurrent outbreaks that most often result in infectious lesions and ulcerations of the skin. While treatments, such as the drug acyclovir, are in use today, most rely on the presence of a viral protein, thymidine kinase, to inhibit A B C D Figure 6 Viral titer determination using plaque assays. A. Plaque reduction assay results showing (from left to right wells): A549 cells exposed to media only, A549 cells exposed to HSV-1 and media and A549 cells exposed to HSV-1 and BTE. A549 cells were exposed to HSV-1 before being treated with BTE. B. Virus adsorption assay results showing (from left to right wells): A549 cells exposed to media only, A549 cells exposed to HSV-1 and media and A549 cells exposed to HSV-1 and BTE. A549 cells were exposed to HSV-1 treated with BTE. C. Virus attachment assay results showing (from left to right wells): A549 cells exposed to media only, A549 cells exposed to HSV-1 and media and A549 cells exposed to HSV-1 and BTE. A549 cells were treated with BTE before being exposed to HSV-1. D. Virus penetration assay results showing (from left to right wells): A549 cells exposed to media only, A549 cells exposed to HSV-1 and media and A549 cells exposed to HSV-1 and BTE. A549 cells were exposed to HSV-1 to allow attachment, but not penetration; cells were subsequently treated with BTE, then the virus was allowed to penetrate the cells. viral replication; mutant viral strains lacking this enzyme are still infectious but do not respond to the available medications. In addition, current treatments can have detrimental side effects and often require frequent doses that can be expensive [16, 21, 22] . Thus, alternative, lower cost treatments to HSV-1 infections are necessary to alleviate the symptoms of infected individuals. Black tea extracts have previously been found to block the production of free radicals and inhibit the growth of cancerous cells, as well as exhibit cytotoxic effects against immortalized cells [23] . The purpose of this study was to assess the antiviral qualities of a black tea extract and determine its lowest inhibitory concentration against HSV-1. This hypothesis stems from the findings that black tea compounds have been shown to inhibit some viruses [11] [12] [13] [14] . In addition, a green tea catechin, EGCG, has already been shown to inhibit HSV-1 [15, 24] ; it is suggested that this compound binds to glycoproteins on the envelope of the virus, thereby preventing viral entry into the host cell [24] . Since black tea theaflavins are merely polymers of green tea catechins [6] , it is possible that the former may also inhibit HSV-1, though through a different mechanism. In addition, the flavanols in black tea may be more stable than those in green tea. Although the stability of green tea catechins is pH dependent, EGCG and EGC were less stable than EC and ECG, regardless of pH [25] . Theaflavins, however, were reported to be more stable at pH 7 than EGC and EGCG [26] . The increased stability of theaflavins at neutral pH could make these black tea compounds a more feasible option for the design of an antiviral therapeutic agent than EGCG.",

Phase contrast microscopy and plaque assays demonstrated that BTE significantly inhibited the infectious cycle of HSV-1, consistent with findings of previous studies [11] [12] [13] [14] . These experiments demonstrated that noncytotoxic concentrations of BTE can effectively inhibit the infectious cycle of HSV-1 in cultured cells. Similarly, treatment with BTE for one hour significantly reduced viral titers but did not inactivate the virions. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that treatment of HSV-1 virions with higher concentrations of BTE interfered with the infectious cycle of the virus in cultured A549 and Vero cells. Specifically, PCR and gel electrophoresis indicated that higher concentrations of viral DNA are produced in untreated HSV-1 infections, as compared to lower viral DNA concentrations from BTE-treated HSV-1. Also, a direct relationship between the increased BTE concentration and reduced intensity of samples containing viral GFP suggests that there is a significant reduction in viral genome replication in BTE-treated HSV-1 infected A549 and Vero cell cultures. Additional plaque assays indicated that both the attachment and penetration processes of HSV-1 adsorption in A549 cells and Vero cells are inhibited by BTE concentrations of 1.4 mM and 14 \u03bcM. Experimental results taken a whole indicate that BTE at non-cytotoxic concentrations can inhibit viral propagation by limiting the viral processes of replication and adsorption.",

Our results indicate that the virus is not inactivated following 1 h treatment with BTE; therefore, the action of TF-3 alone may not explain the efficacy of BTE. Treatment with 1.4 mM BTE caused a reduction in the amount of HSV-1 genome synthesized 12 h after infection at this concentration and a lower viral count. BTE has been reported to lack cytotoxic effects on cultured cells, consistent with our findings [10] . Therefore, BTE concentrations up to 1.4 mM can be used to treat cells infected by HSV-1 and study its inhibitory effects. Data presented here indicate that BTE can be safely applied to cells at the concentrations tested. The lower cost of BTE, as compared to pure theaflavins, make it attractive for consideration as a safe and effective as an antiviral agent.",
