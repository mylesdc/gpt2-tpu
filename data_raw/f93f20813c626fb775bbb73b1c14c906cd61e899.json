Two NmAbs, P4B-1, and E10E-1-10 that recognized the ectodomain of the full-length recombinant PEDV S protein and exhibited neutralizing ability against the PEDV-PT virus were selected. Recombinant truncated S proteins were used to identify the target sequences for the NmAbs and P4B-1 was shown to recognize the C-terminus of CO-26K equivalent epitope (COE) at amino acids (a.a.) 575-639 of the PEDV S. Interestingly, E10E-1-10 could recognize a novel neutralizing epitope at a.a. 435-485 within the S1 A domain of the PEDV S protein, whose importance and function are yet to be determined. Moreover, both NmAbs could not bind to linearized S proteins, indicating that only conformational epitopes are recognized. This data could improve our understanding of the antigenic structures of the PEDV S protein and facilitate future development of novel epitope-based vaccines.",

In 2010, novel and highly virulent PEDV strains were identified in China, which later spread to several countries 1,5,6 . These new variants of PEDV have caused high morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in serious economic loss to the swine industry 1,7 .

The S1 B domain is a common location for receptor binding in coronaviruses and can be a potential neutralizing target for the new PEDV variant capable of eliciting the production of cross-neutralizing antibodies against different PEDV strains 17 . Furthermore, several linear B-cell epitopes of PEDV overlapping with S1D have been shown to neutralize both the historic strain as well as the new variant PEDV strains 18 .

As summarized in Table 1 , the two NmAbs, P4B-1 and E10E-1-10 and the non-neutralizing mAb, R7H-2, all exhibited the ability to recognize full-length PEDV spike-expressing HEK293 cells but were unable to recognize PEDV S 1-435 -expressing HEK293 cells in ICC staining. More precisely, P4B-1 recognized PEDV S 1-639 expressing HEK293 cells but did not recognize the HEK293 cells expressing S 1-575 , S 1-509 , S 1-501 , S 1-485 , S 1-435 of PEDV-PT (Fig. 3) . In other words, P4B-1 was unable to bind to the amino acids upstream of a.a. 575 of the spike protein of PEDV-PT. Therefore, the targeting epitope of P4B-1 must be located between a.a. 575-639 on the PEDV spike protein. Surprisingly, E10E-1-10 exhibited good binding affinity for HEK293 cells expressing PEDV proteins S 1-639 , S 1-575 , S 1-509 , S 1-501 , and S 1-485 , but with reduced binding affinity for the PEDV S 1-435 . This evidence obtained from the ICC staining confirmed this NmAb recognizing the novel epitope present within the 435-485 a.a. region of PEDV-PT spike protein (Fig. 3) . In contrast, the non-neutralizing mAb, R7H-2, that recognized only the full-length PEDV spike-expressing HEK293 cells, was unable to bind to the PEDV spike protein upstream of a.a. 639 (Fig. 3) . These results suggest that the targeting epitope of R7H-2 is downstream of a.a. 639 of the PEDV spike protein.",

Although several sequences of the new variant PEDV spike genes have been decoded 6, 21 and multiple domain architectures of the PEDV S protein have been predicted by three-dimensional structures of alphacoronaviruses 16 , the effects of genetic mutations on the antigenicity of PEDV remains poorly understood. A thorough evaluation of the neutralizing epitopes and antigenicity of the new PEDV variants is therefore needed. In the present study, we generated a panel of mAbs using PEDV-PT viral particles. By selecting mAbs that exhibited high binding affinity to full-length spike ectodomain-expressing HEK293 cells, we successfully identified two representative NmAb against PEDV-PT. The targeting epitopes identified by these two NmAbs were located at a.a. 575-639 and a.a. 435-485 of the PEDV spike protein, respectively, as shown by ICC staining and ELISA. Further, none of these NmAbs were able to bind to the linearized forms of The recombinant ectodomain of S protein of PEDV-PT strain was modelled using SWISS model and edited using UCSF ChimeraX. The S protein was present as monomer and the S1 and S2 regions of PEDV were displayed in light-blue and grey, respectively. The conformational neutralizing epitope regions characterized by the mAbs are given as follows: (a) E10E-1-10 mAb labelled in yellow; two mutations (V 441 I and S 477 A) on the epitope different from the CV777 strain were highlighted in red sphere and one mutation (E 459 Q) on the epitope different from the Taiwan historic PEDV strain (HC070225-S) was highlighted in green sphere.

In case of the new variants of PEDV, the domain B (a.a. 510-640 in the PEDV GDU and the PEDV-PT strain) and domain 0 in the S1 region (a.a. 1-219 in the PEDV GDU and the PEDV-PT strain) are demonstrated to have neutralizing epitopes 17 . Furthermore, Okda et al. also discovered several linear epitopes at the N-terminus of S2 18 . Previously, the identification of neutralizing epitopes of the historic PEDVs led to the proposal that several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), such as three serine amino acid substitutions in the COE epitope and two serine amino acid substitutions in the S1D epitope, may be related to newly-occurring global outbreaks 6, 22 . In the present study, the NmAb, P4B-1, was able to recognize the epitope within a.a. 575-639 on the S protein, which overlaps with the C-terminus of the COE epitope, echoing the findings of previous studies 12 . As the S1 B domain consists of the main COE neutralizing epitope of PEDV and is the receptor binding domain for the majority of the coronaviruses, its importance has been emphasized in many studies 11, 23, 24 . Li et al. have demonstrated that the binding affinity of neutralizing antibodies could be dramatically altered by exchanging one amino acid on the S protein of PEDV 17 . Hence, mutations in S1 B domain, especially in neutralizing epitopes of the PEDV S protein, are speculated to represent the evolution of viral escape from antibodies, like the one evoked by CV777-based vaccine immunization of a historic PEDV strain infection 4, 25 . Interestingly, the other NmAb, E10E-1-10, presented a high binding affinity toward a.a. 435-485 of the S protein that precludes the COE epitope and locates in the S1 A domain has also been identified in our study. To our knowledge, the function of the S1 A domain of the PEDV S protein has not been well studied. The S1 A domain of human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 is speculated to interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the host cells to mediate the virus anchoring and infection 26 . The N-terminus of S1 A domain of bovine coronavirus has been shown to have two sugar binding loops which can recognize the carbohydrate receptor on the host cells 27 . Moreover, heparan sulfate has also been demonstrated as an attachment factor for PEDV 28 . However, as the actual topography of the PEDV trimeric S protein remains to be solved and the function of S1 A domain is yet to be determined, the actual interaction of the S1 A domain targeting mAb with these sugars or the heparan sulfate proteoglycans-binding domains on the PEDV S glycoprotein remains to be further evaluated. Visualization of the topology and interaction of PEDV S glycoprotein with these neutralizing antibodies for guiding future immunogen and therapeutics design is an important future goal.",

            "text": "Epitopes for antibody recognition can generally be divided into two main classes: linear and conformational forms. Linear epitopes are formed by a continuous sequence of amino acid in a protein, while conformational epitopes consist of amino acid sequences that are discontinuous in the protein but are brought together upon three-dimensional protein folding. It has been demonstrated that 90% of B cell-recognizing epitopes are conformational epitopes that result from the antigen internalizing process and special antigen-recognizing ability 29, 30 . Many conformational epitope-targeting antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies, are particularly difficult to determine because the antibody-antigen complex is formed solely in the native structure of the protein. Over the past several decades, with the use of phage-display peptide probing, the neutralizing epitope of CV777, named 2C10 has been identified 13 . Using ELISA or Pepscan assays, several linear neutralizing epitopes have been discovered on the S2 glycoprotein subunit of new PEDV variants 18 . Additionally, two B cell epitopes, named SS2 and SS6, in the region of the S1D neutralizing epitope were evaluated using a combination of phage-display peptide probing and Pepscan 14, 15 . However, these epitope mapping approaches focus mainly on linear epitopes 31 . Using ICC staining, ELISA, and denatured immunodot blotting, all of the B cell-recognizing epitopes identified in the present study were found to be conformational epitopes. Thus, these affinity-binding assays could serve as valuable platforms for studying the conformational epitopes of NmAbs. In conclusion, the NmAbs and various truncated S proteins constructed generated in the present study could contribute to a better understanding of the antigenicity and immunogenicity of highly virulent PEDVs, especially in revealing the antigenic role of S1 A domain, and the pathogenesis of immune escape that leads to an outbreak of PEDV. Moreover, our study may provide important fundamental information for the future development of novel epitope-based vaccines. ",
