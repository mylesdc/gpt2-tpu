Fairness in limit setting for admission to the intensive care unit can be evaluated using \"Accountability for Reasonableness\" (A4R). In the A4R framework, a fair process supplements moral deliberation based on substantive criteria and moral principles to guide resource allocation [3] . Priority setting in health care institutions is considered fair and legitimate if it satisfies four conditions (Table 1) . When A4R was used to evaluate fairness of priority setting in two previous studies of intensive care units, deficiencies in the publicity and appeals conditions were observed [4] . The role of communication in the process of limit setting and its relationship with the publicity condition was highlighted in both studies, however a commentator noted \"an incomplete picture of the chain of evidence\" leading to the conclusion that there should be greater transparency to improve fairness [5] .",

End-user physicians (neurosurgeons, operating room surgeons and anesthesiologists), the critical care unit resource nurse, and the most entitled service (trauma program) all identified circumstances in which they might make independent bed allocation decisions. This may explain why some end-user physicians experienced frustration in their attempts to access critical care unit resources. While official accountability for bed allocation decisions rested with the critical care physician, \"parallel track\" decision makers could allocate beds without this participant's knowledge. Previous investigators have demonstrated that parallel track decision makers may view the critical care unit physician as responsible for making decisions about the appropriateness of discharges, but may not consult with them about decisions to admit patients [10] . This exclusion from the decision making process may cause the official gatekeeper to be unable to explain why beds are not available in the critical care unit at a given time. When ICU beds are readily available, decision makers find it difficult to deny patient access to a bed-the \" non triage mode\". When there is a high census or full occupancy, decision makers must prioritize admissions to the ICU-\"triage mode\". Involvement of the ICU physician in triage mode involves reviewing and prioritizing proposed admissions and decision making about discharges of patients who can safely be discharged or transferred. Review of patients who are not responding or benefiting from continuing intensive care also occurs [11] . \"Parallel-track\" decisionmaking resulting in ICU bed allocation occurred in both modes in our case study. When ICU beds are readily available, parallel -track decision makers such as the resource nurse, clinical fellow or end user physicians might reasonably make bed allocation decisions based on ICU admission criteria, improving the responsiveness and flexibility of the resource. However, the importance of direct communication between parallel -track decision makers and the critical care physician -gatekeeper is not diminished because admissions in the \"non -triage\" mode increase the probability the unit will later enter \" triage\" mode conditions. Affected parties left \"out of the loop\"",

Until recently, very little has been known about communication in this milieu. Mielke et al found that ICU physicians communicated their bed allocation decisions and the reasons for them primarily to end user (referring) physicians. However, we found that communication of bed allocation decisions in our critical care unit was sometimes conducted through intermediaries, such as fellows, residents or receptionists. The effectiveness of communication conducted in this way, especially in regard to families is limited because family members often feel they have not been given enough time and require extra explanations if spoken to by junior physicians such as residents [12] . We observed that reasons for denial of an ICU bed were not directly communicated directly to families, who might learn of the decision from the referring service, as did those in Mielke's case study. Communication failures (\"botch ups\") were deemed the root cause of conflicts and appeals of decisions [4] . Bernstein et al also found that decisions and rationales were disseminated within the ICU and to end-users but not to patients, families or the public [10] . Families of critically ill patients may experience inadequate communication in close to half of their meetings with physicians, when these do occur. While there are many possible reasons, including the impact of anxiety and depression on family members' capacity to understand complex information about their loved one [13] , physician related factors, such as meetings of short duration are also highlighted [14] . Even when surgical intensive care unit doctors do have meetings, they dominate the dialogue and utter more words per conversational turn than family members [15] . Within the critical care unit, the environment is noisy [16] and there are frequent disruptions by simultaneous events, which present problems not only for patients but also for researchers [17] . Our findings strengthen a chain of evidence showing how the publicity and appeals conditions of the leading fair process framework (accountability for reasonableness) may break down in critical care units [5] . They support recommendations that the publicity and appeals conditions can be improved by direct explanations of the reasons for admission to the intensive care unit and improved opportunities for debate about the appropriateness of bed allocation decisions.",

While this sampling method is systematic and non probabilistic, it identified initial participants comparable to those chose in previous investigations [4, 10] . Although none of the participants we interviewed suggested that administrators should be included in the sample, their absence from our investigation limits our description because of the impor-tant mediation role some of them (such as the Medical Director on Call) played. We tried to ensure the validity of our analysis by giving interviewees transcripts of the analysis as it developed, but we did not do this systematically due to restrictions on health worker communication during the Toronto SARS epidemic [18] . Although this decreases the validity of our results, they are nonetheless congruent with other investigations in critical care units in ways we have already discussed. We continued to collect data until content \"saturation\" was encountered, but we did not interview family members of critically ill patients. This deliberate exclusion was felt to be justifiable because we were interested in how communication occurred between those who were officially responsible for decisions resulting in bed allocation in the critical care unit. However, the exclusion is unfortunate because it can be argued that family members represent an additional category of parallel track decision makers. For example, when disagreement over the appropriateness of life sustaining therapy occurs, our institutional policy mandates full treatment pending the outcome of a conflict resolution process. In effect this means that demands for critical care (even when judged medically inappropriate) from family members must be satisfied, even if for a short time by the allocation of a bed for the patient. Finally, our research setting in an urban, university affiliated teaching hospital may restrict the generalization of our results; communication in non-university teaching hospital contexts may involve participants who interact differently from those we observed.",
