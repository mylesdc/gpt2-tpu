            "text": "Clara cells are non-ciliated, secretory bronchiolar epithelial cells that serve to detoxify harmful inhaled substances. Clara cells also function as stem/progenitor cells for repair in the bronchioles. Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) is specifically expressed in pulmonary Clara cells and is widely used as a Clara cell marker. In addition CCSP promoter is commonly used to direct gene expression into the lung in transgenic models. The discovery of CCSP immunoreactivity in plasma membranes of airway lining cells prompted us to explore the possibility of enriching Clara cells by flow cytometry. We established a novel and simple method for the isolation of CCSP-expressing cell Clara cells using a combination of mechanical and enzymatic dissociation followed by flow cytometry sorting technology. We showed that ,25% of dissociated cells from whole lung expressed CCSP. In the resulting preparation, up to 98% of cells expressed CCSP. Notably, we found that several common stem cell markers including CD44, CD133, Sca-1 and Sox2 were expressed in CCSP + cells. Moreover, CCSP + cells were able to form spheroid colonies in vitro with 0.97% efficiency. Parallel studies in vivo confirmed that a small population of CCSP 2 expressing cells in mouse airways also demonstrates stem cell-like properties such as label retention and harboring rare bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) in terminal bronchioles (TBs). We conclude that CCSP + cells exhibit a number of stem cell-like features including stem cell marker expression, bronchosphere colony formation and self-renewal ability. Clara cell isolation by flow cytometry sorting is a useful method for investigating the function of primary Clara cells in stem cell research and mouse models.",

Proximal airways are lined by a pseudostratified epithelium with a number of cell types with important protective functions such as ciliated cells, goblet cells, and basal cells. More distally, the lining is a simplified columnar epithelium largely made up of non-ciliated secretory cells called Clara cells, and a few ciliated and basal cells. [1, 2] . Further down, the respiratory bronchioles are lined by cuboidal epithelium comprised entirely of ciliated and Clara cells, whereas, the epithelium of the alveolar compartment is comprised of type I and type II cells. In mouse, the pseudostratified epithelium is limited to trachea and extrapulmonary main bronchi while Clara cells make up over 80% of the epithelium, with few interspersed ciliated cells, that line intrapulmonary conducting airways [3] . These features make mouse an excellent tool for studying the functions of Clara cells.",

            "text": "Clara cells have several protective properties. They detoxify xenobiotics and oxidant gasses, control inflammation, participate in mucociliary clearance of environmental agents, and proliferate/ differentiate to maintain the ciliated and non-ciliated cell population. Clara cells are a source of cytochrome P450 enzymes that contribute to the metabolism of a variety of substances [4] . In addition to the major Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP), also known as CC10, CC16, Clara cell antigen, secretoglobin 1A1 (SCGB1A1) or uteroglobin, Clara cells also contribute surfactant apoproteins A, B and D, proteases, anti-microbial peptides, several cytokines and chemokines, and mucins in the extracellular fluid lining airspaces. CCSP is the most abundant secretory protein found in the airway surface fluid, expressed exclusively in nonciliated Clara cells and widely used as a marker of the cells [5, 6, 7, 8] .Changes in CCSP levels have a profound impact on not only the composition of airway surface fluid but also the airway epithelial response to environmental stimuli [9, 10] . Another important property of Clara cells is their ability to serve as progenitors for airway lining cells in response to injury. Moreover, subpopulations of CCSP-expressing cells may function as true stem cells of adult airways. Presently it is not known whether the groups overlap or represent distinct cells such as variant Clara cells [11] , type A cells [12] , OCT4-expressing stem cells [13] and bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) [14] .",

The major disadvantage of such approaches is the difficulty in performing mechanistic studies in non-neoplastic primary cells. Recently, Wong et al. developed a method for isolating CCSP + cells from bone marrow by flow cytometry sorting [15] . We speculated that this method may also be used to isolate CCSP + (Clara) cells from the lung. In this study we established a simple method for the isolation of CCSP + cells from mouse lung and applied several different means to identify stem cell-like characteristics of CCSP + cell in vitro and in vivo. We propose that this new procedure method for CCSP + cell isolation provides a useful instrument for Clara cell research, for instance in the field of stem cell biology.",

Therefore, we postulated that CCSP may be expressed not only in the cytoplasm, but also in the cell membrane of Clara cells. To obtain evidence for this, we used the well-known cell membrane marker pan-Cadherin [18] . Indeed, in high magnification photomicrographs we were able to demonstrate co-expression with pan-Cadherin in the cell membrane using confocal microscope ( Figure 2B) .

Our results showed that 1.1% of TB epithelial cells contained BASCs while no CCSP + /pro-SPC + double positive epitheliums were detected in BLs ( Figure 6 ).

            "text": "Based on previous publications, the distribution of CCSP expression in non-ciliated Clara cells is described as cytoplasmic [23, 24, 25] . We made the surprising and novel discovery of CCSP immunoreactivity along cellular membranes of bronchiolar Clara cells. Using pan-cadherin as a cell membrane marker in normal airway epithelium [18, 26, 27] we found CCSP was expressed not only in the cytoplasm, but also in the membrane. These findings gave rise to the possibility that living Clara cells can be isolated by flow cytometry using fluorescing tags. Our successful CCSP + cell sorting further confirmed the distribution of CCSP membranous expression. One explanation is that bronchiolar Clara cells secrete such large quantities of CCSP that part of it remains stuck to the outer surfaces of cell membranes, allowing sorting of CCSPcontaining cells from suspension. Clara cell isolation from rabbit was first reported in the early 1980s by Devereux et al. [28] . After that, several groups were able to isolate pulmonary Clara cells from mouse [29, 30, 31, 32, 33] . The studies have been instrumental in establishing the many functions of Clara cells. However, the majority of the methods are quite complex and rely on protease digestion followed by centrifugal elutriation and/or Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Only one group used FACS for Clara cell isolation from rat based on the reaction of their glutathione content with monochlorobimine to a fluorescent product [34] . The techniques typically resulted in a Clara cell enrichment of 55,90%. A reproducible source of considerably purified Clara cells is necessary for airway stem/ progenitor cell research. Using high concentrations of collagenase for lung tissue digestion followed by flow cytometry sorting, we were able to achieve 98% pure CCSP + (Clara) cell population, providing a very useful and reliable method for Clara cell function and stem cell research. A notable application will be to directly address molecular mechanisms of genes that have been expressed in Clara cells by using CCSP as a lung specific promoter in transgenic mice.",

However, the level of CD133, Sca-1 and Sox2 expression was lower in CCSP + cells than that in CCSP 2 cells. One possible explanation is that CCSP is a Clara cell differentiation marker, so a CCSP + population of cells may contain more mature Clara cells, but few stem/progenitor cells, while CCSP 2 cells fraction is a mixture of many cells, such as type I, type II, ciliated cells, basal cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblast cells and so on. Many of the cells have been shown to have stem cell features [19, 41] . Sphere culture showed that CCSP + cells were able to form spheroid colonies. The sphere colony size and efficiency of colony formation were lower in CCSP + cells compared to CCSP 2 cells. This data further suggests that CCSP + cells do have stem cell features, but stem cell activities are lower than in CCSP 2 cells. Using tissue sections, we found that 1.59% of CCSP positive cells in TBs were label-retaining cells and 1.1% were CCSP/SPC double positive BASCs. These data provide in vivo validation for the in vitro results that the CCSP + cell population contains a small subset of stem cells in the airway.",

We also found that in vitro, CCSP + cells demonstrated stem cell-like features including stem cell marker expression, bronchosphere colony formation and self-renewal ability. Moreover, a subset of labelretaining cells and BASCs were detectable in the CCSP + population in vivo located in the TBs We conclude that Clara cell isolation by FACS is a useful method for investigating Clara cell function and overall pulmonary stem cell research biology.",
