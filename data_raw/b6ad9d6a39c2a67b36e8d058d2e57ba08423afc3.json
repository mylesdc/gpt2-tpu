            "text": "Background: Avian influenza virus (AIV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are important avian pathogens that can cause enormous economic loss on the poultry industry. Different respiratory etiological agents may induce similar clinical signs that make differential diagnosis difficult. Importantly, AIV brings about severe threat to human public health. Therefore, a novel method that can distinguish these viruses quickly and simultaneously is urgently needed. Results: In this study, an oligonucleotide microarray system was developed. AIV, including H5, H7, and H9 subtypes; NDV; and IBV were simultaneously detected and differentiated on a microarray. Three probes specific for AIV, NDV, and IBV, as well as three other probes for differentiating H5, H7, and H9 of AIV, were first designed and jet-printed to predetermined locations of initiator-integrated poly(dimethylsiloxane) for the synchronous detection of the six pathogens. The marked multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were hybridized with the specific probes, and the results of hybridization were read directly with the naked eyes. No cross-reaction was observed with 10 other subtypes of AIV and infectious bursal disease virus, indicating that the oligonucleotide microarray assay was highly specific. The sensitivity of the method was at least 100 times higher than that of the conventional PCR, and the detection limit of NDV, AIV, H5, H7, and H9 can reach 0.1 EID 50 (50% egg infective dose), except that of IBV, which was 1 EID 50 per reaction. In the validation of 93 field samples, AIV, IBV, and NDV were detected in 53 (56.99%) samples by oligonucleotide microarray and virus isolation and in 50 (53.76%) samples by conventional PCR. Conclusions: We have successfully developed an approach to differentiate AIV, NDV, IBV, H5, H7, and H9 subtypes of AIV using oligonucleotide microarray. The microarray is an accurate, high-throughput, and relatively simple method for the rapid detection of avian respiratory viral diseases. It can be used for the epidemiological surveillance and diagnosis of AIV, IBV, and NDV.",

            "text": "At present, the demand for broiler meat products is increasing worldwide; however, avian viruses cause respiratory infections and lead to mortality in poultry flocks, which impose negative influence on chicken products [1] . The avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) can cause enormous economic loss in the poultry industry worldwide. AIV belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family, Influenza A virus genus. The AIV genome is composed of eight segments of negative-sense single-stranded RNA and classified into different subtypes according to two surface antigens: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA); heretofore, there are 18 known HA and 11 known NA subtypes [2] . Among all known HA subtypes, the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have been restricted to H5 and H7, which not only cause considerable economic losses in the poultry industry [3] but also seriously threaten human health [4] . Other subtypes cause a milder respiratory disease, and they are designated as low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. Although H9 is an LPAI, it is the dominant circulating subtype, showing a high prevalence [5] . NDV belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family, Avulavirus genus, and is an RNA-containing virus. It appears to be a sporadic epizootic disease despite vaccination programs [6] . In industrial poultry farms, birds infected with NDV must be immediately sacrificed due to the threat of infection dissemination across countries. IBV belongs to the family Coronaviridae and the genus Coronavirus. It infects chickens of all ages and causes lesions in respiratory and urogenital organs [7] . Although the IBV vaccine plays a vital role in controlling IB, IBV outbreaks frequently occur and are still considered a global epidemic [8] .",

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used to identify the aforementioned viruses via molecular diagnostic assays, and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is now becoming accepted as a new gold standard in many studies because it shows superior sensitivity [12, 13] . The real-time PCR method, which can quantitate samples, is also used; however, it requires expensive equipment [14] . Moreover, most of the aforementioned methods are used for testing only one agent in a specimen [15] . Multiplex RT-PCR assays that can involve simultaneous amplification of more than one infectious agent are also available, the advantages of the multiplex RT-PCR combine the sensitivity and speed of PCR and eliminate the need for testing clinical samples for each virus separately [16, 17] . Many studies have also been performed using multiplex real-time RT-PCR to differentiate single or mixed avian virus infection, such as NDV, AIV, and IBV [18] [19] [20] [21] . In recent years, microarray technology has also been developed [22, 23] .",

For example, virus isolation, RT-PCR, realtime RT-PCR, fluorescent antibody test, and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay are the currently used methods for the laboratory diagnosis of avian viruses. However, each of these methods has its advantages and limitations. The disadvantages of these methods include the following: time consuming, nonspecific, expensive, or labor-intensive [12, 29, 30] . To establish clinical diagnosis, accurate and fast multiplex detection of avian The type and subtype were identified by reverse transcription and conventional PCR assay, respectively respiratory viruses is very important. In recent years, multiplex RT-PCR and microarray technology are resoundingly applied to detect AIV and its subtypes and diagnose multiple infections such as combination of NDV and AIV [31] . The diagnosis of virus types based on microarray technology can improve the quality and shorten the analysis duration in molecular diagnosis of infectious diseases. Moreover, it can satisfy the needs of simultaneous detection of multiple viruses and screening large numbers of pathology samples [32, 33] .

This is the first time to use this material to detect the nucleotides of avian diseases. In addition, 48 samples can be detected at once, and the results can be read visually. The microarray can simultaneously detect AIV, NDV, and IBV and accurately distinguish AIV haemagglutinin subtypes H5, H7, and H9, whereas virus isolation in embryonated eggs and conventional PCR can only detect one agent in a sample. The duration of this assay without time required for the viral RNA extraction is 2-3 h, and 48 specimens can be simultaneously assayed. We evaluated the capability of the developed assay by comparing its sensitivity with conventional PCR and real-time PCR. The virus titer was 1 EID 50 per reaction, which can be detected by microarray. The result clearly shows that the limits of detection reached 1 EID 50 per reaction for NDV and 0.1 EID 50 per reaction for M, H5, H7, H9, and IBV, which was at least 100 times more sensitive than that of conventional PCR. Furthermore, the detection limit of oligonucleotide microarray is the same as real-time PCR for H5 and NDV and more sensitive than real-time PCR for IBV and H7, H9, and M of AIV. The detection results of the co-infection model also proved that the method established in this study can be used for the accurate detection of mixed infection, which, to a certain degree, also shows the viability of this method. Moreover, 93 avian field samples were used to test the effectiveness and reliability of the microarray, and the experimental results were consistent with the virus isolation. Furthermore, the co-infection situation can be detected in clinical practice by the microarray. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide microarray were both 100%.",

The microarray assay proves to be timesaving in that the entire experiment process, including PCR, took only 2.5 h. Compared with other methods, the microarray assay is more efficient because it can detect three viruses and identify HA subtypes of AIV. It is also convenient because the results of the experiments can be determined with the naked eyes, disregarding the need for expensive experimental apparatus and complicated analysis.",
