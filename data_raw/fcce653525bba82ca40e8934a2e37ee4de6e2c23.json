However, limited data exist on military populations in tropical settings, where the epidemiology of respiratory infections differs substantially from temperate settings. We enrolled recruits undertaking a 10-week military training at two Royal Thai Army barracks between May 2014 and July 2015. We used a multiplex respiratory panel to analyze nose and throat swabs collected at the start and end of the training period, and from participants experiencing respiratory symptoms during follow-up. Paired sera were tested for influenza seroconversion using a hemagglutinin inhibition assay. Overall rates of upper respiratory illness and influenza-like illness were 3.1 and 2.0 episodes per 100 person-weeks, respectively. A pathogen was detected in 96% of samples. The most commonly detected microbes were Haemophilus influenzae type B (62.7%) or non-type B (58.2%) and rhinovirus (22.4%). At baseline, bacterial colonization was high and included H. influenzae type B (82.3%), H. influenzae non-type B (31.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.5%). At the end of follow-up, colonization with H. influenzae non-type B had increased to 74.1%, and S. pneumoniae to 33.6%. In the serology subset, the rate of influenza infection was 3.4 per 100 person-months; 58% of influenza infections resulted in clinical disease. Our study provides key data on the epidemiology and transmission of respiratory pathogens in tropical settings. Our results emphasize the need for improved infection prevention and control in military environments, given the high burden of illness and potential for intense transmission of respiratory pathogens.",

A longitudinal study in Singapore found that 39.4% of military personnel had evidence of seroconversion against influenza A/H1N1 during the 2009 pandemic, compared with 13.5% of individuals in the community and 6.5% of hospital staff. 3 Numerous outbreaks of respiratory infections among military recruits have been reported in the literature, including outbreaks of influenza, adenovirus, 4-6 and pertussis. 7 Resumption of vaccination against adenovirus types 4 and 7 in the U.S. military is estimated to have resulted in a 7-fold decrease in acute respiratory disease 8 and a shift in the predominant adenovirus types from types 4, 3, and 7 to types 1 and 2.",

Despite this, data from tropical settings, in which the epidemiology of influenza and other respiratory infections differs substantially from temperate settings, are limited.

Individuals providing informed consent were enrolled in the study and a demographic and clinical questionnaire was administered. Participants were then followed up for symptoms of respiratory illness until the end of the 10-week training period. At one camp, nasal and throat swabs were obtained at the time of enrolment and at the end of the follow-up period (10 weeks later) from consenting participants. Participants experiencing respiratory symptoms were asked to consult the medical unit, where medical staff took a history, conducted a medical examination, and recorded symptoms of upper respiratory illness (URI) or influenza-like illness (ILI). Upper respiratory illness was defined as an illness with at least two of the following: 1) runny nose or sneezing; 2) nasal congestion; 3) sore throat, hoarseness, or difficulty swallowing; 4) cough; 5) swollen or tender glands in the neck; and 6) fever (oral temperature > 38\u00b0C) at the time of presentation. Influenza-like illness was defined as a respiratory illness with acute onset presenting with fever and cough or sore throat. All ILI cases also met the case definition for URI. Non-ILI cases were defined as URI cases not meeting the case definition for ILI. Additional nasal and throat swabs were requested from participants presenting with acute ILI or URI.",

A cycle threshold value of < 33 was considered a positive result. Previous studies have shown high agreement between FTD33 and other commercial multiplex assays with specificities > 95% for most viral targets. 14,15 Sensitivity for influenza A and B, and human coronaviruses is high (> 90%), but is lower and more variable for other viral targets, including human bocavirus (80-92%), rhinovirus (61-75%), respiratory syncytial virus (50-72%), and human metapneumovirus (74-100%). 14, 15 In a subset of recruits, we measured influenza antibody titers in paired sera taken at enrollment and at the end of followup using a hemagglutinin inhibition assay.

            "text": "We found a high incidence of URI in Thai army recruits, indicating that approximately 30% of recruits experienced a URI episode over the 10-week training period. Comparison with other military cohorts is not straightforward because of differences between settings in terms of vaccination policies and seasonality of key pathogens such as influenza. The URI and ILI rates in our study are nonetheless comparable with those reported by other studies in the United States. [16] [17] [18] Despite this, we found low rates of clinical influenza A in this minimally vaccinated population. Possible reasons for this could be exposure to circulating influenza strains before recruits entering the training camps. Thai national influenza surveillance data indicate high influenza activity in the first half of 2014, with influenza A/H1N1 and influenza B predominating. 19 Concomitantly, our data indicated that 55% of recruits with available serological information had baseline influenza A/H1N1 titers \u00b3 1:40. Titers greater than this value have been shown to be associated with a 50% reduction in risk of clinical influenza from homologous strains, for both influenza A and B viruses. [20] [21] [22] [23] Of interest, 86% of recruits also had baseline titers against influenza B/Massachusetts greater than this level. The higher baseline titers against influenza B/Massachusetts are consistent with the frequent detection of influenza B isolates from the Yamagata lineage in clinical specimens from Thailand in the first half of 2014. 19 In our study, the Fast Track multiplex assay appeared to have lower sensitivity for influenza compared with the CDC RT-PCR assay. We did not specifically investigate reasons for these discrepancies, although it should be noted that the two assays were not performed at the same time, as the multiplex assays were all performed at the end of data collection. We therefore cannot discount the possibility that sample degradation might have influenced the relative performance of the Fast Track assay. Although influenza incidence was low, pathogen detection with sensitive multiplex diagnostics indicated high frequencies of respiratory pathogens, with co-circulation of multiple viruses including rhinovirus, adenovirus, and coronaviruses as well as influenza. In addition, we found high levels of colonization with numerous bacterial species, including both type B and non-type B H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae. Although we did not specifically study transmission chains or epidemiologic links between cases of illness, in the context of our study, recruits did not leave the camps during the 10-week training periods, such that the occurrence of respiratory pathogens is most likely to have resulted from transmission within the camps rather than from external sources. Intense transmission of bacterial species was apparent, as the risks of acquiring H. influenzae non-type B and S. pneumoniae among initially non-colonized individuals were 70% and 31%, respectively. Bacterial species were also commonly found in samples from URI cases. The colonizing nature of these bacterial species makes it difficult to determine the clinical relevance of these detections. However, H. influenzae type B and non-type B were identified in 13% and 9% of clinical samples in the absence of any other pathogens, suggesting that these pathogens could be responsible for illness in a fraction of adult URI cases. Interestingly, H. influenzae type B has not been previously associated with a significant burden of URI in adults. 24 It is possible, however, that these cases were caused by other pathogens not included in the multiplex assay.",
