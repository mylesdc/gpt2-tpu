To explore what makes the dogma work, we developed a celebrity anecdote-based scale to measure \"Chikui\" (suffering a loss) likelihood and found that:(i) people with higher scores on the Chikui Likelihood Scale (CLS) were more likely to report higher scores on subjective well-being and the Socioeconomic Index for the present and (ii) the current Socioeconomic Index could be positively predicted not only by current CLS scores but also by retrospective CLS scores recalled for the past, and the predictive effect was enhanced with increasing time intervals. Our findings suggest that \"suffering a loss is good fortune\" is not a myth but a certain reality.",

Considering that the existing decision theory sees \"maximizing gains\" or \"minimizing losses\" as its basic principle, those theories will not predict or explain \"Chikui\" (suffer a loss) as a choice we want to make.

If Option x ij or Option y ij is a single offered option that needs to be accepted or not, then Option x ij should not always be accepted while Option y ij should not always be rejected, because v(x ij ) is NOT always positive while v(y ij ) is NOT always negative [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] rewarded by an unpredictable life situation (self-generated dimension D j ) (i.e., such an objective later good fortune (gain) does exist). If such an objective later good fortune (gain) does exist, then it can be taken as empirical evidence that there must be some self-generated dimension on which the good fortune (gain) was assigned to the option. Otherwise, taking an option that results in loss appears to be completely unreasonable or not logical. The study reported in this paper therefore intended to collect empirical evidence regarding the relationship between \"suffering a loss\" and \"good fortune.\" The study is organized as follows.",

The hypothesized and alternative models were nested so that the model fit could be compared between models using chi-square difference tests. Moreover, as presented in Table 2 , several indexes were used to determine the goodness of fit. The comparative fit index may range from 0 to 1, and values equal to or greater than 0.90 indicate a good fit to the data (Bentler & Bonnett, 1980; Kline, 1998) . Similarly, scores 0.95 or above are desired with the Tucker-Lewis Index (close fit = 0.95-0.99, acceptable fit = 0.90-0.95, Bentler & Bonnett, 1980) , the goodness of fit index, and the incremental fit index. Finally, a value of 0.08 or less for the root mean square error approximation reflects a model with an adequate fit to the data, whereas values greater than 0.10 strongly suggest that the model fit is unsatisfactory (Browne & Cudeck, 1989 .",

Overall, we found a moderate correlation between Tang et al.'s scale (2014) and the CLS and their subscales. However, the law subscale of Tang et al.'s scale (2014) showed no significant correlation with the CLS and its subscales. The Chikui for the wealth subscale of the CLS did not correlate with the Empirical and incremental validity. Our hypothesis regarding the empirical validity was that the \"Chikui\" likelihood scores would be greater for those who chose \"Chikui\" than those who did not. Considering that volunteers sacrifice their time and energy for the benefit of their communities, Tang et al. (2014) (2014) and the CLS are moderate and that the \"worth-based choices\" scale may serve as the most meaningful competitor for the CLS, we examined whether it is possible for the CLS to predict the outcome of volunteers after controlling for the scores of the \"worth-based choices\" scale. The result of the t-test showed that volunteers had higher CLS scores (M volunteers = 718.27) than non-volunteers (M nonvolunteers = 670.70) (t(198) = 2.21, p < 0.05). This result provided evidence in support of our hypothesis regarding the empirical validity. A binomial logistic regression analysis was then conducted with volunteers as the dependent variable, scores of the CLS as the independent variable, and participants' age, gender, and the scores of the worth-based choice scale as the controlling variables. After controlling the variables mentioned earlier, CLS scores were significant incremental predictors of volunteers (Exp(\u03b2) = 1.002, Wald statistic = 4.236, p < 0.05) ( Table 4 ). These results indicated that the CLS possessed good incremental validity when predicting volunteers.",

This suggested that participants who scored higher on the CLS and its subscales were more perseverant and conscientious.

This indicated that participants scoring higher on the CLS were not likely to be discriminatory, and those who scored higher on the \"Chikui for reputation\" subscale tended not to delay gratification. However, CLS scores were not correlated with allocating more money to the recipient in the DG. This suggested that the CLS and altruism may be two distinct constructs.

However, the CLS was not correlated with allocating more money to the recipient in the DG (r = 0.07, p = 0.21). This finding, together with the correlations of CLS's subscale and the DG reported in Table 6 , suggested that what is measured by allocating more money in the DG is decision makers' altruism and that the threshold of unfairness measured by willingness to accept unfair allocations in the UG was more related to \"Chikui\" than to altruism. Furthermore, CLS scores were not correlated with the degree of discounting in intertemporal choice. This may be because, in order to reach a decision, decision makers must only assess the outcomes of a pair of offered intertemporal options (\"small but sooner\" and \"large but later\") on the fixed dimensions, while they have to generate a new dimension and assign a delayed subjective value (utility) to the single option of \"Chikui.\"",

Moreover, considering that raising a child can cost parents a great deal of money, time, and energy and can be exhilarating and exhausting, participants who were willing to have more than one child were chosen to serve as another indicator of the empirical validity. To support the unique empirical validity of the CLS construct, some covariates that are of relevance to the \"Chikui\" construct, such as altruism and conscientiousness, were included to account for volunteers and participants who were willing to have more than one child. The analysis of empirical validity in Part 1 of this study was repeated using another sample. The inclusion of this analysis also served to address the increased awareness of the need to replicate novel and important results (Baker, 2016) .

In our preliminary investigation, it was found that when asked to indicate whether they agreed that \"suffering a loss is good fortune\" on a 6-point scale (1 = fully disagree; 6 = fully agree), the young Chinese surveyed tended to agree with the dogma, although members of older generations (supermarket customers, N = 88, 49 women, age over 40 years) agreed more than the young generation (undergraduate students, N = 92, 62 women, age range: 18-23 years; M supermarket customers = 4.76, M undergraduate students = 4.14, t = 4.1, p < 0.001). It was reasoned that the hidden goal of choosing Chikui (suffer a loss) in the present was to receive more material or mental benefit years later in an unpredictable life situation. Given that obtaining more material benefit requires some time to accumulate, someone who chooses Chikui at a younger age is more likely to gain more in his/her older years. Thus, we hypothesized that age would moderate the association between Chikui likelihood and real benefit. To test the moderation hypothesis, we set up two moderated multiple regression models, each consisting of one independent variable (Chikui), one moderator variable (age), and one outcome variable (material benefit or mental benefit).",

Therefore, we entered all the variables in the study into exploratory factor analysis using unrotated principal component factor analysis and principal component analysis with varimax rotation to determine the number of factors that are necessary to account for the variance in the variables. The factor analysis revealed the presence of six distinct factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 rather than a single factor. The six factors accounted for 59.45% of the variance, and the largest factor was found to account for only 17.7% of the variance. Thus, no general factor was apparent. According to the two criteria, there was no common method bias problem in this study.",

In this study, we utilized the CLS to determine whether there was a linear correlation between CLS scores and real benefits (either material or mental). The resulting findings revealed that CLS scores could positively predict SEI and SWB, suggesting that people who are more likely to choose Chikui are more likely to be satisfied with their life overall and to receive more material rewards. It is therefore relatively safe to say that \"suffering a loss is good fortune\" is not a myth but reality. Table 10 shows the regression results. Most importantly, the predicted two-way interaction was significant in the analysis of SEI. Simple slope analyses were conducted to illustrate the nature of the two-way interaction (Aiken & West, 1991) . More specifically, the CLS was more positively related to SEI as people aged. However, this effect was not observed between CLS scores and SWB. This result indicated that age moderated the relationship between Chikui likelihood and SEI but not the relationship between Chikui likelihood and SWB.",

One possible explanation is that a person's material gains must be accumulated over time, whereas mental benefits may not. To test this possibility, inspired by the finding that preschool children's delay of gratification can predict long-term coping and adjustment (Funder, Block, & Block, 1983; Mischel, Shoda, & Peake, 1988) , we wanted to explore whether CLS scores could predict a person's long-term material or mental benefit. We conjectured that the time interval would moderate the relationship between CLS scores and material benefits more heavily than it moderates the relationship between CLS scores and mental benefits. The ideal way to do this is to conduct a longitudinal study. However, this method was not possible within the time constraints of the study. Therefore, we tried an alternative way to collect supporting evidence. Instead of measuring people's \"Chikui\" likelihood first and then their material or mental benefit years later, we measured people's present material or mental benefit and then asked them to assess their CLS score from years ago. If there was a correlation between people's present material or mental benefit and their retrospective CLS score, we termed it a reverse-predictive effect of the CLS score on later material or mental benefit. Study 3 attempted to investigate this possibility. There was some empirical evidence demonstrating that the retrospective method we intended to use was effective (Bailey, Nothanagel, & Wolfe, 1995; Melamed, 1993; O'Gorman, 1982; Watson et al., 2013) .",

In this sense, efforts to enhance environmental protection consciousness (such as that proposed by the government or an NGO) do, in fact, emphasize that there is an invisible \"green\" dimension. The purpose of thinking green is to make it clear that choosing to \"Chikui\" (suffer a loss) on an offered dimension that represents exploiting natural resource wealth will gain something on an extra dimension that represents reducing environmental pollution and ecological impact. That an individual or organization, at present, should gain less, gain nothing, or even lose something (Chikui) in return for green and sustainable development in the future is exactly what the philosophy of \"suffering a loss is good fortune\" prescribes.",

These findings also provide an empirical reference for young people who are entering society and must choose among survival rules for life.",
