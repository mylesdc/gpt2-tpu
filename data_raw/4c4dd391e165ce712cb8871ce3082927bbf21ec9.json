Detection of CMV antibodies is effective for systematic screening for CMV infection [2] . For instance, the CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity assay can help to distinguish primary from non-primary human CMV infections [3] [4] [5] . The key immune methods used for CMV antibody detection are: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [6] , Elecsys [7] , electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) [8] , immunofluorescence assay (IFA) [9] , flow cytometry (FCM) [10] and immunoblots [11] . Additionally, new immune methods for CMV antibody detection have been developed, such as the chemiluminesent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) [12] and protein microarrays [13, 14] . However, these methods suffer from inherent limitations, such as length of testing time, the needs for expensive equipment, specialist skills, low sensitivity, and complicated sample preparation processes. For example, conventional ELISA is still the main diagnostic test for CMV, and commercial CMV ELISA Kits are available. Although ELISA is often used as a comparison method for CMV antibody detection [13] , obvious shortcomings include the need of tracer label, plate washing, the indirect format of detection, and the length of time necessary for testing. Thus, a rapid, simple, direct, and high-throughput method for CMV antibody detection is urgently needed.",

Compared to the methods above, the advantages of BIE are evident, e.g., high-throughput multiplexed analysis and quantitative, label-free rapid testing. Previous applications of BIE mainly focus on the biomedical fields [17, 18] , such as high-throughput disease diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) marker [19, 20] , the detection of avian influenza virus (AIV) [21] and antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) detection [22] . Thus, the biosensor technology offers important tools for disease diagnosis. As such, new applications have recently been developed, including those for the analysis of the interaction between tropomyosin allergens and antibodies [23] , and the interaction between soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins [24] . To date, however, BIE has not been applied for the detection of CMV antibody, particularly for the identification of the CMV IgG and IgM antibodies.",

Anti-IgG and a goat antibody against human IgM (anti-IgM) were purchased from Beijing Bo Sheng Bio-technology Co. Ltd. CMV-3A was purchased from GalaxyBio. The CMV-3A was a fusion of three segments of Pp150, Gp52 and Pp65, which have strong antigenicity epitopes. Fusion of the multi-epitope both enhances the sensitivity/specificity and reduces false negatives. Thus, CMV-3A was used as the ligand in the BIE assay. Purified CMV antibody (Pp65, C-Term, Rabbit, 1 mg/mL) was purchased from Antibodies-online.com. Patient serum samples were purchased from QiLu Hospital of Shandong University and clinical information is listed in Table A in S2 File. TORCH ELISA Kits used to analyze serum samples were purchased from MEDSON Inc. The detection process and analysis were executed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microplates were coated with native CMV antigens, highly purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation and inactivated. The solid phase was first treated with the diluted sample, and IgG molecules to CMV were then captured, if present, by the antigens. After washing out all of the other sample components, bound anti-CMV IgG molecules were detected by the addition of specific polyclonal anti-H-IgG antibodies labelled with peroxidase (HRP) in the second incubation. The enzyme captured on the solid phase, acting on the substrate/chromogen mixture, generates an optical signal that is proportional to the amount of anti-CMV IgG antibodies present in the sample. A calibration curve, calibrated against the first W.H.O international standard, makes possible a quantitative determination of the IgG antibody in the patient.",

The incident wave of polarized light irradiates the sample as a probe beam and is thereby modified resulting in a reflective or transmission beam having the ability to carry sample information, such as protein layer thickness. When imaging ellipsometry is used to detect layer thickness, the reflection intensity is represented in grayscale, and the variation in layer thickness leads to changes in the grayscale value. If the refractive index is invariant, the grayscale value is directly proportional to the thickness of the protein layer within the range of 0~30 nm layer thickness, i.e., I = kd, where I is the light intensity and d is the layer thickness [28] . Under these conditions k is a constant and can be determined from a protein layer with known grayscale values and known thickness [29] . There is also a relationship between surface concentration and film thickness: surface concentration (\u03bcg/cm 2 )K\u00d7d, where K = 0.12 [27] . Thus, the grayscale value directly reflects layer thickness and surface concentration. The higher the grayscale value, the thicker the layer and the higher the surface concentration.",

A piece of silicon wafer was placed on the microfluidic mold of the microfluidic system so that surfaces of the wafers were patterned to form small, regular cells in an array format. Then, the carboxyl groups were activated by pumping 10 \u03bcL of NE into each cell at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcL/min and passed through the surface of the wafer. In the presence of NHS, EDC transfers carboxyl groups to the Sulfo-NHS ester, which reacts with the amino groups of proteins to immobilize the proteins on surface. Next, the ligand was immobilized: CMV-3A as ligand or probe was pumped into each cell (10 \u03bcL per cell at 1 \u03bcL/min). Third, blocking occurred by pumping the blocking reagent into each cell (50 \u03bcL per cell at 1 \u03bcL/min) and passing it through each ligand area. Thus, a sensing array surface with CMV-3A was formed to catch CMV antibodies. Fourth, targets were detected. PBST was used as blank control (50 \u03bcL per cell at 1 \u03bcL/min) and purified CMV antibody as a positive control (50 \u03bcL per cell at 1 \u03bcL/min) by pumping them into several of the individual cells. Simultaneously, patient serum samples were also pumped into remaining cells (50 \u03bcL per cell at 1 \u03bcL/min). The CMV antibodies in the serum were captured when they interacted with the CMV-3A on the sensing surface. All cells were rinsed with PBST (20 \u03bcL per cell at 20 \u03bcL/min) between every two consecutive operation steps. Finally, the microarray wafers were removed from the microfluidic system. After being rinsed with deionized water and dried with nitrogen, the wafers were analyzed using imaging ellipsometry. If the CMV antibodies in the solution or serum interacted with the CMV-3A on the surface and formed a complex, the layer in that area became thicker. The experimental results were recorded as images in grayscale, and binding of CMV antibodies resulted in a significant increase in grayscale value.",

It can be used to visualize the variation in signal from all units of the microarray with high spatial resolution. Patient sample analysis results from one microarray can simultaneously be identified, and the data can be obtained in several seconds using an imaging ellipsometer.

However, the identification of antibody types may help to determine the course of disease, and BIE may be used as a clinical primary screening tool for CMV patients. IgM is produced in large amounts early in infection (reaching a peak in the first month), and is followed by IgG production [7, 31] . Levels of IgM decline in the months following the onset of infection, whereas IgG levels persist for the rest of the patient's life [32, 33] . Determining IgG avidity can provide additional guidance on infection status, and low avidity IgG is initially present but increases over time [34] . A positive result for IgM combined with low-to-moderate IgG suggests avidity a primary CMV infection within the past 3 to 4 months [35] . The visualized BIE image (Fig 2) could reflect types via difference in brightness, so this technology can achieve rapid screening. To date, our work is simply a demonstration for IgG type antibody detection with BIE. IgM and other antibodies needed to screen for specific antigen can be incorporated in the future for further practical applications.",
