            "text": "There is growing concern in Sub-Saharan Africa about the spread of the Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, and the public health burden that it ensues. Since 1976, there have been 885,343 suspected and laboratory confirmed cases of EVD and the disease has claimed 2,512 cases and 932 fatality in West Africa. There are certain requirements that must be met when responding to EVD outbreaks and this process could incur certain challenges. For the purposes of this paper, five have been identified: (i) the deficiency in the development and implementation of surveillance response systems against Ebola and others infectious disease outbreaks in Africa; (ii) the lack of education and knowledge resulting in an EVD outbreak triggering panic, anxiety, psychosocial trauma, isolation and dignity impounding, stigmatisation, community ostracism and resistance to associated socio-ecological and public health consequences; (iii) limited financial resources, human technical capacity and weak community and national health system operational plans for prevention and control responses, practices and management; (iv) inadequate leadership and coordination; and (v) the lack of development of new strategies, tools and approaches, such as improved diagnostics and novel therapies including vaccines which can assist in preventing, controlling and containing Ebola outbreaks as well as the spread of the disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop and implement an active early warning alert and surveillance response system for outbreak response and control of emerging infectious diseases. Understanding the unending risks of transmission dynamics and resurgence is essential in implementing rapid effective response interventions tailored to specific local settings and contexts. Therefore, the following actions are recommended: (i) national and regional inter-sectorial and trans-disciplinary surveillance response systems that include early warnings, as well as critical human resources development, must be quickly adopted by allied ministries and organisations in African countries in epidemic and pandemic responses; (ii) harnessing all stakeholders commitment and advocacy in sustained funding, collaboration, communication and networking including community participation to enhance a coordinated responses, as well as tracking and prompt case management to combat challenges; (iii) more research and development in new drug discovery and vaccines; and (iv) understanding the involvement of global health to promote the establishment of public health surveillance response systems with functions of early warning, as well as monitoring and evaluation in upholding research-action programmes and innovative interventions.",

This part of the world is persistently confronted with this fatal disease which has an incubation period of two to 21 days (averagely 3-13days). Symptoms range from, firstly, fever and fatigue before descending into headaches, vomiting, violent diarrhoea, then multiple organ failure and massive internal bleeding [1, 2] . Ebola typically begins in remote places and can be distributed via hospitals/ healthcare centers or within the community as it takes several infections before the disease is ascertained. The prevalence, morbidity and case fatality of chronological EVD outbreaks showed the persistent resurgence in different regions in Sub-Saharan Africa (see Figure 1) .",

Overall, Ebola virus socio-ecology systems have shown to be linked by direct and indirect transmission through contact with objects from patients. For example, the blood or secretions of an infected person or objects that have been contaminated with infected secretions can reach humans from a variety of hosts/sources: na\u00efve infected populations, infected wildlife, fruit and vegetable bats and the handling of infected fruit bats, monkeys, chimpanzees, gorillas, forest antelopes and porcupines are all possible natural hosts (whether ill or dead or found in the jungle or rainforest) [1,2]. Thus, tracking, mapping, reporting and documenting veterinary public health zoonosis surveillance responses, the behaviour and medical history of butchers and poachers, as well as agro-livestock business trading are imperative to be able to establish integrated community-based and national comprehensive early warning and outbreak surveillance response systems.",

This system could include, for example, a ban on bush meat consumption, a ban on public places and markets, a reinforcement of safety and inspection regulations on food and fruit eating bats and examining bat migration as well as other animal-household drivers and risk factors [3, 4] .",

Building a local network (e.g. WhatsApp) or crowdsourcing data for targeted active responses, as well as the implementation of a geographical information system (GIS), are necessary spatial-temporal mapping and decision-making support systems to contain Ebola outbreaks. Lessons learnt from other outbreaks including cholera, H7N9 and H1N1 avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Lassa fever, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), dengue pandemic and the human-animal with environmentalclimate interface in Africa and elsewhere can assist in setting benchmarks for monitoring epicentre/focal early warning alert, incidence and prevalence as well as effective surveillance response interventions measures [1, 5] . Meanwhile, modelling factors and trends in different changing transmission scenarios could also yield better tactics, as well as strategic evidence not only for policy support, but also for direction, planning and implementation of national and regional early alert and surveillance response systems to control and prevent sentinel sites [4] .

The genus Ebolavirus is one of three members of the Filoviridae family (filovirus), along with the genus Marburgvirus and the genus Cuevavirus, and comprises five distinct species, of which Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus and Bundibugyo ebolavirus are mostly associated with the major EVD outbreaks in Africa. Reston ebolavirus and Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus are mostly reported in the Asia-Pacific region, especially Philippines and the People's Republic of China, but no symptoms or deaths in humans from these have been reported to date [2] . The disease outbreak has persisted over the years across Central, East and Southern Africa. On March 21, 2014, the first case of an outbreak was identified in Guinea, West Africa, witnessing a total of 460 cases with 339 fatalities, as it spread beyond the remote rural areas to the capital city of Conakry. Soon after the outbreak was identified, it appeared across the border in the small nation of Liberia on March 30, 2014. This country was the least hit with 339 cases and 156 fatalities thus far. Later, it was also identified in Sierra Leone in late May 2014, just as it appeared the outbreaks in Guinea and Liberia were winding down. It has since spread to at least two Sierra Leone districts with 533 cases claiming at least 233 lives, including 68 deaths of 85 new cases within just four days. Similarly, between 21 and 23 July 2014, 96 new cases and 7 deaths were reported from Liberia and Sierra Leone. In Guinea, 12 new cases and 5 deaths were reported during the same period and one death in Nigeria [1] (see Table 1 ).",

Similar to the conception and spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa, one of the main obstacles in reducing the distribution of Ebola has been the widespread ignorance, lack of knowledge and potential panic over EVD, considered to be a 'Satanic or bewitched' disease, leading to trepidation, isolation, dignity impounding, stigmatisation and ostracism from associated socio-ecological and public health consequences. Recently, local residents of the Sadialu village in Sierra Leone were sheltering those infected with Ebola, refusing to go to or escaping from hospitalisation referred as \"death sentence\", and hiding from the local health centre due to circulating beliefs, myths and rumours that the interventions being administered to patients were actually causing the disease (see Figure 2 ).",

Experiences and lessons learnt from outbreaks in developed nations could be shared with limited-resource countries so that they can to establish early warning and surveillance response systems [4] . Irrefutably, national and regional inter-sectorial and trans-disciplinary approaches must be adopted and related to ministries and organisations in order to build innovative early warning system surveillance response systems through fostering capacity building and training on outbreaks and emerging infectious disease prevention, control and elimination. It is also imperative to understand global health involvement and governance, establish monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of research for action programmes, as well as increase funding to support efforts of existing and new consortiums and research projects in Africa. Furthermore, there is need to analyse the socio-economic and cultural factors, the status of prevailing health systems, and the risk factors and determinants of the emergence and spread of outbreaks in Africa. Reliable and well-organised monitoring, the establishment of GISs and appraisals of cost-effectiveness in an integrated national health system (with a care management approach) will eventually improve evidence information for policy-makers [4] . In turn, they can make decisions and guide implementers of health programmes to achieve beneficial and innovative sustainable global public health interventions, quality healthcare outcomes and economic prosperity.",
