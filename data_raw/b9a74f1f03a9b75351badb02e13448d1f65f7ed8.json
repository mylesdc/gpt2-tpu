However, efforts to characterize the landscape of HTRs to diverse pathogens are far from offering a comprehensive view. Here, we developed an HTR Connectivity Map based on systematic assessment of pairwise similarities of HTRs to 50 clinically important human pathogens using 1353 gene-expression profiles generated from >60 human cells/tissues. These 50 pathogens were further partitioned into eight robust \"HTR communities\" (i.e., groups with more consensus internal HTR similarities). These communities showed enrichment in specific infection attributes and differential gene expression patterns. Using query signatures of HTRs to external pathogens, we demonstrated four distinct modes of HTR associations among different pathogens types/class, and validated the reliability of the HTR community divisions for differentiating and categorizing pathogens from a host-oriented perspective. These findings provide a first-generation HTR Connectivity Map of 50 diverse pathogens, and demonstrate the potential for using annotated HTR community to detect functional associations among infectious pathogens.",

Briefly, we gathered 1,353 reference gene expression profiles from more than 60 human cells/tissues infected with 50 clinically important pathogen types and then implemented an unbiased HTR characterization strategy and rank-based expression profile comparisons 11, 12 to evaluate 1,225 pairwise pathogen-pathogen HTR similarities (Fig. 1) . We further divided these first 50 pathogens into groups with significant internal HTR similarity and characteristic modes of host gene expression patterns tagged with specific infection attributes, i.e., a reference resource known as HTR community. The annotations for community pathogens allowed us to propose, with an unprecedented host-oriented perspective, new associations for well-known pathogen taxonomy classes and novel associations for microenvironment-related and clinically relevant pathogens among these 50 infectious pathogens (Fig. 1) .",

GSEA was used to score each reference profile for the direction and strength of enrichment with the query reference signature. The connectivity of HTRs between pathogen pairs was then presented in a map/matrix, with positive scores indicating functionally similar HTRs and negative scores indicating opposing HTRs. Through clustering, 50 pathogens were grouped into eight HTR communities (i.e., pathogens that induce more consensus HTRs).

Pathogen pairs whose HTRs were significantly similar are connected with an edge, the thickness of which is proportional to the pair's association score. A community is defined as a group of nodes that are closely interconnected with each other, with fewer connections to nodes outside the group. HTR communities were identified based on association scores and labeled numerically according to the alphabetical precedence of the exemplar pathogen. Enriched HTR-related biological classifications, along with laboratory and clinical characteristics, are summarized (detailed information in Supplementary Table S4 ). the enrichment scores of GO BPs in relation to pathogen mPRLs using GSEA (cutoff FDR < 0.01) 11 . We identified significantly dysregulated GO BPs in the HTRs to each pathogen as well as enriched GO BPs for particular HTR communities (Supplementary Data S6). In total, we identified 50 distinct community-specific GO BPs (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Table S5 ), some of which were functionallay related to corresponding infections. For example, catabolic process and intracellular protein transport are specifically activated in HTR Community 2, whereas mRNA metabolic process and intracellular transport are specifically inhibited in HTR Community 8; the immune/defense response, positive regulation of I KappaB/NF-KappaB cascade, and negative regulation of apoptosis/programmed cell death are highly activated in HTRs to oncogenic pathogens in Community 3 17, 18 , but not in HTRs to the DNA tumor viruses in Community 5, in which G protein-coupled receptor signaling and sensory perception are specifically down regulated 19, 20 . Notably, the same G protein-coupled receptor signaling is specifically activated in both HTR Communities 6 and 7 21 . However, pathogens in Community 6 cause additional diverse HTR dysregualtions, including specifically up regulated cell signaling and second messenger mediated signaling, as well as down regulated DNA metabolic process and repair, cell cycle (including M phase, mitosis), and response to DNA damage and endogenous stimulus. To some extent, these gene functional features helped distinguish proteobateria in Community 6 to those in Community 7. Together with annotated infection attributes, the gene expression pattern analysis validated our within-HTR community pathogen associations, further demonstrating the host response patterns to infections of different pathogen types are limited and differential.",

Nonetheless, HTR community analysis yielded the strongest positive association with HTR Community 8 for the T. denticola query signature derived from calvarial overlying soft tissues, but not those from calvarial bones (Fig. 7b,c) . This dissociation is likely due to the fact that the three reference profiles in the HTR Connectivity Map were not derived from calvarial bones (Supplementary  Table S1 ), whose expressed transcripts are generally not shared with other cell or tissue types.

This plentiful information has The HTR Connectivity Map scheme developed here was limited to publically accessible expression profiling data, therefore, our data collection was unavoidably at risk of bias. Recognizing the limited cell type diversity among our samples in our systematic assessment of HTR similarities, we combined PRLs of a specific pathogen computationally to represent the integral feature of HTRs to that pathogen. Through further clustering, we identified eight pathogen groups, that is, HTR Communities, with a discernible consensus of internal HTR similarities. The methodologies used in this study, including gene expression profile merging, comparison, and clustering, were first introduced by Iorio et al. 12 and Subramanian et al. 11 Previously, these methods performed very well in characterizing and predicting similarities in drug effect and mode of action across cell lines and dosages, and further in partitioning drugs into communities (i.e., compounds with similar modes of action). Moreover, it was our aim to complement this HTR Community as a resource and elucidate the HTR associations established among the 50 pathogens. To this end, we collected laboratory and clinical infection characteristics for individual pathogens, and then identified computationally HTR-related infection attributes, as well as differential gene expression patterns, for each HTR community. These annotations greatly facilitated the understanding of correlations between pathogen types and significant HTR similarities, as well as the underlying infection mechanisms.",

However, we learned from the literature that-similar to IAV-hPIV and hMPV also have hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and functionally similar proteins (e.g., fusion protein F) on their surfaces that serve as antigenic and virulent markers 44, 45 . Moreover, their dual community associations can be explained by the shared gene expression patterns in HTR communities 3 and 6. Specifically, HTRs to pathogens in Community 3 showed enrichment in positive regulation of NF-kappaB signaling and immune responses, as well as negative regulation of apoptosis, whereas HTRs to pathogens in Community 6 showed enrichment in decreasing host cell mitotic activity (Fig. 4) . Consistent with these findings, NF-kappaB signaling is induced strongly by hMPV and hPIV infection [46] [47] [48] and decreased cell mitotic activity has been reported to occur following hPIV infection 49 .

Supposing a community contains n of a total N pathogens, and their rankings are R 1 , R 2 , R 3 \u2026 R n , the association score between a gene signature and a community based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic was obtained as follows: The association score was top when > top bottom or bottom otherwise. We used one million (M) random trails, as above, to estimate the permutation P values for each association. Supposing the association score between a gene signature and a community is AS, the corresponding trials were AS i (i = 1, 2, 3\u2026M). The number of instances with \u2265 AS AS i was counted as m, and the frequency (m/M) was taken as the P value.",
