To conserve resources, cases were only enrolled and tested for influenza during times when the number of patients meeting the ILI case definition exceeded 7% (10% after 2014) of the total number of outpatients for the week. When this benchmark was met, five to 10 patients were enrolled and sampled by nasopharyngeal swabs the following week. In total, The National Influenza Center (NIC) received 2476 samples, of which 683 (27.6%) were positive for influenza. The greatest strength of the system was its representativeness and flexibility. The timeliness of the data and the acceptability of the surveillance system performed moderately well; however, the utility of the data and the stability and simplicity of the surveillance system need improvement. Overall, the performance of the Tunisian influenza surveillance system was evaluated as performing moderately well for situational awareness in the country and for collecting representative influenza virologic samples. Conclusions: The influenza surveillance system in Tunisia provided pertinent evidence for public health interventions related to influenza situational awareness. To better monitor influenza, we propose that ILI surveillance should be limited to sites that are currently performing well and the quality of data collected should be closely monitored and improved.",

The ILI sentinel sites were selected on the basis of their representativeness, their geographical-demographical criteria and the presence of voluntary and motivated health professionals. Since the start of surveillance, data was collected using standardized forms that aggregated data into three age groups: 0-5 years; 6-15 years and \u2265 16 years [6] . In 2014, however, a new WHO ILI case definition was implemented with minimum data standards that included gender and age groups (0-< 2 years, 2-< 5 years, 5-< 15 years, 15-< 50 years, 50-< 65 years and \u2265 65 years) [7] . ILI sites report cases from the 40th week of the year in October, to the 18th week of the following year in April, which correspond to the influenza season that started and finish in relation to the cold period of the northern hemisphere and the passage of migratory birds [8] (http://www.santetunisie.rns.tn/images/docs/anis/guidegripf6102016.pdf).

So we decided to evaluate the year of the new strategy implementation with two years before the project (pre-evaluation) to have a clear idea about the system performance at time zero, just when we started the new version of the surveillance system and to evaluate the changes in the future after the end of the project (post-evaluation). Surveillance system performance was assessed using the guidelines of the US-CDC [11] . Eight attributes were considered: (i) data quality and completeness; (ii) representativeness; (iii) timeliness; (iv) simplicity; (v) acceptability; (vi) flexibility; (vii) stability and (viii) utility. For each attribute, specific indicators were developed. Indicators were analyzed, scored and a mean score was calculated for each attribute using a qualitative scale from 1 to 5, from very poor performance (1) to very good performance (5) . In this scale, we have collapsed two categories for some questions: score 1 (strongly agree / agree); score 2 (mostly agree); score 3 (somewhat disagree); score 4 (Disagree/ strongly disagree) and score 5 (Do not know). We used surveillance databases collected at the National Surveillance Program of the Ministry of Health and the NIC. Standardized semi-structured and selfadministered questionnaires were used to collect relevant data from surveillance staff at ILI sites, regional directorates, the DSSB and from the NIC.",

In this example, gaps in completeness of data affected the ability to objectively assess quality and timeliness of data. The timeliness of the system may be affected by the geographical distribution of sentinel sites and the simplicity of data collection and reporting methods. An electronic information management system was one of the most important recommendations proposed by surveillance staff to improve data completeness, quality monitoring and timeliness. It would facilitate real-time sharing of data [15] . A recent evaluation of a syndromic influenza sentinel surveillance system in Madagascar between 2009 and 2014 showed that by using mobile phones and texting for the transmission of daily aggregated data, the simplicity of the system was strengthened, improving the completeness, quality and timeliness of the data and the acceptability of the system to the sentinel site staff [16] . This is in line with the recommendation that a revised data management approach, which offers the advantage of automation and user-friendly interface, would ultimately improve the acceptance and utility of the surveillance system [17] .

The stability of the system is affected by access to materials, training and resources required by staff who conducts surveillance and influenza testing. This is an area of vulnerability, as current material resources are limited, and may decrease acceptability of the system among staff. Moreover, one of the mechanisms to strengthen the surveillance system is to train at least two persons per site and to ensure cascade training in the sites in every season to avoid the consequences of qualified staff departure.",

The aggregated data were incomplete for key variables such as the number of samples tested for influenza at individual ILI sites and several sites were not consistently sending this information to the regional directorates. We recommended enhancement of awareness and sensitivity of surveillance staff regarding the importance of key variables and to strengthen training on data collection and reporting. Inclusion of ILI sites in the influenza surveillance system should be revisited periodically by assessing timely reporting and quality and completeness of data collected. Moreover, an electronic information management system would improve completeness of key variables. On the other hand, the surveillance system presents a strong point in virologic surveillance internationally confirmed by the results from the WHO EQAP and participation in global influenza vaccine strain selection and WHO FluNet virologic monitoring. The foremost importance of the surveillance system is to detect the viruses causing and their activities for influenza-like illness rather than influenza. Improving the quality and completeness of virologic sampling and reporting is essential to guarantee the identification of circulating viruses and their local seasonality in Tunisia. The early detection and characterization of these viruses allow timely annual updates for a vaccine that can prevent deaths and alleviate illness in vulnerable groups. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value were not included in this evaluation because of a lack of data. It is recommended to assess these attributes in the next surveillance system evaluation.",

In line with WHO recommendations [7] , we propose that ILI surveillance should be limited to sites that are currently performing well as part of the network and the improvement of data and sample collection to be more systematically gathered. This evaluation provides a good opportunity to monitor future improvements in influenza surveillance, by quantifying evaluation indicators prior to and after the implementation of a new strategy based on quality improvement and electronic surveillance. Future evaluations are highly recommended to measure the impact of such strategies on the performance and sustainability of the surveillance system. ",
