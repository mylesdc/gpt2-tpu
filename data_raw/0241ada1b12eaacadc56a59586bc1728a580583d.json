Since our understanding of the HCV lifecycle would benefit from the identification of additional permissive cell lines, we assembled a panel of hepatic and non-hepatic cell lines and assessed their ability to support HCV infection. Here we show infection of the human hepatoma cell lines PLC/PRF/5 and Hep3B with cell culturederived HCV (HCVcc), albeit to lower levels than that achieved in Huh7 cells. To better understand the reduced permissiveness of PLC and Hep3B cells for HCVcc infection, we performed studies to evaluate the ability of each cell line to support specific steps of the viral lifecycle (i.e. entry, replication, egress and spread).",

Interestingly, we also observed that interferon stimulated gene (i.e. ISG56) expression was significantly and differentially up-regulated in PLC and Hep3B cells following viral infection. Conclusions: We conclude that the restrictions observed later during HCV infection in these cell lines could in part be attributed to HCV-induced innate signaling. Nevertheless, the identification of two new cell lines capable of supporting authentic HCVcc infection, even at reduced levels, expands the current repertoire of cell lines amendable for the study of HCV in vitro and should aid in further elucidating HCV biology and the cellular determinants that modulate HCV infection.",

Although acute infection is typically asymptomatic, 80% of patients fail to clear the virus resulting in a chronic infection associated with the development of significant liver disease, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, steatosis, insulin resistance and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [3] . In fact, HCV-related HCC accounts for over 50% of HCC cases and over 30% of liver transplants in the United States.

            "text": "First, for control HCVpp infections, cells were infected with pseudotyped lentiviruses encoding a luciferase reporter and bearing the glycoproteins E1 and E2 of HCV genotype 2a (JFHpp), HCV E1 and E2 of genotype 1a (H77pp) or the VSV G glycoprotein (VSVGpp). At 72 h post infection (p.i.) pseudoparticle entry was assessed by luciferase activity as previously described [34] . All cell lines were equally permissive for VSVGpp infection (8 \u00d7 10 5 -9 \u00d7 10 5 RLU, data not shown) however, only Huh7, Hep3B, PLC and HepG2 cells stably expressing CD81 (HepG2-CD81, Additional file 1: Figure S1 ) were permissive for HCVpp infection ( Figure 1A) . All other cell lines tested exhibited less than 1% of maximum luciferase activity, indicating that these cells are non-permissive for HCVpp entry, which is consistent with previously published reports [10] . To assess permissiveness for HCVcc infection, all cells were infected with HCVcc at an MOI of 2.0 FFU/cell and intracellular HCV RNA was determined by RTqPCR analysis 72 h p.i. We included Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells as they lack all known HCV entry receptors and therefore serve as a control for background HCV RNA levels (i.e. non-specific cell bound HCV) ( Figure 1B , dashed line = 10 2 copies/\u03bcg RNA) [32] . As expected, Huh7 cells were highly permissive for HCVcc and replicated HCV RNA to levels of 2.0 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 8.2 \u00d7 10 4 copies/\u03bcg RNA by 72 h p.i. Caco-2 cell showed minimal to no HCVcc permissiveness, reaching levels of only 4.0 \u00d7 10 7 \u00b1 7.1 \u00d7 10 1 copies/\u03bcg RNA. Although Caco-2 cells have previously been reported to support suboptimal HCVcc infection [35] , the low levels of HCV RNA (p value > 0.05) measured in these infected cultures are likely due to receptor-bound HCV similar to that of the non-permissive parental HepG2 cell line. Addition of CD81 to the HepG2 cells conferred HCVcc permissiveness, as previously reported [11] , resulting in increased HCV RNA replication of 1.3 \u00d7 10 4 \u00b1 4.8 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcg RNA (p value < 0.01). Notably, statistically significant HCVcc infection was also detected in PLC cells and Hep3B cells. Although PLC cells were less permissive for HCVpp ( Figure 1A ), PLC cells contained 10-fold higher HCV RNA levels (3.9 \u00d7 10 4 \u00b1 2.6 \u00d7 10 3 copies/ \u03bcg RNA) 72 h after infection with HCVcc compared to Hep3B cells (2.8 \u00d7 10 3 \u00b1 3.5 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcg RNA) ( Figure 1B) , which were as permissive as Huh7 cells for HCVpp infection ( Figure 1A ). Taken together, these data indicate that PLC and Hep3B cells are permissive for both HCVpp and HCVcc infection, although their permissiveness for HCVcc and HCVpp infection is reduced to different degrees compared to Huh7 cells, suggesting that PLC and Hep3B cells may differ in their capacity to efficiently support specific [21] , Hep3B cells [22] and HepG2-CD81 cells are hepatoma-derived cells lines which although differ cytologically from one another share similar hepatocytes-like characteristics with Huh7 cells, such as cuboidal epithelial-like morphology with high nucleus-tocytoplasm ratio, containing mono-and bi-nuclei with multiple nucleoli and cytoplasmic granules (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ). Our initial screening ( Figure 1 ) indicated that these three cells lines also share permissiveness for both HCVpp and HCVcc infection albeit to differing degrees. Since viral binding/entry represents the first step in the HCV lifecycle, we first assessed the expression of the known HCV entry factors in these cells by measuring CD81, SR-BI, CLDN1 and OCLN mRNA levels by RTqPCR analysis (Figure 2A ). When compared to Huh7, no significant difference in mRNA expression for the four known HCV entry factors was observed among the four cell lines. We next analyzed the cell surface expression of CD81 and SR-BI by flow cytometry and CLDN1 and OCLN by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) as our commercially-available antibodies to these two tight junctions proteins are not amendable to flow cytometric analysis. As shown in Figure 2B , cell surface expression of CD81 and SR-BI in PLC, Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells, as measured by flow cytometry, was comparable to that observed on Huh7 cells. IF analysis of CLDN1 and OCLN also confirmed cell surface expression of these receptors on the newly identified HCVcc-permissive PLC and Hep3B cells as well as the previously characterized Huh7 [36] and HepG2-CD81 cells [35] . Taken together, these data indicate that PLC and Hep3B cells, at a minimum, express and localize all four known HCV entry receptors on their cell surface. Despite expression all four of the previously established essential HCV entry factors, the PLC and HepG2-CD81 cells showed a reduced permissiveness for HCVpp infection ( Figure 1A ) when compared to Huh7 and Hep3B cells. While varying luciferase activity after parallel HCVpp inoculation is a phenotype we have seen among Huh7 cell lines from different laboratories (Additional file 1: Figure S3 and [34] ), to functionally test whether these cells express suboptimal levels of any of the known HCV entry factors, we transiently transfected PLC, Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells with vectors expressing the four known human HCV receptors and reassessed their permissiveness for HCVpp and HCVcc infection 48 h post-transfection. As shown, expression of HCV entry factors in trans individually ( Figure 3 ) or in combination (data not shown) did not enhance HCVpp ( Figure 3A -C) or i. and HCV RNA was quantified by RTqPCR, normalized to GAPDH and is displayed as HCV RNA copies/\u03bcg total cellular RNA (means \u00b1 SD for triplicate samples). Significant increases in HCV RNA levels compared to CHO cells (one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc t test) are denoted as * p value < 0.001. Dashed line represents background levels of non-specific bound HCV RNA.",

Since both PLC and Hep3B cells appear to be entry competent to reasonable degrees, their more significantly reduced permissiveness for HCVcc infection compared to Huh7 cells may be due to defects in HCV RNA replication. To determine their capacity to support HCV RNA replication, PLC and Hep3B cells were transfected with HCV genotype 2a subgenomic (sg2a) replicon in vitro-transcribed RNA, and G418-resistant colony formation was determined as has been previously described for Huh7 [37] and HepG2 cells [18] . HCV sg2a replicons could be readily established in both cell lines; however, the ratio of colony formation to \u03bcg of in vitro-transcribed RNA was considerably lower in both Hep3B and PLC cells compared to Huh7 cells ( Figure 4A ). Since this reduction could be attributed to differences in transfection efficiency, we introduced HCV by an alternative means in which PLC and Hep3B cells were infected with medium from Huh7 cells replicating the full length 2a (fl2a) HCV replicon that contains infectious HCVcc capable of conferring G418 resistance to newly infected cells if entry is achieved and replication is established [38] . Unlike the results obtained following transfection of PLC and Hep3B cells with sg2a RNA, the number of G418-resistant colonies established in both PLC and Hep3B cells infected with HCVcc G418 was more comparable to that achieved in Huh7 cells ( Figure 4B ), although a 65% reduction in Hep3B colony formation was noted (p = 0.02). We next expanded some of these G418-resistant sg2a and fl2a PLC and Hep3B clones and quantified HCV RNA levels in each clone to determine steady-state HCV RNA replication levels achieved in each cell line. RTqPCR analysis revealed relatively similar levels of HCV sg2a RNA replication in all three cell lines, with no significant difference (p value > 0.05) in mean HCV RNA copies/\u03bcg intracellular RNA observed between Huh7, PLC and Hep3B G418-resistant sg2a clones ( Figure 4C ; 5.9 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 7.2 \u00d7 10 3 vs. 3.9 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 6.0 \u00d7 10 5 and 6.7 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 2.4 \u00d7 10 6 , respectively). Likewise, no significant difference (p value > 0.05) in the levels of intracellular HCV RNA in fl2a HCVcc G418 -established clones was observed between Huh7, PLC and Hep3B G418-resistant fl2a clones ( Figure 4D ; 4.5 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 1.8 \u00d7 10 4 vs. 3.9 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 6.7 \u00d7 10 4 and 5.8 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 1.4 \u00d7 10 6 HCV RNA copies/\u03bcg, respectively). Importantly, since G418-resistant colony formation following HCVcc G418 infection is dependent on both successful viral entry and efficient HCV RNA replication, the fact that similar numbers of G418-resistant colonies and equal levels of HCV RNA replication were achieved in both PLC and Hep3B, compared to Huh7 cells, would indicate that despite individual differences in the efficiency of HCV entry or HCV replication between these cell lines together the cumulative efficiency of HCVcc entry plus subsequent RNA replication is relatively equivalent in PLC, Hep3B, and Huh7 cells, thus allowing equivalent stable infection initiation events to occur (i.e. fl2a colony formation). However, to rule out the possibility that HCVcc G418 infection could have selected for a population of PLC or Hep3B cells with enhanced efficiency for viral entry and/or replication, we cured fl2a PLC and Hep3B replicon clones by IFNtreatment and re-assessed their permissiveness for HCVcc infection. As shown in Additional file 1: Figure  S4 , none of the IFN-cured fl2a clones showed enhanced permissiveness for HCVcc infection compared to their parental control.",

Therefore, the 1.5 and 3 log reduction in HCVcc permissiveness observed for the PLC and Hep3B cell lines, respectively ( Figure 1A ), is likely attributable to a defect (s) in a post replication step, such as assembly and/or egress of de novo HCVcc. To monitor multiple rounds of HCV infection and spread, which is dependent on HCV assembly and egress, we performed a kinetic analysis of HCV infection over the course of 7 days in Huh7, PLC, Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells after infection with HCVcc at a low MOI ( Figure 5 ). Using this approach, we show that intracellular HCV RNA levels ( Figure 5A ) in Huh7 cells infected with HCVcc at an MOI of 0.1 FFU/ cell reached 4.44 \u00d7 10 3 \u00b1 4.84 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcg RNA by one day p.i. and increased exponentially thereafter 3,000-fold reaching a steady-state level of 1.6 \u00d7 10 7 \u00b1 2.0 \u00d7 10 6 copies/\u03bcg RNA by day 5 p.i. HCV-infected PLC cells showed parallel but slightly reduced HCV RNA expansion kinetics during the first 48 h p.i. compared to HCV-infected Huh7 cells; however, by day 3 p.i., HCV RNA levels began to decline reaching undetectable levels by day 7 p.i. In HCV-infected Hep3B cells, following a 1-2 log increase in HCV RNA levels during the first 72 h p. i., HCV RNA reached and maintained a low steady-state level of~2.1 \u00d7 10 3 \u00b1 6.9 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcg RNA. Similarly HepG2-CD81 cells clearly lacked a notable robust expansion in HCV RNA levels after 24 h p.i. and maintained a low steady-state level (1.6 \u00d7 10 3 \u00b1 7.1 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcg RNA) until day 7 p.i. Likewise, when entry was bypassed by transfecting cells with infectious full-length HCV JFH-1 in vitro-transcribed RNA, a similar profile of RNA expansion and kinetics was observed (Additional file 1: Figure S5 ).",

Consistent with the data shown in the 7 day low MOI infection experiment ( Figure 5C ), increasing infectious HCVcc levels were detected in the supernatant of HCVinfected Huh7 cells; however, at no time p.i. did we detect infectious HCVcc in the culture supernatants from HCV-infected PLC cells ( Figure 6A ). To determine whether non-infectious HCVcc virions were secreted from the infected PLC cells, supernatants were treated with S7 Micrococcal nuclease, RNA extracted and HCV genome copies quantified by RTqPCR. As shown in Figure 6B , extracellular nuclease-protected HCV RNA (i.e. encapsidated viral RNA) was detected in culture supernatant harvested from HCV-infected Huh7 cells, and levels exponentially increased over the course of infection, consistent with the production and excretion of de novo infectious HCVcc. In HCV-infected PLC cells, however, significantly lower levels of nuclease-protected HCV RNA were detected with a modest exponential increase in total copies observed between days 1 and 3. Notably, if the HCV RNA present in the PLC cell supernatant did reflect infectious HCVcc, the level of infectivity (~1-2 FFU/ml) would be below the level of detection in our titration assay (10 FFU/ml). Thus, we can not conclude from this whether the low level of HCV RNA secreted by PLC cells represents infectious or non-infectious virions. To assess the presence and infectivity of intracellular HCV virions, cells were washed extensively with 1 \u00d7 PBS, trypsinized, resuspended in 10% cDMEM, pelleted at 1,400 RPM for 5 min and resuspended cell pellets subjected to multiple freeze thaws. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the presence of infectious HCVcc in cleared lysates was determined by foci titration analysis and the presence of non-infectious HCV by RNA analysis following S7 Micrococcal nuclease treatment. As expected, increasing levels of infectious HCVcc and nuclease-protected HCV RNA were detected in intracellular lysates from HCV-infected Huh7 cells over the course of infection ( Figure 6C and 6D, respectively) . In HCV-infected PLC cells, low levels of infectious HCVcc were detectable only on days 3 and 4 p.i. (Figure 6C) , and similar to the levels of extracellular HCV RNA detected in culture supernatants ( Figure 6B ), low levels of nucleaseprotected HCV RNA were detected in intracellular lysates, again with a modest exponential increase in total copies observed between days 1 and 3. Together, these data indicate that the ability of PLC cells to efficiently encapsidate HCV RNA is markedly reduced compared to Huh7 cells, resulting in low to undetectable levels of secreted infectious de novo HCVcc.",

This has recently been demonstrated by Zhao et al., for murine coronavirus infection of different murine cell lines [43] . To determine if HCV differentially induces the expression of ISGs in Huh7, PLC, Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells following infection, we evaluated ISG56 mRNA induction by RTqPCR following infection of cells with HCVcc at an MOI of 1.0 FFU/cell. As shown in Figure 7 , ISG56 mRNA levels were not up-regulated in HCV-infected Huh7 cells and remained constant throughout the course of infection, indicating that as previously shown [44] , HCVcc does not induce an efficient innate interferon response in Huh7 cells. In contrast, induction of ISG56 was observed in the other three human hepatoma cell lines following HCVcc infection. Specifically, ISG56 mRNA levels were up-regulated 3-and 2-fold in Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells, respectively, as early as 24 h p.i. and reached a steady state level by 3 days post infection. The highest and most significant induction of ISG56, however, was observed in HCV-infected PLC cells. Notably, we have previously shown that IFN-mediated activation of the innate cellular interferon response inhibits HCV RNA replication and subsequent production of de novo HCV virions ( [45] and data not shown), thus the reduced steady-state HCVcc infection levels observed in Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells and the decline of HCV infection observed in PLC cells, despite these cells exhibiting comparable infection initiation permissiveness, may be at least in part a consequence of HCV-induced innate immune signaling in these hepatoma cell lines.",

In fact, HCV RNA levels exceeding 10 4 copies/\u03bcg RNA were detected in PLC cells 3 days post infection with HCVcc. When compared directly to Huh7 cells, however, it was apparent that HCVcc infection in both PLC and Hep3B cells was reduced (2.0 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 8.2 \u00d7 10 4 vs. 3.9 \u00d7 10 4 \u00b1 2.6 \u00d7 10 3 and 2.8 \u00d7 10 3 \u00b1 3.5 \u00d7 10 2 copies/ \u03bcg RNA, respectively). In addition, our initial screen also showed notable differences in permissiveness for HCVpp infection between these two cell lines. Specifically, HCVpp infectivity was~65% lower in PLC cells compared to HCVpp-infected Huh7 and Hep3B cells. However, although significant (p value = 0.03 and 0.02 for JFHpp and H77pp, respectively), we have seen similar variability in permissiveness for HCVpp infection even among fully HCVcc-permissive Huh7 cell lines from different laboratories (Additional file 1: Figure S3 and [34] ), indicating that this level of HCV entry should be sufficient to support robust HCVcc infection. Consistent with this hypothesis, permissiveness for HCVcc infection initiation was notably higher in PLC cells compared to HCV-infected Hep3B cells ( Figure 1B and 4B) , despite the lower permissiveness of the PLCs for HCVpp entry ( Figure 1A ). Taken together, the results from our initial screen (Figure 1 ) indicated that PLC and Hep3B cells are indeed permissive for both HCVpp and HCVcc infection; however, differences in permissiveness compared to Huh7 cells and between each cell line do exist, and thus we initiated a systematic analysis of PLC and Hep3B permissiveness for HCVcc infection, performing experiments that focused on the different steps of the viral lifecycle (i.e. entry, replication, egress and spread).",

To determine if the differences in HCVpp and HCVcc infection between each hepatoma cell line could be attributed to entry factors already shown to modulate HCV permissiveness in other hepatoma cell lines [25, 32, [48] [49] [50] [51] , we examined the expression of four essential HCV entry factors (i.e. CD81, SR-BI, CLDN1 and OCLN) by RTqPCR, flow cytometric and immunofluorescence analysis ( Figure 2 ). Interestingly, the data indicated that when compared to the fully permissive Huh7 cell line, no obvious differences in mRNA level or cell surface expression of CD81, SR-BI, CLDN1 or OCLN was observed in PLC, Hep3B or HepG2-CD81 cells. In addition, we over-expressed each of the four HCV entry factors in each cell line since we and others have shown that expression of HCV entry factors in trans can enhance HCVpp and HCVcc entry in cells where HCV permissiveness is low [25, 32, 34] . Consistent with the observation that these cell lines already express the necessary levels of the four HCV entry factors, over-expression of CD81, SR-BI, CLDN1 or OCLN individually or in combination did not significantly increase HCVpp or HCVcc entry in any of the hepatoma cell lines (Figure 3) . Hence, the current data indicate that this panel of hepatoma cell lines expresses the minimum set of known entry factors necessary for efficient HCV entry. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the cells tested are deficient in another HCV entry factor (e.g. the transferin receptor 1 protein [52] or the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 cholesterol absorption receptor [53] , which we recently showed to be HCV entry factors), entry cofactors (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor and ephrin receptor A2 [54] ) or a post entry host cellular protein required for efficient viral fusion or nucleocapsid uncoating.",

To examine HCV replication independent of inherent differences in PLC and Hep3B cell transfection efficiency, we took advantage of the G418-selectable HCVcc G418 virus [38] , which can be used to establish HCV fl2a replicon cells via direct infection of cells rather than electroporation. Using this approach, 88, 77 and 52 G418-resistant colonies were formed in Huh7, PLC and Hep3B cultures, respectively, 3 weeks following infection with 100 FFU of HCVcc G418 ( Figure 4B ). Additional analysis of HCV RNA replication levels in selected fl2a clones revealed that comparable levels of HCV RNA replication were achieved in all three cell lines ( Figure 4D ). Likewise similar levels of intracellular HCV RNA were achieved in sg2a replicon cell clones ( Figure 4C ). Importantly, since G418-resistant colony formation following HCVcc G418 infection is dependent on both successful viral entry and efficient HCV RNA replication, the fact that similar numbers of G418-resistant colonies and equal levels of HCV RNA replication were achieved in both PLC and Hep3B cells, compared to Huh7 cells, indicate that the cumulative efficiency of viral entry plus subsequent RNA replication initiation is relatively equivalent between PLC, Hep3B and Huh7 cells.",

By performing a 7 day low MOI infection assay, we were able to assess the efficiency of viral spread by assessing intracellular HCV RNA expansion relative to de novo infectious HCVcc production and by visualizing viral spread directly by immunostaining for HCV-positive cells. Analysis of HCV RNA replication following infection of each cell line with HCVcc ( Figure 5A ) or electroporation with full-length infectious HCV JFH-1 in vitro-transcribed RNA (Additional file 1: Figure S5 ) revealed that while intracellular HCV RNA initially increased in all the infected/transfected cell cultures at different rates, it was only in Huh7 cultures where HCV RNA levels continued to increase exponentially past day 2 or 3 post infection/transfection. Notably, exponential increase of viral RNA in these cultures after day 2-3 p.i. would require spread of the virus from the original infected/ transfected cells. Consistent with this, HCV E2 staining on day 5 post-HCVcc infection revealed that the vast majority of Huh7 cells were HCV-positive while little to no spread was evident in the PLC, Hep3B or HepG2-CD81 cell cultures ( Figure 5B ). Thus, while infection could be initiated in all these cell lines, only Huh7 cells appeared to support efficient viral spread. Since spread of HCV to na\u00efve cells following infection is dependent on secretion of de novo infectious virions, we measured infectious HCVcc in the supernatant of infected cultures and observed detectable but reduced levels of infectious HCVcc in Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 culture supernatants and undetectable levels of HCVcc in infected PLC cultures ( Figure 5C ). Low steady-state levels of intracellular HCV RNA and infectious virus production in the Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells could result from a defect/bottleneck in any phase of the viral life cycle (e.g. reduced and/or ISG inhibition of entry, replication or secretion); however, since the cumulative efficiency of viral entry plus subsequent initiation of HCV RNA replication appears to be relatively equivalent between Hep3B, HepG2-CD81 and Huh7 cells ( Figure 4B ), it is reasonable to speculate that robust HCV infection in Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells may be limited by a decreased capacity for virus production compared to Huh7 cells. Of course, in the case of PLC cells, there was a clear and severe defect in HCVcc virus production. Not only were no infectious particles detected in the supernatant of infected cultures ( Figure 5B and 6A ), but analysis of HCVcc present within the cell revealed low to undetectable levels of intracellular infectious virions ( Figure 6C ) and comparably low levels of encapsidated HCV RNA in both these extra-and intra-cellular samples ( Figure 6B and 6D) suggesting virion assembly is restricted at or before genome encapsidation.",

            "text": "i. ISG induction. Since induction of innate immune signaling can have negative affects on multiple steps in the HCV lifecycle, we assessed the ability of PLC, Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells to mount an innate immune response against HCV infection by measuring ISG56 mRNA induction, as a representative ISG, following HCVcc infection. Importantly, while no induction of ISG56 was observed in Huh7 cells, as previously published [44] , ISG56 mRNA was up-regulated in HCVinfected PLC, Hep3B and HepG2 cells, with PLC cells exhibiting the most significant induction following HCVcc infection (Figure 7) . Although it is generally believed that most cultured hepatoma cells generally are impaired for poly(I-C)-and virus-activated IFN responses [55] , these results are consistent with previous findings that IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity is more potently induced in HepG2 and Hep3B cells than in Huh7 cells following either liposome-mediated transfection of poly (I-C) or Sendai virus infection [56] . Relevant to this, a more recent publication by Marukian et al. [57] shows a correlation between innate antiviral gene induction and impaired HCV replication and spread in primary liver cells. Likewise, HCV spread was not observed in highly differentiated microscale primary human hepatocyte cultures described by Ploss et al., (2010) , who speculated that while the expression of viral proteins in the initially infected cells might be sufficient to blunt intracellular antiviral signaling and allow sustained viral replication, interferon produced by the infected cell may be sufficient to signal to/activate adjacent na\u00efve cells rendering them resistant to infection and thus limiting subsequent viral spread [58] . Thus, the differences in ISG induction observed between these cells lines (Figure 7 ) may keep HCV replication lower on a per cell basis (Hep3B and HepG2-CD81) and/or at higher levels successfully inhibit viral replication in the infected cells sufficiently to contribute to clearance of the infection (PLC).",

While ISGs are well known negative determinants of HCV permissiveness, numerous positive determinants required for efficient HCV replication have also been identified (reviewed in [59] ). Although overlap between independent studies is not often observed, leaving the relevance of many of these factors to be confirmed, new data from multiple laboratories has recently demonstrated that human micro RNA (miR122) is a critical liver-specific factor required for robust HCV infection and secretion [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] . Because IFN treatment has been shown to reduce miR122 expression in Huh7 cells [66] , it is possible that the enhanced ISG induction observed in the other three cell lines may more potently reduce this important positive regulator of HCV infection. Likewise, miR122 has been shown to play an important role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis, fatty acid metabolism and lipogenesis [63] [64] [65] 67] , three lipid metabolic pathways shown to be necessary for HCV replication, assembly and secretion. In fact, just prior to submitting this manuscript, Evans and colleagues and Matsuura and colleagues separately showed that exogenously expressing human miR122 in HepG2 or Hep3B cells, respectively, results in robust HCV replication and infectious virus secretion following HCVcc inoculation or HCV RNA transfection [19, 20] . Hence, lack of adequate miR122 may also contribute to the reduced HCV permissiveness of certain cell lines.",

The permissiveness of PLC and Hep3B cells for HCVcc infection is clearly less robust than that achieved in the highly HCVcc-permissive Huh7 cell lines [34] and while further studies are needed to definitively and quantitatively assess the host cell factors that limit HCV infection in these cells, these two hepatoma cell lines nonetheless provide new in vitro tools for elucidating the cellular factors that control or mediate HCV infection, particularly those associated with HCV ISG induction or those involved in de novo HCVcc production and secretion. In addition, HCV sub-genomic and fulllength replicons have not been previously established in Hep3B and PLC cells [33] . Thus, the clones generated in this study add to the current repertoire of sub-genomic and full-length HCV replicons already available to study specific aspects of the HCV life cycle such as HCV polyprotein processing, replication complex formation and HCV RNA replication. Expanding our arsenal of reagents and cell lines amendable for the study of HCV should certainly advance our overall understanding of the HCV viral life cycle and the cellular determinants involved, facilitating the potential development of new and more specific HCV antivirals.",
