In this study, a cytopathic-effect-based, high-throughput screening assay was developed and applied to screen JEV inhibitors from Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds 1280. The antiviral effects of three hit compounds including FGIN-1-27, cilnidipine, and niclosamide were evaluated in cells by western blotting, indirect immunofluorescence assay, and plaque reduction assay. A time-of-addition assay proved that all three compounds inhibited JEV at the stage of replication. The EC50s of FGIN-1-27, cilnidipine, and niclosamide were 3.21, 6.52, and 5.80 mM, respectively, while the selectivity indexes were 38.79, 30.67, and 7.49. FGIN-1-27 and cilnidipine have high efficiency and selectivity against JEV. This study provided two JEV antiviral inhibitors as candidates for treatment of JEV infection.",

JEV can cause severe central nervous disorders such as poliomyelitis-like paralysis, aseptic meningitis, and encephalitis in humans. The fatality rate caused by JEV is 10-50% and half of the survivors have severe neurological sequelae, including persistent motor defects and severe cognitive and language impairments [3] . The geographic range of JEV is still expanding with an enhanced threat, and JEV infections have been reported in Australia [4, 5] , Pakistan [6] , and Saipan [7] in the past 30 years. Therefore, JEV is still an important pathogen that has global health significance.",

Although vaccines have reduced the incidence of JE in some countries, they seem not to be effective against all the clinical isolates [10] . In August 2006, there was an outbreak of JEV in Shanxi Province, China, which caused 66 cases and 19 deaths [11] . There is an urgent need for antiviral agents that can reduce the death toll and neurological sequelae of JEV infection [12] . Two anti-hepatitis C virus drugs targeting viral protease, telaprevir VX-950 (developed by Vertex) and boceprevir SCH503034 (developed by Merck), won approval in 2011 [13] . Various effective inhibitors against DENV and WNV have also been identified as drug candidates [14, 15] . In recent studies, some agents were found to have good antiviral effects against JEV. Indirubin, derived from Isatis indigotica extract, was proved to have inhibitory effects on JEV in vitro with less cytotoxicity [16] . Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) suppressed the replication and virus-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells by acting on the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase [17] . N-nonyl-deoxynojirimycin affected the interaction between calnexin (endoplasmic reticulum chaperone) and JEV glycoproteins (premembrane, envelope, and non-structural protein 1), and thus had anti-JEV effects both in vitro and in vivo [18] . SCH 16, a derivative of N-methylisatin-b-thiosemicarbazone, inhibited 50% of the plaques produced by JEV at a concentration of 16 mg/ mL (0.000025 mM) [19] . However, there are currently only a small number of JEV inhibitors available for drug development.",

In these compounds, seven compounds were selected for a second screening according three criterions: (1) the compounds had an inhibition rate at about 50%; (2) the compounds showed inhibitory effect to JEV in at least two concentrations; (3) there had normal cells without cytopathic-changes observed by microcopy. After the second screening, four compounds were confirmed to have about 50% CPE inhibition at two concentrations ( Figure 1D ). The antiviral effects of three commercial available compounds, cilnidipine, FGIN-1-27 (N,N-dihexyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)indole-3acetamide), and niclosamide, were identified by western blotting, IFA, plaque reduction assay, and time-of-addition assays in the subsequent studies.

As a control, the virus titer in the untreated group was 2.7610 6 PFU/mL (data not show).",

Variations from cell control (1.2660.45%) and virus infected control (5.7260.23%) were no more than 10%. In addition, the similar Z9, S/B, and CV values were obtained in the HTS of 1280 compounds, which demonstrated that this assay was reliable for large scale screening of antiviral inhibitors.

Especially in the CC50 analysis, the three tested compounds were proven to have more or less cytotoxicity at 50 mM to cells (Fig. 6B, D and F) .
