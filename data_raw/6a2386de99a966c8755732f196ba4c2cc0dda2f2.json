Although several genes are commonly used as reference genes (such as GAPDH, ACTB, and 18S rRNA), they are also regulated and can be expressed at varying levels. In this study, we evaluated twelve well-known reference genes to identify the most suitable housekeeping gene for normalization of qRT-PCR in human lumbar vertebral endplate with Modic changes, by using the geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms. Our results showed that the rarely-used SDHA was the most stable single reference gene, and a combination of three, SDHA, B2M, and LDHA, was the most suitable gene set for normalization in all samples. In addition, the commonly-used genes, GAPDH, ACTB and 18S rRNA, were all inappropriate as internal standards. The rankings of reference genes for the three types of Modic change differed, although SDHA and RPL13A uniformly ranked in the first and last position, respectively. Further simulated expression analysis validated that the arbitrary use of a reference gene could lead to the misinterpretation of data. Our study confirmed the necessity of exploring the expression stability of potential reference genes in each specific tissue and experimental situation before quantitative evaluation of gene expression by qRT-PCR.",

            "text": "Signal intensity changes in the vertebral endplate and subchondral bone marrow on magnetic resonance imaging, also known as Modic changes (MCs), are often observed in patients with degenerative spinal diseases [1] . Three different types have been described. Type I changes are hypointense on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and indicate edema and hypervascularity in the lesions as confirmed histologically. Type II changes are hyperintense on T1WI and isointense or hyperintense on T2WI and reflect fatty replacement of the red bone marrow. Type III changes are hypointense on both T1WI and T2WI and represent subchondral bone sclerosis. MCs are strongly associated with intervertebral disc degeneration and low back pain [2] [3] [4] . Identification of the mechanisms and factors involved in the progression of MCs is of great importance for clinical interventions to repair or retard the development of MCs. To exploit the mechanisms of MCs, it is necessary to understand the pathophysiological changes of the vertebral cartilage endplate with MCs at the molecular level.",

Gene expression analysis in cartilage has been satisfactorily performed in recent years since the major problem of poor ribonucleic acid (RNA) content in human cartilage is compensated by improving the RNA yield and quality and via cDNA amplification by in vitro transcription [7] [8] [9] [10] . Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is currently one of the most precise and frequently-used methods to study the expression profiles of genes; it can quantify both the absolute and relative amounts of a gene's RNA [11, 12] . Relative quantification is more common in qRT-PCR, and its accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility are highly dependent on the choice of suitable internal controls within each sample to normalize experimental variations [13] . The use of reference genes can correct biases caused by variations in RNA input, or reverse transcription efficiency, or amplification efficiency.",

Amplification was performed with an initial holding period at 95uC for 2 min, followed by a two-step PCR program consisting of 95uC for 5 s and 60uC for 34 s for 40 cycles. After 40 cycles, a melting analysis was performed by heating the amplicon from 60uC to 95uC. A reverse transcriptase negative control was included to ensure the absence of genomic DNA contamination, and the no-template control was also run to exclude contamination or dimer formation for each primer pair. The amplification specificity was confirmed by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis of the products. For each primer pair, a series of 10-fold of three dilutions of cDNA (10-to 1,000-fold dilution) were made to generate a standard curve. The PCR amplification efficiency (E) was determined by the slope of the standard curve: E(%) = (10 [21/slope] 21)6100%.",

The sequence from most to least stable was SDHA, B2M, LDHA, TBP, GUSB, GAPDH, IPO8, HMBS, ACTB, HPRT1, 18S rRNA, and RPL13A, with the largest M value being 0.97 for RPL13A (Figure 2A) .

Our results, however, further confirmed the necessity of assessing the reference genes in each tissue and experimental condition. Yet there were discrepancies between our results and the published data for hip and knee cartilage. They concluded that RPL13A is among the most stable reference genes, while SDHA is not. On the contrary, we found that SDHA was the most stable while RPL13A the most unstable. Thus, in tissues from different anatomical regions, hip and knee joint cartilage versus lumbar vertebral endplate cartilage, the stability of reference genes is different.",

GeNorm analyzes the expression stability of the tested genes in all samples, and ranks them according to a stability measure [16] . In contrast, NormFinder evaluates the expression stability of each single reference gene independently, and takes into account intra-and inter-group variations for normalization [13] . While BestKeeper analyzes the stability of candidate reference genes depending on the standard deviation and coefficient of variance of their Ct values. Together they seek genes with stable expression levels, by either the relative stability with reference to other candidates, or to clinically-relevant groups, or to their intrinsic degree of variation [13, 16, 22] . The use of these programs provides complementary information. Because of the distinct statistical algorithms used by these three programs, it was not surprising that they gave somewhat different results. Nevertheless, there was general agreement; SDHA was in the top two positions and RPL13A in the last two in all samples and subsets for these three programs.",
