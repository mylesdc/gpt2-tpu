However, because endogenous bovine immunoglobulin light chain loci are still intact, the light chains are produced both from the hIGK and hIGL genomic loci on the HAC and from the endogenous bovine kappa-chain (bIGK) and lambda-chain (bIGL) genomic loci, resulting in the production of fully hIgGs (both Ig heavy-chains and light-chains are of human origin: hIgG/hIgk or hIgG/hIgl) and chimeric hIgGs (Ig heavy-chains are of human origin while the Ig light-chains are of bovine origin: hIgG/bIgk or hIgG/bIgl). To improve fully hIgG production in Tc cattle, we here report the deletion of the entire bIGL joining (J) and constant (C) gene cluster (bIGLJ1-IGLC1 to bIGLJ5-IGLC5) by employing Cre/loxP mediated site-specific chromosome recombination and the production of triple knockout (bIGHM 2/2 , bIGHML1 2/2 and bIGL 2/2 ; TKO) Tc cattle. We further demonstrate that bIGL cluster deletion greatly improves fully hIgGs production in the sera of TKO Tc cattle, with 51.3% fully hIgGs (hIgG/hIgk plus hIgG/hIgl).",

            "text": "Human polyclonal antibodies (hpAbs or hIgGs) prepared from plasma donated from the general population or convalescing human donors have been widely used to treat several human diseases, such as autoimmunity, immunodeficiency and infection [1] . In the case of a medical emergency crisis, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks or the most recent outbreak of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), where no effective treatment is available, hIgGs have been shown to be a life saving measure [2] ; Hilgenfeld, R and Peiris, M. 2013). Unfortunately, due to the voluntarily nature of plasma donation, hIgGs and convalescent plasma can be difficult to source. We previously reported our success in creating double knockout (DKO) transchromosomic (Tc) cattle that produce physiological levels of hIgGs (Sano A et al., 2013). These Tc cattle were engineered by homozygous knockout of both of the bovine immunoglobulin mu heavy-chain genes, bIGHM and bIGHML1 (bIGHM 2/2 , bIGHML1 2/2 ; DKO) and by reconstituting B cell function with a human artificial chromosome (HAC) comprising the entire unrearranged human immunoglobulin heavy-chain (hIGH), kappa-chain (hIGK), and lambda-chain (hIGL) germline loci. However, as the bovine endogenous immunoglobulin light-chain loci, the lambda (bIGL) locus and the kappa (bIGK) locus, are intact in these Tc cattle, the light-chains are expressed both from hIGK and hIGL loci on the HAC and from the endogenous bIGL and bIGK loci, resulting in a mixture of hIgGs composing fully hIgGs (both the heavy-chains and light-chains are of human origin: hIgG/hIgk and hIgG/hIgl) and chimeric hIgGs (only the heavy-chains are of human origin but the light-chains are of bovine origin: hIgG/bIgk and hIgG/bIgl). Specifically, when the hIgG isotype was analyzed in the sera of Tc bovine, hIgG/bIgl accounted for about 70% and hIgG/bIgk accounted for about 10% of the total hIgGs, respectively, while fully hIgG only accounted for about 20% of the total hIgGs (Sano A et al., 2013). We reasoned that the human immunoglobulin light-chain genes carried on the HAC are controlled by human regulatory sequences and may be at a disadvantage in competing with the endogenous bovine immunoglobulin light-chain genes for expression in the bovine B cell environment. As bIgl is the predominantly expressed light-chain isotype in bovine B cells, we further reasoned that inactivation of bovine lambda light-chain genes, in addition to the KO of the two bIGHM and bIGHML1 loci, would dramatically improve fully hIgG production in the resulting Tc cattle.",

            "text": "We previously developed a sequential gene targeting strategy and succeeded in producing cloned cattle carrying homozygous knockout of both the immunoglobulin mu and the prion proteins [3] . One of the core components of this sequential gene targeting strategy is to use embryonic cloning by CT to rejuvenate the genetically modified cells following each round of gene targeting [3, 4] . This sequential gene targeting strategy overcomes the limitation set by the cellular senesce program in cultured somatic cells and, in theory, allows one to sequentially modify the genome of somatic cells as many rounds as one wishes. However, as every round of gene targeting requires a round of embryonic cloning by CT to rejuvenate the cells, our recent results showed that cumulative epigenetic errors can be introduced into the (re)cloned cells at each round of embryonic cloning, which in turn severely compromises the developmental competence of the cloned embryos reconstituted from such sequentially (re)cloned cells (our unpublished data). As the goal of this project was to produce TKO Tc cattle where the two bIGH loci, IGHM and IGHML, and the bIGL locus, IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster, were to be homozygously inactivated, it would take four rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning to KO the IGHM and IGHML loci and another four more rounds to KO the bIGL locus (see below for details), entailing eight rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning in total. Even though we succeeded in cloning transgenic cattle after seven rounds of embryonic cloning, the cloning efficiency was extremely low [5] . Therefore, we designed a new sequential gene targeting strategy by incorporating animal breeding as an integral component. Specifically, after two to three rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning, live animals were produced by CT and raised to sexual maturity for breeding. It is believed, and has been proven by us (our unpublished data), that germline transmission of the cloned genome erases the epigenetic errors acquired from cloning. Therefore, primary cell lines carrying the introduced genetic modifications can be established from the fetuses produced from breeding (we call the cell lines established from fetuses produced by fertilization G0 cell lines) and more rounds of genetic modifications can proceed (i.e. G1, G2\u2026). Figure 1A depicts the gene targeting scheme that we undertook to sequentially KO the bIGHM, IGHML1 and IGL loci for producing TKO cell lines. Of note, contrary to what has been reported by others that the IGHML1 locus was mapped on bovine chromosome 11 (bChr11) (Hosseini, A et al. 2004), our sequence analysis of the bovine IGHM and IGHML1 loci demonstrated that both of these loci are located on bChr21 (our unpublished data). Such chromosomal localization dictates that the IGHM and IGHML1 loci segregate together during meiosis, allowing us to implement the animal breeding-assisted sequential gene targeting strategy and calculate the probability of the desired genotypes of fetuses produced by breeding (hence the cell lines established from the fetuses) of these two genomic loci as depicted in Figure 1B .",

Sequence analysis ( Figure S3 ) led to the identification of the entire bovine IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster composed of the five IGLJ-IGLC genes (IGLJ1-IGLC1 through IGLJ5-IGLC5) ( Figure 1C ). Among them, IGLJ2-IGLC2, IGLJ3-IGLC3 and IGLJ4-IGLC4 appeared to be functional genes as judged by their uninterrupted reading frames coding for functional proteins ( Figure 1C ). On the other hand, both the IGLJ1-IGLC1 and IGLJ5-IGLC5 genes contain immature stop codon mutations, indicating that they are pseudo genes. We also identified a potential enhancer element, 39El, about 13 kb downstream of the IGLJ5-IGLC5 gene that shares ,60% DNA sequence homology with the human 39El (HSS-3) enhancer sequence.

            "text": "Compared to the report by Chen, L et al. where four IGLJ-IGLC genes were identified in the bovine [6] , we identified five IGLJ-IGLC genes based on our sequence data. We found that there is a duplication of the originally identified IGLJ2-IGLC2 by Chen et al. and that the duplicated genes are identical in their exon sequences but are subtly different in their intron and 39 untranslated region (UTR) sequences. As such, we concluded that this is a distinct IGLJ-IGLC gene from IGLJ2-IGLC2 and defined it as IGLJ3-IGLC3. Our sequence analysis also indicates that this gene is located about 4 kb downstream of IGLJ2-IGLC2 ( Figure 1C ). The discrepancy on the numbers of IGLJ gene unites in the bIGL locus between what was found by Chen et al. and by us is likely attributed to the fact that the coding sequences of IGLJ2-IGLC2 and IGLJ3-IGLC3 exons are identical and were not detected as distinct gene units by Chen L et al. However, our detailed sequence analysis showed that these two gene units are different in the sequences of introns and 39 UTRs (Figure S1 Panels A and B). Our interpretation of the structure of the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster was further supported by Southern blot data we produced from analyzing the genomic DNA isolated from fibroblast cells derived both from Holstein and Jersey breed cattle ( Figure 2 ). Due to the relatively short shotgun sequences (1.5-3.0 kb by Chen et al.), genes with high sequence homologies, such as between IGLJ2-IGLC2 and IGLJ3-IGLC3, may not be readily identified as distinct genes if the sequence assembled from shotgun sequencing is the only resource used for characterizing a genomic locus. Therefore, our Southern blot data provided unequivocal support for our conclusion that there are five IGLJ-IGLC genes (IGLJ1-IGLC1 through IGLJ5-IGLC5) in the bovine genome.",

To this end, we designed and constructed knock in (KI) vectors to integrate loxP sequences, one at 129 bp 59 of the bIGLJ-IGLC1 gene and another at 295 bp 39 of IGLJ5-IGLC5 gene, through homologous recombination to flank the entire bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster ( Figure 3 ). For aiding the identification of cell clones in which the correct bIGLJ-IGLC cluster deletion occurred, we designed the two loxP KI vectors in such a way that the promoterless puromycin gene (puro) introduced by the KI vector pC l1 CAGzeoPuro loxP DT would be activated by the CAG Figure 1 . The chromosome engineering strategy including pedigree and deduced structure of bovine chromosomes for knockouts is shown. (A) Breeding pedigree to establish G0 TKO cell lines. Male cell line 6939 and female cell line 3427 were sequentially targeted to obtain IGHM 2/+ IGHML1 2/2 and IGHM 2/2 animals, respectively, for the first round of breeding, which generated both male and female G0 IGHM 2/2 IGHML1 2/+ cell lines. These cell lines were subjected to the cluster deletion to generate IGHM 2/2 IGHML1 2/+ IGL 2/+ animals for the second round of breeding, which led to establishment of male and female G0 TKO cell lines. (B) Deduced structure of the bovine IGH gene cluster on bChr21. BAC clone 227-A16 contained part of the IGH variable region and the IGHML1 through the C c1 region. BAC includes the C c2 through the 39E a region. The size of the three BAC clones contiguously is estimated to be around 380 kb. (C) Genomic organization of the bovine IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster on bChr17. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0090383.g001 . The most significant difference in the fragment is the presence or absence of 6.3 kb EcoRI fragment stained with probe that was prepared based on bovine IGLC sequence(GenBank promoter introduced by the KI vector pC l5 CAG loxP neoDT when the Cre-mediated DNA recombination occurred between the two loxP sites introduced by these two KI vectors ( Figure 3 ). We conducted bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster deletions both in a male cell line, J481 (IGHM 2/2 IGHML1 2/+ ), and a female cell line, H412 (IGHM 2/2 IGHML1 2/+ ), which were established above. For distinguishing the bIGL alleles in these two cell lines where single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified ( Figure 4 ) and for designing and constructing allele-specific KI vectors, we designated the bIGL alleles in J481 as A and D, and those in H412 as B and C, respectively ( Figure 4A ; only A and D alleles in J481 are depicted). To delete the bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster in the J481 cell line, we first transfected J481 cells with the allele A-specific KI vector, pC l1 (A)CAGzeoPuro loxP DT, to integrate the loxP sequence at a position 59 of the bIGLJ-IGLC1 gene. After selection of transfected cells with zeocin, the zeocin-resistant cell colonies were screened for the desired gene targeting event with genomic PCR. As depicted in ( Figure 4A ), we designed a pair of PCR primers, CL1puro-F2/CL1puro-R2, that specifically amplified the DNA sequence generated by the correct integration of the loxP sequence through homologous recombination at a position 59 of the bIGLJ1-IGLC1 gene. Following sequencing of the PCR products, 18% (25/140) of the zeocin-resistant colonies were confirmed to be correctly targeted. We also used another pair of PCR primers, R-R1 x R-F2, flanking the SNPs that distinguished the A and D alleles and specifically amplified the untargeted allele to investigate which of the two alleles were targeted. By sequencing the PCR products generated from this pair of primers, we identified a cell colony, #27, that was positive for the nucleotide G (specific to allele D) but negative for nucleotide T (specific to allele A) in the SNPs region, indicating that allele A was correctly targeted while allele D was intact ( Figure 4A ). We then subjected colony #27 to embryonic cloning to generate 40d fetuses from which five fibroblast cell lines were established. As expected, all five cell lines were confirmed to have the genotype IGHM 2/2 IGHML1 2/+ IGLC1 loxP . We chose one cell line, K655-1, to conduct subsequent gene targeting experiments.",

All of the 21 colonies were confirmed to carry the desired bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster deletion by PCR and subsequent sequencing of the PCR products. We then conducted embryonic cloning by using the cells from some of these positive colonies as chromatin donors and established multiple 40d cell lines (G2). As expected, genotyping analysis showed that all of these cell lines carried the bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster deletion as well as the inactivated alleles in the IGHM and IGHML1 loci introduced earlier, confirming the establishment of cell lines with the IGHM 2/2 IGHML1 2/+ IGL 2/+ genotype.

Similar to the experiments carried out in the male cell line, we confirmed allele-specific gene targeting by a pair of PCR primers (R-R1 x R-F2) which flank the SNPs distinguishing the B and C alleles and specifically amplifies the untargeted allele. We identified five colonies targeted to the Ballele as they were positive for nucleotide G (specific to allele C) but negative for nucleotide T (specific to allele B) in the SNPs region. We then subjected one colony, #97, to embryonic cloning by CT to generate 40d fetuses. We established five fibroblast cell lines from these fetuses and all of them were confirmed to be the IGHM 2/2 IGHML1 2/+ IGLJC1 loxP/+ genotype. We chose one cell line, H375-2, for subsequent gene targeting experiments.",

In this case, we co-transfected female H375-2 cell line with the pC l5 (B)CAG loxP neoDT KI vector, designed to be specific to allele B, and the Cre-expression plasmid and obtained 15 puromycin-resistant colonies. Genomic PCR screening was conducted using two pairs of PCR primers, CL5CAG-F2/CL5CAG-R2 and CAGpuro-F3/CAGpuro-R3 followed by sequencing of the PCR products which led to the identification of 6 colonies carrying the desired bIGLJ-IGLC gene cluster deletion. We subsequently established multiple 40d cell lines (G2) from some of these positive colonies by embryonic cloning. We confirmed the IGHM 2/2 IGHML1 2/+ IGL 2/+ genotype by genotype analysis as conducted in the male cell lines.

To address this problem, IgGs produced from hyper-immunized animals have been used as an alternative for treating certain human diseases for which it may be effective. One example is the use of IgGs prepared from plasma of immunized horses or sheep to treat severe envenomation resulting from snake and spider bites [9, 10] . While large quantities of IgGs can be produced from animals at relative low costs, animal derived IgGs are immunogenic in humans causing serum sickness, which not only reduces the efficacy of the IgGs but also places treated patients at risk of developing complications [11, 12] . We previously generated Tc cattle in which both of the two bovine Ig mu heavy-chain loci were homozygously inactivated by gene targeting (bIGHM 2/2 and bIGHML1 2/2 ) and the bovine immunoglobulin gene function was reconstituted by a HAC comprising the entire unrearranged germline loci of human immunoglobulin genes (Sano A et al., 2013) . We demonstrated that DKO Tc cattle produce physiological level of hIgGs. Furthermore, through immunization studies these Tc cattle were shown to be responsive to antigen challenge generating high titers and functional antigen-specific hIgGs. However, as the bovine endogenous immunoglobulin light-chain genes are intact in these Tc cattle and the bovine genes may be epigenetically favored for expression in bovine B cells (e.g. regulated by bovine transelements) over the human immunoglobulin light-chain genes carried by the HAC, the majority of hIgGs produced from these cattle were chimeric, with the IgG heavy-chain of human origin and light-chain of bovine origin (Sano A et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Obviously, further genetic inactivation of the bovine Ig lightchain genes would increase fully human IgG production in these Tc cattle. It has been well established that, between the two bovine Ig light-chain loci, bIGL and bIGK, the bIGL locus is the predominant bovine Ig light-chain over the bIGK locus, resulting in an Igl/Igk ratio of 91/9 in wild type cattle [13] . Therefore, as the next step towards fully hIgG production in Tc cattle, we chose to genetically inactivate the bovine bIGL locus. However, as there are about 25 lambda variable (IGLV) genes spanning about 400 kb in the bovine genome [7] , neither an individual KO nor a whole IGLV cluster deletion seemed to be a feasible approach. This is Figure 5 . Lack of bIGL expression in HAC/TKO calves by RT-PCR is shown. PBMCs from five HAC/TKO calves (Calf 1-5) at birth were subjected to RT-PCR to confirm lack of bIGL expression. The primer pairs, bIgL-Ld-F1x bIgL-C-R and L003-F2 x L004-R2, were used to amplify VJ-rearranged bIGL and constant region IGLC (bC l ) genes, respectively. The primer pair, bIgk-FR, was used to amplify VJ-rearranged bIGK gene. N, negative control; P, positive control. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0090383.g005 particularly true considering the fact that there are no precedent studies showing that the Cre/loxP strategy is effective in deleting large chromosomal fragments in somatic cells. Consequently, we decided to inactivate the bIGL locus by deleting the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster, as the size has been previously estimated to be approximately 18.6 kb (Chen L et al. 2008; our more detailed sequence analysis indicates it is about 27 kb; see results section of this manuscript). We reasoned that the relative smaller size of this locus compared to the IGLV locus could be more amenable to Cre/loxP-mediated deletion. Therefore, we conducted detailed characterization of the bovine IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster, which allowed us to design and construct the gene targeting vectors to completely delete this locus. We demonstrated that the Cre/loxP system was very effective in inducing chromosome deletions in a site-specific manner in primary somatic cells. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first demonstration of this application of the Cre/loxP system in cultured primary somatic cells in any mammalian species.",

Previously, we developed a sequential gene targeting strategy and achieved inactivation of up to six genomic loci in bovine somatic cells. However, if this sequential gene targeting strategy were followed in the instance of knocking out the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster, it would take ten rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning to homozygously inactivate the two IGH loci and delete the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster-four rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning would be needed to inactivate the four alleles of the IGH genes and six more rounds would be needed to homozygously delete the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster (deleting one allele requires two rounds of gene targeting and embryonic cloning to integrate the two loxP sequences at the 59 and 39 of the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster, respectively, and the induction of IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster deletion by transfecting cells with Cre expression vector requires another round of gene targeting and embryonic cloning; the same applies for the second allele also). To reduce the rounds of embryonic cloning and avoid the cumulative epigenetic errors that are introduced at each round of embryonic cloning, which can severely compromise the development potential of embryos reconstituted from the genetically modified cells by CT (our unpublished data), we decided to hemizygously delete the IGLJ-IGLC gene cluster in both a male and a female bovine cell line in which the IGHM and IGHML loci had been modified to produce male and female animals and breed them to produce homozygous offspring. To reduce the rounds of embryonic cloning even further, after integrating the first loxP sequence at 59 of the IGLJ1 gene, we co-transfected the second loxP KI vector with the Cre expression vector to achieve integration of the second loxP sequence and the subsequent deletion of the IGLJ-IGLC cluster between the two integrated loxP sequences with one round of cell transfection. We demonstrated that this strategy was very successful and allowed us to achieve the goal of producing Tc calves with both of the IGHM and IGHML loci and the IGL locus homozygous inactivated (IGHM 2/2 IGHML1 2/2 IGL 2/2 ).",

Therefore, through an unprecedented genome engineering effort in cattle, we succeeded in the establishment of a Tc bovine platform that is capable of efficiently producing fully hIgGs.

Therefore, we are working to homozygously inactivate the bIGK locus through gene targeting to produce quadruple bovine Ig gene KO (QKO) Tc cattle. We envision that the creation of QKO/Tc cattle will eliminate the need to purify fully human antibodies from the chimeric human antibodies. In addition, as an effort to improve fully human antibody production by Tc bovine, we have recently achieved the bovinization of some sequences on the HAC that are important for Ig function and/or expression, resulting in an average of over 80% of the serum IgGs produced from the TKO/Tc cattle to be fully human IgGs (manuscript in preparation).",

We screened the lambda phage library with 32 P labeled BCm-f2/BCm-r2 PCR product as the probe and identified multiple positive phage clones. We then subcloned a Sal I fragment (about 17 kb) isolated from a lambda clone (#7) into the Sal I site of pBluescript II SK(-). From this plasmid, a 9.8 kb BamHI fragment was further cloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript II SK(-).

(A) Integration of a loxP sequence 59 outside of the J l1 domain by the targeting vector pC l1 CAGzeoPuro loxP DT in cell line J481. The occurrence of homologous recombination was confirmed by genomic PCR, CL1puro-F2F2, as positive PCR. Furthermore, negative PCR, R-F2 x R-R1, was done to double check the homologous recombination because it can only be amplified from the wild type allele; J481 amplified this sequence from both alleles A and D, showing the double peaks (T for allele A and G for allele D). Colony #27 showed only ''G'', demonstrating that allele A was specifically knocked out while Colony #22 showed only ''T'', demonstrating that allele D was specifically knocked out. From colony #27, fetal cell line, K655-1, was established, which was positive with CL1puro-F2R2 primers.

In addition, in the newly engineered cKSL-HACD, the hIgM constant domain which is believed to be involved in the interaction between IgM and transmembrane a (Iga) and b immunoglobulins (Igb) in the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) complex was replaced by the bovine IgM constant domain, an effort for improving the interactions between hIgM and bovine Iga and Igb. In addition to the improved levels of hIgG production, this new version of HAC also dramatically improved B cell development in the DKO Tc cattle (Sano et al., 2013). Therefore, we transferred the cKSL-HACD from a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) master cell bank that we established (Sano et al., 2013) into the above established TKO bovine fibroblast cells by Micro-cell Mediated Chromosome Transfer (MMCT) and established cKSL-HACD/TKO fibroblast cell lines (see Materials and Methods section for details) for TKO Tc cattle production.
