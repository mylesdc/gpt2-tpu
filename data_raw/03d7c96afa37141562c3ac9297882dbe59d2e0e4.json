However, little is known about the GI pathogenesis of influenza viruses. It is possible that GI symptoms developed during the clinical course of influenza could either be a part of disease manifestation, due to the side effects of antibiotic treatment, or a co-infection with other diarrheal pathogens. Gastrointestinal manifestation associated with seasonal influenza has been recognised for more than 30 years [4] . During the influenza A epidemic of 1988 in Australia several children developed hemorrhagic gastritis of varying severity after a typical Influenza-like illness (ILI) [5] . Similarly, during the two epidemics in 1973 and 1974, influenza virus B was detected in hospitalised children who had abdominal pain, often severe enough to require differentiation from acute appendicitis, as a dominant symptom [1] . Less severe GI symptoms have been reported to occur in 20-30% of children with an influenza B infection [4, 6, 7] .",

Consequently it remains unknown whether co-infection with influenza pathogens in patients with GI symptoms represents rare events. Previous studies reported the detection of seasonal influenza in the stools of pediatric patients presenting concurrent acute diarrhea (AD) and ILI [9] , and in the stools of hospitalised and outpatients presenting both GI and respiratory symptoms [10, 11] . Influenza viral RNA was also detected in the stools of A/H1N1 2009 positive patients hospitalised due to the progression of acute gastroenteritis [12] . Previous studies showed that the avian influenza A/H5N1 virus can be detected in stools [13] , and the presence of this virus was further demonstrated in the biopsy of the small and large intestines of fatal cases [14, 15] . Other respiratory viruses have been found in stools, such as respiratory syncytial virus [16] , SARS coronavirus [17] , adenovirus [18] and bocavirus [19] . But, to our knowledge, there are no studies reporting the detection of Influenza viruses in the stools of adult patients consulting in general practice for acute diarrhea.",

Similar results have been reported among hospitalised children infected with the influenza B virus for which abdominal pain was a dominant symptom, especially in older children [1] . As highlighted by Kaji et al. [21] , GI symptoms were significantly more common in adult patients with a positive throat swab for the influenza B virus (GI = 23%), and with respect to the influenza A virus (GI = 6% for A/H3N2 and 4% for A/H1N1). Previously, the influenza B virus has been reported [9] in 81% (17/21) of influenza positive stools of pediatric patients (<6 years of age) with concurrent respiratory and GI symptoms. Interestingly, one of the influenza virus B strains detected among these pediatric patients was viable [9] .",

It is to be noted that although our sample was not large enough to make conclusions that are statistically approved, we can observe that patients who tested positive for both influenza and enteric virus were older (64 years [38-80]) than patients showing a single detection of influenza viruses (30 years ) and those ones positive for enteric viruses only (35 years ). To our knowledge, until now a co-detection of influenza viruses and enteric pathogens has rarely been reported. Co-infections between rotavirus and influenza viruses (6 influenza B and 1 influenza A) have been previously reported among 2.2% of hospitalised young children with gastroenteritis [23] . One case of co-infection with influenza A/H3N2 virus and norovirus has been reported in an elderly patient who developed diarrhea since day 3 and passed 3-4 episodes of watery/loose stool per day up to day 13 [24] . In the present study, the duration of fever seems to be shorter among patients who tested positive for at least one enteric virus with respect to patients positive for both enteric and influenza viruses. It is difficult to interpret this result given the low number of influenzaenteric co-detections and the low number of the 'pure' influenza-positive cases.",

As previously known, the avian influenza virus prefers to bind the \u03b1-2, 3-sialic acid receptor, while human Influenza viruses frequently bind the \u03b1-2, 6-sialic acid receptor. Recent evidence indicates that both types of receptors are expressed on the surfaces of in vitro differentiated intestinal epithelial cells [25] [26] [27] , suggesting that both avian and human influenza viruses have the potential to infect and replicate in human intestinal epithelial cells. Recent data confirmed that human intestinal epithelial cells can be infected by the pandemic (H1N1) viruses and H9N2 viruses isolated from both humans and birds [28] . On the other hand, a recent study on adult hospitalised patients showed that a direct intestinal infection by seasonal influenza A viruses seems an unlikely explanation for the fecal detection of viral RNA in the patients reported [11] . Alternative explanations of influenza virus detection in stools could be the swallowing of virus-containing nasopharyngeal secretion or extrapulmonary virus dissemination via hematogeneous circulation.",

However, to help us evaluate whether PCR signals were false positives, positive and negative controls were included in each PCR performed. The detection of influenza B has been performed by using two different primer pairs for the NS gene, and we detected influenza A by using two independent PCR assays for the detection of M gene and H gene.

We have also reported, for the first time in general practice, the presence of seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses in the stools of adult patients consulting for uncomplicated AD. This result could support the idea that the influenza virus could, on some occasions, be a responsible cause of gastroenteritis given the presence among some patients of diarrhea and the absence of any respiratory symptoms along with the absence of co-pathogens in 50% of them. More focused screening of fecal samples for the detection and isolation of influenza viruses in patients presenting with gastroenteritis will be required to demonstrate this additional potential disease association. The possible presence of infectious influenza viruses in fecal samples could create problems concerning infection control and highlights the importance of contact precaution when handling stools. Whereas influenza viruses are usually regarded to spread via direct contact with respiratory droplets, the possible fecal-oral transmission of influenza viruses has to be elucidated. This would have a number of implications for GP management of influenza virus infected patients, especially among patients at risk of severe influenza, in order to limit inadvertent human-to-human transmission. These cases are reported to highlight the potential clinical and infection control benefits of precisely knowing the true etiology of gastroenteritis-like symptoms. A simultaneous investigation of enteric and influenza viruses of patients complaining of GI symptoms could be useful for future studies in order to better identify the agents responsible for AD and to understand the potential mode of transmission and interaction of these viruses, especially during epidemic ILI and AD outbreaks.",

General practitioners had to enroll two patients per week, one case and one control. We excluded from the cases group: patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and patients with an obvious non-infectious etiology of diarrhea (recent use of antibiotics, colchicines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, laxatives, recent administration of chemotherapy or radiotherapy). Controls were patients consulting their GP for non-GI diseases and not reporting GI symptoms during the month preceding the consultation. Data on the time of the onset of symptoms, reported symptoms, physical findings, gender, age, previous treatment, and medical attention before enrolment were collected by completing a case report form (CRF) for all participants who met the case definition. In addition, cases and controls sent a follow-up questionnaire the week after enrolment to indicate the duration of symptoms (for cases) and to ascertain whether an AD had occurred or not (for controls). The Hospital Ethic's Committee (CHU Saint-Antoine, Paris, France) approved the study. Oral consent was obtained from the patients at the time of inclusion, for their participation in the study and for the publication of the clinical and virological data.",
