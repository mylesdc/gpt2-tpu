Mitigating such disease threats is challenging, partly because uncertainty about disease dynamics makes it difficult to identify the best management approaches.

If this is the case, disease control directed at the reservoir host might be most appropriate. However, pathogen transmission within threatened host populations may also be important, and may not be controllable by managing another host species.",

Such situations represent a form of parasite-mediated apparent competition [6] which can threaten the persistence of spill-over host species [1] . In principle, such disease threats could be mitigated by management (e.g. vaccination) directed at reservoir hosts. This approach may be attractive, especially where -as is often the case [7] -reservoir hosts are domestic animals which can be managed more readily than elusive threatened wildlife. However, reservoir hosts can be hard to recognise [5] and, in some cases, there may be no external reservoir [8] .",

Wild dogs occur at low population densities, living in highly cohesive territorial social groups (packs) [19, 20, 21, 22] . Simple epidemiological models predict that the high contact rates which occur within social groups will elevate the prevalence of directly transmitted infections [23] , a prediction which is broadly supported by empirical data [24] . Hence, exposure might be especially high in large wild dog packs once a pathogen is introduced. However, encounters between packs are rare due to low population density and territorial behaviour, so there may be few opportunities for pathogen transmission between packs [25] . These behavioural effects on contact patterns suggest that intraspecific pathogen transmission is likely to be frequency-dependent rather than density-dependent [26] .",

We describe patterns of exposure to six canine pathogens with diverse transmission mechanisms: rabies virus and canine distemper virus, which are transmitted by direct contact [27, 28] ; parvovirus and coronavirus, which are transmitted through faeces [29, 30] ; Ehrlichia canis, which is transmitted by a tick vector [31] ; and Neospora caninum, which may be transmitted by consumption of infected prey or by contact with infected faeces, as well as across the placenta from mother to foetus [32] . For each pathogen, we compare individual wild dogs' risk of exposure with behavioural measures of their opportunities for transmission from (i) within their own pack; (ii) other wild dog packs; and (iii) domestic dogs.",

First, we used pack size (measured as numbers of adults and yearlings, and numbers of pups, at the time of sampling) as an index of individual wild dogs' day-to-day probability of contact with conspecifics. Second, we used the date of sampling (measured in days since 1 Jan 2001) as a proxy to estimate contact probability, since wild dog population size, density, and home range overlap all increased over time [20, 33] . Third, we estimated wild dogs' risk of contact with other packs in the 12 months prior to sampling, using aerial telemetry data. Full details of the estimation method are given in ref [25] but, in brief, we used nine years of aerial radio-telemetry data to estimate the average frequency of contact between neighbouring wild dog packs per active period, and then multiplied this frequency by the number of packs with home ranges overlapping or adjoining that of the sampled wild dog in the 12 months before sampling. This risk of contacting other packs was only estimated for wild dogs with known movement patterns over the previous 12 months, that is, animals which throughout this period either were radio-collared themselves, or were known to have been members of a pack with at least one radio-collared member..",

These exploratory analyses gave results which were qualitatively the same as the primary analyses, and so are not presented here. Generalised linear mixed models, including pack identity as a random effect, were likewise used to explore correlations between the two measures of domestic dog contact risk, and among the three measures of wild dog contact risk. There was likewise evidence of correlation between the two measures of wild dogs' risk of contact with domestic dogs. The domestic dog density experienced in the 12 months prior to sampling was higher for 20 wild dogs living mainly on community lands, than for 37 living mainly on commercial ranches (Figure 1 ; GLMM of log-transformed domestic dog contact risk, effect of land use type, p = 0.008). Table 1 shows the proportions of wild dogs and domestic dogs with evidence of exposure to the six canine pathogens on the most recent sampling date. Populations of both host species were exposed to all of the pathogens investigated. Table 2 shows how such evidence of exposure varied among wild dogs sampled more than once. For all pathogens except rabies virus, seroconversion from negative to positive was observed, providing evidence of likely exposure to the pathogens in the course of the study. (We also recorded sporadic deaths from confirmed rabies in the course of the study [47, 48] , suggesting that this pathogen was also circulating at the time of the study). For all pathogens except Neospora, seroconversion from positive to negative was observed, providing evidence of titres fading over time (though not necessarily indicating loss of immunity). Figure 2 shows temporal variation in the proportions of wild dogs with evidence of pathogen exposure, and Figure 3 shows spatial variation in exposure among both wild dogs and domestic dogs sampled.",

Contrary to expectation, exposure to parvovirus, Ehrlichia and Neospora were associated with small pack size (rather than large pack size as would be expected if high intra-pack contact increased exposure). Although such negative associations between social group size and pathogen exposure are unusual [24] , they have been observed in other host-pathogen systems [51] . One potential explanation for these negative associations is that parvovirus, Ehrlichia and Neospora might increase wild dog (especially pup) mortality [13, 14, 15, 16] and hence themselves suppress pack size. Since pack size is unrelated to home range size in this population [20] , variation in home range size is unlikely to explain these negative associations. Rising wild dog density over time was likewise not linked to increasing pathogen exposure. Contrary to expectation, exposure to coronavirus declined significantly over time, and similar patterns (albeit non-significant) were observed for all of the viral pathogens ( Figure 2 ). We speculate that these patterns might reflect gradual fading-out of infections following recolonisation of the study area from community lands [33] where average rates of domestic dog contact, and hence pathogen exposure, may have been higher. The behavioural measure of inter-pack contact was not significantly associated with exposure to any of the pathogens.",

            "text": "Our finding that wild dogs' exposure to several pathogens was elevated by contact with domestic dogs is consistent with, though not sufficient to confirm, the hypothesis that domestic dogs function as reservoir hosts for these pathogens. Empirical data on both contact rates [25] and pathogen exposure [36] suggest that, in this study area, domestic dogs do act as a reservoir for rabies virus: infection appears to persist in the domestic dog population, but not in the wild dog population [36] , probably because domestic dogs occur at high densities with high intraspecific contact rates, whereas wild dogs live at low population densities with few opportunities for transmission between packs [25] . In contrast, the other pathogens found to be associated with domestic dog contact -parvovirus, Ehrlichia and Neospora -might in principle be maintained in low-density host populations, like those of wild dogs, without the involvement of another primary host species [52] . This is partly because their transmission does not require direct contact between hosts, being able to survive in, respectively, the environment, a tick vector, and ungulate prey [52] and, in the case of Neospora, also being vertically transmitted [32] . It is possible that domestic dog populations function as reservoirs for these pathogens but, alternatively, domestic dog contact may simply elevate the prevalence of these infections among wild dogs, without being necessary for infection to persist. The latter appears especially likely for Neospora, which occurs at higher prevalence in wild dogs than in domestic dogs (Table 1) , with high prevalence perhaps being maintained by vertical transmission. We note that exposure to all of the pathogens considered here has been recorded among wild dogs inhabiting large protected areas remote from domestic dogs [9, 14, 17, 49, 53] ; hence the absence of domestic dogs does not guarantee total protection from any of these pathogens.",

            "text": "Since the pathogens associated with domestic dog contact have all been linked to wild dog mortality, the viability of wild dog populations might be undermined by contact with domestic dogs. However, exposure to these pathogens -and by extension contact with domestic dogs -is not necessarily harmful in all cases. Indeed, the fact that we detected evidence of exposure to these pathogens in apparently healthy wild dogs, in a growing population, shows that exposure is not invariably fatal, and did not cause population decline at the level of domestic dog contact observed here. Exposure to these pathogens may maintain some level of immunity in the population, helping to prevent large outbreaks from occurring or mitigating their lethality, and may also help to maintain selection pressure for disease resistance. The balance between these positive and negative effects is likely to vary between pathogens, suggesting that a single management strategy (e.g., domestic dog removal) might not be appropriate for all pathogens. However, substantial increases in contact between wild dogs and domestic dogs -as might occur through land use change [25] would be expected to increase pathogen exposure for wild dogs and could undermine population viability. Our findings help to identify the most appropriate pathogenspecific control measures. Among the pathogens we studied, rabies virus has the clearest record of causing mortality in wild dogs [9, 10, 54, 55, 56] and is thus the most likely to require management intervention. The findings presented here, combined with those from other studies [25, 36, 57] suggest that, in principal, wild dogs might (where necessary) be protected from rabies by vaccinating either domestic dogs or wild dogs themselves. Both of these approaches have strengths and weaknesses: domestic dog vaccination can fail to protect wildlife if conducted over too small an area [2] , but has the added advantage of protecting human health [58] , whereas wild dog vaccination directly targets the host of conservation concern but has proven controversial in the past [59] . Deciding which form of management is most appropriate therefore requires a careful analysis of costs and benefits. Canine distemper virus is less likely than rabies virus to require management, since it has less of a history of causing wild dog mortality (but see [11, 12] ). However, should this virus seriously threaten a wild dog population, vaccination of domestic dogs might have no conservation benefit since there is growing evidence to suggest that this pathogen is not always maintained in domestic dog populations [36, 49, 50] . Protecting wild dogs from canine distemper would therefore need to target wild dogs themselves. For the other pathogens studied here, both disease dynamics and impacts on wild dog populations and are less certain; hence, deciding on the most appropriate form of management (if any) remains problematic. This study is one of a very small number of empirical attempts to quantify rates of contact between wild and domestic mammals [60, 61, 62] . To our knowledge, this is the first such study to successfully link individual variation in hosts' opportunities for interspecific contact to variation in pathogen exposure. Identifying such links required detailed data on the behaviour of both host species, highlighting one practical challenge of recognising reservoirs of pathogens affecting wildlife [5] , even when one of the hosts is a domestic species. Still greater challenges would be involved when both hosts are wildlife (but see [63] ). Nevertheless, further studies of this kind are needed to address the growing number of wild species threatened by infectious disease [64] .",
