To determine the prevalence of human coronavirus (HCoV) infection among patients with influenza-like illness, 5833 clinical samples from nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates collected between January 2012 and December 2013 were examined. Results: HCoV was found in 46 (0.79 %) samples. There were 19 (0.32 %) HCoV-HKU1, 19 (0.32 %) HCoV-NL63, 5 (0.09 %) HCoV-229E, and 3 (0.05 %) HCoV-OC43. None of the sample tested positive for MERS-CoV. The majority (54 %) of the HCoV-positive patients were between the ages of 0 and 5 years. HCoV was detected throughout the 2-year period and generally peaked from May to October, which coincided with the rainy season. Phylogenetic trees based on the alignment of the spike (S) gene sequences suggest an emergence of a new clade for HCoV-229E.",

            "text": "Human coronavirus (HCoV) is an enveloped positivestrand RNA virus with ~27-32 kb genome. Its genome contains five major open reading frames (Orfs) encoding the replicase polyproteins (Orf 1a and Orf 1b), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Hilgenfeld and Peiris 2013) . HCoV belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae and the genus Coronavirus (Lai and Cavanagh 1997) . Virions are pleomorphic with diameters between 60 and 220 nm. There are four genera of coronaviruses (Alpha-, Beta-, Gammaand Deltacoronavirus) based on serologic and phylogenetic characterization. Among the five recognized human coronaviruses, HCoV strains 229E and NL63 are alphacoronaviruses, while HCoV strains OC43, HKU1, and SARS (responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome) are betacoronaviruses (Gaunt et al. 2010; Gonzalez et al. 2003; Drosten et al. 2003) . In addition, a novel genotype of coronavirus was identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, later referred to as MERS-CoV (for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), which was isolated from the sputum of a 60-year-old man in Saudi Arabia who presented acute pneumonia and renal failure with a fatal outcome (Hilgenfeld and Peiris 2013; Zaki et al. 2012) . It was subsequently found to be most closely related to the bat betacoronavirus HKU4 and HKU5 (Gonzalez et al. 2003) . Fortunately, the conserved structure and function of the polymerase made it possible to develop a PCR assay based on the polymerase gene region to accurately differentiate new coronaviruses as was done with MERS-CoV and other novel coronaviruses (Rota et al. 2003; Mo\u00ebs et al. 2005) .",

Positive samples tested from nasopharyngeal swab and aspirate from each age group are indicated by gray and hatched bars, respectivelyFig. 3 HCoV-positive samples identified by species. The total number of specimens examined is shown in gray (right scale), while the strains of HCoVs (HKU1, NL63, OC43, and 229E) identified each month are indicated as bars (left scale) et al. 2009; Pierangeli et al. 2007). However, the rate of HCoV-positive samples found in this study was similar to the level of infection reported in countries such as mainland China (1 %) (Ren et al. 2011) and United Kingdom (0.85 %) (Gaunt et al. 2010). Several factors may account for this disparity:",

Although the numbers of HCoV-positive samples were low, we detected four species of HCoV and phylogenetically characterized their diversity. These viruses appeared to continue to cause infections globally, thus accurate and timely diagnosis will be essential. The assay described in this study can be used to assist in the rapid and accurate detection of emerging HCoV infection.",
