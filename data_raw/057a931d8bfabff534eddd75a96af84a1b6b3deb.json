Here, by using sequential antigen panning of a yeast antibody library derived from healthy donors against the DENV envelop protein domain III (DIII) combined with depletion by an entry defective DIII mutant, we identified a cross-reactive human monoclonal antibody (mAb), m366.6, which bound with high affinity to DENV DIII from all four DENV serotypes. Immunogenetic analysis indicated that m366.6 is a germline-like mAb with very few somatic mutations from the closest VH and V\u03bb germline genes. Importantly, we demonstrated that it potently neutralized DENV both in vitro and in the mouse models of DENV infection without detectable antibodydependent enhancement (ADE) effect. The epitope of m366.6 was mapped to the highly conserved regions on DIII, which may guide the design of effective dengue vaccine immunogens. Furthermore, as the first germline-like mAb derived from a na\u00efve antibody library that could neutralize all four DENV serotypes, the m366.6 can be a tool for exploring mechanisms of DENV infection, and is a promising therapeutic candidate.",

There are four closely related PLOS Pathogens | https://doi.DENV serotypes, but they all are antigenically distinct, with each comprising several genotypes that exhibit differences in their infection characteristics in both the mosquito vector and in the human host. One of the confounding problems that has faced vaccine and biological drugs development for decades is the inability of antibodies to one serotype to protect against infection by another one. Instead, the induced humoral immune response to one dengue virus infection can enhance the infection and disease processes brought by a subsequent infection with another dengue serotype. In this study, by using a competitive sorting strategy to interrogate a human na\u00efve antibody library, we identified a cross-reactive mAb, designated as m366.6, against the four DENV serotypes. The mAb m366.6 possesses only few somatic mutations from the closest VH and V\u03bb germline genes and high affinity to DIII. Most importantly, the germline-like m366.6 demonstrated a broad spectrum of neutralization against the four DENV serotypes. Thus, m366.6 is a promising candidate therapeutics and its epitope may imply on the design of effective vaccine immunogens to elicit m366.6-like antibodies in vivo.",

Over 2.5 billion people are at risk for infection in over 100 countries, 50-100 million are infected with symptoms, and up to 50,000 die from dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) each year [1, 2] . No specific antiviral drug has been available against DENV infection; the only approved vaccine, Dengvaxia, has caused considerable controversy regarding its safety and potential benefits [3] [4] [5] [6] . For decades, anti-DENV vaccine and biological drugs development has been hampered by the high sequence divergence (25-40%) among the four DENV serotypes [7, 8] . Such divergence leads to the fact that one antibody may not be sufficient to neutralize all DENV infection. Instead, the induced humoral immune response to one DENV infection can enhance the infection and disease processes brought by a subsequent infection with another DENV serotype [2] [3] [4] . These findings suggest that the development of new and broadly neutralization antibodies against all the serotypes of DENV could be promising candidate anti-DENV agents, and may also guide the design of effective and safe vaccine immunogens.",

            "text": "The DENV envelope glycoprotein (E protein), which mediates virus entry into cells, is the major neutralizing target of antibodies [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . E protein is a type II fusion protein and consists of three domains: DI, DII, and DIII of which DIII has been proposed to contain a receptor binding domain [14] [15] [16] [17] . Recent studies revealed that cross-reactive conserved epitopes exist on DII as well as DIII of the DENV E protein [14, [16] [17] [18] . During the naturally-occurring primary DENV infection, a large fraction of the antibody repertoire consists of DII-specific antibodies which are, unfortunately, typically poor in neutralization and may increase the likelihood of severe disease upon subsequent infection through a mechanism known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [18] [19] [20] . In contrast, antibodies targeting DIII have proven to be the most potent neutralizing antibodies, but very few could be elicited in naturally infected individuals [18, 19, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Despite this, previous studies indicated that anti-DENV DIII serotype-specific and cross-reactive antibodies could be elicited using DENV DIII as vaccine immunogen [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] and in infected humans [44] [45] [46] [47] . It has also been demonstrated that the lysine at position 310 on DIII is the critical residue in the cross-reactive epitope [24] . Therefore, the conserved epitope on DIII represents an attractive target for the development of broadly neutralizing DENV antibodies.",

A competitive sorting strategy using a DIII mutant as competitor was applied to identify antibodies precisely targeting the conserved neutralizing epitope. To our knowledge, m366.6 is the first human mAb isolated from a na\u00efve antibody library which could neutralize all the four serotypes DENV viruses. Importantly, both heavy and light chain genes of m366.6 are very close to their putative germline predecessors. Its fully human origin, the germline-like nature, combined with high-affinity and broad neutralizing activity toward all DENV serotypes, suggest that m366.6 is a promising candidate antiviral agent and may also provide a unique template for designing effective dengue vaccine immunogens.",

In this study, we used a competitive library sorting strategy to isolate broadly neutralizing antibodies against DENV1-4 ( Fig 1A and 1B) . The yeast-displayed na\u00efve single chain antibody fragment (scFv) library was used to screen against the biotinylated DENV DIII, and, importantly, ten times concentration unbiotinylated DIII K310E mutant was used as the competitor. The yeast cells were selected to present the antibody-expressing cells that could bind well to the wild-type DIII instead of the DIII mutant, resulting in the isolation of antibodies that can target the cross-reactive neutralizing epitopes covering the residue Lysine310 [55] . Potent enrichment was achieved after four rounds of sorting, and a panel of antibodies were identified ( Fig 1B) . Two antibodies, designated as m360 and m366, bound potently to DENV DIIIs. Their scFv gene were fused with human IgG1 Fc for protein expression, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were used to evaluate the antigens binding. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) of m360 for the DENV1-4 DIIIs were 5.8 nM, 5.1 nM, 0.1 nM and 8.3 nM, respectively. The mAb m366 displayed a broader binding profile compared with that of m360, with the K D of 3.3 nM, 1.2 nM, 1.1 nM and 12 nM to DENV1-4, respectively (Table 1 , S1 and S2 Figs).",

Biacore analysis showed that the cross-reactive binding activities of m360.6 and m366.6 to all 4 DIIIs were preserved after the affinity maturation process. The K D of m360.6 for the DENV1-4 DIIIs were 0.3 nM, 42 pM, 2.3 pM and 33 nM, respectively (S3 Fig). Although the binding to DENV1-3 DIIIs was improved, the m360.6 had only slightly increased binding affinity to DENV4 DIII compared to its parental mAb m360. Notably, the m366.6 exhibited high affinity to all the DENV DIIIs. The K D of m366.6 for the DENV1-4 were 0.8 nM, 0.3 nM, 0.3 nM, and 1.9 nM respectively, which demonstrated that m366.6 could bind to all the four serotype DENV viruses with high avidity (Table 1, Fig 2) . We also assessed the binding specificity of m366.6 by ELISA, and the results showed that m366.6 had weak cross-reactivity with Zika virus (ZIKV) DIII and no binding with other irrelevant antigens (S4 Fig).",

The luminescent reporter expression was proportional to the number of RVPs added to BHK DC-SIGN cells, confirming the linear correlation between the extent of RVP infection and reporter gene expression.

In contrast, the m366.6 VH gene was derived from the IGHV3-21 and the V\u03bb gene was from IGLV3-21. Interestingly, we found that the encoding genes of both m360.6 and m366.6 closely resembled their corresponding germline gene segments. Notably, m366.6 VH and V\u03bb gene shared 95.8% and 95.2% sequence identities with the IGHV3-21 \ufffd 01 and IGLV3-21 \ufffd 01 germlines respectively (Fig 4A and 4B ). These results indicated that the mAb m366.6 is a germline-like antibody, which, in general, could show better drug properties and lower immunogenicity compared to somatically hypermutated antibodies [59] . To further investigate the immunogenetic characteristics of m366.6-like antibodies, we analyzed in detail the IGHV3-21 recombination frequencies with specific IGHD and IGHJ genes families from na\u00efve immunoglobulin M (IgM) repertoires of 33 health adult donors and neonatal IgM repertoires of 10 newborn babies, using next-generation sequencing data previously generated from our antibodyome studies [48] . By querying the m366.6 sequence from the IgM repertoires, 39 sequences were found to display m366.6-like V(D)J recombination from the genes IGHV-3-21, IGHD1, and IGHJ3 out of a total of 10,498,301 sequences from healthy adult IgM repertoires. In IgM repertoires of newborn babies, a similar recombination frequency was also observed, in which 111 sequences with m366.6-like V(D)J recombination were found from 5,617,227 sequences. Our analysis showed that IGHV3-21 is one of the most frequently used IGHV genes, and identified that many of those sequences sharing a significant degree of resemblance to m366.6 ( Fig 4C) . In brief, analysis of these data showed the potential of eliciting robust immune responses with the m366.6-like germline antibodies by vaccination.",

Two rounds of sorting of those yeast cells showing expression on surface but lacking the binding to m366.6 was performed. A total of 35 binding escape mutants were aligned with the serotype 2 consensus protein sequence. Mutation frequency at each position was plotted against the residue position number.

The superimposed profiles of the two set of sequences showed that many of the escaped mutations located in the well-conserved area, indicating the broad crossreactivity of m366.6 to naturally isolated dengue viruses.

We selected the three top scored docked complexes that contained the key residues identified from an experimental epitope mapping approach. One of the top scored docked models exhibited minimum clashes with appropriate protein interface parameters and was used to demonstrate the lactation the potential epitopes and their interactions with m366.6 antibody, which might shed light on the molecular mechanisms of broadly cross-reactive neutralization. Fig 6D showed the docking model of the DIII-m366.6 antibody complex in which these epitopes are highlighted in green surfaces. The docking model revealed a different orientation of antibody binding as compared to the DIII complex structure with Fab 1A1D-2 that was previously determined [35] . The epitope comprised of three structurally proximal regions, residues 305-311 in green, 325, 327 and 361 in dark green, and 383-385 at the C-terminal in lime. One of the key residues, K310, contacts the CDR-L1 of m366.6 which has a germline mutation. In Env-DIII-Fab-1A1D-2 complex structure, the residue K310 contacts the CDR-H1. The hydrophobic residues, Ile and Trp, of CDR-H3 contact the center part of the epitope, and other loops H1, H2, L2 and L3 also involve in the binding. The surface area of the interface between DIII and m366.6 antibody in the model complex is 716 \u00c5 2 , a typical of antibody-antigen interactions. There are six hydrogen bonds likely to form and no salt bridges at the interface. In brief, the binding regions of the m366.6 may be close to or partially overlaps the dimerization interface between domains II and III, which might indicate the broad crossreactivity of m366.6 to the four serotypes of DENV.",

Fortunately, screening antibodies from the large na\u00efve libraries has enabled the rapid development of high-affinity human mAbs, especially for the rapid response to the outbreak of emerging viruses and diseases. We recently successfully identified two human germline-like mAbs against MERS-CoV and H7N9 influenza virus from the na\u00efve library, named m336 and m826, respectively [48, 50] . They both can naturally exist with very low level of somatic hypermutation in the na\u00efve library with which they have potent binding activity against the envelop proteins of MERS-CoV and H7N9 influenza virus. Most importantly, m336 and m826 all showed highly therapeutic effective in the animal models. Therefore, the na\u00efve library screening can be quickly used to isolate germline-like antibodies that effectively bind to complex protein targets like those in DENV viruses.",

            "text": "How to increase the neutralization breadth is a key issue in developing anti-DENV antibodies. Previous studies revealed two classes of broadly neutralizing antibodies to flaviviruses, including antibodies targeting the conserved epitopes in DII or DIII [16] [17] [18] 20 ]. While the conserved fusion loop epitope (FLE) in DII is the immunodominant epitope in E protein, unfortunately, this epitope frequently induced poorly neutralizing and strongly infectionenhancing antibodies via ADE [18] [19] [20] . Therefore, DIII represents the ideal target for neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we applied a highly efficient yeast-display-based sorting strategy by using the highly diverse DENV DIIIs as antigen and the competitive sorting technique. By applying this method, we quickly and efficiently identified two human germline-like broadspectrum anti-DENV mAbs (m360 and m366) from the na\u00efve scFv yeast library using the DIII antigen that make them as promising candidate therapeutics as well as the template for vaccine development. Another class of highly efficient broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the envelope dimer epitopes (EDE) from the secondary acute DENV infection plasmablasts has been identified by Dejnirattisai et al. [67] . These antibodies may especially get through with high somatic mutations from the secondary virus infection. Compared with the highly somatically mutated antibodies, germline-like antibodies typically have better safety and drug-related property [59] . Importantly, the Hendra and Nipah antibody m102.4 is a near germline antibody and exhibited a very good drugability, which was from a similar library that was also used to isolate our m366 and m366-like antibodies. m102.4 was successful as a candidate therapeutic mAb in animal models and was also completed the phase I clinical trial (ACTRN12615000395538) without side effects [64] . To further improve the affinity of m366 with the four serotypes DENV DIIIs, we subjected m366 to affinity maturation process, and named it as m366.6. Subsequently, we analyzed m366.6 sequence using the IMGT tool to identify its closest VH and V\u03bb germline genes. Interestingly, we found that m366.6 is still a germline-like antibody although it went through the mutation process in vitro, with over 95% identities of its VH and V\u03bb genes to the IGHV3-21 \ufffd 01 and IGLV3-21 \ufffd 01 germline respectively.",

More importantly, m366.6 did not present any ADE effects in different serotypes of DENV. The in vivo study results demonstrated the therapeutic potential of m366.6 against severe DENV1-4 infections. In brief, the m366.6 could neutralize the four serotypes DENV in vitro and protect the DENV infection mouse model in vivo without detectable ADE effects.
