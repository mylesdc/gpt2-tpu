Therefore, N gene has long been thought an ideal target for the design of small interference RNA (siRNA). siRNA is a class of small non-coding RNAs with a size of 21-25nt that functions post-transcriptionally to block targeted gene expression. In this study, we analyzed the N gene coding sequences derived from 16 different isolates, and found that nucleotide deletions and substitutions are mainly located at the first 440nt sequence. Combining previous reports and the above sequence information, we create three novel siRNAs that specifically target the conserved and unexploited regions in the N gene. We show that these siRNAs could effectively and specifically block the isolated N gene expression in mammal cells. Furthermore, we provide evidence to show that N gene can effectively up-regulate M gene mediated interferon \uf062 (IFN\uf062) production, while blocking N gene expression by specific siRNA significantly reduces IFN\uf062 gene expression. Our data indicate that the inhibitory effect of siRNA on the isolated N gene expression might be influenced by the sequence context around the targeted sites.",

The viral envelope is a lipid bilayer enbedded with three viral transmembrane proteins: the matrix (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) proteins. The genomic RNA of SARS-CoV is protected and packaged by the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein by forming a helical structure of ribonucleoprotein complex within the viral envelope.

            "text": "The N gene of SARS-CoV is located at a region proximal to the 3' end of the viral genome with a size of 1269nt long that encodes for a 422aa basic protein. The main functions of N protein are two folds: 1) it binds to viral genomic RNA for the formation of viral nucleocapsid; 2) it also selfassociates into polymer that might be critical for the helical structure formation [7] . Protein structural study reveals that the SARS-CoV N protein contains two structural domains flanked by intrinsically disordered (ID) regions [8] . The N terminal domain (NTD, amino acid residues 45-181) can bind nonspecifically to a variety of nucleotide substrates [9] and functions as a putative RNA binding domain associated with the viral RNA genome [10] , whereas the C terminal domain (CTD, amino acid residues 248-365) is thought to be responsible for the dimerized self-association [8, 11] . However, recent studies show that the C terminal sequence of N protein also promotes higher ordered oligomerization and is able to interact with nucleic acids as well [7, 12] . Moreover, Chang demonstrated that all ID sequences are able to bind RNA [13] , indicating that the multisite nucleic acid binding property of SARS-CoV N protein may have an inherent advantage to promote the formation of viral helical nucleocapsid core.",

Therefore, down-regulating N protein expression by the small interference RNA (siRNA) approach might be good strategy to reverse the virus-induced damage to the host and may help development of a more effective therapeutic means to control viral transmission. siRNA is a type of RNA molecule with 21-25nt in length that functions post-transcriptionally to down-regulate the targeted gene expression. SARS-CoV N gene specific siRNAs have been designed and investigated by a number of groups, and at least 23 targeted sites of N gene specific siRNAs have been selected and tested [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Sequence analysis indicates that all these known siRNAs are located at 2/3 of the 5' N gene sequence (within first 860nt out of the total 1269nt). Nucleotide substitution and deletion mutations can be frequently recovered from the first 440nt sequence of N gene. Therefore, these sequence alterations may have a potential to weaken the effect of siRNA mediated gene silencing. In the current study, we compared the N gene sequences derived from 16 different isolates of SARS-CoV and selected three novel siRNA targeting sites in the N gene, including one targeting the 3' terminus of the gene. Functional analysis indicates that all three novel siRNAs are effective in downregulating N gene expression. Moreover, our study demonstrates that SARS-CoV N gene is able to up-regulate the M gene mediated interferon \uf062 production, while the N gene specific siRNA can effectively reduce this up-regulation.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV N protein is a multi-functional protein that contributes greatly to viral induced pathogenesis and often serves as the therapeutic targeting site for the development of anti-viral drugs against SARS-CoV infection, including siRNA. SARS-CoV is a positive single-stranded RNA virus frequently associated with sequence alterations during viral transmission. A better siRNA should be designed to target the conserved region in the targeted sequence. To this end, we randomly selected the N genes derived from 16 different isolates of SARS-CoV: HKU-39849 (AY278491), Tor2 (AY274119), BJ02 (AY278487), HZS2-FB (AY394987), ZJ01 (AY297028), Sin2748 (AY283797), ShanghaiQXC1 (AY463059), ShanghaiQXC2(AY463060), CUHK-AG01 (AY345986), PUMC01 (AY350750), GZ-B (AY394978), TC1 (AY338174), GZ-C (AY394979), ZS-C (AY95003), LC1 (AY394998.1) and LC5(AY395002.1). ClustalW analysis revealed that a total of five sequence alterations (two sequence deletions and three nucleotide substitutions) occurred in the N gene in these isolates ( Figure 1 ). Interestingly, sequence alterations in the N gene are frequently uncovered in the 5' portion of the gene (within the first 440nt), which is similar to our previous observation on SARS-CoV M gene [25] . However, different from the M gene mutation, which is associated with single nucleotide substitution, the N gene mutation tends to be larger in size, such as twelve nucleotide deletions (nt14-25) and di-nucleotide substitutions (nt419-420, Figure 1 ). The N gene also possesses two additional single nucleotide substitutions (nt74 and nt1128) and one single nucleotide deletion (nt384).",

Sequence analysis revealed that all these siRNAs are located within the first 859nt sequence of the N gene, and no targeted site has been selected for the last 410nt sequence. Considering the nucleotide substitutions in N gene as well as the previous reports, we chose three unexploited regions that were well conserved in the N genes among the 16 isolates of SARS-CoV. The selected targeted sites were at +213\uf07e+233nt, +863\uf07e+883nt and +1240\uf07e+1260nt relative to the 5' ATG initiation codon, and their respective siRNAs were named as si-N213, si-N863 and si-N1240 ( Figure 1 ). A known siRNA (named si-N#16, previous name No. 16 in reference [21] ) that targeted the 5' terminus (+7\uf07e+27nt) of N gene was also constructed for control purposes. Three novel siRNAs (si-N213, si-N863 and si-N1240) targeting at 213\uf07e233nt, 863\uf07e883nt and 1240\uf07e1260nt, respectively, are underlined.

The expression of N gene was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Figure 2a and 2b) . To visualize the subcellular localization of N protein, N gene was also fused with EGFP to make a pEGFP-Np fusion gene construct. After transfection into HEK293 cells, EGFP-Np fusion protein was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm (Figure 2c ). Alternatively, HEK293 cells transfected with pCMV-Myc-Np were subjected to immunostaining analysis.

The specificity of si-N863 mediated N gene repression was demonstrated by the fact that higher doses of si-N863, but not si-M3, dramatically inhibited EGFP-Np gene expression (Figure 5c ). The results were further confirmed by measuring the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the transfected cells cotransfected with EGFP-Np and the indicated siRNAs (Figure 5d ). Sequence analysis reveals that all the N gene siRNAs reported by other groups have their own recognition sites, mainly located within the first 859nt sequence of the N gene [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Therefore, to our knowledge, the last 410nt sequence of N gene has not been designed for siRNA targeting. To this end, we created the third siRNA that targets to the 3' terminus (+1240\uf07e+1260nt) of N gene, and named it si-N1240. Western blot analysis demonstrated that si-N1240 markedly inhibited Myc-tagged N protein expression in a dose dependent manner (Figure 6a and 6b ). In addition, pEGFP-Np was also co-transfected with increased doses of either si-M3 or si-N1240 into targeted cells. The result shown in Figure 6c clearly demonstrated that higher doses of si-N1240, but not si-M3, dramatically inhibited EGFP-Np gene expression. The result was further confirmed by flow cytometric analysis by measuring the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the transfected cells co-transfected with EGFP-Np and the indicated siRNAs (Figure 6d ). Overall, the above results provide strong evidence to show that all three novel siRNAs (si-N213, si-N863 and si-N1240) are specific and effective inhibitors to block the isolated SARS-CoV N gene expression.",

To detect the influence of N gene on M mediated INF\uf062 production, N and M were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. Interestingly, we found that the N gene was not able to inhibit, but rather enhanced M gene mediated INF\uf062 mRNA production (Figure 8a ).

            "text": "SARS-CoV N gene has long been selected as one of the major targets for siRNA design. However, genomic alterations such as nucleotide deletion and substitution frequently occur in SARS-CoV. This type of change has the potential to weaken the inhibitory effect induced by siRNA. In the current study we analyzed the N gene sequences derived from 16 different isolates and found that in addition to single nucleotide substitutions, the N gene also possesses a longer nucleotide deletion and dinucleotide substitution. Previous studies on M gene specific siRNAs indicate that the siRNA targeting site and its surrounding sequences may influence the inhibitory effect [25] . The current study further support this observation by showing that si-N#16, which targets a twelve nucleotide deletion region in the N gene of one viral strain generates a less inhibitory effect than that of either si-N213 or si-N863 (Figure 7b ). Although N gene specific siRNA has been intensively studied, no siRNA was reported for the last 410nt sequence. In this study, we created and tested a third siRNA (si-N1240) which was effective to target the 3' terminal sequence of N gene and subsequently in downregulating N gene expression. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect induced by si-N1240 was similar to that of si-N#16, implying that siRNAs targeting at both the 5\uf0a2 and 3\uf0a2 terminal sequences of the isolated N gene might induce less inhibition. We also notice that there might be a discrepancy between our study and a previous report by Shi et al. in which they demonstrated that si-N#16 (No.16) was the strongest inhibitor among the eleven N gene siRNAs tested [21] . This discrepancy might be due to: 1) the potential structural difference between vector expressed N mRNA and virus derived subgenomic N mRNAs and/or 2) the differences in the expression system used by us (pBS/U6) versus Shi's (chemical synthesized siRNAs). Finally, we provide evidence to show that SARS-CoV N gene products were able to up-regulate M gene mediated INF\uf062 production, while N gene specific siRNA could functionally reduce this enhancement. However, the mechanism underlining N gene mediated INF\uf062 production remains an interesting point to be further addressed.",
