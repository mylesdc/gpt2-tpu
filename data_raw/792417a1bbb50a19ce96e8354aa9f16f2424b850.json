            "text": "Introduction Autophagy is well known as one of the biogenic responses against various stresses, which possesses the benefi cial roles for survival, but little is known about the dynamics and its signifi cance during the septic condition. We hypothesized that autophagy is induced during the septic condition, and contributes to protect from tissue damage which subsequently leads to organ dysfunction. We confi rm whether the autophagic process is accelerated or sustained in an acute phase of sepsis and we also determine its physiological role. Methods Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice. We examined the kinetics of autophagosome and auto lysosome formation which may explain the status of autophagy by western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. To investigate a precise role of autophagy in CLP-induced sepsis, chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor, was administered to the CLP-operated mice, and blood chemistry, pathology of the liver and survival were evaluated. Results Autophagy demonstrated by the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I was induced over the time course up to 24 hours after CLP. The ratio was particularly increased in the liver, heart and spleen. Autophagosome formation became maximal at 6 hours and declined by 24 hours after CLP. Autolysosome formation as evaluated by both fusion of GFP-LC3 dots with LAMP1 immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy was also increased after the procedure. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine during the CLP procedure resulted in elevation of serum AST levels, and signifi cantly increased mortality in mice. Conclusion Autophagy was induced in several organs over the time course of the CLP sepsis model and then the process was gradually completed to degradation of the components. Our data suggest autophagy plays a protective role in organ dysfunction in sepsis.",

However, it remains unclear which pathway is associated with the upregulation of NGAL. We therefore designed the present study to reveal whether the patternrecognition receptor of bacteria, the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, plays a pivotal role for NGAL secretion from gut crypt cells. Methods With our institutional approval, the ileum and colon of male C57BL/6J mice (6 to 7 weeks) were everted and washed by Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ free PBS buff er fi ve times. Tissues were incubated with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ free PBS containing 30 mM EDTA for 1 hour to isolate crypt cells of gut. The cell suspension was fi ltered through a cell strainer (40 \u03bcm) twice, and deposited the crypt cells by centrifugation at 700\u00d7g. The isolated crypt cells were resuspended in PBS and stained with 0.25% amido black for labeling paneth cells. The 5\u00d710 5 crypt cells were resuspended in 50 ml HBSS containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The crypt cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with or without TLR ligands: lipopolysaccharide (TLR4 ligand, 10 \u03bcg/ml) and CpG-DNA (TLR9 ligand, 8 \u03bcg/ml). After a 2-hour incubation period, the crypt cells were deposited and eluted mRNA to measure the expression of both NGAL and TLR mRNA using real-time PCR. Results More than 70 to 80% of collected cells were stained by amido black. LPS signifi cantly upregulated the expression of NGAL and TLR4 mRNA in ileum and colon crypt cells (P <0.05). Although the CpG-DNA did not upregulate NGAL and TLR9 mRNA in ileum crypt cells, the apparent expression of NGAL and TLR9 mRNA was found in colon crypt cells (P <0.05). Conclusion Bacterial stimulation of TLR4 and TLR9 pathways plays a pivotal role in the expression of NGAL mRNA in gut, suggesting that NGAL, derived from gut crypt cells, could contribute to the regulation of the intraluminal microfl ora in the critically ill.

However, in a small subset of patients the infection rapidly progressed to primary viral pneumonia (PVP) and a minority of them developed ARDS. Inherited and acquired variability in host immune responses may infl uence susceptibility and outcome of IAV infection. However, the molecular nature of such human factors remains largely elusive. Methods We report three adult relatives with the autosomal dominant GATA-2 defi ciency. P1 and his son P2 had a history of myelodysplastic syndrome and a few episodes of mild respiratory infections. They developed PVP by H1N1pdm which rapidly evolved to ARDS. They died at the age of 54 and 31, respectively. Results Patients were heterozygous for a novel R396L mutation in GATA2. Like other patients with GATA-2 defi ciency, the three relatives had absence of peripheral NK and B cells and monocytopenia. However a high number of plasma cells, which were found to be pauciclonal, were observed in peripheral blood from P1 during H1N1pdm infection. P1 and P2 had normal levels of immunoglobulins and IgG antibodies against common viruses. Microneutralization test showed that P1 produced normal titers of neutralizing antibodies against H1N1pdm and against the previous annual H1N1 strain. Our results suggest that a few clones of long-living memory B cells against IAV expanded in P1; and that these cells produced cross-reactive antibodies against H1N1pdm, similar to those recently described. During the fl u episode P1 had a strong increase of IFN\u03b3-producing T cells and of IFN\u03b3 production. The Th1-related chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL9, as well as IFN\u03b3, MCP-1 and IL-8, were strongly elevated in serum from P1 and P2 in the course of H1N1pdm infection. Conclusion GATA-2 defi ciency is the fi rst described Mendelian inborn error of immunity underlying severe IAV infection. Primary immunodefi ciencies predisposing to severe IAV infections may debut, even in adults without a history of previous severe infections. The massive IFN\u03b3-mediated cytokine storm may explain the fatal course of H1N1pdm infection in our patients.",

While the anti-infl ammatory properties may induce immunoparalysis and impede bacterial clearance, the tissue protective eff ects might limit organ damage. The eff ects of a common loss-of-function variant of the adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1 gene (AMPD1), which is associated with increased adenosine formation, in patients with sepsis are unknown. Methods In a prospective cohort, genetic-association study, the eff ects of the presence of the AMPD1 gene on immune function, multiorgan dysfunction and mortality in septic patients was studied. Pneumosepsis patients (n = 402) and controls without infection (n = 101) were enrolled. Results In pneumosepsis patients and controls, a similar prevalence of the 34C>T (rs17602729) mutation in the AMPD1 gene was found. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed a tendency of increased mortality in patients with the CT genotype, compared with patients with the CC genotype (OR 1.53; 95% CI 0.95 to 2.5). Moreover, carriers of the CT genotype tended to suff er more from multiorgan dysfunction, OR 1.4 (0.84 to 2.3) and 3.0 (0.66 to 13.8), for CT and TT, respectively (P = 0.07). In septic carriers of the CT genotype, the ex vivo production of TNF\u03b1 by LPS-stimulated monocytes was attenuated (P = 0.005), Introduction Hypogammaglobulinemia has been frequently found in adult patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Furthermore, it seems that at least a low serum level of IgM is correlated with higher mortality in sepsis. The mechanisms of hypogammaglobulinemia in septic shock have not yet been explained. It has been hypothesized that outfl ow of immunoglobulins into the extravascular space due to increased capillary permeability could reduce immunoglobulin serum concentrations. Angiopoietin-2, which directly disrupts the endothelial barrier, is markedly elevated in sepsis and other infl ammatory states and its serum level has been correlated with microvascular leakage, end-organ dysfunction and death in sepsis. Methods In the prospective, noninterventional study, we assessed the correlation between the capillary leakage marker angiopoetin-2 and serum levels of IgG and IgM in 41 patients with community-acquired severe sepsis or septic shock on admission. Blood samples were obtained during the fi rst 12 hours after admission to hospital. Results Mean age of patients (17 females) was 70 years. Median APACHE II and SOFA scores at admission were 24 and 11, respectively. The mortality rate was 45%. Thirty-four percent of all patients had level of IgG <650 mg/dl. The median concentration of angiopoietin-2 in the hypo-IgG group was 11,958 pg/ml, which was not statistically diff erent (Mann-Whitney; P >0.05) than in the rest of patients with normal levels of IgG (15,688 pg/ml). The concentration of IgM <40 mg/dl was found in only four patients (10%) and all died. Pearson's correlation test showed that the correlation between the concentrations of angiopoietin-2 and IgG (correlation coeffi cient 0.191) or IgM (correlation coeffi cient 0.0408), respectively, were not statistically signifi cant (P <0.05). Conclusion At present the hypothesis that increased microvascular leakage is responsible for hypogammaglobulinemia in septic patients could not be accepted. Studies on larger number of patients are needed. In addition, it is necessary to further explore other possible mechanisms, such as increased catabolism and consumption of antibodies or inadequate synthesis of immunoglobulins, which could also be responsible for hypogammaglobulinemia in sepsis.",

The objective of this study is to determine the epidemiological and microbiological characteristics of this disease in our centre. Methods A descriptive retrospective study of all medical records of HT performed in a single institution from 1991 to 2009 followed until June 2010. Clinical and microbiological variables were considered. Centre for Diseases Control (CDC) criteria were used to defi ne nosocomial infections. Invasive aspergillosis was considered if there were criteria for probable aspergillosis according to IDSA criteria. Results In 594 HTs there were 97 infectious episodes in 75 patients (12.6%). Eighty-fi ve patients (14.3%) died during hospitalization. Infection is the second cause of mortality during the postoperative period (17.9% of dead patients). The most common locations of infections were pneumonia (n = 31, 31.9% of infection episodes), bloodstream (n = 24, 24.7%), urinary tract (n = 14, 14.4%), surgical site (n = 13, 13.4%) and intraabdominal infections (n = 13, 13.4%). Patients with pneumonia were treated according to knowledge in a specifi c moment, thus diff erent antibiotics were used. The duration of antibiotic therapy was 20 \u00b1 15.5 days. In nine episodes of pneumonia according to the CDC no germ was isolated in the cultures. Six of the episodes were polymicrobial infections. The most frequent microbes isolated were E. coli (n = 7, 22.5% of pneumonia cases), A. fumigatus (n = 7, 22.5%), S. aureus (n = 3, 9.68%), P. aeruginosa (n = 3, 9.68%), P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. faecalis, C. glabrata, and S. marcescens (one case each, 3.22%).

TNF\u03b1, soluble TNF\u03b1 receptor I and IL-6 levels in sera were determined by HS ELISA and/or ELISA. Plasma ACTH and cortisol values were measured by RIA kits. Results From 22 patients, eight deep wound and urine infections were found in 14 days and six urine and wound infections in 30 days after surgery, all survived. All patients were bacterially contaminated, as wound samples taken at the end of operation demonstrated. On day 0 the circulating TNF\u03b1 values were lower in infected patients. TNF started to increase from day 3 to day 9, never reaching values of the uneventful healing group. Soluble TNF receptor I, IL-6, ACTH, and cortisol concentrations did not demonstrate any diff erence on day 0 but from day 1 started to increase transiently, reaching higher levels in septic patients. Conclusion A low proinfl ammatory response is a key facilitating factor for the development of infection.

Promotion of the hand hygiene program consisted of lectures and web-based self-learning, posters located near points of care and verbal reminders by control nurses. New observations of hand hygiene by control nurses during 3 days and hand cultures of 50 healthcare providers were performed in September 2012. Consumption of alcohol-based hand rub (product volume use per patient-days) was used as a surrogate marker of hand hygiene over time. The diff erence in hand hygiene compliance during the two periods was examined using a chi-squared test. Diff erences in hand cultures were examined using a Student's t test.

Our previous Introduction Sepsis and septic shock are complex infl ammatory syndromes. Multiple cellular activation processes are involved, and many humoral cascades are triggered. Presumably, endothelial cells play a pivotal rule in the pathogenesis of sepsis, not only because they may infl uence the infl ammatory cascade but also because, upon interaction with excessive amounts of infl ammatory mediators, the function of these cells may become impaired. It is likely that a general dysfunction of the endothelium is a key event in the pathogenesis of sepsis [1] . HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors have been shown to exhibit pronounced immunomodulatory eff ects independent of lipid lowering. Most of these benefi cial eff ects of statins appear to involve restoring or improving endothelial function [2] . We hypothesize that statins can improve endothelial dysfunction in septic patients.

We enrolled adult patients within 24 hours of severe sepsis or septic shock diagnosis and randomized them to placebo or atorvastatin 80 mg/day for a short term.

Methods Ventilated patients fulfi lling the criteria for severe sepsis and ALI were enrolled in this multicenter randomized, controlled, openlabel study comparing standard of care with or without hemoperfusion treatment. Primary endpoints were safety and IL-6 reduction. Treated patients underwent hemoperfusion at fl ow rates of ~200 to 300 ml/ minute for 6 hours per day for 7 consecutive days. The overall mean reduction in individual plasma cytokines for the control and treatment groups during the treatment period was calculated using a generalized linear model. Results Forty-three patients (18 treated, 25 control) completed the study and were further analyzed. Incidence of organ dysfunction at enrollment (treatment vs. control) was: septic shock (94% vs. 100%, P = 0.42), acute respiratory distress syndrome (67% vs. 56%, P = 0.33), and renal failure (39% vs. 24%, P = 0.54). During 115 treatments no serious device-related adverse events occurred. On average, there were no changes in hematology and other blood parameters except for a modest reduction in platelet count (<10%) and albumin (<5%) with treatment. Hemoperfusion decreased IL-6 blood concentration signifi cantly (-49.1%, P = 0.01), with similar reductions of MCP-1 (-49.5%, P = 0.002), IL-1ra (-36.5%, P = 0.001), and IL-8 (-30.2%, P = 0.002).

The aim of our study was to determine whether endotoxin elimination treatment added to the standard treatment would improve organ function in patients with septic shock. Methods Adult patients with septic shock who required renal replacement therapy (RRT), with a confi rmed endotoxemia, and suspected Gram-negative infection were consecutively added to the study within the fi rst 24 hours after diagnosis. All patients received full standard treatment for septic shock. Endotoxin elimination was performed using the membrane oXiris (Gambro, Sweden), a medical device for continued RRT with the unique feature of endotoxin adsorbtion. An endotoxin activity assay was used to monitor endotoxin elimination therapy at baseline (T0), 3 hours (T1), 12 hours (T2), 24 hours (T3), 48 hours (T4), and 72 hours (T5). Our key indicators were the improvement in hemodynamics and organ function, and decrease of endotoxin activity (EA) in blood. Continuous variables are presented as mean values with standard deviations. Results High EA level at baseline (0.74 \u00b1 0.14 endotoxin activity units (EAU)) signifi cantly decreased during RRT with oXiris membrane to 0.46 \u00b1 0.02 (T1), 0.34 \u00b1 0.01 (T2), 0.4 \u00b1 0.02 (T3), 0.46 \u00b1 0.04 (T4), 0.35 \u00b1 0.07 (T5) EAU (P <0.05). MAP increased from baseline 72 \u00b1 14 to 81 \u00b1 18, 76 \u00b1 6, 77 \u00b1 7, 83 \u00b1 13, 87 \u00b1 10 mmHg (P <0.05), and the mean norepinephrine use decreased from 0.23 \u00b1 0.04 to 0.19 \u00b1 0.02, 0.11 \u00b1 0.01, 0.09 \u00b1 0.01, 0.04 \u00b1 0.01, 0.0 \u03bcg/kg/minute (P <0.05) at T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, respectively. The SOFA score had decreased from 14 \u00b1 4 to 12 \u00b1 2, 9 \u00b1 3, 7 \u00b1 3 points (P <0.05), and the procalcitonin level declined from 107 \u00b1 123 to 45 \u00b1 41, 29 \u00b1 30, 17 \u00b1 157 \u00b1 1 ng/ml (P <0.05) at T0, T3, T4, T5.",

The therapy was associated with an increase in blood pressure, a reduction of vasopressor requirements, and an improvement of organ function. The application of the endotoxin activity assay was useful for bedside monitoring of endotoxemia in ICU patients. Introduction Severe sepsis and septic shock remain the most serious problem of critical care medicine with a mortality rate of 30 to 55% [1] . Several studies have demonstrated positive eff ects of selective adsorption of LPS on blood pressure, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, endotoxin removal and mortality [2, 3] . The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effi ciency of using the selective adsorption of LPS, Toraymyxin -PMX-F (Toray, Japan) and Alteco\u00ae LPS Adsorber (Alteco Medical AB, Sweden), in the complex treatment of patients with severe sepsis. Methods Forty-six patients with Gram-negative sepsis in the postoperative period were enrolled into the study. Toraymyxin -PMX-F was used in the PMX-F group (n = 14), while Alteco LPS adsorption was used in the Alteco LPS group (n = 32). The clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1 . The SOFA score, PaO 2 /FiO 2 , procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), endotoxin activity assay (EAA) was noted before, 24 and 48 hours after the selective adsorption of LPS.",

Introduction Corticosteroid (CS) therapy in sepsis remains controversial and was fi rst introduced in sepsis management for its antiinfl ammatory property. CS has found a role in septic shock amelioration with inconsistent outcomes. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) includes CS as a Level 2C recommendation in septic shock [1] . Adapting and practicing SSC guidelines vary between critical care units. Accordingly, a survey was conducted to elucidate the usage of CS for septic shock by UK critical care physicians (CCPs). Methods Following approval by the UK Intensive Care Society (ICS), the survey was publicised on the ICS website and its newsletter. Results A total of 81 intensivists responded to this online survey. Seventy-four (92.5%) CCPs prescribed CS only if the septic shock is poorly responsive to fl uid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. Six (7.5%) initiated CS at the same time as vasopressor therapy. None initiated CS for patients with severe sepsis. No CS other than hydrocortisone is being used. The most commonly used intravenous regimen is 50 mg 6 hourly (65%) followed by 50 mg 8 hourly (11%). Only 10% of CCPs would prescribe it by infusion. Less commonly used regimens were 100 mg 8 hourly (6%) and 100 mg 6 hourly (5%). Only 5% would consider adding fl udrocortisone. Prior to initiating CS, 5% of CCPs would perform a short synacthen test, while 94% would not. The majority (89%) of CCPs would stop CS after resolution of shock state or when vasopressor infusion is terminated whilst 11% after a fi xed duration. Withdrawal of CS also diff ered, in that 25% tapered/weaned steroids, 31% stopped it abruptly and 44% of CCPs would base their CS cessation pattern on the clinical context. Only 46% of CCPs believe that CS is benefi cial whereas 44% were unsure of the benefi ts in septic shock. Only 29 (36%) responders indicated that their critical care unit had a written protocol for CS in septic shock. Conclusion The perceptions, usage and cessation of CS in septic shock vary but do appear to have shifted in the last decade. A UK survey in 2003 identifi ed that only 60% of ICUs used CS for septic shock and over 22% perform a short synacthen test [2] . It appears that many intensivists are using CS for septic shock, despite confl icting outcome data. We all strive to practice evidence-based medicine but until we have a robust, reliable and methodical randomised control trial that attempts to resolve the CS debate, practice will remain diverse on this subject, as refl ected by our survey. References Introduction From December 2009 to December 2010, 47 patients in Scotland presented with confi rmed anthrax infection manifested by soft tissue disease related to heroin injection. These cases represent the fi rst known outbreak of a recently recognized form of anthrax, termed injectional anthrax, which appears to be associated with a high mortality rate (28% in confi rmed cases from the UK outbreak). While epidemiologic data from this outbreak have been published, no report has systematically described fi ndings in patients at presentation or compared these fi ndings in nonsurvivors and survivors. Methods To better describe injectional anthrax, we developed a questionnaire and sent it to clinicians who had cared for confi rmed cases during the outbreak. Completed questionnaires describing 27 patients, 11 nonsurvivors and 16 survivors, were returned. Results In preliminary analysis of categorical data, a signifi cantly (Fisher exact test) greater proportion of patients with compared with without the following fi ndings did not survive; history of alcohol use (P = 0.05); the presence of lethargy (P = 0.01), confusion (P = 0.03), nausea (P = 0.04), abdominal pain (P = 0.02), or the need for vasopressors (P = 0.002), oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or steroids (all P = 0.004) at presentation; and excessive bleeding at surgery (P = 0.01). Initial analysis of continuous data demonstrated that, compared with survivors at presentation, nonsurvivors had signifi cantly (one-way ANOVA) increased respiratory rate, percent neutrophils on complete blood count, hemoglobin, INR, C-reactive protein, and bilirubin and signifi cantly decreased temperature, systolic blood pressure, platelets, sodium, albumin, calcium (corrected for albumin), base excess and bicarbonate (all P \u22640.05).",

Patients were submitted to block randomization and stratifi ed on the basis of their initial SAPS II exp score. Antibiotic therapy was started on the day of inclusion in the treatment group and only with proven Gr(+) pathogen in the control group. Initial data were gathered on demographics, diagnosis, proven risk factors for sepsis-related mortality, severity of infl ammatory response, ventilator-associated pneumonia and organ dysfunction. Dynamics of SIRS, CPIS and SOFA scores, subsequent infectious isolates, ventilator-free days, length of ICU stay and outcome were followed for each patient. Results A total of 170 patients were enrolled. No statistically signifi cant diff erences in their basal characteristics were found. The subsequent score values, length of ICU stay and the number of ventilator-free days were also comparable between groups. The majority of Gr(+) pathogens were isolated between 6 and 10 days of inclusion. No diff erences were found regarding the concomitant Gr(-) fl ora and the related antibiotic therapy. The new organ dysfunction severity was similar in both groups (P = 0.37). The in-hospital mortality was 26.2% in the treatment group versus 18.6% in the control group (P = 0.56). Signifi cant diff erences between the Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were also not found (log-rank test P = 0.81). No major adverse reactions were observed. Conclusion The implementation of this new policy failed to reduce the degree of organ dysfunction severity and was not associated with signifi cant survival benefi t. Moreover, even though it did not reach statistical signifi cance, a second peak of Gr(+) isolates was observed as a possible complication of the preemptive therapy. Whether this approach could lead to vancomycin MIC creep or there could still be a niche for it later in the course of treatment and/or in nontrauma patients remains to be further explored.

The aim of our study is to investigate the risk factors associated with A. baum bacteremia and its mortality rates. Introduction The French military hospital at the Kaboul International Airport (KaIA) base provides surgical care for International Force and Afghan National Army soldiers, and also local patients. The development of multiresistant bacteria (MRB) nosocomial infections has raised a major problem complicating the care of combat casualties [1] . The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of MRB carriage on admission to the ICU in this combat support hospital. Methods We used a prospective observation study on patients admitted to the French military ICU in KaIA over 3 months (July to September 2012). All hospitalized patients were assessed for the presence of colonization with MRB: nasal and rectal swabs were performed to identify, respectively, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases bacteria (ESBLB).",

Results Over the study period, 100 patients fulfi lled the inclusion criteria: 54 in the SD group (50 mg every 12 hours) and 46 in the HD group (100 mg every 12 hours). The SD group and the HD group were not signifi cantly diff erent in terms of age, severity of disease, duration of TGC therapy, rate of concomitant other active antibiotic use and of inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy (IIAT) (P = NS).

No signifi cant diff erences were found in terms of ICU mortality (P = 0.8). The rate of abnormal laboratory measures during TGC treatment was similar between the two groups (P = NS). No patients required TGC discontinuation or dose reduction because of suspected adverse events.

Table 1 shows multivariate analysis of clinical cure predictors in the VAP subgroup. Conclusion In critically ill patients, HD TGC use seems to be safe and, combined with other active antibiotics, may increase the rate of MDR germ VAP clinical success.

Multivariate linear regression analysis was done for several parameters: administered dose calculated with total body weight, ideal body weight, adjusted body weight, type of intensive care patient, BMI, daily fl uid balance, SOFA score and APACHE score, and patient characteristics were analyzed. Results A linear correlation between dose and amikacin peak level was confi rmed (Figure 1) . A total 54.69% of all amikacin administrations did not result in a therapeutic peak level. The multivariate linear regression analysis showed the best linear correlation with adjusted body weight and SOFA score. The comparison of variables between four patient groups, based on the deviation between measured peak level and predicted peak level (according the linear correlation), showed new variables that may infl uence peak level. Conclusion This confi rms that low doses (<18 mg/kg) of amikacin in intensive care patients seldom result in a therapeutic peak level. The proposed loading dose of 25 mg/kg is good for reaching a therapeutic level, although 29.6% remains subtherapeutic. Due to the linear correlation, more therapeutic levels may be reached with higher doses (25 to 30 mg/kg). New variables need further investigation to explain the high variability in achieved peak level.",

The addition of probiotics to the standard perioperative regime is associated with a small survival benefi t of 1.2 months, yet a cost reduction of \u00a3917.3/ADD patient. The main cost was increased duration of ICU stay and readmissions, which contribute to 85% of total expenses.

Introduction Novel treatment strategies for invasive candidiasis (IC) are constantly emerging. Nevertheless, diffi culties in diagnosis pose a challenge on their reliability, effi cacy and safety. We have previously developed and approbated in our ICU an algorithm for empirical antimycotic therapy, combining the most signifi cant risk factors for IC with three major clinical criteria for persistent nonbacterial sepsis [1] . On the other hand, preemptive therapy, based on identifi cation of mycotic antigens and/or anti-mycotic antibodies in serum, is regarded as more reliable, even though it is known for its low sensitivity. The aim of the current study was to compare and evaluate the possible outcome benefi t of our protocol implementation versus detection of galactomanan in patient's serum as a trigger for antimycotic treatment initiation. Methods A randomized prospective controlled trial was carried out from September 2010 to September 2012. After the implication of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients were submitted to block randomization and stratifi ed on the basis of their initial SAPS II exp score. Antimycotic therapy was started on the day of inclusion in the control group and only with positive galactomanan serum test in the preemptive therapy group. Initial data were gathered on demographics, proven risk factors for IC-related mortality, severity of infl ammatory response and organ dysfunction. Dynamics of SIRS and SOFA values, Candida colonization index, ventilator-free days, length of ICU stay and outcome were followed for each patient. Results A total of 106 patients were enrolled. No statistically signifi cant diff erences in their basal characteristics were found. The subsequent SIRS and SOFA scores showed fi rm dynamics in the control group, although the new organ dysfunction severity was insignifi cantly lower. The length of ICU stay and the number of ventilator-free days were comparable. The in-hospital mortality was 47.1% in the preemptive therapy group versus 31.3% in the control group (P = 0.94). A total of seven adverse reactions were observed among treated patients, yet not associated with higher mortality risk. Conclusion The choice of empirical versus preemptive therapy led to earlier and more stable reduction in the degree of organ dysfunction severity. It showed to be at least not inferior if not equal; in terms of survival benefi t and expediency of treatment. Moreover, galactomanan detection fails to guide the choice of the individual antimycotic, based on the expected Candida spp. Reference Introduction Invasive candidemia is a major cause of increased mortality among ICU patients. Antifungal agents like liposomale amphotericin B and azoles could not accomplish the claim to be fi rst choice in the treatment of invasive fungal infection (IFI) because of side eff ects and eff ectiveness. Especially, cardiothoracic surgery patients as a group of high-risk patients are in a focus for new strategies and agents. A new class of antimycotic agents, the echinocandins, with a low profi le of side eff ects, low interactive potential and high eff ectiveness in the treatment of candidemia, is a powerful option in the treatment of IFI. We report our single-center experience with a modifi ed clinical treatment approach based on clinical score of Leon and using echinocandins as fi rst-line therapy for proven and suspected fungal infection. Methods From May 2011 to October 2012, 2,844 patients were treated on our cardiothoracic ICU. We evaluated 37 cardiothoracic postoperative patients with proven or suspected IFI or prophylaxis ( Figure 1 ). The records were evaluated for cardiothoracic procedures, microbiological and yeast date, cardiothoracic surgery score (CASUS), ICU and clinical data.",

The relationship between colonization and invasive fungal infection (IFI) in severely ill ICU patients with a VAD support is not described. This study analyzes the incidence and outcome of fungal infection and colonization in VAD patients in bridge to transplantation or in destination therapy. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of all VAD implantations in our surgical ICU between 2007 and 2012. The incidence of fungal colonization, antifungal prophylaxis, bacterial sepsis and the mortality of IFI versus no IFI patients were compared. Results In the study period, 34 patients with severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock were selected for a VAD implantation (nine in destination therapy). The overall mortality rate was 50% during mechanical assistance. Confi rmed (n = 8) and highly suspected (n = 2) IFI occurred during the ICU stay in 29% of patients who were treated with echinocandins, voriconazole and/or liposomal amphotericin B. The isolated fungi were: six Candida albicans, two parapsilosis, one glabrata and one invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Antifungal prophylaxis with fl uconazole was administered to 18% of patients at mean for 5 days mainly in the more recent implantations. In the no IFI population, 54% (n = 13) had a systemic or VAD bacterial sepsis with a mortality rate about 54%. The mortality without any sepsis was reduced to 18%. Fungal colonization was signifi cantly more present (90% vs. 50%) before IFI in VAD patients. The mortality rate was dramatically higher with IFI (80% vs. 38%) in accordance with the literature [1] . See Table 1 . Conclusion In our center, we observed a high incidence of IFI in ICU patients with VAD that was associated with a mortality rate of 80%. Screening of fungal colonization appears to be very important during the ICU stay for VAD patients. Trials are needed for investigating the use, the drug choice and the timing of antifungal prophylaxis for such high-risk patients. Reference",

A cost-eff ectiveness model developed from a UK perspective examined costs and outcomes of antifungal treatment for candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis based on European clinical guidelines [1] . Methods Costs and treatment outcomes with the echinocandin anidula fungin were compared with caspofungin, micafungin, fl uconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. The model included non-neutropenic patients aged \u226516 years with confi rmed candidaemia/ another form of invasive candidiasis receiving intravenous fi rst-line treatment [2] . Patients were categorised as a clinical success or failure (patients with persistent/breakthrough infection); frequency data for each outcome were taken from a mixed-treatment comparison [3] . Successfully treated patients switched to oral therapy. Clinical failures switched to a diff erent antifungal class. It was assumed that second-line treatment duration was equivalent to that of fi rst-line treatment and only two lines of therapy were required to treat infection. Other inputs were all-cause 6-week mortality, cost of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and other medical resource use costs. Life-years were calculated using a published model [4] . Antifungal agent-related AEs were taken from the product label/literature. Resource use was derived from the literature and discussion with clinical experts. Drug acquisition/ administration costs were taken from standard UK costing sources. Results First-line anidulafungin for treatment of candidaemia was cost-eff ective per life-year gained versus fl uconazole (incremental cost-eff ectiveness ratio \u00a3813). Anidulafungin was cost saving versus caspofungin and micafungin in terms of life-years gained due to lower ICU costs and a higher rate of survival combined with a higher probability of clinical success. Conclusion Anidulafungin was cost-eff ective compared with fl uconazole for treatment of candidaemia and was cost saving versus other echinocandins in the UK. European guidelines recommend echinocandins as fi rst-line treatments for candidaemia [1] ; this model indicates that anidulafungin marries clinical eff ectiveness and cost-eff ectiveness.",

Results Analyzable questionnaire responses were received from 200 ICU physicians and nurses. The majority of respondents believed that oxygen-induced lung injury is a concern, although barotrauma and volutrauma are generally considered to impose a greater risk in mechanical ventilation. Frequently allowed minimal saturation ranges in the questionnaire were 85 to 95% and 7 to 10 kPa ( Figure 1 ). Selfreported FiO 2 adjustment in hypothetical patient cases with variable saturation levels was moderately impacted by the underlying clinical condition. To study actual clinical practice, a total of 107,888 ABG samples with corresponding ventilator settings, covering 5,565 patient admissions, were retrieved.

The secondary aim is to evaluate pressure-volume (P-V) relationships. Spontaneous modes of ventilation have been associated with lower rates of atelectasis, less muscle atrophy, better airfl ow distribution and importantly lower sedation requirements, which relates to lower mortality. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the use of PSV in patients with moderate/severe lung injury would have rates of pneumothorax and mortality within the standard of care. We further hypothesized that given its spontaneous nature, set pressures (PEEP and PS) but not tidal volume (Vt) would be related to airway pressures.

The standard therapy for patients with ARDS does typically apply a mechanical ventilator to support breathing. The cost of therapy is high and it requires much attention from physicians to adjust the proper ventilation settings in a timely manner. A closed-loop ventilation concept has therefore been developed and tested with two induced ARDS pigs. Methods The hardware system is composed of a ventilator (Servo 300), a spectrophotometry (CEVOX), a capnography device (CO2SMO+), an electrical impedance tomography device (GOE MF II) and a patient monitor (Sirecust). The software is developed with Labview 7.1. With approval from the ethical committee, two 27 kg pigs were exposed to surfactant depletion with a warm saline washout to induce ARDS (PaO 2 / FiO 2 <200 mmHg). One pig model was ventilated with an automatic ARDSNet protocol and another was automatically ventilated with open lung management. Blood gas analysis (BGA) was carried out every half an hour. Results Artifi cial ventilation using the auto ARDSNet protocol successfully stabilized oxygenation, minimized plateau pressure (<30 cmH 2 O), and controlled the pH value for acidosis and alkalosis management. On the other hand, auto open lung management off ers a distinctive result of ventilation. A signifi cant improvement of oxygenation and lung compliance was observed within a few breaths after the recruitment maneuvers. Both subjects were ventilated at the same tidal volume of 6 ml/kg and the comparative results of automatic ventilation settings and BGA are provided in Table 1 for every 2 hours.",

The pressures and volumes needed to induce VILI in healthy animals are far greater than pressure and volumes applied in clinical practice [1] . A possible explanation may be the presence of local pressure multipliers (stress raisers). Methods We retrospectively analyzed CT scans of 147 patients with ARDS and CT scans of 100 healthy subjects. A homogeneous lung would have the same gas/tissue ratio in all its regions. If a lung region expands less than the neighbour regions these will be more strained to vicariate the non/less expanding region. We measured the stress raisers by computing the ratio between the gas fraction of the region of interest and the neighbouring regions: if the infl ation would be the same (homogeneity), the ratio will be equal to one; if the infl ation of the surrounding regions would be greater than the region of interest (that is, more strained), the ratio between the two will be greater than one and was taken as a measure of stress raiser. We considered pathological stress raisers as the regions showing infl ation ratio greater than the 95th percentile of the control group (1.61) and defi ned as the extent of the stress raisers the fraction of lung volume above this threshold.",

Methods Twenty pigs, group Protective Ventilation (PV), were ventilated with low VT (6 ml/kg) and PEEP 10 cmH 2 O while 10 pigs, group Control (C), were ventilated with a VT of 10 ml/kg and PEEP 5 cmH 2 O.

Laparotomy for 2 hours simulated a surgical procedure after which baseline ensued and a continuous endotoxin infusion was started at 0.25 \u03bcg/kg/hour for 5 hours. Diff erences were analyzed with ANOVA for repeated measures. Results TNF\u03b1 levels were higher in the hepatic vein than in the artery, the jugular bulb and the portal vein. IL-6 levels were higher in the artery and the jugular bulb compared with the portal and hepatic veins. IL-10 levels were higher in the portal vein compared with the jugular bulb and hepatic vein. The organ-specifi c IL-10 concentrations were all higher than the arterial concentration. Comparison between the ventilation groups showed that TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-10 in the hepatic vein were higher in group C compared with group PV at the end of the experiment. Peak concentrations of TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 in the portal vein were higher in group C compared with group PV. In this experiment TNF\u03b1 was mainly generated in the  liver while the results point to signifi cant nonhepatic IL-6 and IL-10 production. Ventilation with low VT and medium-high PEEP attenuated hepatic and splanchnic cytokine production compared with mediumhigh VT and lower PEEP. Reference Introduction Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) allows spontaneous breathing throughout the ventilation cycle. It increases venous return and cardiac index, which will signifi cantly improve organ perfusion. This is important in septic shock patients to prevent extrathoracic organ system failure secondary to poor perfusion. Benefi ts of APRV with cardiovascular changes are noticed in patients with acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. It is not well established whether applying APRV will improve the survival outcome for septic shock patients. The primary outcome is whether the use of APRV in septic shock patients restores hemodynamic stability earlier than the CMV mode. The secondary hypothesis is whether the use of APRV in septic shock patients improves their survival in the ICU. Methods After Institutional Review Board approval, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 129 septic shock patients who received ventilator support between January and December 2011 at a tertiary care hospital. The Cox proportional hazards model was used in adjusting potential confounding factors. The nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to assess signifi cant outcome diff erences between groups. Time to event/survival data will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. These analyses were accomplished using SAS, version 9.3. Results Among the 187 patients, 58 were excluded as per the exclusion criteria: incomplete data (n = 28), do not resuscitate (n = 16), ICU readmission (n = 12) and head injury (n = 4). Finally, 129 patients were included, from these 91 received CMV and 38 received APRV. At the beginning of the study, there were no diff erences between the groups in relation to hemodynamic parameters. Reversal of shock achieved in less than 72 hours was statistically signifi cant between the groups (APRV, n = 16 (42%) and CMV, n = 8 (9%), P = 0.0101). The proportion of patients recovering from septic shock after initiation of ventilator therapy was higher in APRV than the CMV group (72% vs. 49%, respectively, P <0.0001). The mortality rate was signifi cantly higher in CMV (n = 46, 51%) as compared with APRV (n = 11, 29%) (P = 0.022).",

The prone position (PP) may reduce atelectasis, and improves oxygenation and outcome in severe hypoxemic patients in ARDS [2] , but little is known about its eff ect in obese ARDS patients. Introduction Protective mechanical ventilation (MV) in ARDS is based on reduced stretch of pulmonary tissue, sometimes resulting in severe hypoventilation that can be avoided when using high respiratory rate. High-frequency positive-pressure ventilation (HFPPV) has not been fully explored, especially when associated with other strategies aiming to avoid hypercapnia. Methods We induced ARDS in eight pigs by lung lavage with saline plus 3 hours of injurious MV with low PEEP and high driving pressure (DP). We then performed a recruitment maneuver (RM) followed by PEEP titration using the amount of alveolar collapse in electrical impedance tomography (EIT). Then stabilization during 1 hours with tidal volume (VT) at 6 ml/kg, respiratory rate (RR) 35 breaths/minute and PEEP selected with the PEEP-FiO 2 table (ARMA study), which was kept constant during two steps of HFPPV with a RR 60: one without an inspiratory pause (HFPPV-60), and one with a pause of 30% of inspiratory time (HFPPV-60 w/P30%). In another HFPPV step, we used PEEP titrated with EIT after RM (HFPPV-60 w/RM). During each HFPPV step, VT was set to reach a PaCO 2 of 60 \u00b1 3 mmHg. Distribution of regional ventilation was analyzed using EIT. Equilibrium was considered if PaCO 2 was stable (<5% of variation) for >30 minutes.",

This study aimed at characterizing HFPV as delivered by Percussionnaire VDR4\u00ae and at evaluating how hypobarism interferes with HFPV, in order to assess its usability at altitude. Methods Using a mechanical test lung mimicking ARDS (compliance 17 ml/cmH 2 O) with two resistance levels (5 and 15 cmH 2 O/l/second) and ventilated with VDR4\u00ae in a hypobaric chamber, ascents/descents between 0 and 5,000 and then 0 and 8,000 ft were performed. Adjustable VDR4\u00ae parameters were modifi ed one at a time at each altitude. Besides these parameters (cross-measured with standalone hardware), oxygen consumption of the respirator and three calculated parameters were studied: low-frequency tidal volume (Vt, integrated from instantaneous fl ows measured with a Fleisch pneumotachograph), end-inspiratory (PmEI) and end-expiratory (PmEE) mean pressures. PmEI and PmEE in HFPV refl ect plateau pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure in conventional ventilation. The correction of altitude-induced off set with the modifi cation of working pressure was also tested. Results Data displayed by VDR4\u00ae overestimated pulmonary pressures by more than 10%, but were reliable for other parameters. During ascent, an off set appeared for all respiratory parameters: Vt increased by 59% and PmEI by 53% between 0 and 8,000 ft. During descent, the off set was reversely directed with a 39% decrease in Vt and a 28% decrease in PmEE between 8,000 and 0 ft. Modifying working pressure adequately corrected PmEI and PmEE, but not Vt. In all cases, manually correcting VDR4\u00ae parameters to their 0 ft level also corrected these off sets. Multivariate analysis further established that, adjusting for other parameters, Vt, PmEI and PmEE did practically not depend on altitude. Oxygen consumption of the respirator was high, 25 l/minute at 0 ft, and stable with altitude. It was reduced with percussive rate and with FiO 2 . Conclusion HFPV can be safely used at altitude, provided that VDR4\u00aedisplayed parameters are used to manually adjust settings in order to avoid exposing patients to volutrauma or barotrauma during ascent, and to major hypoventilation and alveolar collapse during descent. The high oxygen consumption is currently the main limit to its use for longrange aeromedical evacuations.",

Methods We recalculated the recruited volume (RV) in 25 patients with ARDS [3] according to the method proposed by Dellamonica and colleagues during an incremental PEEP manoeuvre (PEEP increased until the plateau pressure reached 45 cmH 2 O). RV was calculated as the change in end-expiratory lung volume minus total respiratory system compliance times the PEEP change (RV = \u0394EELV -CTOT\u00d7\u0394PEEP). For comparison, 12 patients with HL undergoing elective surgery in general anaesthesia were measured using the same protocol. Results Both ARDS and HL patients exhibited typical P-V curves and stepwise recruitment ( Figure 1 ). By raising PEEP from 0 to 12 cmH 2 O, ARDS patients recruited 331 \u00b1 195 ml (mean \u00b1 SD) and HL patients 435 \u00b1 43 ml. There was a strong correlation (R 2 = 0.88) of the total RV with the end-inspiratory volume at a plateau pressure of 45 cmH 2 O in both groups; that is, recruitment was found to the same extent in both groups ( Figure 2 ). Conclusion The relative contribution of RV to lung volume gain is similar in ARDS and in patients with healthy lungs. Our results question the relevance of recruitability as defi ned by Dellamonica and colleagues as a typical phenomenon of ARDS, but support the baby lung concept, as the recruited volume was closely related to the size of the lung.",

Reference Introduction The usefulness of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is being rediscovered in the wake of the pandemic of H1N1 infl uenza. However, it has been reported that patients who received ECMO often developed virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS), compared with those without ECMO support. Although there is ample evidence that extensive cytokine activation is a key factor in VAHS, ECMO itself could be a potential trigger to exacerbate the pathology by amplifying cytokine activation. In this study, we investigated whether mediators such as cytokines may be produced by ECMO. Methods Patients with severe respiratory failure who were placed on ECMO were enrolled between June and July 2012. This study was approved by the ethics committee. Blood specimens were drawn from the blood circuit at the inlet of the centrifugal pump (before) and outlet of the hollow fi ber oxygenator (after) at a frequency of three to four times per day. Blood IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN\u03b3, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b2, and TNF\u03b1 were measured globally using a multiplex cytokine bead array system (Bio-Plex; Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan). HMGB1 was measured using an ELISA kit (Shino-Test, Tokyo, Japan). Results Two patients with interstitial pneumonia were studied. The ECMO system consisted of a Rotafl ow Centrifugal Pump (Maquet Japan, Tokyo, Japan), a Biocube TNC coating 6000 (NIPRO, Osaka, Japan), and a percutaneous cardiopulmonary support system (Capiox EBS; Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). The blood fl ow rate was 2.0 \u00b1 4.0 l/minute. A total of 34 blood sets were collected. In most cases, blood levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17, GM-CSF, IFN\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1 were below the detection limit and did not increase during ECMO.

Invasive mechanical ventilation could worsen lung hyperinfl ation and produce a vicious circle. We investigated whether increasing extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO 2 Cl) could reduce the respiratory rate (RR), so prolonging time for lung emptying and allowing resolution of hyperinfl ation. Methods Six patients with COPD exacerbation with respiratory acidosis (PaCO 2 83 \u00b1 27 mmHg, pH 7.19 \u00b1 0.1) and tachypnea (RR 39 \u00b1 5) despite maximal non-invasive ventilation underwent venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). All patients were awake and spontaneously breathing an adequate air-oxygen mixture to correct hypoxemia (PaO 2 72 \u00b1 27 mmHg). While keeping the blood fl ow stable (2.9 \u00b1 0.5 l/minute), we changed the gas fl ow of the artifi cial lung to modify the extracorporeal CO 2 clearance as a percentage of total patient CO 2 production (% ECCO 2 Cl/total VCO 2 ) and we observed the variations of RR. We recorded RR at three levels of gas fl ow in each patient ( Figure 1) .",

The selected maximal gas fl ow was variable between diff erent patients (6.7 \u00b1 2 l/minute), corresponding to diff erent levels of ECCO 2 Cl/total VCO 2 (83 \u00b1 17%, range 53 to 100%) and RR response (8 \u00b1 4, range 5 to 14). Conclusion In patients with COPD exacerbation, who failed noninvasive ventilation, VV-ECMO allows one to maintain spontaneous breathing. Titration of extracorporeal CO 2 removal leads to control RR. This approach could interrupt the vicious circle of dynamic hyperinfl ation and allow the defl ation of lung parenchyma. Table 1 presents the main results. The CO 2 removal by membrane oxygenator ranged from 56 to 37 ml/minute. All patients survived to the treatment and 7/10 were weaned from the ventilator at the end of ECCO 2 removal. Only one oxygenator was used for every patient without clotting of the circuit or any major bleeding problem. ",

In this study we hypothesize that the successive change in lung volume during a PEEP-step manoeuvre could be predicted from \u0394PEEP and lung elastance as \u0394PEEP/EL. The objective of the study was to validate this hypothesis in patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Methods Thirteen patients with ARF were studied during an incremental PEEP trial, 0-4-8-12-16 cmH 2 O. \u0394EELV was determined as the change in expiratory tidal volume following each PEEP step. Conventional calculation of lung elastance was obtained from tidal variation in airway pressure minus tidal variation in oesophageal pressure divided by tidal volume. Position of the oesophageal catheter was verifi ed according to Baydur [2] . The measured change in end-expiratory lung volume during the PEEP-step manoeuvre using spirometry was compared with the end-expiratory lung volume change calculated from EL and stepwise changes in PEEP as \u0394PEEP/EL. Results There was a close correlation between the measured build-up of end-expiratory lung volume during a PEEP-step manoeuvre and \u0394PEEP/EL where EL was conventionally determined using oesophageal pressure measurements (see Figure 1 ). Conclusion Esophageal pressure measurements are diffi cult to perform [3] and rarely used in routine clinical practice. Our fi ndings indicate that a change in PEEP together with measurements of the resulting change in end-expiratory volume by spirometry in the ventilator could be used to determine lung elastance separately, the relation between lung and chest wall elastance as well as the transpulmonary pressure. References Introduction Long-term use of mechanical ventilators may lead to ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD) and increase the duration of weaning from MV [1] . It was hypothesized that stimulating the diaphragm during MV may prevent VIDD and may lead to early weaning [2] . In this study, the feasibility of generating coordinated contraction of both diaphragms was investigated using a novel transvenous diaphragmatic pacing system. Methods Two juvenile pigs were anesthetized with propofol (150 to 250 \u03bcg/kg/minute) and ventilated (VENT) with an assist control mode MV (Nellcor Puritan Bennett 840). Using fl uoroscopy, a novel multipolar neurostimulation catheter (Inspirx RL PICC53; Respithera, Bloomington, MN, USA) was threaded into the left internal jugular vein and advanced to the junction of right atrium and the superior vena cava using a modifi ed Seldinger technique. The successful capture of the right and left phrenic nerves was confi rmed by fl uoroscopic visualization. Peak airway pressures (PAWP) and blood gases were determined after 10 minutes MV (MV), MV and stimulation applied together (MV+STIM) and stimulation only (STIM).",

Introduction Retrospective studies suggest that cardiac troponin levels are often elevated in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) indicating a poor survival. Novel high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTnT) assays have better analytical precision than standard troponin (cTnT) assays. We elaborated a prospective cohort study to investigate the prognostic value of this novel biomarker in patients with AECOPD. Methods Fifty-six patients (mean age 64 years, 68% male) with the fi nal diagnosis of AECOPD were enrolled. Those who were diagnosed with acute coronary syndromes were excluded. We measured cardiac troponin T with a standard fourth-generation assay and a highsensitivity assay. Clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data were collected at admission and the primary prognostic endpoint was death during 30 days of follow-up. Introduction British Thoracic Society guidelines on communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) advocate ICU referral for patients with CURB65 score of 4 and 5. A recently developed scoring system, SMART-COP, designed to identify patients at need of intensive respiratory or vasopressor support (IRVS), has been validated in a variety of settings. It predicts the need for ICU admission (defi ned as need for IRVS) with greater accuracy than CURB65, but is not used routinely in our UK institution.",

Tidal volumes decreased when decreasing assist levels during PS whereas not during NAVA ventilation. The electrical activity of the diaphragm decreased in both PS and NAVA with higher levels of assist. Three patients showed an increase in dependent tidal impedance variation (TIV) after lowering the assist level from 15 to 10 cmH 2 O. This increase in TIV did not occur during NAVA ventilation. Conclusion There is more ventilation in the dependent part of the lung, compared with the nondependent part, at lower levels of assist. This could indicate that at higher support levels the contribution of the diaphragm is reduced. During NAVA ventilation, there is an autoregulation in which the patient is adjusting his tidal ventilation to maintain homogeneous ventilation distribution.",

Children whose weight was >97 percentile revealed trends towards longer treatment times on BiPAP compared with the other two groups. We explored the feasibility, reliability and physiological signifi cance of diaphragm thickening on ultrasound. Methods Five healthy subjects participated. We monitored inspiratory fl ow, volume, esophageal and gastric pressures, and diaphragm electrical activity (by esophageal and surface electromyography) while subjects performed a series of inspiratory maneuvers: tidal breathing, threshold-loaded breathing, a Muller maneuver, and inspiration to various lung volumes above functional residual capacity. At the end of each inspiratory eff ort, subjects were instructed to close the glottis and relax the respiratory muscles (so as to maintain lung volume while eliminating diaphragm activation). Sonographic images of diaphragm thickening during these maneuvers were obtained using M-mode with a 13 MHz linear array probe placed in the right ninth, 10th, or 11th intercostal space between the middle and anterior axillary lines. Results Diaphragm thickening in the zone of apposition was readily visualized by ultrasound in all fi ve subjects. Mean end-expiratory diaphragm thickness was 2.1 mm (SD = 0.3 mm). During tidal breathing, the diaphragm thickened by a mean of 35% (SD = 31%). The Bland-Altman coeffi cient of reproducibility was 0.5 mm; approximately 50% of measurement variability arose from caliper positioning on the ultrasound machine; diaphragm thickness measurements changed as the probe was placed in diff erent intercostal interspaces. Diaphragm inspiratory thickening increased signifi cantly with increasing inspiratory eff ort but also varied with lung volume independent of eff ort. At inspiratory volumes below 40% of inspiratory capacity, lung volume change contributed minimally to diaphragm thickening. Conclusion Visualizing diaphragm thickening in the zone of apposition by ultrasound provides a feasible non-invasive technique for monitoring diaphragm activation in healthy subjects. Diaphragm thickening primarily refl ects muscular eff ort rather than altered muscle conformation induced by changes in lung volume, especially at lower inspiratory volumes.",

Introduction Emergency endotracheal intubation results in accidental oesophageal intubation in up to 17% of patients often with disastrous consequences. We have previously published a highly specifi c and sensitive novel method to detect endotracheal intubation based on diff erences in ventilation pressure waveforms in the oesophagus and in the trachea in patients with healthy lungs [1] . A detection algorithm, based on diff erences in compliance/elasticity between the lung and the oesophagus, generated a D-value indicating tracheal intubation if D >0.5 and oesophageal intubation if D <0.5. The aim of the current study was to validate the algorithm in patients with lung disease. Methods After obtaining institutional approval, 20 intubated and ventilated ICU patients were included. Inclusion criteria were controlled mechanical ventilation and at least mild to moderate lung injury according to a Murray lung injury score >0.1. A connecting piece was placed between the endotracheal tube and the ventilation bag. This piece comprised a thin air-fi lled catheter inserted through the tube lumen at 1 cm from the distal end, and a second catheter located at the proximal end of the tube. We performed three consecutive manual bag ventilations while recording the pressure curves through both catheters. For each ventilation, a D-value was calculated. Results Mean age (SD) of the patients was 60 (16) years, 60% were male. The mean (SD) Murray score was 1.4 (0.6). Pathologies included pulmonary oedema, pneumonia, atelectasis and traumatic lung injury. All 60 D-values are represented in Figure 1 . The median (IQR, range) D-value was 38 (16 to 74, 0.8 to 1,272). Our algorithm therefore confi rmed a high sensitivity to detect correct endotracheal intubation also in patients with lung disease. Under the hypothesis that oesophageal compliance does not increase signifi cantly in patients with lung disease, the specifi city of our algorithm will not be aff ected. ",

However, the optimal timing or method of performing tracheostomies in this population remains to be established. In the present study, we compared outcomes of early and late tracheostomy in critically adult patients with diff erent clinical conditions. Methods All patients needing tracheostomy in the Critical Care Medical Center of Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital from January 2009 to December 2011 were surveyed. Patients with tracheostomy who were not indicated for mechanical ventilation were excluded from the subjects. Early tracheostomy (ET) was defi ned as <10 days after tracheal intubation and late tracheostomy (LT) was defi ned as \u226510 days after intubation. We compared patient characteristics, type of tracheostomy procedure, length of weaning from ventilator and outcomes between the groups. Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD, with unpaired t test and Mann-Whitney U test used for statistical analyses. Statistical signifi cance was accepted at P <0.05. Results One hundred patients were surveyed. The ET and LT groups included 49 and 51 patients, respectively. Tracheostomy was performed using a percutaneous procedure in 48 patients (ET: 25, LT: 23) and a surgical procedure in 52 patients (ET: 24, LT: 28). Sixty-two patients (ET: 34, LT: 28) survived to discharge and 16 patients died in the ICU (ET: 7, LT: 9). Fifty-six patients (ET: 31, LT: 25) were weaned from ventilator support and tracheostomy cannula was removed in 20 patients (ET: 11, LT: 9). There were no signifi cant diff erences in type of tracheostomy procedure, period from tracheostomy until ICU and hospital discharge, rate of patients who could be weaned from ventilator and removed tracheostomy cannula, and ICU and hospital mortality between the groups. The length of mechanical ventilation and the time to removal of tracheostomy cannula were signifi cantly shorter in the ET group (5 \u00b1 7 vs. 26 \u00b1 41 and 29 \u00b1 24 vs. 94 \u00b1 83 days, respectively). Conclusion In this retrospective study, early tracheostomy reduced the length of weaning after tracheostomy and the time to removal of tracheostomy cannula, while there were no diff erences in the length of ICU stay and patient outcome. In critically ill adult patients who require mechanical ventilation, a tracheostomy performed at an earlier stage may shorten the duration of artifi cial ventilation.

Introduction Eff ective delivery of aerosolized bronchodilators for patients with asthma is crucial for adequate therapy in critical care and emergent settings. Often administered with pressure-metered dose inhalers (pMDIs), bronchodilator delivery depends on the correct patient technique during administration [1] and the ability to measure treatment response, which are diffi cult to monitor at the point of care and particularly so in resource-poor settings where standard inhospital monitoring is unavailable [2] . Methods A point-of-care device for airfl ow measurement during bronchodilator delivery was designed and tested for use in resourcelimited settings. The handheld device was constructed from a clinical aerosol delivery tube with a bidirectional sensor for pressure diff erential detection about the aerosol element ( Figure 1 ). The custom low-cost Introduction Protocol-based care of the tracheostomised patient is important, as adverse events confer a high rate of mortality. Little is known regarding the existence of formal evidence-based guidelines on tracheostomy care. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review for evidence-based guidelines on adult tracheostomy care. Methods A systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, guideline clearinghouses, centres of evidence-based practice, and professional societies' guidelines relating to care of adult patients with a tracheostomy was performed by two reviewers. In addition, a Google search of publicly available tracheostomy care guidelines was performed. Search terms: (tracheostom* OR tracheotom*) AND (protocol* OR guideline* OR standard* OR management OR consensus OR algorithm*).

Five were found to satisfy the AGREE II criteria and only three related to the entire spectrum of tracheostomy management. The majority was informal and was not published or evidence based. Conclusion Five evidence-based guidelines on adult tracheostomy management were identifi ed. This may represent a paucity of evidence on the subject, suggesting that further clinical trials on the topic are needed to contribute to the evidence base. This also highlights the need for international consensus on the topic, to reduce duplication of eff orts, standardise practice, and improve outcomes. [1] concluded that the majority of airway-related signifi cant complications in ICUs resulted from displaced or blocked tracheostomies and recommended together with the Intensive Care Society and the National Tracheostomy Safety Project that each ICU in the UK should have an emergency airway management plan and guidelines [2] . The aim of this survey was to establish whether such guidelines exist and are familiar to those working within the ICUs of the East of England (EoE), their ease of availability in an emergency and the degree of emergency tracheostomy training within the region. Methods Data collection was via a telephone survey of 11 ICUs in the EoE training region during July 2012 with one senior ICU nurse and one ICU trainee questioned per hospital. Questions related to the existence and accessibility of guidelines for tracheostomy emergencies, and to the respondent's degree of emergency tracheostomy training and their perceived availability of formal training. Results All 11 ICUs questioned perform and manage tracheostomies. Of 22 respondents, 10 knew of guidelines covering all of the emergencies described above and their location. Four respondents thought that these guidelines were accessible in an emergency setting, one-half of which were on computer systems requiring a login and search function. With regards to emergency management, 19 respondents felt competent in a tracheostomy emergency; almost exclusively through experience and in-house teaching. No respondents were aware of any formal emergency tracheostomy management courses. Conclusion Despite national guidance within the UK this survey highlights that implementation and awareness of emergency tracheostomy guidelines in ICUs in the EoE region is poor, and when present they are not readily accessible in an emergency. Emergency training has largely been informal and the availability of formal training courses has not been recognised. In order to improve patient safety there is a need to ensure that emergency tracheostomy management including guidelines, equipment and formalised tracheostomy emergency training are adopted and embraced universally. References Introduction A fatal incident related to a blocked tracheostomy tube prompted a review in our Trust. To provide safe tracheostomy care, changes in staffi ng, education and operational policies were recommended. Training of potential fi rst responders to tracheostomy or laryngectomy emergencies remains outstanding. We aim to quantify the training defi cit. Tracheostomies are common in critical care but these patients require ongoing management of an artifi cial airway on discharge to the ward and even the community. In 2010 our critical care unit cared for 108 tracheostomy patients, of which 30 were transferred to the wards. The 4th National Audit Project highlighted complications including hypoxic brain injury and death [1] and the National Patient Safety Agency recognised a number of avoidable aspects [2] . Existing guidelines for management of these patients including emergencies are not widely known. Methods An anonymous online survey was sent to all trainees who may respond to a tracheostomy emergency in our organisation. Trainees in anaesthesia/critical care, general medicine, general surgery, ENT, thoracics and A&E were approached. All completed forms were included.",

Over one-half (36/65) had managed tracheostomy/laryngectomy emergencies, with 42% (15/36) of these incidents occurring on the wards and one in an outpatient clinic. Only 20% (13/65) had received any formal training on management of a blocked/misplaced tracheostomy tube and only 18% (12/65) were aware of any guidelines. One-third of responders lacked confi dence in management of these emergencies and 88% felt they would benefi t from formal training including simulation. Conclusion The population of patients with exteriorised tracheas is increasing and represents a high-risk group. Management of airway emergencies in these patients is not part of standard life-support courses. According to our trainees, these scenarios are relatively common and a signifi cant proportion of fi rst responders are poorly equipped to deal with them. Our Trust will be including specifi c training on the emergency management of neck breathers as part of in-house resuscitation training. We would contend that national resuscitation courses should consider doing the same. Introduction Usually percutaneous tracheostomy is accomplished via the tracheal tube. Some severe complications during percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) may be related to poor visualization of tracheal structures. The alternative implies extubation and reinsertion of a laryngeal mask (LMA). An accidental extubation as well as an injuring of the vocal cords (because of the infl ated cuff during dislocation) appears impossible in this method. Subjectively, the bronchoscopic view obtained via a LMA seems to be better than that obtained with an endotracheal tube (ET) [1, 2] . Methods In this prospective observational study, the bedside PDT was performed using the Ciaglia Blue Dolphin method in 150 critically ill patients. The patient's tracheal tube was exchanged for a LMA Fastrach\u2122 before undertaking PDT. The insertion of the LMA, the quality of ventilation, the blood gas values, the view of the tracheal puncture site, and the view of the balloon dilatation were rated as follows: very good (1), good (2), barely acceptable (3), poor (4), and very poor (5) .",

The ratings were 1 or 2 in 96% of cases with regards to ventilation and to blood gas analysis, in 96.6% for identifi cation of relevant structures and tracheal puncture site, and in 93.3% for the view inside the trachea during PDT. A rating of 5 was assigned to one patient requiring tracheal reintubation for inadequate ventilation. There were no damages to the bronchoscope or reports of gastric aspiration. Conclusion The Blue Dolphin PDT using a LMA showed defi nite advantages regarding inspection of dilation process. This method improves visualization of the trachea and larynx during a video-assisted procedure and prevents the diffi culties associated with the use of an ET such as cuff puncture, tube transection by the needle, accidental extubation, and bronchoscope lesions. The LMA results as an eff ective and successful ventilatory device during PDT. This may be especially relevant in cases of diffi cult patient anatomy where improved structural visualization optimizes operating conditions. The intensivist performing PDT should be scrupulous when deciding which method to use. In our ICU the Blue Dolphin PDT with LMA has become the procedure of choice. Introduction Acute cor pulmonale (ACP) is associated with increased mortality in patients ventilated for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interventional lung assist (iLA) allows a lung-protective ventilatory strategy, whilst allowing CO 2 removal, but requires adequate right ventricular (RV) function.

Coagulopathy was detected in 127 cases at the time of CVC placement (43.6%). On the day of CVC insertion, coagulation abnormalities were corrected in 20 cases (15.7%); 33 out of 50 patients with severe coagulopathy (66.0%) and 74 out of 77 patients with coagulopathy of moderate severity (96.1%) had no correction at all. Correction was started only after CVC insertion for reasons unrelated to CVC placement in a further eight and two patients with severe and less severe coagulopathy (16.0% and 2.6%), respectively. No bleeding complications were observed. Conclusion In patients undergoing CVC insertion in our ICU, coagulopathy is common. We observed uncomplicated CVC placement in all 41 patients with severe uncorrected coagulopathy and in a further 76 patients with coagulopathy of moderate severity. When combined with other studies, our data suggest that ultrasound-guided CVC placement without routine correction of coagulation abnormalities may be safe in the ICU.",

In our experience, the rate of signifi cant local bleeding after placement of PICCs without reverse tapering may be as high as 40% at 1 hour and 15% at 24 hours, while the rate of bleeding after placement of a large-bore dialysis catheter is above 50% at 1 hour. Methods The aim of this pilot study was to verify the effi cacy of a cyanoacrylate glue in reducing the risk of early bleeding at the exit site after CVC or PICC placement. We studied a group of adult patients consecutively undergoing placement of polyurethane CVCs or PICCs without reverse tapering in a non-intensive ward of our hospital. All lines were inserted according to the same protocol, which included 2% chlorhexidine antisepsis, maximal sterile barriers, ultrasound guidance, EKG guidance and securement with sutureless device. Two minutes after placement of the glue, the exit site was covered with a temporary gauze dressing, which was replaced by transparent membrane at 24 hours. All patients were assessed at 1 hour and at 24 hours. Results In 65 consecutive patients (45 PICCs, 11 dialysis catheters and nine CVCs), there was no signifi cant local bleeding at 1 hour or at 24 hours after catheter placement.

Conclusion Glue is an inexpensive and highly eff ective tool for avoiding the risk of early bleeding of the exit site after catheter placement. We also suggest that in the next future the glue might prove to have benefi cial collateral eff ects on the risk of extraluminal contamination (by reducing the entrance of bacteria in the space between the catheter and the skin), as well as on the risk of dislocation (by increasing the stability of the catheter inside the skin breach). Introduction About 10 years ago the use of chest radiographs as the golden standard to ensure correct positioning of central venous catheters (CVC) was questioned. The frequent use of CVCs was also challenged. We decided to retrospectively evaluate our routines in a large surgical unit in a Swedish university hospital.",

X-rays were rarely performed on other indications in our unit. X-ray costs were at that time approximately \u20ac300,000 (~\u20ac130/each). The year after, 1,726 chest X-rays were performed, refl ecting both the use of intracardiac confi rmation of correct CVC position and also a reduced use of CVCs. This trend has continued over time. In 2011 approximately 600 CVCs were inserted at our unit. X-rays were performed in about 20% of these cases. The cost for a chest X-ray is today ~\u20ac200, meaning that X-ray costs were approximately \u20ac24,000. We have not experienced any medical problems when intracardiac ECG was used for positioning confi rmation. On the contrary, aspiration of venous blood without apparent p-waves in a patient with sinus rhythm may suggest improper placement of the CVC; for example, the right brachial vein. Conclusion If we had continued to use CVCs at the same frequency as we did 10 years ago, and used X-ray confi rmation in practically all cases, we would have paid approximately \u20ac460,000 annually. Reduced use of CVCs, in combination with intracardiac confi rmation of CVC positioning, has not only allowed us to reduce costs associated with CVC insertion by more than \u20ac400,000, corresponding to a reduction rate of more than 90%, but also decreased the patient's exposure to X-ray irradiation.",

Methods To prospectively re-evaluate the normal range and to analyze the potential impact of biometric data on ICG-PDR, we measured ICG-PDR (i.v. injection of 0.25 mg/kg ICG; LiMON, Pulsion, Munich, Introduction Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO 2 ) represents a well-recognized parameter of oxygen delivery (DO 2 )-consumption (VO 2 ) mismatch and its use has been advocated in critically ill patients in order to guide hemodynamic resuscitation [1] and oxygen delivery optimization. Nevertheless, the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is not readily available and its use is not devoid of risks. Furthermore, its use has been decreasing in recent years in surgical and cardiac surgical patients as the benefi t of guiding therapy with this device is unclear [2] [3] [4] . Central venous oxygen saturation (ScVO 2 ) has been suggested as an alternative to SVO 2 monitoring due to its feasibility in several settings. Unfortunately concerns arise from its capability to correlate with SVO 2 , the relationship being infl uenced by several factors, such as hemodynamic impairment and pathological process. Hemodynamic instability and shock often complicate cardiac surgery, and the SVO 2 -ScVO 2 relationship has not been specifi cally investigated in this setting. The aim of this study is to compare SVO 2 and ScVO 2 values in patients with cardiogenic shock after cardiac surgery. Methods A prospective observational study was designed and conducted. Inclusion criteria were: patients who had underwent elective or urgent/emergent cardiac surgery, with cardiac index (CI) <2.5 l/minute/m 2 estimated by means of a PAC, left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%, lactate >2 mmol/l, age >18 years. A central venous catheter (CVC) and a PAC were inserted for each patient before surgery in the same right internal jugular vein in accordance with standard procedure. Proper position of the PAC was confi rmed with pressure tracings and chest X-ray. Mixed and central venous blood samples were collected from the distal ports of the PAC and CVC respectively 30 minutes after ICU admission, and every 6 hours for a total of three samples in a 24-hour period for each patient. All blood samples were analyzed by a co-oximeter (Radiometer ABL800 fl ex; Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Statistical analysis was performed by Stats Direct (Ver.2.5.8, Cheshire, UK) and GraphPad (Vers. Prism 4.0; San Diego, CA, USA). All data were tested for normal distribution with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Statistical analysis was performed by linear regression analysis. The agreement between absolute values of ScvO 2 and SvO 2 were assessed by the mean bias and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) ((mean bias \u00b1 1.96)\u00d7standard deviation) according to the method described by Bland and Altman [5] . Results A total of 20 patients were enrolled. In 18 out of 20 cases all three blood samples were collected. In two patients only two blood samples were drawn as they exited the inclusion criteria. Linear regression analysis between the two variables resulted in an r 2 of 0.708. Bland-Altman analysis ( Figure 1 ) for the pooled measurements of SvO 2 and ScvO 2 showed a mean bias and LOA of 6.82% (SD of bias 5.3) and -3.71 to +17.3% respectively. Conclusion ScVO 2 has been advocated as an attractive and simple indicator of DO 2 -VO 2 mismatch [6] . Its role as a surrogate of the wellestablished SVO 2 has been investigated in several settings, and it has been purposed in the hemodynamic resuscitation of critically ill septic patients [1] . Nevertheless, the SVO 2 -ScVO 2 relationship can be infl uenced by several factors due to ScVO 2 dependency from global blood fl ow redistribution that can occur during hemodynamic impairments. It has been shown previously that in healthy people ScVO 2 values tend to underestimate SVO 2 values, due to the higher oxygen content from inferior vena cava [7] . During circulatory shock, not homogeneous oxygen extraction and regional blood fl ow Methods We assessed the benefi t these TEE data provided in the assessment of fi ve domains: hypovolemia, right ventricular dysfunction, left ventricular dysfunction, sepsis, and valvular abnormality. Bedside practitioners listed their diagnoses before and after seeing primary TEE images perform by trained physicians. We used a 0 to 5 Likert scale to assess diff erential diagnosis before and after the TEE, comparing changes using a paired t test. Results All requests for TEE were to access hemodynamic instability. A total of 18 patients were screened and nine were eligible, in which 16 total TEE studies were performed. There were no complications with TEE and all patients tolerated the long-term placement of the probe well. Of the fi ve diagnostic domains studied, right ventricular failure was the most commonly underdiagnosed contributor to the hemodynamic instability among patients prior to TEE (P = 0.054) (Figures 1 and 2 ).

Furthermore, contributions of this novel method to the management of critically ill ICU patients as well as its accuracy were assessed. Results In total, 33 CEUS studies were performed in critically ill ICU patients. The most frequent indications included: assessment of the liver perfusion, assessment of the pancreas and kidney perfusion after pancreas and kidney transplantation, assessment of the renal perfusion in acute kidney injury (AKI), assessment of active bleeding and assessment of the bowel perfusion. In all studies, the correct diagnosis was achieved and the transport of critically ill patients to the radiology department for further diagnostic procedures as well as application of iodinated contrast agents was avoided. In 16 cases signifi cant new fi ndings were detected. Twelve of them were missed by conventional standard Doppler ultrasound prior to CEUS. In assessment of seven cases with AKI, impaired or delayed perfusion and microcirculation of the kidney was observed in six patients. In three patients urgent surgical intervention was performed because of CEUS results. In three cases active bleeding was excluded at the bedside due to absence of contrast agent extravasation into hematoma (thigh and perihepatic) or into abdominal cavity, without need for complementary CT imaging or angiography. In one case the regular perfusion of intestinal anastomosis was confi rmed with no need for surgical exploration. None of patients undergoing CEUS manifested any adverse reactions or developed any complications associated with the imaging technique. Conclusion Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography clearly improves visualization of the perfusion in various tissues. It is very likely to be superior to standard Doppler ultrasound, and is safe and well tolerated in critically ill patients. Promising indications for the use of CEUS in the ICU may be the assessment of kidney microcirculation and assessment of liver perfusion in liver transplant and liver trauma patients. Introduction Even though invasive hemodynamic devices are usually used for assessment of septic shock victims, they cannot evaluate the heart function. LV dysfunction as well as right heart syndrome are not uncommon in sepsis and critical patients. Intensive care ultrasound discloses these data and leads to appropriate treatment. Methods The study was a prospective cross-sectional study. The measurement was performed within 24 hours of ICU admission. We excluded patients with history of COPD and pulmonary hypertension from any diseases. Only good-quality images acquired from subjects were included for analysis. The primary objective was to disclose how the hemodynamic changed in septic patients by ICU-US. Introduction Thermodilution (TD) is considered a gold standard for measurement of cardiac index (CI) in critically ill patients. The aim of this study is to compare intermittent bolus TD CI with intermittent automatic calibration CI (AutoCI) and two continuous CIs obtained by pulse contour analysis with PiCCO 2 (PiCCI) and Pulsiofl ex (PuCCI). Methods Interim results of an ongoing prospective multicentre study in 53 patients. Age 58.7 \u00b1 15.4, SAPS II score 51.4 \u00b1 14.7 and SOFA score 10 \u00b1 3.2.

But the approach needs an initial investment and increases the staff workload. Economic factors might participate in the weak adherence to the pGDT concept. Some model studies support pGDT cost-eff ectiveness, but real economic data based on a recent clinical trial are lacking. We performed an economic analysis of hemodynamic optimization using the stroke volume variation trial [2] in order to elucidate this issue. Methods The hospital care invoices of all 120 patients included in the trial were retrospectively extracted. Due to the nature of the data we have adopted the healthcare payer's perspective. We performed a comparison of induced costs between the Vigileo (n = 60) and Control (n = 60) groups and constructed a cost tree using the study group and complications occurrence as distributive parameters. The incremental cost-eff ectiveness ratio per complication avoided was calculated and, fi nally, diff erent reimbursing categories were assessed as potential cost drivers.",

Recently, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been proposed as an alternative minimally invasive approach for BV assessment [1] . This method measures BV using a single peripheral injection of a small bolus of ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) detected by an ultrasound scanner. By measuring the acoustic backscatter, two indicator dilution curves (IDCs) can be derived from two diff erent sites in the circulatory system. IDC analysis permits deriving the mean transit time (MTT) the bolus takes to travel between the injection site and two measurement sites. Assessment of the BV between these sites is obtained by multiplying the diff erence in MTT (\u0394MTT) by the blood fl ow. In this study, we compare diff erent volumes in an in vitro set-up by CEUS with true set-up volumes and thermodilution acquired volumes. Methods The in vitro set-up consisted of a centrifugal pump, a network of tubes with variable volumes, an electromagnetic fl owmeter to measure and adjust the generated fl ow, heating devices to maintain constant temperature (37\u00b0C), two thermistors for thermodilution measurement, an ultrasound transducer and a pressure stabilizer. A small bolus of UCA diluted in cold saline (1 mg SonoVue\u00ae in 20 ml saline at 4\u00b0C) was injected into the system. The cold UCA passage through a fi rst and a second region of interest (ROI) was measured simultaneously with the ultrasound transducer and the thermistors. The measurements were performed at diff erent fl ows and volumes. BVs were estimated using the two diff erent approaches, namely CEUS and thermodilution. The IDCs were processed and fi tted separately with a dedicated model to estimate the \u0394MTT of the cold UCA bolus between the two ROIs and the two thermistors. All the measurements were repeated three times. Results A linear relation between BVs estimated by the two techniques was observed with a correlation coeffi cient of 0.94. The bias of CEUS with respect to the true volumes was -40.1 ml; the bias of thermodilution was 84.3 ml. The most prominent diff erences between the two techniques were observed in case of high volume and low fl ow, possibly due to diff erent transport kinetics between UCAs and heat.",

Microcirculatory perfusion tended to improve as surgery progressed in the goal-directed fl uid therapy group. Our fi ndings suggest that goal-directed and MAPguided fl uid management are associated with distinct patterns in fl uid resuscitation, which may be of consequence for microvascular perfusion. Introduction Previous studies demonstrate that loss of glycocalyx integrity is associated with impaired microvascular function. We investigated whether glycocalyx dimensions are reduced in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and are paralleled by loss of microcirculatory perfusion using in vivo microcirculation measurements. Methods Patients undergoing on-pump surgery with nonpulsatile (n = 11) or pulsatile (n = 13) CPB or off -pump surgery (n = 13) underwent sublingual sidestream dark-fi eld imaging at baseline, during coronary grafting and upon ICU admission to assess perfused microvascular vessel density. Glycocalyx integrity was evaluated using the GlycoCheck Measurement Software, and expressed as the perfused boundary region (PBR). An increase in PBR represents deeper penetration of erythrocytes into the glycocalyx, and is indicative for compromised glycocalyx thickness. Introduction Cold exposure can be adapted for exercise or therapeutic purposes, but its impact on microcirculation in healthy humans has not been well defi ned. We hypothesize that whole body cold stress may impair microcirculation. Methods Seven volunteers were recruited for the water immersion procedure. During the cooling protocol the volunteers every 20 minutes of immersion were asked to step out from the bath and rest for 10 minutes in a room environment and then return to the water bath for the next 20 minutes of immersion. This head-out immersion procedure in bath water at 14\u00b0C continued until the rectal temperature was dropped to 35.5\u00b0C or the time of 180 minutes was terminated. Maximum cold water immersion time was 120 minutes.

Clinical and experimental data show that the sublingual region is clinically relevant for detecting microcirculatory alterations and more represents central microcirculation than cutaneous perfusion.

Resuscitative adjuncts to limit mitochondrial injury may be eff ective to reduce tissue injury and protect against the sequelae of hemorrhagic shock (HS). Others and we have demonstrated the protective eff ects of inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) or nebulized sodium nitrite (NaNO 2 ) in models of HS. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that CO and NaNO 2 protect against hemorrhagic shock-induced tissue injury/infl ammation by limiting mitochondrial damage and preventing bioenergetic failure. Methods Twenty anesthetized female Yorkshire pigs were subjected to severe hemorrhage until unable to compensate or 90 minutes, and were then resuscitated with volume/pressors. Muscle and platelet samples were obtained at baseline (BL) and 2 hours after resuscitation (EndObs). Animals were randomized to: standard of care (HSR, n = 5); HSR+CO (CO; 250 ppm\u00d730 minutes, n = 6); or HSR+NaNO 2 (NaNO 2 ; 11 mg in PBS\u00d730 minutes, n = 6), and sham (n = 3). CO or NaNO 2 were initiated ~30 minutes before resuscitation. Primary endpoints were changes in muscle and platelet mitochondrial respiration between BL and EndObs, quantifi ed by muscle respiratory control ratio (RCR, traditional respirometry), and by the change in proton-leak respiration (PLR) and mitochondrial reserve capacity in platelets. Secondary endpoint was mortality at EndObs. Results Skeletal muscle RCR decreased in the HSR group (P = 0.04) but not in sham. Decrease in RCR was primarily due to decreased ADPdependent respiration, without change in state 4 respiration. HSR also resulted in platelet mitochondrial dysfunction as demonstrated by increased PLR and decreased reserve capacity. This correlated with increased platelet activation (%CD62P+ by fl ow cytometry) in HSR. CO or NaNO 2 treatment prevented these deleterious changes in both muscle and platelet mitochondrial respiration, as well as limited HSR-induced platelet activation. CO treatment also improved reserve capacity compared with baseline. Mortality was higher in HSR than in CO or NaNO 2 (80 vs. 33 and 33%, respectively). Conclusion In severe HS, mitochondrial injury in platelets and muscle was limited by CO or NaNO 2 . Although not powered for a secondary endpoint, mortality was double in HSR versus adjunctive therapies. This suggests that CO and NaNO 2 may protect mitochondrial function by maintaining ATP-coupled respiration and reserve capacity, and that this may confer a survival advantage. However, further investigations are required. Introduction Norepinephrine has been widely used in septic shock. However, its eff ect remains controversial. We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the eff ect between norepinephrine and other vasopressors. Methods The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from database inception until October 2012 were searched. We selected randomized controlled trials in adults with septic shock and compared norepinephrine with other vasopressors. The quality of each study included was assessed with Jadad score. After assessing for heterogeneity of treatment eff ect across trials using the I 2 statistic, we used a fi xed eff ect model (P \u22650.1) or random-eff ects model (P <0.1) and expressed results as the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or the standardized mean diff erence (SMD) for continuous data with 95% CI. Results Eighteen trials (n = 2,715) met inclusion criteria, which compared norepinephrine with fi ve diff erent vasopressors (dopamine, vasopressin, epinephrine, terlipressin and phenylephrine). The mean Jadad score was 3.11. Overall, there was no diff erence in mortality in the comparisons between norepinephrine and vasopressin, epinephrine, terlipressin and phenylephrine (P >0.05, respectively). However, norepinephrine had a trend in decreasing mortality compared with dopamine (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.02; P = 0.08). There were a decreased heart rate (HR) (SMD, -2.10; 95% CI, -3.95 to -0.25; P = 0.03), cardiac index (SMD, -0.73; 95% CI, -1.14 to -0.03; P = 0.004) and an increased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) (SMD, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.45; P <0.0001) with the treatment of norepinephrine compared with dopamine. Conclusion There is not suffi cient evidence to prove that norepinephrine is superior to vasopressin, epinephrine, terlipressin and phenylephrine in terms of mortality. However, norepinephrine is associated with a decreased HR, cardiac index and an increased SVRI, and appears to have a greater eff ect on decreasing mortality compared with dopamine.",

            "text": "Introduction Vasoplegic syndrome is a common complication after cardiac surgery, with negative impact on patient outcomes and hospital costs. Pathogenesis of vasodilatory phenomenon after cardiac surgery remains a matter of controversy. Loss of vascular tone can be partly explained by the depletion of neurohypophyseal arginine vasopressin stores. Vasopressin is commonly used as an adjunct to catecholamines to support blood pressure in refractory septic shock, but its eff ect on vasoplegic shock is unknown. We hypothesized that the use of vasopressin would be more eff ective on treatment of shock after cardiac surgery than norepinephrine, decreasing the composite endpoint of mortality and severe morbidity. Methods In this prospective and randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned patients who had vasoplegic shock to receive either vasopressin (0.01 to 0.06 U/minute) or norepinephrine (0.01 to 1 \u03bcg/ kg/minute) in addition to open-label vasopressors. All vasopressor infusions were titrated and tapered according to protocols to maintain a target blood pressure. The primary endpoint was major morbidity according to STS (30-day mortality, mechanical ventilation >48 hours, mediastinitis, surgical re-exploration, stroke, acute renal failure). Secondary outcomes were time on mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stay, new infection, the time to attainment of hemodynamic stability, occurrence of adverse events and safety. Results A total of 300 patients underwent randomization, were infused with the study drug (148 patients received vasopressin, and 152 norepinephrine), and were included in the analysis. Patients who received vasopressin had a lower rate of morbidity (23.5% vs. 34%, P = 0.001) as compared with the norepinephrine group. The 30-day mortality rate was 6.1% in the norepinephrine group and 4.6% in the vasopressin group (P = 0.570). There were no signifi cant diff erences in the overall rates of serious adverse events (7.4% and 6.6%, respectively; P = 0.772). Results Patients in the two groups were statistically comparable with respect to sex (P = 0.31) and age (P = 0.53). The causes of the syndrome of Tako-tsubo were: subarachnoid hemorrhage (six patients) after coronary artery bypass graft (four patients), and polytrauma (two patients). All patients had low cardiac output. In the levosimendan group the ejection fraction at entrance was 25 \u00b1 6%, after 12 hours 36 \u00b1 10%, and 47 \u00b1 5% after 24 hours. In the control group the ejection fraction at entrance was 24 \u00b1 7%, after 12 hours 28 \u00b1 6% and after 24 hours 33 \u00b1 4%. Comparing the two groups we reached statistical signifi cance, P = 0.026. Conclusion Comparing the two groups, we noticed that both started from a low cardiac output. However, in the group who used the drug therapy based on levosimendan we saw a return of systolic function of the left ventricle to near-normal levels within 24 hours, while in the control group there remains a dysfunction in systolic function. We have shown the drug therapy based on levosimendan contributes to improving the systolic function of the left ventricle compared with treatment with dobutamine despite the initial cardiac stunning. Reference Introduction In the critically ill, the incidence of raised cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels is high. Although the mechanisms of myocardial injury are not well understood, raised cTnT levels are associated with increased mortality. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence, prevalence and outcome of silent myocardial injury as determined by raised cTnT levels and concomitant ECG changes in critically ill patients admitted for noncardiac reasons. Methods ECGs were taken and cTnT was measured daily during the fi rst week and on alternate days during the second week until discharge from the ICU or death. After completion of the study, all cTnT levels and ECGs were analysed independently and patients were classifi ed into four groups: defi nite MI (cTnT \u226515 ng/l and defi nite ECG changes of MI), possible MI (cTnT \u226515 ng/l and ischaemic changes on ECG), troponin rise alone (cTnT \u226515 ng/l with no ischaemic ECG changes), or normal. All medical notes were reviewed independently by two ICU clinicians. Results A total of 144 patients were included in the analysis (42% female; mean age 61.9 (SD 16.9); mean APACHE II score 19.4). In total, 121 patients (84%) had at least one cTnT level \u226515 ng/l during their stay in the ICU. Twenty patients (14%) fulfi lled criteria for a defi nite MI, of whom 65% were septic and 50% were on noradrenaline at the time (ICU and hospital mortality: 25% and 30%, respectively). Thirty-nine patients (27%) had a possible MI, of whom 69% were septic and on noradrenaline (ICU and hospital mortality: 31% and 41%, respectively). Sixty-two patients (43%) had a raised troponin without ECG, of whom 69% were septic and 50.7% were on noradrenaline (ICU and hospital mortality: 23% and 31%, respectively). Twenty-three patients had normal cTnT results and serial ECGs, of whom 61% had sepsis. ICU and hospital mortality was 4%. Only 25% of defi nite MIs and 18% of possible MIs were recognised by the clinical teams at the time.",

A more positive fl uid balance was associated with a more prolonged length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital. UGIB patient needs an intervention or not. However, the intervention which the GBS mentions includes not only endoscopy but also blood transfusion. Therefore, we cannot determine whether a UGIB patient needs urgent endoscopy or just blood transfusion by GBS alone. We hypothesized that high lactate clearance (CLac) would decrease the likelihood of sustained UGIB. Methods This is a retrospective study. UGIB patients, who visited the emergency department (ED) of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine from April 2011 to March 2012 and received urgent endoscopy in the ED, were enrolled. We collected for each patient the GBS, the blood lactate value on arrival in the ED, the blood lactate value after bolus administration of 20 to 40 ml/kg Ringer's acetate (initial fl uid therapy) and the report of urgent endoscopy. We classifi ed the severity of UGIB according to GBS. A score \u226412 was classifi ed as moderate, and a score \u226513 was classifi ed as severe. CLac was defi ned as the percentage decrease in blood lactate from the time of arrival in the ED to the time when an initial fl uid therapy was fi nished.

Laxatives were prescribed when patients had not opened their bowels for 3 days in 25% HDU and 75% ICU cases. Taking into consideration that the median age, APACHE II score and length of stay for constipated and nonconstipated patients were similar, the relationship to feeding and respiratory support were assessed. Introduction It was noted on our unit that dislodgement of nasogastric tubes occurred commonly. This can lead to an increased risk of aspiration, interruptions in nutritional support, skin breakdown and radiographic exposure [1] . It is recommended that the position of nasogastric tubes should be confi rmed by aspiration and pH testing, with radiographic confi rmation used only when this is not possible [2] . Methods We performed a retrospective review of chest X-ray (CXR) requests for the 3-month period June to August 2012 using the trust radiology information system. The proportion of CXR requests for confi rmation of position and patient demographics were measured with an estimation of the fi nancial cost performed. Results There were 541 patients admitted to the critical care area in the study period. In total, 207 out of 2,340 (8.8%) CXRs performed were for confi rmation of position. Repeated X-rays were required in some patients (see Table 1 ); these patients were older and tended to have a longer length of stay. A mobile CXR costs \u00a325 in our trust, if one CXR is accepted per patient with a nasogastric tube; there was an excess of 160 images with a cost of \u00a34,000 in the 3-month period. Conclusion An excess of CXRs were performed for confi rmation of nasogastric tube in our patient population. The recommended methods for position confi rmation were reinforced amongst medical staff . The high number of repeated imaging for some patients indicates that dislodgement of tubes was also a problem. We propose that nasogastric tubes should be bridled after fi rst dislodgement or at tracheostomy insertion to minimise dislodgement in the future.",

Patients remained on parenteral nutrition (PN) as clinically indicated; controls received PN starting 2.5 hours before starting enteral feeding. Intrinsically 13 C-Phe-labeled casein was infused for 6 hours by nasogastric tube at 0.75 g protein/ hour, together with maltodextrin at 2.73 g/hour.

Whilst reassuring in the steps taken to avoid never events, this study demonstrates that there may be delays in time-critical administration of enteral medicine or optimal nutritional practices. This study reveals a signifi cant problem with aspirating gastric contents for pH testing, necessitating a large number of X-ray position confi rmations. Even if the frequency and volume of gastric aspiration were greater, there is a belief that pH testing may not be suffi ciently accurate (since many factors alter patients' gastric pH). It is possible that new technologies such as electromagnetic NGT placement may allow faster/equally safe practices. Further study including cost/benefi t analysis will be needed to confi rm this. Reference . Eighteen readings were from newly placed NG tubes and 150 readings from old NG tubes. Fiftythree per cent of routine pH readings were falsely high; that is, pH 6 or above despite the NG tube being in the stomach (Figure 1 ). Twentyeight per cent of newly placed NG tubes had falsely high pH readings ( Figure 2 ). Conclusion In this population of ICU patients, routine/daily checks of NG pH aspirate appear to be limited. This is almost certainly due to the use of continuous NG feed together with PPIs. The usefulness of pH testing in newly placed NG tubes, however, appears more reliable. Introduction Sepsis is the most common cause of death in ICUs [1] . Destruction of intestinal barrier function and increased translocation of bacteria to systemic blood fl ow can lead to sepsis [2] .

The aim of this trial was to determine the eff ect of probiotic on infl ammatory biomarkers and mortality rate of sepsis in critically ill patients in the ICU. Methods This double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted on 40 critically ill patients admitted to the ICU. They were randomly assigned to receive placebo or probiotic for 7 days. The APACHE score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and systemic concentrations of IL-6, procalcitonin (PCT) and protein C were measured before initiation of the study and on days 4 and 7.

Selenium is an essential trace element involved in antioxidant and immunological reactions. Selenium levels have been shown to be low in patients with systemic infl ammatory response syndrome and sepsis. Selenium replacement has been recommended in patients with sepsis [1, 2] . Greater than 5 days of supplementation may also help to prevent the development of new infections on ICUs [3] . Methods This is a prospective survey where selenium levels were collected from patients admitted with septic shock to a tertiary ICU, for 6 months from October 2010 to March 2011. Results Selenium levels were measured in 31 patients with septic shock. Abdominal and chest sepsis were the main sources of infection. Those with an abdominal source of sepsis had the lowest levels, as shown in Table 1 . All septic shock patients who had selenium levels taken within the fi rst 10 days of admission had subnormal levels (<0.8 mg/dt), and after 10 days had levels within the normal range, as shown in Figure 1 . Introduction Glutamine regulates many biological functions in preserving the cell, acts as a key respiratory fuel and nitrogen donor for rapidly dividing cells, and modulates the expression of many genes associated with metabolism, cell defences and repair, and cytokine production. In severe thoracic trauma, glutamine supplementation is essential because the body consumes more than it produces and glutamine eff ects become dependent on its route of delivery.",

Introduction The optimal feeding of critically ill patients treated in the ICU is controversial. Present guidelines for protein feeding are based on weak evidence obtained with suboptimal methods. Whole body protein kinetics is an attractive technique to assess optimal protein intake by measuring the eff ect of protein feeding strategies on protein synthesis rates, protein degradation rates and protein balance. Here protein kinetics were measured in critically ill neurosurgical patients during hypocaloric and normocaloric parenteral nutrition. Methods Neurosurgical patients on mechanical ventilation (n = 16) were studied. Energy expenditure was measured with indirect calorimetry. After that, the patients were randomized to receiving 24 hours of 50% of measured energy expenditure followed by 24 hours of 100% or 100% before 50%. Whole body protein kinetics were measured during the last half hour of the feeding periods using stable isotope-labeled phenylalanine as a tracer. During a continuous infusion of labeled phenylalanine and tyrosine, plasma samples were obtained and later analyzed for the content of the labeled amino acids using mass spectrometry. Protein kinetics were calculated using standard steady-state kinetics. In addition, amino acid concentrations were analyzed by HPLC. Student's t test was used for statistical analyses.",

Documentation was analysed with regard to discharge diagnosis. Ultrasound investigation was performed on seven of the patients but only once admitted to various specialities. No ultrasound was undertaken upon admission. Conclusion Improvement in documentation of minimum standards for these patients is needed. A multidisciplinary care pathway could improve outcome. Consideration should be given to whether early ultrasound investigation is appropriate and there is a further need for investigation as to whether this would improve longer term outcomes. Introduction BiPAP utilization for the treatment of severe refractory status asthmaticus patients has become an accepted therapy but is not well described for moderate exacerbations. We sought to analyze outcomes from our BiPAP quality database for children presenting in status asthmaticus at varying levels of severity. Methods PED status asthmaticus patients requiring BiPAP from 1 January 2010 to 31 August 2012 had a bedside interview and documentation of information at the time therapies were given. Incomplete data were collected retrospectively. All data were stored and analyzed using a RedCap database. Subjects were stratifi ed into severity groups based on asthma score at the time of BiPAP placement. Results There were 206 subjects in the moderate severity group and 197 in the severe group. Table 1 shows the groups were well matched and compares other pertinent data. Children with severe presentations were placed on BiPAP sooner (P <0.001) and remained on BiPAP longer (P <0.001).

In severe patients, thallium poisoning produces neuromuscular symptoms such as extreme pain and muscle weakness. Methods Five case reports. Results All patients worked at a pharmaceutical factory. They joined a tea party held at their workplace at the end of April 2011. The fi ve patients drank tea from a teapot someone had put thallium in. A few days later, they complained of femoral numbness and pain caused by pressure. About a week later, three of fi ve patients had profound hair loss. Three weeks after the party, they came to our ER. We thought that their symptoms might be caused by some chemicals. We searched the keywords: 'lower extremity pain' , 'hair loss' and 'poison' in the Internet. As a result, thallium, mercury, lead, and so forth, were suspicious metals. In those metals, thallium was most likely because it was used in their factory. We immediately examined the blood concentration of several metals and ordered iron(III)hexacyanoferrate(II) that is known as the antidote for thallium poisoning. Only thallium was positive in the blood metal concentration test. Three patients consented to oral administration of an antidote. Two patients rejected administration because their symptoms were mild and getting better. All symptoms of all patients gradually disappeared by August. We also followed up the course of blood concentration of thallium. The concentration in three patients who took the antidote was reduced more rapidly than the two patients who did not take it. Conclusion All patients recovered without any sequelae. Three patients' hair started to grow 3 months from ingestion of thallium, and after half a year their hair was restored to their former state. We had diffi culty ordering iron(III)hexacyanoferrate(II) because this is also known as an antidote for cesium. On 11 March 2011 a megathrust earthquake and tsunami hit Japan and the giant tsunami gave rise to an accident at a nuclear power generation plant. Because the rumor of radioactive substances including cesium might be spread was the talk in the city near the nuclear power plant, the authorities put the antidote under heavy supervision. We could also collect the data for the course of thallium concentration. Thallium concentration of the patients who had an antidote was reduced more rapidly but these patients had a loose stool, thought to be a side eff ect of this antidote.

Results HMMD receives an average of 30 cases of stroke monthly, and thrombolysis did not occur before the implementation of the TM Project, because of the lack of neurologists available to conduce the cases. After implementation of the TM Program, six cases of ischemic stroke were thrombolyzed with alteplase; only one case (16%) progressed to death from septic shock, and one case (16%) presented symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Conclusion Thrombolysis in ischemic stroke reduces 30% the risk of disability and 18% the mortality rate. This procedure has been only feasible to be done in the community setting because of the implementation of the TM Project, which permits the presence of a real time consultation with a specialized neurological team from a tertiary center. analyses, and then returned home.

Although this worked partly during the aboveshown catastrophe in Japan 2011, several problems are left to be solved; that is, the insuffi cient operation system of the Japan DMAT or Disaster Medical Assistant Team that seemed to have caused a large number of preventable deaths. Conclusion The large number of casualties during a major disaster is a global problem, even in the developed countries. When the role of the intensivist is reviewed, many roles were verifi ed to be important; that is, as a leader of a medical team or triage offi cer as well as a professional in the fi eld of specifi c intensive care. However, there are many problems to be solved in the fi elds of disaster medicine. In order to solve the diversifi cation or the various medical problems, it is necessary to compile or systematize a disaster medicine of the world version. The concept of the compendium and our process of trial are shown in relation to intensive care. There are distinct diff erences in the pathophysiology between medical cardiac arrests and TCA. Traumatic pathologies associated with an improved chance of successful resuscitation include hypoxia, tension pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade [1] . The authors believe a separate algorithm is required for the management of out-of-hospital TCA attended to by a highly trained physician and paramedic team. Methods A suggested algorithm for TCA was developed based on the Greater Sydney Area Helicopter Emergency Medical Service's standard operating procedures and current available evidence. Results An algorithm for the general management of TCA can be seen in Figure 1 . In TCA, priority should be given to catastrophic haemorrhage control (tourniquets, direct pressure, haemostatic agents, pelvic and long bone splintage) and volume resuscitation. Simultaneous oxygena tion optimisation should occur with proactive exclusion of tension pneumothoraces with bilateral open thoracostomies. Cardiac ultrasound (US) should be used to help exclude cardiac tamponade and assist in prognostication. The US presence of true cardiac standstill versus low pressure state/pseudo-PEA, and an ETCO 2 <1.3 kPa carries a grave prognosis in TCA. Given the high incidence of hypovolaemia, hypoxia and obstructive shock prior to TCA, the role of adrenaline and chest compressions are limited. Figure 2 shows a suggested algorithm for the management of penetrating TCA requiring prehospital thoracotomy.",

A total of 63 POI were performed on 48 patients. Administration of advanced analgesia was the most common POI making up 68.3% of interventions. Patients with abnormal RTSc 2 scores were more likely to receive a POI when compared with those with normal RTSc 2 (P = 0.03). The performance of POI had no effect on median scene times (45 vs. 43 minutes; P = 0.51). See Tables 1  and 2 . Conclusion Our high POI rate of 40% coupled with long rescue times and the occasional severe injuries supports the argument for winching doctors. Not doing so would deny a signifi cant proportion of patients time-critical interventions, advanced analgesia and procedural sedation. ",

By chance, several items of date-expired stock were identifi ed in the transfer kit whilst moving a patient to a tertiary centre. This raised the possibility of a more extensive problem with the equipment bags. Due to the geographical location of our district general hospital we undertake around 70 transfers of critical care patients to other hospitals per year (16% by air) and it is clearly important that our equipment is well maintained for these journeys. Methods We maintain two identical sets of equipment (syringes, fl uid, airway management items, and so forth) and drug bags to take on transfers; one equipment and one drug bag taken on each trip. The contents of all four bags were checked and itemised. By careful consideration of the aims of the bags (to provide emergency equipment and drugs for managing one patient during an en-route emergency) a new inventory was devised. Excess items were removed to lighten the bags and improve accessibility to the essential items. Expired stock was removed. A daily checking procedure and tamper-proof seals on the bags were instigated and the bags were reassessed 12 months later. Results A total of 13.9% of drug items and 29.2% of equipment items had expired or would do so within 30 days of the initial assessment. The combined weight of one equipment and one drug bag was reduced from 14 to 9 kg (36% reduction) by introducing the new inventory. At reassessment in November 2012, only 10 items of equipment (3.2%) were expired or near to expiry and there were no expired drug items (4.1% near to expiry). In total, 0.3 kg (26 small items) of extraneous equipment had been added through over-restocking and was removed. Conclusion These bags are designed for a clinician to manage a patient when an emergency arises during transfer of a critical care patient. By the introduction of simple measures, the risks posed by expired items or cluttered equipment bags have almost been eradicated. Signifi cant weight savings have been made; this off ers improved ergonomics for staff and is also an important consideration for aeromedical operations. Our department was surprised to discover the extent of decline of our equipment and it may be that other departments would fi nd themselves in a similar position. The anaesthetic registrars who routinely escort the transfer patients have a vested interest to maintain this equipment and this has secured their buy-in to the new checking procedure with clear results. Conclusion Prehospital hyperoxemia did not infl uence the functional neurological outcome. One of the reasons for this fi nding could be the short arrival time to the trauma center where repeated analyses of arterial blood gases were performed. Therefore, correction of fraction of inspired oxygen according to the arterial blood gas analysis shortens the time of hyperoxemia, thus reducing neuronal brain damage.",

The purpose here was to report our experience using exception to informed consent during the inaugural pilot study of infusing estrogen for acute injury, the so-called RESCUE Shock study. Methods Fifty patients were enrolled in RESCUE Shock in which estrogen or placebo was infused as soon as possible in the emergency department for trauma patients with a low systolic blood pressure (<90 mmHg) at two level I trauma centers. They were all treated with a single-dose estrogen or placebo infusion within 2 hours using exception from informed consent following US federal guidelines. Results Investigator-initiated exception from informed consent studies is feasible, with our FDA IND approval obtained in 31 days, IRB 1 approval in 25 days, and IRB 2 approval in 24 days. Community consultation/notifi cation was successfully accomplished with no one opting out and 47/50 enrolled patients or their legal representatives were notifi ed of participation (one died unidentifi ed, two died with no known contact). The average number of days to verbal notifi cation of patients or advocates was 6.55 days (range 0 to 51 days) as the study team began notifi cation only after the patient or family was able to reasonably understand information about the study. No one decided against continued follow-up. Overall, patients and their families were very enthusiastic about participation and the data safety monitoring board had no safety concerns after reviewing all study data. Conclusion Although delayed notice of participation occurs for many justifi able reasons, the use of exception from informed consent for novel, time-sensitive resuscitation studies is not only crucial, but can be feasible, and well accepted by patients, their advocates and communities at large.",

However, data are lacking regarding the long-term levels of cytokines in the heart following severe burn injury and also how infusion of parenteral estrogen, a powerful anti-infl ammatory agent, would aff ect these levels.

Based on these data, clinical studies of estrogen infusions should be seriously entertained as estrogen may not only be an inexpensive, simple adjunctive therapy in burn management, it may also obviate the need for many subsequent interventions altogether and even diminish mortality.

We chose the presence or absence of MI (Injury Severity Score \u226515) in need of surgical intervention as the outcome variable. We used bivariate analyses to identify variables potentially predicting the presentation of MI. The predictor variables were confi rmed by multivariate logistic regression analyses. We assigned a score based on the corresponding coeffi cients. Results Among the 173 patients enrolled, 53 were in the MI group. Four predictors were found to be independently signifi cant by the logistic analysis: (1) body surface wound \u22653 regions, (2) positive focused assessment with sonography for trauma, (3) white blood cell count \u226511,000/\u03bcl, and (4) D-dimer \u22658 \u03bcg/ml. Score 1 was assigned to predictor (1), score 2 was assigned to predictors (2), (3) and (4). A prediction score was calculated for each patient by adding these scores. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.89. No patients with a score of 1 or less had MI (Figures 1 and 2) . Conclusion In patients with a score of 1 or 0, the presence of MI is less likely. These patients may not require WBCT, and selective CT scans of body parts based on clinical presentation should be considered. (Figure 1) . The most common intervention as a result of the ultrasound was initiation of a pressor infusion (33.3%), of which 71.4% were ionotropes. Additional therapies included blood transfusion (4.8%), heparin (9.5%), tPA (4.8%), cardiac catheterization (4.8%), and surgery (9.5%). ROSC was achieved in 37.5% of patients; average time to ROSC was 13 minutes. A total 33.3% of patients who underwent ALS were alive at hospital discharge and 28.6% at 1 year. Conclusion Focused cardiac ultrasound is a feasible adjunct to ALS resuscitation and may assist in the early identifi cation of reversible causes of cardiac arrest. Care must be taken to ensure no interruptions to cardiac compressions are made by performance during pulse checks.

Methods Our patient, with a medical history of a laparoscopic repair of a symptomatic diaphragmatic hernia 6 months prior, presented herself at the emergency department with pain in the upper abdomen and nausea. The physical examination, laboratory tests and X-ray of the thorax were normal and she was sent home. Twenty-four hours later paramedics were summoned to our patient because of increased complaints. On arrival of the paramedics she had a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) and during the transfer from her bed to the stretcher she collapsed due to pulseless electric activity (PEA), for which cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started. Sinus rhythm and output was regained after several minutes and the patient was transported to the hospital. At arrival in the hospital, the X-ray of the thorax showed an intrathoracic stomach and a signifi cant mediastinal shift to the right. Results After emergency laparotomy, which concerned correcting the gastric herniation and resection of an ischemic part of stomach, the patient remained hemodynamically stable. Cardiac ischemia was ruled out based on ECG, laboratory fi ndings, cardiac ultrasound and cardiac computed tomography. The ultrasound in the emergency department did show a distended right ventricle and normal left function, which disappeared later (after repositioning the stomach), which is evidence for the mediastinal shift as a cause for the PEA. Conclusion We are the fi rst to describe a patient requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation for progressive obstructive shock, due to an intrathoracic stomach. Especially after a laparoscopic repair of a diaphragmatic hernia, this is a rare cause for shock and cardiac arrest, which requires a diff erent medical approach. ",

Conclusion In OHCA patients with unshockable initial rhythm, prehospital epinephrine administration signifi cantly increased the rate of survival at 1 month after cardiac arrest. The best single predictor for favorable neurological outcomes at 1 month following prehospital epinephrine administration after cardiac arrest was age (<66 years) followed by total dose of epinephrine (1 mg) and then by call-response time (<5 minutes).

Results A total of 195 patients (mean age, 69 years), 67% of whom were male, were transported to our hospital after suff ering OHCA. Cardiopulmonary arrest was witnessed in 52 cases (27%). The 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC regarding the criteria for TOR were applied in 126 cases (65%), of whom 113 (90%) were dead on arrival, and 13 were successfully resuscitated and admitted. The outcomes for these 13 patients were as follows: 10 died in the hospital, two patients were discharged with a Glasgow Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score of 1, and one patient was transferred to another hospital with a CPC score of 3. Conclusion In our study, 65% of the patients who were transported to the hospital after OHCA met the criteria for TOR. Outcomes for patients who met the TOR criteria were signifi cantly worse than those who did not meet the criteria (2.4% vs. 14.5%, P <0.005). In Japan, eff orts are made to resuscitate almost all individuals who suff er OHCA, but 75% of those patients die within a day. In light of the fact that even the medical cost for each of these patients who die within a day amounts to US$1,500 [4] , the introduction of TOR will have a particularly strong impact in Japan.",

Additional tools, such as EEG and evoked potentials, improve prediction of outcome in this setting, but are not widely available and require signifi cant implementation. Methods Using a new device for infrared pupillometry, we examined the value of quantitative pupillary light reactivity (PLR) to predict outcome in comatose post-CA patients treated with TH. Twenty-four comatose CA patients treated with TH (33\u00b0C, 24 hours) were prospectively studied. The percentage variation in PLR was measured during TH (12 hours from CA), using the NeuroLight Algiscan\u00ae (IDMED, Marseille, France). For each patient, three consecutive measures were performed and the best value was retained for analysis. The relationship of PLR with survival and neurological outcome (CPC scores) at 3 months was analyzed, and the predictive value of PLR was compared with that of standard clinical examination (motor response and brainstem refl exes) performed at 48 hours from CA. Results Quantitative PLR was strongly associated with survival (median left-eye PLR 14% (11 to 16%) variation in survivors vs. 5.5% (4 to 8.5%) in nonsurvivors, P < 0.0001) and 3-month neurological outcome (14% (11 to 21%) in patients with CPC 1 to 2 vs. 5.5% (4 to 8.5%) in those with CPC 3 to 5, P <0.0001). Comparable fi ndings were obtained using right-eye PLR. A PLR >10% was 100% predictive of patient prognosis, with false-positive and false-negative rates of 0% for outcome. Clinical examination was signifi cantly associated with outcome; however, motor response (MR) and brainstem refl exes (BRS) yielded higher falsepositive and false-negative rates than PLR (Table 1) .",

Established guidelines to predict neurological outcome after cardiac arrest were developed before the widespread use of therapeutic hypothermia. The American Association of Neurology guidelines [1] currently recommend that absent or extensor motor scores on day 3 post arrest are reliable indicators or poor neurological outcome with a false positive rate of 0 to 3%. Methods A review of existing literature was undertaken to examine whether the utility of motor scores to predict poor neurological outcome is infl uenced by the use of therapeutic hypothermia. Results Six studies were identifi ed [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] that investigated the use of motor scores on day 3 post cardiac arrest in patients who had received therapeutic hypothermia. False positive rates (defi ned as 1 -specifi city) for predicting poor neurological outcome were calculable in fi ve of the six studies [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] and were 14%, 24%, 11%, 25% and 12% respectively.

In the adult, the immunoreactivities and protein levels of all the CBPs were markedly decreased at 4 days post ischemia; however, in the young, they were apparently maintained. At 7 days post ischemia, they were decreased in the young; however, they were much higher than those in the adult. Conclusion In brief, the immunoreactivities and levels of CBPs were not decreased in the ischemic CA1 region of the young 4 days after transient cerebral ischemia. This fi nding indicates that the longer maintenance of CBPs may contribute to a less and more delayed neuronal death/ damage in the young.",

We hypothesize that early and rapid induction of hypothermia will mitigate neuronal injury and improve survival in a swine model of TBI. Methods Twenty domestic cross-bred pigs (34 to 35 kg) were subjected to a 5 ATM (100 ms) lateral fl uid percussion TBI. The brain temperature and ICP were measured using Camino\u00ae. Serum biomarkers for neuronal injury -S-100\u03b2, neuron-specifi c enolase, glial fi brillary acid protein (GFAP), and neurofi laments heavy chain -were measured daily using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twelve of the injured animals were rapidly cooled to 32\u00b0C within 90 minutes of the injury using a transpulmonary hypothermia technique [2] . Hypothermia was maintained for 48 hours. Eight injured control animals were maintained at 37\u00b0C. In both groups, anesthesia (isofl urane 1%) was discontinued and the animals were weaned off the ventilator after 48 hours. Five days post injury, the surviving animals were euthanized and necropsied. The data were analyzed using a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, and ANOVA. Results Ten of the 12 hypothermia and four of the eight normothermia animals survived to the end of the 5-day study (\u03c7 2 = 2.597, df = 1, P = 0.1071). Although the probability of type I error between survival curves was 11%, the study was clinically signifi cant and showed a clear trend toward improved survival with hypothermia. The intracranial pressures were signifi cantly (P <0.05) lower in the hypothermia group. Both interventions -that is, general anesthesia and hypothermiamitigated the rise of serum biomarkers following TBI. However, the suppression of biomarkers was sustained during the recovery period only in the hypothermia group. With the exception of the GFAP levels, the curves of all biomarkers were signifi cantly diff erent between the groups. Conclusion Our preliminary fi ndings show early initiation, rapid induction, and prolonged maintenance (48 hours) of cerebral hypothermia to lower intracranial pressure, blunt the rise in serum biomarkers, and improve survival following TBI.

This study aimed to examine brain lactate metabolism in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI). Methods A prospective cohort of STBI patients monitored with cerebral microdialysis (CMD) and brain tissue oxygen (PbtO 2 ) was studied. Brain lactate metabolism was assessed by quantifi cation of elevated CMD lactate samples (>4 mmol/l). These were matched to pyruvate and PbtO 2 , and dichotomized as hyperglycolytic (CMD pyruvate >119 \u03bcmol/l) versus nonhyperglycolytic or as hypoxic (PbtO 2 <20 mmHg) versus nonhypoxic. Data were expressed as percentages per patient. Global brain perfusion (categorized as oligemic, normal or hyperemic) was assessed with CT perfusion (CTP). Results Twenty-four patients (total 1,782 CMD samples) were studied. Samples with elevated CMD lactate were frequently observed (41 \u00b1 8% SEM of individual samples). Brain lactate elevations were predominantly hyperglycolytic (73 \u00b1 8.2%), whilst only 14 \u00b1 6.3% of them were hypoxic. Trends over time of both lactate patterns are shown in Figure 1 . On CTP (n = 17; average 48 hours from TBI) hyperglycolytic lactate was always associated with normal or hyperemic CTP, whilst hypoxic lactate was associated with oligemic CTP (Table 1) . ",

Controversy exists regarding the optimal cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) required in TBI management. A tool for monitoring autoregulation and determining an optimal CPP is the pressure reactivity index (PRx), defi ned as a moving correlation coeffi cient between the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) at a frequency of at least 60 Hz. This requirement of high frequency has constrained its use to a few academic centers. An association was shown between outcome and continuous optimal CPP based on 4 hours of PRx [1] . We present a novel low-frequency autoregulation index (LAx), based on correlations between ICP and MAP at a standard minute-by-minute time resolution. Methods A total of 182 patients from the Brain-IT [2] multicentre European database had registered outcome and ICP and MAP for the fi rst 48 ICU hours. Twenty-one TBI patients admitted to the university hospitals of Leuven, Belgium and Tubingen, Germany were continuously monitored using ICM+ software (Cambridge Enterprise) allowing for continuous PRx calculation. Autoregulation indices versus CPP plots for PRx and LAx were computed to determine optimal CPP every minute during the fi rst 48 ICU hours [1] .",

Introduction Fever is a dangerous secondary insult for the injured brain [1] . We investigated the cerebral and hemodynamic eff ects of intravenous (i.v.) paracetamol administration for the control of fever in neurointensive care unit (NICU) patients. Methods The i.v. paracetamol (1 g in 15 minutes) was administered to NICU patients with a body temperature (Temp.) >37.5\u00b0C. Its eff ects on mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjVO 2 ) and Temp. were recorded at the start of paracetamol infusion (T0) and after 30 (T30), 60 (T60) and 120 (T120) minutes. Interventions for the maintenance of CPP >60 mmHg or ICP <20 mmHg were recorded. (Figure 1 ). In fi ve cases norepinephrine infusion was started for CPP <60 mmHg. In another two cases, for the same reason, the norepinephrine dosage was augmented.

Reference Introduction Evaluating resource utilization is paramount in critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), but little is known on readmissions after hospital discharge. We evaluated rates and determinants of unplanned readmission following TBI. Methods We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study from April 1998 to March 2009. Data were obtained from a Canadian provincial trauma system, based on mandatory contribution from 59 trauma centres, and a hospital discharge database. Patients aged \u226516 years with TBI (ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes of 850-854 and S06, respectively) were included. Patients who died during the index hospitalization, who lived outside the province, who could not be linked with the hospital discharge database were excluded. We collected baseline and trauma characteristics, hospital admissions in the 12 months preceding index admission, and readmissions in the 12 following months. Primary outcome was unplanned readmission 30 days, 3 months and 6 months post discharge. We evaluated sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with readmissions using a logistic regression model. Results Among 18,342 adult patients with TBI identifi ed in the registry, 14,777 patients were included among which 2,363 had severe, 1,106 moderate and 11,308 mild traumatic brain injury. Most patients were young (mean age: 52 \u00b1 23 years) and had no comorbidity (73.6%). Overall, 1,032 patients (7.0%) were readmitted within 30 days, 12.7% within 3 months and 17.6% within 6 months. At 30 days post discharge, 311 (30.1%) were readmitted for a complication. The median length of stay was 8 days (Q1 to Q3: 3 to 20). More than 10% of patients aged \u226575 years with \u22651 comorbidity or with \u22651 admission prior to index hospitalisation were readmitted. The severity of the TBI was not an independent predictor of readmission. Age, highest AIS, number of comorbidities, number of admissions prior to index hospitalization, level of index trauma center and discharge destination were associated with readmissions on multivariate analysis. Conclusion Readmissions in the months following TBI are frequent, but were not found to be associated with the TBI severity. Further studies evaluating reasons for readmission are warranted in order to develop strategies to prevent such events. Introduction Pituitary disorders following traumatic brain injury (TBI) are frequent, but their determinants are poorly understood. We performed a systematic review to assess the risk factors of TBIassociated pituitary disorders. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, BIOSIS, and Trip Database, and references of narrative reviews for cohort, cross-sectional and case-control studies enrolling at least fi ve adults with TBI in whom \u22651 pituitary axis was tested and one potential predictor reported. Two independent investigators selected citations, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We pooled the data from all studies assessing a specifi c predictor, regardless of the pituitary axis being evaluated. When more than one pituitary axis was assessed, we used the data related to hypopituitarism or the data from the most defective axis. When a pituitary axis was evaluated several times, we used assessment farthest from the injury. A meta-analysis was performed using random eff ect models and I 2 was used to evaluate heterogeneity. Introduction Prevention of secondary neurologic injuries is paramount for improved neurologic outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Evidence suggests that although therapeutic hypothermia (TH) lowers intracranial pressure and attenuates secondary cerebral insults after TBI [1] , it also induces hypotension. Brief episodes of mild hypotension in brain-injured patients can trigger secondary injuries, which have been associated with increased mortality in patients with TBI [2] . Vasopressin mitigates hypotension in septic shock and improves coronary perfusion in hypothermic cardiac arrest models [3] . We hypothesized that a lowdose vasopressin infusion may reduce the cumulative epinephrine dose in hypothermic, brain-injured swine. Methods Six domestic cross-bred pigs were subjected to epinephrine infusion after general anesthesia, standardized TBI and transpulmonary hypothermia (32\u00b0C for 48 hours). All animals received the same care, aiming for a mean arterial pressure >60 mmHg. At hour 24, animals received additional vasopressin infusion at 0.04 units/minute. We measured the cumulative epinephrine dose for each animal pre and post vasopressin infusion ( Figure 1 ) and performed a twosample Wilcoxon rank-sum test, comparing the median cumulative epinephrine doses in the two groups.",

Long-term functional outcome of TBI and its best timing of assessment are not well understood, and may be evaluated too prematurely in clinical studies because of resources required to do so without too much missing data. Hence, we conducted a systematic review of studies in severe TBI patients to evaluate the long-term functional outcome. We hypothesized that functional impact measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), or the extended version (GOSe), may plateau after several months in patients with severe TBI. Methods We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies (prospective and retrospective) in patients with severe TBI. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, BIOSIS, CINAHL and Trip Database from their inception to December 2011. References of included studies were searched for additional studies.

Introduction Prevention of secondary brain injury is the cornerstone in the management of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Although a variety of monitoring methods are available, due to lack of strong evidence their use varies considerably [1] . The objective of this survey was to provide an overview of the current practice in monitoring of patients with severe TBI in all neuro-ICUs across the UK. Introduction Pulmonary complications are frequently occurring medical complications after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) [1] . Early respiratory deterioration (ERD) may be associated with delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) or outcome and would then be a potential target for therapeutic interventions. We investigated whether respiratory deterioration within the fi rst 72 hours after admission predicted DCI or poor outcome.",

ERD was defi ned as increased need for ventilatory support the second or third day after admission (Table 1) . Elective intubation for a surgical procedure was not included as ERD. Inclusion criteria were availability of detailed information on respiratory status and level of support, admission within 48 hours after hemorrhage and age \u226518 years. Multivariable survival analysis was used to investigate associations of DCI, death and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) with ERD adjusted for condition on admission, Hijdra score, treatment of ruptured aneurysm and pulmonary comorbidity. GOS was assessed at 3 to 6 months after the bleed. DCI was defi ned as described recently [2] . Results Mean age of the patients was 55.9 (\u00b1 12.7) and 63.5% was female. A total 46.7% of the patients developed DCI. Mortality was 25.6%. Forty percent of the patients were classifi ed as having ERD. ERD was not associated with DCI (adjusted HR = 1.48; 95% CI = 0.88 to 2.49; P = 0.14). ERD showed a trend towards an association with mortality (adjusted HR = 2.22; 95% CI = 0.96 to 5.14; P = 0.06; additionally adjusted for age, and rebleed). A clear association was found between absence of ERD and functional outcome with ordinal logistic regression analysis (0.98 point increase in GOS score at 3 to 6 months; 95% CI = 0.14 to 1.82; P = 0.02; additionally adjusted for age and rebleed). Conclusion ERD within 72 hours after admission is associated with increased risk of poor functional outcome after aSAH, but not DCI. Further investigations are required to assess whether prevention of ERD may improve outcome. Introduction Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) may have deleterious eff ects on cerebral metabolism and mortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) [1, 2] , but its relevance has not yet been well explored. Aims of this study are to track ICP changes after SAH, to identify clinical factors associated with it and to explore the relationship between ICP and outcome. Methods A total of 116 consecutive SAH patients with ICP monitoring were enrolled. Episodes of ICP >20 mmHg for at least 5 minutes and the mean ICP value for every 12-hour interval were analyzed. The highest mean ICP collected in every patient was identifi ed. ICP values were analyzed in relation to clinical and CT fi ndings; 6-month outcome and ICU mortality were also introduced in multivariable logistic models. Results Eighty-one percent of patients had at least one episode of elevated ICP and 36% had a highest mean ICP >20 mmHg. The number of patients with highest mean ICP >20 mmHg or with episodes of HICP was maximum at day 3 after SAH and decreased only after day 7. Neurological status, aneurysmal rebleeding, amount of blood on CT and CT ischemic lesion occurred within 72 hours from SAH were signifi cantly related to highest mean ICP >20 mmHg in a multivariable model. Patients with highest mean ICP >20 mmHg showed signifi cantly higher mortality in ICU. However, ICP is not an independent predictor of 6 months unfavorable outcome. Conclusion Elevated intracranial pressure is a common complication in the fi rst week after SAH. It is associated with early brain injury severity and ICU mortality. . We systematically reviewed their prevalence, aiming particularly at studies with low risk of bias. Methods We searched Embase, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Trip Database, references of included studies and narrative reviews. We included cohort studies, cross-sectional studies and RCTs published in any language that tested the integrity of \u22651 pituitary axis in adults with aSAH. Studies including more than 50% of non-aneurismal SAH were excluded. Studies were considered at low risk of bias if the authors defi ned inclusion/exclusion criteria, avoided voluntary sampling, and tested >90% of included patients with proper detailed diagnostic criteria. Studies testing all pituitary axes were considered as evaluating hypopituitarism, which was defi ned as the dysfunction of \u22651 axis. We used a Freeman Tukey-type arcsine square-root transformation and pooled prevalences using the DerSimonian-Laird random-eff ect method. We determined the degree of heterogeneity with I 2 values. Results Among 12,363 citations, we included 28 studies (1,628 patients). Patients were mostly female (64%) aged 50.5 \u00b1 5.4. Sixteen studies reported the severity of aSAH, 14 reported the procedure for securing the aneurysm and 13 reported the location of aneurysm.",

There was an insuffi cient number of studies with low risk of bias to perform sensitivity analyses according to study quality. Conclusion The exact prevalence of pituitary disorders following aSAH remains uncertain, mainly due to high heterogeneity and the small number of studies with low risk of bias.

Methods One hundred and three ICUs on six continents enrolled subjects on 4 specifi c days in a 1-year period. Included subjects were between ages 7 days and 17 years who were diagnosed with acute traumatic brain injury, stroke, cardiac arrest, central nervous system infection or infl ammation, status epilepticus, spinal cord lesion, hydrocephalus, or brain mass. Sites completed a secure web-based case report form that included subject and hospital demographics, details about the neurological disease, interventions, length of stay, and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) score (good outcome = PCPC 1 to 3) and mortality at hospital discharge. Results Of 3,113 subjects screened, 1,009 (32%) met enrollment criteria. The mean number of subjects enrolled per site for each study day was 2.4. Most sites were dedicated pediatric ICUs with a mean number of 22 ICU beds (range 3 to 72). ICUs had resources to invasively monitor intracranial pressure (93%), continuous electroencephalography (14%), invasive and non-invasive brain tissue oxygenation (14% and 57%), and somatosensory evoked potentials (39%). There were on average 11 ICU faculty and six fellows per site, and nearly one-half reported a neurocritical care ICU team. Subjects were 58% male and 52% white, and 60% had normal pre-admission PCPC scores (85%). Status epilepticus and cardiac arrest (both 21%) had the highest prevalence. Sixty-one per cent of subjects were mechanically ventilated during ICU admission. ICU length of stay was a mean 29 days (median 43 days) and hospital LOS was a mean 43 days (median 61 days). Survival at hospital discharge was 87% with 58% of subjects discharged home and 17% to inpatient rehabilitation. Conclusion Acute neurological disease is a signifi cant pediatric health issue.

All patients that needed prophylactic dosing of enoxaparine after cardiac surgery were duly informed and after giving written consent we included 44 patients with a mean Euroscore of 1.66. The demographic specifi cations, medical and surgical history of all patients were collected. Anti-Xa activity was measured at three diff erent points in time. We determined baseline, peak and trough anti-Xa activity: preoperatively, and respectively 4 hours after the third dose of enoxaparine and 30 minutes before the fourth dose. Each measurement was done with both techniques, the two-stage chromogenic assay at the laboratory (Biophen\u00ae) and the bedside assay (Hemochron\u00ae Jr). Results Our dose regimen of enoxaparine achieved in one-half of the included patients a suffi cient anti-Xa activity for prevention of thromboembolic events. One-half of the patients with insuffi cient anti-Xa activity had a body mass index over 30 kg/m 2 . Comparison of the bedside assay with the two-stage chromogenic assay by means of the Pearson's correlation coeffi cient showed correlation of the two tests if no variables were taken into account. In the Bland-Altman analysis we could not confi rm this correlation. Conclusion The bedside anti-Xa activity assay with a Hemochron device tends to show some correlation with the two-stage chromogenic assay, but insuffi cient to be used as an alternative, in this small but uniform patient population. Use of a standard dosing protocol for enoxaparine administration is prone for underdosage in post-cardiac surgery patients and may increase postoperative morbidity. References Introduction We hypothesized that higher doses of enoxaparin would improve thromboprophylaxis without increasing the risk of bleeding. Critically ill patients are predisposed to venous thromboembolism, leading to increased risk of adverse outcome [1] . Peak anti-factor Xa (anti-Xa) levels of 0.1 to 0.4 IU/ml, 4 hours post administration of enoxaparin, refl ect adequate thromboprophylaxis for medico-surgical patients.",

The fi rst-in-class hepcidin antagonist NOX-H94, a PEGylated anti-hepcidin L-RNA oligonucleotide, is in development for targeted treatment of anemia of infl ammation. We investigated whether NOX-H94 prevents the infl ammation-induced serum iron decrease during experimental human endotoxemia. Methods A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 24 healthy young men. At T = 0 hours, 2 ng/kg E. coli endotoxin was administered intravenously (i.v.), followed by 1.2 mg/kg NOX-H94 or placebo i.v. at T = 0.5 hours. Blood was drawn serially after endotoxin administration for measurements of infl ammatory parameters, cytokines, NOX-H94 pharmacokinetics, total hepcidin-25, and iron parameters. The diff erence of serum iron change from baseline at T = 9 hours was defi ned as the primary endpoint. Results Endotoxin administration led to fl u-like symptoms. Infl ammatory parameters (CRP, body temperature, leucocytes, and plasma levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1RA) peaked markedly and similarly in both treatment groups. NOX-H94 was well tolerated. Plasma concentrations peaked at 0.7 \u00b1 0.4 hours after the start of administration, after which they declined according to a two-compartment model, with a T 1/2 of 22.5 \u00b1 4.28 hours. In the placebo group, serum iron increased from 19.0 \u00b1 7.6 \u03bcg/l at baseline to a peak at T = 3 hours, returned close to baseline at T = 6 hours and decreased under the baseline concentration at T = 9 hours, reaching its lowest point at T = 12 hours. In the NOX-H94 group, serum iron concentrations rose until T = 6 hours and then slowly declined until T = 24 hours. From 6 to 12 hours post LPS, the serum iron concentrations in NOX-H94-treated subjects were signifi cantly higher than in placebo-treated subjects (P <0.0001, ANCOVA). Conclusion Experimental human endotoxemia induces a robust infl am matory response and a subsequent decrease in serum iron. Treatment with NOX-H94 had no eff ect on innate immunity, but eff ectively prevented the infl ammation-induced drop in serum iron concentrations. These fi ndings demonstrate the clinical potential of the anti-hepcidin drug NOX-H94 for further development to treat patients with anemia of infl ammation. ",

This study aims to determine the association between haemoglobin levels on admission to intensive care and patient length of stay and mortality. Methods A retrospective collection of data from patient admissions to a single fi ve-bed ICU over a 15-year period identifi ed 5,826 patients between April 1994 and November 2012. Patients were split into groups according to haemoglobin concentration on admission. The data were analysed to determine whether there was any relationship between haemoglobin concentration at ICU admission and any of our outcome measures (unit and hospital mortality, unit and hospital length of stay). Results Patients with haemoglobin concentrations \u226410 g/dl and >10.1 g/dl were used in mortality comparisons. Patients with a haemo globin concentration \u226410 g/dl had an increase in ICU mortality compared with those with haemoglobin levels >10 g/dl (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.30 to 1.71, P <0.0001). A similar diff erence was seen with hospital mortality (\u226410 g/dl 37.7% vs. >10 g/dl 27.3%, P <0.0001). Unit length of stay was signifi cantly longer in patients with admission Hb \u226410 g/ dl (5.34 days) compared with an admission Hb >10 g/dl (4.08 days), P <0.0001. Hospital length of stay was also signifi cantly longer in patients with Hb \u226410 g/dl versus Hb >10 g/dl (21.6 days vs. 15.5 days, P <0.0001). There was seen to be an inverse correlation between haemoglobin concentration and patient age (r = -0.174; P <0.0001). Conclusion Haemoglobin concentrations \u226410 g/dl on admission to the ICU are associated with an increase in ICU mortality, hospital mortality, unit length of stay and hospital length of stay when compared with patients admitted with haemoglobin concentrations >10 g/dl.

Introduction Coagulopathy, particularly a trend toward hypercoagula bility and hypofi brinolysis, is common in critically ill patients and correlates with worse outcome. Available laboratory coagulation tests to assess fi brinolysis are expensive and time demanding. We investigated whether a modifi ed thromboelastography with the plasminogen activator urokinase (UKIF-TEG) [1] may be able to evaluate fi brinolysis in a population of critically ill patients. Methods UKIF-TEG was performed as follows: fi rst urokinase was added to citrate blood to give fi nal concentrations of 160 UI/ml, then thromboelastography (TEG) analysis was started after kaolin activation and recalcifi cation with calcium chloride. Basal TEG (no addition of urokinase) was also performed. Fibrinolysis was determined by the loss of clot strength after the maximal amplitude (MA), and recorded as Ly30 (percentage lysis at 30 minutes after MA) and as Ly60 (percentage lysis at 60 minutes after MA).",

Conclusion UKIF-TEG could be a feasible point-of-care method to evaluate fi brinolysis in critically ill patients. Methods We performed a randomized, double-blind study in 37 patients who underwent cesarean section. Patients were divided into two groups: the fi rst group (n = 19) received preoperative (30 minutes before operation) tranexamic acid 10 mg/kg; the second group (n = 18) received preoperative placebo. The condition of hemostasis was monitored by haemoviscoelastography. Results All patients included in the study before surgery had moderate hypercoagulation and normal fi brinolysis: increasing the intensity of clot formation (ICF) to 11.4% compared with normal rates; the intensity of the retraction and clot lysis (IRCL) was 16.45 \u00b1 1.40 in both groups. At the start of the operation in patients (Group 1), ICF decreased by 9.7% (P <0.05), and IRCL decreased by 27.6% (P <0.05) compared with preoperatively. In Group 2, there was ICF decrease by 8.8% (P <0.05), and IRCL increase by 11.4% (P <0.05) compared with preoperatively. At the end of the operation, the condition of hemostasis in both groups came almost to the same value -moderate hypocoagulation, depressed fi brinolysis. In both groups there were no thrombotic complications. Intraoperative blood loss in the fi rst group was 300 \u00b1 40.5 and in the second was 500 \u00b1 60.6. Conclusion Using of tranexamic acid before surgery signifi cantly reduces intraoperative blood loss by 60%, without thrombotic complications. Introduction Rotational thromboelastography (ROTEM) can detect dilutive and hypothermic eff ects on coagulation and evaluate corrective treatments. The aim of this in vitro study was to study whether fi brinogen concentrate alone or combined with factor XIII could reverse colloid-induced and crystalloid-induced coagulopathies in the presence and absence of hypothermia. Methods Citrated venous blood from 10 healthy volunteers was diluted by 33% using 130/0.42 hydroxyethyl starch or Ringer's acetate. ROTEM was used to evaluate the eff ect of addition of either fi brinogen concentrate corresponding to 4 g/70 kg, or this fi brinogen dose combined with factor XIII equivalent to 20 IU/kg. Blood was analyzed at 33 or 37\u00b0C with ROTEM ExTEM and FibTEM reagents. Results A signifi cant dilutive response was shown in both groups: hypocoagulation was greater in the starch group. Hypothermia lengthened the following: ExTEM clotting time (CT), clot formation time and \u03b1 angle; FibTEM maximal clot formation (MCF). Irrespective of temperature, fi brinogen overcorrected Ringer's acetate's eff ects on all ROTEM parameters and partially reversed starch's eff ects on ExTEM CT and FibTEM MCF. FibTEM demonstrated that factor XIII provided an additional procoagulative eff ect in the Ringer's acetate group at both temperatures but not the starch group. The only ExTEM parameter to be improved by addition of factor XIII was MCF at 33\u00b0C. Conclusion ROTEM shows that fi brinogen concentrate can reverse dilutive coagulation defects induced by colloid and crystalloid at both 33 and 37\u00b0C. Some additional reversal was provided by factor XIII: higher doses of both fi brinogen and factor XIII may counteract starch's eff ects on clot structure. Introduction Natural colloid albumin induces a lesser degree of dilutional coagulopathy than synthetic colloids. Fibrinogen concentrate has emerged as a promising strategy to treat coagulopathy, and factor XIII (FXIII) works synergistically with fi brinogen to correct coagulopathy following haemodilution with crystalloids. Objectives were to examine the ability of fi brinogen and FXIII concentrates to reverse albumininduced dilutional coagulopathy.",

Following haemodilution, both doses of fi brinogen signifi cantly corrected all ROTEM parameters (P \u22640.02), except the lower dose did not correct AA. Compared with the lower dose, the higher dose of fi brinogen signifi cantly improved FIBTEM MCF and EXTEM MCF, AA and CFT (P <0.001).

All combinations of high/low concentrations of fi brinogen/ FXIII signifi cantly improved all ROTEM parameters examined (P \u22640.001). Fibrinogen concentration generally had a greater eff ect on each parameter than did FXIII concentration; the best correction of ROTEM parameters was achieved with high-dose fi brinogen concentrate and either low-dose or high-dose FXIII.

In the 1,500 to 3,000 ml PPH, allogeneic transfusion was decreased in the IOCS group: 17.6 versus 56.3% (P = 0.006); PRBC: 0 (0 to 3) versus 3 (0 to 6) (P = 0.045). IOCS spared 87 blood bank PRBC (17,374 ml); that is, 24.2% of the total transfusion need. No amniotic fl uid embolism has been observed in the group with IOCS whereas one case appeared in the control group without IOCS. Conclusion Regarding the literature [1] [2] [3] [4] and our study, IOCS could be used safely in PPH during CS.

That there were still cases of heparin rebound in the infusion group suggests that the infusion was not as eff ective as expected and/or the dose was inadequate. However, previous studies assessed heparin rebound using isolated clotting parameters [1, 2] . Here, we used TEG. As TEG measures the thrombodynamic properties of whole blood coagulation, perhaps it is a more reliable indicator of heparin activity? As a retrospective study, there are limitations; namely, the nonstandardised management of the patients and the potential bias in the anaesthetists' selection of patients for an infusion. This group may be inherently higher risk for bleeding. However, heparin rebound is common and protamine is a simple, relatively safe and low-cost intervention compared with transfusion and so further study is needed.",

The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of death or severe complications. The patients were monitored for 30 days. Results A total of 1,521 patients were screened for eligibility and 248 met the inclusion criteria. After exclusions for medical reasons or a lack of consent, 198 patients were included in fi nal analysis, with 101 allocated to the restrictive group and 97 to the liberal group. The primary composite endpoint -all-cause mortality, cardiovascular complications, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy, septic shock or reoperation at 30 days -occurred in 19.6% of the patients in the liberal strategy group and in 35.6% in the restrictive group (P = 0.012).

We defi ned the patients who received more than 10 unit packed red blood cells (PRBCs) within the fi rst 24 hours as a MT group and who received less than 9 units PRBCs as a non-MT group. After the demographic data, number of units of PRBCs and the need for massive transfusions were recorded and analyzed in each groups, we compared data between two groups. Results There were 114 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Fifty patients received blood transfusions (43.9%; 50/114). There were 27 patients in the MT group (23.7%; 27/114) and 87 in the non-MT group.

Fibrinogen was only a predictor of a MT without a scoring system such as ABCs and TASHs, and the optimal cutoff value was 205 mg/dl. Conclusion We found that the level of fi brinogen was the most valuable predictor of a MT in the coagulation or fi brinolysis markers. It is certain that the level of fi brinogen at admission was not as useful as the TASHs about predicting a MT in this study.

However, issues surrounding their safety have emerged in the past decades. It is important to identify the potential complications associated with RBC transfusions, in order to evaluate their risk-benefi t ratio better. Methods A single-center prospective observational study of all children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) over a 1-year period. The variables possibly related to RBC transfusions were identifi ed before the study was initiated, and their presence was assessed daily for each child. In transfused cases (TCs), a variable was considered as a possible outcome related to the transfusion only if it was observed after the fi rst transfusion. Results During the study period, 913 admissions were documented, 843 of which were included in the study. Among them, 144 (17%) were transfused. When comparing TCs with nontransfused cases (NTCs), the odds ratio (OR) of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (NPMODS) was 2.39 (95% CI = 1.58 to 3.62, P <0.001). This association remained statistically signifi cant in the multivariate analysis for children with admission PRISM score \u22645 (OR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.08 to 5.37, P = 0.032). TCs were ventilated longer than NTCs (14.1 \u00b1 32.6 days vs. 4.3 \u00b1 9.6 days, P <0.001). This diff erence was still signifi cant after adjustment using a Cox model. Moreover, we observed an adjusted dose-eff ect relationship between RBC transfusions and length of mechanical ventilation. The PICU length of stay was signifi cantly increased for TCs (12.4 \u00b1 26.2 days vs. 4.9 \u00b1 10.2 days, P <0.001), even after multivariate adjustment (hazard ratio of PICU discharge for TCs: 0.61, 95% CI = 0.5 to 0.74, P <0.001). We also observed an adjusted dose-eff ect relationship between RBC transfusions and PICU length of stay. The paired analysis for comparison of pre-transfusion and posttransfusion values showed that the arterial partial pressure in oxygen was signifi cantly reduced after the fi rst transfusion (mean diff erence 42.8 mmHg, 95% CI = 27.2 to 58.3, P <0.001). The paired analysis also showed an increased proportion of renal replacement therapy, while the proportions of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock did not diff er. Conclusion RBC transfusions were associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and prolonged PICU stay. The risk of NPMODS was increased in some transfused children. Moreover, our study questions the ability of stored RBCs to improve oxygenation in critically ill children. These results should help to improve transfusion practice in the PICU.",

Following ethics approval, all cases fi lling this criterion were identifi ed in the hospital's birthing and blood bank systems. Data were extracted from the medical histories and analysed using SPSS. P <0.05 was considered statistically signifi cant.",

            "text": "Results Twenty-eight women in three years (2009 to 2011) underwent a massive transfusion for obstetric haemorrhage, with nine receiving more than 10 units of RBCs in 24 hours. Eleven (39%) were admitted to the ICU and 11 underwent a hysterectomy, of which six were admitted to the ICU. The median estimated blood loss was 4,335 ml (IQR 3,000 to 5,000). Median blood product delivery was RBC 8 units (IQR 6 to 13); FFP 4 units (IQR 4 to 8); platelets 4 units (IQR 0 to 8) and cryoprecipitate 3 units (IQR 0 to 10). One-half of the women received the fi rst four units of RBCs in less than 34 minutes. Other blood products were started a median of 49 minutes, 44 minutes and 75 minutes after the RBC transfusion commenced, respectively. Eight women had a fi brinogen level <0.8 g/l on the initial coagulation test during the haemorrhage. The remaining 20 women had a median fi brinogen level of 3.7 g/l (IQR 3.15 to 4.9). There was no diff erence in the transfusion of RBCs (P = 0.20), FFPs (P = 0.96) and platelets (P = 0.48) in women who showed an initial low fi brinogen and those who did not, although there was a diff erence in the number of units of cryoprecipitate (P <0.05). The median lowest Hb during the haemorrhage was 66 g/l (IQR 51 to 80) and median discharge Hb was 103 g/l (IQR 96 to 113). No blood product reaction was noted and there was one death. Conclusion Massive transfusion for obstetric haemorrhage involved rapid blood product administration with no consistent pattern in the ratio of products administered. Introduction Blood transfusions are associated with longer ICU and hospital inpatient durations, and an increase in mortality [1] . This study was undertaken to investigate whether the practice of packed red cell Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2 http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2 S139 (PRC) transfusions in the ICU was in accordance with the best clinical evidence. A number of studies, most notably the TRICC study [2] , have shown that indications for ICU blood transfusions are a haemoglobin (Hb) level of <7 g/dl or evidence of acute haemorrhage [3] . These criteria were therefore employed. Methods This study prospectively examined episodes of PRC unit transfusions over a 2-month period in the ICU of a large level 1 trauma centre and a tertiary cardiac unit. The number of PRC units transfused in each episode was recorded by nurses, along with the proposed indication and concurrent Hb level. The data were analysed to assess the number of transfusions administered contrary to the guidelines, along with the average Hb level at which a PRC unit was transfused and the average number of units administered per episode. Results A total 175 units of PRC were transfused in the ICU, over 105 episodes during the 2-month period (excluding immediately postoperative transfusions). Ninety-four units (53.7%) administered in 64 transfusion episodes (61.0%) occurred contrary to the guidelines. In 89.3% of these cases the recorded reason for transfusion was an apparently low Hb level. The median (IQR (range)) Hb level at which patients were transfused: within guidelines was 6.9 g/dl (6.6 to 7.7 (4.8 to 13.9)); within guidelines, excluding cases of acute blood loss, was 6.6 g/dl (6.5 to 6.8 (5.5 to 6.9)); and outside the guidelines was 7.7 g/dl (7.4 to 8.2 (7.0 to 9.7)). One unit of PRC was transfused in 57 episodes (54.3%), 2 units of PRC were transfused in 36 episodes (34.3%), and 3 to 6 units were transfused in 12 episodes (11.4%), with two-thirds of the latter due to acute haemorrhage.",

Mice infused with PBS or LPS served as controls. Concomitantly, mice infused with the MHC-I antibody were treated with C1 inhibitor (Cetor\u00ae; Sanquin, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) in a dose of 400 IU/kg intravenously. After infusion, mice were mechanically ventilated with a lung-protective pressurecontrolled mode for 2 hours and then sacrifi ced, after which a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was done. Statistics were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, values expressed as mean and standard deviation. Results Injection of LPS and MHC-I antibodies resulted in TRALI, indicated by increased levels of protein in the BAL fl uid, wet/dry ratios and levels of KC, MIP-2 and IL-6. C1 inhibitor Cetor\u00ae signifi cantly reduced total protein in BAL fl uid from 792 (169) to 421 (230) \u03bcg/ml (P <0.001) and tended to reduce the wet/dry ratio from 5.3 \u00b1 0.3 to 4.9 \u00b1 0.5 (P = 0.09). Cetor\u00ae also reduced BALF levels of MIP-2 from 214 (54) to 127 (22) pg/ml (P <0.01). KC and IL-6 levels were not aff ected. Conclusion In a model of antibody-mediated TRALI, C1 inhibitor attenuated pulmonary infl ammation. C1 inhibition may be a potential benefi cial intervention in TRALI. Introduction Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a syndrome that presents as a sudden onset of respiratory distress 6 hours after transfusion of blood products. The diagnosis is based on clinical and radiographic fi ndings. Particularly at risk for TRALI are cardiac surgery patients. However, specifi c patient risk factors and data on outcome are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate incidence, risk factors and outcome of TRALI in cardiac surgical patients on cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods All thoracic surgery patients from a university hospital in the Netherlands of 18 years and older admitted to the ICU from January 2009 until December 2011 were screened. Included patients were observed during surgery and the fi rst 24 hours on the ICU for the onset of possible TRALI. The Canadian Consensus Conference TRALI defi nition was used. Two independent physicians blinded to the predictor variables scored the chest radiographs for the onset of bilateral interstitial abnormalities on 2K monitors. When interpretation diff ered, chest radiographs were reviewed by a third physician to achieve consensus. The European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EURO score) and the American Association of Anesthesiology (ASA) were scored before surgery. By calculating the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and IV scores the severity of illness was determined on arrival in the ICU.",

We further subdivided each group by the median value of baseline HCO 3 -a (24.3 (22.3 to 26.1) mmol/l) and we analyzed the \u0394BEa: we observed a greater increase in patients with lower baseline HCO 3 -a (Group 1, 1.8 \u00b1 2.9 vs. 0.2 \u00b1 2.6, mmol/l, P <0.001; Group 2, 4.0 \u00b1 2.7 vs. 1.5 \u00b1 2.6, mmol/l, P <0.001; Group 3, 4.4 \u00b1 2.8 vs. 1.7 \u00b1 2.0 mmol/l, P <0.001), as compared with those with higher baseline levels.

We hypothesized that the use of an age, kidney and liver function adjusted sedation protocol would be associated with reduced doses and improved outcomes compared with a standard protocol. Methods This was a prospective cohort study comparing 3 months of a standard protocol (control group) with 3 months of an adjusted protocol (intervention group). In the adjusted protocol, patients were divided into three categories: category 1 (age <60 years, and normal kidney and liver function), category 2 (age = 60 to 70 years, or moderate kidney or liver function impairment), and category 3 (age >70 years, or severe kidney or liver function impairment). The upper limits of analgesics and sedatives doses were determined by age, and kidney and liver function, being lowest in category 3, and lower in category 2 than category 1. All consecutive adults mechanically ventilated patients who required infusion of analgesics and/or sedatives for >24 hours were included in the study. We compared the main outcomes of both groups including average daily doses of analgesics and sedatives; average Sedation-Agitation Scale (SAS), pain and GCS scores; mechanical ventilation duration (MVD); sedation-related complications during ICU stay; ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and ICU and hospital mortality. Results Two hundred and four patients were included in the study (control group = 105; adjusted protocol group = 99). There was no diff erence in baseline characteristics between the two groups. The adjusted protocol group, compared with the control group, received signifi cantly lower average daily doses of fentanyl (2,162 \u00b1 2,110 \u03bcg vs. 3,650 \u00b1 3,253 \u03bcg, P = 0.0001), nonsignifi cant lower average daily doses of midazolam and dexmedetomidine, and a trend toward higher average daily doses of propofol. Pain score was higher in the adjusted protocol group (0.98 \u00b1 0.72 vs. 0.16 \u00b1 0.35, P <0.0001) with no diff erence in SAS or GCS scores. Sedation-related complications during ICU stay were not diff erent between the two groups; however, agitation (SAS = 5) was less frequent in the adjusted protocol group (3% vs. 30%, P <0.0001). ICU mortality was signifi cantly lower in the Introduction The aim of this research was to provide clinically relevant evidence for Y-site compatibility of drug infusion combinations used in the PICU. Pharmacists and clinicians regularly have to interpret limited published data, particularly when more than two drugs are Y-sited. The risk of potential incompatibility must be balanced against that of additional line insertion. Methods A full 28-factorial design (total 256 combinations) was used to investigate chemical and physical compatibility of fi ve drugs (clonidine, morphine, ketamine, midazolam and furosemide). The drugs were studied at their highest commonly infused concentrations and exposed to three variations in environmental conditions (diluent: sodium chloride 0.9% or glucose 10%; temperature 25 or 37\u00b0C; and normal room lighting or blue light phototherapy). Chemical stability was assessed using HPLC; >10% reduction in concentration indicated incompatibility. Physical incompatibility was confi rmed by precipitation, pH or colour change.",

            "text": "Results Environmental conditions had no eff ect on the drug mixtures. The precipitation observed in incompatible combinations was due to either a change in pH, or with ketamine the presence of benzethonium chloride. Of 31 possible drug combinations, 12 were incompatible. A further three combinations were incompatible at extreme pH, or were of concern and so should be avoided. The incompatible formulations all contained furosemide. All combinations of the sedative agents studied were chemically and physically compatible. Conclusion This work provides evidence for Y-site compatibility of morphine, midazolam, clonidine and ketamine in any combination, which will potentially reduce the need for extra intravenous lines. Furosemide is incompatible with any of these sedative drugs and must be infused via a separate line. These results will aid clinical decisionmaking and help satisfy the requirements of recent UK Department of Health legislation relating to the mixing of medicines. Reference",

Methods A total of 40 sedated and paralyzed Sprague-Dawley rats (301 \u00b1 55 g) were investigated in four consecutive studies. (1) To investigate the eff ects of diazepam on blood glucose, 15 rats were randomly assigned to intraperitoneal anesthesia with tiopenthal 80 mg/kg (DZP0), tiopenthal 40 mg/kg + diazepam 5 mg/kg (DPZ5) or tiopenthal 40 mg/kg + diazepam 15 mg/kg (DZP15). Blood levels of glucose (GEM premier 3000; IL) were measured at time intervals over 2 hours. (2) Ten animals randomized to DZP0 or DZP5 underwent an intravenous glucose tolerance test with glucose bolus (0.5 g/kg). Acute insulin response, the mean value of blood insulin (Insulin ELISA kit; Millipore) from 2 to 10 minutes after glucose bolus, was measured as index of insulin secretion. (3) A hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp obtained by a continuous intravenous infusion of insulin (130 mUI/ kg/minute) was run in 10 animals randomized to DZP0 or DZP5 and the glucose infusion rate (GIR, mg/kg/minute) was assessed [1] . (4) Introduction We report our experience in the use of isofl urane for prolonged sedation in severe ARDS patients. Prolonged sedation in the ICU may be diffi cult because of tolerance, drug dependence and withdrawal, drug interactions and side eff ects. Inhaled anesthetics have been proposed for sedation in ventilator-dependent ICU patients. AnaConDa is a device that allows a safety and easy administration of inhaled anesthetics in the ICU. Methods From January 2009 to June 2012, 15 patients were sedated with isofl urane by means of the AnaConDa device. We consider administration of isofl urane as a washout period from common sedative drugs in patients with (at least one of ): high sedative drug dosage (propofol \u2265300 mg/hour or midazolam \u22658 mg/hour) to reach the target Richmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS) or inadequate paralysis; two or more hypnotic drugs to reach the target RASS (propofol, midazolam, hydroxyzine, haloperidol, diazepam, quetiapine); and hypertriglyceridemia. During isofl urane administration previous hypnotic drugs were interrupted. We retrospectively collected data before, during and after administration of isofl urane: hemodynamic parameters, renal and hepatic function, level of sedation (RASS) and sedative drug dosage. All data are reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, otherwise as median (minimum to maximum). Results Mean age was 43 \u00b1 12 years and SAPS II was 35.7 \u00b1 11; 13 patients were treated with ECMO for severe ARDS and four had a history of drug abuse; median ICU length of stay was 41 (15 to 127) days and they were ventilated for 41 (12 to 114) days. Due to severe critical illness, target RASS was -4 for all patients, most of which were also paralysed. Isofl urane was administered in nine patients because of a high level of common sedative drugs, in fi ve patients due to the use of two or more hypnotic drugs and in one patient because of hypertrigliceridemia. Isofl urane administration lasted 5.6 \u00b1 1.8 days.",

The cholinergic anti-infl ammatory pathway (CAP) is a neurophysiological mechanism that regulates the infl ammatory response by inhibiting proinfl ammatory cytokine synthesis, thereby preventing tissue damage. Endotoxemia-induced microcirculatory dysfunction can be reduced by cholinergic CAP activation. Clonidine improves survival in experimental sepsis [1] by reducing the sympathetic tone, resulting in the parasympatheticmediated CAP activation. The aim of this study was to determine the eff ects of clonidine on microcirculatory alterations during endotoxemia. Methods Using fl uorescent intravital microscopy, we determined the venular wall shear rate, macromolecular effl ux and leukocyte adhesion in mesenteric postcapillary venules of male Wistar rats. Endotoxemia was induced over 120 minutes by intravenous infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Control groups received an equivalent volume of saline. Clonidine 10 \u03bcg/kg was applied as i.v. bolus in treatment groups. Animals received either (i) saline alone, (ii) clonidine 10 minutes prior to saline administration, (iii) clonidine 45 minutes prior to LPS administration, (iv) clonidine 10 minutes prior to LPS administration, (v) clonidine 30 minutes after LPS administration or (vi) LPS alone. Results All LPS groups (iii to vi) showed a signifi cantly reduced venular wall shear rate compared with the saline group after 120 minutes. There were no signifi cant diff erences between the numbers of adhering leukocytes in the clonidine/LPS groups (iii, iv, v) and the LPS group after 120 minutes. Macromolecular effl ux signifi cantly increased in all groups over the time period of 120 minutes. After 120 minutes there was no diff erence between the LPS group and the clonidine 10 minutes prior to LPS administration group (iv) whereas all other groups (i, ii, iii, v) showed a signifi cantly reduced macromolecular effl ux compared with the LPS group.

Introduction Delivering analgesics via conjunctival application could provide rapid and convenient pain relief in disaster medicine. There are sporadic reports from the USA concerning inhalation administration of aerosol with various drugs producing a wide variety of eff ects from anxiolysis, sedation, and loss of aggressiveness to immobilisation. We attempted to determine in an animal experiment whether conjunctival administration of S+ketamine could produce signifi cant eff ect without side eff ects. Methods After ethic committee approval, 10 rabbits were administered conjunctival S+ketamine 2.5 mg/kg. Measured parameters were SpO 2 , blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) before administration and in 1-minute intervals and immobilisation time (loss of righting refl ex [1] . We can speculate that the reason for stability of cardiorespiratory parameters was due to the sympathoadrenergic eff ect of ketamine or due to the method of administration. There were no signs of conjunctival irritation in any animal (S+ketamine is a preservative-free solution). Conclusion Conjunctival S+ketamine 2.5 mg/kg in rabbits produced rapid onset without changes in cardiorespiratory parameters and without signs of irritation of the eye. The results of our project warrant further research to increase the variety of drugs and methods of their administration for anxiolysis, sedation and analgesia in disaster medicine.",

We defi ned the criteria for Pre-PRIS as requiring a CK \u2265320 mmol/l that had doubled from its base level and a rise in TG \u22651.7 IU/l; both that followed a trend with propofol dose. Conclusion We propose that a paired rise in CK and TG that can be attributed to propofol alone represents a Pre-PRIS state that is at risk of developing into full PRIS. We noted this in 22% of our patients, all on modest doses of propofol. It is unclear what proportion of patients will develop the full syndrome as it is not ethically possible to continue propofol in this situation. We advocate daily monitoring of CK and TG to identify Pre-PRIS so that propofol can be reduced or substituted to avoid the morbidity and mortality of the full syndrome.

The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of delirium in the fi rst four postoperative days. Secondary outcomes were duration of delirium, use of restrictive measures and sedative, antipsychotic and analgesic requirements. Delirium was assessed daily by trained research personnel, using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method. Medical, nursing and medication charts were evaluated for signs of delirium and use of prespecifi ed medication. Analysis was by intention to treat. Results Of 768 eligible patients, complete data on delirium could be collected in 738 patients. The incidence of delirium was 14.2% in the dexamethasone group and 14.9% in the placebo group (odds ratio = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.63 to 1.43). No signifi cant diff erence was found on the duration of delirium between the intervention (median = 2 days, interquartile range 1 to 3 days) and placebo (median = 2 days, interquartile range 1 to 2 days) group (P = 0.45). The use of restrictive measures and administration of sedatives, haloperidol, benzodiazepine and opiates were comparable between both groups. Conclusion Intraoperative injection of dexamethasone seems not to aff ect the incidence or duration of delirium in the fi rst 4 days after cardiac surgery, suggesting this regimen is safe to use in the operative setting with respect to psychiatric adverse events.

Delirium was considered a major problem (83%) that requires adequate treatment (99%) and is underdiagnosed (81%). Respondents considered that routine screening of delirium can improve prognosis (95%). However, only a minority (20%) answered that delirium is preventable. Only 39% of the respondents had received any training about delirium in the previous 3 years and 77% of them found training useful. The mean delirium knowledge score was 6.6 out of 10 (SD = 1.54). When all groups were mutually compared, nurses scored lower than delirium experts (ANOVA, P = 0.013). The respondents (58%; n = 210) from three ICUs indicated that CAM-ICU assessment was department policy. However, 50% (n = 106) of these respondents felt unfamiliar with CAM-ICU and only 47% (n = 99) of them indicated that a positive CAM-ICU was used for treatment decisions. Haloperidol was the fi rst-choice pharmacological treatment. Only 21% of all respondents knew that a national ICU delirium guideline existed, but in-depth knowledge was generally low. Conclusion Our survey showed that healthcare professionals considered delirium an important but underdiagnosed form of organ failure. In contrast, screening tools for delirium are scarcely used, knowledge can be improved and protocolled treatment based on positive screening is often lacking. These results suggest that the focus of implementation of ICU delirium management should not be on motivational aspects, but on knowledge improvements, training in screening tools and implementation of treatment and prevention protocols. Introduction Delirium is an acute disturbance of consciousness and cognition. It is a common disorder in the ICU and associated with impaired long-term outcome [1, 2] . Despite its frequency and impact, delirium is poorly recognized by ICU physicians and nurses using delirium screening tools [3] . A completely new approach to detect delirium is to use monitoring of physiological alterations. Temperature variability, a measure for temperature regulation, could be an interesting parameter for monitoring of ICU delirium, but this has never been investigated before. The aim of this study was to investigate whether temperature variability is aff ected during ICU delirium.",

Patients with conditions aff ecting thermal regulation, including infectious diseases, and those receiving therapies aff ecting body temperature were excluded. Twenty-four ICU patients were included after screening 334 delirious ICU patients. Daily temperature variability was determined by computing the mean absolute second derivative of the temperature signal. Per patient, temperature variability during delirious days was compared with nondelirium days using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. With a linear mixed model, diff erences between delirium and nondelirium days with regard to temperature variability were analysed adjusted for daily mean Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale scores, daily maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and within-patient correlation. Results Temperature variability was increased during delirium days compared with days without delirium (mean diff erence = -0.007, 95% CI = -0.004; -0.011, P <0.001). Adjusting for confounders did not alter our fi ndings (adjusted mean diff erence = -0.005, 95% CI = -0.008; -0.002, P <0.001). Conclusion Temperature variability is increased during delirium in ICU patients, which refl ects the encephalopathy that underlies delirium. Opportunities for delirium monitoring using temperature variability should be further explored.

This study was conducted to investigate the association Introduction We aimed to clarify the diff erences between primary and secondary acute GI injury. Methods A total of 2,690 consecutive adult patients were retrospectively studied during their fi rst week in the ICU. Pathology in the GI system or laparotomy defi ned the primary GI insult. If GI symptoms developed without primary GI insult it was considered secondary GI injury. Absent bowel sounds (BS), vomiting/regurgitation, diarrhoea, bowel distension, GI bleeding, and high gastric residuals (GRV >1,000 ml/24 hours) were recorded daily. Results In total, 2,690 patients (60.4% male), median age 59 years (range 16 to 92), were studied. Eighty-four per cent of them were ventilated, 72% received vasopressor/inotrope. Median (IQR) APACHE II score was 14 (9 to 21) and SOFA on the fi rst day was 6 (3 to 10). A total 35.5% had primary GI pathology. During the fi rst week 34% of patients had absent BS, 38% vomiting/regurgitation, 9% diarrhoea, 7% bowel distension, 6% high GRV and 5% GI bleeding. All symptoms except diarrhoea occurred more often (<0.001) in patients with primary GI insult. Eighty-fi ve per cent of patients with primary GI insult versus 46% without developed at least one GI symptom. The incidence of GI symptoms was signifi cantly higher in nonsurvivors. ICU mortality was lower in patients with primary than secondary GI injury (43.6% vs. 61.2%, P = 0.046). Nonsurvivors without primary GI insult developed GI symptoms later (Figure 1 ). Conclusion Primary and secondary acute GI injury have diff erent incidence, dynamics and outcome. ventilation with relative risk of 9 to 27% and with mortality of 25 to 50% [1, 2] . One of the promoting factors of VAP is the increased pH of the gastric acid, which occurs when H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are used for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The results of this pilot study suggest that there may be no diff erence in the incidence of VAP and GI bleeding if stress ulcer prophylaxis is performed by H2RA or PPI. As the latter is more expensive, its use as fi rst choice in critical care should be questioned. Conclusion Depending on resection size liver resection acutely increases portal venous pressure and induces neurohumoral activation resulting in compromised renal function and increased risk of developing AKI. Introduction Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) requiring admission to an ICU is associated with high mortality (hospital mortality reached 42%) and long lengths of stay [1] . Survival among patients with predicted SAP at admission has been shown to correlate with the duration of organ failure (OF) [2] . The systemic determinant of severity in a new classifi cation of acute pancreatitis (AP) is also based on identifi cation of patients with transient or persistent OF [3] .",

Optimum cutoff levels (by ROC curve analysis) were APACHE II score \u226512 (sensitivity 0.790; 1 -specifi city 0.119), total SOFA score \u22654 (sensitivity 0.829; 1 -specifi city 0.190), and failure \u22652 organs/systems (sensitivity 0.819; 1 -specifi city 0.214). See Table 1 . Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of thrombopoietin (TPO) plasma levels as a biomarker of clinical severity in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). TPO is a humoral growth factor that stimulates megakaryocyte proliferation and diff erentiation [1] . Furthermore, it favors platelet aggregation and polymorphonuclear leukocyte activation [2] . Elevated plasmatic concentrations of TPO have been shown in patients with critical diseases, including ACS, burn injury and sepsis [2] . In particular, clinical severity is the major determinant of elevated TPO levels in patients with sepsis [3] . AP is a relatively common disease whose diagnosis and treatment are often diffi cult, especially in the clinical setting of the emergency department (ED Introduction Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a common cause of acute kidney injury and occurs in various clinical conditions including shock and cardiovascular surgery. Renal IRI releases proinfl ammatory cytokines within the kidney. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has natriuretic, diuretic and anti-infl ammatory eff ects [1] and plays an important role of regulating blood pressure and volume homeostasis. The hypothesis was that renal IRI induces infl ammation not only in the kidney but also in remote organs such as the lung and heart and ANP attenuates renal injury and infl ammation in the kidney, lung and heart. Methods Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital. Tracheostomy was performed and rats were ventilated at VT 10 ml/kg with 5 cmH 2 O PEEP. The right carotid artery was catheterized for blood sampling and continuous blood pressure measurements. The right femoral vein was catheterized for infusion of saline or ANP. Rats were divided into three groups; IRI group (n = 10), left renal pedicle was clamped for 30 minutes; IRI+ANP group (n = 10), left renal pedicle was clamped for 30 minutes, ANP (0.2 \u03bcg/kg/minute, for 3 hours 25 minutes) was started 5 minutes after clamp; and Sham group (n = 6), the shamoperated rats. Hemodynamics, arterial blood gas, and plasma lactate levels were measured at baseline and at 1 hour, 2 hours and 3 hours after declamp. The mRNA expression of IL-6 in the kidney, lung, and heart were measured. The kidney, lung and heart were immunostained to examine the localization of IL-6 and NF-\u03baB and assigned an expression score. The wet/dry ratio of the lung was also measured. Results Renal IRI induced metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, mRNA expression of IL-6 in the kidney, lung and heart. Renal IRI increased immunohistochemical localization of IL-6 in the proximal convoluted tubule of the left kidney and NF-\u03baB in the bronchial epithelial cells of the lung. ANP attenuated metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema and expression of IL-6 mRNA in the kidney, heart, and lung. ANP decreased immunohistochemical localization of IL-6 in the left kidney and NF-\u03baB in the lung. Conclusion These fi ndings suggested that infl ammation within the kidney after renal IRI was extended into the lung and heart. ANP attenuated metabolic acidosis and infl ammation in the kidney, lung and heart in a rat model of renal IRI. ANP may attenuate organ crosstalk between the kidney, lung and heart. Reference increase in urinary NGAL in patients receiving bicarbonate infusion was observed compared with control (P = 0.011). The incidence of postoperative RRT was similar but hospital mortality was increased in patients treated with bicarbonate compared with chloride (11/174 (6.3%) vs. 3/176 (1.7%), OR 3.89 (1.07 to 14.2), P = 0.031).

After the fi rst hour Cl-U remained higher than Na+U, which progressively decreased, leading to a reduction in AGU and pHU over time. In parallel, a progressive increment in NH4+U was observed. In patients receiving more than one administration we observed an increase in arterial base excess (1.8 \u00b1 0.8 vs. 5.0 \u00b1 0.6 mmol/l, P <0.001) and plasmatic strong ion diff erence (SIDpl) (31 (30 to 33) vs. 35 (34 to 36) mEq/l, P = 0.01) during the study period. These changes were due to a decrease in plasmatic Clconcentration (109.0 \u00b1 1.1 vs. 106.6 \u00b1 0.9 mEq/l, P = 0.009). Plasmatic sodium and potassium concentrations did not change. In these patients, considering the total amount of administered fl uids and urine, a negative water and chloride balance was observed (-460 \u00b1 403 ml and -48 \u00b1 48 mEq, respectively). Conclusion Furosemide acts immediately after administration, causing a rise in urinary output, Na+U and Cl-U concentrations. Loop-diureticinduced metabolic alkalosis may be due to an increased urinary chloride loss and the associated increase in SIDpl. Reference Introduction Given the signifi cant morbidity and mortality associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), there is a need to fi nd factors to help aid decision-making regarding levels of therapeutic support. As a prognostic biomarker, the red cell distribution width (RDW) has attracted interest in the setting of critical care when added to existing scoring systems [1] . By examining RDW in a previously studied AKI cohort, we aimed to evaluate the utility of this routine blood test. Methods A cohort of 209 mixed critical care patients who received renal replacement therapy for AKI had their demographic and biochemical data retrieved from electronic databases. Outcomes were gathered for ICU and hospital mortality. Incomplete datasets were discarded, leading to 153 complete sets. RDW data were taken from the fi rst sample after admission to the ICU, as were all other biochemical values apart from pre-RRT creatinine and potassium. Overall cohort characteristics were gathered, and two groups were created: those with a RDW value within normal range (\u226414.5%) and those with a greater than normal value (>14.5%). We then further subgrouped RDW to assess the correlation between rising levels and ICU mortality. Results A total 77.1% of our cohort had a RDW greater than the normal laboratory range at time of ICU admission. Key baseline characteristics (age, APACHE II score, length of stay, ICU mortality) did not diff er signifi cantly between patients with normal and abnormal RDW. When subgroup analysis was performed, no statistically signifi cant correlation between rising RDW and ICU mortality was found (Spearman correlation = 0.426, P = 0.233).",

Diuretic treatment in shock and hypovolemia is not rational, but can be tried in oliguric patients with normovolemia or hypervolemia and without hypotension. In such patients it still does not always increase dieresis and can also be harmful. The resistive index is a measure of pulsatile blood fl ow that refl ects the resistance to blood fl ow caused by the microvascular bed distal to the site of measurement. It can refl ect functional status of the tissue distal to the point of measurement. We investigated whether measuring the renal resistive index (RI) could be helpful in determining which patients will respond to furosemide treatment. Methods We included medical ICU patients with sepsis and oliguria (urine output <1 ml/kg/hour) who were prescribed i.v. furose mide. Patients with known chronic renal failure, hypovolemia (CVP <10 mmHg) or severe hypotension (MAP <80 mmHg) were excluded. Resistive index (1 \u2212 (end diastolic velocity / maximum systolic velocity)\u00d7100) was measured in at least three segmental arteries of both kidneys, the average of all measurements was reported as the result. Repeated assessments were viewed as independent if separated by more than 24 hours. Furosemide was given intravenously in the dose of 40 mg after RI measurement. Positive response to furosemide was defi ned as doubling of hourly dieresis or achieving urine output >1.5 ml/kg/hour after drug administration.",

Conclusion SDMA appears to be an accurate and precise estimate of GFR and a more sensitive biomarker of renal dysfunction than SCr. We predict SDMA will perform better than SCr as a biomarker of AKI. This forms the basis of a future study. Introduction Growing evidence hints that bidirectional interaction between heart failure and kidney disease and renal insuffi ciency is a strong predictor of mortality as well as causally linked to the progression of heart failure. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is an early predictor of acute kidney injury (AKI). We evaluated the impact of NGAL on morbidity and mortality in patients with acute heart failure. Methods Seventy-six patients presenting with symptoms consistent with acute heart failure (median age 72 years, 56% male) were enrolled. Plasma NGAL levels were measured by an ELISA at admission and compared with the glomerular fi ltration rate (eGFR) and B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The primary outcome was AKI development defi ned by RIFLE criteria (fall in GFR >25% or creatinine rise \u226550% from baseline, or a fall in urine output <0.5 ml/kg/hour) and secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. Conclusion NGAL is emerging as a promising biomarker of AKI in the setting of acute heart failure and elevated NGAL levels indicate a poor prognosis in this population regarding morbidity and mortality.",

We examined whether aetiology of AKI, comorbidity burden, hospital length of stay and treatment in ICU had any signifi cant association with survival in the study cohort. Methods During 2009, 56 patients were identifi ed to have received RRT with AKI who were admitted to the ICU at the Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust.

In cases of metabolic acidosis, not related to inappropriate citrate metabolism and persisting after optimization of RCA-CVVH parameter setting, bicarbonate infusion was scheduled. Starting from September 2011, in order to optimize buff er balance and to reduce the need for phosphate supplementation, a new RCA-CVVH protocol has been designed using an 18 mmol/l citrate solution combined with a recently introduced phosphate-containing replacement fl uid with bicarbonate (HCO 3 - Conclusion Protocol B provided a buff er balance more positive than protocol A and allowed one to adequately control acid-base status without additional bicarbonate infusion and in the absence of alkalosis, despite the use of a standard bicarbonate concentration replacement solution. Furthermore, the combination of a phosphate-containing replacement fl uid appeared eff ective to prevent hypophosphatemia. Introduction The aim of this study was to establish the intraobserver and interobserver variation of ultrasonographic measurements of the rectus femoris muscle cross-section area (RF-CSA). Muscle wasting is frequent in the ICU, aff ecting more than one-half of the patients with severe sepsis [1] . Muscle mass reduces rapidly, and 15 to 20% is lost within the fi rst week [1] . To monitor muscle mass, ultrasound has the benefi ts of being both readily available in the ICU and non-invasive. Ultrasonographic measurement of RF-CSA has an almost perfect correlation with MRI (mean interclass correlation (ICC) = 0.999) [2] and RF-CSA is linearly related to maximum voluntary contraction strength in both healthy subjects and COPD patients (r = 0.78) [3] . Methods The study had two purposes: to determine the intraobserver variation for RF-CSA by one observer scanning 15 healthy adult volunteers three times each at 2-day intervals; and to determine the interobserver variation for RF-CSA by two observers each scanning 15 adult ICU patients on the same day. Patients were in a supine position, legs in passive extension. The transducer was placed perpendicular to the long axis of the right thigh over the RF, two-thirds of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the superior patellar border [1] . RF-CSA was calculated by planimetry. At each scan, three measurements were made. For intraobserver variation, the 3\u00d73 scans were analyzed using the interclass correlation coeffi cient. For interobserver variation, the three measurements from each observer were averaged and compared using Bland-Altman statistics. Results Intraobserver variation: 15 healthy adults, age 39.6 \u00b1 2.4 years, weight 66.8 \u00b1 2.3 kg, sex three male/12 female. ICC: 0.996 (95% CI: 0.990 to 0.998). Interobserver variation: 15 ICU patients, age: 77 \u00b1 8.3 years, weight: 71.3 \u00b1 9.1 kg, sex nine male/six female. Bland-Altman: bias: -0.07 cm 2 , 95% limits of agreement -0.188 to 0.048 cm 2 . Conclusion Ultrasonographic measurement of RF-CSA is easily learned and quickly performed. It has a very low intraobserver and interobserver variation and can be recommended as a reliable method for monitoring muscle wasting in the ICU.",

We hypothesized that nutrient-independent factors of critical illness explain these fi ndings, and also that M2macrophage accumulation during critical illness may not be limited to adipose tissue. Methods We performed a randomized investigation in a septic mouse model of critical illness and a study of ICU patient biopsies. In the critically ill mouse, we compared the eff ect of parenteral nutrition (n = 13) with fasting (n = 11) on body composition, adipocyte cell size, and macrophage accumulation in adipose tissue, liver and lung. Fed healthy control mice (n = 11) were studied for comparison. In vivo adipose tissue was harvested after 1 week of illness from human patients (n = 40) who participated in a RCT on early parenteral nutrition versus tolerating nutrient restriction [2] , adipose tissue morphology was characterized and compared with healthy controls (n = 13). Results Irrespective of nutritional intake, critically ill mice lost body weight, total fat and fat-free mass. Part of the fat loss was explained by reduced ectopic fat accumulation. Adipocyte cell number and the adipogenic markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 and CCAT/enhancer binding-protein \u03b2 increased with illness, again irrespective of nutritional intake. Macrophage accumulation with predominant M2-phenotype was observed in adipose tissue, liver and lungs of critically ill mice, further accentuated by fasting in visceral tissues. Macrophage M2-markers correlated with chemoattractant factor expression in all studied tissues. In human subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies of critically ill patients, increased adipogenic markers and M2 macrophage accumulation were present irrespective of nutritional intake. Conclusion Adipogenesis and accumulation of M2-macrophages are hallmarks of critical illness, irrespective of nutritional management in humans and mice. Critical illness evokes macrophage polarization to the M2-state not only in adipose tissue but also in liver and lungs, which is further accentuated by fasting.",

Magnesium-treated women were younger (age: 31 \u00b1 7 vs. 36 \u00b1 5 years, P = 0.02). The baseline calcium concentrations were similar for the two groups (2.2 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 mmol/l, P = 0.85). Patients receiving magnesium had signifi cantly higher magnesium concentrations (2.1 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 mmol/l, P <0.001), and signifi cantly lower calcium concentrations during therapy (1.6 \u00b1 0.3 vs. 1.9 \u00b1 0.3 mmol/l, P <0.001).

Physicians should be aware of the potential for symptomatic hypocalcemia during magnesium therapy. Introduction Disorders of sodium (Na + ) and water homeostasis are common in hospitalised patients. Hyponatremia in particular has been associated with worse hospital outcome and length of stay [1] . We aimed to defi ne the incidence of hyponatremia (serum Na + \u2264134 mmol/l) in our intensive care population and to determine whether it was associated with ICU outcome or length of stay. Methods Demographics, APACHE II score, outcome data and admission sodium were retrieved from the Ward Watcher system in the Victoria Infi rmary ICU for 2,440 consecutive admissions from January 2005 to present. We divided patients into three groups depending on serum Na + (\u2264134 mmol/l, 135 to 144 mmol/l, \u2265145 mmol/l) and compared APACHE II score, length of stay and ICU outcome between patients with a low versus a normal serum Na + . Data were analysed using the chi-squared test, Student's t test and the Mann-Whitney test where appropriate. Results Of the 2,440 patients studied, 1,993 had APACHE II data and serum Na + recorded and so were included for analysis. In total, 453 patients (22.7%) had a serum Na + \u2264134 mmol/l and 1,388 patients (67.1%) had a serum Na + of 135 to 144 mmol/l. Patients with a low Na + had a higher mortality (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.16 to 1.90, P <0.001), a higher APACHE II score (22 vs. 19, P <0.001) and higher mean age (60 years vs. 58 years, P <0.001) than patients with a normal serum Na + . Mean length of stay of patients with low serum Na + was also longer (5.1 days vs. 4.6 days) although this was not statistically signifi cant (P = 0.09). Conclusion In summary, hyponatremia is a useful index of severity of illness in our ICU population. Whether this is a direct adverse eff ect of low serum sodium levels, or if hyponatremia is simply a marker for 'sicker' patients, is not known. Reference Introduction The anion gap (AG) is used routinely in the assessment of metabolic acidosis, but can be misleading in patients with hypoalbuminemia and other disorders commonly encountered in intensive care. This approach to acid-base analysis relies on assessment of pH, pCO 2 , sodium, bicarbonate and chloride, and can lead to underestimation or overestimation of the true electrochemical status of a patient, as it does not include important ions such as lactate, calcium, magnesium, and albumin. The strong ion gap (SIG) is an alternative to the AG and is based upon Stewart's physical chemistry approach. However, the SIG is cumbersome to calculate. As such, a number of shortcut equations have been developed in an eff ort to approximate the SIG. We sought to compare three such equations, the Kellum corrected anion gap (KellAGc), the Moviat equation, and EZSIG, in an eff ort to evaluate precision and accuracy [1] [2] [3] . Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients admitted to the ICU of George Washington University Medical Center from September 2010 to March 2011. Of the 1,516 patients screened, 200 met inclusion criteria, which included availability of all laboratory components to calculate the SIG, obtained within 1 hour of each other. Demographic data and serum values for pH, pCO 2 , albumin, lactate, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, magnesium, phosphate, and calcium were collected. The AG, SIG, KellAGc, EZSIG, and Moviat equations were subsequently calculated and compared using Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. Results The mean SIG was 3.25 \u00b1 3.5. Mean values for KellAGc, Moviat, and EZSIG were 4.5 \u00b1 5.0, 1.77 \u00b1 2.2, and 3.6 \u00b1 3.7, respectively. Pearson correlation coeffi cients for KellAGc, Moviat, and EZSIG when compared with the SIG were r = 0.77, P = 0.0001; r = 0.88, P = 0.001; and r = 0.89, P = 0.001, respectively. In Bland-Altman analysis, the mean bias for the test equations versus the SIG were: KellAGc (1.25), Moviat (-1.48), and EZSIG (0.40). Conclusion While all three equations correlated highly with the SIG, the EZSIG and Moviat outperformed the KellAGc in Pearson and Bland-Altman analysis. The EZSIG had a smaller bias than the Moviat equation and a slightly better correlation (0.89 vs. 0.88). In the assessment of critically ill patients, EZSIG is a candidate scanning equation for the measurement of the SIG when all SIG components are not available. university-affi liated teaching hospital in Tunis. Patients admitted within the fi rst 24 hours post burn with greater than 10% total body surface area (TBSA) burned were enrolled in this study from 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2010. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, history of adrenal insuffi ciency, or steroid therapy within 6 months prior to burns. A short corticotrophin test (250 \u03bcg) was performed, and cortisol levels were measured at baseline (CS T0) and 60 minutes post test. Adrenal insuffi ciency was defi ned by a response \u22649 \u03bcg/dl. Relative adrenal insuffi ciency was further defi ned by a baseline cortisol >20 \u03bcg/dl. Results Patients were assigned into two groups: G1 (RAI, n = 7) and G2 (absence AI, n = 11). Comparative study of the two groups shows the results presented in Table 1 . Conclusion RAI is common in severely burned patients during the acute phase, and is associated with shock. Further prospective controlled studies will be necessary to establish risk factors of RAI in severely burned patients and its impact on their prognosis.",

            "text": "Albumin-adjusted calcium concentration should not be used to identify hypocalcaemia in critical illness T Steele 1 , R Introduction Hypocalcaemia is common in critical illness and accurate assessment is crucial. Small studies have shown that albumin-adjusted calcium (adjCa) does not accurately predict the ionised calcium (iCa) concentration in critically ill patients, yet adjCa continues to be widely used [1] . We investigated the reliability of using adjCa to identify hypocalcaemia in a large, diverse population requiring intensive care. Methods In a retrospective study of patients admitted to the ICUs of a tertiary care hospital between January 2008 and 2012, iCa and pH were extracted from routine blood gas results and total calcium, albumin and phosphate from routine biochemistry results. adjCa was calculated using a formula derived from and validated on the local population [2] . Sensitivity, specifi city, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) and area under the curve (AUC) of adjCa for predicting hypocalcaemia (iCa <1.1 mmol/l) were calculated. Results In total, 18 patients were included. The mean age was 69 \u00b1 2 years, mean weight 76 \u00b1 2 kg, APACHE II score 23 \u00b1 2 and most patients suff ered from pneumosepsis. On the fi rst day of intubation, total and free testosterone levels were extremely low in most patients and remained low during the fi rst week (Figure 1 ). 17\u03b2-Estradiol levels were elevated on day 1 and decreased during the fi rst week. LH and FSH levels were inappropriately low. All lipoprotein fractions and their apo-proteins were reduced as well as 17-OH-progesterone, DHEA and DHEAS. In contrast, androstenedione (adione) levels were elevated. This suggests preferential and stimulated synthesis of androstenedione ( Figure 2 ). The high 17\u03b2-estradiol levels indicate that androstenedione is shunted into the estrogen pathway, a process that requires high aromatase activity. The high estradiol/total testosterone ratio supports this conclusion. Conclusion Hyperestrogenic hypotestosteronemia is a frequent fi nding in the acute phase of severe sepsis in male patients with respiratory failure. It is suggested to be caused by decreased androgen production and shunting of androgen to estrogen synthesis as a result of increased aromatase activity. The clinical relevance of gonadal hormone substitution needs further study. Introduction Melatonin could have a meaningful role in critically ill patients, because of its immunomodulatory, antioxidant and sleep regulation properties; it is reduced in critical illness. The purpose of this study is to describe the endogenous blood melatonin values in ICU patients and their correlation with clinical parameters. Methods Seventy-three high-risk critically ill patients mechanically ventilated for >48 hours were enrolled. Blood samples for melatonin assay were collected between the 3rd and the 8th day of the ICU stay. Melatonin was determined by radioimmunoassay and ELISA. The peak and the area under the curve (AUC) calculated for each patient were correlated with the clinical parameters using the regression for quantiles test.",

In the presence of glutamate plus malate, only platelets incubated with a high dose of metformin had a mitochondrial VO 2 signifi cantly lower than controls. In the presence of succinate, mitochondrial VO 2 of controls did not change signifi cantly whereas that of platelets incubated with metformin did. The eff ect of succinate tended to become larger as the dose of metformin was increased from 0 up to 166 mg/l (0.3 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 0.6 \u00b1 0.3 vs. 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 nmol/minute*10 6 cells) (P = 0.068). Even so, mitochondrial VO 2 of platelets incubated with the highest dose of metformin did not return to the levels of controls. Extra-mitochondrial VO 2 was always the same. Introduction Metformin, widely used as an antidiabetic drug, activates the AMP activated protein kinase, a key regulator of the metabolism providing protection under fuel defi ciency. Chronic metformin therapy has been shown in long-term follow-up clinical studies to reduce cardiovascular mortality [1] . In animal experiments, acute metformin pretreatment has been shown to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury on cardiomyocytes [2] . We want to evaluate whether outcomes are aff ected in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Introduction Metformin, an oral hypoglycemic drug, belongs to the biguanide class and is now generally accepted as fi rst-line treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially in overweight patients [1] . In some predisposing conditions, the use of metformin may result in metforminassociated lactic acidosis (MALA), a rare adverse event associated with a high mortality rate [2] . The aim of this study is to assess risk factors and prognostic factors in patients with MALA. [4] . In our study, a higher plasma concentration of lactate represents the main negative prognostic factor, as pointed out by other studies [5] . The prothrombin activity, which is considered to be a decisive prognostic factor in the study of Peters and colleagues [6] , was not impaired in patients with poor outcome.",

The CD4 cell count was 84 (25 to 274) cells/mm 3 and viral load was 17,733 (67 to 174,214) copies/ml; 57% had at least one opportunistic infection; 55% had used antiretroviral therapy previous to ICU admission. Mechanical ventilation was used by 46% of patients and hospital mortality was 42%. Total SOFA score was 5 (2 to 9) points. Cardiovascular dysfunction was the most common on the fi rst day of stay (51%), followed by respiratory (42%), neurological (40%), renal (35%), hematological (27%) and hepatic (17%). Cardiovascular and renal dysfunctions presented with higher rate of severe dysfunction (30% and 15%, respectively). Rates of neurological (P = 0.002), renal (P = 0.009) and hematological (P = 0.003) dysfunctions were higher in nonsurvivors. Age, CD4 cell count, malnutrition, and opportunistic infections were included in the multivariate analysis. Neurological dysfunction was the independent risk factor for hospital mortality (odds 3.2 (1.4 to 7.2)). The presence of neurological dysfunction was dichotomized: associated or not with primary neurological diagnosis; survival was lower in the patients with neurological dysfunction and without primary neurological diagnosis (log-rank test 0.001 in the 7-day and 0.02 in the 28-day analysis). Sixty-day survival was similar in primary and secondary neurological dysfunction, but it remained lower than in patients without neurological impairment. Conclusion Neurological dysfunction was independently associated with hospital survival, mainly in those AIDS critically patients without primary neuropathy. Results A total of 273 charts were reviewed. In total, 242 were categorized into A (n = 126), B (n = 79) or C (n = 37). D (n = 31) consisted mainly of patients with hematological malignancies (n = 12) and patients with chemotherapy or immunosuppressive treatment (n = 14). The groups diff ered in length of stay with A< B< C. During the fi rst 3 days the SOFA score was higher in A compared with C and in B compared with C. The duration of antibiotic therapy was longer in both B and C compared with A. There were no diff erences in 28-day mortality (A: 34/126 = 27%, B: 30/79 = 38%, C: 15/37 = 40%); however, the proportions of patients dying between days 8 and 28 were higher in B (14/63 = 22%) and C (7/29 = 24%) compared with A (5/95 = 5%). Conclusion In this retrospective material it was possible to categorize 88.6% of all patients as having primary, secondary or tertiary sepsis. The categories diff ered in clinical picture at presentation as well as in outcome. A prospective study is warranted to validate the results of this study. Conclusion Older people represent a growing proportion of the population although their representation in the critical care population remained constant in this 10-year study. These patients had a slightly higher median APACHE II score and 14.5% greater critical care mortality than the younger patients. The majority of survivors were able to go home; however, 31% died within 22 months with signifi cant life expectancy curtailment, surviving on average only 7.4 months after discharge; this has not changed in the last 10 years. Those who survived this initial period (69%) had a much better outlook. This information may be vital to patients and physicians when discussing admission to critical care. Reference",

In order to assess preadmission quality of life, the patient or close relatives complete the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) within 72 hours after ICU admission. Mortality is evaluated from ICU admission until 30 days hereafter. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses are employed to assess predictive value for mortality using fi ve models: Introduction Long-term compromise after traumatic injury is signifi cant; however, few modifi able factors that infl uence outcome have been identifi ed. The aim of this study was to identify acute and early post-acute predictors of long-term recovery amenable to change through intervention. Methods Adults (>17 years) admitted to the ICU, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Australia following injury were prospectively followed. Data were collected on demographics, pre-injury health, injury characteristics and acute care factors. Psychosocial measures (selfeffi cacy (SE), illness perception (IP), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and psychological distress) and health status (SF-36) were collected via questionnaire 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post injury.",

In this ongoing prospective observational study, we collect and analyze the anonymized data of all patients discharged from our ICU prior to and after the introduction of the SwissDRG. The primary endpoint was the length of stay on the ICU in hours. The secondary endpoints were the severity of illness of the patients at the time of discharge, detected by the scoring system SAPS II as well as measured by the number of readmissions to the ICU. Initially all patients were analyzed and in a second step only patients within percentiles 6 to 94 were considered. We also analyzed the subgroups of patients referred internally, patients sent back to referring hospital and patients regionalized to a homebase hospital. The statistics have been done with SPSS and P <0.05 was considered signifi cant. Results We present the results of an 18-month period, 9 months prior to and 9 months after the introduction of the SwissDRG. Data of 1,491 and 1,492 patients were analyzed, respectively. When all patients were included, we found prior to and after the introduction of the DRGs a comparable length of stay on the ICU (mean \u00b1 SD of 52.1 \u00b1 2.2 hours vs. 50.82 \u00b1 2.2 hours), no diff erence in the severity of illness at discharge detected by the SAPS II (mean \u00b1 SD of 27.9 \u00b1 0.3 vs. 28.4 \u00b1 0.3) and the number of readmissions (91 vs. 92). There was also no signifi cant diff erence when only percentiles 6 to 94 were included or when the three subgroups were analyzed. Conclusion Up to now, the introduction of the SwissDRG has no infl uence on patients' discharge characteristics from a large ICU. Data assessment will continue and further data analysis has to be performed. There are only few data on the infl uence of DRG on ICU patients [1, 2] . We expect that the introduction of the DRG in Switzerland will change the number of admissions from external hospitals to a large ICU with a centre function and will infl uence the severity of disease of the admitted patients.",

Patients who died in the ICU were excluded. The day of discharge (D/C) and severity using APACHE IV and its related Acute Physiology Score (APS) component were calculated daily for the fi rst 7 days. Trend was assessed across days by Cuzick's test. Results A total of 719 surgical and 925 medical patients met inclusion criteria. In total, 20.2% of surgical and 21.3% of medical patients had an ICU LOS <1; P = 0.58. Admission severity was correlated with length of stay, P = 0.014 for both medical and surgical patients. Medical patients are sicker on admission and D/C from the ICU than surgical patients (P <0.05) (Figure 1 ). Conclusion ICU utilization diff ered by patient type even with unifi ed triage control within a single unit. Surgical patients were less severely ill on admission to and D/C from the ICU. A signifi cant percentage of medical and surgical patients are D/C within 1 day and may be more effi ciently served in a less resource-intensive environment. The reasons for the diff erences in ICU utilization for surgical versus medical patients require clarifi cation and may have implications for both resource utilization and cost. Introduction Interest in safety and clinical outcomes of inpatients has been growing in Japan, because the 100,000 Lives Campaign was introduced under the Japanese Patient Safety Act in 2008. In this act, an introduction of the Rapid Response System (RRS) was one of the mainstreams to inpatients' care. However, many Japanese healthcare providers cannot understand how to achieve the introduction of the RRS, because there are few who have knowledge of the system. Therefore, we developed a new introductory training course for the RRS. The educational eff ectiveness was analyzed through the surveillance questionnaires after the course. Methods The educational program includes a lecture series con cerning the outline and management methods, introduction of facilities that have already deployed, small group discussions, and teaching methods-of-training for the medical emergency team using a simulator. Evaluation was made in the fi ve-point scale by 82 participants (58 physicians, 16 nurses and eight other professions) throughout seven courses. The questionnaires are: A. understanding of RRS, B. knowledge acquisition about patient safety, C. expectation for decreasing the cardiopulmonary arrest by RRS, and D. expectation for decreasing the psychological burden by RRS. Results Seventy-three participants (89.0%) answered the questionnaires. The numbers of participants who scored more than four points were as follows: A. was 71 (97.2%), B. was 70 (95.9%), C. was 64 (87.7%), and D. was 68 (93.2%), respectively. The majority of participants obtained the correct knowledge, and had a solid understanding for the RRS. It was evident that providing abundant material and didactic lectures traced from the introduction to management, and collecting and resolving the questions, promoted comprehension. However, there is a limitation of whether or not the participants introduce the RRS into their own institutions. It is essential to improve the course and continue to support the activities of the participants. Conclusion Our training course may promote the introduction and dissemination of the RRS in Japan.",

Introduction Alcohol-related hospital and ICU admissions are known to have a huge impact on healthcare resources in the UK. Excessive use of alcohol is independently associated with sepsis, septic shock and hospital mortality among ICU patients. This study assesses the relationship between alcohol abuse and intensive care resource utilisation in a mixed medical, surgical and neurosurgical ICU. Methods A prospective survey of emergency alcohol-related admissions over a 1-year period was undertaken at a tertiary university adult general and neurosurgical ICU. All patients were screened for acute and chronic alcohol abuse on admission. Acute alcohol abuse was defi ned as being intoxicated with alcohol at the time of admission and chronic alcohol abuse was defi ned as chronic alcohol use exceeding recommended UK national guidelines on consumption. The amount of alcohol consumption was obtained, diagnosis on admission, ICU and hospital mortality, length of stay, and total cost were recorded. All patients were screened for alcohol-related comorbidities. Comparative retrospective data were obtained for the same time period for nonalcohol-related emergency ICU admissions. Data were analyzed using SPSS. Results In total, 7.7% of patients were admitted with a history of acute/chronic alcohol excess. Sixty-seven per cent of alcoholrelated admissions were due to acute alcohol excess. Neurosurgical patients admitted due to alcohol excess had higher ITU mortality than nonalcohol-related neurosurgical patients: 32.1% versus 14.39% (P = 0.02), respectively. Ninety-three per cent of alcohol-related neurosurgical admissions were caused by acute alcohol intoxication. The intensive care cost was signifi cantly higher for alcohol-related (\u00a312,396 per patient) compared with nonalcohol-related neurosurgical admissions (\u00a37,284 per patient). Of the medical patients admitted, 60% of these admissions were due to acute alcohol excess. The cost of intensive care treatment was lower for alcohol-related medical admissions.",

Our survey confi rms that alcohol-related admissions to the ICU are commonplace; however, our frequency is signifi cantly less than previously reported. Our study reveals interspecialty variations in demographic data, APACHE II scores, mortality and cost of admission. Neurosurgical alcohol-related admissions bear higher mortality and result in greater resource utilisation relative to nonalcohol-related neurosurgical admissions. Alcohol continues to burden both our patients and critical care. During the fi rst three postoperative days, preoperative AHI >30 was associated with a prolonged weaning time, a reduced oxygenation index (arterial pO 2 /FiO 2 ), an impaired kidney function, an augmented infl ammatory response and an overall increased length of stay in the ICU. The observed association of high preoperative AHI values with postoperative clinical characteristics remained statistically signifi cant throughout the fi rst three postoperative days. Conclusion Undiagnosed SDB is highly prevalent among cardiac surgical patients. Clinical trajectories of individuals with severe SDB are described by a prolonged recovery of pulmonary function, delayed weaning and a pronounced infl ammatory response after surgery. Screening for SDB might identify patients that are susceptible for a complicated postoperative course.",

There are two groups, divided into pre-educational group (group I) and post-educational group (group II) (n = 220/group). We also observed the adherence rate to VAP care bundles according to the educational program. The pretest and post-test to determine the effi cacy of the educational program were done. The VAP care bundles consisted of weaning according to weaning protocol, sedation vacation, headof-bed elevation, measurement of cuff pressures four times/day, 2% chlorhexidine use for mouth care and emptying of ventilator circuit condensate.",

See Tables 1 and 2 . Introduction Following our study of severe sepsis care across three centres [1] , we aimed to introduce a rapid feedback mechanism into our rolling audit programme. Whilst previous audits raised awareness of severe sepsis, only whole organisation performance was reported and no feedback was given to individual clinicians. It is recognised that such feedback loops can improve clinical practice [2] . Methods Patients admitted to critical care (58 beds, four units) with a primary admission diagnosis of infection were screened for severe sepsis. Pre-ICU care was then audited against the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines [3] . Time zero is defi ned as when criteria for severe sepsis were fi rst met. An individualised traffi c-light report was then generated and emailed to the patient's consultant and other stakeholders involved in care (Figure 1 ). We aimed to report cases within 7 days of critical care admission. A cumulative report is generated monthly to track organisation-wide performance.",

There is evidence that ward patients who become acutely unwell often receive suboptimal care [4] . A regional study commissioned by Norfolk, Suff olk & Cambridgeshire Critical Care Network (NSCCCN) found that a majority of ward patients may be of L1 dependency and death rates appear to be correlated with L1 status. We aim to examine the relationship between the ward distribution of illness acuity, staffi ng and patient outcome. Methods Data were collected as part of NSCCCN's observational prevalence study in 2010. Ward surveys included acuity of illness, staffi ng levels and skill mix. Secondary data were obtained from the Patient Administration System. Emergency, oncology, paediatric and maternity units were excluded. Results Complete datasets were obtained from 1,402 patients in 22 wards in our university hospital over two seasons. This constitutes 98.3% of inpatients from those wards. The mean ward occupancy rate was 94% (10th to 90th percentile: 85% to 100%). At least one L1 acuity criterion was scored by 898 (64%) patients, with 25% from geriatrics followed by orthopaedics (17%) and general surgery (10%). Each ward had an average of eight qualifi ed nursing staff (range: 4 to 12) equating to an average staff :patient ratio (SPr) of 0.253. There was no correlation between ward occupancy and nursing staff (Pearson correlation, corr: 0.55), nor between prevalence of L1 criteria and staffi ng (corr: 0.34). The admission rate to intensive care was noted to be higher if the patients were nursed in a ward with lower than average SPr compared with higher SPr (2.7% vs. 1.2%, P = 0.058 Fisher's exact), but this was not statistically signifi cant. Senior nursing (Band 6) staff were part of the skill mix on only nine of 44 ward surveys. Conclusion Better outcome with improved SPr may be unsurprising, although if proven conclusively would signifi cantly inform workforce planning. Lack of correlation between staffi ng levels and occupancy or acuity is also interesting given that we know L1 criteria are associated with worse outcome.",

ISQ was observed in 45% of physicians and 82% of nurses and nurses assistant (P <0.001). Sleep medication was used by 13.3% of the ICU team. Univariate analysis showed that ISQ was signifi cantly associated with sex (73% vs. 43%, P = 0.03 in women and men, respectively), marital status (84% vs. 61%, P = 0.01 in single and couple workers, respectively), more than 60 hours working in the last week (76% vs. 61%, P = 0.07) and less than 6 sleeping hours (95% vs. 54%, P <0.0001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that a sleep duration less than 6 hours was independently associated with ISQ (OR = 24.5; 95% CI = 5.2 to 115.8; P <0.0001). Furthermore, pathologic sleepiness was present in 59.3% of ICU workers. Sleepiness was independently associated with use of sleep medication (OR = 5.9; 95% CI = 1.2 to 28.5; P = 0.025). Conclusion The prevalence of ISQ and sleepiness is very high among ICU workers.

We compared the characteristics of those who survived ICU admission with those who failed to survive to discharge from ICU. The two populations were similar (age 51 vs. 57; males 59% vs. 57%). Those who survived had a lower APACHE II score on admission (19 vs. 23; P <0.001), lower mean organ failure scores (1 vs. 2; P <0.05), lower requirements of inotropes (26% vs. 50%; P = 0.001), ventilation (31% vs. 64%; P = 0.001) and fi ltration (11% vs. 26%; P = 0.004). There was no diff erence in the prevalence of sepsis at the time of admission (64% vs. 70%). Both groups included patients with prior bone marrow transplant (38% vs. 40%). Of note, ICU and 6-month survival were 27% and 50%, respectively. These values are lower than those reported in the literature to date.

Introduction Early detection of sepsis is important for a suffi cient treatment to reduce mortality. We hypothesized that using modifi ed systemic infl ammatory response syndrome criteria over 1 hour using an electronic software program facilitates the clinical diagnosis of sepsis. Methods After IRB approval and informed consent we enrolled in this prospective, observational, single-center study 1,119 consecutive patients (age 68.6 \u00b1 16.4, female/male 476/649) admitted over a 6-month period to a surgical ICU. A total 149 of them met modifi ed systemic infl ammatory response criteria. Patients were monitored by an electronic software program using live data from the laboratory and bedside monitors to detect modifi ed systemic infl ammatory response syndrome criteria persisting over 1 hour. The physicians were blinded to the software program alerts that notifi ed in real time when modifi ed systemic infl ammatory response syndrome criteria were detected and persisted over 1 hour, but did not provide treatment recommendations. Results There was a total of 149 modifi ed systemic infl ammatory response syndrome criteria alerts. Seventy-four were confi rmed as true sepsis cases by physicians. The overall incidence of sepsis was 7%. Patients were categorized into length of stay <24 hours, 24 to 96 hours and >96 hours. The overall sensitivity of our system for detecting sepsis was 68% and the specifi city was 91%. The positive predictive value is 34% and the negative predictive value is 98%. Conclusion Real-time alerts using an automated, electronic monitoring of modifi ed systemic infl ammatory response syndrome criteria facilitate the clinical diagnosis of sepsis. beds. Intentional rounds or proactive patient rounds were recognised by the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Nursing [1] as structured, evidence-based processes for nurses to carry out regular checks with individual patients at set intervals. The senior nursing team decided to adapt this initiative to the intensive care setting in order to address clinical challenges and provide guidance for shift leaders to focus on key elements of care. Methods Our intentional rounds, performed once per shift (twice daily), include two components. First, pressure area care -this component involves the shift leader checking whether key elements of pressure sore prevention have been performed. These include completion of the Waterlow risk assessment tool [2] , noting the frequency of repositioning, use of lateral positioning and pressure-relieving pads. Second, renal replacement therapy rates -this element was identifi ed as an area for focus after we established that our haemofi ltration fl uid use per hour of therapy was twice that of a near identical clinical setting. This pattern continued even after adopting similar therapy guidelines. The shift leader was guided to check whether therapy rates had been adjusted in line with latest biochemical results.",

Mean duration of handover was 391.3 (\u00b1 263.6) seconds, 78.5% were face to face and 1.26 (\u00b1 1.75) distractions per handover were noted, person-to-person calling being the commonest mode of distraction (46.7%). Nurses received training during induction in signifi cantly higher numbers, covered allied specialties more and reviewed the patients early (all P <0.05). Perception of the relative importance of diff erent components of the handover varied signifi cantly between donors, recipients, physicians and nurses. Both physicians and nurses seldom (39.7%) reviewed the available electronic past medical records of the patient before handover, which in addition to training in handover and overall confi dence level in the management following handover are signifi cantly associated with better satisfaction in univariate analysis; only the confi dence level in patient management remained signifi cant after multivariate analysis. However, agreement between donor and recipient on overall satisfaction was poor (P >0.05). Nursing handovers were signifi cantly longer than physicians' (572.08 \u00b1 214.68 vs. 168.6 \u00b1 97.27 seconds, P <0.001) but are also associated with higher distractions particularly during evening shifts. Conclusion A higher percentage of nurses received handover training; nursing handovers are longer and more inclusive of other components of patient management; perceived importance of components of handover varies among healthcare professionals; distractions are common during handovers and associated with longer duration, by nurses and in the evening shifts; and higher confi dence level in patient's management following the handover is associated with better satisfaction.",

The fi rst case involved a 15-month-old female with 40% TBSA from scald injury, where telemedicine was instrumental in the primary assessment as well as to arrange a direct assessment from a nearby burn surgeon. The second case resulted from a house fi re with multiple casualties, where physicians in Boston were able to utilize telemedicine to guide the initial resuscitation and airway management of three critically burned children, as well as to arrange for transport of one of the victims, an 11-year-old male with 87% TBSA, from Ukraine to the USA for acute management. Multiple diffi culties were overcome in implementing the system between the two countries including: time zone diff erences, language barrier, and diff erent approaches to patient care.

The purpose of this study was to analyze opinions of nurses about therapy restriction. We have examined with a multicenter study the opinions of the medical stuff about end-of-life care in Hungarian ICUs. Methods We performed a questionnaire evaluation among physicians and nurses of ICUs about infl uencing factors of therapy restriction, the method of the decision-making process, and the frequency of diff erent EOLD. The questionnaire, containing 21 questions, was delivered electronically to Hungarian ICUs, and then we analyzed the responses anonymously. The retrieved 302 answers (191 physicians, 102 nurses) were analysed using a nonparametric Student's test.",

Methods Medical Research Council guidance for complex interventions Phase 0 to I comprised literature review, theoretical modelling, observation and qualitative interviews and focus groups with staff and families exploring concerns and views of interventions identifi ed in the literature review. Phase II comprised intervention development, implementation and evaluation of tool feasibility and eff ects using staff survey, observation, audit of records and relative survey. Results Phase I: 47 staff and 24 family members were interviewed. The short time between decisions for treatment withdrawal and death, plus concerns for support management, communication and decision-making, highlighted a need to ensure excellent psychosocial assessment for all. Phase II: as part of integrated care guidelines, we developed the King's Psychosocial Assessment and Care tool (K-PACE). K-PACE is used for all patients entering the ICU, completed within 24 hours of admission. It contains psychosocial assessment of the family and patient needs, and identifi es key individuals for contact. Educational training was supported by K-PACE and was implemented in two waves. Post-implementation survey of 95 ICU staff found that most (80%) were aware of K-PACE. Eighty-two per cent of nurses but only 17% of doctors had completed the tool. In total, 158/213 (74%) family members responded to the survey (additionally three patients responded). There were high levels of satisfaction for symptom control and psychosocial care but concerns continued regarding explanation of treatment and care. Conclusion K-PACE is a feasible tool to improve the palliative care of patients and their families in the ICU.

Methods A questionnaire survey was performed on physicians and nurses in our medico-surgical ICU. The questionnaire consists of 11 questions with fi ve optional answers related to the thoughts of participants about treatment of hopeless or brain death patients. Concretely, the questions were; whether to withhold therapy or not, whether to accept to withdraw therapy or not and with family's will, whether to accept to immediately stop therapy and with family's will, whether to positively or not donate organs from a brain death patient, necessity of ICU care for brain death patients, and feeling guilty and stress for stopping or withdrawing therapy.

Cohort 2 underwent strength and physical functional assessments using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), a valid and reliable measure of physical function consisting of walking speed, balance, and repeated chair stands. It is a well-studied composite measure in older persons, but has not been used in ICU survivors. Small changes of 0.5 to 0.6 points in the SPPB have been shown to be clinically meaningful. Conclusion In this pilot study, early ICU rehabilitation was safe, and was associated with numerically although not statistically shorter hospital stay, greater strength and improved functional scores.

Blood cultures were obtained from all patients. The identifi cation and the antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed by the automated system VITEK2 (Bio Merieux, France). Data collected included underlying diseases, malignancies and immune suppression (MIS), prognostic factors (APACHE score, adjusted mortality), age, sex, length of ICU stay (LS), recent administration of broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (especially carbapenems; ABL), mechanical ventilation (MV), implementation of invasive procedures (central venous catheter and urine catheter; INV.PR) and outcome. At fi rst a univariate statistical model was used with signifi cance level set at P = 0.05. For the multivariate statistical analysis model we used all variables with P <0.05 from the previous model and those mentioned at recent medical literature as signifi cantly related with A. baum septicemia and its mortality. Results A total of 101 patients (10.78%) developed bloodstream infection caused by A. baum and the mortality rate due to A. baum septicemia was estimated as 49.5% (50/101). Multiple regression analysis revealed adjusted mortality >55% (Exp(B) = 2.01, P = 0.013), MIS (Exp(B) = 1.97, P = 0.017), ABL (Exp(B) = 2.34, P = 0.009), LS >14 days (Exp(B) = 1.34, P = 0.034), MV (Exp(B) = 2.67, P = 0.005) and INV.PR (Exp(B) = 3.27, P = 0.001) as independent risk factors associated with A. baum septicemia. Conclusion The fact that the probability of A. baum bacteremia increases in immunocompromised patients refl ects the opportunistic characteristic of these infections. MV accelerates respiratory A. baum colonization, which is a risk factor for AB bacteremia. Recent INV. PR increased the incidence of A. baum bacteremia and this result is probably related to the severe status in patients with central venous catheter. The administration of carbapenems inhibits the growth of other more susceptible bacteria, allowing the growth of multidrugresistant A. baum. References",

Collection of airfl ow signal and calibration was performed with a standard 3 l syringe with fl ow volume measurement on one adult subject. Results Calibration of the assembled device over range of 0.5 to 3 l/ second enabled conversion of pressure diff erence to air fl ow with a mean measured tube resistance of 0.258 (kPa*second)/l. Robust signal responses to an adult subject's continuous respiratory maneuvers on the tube itself were demonstrated. Subject performance of the pMDI technique with subsequent tidal volume breathing was recorded and analyzed (Figure 1). Conclusion Design and calibration of a novel low-cost monitoring device for bronchodilator delivery monitoring enabled detection and recording of characteristic fl ow volume respiratory patterns for point-of-care diagnostics in resource-limited settings. Future work will require clinical testing and automated detection of the correct pMDI patient technique.References 1. Ari A, et al.: Respir Care 2012, 57:613-626. 2.

Arrhythmic patients (atrial fi brillation 88%, frequent extrasystoles 7%, fl utter 5%) were similar (P >0.3) to patients in regular rhythm for MAP (median 74 (IQR 67 to 80) vs. 75 (69 to 84) mmHg), SAPS II score, BMI, arm circumference, norepinephrine administration (36% vs. 35%), mechanical ventilation (80% vs. 81%), and site of the intraarterial catheter (radial artery: 80% vs. 85%). Between arrhythmic and regular rhythm patients: the agreement (Bland-Altman analysis) between invasive and brachial cuff measurements of MAP was similar (mean bias -0.4 \u00b1 7.2 (limits of agreement -14/14) mmHg vs. 3.0 \u00b1 8.2 (-13/19) mmHg, respectively); the detection of hypotension (invasive MAP <65 mmHg) by the brachial cuff was of similar reliability (area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.91 (95% CI = 0.80 to 0.97) vs. AUC = 0.98 (0.89 to 1), P = 0.2); and the detection of a response (>10% increase in MAP) to therapy was of similar reliability (AUC = 1 (0.85 to 1) (n = 22) vs. AUC = 0.99 (0.78 to 1) (n = 17), P = 0.5).

Methods Clinical examination was performed, which included 99 patients with polytrauma according to sepsis syndrome: SIRS (n = 18), local infection (n = 36), sepsis (n = 27), severe sepsis (n = 12), septic shock (n = 6) to the criteria of \u0410\u0421\u0421\u0420/S\u0421\u0421\u041c. The microorganism identifi cation was performed using iEMS Reader MF (Labsystems) with the La Chema multimicrotests. The content of LBP in blood serum was assessed with IMMULITE ONE (USA) with the reagents DPC (USA). Statistical analysis of the data was performed with Statistica 6.0. The numerical characteristics of variables are presented as Me (LQ to UQ). The analysis of diff erences was carried with the Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparison of independent groups, with Friedman one-way analysis of variance. The diff erences were statistically signifi cant with P <0.05. Results In 81% of the critically ill patients with polytrauma the posttraumatic period was accompanied with development of infectious complications, Gram-negative (K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., E. coli) and Gram-positive (S. Epidermidis, S. aureus). Sepsis was diagnosed on 8 to 10 days in 45% of the patients. The signifi cant increase of LPS-BP was found in the fi rst 3 days of the follow-up, compared with the control values (6.7 times higher in SIRS group (\u03c7 2 (n = 18, df = 3) = 52.8666, P <0.001); 9.9 times higher in the group with local infection (\u03c7 2 (n = 36, df = 3) = 91.6629, P <0.001); 15.2 times higher in the sepsis group; 20.5 times higher in the severe sepsis group; 47.3 times higher in the septic shock group (\u03c7 2 (n = 6, df = 3) = 11.0339, P = 0.0115)), whereas the fi rst positive results of the microbiological examination were obtained only on 5 to 7 days. The diagnostic sensitivity of threshold concentration of LBP in blood serum (335 mkg/ml) was 84%, diagnostic specifi city was 88% (ROC curve: 0.88). Conclusion The high incidence of the diagnostic levels of LBP in blood serum in patients with sepsis in the early term, before microbiological confi rmation of infection, allows one to use this parameter as an early marker of development of purulent septic complications conditioned by Gram-negative microfl ora.P292 Risk factors for the development of complications following blunt chest trauma: a new risk stratifi cation tool C Battle 1 , H Hutchings 2 , S Lovett 2 , P Evans 2 1 Morriston Hospital, ABMU Health Board, Swansea, UK; 2 Swansea University, Swansea, UK Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P292 (doi: 10.1186/cc12230)Introduction The aim of the study was to investigate the risk factors for the development of complications following blunt chest trauma and to develop a risk stratifi cation tool to assist in the management of this patient group. The diffi culties in the management of this patient group in the emergency department (ED) due to the development of late complications are well recognised in the literature[1]. Methods Between 2009 and 2011 a total of 276 patients were admitted to hospital from the ED of a regional trauma centre in Wales, with the primary diagnosis of blunt chest trauma. Patients with immediate lifethreatening injuries were excluded. Data were collected retrospectively and included risk factors (age, number of rib fractures, comorbidity, pre-injury anticoagulant use, smoking status, oxygen saturations and respiratory rate on initial assessment in the ED), and outcomes (mortality, any pulmonary morbidity, length of stay of 7 days or more and need for ICU admission). Development of complications was defi ned as the occurrence of one or more of the outcomes investigated. Multivariable logistic regression using fractional polynomials was used to identify risk factors and develop a risk stratifi cation tool. The signifi cant risk factors in the model were selected using backward elimination with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) at a signifi cance level of 0.05. The c index and the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test were calculated to assess discrimination and calibration of the risk stratifi cation tool respectively. Results A total of 161 patients out of the 276 admitted developed complications following blunt chest trauma. Implementation of backward elimination using AIC values resulted in a fi nal model based on the signifi cant risk factors; age, oxygen saturations, number of rib fractures, presence of chronic lung disease and pre-injury anticoagulant use (all P <0.05). The c index for the tool was 0.80 and the H-L score was 9.22 (P = 0.32), indicating good predictive capabilities of the tool.",

DCI pathogenesis is multifactorial and not completely understood, but vasospasm plays a central role. Transcranial colorcoded duplex sonography (TCCDS) is a non-invasive bedside tool to explore cerebral vessels, but specifi city is still suboptimal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the proximal-distal gradient of mean cerebral blood fl ow velocity (CBF-V) in middle cerebral artery (MCA) as a possible indicator of critical vasospasm. Methods Consecutive aSAH patients (WFNS 1 to 5, age 18 to 80 years) admitted to NeuroICU between November 2011 and September 2012 were included in this study. TCCDS was used to assess CBF-V in MCA of both sides: we defi ned TCCDS vasospasm as CBF-V >120 cm/second. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA, 3D TOF HR) was performed to evaluate vasospasm at early (<3 days) and delayed (7 to 10 days) time points. When patients underwent MRA, in the same clinical conditions, we recorded CBF-V with TCCDS at two levels: at the origin (proximal CBF-V) and at the end (distal CBF-V) of the MCA. Then we calculated the absolute value of proximal-distal CBF-V gradient for MCA of both sides. We defi ned clinical vasospasm as the appearance of a new neurological defi cit confi rmed by imaging. The relationships between the absolute value of TCCDS CBF-V gradient and (1) TCCDS vasospasm, (2) MRA vasospasm and (3) clinical vasospasm were explored.",

The aim of this study was to map pre-procedural variables at the insertion of a central venous catheter and to investigate whether any independent variable could be identifi ed as an independent risk factor for bleeding complications associated with insertion of central venous catheters. Methods In this retrospective study, we investigated 1,737 consecutive insertions of central venous catheters on 1,444 patients in a large university hospital during 2009 to 2010. Pre-procedural coagulation status, blood component use, type of catheter, insertion site, and complications during insertion were recorded and compared with bleeding complications documented in electronic charts. Results No serious bleeding complications were recorded in connection with the insertions of central venous catheters. Sixteen out of 1,769 (0.9%) insertions caused grade 2 bleeding, being defi ned as a bleeding requiring prolonged compression at the insertion site. Insertion of a large-bore central dialysis catheter was found to be an independent risk factor for bleeding complications. Neither conventional coagulation tests nor accidental arterial puncture or the number of needle passes could predict bleeding complications in this study. Conclusion This retrospective study shows that serious bleeding complications in association with central line insertion are uncommon and that insertion of dialysis catheter is an independent risk factor for mild bleeding complications. Coagulopathy, measured with conventional coagulation tests, is not an independent risk factor for bleeding complication at insertion of central venous catheters.P359 Effi cacy of tranexamic acid in decreasing blood loss during cesarean section V Zaporozhan, O Tarabrin, D Gavrychenko, G Mazurenko, O Saleh, I Lyoshenko Odessa National Medical University, Odessa, Ukraine Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P359 (doi: 10.1186/cc12297) Introduction Despite signifi cant progress in obstetric care, the problem of bleeding during labor remains unsolved.

To understand the economic impact, a model was developed to assess the cost of diff erences in catheter-related bloodstream infections (BSI) in ICUs based on either closed or open albumin systems. Methods A model was developed with the aim of showing the economic consequences of diff erences between intravenous (i.v.) infusions of albumin via open or closed infusion containers. The model took a healthcare perspective in the UK. The impact of central venous catheter-related BSI was evaluated.The model took diff erences in BSI rates and the associated cost consequences for the hospital into account. The model bases on the evidence that closed system delivery helps to reduce the risk of external contamination, which decreases the BSI rate and reduces overall mortality[1][2][3]. We assessed the total costs using public list prices and literature. The model assumes that infection rates for using open and closed albumin delivery systems are similar to any other closed or open nonalbumin i.v. fl uid delivery system used in the ICU. The model looks at reduction in central-line-associated BSI and the potential cost saving of this reduction. Results The economic model shows the potential cost saving by switching from open to closed albumin administration systems. It is measured in occurrence of BSI in the ICU, estimated occurrence of BSI in the albumin population and incidence of overall mortality in the ICU and cost of BSI per albumin patient. Finally, the model describes the potential cost savings by switching to a closed system. Using closed albumin delivery systems may overall provide a cost saving for the hospital and healthcare sector. Assuming 800 patients treated in an ICU per year with all in all 4,800 ml albumin, the total annual cost saving would be \u00a324,000 switching from open to closed albumin infusions. Conclusion Switching from an open to a closed albumin infusion system may result in a reduction in the risk of external contamination, resulting in less infection and may provide a cost saving for the healthcare system.",

The aim of this study was to fi nd a new approach from the impact of ARDS in an ICU and to analyze APACHE II score, days of mechanical ventilation (MV), duration of ARDS and mortality. Methods We analyzed the database of our ICU collected prospectively from October 2008 to January 2011 and regarded all patients undergoing MV for 48 hours or more and who met the AECC criteria. All patients were ventilated according to the ARDSNet protocol. Conclusion In this new approach of our ARDS patients we found no statistically signifi cant diff erences in relation to the variables of interest to analyze in the two groups. Patients with severe ARDS who survive ICU admission have a longer duration of ARDS, which means more days on MV and therefore increased ICU stay. Reference",

Comparative results between auto ARDSNet protocol and auto open lung managementIntroduction The injury of alveolar epithelium and endothelium is the basis of pathogenesis for the early stage of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A prompt detection of this injury will provide us with a possibility for early ARDS diagnosis and treatment. Currently no biomarkers of alveolar epithelial injury are clinically available. The purpose of our study was to investigate the role of surfactant protein D (SPD) and Clara cell protein (CCP) as biomarkers of early ARDS.Introduction Emulsifi ed perfl uorocarbons (PFC) are synthetic hydrocarbons that can carry 50 times more oxygen than human plasma. Their properties may be advantageous in applications requiring preservation of tissue viability in oxygen-deprived states[1,2], making them a potential candidate for combat and civilian prehospital resuscitation. Our hypothesis is that an intravenous dose of PFC increases vital organ tissue oxygenation, improves survival after hemorrhagic shock (HS) and may reduce or prevent the development of ventilator-associated ARDS. Here we report data from the fi rst part (HS only) of a multiphase swine study to study the benefi ts of PFC in treating HS and preventing ARDS. This initial study was designed to ensure safe use of PFC in traumatized animals. Conclusion There was no signifi cant diff erence in survival time, MAP and MPAP in the PFC group compared with HES control. These data suggest that it is safe to administer in this HS model. Regulatory approval of hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers has been halted due to possible side eff ects related to vasoconstriction. In this model, and with this class of oxygen-carrying drugs (PFCs), we did not observe evidence of vasoconstriction. Using PFCs did not result in a survival advantage here; however, there was also no observation of adverse events.

This can be attributed to the increase of the airway pressures, which results in preload decrease and afterload increase of the right ventricle and cardiac contractility attenuation. Nevertheless, these eff ects are transient and reversible and RM application is a safe technique for the management of intraoperative hypoxemia, provided that adequate cardiac preload is ensured and the anesthesiologist is alert to discontinue the RM if it exceeds cardiovascular reserves.ConclusionThe recruitment manoeuvre can compromise left diastolic fi lling by increasing the transpulmonary pressure. In patients with diastolic dysfunction a signifi cant decrease in SV can be observed during the recruitment manoeuvre with no compensatory mechanisms evoked determining a signifi cant decrease in CO. The E/A ratio is not able to discriminate between the two groups, confi rming the power of tissue Doppler imaging to recognize the correct diastolic pattern.Reference 1.

Methods A prospective, observational and descriptive study was carried out in all patients admitted to an ICU from October 2008 to June 2011. Inhalation injury was defi ned with two or more of the following criteria: history of injury in an enclosed space, facial burns with singed nasal hair, carbonaceus sputum or stridor. If they were intubated it was diagnosed by bronchoscopy. Demographic data, length of stay, ABSI, APACHE II, duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital course and mortality data were collected. Data are presented as number and percentage or as median and interquartile range and were analyzed with the Fisher exact test and Mann-Whitney test.Introduction Intrapulmonary percussive ventilation (IPV) is a therapy that is used to clear endobronchial secretions. The IPV ventilator was designed and developed by FM Bird in 1979. The ventilator consists of a phasitron that delivers rapid, high-fl ow, mini bursts of oxygen, mixed with air. The potential aims of this mechanism are pulmonary recruitment, improved mucus clearance with a direct high-frequency oscillatory eff ect. We investigated whether IPV has a positive eff ect on ventilatory values in adult patients on the ICU. diff erent time points. Paired Student t tests were performed in order to compare the values immediately before IPV, with directly after therapy and 15 minutes later. P <0.05 was considered signifi cant. of HFO-TGI ventilation. PULSION PICCOplus v7.0 was used for hemodynamic measurements including the ELWI.Results Oxygenation (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) improved signifi cantly with HFO-TGI compared with CMV (125.5 \u00b1 54.7 vs. 195.6 \u00b1 108.7, P <0.001). Changes in PaO 2 /FiO 2 were positively correlated with ELWI at baseline (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.56, P = 0.016). See Figure 1. There were no signifi cant changes in patients' fl uid balance and hemodynamics including the ELWI. Conclusion Estimation of the ELWI can help to predict the oxygenation response of ARDS patients considered for HFO-TGI ventilation. The possibility that HFO-TGI exerts an eff ect on pulmonary oedema needs further investigation.

BLIND) and then given (OPEN) access to the NAVIGATOR display. Recommendations for therapeutic interventions were noted. Agreement (maximum two steps deviation for each assessment between staff ; number of patients), disagreement (median and interquartile range of steps) and therapeutic agreement (intervention/s to change Eh, Pms and SVR in similar direction/s, number of patients) were recorded and analysed for statistical diff erence BLIND versus OPEN (Fisher's exact test, Mann-Whitney test, P <0.05). Results Eh was commonly overestimated, Pms commonly underestimated with no clear trend for SVR. Agreement amongst all categories of staff increased and disagreement score decreased for Eh, Pms and SVR(Table 1)comparing BLIND versus OPEN assessments. Agreement for therapeutic interventions also increased signifi cantly from 4/20 (BLIND) to 18/20 patients (OPEN).ConclusionThe assessment of heart function, intravascular fi lling and resistance state in postoperative cardiac patients was made signifi cantly more consistent amongst diff erent ICU staff members using the NAVIGATOR haemodynamic monitor. Such enhanced consistency could potentially make the haemodynamic management more eff ective with improved clinical outcomes.P200 Volume quantifi cation by contrast-enhanced ultrasound and thermodilution: an in vitro comparison IH Herold 1 , G Russo 2 , HC Van Assen 2 , HH Korsten 1 , M Mischi 2 1 Catharina Ziekenhuis Eindhoven, the Netherlands; 2 University of Technology, Eindhoven, the Netherlands Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P200 (doi: 10.1186/cc12138)",

A recent study demonstrated that pulse pressure variation (PPV) \u226516% has provided an accurate method for predicting fl uid responsiveness in pediatric congenital heart surgery. We aimed to compare PPV and respiratory systolic, diastolic and pulse transit time interval variation (STV, DTV and PTTV, respectively) as predictors of fl uid responsiveness during pediatric liver transplantation. Methods A total of 61 data from 16 pediatric patients, median age 5.4 years (range 0.1 to 9 years), were retrospectively evaluated from electrically recorded radial arterial and central venous pressure (CVP) waveform. The time from the onset of systolic upstroke to the dicrotic notch was defi ned as the systolic time interval (STI), and the time from dicrotic notch to the beginning of systolic upstroke was defi ned as the diastolic time interval (DTI). The time from peak R wave on electrocardiography to the onset of systolic upstroke was defi ned as the pulse transit time (PTT) interval. STV was calculated by averaging of three consecutive respiratory cycles with the following: (STI maximum -STI minimum ) / STI mean . The same method was used for calculating DTV, PTTV and PPV. STV, DTV and PTTV were corrected by cardiac period. Averaged CVP was used as a static preload index. PPV threshold \u226516% was used to discriminate fl uid responsiveness. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Pearson's correlation analysis were used for the comparison. Conclusion This study shows that STV, DTV and PTTV can be used as a surrogate for PPV \u226516%, suggesting that this novel method can be used to predict hemodynamic response during pediatric surgery.Reference 1.

Patients with ileostomies off er a unique access to the intestinal microcirculation. To date, no reference ranges for standard microcirculatory parameters of the gut are available. Therefore, the aim of our study was to establish a database for postoperative microcirculatory parameters for ileostomies. Methods For this observational prospective cohort study 77 patients were screened. In total, 165 SDF measurements could be obtained. All patients included had bowel surgery for chronic infl ammatory bowel disease or intestinal malignancies and received an ileostomy. Patients were excluded if they had signs of local infection or bleeding, or if they were admitted to the ICU for sepsis or perioperative complications. The SDF device was gently inserted into the stoma at a depth of 3 to 4 cm, and fi ve real-time images were recorded. All videos recorded were analyzed offl ine using AVA\u00ae software (Microvision Medical, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). The following parameters were quantifi ed: microvascular fl ow index (MFI), total vessel density (TVD), perfused vessel density (PVD), and proportion of perfused vessels (PPV). Patients were followed for 3 days post surgery with fi ve images captured every day. Results We were able to capture clear images of the small intestine microvasculature. Distinct villi were visible with a dense network of microvessels (diameter: 6 to 17 \u03bcm). Mean TVD (\u00b1 2SD) was 19Patients' age, sex and comorbidity had no signifi cant impact on postoperative microvascular parameters. No signifi cant changes of the microvascular parameters were observed during the fi rst 3 postoperative days.Conclusion SDF imaging is a feasible, non-invasive bedside method to study the postoperative intestinal microcirculation. The established reference ranges are useful for early detection of postoperative local complications and studies of microcirculatory changes induced by systemic pathologies; for example, in sepsis.Introduction Tissue capnometry has been used to assess organ perfusion but it is not generally available at the bedside[1,2]. Our aim was to test a new sublingual capillary tonometer in haemorrhagic shock. Methods Thirty-six mini-pigs were anaesthetised, ventilated and divided into sham operated and shock groups. Instrumentation included: intestinal and sublingual tonometry, haemodynamic monitoring (PiCCO; Pulsion, Germany) and orthogonal polarization spectroscopy (OPS). After baseline measurements (T0) haemorrhagic shock was induced and maintained by reducing mean arterial pressure (MAP) to ~40 mmHg for 60 minutes. Measurements were repeated every 30 minutes (T1 to T6). Fluid resuscitation started after T2 aiming to increase MAP to 75% of the baseline value. OPS imaging was performed at T0, T2 and T6. Data are presented as the median (interquartile range), for statistical analysis Friedmann ANOVA, Mann-Whitney and Spearman tests were used as appropriate. Results Bleeding resulted in a signifi cant decrease in MAP and cardiac index, and an increase in heart rate. Macrohaemodynamic changes were accompanied by signifi cant changes in red blood cell velocity (RBCV) and a signifi cant increase in the intestinal and sublingual mucosal-to-arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure diff erence (PCO 2 There was signifi cant correlation between RBCV and PCO 2 gap in sublingual and intestinal regions alike: r = -0.58; r = -0.71, P <0.0001, respectively. Conclusion In this model of haemorrhagic shock, sublingual PCO 2 gap showed good correlation with RBCV, suggesting that this new sublingual capillary tonometer may be an appropriate tool for monitoring microcirculation at the bedside.

The PBR and perfused vessel density showed a good correlation (r = -0.65; P = 0.002), demonstrating loss of perfused vascular density when the glycocalyx is damaged. Conclusion The glycocalyx is damaged after initiation of CPB, and restoration is impaired after exposure to nonpulsatile fl ow during the use of the heart-lung machine. A reduction in glycocalyx thickness, represented by an increased PBR, correlates with impairment of perfused microvascular vessel density.

The microcirculation is also aff ected by age and chronic comorbidities. However, the eff ect of these conditions on SDF microcirculatory parameters has not been well described. Methods Sublingual SDF images were obtained from fi ve groups of 20 participants: healthy volunteers under 25 years, healthy volunteers over 55 years, and stable patients over 55 years with one of diabetes mellitus (DM), cirrhosis and stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Microcirculatory parameters[1]  between the groups were then compared for signifi cance using ANOVA for parametric data and the Kruskal-Wallis test for nonparametric data. This was approved by the local ethics committee. Results All DM patients were type 2, with mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 8.8% (SD 1.7%). Seventeen cirrhotic patients were Child-Pugh-Turcotte score A and one was score B. For CKD, the mean estimated glomerular fi ltration rate was 11.5 ml/minute (SD 2.9). ) for those with CKD (P for diff erence = 0.14). There were no signifi cant diff erences in the proportion of perfused vessels and perfused vessel density between the groups. SeeFigure 1.

Only TERLI restored baseline values of CPP (from 54 to 61 mmHg) and did not change the cerebral expression of AQP4 (100 \u00b1 6% of sham), NKCC1 (100 \u00b1 1% of sham), Bax (102 \u00b1 6% of sham) and TBARS. Both TERLI and LR recovered baseline levels of PbtO 2 (TERLI from 30.0 to 34.2 mmHg; LR from 29.4 to 40.7 mmHg) and MAP (TERLI from 53 to 64 mmHg; LR: 48 to 61 mmHg). Blood lactate levels were not recovered in any group (TERLI from 5.7 to 8.1 mmol/l; LR from 4.5 to 7.7 mmol/l). Conclusion TERLI recovered cerebral perfusion and oxygenation with no signifi cant changes in ICP and cerebral markers of oedema, apoptosis and oxidative stress. LR did not recover CPP probably due to a signifi cant increase in ICP caused by brain oedema, which may have contributed to the cerebral apoptosis. None of the treatments caused cerebral oxidative stress. References Introduction The shock index (SI) is an easy-to-use clinical tool that rapidly identifi es patients at risk of haemodynamic decompensation. Previous studies focused primarily on patients suff ering from pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, ruptured ectopic pregnancy and traumatic haemorrhagic shock. Modifi ed SIs have also been studied. Could the SI be accurate in patients suff ering from gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage? The aim of this study was to compare the performance of the SI with various modifi ed SIs and conventional vital signs in predicting 30-day mortality in a population of patients with a GI haemorrhage. Methods A single-center post-hoc analysis was conducted of prospectively collected data from patients diagnosed with a GI haemorrhage episode in an academic emergency department (ED) from March 2008 to December 2011. Data were extracted from two databases used at our ED. The SI (pulse/systolic blood pressure) and nine modifi ed SIs were calculated from the available fi rst documented vital signs. ROC curves were used to determine sensitivity and specifi city of the diff erent SIs in predicting 30-day mortality. Results Of the 770 patients included in the analysis, 52 died within 30 days. The standard SI at a cutoff point of 0.7 had the highest predictability and sensitivity of 30-day mortality (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.7, sensitivity = 0.79, specifi city = 0.56). In comparison, one of the modifi ed SIs (pulse/diastolic blood pressure) had 0.65 sensitivity and 0.71 specifi city (AUC = 0.73). A heart rate >100 bpm predicted 30day mortality with 0.40 sensitivity and 0.82 specifi city (AUC = 0.63). Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the fi rst study to examine the relationship between the SI and mortality in patients with a GI haemorrhage. It appears that the standard SI, when compared with various modifi ed SIs and conventional vital signs, had the highest combined predictability and sensitivity of 30-day mortality in a population of patients suff ering from GI haemorrhage. Further prospective studies are needed to confi rm these fi ndings.",

The use of these devices has been limited typically to hospitals with a cardiac surgery service. The aim of this study is to describe the management of patients with an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) in our second-level institution. Methods An observational study that includes all patients with IABP in our hospital from January 2010 to September 2012, followed to November 2012. Epidemiological and clinical variables as an indication of IABP, therapeutic management and outcome were collected. Because of the small size sample, statistical analysis was limited to descriptive parameters. cardiac arrest (n = 2, 11.8%). The indications of IABP were refractory cardiogenic shock (n = 12, 70.6%), high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 2, 11.8%), refractory angina (n = 1, 5.9%), refractory pulmonary edema (n = 1, 5.9%) and electrical storm (n = 1, 5.9%). Five IABPs (27.4%) were inserted in the ICU and the rest in the catheterization laboratory. Six patients (35.3%) suff ered a cardiac arrest prior to hemodynamic stabilization. Three patients (17.6%, the electrical storm and the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest) died before coronary catheterization was performed and the other three were treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia. Thirteen patients (76.5%) needed invasive mechanical ventilation. In six patients (35.3%) invasive hemodynamic monitoring was performed (one pulmonary artery catheter, fi ve PICCO). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in all patients and transesophageal in six (35.3%). Six of the patients (35.3%) were transferred to the reference centre for immediate coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). No complications were reported during the transfer. During the ICU stay, femoral artery pseudoaneurysm was reported in one of the patients and inguinal hematoma after IABP withdrawal in two (no transfusion required). Four patients (27.4%) died because of refractory cardiogenic shock despite revascularization. The length of mechanical support was 1.67 \u00b1 1.5 days (0 to 6). Conclusion In our hospital the IABP was mainly used in refractory cardiogenic shock because of myocardial ischemia, with an all-cause mortality of 41.2%. Low rates of complications were observed. Transfer of patients with IABP was performed safely.P224 Impact of left ventricular ejection fraction and elevated fi lling pressures on mortality in mechanically ventilated patients in severe sepsis or septic shock S Gillespie, J Pulido Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P224 (doi: 10.1186/cc12162)Introduction Myocardial dysfunction in septic shock is common and the presentation is broad. There are confl icting data regarding the prognostic implications of low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and elevated E/e' ratio on mortality in this patient population. We sought to assess the impact of LV dysfunction and elevated E/e' ratio on 30day mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Methods Fifty-eight mechanically ventilated patients with severe sepsis or septic shock admitted from 1 August 2007 to 31 January 2009 were prospectively evaluated with transthoracic echocardiogram within 24 hours of admission. Left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed using the modifi ed Simpson method as recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography. Normal LV function was defi ned as LVEF 40%. Mitral infl ow pulsed wave Doppler of peak E waves and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of the septal mitral annulus peak velocities were measured, the E/e' ratio was obtained. Elevated LV fi lling pressures was defi ned as E/e' >15. Results All cause 30-day mortality was 50% (n = 29). Forty-six patients (79%) had normal LV function. Forty-four (76%) patients had normal LV fi lling pressures. Patients who survived had lower E/e' ratio, (median E/e' 10.6 \u00b1 4 vs. 13.6 \u00b1 7, P = 0.1) but this was not statistically signifi cant. However, when defi ned as E/e' >15, the mortality was 71%. On the contrary, patients with low LVEF had a mortality of 41% and LVEF was no diff erent between survivors and nonsurvivors (55 \u00b1 16 vs. 58 \u00b1 14, P = 0.34). Conclusion Myocardial dysfunction is a well-known entity in patients with septic shock. The clinical spectrum of this entity is broad, including LV, RV and diastolic dysfunction. Although the E/e' ratio has been a known prognostic indicator in other cardiac conditions, its role in these patients is less clear. This study demonstrated that when septal mitral annulus E/e' was >15, it was a better marker for mortality than LVEF in mechanically ventilated patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Larger studies incorporating diastolic evaluation and TDI should be performed to further clarify this fi nding.Introduction In our busy emergency departments the identifi cation of patients at risk of rapid hemodynamic decompensation is crucial. The shock index (SI) (pulse/systolic blood pressure) is a non-invasive clinical sign associated with more complications if higher than 0.7. The eff ect of \u03b2-blockers (BB) and calcium channel blockers (CCB) on the SI has not yet been described. Most studies excluded these patients, owing to the medications' eff ect on the cardiac pulse. Considering that BB and CCB are commonly prescribed, we studied their eff ect on the SI's predictability on 30-day mortality in a urosepsis population. Methods This single-center post-hoc analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted in an academic Canadian emergency department (ED) between March 2008 and February 2011. Data were extracted from two institutional databases. We included patients with a fi nal diagnosis of urosepsis, sepsis, pyelonephritis and urinary tract infection. Selected patients also had a documented positive urine culture. The SI predictability on 30-day mortality was calculated for patients taking BB and/or CCB as well as patients taking none of these medications. Sensitivity and specifi city were determined using ROC curves. t tests were used to compare mean SI between both groups. Results Our urosepsis population contained 364 patients, of which 129 (35.4%) were either using a BB, a CCB or both before their admission. Mean age was 74.9 years and 48.1% of the patients were women. A total of 36 patients died (9.9%) in a 30-day period. The group taking either BB or CCB had a signifi cantly lower mean SI (0.76, 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.81 vs. 0.93, 95% CI: 0.89 to 0.98, P <0.0001). In our urosepsis population, a SI of 0.7 had a sensitivity of 0.76 and a specifi city of 0.27 (area under the curve (AUC): 0.596) for patients taking neither BB nor CCB. In the group taking either or both medications, a SI of 0.7 had a sensitivity of 0.57 and a specifi city of 0.42 (AUC: 0.578). In both groups, lowering the SI to 0.5 increased the sensitivity to more than 0.95 but lowered specifi city signifi cantly. Conclusion To our knowledge this is the only study analysing the eff ect of BB and CCB on the SI predictability of 30-day mortality. Our results indicate that SI cannot be used to accurately predict mortality with patients suff ering from urosepsis. In both our groups, SI performance was poor, as shown by the ROC curves. BB or CCB did not infl uence these results.Introduction Levosimendan improves haemodynamic performance and may have cardioprotective eff ects. Small trials have demonstrated effi cacy in well-defi ned populations[1]. Given the uncertain benefi ts we describe contemporaneous patient selection, utilisation of levosimedan, haemodynamic eff ects and outcomes. Methods The study was performed at a single centre's three ICUs. Data from 38 consecutive admissions, from 2010 to 2012, treated with levosimendan were collected retrospectively. Demographics, illness severity, comorbidity, haemodynamic, metabolic, biochemical, resource utilisation, organ support and hospital outcomes were analysed. Results Our cohort had a mean age of 58 (95% CI = 53.4 to 64.4). Only 18% underwent cardiothoracic surgery: sepsis, pulmonary emboli and myocardial/pericardial diseases were also treated with levosimendan. resulted in improved CI and PFR with reductions in EVLW, BE, lactate and creatinine. The ICU length of stay was 15.4 days (95% CI = 13.2 to 17.6) and the hospital mortality was 54%. No signifi cant adverse eff ects were reported. Conclusion Levosimendan is usually used in patients with cardiogenic shock unresponsive to conventional inotropes or mechanical augmentation. The mortality of this group is high but represents patients with shock refractory to conventional treatment. Its use in sepsis, myocarditis and pulmonary embolism is not well established. In this group levosimendan appears to have a favourable eff ect on gas exchange, renal function and tissue perfusion. Limitations include retrospective analysis and missing data.Reference 1.

It is characterized by transient ballooning modifi cation of the left ventricular apex, probably due to neurogenic stimuli resulting in low cardiac output syndrome. The aim of this prospective randomized study was to evaluate, by serial transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), what is the best drug treatment between levosimendan and dobutamine to restore a satisfactory cardiac function in the case of low cardiac output. Methods Twelve adult patients, aged 18 years, were admitted to the ICU with Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy at entrance. The patients were divided randomly into two groups: levosimendan (six patients) treated with levosimendan and standard treatment, and the control group (six patients) with dobutamine and standard treatment. In all patients, serial TEE was performed studying the systolic function, by ejection fraction of the left ventricle with Simpson's method. The TEEs were performed at the entrance of the patient, after 12 and 24 hours of treatment. The results were expressed as mean with standard deviation. For the comparison between the two groups we used the Fisher test, considered signifi cant with P <0.05.",

Crit Care Med 2012, 40:634-646.Introduction Dobutamine and levosimendan improve cardiac contractility in patients with heart failure, septic cardiomyopathy or cardiac surgery. Tachycardia in these cases is undesired because of aggravating ischemia. Ivabradine, a selective sinus node inhibitor, does not aff ect contractility. A combination of ivabradine with positive inotropic drugs might be favorable. Thus, we compared the cardiac eff ects of dobutamine or levosimendan alone, and combined with ivabradine using the Langendorff method of isolated perfused hearts. Methods Isolated guinea pig hearts (n = 37) were perfused with incremental doses of dobutamine (10 nM to 10 \u03bcM) or levosimendan (30 nM to 10 \u03bcM) either alone or combined with 3 \u03bcM ivabradine. Heart rate (HR), left ventricular pressures, contractility (+dLVP/dt) and relaxation (-dLVP/dt) were recorded. Data for each drug (dobutamine or levosimendan) were analyzed by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures including the two main eff ects of ivabradine and drug dose and their interaction. Data are reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Results Ivabradine decreased the HR from 223 \u00b1 18 to 196 \u00b1 15 bpm (P <0.05). Contractility and relaxation remained unchanged. Ivabradine reduced the positive chronotropic eff ect at all doses of dobutamine (10 nM: 232 \u00b1 37 vs. 187 \u00b1 19, 100 nM: 265 \u00b1 37 vs. 903 \u00b1 752 vs. -2,972 \u00b1 967 mmHg/second; P <0.05). Levosimendan increased the HR only at high doses. With ivabradine, no positive chronotropic eff ect of levosimendan was observed (100 nM: 185 \u00b1 30 vs. 162 \u00b1 22, 1 \u03bcM: 208 \u00b1 28 vs. 166 \u00b1 29, 10 \u03bcM: 242 \u00b1 27 vs. 168 \u00b1 36 bpm; P <0.05). Ivabradine attenuated the positive inotropic eff ect of levosimendan (100 nM: 2,303 \u00b1 303 vs. 1,737 \u00b1 262, 1 \u03bcM: 2,977 \u00b1 481 vs. 1,940 \u00b1 449, 10 \u03bcM: 3,480 \u00b1 941 vs. 2,189 \u00b1 542 mmHg/ second; P <0.05) but did not signifi cantly alter its lusitropic eff ect. Conclusion Addition of ivabradine to dobutamine attenuates its chronotropic actions without diminishing its inotropic eff ects. A combination of levosimendan with ivabradine does not seem to provide benefi t.

The UK Royal College of Anaesthetists has defi ned auditable standards for the care of patients and the training of escorting medical and nursing staff in this context[1]. Methods Patients in a 27-bed combined general and neurosurgical critical care unit were studied in January 2011 and May 2012. Patients undergoing radiology department imaging or intervention were identifi ed from the electronic imaging library. Records of these transfers were sought in the critical care electronic notes and the standards of documentation graded on a fi ve-point scale (very good, good, average, minimal, absent). Documentation of the grade and training of escorting staff was also sought. Between the two study periods, a transfer safety checklist was introduced. The intervention made in this audit had little impact on the standard of documentation. However, it has raised the issue within the consciousness of the staff . It is important to identify interventions that have failed to reach a gold standard to provide the impetus to seek other solutions. As a result of this study, the author has devised new hospital protocols and specifi c training courses to improve standards of transfer medicine locally.

L Lavayssiere University Hospital, Toulouse, France Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P430 (doi: 10.1186/cc12368)IntroductionThe aim of this retrospective study was to determine whether the molecular adsorbent recirculation system (MARS) can improve renal function in HSR1 patients. Methods Thirty-two patients with chronic liver disease and HRS1 were treated by MARS sessions that were performed every other day. The endpoint was renal function improvement by 28 days after diagnosis of HRS1 that was defi ned as a serum creatinine level <133 \u03bcmol/l. Partial renal recovery was defi ned as a 10% decrease in baseline serum creatinine level. Results The mean number of MARS sessions required by each patient was 3.5 \u00b1 1.5. The median time between admission and the start of MARS therapy was 3 (0 to 15) days. Of the total patients, 13 (40%) had improved renal function. Among these, nine (28%) had complete renal recovery. Among the patients that survived, only 40% (6/15) had improved renal function. When MARS was started, 53% of patients had failed renal failure according to RIFLE criteria. Seven patients received a liver transplant after diagnosis of HRS. Of these, four had complete or partial recovery after transplantation (57%) versus nine of the 25 patients who did not undergo liver transplantation (36%), P = NS. The 28-day survival rate was 47%. Conclusion MARS therapy improved renal function in only very few patients with HRS1. Even if liver transplantation is the best option, MARS could be used as a bridge until transplantation. Some authors argue that prolonged duration of dialysis (>1 month) before transplantation may result in chronic renal failure probably because there are two etiologies of AKI in end-stage liver disease: acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and real functional renal failure. ATN before liver transplantation has been identifi ed as a risk factor for patients' mortality and chronic renal failure at 1 and 5 years post liver transplantation. Further prospective controlled studies including large number of patients are required. The aim of this study was to investigate the eff ects of intermittent venovenous high-volume hemofi ltration (IHVHF) on extravascular lung water, respiratory function and cytokine removal in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with postoperative multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in severe abdominal infection patients. Methods Thirty patients with severe abdominal infection and ARDS were randomized into the IHVHF group (n = 15) and control group (n = 15). All patients were mechanically ventilated. The IHVHF technique with a rate of 100 to 120 ml/kg/hour during 6 to 8 hours was used. The PiCCOplus system was used to monitor cardiac output (CO), extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) and intrathoracic blood volume index (ITBVI). Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ), arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ), oxygenation index (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) and dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption were measured. Serum concentrations of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8 and lactate were measured by ELISA method. The APACHE II scores before and after IHVHF therapy were detected. Results All indexes in the control group did not show any signifi cant improvement before and after treatment (P <0.05). There was a signifi cant decrease of serum concentrations of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8 and lactate, increase of CO and decrease of EVLWI 24 hours after IHVHF (P <0.05). The indexes of oxygen delivery, consumption, PaO 2 , and Cdyn improved signifi cantly, PaO 2 /FiO 2 increased markedly compared with those before IHVHF and the control group. Signifi cant diff erences were detected in all of the hemodynamics and oxygen indexes (P <0.05). Conclusion IHVHF presents with a signifi cant benefi cial eff ect on respiratory function in patients with ARDS as a result of removal of cytokines, decrease in EVLWI, improvement of hemodynamic parameters, and correction of disturbances in oxygen balance. IHVHF adjuvant treatment for ARDS reduces pulmonary edema, improves PaO 2 /FiO 2 and Cdyn and mechanical ventilation parameters. IHVHF may be a promising treatment for ARDS in postoperative multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in severe abdominal infection patients.Reference 1.

Dialyzer clearance of myoglobin with middle molecule fi lter and low blood fl ow CVVHD in patients with rhabdomyolysis-associated acute kidney injury I Leppanen 1 , T Ahonen 1 , J Tenhunen 2 Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland; 2 Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P432 (doi: 10.1186/cc12370)Introduction Rhabdomyolysis-associated acute kidney injury can be treated with various modes of renal replacement therapy (RRT)[1,2]. We have used continuous venoveno hemodialysis (CVVHD) with middle molecule fi lter and low extracorporeal blood fl ow (100 to 180 ml/minute) to avoid albumin loss and hemodynamic instability. Methods We treated nine patients suff ering from rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury with various causes. We used a CVVHD mode with low (100 to 180 ml/minute) blood fl ow and a middle molecule fi lter (Ultrafl ux EMiC2; 1.8 m 2 surface area, polysulfone membrane, cutoff at 40 kDa, blood fi lling volume 130 ml, blood fl ow range 100 to 350 ml/ minute, maximum dialysate fl ow 1,000 ml/minute). Myoglobin and albumin concentrations were measured from prefi lter and postfi lter samples and dialyzer clearances were calculated (CLdial = blood fl ow\u00d7Cpre -Cpost/Cpre + UF\u00d7Cpre/Cpost). Measurements were taken at 0, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 4 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours and 48 hours from the start of the CRRT or until CRRT was no longer needed. Results The baseline and prefi lter plasma albumin concentrations varied from 8 to 29 g/l. Postfi lter and post-treatment albumin concentrations remained comparable. Prefi lter concentrations of myoglobin (17.8 kDa) varied from 96,109 to 747 \u03bcg/l and the dialyzer clearance of myoglobin from 50.6 to 0 ml/minute. The mean dialyzer clearance was 23.1 ml/ minute and the median clearance 22.2 ml/minute. Maximal changes between corresponding prefi lter and postfi lter samples were: absolute concentration change 27,091 \u03bcg/l, percentage 34%, dialyzer clearance 50.6 ml/minute. Clearances were achieved with low extracorporeal blood fl ow between 100 and 180 ml/minute, most commonly 120 ml/ minute. Ultrafi ltration (UF) was used only at fi ve of the 56 time points calculated, because of hemodynamic instability. All patients required either vasopressor or vasopressor and inotrope support. The highest dialyzer clearance of myoglobin (50.6 ml/minute) was measured at the prefi lter myoglobin of 29,266 \u03bcg/l, blood fl ow 180 ml/ml and no UF. Conclusion In a rhabdomyolysis-associated kidney injury a middle molecule fi lter and a low blood fl ow CVVHD off er a safe and eff ective treatment choice for patients requiring vasopressor or vasopressor and inotrope for hemodynamic support.",

Survivors and those who died were similar with respect to age, weight and incidence of heart failure, liver cirrhosis and primary renal diagnoses. Independent risk factors for hospital mortality were higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at RRT initiation (odds ratio (OR) = 1.18, 95% confi dence interval = 1.11 to 1.25), higher Charlson comorbidity index (OR = 1.22, 1.09 to 1.37), lower baseline creatinine (OR = 0.984 per 10 \u03bcmol/l, 0.970 to 0.998), lower minimum mean arterial pressure (MAP) on day 1 (OR = 0.81 per 10 mmHg, 0.66 to 0.95) and more positive fl uid balance for the fi rst 7 days (OR 1.03 per 100 ml, 1.02 to 1.05). Of 172 hospital survivors, 57 (33.1%) were RRT dependent at discharge. Although univariable analysis suggested lower SOFA scores and higher baseline serum creatinine levels in those who remained RRT dependent, no factor was independently associated with RRT dependence at discharge in a multivariate model. Conclusion In this cohort of patients with AKI requiring RRT, a more positive fl uid balance over 1 week and lower initial minimum MAP were associated with mortality. Among survivors, a less positive fl uid balance was not associated with increased risk of RRT dependence at discharge, suggesting that conservative fl uid management does not signifi cantly attenuate renal recovery.Introduction Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, and ranitidine, a histamine-2 receptor antagonist are frequently used in intensive care patients requiring stress ulcer prophylaxis. Continuous venovenous hemodiafi ltration (CVVHDF) is an important extracorporeal renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients suff ering from multiple organ failure. This study investigates the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of esomeprazole and ranitidine in anuric critically ill patients undergoing CVVHDF. Methods Esomeprazole 40 mg was administered intravenously once daily in nine intensive care patients and ranitidine 50 mg was administered intravenously three times daily in nine intensive care patients with acute renal failure undergoing CVVHDF who required stress ulcer prophylaxis. The concentration of esomeprazole and ranitidine in serum and ultradiafi ltrate was determined by highperformance liquid chromatography. The intragastric pH was obtained via intragastric pH-metry. Results The mean peak prefi lter concentration, AUC 0-24 , volume of distribution, half-life, total clearance and hemodiafi ltration clearance of esomeprazole were 6.9 \u03bcmol/l, 30.6 \u03bcmol.hour/l, 53.3 l, 2.0 hours, 1.4 l/ hour and 0.2 l/hour, respectively. In the ranitidine group the mean peak prefi lter concentration, AUC 0-8 , volume of distribution, half-life, total clearance and hemodiafi ltration clearance were 5.5 \u03bcmol/l, 12.0 \u03bcmol. hour/l, 91.4 l, 14.4 hours, 5.8 l and 1.3 l, respectively. Median time of intragastric pH >5 and median intragastric pH decreased signifi cantly in the ranitidine group over time (P <0.05) but not in the esomeprazole group. Conclusion Although pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole and ranitidine are only little infl uenced by CVVHDF, we found a signifi cant decrease of intragastric pH in patients treated with ranitidine. Esomeprazole may be superior for long-term stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients undergoing CVVHDF.",

A total of 539 (55%) were hypocalcaemic (iCa <1.1 mmol/l). adjCa was available for 1,031 (99%), with 602 (58%) classifi ed as hypocalcaemic (adjCa <2.2 mmol/l). adjCa <2.2 mmol/l had sensitivity of 78% and specifi city of 63% for detecting iCa <1.1 mmol/l. The best previously published formula had an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI = 0.78 to 0.83), compared with an AUC of 0.78 (0.75 to 0.81) for the locally validated formula[1]. It was hypothesized that albumin, pH or phosphate derangements could aff ect the proportion of albuminbound calcium and the performance of adjustment formulae. Albumin concentration was not correlated with the diff erence between adjCa and iCa. Weak but statistically signifi cant correlations were found for pH (r = 0.164; P <0.001) and phosphate (r = 0.135; P <0.001). The sensitivity and specifi city of adjCa <2.2 mmol/l for detecting hypocalcaemia did not improve when looking at patients with normal pH (sensitivity 60.4%; specifi city 69%) or phosphate (32.2%; 78.9%). Conclusion adjCa is a relatively poor predictor of iCa in critically ill patients. This cannot be explained by abnormalities of albumin, phosphate or pH. With direct iCa measurements now readily available on ward-based analysers, adjCa should not be used to determine calcium status in critical illness.P447 Vitamin D status and overall and sepsis mortality in critically ill patients P Zajic, C Schnedl, T Valentin, A Grisold, A Holl, S Farzi, S Fruhwald, H Dobnig, TR Pieber, K Amrein Medical University of Graz, Austria Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P447 (doi: 10.1186/cc12385) Introduction Vitamin D status may aff ect hospital mortality and infectious complications in critical illness. Methods A total of 655 mixed critically ill patients with available 25(OH)D levels hospitalized between 2008 and 2010 were included.Cox regression analysis adjusted for SAPS 2, age and gender was performed. 25(OH)D levels were categorized by month-specifi c tertiles (high, intermediate, low) to refl ect seasonal variation. Primary endpoint was the correlation between 25(OH)D and hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints were sepsis mortality and blood culture positivity. Results Hospital mortality was signifi cantly higher in patients in the low (HR = 1.98) and the mid-range tertile (HR = 1.88) compared with the highest tertile. Vitamin D levels were signifi cantly lower in patients with lethal sepsis compared with other causes of death (12.3 \u00b1 5.0 vs. 18.2 \u00b1 11.2, P = 0.02). Blood culture positivity rates did not diff er between the groups (23.0% vs. 26.8% vs. 17.3%, P = 0.361). SeeTable 1.Conclusion Low 25(OH)D status is predictive of all-cause and sepsis mortality in the critically ill.

Hypocalcaemia aff ects between 15 and 50% of admissions to the ICU[1]. Methods Adjusted calcium results <2.0 mmol/l were followed up from admission for 5 days or until discharge or death. On each day the adjusted calcium result and the calcium replacement were documented. Adequate replacement is defi ned as 40 ml of 10% calcium gluconate if the adjusted calcium is <2.0 mmol/l and 20 ml of 10% calcium gluconate if the adjusted calcium result is between 2.0 and 2.15 mmol/l. Results Eighty-eight adjusted calcium results were <2.0 mmol/l. In 74 results adequate replacement was given and the average increase in calcium was 0.2 mmol/l. This led to an increase in the adjusted calcium to >2.15 mmol/l in 36% of results and improvement to >2.0 mmol/l in 89% of results. In 14 results no replacement was given and the average increase in calcium was 0.07 mmol/l, which equated to 57% of calcium results remaining <2.0 mmol/l. Unpaired t test showed a P value of 0.0006. A total of 150 adjusted calcium results were between 2.0 and 2.15 mmol/l. In 111 results adequate replacement was given and the average increase was 0.006 mmol/l. The adjusted calcium fell to <2.0 mmol/l in 26% of results and normalised to >2.15 mmol/l in 23%. Where the adjusted calcium fell despite replacement, 51% of results were below 2.05 mmol/l. In 39 results no replacement was given, leading to an average fall in calcium of 0.03 mmol/l. Thirtythree percent of calcium results fell to <2.0 mmol/l and 20% of results normalised. Unpaired t test showed a P value of 0.07. Conclusion Calcium replacement with 40 ml of 10% calcium gluconate is eff ective when the adjusted calcium is <2.0 mmol/l. Replacement with 20 ml of 10% calcium gluconate when the adjusted calcium is between 2.0 and 2.15 mmol/l is not much more eff ective than no replacement. This suggests that either replacement is not needed or there is under-replacement in mild hypocalcaemia. Adjusted calcium may be giving falsely low calcium results in mild hypocalcaemia. The measurement of ionised calcium is a possible solution[2,3].",

Relative risk for developing diabetes during 5 years after ICU admission is 4.2 (95% CI = 3.2 to 5.9) for patients who did have hyperglycaemia. Conclusion The results of this study confi rm in a large mixed medical/ surgical ICU population that hyperglycaemia occurring in severe illness or the perioperative period is associated with increased risk of developing diabetes. Suggesting lifestyle changes to reduce the risk and regular follow-up should be implemented at least for these patients.Reference 1.

In both databases, association between average glucose and hospital mortality followed a bathtub shape with mortality nadir between 80 and 130 mg/dl. No mortality diff erence was observed between adjacent AVG glucose bins in the bottom of the bathtub(Figure 1). This relationship was preserved in nondiabetics, and for patients with higher risk of death. Conclusion Low and high average glucose are associated with mortality.Introduction We evaluated the clinical and numerical accuracy of the Freestyle Navigator continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, in critically ill adults using two diff erent methods of calibration. Studies looking at intensive glucose control have yielded confl icting results with increased rates of iatrogenic hypoglycemia. Availability of accurate real-time glucose information may improve safety and effi cacy of glucose control in the critical care unit. Methods In a randomized prospective trial, paired CGM and reference glucose (hourly arterial blood gas (ABG)) were collected from 24 adults with critical illness (age 60 \u00b1 14 years, BMI 29.6 \u00b1 9.3 kg/m 2 , APACHE score range 6 to 19) and hyperglycemia (glucose \u226510 mmol/l or treated with intravenous insulin), over 48 hours. In 12 subjects, CGM was forcecalibrated at variable 1 to 6 hourly intervals using ABG glucose (FC arm). In the other 12 subjects, the sensor was calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions (1, 2, 10, 24 hours after insertion) using arterial blood and built-in glucometer (MC arm). Results Two groups had similar characteristics at baseline. A total of 1,060 CGM/ABG pairs were analyzed and reference glucose ranged from 4.3 to 18.8 mmol/l. Median (IQR) absolute relative deviation was lower in the FC arm (7.0% (3.5, 13.0) vs. 12.8% (6.3, 21.8), FC vs. MC, P <0.001). Similarly, the percentage of points in the Clarke error grid zone A points meeting ISO criteria were higher with FC (87.8% vs. 70.2%). Sensor bias (median (IQR)) was signifi cantly lower in the FC arm (-0.1 (-0.7, 0.4) mmol/l vs. -1.1 (-2.3, -0.1) mmol/l, P <0.001). The median (IQR) interval between calibrations in FC arm was 169 (122, 213) minutes. Conclusion CGM accuracy in the MC arm was comparable with accuracy in subjects with type 1 diabetes. Further signifi cant improvements to CGM accuracy in critical care are possible by increasing the frequency of calibrations. Such accurate CGM may provide valuable information to guide insulin therapy in critically ill subjects.Introduction Hypoglycemia (H) is a complication of intensive insulin (IN) therapy of critically ill patients and is independently associated with increased risk of mortality (M). Heightened attention to identifi ed risk factors (RF) and causes of hypoglycemic events (HE) may lead to improvement in glycemic control. A limited literature describes RF for H but a detailed root cause analysis (RCA) of individual HE has not been published. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data including 835 patients admitted consecutively between 1 February 2012 and 31 October 2012 to the 16-bed medical-surgical ICU of a university-affi liated teaching hospital. The blood glucose (BG, mg/dl) target was 90 to 120 and the monitoring frequency was every 3 hours, or every 1 hour when the patient received i.v. IN infusion. HE data were collected by the bedside nurse, using a cutoff of BG <60, and information was abstracted from the unit's database. RF included: shock (SH), renal insuffi ciency (RI), hepatic failure (HF), mechanical ventilation (MV), and diabetes mellitus (DM). Attributable causes included: IN treatment, improper monitoring frequency (MF), interruption of feeding (FE), and spontaneous (SP). We measured rates of severe (<40) and mild (40 to 69) H, and compared them as well as percentage of values in the optimum range (70 to 139) and hyperglycemic range (>139) with data from the preceding 3 months (PRE). Results Sixty-three (7.5%) patients sustained a total of 79 HE. They were older, more likely to be diabetic, and had higher APACHE IV predicted (37.3% vs. 15.4%, P <0.0001) and observed (25.4% vs.8.6%, P <0.0001) M than those without H. RF: SH 24.1%; RI 24.1%; HF 8.9%; MV 46.8%; DM 36.5%. Attributable causes: IN 58.2%; MF 8.9%; FE 6.3%; SP 36.7%. BG <40, 40 to 69 and >139 decreased 78.6%, 39.0% and 9.3% (P = 0.0006, P <0.0001, P <0.0001). BG 70 to 139 increased 5.5% (P <0.0001). In total, 4.2% and 22.4% of PRE patients sustained severe and mild H.In total, 0.7% and 14.1% of RCA patients sustained severe and mild H (P = 0.0029, P = 0.0003). Conclusion IN treatment was associated with barely more than one-half of HE in this population of intensively monitored patients. Implementation of an initiative mandating RCA of every HE, including identifi cation of RF and attributable causes, was associated with a signifi cant improvement in glycemic control.Introduction Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in ICUs has the potential to improve patient safety outcomes. The GluCath Intravascular CGM System uses a novel quenched chemical fl uorescence sensing mechanism to measure glucose concentration in venous or arterial blood (BG). This is the fi rst report of this system deployed for 48 hours in both arteries and veins of ICU patients. Methods This ongoing clinical study evaluates up to two sensors per subject in 20 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. An arterial sensor is deployed via a standard 20 G radial artery catheter inserted for routine care and an optional venous sensor is deployed percutaneously in an upper arm vein. Data are presented from the fi rst fi ve patients. Outcome measures are qualitative (ease of use, workfl ow fi t) and quantitative (accuracy vs. reference analyzer). Sensors were inserted shortly after ICU admission, with ultrasound guidance for venous sensor insertion. In vivo calibration was performed at 1 and 2 hours, then each morning. Glucose values were recorded every 10 seconds by the system. Hourly arterial reference samples were analyzed via Radiometer ABL 800 Flex Blood Gas Analyzer (BGA). Results Arterial sensors were successfully deployed in all fi ve patients and did not interfere with clinical care, blood pressure monitoring or sampling. One arterial catheter failed resulting in sensor removal at 36 hours. The venous sensor was deployed in three patients, but removed from two patients due to thrombosis identifi ed during surveillance ultrasound examinations. A total of 202 reference BG samples ranging from 5.3 to 11.3 mmol/l were collected. Precision between arterial and venous sensors (n = 2) was 9.3% CV. Arterial sensor accuracy compared with BGA was 5.5% MARD. One hundred percent (202/202) of arterial sensor measurements met ISO 15197 criteria (within =/-20% of reference measurements if BG \u22654.2 mmol/l;Figure 1). Conclusion The GluCath System measured glucose concentration continuously in cardiac surgery ICU patients. Arterial catheter deployment did not appear to compromise line function or patient care. Percutaneous venous deployment was feasible, but may be associated with risk of local venous thrombosis.

Despite frequent hypoglycemia <40 mg/dl (1.4% in UC, 25.0% in TGC, P <0.0001), TGC did not result in increased blood glucose variability, as refl ected by the standard deviation of the blood glucose time series (TGC: 36 (24 to 50) mg/dl, UC 34 (26 to 48) mg/dl, P = 0.82). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusting for baseline risk factors (age, severity of illness, malignancy, type of admission), hypoglycemia (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.19 to 2.22) and blood glucose variability (OR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.97 to 1.02, per mg/dl) were not associated with PICU mortality. In contrast, hyperglycemic index (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.04, per mg/dl) was independently associated with mortality and its lowering statistically explained the outcome benefi t of the intervention. Conclusion TGC substantially reduced the hyperglycemic index, at the expense of increased hypoglycemia incidence, but without aff ecting blood glucose variability. Statistical analysis suggested strictly avoiding hyperglycemia in order to bring about outcome benefi t with insulin in critically ill children.Reference 1.

P464 Implementation of evidence-based protocols improves survival: a 15-year surgical ICU experience in 10,172 patients SA Nasraway Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P464 (doi: 10.1186/cc12402)IntroductionThere has been enormous interest in measuring ICU performance in terms of mortality and resource use, owing to increased public and health insurer scrutiny. We elected to describe the performance of our surgical ICU, using a standardized mortality ratio (SMR = observed / predicted mortality). Methods The primary cohort was all patients admitted to the surgical ICU from March 2010 through February 2012 and related outcomes. The change in SMR was longitudinally determined from the latest 15year study period (1997 to 2011) comprised of 10,172 patients. Results There were 1,799 ICU admissions in the primary cohort. Hospital mortality, observed and predicted by APACHE IV, was measured. Crude hospital mortality was 8.4%. The hospital SMR (observed / predicted mortality) was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.49 to 0.65). The SMR decreased by 20% from 0.73 to 0.58 over the 15-year study period, an absolute 1% per year decrease (P = 0.039; 95% CI: -0.02 to -0.002), as shown inFigure 1. Conclusion Mortality was less than predicted and steadily declined during the previous 15 years. The SMR can be used to track success when new quality measures are introduced or changes in the delivery of care are made. ICUs should report their standardized mortality ratios to evaluate performance.P465Decubitus ulcers are associated with prolonged length of stay in critically ill patientsWT McGee 1 , BH Nathanson 2 , E Lederman 1 , TL Higgins 1 1 Baystate Medical Center, Springfi eld, MA, USA; 2 OptiStatim LLC, Longmeadow, MA, USA Critical Care 2013, 17(Suppl 2):P465 (doi: 10.1186/cc12403)Introduction How decubitus ulcers (DU) diagnosed on admission to the ICU aff ect resource use is unknown. We hypothesize that this easily identifi able clinical fi nding would be associated with longer hospitalizations. Methods Clinical assessment was used to identify patients with DU on admission to the ICU. The association of DU on hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS) was assessed with generalized linear models that adjusted for ICU admission source, age, APACHE IV score, diabetes, sepsis, hepatic failure, dialysis and mechanical ventilation. Results DU was present on admission in 180 of 2,723 (6.6%) during a 19-month period in 2011 to 2012 at a single teaching hospital in New England. Patients with decubiti were sicker on admission (mean (SD) APACHE IV 80.2 (28.2) vs. 58.7 (30.7), P <0.001), more likely to be age 65 or older (58.9% vs. 41.8%, P <0.001) and require more organ supportive therapies(Table 1). DU patients had a higher in-hospital mortality rate (32.2% vs. 18.3%, P <0.001) and longer mean ICU and hospital LOS (4.9 vs. 3.3 days and 15.6 vs. 10.5 days, respectively (P <0.001)). After multivariate adjustment, DU patients stayed 3.2 days, 95% CI (1.6, 4.8) longer in the hospital than non-DU patients and stayed 2.5 days longer, 95% CI (0.7, 0.43) among survivors. DU patients had longer ICU stays (1.3 days, 95% CI (0.3, 1.3)) in general but were statistically similar among survivors.",

Our purpose is to identify mortality predictors in this population. Methods A retrospective study of HIV patients admitted to our ICU between January 2005 and December 2009. We identify septic patients and analyzed demographic factors, etiology, organ failure and outcome. We used logistic regression to calculate the relative mortality risk for each qualitative variable and the beta (\u03b2) coeffi cient for quantitative variables. Results Sixty-two septic patients were admitted to our ICU during the study period (71% men, mean age: 40.59 \u00b1 8.12). A total of 56.5% came from the ED, mean hospital stay before ICU admission: 6.14 \u00b1 10.96 days. A total of 66.1% had a history of intravenous drug use, other comorbidities: COPD (9.7%), cirrhosis (8.1%), solid or hematologic malignancy (12.9%). A total of 40.3% were under HAART. Mean CD4 count at admission: 219.62 \u00b1 353.93 cells/mm 3 . Mean viral load: 4.57 \u00b1 3.25 log. Mean albumin levels: 2.3 \u00b1 0.53 g/dl. APACHE II: 21.98 \u00b1 7.97. The lung was the most frequent focus of infection (65.6%) followed by the CNS. The most common pathogen was S. pneumoniae (28.8%), followed by P. jirovecii (13.6%). In total, 62.9% needed vasopressors, 79% mechanical ventilation and 19.4% renal replacement. Mean ICU and hospital length of stay: 10.43 \u00b1 10.52 and 34.76 \u00b1 29.64 days. ICU mortality: 33.9%; hospital mortality: 41.9%. ICU mortality increases for each day of hospital stay before ICU admission (\u03b2 = 1.062, 95% CI = 1.009 to 1.118, P = 0.022), each point of: cardiac frequency at admission (\u03b2 = 1.059, 95% CI = 1.024 to 1.096, P = 0.95% CI = 1.051 to 9.345, P = 0.04) if patients do not come from the ED, almost 10-fold if the patients need vasopressors for more than 24 hours (\u03b2 = 9.975, 95% CI = 2.054 to 48.451, P = 0.004) and fi vefold if patients need renal replacement (\u03b2 = 5.692, 95% CI = 1.466 to 22.099, P = 0.012). It may be hypothesized that a patient's infl ammatory status might aff ect the clinical picture and outcome of a subsequent septic insult. To test this hypothesis, patients were categorized according to previous infl ammatory activity and analyzed with respect to clinical picture and outcome in a retrospective study. Methods The Swedish ICU registry was used to identify all adult patients diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock in a single Swedish ICU during 2006 to 2011. The charts were reviewed and patients categorized into four groups based on whether the patient had suff ered systemic infl ammatory-inducing insults previous to the septic episode. The patients were categorized as: (A) primary sepsis, no recent (<30 days) trauma/infection, ongoing systemic infl ammatory or immunosuppressive disease or malnutrition; (B) secondary sepsis, recent (<7 days) trauma/infection or systemic infl ammatory disease, but no immunosuppressive disease or malnutrition; (C) tertiary sepsis, >1 fulfi lled criteria of secondary sepsis during the last 10 days or immunosuppressive disease or malnutrition; and (D) patients not attributable to A to C. After the categorization, physiological and laboratory parameters during the ICU stay as well as therapy and outcome were extracted from the charts. Only signifi cant diff erences (P <0.05) are presented; Mann-Whitney and chi-squared tests were used.",

Methods We reviewed admission data for a 12-bed critical care unit in a district general hospital in the UK between 2001 and 2010. We calculated critical care and hospital discharge survival rates and studied the trend in these through the decade. We searched hospital records to establish whether these patients were still alive at November 2012 to determine life-expectancy (minimum 22-month follow-up on all patients). This was compared with UK Offi ce of National Statistics data for the local population[1]. Discharge destination (care facility or home address) was recorded as a surrogate marker of change in quality of life post discharge. Results A total of 481 patients aged 80 or over were admitted between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2010, representing 9.6% of the admissions during this time with minimal annual change. Admission age ranged from 80 to 96 years (median 83) with a median APACHE II score of 20 (6 to 48, IQR 16 to 25). In total, 318 (66.1%) survived to critical care discharge and 256 (53.2%) survived to hospital discharge; 228 (89.0%) went home rather than to a care facility. Those under 80 years demonstrated 80.6% critical care survival, 65.5% hospital survival and a median APACHE II score of 17 (0 to 51, IQR 13 to 23). Eighty patients died within the 22-month follow-up period with an average life expectancy of 7.4 months. None reached life expectancy (average curtailment of 5.6 years compared with age-matched and sex-matched population statistics). Neither of these fi gures changed signifi cantly through the decade. However, 10-year follow-up on 2001/2002 admissions showed that, despite this early mortality eff ect, the average post-discharge lifespan was 5.1 years with 2.2 years shortfall in life expectancy.",

Results Preliminary results, based upon data from 175 included patients, reveal an ICU mortality of 12.6% and 30-day mortality of 22.9%. No patients were lost to follow-up. When the Physical Component of SF-36 (PCS) was used as an estimate of preadmission quality of life, the area under the curve for model B (AUC = 0.80) was comparable with model E (AUC = 0.81), and better than model A (AUC = 0.85). The General Health item of SF-36 (GH), used as an estimate of preadmission quality of life, gave an AUC = 0.76 (model D). All models were controlled for sex and age. Conclusion Preliminary results indicate that the SF-36 GH and the SF-36 PCS are as good as APACHE II to predict mortality 30 days after ICU admission.

Adherence rate to VAP care bundlesConclusion  The educational program and the implementation of VAP care bundles can reduce the incidence of VAP, length of ventilatory support and mortality rate in the ICU. Reference Introduction The 2009 H1N1 pandemic caused surges of severely ill patients with viral pneumonia requiring ventilation and particularly aff ected high-dependency medical services such as ICUs in settings that lack suffi cient personnel and resources to provide optimal care. Ministries of Health of several countries asked the World Health Organization (WHO) for clinical management guidance. Methods We developed (2009 to 2011) and piloted (2011 to 2012) curriculum and training materials targeted at clinicians without formal critical care training who care for adult and paediatric patients with severe acute respiratory infections in ICUs in resource-limited settings. Results With contributions from 37 global experts, we developed a 3-day course including 14 learning units in early recognition, pathophysiology, oxygen therapy, infl uenza diagnostics, infection control, resuscitation of septic shock, antimicrobial therapy, monitoring, lungprotective ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome, sedation, weaning, preventive care, quality improvement, and ethics. Teaching techniques are appropriate for adult learners and include short slideshow-based lectures, interactive small-group role-play sessions and a toolkit with practical resources such as checklists. With funding from the WHO and local Ministries of Health, the training course was piloted among 67 clinician participants in the Caribbean and Indonesia (29 and 38, respectively) and taught by external critical care specialists. Participants' daily evaluations rated all units as at least very good. Test scores to assess participant critical care knowledge improved signifi cantly from before the training to immediately after (Caribbean, 58 to 80%; Indonesia, 56 to 75%; P <0.001 for both). Conclusion It was feasible to develop and deliver an advanced critical care curriculum and related training materials in a short, interactive workshop for noncritical care trained clinicians in resource-limited settings. However, the small-scale programme was labour and time intensive. Widespread dissemination of these materials requires identifi cation of target countries, engagement of Ministries of Health, and secure funding. Longer-term evaluation is necessary to determine whether such programmes improve processes of care and clinical outcomes for critically ill patients.

Diff erences in predicting ability for prognosis, however, have been reported. In 2012, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) created the new AKI criteria, combining RIFLE and AKIN criteria. However, such a combination might cause inconsistency among each defi nition in the criteria. We have investigated all of the defi nitions in the new KDIGO criteria in detail. Methods This is a retrospective historical cohort study including adult patients admitted to the ICU (Jikei University, Tokyo, Japan) between January 2010 and October 2011. Patients undergoing chronic dialysis were excluded. KDIGO criteria were applied to all patients to diagnose AKI. Hospital mortality of patients with AKI diagnosed by the 10 defi nitions in the criteria was compared. Results A total of 2,399 patients were evaluated. AKI occurred in 26.6% with standard defi nition of KDIGO; 18.0% with creatinine criteria alone; 15.5% with urine output alone. By multivariable analysis, each AKI stage was associated with hospital mortality: 5.6%, odds ratio 2.95, for Stage 1; 10.1%, odds ratio 5.52, for Stage 2; 30.2%, odds ratio 21.30, for Stage 3. Crude hospital mortality stratifi ed by the 10 defi nitions showed increasing trends with stage progression. Mortality of the three defi nitions in Stage 1 was from 4.2% to 8.8%. Stage 2 had two defi nitions and their mortality was 12.1% and 12.9%. Stage 3 had fi ve defi nitions and their mortality was from 20.5% to 55.6%. Conclusion AKI defi ned by the new KDIGO criteria was associated with increased hospital mortality. In addition, defi nitions in the KDIGO criteria seem to be appropriate because of clear relations between mortality and stage progression. Introduction To evaluate whether urinary neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin (uNGAL) detects acute kidney injury (AKI) earlier than the estimated glomerular fi ltration rate (eGFR) in cardiac surgery patients. Methods Two-hundred and seventy-four adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery were consecutively included from February to December 2011. Exclusion criteria were absence of diuresis due to end-stage renal disease or chronic renal failure and a previous cardiac catheterism with i.v. contrast use the week before surgery. Four serial blood and urine samples immediately before (PRE) and after (POST) surgery, and 1 day (1d) and 2 days (2d) after surgery were obtained. uNGAL was measured in an Architect 6200 (Abbott Diagnostics). AKIN criteria were used to diagnose AKI. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and all patients gave informed consent. Delta uNGAL was defi ned as the diff erence between the PRE and the POSTs concentrations. Results One-hundred and eighty-one patients (66.1%) were men; mean age was 68.2 \u00b1 12.2 years. Valve replacement was performed in 123, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in 81, valve surgery + CABG in 48, cardiac transplant in fi ve, aorta aneurism surgery in nine, and other procedures in eight patients. ICU and hospital stays were 6.7 \u00b1 8.1 and 15.7 \u00b1 13.9 days, respectively. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was required in 16 patients (5.8%) within 48 hours of ICU stay and in 28 patients (10.2%) within 4 weeks. Mortality at 28 days was 2.9%. Eighty-six patients (31.4%) were diagnosed with AKI within 48 hours of surgery. Area under the ROC curve of POST uNGAL for AKI diagnosis was 0.72 (0.66 to 0.79) (P <0.0001) at an optimal cutoff value of 180 \u03bcg/l, Introduction Acute renal failure (ARF) is a common complication in patients admitted to the ICU. Sepsis is also a well-known risk factor for the development of ARF. The combination of ARF and severe sepsis was reported to carry a mortality up to 70% whereas the mortality of ARF alone is 40 to 45%. The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of renal perfusion scanning in detecting the prognosis and outcome of patients with acute renal failure due to sepsis. Methods Forty patients with acute renal failure due to sepsis, aged between 15 and 74 years, were enrolled in the study. They were monitored for their ICU prognosis and outcome after doing renal perfusion scanning. All patients were subjected to routine ICU and laboratory investigations including APACHE II and SOFA score. Results Thirty patients had normal renal scan and 10 patients had abnormal renal scan. The mortality percentage was higher among abnormal renal scan cases (three out of 10, 30%) compared with cases with normal renal scan (seven out of 30, 23.3%) with nonsignifi cant P value: 0.6. The median length of stay/day in ICU was longer among nonsurvivors than survivors 15.5 \u00b1 10, 11.5 \u00b1 8, P value: 0.058 (approaching signifi cance). APACHE II score was higher in nonsurvivors than survivors 23.9\u00b1 3.2, 19.6\u00b1 4.2, P value: 0.0001. The percentage of mortality among cases that needed mechanical ventilation was higher (nine out of 16, 56.3%) compared with mortality cases that did not need mechanical ventilation (one out of 24, 4.2% with P value: 0.0001). Conclusion ARF may exert an independent adverse eff ect on outcome in septic and septic shock patients. It is also a risk factor for mortality. Tc-99m DMSA scanning is useful for detecting renal dysfunction and help to predict the outcome and prognosis. Reference Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) complicates over 50% of ICU admissions. Episodes of AKI are a major risk factor for development or progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, methods of estimated glomerular fi ltration rate (eGFR) may be poorly calibrated to survivors of critical illness who may have reduced muscle mass. We hypothesized that eGFR may underestimate rates and severity of CKD in ICU survivors. Methods A retrospective observational study of renal function in all patients admitted to a London teaching hospital ICU for \u22655 days and surviving to hospital discharge in 2011. We excluded cases with current or new diagnosis of end-stage renal disease or renal transplant. We assessed AKI in ICU by KDIGO 1 criteria and hospital discharge eGFR by the CKD-EPI equation. For comparison we assumed a normal GFR in a healthy individual as 120 ml/minute/1.73 m 2 at age 20 decreasing by 0.8 per year over age 20. Results We identifi ed 282 patients, 180 of whom had AKI. Median age was 50 and 68% were male. Median hospital discharge serum creatinine was 57 \u03bcmol/l (range 16 to 654), median eGFR was signifi cantly higher than predicted normal GFR for age at 115 versus predicted 95 (P <0.001, median diff erence 16). In patients who had not had AKI discharge the eGFR was 119 versus normal predicted 98 (P <0.001, median diff erence 19), suggesting that eGFR could be overestimating true GFR in our population by at least a factor of 1.23 ( Figure 1 ). Applying this correction factor to eGFRs of patients who had recovered from AKI resulted in 44% more diagnoses of CKD (eGFR <60) at hospital discharge (36 vs. 25). Conclusion eGFR may overestimate renal function in survivors of critical illness confounding identifi cation of CKD in this at-risk population. Prospective studies with measurement of actual GFR are required to assess the burden of CKD in survivors of critical illness. ",

Fluid overload potentially masks a subsequent acute renal function loss through dilution of serum creatinine and maintenance of urine output just above AKIdefi ning criteria. Methods We investigated the early postoperative value of NGAL versus that of simultaneously measured serum creatinine to predict subsequent fl uid overload. We studied 100 adult cardiac surgery patients in the control arm of a RCT (NCT00672334). Severe postoperative fl uid overload was defi ned as positive fl uid balance >10% of preoperative body weight within 48 hours after surgery. Results Severe postoperative fl uid overload was present in 5% of patients with a mean positive fl uid balance of 15.8 \u00b1 9.5 l. At ICU admission, urine NGAL predicted severe fl uid overload (AUC-ROC 0.82 (95% CI = 0.70 to 0.94)) ( Figure 1 ) and mortality (AUC 0.88 (0.78 to 0.97)). Serum creatinine measured at the same time did not predict severe fl uid overload (AUC 0.52 (0.26 to 0.79)) or mortality (AUC 0.61 (0.16 to 0.99)). Conclusion Early NGAL-guided adjustments to fl uid management may reduce organ edema after cardiac surgery. Findings should be validated in larger cohorts.",

There is now increasing evidence that AKI is a risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, when AKI occurs as a complication of critical illness appropriate follow-up may be neglected. Accordingly, we reviewed the follow-up of renal function in all patients who received RRT on our ICU and survived to hospital discharge. Methods A retrospective audit of patients who received RRT in a central London adult critical care unit during 2011. Results Of 921 patients admitted, 203 received RRT with 109 surviving to hospital discharge. We excluded 52 patients who had end-stage renal disease, renal transplant or known glomerular disease. Of the remaining 57 AKI patients, median age was 60 (range: 18 to 77) and 37 (65%) were male. Median discharge creatinine was 74.5 \u03bcmol/l (27 to 662). Forty-two (74%) were off ered follow-up, but in only six cases (11%) was this to nephrology services. Twenty-eight attended follow-up (fi ve to nephrology) at a median time of 6 weeks; however, creatinine was measured at in only 14 and in six of these it had risen (by median 16.5 \u03bcmol/l). In addition, 14 patients had creatinine measured 3 to 6 months post discharge and in eight it had risen (by median 31.5 \u03bcmol/l). Conclusion Follow-up of patients who received RRT for AKI in the ICU was poor and they were rarely referred to nephrologists. Where renal function was measured after discharge, there was evidence of progressive renal dysfunction; however, renal function was often not assessed. We propose an algorithm for clinicians to guide follow-up. See Figure 1 . Introduction Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia have been linked to worse outcomes in critically ill patients. While there is controversy as to the optimal tightness of glucose control in critically ill patients, there is agreement that an upper limit to safe glucose levels exists and that avoiding hypoglycemic episodes should be prioritized. Our algorithm can assist clinicians in maintaining blood glucose ([Gbl]) within a desired target range while avoiding hypoglycemia. Methods Our model predictive control (MPC) algorithm uses insulin and glucose as control inputs and a linearized model of glucoseinsulin-fatty acid interactions. To allow the controller model to learn from data, a moving horizon estimation (MHE) technique tailored the tissue sensitivity to insulin to individual responses. Patient data ([Gbl] measurements, insulin and nutritional infusion rates) were from the HIDENIC database at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.",

The model captured patient [Gbl] via nonlinear least squares by adjusting insulin sensitivity (SI) and endogenous glucose production (EGP0). The resulting virtual patient (VP) is used to evaluate the performance of the MPC-MHE algorithm. Results MPC controller performance on one VP is shown in Figure 1 . Across a population of 10 VPs, the average [Gbl] under MPC is 6.31 mmol/l, the average minimum is 4.62 mmol/l, the population individual minimum is 3.49 mmol/l and the average absolute average residual error is 0.83 mmol/l from a 5.6 mmol/l target. With standard intervention, the 10 VPs have an average [Gbl] of 9.32 mmol/l, an average minimum [Gbl] of 3.77 mmol/l, and a population minimum [Gbl] of 2.78 mmol/l. Algorithm performance deteriorates signifi cantly if the imputed sampling time exceeds 30 minutes, underlining the importance of dynamic variations in insulin sensitivity in this population. Conclusion The MPC-MHE algorithm achieves targeted glucose control in response to changing patient dynamics and multiple measured disturbances for a pilot population of 10 VPs. Furthermore, the MHE scheme updates patient parameters in real time in response to changing patient dynamics. Introduction Blood glucose (BG) control reduces morbidity and length of stay, and is standard practice in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [1] . However, maintaining BG in the target range, while avoiding hypoglycemia, is challenging. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a promising technology that may help address these challenges. We investigated the performance and safety of Medtronic Sentrino\u00ae, a newly developed CGM for critically ill adults, in the cardiac ICU. Methods Adult patients with actual or planned cardiac ICU admission at a single tertiary center were approached for participation and signed consent. Other inclusion criteria were treatment with i.v. insulin (target BG <140 mg/dl) and life expectancy >96 hours. After initiation of i.v. insulin, Sentrino\u00ae subcutaneous glucose sensors were inserted into patients' anterior thighs with planned study participation of 72 to 96 hours. Reference BG was collected according to ICU protocol, obtained from central venous catheter and analyzed with bedside blood gas analyzer (BGA; i-STAT\u00ae, Abbott, USA). Sensor glucose (SG) results were displayed, and its predictive alerts and alarms fully enabled. Additional reference BGs were obtained during alarms and calibration. All treatment decisions were based on BGA data, not on SG values. Results A total of 21 patients were enrolled; all successfully completed the study. Mean age was 65 years, 38% were women, 67% had diabetes. Types of surgery were CABG (38%), valve replacement (29%), combined CABG and valve (19%) and cardiac transplant (14%). SG was displayed 95% of the time during the study, and 864 paired BG-SG points were used for analysis. Overall mean absolute relative diff erence (MARD) was 12.2%. No diff erences in CGM system accuracy were seen within subgroups of low versus high Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score (MARD 12.1% and 10.6% for STS >8% vs. \u22648%, respectively) or hemodynamic status (MARD 12.0% and 12.4% for compromised vs. stable hemodynamics). Consensus grid analysis showed >99% of SG values within A/B zones, and 0% in D/E zones. No device or study-related adverse events were reported. In total, 80% and 100% of clinicians found Sentrino\u00ae easy to use after one and two patients, respectively. Conclusion The Sentrino\u00ae CGM system demonstrated good analytic and clinically relevant accuracy, excellent reliability and safety in critically ill cardiac patients; and was easy to use and integrate in the cardiac ICU. Future studies are needed to determine whether CGM can improve BG control and reduce hypoglycemia in this patient group. Introduction A large RCT showed that tight glucose control (TGC), targeting age-adjusted normal fasting blood glucose levels with insulin infusion, decreased morbidity and mortality in critically children [1] . However, the incidence of hypoglycemia increased substantially in the TGC group. We aimed to assess the eff ect of TGC on the three domains of blood glucose dynamics (hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and blood glucose variability) and their independent association with mortality in the pediatric ICU. Methods This is a preplanned substudy of a published RCT in one 10-bed pediatric ICU. Seven hundred patients (age 1 to 16 years), admitted to the PICU between October 2004 and December 2007, were randomized to either TGC (50 to 80 mg/dl in infants, 70 to 100 mg/dl in children) or to the usual care tolerating hyperglycemia up to 215 mg/ dl (UC). Patients with at least two arterial blood glucose measurements were included (UC n = 349; TGC n = 348). Results Mean blood glucose levels were lowered from 143 \u00b1 34 mg/dl in the UC group to 104 \u00b1 24 mg/dl (P <0.0001). The median number of samples per patient did not diff er between UC (21 (13 to 48)) and TGC (22 (15 to 49)). TGC lowered the hyperglycemic index, a marker of Introduction HIV infection is a major public health problem in the world. The use of prophylaxis against opportunist infection and the introduction of HAART in 1996 increased life expectancies. The therapeutic use of ICU resources for HIV patients has been controversial, questioning the admission of these patients especially in advanced stages of the disease, given the poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to determine the experience of the past 15 years in relation to the income of these patients in an ICU. Methods A retrospective case series consisting of patients with diagnosis of HIV infection (known or unknown) admitted between January 1995 and December 2009. We collected demographic and epidemiological data, process of acquisition of the disease, infection status: known or unknown patient infected, whether or not receiving antiretroviral therapy and whether it was eff ective (undetectable viral load at the time of admission), APACHE II, cause of admission, need for mechanical ventilation (MV), pathology related or unrelated to HIV infection and ICU mortality. Results During this period 12,607 patients were admitted to the ICU, 188 (1.5%) HIV-positive. Mean APACHE II score 17.6, median age 39 years, 73% men and 90% Spanish nationality. Principal risk behavior: addiction drugs injection (67%). Seventeen percent of patients did not know who was infected with HIV at the time of admission to the ICU. Fifty-three percent were not receiving HAART. Of the 88 patients treated, 93% were receiving HAART (eff ective in 88% of cases). Sixty percent of the patients came from the emergency department of the hospital. Main admission diagnoses: acute respiratory failure caused by infection (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pneumocystis jirovecii), neurological disorders (coma for illicit drugs and psychotropic) and septic shock. Seventy percent required MV. Of patients whose HIV infection was not known, 93.5% were admitted for related pathology. In patients of known infection, the pathology associated with HIV was 30%. Average length of stay 9 was days. ICU mortality was 35%. Most frequent causes of death: septic shock and multiple organ failure. Conclusion Depending on the patient and the cause of admission, ICU admission may represent an excellent opportunity as a screening method to determine HIV status. Given the greater effi cacy of HAART at present, most patients with medical or surgical conditions unrelated to HIV infection will be eligible to join the ICU. People with HIV can and should benefi t from using reasonable and individualized care in an ICU. References Conclusion Neither immune status-related variables nor comorbidity or infection focus are mortality predictors. Poor nutritional status, delayed ICU admission, shock or renal failure increase the ICU relative mortality risk. Tachycardia, hypotension, hypercapnia, acidosis, and oliguria in the fi rst ICU 24 hours increase signifi cantly ICU mortality. Mechanical ventilation is not a mortality predictor. Introduction Patients with lung cancer commonly require the ICU for a variety of acute illnesses related to the underlying malignancy, treatment, or comorbid conditions. ICU admission of patients with nonresectable lung cancer has been criticized based on the high mortality rate in this population. However, recent advances in critical care may have changed this scenario. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with hospital mortality in this group of patients. Methods A retrospective study was conducted in consecutive medical and surgical patients with lung cancer admitted to a university hospital ICU in S\u00e3o Paulo, between 2007 and 2012. A univariate analysis was performed to identify associated variables with hospital mortality. Selected variables were included in the multivariate model. Results From 597 patients included in the study, 477 were medical admissions (79.8%) and 120 were surgical admissions (20.2%). Four hundred and twenty (70%) patients had metastasis, 222 patients (37%) required the ICU because of respiratory failure and 121 (20%) because of septic shock. The ICU and hospital mortality rates were 53.9% and 64%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality were diagnosis of nonsmall-cell lung cancer, higher Charlson morbidity index, medical admission, active neoplasm, vasopressor need at admission to and at 24 hours of ICU, acute renal failure at admission, non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation need at admission to and at 24 hours of ICU and a higher admission arterial lactate. By multivariate analysis, risk factors of hospital mortality were diagnosis of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (OR = 3.32; 95% CI, 2.08 to 5.29, P <0.001), medical admission (OR = 2.89; 95% CI, 1.75 to 4.77, P <0.001), acute renal failure at admission (OR = 4.09; 95% CI, 1.49 to 11.21, P <0.001), non-invasive ventilation at 24 hours of ICU (OR = 2.50; 95% CI, 1.48 to 4.23, P = 0.001) and mechanical ventilation at 24 hours of ICU (OR = 3.68; 95% CI, 1.87 to 7.26, P <0.001). Conclusion Hospital survival in patients with lung cancer requiring ICU admission was 36%. Our results provide evidence that ICU management may be appropriate in patients with nonresectable lung cancer and appoint risk factors for mortality, helping to better triage cancer patients who will benefi t from ICU care. Introduction Because the prognosis of older patients with cancer may be poor compared with younger patients, it remains controversial whether they benefi t from ICU treatment. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with hospital mortality in older patients with cancer requiring the ICU.Methods A retrospective study was conducted in consecutive medical and surgical older patients with cancer admitted to a university hospital ICU in S\u00e3o Paulo, between 2007 and 2012. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to identify associated and independent factors related to hospital mortality. Results From 8,976 patients with cancer requiring ICU at the period, 600 patients were 80 years old or higher. Most patients were male (53%), had solid neoplasm (86%), were from medical admission (54%) and 37% had metastatic disease. The mean age was 84 years (\u00b1 3). The ICU and hospital mortality rates were 30% and 44%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality were diagnosis of lung cancer, medical admission, active neoplasm, vasopressor need at 24 hours of ICU, acute renal failure at admission, mechanical ventilation need at admission to and at 24 hours of ICU and a higher admission arterial lactate. By multivariate analysis, risk factors of hospital mortality were diagnosis of lung cancer (OR = 2.32; 95% CI, 1.08 to 3.29, P <0.001), medical admission (OR = 6.473; 95% CI, 2.76 to 15.15, P <0.001), acute renal failure at admission (OR = 3.09; 95% CI, 1.49 to 9.21, P <0.001), mechanical ventilation at 24 hours of ICU (OR = 5.68; 95% CI, 2.87 to 7.26, P <0.001) and lactate levels at admission (OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.006 to 1.051, P <0.001). Conclusion Hospital survival in older patients with cancer requiring ICU admission is acceptable. Our results provide evidence that ICU management may be appropriate in older patients with cancer and appoint risk factors for mortality, helping to better triage cancer patients who will benefi t from ICU care. Introduction Readmission to the ICU within 48 hours is an indicator of quality of intensive care and is associated with an increase in mortality. During the last years several groups have published data based on multivariate logistic regression analysis to describe characteristics of patients who needed readmission to the ICU. Older age, comorbid conditions and severity of illness (APACHE score) have been among the strongest predictors for readmission. In our ICU most patients are in the groups formerly identifi ed as risk groups, which means that stratifi cation and prediction of readmission is diffi cult. Because of the unusual high severity of acute and pre-existing illnesses we could not fi nd a data match on comparable patient groups. To investigate whether we could reduce our rate of readmission we therefore decided to perform a qualitative investigation to identify risk factors related to readmission. After identifi cation of the risk factors we will take actions to optimize care and perform ongoing control of the implemented actions to secure that they decreases the rate of readmission. Methods Retrospective data on patients readmitted to the ICU within 48 hours during an 8-month period (November 2011 to June 2012) were drawn from the Critical Information System (CIS) at ICU ZIT, Bispebjerg Hospital, Denmark. ZIT is a multidisciplinary unit with 10 beds and 500 to 600 admissions/year and a median SAPS II score of 47. A group of consultants, junior doctors and nurses from the ICU and the ward each read the patient fi les with focus on pattern recognition and suggested trigger points to focus on. Data on trigger points were then drawn from the CIS system and re-evaluated. Finally, fi ve key points were identifi ed and serves as basis for future actions. Results In a qualitative analysis, readmissions to the ICU are related to the following fi ve key points -discharge outside day hours, lack of infection control, stay in ICU <2 days, lung physiotherapy ordinated but not eff ectuated, and several minor organ dysfunctions (atrial fi brillation and acute kidney injury). Age, diagnosis, SAPS II score or ventilator treatment during intensive care was not diff erent in patients with successful discharge and patients readmitted in this group of patients. Conclusion It is possible and suitable to identify key points for future eff orts in a given subgroup of patients using a systematic qualitative approach. Conclusion The latest audit follows introduction of a referral system directly to the ICU consultant and may account for the reduction in numbers of referrals attended by junior doctors. ED/medicine persist as the main source of referral to the ICU. Discussion with the referring team consultant may reduce inappropriate referrals. ICU staffi ng should not be reduced. [1, 2] . This study aims to evaluate the impact of the time elapsed from request until admission to the ICU on mortality and ICU length of stay (LOS). Methods A retrospective cohort study performed on patients in the ICU of Hospital Regional de Samambaia over a period of 4 years, from January 2008 to December 2011. The patients were allocated into two groups: patients who waited longer than 6 hours, long waiting period ",

            "text": "The management of emergency medical admissions has been a subject of recent clinical incidents. There was a high percentage of patients that were referred to the ICU by staff in training, and 21% of referrals were made by junior doctors. Consultant physicians had no knowledge of the case in 57% of referrals. Methods A prospective study of 21 cases of referrals and admissions to the ICU was conducted at the Glasgow Victoria Infi rmary Hospital from 8 to 21 September 2012. A questionnaire was produced relating to the referrals, admissions, seniority involvement, cause of referral, and time of patient review by the ICU consultant after ICU admission. They were distributed to specialist registrars and the ICU consultants. All data were electronically recorded into an Excel database. Questionnaires that were not completely fi lled were further investigated using patient clinical notes and contact with medical staff . Information that may identify a patient or clinician was removed from the questionnaire for confi dentiality purposes. Results Twenty-one complete questionnaires were collected. Fiftyseven percent (12/21) of cases involved admission to the ICU. Nine percent of the cases involved contacting either a specialist registrar or ICU consultant intensivist for assistance in practical procedures. Of the patients admitted to the ICU, 33% (4/12) were from medical wards, 33% were admitted from A&E. Consultants were the most common professionals who referred patients to critical care (48%; 10/21). Fourteen percent of cases (3/21) involved the referral of patients into ICU by a junior doctor, but only one of the referrals was accepted by the ICU intensivist. Consultants referred or were aware of the referral in 71% (15/21) of cases. Of admissions, 58% (7/12) were accepted by the ICU consultant and the remaining by the specialist registrars. All accepted were acknowledged by the ICU consultant. After admission all of the patients were reviewed by the ICU consultant and the time of review after admission was on average 1 hour 23 minutes (25 minutes to 3 hours 45 minutes). Conclusion There is still an issue with junior doctors referring patients to the ICU without the acknowledgement of consultant physicians, resulting in unnecessary admissions and decreased time that ICU trainees spend in the ICU. There are more appropriate ICU admissions when there is involvement with seniority. Contact with ICU staff to perform practical procedures outside the ICU and not about admissions should be explored further. Reference Introduction The requirements for the intensivist in handling medical technology are constantly growing. It appears necessary to acquire technological competences particularly within the fi elds of medical technology and physics. In the master's degree program 'MasterOnline Physico-Technical Medicine' , such technical authority is conveyed. To cope with the intensive vocational situation of the physician, this study course follows the blended-learning concept; that is, it is conceived as an online study course with small portions of intermittent presence phases. Within the fi rst year, technical basic skills such as 'measurement technique' , 'informatics' , and 'advanced physics' are covered. Subsequently, two of various advanced courses in diff erent fi elds of medical technology ('technology in intensive care medicine' , 'technology in surgery' , 'technical cardiology' , 'radiology' , and other) are selected. Methods In a survey, we evaluated the study course. Therefore, a questionnaire was distributed among all students including the topics course contents, learning materials, time management, supervision, and overall impression. The students were asked to score their agreement to the statements 'content is well structured' , 'content extent is appropriate' and 'content is relevant for medical purposes' on a scale ranging from 1 (fully disagree) to 5 (fully agree). Results The students participated actively in this study course with highest motivation and large commitment. The students' workload was in the targeted range of about 10 hours/week. Content structure was scored with 4.3 \u00b1 0.1, content extent with 4.1 \u00b1 0.2 and medical relevance with 4.3 \u00b1 0.2. Conclusion The blended-learning concept fulfi lls the requirements for occupation-accompanying continued medical education, since it off ers the possibility to study self-employed accessing text documents, lecture recordings, and electronic lectures and to convert in concentrated presence phases this knowledge into practical exercises.

            "text": "The fi rst-hour protocol determines the patient-specifi c resources for the start of an ICU stay [1] . Staff resources are decided through triage. Task charts direct the start of intensive care. Our primary goal is to improve patient care. Methods A triage method (red, yellow, green) is used to manage ICU resources according to the severity of illness. For example, one doctor and one nurse would admit a stable (green) patient coming from the operating room for postoperative ICU care. A patient in septic shock with multiple organ disorder (red), on the other hand, would be admitted by a team of two doctors and three nurses. Each staff member has a task chart in a checking-list format. Also, an admission chart is used to improve data collection. The use of the protocol started as a pilot study in early 2012. Simulation education for staff members started in August 2012 and has included video recordings and debriefi ng of each simulated ICU admission. Primary goal-directed therapy goals have been mean arterial pressure (MAP >65 mmHg), SpO 2 >94%, timing of the laboratory tests, start of antibiotics, and blood glucose level 6 to 8 mmol/l. Quality indicators have been followed from the data provided by The Finnish Intensive Care Consortium. Questionnaires for the staff members have been used to evaluate opinions about the fi rsthour protocol. Results According to the questionnaire replies, 80% (n = 64/80) of our nurses estimate that the fi rst-hour protocol has improved the starting process of our patients' intensive care. Twenty percent (n = 16/80) of the nurses considered that the protocol has no eff ect, and none thought it to be adverse for patient care. Corresponding numbers for our ICU doctors were 87% (benefi cial n = 13/15), 13% (no eff ect n = 2/15) and 0% (adverse). Furthermore, 82.5% (n = 66/80) of the nurses replied that education of new nurse staff members has improved because of the fi rst-hour protocol. A total of 17.5% (n = 14/80) thought there has been no eff ect, and none considered the protocol harmful for education. For ICU doctors the protocol did not bring either clear educational advantages or disadvantages. The variable life-adjusted display curves (The Finnish Intensive Care Consortium) have shown improvement in our patient care after the implementation of the fi rst-hour protocol. However, we cannot determine whether it is a signifi cant factor in our intensive care results. Conclusion The fi rst-hour protocol has helped us in resource management, start of the patients' intensive care and education of nursing staff . Introduction Demand for critical care services is increasing yet a comprehensive understanding of how critical care nurses -the largest group of ICU direct care providers -impact outcomes remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine how critical care nurse education (hospital proportion of bachelor's prepared ICU nurses) and ICU work environment infl uenced 30-day mortality of mechanically ventilated older adults. Methods A multi-state cross-sectional nurse survey was linked to hospital administrative data and Medicare claims (2006 to 2008). The fi nal sample included 55,159 mechanically ventilated older adults in 303 hospitals. Logistic regression modeling was employed to jointly assess the relationship of critical care nurse education, work environment and staffi ng on 30-day mortality while adjusting for hospital and patient characteristics and accounting for clustering. Results A 10% increase in the proportion of ICU nurses with a bachelor's degree or higher was associated with 2% lower odds of death while controlling for patient and hospital characteristics. Patients cared for in better work environments experienced 11% lower odds of riskadjusted death than those cared for in poorer ICU work environments. Conclusion Patients cared for in hospitals with a greater proportion of bachelor's prepared ICU nurses and in better ICU work environments experienced signifi cantly lower odds of death. As the demand for critical care services increases, attention to the education level of ICU nurses and ICU work environment may be warranted to optimize currently available resources and potentially yield better outcomes. Introduction Information about big hospital geographical transfer is scarce in the medical literature. On 20 February 2011 our hospital (in fact, a big university complex) was transferred from their previous location in the north-center of our city towards a new southern peripheral, geographical location. This transfer has been done without any changes in assisted population or nursing/medical staff . The only change was a slight increase in bed number (21 to 24). Our aim is to analyze changes in activity indexes (length of stay, occupancy rate, and so forth) and case mix (origin, previous quality of life and NYHA score, main diagnostic groups, severity scores, in-ICU and in-hospital mortality). Introduction South-east London (SEL) presents unique challenges to healthcare providers due to its diverse demographic. The high levels of poverty, immigration and psychiatric illness impact delivery of obstetric care. These were identifi ed as risk factors for poor outcome in the latest CMACE report [1] . The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) produced data on obstetric critical care admissions in 2007 [2] . We reviewed the obstetric critical care admissions in three SEL hospitals and compared this with the national average determined in the ICNARC and CMACE data. Methods All critical care admissions in three high-risk obstetric units in SEL (1 August 2009 to 31 July 2011) were screened for patients who were currently or recently pregnant. We compared local results with national data by ICNARC and CMACE.",

            "text": "There were 68 obstetric critical care admissions in the SEL hospitals within the audited time frame. The mean age was 30.05 in ICNARC data compared with 33.93 in SEL. Average APACHE II scores were lower in SEL compared with the ICNARC data, but length of stay was greater in SEL (2.72 days) compared with ICNARC (1.5 days). Haemorrhage was the most common reason for admission in SEL, whilst sepsis was the leading cause of death according to the latest CMACE report (Figure 1 ). Conclusion Data from national audits may guide protocol, but services must be tailored to local circumstances. SEL has unique population characteristics and obstetric critical care admissions diff er signifi cantly from national statistics; in particular, haemorrhage is over-represented in our region. Critical care services were generally required for a short period of time; during this period, routine postpartum care may be omitted as treatment priorities diff er. Dedicated critical care services on the labour ward may be a way to combine postnatal care with transient high-dependency requirements. This may enhance patient experience and prove cost-eff ective. Introduction Adverse drug events (ADEs) are associated with a substantial increase in morbidity and mortality in any setting. Because patients in ICUs were critically ill with complex diseases and varied organ dysfunction, the incidence of ADEs on such patients is much more crucial than the counterparts. We thus assessed the nature of ADEs and their infl uence in ICUs. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study at ICUs at three large tertiary-care hospitals in Japan. Trained research nurses reviewed all medical charts, incident reports and reconciliations from the pharmacy to identify suspected ADEs as well as the background of patients. ADEs are any injuries that result from the use of a drug. After suspected ADEs are collected by research nurses, physician reviewers independently evaluated them and classifi ed them as ADEs or rule violations. We used the validated methodology [1] . Results We included 459 patients with 3,231 patient-days. The median age was 70 years and the median length of stay was 3 days. In total, 70 patients (15%) had at least one ADE during their stay in the ICU. The median ICU stay in patients who had ADEs was 14 days while 2 days in patients who had no ADEs (P <0.0001). The median length of the ADE onset days since admission was 3 days. Regarding the mortality, 73 patients (16%) were dead during their ICU stay: 12 deaths (17%) in patients who had ADEs and three of 12 deaths were caused by an ADE, and 61 deaths (16%) in counterparts (P = 0.8). There were no signifi cant diff erences of patients' characteristics between patients with ADEs and without ADEs (Table 1) . Conclusion ADEs were associated with longer stay and caused a part of death in ICU (4%) although they did not increase the mortality. Because the characteristics of patients were not associated with ADEs, early detection and intervention for ADEs could be important to improve the morbidity and reduce the death caused by ADEs in ICUs. Introduction In Hungary, despite the high level of social support, the number of organ recoveries from deceased donors has not changed signifi cantly. The donation activity shows a positive relationship with the level of education of staff in ICUs as well as with their attitude towards transplantation. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to estimate the attitude and knowledge of intensive care specialists and nurses as regard donation and transplantation. Methods The self-completed questionnaire that consisted of 20 items was completed at the Congress of Hungarian Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Therapy in 2011. Besides the epidemiological data, the intensive care specialists (n = 179) and nurses (n = 103) were asked about donation activity, participation in an organ donation course, selfreported knowledge of joining Eurotransplant, donor management, legislation, and transplantation. The data were analyzed by SPSS 17.0. Results A total of 53.6% of physicians and 16.7% of nurses attended an earlier organ donation course (P <0.01). The average age of those who participated in training was signifi cantly higher among doctors (P <0.01). Fifty-nine percent of doctors and 65.1% of nurses did not even want to participate in such training. Donation activity was higher among staff who joined training (P <0.01). Independently from accepting the presumed consent legislation (91.1%), 66% of physicians agreed with the hospital practice that requests the adult donor's relatives to consent to organ recovery. This standpoint did not depend on donation activity, participation in an organ donation course, opinion about legislation and the nature of staff . A total 95.4% of participants consented to their organ retrieval after death. The staff who participated in an organ donation course had more knowledge regarding the law and ethics of donation (P <0.01), donor management (P <0.01), living and deceased donor transplantation (P <0.01) and joining Eurotransplant (P <0.01). Older professionals had more information about all fi elds (P <0.01). Nurses had less knowledge concerning donor management (P <0.01), law and ethics (P <0.01) and deceased donor transplantation (P <0.01) than doctors. Conclusion Education about organ donation needs to be part of specialist training of intensive care staff , and refresher courses every fi fth year as well. The course should include knowledge regarding brain death, donor management and communication with family. This is the fi rst step to improve the number of transplantations. ",

            "text": "In the UK, three people die each day awaiting trans plantation, due to the unavailability of donor organs. Traditionally, donor identifi cation has been restricted to the ICU. However, following the UK Organ Donation Taskforce report in 2008 [1] , a number of emergency departments (EDs) have been working with specialist nurses for organ donation (SN:OD) to identify potential donors and approach their families for consent in the ED. We present our initial experience after the introduction of a SN:OD to an Irish teaching hospital's ED. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of deaths in our ED during a 28-month period. For those who died in the ED, case notes were reviewed to identify those suitable for organ donation. Referral and donation rates were compared in two cohorts, pre and post introduction of a SN:OD. Fisher's exact test was used to assess diff erences between groups. Results Ninety-one deaths occurred in the study period. Following introduction of the SN:OD, referrals increased from zero to eight. Of the eight referred, three received consent and were transferred to the ICU, two of whom became successful donors. The number of missed potential donors fell from six to one (P = 0.009). Conclusion Introduction of a SN:OD and a clinical pathway has led to the identifi cation of previously missed potential organ donors in the ED. Several patients have subsequently been admitted to critical care solely to facilitate organ donation. Reference Introduction Admission to hospital overnight has been shown to increase mortality and decrease hospital length of stay [1] . The objective of this study was to determine whether this relationship is valid in patients admitted to our ICU, and whether length of stay was aff ected. Methods A retrospective data collection identifi ed 5,827 patients admitted to a fi ve-bed ICU from April 1994 to November 2012. Data regarding patient age, sex, APACHE II score and ICU admission date and time were collected along with the length of stay in the unit and hospital. Defi nitions of day and night were set to local ICU standards of 9:00 am to 8:00 pm. Patients were then separated into two groups and analysed using Analyse-It software for Excel. Results Crude ICU and hospital mortality rates in patients admitted during the day and overnight were examined. There was no signifi cant diff erence in unit mortality (day 22.3% vs. night 22.7%, OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.16, P = 0.718) or hospital mortality (day 30.7% vs. night 29.1%, OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.04, P = 0.203). The mean unit length of stay showed no diff erence in patients admitted during daytime compared with those admitted overnight (4.27 days vs. 4.09 days, P = 0.162). The mean hospital length of stay was decreased in patients admitted during daytime compared with patients admitted overnight (19.3 days vs. 21.7 days, P = 0.004). The average age of patients was less in those admitted out of hours (night 56.5 years vs. day 59.2 years, P = <.0001). There was no signifi cant diff erence in APACHE II scores of patients between the groups (day 19 vs. night 19, P = 0.580). Conclusion There is no signifi cant diff erence between the mortality of patients admitted overnight and patients admitted during the day to our unit. The hospital length of stay is increased in patients who are admitted overnight to intensive care; however, ICU length of stay is not aff ected. Adjustment for other confounders such as current bed occupancy and staffi ng ratios during the entire patient stay may help to understand the diff erences seen in the hospital length of stay. Introduction Interdisciplinary rounds (IDRs) in the ICU are increasingly recommended to support quality improvement and to reduce confl icts, but uncertainty exists about assessing the quality of IDRs. We developed, tested, and applied a scoring instrument to assess the quality of IDRs in ICUs. Methods A literature search was performed to identify criteria for instruments about assessing team processes in the ICU. Then, 10 videotaped patient presentations led by diff erent intensivists were analyzed by Delphi rounds. Appropriate and inappropriate behaviors were highlighted. The IDR-Assessment Scale was developed and statistically tested. The inter-rater reliability was evaluated by rating nine randomly selected videotaped patient presentations by three raters. Finally, the scale was applied to 98 videotaped patient presentations during 22 IDRs in three ICUs for adults in two hospitals in Groningen. Results The IDR-Assessment Scale had 19 quality indicators, subdivided into two domains: Patient Plan of Care, and Process. The domain Patient Plan of Care refl ects the technical performance from the initial identifi cation of a goal to the evaluative phase. The domain Process refl ects the team processes that are important to ensure that the appropriate plan of care is agreed, understood, and executed as planned by all care providers. Indicators were essential or supportive. The inter-rater reliability of nine videotaped patient presentations among three raters was satisfactory (\u03ba = 0.85). The overall item score correlations between three raters were excellent (r = 0.80 to 0.94). Internal consistency in 98 videotaped patient presentations was acceptable (\u03b1 = 0.78). Application to 22 IDRs led by 14 diff erent intensivists in three ICUs in two hospitals demonstrated that indicators could be unambiguously rated. The staff and management of all three ICUs that were rated had considered their IDRs to be adequately performed, and they were surprised by these study results. Conclusion This study showed that the quality of IDRs can be reliably assessed for patient plan of care and process. The IDR-Assessment Scale had satisfactory inter-rater reliability, excellent overall item score correlations, and acceptable internal consistency. Our instrument may provide feedback for ICU professionals and managers to develop adjustments in quality of care. Testing the IDR-Assessment Scale in other ICUs may be required to establish general applicability. ",

The purpose of this intervention study was to measure the eff ect of leadership training on the quality of performed interdisciplinary rounds (IDRs) in the ICU.Methods In this nonrandomized intervention study, participants included nine intensive care medicine fellow trainees (intervention group) and 10 experienced intensivists (control group). Participants in the intervention and control groups previously were untrained in leading IDRs in the ICUs. After each participant led an IDR that was videotaped, the fellow trainees participated in a 1-day leadership training, which was consistent with principles of adult learning and behavioral modeling. After training, each fellow trainee led another IDR that was videotaped. Quality of the performed IDRs was measured by review of videotapes of the 19 IDRs lead by 19 intensivists, including 198 patient discussions subdivided into four ICUs, and assessment with the IDR-Assessment Scale. Results Comparison of the intervention versus control groups shows that the intervention group has more yes scores on the IDR-Assessment Scale than the control group. This diff erence was signifi cant in 12 of the, in total, 19 quality indicators. Conclusion Quality of leadership will be reliably trained and measured in the context of IDRs in ICUs. Training in a simulation environment, with real-life IDR scenarios including confl icting situations, and workplacebased feedback in the preparation and feedback phases, appears to be eff ective to train leadership behaviour. Results Over a 6-month period, 131 teleconsultations (114 patients) were done. Mean age was 50.1 years, 57.1% was male and mean APACHE II score was 24.3. A total of 64.8% originated from the ICU and 35.2% from the ED. Main consultation diagnoses were sepsis (31.3%); stroke (29.8%); survival from cardiac arrest (6.1%); trauma (6.1%); and acute myocardial infarction (5.3%). TM improved diagnosis in 14.5% and infl uenced the clinical management in 85.5% of the consultations. Invasive procedures were indicated in 61.1%. Life-saving procedures were TM related in seven patients (6.1%): stroke thrombolysis (n = 6) and limb amputation (n = 1). Seven patients (6.1%) were transferred and submitted to surgical procedures (heart surgery (n = 2), neurosurgery (n = 4) and liver transplantation (n = 1)). The majority of the patients remained at HMMD and were discharged. Conclusion A TM program is feasible to be implemented in a community hospital. The major benefi t is expertise medical transfer from the tertiary hospital to the community setting, improving diagnosis and management of critical care patients, and avoiding routine transfer to a major urban center.",

When deciding to withdraw therapy, 57% of consultants routinely seek and document a second opinion. Regarding donation after cardiac death (DCD), 93% of consultants were happy to delay withdrawal to facilitate successful donation, 85% have already done so in their practice and 14% routinely withdraw therapy in theatres rather than on the ICU. Even if it would impact on the care of other patients, 48% would delay withdrawal of therapy to facilitate DCD. For patients accepted for DCD, 36% think that some intensivists withdraw more aggressively (in essence, hasten death) in the hope of improving the likelihood of a successful organ donation and 29% have felt pressurised to withdraw therapy more quickly than their usual practice. Furthermore, 45% experienced pressure to refer a patient for DCD when it they felt it was not appropriate. Conclusion This survey confi rms variation in the practice and attitudes to withdrawal of futile therapy amongst UK consultant intensivists. Formal protocols were frequently unavailable to guide withdrawal and second opinions were often not sought. Nearly one-half of the intensivists delay withdrawal to facilitate donation, even if this may impact on the care of other patients. Many intensivists have felt pressure to refer for donation when they feel this is inappropriate and there is a perception that some intensivists may withdraw care more aggressively in those who are accepted for DCD to improve the likelihood of a successful donation.

The focus groups centred on feelings of isolation, abandonment, vulnerability, dependency and reduced physical activity post hospital discharge. Many reported a lack of social inclusion as they did not have the energy or confi dence to venture outside. However, those in the exercise group felt that the rehabilitation programme was motivating, built up confi dence, improved fi tness, helped social interaction and gave them a sense of achievement.Conclusion The 8-week exercise intervention resulted in statistically signifi cant improvements in fi tness at 9 weeks while focus group participants highlighted the positive eff ects of the exercise intervention leading to enhanced energy levels, motivation and achievement. Psychological benefi ts of the exercise programme are apparent from the focus group, emphasising the important link between physical and mental health. Introduction Survivors of critical illness often have a prolonged stay on the ICU. These patients may suff er from ICU-acquired weakness. It has been shown that reduction in muscle mass and muscle strength occurs early after admission to the ICU. However, in the very early stage on the ICU, patients are often sedated and not able to participate in any active mobilizations. Therefore the use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is becoming a treatment of interest in the ICU. The aim was to study the feasibility and safety of NMES in a surgical and medical ICU of a large, tertiary referral university hospital. Methods Fifty patients with an expected prolonged stay on the ICU of 5 more days (judged on day 3) with no trauma or neurological disease were included. They then received daily a NMES session (DUO 500; Gymna, Belgium) for 25 minutes on the quadriceps bilaterally during their entire stay on the ICU. The main outcome was the ability to produce a contraction of the quadriceps through NMES. The muscle contraction was quantifi ed on a 5-point scale: 1 (no contraction palpable and visible) up to 5 (contraction very well palpable and visible). Patients were classifi ed as responders when an adequate muscle bulk was obtained in \u226575% of the sessions. The potential factors associated with the feasibility were: gender, age, body mass index (BMI), diagnosis of sepsis, Barthel index prior to admission to the hospital, APACHE II score, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), fi ve questions for adequacy, stimulus intensity and leg edema. A multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the factors determining whether or not a contraction could be expected in a patient. Safety of NMES was assessed through heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and respiratory rate. Results In 48% of the patients we were able to achieve adequate muscle contractions in more than 75% of the sessions. GCS (P = 0.047), edemaIntroduction Trauma is the most common cause of morbidity in young people. It has a high social impact both because of the high cost of the acute treatments and because of the physical and psychological consequences that it may cause. A prospective, observational, singlecenter study on quality of life 12 to 24 months after trauma was carried out. The aim of the study is to evaluate life quality after trauma and to identify the most important needs of the patients, in order to improve the level of care after an ICU stay and to implement a faster and more eff ective reintegration into the active and productive society.

Methods Patients who have been discharged home from hospital following an ICU stay of 48 hours or more were recruited to the study. Patients were only excluded if they were not considered safe for exercise. Baseline measurements were completed prior to stratifi ed (age, gender, APACHE II score) random allocation to either the exercise or control group. Outcome measures included cardiopulmonary fi tness (6-minute walk test), balance (Berg Balance Scale), grip strength (JAMAR grip dynamometer) and hospital anxiety and depression (HAD score). The exercise group completed a 6-week supervised exercise programme, twice a week for up to 1 hour. In the seventh week, all patients repeated the baseline measurements. An unpaired Student's t test was used to compare any diff erences between the control and exercise groups. Results At baseline measurements, there were no statistical diff erences in age, gender, length of stays or APACHE II scores between the two groups. Results indicate that the exercise group (n = 10) had signifi cantly greater improvements in cardiopulmonary fi tness (P <0.001) and balance (P <0.05) compared with the control group (n = 10).

References Introduction Intensive care patients suff er psychological and physiological distress that may have debilitating and long-lasting eff ects [1] [2] [3] . Healthcare professionals are in a position to help avoid or alleviate this stress [4] . To action this it is important to identify the main stressors from the patient's perspective. A systematic review was performed to provide a list of what patients consider stressors in intensive care. These were then ranked in order to provide an identifi cation tool that can be used to shape appropriate care. Methods A systematic review was performed using MEDLINE, CINAHL, Psych INFO and Academic Search Complete. Grey literature was included and searches were not restricted to type of intensive care or country. Criteria were used to fi lter those articles that identifi ed the patients' views of their stressor, not the patient experience. Eligible articles were critiqued using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative studies [5] and brought together using a narrative synthesis.All of the reviewed studies used a questionnaire as a means to identify what elements on the intensive care patients found stressful. A list of the top-10 stressors could then be expressed for each study and compared. From this information, a set of guidelines for best practice were devised. Introduction This study describes the development and validation of the Consumer Quality Index Relatives in ICUs (CQI 'R-ICU'), which aims to measure the satisfaction of relatives and to identify aspect of care that need improvement in the ICU in a reliable and valid way.According to the quality standards of the Dutch Society of Intensive Care, every ICU needs to record the satisfaction of relatives [1] . At this moment there is insuffi cient insight into the quality of care off ered to relatives on the ICU because an evidence-based Dutch measurement instrument is missing. Methods The CQI 'R-ICU' has been developed based on a scientifi c and standardised method [2] . A mixed design method is used, consisting of qualitative and quantitative survey studies. Factor analyses are carried out to determine the underlying structure of the newly developed questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis is used to explore the relationship between demographic variables and the perceived quality of care. Results In six hospitals the CQI 'R-ICU' is sent to relatives after receiving informed consent (n = 441), 55.1% of the respondents are the patient's partner. Respondents seem to be most satisfi ed with the presence of a professional at fi rst entrance to the ICU. The highest need for improvement scores relate to information about meals, parking and other disciplines (for example, social worker, spiritual worker or psychologist). Factor analysis shows that quality of care is determined by four clusters of items: Support, Communication, General Information and Organisation. The reliability of the CQI 'R-ICU' is suffi ciently high, only Communication and Support are signifi cant predictors of total quality judgement of relatives (adj. R 2 = 0.74). In addition, there is a signifi cant diff erence in mean total quality judgement between the six hospitals as well as between the four wards within Erasmus MC. None ",

            "text": "We are conducting a cluster randomized trial with two parallel arms to evaluate strategies to improve family satisfaction with the care that themselves and their critically ill relatives receive in the ICUs of nonacademic Brazilian public hospitals. Here we report the results of the baseline phase of this trial. Methods In this baseline phase, we interviewed the family member most closely involved with the care of critically ill patients who stayed in the ICU for at least 72 hours. We applied a form with 24 questions divided into four domains: overall ICU experience, communication, decision-making, and questions related to end-of-life care for patients who died in the ICU. Each question scored from 0 (very poor) to 100 (excellent). The form was adapted from the Family Satisfaction with Care in the ICU (FS-ICU 24). As many questions assessed the quality of intensivist care or communication, the interview was applied by a psychologist or a nurse. Results Families of 564 patients were interviewed. A total 45/564 (8.3%) died in the ICU. Most respondents were satisfi ed with overall ICU experience (mean \u00b1 SD score 85.5 \u00b1 11.9). However, family satisfaction with communication (67.8 \u00b1 18.0) and decision-making (69.5 \u00b1 21.1) resulted in somewhat lower scores. Most families of patients who died in the ICU (38/45 (82.6%)) considered that their relative's life was neither extended nor shortened unnecessarily. Also, most of the families believed that their relative did not suff er or suff ered little in the ICU (37/46 (80.4%)) and felt supported by the healthcare team (40/46 (87.0%)). Conclusion Most families were satisfi ed with the care themselves and their critically ill relatives received in the ICU. Also, most relatives of patients who died in the ICU felt that end-of-life care was adequate. Although we believe there is much room for improvement in communication, decision-making and support critically ill patients and their families, as their baseline satisfaction with patient care is quite high, it may be hard to demonstrate substantial improvement after interventions.",
