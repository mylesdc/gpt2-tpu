[31] [32] [33] [34] The 7 non-influenza respiratory viruses used in this study were selected based on historical data demonstrating their potential involvement in respiratory infections, as well as their potential for future vaccine development. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] Of the 7 viruses, significant progress has been made toward RSV vaccine development; however, despite several potential candidates, some of which advanced to clinical trials, no vaccine so far is both safe and effective. 40 Establishing baseline data for these viruses in people with SARI helps to provide evidence to GDPM to guide public health decision-making. ters. 41 In addition, healthcare utilization is reported to be 3-4 times higher in urban areas than in the mountainous regions in the north or central regions of the country. 42 In spite of these limitations, the existence of a SARI surveillance network in Vietnam provided a platform for collecting data on important non-influenza respiratory viruses, and the process of expanding the system offered an opportunity to revisit the data collection and analysis practices that were routine for SARI surveillance. As a multistep process, the expansion and strengthening of SARI surveillance continued to develop throughout 2016 and 2017, and will likely continue to improve with further attention and refinement to the system. The future integration of the expanded SARI surveillance data into the GDPM data warehouse offers additional potential benefit of reduced delays due to data sharing, reduced need for manual data curation, as well as provision of data to the public health emergency operation center for routine data analysis. 17 The process of expanding SARI surveillance to test for noninfluenza respiratory viruses has engaged numerous organizations in Vietnam ranging from sentinel hospitals, RIs to GDPM and international donor organizations. Additionally, in the era of GHSA the study demonstrates an ability to enhance and expand surveillance by building and extending upon existing in-country capacities.",

Because some of the SARI sites were pediatric hospitals, the age distribution was skewed, and 52.1% of the SARI specimens tested were in patients <5 years. This age distribution may have biased the results toward increased RSV detection. In addition, despite finding a large proportion of SARI specimens positive for RSV, it is not well understood whether the SARI case definition is appropriate for RSV,43 and because of this, some proportion of RSV cases may have been missed. Future research on non-influenza respiratory viruses in Vietnam should attempt to calculate the burden of disease as well as to improve the understanding of patient clinical profiles associated with them. In addition, while the process of expanded SARI surveillance has improved Vietnam's ability to collect and analyze data on noninfluenza respiratory viruses, the operational costs required to sustain SARI surveillance in Vietnam are not negligible. Costs included the organization of epidemiologic and laboratory trainings, collection materials, transportation costs, laboratory reagents, human resources, and support for supervisory visits. During the expansion of the SARI surveillance platform, interruptions in funding caused delays at sentinel sites in procurement of sampling supplies; and occasionally, such interruptions halted SARI surveillance data collection at sites altogether. Delays in data reporting from the RIs in some cases hindered data aggregation and the weekly surveillance reports, although limited human resources also contributed to occasional gaps in weekly report distribution. Identifying sustainable financial support mechanisms to ensure future surveillance for SARI is currently being discussed by all parties.
