In developing areas in Africa, Asia and South-America, Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi are an important cause of severe illness, leading to more than 20 million cases and 200.000 deaths in children and young people every year [2] . A typical Salmonella infection can lead to fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and headache. Symptoms usually appear between 24 to 48 hours after eating contaminated food, and last three to seven days. The incidence rate of Salmonella is highest among infants and young children. As there are many different types of food-borne Salmonella, each with their own food sources, control is difficult. Proper hygiene in the kitchen (e.g., washing hands, thoroughly heating and baking meat) can prevent a Salmonella infection. However, studies among the general public in Italy [3] , Turkey [4] and New Zealand [5] showed that compliance with preventive hygiene advice is low to very low. A possible explanation is that most people believe that a food-borne infection is \"something that happens to others\" [6, 7] .",

According to Medeiros and colleagues [8] , food-borne Salmonella infections should be prevented by educating the general public about adequate cooking of food, and by instructing them about the risks of cross-contamination. Traditional communication means, such as flyers, are well suited to achieve these educational goals [9] . However, when a food-borne infection breaks out on a large scale, the dynamics of the situation shift tremendously. Due to an uncertain course of events, decisions have large consequences, the general public is stressed, and the media is eager for news [10] . In these circumstances, health organizations should inform the public about the situation and persuade them to take preventive actions. To be effective in this endeavor, they should use the communication channels the general public expects them to use, and provide the public with the information they want and need. A study among Malaysians during the A(H1N1) influenza outbreak in 2009, uncovered that their main sources of information were newspapers, television and family members; their information needs were instructions on how to prevent or treat infections [11] . In the Netherlands, the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and the 2011 Enterohaemorrhagic E. Coli (EHEC) outbreak showed us that the Dutch general public mostly turns to traditional media (i.e., television and radio), and news websites [12, 13] .",

By September 28, all smoked salmon of this producer was recalled. In the following week, other products containing this producer's smoked salmon (e.g., salads) were also recalled. Citizens were advised to check the batch number of their products and to dispose of possible contaminated products. After implementing those measures, the number of cases decreased rapidly and by the end of 2012, the outbreak came to an end. 1,149 laboratory-confirmed patients and four deaths were reported [16] . The actual number of patients is thought to be higher, as individual cases of Salmonella gastro-enteritis are not mandatory notifiable in the Netherlands and laboratory confirmation usually merely takes place in a fraction of all patients presenting with diarrhea. According to Dutch standards, this situation classifies as a large-scale outbreak, as it is an occurrence of disease greater than would otherwise be expected at a particular time and place. Normally around four cases of Salmonella Thompson are seen in the Netherlands per year.",

Next, mean scores were computed for the aforementioned psychological rating scales, while the statements for assessing knowledge about Salmonella infections resulted in a sum score (ranging from 0 to 9, where 0 is no knowledge and 9 is very high knowledge). To establish the influence of factors determining respondents' application of preventive measures during the outbreak (dependent variable), we performed stepwise backward regression analyses. Following [22] [23] [24] , we included the following independent variables in the initial model: the demographics age, education, income and sex, and the factors perceived severity of a Salmonella infection, perceived severity of the outbreak, knowledge about Salmonella infections, and increased general kitchen hygiene during the outbreak. Education was recoded into a new variable with three options: Low, middle or high, while sex was included in the regression analyses as a dummy variable. These actions make it possible to include these nominal variables in this kind of regression analysis. Factors were removed from the model if p > .10. The procedure was repeated for determining the factors that influence the consumption of information about the 2012 Salmonella outbreak for different media. Here, consumption of information on a medium was the dependent variable for the different models (each model explaining the information consumption for a specific medium.). We included the following independent variables in the initial models: the demographics age, having children, education, income, and sex (based on [18, 19] ), as well as the factors perceived severity of a Salmonella infection, perceived severity of the Salmonella outbreak, knowledge about Salmonella infections, interest in health information, and perceived health (based on [18] ), as well as the application of measures to prevent a Salmonella infection, and increased carefulness with preparing food (following [25] ). For the variables using Twitter or not, and having children or not, we also created a dummy variable. These analyses allowed us to formulate recommendations in line with our main research question:",

However, in both cases standard deviations are quite high, implying that there were people who increased their kitchen hygiene tremendously, and people who absolutely did not. Our regression analysis showed that the application of preventive measures (dependent variable) was influenced by increased general kitchen hygiene during the outbreak (\u03b2 = .61; p < .001), by perceived severity of the outbreak (\u03b2 = .19; p < .001), and by the demographics income (\u03b2 = .07; p < .01) and sex (higher for women; \u03b2 = .05; p < .05). A significant beta means that a factor influences the dependent variable (in this case application of preventive measures). A low beta stands for a small influence, a high beta for a large influence. In this case, the betas show that four factors influence the application of preventive measures; of which increased general kitchen hygiene is by far the greatest influence. Explained variance (R 2 ) for the model was .51 (which means that the dependent variable is explained for a large part by the identified independent variables, but also by some, as of yet, unidentified variables).",

In other words, a person is exposed to information without a direct and specific need for this information. Active information is caused by a question or explicit need for information, after which a person actively seeks out information.

This suggests that being careful to avoid a foodborne infection during an outbreak is primarily done by people who are already concerned about food safety.

A higher interest in health information also resulted in more outbreakrelated information consumption. However, this could also be due to a recall bias, as those interested in such information might more easily remember receiving it. Other predictors played no or a marginal role, with the exception of lower age for the popular Dutch news website nu.nl. Only a small sample of our respondents actively searched for information about Salmonella or the outbreak. Those who did mostly turned to the Internet. There, they consulted multiple sources, found through a Google search or by entering the URL, like national food safety institutes, online newspapers, websites of Municipal Health Services, and Wikipedia. The latter has also been found to be an important source of information during other infectious disease outbreaks [13, 28] . It should be noted, however, that the popularity of Wikipedia could be due to the high ranks it receives in Google. The website of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (the Dutch equivalent of the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) was consulted less than the aforementioned sources. This implies that such national institutes should not solely rely on their own communication efforts, but they should collaborate with local health organizations, and they should contribute to relevant Wikipedia articles. There has been some debate, however, concerning the quality of Wikipedia articles for the goal of public health education, and studies on this matter show mixed results. The quality of medical Wikipedia articles has been found to be good but inferior to official patient information [29] , of similar quality as official patient information [30] , or incomplete, which might have harmful effects [31] . These results imply that if health organizations decide to use Wikipedia to inform the public during a large-scale Salmonella outbreak, they should make a continuous effort to continuously monitor the relevant articles and to improve their quality.",

While this allows for a good retrospective view, the general public's perceptions and behavior may evolve during an outbreak. Different phases induce different information needs, related to the uncertainties of the situation (e.g., fear may play a bigger role when the outbreak source is still unknown) [32] . A longitudinal setup would provide insight in these developments, and it would be an interesting direction for future research. Second, the number of people in our study that actively searched for more information or for answers to their questions was relatively low. It is therefore difficult to base generalizable conclusions on these results, and our efforts should be viewed as explorative. They do provide valuable input for in-depth studies aimed at assessing people's outbreak-related information seeking processes. Such studies have already generated important insights for the health domain (e.g., [33] ). But it is also possible that, in this context, people actively searching for more information is a rarity, possibly due to the fact that the information provided by the different media is perceived as adequate. Other studies should acknowledge or refute this thesis. Finally, our study was restricted to the Dutch general public. We do not have any indications that these results would not hold for other western European countries, but these should be validated for countries where the process of outbreak-related information provision and the Internet penetration rate are fundamentally different.",

Health organizations should use traditional media, and news and newspaper websites to inform the public, and to persuade them to take preventive actions. They should increase knowledge about Salmonella infections, and stimulate citizens to check for possibly contaminated products at their home, and to increase kitchen hygiene.",

Furthermore, studies assessing the quality and completeness of health-related Wikipedia articles can be very valuable in helping health organizations decide on which articles they should use or improve the quality of.
