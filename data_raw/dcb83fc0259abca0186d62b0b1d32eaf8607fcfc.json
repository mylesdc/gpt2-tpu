Several studies have confirmed that SOCS3 is increased in asthmatic patients, and SOCS3 expression is correlated with disease severity. The objective of this study was to evaluate if delivering of SOCS3 short interfering RNA (siRNA) intranasally in lungs could be a good therapeutic approach in an asthma chronic mouse model. Our results showed that intranasal treatment with SOCS3-siRNA led to an improvement in the eosinophil count and the normalization of hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. Concomitantly, this treatment resulted in an improvement in mucus secretion, a reduction in lung collagen, which are prominent features of airway remodeling. The mechanism implies JAK/STAT and RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathway, because we found a decreasing in STAT3 phosphorylation status and down regulation of RhoA/Rho-kinase protein expression. These results might lead to a new therapy for the treatment of chronic asthma.",

SOCS3 is an inhibitor that is relatively specific to STAT3; in addition, it can inhibit other signaling pathways such as Ras/ERK and PI3K, which affect cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation [5, 6] . Th2 cells contain high levels of SOCS3 proteins. Our group has recently described and increased SOCS3 expression in eosinophils from asthmatic patients [7] .",

In animal models of allergic bronchial asthma it has been shown that RhoA mediates the augmentation of bronchial smooth muscle contractility, which is one of the causes of AHR. Recently, ROCK has been involved in the regulation of allergic inflammation [19] . In fact, ROCK inhibitors have been tested as potential treatments for AHR in asthma [20] . Moreover, it has been described that IL-13 as well as IL-4 augment bronchial smooth muscle contractility with an up-regulation of RhoA protein, in the case of IL-4 probably through STAT6 activation [21] [22] [23] [24] . With our treatment, we have reduced both cytokines and thus we have controlled the smooth muscle activation and therefore AHR.",

These two different approaches have lead to different results.
