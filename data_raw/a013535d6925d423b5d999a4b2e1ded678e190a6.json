In recent years, over 2 million people from 140 countries undertook the Hajj annually, including over 200,000 people from Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim majority country. Performance of the Hajj and its rites is physically demanding [2] . Extreme physical stressors such as sun exposure, heat (37\u00b0C during the day and 20\u00b0C at night), thirst, crowding, steep inclines and traffic congestions over a prolonged period of time (40 days per pilgrim over the 70-day Hajj season) increase health risks. Since pilgrims tend to be older and many have medical comorbidities [3] , these factors exacerbate existing risk for ischemic and congestive cardiovascular disease, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, and respiratory and other infectious diseases including emerging diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus [4] .",

Mortality surveillance was also established to reduce mortality and aid in administrative processes for life insurance claims. Prior to 2008, the patterns, causes of death and factors associated with mortality were not well understood for Indonesian pilgrims. Data collected were limited to basic demographic characteristics and general cause of death. Cause of death could only be obtained from the hospital death certificate or the flight doctor's records if a death occurred in the community. These were based on clinical examination and any available laboratory tests as documented in the patient medical record, but they lacked detailed information about the cause of death or the patient's pre-existing conditions.",

Verbal autopsy allows for the systematic investigation of probable causes of death through structured questionnaires [9] . The World Health Organization (WHO) advocates the use of verbal autopsy in situations where only a fraction of deaths occur in hospitals or in absence of vital registration systems [10] . Previous studies have shown that verbal autopsy improves diagnosis of cause of mortality and the method continues to be used in various countries [11] [12] [13] .",

This study compared cause of death according to the flight doctor and death certificate records to the newly introduced verbal autopsy method. Fewer deaths were attributed to cardiovascular diseases using verbal autopsy but this method resulted in a greater number of deaths having ill-defined cause of death. Verbal autopsy method may have reduced misclassification by removing pressure from clinicians having to extrapolate cause of death in situations where it may have been ill-defined or unclear. However, this hypothesis warrants further investigation. Since the verbal autopsy method is dependent on the skills of the field personnel collecting the data, the timing to limit recall bias and the method is most suited to diseases with specific symptoms and presentation [10, 19] , the use of verbal autopsy for Hajj mortality surveillance should be further evaluated.",

            "text": "Based on both the death certificates and verbal autopsy categories, cardiovascular disease was the leading cause of Indonesian pilgrim mortality in 2008. Performance of obligatory rites during the Hajj constitutes stressful exercise which is not generally recommended by doctors for those with ischemic heart disease, hypertension or heart failure as such exercise may increase the risk of heart attacks [20] . This risk may be further elevated in the heat, where dehydration may lead to increase in body temperature and heart rate, and a decrease in cardiac output [21] . An Iranian study showed that when patients with severe cardiovascular disease were prohibited from attending the Hajj and other patients with cardiovascular disease were provided with appropriate medications and monitoring during pilgrimage, mortality rates were significantly lower than those for other pilgrims [7] . This supports the need for careful pre-departure health screening, exclusion of the severely ill, provision of appropriate drug therapies or increased physical exercise prior to departure, and monitoring during pilgrimage to reduce mortality. One-third of Indonesian pilgrim mortality was attributed to respiratory diseases. Pneumonia is a common illness that is life-threatening to the elderly, especially those with comorbidities such as diabetes or hypertension [4] . A number of studies have shown that pneumonia is the primary cause of critical illness during the Hajj and that etiologies include Gramnegative organisms, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis [2, 18, 22] . For tuberculosis patients, the physical stressors of the Hajj may increase the risk of severe illness and mortality, and the intense crowding during the pilgrimage may increase the risk of disease transmission. A recent study found that 10% of Malaysian pilgrims had a significant increase in immune response to QuantiFERON tuberculosis assay antigen post-Hajj compared to pre-Hajj [23] . Since Indonesia is a high-burden country for tuberculosis [24] , pre-departure screening should continue to exclude those with active disease. Other potential public health measures to reduce mortality due to respiratory diseases include increasing coverage of influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine. Such measures were applied by Iranian public health authorities in 2005, which halved the incidence of respiratory diseases and decreased the mortality rates from 47 per 100,000 in 2004 to 24 per 100,000 in 2005 [6] .",

These may have been too strenuous for some pilgrims, especially older or relatively sedentary pilgrims. Surprisingly, 36% of deaths occurred in the accommodation provided to pilgrims during the Hajj. This highlights that despite the presence of an accompanying health team, not all patients were referred to hospital prior to critical stages of illness. One limitation of this study is that further details about deaths occurring in accommodation were not available for analysis. Lack of data limited other important analyses including deaths by health risk status and type of travel service (government or private) used.

This study highlights the importance of surveillance during the Hajj to understand the health risks and strengthen the evidencebase on which policy can be developed [2] . Further studies are needed to assess verbal autopsy's utility in this setting. The role of the accompanying health teams as first responders needs to be reviewed to determine how they can best reduce Indonesian pilgrim mortality. An evaluation of the current mortality surveillance system is also warranted to ensure that the data collected appropriately serves the public health purpose of reducing pilgrim mortality. Lastly, lessons need to be learnt from other countries including their Hajj mortality patterns and risk mitigation strategies. ",
