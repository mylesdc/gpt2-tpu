We examined the extent of exhaled air dispersion from a human-patient-simulator during mask ventilation by different groups of healthcare workers and coughing bouts. The simulator was programmed to mimic varying severity of lung injury. Exhaled airflow was marked with tiny smoke particles, and highlighted by laser light-sheet. We determined the normalized exhaled air concentration in the leakage jet plume from the light scattered by smoke particles. Smoke concentration \u226520% was considered as significant exposure. Exhaled air leaked from mask-face interface in the transverse plane was most severe (267 \u00b1 44 mm) with Ambu silicone resuscitator performed by nurses. Dispersion was however similar among anesthesiologists/ intensivists, respiratory physicians and medical students using Ambu or Laerdal silicone resuscitator, p = 0.974. The largest dispersion was 860 \u00b1 93 mm during normal coughing effort without tracheal intubation and decreased with worsening coughing efforts. Oro-tracheal suctioning reduced dispersion significantly, p < 0.001, and was more effective when applied continuously. Skills to ensure good fit during mask ventilation are important in preventing air leakage through the mask-face interface. Continuous oro-tracheal suctioning minimized exhaled air dispersion during coughing bouts when performing aerosol-generating procedures.",

Supplemental oxygen, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and occasionally invasive mechanical ventilation are required for managing these patients 1-5 . During the major outbreak of SARS, it was found that procedures related to tracheal intubation 6 , oxygen administration \u22656 L/min, and NIV were independent risk factors for super-spreading nosocomial outbreaks affecting many healthcare workers in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China 7 . In a systematic review of aerosol generating procedures that might increase the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS to healthcare workers, mask ventilation and oro-tracheal suctioning increased the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals, CI) to 2.8 (1.3-6.4) and 6.2 (2.2-18.1), respectively 8 . In this respect, we have previously shown that the dispersion distances of exhaled plume along the sagittal and transverse planes were 200 and 220 mm, respectively, when bag-mask ventilation was attempted in a human-patient-simulator (HPS) 9 . Although the addition of a viral-bacterial filter eliminated forward leakage of exhaled air from the expiration diverter, leakage at the interface between the mask and the patient's face was increased to 340 mm along the transverse plane. It is unclear if the increased leakage along the transverse plane was due to the higher resistance with the filter or related to inefficient mask seal 9 . In addition, oro-tracheal suctioning may trigger coughing bouts that could further increase the spread of potentially infectious droplets. However, effective suction may limit the dispersion. Further studies are therefore required to examine if there are technical or human factors involved that",

Figure 1 displays the typical images of exhaled air leakage through the face and mask interface in the transverse plane during bag-mask ventilation. The mean dispersion distances in the transverse plane are summarized in Table 1 . In this analysis, nurses produced larger leak than other healthcare workers. The mean difference (95% CI) between nurses and anesthesiologists/intensivists, respiratory physicians or medical students, adjusted for the devices used, were 69 (42-96) mm, 72 (45-99) mm and 67 (40-94) mm, respectively, all p < 0.001 (Supplementary Table 1 ). Dispersion distances were however similar among anesthesiologists/intensivists, respiratory physicians and medical students, p = 0.974. Overall, use of Laerdal silicone resuscitator produced less dispersion compared with Ambu silicone resuscitator, mean difference (95% CI) was 44 (21-68) mm, p < 0.001. The addition of breathing filter to the Ambu silicone resuscitator reduced leak among anesthesiologists/intensivists, p < 0.001, respiratory physicians, p = 0.009 and medical students, p = 0.011, but not with nurses, p > 0.999 (Supplementary Table 2 ).

Results of exhaled air dispersion in the sagittal plane during normal, mild and poor coughing efforts generated by short bursts of oxygen flow at 650, 320, and 220 L/min, respectively, in a human patient simulator with continuous (panels A-C), intermittent oral suctioning (panels D-F) and without oral suctioning (panels G-I). Coughing bouts during oro-tracheal suctioning. We then showed that exhaled air dispersion decreased with worsening coughing efforts (Figs 2 and 3). Before tracheal intubation, exhaled air leaked through the mouth to a distance of 860 \u00b1 93 mm during normal cough. This was reduced to 298 \u00b1 43 mm in mild coughing effort and 185 \u00b1 19 mm with poor coughing effort, p < 0.001. Following tracheal intubation, the dispersion distance of exhaled air after a normal cough was 460 \u00b1 127 mm. This was decreased to a distance of 305 \u00b1 77 mm in mild coughing effort and 188 \u00b1 63 mm in poor coughing effort, p < 0.001 (Supplementary Table 3 ). In cases without tracheal intubation, continuous suctioning reduced spread better than intermittent suctioning, adjusted for coughing efforts, p < 0.001, (Fig. 4 , Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 ). For example, exhaled air dispersion distance without intubation during normal coughing efforts was 708 \u00b1 105 mm with intermittent suctioning vs 595 \u00b1 122 mm with continuous suctioning (p = 0.005). On average, suctioning decreased exhaled air dispersion by >32% (range: 8.2-73.0%, Supplementary Table 4 ). There was interaction between coughing efforts and suctioning, p < 0.001.",

Nevertheless, suctioning reduced the spread of exhaled air during coughing bouts by >32% whereas continuous suctioning could reduce exhaled air distances more effectively than intermittent suctioning. Among the respiratory procedures, tracheal intubation per se or in combination with other procedures (e.g. cardiopulmonary resuscitation or bronchoscopy) was consistently associated with an increased risk of infection transmission through aerosol generation 17 . A study that measured the amount of influenza A(H1N1)2009 RNA in aerosols in the vicinity of H1N1 positive patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures showed that bronchoscopy and respiratory and airway suctioning were the most definite procedures to produce aerosols above background baseline values 18 . A study of symptomatic adult outpatients has shown that a significant proportion of patients with influenza A could release small airborne particles containing viable virus into the environment through coughing 19 . Another study testing quantitative impaction air samples, which were taken at various distances from patients infected with influenza, by rapid test and polymerase chain reaction has shown that healthcare workers within 1.83 m of patients with influenza could be exposed to infectious doses of influenza virus, primarily in small-particle aerosols (diameter, <4.7 \u00b5m) without aerosol-generating procedures whereas influenza virus release was associated with high viral loads in nasopharyngeal samples (shedding), coughing, and sneezing 20 . Our data highlight the importance of continuous suctioning to reduce the spread of aerosols when performing aerosol-generating procedures. In this respect, open airway toileting should be performed with continuous suctioning when closed circuit suctioning is not available on the medical wards for patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology.",

We analyzed the image frames from the beginning of coughing or inspiration during each ventilation. Intensity analysis was performed on individual frame stored in gray scale bitmap format. In this analysis, we subtracted the background intensity with images taken with the laser turned off. Light intensity was then averaged over all frames. The resulting image was the total scattered light intensity and was proportional to the smoke particle concentration. This was then normalized against the spot with the highest intensity in the exhaled jet plume to produce a contour map showing normalized particle concentration [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] 21 . Given that the smoke particles originated from the lungs and airway, the concentration contour indicated the probability of encountering potentially infected exhaled air that came from within the mask or patient's respiratory system. In this respect, a 0 value indicated a region with no measurable smoke particle or exhaled air 10-16,21 . Statistical analysis. The dispersion distance was expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. A general linear model was used to compare the difference in exhaled air dispersion among different mask ventilation systems (Laerdal and Ambu resuscitator with or without breathing filter) and that performed by different groups of healthcare workers (anesthesiologists/intensivists, respiratory physicians, nurses, or medical students).",
