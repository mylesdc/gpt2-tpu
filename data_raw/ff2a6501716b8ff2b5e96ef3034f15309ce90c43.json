            "text": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic often occurs through the persistence of injection drug use. Mathematical models have been useful in understanding various aspects of the HCV epidemic, and especially, the importance of new treatment measures. Until now, however, few models have attempted to understand HCV in terms of an interaction between the various actors in an HCV outbreak-hosts, viruses and the needle injection equipment. In this study, we apply perspectives from the ecology of infectious diseases to model the transmission of HCV among a population of injection drug users. The products of our model suggest that modelling HCV as an indirectly transmitted infection-where the injection equipment serves as an environmental reservoir for infection-facilitates a more nuanced understanding of disease dynamics, by animating the underappreciated actors and interactions that frame disease. This lens may allow us to understand how certain public health interventions (e.g. needle exchange programmes) influence HCV epidemics. Lastly, we argue that this model is of particular importance in the light of the modern opioid epidemic, which has already been associated with outbreaks of viral diseases.",

One example is the importance of the free-living survival stage of certain pathogens, where diseases are transmitted indirectly between hosts through an environmental reservoir intermediate. These include infections transmitted indirectly between hosts via a surface or reservoir intermediateoften abiotic-where the pathogen lives freely and independently of a host [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , sometimes described as 'sit and wait' infections [19] . Other studies have focused on systems where pathogens are growing in the environment [9] , or have explored indirectly transmitted infections in theoretical terms [12, 15] . While frameworks already exist for studying indirect environmental transmission, most are engineered with constraints that render their application necessarily narrow [6] , limiting their relevance for a wider number of indirectly transmitted infections.",

            "text": "One class of diseases where the indirect transmission paradigm has been scarcely applied are those spread through injection drug use in urban settings, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). HIV has been the object of many important mathematical models [20, 21] , some of which have implemented injection drug use effectively, even focusing on the specific dynamics of injection equipment [22] [23] [24] [25] . HCV has also been studied using modelling methods, many focusing on treatment [26] [27] [28] and others on the particulars of transmission in injection drug-user communities [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Importantly, none of these existing dynamical models consider the peculiar ecology of HCV transmission, where transmission events occur through an environmental reservoir (injection equipment) that resembles a disease vector [36, 37] . Unlike an insect vector, however, injection equipment is not an organism and is more realistically considered an abiotic reservoir for infection, similar to the role that the water supply serves in an outbreak of cholera or other waterborne diseases [38] . As HCV continues to pose a serious public health challenge in many communities, there is a need to understand how the dynamics of injection equipment influence HCV transmission. This is especially important for informing the utility of harm reduction programmes, such as needle exchange, which have been effective in decreasing transmission of HIV and HCV [39, 40] . Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, the urgency for understanding these dynamics has increased dramatically in recent years with the growth of the modern opioid epidemic, much of it involving injection drug use [41, 42] . The lack of models of HCV that specifically consider injection equipment, and increased social urgency related to the modern opioid epidemic implore more adaptable mathematical models of injectiondrug use that could facilitate a better understanding of and predictions for the trajectory of modern HCV infections.",

In this specific example, the W i compartment contributes to the rate of infection as a fraction, W i /(W i + W u ), which appears as a factor in the rate terms. The epidemic is then driven by a series of interactions: between uninfected (susceptible) hosts S and the infected (transmitting) environmental compartment W i , and interactions between infected individuals I and the uninfected environmental compartment W u . The epidemic is sustained through infected hosts I depositing pathogen into the environmental reservoir, creating new infections, which can then infect more susceptible hosts S (in a process resembling a feedback loop).

That is, removing infected needles at an increased rate may decrease infection risk in a population of PWID, while removing uninfected needles can increase the risk. One can also see that increasing k u and k i simultaneously, along the dashed linewhere k u = k i -will increase R 0 . This suggests that if a distinction between infected and uninfected needles cannot be established (as is often the case) then discarding needles indiscriminately can potentially exacerbate the spread of the infection.

            "text": "While diseases transmitted through injection drug use have been the object of prior modelling efforts, none have specifically investigated how injection equipment plays a role in the dynamics of HCV. Prior models of injection equipment have focused on HIV [24, 25] , and/or been so complicated that their structure is not easily translated to any other settings [23] . In this study, we model HCV as an indirectly transmitted infection, where the injection equipment is modelled as the environmental reservoir, just as a water source might be modelled in a waterborne infection [8, 19] . We label our approach as the W.A.I.T. model, one that incorporates features of other approaches to studying environmentally transmitted pathogens [6, 11] , but grounding them in a flexible model that can be neatly applied to HCV. Our approach offers several specific insights. For example, we demonstrate that the composite R 0 that defines the entire dynamical system is the geometric mean of R 0 values used to describe each of two sub-components: disease flow through the hosts and flow through the injection equipment (equation (3.7) ). This observation offers a practical suggestion for studying diseases like HCV: epidemiologists and modellers must understand, through empirical studies, properties of all major actors in the system (hosts and environmental injection drug equipment in the case of HCV). The mathematical model of HCV presented in this paper (described as a W.A.I.T. model; see \u00a7 \u00a72 and 3) also offers nuanced findings about the dynamics of disease. Firstly, our model highlights the differing roles of uninfected and infected injection on disease dynamics. Specifically, the model speaks to the potential utility of harm reduction policies: indiscriminately removing injection equipment from a system-without an overall shift in needle populations from infected to uninfected-might increase the rate of infection. In order to attenuate an epidemic, intervention strategies should focus on steering the population of needles towards being more uninfected. Therefore, ideal intervention efforts should aim to decrease sharing events on an infected needle. This helps to explain why programmes like safe injection might be effective [61] : they do not change the number of infected needles in the system directly, but can alter the sharing rate, and consequently, the probability of sharing an infected needle.",

This epidemic is typified by recreational use of prescription and illicit opioids, with injection drug use being a major route through which drugs are consumed [42] . The relevance of viral diseases among opioid users gained national attention during a 2015 outbreak of HIV in rural Indiana that was driven by an injected opioid called oxymorphone [62, 63] . This outbreak raised alarms in the public health community, and officials are increasingly aware of the potential for future outbreaks. However, it was not until relatively recently that the role of the opioid crisis in HCV transmission has been examined [64, 65] . We propose, in closing, that modelling approaches (in general, and not relegated to the methods proposed in this study) are crucial for understanding, attenuating or preventing explosive outbreaks of HCV in an age when a new opioid epidemic has emerged.

HCV W.A.I.T. model: analytic equations and parameters The dynamics of the HCV transmission process are governed by equations (3.1)-(3.5). The population of individuals that are being treated and those who have recovered are not explicitly modelled in this iteration, as the dynamics of treatment and recovery are not central to the questions explored in this study. There are, however, several modelling studies of HCV that focus on treatment [26-28,49], and their effects are not ignored in the HCV W.A.I.T. model. Entering treatment (and re-entering the susceptible population, as in case of drug relapse in the PWID population) are incorporated via removal terms \u2212\u03c4I L and \u2212\u03c4I E and the susceptible 'birth' term \u03c0 S .",
