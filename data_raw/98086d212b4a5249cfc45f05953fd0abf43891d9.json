Both English and Chinese literature was searched and diseases were categorised according to the type of disease or transmission route. Temporal trends of morbidity and mortality rates were calculated for eight major infectious diseases types. Strong government commitment to public health responses and improvements in quality of life has led to the eradication or containment of a wide range of infectious diseases in China. The overall infectious diseases burden experienced a dramatic drop during 1975-1995, but since then, it reverted and maintained a gradual upward trend to date. Most notifiable diseases are contained at a low endemic level; however, local small-scale outbreaks remain common. Tuberculosis, as a bacterial infection, has re-emerged since the 1990s and has become prevalent in the country. Sexually transmitted infections are in a rapid, exponential growth phase, spreading from core groups to the general population. Together human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), they account for 39% of all death cases due to infectious diseases in China in 2008. Zoonotic infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), rabies and influenza, pose constant threats to Chinese residents and remain the most deadly disease type among the infected individuals. Therefore, second-generation surveillance of behavioural risks or vectors associated with pathogen transmission should be scaled up. It is necessary to implement public health interventions that target HIV and relevant coinfections, address transmission associated with highly mobile populations, and reduce the risk of cross-species transmission of zoonotic pathogens.",

            "text": "Surveillance systems for infectious diseases in China are mainly hospital based. The latest available statistics (from 2006) indicate that China has 18,703 county hospitals, 40,907 township hospitals and 201,562 medical clinics [4, 5] . Hospitals at the prefecture level or above are usually equipped with reference laboratories that are capable of carrying out molecular surveillance for cases. Together with laboratories from academic institutions, they form the front line of surveillance for outbreak detection and notification of infectious diseases in China. All hospitals and clinics are obliged to report both suspected and confirmed cases of notifiable infectious disease to their nominated county Centre for Disease Control (CDC). After recording the details of the reported cases (including their geographical location, demographicl information and infection status), county CDCs send the information to the country's central CDC, through the National Infectious Diseases Monitoring Information System Database, which was established in 2004 [6] . This reporting mechanism bypasses the previous stepwise hierarchical reporting framework, thus allowing information to flow directly from grassroots CDCs to China's central disease database. However, regional, provincial and national CDCs do not have equal access to all of the data in the database: their access rights are limited to their own administrative regions, and only national CDCs has the full access to all data [7] . In addition to their responsibility for verifying the disease information from their administrative regions, municipal and provincial CDCs are required to report to the appropriate level of the Bureaus of Health or Department of Health and to form networks with local research bodies, universities and other health organisations. At the top of the hierarchy, China's central CDC is the overseeing organisation with responsibility for assembling and analysing diagnostic data for all diseases and then presenting a final report to the Ministry of Health, which is the main public health policymaker in China. The central CDC is also the only legitimate office for disseminating infectious disease information to the public, but provincial and municipal CDCs are also authorised to publicise the information to people in their jurisdiction, under the supervision of the Ministry of Health [8] . In contrast to disease surveillance systems in Europe, the Chinese surveillance system uses a multilayer administrative mechanism that enables rapid and efficient upward flow of epidemic information.",

From 1950 to 1954, the mean number of annual notifications of plague infection was 1,373 cases per year [11, 12] . This was then substantially reduced to 20 cases per year over the following 30 to 40 years.

The rate then gradually subsided but there was a second major outbreak in the early 1990s.

Measles mortality and morbidity has declined continuously and substantially since 1978. During 1995 to 2007, the incidence was less than one per 100,000 population (Figure 2b), with fewer than 250 deaths due to measles reported annually [17] . However, limited small-scale outbreaks continue to occur among susceptible children in rural areas with low routine immunisation coverage and among susceptible children of 'floating immigrants' (the relatively large population of internal Chinese immigrants who leave their rural hometown and move to urban areas to seek better employment opportunities) [18] . In addition, although a two-dose measles vaccination schedule has been recommended in China since 1986, the second dose is widely perceived as a nonmandatory booster. Coverage of the second dose is not reported, but is thought to be low [19] .",

It is estimated that polio vaccination alone has saved a total of 1,128,000 children in China from disabling disease and suffering [24] .

In 1955, a total of 5,970,000 malaria cases were reported nationally, accounting for 68% of the total number of reported infectious disease cases and an incidence of 1,028 per 100,000 population. Malaria disproportionately affected some regions, with incidence rates as high as 10,360 per 100,000 population in Hainan province [29] . In 1960 and 1970, there were major outbreaks of the disease, leading to a national incidence of 1,554 and 2,961, respectively, per 100,000 population [29] . It took considerable time for the incidence to fall: the number of cases did not decrease to 1955 levels until 1982, but it has since continued to decrease. By 1998, the rate of notifications decreased to 31.3 per 100,000 population, corresponding to more than a 99% reduction and accounting for only 1.3% of the total number of reported cases of notifiable conditions [29] . Data for 2004 to 2008 indicate that the mean annual mortality rate due to malaria was reduced to 0.004 per 100,000 population (Table 2) , corresponding to only 52 reported deaths per year countrywide. Malaria no longer represents a major threat to the Chinese population. The ongoing governmentmobilised mass movement for vector control is probably an effective method for eliminating mosquitoes and their habitats and consequently reducing the disease burden due to malaria in the country. The universal healthcare system provided an effective base for the implementation of countrywide interventions [6] .",

During a 58-year period between 1950 and 2007, a total of 117,530 human rabies cases were reported, corresponding to an incidence rate of 9.1 cases per 100,000 population. Three major epidemics were observed [31, 32] : the first occurred in the mid-1950s when the annual number of reported cases reached a peak of about 2,000. The epidemic subsided in the 1960s and then started to surge again in the early 1970s. After reaching a sustained peak from 1982 until the end of the decade, at a level of 5,000 to 6,000 cases per year [33] , in 1996 the number of cases was at its lowest, with 159 reported cases [33] . As the disease in humans is closely associated with transmission of rabies virus by infected dogs, in the past epidemics, strict policies for vaccination of owned dogs and elimination of stray dogs were put in place, resulting in effective control of the epidemic. However, since 2000, due to a new wave of rapid expansion of the pet dog population in urban China, there has been a third outbreak, in which the number of cases has increased rapidly: in 2007, the number of notified cases climbed to 3,250 [34, 35] . The rabies-related mortality rate increased during 1999 to 2008 by a mean of 26% (95% CI, 14-37%) per year ( Table 2 ). This should serve as a call for action to prevent the further spread of rabies in China.",

Special institutions for treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), at the time mostly syphilis, gonorrhoea and Chlamydia, were established for the training of medical personnel, who were then sent to areas previously associated with large sex industries to treat STIs at beginning of 1950s. During 1950s, a universal healthcare system was established that provides treatment for STI patients free of charge. Designated laboratories for STIs were built for diagnosis and research [51] . More importantly, population-based health education campaigns about STIs were carried out, and detection and treatment of STIs were portrayed as patriotic actions [52] . As a result, the number of cases of notifiable STIs decreased from 10 million in 1950 to reportedly eliminated from 1964 [51, 53, 54] . However, notifiable STIs have re-emerged, leading to a fastspreading epidemic in the country. In 1987, the incidence for STIs was 6.64 per 100,000 population and in 1996, the rate increased to 34.6 per 100,000 population, which corresponded to 1.8 million new STI cases [52] . The annual growth rate of the number of STI cases in China exceeds 20% [52] . The rise of STI incidence is mainly due to unprotected sexual acts and other high-risk behaviours [55, 56] .",

The number of Chinese men, increased purchasing power of urban residents and trends away from traditional Chinese family values of fidelity all led to an increased number of male clients for commercial sexual services [58] . In addition, lack of sexual health knowledge among commercial sex workers and their inability to effectively negotiate condom use during sexual acts substantially increased the risk of STI transmission [57, 59] . The previously hidden population of men who have sex men (MSM) is becoming more overt due to increasing acceptance in society. High-risk sexual behaviours, including a low percentage of condom use, in this population is also contributing to the fast transmission of STIs [60] . For example, in 1998, the incidence of syphilis in China was 0.17 per 100,000 population: it increased 20-fold to 4.31 cases per 100,000 population in 2002 and further to 15.88 cases per 100,000 population in 2007 [10, 51] (Figure 2g ). In particular, MSM, injecting drug users (IDUs) and female sex workers have the highest syphilis prevalence in China, of 10-20% [61, 62] , 5.4% [63] and 7-12% [64] , respectively.",

Before 2000, China had fewer than 20,000 reported HIV/AIDS cases, but in 2007, the number rose to 200,000. The latest estimates are that 700,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS in China at the end of 2007, with 70,000 new infections added every year since then [66] and 20,000-30,000 annual AIDS-related deaths [67] . Although the HIV/AIDS epidemic first began and predominated among IDUs, it rapidly spread to other population groups through both heterosexual and homosexual transmission. The latest figures demonstrate that heterosexual transmission has accounted for approximately 38-50% of new HIV infections since 2005 [68] , which may level at or exceed the percentage (30-49%) caused by transmission due to the sharing of injection equipment among IDUs [69, 70] . Notably, HIV infection has become more prevalent among MSM, as male homosexual activities account for approximately 10% of new infections [71] . AIDS mortality rate increased from 0.10 in 1999 to 1.01 cases per million in 2005, then to 4.58 cases per million in 2008, corresponding to an annual growth rate of 44% (95% CI, 30-58%) the rate is expected to increase sharply if the epidemic remains uncontrolled and there is no large procurement of antiretroviral drugs. Cumulatively, over 9000 infants were infected through mother-to-child transmission by 2005 and it was estimated that about 500 million Chinese were carriers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 2003 [72] : coinfection of HIV and M. tuberculosis could therefore have a large epidemiological impact, in the absence of appropriate public health interventions.",

            "text": "Viral hepatitis is prevalent in China, but the prevalence differs according to the type of virus. Before the 1990s, hepatitis A virus (HAV) was the most prevalent. In the early 1990s, the annual number of reported HAV diagnoses was more than 50 per 100,000 population. This dropped by 90% to 5 per 100,000 population in 2005 to 2006 [73] (Figure 2h ). The mean annual death rate due to HAV decreased at a rate of 21% (95% CI, 8-32%) during 1999 to 2008 ( Table 2 ). The decrease is probably a result of mass vaccination efforts in introducing the HAV vaccine (H2 strain) in the 1990s and improvement of hygiene and sanitary conditions that broke the cycle of food and water contamination [73] . According to 2008 data [74] , HAV persists at low, endemic levels ( Figure 2h ). In comparison, infections of hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is transmitted mainly through body fluid from mother to child, and hepatitis C virus (HCV), transmitted predominantly by intravenous injections or blood transfusion, are becoming alarmingly widespread in China. The annual number of new HBV cases increased rapidly from 20 per 100,000 population in 1990 and reached 100 per 100,000 population in 2008, despite an increasing vaccination coverage of newborns from 30% in 1992 to 93.4% in 2005 [75] . HCV infections followed a similar trend and in 2007, the annual notification rate was about 8.8 per 100,000 population. The 2007 HCV and HBV prevalence among the general population was 0.5% and 6%, respectively [74] . Mortality due to HBV and HCV increased at annual rates 9% (95% CI, 1-20%) and 30% (16-46%) respectively.",

Coinfection of HBV or HCV with other pathogens causing chronic infections, such as HIV, results in substantial increases in the disease burden on individuals, accelerates disease progression and complicates treatment [77, 78] . Since HBV and HCV can both be transmitted through exchange of body fluids, coinfection of these hepatitis viruses with HIV is common in at-risk groups in China. Approximately 67-71% of the 700,000 registered IDUs in China are infected with HCV [79, 80, 81] and 17-26% of them are infected with HBV [79, 82] . The prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection is 6.45% in IDUs [80] . Among blood donors, the prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection is 5.8-6.5% [80, 83] , whereas the figure for HIV/HBV coinfection is 3.7% [84] . In comparison, coinfection of HIV and HCV among the general population remains unknown as there is currently no reports on its prevalence. However, coinfection is expected to be increasingly noticeable as the HIV epidemic transforms into a generalised epidemic in China [6] .",

Our analysis indicated that while the morbidity and mortality of most infectious diseases reduced substantially during 1975-1995, there is an increasing trend of re-emergence of previously prevalent diseases and emergence of new infectious diseases since 1995, in particular, STIs and HIV, viral hepatitis and zoonoses diseases. These diseases accounted for the majority of deaths associated with infectious diseases in China since 2005. Consistent with this, analysis of case fatality rates indicated a higher percentage of deaths among zoonotically infected people (5-15%) and an elevated proportion (0.894%) among STIs and HIV-infected individuals. Our study has important implications for the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in China. First, the persistent small outbreaks of particular infectious diseases across the country indicate that any decrease in prevention efforts will probably trigger re-emergence of the diseases. Surveillance activities are therefore essential to inform and prioritise public health responses. Although efficient and well-developed disease surveillance systems have been implemented in many urban areas, hygiene conditions, health services and monitoring of patterns of spread and disease burden are largely lacking in rural China [6] .",

An overview of prevalence studies would be useful for comparison with numbers of notified cases in order to estimate numbers of undiagnosed cases. A comprehensive evaluation would also involve assessments of the efficiency and effectiveness of the surveillance system, both quantitative and qualitative. Understanding changes in testing rates in various population groups will also be useful for interpreting trends in notification data. But such investigations are beyond the scope of this review.",

The country's major economic reform in 1979 has created a large economic disparity between rural and urban areas, resulting in a large population of floating immigrants (also known as 'peasant workers'). This accounts for 10% of the total Chinese population in 2005 [86] . The vast majority of these immigrants are from rural environments but work in urban areas, away from their families, and hence regularly travel between the two sites. In addition to the natural population growth of major cities, the inflow of internal immigrants substantially increases the population size and density in urban areas. These immigrants often live in overcrowded residential areas with compromised hygiene conditions. Female immigrants often become targets of those seeking to recruit them for commercial sex work [57, 87] . These floating immigrants are often more disadvantageous than the local residents. They tend to be less educated compared with others in urban areas who have permanent resident status and less likely to seek medical treatment when sick due to financial constraints or lack of health insurance [6] . Not surprisingly, the population of floating immigrants has been found to be more vulnerable to infectious diseases, especially STIs, HIV and viral hepatitis [6] . Additionally, their high-risk behaviours and mobility promotes transmission of infectious disease agents and creates a major challenge for disease detection and control. Given the characteristics, behaviours and the increasing population size of floating immigrants, it becomes apparent that the capacity of current Chinese healthcare system cannot meet the needs of both the surveillance activities and health problems of these migrant workers. The infectious disease surveillance system needs to be tailored for its high mobility, and a dramatic expansion of the private health sector is required to address the health needs of this population.",

As a result of the increasing social trend of keeping house pet dogs, it is estimated that the number of pet dogs in China reached 80-200 million in 2004 [88] . However, only 30% of dog owners register their animals with government authorities and only 2-8% of dogs are vaccinated against rabies [31, 89] -coverage of greater than 70% is needed to sufficiently control rabies, as determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) [90] . The high rabies prevalence (6.4%) among dogs and the expanding number of pet dogs pose a continual and increasing threat of transmission of rabies virus from dogs to humans in China [89] . In addition, the consumption of game meat, especially in southern China, is one of the important sources of zoonotic diseases [91] . Markets in Guangdong provinces sell live poultry, fish, reptiles and mammals, including dogs and civet cats, for food [92] : the housing of these live animals, often in packed conditions, together with human activities, makes such markets the ideal hub for cross-species transmission of zoonotic agents [91] . Since there is no systematic surveillance of these live markets, it is difficult to estimate the number of such markets and the amount of game meat consumed by residents in southern China. The SARS epidemic in 2003 demonstrates that transmission of pathogens originally associated with animals can cause worldwide outbreaks in human populations. The current absence of both epidemiological and behavioural data, including their frequency of contacts and means of animal handling, on animal infectious diseases is a strong barrier to effective surveillance and control.",

The formation of a large number of dams in China, as a result of the increasing implementation of hydroelectric projects, have substantially increased the risk of schistosomiasis emergence and its spread to non-endemic areas of the country. Further, the dense population conditions in urban China and the high mobility of its floating migrants substantially promote the rapid transmission of tuberculosis [93] . Strengthening infectious diseases surveillance for bacterial infections among these specific affected populations should be a priority for the Chinese government.",
