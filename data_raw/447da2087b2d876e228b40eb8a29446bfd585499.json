Apart from standard hygiene measures, cohorting of RSV-infected patients separately from RSV-negative patients is frequently applied to prevent crossinfection, although evidence to support this practice is lacking. The objective is to evaluate the risk of room sharing between RSV-positive and RSV-negative patients.",

Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most frequently identified virus, however with the use of new and highly sensitive molecular amplification methods, the role of other viral pathogens in bronchiolitis has been increasingly recognized. Various disease severity has been shown for a range of respiratory viruses, and double viral infection is relatively common, occurring in about 10-30% of hospitalised patients [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . There is no consensus, however, on the impact of such co-infection on disease severity [5] : Some studies showed more severe disease in co-infected children [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , while others did not [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Most hospitals perform routine viral testing to identify and isolate RSV-infected infants, with the aim of reducing the risk of nosocomial cross-infection of other patients [22] [23] [24] . However, no good evidence is available of how effective this approach is in preventing nosocomial cross-infections among admitted patients with the clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis.",

Hand washing is the single most important procedure in the prevention of nosocomial infections, yet it remains the most violated of all infection control procedures [23, 24] .
