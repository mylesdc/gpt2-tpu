Influenza A paired with S. pneumoniae had higher proportions of chills and rigors than their respective mono-pathogens (P = 0.03, P = 0.009). H. influenzae paired with either enterovirus or parainfluenzae had higher proportions of cough with phlegm than their respective mono-pathogens.

For instance, one study showed that 15.3% of ambulatory patients with influenza-like illness had two viruses detected, 6 and another found that in 28.2% of children with community-acquired pneumonia, the illness was due to mixed viral-bacterial infections. 7 Others also previously described respiratory viral 8, 9 and bacterial co-infections 10, 11 in various settings, although most focus on specific pathogen combinations, especially of the synergism between influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae). [12] [13] [14] [15] However, there are no population-level studies describing multiple pathogens among persons with upper respiratory tract infections and their impact on clinical disease. Such information is of particular importance to countries within the tropical belt where there is a predilection towards multiple pathogens due to the year-round circulation of respiratory pathogens. 16, 17 A previous study documented the clinical characteristics and epidemiology of viral mono-pathogens gleaned from the respiratory disease sentinel surveillance programme of the Singapore military. 18 Here, we analyse additional data from the programme, compare patients with one (mono-pathogen) and two pathogens detected (dual pathogen), and describe observed differences in clinical characteristics.",
