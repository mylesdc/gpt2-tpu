In Brazil, it is mandatory the use of nucleic acid tests to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus in blood banks because of the immunological window. The use of an internal control (IC) is necessary to differentiate the true negative results from those consequent from a failure in some step of the nucleic acid test.",

These particles were used as non-competitive IC in assays for RNA virus diagnostics. In addition, a competitive control for HCV diagnosis was developed by cloning a mutated HCV sequence into the MS2 replicase gene of pET47b(+)-MS2, which produces a non-propagating MS2 particle. The utility of MS2-like particles as IC was evaluated in a one-step format multiplex real-time RT-PCR for HCV detection. FINDINGS We demonstrated that both competitive and non-competitive IC could be successfully used to monitor the HCV amplification performance, including the extraction, reverse transcription, amplification and detection steps, without compromising the detection of samples with low target concentrations. In conclusion, MS2-like particles generated by this strategy proved to be useful IC for RNA virus diagnosis, with advantage that they are produced by a low cost protocol. An attractive feature of this system is that it allows the construction of a multicontrol by the insertion of sequences from more than one pathogen, increasing its applicability for diagnosing different RNA viruses.",

In the case of viral detection, it is necessary to control prior steps as well, such as viral particles recovery from plasma and viral nucleic acid extraction. Therefore, strategies were developed to overcome this limitation. Initially, the exogenous nucleic acid was added before nucleic acid extraction, which controlled this step but did not properly assess the relative loss of viral particles during this process. Hence, the ideal control should be a protected nucleic acid that is subjected to exactly the same steps as a viral particle. In addition, the construction of a protected DNA or RNA would shield the nucleic acid from degradation by nucleases or hydrolysis after long-term storage, which is particular important if one needs to use RNA as a control.",

The competitive control has a sequence specific to the target microorganism that allows the use of the same primer pair in the PCR reaction, but uses a discriminatory probe. The non-competitive control uses a detection sequence unrelated to the microorganism to be detected. The competitive control can mimic the amplification kinetics of the target sequence; however, it can compete with the target sequence at low pathogen loads. Besides, for each target, a competitive control must be constructed. The non-competitive control can be associated with several targets; nevertheless, the optimisation of a multiplex PCR with two different primer pairs can be difficult, and the control amplification kinetics often do not reflect those of the target amplification (Rosenstraus et al. 1998 , Hoorfar et al. 2004 , Sharma et al. 2014 .

We demonstrated its applicability for HCV diagnosis. This internal control allows us to monitor the extraction, reverse transcription, amplification and detection steps. This particle fulfills the characteristics of an ideal internal control; i.e., it is produced by an economic protocol, it is not infectious to animals, it does not possess any sequence present in clinical samples and it is ribonuclease resistant. Additionally, its propagation by plasmid replication using the bacterial DNA polymerase is less prone to mutations and the modification of viral polymerase gene makes it impossible for replication by infection to occur, protecting the bacterial stocks from contamination.",

Another advantage of using a plasmid containing the MS2 sequence is that the replication of the plasmid via the bacterial DNA polymerase generates fewer mutations than the MS2 replication by its RNA polymerase (replicase) (Fiers et al. 1976 ). The avoidance of the risk of contamination of laboratory bacterial stocks and the non-generation of mutations by replication through RdRP are advantages of the pseudoviral particles use and our competitive IC satisfied those requirements (Pasloske et al. 1998 ).",
