The main cause of the disease outbreak was unknown. In this study, partial spike (S), ORF3, and membrane (M) genes amplified from these variants were sequenced and analyzed. The results showed that the variants could be clustered into one to three subgroups and suggested that S genes were variable, while M genes were relatively conserved. Moreover, in comparison with the vaccine strain CV777, sequence alignment analyses revealed that the S genes of the newly isolated strains contained several mutations at the aa level. It is possible that these mutations have changed the hydrophobicity of the S protein and influenced the viral antigenicity and virulence. Interestingly, homology analyses based on ORF3 demonstrated that the isolates had an intact opening reading frame (ORF), which were different from the attenuated DR13 strain. In conclusion, the widespread PED virus (PEDV) isolates had virulent characteristics. Additionally, the high degree of variation in the genes, particularly S genes, might provide an explanation for the poor immunity and rapid spread of the disease.",

To understand the genetic variations of PEDV and explain the remaining instances of PEDV, PEDV RNA was extracted directly from nasal and rectal samples of naturally infected piglets. The partial S, ORF3, M genes were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. The amino acid (aa) sequences were predicted, based on which the phylogenetic trees were constructed and the hydrophobicity was analyzed.

A phylogenetic tree was generated based on the deduced aa sequences of the partial S gene. In all phylogenies, the reference aa sequences, observed in samples collected from previous outbreaks, tended to cluster near the root but had a poorly resolved branching structure. This was likely due to relatively low sequence divergence. In contrast, results analyzed using NJ method with bootstrap support indicated that viruses from more recent infections formed three wellsupported lineages that tended to cluster far from the root. As expected. These lineages were denoted as groups I, II, and III in the S phylogenies (Figure 1(a) ).",

In this study, the data demonstrated that there was significant variation in S genes between the attenuated and virulent strains. Previous studies corroborated these results [8, 19] . Additionally, the newly isolated PEDV strains were highly homologous with each other but less similar to the vaccine strain CV777 or the virulent strain Chinju99 from Korea and CH/S from previous Chinese outbreaks. In the phylogenic trees, the current strains from different districts were genetically divided into different subgroups, but within each subgroup, the strains did not share the same geographical features. Also, these subgroups were genetically different from the groups of both attenuated strains (i.e., CV777 and attenuated DR13) and previous virulent strains (i.e., DR13, CH/S, and Chinju99). We can therefore draw a conclusion that the current strains in China represent a distinctive PEDV group and it is stable and virulent. The current strains displayed significant genetic variation from both the vaccine strains and previous strains. This may provide one possible answer for the nationwide outbreak and the poor efficacy of the vaccines. Previous studies showed that the S glycoprotein played an important role in viral attachment and penetration and was the neutralizing antibodies-inducing region due to the 2 B-cell linear epitopes [15] . In this study, the partial S proteins of current isolates, containing different aa to the previous strains due to mutations, were analyzed to determine the possible change on the protein hydrophobicity. When compared to the vaccine strain CV777, the current strains showed a significant hydrophobic alternation. This change was induced by a 4-9 aa mutations in the neutralizing epitope region of the current isolates and could provide one explanation for the poor immunity.",

            "text": "This study investigated the homology, phylogeny, and hydrophobicity of the partial S, full ORF3, and M genes from 16 currently prevalent PEDVs in China. The results suggested that most of the strains studied are highly homologous to each other, despite being clustered into different subgroups based on the S, M, and ORF3 genes. However, all of the current strains were distant from the vaccine strains genetically based on the S, M, and ORF3 genes analysis. The above analysis",
