            "text": "Avian respiratory disease causes significant economic losses in commercial poultry. Because of the need to protect long-lived poultry against respiratory tract pathogens from an early age, vaccination programs for pullets typically involve serial administration of a variety of vaccines, including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV). Often the interval between vaccinations is only a matter of weeks, yet it is unknown whether the development of immunity and protection against challenge when vaccines are given in short succession occurs in these birds, something known as viral interference. Our objective was to determine whether serially administered, live attenuated vaccines against IBV, NDV, and ILTV influence the development and longevity of immunity and protection against challenge in long-lived birds. Based on a typical pullet vaccination program, specific-pathogen-free white leghorns were administered multiple live attenuated vaccines against IBV, NDV, and ILTV until 16 weeks of age (WOA), after which certain groups were challenged with IBV, NDV, or ILTV at 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36 WOA. Five days post-challenge, viral load, clinical signs, ciliostasis, tracheal histopathology, and antibody titers in serum and tears were evaluated. We demonstrate that pullets serially administered live attenuated vaccines against IBV, NDV, and ILTV were protected against homologous challenge with IBV, NDV, or ILTV for at least 36 weeks, and conclude that the interval between vaccinations used in this study (at least 2 weeks) did not interfere with protection. This information is important because it shows that a typical pullet vaccination program consisting of serially administered live attenuated vaccines against multiple respiratory pathogens can result in the development of protective immunity against each disease agent.",

In general, live vaccines induce local and cell-mediated immunity and provide a broader protective response than killed vaccines, whereas killed vaccines primarily induce humoral immunity and tend to be antigen-specific. The duration of immunity achieved following live vaccine administration depends on the age and type of bird, levels of maternal immunity, disease targeted by the vaccine, immunogenicity of the vaccine, method of vaccine application, number of and interval between boosters, virulence and similarity of the field challenge virus, interval between vaccination and challenge, and immunocompetency of the host [1] [2] [3] .",

However, there is little information showing that the intervals between vaccinations are sufficient for the birds to develop adequate immune protection against challenge for each virus. The literature shows that sequential viral infections may result in viral interference, in which one virus blocks the subsequent infection and/or replication of another virus in the host [9, 10] , but until now it is unknown whether this phenomenon results in reduced protection from serially administered attenuated live vaccines in chickens. Interestingly, it has been reported that simultaneous administration of viruses to chickens or turkeys does not result in viral interference [11] .

Chicks were placed on fresh pine shavings in colony houses and pens. Chicks were vaccinated with the manufacturers recommended dose in 100 \u00b5L via the oculonasal route according to the following schedule; IBV at 1 DOA, NDV at 2 weeks of age (WOA), IBV at 4 WOA, ILTV at 8 WOA, NDV at 12 WOA, and ILTV at 16 WOA. In addition, a control group was not vaccinated. Homologous challenges were conducted at 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36 WOA, and necropsies were performed five days post-challenge (dpc). At challenge, birds received one of four treatments: IBV GA98, NDV B1, ILTV 63140, or no challenge. The treatment groups for each challenge virus per time point were as follows: non-vaccinated, non-challenged (n = 9-10); vaccinated, non-challenged (n = 9-10); vaccinated, challenged (n = 17-19); non-vaccinated, challenged (n = 9-10). All IBV-challenged birds received an EID 50 of 1 \u00d7 10 3.2 per bird in 100 \u00b5L intranasally. All NDV-challenged birds received the NDV B1 vaccine in 100 \u00b5L intranasally, reconstituted according to the manufacturer's protocol. All ILTV-challenged birds received the 63140 pathogenic strain at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 3.5 TCID 50 per bird in 100 \u00b5L split equally between eyedrop and intranasal routes. For IBV and NDV challenges, birds were observed at 5 dpc for respiratory signs, as previously described [15] : 0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe. For ILTV challenges, birds were observed at 3 and 5 dpc for dyspnea, conjunctivitis, depression, and mortality, as described previously [16] . The choanal cleft (IBV-and NDV-challenged and control birds at 5 dpc) or trachea (ILTV-challenged and control birds at 3 and 5 dpc) was swabbed for virus detection, and swabs were stored in PBS at \u221280 \u2022 C. At 28, 32, and 36 WOA, 50 \u00b5L of tears was collected by adding granulated NaCl to the eye. Blood was collected by wing or cardiac puncture and added to a microcentrifuge tube to collect serum for antibody detection. Birds were humanely euthanized, and the eyelid, Harderian gland (HG), thymus, liver, spleen, cecal tonsils, and bursa of Fabricius were collected and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C for virus detection and in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The trachea was removed, and one section was placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and the remaining portion of the trachea was submerged in tissue culture media for the ciliostasis test described below. The procedures were approved by the University of Georgia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (AUP #: A2015 05-001-R2).",

Costa-Hurtado, et al. [30] demonstrated that chickens and turkeys serially infected with a mesogenic strain of NDV and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) 3 days apart resulted in an initial decrease followed by a subsequent increase in replication of the second virus. In a subsequent study [11] , the same group found that low pathogenic avian influenza virus given 3 days after a lentogenic strain of NDV did show viral interference whereas viral interference was not observed when the viruses were given simultaneously. We did not measure vaccine virus replication in the present study and, therefore, could not determine whether one vaccine virus compromised the infection and replication of a subsequent vaccine virus. However, our goal was to determine if chickens sequentially vaccinated with all three viruses were protected from viral replication and clinical signs following homologous challenge. Thus, regardless of viral interference, our data shows that immunity to individual vaccine viruses was not compromised following sequential administration of multiple live attenuated vaccines targeting different viral respiratory tract pathogens.",

Since we used a lentogenic strain of NDV as challenge virus in our experimental design, protection was primarily based on significantly reduced or no virus detection at 5 days after challenge, which is a measure of local immunity preventing virus infection and/or replication. Presumably a bird protected from infection with a lentogenic strain of NDV would also show some level of protection from exposure to mesogenic or velogenic strains. Vaccinated birds at each sampling time had significantly lower or no challenge virus RNA compared to positive control groups, indicating that the vaccinated birds developed a local immune response and were indeed protected whereas the non-vaccinated positive controls were not. Because lentogenic NDV only causes a mild respiratory or enteric infection [3] , it was not surprising that respiratory signs and histological changes were mild or absent despite the presence of viral RNA. We observed clinical signs of NDV infection only at 20 WOA in positive controls, while only a few birds showed mild clinical signs at 24 and 28 WOA, and no clinical signs of disease were observed at later challenge times. This observation is consistent with existing knowledge that ND tends to be more severe in younger birds [39] .",

This information is important because it shows that consecutively administered live attenuated vaccines against multiple respiratory pathogens can be an effective vaccination strategy for the development of protective immunity against each disease agent in long-lived birds.",
