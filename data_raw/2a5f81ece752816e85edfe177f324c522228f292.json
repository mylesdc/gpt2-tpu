Simple and multiple log-binomial regression models were constructed to assess associations of virus type with a need for PICU admission. Age, prematurity, the presence of an underlying disease and congenital heart disease were covariates. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for at least one virus in 236 patients. Rhinoviruses were detected in 85.6% of samples, with a preponderance of rhinovirus C (RV-C) (61.9%). Respiratory syncytial virus was detected in 59.8% and human coronavirus (HCoV) in 11% of the samples. Co-detections of two to five viruses were found in 78% of the patients. The detection of HCoV alone (adjusted relative risk (RR) 2.18; 95% CI 1. 15-4.15) or in co-infection with RV-C (adjusted RR 2.37; 95% CI 1.23-4.58) was independently associated with PICU admission.",

            "text": "Acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) are responsible for the death of approximately 160,000 neonates and over 760,000 infants annually [1] .Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV) are the most frequent causes of acute respiratory infections in children [2] [3] [4] . Primary RSV infections may lead to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia [5] . RV usually causes rhinopharyngitis [6] , but may also cause illness of the lower respiratory tract and asthma exacerbations, and has been associated with severe ALRI in young children [7, 8] . A few studies have investigated the viral profile in children attending the pediatric emergency room (ER) with ALRI and its association with disease severity [9] [10] [11] [12] , but finding vary. Moreover, the role of viral co-infections in illness severity has been controversial [10, 12, [13] [14] [15] . In young children who presented to an outpatient clinic or ER in Japan with acute respiratory illness, RSV, RV, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) were the most prevalent viruses. Similarly to what was found in a previous study in Brazil [4] , detection of RSV, alone or in co-detections, was associated with increased disease severity in children in Japan [9] . In Seattle, USA, RV was the most frequent virus detected in children less than three years old presenting to the ER with ALRI, and 52% of them required hospital admission [10] . In addition, RV viral load and co-detection with RSV was associated with more severe disease in that study [10] . In children younger than two years old who presented to a pediatric ER with ALRI in Malaysia, RSV and RV were the most frequently detected viruses and, although RSV was associated with a history of wheezing, virus detection was not associated with need for hospitalization [11] . In The Netherlands, the most frequent viruses detected in children presenting to the ER or outpatient clinic with ALRI were RSV, RV and human coronavirus (HCoV), and RSV detection correlated with longer duration of oxygen therapy [12] . However, there was no association between the virus species and hospital length of stay, and virus co-detections were not associated with disease outcome [12] .In the present study, a comprehensive polymerase-chain-reaction(PCR) panel of primers and probes was used to detect respiratory viruses, enabling virus identification to the species level, in respiratory samples collected from children younger than three years with ALRI seen at the pediatric ER and subsequently admitted to hospital. Association of different respiratory viruses with disease severity, defined as need for admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), was assessed.",

Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were obtained after adjusting log-binomial regression models. Initially, simple logbinomial regression models were fitted, resulting in crude relative risks. Subsequently, the adjustment of multiple log-binomial regression models considering age, prematurity, the presence of an underlying disease and congenital heart disease as covariates, resulted in adjusted relative risks [21] .

In addition, the number of detected viruses has not been associated with illness severity [14] . Indeed, surprisingly, an inverse correlation between the clinical severity score and the number of viruses detected has been observed [23] . Nevertheless, a previous study performed in Southeast Brazil showed that coinfections, especially involving RSV, were associated with increased severity [13] .

We observed that one-third of children with HCoV infectionand 41% of patients withHCoV in co-infection withRV-C were admitted to the PICU. Furthermore, we found that the detection of HCoV alone or in co-infection with RV-C was an independent risk factor for PICU admission.Similar to our results, HCoV was detected in 8.2% of hospitalized children aged 3.2 \u00b1 3.9 years with respiratory tract infection in New York, OC43 was the most prevalent type (40.1%), and 11% of patients with HCoVinfectionneeded PICU admission. Additionally, the presence of chronic complex underlying conditions, including cardiovascular, genetic and respiratory diseases was associated with increased disease severity [25] , which is corroborated by our data.",

In the present study, the only rapid diagnostic test for respiratory virus availableearly at hospital admission was the RSV rapid antigen detection test. Therefore, the development of clinically relevant rapid tests for respiratory viruses is needed and shall help antimicrobialstewardship programs.",

While this limitation is acknowledged, the results obtained are similar to those reported from Europe and North America [8, 22] .Another concern could be the assumption of disease etiology based on virus detection atone-time point. However, this is a practical diagnostic approach worldwide and all patients enrolled in the study had signs and symptoms of ALRI requiring hospitalization concomitantly with virus detection. It should also be noted that, although the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia, as indicated by clinical presentation, chest X-ray findings or positive blood culture, was an exclusion criterion, it is difficult to discriminate viral and bacterial pneumonia in cases with negative bacterial cultures, because clinical presentation and chest radiography findings may overlap.",
