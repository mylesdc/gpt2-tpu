In 2012, the WHO declared ambitious targets to reduce the burden of these diseases by eliminating them as a public health problem by 2020 [1] . In support of these aspirations, a diverse consortium of donors, pharmaceutical companies, government agencies, and others made large commitments of funding, donated treatments, and other activities for 10 of these diseases in the London Declaration on NTDs [2] . Large morbidity gains have been made over recent years [3] , and there are active discussions on how to exploit the likely synergies between the goals for NTDs and universal health coverage (UHC), a sustainable development goal (SDG; target 3.8) [4] , in particular how to extend these gains to the hardest-to-reach or conflict-affected communities [5] . Of these 10 diseases, Guinea worm is targeted for eradication; the remaining 9 infections are targeted for elimination as a public health problem in some settings. The adjustment of strategies to achieve control of the 9 infections, informed by mathematical modeling, is the focus of this special issue.",

This means that we need to be cautious about overstating our results, even when the policy need is acute. This presents us with the challenge of correctly calculating and communicating the uncertainties in these complex systems while still giving an accessible message to end users. This article acts as an introduction for a special issue that aims to increase the accessibility of the results so far by summarizing insights from NTD models and identifying key themes for the control of these diseases. It should be noted that in this special issue and in this article we have focused on epidemiological analyses and modeling and have not extended our focus to geospatial, spatial dynamic, or health economic modeling, all of which have an important part to play in developing policy for infectious diseases. We focus on the role of interventions to reach the 2020 goals for NTDs.",

A key question for sleeping sickness is the potential contribution of vector control as a complement to screening and treating. Modeling suggests that it could have a large impact, reducing transmission not only from cases but also from the uncertain quantity of asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals, or even animal hosts [34] . The modelers also highlight the potential to increase the impact of screening, both passively, by increased access to diagnostics, and actively, by targeting highrisk groups (Table 1) , to reduce the duration of infection and therefore transmission (the area under the curve in Figure 1 ) by all infected individuals.",

Modeling acts as a tool to investigate some of the possible scenarios and evaluate different policy interventions in response to them [22, 27] . In particular, the recent modeling of the different stages of the control effort suggests that there should be some accounting for underlying transmission rates when selecting interventions and that post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a late-stage potentially highly infectious state, could undermine control and should be studied more closely (Table 1) .",

If the wrong group is treated, you may see reductions in burden in this group, but not in the population at large. This is discussed in 2 of the papers in this special issue. Soil-transmitted helminths are transmitted through helminth eggs in feces contaminating the environment [38] , and schistosomiasis is caused by intestinal worms that are passed in feces or urine and contaminate the water. In the case of schistosomiasis, the eggs then go on to infect snails, the parasite is amplified and rereleased into the water, and humans are infected through contact with that water [39] . For both of these infections, current guidelines suggest that treatments should be targeted at children, with different frequencies according to prevalence. The modeling studies in this special issue suggest that the current guidelines might be altered slightly to optimize their impact, through either targeting adults or changing the thresholds for switching strategies [40, 41] (Table 2) .",

The lymphatic filariasis campaign has been particularly successful, with billions of treatments given and recent scale-back of treatment in areas where the targets have been met. The policy discussion is around how best to accelerate achievement of the goals using alternative treatment strategies and, in particular, when and where these strategies might be most appropriate [43] and how they might be combined with vector control to slow down NONADHERENCE Figure 3 . Schematic of factors that could undermine the success of a mass drug administration program. Monitoring and evaluation of programs is usually focused around a survey just prior to a round of treatment. If infection is not falling as quickly as expected, it could be due to any of the reasons outlined in the schematic, most of which cannot be detected by routine surveillance. the epidemic growth rate between rounds of MDA [44] . If the bounce back rate is too fast, or the interval between treatments is too long, this can lead to all the gains from the previous round being lost (Figure 3 ). For onchocerciasis, the programs are at the point of adapting their strategies to reach beyond the large morbidity gains achieved so far. The modeling work discusses the alternative strategies and the potential for MDA combined with vector control to accelerate or achieve elimination ( Table 2) .",

This is because the MDA is a single dose of a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and so the concerns about rapid emergence of resistance have been present since the beginning, but current evidence suggests that the selection pressure from this single dose may not be as high as feared. They also highlight the risk of resurgence due to importation of cases, which is a particular concern because of the rapid epidemic growth rate of trachoma [45] . Both of these issues are relevant for the other MDA campaigns ( Figure 3 ), but the longer time between generations and hence the slower epidemic growth rates for the helminths mean that both resistance and re-emergence are likely to be slower than for trachoma. However, as these campaigns have been running for decades in some cases, it is important to consider.",

Similarly, as prevalence falls for MDA diseases, if the right diagnostic becomes available, addressing these diseases could shift to a test-and-treat campaign or even case management.
