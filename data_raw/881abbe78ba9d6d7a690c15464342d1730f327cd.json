Small RNAs were more abundantly expressed in mycelial than yeast phase. Sequence analysis revealed 24 potential milRNA candidates, including 17 candidates in mycelial and seven in yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins and the gene, qde-2, encoding Argonaute-like protein, were identified in P. marneffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 of P. marneffei was more closely related to the homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp., suggesting the co-evolution of dcl-2 among the thermal dimorphic fungi. Moreover, dcl-2 demonstrated higher mRNA expression levels in mycelial than yeast phase by 7 folds (P,0.001). Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in mycelial phase. Using dcl-1 KO , dcl-2 KO , dcl DKO and qde-2 KO deletion mutants, we showed that the biogenesis of both milRNAs were dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2. The mRNA expression levels of three predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 were upregulated in knockdown strain PM-milR-M1 KD , supporting regulatory function of milRNAs.",

            "text": "Penicillium marneffei is the most important thermal dimorphic fungus causing respiratory, skin and systemic mycosis in Southeast Asia [1] [2] [3] [4] . Recently, it has been renamed as Talaromyces based on phylogenetic analyses [5] . The fungus was first discovered in Chinese bamboo rats, Rhizomys sinensis, and subsequently isolated from other species of bamboo rats [6, 7] . While only 18 cases of human diseases were reported until 1985 [8] , the emergence of the HIV pandemic in the 1980's has resulted in increasing reports of HIV-associated P. marneffei infections in Southeast Asia where the fungus is endemic. Penicilliosis is the third most common indicator disease of AIDS In northern Thailand [2] . In Hong Kong, about 10% of HIV patients are infected with P. marneffei, which represents the sixth leading cause of death [9, 10] . Cases of imported P. marneffei infections have also been reported from countries outside Southeast Asia [11, 12] . In addition, P. marneffei infections are increasingly reported in other immunocompromised patients, such as transplant recipients and others on immunosuppressant therapy [13] [14] [15] [16] . Despite its medical importance, the mode of transmission, and dimorphic and pathogenic mechanisms of P. marneffei remain largely unknown. In particular, P. marneffei exhibits distinct cellular morphologies in different temperatures, in mycelial phase at 25uC and yeast phase at 37uC. During the mycelial phase, hyphae can differentiate to produce conidia which are believed to be the infectious form being inhaled to the lungs of infected hosts. When these conidia are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, they germinate into yeast cells as the tissue form. Despite the efforts of using various gene knockout experiments in identifying diverse genes and complex mechanisms involved in dimorphic switching in P. marneffei, the signals that trigger the switch in response to temperature and signaling pathways leading to the transition remain elusive [17] .",

They are now known to comprise one of the most abundant classes of gene regulatory molecules in multicellular organisms. The mature miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs mediated through complementary binding to the open-reading frame or untranslated (UTR) regions of specific target genes. Interactions with targets can be through imprecise base pairing leading to translational inhibition in animals, or nearperfect complementarity leading to mRNA cleavage in plants [19, 20] . In animals, miRNAs have been shown to play various roles in ranging from cell development, proliferation and differentiation, apoptosis, carcinogenesis to immunity [21] [22] [23] . In plants, they are also involved in plant development, stress response and antibacterial resistance [24, 25, 26] .",

Based on the available genome sequence data, potential genes encoding proteins important for miRNA biogenesis can be identified in P. marneffei. Since miRNAs are important gene regulatory molecules in multicellular organisms, we hypothesize that milRNAs may be expressed in P. marneffei and involved in the regulation of thermal dimorphism. We attempted to identify milRNAs in P. marneffei in both mycelial and yeast phase using high-throughput Illumina DNA sequencing. Sequence analysis revealed 24 potential milRNA candidates, which were more abundantly expressed in mycelial than yeast phase of P. marneffei. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins and the gene, qde-2, encoding quellingdeficient-2, an Argonaute-like protein, were also identified. Northern blot analysis confirmed the differential expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, in mycelial phase, which was dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2. Our findings provided evidence for the existence of milRNAs in thermal dimorphic fungi and differential expression of milRNAs during different growth phases, which may provide new insights into the mechanism governing thermal dimophism.",

Using high-throughput sequencing, we identified 24 potential milRNA candidates in P. marneffei, which were more abundantly expressed in mycelial than yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding Dicer-like proteins and the gene, qde-2, encoding Argonaute-like protein, were also identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 of P. marneffei was more closely related to the homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp.. dcl-2 demonstrated higher mRNA levels in mycelial than yeast phase. Northern blot analysis confirmed expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in mycelial phase, whose expression was dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2. The mRNA levels of three predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 were upregulated in knockdown strain PM-milR-M1 KD , supporting its regulatory function.

Based on dcl-1, dcl-2 and qde-2 gene sequences from P. marneffei strain PM1, primers were designed to amplify upstream and downstream fragments of dcl-1, dcl-2 and qde-2 for the construction of the corresponding knockout constructs using the vector pAN7-1 (a gift from Dr. P. J. Punt) as described previously [46, 47] . The flanking sequences upstream and downstream of dcl-1, dcl-2 and qde-2 were amplified by PCR using DNA extracted from strain PM1 with primers shown in Table 1 . PCR products of upstream and downstream flanking fragments were ligated into corresponding restriction sites of plasmid pAN7-1 to generate the knock-out plasmids pAN7-dcl-1, pAN7-dcl-2 and pAN7-qde-2 as shown in Fig. 1 . The resultant plasmids were linearized with AhdI and transformed to strain PM1 according to previous publications [40, 48] . SDA supplemented with 150 mg/ml hygromycin B was used as selection medium.

Dicer and Argonaute proteins are known to be involved in the biogenesis of miRNAs in animals and plants [56, 57, 58] . The dcl-1 gene is 5,383 bp in length, comprising 15 introns with total length of 889 bp. The resultant mRNA encodes 1,497 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 170.31 kDa. The dcl-2 gene is 4,636 bp in length, comprising six introns with total length of 340 bp. The resultant mRNA encodes 1,431 amino acids with a predicted mass of 161.15 kDa. These putative proteins possessed 42% and 32% amino acid identities to the DCL-1 and DCL-2 of N. crassa respectively. Both predicted proteins contain all four domains characteristic of the Dicer family. Two RNase III domains are present in the C-terminal region, and a DEAD-box ATP binding domain is present in the N-terminal region. In between there are RNA helicase and double stranded RNA binding domains. The qde-2 gene is 3,199 bp in length, comprising three introns with total length of 160 bp. The resultant mRNA encodes 1,012 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 111.75 kDa. The predicted QDE-2 protein possessed 35% amino acid identity to the QDE-2 of N. crassa. It contains two characteristic domains of the argonaute family, PAZ and Piwi domains, and the DUF1785 domain conserved in many argonaute proteins. The domain organization of DCL-1, DCL-2 and QDE-2 of P. marneffei is similar to that of the corresponding homologues in N. crassa [59] .",

In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of dcl-2 and qde-2 genes showed a different evolutionary topology. The dcl-2 of P. marneffei and its homologue in T. stipitatus are more closely related to those of the thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi, Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Coccidioides immitis than to P. chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp., suggesting the co-evolution of dcl-2 among the thermal dimorphic fungi.

Their predicted precursors were approximately 70-nt and 91-nt in size and had negative folding free energies of 217.86 kcal mol 21 and -23.88 kcal mol 21 according to RNAfold (http://www.tbi.univie. ac.at/,ivo/RNA/RNAfold.html) for PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2 respectively, comparable to those of known miRNA or milRNA precursors [31, 60, 61] . The majority of small RNA sequences of PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2 correspond to one arm of the hairpin (the milRNA arm), with a total of 1482 small RNAs sequenced from PM-milR-M1 and 10 small RNAs sequenced from PM-milR-M2 (Table 3 ). In addition, small RNAs (milRNA * ) matched to the complementary arm of the hairpin of PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2 were also sequenced, but at much lower frequencies. In contrast to many small RNAs in which the miRNA arm possesses a 59U position, the milRNA of both PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2 have a 59G position (Fig. 4) . The existence of milRNA * and the presence of a 2 nt 39 overhang in these milRNA/milRNA * pairs are strong evidence that they are produced from a Dicer-like enzyme (Fig. 5) [62] . Since loci which produce mature miRNAs and miRNA * sequences are considered miRNA loci, the two loci are tentatively named as P. marneffei milR-1 (PM-milR-1) and PM-milR-2. The locus, PM-milR-1, was situated within the coding region of a hypothetical protein, whereas PM-milR-2 was situated in the opposite strand of a pogo transposable element within a repeat region in the P. marneffei genome. The other 22 loci were considered milRNA candidates (named PM-milR-MC3, MC4\u2026MC17 for milRNA candidates in mycelial phase and PM-milR-YC1\u2026YC7 for those in yeast phase). These novel milRNAs or milRNA candidates showed no sequence similarity to known miRNAs miRBase as of March 2013.",

To assess the role of dcl-1, dcl-2 and qde-2 in the biogenesis of PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, dcl-1 KO , dcl-2 KO , dcl DKO and qde-2 KO mutants were generated using homologous recombination. All deletion mutants exhibited similar growth rates and phenotypic characteristics to wild-type strain in both mycelial and yeast phase cultures, although the dcl DKO mutant exhibited poor sporulation and reduced red pigment production compared to wild-type strain upon transition from yeast to mycelial phase on sabouraud agar (data not shown). Northern blot analysis of PM-milR-M1 in wild-type and deletion mutants showed that a band corresponding to the mature milRNA product with approximate size of 21 nt was present in wild-type strain, dcl-1 KO and qde-2 KO mutants, but absent in dcl-2 KO and dcl DKO mutants (Fig. 5A) . Moreover, a band with approximate size of 70 nt, which matches the size of the predicted precursor of milRNA (pre-milRNA) of PM-milR-M1, was present in dcl-2 KO and dcl DKO mutants but not in wild-type strain, dcl-1 KO or qde-2 KO mutants. In addition, a band of approximately 30 nt is also seen in dcl-2 KO and dcl DKO mutants but not in wild-type strain, dcl-1 KO or qde-2 KO mutants, which may represent an intermediate product of the precursor. This suggested that DCL-2 protein is required for the biogenesis of mature milRNA from PM-milR-M1 and that the band at about 70 nt is likely the pre-milRNA. In the dcl-1 KO and qde-2 KO mutants, the levels of mature milRNA were similar to that of wild-type, indicating that DCL-1 and QDE-2 are not required for milRNA production from PM-milR-M1. As for PM-milR-M2, the band corresponding to its mature milRNA product, with approximate size of 20 nt, was also present in wild-type strain, dcl-1 KO and qde-2 KO mutants, but was absent in dcl-2 KO and dcl DKO mutants (Fig. 5A ). This suggested that DCL-2 protein is also required for the biogenesis of mature milRNA from PM-milR-M2.

            "text": "This is the first report of milRNAs in a human thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungus and their differential expression in mycelial and yeast phases. RNAi proteins such as Dicer and Argonaute have been identified in many fungi, such as the model filamentous fungus N. crassa [63] and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe [64] . Although RNAi proteins were lost in the famous budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the closely related species Saccharomyces castelli encoded a defected but functional Dicer-like homolog [65] . However, till 2005, no endogenous miRNAs have been reported in fungi but only reports of antisense transcripts encoded in the genome of C. neoformans [66] . No plant or animallike miRNAs was found in Aspergillus species by computational analysis of six Aspergillus genomes (Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus clavatus, and Neosartorya fischeri) [67] . It was therefore uncertain whether fungi have microRNAs until the recent discovery of milRNAs in the filamentous fungi, N. crassa, S. sclerotiorum and M. anisopliae, as well as the human pathogenic yeast, C. neoformans [30] [31] [32] [33] . Neverthe-less, the presence of milRNAs in human pathogenic filamentous and dimorphic fungi was largely unknown. We have previously shown that target gene expression can be specifically knocked down by an RNAi-based method in P. marneffei [36, 40] . Moreover, we found that two dcl genes encoding putative dicer-like proteins and a qde-2 gene encoding a putative Argonaute-like protein, QDE-2, can be identified in P. marneffei strain PM1 draft genome, which are known to play key roles in the biogenesis of miRNAs and siRNAs [68] . Since miRNAs are important gene regulatory molecules in multicellular organisms, we hypothesized that P. marneffei possesses functional RNAi machinery and may encode miRNAs, which may be involved in the regulation of thermal dimorphism. In this study, using high throughput sequencing of small RNAs extracted from mycelial and yeast cultures of P. marneffei, we showed that small RNAs are more abundantly expressed in mycelial than yeast phase by .10 folds. The sequencing result is also in line with the more abundant small RNAs (approximately 20-24 nt) observed in mycelial than yeast phase upon Sybr Gold stained 12% denaturing polyacylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). After exclusion of other noncoding RNAs, a total of 2,734 reads were identified as potential milRNA candidates including 17 candidates in mycelial phase and seven in yeast phase, suggesting that milRNAs are differentially expressed in the two growth phases and may be more abundant in mycelial than yeast phase of P. marneffei. Two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, both expressed in mycelial phase, were confirmed by Northern blot analyses. They share similar characteristics to miRNAs in animals and plants, being dependent on a Dicer-like protein for production and arisen from highly specific stem-loop RNA precursors. PM-milR-M1 was also shown to regulate the mRNA expression of its predicted target genes. The present results supported that dimorphic fungi may encode milRNAs which are likely conserved regulators of gene expression in diverse eukaryotes including fungi [18] . DCL-2 is likely a conserved protein involved in milRNA biogenesis among thermal dimorphic fungi. Dicer is a member of RNAse III family of nucleases and is responsible for miRNA processing in animals and plants [18] . While dicer-like proteins are known to be important for RNAi silencing in various fungi [36, 40, 69, 70] , its role in milRNAs in fungi has been less well studied. A recent study on N. crassa has revealed diverse pathways in the generation of milRNAs and Dicer-independent small interfering RNAs (disiRNAs) [30] . In this study, the production of PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, as well as the pre-milRNA of PM-milR-M1, was dependent on the presence of DCL-2 but not DCL-1 or QDE-2 in P. marneffei. The pre-milRNA of PM-milR-M2 was not obvious upon Northern blot analyses, which may be due to degradation into small RNAs because of instability. No identifiable homologues of PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2 could be in animals and plants, which supported the independent evolution of milRNAs in fungi [30, 33] . On the other hand, homologues of their precursors can be identified in T. stipitatus (data not shown). Nevertheless, it remains to be determined if such milRNA homologues are also expressed and processed in the same way. Interestingly, in contrast to ITS and dcl-1 sequences which were both phylogenetically most closely related to the homologues in T. stipitatus, P. chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp., the dcl-2 gene of P. marneffei is more closely related to the homologues in other geographically restricted thermal dimorphic fungi than to P. chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp.. This suggested that the dcl-2 gene may have co-evolved among the thermal dimorphic fungi and serve similar function. Since these thermal dimorphic fungi are different from other fungi by their ability to cause systemic mycosis as intracellular yeasts and survive in natural environments as molds, it would be interesting to explore the potential role of DCL-2 in fungal dimorphism as well as virulence. In N. crassa, at least four different mechanisms that involved a combination of factors were identified for the production of milRNAs. In fact, apart from dicers and QDE-2, homologues of QDE-2 interacting protein (QIP) and mitochondrial ribosomal protein L3 (MRPL3), which were also involved in biogenesis of some milRNAs in N. crassa [30] , can also be found in the P. marneffei genome, with 27-49% amino acid identities (data not shown). Further studies are required to explore for possible role of these proteins in milRNA biogenesis in P. marneffei.",

            "text": "In contrast to miRNAs from animals and plants which are known to play different functions from multicellular development to stress response, the potential function(s) of milRNAs in fungi remain to be determined. Some miRNAs in plants and animals are known to exhibit temporal or tissue-specific expression patterns [18, 71, 72] . As for fungi, a recent study showed that some milRNAs are differentially expressed in sclerotial development of S. sclerotiorum [31] . In C. neoformans, milRNAs were shown to cause transgene silencing via the canonical RNAi pathway and proposed to be play a role in regulating transposons and pseudogene expression [33] . In this study, we showed the mRNA expression level of dcl-2 was higher in mycelial than yeast phase, suggesting that DCL-2 may function predominantly in the mycelial phase. This, in turn, may explain why PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2 were only expressed in mycelial but not yeast form of P. marneffei. Therefore, it is likely that PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2 are only produced from DCL-2 and serve important function during mycelial phase. A number of potential targets were predicted for both PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2. For example, the predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 include RanBP10 and cytochrome P450, while transposon or transposable elements were the predominant predicted targets of PM-milR-M2. The targets of PM-milR-M1 were also confirmed to be upregulated at the RNA level in the knockdown strain, PM-milR-M1 KD , supporting the mRNA cleavage function of milRNAs. These results suggested that milRNAs in P. marneffei may regulate cell division, metabolism as well as transposons, although further studies are required to investigate their biological function. Nevertheless, the present study demonstrated the potential role of differential post-transcriptional control in different growth phases of thermal dimorphic fungi, which may provide new insights into the mechanism governing thermal dimorphism.",
