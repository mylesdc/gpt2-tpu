Although the pathogenesis of HFRS is unclear, some reports have suggested that the abundant production of proinflammatory cytokines and uncontrolled inflammatory responses may contribute to the development of HFRS. CXCL10 is one of these cytokines and is found to be involved in the pathogenesis of many virus infectious diseases. However, the role of CXCL10 in the pathogenesis of HFRS and the molecular regulation mechanism of CXCL10 in HTNV infection remain unknown. In this study, we report that CXCL10 expresses highly in the HFRS patients' sera and the elevated CXCL10 is positively correlated with the severity of HFRS. We find that HTNV, a single-strand RNA virus, can act as a double-strand RNA to activate the TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA-5 signaling pathways. Through the downstream transcription factors of these pathways, NF-B and IRF7, which bind directly to the CXCL10's promoter, the expression of CXCL10 is increased. Our results may help to better understand the role of CXCL10 in the development of HFRS and may provide some novel insights into the immune response of HTNV infection.",

            "text": "Inflammatory cytokines/chemokines produced during HTNV infection represent a double-edged sword [5] . On one hand, they contribute to viral elimination by inducing and amplifying innate effectors' functions and antigen presentation of viral epitopes to T cells. On the other hand, if not properly regulated, inflammatory cytokines/chemokines may facilitate immunopathological processes in HFRS [5] . We screened a panel of cytokines expressions using Luminex and found that, in the serum from HFRS patients, CXCL10 was the most-highly-expressed cytokine (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/697837). CXCL10/Interferon--inducible protein-10 (IP-10) is a member of CXC chemokines, which is mainly secreted by endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and keratinocytes. After binding to its receptor CXCR3, CXCL10 induces chemotaxis, 2 Mediators of Inflammation apoptosis, cell growth inhibition, and angiostasis [6] . Accumulating data have indicated that CXCL10 plays an important role in many virus infectious diseases infected with Hepatitis Virus B (HBV) [7] , Hepatitis Virus C (HCV) [8] , HIV [9] , influenza virus [10] , and some other viruses [11] [12] [13] . The elevated level of CXCL10 has been found to be correlated with the development and the severity of these infectious diseases. In studies of the regulation mechanism of CXCL10 production, some signaling pathways have been documented to contribute to the regulation of CXCL10's expression, including JAK-STAT pathway [14] , TRAF2/TAK1 pathway [7] , and PI3K/AKT pathway [15] . Transcriptional factors like NF-B [7] , IRF1 [13] , and IRF3 [15, 16] have also been proved to bind to the CXCL10's promoter. Although Geimonen et al. have reported that HTNV induce CXCL10 expression in HUVECs [17] , little is known about the molecular regulation mechanism of HTNV-induced CXCL10 production. A better understanding of the regulation mechanism of CXCL10 production in infectious diseases might help us develop new therapeutic interventions in human diseases.",

The clinical diagnosis of HFRS was confirmed by detection of IgM antibodies to HTNV in the patients' serum specimens. Thirty-six healthy donors were included in the study as normal control. The serum samples and the peripheral blood samples were collected and stored as previously described [18, 19] . Based on the classically defined 5 stages of HFRS (namely, febrile stage, hypotensive stage, oliguric stage, polyuric stage, and convalescent stage), we classified the HFRS patients in this study into acute phase (including febrile, hypotensive, and oliguric stages) and convalescent phase (including diuretic and convalescent stages) [20, 21] . The plasma viral load, an important indicator of disease severity, had been determined in our lab before [18] . Because of the limitation in detecting the viral load, we grouped viral load at the baseline of 1500 copies/mL.",

Spearman correlation analysis showed that the increasing level of CXCL10 was correlated with the increasing BUN ( = 0.345, < 0.005), Crea ( = 0.138, < 0.05), and WBC ( = 0.341, < 0.005) and the decreasing PLT counts ( = \u22120.500, < 0.005) in HFRS patients (Figure 1(c) ).

The contradictory findings of CXCL10's role in either protecting or promoting infection may depend on the host immune status and genetic background [29] . In our study, we have found that the serum CXCL10 level in HFRS patients is substantially higher than its corresponding level in healthy donors (Figure 1(a) ) and the content of CXCL10 in the acute phase of HFRS is 3 times higher than that in the convalescent phase (Figure 1(b) ). Importantly, the elevation of CXCL10 level is correlated significantly with the HFRS severity-indicating clinical parameters (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)) . The higher CXCL10 level in the higher viral load group (>1500 copies/mL) is good proof that the production of CXCL10 is correlated with the replication of the HTNV (Figure 1(d) ).",

Our analyses of the membrane expression level of CXCR3 on T cells, NK cells, and monocytes (data not shown) reveal that the level of CXCR3 increases on CD14 + subset in PBMCs isolated from HFRS patients ( Figure 2) . These results suggest that the increasing level of CXCL10 in the acute phase of HFRS may recruit CD14 + cells (monocytes) and the recruited CD14 + monocytes may produce excessive cytokines to be involved in the \"cytokine storm. \" Our presumption is consistent with the findings of Cheung et al. in their study on SARS-coronavirus [11] . These findings indicate that the elevated level of CXCL10 in HFRS patients may serve as a biomarker of HFRS development. Since there has not been a proper animal model for HFRS [5] , we cannot yet testify the protective effect of antagonist on the CXCL10-CXCR3 signaling axis after HTNV infection in vivo.",

But, the mechanism for the induction of CXCL10 during HTNV infection is still unknown. In our study, the results of the transfection of poly (I:C) suggest that the CXCL10 could be induced by dsRNA, which may be the replicative intermediate generated during HTNV replication ( Figure 3 ). As indicated in Figure 3 (a), mock viruses, which lose their ability in replication, fail to activate the expression of CXCL10. The transfection of R848 also demonstrates that it is dsRNA, rather than ssRNA, that induces the CXCL10's production. dsRNA sensors (TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA-5) are activated after HTNV infection and therefore may contribute to the CXCL10's generation, while TLR7 and TLR8, as ssRNA sensors, are not activated (Figures 3(a)-3(c) ). Sundstrom et al. reported that, during HTNV infection, IRF3 and IRF7, rather than IRF-1 or p65, were the main downstream transcription factors regulating the cytokines' production [31] but they did not explain the direct correlations between these transcription factors and CXCL10's production during HTNV infection. Our results of ChIP and EMSA demonstrate that IRF7 and NF-B1 are activated after HTNV infection and they bind directly to the CXCL10's promoter in HUVEC ( Figure 5 ). The understanding of the regulations of cytokines/chemokines and their receptors during HTNV infection might provide a novel therapeutic target in HFRS. In our study, we have found that the contents of CXCL10 (10 kDa) in HFRS patients' serum drop to the normal level after the hemodialysis treatment (data not shown). Current treatment of HFRS is often limited to the administration of Ribavirin and primary supports [21, 32] . The patients suffering from a severe or critical HFRS have to be treated by hemodialysis [5] to remove the low molecular weight proteins, such as cytokines and chemokines [33] . But hemodialysis has some serious side effects, such as bleeding, hypotension, infection, and anemia. A combination of antiviral and anti-cytokines/chemokines therapies may be a better therapeutic approach to hantavirus infections [34] .",

At present, the innate immunity activated by HTNV infection remains a subject of much debate with its focus on whether dsRNA like structures are produced during the replication process of HTNV infection. The disagreement may be due to the different cell lines used in respective studies. Some clinical and pathological findings have shown that pathogenic hantaviruses specifically target endothelial cells for infection [36] [37] [38] and accordingly in our study we used the HUVEC model. Further studies are still needed for hantaviral RNA structures that trigger innate immunity activity in vivo and their interactions with TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA-5 or with some other unknown RNA sensors.",
