The substrate sequences were inserted between cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins so that the cleavage rates were monitored by in vitro fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The relative cleavage rate for different substrate sequences was correlated with various structural properties. P5 and P3 positions prefer residues with high b-sheet propensity; P4 prefers small hydrophobic residues; P2 prefers hydrophobic residues without b-branch. Gln is the best residue at P1 position, but observable cleavage can be detected with His and Met substitutions. P1' position prefers small residues, while P2' and P3' positions have no strong preference on residue substitutions. Noteworthy, solvent exposed sites such as P5, P3 and P3' positions favour positively charged residues over negatively charged one, suggesting that electrostatic interactions may play a role in catalysis. A super-active substrate, which combined the preferred residues at P5 to P1 positions, was found to have 2.8 fold higher activity than the wild-type sequence.",

The cleavage of these peptide substrates by 3CL pro was detected by mass spectrometry. They showed that cleavage was detected only when Leu and Phe were present at P2 position. Peptide substrates with acidic residues at P1' position and with Ile/ Leu at P2' position were not cleavable. All substitutions at P4 and P3' positions resulted in cleavable substrates. Their detection method can only determine qualitatively whether the peptide substrate is cleavable, but not the relative cleavage rate of different substitutions. Goetz et al. profiled the specificity at P4 to P1 positions using a fully degenerate library of tetrapeptides linked with a fluorogenic group at the C-terminus [19] . Contradictory to the common belief that P1 position only takes Gln, they showed that 3CL pro can cleave the peptide substrates containing His at P1 position equally well. However, in their hands, peptide substrates with Phe at P2 position have no observable cleavage, which is inconsistent with the observation that Phe is naturally occurring at this position of the autocleavage sequence of polyproteins. It is, therefore, unknown whether the tetrapeptide is a good model for substrate specificity for 3CL pro .",

Separation of the two fluorescent proteins caused the reduction in FRET efficiency, and the reaction rate was followed by time-dependent decrease of emitted fluorescence at 530 nm ( Figure 1C ). The observed rate constants, k obs , were measured at 1 to 4 mM of 3CL pro . The specific activity, k obs /[3CL pro ], for WT autocleavage sequence was determined by the slope of k obs against 3CL pro , which was 71611 mM 21 min 21 ( Figure 1D ). Profiling of substrate specificity at P5 to P3' positions We performed saturation mutagenesis at P5 to P3' positions of the autocleavage sequence to create a substrate library of 19|8 variants. The relative cleavage rate of 3CL pro against these substrate sequences was measured ( Figure 2 , Table S1 ). In general, solventexposed sites such as P5, P3, and P3' positions were less selective than the others. The most selective site was P1 position -cleavage was only observable with Gln, His or Met. Substrate sequences with Pro substitutions at P3, P1', P2' positions were not cleavable.",

Presence of positive charges near the active site may electrostatically stabilize the oxyanion and thus promote catalysis. Another possibility is a direct electrostatic interaction between positively charged residues of substrate and negatively charged residues of 3CL pro .

In general, the relative activity was further increased by introduction of more favorable substitutions. Triple substitution resulted in the best substrate sequence, TVRLQQSGF, with a relative activity of 2.8460.25. Noteworthy, docking simulation by Phakthanakanok et al. ranked TVKLQQAGF and TVRLQQAGF as the sequences with the lowest docking energy for 3CL pro -substrate interaction [25] .",

In the 3CL prosubstrate complex (PDB: 2Q6G), amide group of P1-Gln of the WT substrate sequence (thin stick) forms hydrogen-bonds with the Ne 2 atom of His163 and the backbone carbonyl group of Phe140. P1-Gln was substituted to His (thick stick) in silico using the program SWISS-PDBViewer [24] .

The library consisted of 20|4 sub-libraries, each consisted of a mixture of 20 3 tetrapeptides with one common residue at a particular position and degenerate residues at the other positions. Consistent with our results, they showed that 3CL pro can cleave both His and Gln at P1 position. It is noteworthy that the reported protease activity for P1-His substrates was slightly higher than that for the P1-Gln substrates. In contrast, our data suggested that P1-His is cleavable but with a lower relative activity of 0.2660.02. Goetz et al. argued that the binding mode of His and Gln to the S1 pocket is similar because the Ne 2 and Ne 1 atoms of P1-His can take the approximate positions of Ne 2 and Oe 1 atoms of P1-Gln. However, a close inspection of their models revealed that such binding mode of P1-His requires structural changes of the backbone atoms of the P1 residue. The structural changes may be accommodated in their tetrapeptide substrates, which lack residues beyond P1' position that may restrict the backbone conformation of the substrate. In contrast, we argue that for the protein substrate used in our study, it is likely that the backbone conformation of the substrate will be held by extensive interaction of residues from P5 to P3' positions. As discussed above, our model suggests that P1-His should form weaker interaction with the 3CL pro (Figure 4) , justifying the observation that P1-Gln is preferred over P1-His in the native cleavage sequences in the SARS-CoV polyproteins.",

Not only our results are consistent with some of the previous observations, novel insights into the substrate specificity were obtained in this study. First, positively charged residues are consistently preferred over negatively charged ones at solvent-exposed positions such as P5, P3, P3'. Second, the 3CL pro activity is directly proportional to hydrophobicity for small residues at P4, and to b-sheet propensities at P5 and P3 positions. Third, residues larger than Cys are not favored at P1' position. Fourth, the most favorite residue at P1 position is Gln, but P1-His and P1-Met are also cleavable. Our results suggest the existence of a strong structureactivity relationship between 3CL pro and its substrates. The substrate specificity profiled in this study can be used as a benchmark for better computational simulation for 3CL prosubstrate/inhibitor interaction, and may provide a guideline for a rational based design of potent inhibitors.",

The autocleavage sequence of 3CL pro is inserted between CFP and YFP in the protein substrate. When CFP is excited at 430 nm, YFP emits fluorescence at 530 nm through FRET. Cleavage of the peptide bond at SAVLQQSGF by 3CL pro separates CFP and YFP, leading to a decrease in the emitted fluorescence at 530nm. (B) After digestion by 4 mM of 3CL pro for one hour, the protein substrate of 58 kDa (lane 1) was separated into two products of 28 kDa and 30 kDa (lane 2). (C) The protein substrate cleaved by 1 to 4 mM of 3CL pro led to a timedependent decrease in fluorescence at 530 nm. Observed rate constant, k obs , was obtained by fitting the data to a single exponential decay. (D) The plot of k obs against [3CL pro ] yielded a straight line. The specific activity, k obs /[3CL pro ], was determined by the slope of the plot. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0013197.g001",

(B) At P4 position, significant correlation was observed for hydrophobicity (r = 0.587, p = 0.008). The correlation was improved (r = 0.942, p,0.001) when only residues with side chain volumes of ,80 \u00c5 3 (Ala, Asn, Asp, Cys, Glu, Gly, Pro, Ser, Thr and Val) were included. (C) The relative activity on P3 variants were correlated with b-sheet propensity (r = 0.510, p = 0.022). Increase in the correlation (r = 0.729, p = 0.001) was found after neglecting charged residues (Arg, Asp, Glu and Lys). (D) Only variants with hydrophobic residues (Ala, Cys, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, and Val) at P2 position were cleavable. (E) The relative activity on P1' variants with side chain volume of ,50 \u00c5 3 (Ala, Cys, Gly and Ser) were higher than that on others. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0013197.g003",
