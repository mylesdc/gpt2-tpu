This capacity was dependent upon building and maintaining molecular diagnostic capacity for influenza viruses among public health laboratories in the United States. 6, 7 This greatly strengthened molecular diagnostic capacity for influenza among public health laboratories in the United States. However, less is known about laboratory capacity to routinely diagnose influenza and other respiratory viruses at clinical laboratories and hospitals. Our objective was to describe influenza and other respiratory virus diagnostic practices and routine laboratory testing capacity from a sample of laboratories serving hospitals in the United States.",

The surveillance is based on identification of positive laboratory results for influenza. However, whether or not a hospitalized patient is tested for influenza is dependent upon the clinical practices of the team caring for each individual patient. During 2012-2013, participating hospital laboratories were asked to voluntarily send influenza A specimens to state public health laboratories for subtyping.

The second part of the questionnaire, administered to the head of laboratory departments or their designees, collected information on diagnostic capacity for influenza and other respiratory viruses in the laboratories. Questions included type of laboratory tests available, specimen type acceptable for testing, turnaround time for molecular diagnostic tests, and testing algorithm for confirmation of initial results.

Among 63 laboratories with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) capacity, 8% developed their own influenza RT-PCR assay in house and 60% were able to subtype influenza A viruses.

            "text": "We demonstrated predominant use of rapid diagnostic tests for influenza and RSV during 2012-2013 among hospitals and laboratories from 15 states. While the use of molecular diagnostic assays for detection of influenza virus infection at hospital and associated commercial laboratories increased modestly since 2006-2007, the availability of influenza molecular diagnostics for clinical care at hospitals was still limited; only 26% of hospital laboratories reported availability of molecular diagnostic assays. Laboratory diagnostics for respiratory viruses other than influenza and RSV were uncommonly available. Also, a minority of hospitals included in our survey had policies in place to systematically test patients with acute respiratory infections (ARI) seen in the ED with influenza diagnostics during influenza season. As the number and type of commercially available laboratory diagnostics for respiratory pathogens evolve, an updated survey is warranted. We showed that in most (67%) hospitals included in FluSurv-NET, a U.S. population-based surveillance network involving 15 states, RIDT was the clinician's primary or only option for influenza diagnostic testing. RIDTs are easy to use and have rapid turnaround time for results. However, RIDTs have been shown to have suboptimal sensitivity (40-70%) compared to RT-PCR or viral culture. [10] [11] [12] [13] Several studies suggest that healthcare providers are more likely to prescribe antiviral drugs with a positive RIDTs. 13, 14 Therefore, a falsenegative result may affect clinicians' decision to provide appropriate treatment and infection control among patients with influenza. Given the suboptimal sensitivity of RIDT, patient management should not depend upon a positive RIDT result. If patient management depends upon a diagnosis (or rule out) of influenza, additional confirmatory test with a more sensitive assay is warranted and the initiation of antiviral treatment and implementation of infection control should be started empirically and not delayed while awaiting confirmation. 15 In our survey, only 31% of laboratories had protocols for confirmatory testing with a more sensitive assay following a negative rapid test result. This may reflect the limited usefulness of receiving testing results late in clinical care. Also, in our survey, the laboratories confirming RIDT test results reflects shipment of specimens to state public health laboratories as part of FluSurv-NET surveillance, in addition to clinician practice. New molecular assays may improve the accuracy of influenza diagnosis, but timeliness and cost of these new assays could affect future use.",
