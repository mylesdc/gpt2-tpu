To map the epitopes on the PEDV M protein, a total of 17 partially overlapping fragments covering the C-terminus of M protein were expressed as fusion proteins with a 6\u00d7His tag or a GST tag. A linear motif, 193 TGWAFYVR 200 , was identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot (WB) analysis using McAb 4D4. The motif 195 WAFYVR 200 was the minimal requirement for reactivity, as demonstrated by removing amino acids individually from both ends of the motif 193 TGWAFYVR 200 . The result of WB analysis showed that the 4D4-defined epitope could be recognized by PEDV-positive serum, but not transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-positive serum. Furthermore, this epitope was highly conserved among different PEDV strains, as shown by alignment and comparison of sequences.",

It has a genome of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA that is approximately 28 kb in length. The spike protein (S, 180-220kDa), membrane protein (M, 27-32kDa), envelope protein (E,~7kDa) and nucleocapsid protein (N, 55-58kDa) are the four structural proteins of PEDV [12] . The S protein and M protein are localized on the surface of the virion. The M protein of coronavirus is the most abundant component of the viral envelope. In silico analysis has suggested that the M protein consists of a triple-transmembrane segment flanked by a short amino-terminal domain on the exterior of the virion and a long carboxy-tail located inside the virion. The M protein of coronaviruses is indispensable in the assembly process and budding of virions [13] [14] [15] . The immune reaction to the M protein of coronaviruses plays an important role in the induction of protection and in mediating the course of the disease [16, 17] . Monoclonal antibodies against the M protein of coronaviruses have virus-neutralizing activity in the presence of complement [18] . The M protein of coronavirus can also stimulate the production of alpha-interferon (\u03b1-IFN) [19] .",

As a result of unidentified but complex factors, it is very difficult to express the full-length M protein of coronaviruses [22, 23] . Finally, we chose to express the truncated Cterminus of the M (tM) protein, and the tM protein was expressed in a fusion form either with a 6\u00d7His tag or a GST tag. The results of WB analysis showed that the fusion proteins tM-His 6 and GST-tM could be recognized by PEDV-positive serum, which indicates that both fusion proteins had good reactivity. In order to obtain more specific McAb, the fusion protein tM-His 6 was selected as an immunogen to elicit the formation of antibody. The fusion protein GST-tM was chosen to coat the ELISA plates to screen hybridomas, so that the coating antigen bore a different tag from the immunogen. After cell fusion and three cycles of selection, one McAb, designed 4D4, was chosen because of its specific reactivity with the fusion protein GST-tM as well as the native M protein of the PEDV CH/SHH/06 strain.",

Nine peptides spanning the identified epitope M3 were expressed in the form of GST-fusion peptides. Further experiments revealed that the epitope was in the M12 region ( 193 TGWAFYVR 200 ) of the M protein ( Figure 3 ). To define more precisely the core epitope, amino acid residues were removed from the carboxy or amino terminals of the peptide M12 one by one to verify the minimal unit of the epitope that could be recognized by McAb 4D4. As demonstrated in Figure 3 , the amino acid residues \" 195 W\" and \"R 200 \" were essential for reactivity because deletion of either of them destroyed antibody binding. It is therefore reasonable to deduce that the minimal epitope recognized by McAb 4D4 is 195 WAFYVR 200 . Sequence alignment of the amino acids of the identified epitope with those of other PEDV strains and other coronaviruses showed that this epitope was totally conserved across different strains of PEDV, but among different coronaviruses the epitope had only low homology.",

McAb 4D4 as the primary antibody. As demonstrated by ELISA, M3 showed reactivity with the McAb 4D4 (Figure 3 A). Subsequently, M3 was divided into five GST-fusion fragments (M4-M8) and the five peptides were probed by McAb 4D4. The results of the ELISA indicated that M5 harbored an antigenic epitope (Figure 3 A). To define the epitope more precisely, four 8-mer peptides (M9-M12) spanning the fragment M5 were expressed in a fusion form with GST and detected with the McAb 4D4. The results showed that M12 was recognized by the McAb 4D4, which indicates that the 4D4-specific epitope was 193 TGWAFYVR 200 (Figure 3 A). For fine mapping of the epitope of the M protein, we generated a panel of five shortened peptides (M13-M17) by deleting amino acids individually, at either the amino or the carboxy terminus in sequence, from the peptide M12 ( 193 TGWAFYVR 200 ).
