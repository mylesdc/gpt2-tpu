            "text": "Infection by most viruses triggers apoptosis in host cells, and viruses manipulate this cell response to promote viral replication, virus spread, and cell killing. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been shown to induce apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, while the regulatory roles of PRRSV-encoded products in apoptosis are not fully understood. In the present study, we first showed a biphasic apoptosis regulation by a highly pathogenic PRRSV strain JXwn06. It was indicated that PRRSV infection delays apoptosis at early infection but activates apoptosis at late infection in MARC-145 cells. In PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, procaspase-8, -9 and -12 were activated at late infection, demonstrating the involvements of death receptor pathway, mitochondrial pathway and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway in inducing apoptosis. PRRSV was also shown to induce a similar apoptosis process in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) with an early initiation. Next, the PRRSV-encoded apoptosis inducers were screened, indicating that the nonstructural protein (Nsp) 4 and Nsp10 of PRRSV are pro-apoptotic. In the presence of Nsp4, it was confirmed that procaspase-8, -9 and -12 were cleaved, and Nsp4 facilitates the cleavage of procaspase-9 by activating B-cell lymphoma 2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim), a pro-apoptotic protein. In addition, Nsp4 was shown to induce the degradation of an anti-apoptotic protein, B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL). Nsp10 was shown to activate procaspase-8 and -9 but procaspase-12 and to upregulate the expression of BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein BH3 interacting-domain death agonist (Bid) and its active form, truncated Bid (tBid). Clearly, the participation of both activated caspase-8 and Bid is required for Nsp10-induced apoptosis, indicating a crosstalk between extrinsic-and mitochondria-dependent pathways. Together, our findings suggest that PRRSV infection regulates apoptosis in a two-phase manner and activates all three apoptotic pathways; the Nsp4 and Nsp10 of PRRSV function as apoptosis inducers with different molecular basis.",

In general, apoptotic pathways can be divided into two nonexclusive signaling cascades: extrinsic pathway and intrinsic pathway [3] . The latter can be further separated into mitochondria-dependent and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent pathways. Ensured apoptotic signal transductions activate executioners like caspase-3 and initiate the execution phase of apoptosis [4] . Tremendous studies have determined a large group of proteins manipulating apoptosis. Bax and Bak are proapoptotic molecules which activate caspase-9 [5] . In addition, BH3-domain-only Bcl-2 members, Bid, Bim, and Puma also participate in Bax-and Bak-induced apoptosis [6] . Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL possess anti-apoptotic functions and both of them block apoptosis by inhibiting homooligomerization and activation of Bax and Bak [7] .",

PRRS virus (PRRSV), the etiological agent, is classified into the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales [11] . To date, all PRRSV isolates characterized worldwide can be grouped into two distinct genotypes, the European genotype 1 and North American genotype 2 [12] [13] [14] . PRRSV is an enveloped RNA virus, with at least 11 open reading frames (ORFs) within its positive-sense RNA genome, which encode nonstructural proteins (Nsps) and structural proteins [15] [16] [17] [18] . Ribosomal frame-shifting (RF) signal mediates the synthesis of two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which is cleaved into 14 Nsps [19] [20] [21] . The Nsps of PRRSV have been shown to be essential for virus replication and genomic transcription, viral pathogenesis and virulence [22, 23] . A growing number of studies have also indicated that the Nsps of PRRSV play important roles in modulating innate immune responses of host [24] [25] [26] .",

Moreover, the Bid truncated by PRRSV-activated caspase-8 subsequently induces caspase-9-depedndent apoptosis, suggesting a crosstalk between these two pathways [33] . Besides Bid, other Bcl-2 family members such as Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL participate in PRRSV-induced apoptosis as well [33, 34] . PRRSV also regulates apoptosis by manipulating multiple signaling pathways [34] [35] [36] . At the late infection, PRRSV activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway but suppresses phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)dependent Akt pathway (PI3K/Akt), to promote PRRSV-induced apoptosis [34] . On the contrary, PRRSV activates PI3K/Akt and p53 pathways at the early stage of infection, which counteracts PRRSV-mediated apoptosis [35] . PRRSV-induced apoptosis has been suggested to be viral replication-dependent; hence the product (s) encoded by viral genes may play pro-apoptotic roles [29, 30, 32, 37] . The pro-apoptotic function of PRRSV GP5 has been recognized previously [38] [39] [40] , while recent studies have showed clearly that the GP5 is dispensable for apoptosis [41, 42] .",

PRRSV stimulates anti-apoptotic pathways early in infection while induces apoptosis late in infection [37] . Because of the genetic difference between type 1 and type 2 PRRSV, it is of interest to determine if modulatory roles in apoptosis are identical between the two types of PRRSV [13, 14] . A strain of type 2 PRRSV JXwn06 was used to infect MARC-145 cells in this study to examine whether type 2 PRRSV suppress apoptosis at the early stage of infection. MARC-145 cells were infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 1 for 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 10 h, and 12 h, separately. PRRSV-infected cells were incubated with STS, a chemical apoptosis inducer, for 4 h before terminating the infection. Cell viability assay showed that the STS treatment had no influence on the viability of MARC-145 cells (S1 Fig). Total cells lysates were then subjected to Western blot to examine the cleavage of PARP as a reliable hallmark of apoptosis induction [50] . As shown in Fig 1, in comparison with STS-treated uninfected cells, the PARP cleavages were less evident from 4 h post-infection (pi) to 8 h pi in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, and the reduction of PARP cleavage were significant at 6 h pi and 8 h pi (P<0.01), while the level of cleaved PARP was increased at 12 h pi. PRRSV Nsp1\u03b2 was examined to monitor viral replication, and newly synthesized Nsp1\u03b2 appeared as early as 6 h pi. These data suggested that type 2 PRRSV suppressed apoptosis at early infection, which is consistent to the type 1 PRRSV.",

Cell viability assay showed that the STS or TG treatment did not impact the viability of MARC-145 cells (S1 Fig). The activations of caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-12 in PRRSV-infected cells were investigated at 8 h, 12 h, 16 h, 24 h, 36 h and 48 h pi separately (Fig 3) , which represents the inductions of extrinsic pathway, mitochondria-dependent pathway, and ER stress-dependent pathway, respectively [52] . The induction of extrinsic pathway leads to the proteolytic processing of procaspase-8, the precursor of caspase-8 [3] . PRRSV-induced cleavage of procaspase-8 was determined by Western blot (Fig 3A) . It was shown that STS treatment could induce procaspase-8 cleavage in the uninfected cells compared to the untreated cells. In PRRSV-infected cells, procaspase-8 was significantly reduced from 16 h pi to 48 h pi, indicating the activation of extrinsic pathway at the late stage of infection. An anti-caspase-9 PAb was used to detect both caspase-9 precursor (procaspases-9) and its active form (cleaved caspase-9) (Fig 3B) . Upon PRRSV infection, the cleaved caspase-9 was undetectable until 24 h pi, while it became evident at 36 h pi and 48 h pi in comparison with the uninfected cells, and their significance were analyzed by densitometry analysis, suggesting that PRRSV-induced cleavage of caspase-9 is involveed in intrinsic pathway of apoptosis during the late infection. As shown in Fig 3C, cleaved caspse-12 appeared in the presence of TG, an inducer for caspase-12 activation. The level of cleaved caspase-12 was significant starting from 24 h pi (P<0.05), and increased prominently at 36 h pi and at 48 h pi (P<0.001).

To screen the viral apoptosis inducers in PRRSV, the cleavage of PARP in MARC-145 cells that were expressing individual Nsp of PRRSV was investigated by Western blot, and IFA was performed to determine the active form of caspase-3 in the cells that were expressing individual PRRSV Nsp using anti-caspase-3 p17 antibody interacting specifically with the cleaved caspase-3 ( Fig 5) .

The expression of Nsp9 induced limited PARP cleavage, which was insignificant in comparison with EV, according to the densitometry analysis. These results indicate the Nsp4 and Nsp10 are pro-apoptotic. Plasmids expressing individual HA-tag conjugated Nsp were constructed and transfected into MARC-145 cells, separately, and each of Nsp was detected by an anti-HA antibody.

The activation of caspase-8, -9 and -12 was examined by Western blot using anti-caspase-8 (A), anti-caspase-9 (B) and anti-cleaved (cle) caspase-12 (C) antibodies, respectively. \u03b2-actin was served as a protein loading control. The intensity of procaspase-8, cle-caspase-9, and cle-caspase-12 was normalized with the one of \u03b2-actin to obtain their relative levels. Significant differences of relative levels between control group and infected groups are indicated (* P<0.05; ** P<0.01; *** P<0.001).",

As shown in Fig 6B, the expression of Bid was increased significantly with the Nsp10 expression. In addition, tBid appeared only in the presence of Nsp10, whose level was significantly increased compared to EV, Nsp3, and Nsp4.

The active isoform Bim S was present in Nsp3, Nsp4, and Nsp10, while Bim S was significantly increased with the Nsp4 expression compared to EV. Isoform Bim L appeared exclusively in the cells that were expressing Nsp4. No significant changes were observed for isoform Bim EL in the presence of Nsps. Besides, no changes of Bax, another pro-apoptotic protein, were observed in the presence of Nsp3, Nsp4, and Nsp10. For anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 level with the expressions of Nsp3, Nsp4, and Nsp10 were comparable with EV, whereas Bcl-xL was significantly degraded in the presence of Nsp4 compared to the others.

Thus, it is vital for viruses to disable host cell apoptosis at early stage of the infectious cycle, thereby avoiding premature cell death and allowing viral replication. On the other hand, apoptosis can function to promote virus spread at late stage of infection by breaking down infected cells, or killing uninfected cells from the immune system [58] . Recent studies have demonstrated the biphasic apoptosis during virus infection [59, 60] . Type 1 PRRSV has been shown to possess a dichotomous apoptotic role in manipulating the apoptosis that the apoptosis is inhibited early in infection but induced late in infection [37] . In the present study, we demonstrated the identical kinetics of apoptosis in type 2 PRRSV-infected cells, suggesting the dichotomous apoptotic role is universal for PRRSV (Figs 1 and 2) . Based on the level of cle-PARP, a reliable hallmark of apoptosis, PRRSV was shown to suppress STS-induced apoptosis until 12 h pi in MARC-145 cells, suggesting an antiapoptotic event at the early stage of PRRSV infection (Fig 1A) . Interestingly, the level of cle-PARP appeared to be limited at the time point when the Nsp1\u03b2 was not detectable and less evident at 4 and 6 h pi (Fig 1A) . This finding suggest that small amount of PRRSV-encoded antiapoptotic products might be sufficient to suppress apoptosis. In addition, PRRSV has been shown to activate PI3K/Akt pathway together with p53 at the early stage of infection, leading to the suppression of apoptosis [35] .",

            "text": "In MARC-145 cells, PRRSV could induce apoptosis at 24 h pi with the presence of apparent apoptotic markers (Fig 2) . Our results also showed the apoptotic events in the natural host cells of PRRSV, PAMs, suggesting that PRRSV-induced apoptosis is cell type-independent. Compared to MARC-145 cells (24 h pi), an early apoptosis event in PRRSV-infected PAMs at 12 h pi (Fig 4) has been noticed as well. This difference is probably due to the high replication efficiency of PRRSV used in this sudy in PAMs [61] . Previous study has revealed the activations of capsase-8 and caspase-9, indicating that PRRSV can activate both extrinsic apoptotic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways [33] . In this study, we identified the activation of caspase-12 in addition to caspase-8 and caspase-9 in PRRSV-infected cells. Our results suggest PRRSV could induce ER stress-dependent pathways (Fig 3) . Our finding is consistent with a previous report that PRRSV activates ER stress with following induction on JNK pathway and apoptosis [35] . Among PRRSV-activated apoptotic signaling pathways, extrinsic pathway is the one with early initiation as the activated caspase-8 appeared at 16 h pi, while the induction of intrinsic pathway and ER stress-dependent pathway started after 24 h pi (Fig 3) . Such discrepancy suggests that stimuli for individual apoptotic pathways appear sequentially which relies on the stages of virus life cycle. PRRSV Nsps encoded by the replicase genes are essential for virus replication, pathogenesis and virulence [22, 23] . The roles of Nsps in modulating apoptosis were investigated in this study, and Nsp4 and Nsp10 were proved to function as viral apoptosis inducers (Fig 5) . PRRSV Nsp4 belongs to 3C-like serine protease (3CLSP) which mediates the proteolytic processing of polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab during PRRSV infection [62] . Several viral serine proteases have been proved to induce apoptosis, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 3CL pro , dengue virus type 2 NS3, and coxsackievirus B3 3Cpro [63] [64] [65] . PRRSV Nsp4 was shown to activate caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-12, indicating the involvements of extrinsic apoptotic pathway, mitochondria-dependent pathway, and ER stress-dependent pathway (Fig 6) . In addition, Nsp4 was able to manipulate the activities of Bcl-2 family members, Bim and Bcl-xL. Bim is a pro-apoptotic protein and processed into three isoforms upon activation, and all of these isoforms are able to promote apoptosis. The isoform Bim S could be detected in the presence of Nsp3, Nsp4, or Nsp10, whereas the isoform Bim L, whose expression is JNK pathway-dependent [66] , appeared exclusively in the presence of Nsp4 (Fig 6) . Because ER stress activates JNK pathway, and PRRSV Nsp4 was shown to induce ER-stress dependent apoptotic pathway, it is reasonable to suppose that Nsp4 activates Bim indirectly by inducing ER stress. On the contrary, Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic protein, was degraded in the cells that were expressing Nsp4 (Fig 6) , whose reduction has been proved in PRRSV-infected cells as well [34] . According to a recent study, protease activity of Nsp4 is required for apoptosis induction [41] . Thus, it is possible that Nsp4 is able to cleave Bcl-xL to eliminate its anti-apoptotic activities. However, more molecular details concerning the apoptosis induction by Nsp4 are required to be further done.",

            "text": "PRRSV Nsp10 contains a conserved N'-terminal zinc finger and NTPase/helicase activities resembling with superfamily 1 helicase domain [67] . Nsp10 is believed to be essential for genome replication as a helicase [68] , and our recent study has determined that Nsp9-and Nsp10-coding regions of HP-PRRSV are responsible for its replication efficiency in vitro and in vivo and fatal virulence for piglets [23] . In the present study, pro-apoptotic function of Nsp10 has been determined, adding a novel function for viral helicase within Nidoviruses. Besides PRRSV, the pro-apoptotic functions of viral helicases are limited to flaviviruses [69] [70] [71] . For instance, West Nile virus NS3 can activate caspase-8-dependent apoptosis, and both protease and helicase activities are involved in apoptosis induction. In the cells that were expressing Nsp10, extrinsic and mitochondria-dependent pathways could be induced with the exception of ER stress dependent pathway (Fig 6) . Interestingly, activation of caspase-8 has been proved to be indispensable for Nsp10 induced-apoptosis (Fig 7) . Nsp10-induced apoptosis also requires the pro-apoptotic functions of Bid protein (Fig 7) . Because activated Bid is fully involved in inducting intrinsic apoptotic pathway, it is suggested that Nsp10 can establish a crosstalk between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Our results confirmed the active Biddependent crosstalk in PRRSV infected cells, consequently, we assume that PRRSV-mediated crosstalk might rely on the pro-apoptotic function of Nsp10 [33] , and in this crosstalk, Nsp10 might initiate the apoptosis through the activation of caspase-8, and then the apoptotic signaling could be augmented by Bid. It is essential to further dissect the molecular mechanism in relation to the apoptosis induction by the Nsp 10 of PRRSV. ",

We also determined that the PRRSV-induced apoptosis are involved in the activation of extrinsic pathway, mitochondria-dependent intrinsic pathway, and ER stress-dependent pathway. The Nsp4 and Nsp10 of PRRSV are shown to be apoptosis inducers, and Nsp4 induces apoptosis through manipulations on the pro-or anti-apoptotic functions of Bcl-2 family members, and both activation of caspase-8 and Bid are required for Nsp10-induced apoptosis, suggesting the establishment of a crosstalk between extrinsic-and intrinsic-apoptotic pathways.
