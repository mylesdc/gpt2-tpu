However, an unintended consequence is the potential for fugitive emissions during patient treatment, which may pose a risk factor in both clinical and homecare settings. Methods: The current study examined the potential for fugitive emissions, using albuterol sulphate as a tracer aerosol during high-flow therapy. A nasal cannula was connected to a head model or alternatively, a interface was connected to a tracheostomy tube in combination with a simulated adult and paediatric breathing profile. Two aerodynamic particle sizers (APS) recorded time-series aerosol concentrations and size distributions at two different distances relative to the simulated patient. Results: The results showed that the quantity and characteristics of the fugitive emissions were influenced by the interface type, patient type and supplemental gas-flow rate. There was a trend in the adult scenarios; as the flow rate increased, the fugitive emissions and the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the aerosol both decreased. The fugitive emissions were comparable when using the adult breathing profiles for the nasal cannula and tracheostomy interfaces; however, there was a noticeable distinction between the two interfaces when compared for the paediatric breathing profiles. The highest recorded aerosol concentration was 0.370 \u00b1 0.046 mg m \u22123 from the tracheostomy interface during simulated paediatric breathing with a gas-flow rate of 20 L/min. The averaged MMAD across all combinations ranged from 1.248 to 1.793 \u00b5m by the APS at a distance of 0.8 m away from the patient interface. Conclusions: Overall, the results highlight the potential for secondary inhalation of fugitive emissions released during simulated aerosol treatment with concurrent high-flow therapy. The findings will help in developing policy and best practice for risk mitigation from fugitive emissions.",

In addition, high-definition videos have been used to estimate the dispersion distance of smoke particles, which mimicked exhaled aerosol released from non-invasive ventilation and mask ventilation [23, 24] . Ari et al. [25] examined the mechanical ventilation of a patient with and without expiratory filters, and in the cases without use of a filter, a 160-fold increase of the deposited drug was observed on the exhaust port. It was estimated that greater than 45% of the nominal dose could be fugitively released. Saeed et al.

Inhalation exposure was calculated for the adult nasal cannula scenario and the paediatric tracheostomy, both at 10 L/min, using the time-series averaged data for each scenario. To focus solely on the fugitive emissions from each interface, the five-minute baseline average of the aerosol concentration was subtracted from the time-series data.

The only exception was the nasal cannula at the paediatric breathing profiles at 10 L/min, which had a lower inhaled dose than at 20 L/min. Although there is no clear explanation for this result, one potential reason may be that at 20 L/min more aerosol was forced through the system, including, perhaps, some drug that has rained out in the head model. All the remaining trends were consistent with other studies. Perry et al. [13] examined the inhaled dose during high-flow nasal cannula therapy using the Aerogen Solo device. For simulated adult breathing, the inhaled doses were found to be 0.8% and 0.2% for gas-flow rates of 10 and 40 L/min, respectively. However, this study found 5.35 \u00b1 2.81% and 2.56 \u00b1 1.38% for 10 and 40 L/min, respectively. During simulated paediatric breathing, 1.2, 0.1 and 0% were found for gas-flow rates of 3, 10 and 20 L/min, as compared to this study's findings of 3.23 \u00b1 1.58, 0.42 \u00b1 0.06 and 1.17 \u00b1 0.28% for flow rates of 2, 10 and 20 L/min. Dailey et al. [36] examined the inhaled dose using a high-flow nasal cannula and reported considerably higher values of 26.7% to 27.4% at 10 L/min, 11.6% to 14.2% at 30 L/min and 3.5% to 5.9% at 50 L/min. Perry et al. [13] used a lower tidal volume for the paediatric breathing profiles setting than the present study; while Dailey et al. used an inspiratory-expiratory ratio of 1:2, an Albuterol sulphate mixture (2.5 mg/0.5 mL). Neither study reported the length of the tubing or the internal diameter of the nasal prongs making a direct comparison difficult. While there are differences between the studies at each flow rate, the overall trends remain similar. Direct comparisons between inhaled dose are difficult due to several factors influencing the drug available for inhalation, such as the position of components in the ventilator circuit, simulated breathing settings and humidification affect the inhaled dose [37] [38] [39] . Golshahi et al. [40] reported that increasing the tubing length from 20 cm to 50 cm increased the deposition fraction in the tube from 1.2% to 13.3%; this compared with a tube of length 1.8 m used in the current study.",

            "text": "In this study, a vibrating mesh nebuliser was used to generate the medical aerosol, previous work reported that with aerosol generated from VMN has a MMAD of 4 \u00b5m [28] . However, the observed averaged MMAD of the fugitive emissions ranged from 1.248 to 1.793 \u00b5m across all scenarios. The aerosol released into the environment was considerably smaller than originally generated by the nebuliser. The larger sized aerosol, in combination with the air flow, experiences greater inertia that can increase the rate of impaction and deposition of the larger sized aerosol within the system and upon the head model. The consequence of this is that the fugitively emitted aerosol is dominated by a lower sized fraction of aerosol, decreasing the MMAD. Bhashyam et al. [11] reported the volume median diameter of aerosol in a nasal cannula aerosol delivery system using a 3 L/min driving flow. The aerosol exiting the nebuliser was 5.0 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m, which reduced to 2.2 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m from an adult cannula and 1.9 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m from a paediatric cannula. Although higher gas-flow rates were used in the current study, similar trends were found with a decrease in the size fraction and the size leaving the patient interface. Berlinski [34] reported that the aerosol size fraction exiting the tip of the tracheostomy tube was 1.20 to 1.77 \u00b5m. Berlinski [33] reported that aerosol changed its characteristics when travelling through a tracheostomy tube; the effects were more noticeable for nebulised aerosol than metered dose inhalers or valved aerosol reservoirs. Additionally, during simulated adult breathing with gas-flow rates of 10, 40 and 60 L/min, there were comparable trends between the nasal cannula and the tracheostomy interface. This could indicate that the size distributions of fugitive emissions are independent of the patient interface and are governed instead by the flow velocities in these scenarios. The size fraction of the released aerosol has implications, as the aerosol can remain airborne for longer periods, which has been linked to secondary inhalation exposure [41] .",

However, previous research by McGrath at al.

Adult and paediatric head models were connected to patient interfaces; a facemask and mouthpiece without an expiratory filter on the exhaled port. When adjusted to reflect the analysis in the present study, aerosol concentration ranged from 0.221 to 0.323 mg m \u22123 , which is comparable with the observed concentration range of 0.290 to 0.370 mg m \u22123 in the current study.",

The caregiver inhaled 8.5% of the original drug using the nasal cannula, as compared to 10.2% for the tracheostomy. However, the bystander inhaled 3.2% for the nasal cannula scenario compared with 2.3% in the tracheostomy scenario. This was due to occurrence of the peak exposure, which has been previously documented in indoor air quality studies [45, 46] .",

The paediatric nasal cannula had smaller tubing dimensions and components, which could have affected the aerosol exiting the interface. For the adult nasal cannula (OPT 944), the inner diameter of the nasal prongs was 3.5 mm at the narrowest point, while for the paediatric nasal cannula (OPT 318), the inner diameter of the nasal prongs was 2 mm at the narrowest point. Studies have reported that the characteristics of the paediatric setup reduced the aerosol exiting the cannula during high-flow therapies [13, 47] . Since the same tubing and tracheostomy interface (12 mm at the narrowest point) was used for the adult and paediatric tracheostomy, with different breathing profiles, this could explain why the same differences were not observed in this case.",

To date, only limited studies exist that have examined fugitive emissions, once released into the surroundings. No studies have previously quantified time-series aerosol concentrations and the size distribution of fugitive emissions from high-flow therapy. Potential inhalation exposure to fugitive emissions during high-flow aerosol therapy was examined using adult and paediatric scenarios for both nasal cannula and tracheostomy interfaces. This study confirmed the release of fugitive emissions into the environment during aerosol high-flow treatment. The results showed that variations in interface type, patient (adult or paediatric) and gas-flow rates all impacted the quantity and characteristics of fugitive emissions. The highest aerosol concentration of 0.370 \u00b1 0.046 mg m \u22123 was recorded from the paediatric tracheostomy with a gas-flow rate of 20 L/min, which also corresponded to the second highest inhaled dose across all the scenarios. It was observed that as the gas-flow rate increased, the inhaled dose decreased, and the fugitive emissions decreased. Overall, the results can be used to develop approaches for healthcare providers and patients to inform best practice to mitigate the risks of fugitive emissions in clinical practice.",
