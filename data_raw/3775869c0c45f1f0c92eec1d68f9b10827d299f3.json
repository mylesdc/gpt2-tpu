Inclusion Criteria. We included randomized clinical trials testing Xiaoyaosan against placebo, antidepressants, or combined with antidepressants against antidepressants alone. Data Extraction and Analyses. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. Results. 26 randomized trials (involving 1837 patients) were included and the methodological quality was evaluated as generally low. The pooled results showed that Xiaoyaosan combined with antidepressants was more effective in comprehensive effect, the score of HAMD and the score of SDS compared with antidepressants alone. Xiaoyaosan was superior to antidepressants for the score of HAMD. However, Xiaoyaosan was not different from placebo for the score of SDS. There was no adverse effects reported in the trials from Xiaoyaosan. Conclusions. Xiaoyaosan appears to be effective on improving symptoms in patients with depression. However, due to poor methodological quality in the majority of included trials, the potential benefit from Xiaoyaosan need to be confirmed in rigorous trials and the design and reporting of trials should follow international standards.",

It affecting about 121 million people worldwide. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide, a tragic fatality associated with the loss of about 850 000 thousand lives every year. Depression is the leading cause of disability as measured by Years Lived with Disability (YLD). The World Health Organization has described depression as an \"unseen burden\" [1, 2] . It was the 4th leading contributor to the global burden of disease when measured by Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in 2000. By the year 2020, depression is projected to reach 2nd place of the ranking of DALYs calculated for all ages in both sexes. Today, depression is already the 2nd cause of DALYs in the age category 15-44 years for both sexes combined. Mood disorders have been shown to have a greater impact on quality of life compared with conditions such as hypertension and cardiac disease [3] .",

The majority of the included trials were assessed to be moderate methodological quality. The sample size of including trials varied from 24 to 200 patients. None of the 26 trials reported sample size calculation. Ten trials described the randomization procedure, six [10, 12, 15, 16, 23, 26] trials used random number table, four trials [8, 17, 25, 30] used visiting time to realize the randomization. One trial [23] used opaque envelopes to allocate concealment. Only four [12, 15, 23, 27] of the 26 trials employed a blinding procedure: three of them using patients blinding, doctors blinding, and assessors blinding, and the other one [27] mentioned single-blind without further details. Seven trials [8, 10-12, 15, 21, 25] reported the withdrawals/dropouts information. Three trials [13, 16, 26] mentioned follow-up, and neither of them used intention to treat method. The reporting quality of 26 trials according to quality assessment tool for quantitative studies varied among different trials (Table 3) . (Tables 4-6) 3 [9, 15, 18, 23, 30] used the percentage of HAMD scores reduced rate to measure the outcome: cure (HAMD scores reduced rate more than 75%), significant effective (HAMD scores reduced rate between 51% and 75%), effective (HAMD scores reduced rate from 25 to 50%) and ineffective (HAMD scores reduced rate less than 25%). None of the five trials showed significant difference between treatment and control group on the four criteria outcome measurement Two [17, 19] trials compared the effectiveness using the three criteria outcome measurement: significant effective (SDS scores reduced rate \u2265 50%), effective (50 > SDS scores reduced rate \u2265 30%), not effective (SDS scores reduced rate < 30%). The Total effective rate is the combination of \"cure\", \"significant effective \"and\" effective rate\". We put these two different kinds of measurements together to evaluate the general effectiveness.

First, the quality of the included studies is generally moderate according to the quality assessment tool for quantitative Studies (Effective Public Health Practice Project 2007) which was recommended on the Cochrane Handbook. It also indicated that there are moderate risk of bias in most of the trials. Due to inadequate reporting of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, intention to treat analysis and drop outs account in the majority of trials, it was possible that there was performance bias and detection bias due to patients and researchers being aware of the therapeutic interventions for the subjective outcome measures. Most of the trials provided limited descriptions of study design, randomization were mentioned but without further details after randomly assignment of patients which do not allow a proper judgment of the conduct of the trials. Therefore, we canot draw a confident conclusion that there are significant beneficial effects in patients with depression on combined groups or xiaoyaosan prescriptions using alone comparing to antidepressants. The number of trials identified limits us to perform meaningful subgroup or sensitivity analyses to illuminate robustness of the results in the review. Sixteen out of twenty-seven trials didnot described the blinding in details, only two trials [12, 15] used double-dummy in their study design.",

Further high-quality studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm the effectiveness of xiaoyaosan in treating depression. Proper randomization techniques need to be clearly described and fully reported. Blinding and double-dummy should be used and reported clearly although the double-dummy of the herbal decoction might be very difficult, blinding of patients and outcome assessors should be used to minimize performance and assessment biases. Intention-to-treat principle and appropriate method for including drop out into data analyses are also important in the design of the trials. Since different forms of xiaoyaosan prescriptions were used in patients with depression such as pills and decoctions, they are likely to have different onset time according to the existed trials. Therefore, future clinical trials may focus on particular subgroups or large sample size to evaluate the effect of different forms of xiaoyaosan prescriptions on treating patients with depression. Further randomized trials with well design and adequate sample size are warranted to support or refute the positive findings. Trials should be reported according to the CONSORT Statement [34] .",

The combination of xiaoyaosan and antidepressants may have shorter onset time compare to antidepressants using alone. The mechanism [12] may due to the regulating the levels of 5-HT, CORT, BDNF, IL-6. Since depression may occurred recurrently with or without treatment, a longer followup period with serial measurement of outcomes after the treatment is important to determine the effectiveness and long term effect of the xiaoyaosan prescription. Considering there are not sufficient amount of high-quality trials on xiaoyaosan prescription treating patients with depression, the effectiveness of xiaoyaosan prescription need further rigorous trials to prove.",
