This study estimates the rate of 72-hour ED revisits and identifies its reasons and predictive factors among adults with chronic diseases. Patients and methods: A hospital-based retrospective study that included 24,206 ED discharges for adults with chronic diseases at the adult ED of King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh between September 13, 2015 and July 29, 2017 was performed. We extracted data on demographic information, reasons for ED visits/revisits, health insurance coverage, weekend ED arrival, and mortality. Results: A sample of 24,206 ED discharges for 19,697 adults with at least one chronic disease was included in the analysis. The rate of 72-hour revisits in this study population was high: 3,144/24,206 (13%) had the first revisit and 319/3,144 (10.1%) had the second ED revisit within 72 hours. Diseases of the circulatory (19%) and genitourinary (15.8%) systems were the major reasons for the first ED revisit. The adjusted relative rate (aRR) of 72-hour ED revisits was higher in adults with chronic diseases and aged \ue02460 years (aRR=1.360, 95% CI: 1.41-1.83; P=0.001), patients of female gender (aRR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41; P=0.001), patients with health insurance coverage (aRR=4.23, 95% CI: 2.60-6.90; P=0.001), patients arriving to ED on a weekend (aRR=2.13, 95% CI: 1.03-4.41; P=0.041), and new patients (aRR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.25-1.73; P=0.001). Conclusion: The rate of 72-hour revisits is high among adults with chronic diseases. Advancing age, female gender, health insurance coverage, weekend ED arrival, and new patients are the important predictive factors of the high rate of 72-hour revisits. Continuous quality assessment and monitoring of factors related to patients are needed to reduce the frequency of early ED revisits after discharge.",

Patients' ages were divided into two groups (age group \ue02c60 and \ue02460 years).

Continuous quality assessment and monitoring of these factors may enhance the quality of ED care. In adults with chronic diseases, several factors were found to be associated with a higher rate of ED revisits within 72 hours of discharge. For instance, the rate of ED revisits was 24% higher for females than for males. In conflict with our study, male gender was reported to be a positive predictor for ED revisits within 72 hours of discharge. 10, 13, 18 It may not be possible to compare our findings with those of these studies due to methodological issues, since Ganti et al 13 studied specific population, patients with mild traumatic brain injury. Ahmed et al 19 studied patients with sickle cell disease. Although the bivariate results showed gender was not associated with ED revisits within 72 hours of discharge, in the multivariate results, a higher risk of ED revisits was found among patients of female gender. This discrepancy between the bivariate and multivariate analyses could be attributed to the adjustment of other factors such as elderly patient, new patient, weekend ED arrival, and health insurance coverage.",

The high rate of ED revisits in adults with chronic diseases and aged \ue02460 years may be due to an increased risk of developing a number of chronic diseases, which may cause unnecessary ED visits rather than seeking medical services at the primary care clinics. A study is needed in future to evaluate the access to primary care clinics and the reasons for avoiding ED visits and revisits in this population.",

A number of studies have documented that there was more ED utilization in individuals Table 2 Unadjusted and adjusted relative rates of revisits to eD within 72 hours of discharge in adults with chronic diseases (24,206 eD discharges) with Medicaid or health insurance coverage than in uninsured or privately insured individuals. [20] [21] [22] Moreover, adults with chronic diseases who visited the ED on weekends had a high rate of ED revisit within 72 hours of ED discharge. A study from Nebraska, USA, showed that the ED utilization rate was more on weekends than on workdays. 23 The main limitation of the study is lack of several confounding factors such as patient-related reasons for ED visits and the mode of arrival to the ED. The study was a retrospective study based on a single clinical center rather than multiple clinical centers, and a prospective evaluation of 72 hours of ED revisits. The authors were not able to track ED revisits reported in another clinical center. Other confounding factors were not gathered, such as details on the mode of arrival and the number of chronic diseases. Despite these limitations, this is the first study investigating the rate of ED revisits within 72 hours of ED discharge among adults with chronic diseases in Saudi Arabia. The study utilized a sample of 24,206 ED visits and accounted for multiple revisits within 72 hours of ED discharge for each patient.",
