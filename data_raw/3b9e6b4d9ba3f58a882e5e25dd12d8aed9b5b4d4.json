All these instructions were adopted by the Greek National Health System. The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the characteristics of all subjects admitted to the Unit of Infectious Diseases with symptoms indicating H1N1 infection, and to identify any differences between H1N1 positive or negative patients. Patients from the ED (emergency department) with flu-like symptoms (sore throat, cough, rhinorhea, or nasal congestion) and fever >37.5\u00b0C were admitted in the Unit of Infectious diseases and gave pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs. Swabs were tested with real-time reversetranscriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). Findings: Patients were divided into two groups. Group A comprised 33 H1N1 positive patients and Group B (control group) comprised of 27 H1N1 negative patients. The two groups did not differ in terms of patient age, co-morbidities, length of hospitalization, temperature elevation, hypoxemia, as well as renal and liver function. There were also no significant differences in severity on admission. C-reactive protein (CRP) (mean 12.8 vs. 5.74) and white blood count (WBC) (mean 10.528 vs. 7.114) were significantly higher in group B than in group A upon admission. Obesity was noted in 8 patients of Group A (mean 31.67) and 14 patients of Group B (mean 37.78). Body mass index (BMI) was lower in H1N1 positive than in H1N1 negative patients (mean 31.67 vs. 37.78, respectively; p = 0.009). Conclusions: The majority of patients in both groups were young male adults. CRP, WBC and BMI were higher among H1N1 negative patients. Finally, clinical course of patients in both groups was mild and uneventful.",

The H1N1 virus is a triple-reassortant influenza virus containing genes from human, swine, and avian influenza viruses. This is a case control study. Patients were selected from the influenza special clinic (emergency flu department) according to their attendance. Control group were patients with flu symptoms and signs with negative serological test. Most patients with H1N1 infection present flu-like symptoms with a benign course [6] . Patients with co-morbidities may have a serious clinical presentation with hypoxemia. The main cause of death is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [7] [8] [9] [10] . The first case of influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in the area of Thrace, Greece was documented in the University Hospital of Alexandroupolis on 10 th August 2009. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential differences on admission between H1N1 positive and negative patients with flu-like symptoms.",

It should also be mentioned that although RT-PCR is the most sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of influenza virus infection, upper respiratory tract specimens are not as specific (~80%) as lower respiratory tract specimens (~100%) [14] . All results were given in a period of time from 8 to 48 hours, and all patients remained under quarantine and isolation in negative pressure chambers according to WHO guidelines [15] . Our department prefers to use the Pneumonia Severity Index in order to evaluate the severity of the disease. However, this score was not different between the two groups. The Pneumonia Score Index was calculated for patients in both groups and the Class range was between II-IV [16] . We repeated HINI test 7 days after admission and no patient negative in the initial test became positive.",

Limitations of the study include that our data represent the experience of a single center, that procalcitonin test was given only in 51/60 patients and also Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) was sporadically collected during the follow up of the patients and so was not evaluated. Bacterial pneumoniae in association with influenza has been considered a important factor leading to poor patients outcomes in prior pandemics [26] . Even though none of the blood cultures were positive, we were unable to evaluate the effect of bacterial co-infection on patient outcomes, since blood cultures were obtained in only 17% of the study population (when fever \u226538\u00b0C) and workup for atypical pathogens was not performed. Although bacterial co-infection was not documented, the majority of the study population was treated with antibiotics. Prior publications failed to demonstrate any significant involvement of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized patients with 2009 H1N1 virus pneumonia [3, [27] [28] [29] . During the initial evaluation in 4/27 patients of group B and 6/33 of group A an antibiotic treatment was prescribed by a General Practitioner and none of these patients had a sputum culture at that time. Furthermore, we did not receive cultivable sputum samples from all patients. We supposed that false negative culture in pneumonia patients is mainly due to mixed microbial flora or the natural colonization admixture of the upper airway. The subgroup of patients with pneumonia in both groups is so small that any statistical analysis is impossible and the power of the sample is quite small. Future studies are necessary to define the best treatment of 2009 H1N1 virus pneumonia and the role of combination antiviral therapy. The lack of significant differences in the percentages of patients with hypoxemia between the two groups is probably due to the proximal number of patients with local patchy shadowing observed in group B and group A. (Table 2.) Obesity is known to be associated with influenza A (H1N1) viral infection, but in this cohort we observed that in group B there was a larger number of obese patients in opposition to group A (88.8% vs. 54.5%) (p = 0.009). We were unable to explain the reason that the majority of H1N1 patients were not obese in our study as in previous reported studies [9, 25] . Obesity is not a risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with seasonal influenza, but obesity has been suggested as a risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza infection in the USA [30] .",
