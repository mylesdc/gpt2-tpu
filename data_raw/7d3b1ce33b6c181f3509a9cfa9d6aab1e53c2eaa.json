None had acute liver failure but one patient died. Median AST and ALT values were significantly higher with increasing dengue severity by both WHO 1997 and 2009 criteria. However, they were poorly discriminatory between non-severe and severe dengue (e.g., AST area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve = 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57-0.67) and between dengue fever (DF) and DHF (AST area under the ROC curve = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.52-0.61).

Infection with dengue can cause acute, febrile illness or severe disease, which can lead to plasma leakage, bleeding, and organ impairment. One of the most prominent clinical characteristics of dengue patients is increased aspartate and alanine aminotransferase liver enzyme levels. The significance of this is uncertain, as it is transient in the majority of cases, and most patients recover uneventfully without liver damage. In this study, we characterized this phenomenon in the context of dengue severity and found that, although liver enzyme levels increased concurrently with dengue severity, they could not sufficiently discriminate between dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever or between non-severe and severe dengue. Therefore clinicians may need to use other parameters to distinguish dengue severity in patients during early illness.",

            "text": "The etiology of elevated aminotransferase levels during acute dengue illness is unclear since AST is expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle, red blood cells, kidneys, brain, and liver, while ALT is secreted primarily by the liver [28, 29] . Because dengue infection can cause acute damage to these non-hepatic tissue types that express AST, raised aminotransferase levels may not be entirely due to severe liver involvement. It is therefore possible that the patients with high AST levels were also more likely to be classified as severe dengue under the 2009 criteria due to the common pathways to non-hepatic tissue damage, even though there is no association with poorer outcome. Our retrospective study has some limitations. Aspartate and alanine aminotransferase values were tracked according to clinical judgment rather than at regular intervals during illness. We did not have dengue serotype data for each patient, but in 2006, DENV-1 was predominant in Singapore with a switch to DENV-2 in 2007-2008 [30] . Serology-positive cases were not included in primary analyses because our clinical laboratory used a rapid diagnostic test with potential for false positive results [31] , we did not have paired sera to confirm dengue diagnosis [9] , and not every patient with elevated AST or ALT was comprehensively evaluated for other etiologies of viral and non-viral hepatitis. Although serology-positive cases presented later during illness, we saw no difference in outcome. Five serology-positive patients (0.34%) required ICU admission versus 0.43% of PCR-positive cases, while four patients (0.27%) died in the serology-positive cohort, versus 1 patient (0.14%) among PCR-positive cases. However, relative data accuracy in our retrospective study was made possible by using a standardized dengue clinical care path. Another limitation of this study is the relatively few cases with substantially elevated liver aminotransferase levels. At the same time, since our cohort comprised primarily adults, additional studies in pediatric populations will be useful to confirm our findings.",
