The disease is caused by FMD virus (FMDV), a highly divergent small RNA virus of the genus Aphthovirus under the family Picornaviridae [2] . There are 7 serotypes of the virus namely O, A, C, Asia-1, SAT-1, SAT-2 and SAT-3. Infection with one serotype does not produce immunity to other serotypes. Among domesticated animals, cattle, buffalo, swine, sheep and goat are susceptible to the disease. African wild buffaloes maintain SAT serotypes of the virus in oropharyngeal region and act as carriers to cloven-hoofed wildlife [3] . The disease is transmitted via contaminated air and fomites or direct contact with infected animal. After infection, the virus replicates rapidly, and viremia occurs within a day. The virus transmission occurs at 0.3-0.7 day before the appearance of clinical signs [4] . Generally, FMD is characterized by formation of vesicles on the feet, buccal mucosa and mammary glands, and drooling of saliva in the form of string. After recovery, the affected animals retain the virus in their oro-pharynx and may act as a carrier for the disease transmission to the susceptible animals.",

FMD viral genome consists of a large single open reading frame (ORF) flanked by highly structured 5' and 3'untranslated regions (UTR). The 5' UTR is divided into five elements, S-fragment, poly C tract, pseudo-knots, cis-acting replicative element (cre), and internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The IRES serves for internal initiation of protein synthesis in cap-independent manner. The 3' UTR contains a short stretch of RNA which folds into a specific stemloop structure [6] of about 90 nucleotides, followed by a poly(A) tract of variable length. Both the UTRs play roles in virus translation and RNA replication. The ORF is translated to single polyprotein, which is subsequently processed by virus-encoded proteases (e.g. 3C pro ) to produce four structural and eight non-structural proteins. These proteins self-assemble to form icosahedral, virus-like particles (VLPs), which contain 60 copies of each structural protein (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) encapsidating the single stranded RNA genome.",

In India, the disease is caused by the serotypes O, A, and Asia-1 among which the serotype O is the most prevalent (93.3%) [7] . Currently, the disease is controlled by vaccination in developing countries while developed countries follow stamping out policy [8] . Inactivated whole virus vaccine has been widely used to control and prevent the disease. However, the preparation of the inactivated virus vaccine requires costly biocontainment facilities, large quantities of live virus and cold chain maintenance, and is associated with risk of escape of the live virus from the vaccine manufacturing unit to the environment and from vaccine due to incomplete activation, and is also not suitable for differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) strategy [1] .",

VLPs have been generated by use of various expression systems like vaccinia virus [11] , adenovirus [12] , Escherichia coli [13] and baculovirus [14] . VLPs of the FMDV have been produced in vitro by co-expression of P1-2A and 3C pro [15, 16] .

Vaccines based on inactivated whole viruses emulsified with adjuvant have been effectively used to control and prevent the disease in enzootic countries.

P1-2A-3C being a basic expression cassette of FMD virion is responsible for empty capsid particle formation [15] while 2B has been reported to induce rapid immune responses [28, 29] . In the present study, incorporation of 3B downstream of 2B in the expression cassette provides two additional cleavage sites for 3C pro besides increasing the genome size of the vector that may reduce the toxicity of 3C pro to the infected cells. It has been demonstrated that the length of the inserted gene affects the genetic stability of the vector and a genome size <75% or > 105% of the wild-type (wt) genome tends to rearrange to achieve a size closer to wt genome [36, 37] and may recombine to the packaging cell line genome to generate replication competent adenovirus. In our study, NA=Not applicable, means that the virus was not purified It is widely believed that wt 3C pro is toxic to the cells and adversely affects the expression of the recombinant proteins [38] . The present study reveals that the mutations in the wt 3C pro have not significantly affected the virus titer and expression of target antigen. This may suggest that mutations in 3C pro did not provide any replicative advantage to the virus. Our result demonstrated that the expression level of the target protein was not significantly correlated to the virus titer (Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.15441, p=0.6702 for hAd5/P1-2AB3BC wt and r=-0.5520, p=0.0980 for hAd5/P1-2AB3BC m ) as depicted in Table- 2. Further study, involving electron microscopy and animal immunization are necessary to confirm the formation of empty capsid particles and immunogenic potential of the recombinant adenovirus vaccines.",

Titer of the samples was calculated in duplicate and mean of the titers was used to correlate the thermal stability of the adenoviruses (virus titer at Y-axis) to the incubation time (X-axis). (a) Thermal stability of the viruses at 4\u00b0C, and (b) at 37\u00b0C is shown. b a size of the genome compared to dAd5. The growth kinetics of the viruses was found to be similar to those of the previous study involving hAd5 [39] and hAd3 [40] . Maximum growth was recorded during first 48 h which decreased later on which may be due to unavailability of sufficient healthy cells for a further round of virus replication. Our result of thermal stability of the viruses is in agreement with those of previous studies [41, 42] and found to be statistically significant. The dAd5 was less stable at 37\u00b0C compared to the recombinant viruses while hAd5/ P1-2AB3BC m was more stableat 4\u00b0C as compared to hAd5/P1-2AB3BC wt .
