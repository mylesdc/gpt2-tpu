            "text": "Background: Intracellular bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), infects specifically macrophages as host cells. IRAK-M, a member of IRAK family, is a negative regulator in TLR signaling and specifically expresses in monocytes and macrophages. The role of IRAK-M in intracellular growth of M. tb and macrophage polarization was explored, for deeply understanding the pathogenesis of M. tb, the significance of IRAK-M to innate immunity and pathogen-host interaction. Methods: IRAK-M expression was detected in M. tb infected macrophages and in human lung tissue of pulmonary tuberculosis with immunofluorescence staining, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. IRAK-M knock-down and over-expressing cell strains were constructed and intracellular survival of M. tb was investigated by acid-fast staining and colony forming units. Molecular markers of M1-type (pSTAT1 and iNOS) and M2-type (pSTAT6 and Arg-1) macrophages were detected using Western blot in IRAK-M knockdown U937 cells infected with M. tb H37Rv. U937 cells were stimulated with immunostimulant CpG7909 into M1 status and then infected with M. tb H37Rv. Expression of IRAK-M, IRAK-4 and iNOS was detected with immunofluorescence staining and Western blot, to evaluate the effect of IRAK-M to CpG directed M1-type polarization of macrophages during M. tb infection. Molecules related with macrophage's bactericidal ability such as Hif-1 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were detected with immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Results: IRAK-M increased in M. tb infected macrophage cells and also in human lung tissue of pulmonary tuberculosis. IRAK-M over-expression resulted in higher bacterial load, while IRAK-M interference resulted in lower bacterial load in M. tb infected cells. During M. tb infection, IRAK-M knockdown induced M1-type, while inhibited M2-type polarization of macrophage. M1-type polarization of U937 cells induced by CpG7909 was inhibited by M. tb infection, which was reversed by IRAK-M knockdown in U937 cells. IRAK-M affected Hif-1 and MAPK signaling cascade during M. tb infection. Conclusions: Conclusively, IRAK-M might alter the polarity of macrophages, to facilitate intracellular survival of M. tb and affect Th1-type immunity of the host, which is helpful to understanding the pathogenesis of M. tb.",

Macrophages primed with Th1 cytokine (IFN-\u03b3) in the presence of microbial ligands, polarize to pro-inflammatory M1type cells and develop the phenotypes typical of classically activated macrophages (CAM), leading to increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [6, 7] . In contrast, macrophages activated with Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13 or IL-10), polarize to distinct M2 phenotypes, M2a, M2b and M2c, respectively, associated with alternatively activated macrophages (AAM), which display anti-inflammatory, phagocytosis-promoting and tissuerepairing activities [8] . M2 macrophages are characterized by expression of typical markers, including arginase 1 (Arg-1), scavenger and mannose receptors (MR/CD206), anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [7, [9] [10] [11] [12] . Activation of M1 type macrophages is promoted by IFN-\u03b3-mediated Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (JAK-STAT1) signaling [5] . By contrast, STAT6 is required to drive activation of M2 macrophage during Th2 immune responses in the presence of IL-4 and/or IL-13 [13] .",

            "text": "It is noteworthy that intracellular bacteria prefer to utilize macrophages as their gateway and shelter invading into hosts. As key links of PAMP signaling pathway were analyzed, an intriguing molecule, IRAK-M was noticed. IRAK-M, named also as IRAK3, is restricted to express in certain cell types such as monocytes/macrophages and lung epithelial cells [14] and plays a negative role in PAMP-TLR signaling pathway, by means of inhibiting IRAK1/4 phosphorylation and dissociation [15] . IRAK-M belongs to IRAK family, which includes IRAK1/4, IRAK2 and IRAK-M. IRAK1 and IRAK4 are active kinases [16] . Upon stimulation, IRAK1 and IRAK4 phosphorylate and form complexes with TRAF6, to transmit the signaling forward to activate downstream signaling molecules, such as NF-\u03baB, IRF7 and JNK [17] . IRAK-M and IRAK2 have no kinase activity due to the lack of an aspartic acid residue. IRAK-M molecule combines with IRAK1/4 to form the IRAK-M complex, which induces the expression of negative regulators such as SOCS1, SHIP1, A20 and I\u03baB\u03b1. In this way, IRAK-M acts as a negative regulator in TLR signaling of monocytes and macrophages to restrict tissue damage upon excessive immune response [18] . It was reported that during M. tb infection, IRAK-M was involved in the restriction of Th1 anti-tuberculosis immunity [19] [20] [21] . Whether intracellular bacteria such as M. tb utilize IRAK-M to direct macrophage polarity and facilitate bacterial intracellular survival, deserves further investigation.",

Firstly, increased expression of IRAK-M was determined in M. tb infected macrophage cells and also in lung tissue of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. As a negative regulator involved in innate immunity, along with induction of kinase activity of IRAK1/4 during infection, IRAK-M interacts with IRAK4 to induce transcription of downstream inhibitors such as A20, I\u0138B\u03b1, SOCS-1 and SHIP, to prevent radical immune pathology of the host [14, 18] . As shown in Fig. 4 , CpG7909, the ligand of TLR9, induced IRAK4 increase. Meanwhile, IRAK-M was also increased, which is consistent with the description that IRAK-M plays a balanced role in IRAK1/4 activity. Interestingly, during M. tb infection, IRAK-M continued to increase, while IRAK4 increase induced by CpG7909 was suppressed. The biological significance of the IRAK-M increased to the intracellular survival of M. tb was further investigated in IRAK-M knockdown and over-expression cell systems. We found that the IRAK-M expression was beneficial for M. tb intracellular survival and proliferation. IRAK-M might be utilized by intracellular bacteria such as M. tb to act as their in vivo shelter.",

            "text": "We suspected that intracellular survival of M. tb affected by IRAK-M expression level might be related with macrophage polarization to M1 or M2 phenotypes. Functionally, M1-type macrophages were highly bactericidal, while M2 were active in anti-inflammation, promoting phagocytosis and tissue-repair [33] . Investigations in U937 cells indicated that M. tb infection induced both M1-and M2-type polarized macrophages. However, in M. tb infected IRAK-M knockdown U937 cells, M1-type polarization of U937 was enhanced, while M2-type polarization of U937 was inhibited. We further used an immunostimulant, CpG7909, to direct U937 cells firstly into M1 status and then infected cells with M. tb. CpG (Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine) is a ligand of TLR9, which is able to induce innate immune responses and also strong Th1-type immunity [34, 35] . CpG7909 is a relatively mature and safe CpG, which has been used in clinical treatment of cancer, allergies, asthma and also used as vaccine adjuvant of hepatitis B, malaria [36, 37] . In our previous work, CpG7909 was used as adjuvant of an anti-tuberculosis subunit vaccine. CpG7909 was able to enhance Th1-type immunity induced by subunit vaccine [38] . In the current work, it was determined that, as immunostimulant, CpG7909 induced M1 polarization of U937 cells, however, M. tb infection suppressed CpG7909-evoked M1 polarization. Strikingly, as IRAK-M was knocked down, the suppression of CpG7909-induced M1 polarization due to M. tb infection, was reversed, implying that IRAK-M facilitates M. tb intracellular survival via inhibiting M1-type or promoting M2-type polarization of macrophages.",

The negative regulatory role of IRAK-M might contribute to this phenomenon. IRAK-M plays a negative regulatory role in most of TLR signaling pathway, including TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 [15] . New type adjuvants such as CpG DNA, which is developed from TLR ligands, are able to induce Th1 immunological responses of the host via IRAK1/4 signaling, which might be simultaneously balanced by IRAK-M. During M. tb infection, M. tb might utilize IRAK-M, a negative regulator located upstream in TLR signaling, to reverse the host's immunity into their favorable status, which suppresses the effect of antituberculosis vaccine.",

During M. tb infection, relative hypoxia of human tuberculous granulomas contributes to M. tb latent infection phenotypes and the associated resistance of M. tb to host and pharmacological killing [39, 40] . Recently, it was reported that Hif-1 regulates the shift of energy metabolism of macrophages activated by IFN-\u03b3 into aerobic glycolysis and the positive feedback loop between Hif-1 and glycolysis reinforces activation of macrophages and control of M. tb infection [41] .We have previously reported that activation and phosphorylation of MAPK ERK1/2 prevents Hif-1\u03b1 from ubiquitination and promotes the consequent nuclear import of Hif-1 complex [42] . In the current work, it was shown that during M. tb infection, both in infected U937 cells and in human tissue of pulmonary tuberculosis, Hif-1\u03b1 obviously increased. Surprisingly, as IRAK-M was knocked down, expression of both Hif-1\u03b1 and MAPK was increased, indicating that IRAK-M was involved in regulating Hif-1\u03b1 and MAPK signaling cascade during M. tb infection. Both MAPK and Hif-1 are nuclear factors, transcriptionally inducing expression of downstream molecules, to regulate cell's adaptive responses to infections or other stress factors [30, 43] . The mechanism of IRAK-M affecting MAPK and Hif-1 signaling cascade, and whether MAPK and Hif-1 are involved in IRAK-M directing macrophage's polarization, remains further research. Furthermore, the mechanism, how IRAK-M acts as access board for intracellular bacteria such as M. tb to deviate polarization of macrophages, delay antigen-presentation and bactericidal activity of macrophages, resist Th1-type anti-tuberculosis immunity of the host, will be worthy of further investigation.",
