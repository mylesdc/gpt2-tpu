However, despite these catastrophic events little Information is available on bat defences or how they interact with their pathogens. Even less is known about the response of bats to infection during torpor or long-term hibernation. Using tissue samples collected at the termination of an experiment to explore the pathogenesis of White Nose Syndrome in Little Brown Bats, we determined if hibernating bats infected with the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans could respond to infection by activating genes responsible for innate immune and stress responses. Lesions due to fungal infection and, in some cases, secondary bacterial infections, were restricted to the skin. However, we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts of RNA from these sites. We therefore examined lungs for response at an epithelial surface not linked to the primary site of infection. We found that bats responded to infection with a significant increase in lungs of transcripts for Cathelicidin (an anti-microbial peptide) as well as the immune modulators tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins 10 and 23. In conclusion, hibernating bats can respond to experimental P. destructans infection by activating expression of innate immune response genes.",

Circumstantial evidence even suggests that most human and domestic animal pathogens of at least four viral families -Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Lyssaviridae and Filoviridae may have arisen in bats [15] [16] [17] and bats are more likely than rodents to host zoonotic viruses [18] .

It appears to be a recent introduction to the northern Americas [21] and in recent years has been responsible for the death of an estimated 6 million bats and the potential regional extinction of some species [22, 23] . This disease is called White Nose Syndrome (WNS) for the white fungal mycelia on the faces and wings of affected bats. Although damage caused by the fungus is restricted to the superficial skin, infected bats clearly show signs of systemic physiological perturbation such as dehydration, hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis [24] . Infected bats arouse from torpor more frequently than uninfected bats [25, 26] possibly leading to emaciation.",

To test the hypothesis that bats mount a systemic response to infection we examined lungs as an example of an epithelial surface which could have come in contact with aerosolized fungal spores despite being remote from the site of infection or may have responded to infection of peripheral areas [27, 28] .",

During hibernation M. lucifugus body temperature is maintained within 1-2uC of ambient temperature for weeks at a time with return to normothermic temperatures during periodic arousal [24, 25] . It is difficult to imagine mammalian gene expression at temperatures this low and it is possible that the genes were transcribed during the arousal periods. Our previous study indicated that P. destructans-infected bats aroused more frequently than uninfected bats [25] , a pattern which has also been observed in the wild [26] and this may also have contributed to higher basal levels of gene expression in their cells. However, our observation that the levels for IL 23, Cathelicidin, IL 10 and TNFa and not the other transcripts examined (Dectin 1, Defensin B1, Hepcidin, IL 17, Cytchrome B, heat shock protein 70, nitrogen oxide synthetase) were higher in the lungs of infected bats, suggest that the response was a specific to infection.",

The increase in levels of IL 23, Cathelicidin and IL10 correlated with the lung interstitial scores ( Table 2) . Little is known about the role in bats of these bioactive proteins, information from other species indicates that they are intimately involved in the response to infection. For instance:",

Its effect is to suppress Th1 responses and stimulate Th2 responses leading to B-cell survival and proliferation and antibody synthesis. IL10 is produced by a number of cell types including monocytes, and activated subsets of regulatory and helper T-cells B-cells. Its synthesis is tightly regulated and is mediated by the NFkB and AP1 pathways after stimulation by commensal and pathogenic microorganisms [33] . If the role of IL10 in WNS is indeed to direct the immune system to a Th2 response, our results are in contrast with those of Moore et. al. [34] who found increased levels of IL4 in the serum of WNS-affected bats. Work in other species suggests that IL4 directs the immune system to a Th1 response.",

However, these observations may be explained by: a) Injury in the skin can lead to complement-induced TNFa expression in the lungs followed by inflammation and neutrophil infiltration [27] . b) Immune responses at mucosal surfaces are coordinated, with stimulation at one surface leading to responses at other mucosae [36] . The pulmonary response may have been due to stimulation of the upper respiratory tract by fungal spores. c) There have been suggestions that hibernating mammals show marked leukopenia [20] raising the possibility that circulating leukocytes are sequestered in some organ, possibly the lungs. The infected animals may have responded to inflammation in the wings with an increase in neutrophils, which then migrated to the lungs. d) Lung neutrophils in infected bats, and the accompanying increase in the transcripts of the immune modulators may represent the end of the infectious process in the lungs and the removal of fungal spores and hyphae. This suggests that bats are capable of suppressing a lung or systemic infection by P. destructans and may explain why WNS, the disease, occurs only after bat-to-bat contact rather than by infection through inhalation.",

Each square (control) or dot (infected) represents the value from a bat. The relative levels of a transcript for each bat are depicted as Cycle threshold (Ct) normalized separately (DCt) for levels of transcripts for two ''house-keeping genes -Glycerol 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and Cytochrome B. The horizontal bar represents the mean while the vertical bar indicates standard deviation from the mean. Significance (P), test statistics (t) and degrees of freedom (df) are indicated. A lower value of one (1) DCt (or Ct) indicates approximately a twofold higher concentration of RNA. Infected bats as a group had lower DCt values for the four genes. The histograms represent fold differences between infected and control bats. Only results from reactions that yielded unambiguous results (products of the expected size and sequence, homogenous denaturation profiles, no products for no-template controls) were used for analysis. The number of results that fitted these criteria for each analysis were: IL23 -Control = 17, Infected = 13; Cathelicidin -Control = 17, Infected = 28; IL10 -Control = 5, Infected = 6; TNFa -Control = 5, Infected = 9. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0112285.g001Innate Immune Responses in M. lucifugus Infected with P. destructans PLOS ONE | www.plosone.orgTable 2.
