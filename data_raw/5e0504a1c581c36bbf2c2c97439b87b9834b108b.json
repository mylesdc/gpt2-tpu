            "text": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus that is associated with the pathogenesis of several human lymphoid malignancies, including Hodgkin's lymphoma. Infection of normal resting B cells with EBV results in activation to lymphoblasts that are phenotypically similar to those generated by physiological stimulation with CD40L plus IL-4. One important difference is that infection leads to the establishment of permanently growing lymphoblastoid cell lines, whereas CD40L/IL-4 blasts have finite proliferation lifespans. To identify early events which might later determine why EBV infected blasts go on to establish transformed cell lines, we performed global transcriptome analyses on resting B cells and on EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts after 7 days culture. As anticipated there was considerable overlap in the transcriptomes of the two types of lymphoblasts when compared to the original resting B cells, reflecting common changes associated with lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Of interest to us was a subset of 255 genes that were differentially expressed between EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts. Genes which were more highly expressed in EBV blasts were substantially and significantly enriched for a set of interferon-stimulated genes which on further in silico analyses were found to be repressed by IL-4 in other cell contexts and to be up-regulated in micro-dissected malignant cells from Hodgkin's lymphoma biopsies when compared to their normal germinal center cell counterparts. We hypothesized that EBV and IL-4 were targeting and discordantly regulating a common set of genes. This was supported experimentally in our B cell model where IL-4 stimulation partially reversed transcriptional changes which follow EBV infection and it impaired the efficiency of EBVinduced B cell transformation. Taken together, these data suggest that the discordant regulation of interferon and IL-4 pathway genes by EBV that occurs early following infection of B cells has relevance to the development or maintenance of an EBV-associated malignancy.",

Some aspects of this self -limiting proliferation can be replicated in vitro through combinations of signals; one widely-used method of generating B cell blast involves costimulation with CD40L and IL-4. In this context, the pleiotropic IL-4 cytokine acts as an essential proliferation signal [1, 2] , although its effects on malignant cells can be anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

However, only 9 or 10 viral proteins are regularly expressed in LCLs, which generally display a nonproductive or 'latent' infection [16] . Of the transformationassociated latent viral proteins, at least one, LMP1, is oncogenic by classical criteria; its ectopic expression in model rodent fibroblast lines leads to cellular transformation in vitro and acquisition of a tumorigenic phenotype in vivo [17, 18] . Although showing no overall sequence homology with any cellular proteins, LMP1 functions as a constitutively-active member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family which includes CD40 [19] . LMP2A is a trans-membrane signaling protein that behaves as a constitutively active functional homologue of the B cell receptor [20, 21] . The remaining transformation-associated proteins are mostly nuclear proteins (EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, EBNA3C and EBNA-LP), which again show no significant homology to cellular proteins although their effects on regulation of cellular transcription and signaling pathways are well-studied [15] . Transformation of B cells by EBV cannot be attributed to a single viral oncogene. Rather, the cooperative functions of multiple viral genes are required, as demonstrated by studies with recombinant EBVs, which show that deletion of any one of EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3C or LMP1 genes will abolish or substantially reduce transforming ability [22, 23] .",

RNA quality was monitored using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Stockport UK) then prepared for transcriptional profiling on GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix, High Wycombe UK) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 100 ng of RNA was used to transcribe single stranded cDNA using oligo dT primers. A second strand was then synthesised and the double stranded cDNA purified. This double stranded cDNA was used as a template to generate fluorescently labelled cRNA by in vitro transcription, which was purified and fragmented before being hybridised to the microarray chip.",

            "text": "We first confirmed a relationship between IFN and IL-4 pathways using the datasets generated by Schoggins et al [31] and Elo et al [35] . IL-4 transcriptional targets were enriched for both ISGs and IRF-1 regulated genes ( Figure 2 , Table 4 ). Most notably, as shown in Table 4B , genes that were down-regulated by IL-4 were substantially and significantly enriched both for ISGs (OR = 19.6, x 2 1df = 998, p,0.0001) and for IRF-1 induced genes (OR = 57.7, x 2 1df = 1271, p,0.0001). In light of this, and considering the relationship between subsets of EBV-regulated genes and ISGs and IRF-1 targets (Table 3) , it was perhaps unsurprising that genes up-regulated by EBV were enriched for genes down-regulated by IL-4 (OR = 7.7, x 2 1df = 244, p,0.0001; Table 4B ). In addition, genes that were expressed at significantly greater levels in EBV blasts than in CD40L/IL-4 blasts showed an even greater enrichment of genes down-regulated by IL-4 (OR = 19.0, x 2 1df = 441, p,0.0001; Table 4B ). This link between IL-4 signaling and EBV infection was confirmed directly in our B cell model by analysis of a selection of the genes reported by Elo et al to be down-regulated in T cells but which we found to be up-regulated following EBV infection. The results for six such genes (IFIT1, IFIT3, IFITM1, OAS2, IFI44 and USP18) are shown in Figure 3A . In each example, EBV infection caused a substantial up-regulation of transcripts but the addition of IL-4 coincident with EBV infection led to a significant down-regulation of transcripts, albeit never to the low levels detected in control uninfected cells with or without IL-4. Furthermore, when examining 2 sample genes (SPINT2, DUSP6) shown by Elo et al to be up-regulated by IL-4 in T cells but, in our B cell experiments to be down-regulated by EBV infection, we again found that coincident IL-4 stimulation and EBV infection attenuated the effects of EBV infection ( Figure 3B ). [28, 29] to identify Panther Biological Processes terms for which there was a significant enrichment of genes. The lists of probe-sets entered into DAVID v6.7 and the complete analyses readouts are given in Data-File S1. The probe-sets analyzed were those which were: (A) differentially expressed between EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts at day 7, (B) the subset of differentially expressed genes that was expressed higher in EBV blasts than in CD40L/IL-4 blasts, and (C) the subset of differentially expressed genes that was expressed lower in EBV blasts than in CD40L/IL-4 blasts. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0064868.t002 [36, 37] . We therefore asked whether the discordant regulation of genes intersecting the IFN and IL-4 response pathways in EBVinfected B cells might also be relevant to malignant transformation in HL. As the normal counterparts of the malignant HRS cells of HL are germinal center (GC) B cells, we first determined whether the EBV/ISG/IL-4 associations could also be demonstrated in a GC B cell model of EBV infection in vitro. To this end, we reprised our comparisons on a previous array experiment [37] in which we had profiled germinal center (GC) B cells six weeks following their infection with EBV to yield lymphoblastoid cell lines (GC-LCLs). Consistent with our comparison of EBV and CD40L/IL-4 stimulated blasts at day 7, we found that genes up-regulated by EBV in GC-LCLs were significantly and substantially enriched for those down-regulated by IL-4 in T cells (OR = 12.0, x 2 1 df = 586, 1df p,0.0001; Table 5 ). Quantitative RT-qPCR assays for selected cellular gene transcripts in peripheral blood B cell cultures in normal medium or containing IL-4 (assayed at 6 hrs), or infected with EBV in normal medium or containing IL-4 (assayed at 7 days). The results are expressed as mean 6 SEM of three replicate experiments using B cells from different donors. An established LCL was used as a reference for all assays, and all values are shown relative to LCL transcript expression = 1, except for SPINT2 and DUSP6 whose expression in the reference LCL was extremely low (ddCt,12) and where expression is shown relative to control B cell cultures. The six cellular genes shown in (A) were reported by Elo et al [35] to be down-regulated by IL4 in T cells, whilst the 2 genes shown in (B) were reported to be up-regulated by IL-4 in T cells. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0064868.g003",

            "text": "The transcriptional profile induced by EBV in the GC-LCL model, which we have just described, was shown previously to overlap that of HRS cells micro-dissected from biopsies of HL [37, 38] . Therefore, we next examined the overlap between IL-4 transcriptional targets and genes found to be differentially expressed in micro-dissected HRS cells from 12 cHL when compared with non-malignant GC centrocytes isolated from tonsillar lymphocytes by fluorescence activated cell sorting. We found that genes up-regulated in micro-dissected HRS cells were enriched for genes which were down-regulated by IL-4 in T cells (OR = 13.8, x 2 1 df = 724, 1df p,0.0001; Table 6 ). We hypothesized that if those EBV-induced ISGs which intersected the IL-4 signaling response and were discordantly regulated by EBV and IL-4, were to contribute to the process of transformation in HL, then genes that were up-regulated in microdissected HRS cells would be enriched for genes which were also up-regulated in EBV infected GC B cells but down-regulated in IL-4 treated CD4 T cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the odds of a gene up-regulated in GC-LCL cells also being up-regulated in HRS cells were almost 5 times greater (OR = 4.9; 95% CI = 2.9 to 8.5) when that gene was also downregulated by IL-4 in T cells compared to when it was not ( Figure 5) . By way of a sensitivity analysis, we repeated the above analysis but this time using the transcriptional profiles generated by a recently published comparison of EBV-positive and EBV-negative microdissected HRS cells with micro-dissected GC cells from reactive lymph node sections [39] . Although attenuated, the point estimate of association remained significant and the 95% confidence intervals around the estimates generated by these comparisons all overlapped (Figures S1 and S2) . Notably, comparison of EBVpositive and EBV-negative HRS tumors with normal GC cells gave essentially similar results (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.1-3.4 for EBV-positive HRS; OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.4-4.3 for EBVnegative HRS).",

We identified a total of 92 signature genes fulfilling these HRS/EBV/IL-4 criteria (Table S2) , and comparison with our previously published array datasets [41, 42] showed that 29/92 (32%) of these genes were indeed up-regulated by LMP1 (26 genes) or by LMP2A (5 genes) or by both (2 genes) in GC-B cells (Table 7) .",

            "text": "This study on the transcriptional programs of EBV infected B cells and CD40L/IL-4 stimulated B cells has identified a critical set of genes at the intersection of the IFN and IL-4 signaling pathways that modulate the transforming functions of EBV. Although the transcriptomes of EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts showed substantial overlap, reflecting common proliferation and apoptosis related pathways, the expression of 255 genes was found to differ significantly between the two types of blasts (p,0.01; FC.2). Initial gene ontology analysis indicated that this set of 255 genes was substantially enriched for genes involved in innate cellular responses to viral infection, most notably ISGs. At first glance, this enrichment might seem an entirely predictable consequence of the innate responses to a viral infection, which results in activation of IFN pathways aimed at preventing viral genome replication, inhibiting cell proliferation and/or inducing cell death. However, EBV infected cells are not growth-inhibited or dying any more so than CD40L/IL-4 stimulated cells. Upon infection of cells by viruses, the ISGs are regulated in response to ligation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptor family members recognising virion glycoproteins or DNA/RNA [43] . EBV has the potential to activate several PRRs, including TLR3 and TLR7 [44, 45] , and a role for viral RNAs, most notably the EBERs, in triggering IFN production and IFN responses is well-established [46, 47] . As with other viruses, EBV has to modulate these innate intracellular responses in order to successfully infect and persist in the cells. The prevailing evidence suggests that EBV not only evades the intended consequences of innate intracellular responses, but actually subverts them to facilitate growth-transformation [44, 48, 49] . Consistent with this property of EBV, co-stimulation of TLR9 with the CpG synthetic ligand during EBV infection of B cells in vitro, actually enhances LCL outgrowth [48, 49] . There are likely to be several molecular mechanisms by which EBV utilizes the pro-proliferative effects of TLR and IFN signaling whilst avoiding the anti-viral end-points of growth-inhibition and apoptosis. One intriguing example identified by Martin et al [44] was the induction of alternatively-spliced IRF-5 transcripts that inhibit the anti-proliferative effects of the regular IRF-5 isoform. Another novel possibility is suggested from our analysis of the ISGs that are differentially expressed between EBV blasts and CD40L/IL4 blasts (Table 3) . Although only 6 ISGs were expressed at significantly lower levels in EBV blasts, one of these was RNF19B (expressed 2.9x lower in EBV blasts; p = 0.0012), a E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets substrates such as UCKL1 for degradation; UCKL1 is a uridine kinase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase that binds to EBV EBNA3A, an interaction that leads to a nuclear accumulation of UCKL1 that has been hypothesized to be important for EBV-induced proliferation [50] .",

Furthermore, this effect of IL-4 was correlated with a significant impairment of transformation efficiency (Figure 4) . The results of these experiments are also consistent with the observation that while IL-4 can act as a potent co-stimulus for proliferation survival and differentiation in both B and T lymphocytes, hence its widespread experimental use in generating B cell blasts, it also has a modest inhibitory effect on proliferation and induces apoptosis most notably in human B cell neoplasms, and in some non-hematopoietic malignant cells [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . They also suggest that where EBV and IL4 impact on common signaling pathways, for example, the induction of this subset of ISG, the EBV transcriptional program must prevail for transformation to occur.",

Although IL-4 is not usually expressed in HL [60] [61] [62] , IL13 with which it shares functional receptors [63, 64] and remarkably similar biological functions is expressed [65] . Furthermore, proliferation of HL-derived lines in vitro and in vivo is reduced by antibodies to IL-13 or by decoy receptor molecules, suggesting that IL-13 can act as an autocrine growth-factor in HL [66, 67] . Activated STAT6, which is an essential mediator of many IL-4/ IL-13-regulated genes [35] is usually detected in HL along with activated STAT3 [66] . However, IFN can inhibit activation of STAT6 by cytokines [68] and is also expressed by the HRS cells of HL [69] . Furthermore, IL-13 in the lesions of EBV-positive cases of HL would be expected to induce and maintain the high levels of LMP1 expression in the absence of EBNA2 in these tumors [70] , which in turn would stimulate expression of ISGs [44] . Therefore, extrapolating from our in vitro transformation experiments (Figures 3, 4) , we suggest that the pathogenesis of HL is a consequence in part of competing and conflicting influences on genes which are at the intersection of the IFN and IL-4/IL-13 pathways, and whose dysregulation is necessary for cellular transformation.",

Furthermore, a recent study by Steidl et al [39] , who arrayed micro-dissected HRS cells from 7 EBV-positive and 17 EBVnegative classical HL samples, indicated a remarkable similarity in their transcriptomes; only 56 probe-sets corresponding to just 46 annotated genes were differentially expressed between the EBVpositive and -negative tumors (.2FC, p,0.01; taken from the supplementary information of the Steidl paper). This in no way undermines our conclusions, rather it adds to the body of evidence that EBV infection is but one route to the development of this tumor. For example, a major signaling function of LMP1 is to constitutively activate NF-kB [71] [72] [73] and many EBV-negative cases of HL carry mutations of NF-kB pathway genes that effect the same result [74, 75] .",
