To combat the surge of viral diseases, new treatments are urgently needed. Here we show that small-molecules, which inhibit cellular anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-2i), induced the premature death of cells infected with different RNA or DNA viruses, whereas, at the same concentrations, no toxicity was observed in mock-infected cells. Moreover, these compounds limited viral replication and spread. Surprisingly, Bcl-2i also induced the premature apoptosis of cells transfected with viral RNA or plasmid DNA but not of mock-transfected cells. These results suggest that Bcl-2i sensitizes cells containing foreign RNA or DNA to apoptosis. A comparison of the toxicity, antiviral activity, and side effects of six Bcl-2i allowed us to select A-1155463 as an antiviral lead candidate. Thus, our results pave the way for the further development of Bcl-2i for the prevention and treatment of viral diseases.",

The samples were filtered. Sample analysis was performed on an Acquity UPLC-MS/MS system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). The detection system, a Xevo TQ-S tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), was operated in both positive and negative polarities with a polarity switching time of 20 msec. Electro spray ionization was chosen as the ionization mode with a capillary voltage at 0.6 kV in both polarities. The source temperature and desolvation temperature of 120 \u2022 C and 650 \u2022 C, respectively, were maintained constantly throughout the experiment. The declustering potential and collision energy were optimized for each compound. The Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) acquisition mode was selected for the quantification of the metabolites with an individual span time of 0.1 s given in their individual MRM channels. The dwell time was calculated automatically by the software based on the region of the retention time window, the number of MRM functions, and also depending on the number of data points required to form the peak. MassLynx software (version 4.1, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) was used for data acquisition, data handling, and instrument control. Data processing was done using TargetLynx software (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA), and the metabolites were quantified by calculating the curve area ratio using labeled internal standards and external calibration curves. The metabolomics data was log2 transformed for linear modeling and empirical-Bayes-moderated t-tests using the R/Bioconductor software package limma [42] . To analyse the differences in metabolites levels, a linear model was fit to each metabolite. The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to correct for multiple testing. The significant metabolites were determined at a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) controlled at 10%. The heatmap was generated using the pheatmap package based on log transformed profiling data. MetaboAnalyst (version 3.0, McGill University, Ste. Ann de Bellevue, QC, Canada) was used to identify the metabolic pathways associated with virus infection or affected by Bcl-2i treatment [43] .",

A co-immunoprecipitation experiment using antibodies against pro-survival Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, or Mcl-1 followed by mass spectrometry showed that several cellular proteins, including Bad, Bax, Bak, UACA, PAWR, FLII, Trim21, IMMT, 14-3-3, EFHD2, DHX9, DDX3, NLRP3, and LRRFIP2, as well as viral factors M1, NS1, HA, and NP were present in the complexes ( Figure S2) . Thus, these experiments demonstrated that pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (Bad, Bax, Bak), PRRs (DHX9, DDX3, LRRFIP2), and other factors can be involved in the programmed death of IAV-infected cells.",

ABT-263 treatment lowered IAV production in RPE cells, as indicated by the fold change between virus titers ( Figure 1D,E) . We obtained similar results in A549 cells ( Figure S3 ). Furthermore, ABT-263 activated caspase 3 in IAV-infected but not in non-treated or ABT-263-treated mock-infected RPE cells at 12 h post infection ( Figure S4 ).

Supplementary movies 1 and 2 further reaffirm that the treatment of pancreatic cancer cells infected with SFV with ABT-263 at low moi attenuated the replication and spread of the virus in these cells.

This structural change is not seen with ABT-263, ABT-737, and ABT-199 binding as these compounds contain chlorophenyl moiety compared to A-115463, A-1331852, and WEHU-539 benzothiazole moiety. Moreover, A-1155463 has additional moiety, which perturbs the Bcl-xL structure and may affect its binding with its anti-apoptotic partners (such as Bad, Bax, and Bak) and, perhaps, other proteins (such as DHX9, LRRFIP2, PAWR, UACA, NS1, M1, NP, and HA).

Importantly, ABT-263 was more effective than structurally similar ABT-737 and ABT-199, whereas A-1155463 was more effective than structurally similar WEHI-539 and A-1331852. A-1155463, unlike ABT-263, causes reversible thrombocytopenia, which made it a suitable antiviral lead candidate [22, 23] .",

The binding of A-1155463, A-1331852, and WEHI-539 to their targets induces major conformational change (7 \u00c5 backbone movement) in the Bcl-xL that disrupts the local (R103-D107) helical structure of the protein. This structural change is not seen with ABT-263, ABT-737, and ABT-199 binding as these compounds contain chlorophenyl moiety compared to A-115463, A-1331852, and WEHU-539 benzothiazole moiety. Moreover, A-1155463 has additional moiety, which perturbs the Bcl-xL structure and may affect its binding with its anti-apoptotic partners (such as Bad, Bax, and Bak) and, perhaps, other proteins (such as DHX9, LRRFIP2, PAWR, UACA, NS1, M1, NP, and HA). It is possible that, not only the high affinity of A-1155463 to Bcl-xL protein, but also its capacity to alter protein-protein interactions could be important for its pro-apoptotic antiviral effect.",

While A-1155463 may possess broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro and against some other viruses in primary patient samples ex vivo [12] [13] [14] , its antiviral efficacy should be evaluated in vivo. Also its side effects, including its immuno-and neuro-modulatory properties, should be studied in detail. In particular, A-1155463 or its derivatives may possess adverse effects in acute virus infection. The viral dose is likely to be high, infecting a large number of cells. Inducing apoptosis may result in extensive tissue damage. Thus, A-1155463 or its derivatives must be evaluated as prophylactic rather than as therapeutic agents against viruses that cause acute infections.",
