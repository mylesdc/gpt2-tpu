The measures taken did not in all cases reach the intended objective or were more or less inefficient considering the effected expenditure [1, 6] . Therefore, it is necessary to examine mechanisms and relevance of such transmissions in relation to international public health. The results will enable us to deduce whether measures must be taken and which ones would be necessary to limit the spread of various, highly pathogenic and life-threatening infectious diseases [5, [10] [11] [12] [13] . If passengers infected with diseases that have the potential to become a public health emergency of international concern use public transportation (i.e., aircrafts), there is a potential threat to the destination area and -depending on the route of infection -for passengers travelling with the same aircraft [1, 3, 5, 10, 13] .",

A crucial point in this context is the disinfection of an aircraft that had a passenger on board who is suspected of being infected with one of the mentioned diseases. Although, basic advice on hygiene and sanitation on board an aircraft is given by the World Health Organization, these guidelines lack details on available and effective substances as well as standardized operating procedures (SOP). The purpose of this paper is to give guidance on the choice of substances that were tested by a laboratory of Lufthansa Technik and found compatible with aircraft components, as well as to describe procedures which ensure a safe and efficient disinfection of civil aircrafts. This guidance and the additional SOPs are made public and are available as mentioned in this paper.",

Erkrankungen, die durch hochpathogene Erreger (wie z. B. Ebola-/Lassa-Fieber-Viren, SARS-/MERS-CoV, pandemische Grippeviren) ausgel\u00f6st werden, haben das Potenzial, sich innerhalb weniger Tage auf mehreren Kontinenten zu verbreiten. In diesem Zusammenhang ist die z\u00fcgige und qualifizierte Desinfektion eines Verkehrsflugzeugs, das einen (m\u00f6glicherweise) infizierten Passagier an Bord hat, ein entscheidender Punkt. Trotz vorhandener grundlegender Richtlinien seitens der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) zur Hygiene an Bord von Flugzeugen fehlt es an detaillierten Hinweisen zu Des-infektionsstandards und zu verwendenden Produkten, die sowohl in der Wirksamkeit, aber auch im Sinne der Materialvertr\u00e4glichkeit f\u00fcr Flugzeugkomponenten unbedingt notwendig sind. Diese Abhandlung soll zeigen, wie mit einer Auswahl an Produkten, die f\u00fcr Flugzeugteile materialvertr\u00e4glich sind, mittels festgelegter Anwendungstechniken eine sichere und effiziente Desinfektion von zivilen Flugzeugen gew\u00e4hrleistet werden kann. Diese Standardverfahren werden der \u00d6ffentlichkeit im Sinne einer Leitlinie zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt.",
