Samples were collected pre-HSCT, at day 0, +10, +20 and +30 after HSCT. Peripheral blood (PB) was also analyzed to determine T and NK cell numbers. A total of 27 pediatric HSCT recipients were enrolled and 16 of them had at least one viral detection (60%). Rhinovirus was the most frequent pathogen (84% of positive NPAs). NPAs of patients contained fewer T and NK cells compared to healthy controls (p = 0.0132 and p = 0.120, respectively). Viral pcR + patients showed higher NK cell number in their NPAs. The activating receptors repertoire expressed by NK cells was also higher in NPA samples, especially NKp44 and NKp46.

Therefore, nasal immune cells are likely to play an important role in early innate immune responses to those environmental factors, both in healthy individuals and in immunocompromised patients like HSCT recipients. NK cells are thought to play a particularly important role in this context, since they are able to influence both innate and adaptive immune responses 32, 33 and are the first lymphocyte subset to appear in PB after HSCT [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . While macrophages and dendritic cells have been identified in the nasal submucosa 34 , and neutrophils have been identified in the nasal cavity 35 , the immune cells present in NPAs have not been fully characterized. To phenotype NPA cells, previous researchers have relied on cell differential analysis of cytocentrifuge slides stained with haematoxylin and eosin. However, flow cytometry may be a superior method to fully characterize NPA immune cells since it allows for a precise quantification of cell populations as well as for phenotype studies, making it possible to determine the activation status of such specific cell populations.",

To date, most studies of these infections in pediatric HSCT recipients have focused on symptomatic individuals, reporting an incidence of 5-11% [46] [47] [48] . Asymptomatic respiratory infections in children undergoing HSCT have been barely studied. A prospective study of 33 patients detected respiratory viruses in 24% of them before HSCT, mainly HRV and adenovirus 49 . In our series, infections caused by HRV were the most common, and were not associated with increased morbidity. These findings are in concordance with those reported by Srinivasan et al. in children with cancer or post-HSCT and upper or lower respiratory infection 13 and asymptomatic children before HSCT 49 . Other authors have reported implementing routine extensive pre-HSCT lung screening, including bronchoalveolar lavage for the detection of viruses, bacteria and fungi. In that study, almost one third of asymptomatic patients had viral respiratory infections, mainly caused by rhinovirus, and none of these worsened during HSCT 50 . On the other hand, infections caused by adenovirus and parainfluenza virus were less frequent but more often symptomatic in our patients. Adenovirus has been described as a cause of lower respiratory tract infection with high mortality after HSCT in studies involving symptomatic children 46, 51 . We did not find a correlation between viral infection and HSCT outcomes, which could be caused by small sample size and low incidence of symptomatic infection.",

Potential limitations of our study relate to sample size and losses to follow-up. NPA cell counts have great variability so larger cohorts would be desirable to draw stronger conclusions. Many patients did not tolerate well NPAs and withdrew during the course of the study. The small number of patients further precluded correlation of viral detection and transplantation outcomes, and limits our ability to examine the implications of asymptomatic viral respiratory infections in HSCT recipients. NPAs were collected up to 30 days after HSCT, and some infections occurring later may have been missed. However, most respiratory viral infections in HSCT recipients occur soon after transplantation, and adverse clinical outcomes are more likely to occur in the same period 46, 51 .",
