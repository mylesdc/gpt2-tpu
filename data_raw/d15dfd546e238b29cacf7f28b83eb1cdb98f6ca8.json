Human complement receptor 1 (CR1) plays a role in the clearance of complement opsonized molecules and may facilitate the entry of pathogens into host cells. Distinct CR1 exon 29 variants have been found associated with CR1 expression levels, increased susceptibility and pathophysiology of several diseases. In this study, CR1 plasma levels were assessed by ELISA and CR1 variants in exon 29 by sequencing in a Brazilian cohort of 232 chronic CD patients and 104 healthy controls. CR1 levels were significantly decreased in CD patients compared to controls (p < 0.0001). The CR1 rs1704660G, rs17047661G and rs6691117G variants were significantly associated with CD and in high linkage disequilibrium. The CR1*AGAGTG haplotype was associated with T. cruzi infection (p = 0.035, OR 3.99, CI 1.1-14.15) whereas CR1*AGGGTG was related to the risk of chagasic cardiomyopathy (p = 0.028, OR 12.15, CI 1.13-113). This is the first study that provides insights on the role of CR1 in development and clinical presentation of chronic CD.",

            "text": "In order to maintain its life cycle after transmission by triatomine vectors to a human host, T. cruzi needs to evade host immune attack and develops further intracellularly. The successful entrance of T. cruzi into host cells depends on the down-regulation of complement activation by parasite regulatory molecules and by its binding to complement receptors such as CR1 10, 11, 24 . Thus, complement system and CR1 have an important role both in the establishment of T. cruzi infection and sustenance of the chronic phase. In this study, the CR1 genetic variants in exon 29 were investigated in patients with chronic CD in order to assess their role in the modulation of CR1 levels as well as in the development and in the clinical progression of the disease. Patients with chronic CD had significantly decreased levels of CR1 compared to healthy controls. Plasma levels observed in the control group were in accordance with those reported in other studies 38, 40 . The reduced CR1 expression on erythrocytes combined with increased levels of immune complexes has been demonstrated in the pathogenesis of HIV, SARS-CoV, M. tuberculosis and M. leprae infections 33, 36, 37, 39 . In leprosy, AIDS, and tuberculosis, the reduction of CR1 levels is disease regulated, demonstrating that this condition is acquired rather than inherited 36,39 . Moreover, it is known that, similarly to mechanisms used by other pathogens, T. cruzi uses C1q to promote C1-dependent phagocytosis as well as MBL and ficolin-2 to promote opsonization via CR1 as a strategy to evade the host immune system and infect host cells 15 .",

            "text": "Interestingly, patients with cardiomyopathy had lower CR1 plasma levels than asymptomatic patients, which might indicate either consumption due to increased complement activation or lower production associated with this clinical manifestation. In fact, chagasic cardiomyopathy is known to be associated with inflammatory process and tissue damage, as observed in various inflammatory and infectious conditions [41] [42] [43] [44] . Moreover, one of the consequences of the persistent myocardial damage in CD is left ventricular dilation with systolic dysfunction 45 . For this reason, left ventricular systolic function was evaluated in CD patients using the Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF). Despite the important role of the complement system in cardiovascular diseases 46 such as atherosclerosis 48, 49 , myocardial infarction 50, 51 , and acute ischaemic stroke 52 , no correlation between CR1 levels and LVEF was found. This finding corroborates with data from a study on patients with acute myocardial infarction 53 . It is known that CR1 levels may be influenced by infections and that their expression is associated with genetic as well as acquired factors 39 . It was observed in this study that lower levels of CR1 were associated with rs6691117GG genotype in the controls, but not in patients. Two other studies found this genotype associated with lower erythrocyte sedimentation rate 54 and with preterm birth 55 . These findings indicate that rs6691117GG genotype may modulate CR1 expression. Since there was no association between the rs6691117GG and CR1 levels in the patients, the reduction of CR1 levels in chronic CD is probably due to the disease process. An anti-inflammatory role for CR1 was already observed in experimental studies where CR1 was able to prevent tissue injury induced by complement activation 56 . Considering that chronic CD is associated with inflammation, it is possible that the low levels of CR1 in CD patients may be related to its anti-inflammatory effect and consumption due to complement activation. However, the exact mechanism, which controls the expression of CR1 in CD patients is still unclear.",

Besides that, the low of CR1 levels observed in CD patients is possibly due to the disease process. This is the first study that provides insights on the role of CR1 in development and clinical presentation of chronic CD. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to confirm these findings. Statistical Analysis. CR1 plasma levels were compared between groups using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. The distribution of each variable was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Multiple logistic regression was executed with adjustment for age, sex, and ethnic group. Multiple comparisons were corrected using a Benjamini-Hochberg procedure applying a false discovery rate of 0.10 and raw p-values that remained significant after this correction were considered in the study. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the STATA software (v. 12.0, StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). Correlation analyses were performed by non-parametric Spearman's rank coefficient tests. Allele frequencies were obtained by direct counting. Genotype and haplotype frequencies were analyzed by gene counting and expectation-maximum (EM) algorithms and the significance of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the random-permutation procedure as implemented in the Arlequin v. 3.5.2.2 software (http://lgb.unige.ch/arlequin). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was performed using Haploview v. 3.2 (http://broadinstitute.org/haploview). Possible associations of CR1 alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes with different clinical forms were evaluated with two-tailed Fisher exact tests. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant.",

Colored boxes represent exons, which encode a specific protein domain. The CR1 protein is composed of 30 short consensus repeats (SCR). Among them, 28 repeats are arranged in four long homologous repeats (LHR-A: 1-7, LHR-B: 8-14, LHR-C: 15-21 and LHR-D: 22-28). The first three SCRs of LHR A, B and C are required for complement binding (C3b and C4b) and also for decayed accelerating activity (DAA) or cofactor activity (CA), while LHR-D binds C1q, ficolins and mannose binding lectin (MBL). The connecting lines indicate representative exons coding specific SCRs sequences, signal peptide (SP), transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic region (CR). Six CR1 genetic variants analyzed are located in exon 29* and positioned in SCRs 24 and 25. The amino acid substitutions are indicated by red arrows. Exons are drawn to scale and introns are truncated. SCIeNTIFIC RepoRts | (2018) 8:526 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-18937-z Methods Study Population. A total of 232 chronic CD patients attending at Ambulatory of Chagas Disease of Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas, Federal University of Paran\u00e1, were investigated [mean age 57 years; 130 (56%) females, 102 (44%) males, 176 (75.9%) Euro-, 44 (19%) Afro-Brazilian, 1 (0.4%) Asian, 11 (4.7%) Amerindian]. CD diagnosis was performed by two serological tests (ELISA and immunofluorescent antibody assay).

Following Brazilian health regulations, the blood donors were screened for CD, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV and human T-cell lymphotropic viruses 1 and 2 using high sensitivity assays. Additionally, information about autoimmune diseases and cancer background was obtained during the pre-selection interview67,68 . The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (CEP/HC-UFPR n. 360.918/2013-08), and performed in accordance with relevant guidelines/regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients and controls. patients with chronic CD and 102 healthy control individuals. DNA from 12 patients and from two controls was degraded; therefore these individuals were excluded from further genetic analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted from buffy-coats using the QIAamp Blood mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. The CR1 reference sequence was retrieved from the Ensembl database (www.ensembl.org); primers targeting exon 29 of CR1 gene were designed manually, tested using Primer-BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast) and synthesized commercially (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany). A fragment of 884 bp was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the CR1 locus specific primer pair CR1F (5\u2032-TCT TCA TAA ATA ATG CCA GAA GTG G-3\u2032) and CR1R (5\u2032-TGC CAA TTT CAT AGT CCT TAT ACA C-3\u2032). PCR amplifications were carried out in a 25 \u00b5l volume of reaction mixture containing 10 \u00d7 PCR buffer, 3.0 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 \u00b5M of each primer, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Qiagen) and 20 ng of genomic DNA on a TProfessional Basic Thermocycler (Biometra GmbH, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany). Cycling parameters were initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 seconds, annealing at 55.5 \u00b0C for 30 seconds and elongation at 72 \u00b0C for 1 minute, and a final elongation step at 72 \u00b0C for 10 minutes. PCR fragments were stained with SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and visualised in a 1.5% agarose gel. PCR products were purified using Exo-SAP-IT (USB-Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA) and the purified products were directly used as templates for sequencing using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (v.3.1; Applied Biosystems, Texas, USA) on an ABI 3130XL DNA Analyzer. DNA polymorphisms were identified by assembling the sequences with the reference sequence of the CR1 (NM_000573) using the Geneious v9.1.4 software (Biomatters Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) and reconfirmed visually from their respective electropherograms. of soluble CR1 plasma levels. Measurements of erythrocyte CR1 plasma levels were performed in 221 patients and 102 controls using a commercial high-sensitivity ELISA kit (Human Complement Receptor 1/SEB123Hu, Cloud-Clone Corporation, Texas, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
