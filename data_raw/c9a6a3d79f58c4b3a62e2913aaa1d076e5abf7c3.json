Preventive measures may fall out of fashion when the disease is absent for long periods, only to hit harder when it returns due to the lower level of immunity. A standard recommendation of health organizations in the face of an outbreak is the isolation of infected individuals [3] [4] [5] . This control strategy dates back centuries and its usefulness has not diminished with time, as evidenced in the recent outbreaks of SARS in Asia and Ebola in West Africa. Research has progressed in the meantime; mathematical models to understand the impact and effectiveness of isolation and quarantine protocols have been proposed and analyzed [6] [7] [8] [9] ; it has been shown that the effectiveness of isolation protocols can be increased by contact tracing and isolation of individuals prior to symptoms 10, 11 .",

Even then, the identification of infected hosts, a crucial first step in any isolation strategy, can be a formidable task. At early stages of an outbreak, the general population -even local health authorities -may fail to recognize the symptoms of an infectious disease (which are often ambiguous), or they may not be cognizant of the potential dangers of runaway exponential growth of infectious diseases 9 . For reasons of their own, such as distrust of authorities, infected individuals may choose not to seek medical attention. The cost of preparedness and surveillance, and the maintenance of adequate infrastructure and personnel that can be deployed at a moment's notice, can be prohibitively high 13 .",

            "text": "A case in point was the initial less-than-adequate emergency response in the devastating Ebola epidemics in West Africa. It was not until Oct 2014 that billions of dollars were allocated for training of personnel, construction and maintenance of holding centers and treatment units. Once the response capability improved, and delays in identifying infected individuals were shortened, the spreading of the disease was more effectively curtailed 12, 14 . Detrimental effects of delay were also reported during the SARS outbreak, which became more effectively controlled only when the time between onset of symptoms and isolation was shortened 12, 15 . Though recent studies have used linear analysis 6, 16 and simulations 17 to investigate the role of isolation, a general comprehensive theory of isolation as a means of epidemic control that focuses on consequences of imperfect implementation is lacking, as are studies of the nonlinear effects of isolation protocols. This paper addresses fundamental issues pertaining to imperfections in the implementation of isolation strategies as a means of disease control. First and foremost is the minimum response capability required to contain an outbreak. We determine the isolation probability, the critical fraction of the infected population that must be isolated, and the identification time, how quickly local authorities must act to prevent a full-blown outbreak. Our model predicts the nature of the endemic state that follows should the response be inadequate, and the extent to which a stronger response can ameliorate the severity of an outbreak. It offers crucial information to health authorities such as estimates on the fraction of the population that can be expected to fall ill, and answers theoretical questions such as the potential benefits of longer durations of isolation.",

These equations are amenable to mathematical analysis 20,21 , enabling us to understand rigorously many of the issues above.

In the absence of any control mechanism, the situation is as follows. Each host is in one of four discrete states: healthy and susceptible (S), incubating (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R). Infectious hosts infect their neighbors at rate \u03b2; infected nodes incubate the disease for a period of \u03c3 units of time during which they are assumed to be neither symptomatic nor infectious. At the end of the incubation period they become infectious. Infectious nodes remain in that state until they recover and gain immunity for a period that on average lasts 1/\u03b1 units of time at the end of which they rejoin the susceptible group.",

We use the terms isolation and quarantine interchangeably, and use the letter Q to better distinguish it from the infectious state I. A host in state Q does not infect others; it remains in this state for \u03ba units of time, at the end of which it is discharged and joins the recovered class. Figure 1 depicts the model states and main parameters: The five states of this model are S, E, I, Q and R, representing respectively the healthy and susceptible, incubating, infectious, isolated and recovered groups within the population. The numbers \u03c3, \u03c4, \u03ba > 0 and \u2208 p [0, 1] are the new parameters of the model, with \u03c3 being the incubation period, \u03c4 representing the length of time between a host's becoming infectious and entering isolation if it is identified, and \u03ba the isolation time.

It is strictly the capability to quickly identify a large enough fraction of the infectious and to isolate it from the general population.

For illustration, we consider r = 2.5 and 1/\u03b3 = 12 as in the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone (see Table 2 ). We also consider full identification probability p = 1.

What is different here is that we have assumed a constant response \u03b5, so that for small I(t), the situation is similar to that discussed in the paragraph on R(0) > 0 in the first part of Results. In particular, if S(t) is such that r(1 \u2212 \u03b5)S(t) < 1, the infection will temporarily abate, to flare up again when S(t) is large enough to bring this quantity above 1. Notice that the x-axis in Fig. 3(a) is in units t/(\u03c4 + \u03c3 + \u03ba), so that the timescales for the cycles of infection are significantly longer than any of these quantities. Rather it is indexed to \u03b1 and is affected by the fraction of individuals infected during the course of one cycle. A smaller group is infected in the second cycle than the first because a fraction of the population is immune at the time of the second outbreak.",

These quantities are of great relevance from the practical standpoint for health authorities involved in the planning of facilities and care for patients during isolation. To get our hands on these quantities, we consider first the limiting case where \u03b1 = \u03c3 = \u03b5 = 0. In this case, our model reduces to the classical SIR model, for which we obtain = \u2212 \u2212 \u204e I r r r 1 1 1 ln , peak so that \u204e I peak can never be larger than \u2212 1 r 1 , although a direct connection between \u204e I peak and I peak cannot be made. Figure 3 (c-e) describe how I peak and Q peak vary as we permit \u03b1, \u03c3 and \u03b5 to become positive. From Fig. 3(c) , we see that while \u03b1 has a strong effect on I eq and Q eq , its effect on I peak and Q peak are relatively small, because immunity loss occurs on a much longer timescale than the time it takes to reach I peak or Q peak . Figure 3 (d) shows that both I peak and Q peak are smaller for diseases with longer incubation periods. This presumably is due to the fact that a long incubation slows down the rate of infection, while recovery occurs at the same rate. Figure 3 (e) shows that I peak decreases as the response is stronger as expected. The dependence of Q peak on \u03b5 is more complicated: In the figure, \u03c4 is fixed and p is increased, i.e., a larger fraction of the infectious is isolated and Q peak increases with \u03b5 for this interval of \u03b5, but this trend will be reversed as \u03b5 continues to increase and I peak continues to drop.",

In this paper we called attention to the fact that a major reason may be \"too little, too late\", meaning the identification of infected hosts may not be sufficiently thorough and are too often subject to delays. We sought a mathematical model that could offer guidance on the response needed to contain an outbreak, as well as predict the consequences when one falls short. Our aim was to develop a general theory that is relevant rather than to carry out detailed studies of specific diseases. Such a model is necessarily a little idealized to be amenable to (rigorous) mathematical analysis. With these goals in mind we came up with the system of delay differential equations (1)-(5), the analysis of which produced the results reported here.",

The network heterogeneity can strongly influence the dynamics 24 and it can either be tackled by means of heterogeneous mean field approximation 25, 26 , or by a direct study of networks with adaptive change of the structure due to network rewiring caused by the isolation protocol 27 .
