The objective of this study was to describe the independent risk factors for hospital mortality and the treatment effect of corticosteroids among patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection. Methods: We retrospectively obtained clinical data of 155 adult patients with confirmed infection of 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in 23 hospitals in Beijing, China from October 1 to December 23, 2009. Risk factors for hospital mortality were identified with multivariate logistic regression analysis.",

Oseltamivir was initiated in 125 patients (80.6%), only 16 patients received antiviral therapy within 48 hours after symptom onset. Fifty-two patients (33.5%) were treated with systemic corticosteroids, with a median daily dose of 80 mg. Twenty-seven patients (17.4%) died during hospital stay. Diabetes [odds ratio (OR) 8.830, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.041 to 38.201, p = 0.004) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (OR 1.240, 95% CI 1.025 to 1.500, p = 0.027) were independent risk factors of hospital death, as were septic shock and altered mental status.

Diabetes and stress-induced hyperglycemia are known to be associated with an increased risk of complications and death among critically ill patients [21] .

In a cohort of 1479 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed pandemic (H1N1) influenza in Canada, Campbell reported that the risk of a severe outcome (including death and ICU admission) was greatest among patients with diabetes (relative risk 2.2, 95%CI 1.7 -2.7) [18] .

However, we did not observe any treatment effect of oseltamivir in our analysis. Only 16 out of 155 patients (10.3%) in our study received oseltamivir treatment within 48 hours after symptom onset. In comparison, Jain and Louie found that early antiviral therapy was administered in 39% and 51% of patients, respectively [7, 26] . Studies have shown that delayed antiviral treatment is associated with high risk of progression to severe disease such as ICU admission and respiratory failure, prolonged hospital stay, and even death [25, 27] . It is also possible that the delay in antiviral treatment in our patients resulted in higher hospital mortality (17.4%) compared with the subgroup of adult hospitalized patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in the United States [7, 26] .",

WHO strongly recommends that systemic corticosteroids should not be given, unless indicated for other reasons or as part of an approved research protocol [29] . In a retrospective study of 78 consecutive adult SARS patients, corticosteroids treatment was associated with a 20.7-fold increase in either ICU admission or mortality, independent of age and disease severity [30] . Liem et al also found that corticosteroids treatment was an independent risk factor of death in human H5N1 influenza A infection [31] . Observational studies demonstrated that corticosteroid use was associated with slower viral clearance, significantly increased odds of persistent viral replication 7 days after symptom onset [32] , and a longer duration of viral shedding with increased corticosteroid dose [33] . In patients with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection, Jain et al found that steroids were more commonly used in patients with severe outcome compared with those without severe outcome (52% vs. 31%, p < 0.05) [7] . Our data suggested that clinicians tend to use corticosteroids in more critically ill patients, such as patients with elevated LDH level or acute respiratory failure. However, even after adjusted for these confounding factors, results of logistic regression analysis still indicated a trend towards fatal outcome associated with corticosteroid use.",

Case capture was based on passive reporting by clinicians, and underreporting may have occurred because of poor recognition and the lack of specificity of clinical presentations. The retrospective nature of this study precluded the possibility of integrating body mass index into our regression analysis model, as height and weight data were not routinely documented in most cases. However, the effect of underlying medical conditions and morbid obesity may not be independent. For example, diabetes is reportedly up to seven times more prevalent in obese persons [34] , so that the diabetic cases were most likely among obese patients. The relatively large odds ratio for diabetes for hospital mortality in our study suggests an additional risk compared to obesity alone.",
