A common modification of sialic acids is 9-O-acetylation, which has been implicated in sialoglycan recognition, ganglioside biology, and the survival and drug resistance of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. Despite many functional implications, the molecular basis of 9-O-acetylation has remained elusive thus far. Following cellular approaches, including selective gene knockout by CRISPR/Cas genome editing, we here show that CASD1-a previously identified human candidate gene-is essential for sialic acid 9-O-acetylation. In vitro assays with the purified N-terminal luminal domain of CASD1 demonstrate transfer of acetyl groups from acetyl-coenzyme A to CMP-activated sialic acid and formation of a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate. Our study provides direct evidence that CASD1 is a sialate O-acetyltransferase and serves as key enzyme in the biosynthesis of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans.",

Sialoglycotopes are key determinants for numerous cell recognition events and play fundamental roles in development and host-pathogen interactions 1 . Of note, Sias show a pronounced structural diversity that arises from Nand O-substitutions of the parent compound neuraminic acid and this diversity is of critical importance for Sia recognition and subsequent cellular processes. For example, the prevalent human Sia 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) can be substituted by 9-O-acetylation, a modification that affects the binding of several Sia-specific lectins and has functional implications in particular in the immune system 2-6 . 9-O-Acetylation impairs host cell binding of influenza A and B viruses, but at the same time creates cellular receptors for influenza C and several nidoviruses [7] [8] [9] . Another prominent example for the impact of 9-O-acetylation is given by CD22, a B-cell-restricted member of the Sia-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin (siglec) family. On binding to a2,6sialylated N-glycans, CD22 regulates B-cell antigen receptor signalling by setting a threshold for receptor activation 10 . In vitro data showed that the CD22-ligand interaction is blocked by 9-Oacetylation 11 , a process that is in vivo tightly controlled by two counteracting enzymatic activities: sialate O-acetyltransferase (SOAT) and sialate 9-O-acetylesterase (SIAE). Ablation of SIAE function by targeted gene knockout in mice resulted in increased Sia 9-O-acetylation and defective CD22 signalling in B-cells and caused defects in peripheral B-cell development and tolerance 12 . Moreover, catalytically defective rare variants of SIAE were associated with autoimmune diseases in humans 13, 14 .",

In acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), survival and drug resistance of lymphoblasts critically depend on 9-O-acetylation, which was found on both GD3 and sialoglycoproteins 22, 23 . Enzymatic removal of 9-O-acetyl groups from internal and cell surface-bound Sias was lethal to ALL cells, opening new perspectives for therapeutic concepts 23 . The use of monoclonal antibodies recognizing the carbohydrate epitopes of non-O-acetylated GD3 (CD60a), 7-O-acetylated GD3 (CD60c) or 9-O-acetylated GD3 (CD60b) revealed a stimulatory or co-stimulatory effect of anti-CD60c and anti-CD60b antibodies on the proliferation of human lymphocytes and implicated distinct roles of 7-O-and 9-O-acetylated GD3 during activation and apoptosis of tonsillar B and T lymphocytes 24, 25 .",

However, the genes encoding eukaryotic SOATs have remained unknown. Despite many attempts, expression cloning was not successful [28] [29] [30] and isolation of SOAT activity proved difficult, mainly due to an inherent sensitivity to membrane solubilization [31] [32] [33] [34] . Searching for human candidate genes, Arming et al. 35 identified CASD1 (CAS1 domain containing 1), which shares sequence similarity to CAS1 (Capsule synthesis 1) of the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. Deletion of the fungal gene revealed an essential role in mannose O-acetylation of the unique fungal capsular polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan 36 . By contrast, little is known on the function of human CASD1. CASD1 overexpression as well as short interfering RNA knockdown assays performed in the initial study by Arming et al. indicated a role in 7-O-acetylation of GD3 (ref. 35) . However, studies addressing SOAT function of a given protein by transfection studies proved, so far, difficult due to endogenous SOAT activity in many common mammalian cell lines 29, 35, 37 , a problem that might have impeded also previous expression cloning approaches.",

However, the N-terminal domain of CASD1 differs from the canonical GDSL/SGNH fold by lacking the conserved residues G and N, and is therefore grouped into pfam family PF13839 (GDSL/SGNH-like acylesterase family found in Pmr5 and Cas1p) 39 .",

The orientation of the epitope tags was determined by selective membrane permeabilization and immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 1b,c) . Under conditions that allowed antibody access to all cellular compartments (0.2% Triton X-100), both tags were detectable and showed co-localization with the Golgi marker a-mannosidase II (a-Man II). Selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane with low concentrations of digitonin (5 mg ml \u00c0 1 ) allowed visualization of the N-terminal V5-tag, but not the C-terminal Myc-tag, demonstrating cytosolic and luminal orientation of N-and C-terminus, respectively. The integrity of the Golgi membrane was demonstrated by parallel staining with an antibody specific for the luminal domain of a-Man II 40 . Staining was observed exclusively in Triton X-100, but not in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Identical results were obtained on staining with an antibody against the SGNH-like domain of CASD1 (pAb 500), demonstrating that this domain faces the Golgi lumen (Fig. 1c) . On the basis of these results and on our predictions for the CASD1 transmembrane domains ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), we propose a topology model encompassing a luminal catalytic domain flanked by one N-terminal and 12 C-terminal transmembrane domains (Fig. 1a) .",

Affinity purified proteins were then used as an enzyme source for in vitro assays. First, we analysed whether sCASD1 possesses esterase activity, since the GDSL/SGNH fold is usually found among hydrolytic enzymes 38 , including the sialate 9-O-acetylesterase of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and the sialate 9-O-acetylesterase domains of the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins of influenza C and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) [41] [42] [43] . However, under conditions that displayed high O-acetyltransferase activity for BCoV-HE, no activity was observed for sCASD1-wt, neither towards the synthetic acetylesterase substrate para-nitrophenylacetate (pNP-acetate; Fig. 2d ) nor towards natural O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates (not shown). Thus, while the N-terminal luminal domain of CASD1 displays the characteristic fold of an esterase 39 , it does not appear to function as such. We therefore tested whether sCASD1 might catalyse the reverse reaction and act as a SOAT. Indeed, in the presence of [ 3 H]acetyl-CoA, sCASD1-wt showed acetyltransferase activity, resulting in the formation of radiolabelled protein, even in the absence of acceptor substrates (Fig. 2e) . No radioactive incorporation was seen in parallel experiments with the mutant sCASD1-S94A, demonstrating that the observed acetyl transfer was enzyme catalysed. SOAT activity of sCASD1 towards its own N-glycans was improbable. Although sCASD1 is N-glycosylated (Fig. 2c) , glycoproteins that are produced in Sf9 cells typically bear pauci mannosidic N-glycans lacking penultimate galactose and terminal Sia residues 44 . Consequently, we asked whether sCASD1 can catalyse the formation of a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate that could be trapped in the absence of acceptor substrate. Therefore, purified sCASD1 was incubated in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA, digested with trypsin and analysed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS). After incubation of sCASD1-wt with acetyl-CoA, the peptide containing the active site residue S94 (87-HIAFIGDSR-95) occurred as a mixed population of unmodified and modified peptide with a mass shift of 42 Da (shift by m/z \u00bc 21 for the doubly charged ion), consistent with the formation of an acetyl adduct ( Fig. 2f ; note that the sequence of the peptides was confirmed by tandem MS/MS; see Supplementary Fig. 2) . Analysis of the peak areas in the extracted ion chromatograms revealed that about 19% of the peptide population was acetylated ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). In parallel experiments with sCASD1-S94A, only the respective unmodified peptide (87-HIAFIGDAR-95) was found ( Fig. 2f ; To test SOAT activity, purified sCASD1 was incubated with acetyl-CoA and Sia-containing acceptor substrates. After the reaction, Sia was released by acidic hydrolysis to allow derivatization with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxy-benzene (DMB) at the free reducing end. The obtained fluorescent Sia derivatives were analysed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Fig. 3a -e). SOAT activity was clearly detected towards CMP-Neu5Ac (as indicated by an additional peak in the HPLC profile, which eluted at the same retention time as DMBderivatized 9-O-acetylated Neu5Ac (Neu5,9Ac 2 ) of the reference panel; see Fig. 3a ,c). The additional peak was not detected in samples obtained from parallel reactions without enzyme (Fig. 3b ) or from reactions with sCASD1-S94A (Fig. 3d) .",

To do so, we made use of a set of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that distinguish between GD3 (CD60a) and 9-O-acetylated GD3 (CD60b). HAP1 cells lack GD3 but can generate the disialo ganglioside after expression of the sialyltransferase ST8Sia I (Fig. 6a; mAb R24 ). ST8Sia I converts GM3 to GD3 by adding an a2,8-linked Sia residue, which in turn can carry an O-acetyl group in C9 position (Fig. 6c) 49 . In HAP1 wild-type cells, expression of ST8Sia I resulted in the formation of both CD60a and CD60b antigens, as shown by additional staining with mAb UM4D4 (Fig. 6a) . As described for other anti-CD60b antibodies, UM4D4 recognizes 9-O-acetylated GD3 and similar gangliosides possessing a terminal 9-O-acetylated disialo group such as 9-Oacetylated disialo neolactotetraosylceramide and 9-O-acetylated disialo neolactohexaosylceramide (see Supplementary Fig. 8c for details on ganglioside structures) 50 . However, binding of mAb UM4D4 strictly relies on the O-acetylation of the carbohydrate epitope and no cross-reactivity towards the unmodified epitope is seen (see refs 50,51 and Supplementary Fig. 8b ). Newly synthesized CD60a and CD60b epitopes were both detected at the cell surface, as demonstrated by respective signals on nonpermeabilized cells. In HAP1 DCASD1 cells, expression of ST8Sia I alone led to the formation of GD3 ( Fig. 6b ; mAb R24) but not 9-O-Ac-GD3 or other 9-O-acetylated gangliosides of the neolacto series ( Fig. 6b; mAb UM4D4) . Ganglioside modification was only detected after co-expression of ST8Sia I with CASD1, demonstrating that CASD1 is crucial for the formation of 9-Oacetylated CD60b epitopes ( Fig. 6b; middle images) . Again, alanine exchange of the active site residue S94 drastically impaired CASD1 function ( Fig. 6b; right images) . The critical role of CASD1 for the formation of 9-O-acetylated CD60b epitopes was further confirmed in HEK293T wt and HEK293T DCASD1 cells by immunofluorescence and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, whereas no indication for the presence of 7-O-acetylated disialo gangliosides was found ( Supplementary Fig. 8a,b) .",

This phenomenon, described only by one previous study 37 , highlights that 9-O-acetylation is much more common than anticipated from cell surface staining. The finding that Golgi-confined 9-Oacetylated Sias were attached to N-and O-glycans suggests Golgiresident glycoproteins as underlying carriers and interestingly, 9-O-acetylated Sia was recently found on the N-glycans of a human sialyltransferase 52 .",

In this scenario, the sialyltransferases would play a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycoconjugates that carry 9-Oacetylated Sia. In support of this, CMP-Neu5,9Ac 2 was detected in bovine submandibular glands 54 and biochemical data obtained with human colon mucosa showed a Golgi-associated SOAT activity that utilized CMP-Neu5Ac as acceptor and a sialyltransferase activity that transferred 9-O-acetylated Sia from CMP-Neu5,9Ac 2 to endogenous and exogenous acceptors 33, 55 . Moreover, the use of CMP-Neu5,9Ac 2 has been shown for several sialyltransferases and is exploited for chemo-enzymatic synthesis of 9-O-acetylated sialosides 56 . In vivo, the efficient and selective usage of CMP-Neu5,9Ac 2 may rely on a physical interaction between CASD1 and specific sialyltransferases.",

Moreover, 7-O-Ac-specific SOAT activity has been detected in several tissues 31, 59, 60 and studies on microsomal fractions from bovine submandibular glands provided evidence for an enzyme that accelerates the migration of O-acetyl groups from C7 to C9 in vivo 59 . In line with previous studies on 7-O-Ac-specific SOAT activity, Arming et al. 35 observed a role of CASD1 in 7-O-acetylation but not in 9-Oacetylation of GD3 as shown by FACS analysis with anti-CD60c and anti-CD60b mAbs 35 .

(b) Soluble CASD1 variants encompassing the wild-type sequence or the amino-acid exchange S94A were expressed in insect cells and affinity purified from the culture supernatant via the C-terminal hexahistidine tag. Purified proteins were analysed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining (upper panel) or western blotting using an anti-Myc mAb (lower panel). (c) Analysis of the N-glycosylation pattern of sCASD1.

Partial removal of N-glycans by PNGaseF resulted in five bands with reduced molecular mass, indicating the presence of five N-glycans.

(e) Formation of a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate monitored by radioactive incorporation. Purified sCASD1-wt and sCASD1-S94A were incubated with [ 3 H]acetyl-CoA and the radioactivity incorporated into protein was measured by scintillation counting.

Immunofluorescence analysis with BCoV-HE 0 -Fc revealed that several mammalian cell lines express 9-O-acetylated sialoglycotopes exclusively in the Golgi apparatus (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the underlying carrier structures were N-and O-glycans, since blocking O-glycosylation sufficiently abrogated 9-O-acetylation only in cells that additionally lacked complex and hybrid N-glycans (Supplementary Fig. 5).",
