The closest distances (in \u00c5) between the C\u03b1 atoms of these residues and the oxygen atoms of ADPr phosphates are indicated by black dashed lines.

(d) Thermal stability of TARG1 and mutants in the presence of ADPr. 2 \u00b5M His-TARG1, His-TARG1-G43E, -I44E or -G123E were incubated with increasing amounts of ADPr (0.25 mM -2.5 mM) and the fluorescent dye SYPRO orange. SYPRO orange fluorescence intensity was measured in a qPCR light cycler with a temperature gradient from 25\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C with temperature increments of 1\u00b0C/min. Melting temperatures were determined according to 2 and are presented as \u0394T M (mean + SD of 3 experiments) to His-TARG1 H 2 O control (ctrl).",

Figure S2 : CRISPR-Cas9 OARD1 knock-out strategy (a) Schematic representation of the OARD1 locus on the reverse strand of chromosome 6 and knock-out strategy. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding for the Cas9 nickase (Cas9-D10A) and gRNAs targeting Cas9-D10A to the forward and the reverse strand in intron 2 and intron 5 each of the OARD1 gene (blue triangles) resulting in deletion of exons [3] [4] [5] . Genotyping of single cell clones was performed by genomic PCR. The wildtype allele was detected using the primer pair amplifying exon 4 (Ex4, red) while upon deletion of the gDNA-flanked fragment a PCR product of \u223c1,000 bp can be amplified using the primer pair Ex2-fwd/Int5-rev (KO, green). (b) Exemplary agarose gel of genotyping PCR using genomic DNA samples from 7 different HeLa cell clones as a template and the primer pairs described in (A) for amplification of the wildtype (Ex4) and the knock-out (KO) allele. A complete knock-out was observed for clone 3.
