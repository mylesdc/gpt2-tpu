During 11 weeks of the influenza epidemic period in January-March 2012, consecutive adult patients suspected to be septic (n = 432) were analyzed with cultures from blood and nasopharynx plus multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses on the nasopharyngeal specimen. The results were compared with those from microbiology analyses ordered as part of standard care. During the winter season, viral respiratory pathogens, mainly influenza A virus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were clinically underdiagnosed in 70% of patients positive by the multiplex PCR assay. During the first four weeks of the influenza epidemic, few tests for influenza were ordered by clinicians, indicating low awareness that the epidemic had started. Nasopharyngeal findings of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae by culture correlated to pneumonia diagnosis, and in those patients laboratory signs of viral coinfections were common but rarely suspected by clinicians. The role of respiratory viral infections in patients presenting with a clinical picture of sepsis is underestimated. Specific antiviral treatment might be beneficial in some cases and may reduce spread in a hospital setting. Diagnosing viral infections may promote reduction of unnecessary antibiotic use. It can also be a tool for decisions concerning patient logistics, in order to minimize exposure of susceptible patients and personnel.",

In adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), a bacterial etiology can be established in about 25-50% of cases depending on definitions and methods used [1, 2] . S. pneumoniae is the most often found bacteria, followed by H. influenzae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. More rarely found agents are Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetti [1, 3] . Several respiratory viruses may also cause severe respiratory disease, including CAP, mainly in children, but also in adults. This is well known for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses types 1-3, adenovirus, enteroviruses, rhinovirus, and human bocavirus [3] [4] [5] . Indeed, viral infections are estimated to cause around 100 million annual cases of CAP worldwide [6] . Many of these viruses have seasonal variation patterns, causing epidemics, often with peaks during winter and early spring [7] .

For example, influenza A virus can enhance the pathogenicity of S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus or H. influenzae. On the other hand it can inhibit the pathogenicity of others, such as M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae [8] [9] [10] [11] . Using molecular techniques it has become evident that viral infection is present in around 25% of CAP, regardless of severity [1, 12, 13] . Viral co-infections in CAP has been shown to increase both disease severity and length of stay in hospital [14] . In patients with pneumonia requiring intensive care, mixed viral-bacterial infections have demonstrated the highest mortality rate in at least one study [13] .",

Currently, sepsis is defined as a Blife-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection^and said to be present if a patient has an infection and +2 points or more in the SOFA-score [22] . From a clinical viewpoint, a patient is suspected to be septic if there has been a sudden onset of chills and fever accompanied by abnormalities in vital signs, such as an increased respiratory rate, lowered oxygen saturation, tachycardia, hypotension, altered mentation, general malaise, and if laboratory findings such as an increase in leucocytes, C-reactive protein, lactate or procalcitonin support that suspicion. If so, broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment is started on clinical suspicion of bacterial sepsis and according to the preliminary diagnosis. Treatment is later modified according to the results of cultures, other microbiological detection methods, infection biomarkers, and imaging. In most cases, the origin and etiology of the infection cannot be established in the emergency department. Clinical symptoms and signs are helpful but not fully reliable. The inflammatory response in sepsis may itself cause symptoms and signs that can be misleading [23] . For example, a bacteremic urinary tract infection may present with predominating respiratory symptoms and signs [24] . This warrants broad testing early during care.",

However, in a Swedish study by Str\u00e5lin et al. in 2006 [30] , there was a good correlation between nasopharyngeal findings of these bacteria and the etiology of pneumonia, as has been seen in previous Swedish studies. In our study of patients in the emergency department suspected to be septic, there was a strong correlation between nasopharyngeal findings of S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae and X-ray findings of a new infiltrate, indicative of pneumonia. More so, these bacteria were not found in the nasopharynx of any of the 210 patients with a non-respiratory infection or no infection, and they were rarely found in patients with a respiratory tract infection but not pneumonia. The study results imply that nasopharyngeal findings of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae in sepsis patients should be considered carefully for patient treatment. A recently published paper by Bjarnason et al. in 2017 [31] demonstrates a good correlation between real-time PCR findings of S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae to pneumonia diagnosis in adults, which also builds support for a clinical relevance of these upper respiratory bacterial findings. Co-infections of bacteria and respiratory viruses, mainly S. pneumoniae and influenza A or respiratory syncytial virus, are found in 3-40% of patients with CAP, depending on diagnostic methods used, with the higher end reflecting studies in which nasopharyngeal culture is included for etiological diagnosis [1, 2] . Using nasopharyngeal sampling only, we found indications of viral-bacterial co-infections in 28 of 137 (20%), a proportion we believe to be an underestimation. As in the study by Falsey et al. in 2013 [28] , S. pneumoniae was the bacteria most often associated with pneumonia and a viral co-infection. As many as 75% of patients with pneumonia and S. pneumoniae in the nasopharynx were positive for a respiratory virus, mainly influenza A virus, but also human metapneumovirus. The two youngest patients, with pneumonia and severe sepsis, aged 37 and 42 years respectively, were both positive for S. pneumoniae and human metapneumovirus in the nasopharynx.

            "text": "In the clinical setting it is often difficult to determine whether a patient with respiratory symptoms has a viral infection, a bacterial infection, or a mixed viral-bacterial infection. No constellation of clinical symptoms, vital signs, biomarkers (such as white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, or procalcitonin) have adequate sensitivity and specificity. New tools to improve predictions of patient benefit from antibiotic treatment are urgently needed. Recently, whole blood analysis for the identification of host gene activation profiles has been able to discriminate viral infections from bacterial infections with high accuracy in severely ill infants, as described by Herberg et al. in 2016 [32] . In adults with lower respiratory tract infections, a similar technique seems able to discriminate viral from bacterial infections much better than procalcitonin, as shown by Suarez et al. in 2015 [33] . In the same study mixed viral-bacterial infections also elicited a characteristic gene activation profile.",

With current technology, results can be obtained within a few hours and have an impact on clinical decisions and patient logistics in the emergency department. Cost effectiveness should be investigated. A viral diagnosis may not only lead to fewer admissions and less antibiotic treatment if bacterial pneumonia is suspected or demonstrated, but may also decrease viral exposures for admitted patients. Patients with influenza A or B may benefit from antiviral treatment alone or in conjunction with antibacterial treatment, if bacterial pneumonia is suspected or demonstrated, perhaps even reducing viral contagiousness. Even in neutropenic patients, a viral finding and a favorable outcome in the first few days may safely allow for discontinuation of antibiotic treatment [34] .",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. It is a single-center study performed during one winter period only. The study was primarily not an etiological study of respiratory tract infections. We did not take ongoing antibiotic treatment into account. Only routine sampling from the nasopharynx was performed, albeit using a flocked swab for better yield. If sputum or nasopharyngeal aspirates had been analyzed with molecular techniques, we would have expected a higher yield for both bacteria and viruses [2, 30] . A further weakness is the open inclusion based on clinical suspicion of sepsis only, without specific criteria. Yet another was the subjectivity involved in deciding the relevance of the findings. What role do the viral findings play, both alone or in conjunction with bacterial findings? We can only show correlations between findings and clinical entities, yet the majority of findings do seem to correlate well to respiratory tract infections. Therefore, we believe that our conclusion, that significant viral disease in severely ill patients is underdiagnosed by clinicians, is warranted. Diagnosing these infections early may be of help for the clinical decision making process and thereby for the patients.",

In clinical use for all patients during the study period was a lab-developed PCR for influenza A and B virus and respiratory syncytial virus (triple test) as well as a lab-developed PCR for M. pneumoniae detection. RSV respiratory syncytial virus, NP nasopharynx no alternative diagnosis accounting for the new infiltrate was made during the stay in hospital. A diagnosis of respiratory tract infection was made if there were symptoms or signs consistent with acute respiratory infection but no X-ray findings compatible with pneumonia or if no imaging was performed and if there was no other explanation for the symptoms during the stay in hospital.ResultsA total of 5,016 patients were admitted to the hospital during the study period. The average age was 71 years and 50.1% were men. Out of those admitted, 839 (16.7%) received intravenous antibiotic treatment within 48 h and were included in the larger epidemiological sepsis study. The average age was 69 years and 54.5% were men. From 438 out of 839 (52.2%) patients a nasopharyngeal swab was collected and 432 could be evaluated by both culture and multiplex PCR for bacteria or respiratory viruses.Nasopharyngeal findings by real-time multiplex PCRMultiplex PCR testing detected 166 viruses in 158 of 432 patients (37%) (Table 1) of whom 60% were men, with an average age of 70 years, and 40% were women, average age 73 years. No influenza B virus was found in study samples. Two samples positive for influenza A virus by routine testing could not be confirmed by multiplex PCR.",
