            "text": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in the homeostatic control of cardiovascular, renal and adrenal functions. This peptide-based hormonal system is comprised of two main pathways; angiotensin converting enzyme/angiotensin II/angiotensin type 1/2 receptor (ACE/Ang II/AT1/2R; which is the classical RAAS), and ACE2/Ang 1-7/ MAS-1 receptor (MAS1-R) (a recently described version of RAAS) [1, 2] . The proteolytic enzyme renin is released by the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys to cleave the N-terminal region of angiotensinogen to form Ang I (or decapeptide). Ang I is further degraded to Ang II by the removal of two C-terminal amino acids by proteases such as ACE and chymas-1. Ang II binds to two main receptors; AT1R and AT2R. Whereas AT1R plays an important role in blood pressure control and cardiac cell remodeling, AT2R antagonizes the signaling associated with AT1R stimulation [1] . Furthermore, Ang II can be converted to smaller peptide products with various biological activities. One of these, Ang 1-7, can be synthesized not only from Ang II (via postproline carboxypeptidase) but also from Ang I (via tissue endopeptidases; neprilysin, prolyl endopeptidase, and thimet oligopeptidase), or directly from Ang 1-9 following its formation from Ang 1-10 by ACE2, bypassing the synthesis of Ang II [3] . Ang 1-7 induces its biological effects through the only known receptor for this peptide; the MAS-1 R oncogene Gprotein coupled receptor [4] . The physiological roles of Ang 1-7 on renal function, fluid homeostasis, vascular tone and cardiac contractility and remodeling are well documented, and most of these actions are directly opposed to Ang II-mediated effects [5] [6] [7] [8] . It is thought that the beneficial effects of ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) on blood pressure control and in delaying/inhibiting the cardiac remodeling process is through increasing serum levels of Ang1-7 [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "Several studies have suggested an important role for Ang II in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract which comprises two conditions: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [13, 14] . When the production and/or the activity of Ang II is reduced, colitis severity is ameliorated in various animal models of IBD through various mechanisms. Treatment with ACEIs or ARBs resulted in significant reduction in colitis severity in 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced models of experimental colitis [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, colitis severity can also be ameliorated by making mice homozygous for targeted disruption of the angiotensin gene [21] or ATR1a deficiency [22] . These protective effects are considered to be due in part to inhibition of Ang II mediated enhancement of NF\u03baB phosphorylation, adhesion molecule expression in the gut (the mucosal addressin; MAdCAM-1) and serum pro-inflammatory cytokine release (TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2). Furthermore, ACEI or ARB treatment in mice results in reduced colonic epithelial cell apoptosis and enhanced expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Interestingly, ACE gene polymorphism was detected in IBD patients and is associated with reduced ACE serum levels; this might be associated with the disease pathogenesis and its extraintestinal side effects [23] [24] [25] . It is thought that chronic treatment with RAAS blockers (ACEI or ARBs) may lead to increased Ang 1-7, which could then oppose the harmful effects of Ang II in the cardiac and renal system, and possibly in the gut as well.",

Ang 1-7 has been found to reduce the severity of allergic inflammation in mice by suppressing the activity of ERK1/2 and NF\u03baB pathways [32] . Of particular interest, ACE2 (the main enzyme responsible for Ang 1-7 generation) expression has been observed in epithelial and sub-mucosal cells throughout the gut, with significant expression in the ileum and the colon [33] [34] [35] .",

Daily administration of Ang 1-7 at doses of 0.01-0.06 mg/kg significantly reduced most of these effects. The presence of erythema was reduced by 40-60%, incidence of diarrhea by 30-60%, ano-rectal bleeding by 6-50%, blood in stool by 30%, and edema by 20-30% relative to DSS/saline i.p group. Ang 1-7 at 0.1 mg/kg dose reduced ano-rectal bleeding, blood in stool and erythema by 15-40% but at the groups indicated. Panel G represent plasma levels (ng/ml) of Ang 1-7 in mice treated with DSS (for 7 days) plus either daily i.p saline or Ang 1-7 (0.06 mg/kg). Histobars represent means \u00b1 SEM for 4-18 mice in each group (8 for UT, 18 for DSS/i.p saline, 6 for Ang 0.01 mg/kg, 5 for Ang 0.06 mg/kg, 9 for Ang 0.1 mg/kg, 4 for Ang 0.3 mg/kg and 9 for Ang 1.0 mg/kg).

Histobars represent means \u00b1 SEM for 5-18 mice 0.3-1.0 mg/kg, this protective effect was lost. The histological score of colitis correlated well with the macroscopic score (as shown in Fig 3E) ; a significant reduction in colitis severity was seen with Ang1-7 treatment only at the lower doses of 0.01-0.06 mg/kg. Similarly, the % of ulceration (Fig 3F) was significantly reduced (40-55%) but again only with the lower dose of 0.01-0.06 mg/kg Ang 1-7. Furthermore, daily i.p injections of Ang 1-7 at 0.06 mg/kg dose significantly increased the plasma levels of Ang 1-7 compared to mice receiving daily i.p saline at day 7 post-colitis induction (Fig 3G) . The histological features of the resected tissues are illustrated in Fig 4. Compared to the normal architecture in untreated (UT) controls, DSS/i.p saline treatment for 7 days resulted in significant mucosal destruction and infiltration by immune cells (Fig 4B) . Injection of DSS treated animals with 0.01-0.06 mg/kg doses of Ang 1-7 improved mucosal integrity and reduced the degree of immune cell recruitment to the colon (Fig 4C and 4D ). This anti-inflammatory effect was lost with higher Ang 1-7 doses (Fig 4E, 4F and 4G).",

            "text": "In this study, we have presented data indicating a novel role of Ang 1-7 in reducing colitis severity in the murine DSS model. Daily i.p injections (at doses of 0.01-0.06 mg/kg) ameliorated colitis severity when given either prophylactically or after colitis induction. Blockade of the MAS-1 R (by A779) aggravated colitis severity, highlighting the involvement of the Ang 1-7/MAS-1 R axis in the pathogenesis of IBD. This protective effect was in part modulated through the expression/activity of several signaling molecules such as Ang II, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and Akt. It has been demonstrated that ACE2 is expressed in the epithelial, sub-mucosal and muscular layers of the colon in both humans and mice [33] [34] [35] , and its expression levels are increased in the plasma of IBD patients [39] . We observed increased expression of ACE2 and MAS-1 R proteins in the colonic tissues of mice after DSS challenge (Fig 2) , and higher Ang 1-7 levels in the inflamed colon homogenates (Fig 1B) . Plasma levels of Ang 1-7 were significantly reduced at 7 days post DSS treatment (0.002 \u00b1 0.006 ng/ml) when compared to healthy controls (UT; 0.232 \u00b1 0.134 ng/ml). Partial restoration was achieved with daily i.p injections of Ang 1-7 at 0.06 mg/kg dose (0.061 \u00b1 0.009 ng/ml; Fig 3G) . The enhanced expression of the ACE2/Ang 1-7/MAS-1 R axis post DSS challenge might reflect a compensatory protective mechanism to reduce the effect of the inflammatory response. Daily Ang 1-7 administration significantly reduced colitis severity observable at both gross (Table 1 ) and histological levels (Fig 3E and 3F ). In addition, it also opposed the DSS-induced drop in body weight (Fig 3A) , and restored the changes in colon length and thickness post colitis induction (Fig 3C and 3D) . The protective effect of Ang 1-7 was lost with higher doses in vivo (Fig 3) . One explanation is that higher concentrations of Ang-1-7 attenuate the MAS-1 R responsiveness through receptor desensitization [40] [41] [42] . Another report also showed that Ang 1-7 treated HEK 293T cells at high concentrations redistributed the MAS-1 R to intracellular vesicles and co-localized Ang 1-7 with Rab5 and the adaptor protein complex 2, suggesting regulation by a clathrin-mediated pathway [43] . Enhanced activity of members of the MAPK family, p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 as well as Akt (the downstream target of PI3K), which we observed in colonic sections post DSS treatment (Figs 8-10 ) has previously been reported in colonic biopsies from IBD patients [44] [45] [46] [47] . Treatment with inhibitors of these signaling molecules ameliorated colitis severity in mice and reduced the disease activity index in patients, underlining their role in IBD pathogenesis [44] [45] [46] [47] . In this study, we showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of Ang 1-7 treatment were associated with a reduction in the phosphorylated forms of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and Akt post DSS induction (Figs 8-10) , consistent with previous reports showing reduced activity of these molecules post Ang 1-7 treatment in the anterior pituitary [31] , proximal tubular cells [29] , and lung tissues in an animal model of lung inflammation [32] . Using immunofluorescence analysis, we observed enhanced colonic expression of Ang II at day 7 post-DSS treatment (Fig  11) , confirming western blotting data presented in Fig 2A. Ang II expression was reduced by daily Ang 1-7 treatment (at doses of 0.01-0.1 mg/kg, Fig 11C-11E ). This suggest that the antiinflammatory properties of Ang 1-7 are in part mediated through reduction of Ang II levels.",

Other studies (in the murine TNBS model) have demonstrated that ACE2 deficiency results in increased likelihood of developing intestinal inflammation due to the disruption of dietary amino acid homeostasis, innate immunity and gut microbial ecology [50] , as well as increased leukocyte recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in the colonic tissues. These data are consistent with a protective role of the ACE2/Ang1-7/MAS-1 R axis observed in this study.",

Blockade of the MAS-1 R inhibited the protective effects of endogenous Ang 1-7 and increased the severity of colitis.",
