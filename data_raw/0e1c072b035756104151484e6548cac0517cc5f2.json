Automatic thesaurus construction based on patterns was first suggested by Hearst [1], but it is still not clear how to automatically construct such patterns for different semantic relations and domains. In particular it is not certain which patterns are useful for capturing synonymy. The assumption of extant resources such as parsers is also a limiting factor for many languages, so it is desirable to find patterns that do not use syntactical analysis. Finally to give a more consistent and applicable result it is desirable to use these patterns to form synonym sets in a sound way.",

Thesauri which list synonymous terms have been found to be useful for improving the results of information retrieval systems [2] and synonymy relations are encoded in many ontologies, for example Gene Ontology [3] , and biological databases such as SWISS-PROT [4] . General thesauri, such as WordNet, give relatively poor coverage of specialised domains and thesauri often do not exist for many languages and domains. Domain specific thesauri and ontologies are expensive to construct, due to the scarcity of human expert resources, and often do not give sufficient variants of terminology. Against this background, automatic discovery of synonymy relations between terms has been shown to be useful for both maintaining and expanding existing ontologies [5] and for constructing ontologies [6] , however the accuracy of such methods remains a major issue.",

Distributional similarity, that is identifying terms by other terms which occur in close proximity, has also been shown to be effective for identifying synonymy, most notably the Latent Semantic Analysis method of Cederberg & Widdows [8] . As shown in Dumais et al [9] , this can be used to improve the recall of a synonym classifier although at the cost of its precision. This method however lacks the ability to differentiate between specific semantic relations (for example synonymy, hypernymy, agent/disease).",

Their pattern extractor was based on using a dependency grammar and so requires a grammar and a parser, which will limit applicability to those few languages where large coverage parsers have been developed. They then generated a large number of patterns and classified them by a logistic regression-based method. Finally they attempted to improve their results by using distributional similarity [11] . They also used a number of handchosen synonymy patterns to detect potential synonyms and used this to improve their detection rate. An attempt to find gene and protein name synonyms was explored in Yu et al [12] , again they manually chose their patterns.",

            "text": "One of the disadvantages of most of these approaches is that they give only binary classification rather than outputting synonym sets. For practical applications of this problem a simple list of synonymous terms is much more desirable for several reasons, firstly the results are much simpler and easier to store and work with, as you need only list the groups instead of the synonymy relation between each pair. Also the result is self-consistent, so we will not get a result that X is synonymous to Y, which is synonymous to Z, but not that X is synonymous to Z. This may cause problems in applications where only a single term is use to represent the synset, for example a method based on usage of an ontology may require one main term for the synset. An attempt at improving the result of a term similarity classifier by graph clustering was explored in Ibekwe-Sanjuan & Sanjuan [13] , however their method was not based on probabilities and the clustering method suggested would lead to questionable behaviours such as grouping a synset when the vast majority of links are not indicative of synonymy, hence the classifier must have a very high precision. Our work is most closely related to the work in Snow et al [10] for automatically discovering hypernyms. In order to find these patterns we chose to develop a system based on Soderland's WHISK system [14] as it is uses regular expression matching and so requires no prior knowledge of the syntax of the language. There they started with a base pattern consisting only of \"*\"s and slots and grew the pattern by replacing each of these \"*\"s with a word from their corpus. They then attempt to find a set of patterns which maximises the overall performance. We also wish to investigate this method in specific domains, and see if it is still feasible with a smaller seed set as the seed set in Snow et al [10] was the entirety of WordNet. For our experiment we chose to focus on the disease control domain, but our method could easily be applied to many domains in bio-medicine or other areas. We used the number of matches of each pattern for each term pair, to create a feature vector which could be used to statistically classify each term pair as synonymous or not. Finally we used probabilistic analysis to find the most likely set of synsets, based on modelling the output of the classifier as a probability graph.",

BioCaster was developed for the search and analysis of Internet news and research literature to enable the timely detection of possible disease outbreaks. As such it contains a range of lay terms and technical terms, and we choose 4 categories of terminology from the ontology: infectious diseases, symptoms (of infectious diseases), agents (e.g. viruses, bacteria) and hosts (e.g. mammals, birds).

To expand a pattern we search the corpus by taking each synonym pair and replacing the #s with the terms. By considering each possible single expansion of a * or (space) our problem can be viewed as a tree search. Obviously this search space is huge and so we search it heuristically by best-first search.

This algorithm uses a sparse matrix formation to efficiently remove infeasible row choices, and combined with a branch and bound algorithm can very effectively find optimal solutions. The branch and bound simply discards any partial solution when the most it costs is guaranteed to be less than the best solution found so far. This maximum cost can be found by simply tabulating the best clique available for each unsatisfied column in the matrix.

If we can divide the problem into connected components, given by S = {S 1 ,... S n } then the size of the search space is However by attacking each of the problems separately we get the size of the search space as Therefore it now follows that the complexity of this problem is primarily dependent on the size of the largest connected component. In a standard Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graph this grows logarithmically if the probability of an edge existing between a pair of nodes is less than n -1 as in our problem. Although our problem is not truly equivalent to an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graph, the false positive links between different synsets can be reasonably modelled by an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph. Still the complexity of the largest connected component B c log(n) is not polynomial so it is still possible that we may not be able to find the optimal solution for larger test sets, however this would only affect the largest connected components, which as the test set grows larger would represent fewer of the terms and so fewer of the links.

The pattern generation took 51 hours on an Dual Core 1.66 GHz processor with 512 MB of memory, then a further 33 hours to generate feature vectors, but we feel that this could be vastly improved by the use of some kind of indexing of the corpus. The classification took 85 seconds and the synset formation about 5 seconds when based on the SVM Regression data and about 127 seconds when based on the logistic regression probabilities, this was due to more positive links in this data set, hence a larger maximum connected component.",

Also the results after synset grouping appeared to be closer, so we analysed the results according to the degree of relation",

We can clearly see that although both methods had similar precisions, the term pairs produced by the binary classification were more likely to be unrelated. This is not surprising as erroneous links between terms are likely to be caused by artifacts in the data and method and so be nearly totally at random. In contrast we would expect the pattern-based classification system to be more likely to mistake close synonyms for true synonyms, and so these results should be more consistent in relation to our definition of synset formation. So the reduction in error and an increase in number of near synonyms provides evidence for the validity of our model. Table 6 illustrates some sample output from the process.",

Syntaxfree patterns were also generated allowing application to resource-poor languages, however this does rely on the terms which we wish to find having already been identified. In our experimental setup we inputted terminology that had been manually extracted from PubMed abstracts. There exist many named entity extractors which would allow us to completely automate the whole process and develop a large set of noun phrases for our method to classify, hence we could automatically develop a large thesaurus which would be easy to manually check for errors. One of the more surprising results we saw was that most of the patterns we generated seemed to be of quite high precision, which was unexpected as the scoring metric we chose to use in our search was biased towards patterns with a high recall.

Also given the amount of effort required to manually construct a resource, automatic thesaurus construction may prove more useful in many situations, either to aid construction or in replacement of manual construction. More importantly we have shown that we can easily automatically find patterns and we do not require any prior knowledge of the language's grammar in order to do this. Even though the patterns we generated were weak by themselves we showed that by statistically combining them we can get a much stronger result. We have also shown that we do not need to know a large number of synsets to develop an accurate classifier; this implies most importantly that this method can be used quickly on a different language. We tested our method on only a limited domain but we feel it would likely generalize well to other domains. Our novel synset grouping method not only converted the result to something more applicable, but also improved on the results for both a strict definition of synonymy, and a more relaxed definition.",
