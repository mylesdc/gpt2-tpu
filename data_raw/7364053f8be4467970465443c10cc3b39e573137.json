The first human cases were identified in 1954 in Nigeria and serosurveys found evidence of a broad geographic distribution for ZIKV throughout Africa and Asia with sporadic cases in humans [2, 3] . The first recognized ZIKV epidemic occurred in Yap State, Federated State of Micronesia in 2007. An estimated 73% of residents were infected, and of those 18% presented with clinical disease [4] . In 2013, a second epidemic occurred in French Polynesia with 28,000 cases reported. During the latter outbreak, the incidence rate of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) increased 20-fold and first indication of a connection between ZIKV infection and GBS was established [5] . The virus spread to Brazil in 2015 [6, 7] and has since disseminated throughout much of tropical South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and the southern United States, with more than 200,000 confirmed cases [8] . ZIKV can also cause congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) in na\u00efve populations and is therefore a virus of high concern [3] .",

Shepherd and Williams [12] screened 172 wild bats from 12 different species in Uganda for antibodies against ZIKV and found 16/44 little free-tail bats (Tadarida pumila) and 26/36 Angolan freetail bats (T. condylura) were seropositive by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Additionally, two Angolan free-tail bats were experimentally inoculated with ZIKV and serially bled to test for viremia. Both animals were viremic on days 2, 4 and 6 as determined by paralysis in mice inoculated with the sera from those two bats [12] . Simpson and O'Sullivan [13] experimentally inoculated three straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum), three Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacusi), and five Angolan free-tail bats. Two of the straw-colored fruit bats were viremic and had seroconverted. One of the Egyptian fruit bats was viremic and two had seroconverted. The Angolan free-tail bats were euthanized on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days post inoculation and screened for viral tropism. At one day post infection, a kidney was trace positive [13] . Finally, Reagan et al. [14] inoculated 20 New World little brown bats (Myotis lucifigus) by 5 different routes: intracranial, intraperitoneal, intradermal, intrarectal and intranasal. Bats in all groups, with the exception of the intranasal group, developed fatal neurological disease 4-7 days post inoculation. Brain tissue was virus-positive in all animals with clinical disease, determined by inoculation of mice with brain homogenate suspension [14] .",

            "text": "Considering the evidence that African bats are naturally susceptible to ZIKV and that little brown bats develop disease, the question emerged: could bats serve as a natural reservoir host for ZIKV in the New World? To test this hypothesis, we inoculated Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis), among the most abundant bats in the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico, with ZIKV to examine virology, immunology and pathology of the infection. Although virus was detected in several organs, including the testes and brains, no overt clinical signs were detected, and substantial viremia or viruria was not evident. These results suggest that Jamaican fruit bats are unlikely to serve as amplification hosts but that ZIKV infection may constitute a wildlife disease threat to bats.",

No signs of disease were apparent during this 28 day experiment; however, all three bats had antibody titers of 3200 on day 28 (Table 1) . After demonstration of susceptibility in the pilot study, a time course study was conducted. Six male bats (AJ-z1 through AJ-z6) were identically inoculated and two were euthanized at 2, 5 and 10 days post inoculation (dpi). No conspicuous signs of disease were observed in any of the inoculated bats. Necropsies immediately followed euthanasia and no significant gross pathology was evident.",

            "text": "Viruria is commonly detected in ZIKV-infected humans [26] ; therefore, urine may be an equally important diagnostic sample with higher viral load in early infection when compared to blood in humans and other primates [23] [24] [25] [26] . Although urine collection from bats was challenging, we collected urine from some of the inoculated bats in the time course study. AJ-z6 exhibited viruria only at 3 dpi, and AJ-z7 was equivocal only at 5 dpi, corroborating the findings in other mammals that urine may be a route of viral shedding early in infection. Urine from one human patient was positive from the first time point (6 dpi) through 14 dpi and again on day 56. Similarly, saliva from that same patient was positive from day nine through day 14 and again on day 49 [27] . Another investigation compared diagnostic samples of 80 infected patients and showed that urine was positive in 50 of them, whereas serum was only positive in 19 patients by qRT-PCR. The study concluded that viral loads in urine were tenfold higher compared to serum and that uremia lasted longer [25] . These data corroborated the first study that identified ZIKV shed in urine in which there was a higher viral load in urine for longer duration compared to serum [26] . ZIKV RNA in plasma was detected in the bats by qRT-PCR between 2 and 6 dpi, but between 2 to 17 dpi in urine [26] . The lack of detectable viremia in the serum of bats is congruent with some of the human and NHP investigations in that viremia is low and short-lived. Detached renal pelvic urothelial cells and degenerate salivary gland ductular epithelium as seen in the current study will make urine and saliva equally important fluids to collect in order to maximize detection of ZIKV in the acute and established stages of infections.",

            "text": "For this experiment, all male bats were used because female bats are prioritized for colony expansion. ZIKV exhibited tropism for the testes with strong immunoreactivity in reproductive organs (Figs 4 & 7) . Histologically, minimal focal testicular degeneration in two bats ( Fig  2) suggests viral related pathology may be minimal. In humans it has yet to be completely elucidated what reproductive organs harbor ZIKV, it has been determined that semen contains ZIKV both in both vasectomized and unvasectomized men [27, 28] . This suggests that ZIKV is sequestered in the testes and/or accessory sex glands. Mouse models have demonstrated ZIKV infection and associated pathology in the testes [29] [30] [31] of humanized BLT mouse model with infection primarily targeting macrophages and Leydig cells [32] . Limited investigation has been done relating to infection of accessory sex glands in mouse models, but one study that assessed the prostate found no virus, possibly due to differential expression of the receptor candidate in the testes but not in the prostate [29] . For this experiment the finding of viral antigen and viral RNA in the testes but not in the prostate is consistent with published animal models and may suggest the potential for bats to serve as another animal model. Three bats had histopathological alterations in the hippocampus at later time points and one bat had viral nucleic acid present in the brain as determined by qRT-PCR demonstrating tropism for the CNS, a tissue predilection also documented in humans and animal models. ZIKV has a predilection for nervous tissue in animal studies and disease manifestation in humans. As a neurological teratogen, ZIKV has been detected in the brain mononuclear cells in human newborns with fatal microcephaly and fetal miscarriages. Histological lesions are varied but may include parenchymal calcification, microglial nodules, gliosis, cell degeneration, mononuclear infiltration and necrosis [33] [34] [35] . In non-human animal models, evidence for viral tropism has been found in brain and/or peripheral nervous tissue [36] [37] [38] [39] . In immunocompromised mouse models, the virus has a predilection for the brain but with the mice engineered for specific immune traits it is difficult to know to what extent this recapitulates natural ZIKV pathophysiology [40] . In the bats used in this experiment, evidence of ZIKVinduced pathology in the brain is consistent with what has been seen in human newborns and fetuses. The novel finding of co-localizing ZIKV antigen in bat Iba1 + microglial/macrophage cells lends support to the earlier evidence of microglial cell infection via Axl ligand bridging ZIKV particles to glial cells [41] . Iba1 (aka, allograft inflammatory factor 1, Aif1) is a microglia/macrophage-specific calcium-binding protein, which has actin-bundling activity that participates in membrane ruffling and phagocytic activity of activated microglia. Activated microglial cells appeared with increased ability of cell migration and phagocytosis, which is controlled by remodeling of membrane cytoskeleton [42] . The morphology of cells with co-localization in the brain of infected bats is consistent with activated microglia depicting prominent branched processes. Recent primate models in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques demonstrated similar viral distribution of ZIKV antigen to that in bats, described herein. High-level of ZIKV was evident in cerebellar neurons and the same studies documented involvement of Iba1 positive microglial cells in CNS infections. In primate models there is increasing evidence that ZIKV antigen was detected in individuals with the highest peak plasma viremia, which in part implies that ZIKV may initially seed the CNS by a passive spillover from circulating monocytes to resident microglial cells. This is further substantiated in all of human and animal studies, which did not show any evidence of disruption to BBB or viral distribution reminiscent of circumventricular distribution seen in alphavirus animal models [43] .",

Distribution of viral antigen in bat tissues suggests that infection in this species recapitulates human infection, which is thought to start with infection of epidermal and dermal cells with subsequent dissemination to multiple organs including salivary glands as viral RNA can be detected in human saliva [44, 45] . The histopathology for AJ- Zika virus infects new world bats z5, 5 dpi showed sialoadenitis and the presence ZIKV antigen by IHC (Fig 3) . This suggests ZIKV may be shed in the saliva, although additional animal experiments need to be performed to confirm such a route of shedding. The results presented here suggest that Jamaican fruit bats may be a suitable animal model for examining ZIKV infection to elucidate its pathogenesis. Jamaican fruit bats may also serve as a model to ascertain sexual transmission, in utero transmission, teratogenesis and neurological pathophysiology. It may be that ZIKV is a wildlife disease threat for bats that could lead to infertility in some males, which could impact bat populations.",

Additionally, antibodies to DENV were detected in multiple bat species including those of the Artibeus genus in Costa Rica and Ecuador [47, 48] .

Not only have NHP been found to be seropositive, but also many other mammals, including rodents, horses, cows, and goats [50, 51] . Furthermore, experimental inoculation of various North American species resulted in seroconversion (cottontail rabbits, boar goats, pigs, and leopard frogs) and demonstrated viremia (nine-banded armadillo and leopard frogs) [52] . Molecular epidemiology suggests animals play an important role in an enzootic cycle [11] . Much about the enzootic cycle of ZIKV has yet to be understood but it stands to reason that bats may be capable of maintaining the virus in nature. Jamaican fruit bats are found in northern South America, Central America, and the Caribbean-areas that now have ZIKV potentially exposing bat populations to the virus [8, 53] . However, the data presented here suggest it is unlikely that Jamaican fruit bats can serve as amplification hosts of ZIKV, unless virus sequesters in some as-yet unidentified way that could lead to periodic shedding of virus. It may also be that some bats become persistently infected and can transmit sexually to maintain virus within populations of bats. Further experimental and field studies will be necessary to fully understand the ecological role of bats in ZIKV maintenance.",

In order to assay the serum for viral RNA and perform serology, earlier time points were used to assess for viremia and later time points for seroconversion. Along with sample partitioning for data maximization, the small blood volume led to concerns that there would be an undetectably small viral load. To circumvent this issue, neat serum and 1:10 diluted serum were inoculated onto Vero cells to amplify any virus that may have been present at low levels. One blind passage on Vero cells was done and cell supernatants assayed by qRT-PCR. The remaining serum from three of the four bats was assayed directly for ZIKV RNA.",

Antibody for IHC was a polyclonal rabbit antibody that targets preM and E proteins of ZIKV and was provided by CSU VDL's pathology department. The Bond-III automated instrument (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) was used for IHC staining. All slides were blindly read by a diplomat of the American College of Veterinary Pathologists.",

Tissue was dehydrated by using a graded ethanol series of 70% ethanol for 2 h, 80% overnight, 90% for 2 h and 100% for 2 h. Brain tissues were then post-fixed in dimethylbenzene for 30 min and embedded in dimethylbenzene-paraffin at 60\u02daC for 2 h, after which samples were embedded in a metal frame. Sagittal sections were collected at 5um thick. All dewaxing, antigen retrieval and immunofluorescence staining was automated using a Leica Bond RXM. In short, sections were dewaxed using ethanol and then boiled in antigen retrieval solution for 10 minutes. The cooled sections were incubated in 3% H2O2 for 15 min at room temperature and then blocked with 2% donkey and goat serum (Millipore Sigma) for 1 hour. Rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako Chemicals USA, Irvine, CA) and 4G-2 Flavivirus E specific monoclonal antibodies (CDC, Fort Collins) were diluted in TBS to final concentrations of 1:250 and 1:50, respectively. Sections were incubated in primary antibodies concurrently at room temperature for one hour. Following removal of unbound primary antibodies by washing, goat anti-rabbit secondary (AlexaFluor-555) and donkey anti-mouse secondary (AlexaFluor-647) was added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Finally, DAPI counterstain (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was applied and sections were washed with TBS prior to cover slipping for imaging.",
