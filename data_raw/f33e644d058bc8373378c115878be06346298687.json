Since infertility is a major concern following chemotherapy, it is important to characterize the drug-specific damage to the reproductive system to help find appropriate protective strategies. This study investigates the damage on neonatal mouse ovary maintained in vitro for 6 days, and exposed for 24 h (on Day 2) to clinically relevant doses of Docetaxel (DOC; low: 0.1 mM, mid: 1 mM, high: 10 mM). Furthermore, the study explores the putative protective action exerted by Tri-iodothyronine (T3; 10 27 M). At the end of culture, morphological analyses and follicle counts showed that DOC negatively impacts on early growing follicles, decreasing primary follicle number and severely affecting health at the transitional and primary stages. Poor follicle health was mainly due to effects on granulosa cells, indicating that the effects of DOC on oocytes were likely to be secondary to granulosa cell damage. DOC damages growing follicles specifically, with no direct effect on the primordial follicle reserve. Immunostaining and western blotting showed that DOC induces activation of intrinsic, type II apoptosis in ovarian somatic cells; increasing the levels of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 8, Bax and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, while also inducing movement of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol. T3 did not prevent the damage induced by the low dose of DOC. These results demonstrated that DOC induces a gonadotoxic effect on the mouse ovary through induction of somatic cell apoptosis, with no evidence of direct effects on the oocyte, and that the damaging effect is not mitigated by T3.",

Nevertheless, in many cases, patients undergoing intensive treatment experience severe side-effects, either immediately or even years after the therapy. It is well recognized that some anticancer drugs are gonadotoxic, with infertility now representing a major concern for women undergoing cancer treatments, particularly so for younger patients (Meirow et al., 2010) . The key basis for the adverse effects on the ovary is the limited supply of oocytes contained within the ovarian follicles, which are formed before birth. This population of primordial follicles represents a female's ovarian reserve. The reproductive lifespan of a woman ceases when the number of primordial follicles becomes too low (less than around a thousand), leading to the menopause (Wallace and Kelsey, 2010) . Insults and pathological circumstances affecting the ovary can precociously deplete this reserve, leading to premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) with loss of fertility and the consequences of estrogen deficiency.",

            "text": "The severity of ovarian toxicity caused by the taxane class of chemotherapeutic agents has been difficult to determine, in part because they are usually administered in association with other drugs and other adjuvants (Han et al., 2009; P\u00e9rez-Fidalgo et al., 2010; Torino et al., 2012) . Docetaxel (DOC), a second generation taxane, represents one of the most powerful chemotherapeutic drugs against local or metastatic breast, non-small cell lung and ovarian cancer and displays a high level of radio-sensitizing activity (Gligorov and Lotz, 2004) . DOC triggers cells into a programmed cell death pathway, mainly by binding with the b-subunit of tubulin, thus stabilizing microtubules and inhibiting their depolymerization. This results in cell cycle arrest, followed by phosphorylation of bcl-2 and apoptosis (Subrata et al., 1997) . Taxanes can also directly change mitochondrial membrane permeability, ultimately activating caspases (Fabbri et al., 2006) . DOC plasma concentrations in patients are highly variable, with different regimens of 40 mg m 22 administered weekly or 100 mg m 22 administered every 3 weeks used clinically. Pharmacokinetic studies report a plasma concentration of 0.1-1.2 mM and maximum concentrations (C max ) ranging between 0.3 and 6.9 mM within 24 h post-treatment (Baker et al., 2004; Slaviero et al., 2004; Brunsvig et al., 2007) .",

However, effects of DOC are particularly controversial, with other work showing that patients treated with taxanes restore normal menstrual cyclicity more frequently than those treated with other drugs (Minisini et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010) . Ovarian damage has been difficult to assess directly, and most studies have used chemotherapy-induced amenorrhoea as a surrogate for POI, a method that does not allow detection of incomplete ovarian damage. Using a detailed assessment of ovarian function, we previously reported evidence for taxane-induced toxicity in women treated for early breast cancer (Anderson et al., 2006) .",

Drug-specific damage therefore needs to be characterized to define toxicity, with the aim of then finding protective approaches. One possible protective strategy could be to target the ovary with a compound that antagonizes chemotherapy toxicity, but so far this approach has been explored only by laboratory studies. Such studies have investigated different molecular approaches, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate, the retrovirusmediated multidrug resistance gene and the c-Abl inhibitor imatinib (Morita et al., 2000; Gonfloni et al., 2009; Salih, 2011; Morgan et al., 2012) . As one example of this kind of protective approach, thyroid hormones have been hypothesized to minimize the impact of taxanes on ovarian functionality, due to their role on cell proliferation and apoptosis in ovarian somatic cells (Verga Falzacappa et al., 2009 , 2012 . To date, one report has shown that 3,5,3 \u2032 -triiodothyronine (T3) is able to counteract the apoptosis of rat ovarian GCs exposed to the taxane paclitaxel (Verga Falzacappa et al., 2012) .",

In brief, on the day of birth, female mice were sacrificed by decapitation and ovaries dissected out and placed in pre-warmed Leibovitz L-15 medium (Invitrogen, UK) supplemented with 3 mg ml 21 bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich Ltd, UK) and kept at 378C. Whole ovaries were transferred into a 24-well plate (Grenier Bio-one, Stonehouse, UK) containing a-Minimum Essential Medium (Invitrogen, UK) supplemented ith 3 mg ml 21 BSA, placed on floating polycarbonate membranes (Whatman Nucleopore Polycarbonate Membrane, Camlab Ltd, Cambridge, UK) and incubated in a 5%CO 2 atmosphere at 378C (Day 1). On the second day of culture (Day 2), medium was supplemented with 0.1% ethanol-vehicle (CONTROL) or with one of three Docetaxel concentrations (Sigma-Aldrich Ltd, UK): 0.1 mM (LOW-DOC), 1 mM (MID-DOC) or 10 mM (HIGH-DOC). Doses of DOC were chosen to cover the range of concentrations found in the plasma of patients undergoing cancer treatments (Baker et al., 2004; Brunsvig et al., 2007) . On Day 3, all ovaries were transferred into fresh control medium. Half of the medium was replaced on Day 5, with the culture continued to the end of Day 6. Previous work using this experimental paradigm has shown that this time frame supports the health of control cultures, and allows growth initiation of the majority of follicles (Morgan et al., 2013) . Intracellular location of cytochrome C was examined in control and HIGH-DOC treated ovaries. In each run of the cytochrome C experiment, four ovaries were dissected from mice, two placed in CONTROL and two in HIGH-DOC conditions. After 6 days in culture, pairs of ovaries were processed for western blotting as detailed below.",

When the total follicle population was considered, there was a significant increase in the percentage of follicles with unhealthy oocytes relative to CONTROL only in the HIGH-DOC group ( Fig. 2A-i) . In contrast, GCs were markedly affected by DOC exposure even at the lowest drug concentration: the percentage of unhealthy follicles because of unhealthy GCs relative to the total number of follicles significantly increased at all doses tested, compared with no follicles classified as unhealthy due to poor GCs in the CONTROL group ( Fig. 2A-ii) . The percentage of follicles categorized as unhealthy due to unhealthy oocytes and GCs (OO + GCs) was also significantly greater in the MID-and HIGH-DOC groups compared with CONTROL ( Fig. 2A-iii) . When each stage of follicle development was analysed separately, primordial follicles showed no signs of damage in response to drug treatment over that seen in CONTROL primordial follicles (Fig. 2B-i, B- ii, B-iii). In contrast, growing (transitional and primary) follicles were in most cases significantly affected by DOC treatment, exhibiting poor GC, or OO+GC health, even if not in a dose-response manner (Fig. 2B-ii, B-iii) . Overall, results indicate that the primary cell type affected by DOC exposure is the GCs of growing follicles, with significant increase in degeneration even at the lowest concentration.

In addition, western blotting was used to assess expression of Bax (n \u00bc 3 for all groups), release of Cytochrome C (CytC) from mitochondria into the cytosol (n \u00bc 5 for both CONTROL and HIGH-DOC groups) and cleavage of PARP (cPARP) (n \u00bc 5 for all groups). CC3 expression was analysed both by manual counting and also using a more automated system. Firstly, for manual counting, the number of follicles with oocyte and/or GCs that were CC3-positive was recorded and expressed relative to the number of follicles in the section, with follicle counts determined by numbers of MVH-expressing oocytes (Fig. 3C -F) . DOC treatment significantly increased the proportion of CC3-positive apoptotic follicles relative to CONTROL (Fig. 3G) . Secondly, for the semi-automated system, the CC3-expressing area of somatic (granulosa and stromal) cells within a section was measured and analysed relative to total section area; as with the manual counting, the area of apoptosis increased in all DOC-treated groups (Fig. 3H ). The degree of activation of programmed cell death of follicles detected by CC3 expression thus reflected the degree of damage observed by morphological observation after DOC treatment. Furthermore, the level of CC3 expression within the follicles of DOC-treated ovaries was comparable with its level in the somatic cells: in both cases CC3 increased 8-11 fold versus CONTROL. It is noteworthy that the matching of the outcomes in both systems confirms the reliability of this semi-automated system and for this reason, only the latter system was chosen to analyse CC8 expression (Fig. 4) . All treated groups showed an increase in CC8 levels in comparison with untreated tissue (Fig. 4A -D) , with the increase following a doseresponse pattern and significant at MID-and HIGH-DOC doses (Fig. 4E) . In order to further explore the DOC-induced apoptotic pathway, western blotting analysis for Bax, CytC and cPARP was performed (Fig. 5) . Bax expression significantly increased 3.3-fold (relative to b-actin) over CONTROL in the HIGH-DOC group (Fig. 5A-ii) . Exposure to HIGH-DOC also induced release of CytC from mitochondria into the cytosol, leading to a 3-fold decrease in the ratio of mitochondrial:cytosol CytC (Fig. 5B-ii) . PARP cleavage showed a significant increase of 3.6-fold (relative to expression of b-actin) only in the HIGH-DOC group (Fig. 5C-ii) .",

Bearing in mind the need for caution in extrapolating results from an in vitro animal model to consideration of the effects of DOC on human patients, this does together indicate that chemotherapeutic doses of DOC may well induce moderate levels of ovarian toxicity: certainly, further examination of the effects of DOC on the fertility of younger female patients is warranted.",

Furthermore, within the studies examining the degree of amenorrhoea following DOC treatment, some have suggested a marked effect of DOC (Martin et al., 2005; Han et al., 2009) , while others have not (Minisini et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010) , although a more detailed analysis indicated that taxane administration in combination with other chemotherapy agents does add to the treatment's ovarian toxicity (Anderson et al., 2006) . To the best of our knowledge, no data are available from animal models to determine detrimental effects of DOC on fertility. There are some in vivo studies testing the effect of the first generation taxane, paclitaxel, on primordial follicles in adult mice, but these are contradictory. Injection of 7.5 mg/kg of paclitaxel (considered a high dose) in a single or repeated administration, decreased primordial follicle count 1 week after drug exposure (Gucer et al., 2001; Yucebilgin et al., 2004) , while in contrast, another in vivo study used repeated administration of paclitaxel (5 mg/kg) on adult rats, but found no reduction of follicle counts at any pre-antral development stage, with only antral follicles affected (Tarumi et al., 2009) . Mature oocytes exposed to paclitaxel undergo a delay of nuclear maturation and defective spindle formation, leading to aneuploidy (Mailhes et al., 1999) .",

            "text": "Women undergoing chemotherapy usually receive several treatments over a period of months. As human ovarian follicles take 6 months to develop from the dormant state to the fully grown ovulatory follicles ( McGee and Hsueh, 2000) , each treatment will affect a range of follicles at different developmental stages. The major concern about ovarian damage is if it markedly affects the ovarian reserve of resting primordial follicles, as this can lead to POI. Primordial follicle loss could result from a direct effect of damage to the primordial pool, or could be an indirect effect, where the decrease in primordial follicle numbers is through an increased rate of growth initiation due to a major loss of growing follicles, a process termed the burnout model . Although some authors consider mature follicles to be more sensitive to chemotherapy than small follicles (Nicosia et al., 1985; Gucer et al., 2001) , damage specifically to the small number of follicles that are at the late antral stage at any one time point should have, at most, a minor impact on long-term fertility. The present results demonstrated that immature, early growing follicles are severely affected by DOC, in both their number and quality, even at low DOC concentrations. Since early growing follicles are present in large numbers, marked damage to this follicle pool could well result in follicular burnout (Kalich-Philosoph et al., 2013; Morgan et al., 2013) . The burnout model is also in accordance with the observations of others using high doses of paclitaxel on mice in vivo (Gucer et al., 2001; Yucebilgin et al., 2004) . In the present study, primordial follicle number did not decrease significantly, but a negative trend was observed at the highest DOC concentration. This may reflect the particular characteristic of the present model, as the primordial follicle pool in mouse is not completely formed at birth and the short duration of the experiment may not allow full elaboration of secondary effects.",

The present study showed that DOC severely affects early growing follicles, initially damaging GCs, with oocyte damage becoming apparent only after GCs were compromised. Our data also suggest that DOC negatively impacts on stromal components of the ovary, as has been seen from other chemotherapy drugs. A timeline study of the damage produced by doxorubicin, an anthracycline agent used in cancer treatment, revealed that, in the mouse, stromal tissue is the first target, probably due to its contact with the circulatory system (Roti Roti et al., 2012) . Furthermore, human ovarian cortex of cancer patients showed damage to blood vessels and fibrosis, suggesting that the loss of stroma integrity could lead to follicle damage (Meirow et al., 2007) . The explanation for the DOC-induced damage probably lies in the principal mechanism of action of this group of chemotherapeutic drugs: taxanes promote microtubule assembly and inhibit their polymerization, leading to mitotic arrest and apoptosis. Mitotically active cells, such as GCs and stromal cells, are, for that reason, more likely to be vulnerable to DOC damage than oocytes. Oocyte death would follow as a downstream consequence of GC damage and loss of oocyte-GC connections (Thomson et al., 2010) . This DOC mechanism of action may also explain the absence of a dose-response pattern of damage in much of the data presented here: the plateau of damage is perhaps already reached at the lowest concentration able to perturb the cell cycle in dividing GCs within activated-early growing follicles and stroma cells at the time of DOC exposure. Thus, if the ovary was exposed to repeated doses rather than higher doses, this would affect an increasing number of cells subsequently entering into the G2/M phase, and could well lead to more wide spread damage. Similarly, a cytometric study using a bladder cancer cell line (HT1376, American Type Culture Collection line) failed to find a dose-response relationship after 1 h of DOC treatment, while 24 h treatment induced dosedependent cytostatis (Fabbri et al., 2006) .",

Pro-caspase 8 is thought to be the first intracellular cysteine protease activated upon binding of a cell death receptor (Manabe et al., 2004) . GCs then activate the intrinsic, type II mitochondrialdependent apoptotic cascade, subsequently interacting with proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bax (Sai et al., 2012) . Bax is a pro-apoptotic protein that plays a principal role in the mitochondria involvement in cell death. It undergoes conformational changes, integrating into the mitochondrial membrane and hence disrupting its membrane potential. That in turn induces an increase in the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, with a consequent release of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol (Liu et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2014) . Cytochrome C activates the downstream caspases, including effector caspases such as caspase 3, which in turn leads to cleavage of the nuclear substrate PARP, inactivating its ability to support DNA repair.",

            "text": "In the longer term, it may be possible to develop protective measures against the gonadotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents. The proposed protection exerted by thyroid hormone (T3) was investigated here. Thyroid hormones are involved in the development and functionality of the reproductive system, with both hypo-and hyperthyroidism associated with subfertility (Stavreus-Evers, 2012). T3 has been proposed to prevent paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in a rat GC line (Verga Falzacappa et al., 2012) . The present studies show that the same dose of T3 was unable to prevent the ovarian damage induced by a low dose of DOC. DOC and paclitaxel do differ: DOC binds tubulin with higher affinity than paclitaxel and is capable of direct induction of apoptosis via bcl-2 phosphorylation (Gligorov and Lotz, 2004) . Nonetheless, the discrepancy between our data and the results of Verga Falzacappa et al. (2012) could instead be due to the markedly different experimental paradigms used: we suggest that the organ culture system utilized here, where follicles are maintained intact and able to develop intact, as in vivo, is much more physiological than a GC line. While DOC dose was representative of the lowest doses found in serum samples of treated cancer patients, the T3 concentration used here (10 27 M) and in Verga Falzacappa et al. (2012) is almost 30 times higher than the serum concentration of T3 in healthy people and 8 times that in patients with thyrotoxicosis (Sterling et al., 1969) .",

Exposure of granulosa cells to DOC induces cleavage of caspase 8, leading to an up-regulation of Bax. This in turn activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, involving a mitochondrial-dependent cascade in which the mitochondrial membrane becomes increasingly permeable, leading to increased movement of Cytochrome C into the cytosol. Cytochrome C then activates downstream effector caspases, such as caspase 3, which in turn leads to cleavage of PARP, inactivating its ability to support DNA repair.Authors' roles F.L., R.A.A. and N.S. designed experiments; F.L. and R.S. performed experiments; F.L., R.A.A. and N.S. interpreted data; F.L. and N.S. wrote the manuscript; R.S. and R.A.A. critically revised the manuscript.",
