PEDV infection causes 80 to 100% fatality rate in suckling piglets [4] . The outbreak of PED in the United States in 2013 caused significant economic loss [5] . In 2014, PED swept across two sow farms and one fattening farm in South-Western Germany [6] . In January 2015, an outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) emerged in Portugal [7] . Currently, several PEDV vaccines are available, further studies on PEDV pathogenesis will be beneficial to the development of new vaccines.",

Pathogens have evolved different strategies to support their survival by manipulating the host immune responses. Some pathogens evade the immune system and consequently lessen the protective immune response.

Cytokine storm triggered by virus infection is characterized by a significant increase of Research Paper www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, and IL-6) that subsequently results in fever, edema, organ dysfunction and even death [14] .",

Except for the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), PRRs also recognize endogenous molecules that are released during cellular injury or tissue damage, including heat shock and high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) proteins, which are termed as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [15] . HMGB1, previously known as HMG-1 or amphoterin, was discovered over 30 years ago [16] . HMGB1 is a highly conserved and ubiquitous DNAbinding protein which functions as a structural protein of chromatin. It localizes in the nuclei of almost all cell types and participates in the maintenance of nucleosome structure and DNA replication [17] . HMGB1 has a tripartite structure: two homologous DNA-binding domains, HMG boxes, and a C-terminal domain rich with aspartic and glutamic acid residues [18, 19] . The biological activities of HMGB1 depend on its location and post-translational modification status. In the nuclei, HMGB1 regulates transcription and recombination through affecting chromosomal architecture [20] . Although HMGB1 does not possess a signal sequence to assist its release through the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi secretory system, it can be secreted into the extracellular space actively or passively by various cells [21] [22] [23] . Extracellular HMGB1 functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule and activates proinflammatory signaling pathways through TLR4 [24, 25] and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) [26, 27] . Therefore, HMGB1 is considered as a unique mediator in innate immune responses and inflammation-associated events [28] .",

The qRT-PCR result showed that the infection significantly increased the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 ( Figure 1A) ; the mRNA levels of cytokine IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 were elevated remarkably at 24hpi: IL-1\u03b2 (~14 folds), IL-6 (~45 folds) and IL-8 (~105 folds), TNF-\u03b1 (~83 folds).

The data revealed that acetylated and total HMGB1 levels were increased from 1hpi to 8hpi, but decreased later in the supernatant (Figure 2A ). PEDV infection barely affected the total HMGB1 level in the cells ( Figure 2B ), which could be explained by the slight change of mRNA level of HMGB1in the infected cells ( Figure 1B) . The remarkable stability of HMGB1 has been revealed in previous study [33] . Therefore, we suspected that the posttranslational modification of HMGB1, such as acetylation, might play much more critical roles in the pathogenesis of PEDV infection. We next confirmed the translocation of HMGB1 in infected cells in two experiments. First, the infected cells were collected at 6h, 12h and 24hpi to analyze the protein levels of HMGB1 in the cytoplasm and nucleus extracts separately after nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation according to instruction of NE-PER\u2122 Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Thermo Scientific). The result of western blot analysis suggested that HMGB1 protein expression level was elevated in the cytoplasm, but decreased in the nucleus ( Figure 2C ). The purity of the fractions obtained was determined by immunoblotting with specific protein markers: histone H3 (nucleus) and tubulin (cytoplasm). Next, the infected cells were stained with a HMGB1 antibody at 6hpi to investigate the localization change of HMGB1. The results demonstrated that HMGB1 was translocated from the nucleus to cytoplasm in most of the infected cells. Additionally, the cells were also immunostained by PEDV-N antibody to confirm the infection ( Figure 2D ). Overall, our data verified that PEDV infection caused the translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and release into extracellular space.",

The above experiments revealed that HMGB1 was actively released into extracellular space during PEDV infection. HMGB1 antibody could decrease the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine induced by PEDV-N overexpression ( Figure 4K ). Therefore, we performed antibody neutralization experiment to investigate whether the infection could be inhibited after the HMGB1 protein was neutralized. Vero cells were infected with PEDV and then incubated with HMGB1 antibody for 24h. The western blotting analysis demonstrated that PEDV-N protein expression level was decreased ( Figure 7A ). Meanwhile, the RNA level of PEDV ORF3 gene was also inhibited by ~27% ( Figure  7B ) as well as the mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2: ~47.3%, IL-6: 38.1%, IL-8: ~56.9%, TNF-\u03b1: 65.6% ) after HMGB1 antibody treatment ( Figure  7C ). siRNA knockdown experiment was performed to confirm the effect of HMGB1 on PEDV infection. As expected, PEDV-N protein expression was decreased and the RNA level of PEDV ORF3 was decreased 61.5%. The knockdown efficiency of HMGB1 was about 73% ( Figure  7D , 7E, 7F). At the same time, the mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines were significantly decreased, especially IL-6 (~74.3%), IL-8 (~53.7%), and TNF-\u03b1 (~58.8%) ( Figure 7G ). In summary, our data revealed that blockage of HMGB1 could attenuate PEDV infection and decrease the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.",

DAMP molecules lead to the early innate and adaptive immune inflammation after binding to their receptors. HMGB1 contributes to the pathogenesis of influenza virus (H5N1) infection in mice by inducing extensive inflammatory responses and severe pneumonia. The HMGB1 expression is induced in mice on days 3-7 post infection. The HMGB1-specific antibody can reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and enhance the survival rate, but the virus titer is not affected by HMGB1 antibody treatment [51] . It was proposed that virus-mediated cytolysis after initial acute coronavirus infection of alveolar endothelial cells or macrophages results in HMGB1 release from the damaged cells. Extracellular HMGB1 would mediate deleterious pulmonary inflammatory responses, such as epithelial barrier derangement, neutrophil infiltration, lung edema and injury, which subsequently cause respiratory failure, and even death [52] . The global immune response analysis of pigs infected with PRRSV suggested that HMGB1 might manipulate the host immune response and eventually cause the immunosuppression in pigs [53] . Denguevirus infection induces a passive release of HMGB1 in A549 cells, which might also regulate TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-\u03b1 secretion in DENV-infected DCs [34, 54] . Similar to the study on Dengue virus, our data also showed that HMGB1 was translocated from the nucleus into the cytoplasm and released into the extracellular space at the early stage of infection. Both PEDV infection and PEDV-N overexpression resulted in the increase of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8), which could be attenuated by HMGB1 antibody treatment.",
