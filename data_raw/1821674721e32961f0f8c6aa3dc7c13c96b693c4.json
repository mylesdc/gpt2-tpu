Although complete diagnostic autopsy (CDA) is considered the gold standard for determining the cause of death, it is seldom performed in low income settings. In this study, a CDA was performed in 284 deceased patients from Mozambique (n = 223) and Brazil (n = 61). In depth histopathological and microbiological analyses were carried out in all cases dying of cryptococcosis. We determined the cryptococcal species, the molecular and sero-mating types and antifungal susceptibility. We also described the organs affected and reviewed the clinical presentation and patient management. Among the 284 cases included, 17 fatal cryptococcal infections were diagnosed. Cryptococcus was responsible for 16 deaths among the 163 HIV-positive patients (10%; 95%CI: 6-15%), including four maternal deaths. One third of the cases corresponded to C. gattii (VGI and VGIV molecular types, B\u03b1 and C\u03b1 strains) and the remaining infections typed were caused by C. neoformans var. Grubii (all VNI and A\u03b1 strains). The level of pre-mortem clinical suspicion was low (7/17, 41%), and 7/17 patients (41%) died within the first 72 hours of admission. Cryptococcosis was responsible for a significant proportion of AIDS-related mortality. The clinical diagnosis and patient management were inadequate, supporting the need for cryptococcal screening for early detection of the disease. This is the first report of the presence of C. gattii infection in Mozambique.",

            "text": "In a large series of nearly 300 autopsies, we performed a thorough histopathological and microbiological analysis of 17 fatal cryptococcal infections, 12 from Mozambique and five from Brazil. Several studies on cryptococcal infection have been carried out in Brazil 14,28 , but there are no data from Mozambique. Indeed, despite being a highly endemic area for HIV, a literature search was unable to find reports describing the burden of this pathogen in this country. Thus, to our knowledge, this is the largest autopsy-based description of fatal cryptococcal infections in Mozambique. Interestingly, albeit being Maputo and Manaus two sites from different countries in terms of climate and income, some of the results obtained were very similar, such as the HIV prevalence in deceased www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ patients (over 60%) and the Cryptococcus associated mortality in HIV positive patients. In this study Cryptococcus was responsible for 10% of the deaths among HIV-infected patients. This figure is in agreement with current estimates of 15% of AIDS-related deaths due to CM 4 . Although treatment with ART has led to an important reduction in the mortality of HIV-infected patients in sub-Saharan Africa, at present, cryptococcal-related death seems to remain similar to 2008 estimates. In agreement with other autopsy series, HIV-associated cryptococcosis is frequently presented as a disseminated infection 14, 28 . Other studies have reported that up to one half of cryptococcal www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ infections are detected in HIV-infected patients receiving ART 29 . In our series, only a quarter of the HIV-positive cases (4/16) were under ART. Unfortunately, the duration of ART was only available in one case. This case had a 6-year history of ART and a high viral load, and therefore, likely represents a treatment failure or defaulted. Other explanations for cryptococcal infection in patients receiving adequate ART include recent treatment initiation in patients with very low CD4 counts (late HIV diagnosis) and cases of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 30 , which might also have been present in our series. Despite progress in ART deployment in sub-Saharan Africa, close to 50% of HIV-infected patients continue presenting to health facilities with advanced HIV disease 31 , thereby being at high risk of cryptococcal infection and death. In this regard, the CrAg can be detected up to three weeks before the onset of CM symptoms 32 and therefore, screening of asymptomatic HIV patients followed by preemptive antifungal treatment might identify patients at risk of developing the disease and contribute to reducing CM-related mortality 33, 34 . In the present study, most cases died within the first week of hospital admission, which is in contrast with other series reporting a mean of two weeks between admission and death 35 . Several factors might have contributed to the rapid fatal outcome in our series. Firstly, the low frequency of clinical suspicion of cryptococcosis may explain the absence of prescribed antifungal treatment in more than half of the patients. On the other hand, some patients may have presented to the hospital with advanced severe stages of cryptococcal infection, considering that seven died within three days of admission (four within 24 hours). The longest hospital admission involved a child who died of C. gattii meningitis about two months after hospital admission. C. gattii infections are rare in children, and as in the child in this series, the infection often occurs in previously healthy children and presents with CNS involvement 9 . The little knowledge available about C. gattii in sub-Saharan Africa has been obtained from studies performed in South Africa. Interestingly, in our study four out of the 12 cryptococcal infections (25%) from Mozambique were due to C. gattii infections. Although the numbers are small and should be interpreted with caution, these data contrast with previous findings from South Africa, where C. gattii represented only 2.4% of the cryptococcal strains isolated over a two-year period 36 . C. gattii infections have mainly been reported in immunocompetent hosts, until studies from South Africa revealed that it affects immunocompromised patients as well 37, 38 . It has been reported that the VGI C. gattii molecular type is much more likely to affect immunocompetent patients than VGIV 9 . However, both genotypes were detected in HIV-infected patients in our study. All strains of C. neoformans var. grubii were molecular type VNI and possessed the sero-mating type A\u03b1, similar to most of the strains described in South Africa. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. gattii in Mozambique, and the B\u03b1 and C\u03b1 types detected have been previously reported in South Africa 39, 40 . Although no clinical breakpoints are available for Cryptococcus, antifungal susceptibility testing did not suggest clear resistance patterns, with only MICs one dilution above the ECV being found.",

Although the numbers are small, dissemination of the infection seems to be less intense in HIV-infected patients with C. gattii compared to C. neoformans. Larger studies are needed to better assess the histopathological features of C. gattii in HIV-infected patients. Moreover, studies based on post-mortem examinations should be performed to better assess the mortality attributable to specific pathogens in low-and middle-income countries. Accurate mortality data can then impact public health policies, for example, guiding prophylactic and treatment schemes for infectious diseases.",
