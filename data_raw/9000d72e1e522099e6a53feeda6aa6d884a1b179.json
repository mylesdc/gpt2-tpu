            "text": "The recent discovery of novel alphacoronaviruses (alpha-CoVs) in European and Asian rodents revealed that rodent coronaviruses (CoVs) sampled worldwide formed a discrete phylogenetic group within this genus. To determine the evolutionary history of rodent CoVs in more detail, particularly the relative frequencies of virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission, we recovered longer fragments of CoV genomes from previously discovered European rodent alpha-CoVs using a combination of PCR and high-throughput sequencing. Accordingly, the full genome sequence was retrieved from the UK rat coronavirus, along with partial genome sequences from the UK field vole and Poland-resident bank vole CoVs, and a short conserved ORF1b fragment from the French rabbit CoV. Genome and phylogenetic analysis showed that despite their diverse geographic origins, all rodent alpha-CoVs formed a single monophyletic group and shared similar features, such as the same gene constellations, a recombinant beta-CoV spike gene, and similar core transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). These data suggest that all rodent alpha CoVs sampled so far originate from a single common ancestor, and that there has likely been a long-term association between alpha CoVs and rodents. Despite this likely antiquity, the phylogenetic pattern of the alpha-CoVs was also suggestive of relatively frequent host-jumping among the different rodent species.",

The first coronavirus (CoV) was discovered during the 1930s [1] , and the first human coronavirus was characterized in the 1960s [2] . Since then, five novel human coronaviruses have been discovered. The coronavirus family gained particular notoriety with the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2013. In humans, coronaviruses are associated with respiratory disease, causing a range of symptoms from mild common colds to more severe lower respiratory tract infections that can be lethal. CoV infection in a range of non-human mammals and birds is associated with enteric and respiratory diseases as well as hepatitis and neurological disorders [3] .",

The rat viruses contained within a single cluster supported by 100% of bootstrap trees, while PLMg1, UKMa1, and AcCoV-JC34 fell in strongly supported more divergent positions. The phylogenetic relationships within the rodent clade are therefore the same as those observed in the ORF1b phylogeny (rabbit L232 is not shown because it was not possible to retrieve the corresponding N gene sequence). Table 3 . List of all the predicted core transcription regulatory sequences (TRS) for all the genes of the rodent alpha-CoVs. Core TRS could not be predicted for ORF1ab, S, ORF3, E, and M for UKMa1 as there was no available sequence for those genes. AcCoV-JC34 did not possess an ORF2 such that there was no core TRS for that gene. A markedly different evolutionary relationship was observed in the case of the partial S gene phylogeny, in which all the rodent-borne CoVs previously assigned as alpha-CoVs based on their ORF1 and N sequences clustered within the genus Betacoronavirus (Figure 4 ). Within this genome region, these viruses clustered with other known recombinant coronaviruses, including Wencheng Sm shrew CoV, Bat CoV HKU2, BtRf-AlphaCoV, Swine acute diarrhoea syndrome CoV, and swine acute diarrhoea syndrome related (bat) CoV. The rodent coronaviruses again formed a single branch with 100% bootstrap support, indicative of an ancient recombination event between the \u03b1and \u03b2 CoVs.",

The tanglegram was generated by linking the phylogenies of rodent alpha-CoV ORF1b to their equivalent rodent species and assessing whether there were changes in the branching order in the two phylogenies, which would indicate cross-species transmission. The rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus; order Lagomorpha) sequence was used as outgroup as it has previously been shown to be closely related to the Rodentia order [5] . Notably, the topology of the cytochrome b tree did not fully match that observed for the rodent alpha-CoVs, in which PLMg1 (Myodes spp.) fell basal to all the other viruses, and RtMruf and RCoV/RMU10 3212/Myo gla/GER/2010 (Myodes spp.) were more closely related to Rattus spp. coronaviruses (UKRn3, Lucheng Rn, RtRl).

Under the most likely co-phylogenetic scenario, virus-host co-divergence explained 22% of all evolutionary events, with host-switching (i.e., cross-species transmission) more frequent at 45% (and duplications accounting for 33%), although the relative frequency of these events is likely to change with more extensive sampling. Hence, these data suggest that although the rodent alpha-CoV formed a monophyletic group indicative of a long virus-host association, the evolution of this group of viruses was likely characterized by relatively frequent cross-species transmission.

Rattus norvegicus originated in Southeast Asia and spread to Northeast Asia approximately 200,000 years ago. It then spread from Southeast Asia to the Middle East~3100 years ago, then to Africa~2000 years ago, and finally to Europe~1800 years ago [28] . Therefore, it is possible that even though the European UKRn3 coronavirus appears to be approximately as old as Lucheng Rn CoV, the global spread of the brown rat implies that the virus introduction into Europe occurred with that host and was a relatively recent event.",

Not only is this common ancestry evident in the phylogenetic relationships inferred from multiple genes, but also genomic signatures are the recombinant spike gene, same gene constellations (ORF2, ORF3, ORF6, ORF8, and ORF9), and similar core TRS sequences. Finally, although the current sequence data set of rodent alphacoronaviruses is relatively small, it is representative of a number of different rodent species living across a wide geographical area.",

The novel coronavirus sequence obtained from a UK-resident Microtus agrestis was analysed alongside reference sequences representing three different coronavirus genera (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus as an outgroup). Reference sequences are indicated by their GenBank accession numbers. Branch lengths are drawn to a scale of nucleotide substitutions per site. Numbers above individual branches indicate the percentage that the branch was found in 1000 bootstrap replicates; only values >80% are shown. Alpha-CoVs are highlighted in brown, betacoronaviruses in blue, gammacoronaviruses in green, and the rodent coronaviruses in light red. Viruses 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 (A) Tanglegram of rodent cytochrome b and CoV ORF1b evolution. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of full-length rodent cytochrome b nucleotide sequences compared to rodent alpha-CoV ORF1b phylogeny. Cytochrome b sequences were obtained from GenBank for the rodent species Microtus, Myodes, Rattus, and Apodemus, and the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, which was used as an outgroup. Branch lengths are drawn to scale: the bar indicates 0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site. Numbers above individual branches indicate the percentage that that branch was found in 1000 bootstrap replicates; only percentages >80 are shown.
