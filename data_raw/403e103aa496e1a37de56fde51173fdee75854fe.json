            "text": "Immune responses are a double-edged sword. Effective and appropriate immune responses capable of controlling viral infection while also largely preserving tissue integrity, are critical for host survival. Too strong immune responses might result in immune pathology, while too weak immune responses might cause viral persistence. Physiologic ageing is accompanied with a decline in the normal functioning of the immune system, which is termed as \"immunosenescence\". We show that aged mice (16-19 months old) are more resistant to influenza A virus (IAV) infection than the young mice. Strong immune responses in the young mice after IAV infection result in faster clearance of virus, but also cause severe lung injury and higher mortality rate. While in the aged mice, the delayed and milder immune responses contribute to reduced pulmonary damage, and are still capable to clear the infection even with a slower kinetics, displaying a more resistant phenotype during IAV infection. Hence, our work demonstrates that moderate immune responses as a decline with ageing in the aged mice balance the immune pathology and viral clearance, might be beneficial for the host during certain circumstances. Our results provide important insight to our basic knowledge of immunosenescence and immune defenses to invading pathogens. Further, our results indicate that age factors should be considered when investigating the vaccination and therapeutic strategies for severe IAV infection.",

            "text": "Induction of both innate and adaptive immune responses is crucial for the control of viremia after IAV infection. However, the current understandings of IAV infection suggest that excessive host-immune responses lead to immunopathology followed by respiratory dysfunction and mortality [16, 17] . After IAV infection, pro-inflammatory responses are initiated by the host and involve the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and chemokines (KC, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-2, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10) which facilitate the initial phase of innate immune cell recruitment into the lungs [18, 19] . Although pro-inflammatory responses are critical for the early control of viral replication, excessive inflammation also increases the level of tissue damaging cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic products in the lungs, which result in severe complications leading to death [20, 21] . During highly pathogenic viral infections, including influenza A virus H1N1 [22] , H5N1 [23] , H7N9 [24] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) [25] , Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov) [26] , the immune inflammation and hypercytokinemia, or \"cytokine storm,\" induce severe lung injury, which is the most common cause of death in patients [27] . In the elderly population, due to the decline in the normal functioning of the immune system, the ability to initiate primary immune response against novel antigens decreases with age [6, 28, 29] . And this may benefit for the elderly to infections in some cases. For example, during the early weeks of the 2009 pandemic of influenza A/H1N1 (pH1N1) in Mexico, the majority of people who died of pneumonia were under 50 [30] . Comparison of patients hospitalized in China with IAV showed that the median age of individuals confirmed infection with H7N9 was 63 years old, while with H5N1 infection was 26 years old and with 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection was 25 years old [31, 32] . These reports indicate that different influenza viruses might have distinct age patterns of severe infection and symptom. However, many factors influence the final outcome after IAV infection. Factors like cross-reactive antibodies in the case of the 2009 pandemics and economic activities on avian influenza infection might play dominant roles for the patterns during some infections [16, 30, 33] .",

The number of the IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 + T cells showed a similar pattern. Compared to young mice, the percentage of CD8 + T cells in the lungs of aged mice also significantly reduced without infection. After infection, the CD8 + T cell in the lungs of young mice increased and reached peak on 7 dpi, then kept the similar level until 16 dpi.

The cytokines and chemokines produced by these cells are important defense against IAV infection preventing the replication and spread of the virus. However, the nonspecific innate immune response can be locally destructive if not appropriately contained [41] . Certain influenza viruses, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/H5N1 strains, can trigger an overly inflammatory innate immune response, often called \"cytokine storm\" [47] .

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that increased survival in the IL-15 -/mice or NK cell-depleted wild-type mice after IAV infection was associated with significantly lower lung lesions, decreased mononuclear cells and neutrophils in the airway lumen as well as lower proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-12 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [48] . Our results showed that the early inflammatory cytokines, lung pathology, neutrophils infilitration, and the overall NK cell responses in the lungs of aged mice were significantly lower than the young mice on 3 dpi, which was consistent with the reduced bodyweight loss in the aged mice after PR8 infection. Therefore, the higher overall NK cell responses in the early infection may contribute to the enhanced lung pathology in the young mice. Further, NF-kB activation is a hallmark of inflammatory and antiviral responses mediated especially by type I interferons that block viral replication, however, previous studies showed that active NF-kB signaling is required for effective influenza virus infection [49] [50] [51] . Thus, the higher viral loads in the lungs of the young mice on 3dpi were in accord with the early activation of inflammation and lung injury. Although the early viral loads were high in the young mice, the virus were cleared rapidly with the effective and strong T cell responses, as most of the viruses were cleared on 10 dpi. On the other hand, in the aged mice, even though the viral load was lower on 3 dpi compared to the young mice, the viral clearance were prolonged because of the delayed and milder T cell responses. Of note, even the peak strength of CD4 + T cell responses were severely reduced in the aged mice (1.593\u00b10.5105 in the aged mice on 7 dpi compared to 6.446\u00b11.863 in the young mice on 7 dpi), the strength of peak CD8 + T cell responses in the aged mice (16 dpi) were at a similar level, albeit a little reduced, compared to that in the young mice on 7 dpi (17.30\u00b10.9212 in the aged mice on 16 dpi compared to 24.77\u00b12.117 in the young mice on 7 dpi). Therefore, the delayed and milder T cell responses in the aged mice were still capable to finally clear the virus, as the viral loads in the aged mice were mostly cleared on 15 dpi. On the other side, CD8 + T cells are partly responsible for the pathogenesis of acute pneumonia caused by influenza A virus [52] . Thus, the lower CD8 + T cell responses in the aged mice might have also contributed to the reduced lung lesions in the aged mice. However, many factors might influence the final outcome after IAV infection.",

In the H5N1 and 2009 pandemic H1N1 infection, most of the hospitalized patients were young people with median aged at 25. While in the H7N9 infection, the median age of patients was 63 [31] .

This progressive pro-inflammatory state, termed \"inflamm-aging,\" affects the phenotype/function of cells present in the aged, including monocytes, macrophages, and DC cells [57] . Previous study reported that the number of neutrophils was relatively higher in the elderly, but the effector functions such as chemotaxis and intracellular killing were decreased. And the macrophages and DC cells also showed age-related changes, including the decreased cytotoxicity, intracellular killing and antigen presentation. These changes resulted in the impaired adaptive immune responses in the elderly [54, 55, 58] . In our research, the alveolar macrophages decreased in the lung of young mice on 3 dpi, which was consistent with a previous report that more than 90% of resident alveolar macrophages were deleted in the first week after influenza infection [39] . While the percentage of DC and neutrophils increased in the lungs of the young mice. However, alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and DC cells remained largely unchanged in the lungs of the aged mice on 3 dpi.",

The strong immune response in the young mice resulted in faster clearance of IAV virus, but also caused severe lung injury, which led to higher mortality and pronounced bodyweight loss. While in the aged mice, the delayed and weaker immune responses were still capable to eventually clear the virus infection but with limited tissue damage. Therefore, the aged mice exhibited a more resistant phenotype during the IAV infection. Previous paper reported when infected with sub lethal doses of (50-100pfu) PR8 \uff0c compared to adult mice, aged mice (18-19M , BALB/C) had higher morbidity [59] . However, some research also investigated that aged mice (2.5-years-old, C57BL/6) were more resistant to the PR8 infection than the young mice [60] . Therefore, the resistance of the young and aged mice to influenza virus may be influenced by the age, physical status and strain of the mice, and infecting virus doses.",

Pre-existing cross-reactive anti-influenza immunity or second bacterial infections is not a mechanism to be considered for the age-related phenotype in our research. We only investigated the primary infection of influenza virus, and in this situation, the aged mice were more resistant than the young mice. But in the clinic, many factors might contribute to severe outcome after IAV infection, such as secondary opportunistic bacterial infections [61] . Moreover, our results support the hypothesis that the \"cytokine storm\" is one of the main cases of the high mortality rates in highly pathologic viral infections, such as SARS and H5N1 infections, in the young people rather than the aged population [23, 25] . Aging is a continuum of changes that are progressive with time. The decline of immune functions with ageing might also be a gradual and progressive process. Therefore, from young to ageing, there is a gradual decline in the strength and speed of the host immune responses against viral infections. For some highly pathogenic viral infections, the excessively strong immune responses initiated in the young host might be harmfully for the host because of severe pathological damage. On the other hand, low strength of immune responses in the aged host might result in viral persistence. However, during the whole continuum changes, there might be a balance point where the moderate immune responses are still capable to clear the infection while with reduced pathologic damage, which are beneficial for the host. This model is illustrated in Fig.7 . This balance point might vary with different virus, infecting dose and route.",
