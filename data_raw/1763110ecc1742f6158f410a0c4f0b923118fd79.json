            "text": "Influenza spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics, resulting in the death of hundreds of thousands of people annually-millions in pandemic years. Several worldwide influenza outbreaks that arose in the last century claimed the lives of tens of millions; each of these pandemics was caused by the introduction of a viral strain with an HA subtype not found in other human influenza viruses. In February-April 2009, a novel H1N1 strain-a reassortant of human and swine influenza viruses with Eurasian avian-like swine viruses-appeared in Mexico, followed by the United States and other nations. At present, neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir have been efficacious against the current H1N1 strain of swine origin; however, the virus may acquire resistance to the available antiviral drugs. In fact, the incidence rate of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 influenza viruses in the United State increased from 0.7% in the 2006-2007 influenza season to 98.5% in the 2008-2009 influenza season [1] . Although vaccines are also available for the prevention and control of influenza virus infection, they need to be frequently revised-typically every 1-3 years in the case of seasonal influenza vaccines-to accommodate mutations in the HA and NA proteins of the circulating viruses (antigen drift). In addition, it has recently been reported that in response to variation in neutralizing antibody pressure between individuals, the influenza A virus evolves by adjusting receptor binding avidity via amino acid substitutions throughout the HA globular domain, many of which simultaneously alter antigenicity [2] . Host-oriented mechanisms involved in influenza infection, rather than viral proteins, should therefore be envisaged as promising targets for the development of novel, potent therapeutics that are effective irrespective of viral subtype.",

These include signaling molecules related to viral replication, innate immune responses, and apoptosis, as well as signal transduction pathways regulating more fundamental and physiological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Among them, the family of lipid kinases phosphoinositide-3 kinases (PI3Ks), a key regulator in many cellular processes [7] , is one of the commonly listed host factors across the literature [3, 4, 5, 6] , indicating the crucial role of this protein in influenza virus infection. Accordingly, it was reported that the multifunctional viral non-structural protein (NS1) binds directly to the regulatory subunit p85b, but not p85a, and stimulates the lipid kinase activity of the p85-associated catalytic subunit p110 of PI3K [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] . Although this PI3K activation is apparently of importance in promoting efficient virus replication at a late step of the infection [11] , the underlying mechanisms by which PI3K contributes to viral infection remain controversial. In fact, it was paradoxically reported that PI3K inhibition is effective only in the initial stage of infection [13, 14] , indicating a bivalent role for PI3K in both early and late stages of infection.",

The viruses then fuse with the membrane of late endosomes to release the viral genes necessary for replication [15, 16, 17] . A growing body of evidence shows that influenza viruses undergo clathrin-dependent endocytosis. However, the virus can still enter the cells even with inhibition of clathrin-or caveolae-mediated endocytosis, suggesting that influenza viruses infect cells through an additional clathrin-and caveolae-independent endocytic pathway [18] . We have recently reported that PI3K bound to Ras is preferentially translocated to the endosome and activated in this subcellular compartment; however, a role for this binding in the endosome has yet to be determined [19] . In this study, we demonstrate that Ras-PI3K signaling plays an indispensable role in the regulation of clathrinindependent endocytosis and influenza virus entry.",

Clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis in these cells was assessed by uptake of fluorescently labeled transferrin and dextran, respectively. The treatment of wild-type MEFs with the pan-PI3K inhibitor LY294002 significantly reduced the uptake of dextran, but not that of transferrin ( Figure 1A , B), confirming that PI3K is specifically involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis, as reported previously [20] . Pik3cg-deficiency in MEFs also displayed an inhibitory effect on dextran uptake; however, the inhibitory effect observed in the mutant MEFs was significantly less than that of LY294002-treated cells ( Figure 1A , P = 1.2610 27 , LY294002-treated Pik3cg +/+ vs. Pik3cg 2/2 ). Because PI3Ka and PI3Kb are expressed in these mutant cells [21] , the difference in capacity for dextran uptake between LY294002-treated wild-type and Pik3cg-deficient MEFs could be accounted for by the remaining activity of the a and b subtypes of PI3K in the Pik3cg 2/2 cells. Interestingly, the PI3Kc K251E mutant, which fails to bind to Ras [22] and hence to translocate to the endosome via activated Ras ( Figure S1A, B) , was unable to display a compensatory effect, unlike its wild-type counterpart ( Figure 1A ), while the expression levels were shown to be comparable by immunoblotting ( Figure S1C ). Given that the mutants lacking Rasbinding retain the catalytic activity [23, 24] , this result demonstrates the significance of Ras-mediated activation of PI3K in the regulation of clathrin-independent endocytosis.",

This resistance to influenza was restored by the expression of wild-type PI3Kc but not by that of the K251E mutant ( Figure 3A ).

Immunofluorescence analysis using an antibody against the influenza nucleoprotein NP revealed that the total number of adsorbed virus particles was comparable among the tested conditions ( Figure S2A ); however, the ratio of particles colocalized with Rab proteins to the total number of particles, which is expected to represent the virus entry rate, was reduced in LY294002-treated wild-type MEFs, Pik3cg-deficient MEFs, and knockout MEFs expressing the K251E mutant ( Figure 3C and Figure S2B , C). These findings are consistent with the results of dextran uptake (see Figure 1A ). The delivery of viral particles from early to late endosomes, which can be analyzed by calculating the ratio of virus particles colocalized with CFP-Rab5 and YFP-Rab7 to the total number of internalized particles, was concomitantly retarded in knockout cells and in mutant PI3Kc-expressing cells ( Figure S2C ). This suggests that Ras-PI3K signaling also modulates virus trafficking from early to late endosomes via the regulation of endosomal maturation (see Figure 1C ). The PI3K inhibitor promoted retention in early endosomes more efficiently than Pik3cg ablation ( Figure S2C , P = 4.1610 23 ), indicating that other subtypes of PI3Ks also play a role in viral trafficking.",

To examine activity of endogenous Ras, we used the Bos pull-down method in which GTP-bound, active Ras is recovered from cell lysates by its preferential avidity to the GST-fused Ras-binding domain (RBD) of c-Raf1 [26] . As shown in Figure 5A , B, Ras activation was efficiently promoted at 30 minutes after PR8 infection, irrespective of the presence or absence of PI3Kc. Ras activation by PR8 could also be observed in Cos-1 cells ( Figure 5C ). In addition, expression of the dominant negative mutant of Ras (Ras S17N) inhibited influenza virus infection, whereas expression of its wild-type counterpart rather enhanced the infection ( Figure 5D , E), together demonstrating a requirement for Ras in influenza virus infection. We further assessed the phosphorylation status of Akt, a commonly used marker of PI3K activation, by immunoblotting using an antibody specific for phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt, S473). Surprisingly, although influenza infection was definitely inhibited in Pik3cgdeficient cells, Akt phosphorylation was induced by virus exposure for 6 hours ( Figure 5A ). Upon PDGF stimulation, essentially similar Ras and Akt activation was observed, even in the absence of PI3Kc ( Figure 5F ), which is consistent with a previous report that the Akt phosphorylation level induced by extracellular stimuli is not altered by ablation of PI3Kc [27] . Moreover, although the PI3K binding to Ras is critical for influenza virus infection (see Figure 3A , B), the kinetics of Akt phosphorylation were apparently distinct from those of Ras activity ( Figure 5B ). In fact, kinetics of Akt phosphorylation induced by influenza virus infection are reported to be in a manner dependent on cell contexts and viral strains [13] . We therefore postulated that PI3K activation is disturbed in a manner specific for subcellular localization and that in our system Akt phosphorylation at the whole-cell level is an inappropriate indicator of PI3K activity at such an early stage of infection.",

            "text": "The GFP-tagged pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt (PH-GFP) was therefore utilized to monitor PI3K activation. Akt-PH recognizes the PI3K product phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP 3 ) [and its hydrolytic product PI(3,4)P 2 ], therefore this molecule tagged with fluorescent proteins gives a measure of PI3K activation with spatiotemporal precision by its translocation to specific subcellular organelles. Because a dominant negative effect of the expression of this protein on influenza infection has been reported [13] , we carefully identified an expression level of PH-GFP that would avoid inhibition of infection ( Figure S3A, B) . Under this condition, accumulation of PH-GFP reflecting PI3K activation promoted by influenza virus infection could be observed not only at the plasma membrane but also in vesicular structures, in which influenza virus particles and Rab5 were colocalized ( Figure 6A ). Given that expression of Ras S17N, as well as LY294002 treatment, inhibited this colocalization, we can say that PIP 3 accumulation in the early endosome requires Ras in addition to PI3K activity per se. Interestingly, whereas virus particles could localize in both early (Rab5 positive) and late (Rab7 positive) endosomes, the fluorescent protein-tagged PH domain could do so only in early endosomes ( Figure 6A , B). These findings suggest that PI3K is also required for the transition from early endosomes to late endosomes where PI3K activity is already diminished; inhibition of PI3K activity actually resulted in the retention of viral particles in early endosomes (see Figure S2C ). Furthermore, upon viral infection, Ras colocalized with viral particles, the PH domain, and Rab5 in a manner dependent on Ras and PI3K activities ( Figure 6C ). Given that Ras is indispensable for activating PI3K in the endosomes [19] , these results together underscore an important role for the Ras-PI3K pathway in PIP 3 production in early endosomes upon viral infection.",

            "text": "The PI3K pathway has gained general acceptance as being one of the key regulators for the cellular entry of a range of viruses and intracellular bacteria [13, 14, 28, 29, 30] ; however, the mechanistic scenario in which PI3K functions has been far from understood. We hereby show that Ras-mediated PI3K activation is mainly required for virus entry during infection. This is consistent with reports that PI3K inhibition is effective in reducing titers of progeny viruses only when the inhibitor is applied earlier than 4 h.p.i., whereas the treatment at 4 h.p.i. or later is not able to display this effectiveness anymore [13, 14] . Given that lack of Ras-PI3K binding failed to localize PI3K in the endosomes ( Figure  S1A, B) , Ras plays a determining role in the virus-induced, transient activation of PI3K in the endosomes. Notwithstanding this PI3K activation, phosphorylation of the major PI3K downstream molecule Akt at this early stage was not significant, and became prominent only at post-entry stages ( Figure 5B ). These kinetics of Akt phosphorylation are consistent with a previous report, where transient Akt phosphorylation is detected with lesser amplitude than that observed at a late stage, in a manner specific on cell contexts and viral strain [13] . These observations regarding the small amplitude of Akt phosphorylation may be accounted for by the restricted activation of PI3K in early endosomes, as we presented here, and the proportion of Akt activated by Ras-PI3K to total Akt can determine the extent of phosphorylated Akt detected by immunoblotting. Alternatively, given that the expression of wild-type or dominant-negative forms of Akt does not significantly alter virus entry [13, 14] , PI3K in the endosomes may utilize PIP 3 binding factors other than Akt to regulate virus entry.",

Because the time course of this Akt activation is apparently different from that of Ras activation, slow Akt activation may be independent of Ras, but rather mediated by the viral protein NS1 through direct binding to the PI3K regulatory subunit p85b [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] . The PI3K-Akt pathway is also reported to participate in events associated with late steps, including the regulation of interferon production through interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 phosphorylation in response to double-stranded RNA [13, 31, 32] .",

The first step of influenza virus infection is adsorption to sialylated proteins on the cell surface. Thus, the type of sialylation of cell surface proteins is of great importance to determine virus host specificity; however, none of the sialylated proteins has been identified as a single specific receptor for this virus to date. On the other hand, it has recently been reported that the mannose 6-phosphate receptor is a sialic acid-independent receptor for influenza viruses in macrophages [33] . Given that the PR8 strain, used in this study and capable to activate Ras, cannot bind to the macrophage cell surface molecules, including this receptor, after sialidase treatment [33] , signal transducers from influenza virus to Ras should be sialylated proteins. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the receptor tyrosine kinase fibroblast growth factor receptor is in a list of host factors implicated in influenza virus infection in several genomewide studies [3, 4, 5, 6] . However, other acceptor mechanism(s) are likely to be dominant; our preliminary experiments show that the receptor inhibitor produced marginal effects on the infection and the level of phosphorylated tyrosine in the total cell lysate was not strikingly altered by the infection (data not shown).",

            "text": "In the present study, we utilized PI3Kc because this class IB PI3K can be expressed in a manner independent of the regulatory subunits [34, 35] , which allows for the complementary expression of the catalytic subunit in the Pik3cg-deficient cells, as we demonstrated. One may raise a concern about the use of fibroblasts as a model because the expression pattern of this molecule has been thought to be restricted within leukocytes. However, recent accumulating evidence indicates that PI3Kc functions and is expressed in a much wider range of cell contexts than previously believed; e.g. endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, cardiofibroblasts, and a vast majority of solid cancer cells [36, 37, 38, 39] . In the present study, the genetic ablation in fibroblasts indeed resulted in a decreased endocytic ability and influenza infectivity (Figures 1-3) . Moreover, a similar inhibitory effect on these phenomena was also observed by the PI3Kcspecific inhibitor AS605240 in several cell lines tested (data not shown), proving that PI3Kc is apparently indispensable for operating influenza virus entry in a variety of cell lines including fibroblasts. Other subtypes of PI3K including class IA (PI3Ka and b) may also participate in influenza virus infection because the pan-PI3K inhibitor LY294002 achieved more efficient inhibitions than pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of PI3Kc. Among the stages of the influenza life cycle, viral entry is one of the remaining sanctuaries to be targeted for prevention and therapy. In addition, virus internalization after adsorption is a relatively non-specific process and is conserved over a range of viral subtypes and species. It therefore presents a promising target for achieving potent therapeutics with a broad spectrum of efficacy and a lower rate of resistance. To this end, a number of studies have attempted to identify the mechanism by which influenza enters cells and have implicated clathrin-mediated endocytosis, through which about 60% of the virus particles are indeed internalized [40, 41, 42] . However, expression of a dominantnegative form of Eps15 and knockdown of epsin 1, both of which are involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, do not hamper influenza virus infection [41, 43] . In contrast, ablation of the Ras-PI3K interaction restrained influenza virus internalization via inhibiting clathrin-independent endocytosis (Figures 1 and 3) , underscoring Ras-PI3K-mediated, clathrin-independent endocytosis as one of the key pathways of influenza virus entry, whereas clathrin-dependent endocytosis is a supportive one. Our finding may also be applied to other viruses, apart from influenza viruses, namely the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus or dengue virus, both of which are known to infect via clathrinindependent endocytosis [44, 45] .",

            "text": "Figure S1 Establishment of cell lines stably expressing wild-type or mutant PI3K that lack the ability to bind Ras. (A and B) The K251E mutant failed to translocate to the endosomes by active Ras. Cells expressing wild-type PI3Kc or its K251E mutant along with GFP-H-Ras G12V were fixed and incubated with anti-HA and anti-EEA-1 antibodies, followed by further incubation with a mixture of secondary antibodies. The cells were then observed by confocal microscopy. The right panels show whole-cell images to indicate where the left panels are from (A). Fluorescence intensities of AlexaFluor594 (Alexa594, blue), GFP (green) and AlexaFluor647 (Alexa647, red), along with the line in the merged image in (A), were plotted from a to b. Note that overlapping peaks indicate colocalization (B). This indicates that the K251E mutant of PI3Kc cannot localize to the endosomes by active Ras. (C) Total cell lysates obtained from each cell line denoted at the top were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody. Expression levels of b-actin were used as a loading control. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments. (D) Impairment of endosome maturation in cells lacking Ras-PI3K binding. Cells processed as in Figure 1C were observed using a confocal microscope. Representative images are shown. ",
