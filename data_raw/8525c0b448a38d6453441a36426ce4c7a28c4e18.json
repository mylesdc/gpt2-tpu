            "text": "In recent years, there have been increasing numbers of infectious disease outbreaks that spread rapidly to population centers resulting from global travel, population vulnerabilities, environmental factors, and ecological disasters such as floods and earthquakes. Some examples of the recent outbreaks are the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Co) in the Middle East, and the Zika outbreak through the Americas. We have created a generic protocol for detection of pathogen RNA and/or DNA using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and reverse dot-blot for detection (RDB) and processed automatically in a microfluidic device. In particular, we describe how a microfluidic assay to detect HIV viral RNA was converted to detect Zika virus (ZIKV) RNA. We first optimized the RT-LAMP assay to detect ZIKV RNA using a benchtop isothermal amplification device. Then we implemented the assay in a microfluidic device that will allow analyzing 24 samples simultaneously and automatically from sample introduction to detection by RDB technique. Preliminary data using saliva samples spiked with ZIKV showed that our diagnostic system detects ZIKV RNA in saliva. These results will be validated in further experiments with well-characterized ZIKV human specimens of saliva. The described strategy and methodology to convert the HIV diagnostic assay and platform to a ZIKV RNA detection assay provides a model that can be readily utilized for detection of the next emerging or re-emerging infectious disease.

The most recent is Zika virus (ZIKV), which is an emerging arbovirus in the genus Flavivirus and family of Flaviviridae, related to yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Zika virus is transmitted among humans primarily by mosquito vectors (Aedes spp., including Ae. aegypti and Ae. Albopictus) [6] [7] [8] and humans serve as the primary amplification hosts in areas where there are no nonhuman primates [9] . ZIKV was first identified in Uganda in 1947, and since then outbreaks have been recorded in Africa, Southeast Asia, Pacific with the last one in Brazil in early 2015, which spread to other countries in Central and South America, the Caribbean, and the Southern United States [10] [11] [12] . In all these areas autochthonous and travel associated infection has been reported [6] [7] [8] 13] . Early pathogen identification is necessary to combat the spread of these newly emerging and re-emerging epidemics [14, 15] . Diagnosis can be accomplished with a generic platform and protocol designed to identify any pathogen by detection of the pathogen's nucleic acid once its sequence is determined and its antigenic footprint identified. The same platform can be utilized to detect any emerging or reemerging pathogen by modifying the primers and probes to detect specific target nucleic acid sequences and once identified, antigenic epitopes that can be utilized to detect pathogen specific antibodies.",

This is in part due to the relative simplicity of building an isothermal device, but also due to the strand displacement quality of the polymerase so there is no need to denature double stranded DNA prior to amplification. LAMP uses two separate sets of primer pairs that specifically recognize 6 distinct target regions. Addition of a third pair of primers (forward and reverse loop primers) increases the sensitivity and decreases the time required for results [20] .

The processing and analysis on the Rheonix CARD 1 cartridge is controlled by the Encompass Optimum workstation developed to provide automated control of all sample preparation functions as described in Spizz et al. 2012 [28] . Since the current Encompass Optimum workstation does not possess the ability to monitor fluorescence, we employed a novel reverse dot-blot (RDB) hybridization technique to monitor the specific ZIKV amplicons produced in the RT-LAMP assay using hybridization to nucleic acid probes immobilized on integrated DNA arrays [30] . Coupled with the workstation's image analysis software, qualitative viral loads can be determined. In this approach 50 \u03bcl of sample containing pre-heated lysed ZIKV was added to the sample reservoir on the Rheonix CARD 1 [16] . All other steps were automatically performed under software control. The RT-LAMP reaction mix was dispensed automatically into the master mix reservoir onto the Rheonix CARD 1 cartridge [16] and pumped with 7 \u03bcl of the spiked sample to the amplification tube where the RT-LAMP reaction was carried out at 65\u02daC for 30 min.

            "text": "The recent ZIKV outbreak is an example of the course of emerging infectious diseases. ZIKV infection had been considered to only be a modest public health concern with only local outbreaks [31, 32] . However reports from the recent outbreak in Brazil and the Americas during 2015-2016, indicated that infections during pregnancy are associated with microcephaly and other neurological disorders in newborns and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) in adults pointing to potentially more serious health impacts [33, 34] . On 1 February 2016, the World Health organization (WHO) declared ZIKV and its link to birth defects a public health emergency of international concern and it lasted during 10 months [35] . ZIKV diagnosis is a challenge because it shares vectors, geographic distribution and symptoms with Dengue virus and Chikungunya infection [36] and the three illnesses are often misdiagnosed. Given the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes in women infected with ZIKV during pregnancy, it is particularly important to distinguish between the 3 viruses. This recent ZIKV outbreak confirm that we need an effective surveillance and diagnostic program to reduce the impact of future emerging infectious diseases. Towards the goal of increasing the speed of making effective diagnostics available, we have developed a generic protocol that can be adapted for the next emerging or remerging disease. Although PCR is a sensitive assay used for diagnostics, PCR requires trained personnel, dedicated equipment and extended time (hours) for results. Isothermal amplification methods have increasingly attracted attention due to their simplicity and sensitivity including nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), rolling circle amplification (RCA), multiple displacement amplification (MDA) and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) [37] [38] [39] [40] Among commercially available isothermal systems, LAMP stands out for its rapidity, sensitivity and ability to amplify both DNA and RNA [17] . This is why we chose the LAMP assay to detect HIV viral RNA in the HIV diagnostic dual assay that we developed [16] . Then we successfully adapted it to detect DNA from P. falciparum and P. vivax by simply changing the primers and optimizing the LAMP assay [41] .",

Drawbacks to saliva as a test matrix are that the concentration is frequently lower than typically found in serum and circadian variations in analyte concentrations can make the sensitivity lower [46] . However recent development of microfluidic concentrators suitable for diagnostics makes the analysis of nucleic acid targets that are present in low levels [47] possible.",

We also determined the limit of detection of the assay with a dilution series of purified genomic ZIKV RNA from multiple strains of the Asian-lineage. ZIKV RNA levels of 2 x 10 3 RNA copies/ml (6 RNA copies/reaction) were consistently detected in the four strains.

This approach successfully detects ZIKV RNA using the RDB technology on the Rheonix CARD 1 cartridge and coupling this with the workstation's image analysis and software capability provides a semi-quantitative titer of viral load based on the image density of the hybridized spot. Estimating the viral load can be useful to investigate correlations of viral load with disease severity and immune responses. This would be of particular importance for monitoring fetal infections in pregnant women [52, 53] . We demonstrated the ability to perform a fully integrated RT-LAMP assay including RDB detection on the Rheonix CARD 1 cartridge using ZIKV spiked in saliva down to 8.57 x 10 2 RNA copies/ml (6 RNA copies/reaction). The same limit of detection was obtained for the RT-LAMP assay on the Genie III with saliva samples spiked with ZIKV. Ongoing experiments are focused on optimizing the conditions for amplification of ZIKV RNA directly by heat-lysing the virus in the Rheonix CARD 1 cartridge and without purification of ZIKV RNA. Eventually the entire assay will be validated on Rheonix CARD 1 cartridges using well-characterized ZIKV human specimens as well as samples from people infected with other flaviviruses to confirm the reactivity and specificity of the assay.",

The compact and portable real-time Encompass MDx SOLO workstation can process a single Rheonix CARD 1 cartridge, allowing a total of 4 samples to be simultaneously processed with real-time fluorescence monitoring. We moved to the larger Encompass Optimum Workstation because it allows 1 to 6 Rheonix CARD 1 cartridges (24 samples) to be processed simultaneously. Since the Encompass Optimum workstation does not employ fluorescence excitation and detection system, the RDB technique was employed to interpret the molecular results by use of hybridization to nucleic acid probes immobilized on integrated DNA arrays. A major advantage of the Encompass Optimum workstation over the Encompass MDx SOLO workstation is that the Optimum workstation automatically introduces all samples and reagents to the Rheonix CARD 1 cartridge, which reduces the complexity of the final assay for the end user. In addition user friendly and intuitive software is included in the workstation guiding the user.
