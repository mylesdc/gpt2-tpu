In the present study, we describe a challenge experiment with the same recombinant FCoVs in order to gain data on the in vivo characteristics on these viruses. While parent virus FIPV DF-2 developed feline infectious peritonitis in all the infected cats, its recombinant virus PBFIPV-DF-2, differing only in seven nucleotides, proved to be surprisingly low virulent, although caused an acute febrile episode similarly to the original FIPV DF-2. PBFIPV-DF-2 infection induced significantly lower virus neutralization titers than its parent virus, and lacked the second phase of viremia and development of fatal course of the disease. The recombinant PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i with completed ORF3abc gained biological properties that differentiate between the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and FIPV biotypes such as intensive replication in the gut, absence of viremia and weak or no serological response. Using reverse genetic approaches our study is the first experimental proof that ORF3abc is indeed responsible for the restriction of FECV replication to the intestine in vivo.",

The total number of animals was carefully determined by considering two main principles: i.) the number of animals should be ensured proper amount of samples for statistical analysis and ii.) the 3R rules (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) must be implemented.",

Although alterations of several different genes of FCoV are suspected in the background of phenotypic characteristics, the most widely accepted theory suggests the possible role of the truncated ORF3abc in the altered tropism and consequent pathogenesis of the two biotypes [9, 14, 16, 18, 24] . However, an identical FCoV pair differing only in the intactness of ORF3abc has not been tested yet in vivo due to the lack of a cell culture for propagation of type I FECV and a ''true'' type II FECV isolate [8] . Our previous in vitro experiments added further evidence to the involvement of truncated ORF3abc to the increased macrophage tropism of type II FCoV [17] . In the present study, characterizing the parent FIPV DF-2 and the recombinant FCoV pair in in vivo experiments, we were able to distinguish significant differences in their biological properties.",

The infection kinetics of the two viruses was similar in the first days of infection, with the first replication peak at day 7 p.i.

This theory was reinforced by genetic investigations [24] that revealed that nondeleted ORF3abc of FIPVs accumulates four times more unique non-synonymous amino acid mutations in the ORF3abc than the FECVs, possibly modifying the biological function of these proteins.",

Furthermore, a single nt change was present at position 27817 (C/G) affecting the last nucleotide of ORF 7 transcription regulatory sequence (TRS), and a 1-nt substitution also occurred at position 28492 (G/C) causing an amino acid change at position 121 (K/N) in the 7b protein. The possible role of mutation of the TRS of ORF7 in decreased ORF7 mRNA transcription was examined by an ORF7-specific subgenomic qRT-PCR assay, and similar subgenomic ORF7 mRNA levels were detected after inoculating FCWF cells with the wild type and recombinant FCoVs, indicating no effect of this mutation to mRNA transcription (data not shown). The genome of PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i contained only the point mutations observed in the infectious clone.",
