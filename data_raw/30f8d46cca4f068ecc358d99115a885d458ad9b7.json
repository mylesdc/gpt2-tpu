            "text": "Identifying effective antivirals for treating Ebola virus disease (EVD) and minimizing transmission of such disease is critical. A variety of cell-based assays have been developed for evaluating compounds for activity against Ebola virus. However, very few reports discuss the variable assay conditions that can affect the results obtained from these drug screens. Here, we describe variable conditions tested during the development of our cell-based drug screen assays designed to identify compounds with anti-Ebola virus activity using established cell lines and human primary cells. The effect of multiple assay readouts and variable assay conditions, including virus input, time of infection, and the cell passage number, were compared, and the impact on the effective concentration for 50% and/ or 90% inhibition (EC 50 , EC 90 ) was evaluated using the FDA-approved compound, toremifene citrate. In these studies, we show that altering cell-based assay conditions can have an impact on apparent drug potency as measured by the EC 50 . These results further support the importance of developing standard operating procedures for generating reliable and reproducible in vitro data sets for potential antivirals.",

EBOV is a biosafety level-4 pathogen transmitted by contact with bodily fluids, fomites, or droplets from PLOS infected patients. EBOV is considered a significant threat to public health and global security due to its potential to be used as a bioweapon [5] [6] [7] [8] . Currently, no FDA-approved vaccine or therapeutic agents are available, and supportive care remains the standard for Ebola virus disease (EVD) treatment. Therefore, accelerated efforts in the development of therapeutics is a key objective in the EBOV research community, especially since the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic in Western Africa. Drug discovery and development requires considerable time and resources to identify an effective drug that will progress to clinical trials [9, 10] . As a result, research investigating the repurposing of drugs for additional indications have become increasingly more prevalent to accelerate the identification of therapeutic drugs for EVD. The off-label use of FDA-approved drugs is particularly advantageous as safety concerns and ethical problems have already been addressed [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

However, the development of a screening assay to detect compounds with anti-EBOV activity was previously limited due to the difficulty of developing a suitable high-throughput screening system for a biosafety level-4 viral pathogen. Classical methods evaluate drug efficacy include the reduction of virus yield [15] or a decrease in viral RNA transcription as determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [16] [17] [18] . Recent therapeutic screening methods have transitioned from the classical methods of measuring viral inhibition to assays with the ability to be automated, resulting in higher-throughput. Assay chemistries have been developed to enable the homogeneous measurement of a variety of different endpoints such as cytopathic effect, viral protein or reporter gene expression, which can serve as markers of viral replication [19] . The growing interest in identifying drugs with activity against EBOV has resulted in a variety of assays and readouts for activity as well as cytotoxicity. The use of cell-based assays for highthroughput screening of compound libraries has increased steadily over recent years [20] [21] [22] [23] . As cell-based assays monitor specific viral proteins and provide the means to screen for potent viral inhibitors intracellularly, these assays identify drug candidates with desired pharmacological properties in the primary drug-discovery pipeline.",

The cell layer frequently became fragile, and at later time points, the cell layer would lift off the well surface possibly because of increased exposure to virus, higher MOI, or manipulation of plates during the fixing/staining procedure (Fig 2G) .

For reproducible data, we determined that the percentage of EBOV-positive cells should be kept within a range of 10 to 80% and the S/N ratio at 4 to 10. At lower S/N ratios (<4) or lower percentage of infected cells (<10%) distinguishing activity of a drug from non-activity becomes increasingly difficult. On the other hand, at higher S/N ratios (>10), when cell infection rate trends towards 80-90% and cells overgrow at later time points, the risk of a disrupted cell layer is greater. Cell layer disruption increases the variability of the assay. Therefore, the optimization of assay conditions (i.e., duration of infection, virus input) was carefully calibrated resulting in a compromise between signal strength and cell viability.",

            "text": "To increase sensitivity of the drug screen assays, a chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CELIA) was developed for evaluating compounds for anti-EBOV activity. The CELIA combines the advantage of specificity of an immunoassay with the high sensitivity of a chemiluminescent enzyme detection assay and is a simple and low cost screening assay [34, 35] . The CELIA was compared to the fluorescent assay (detected by regular plate reader or the HCI system) by testing the efficacy of toremifene citrate against EBOV infection in Huh 7 cells with a range of MOIs (0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 ) at three different time points (24, 48 and 72 hpi) . Assay parameters, signal-to-noise (S/N), and Z' factor, were compared between the assays (Table 3) . At the earliest time point (24 hpi), the CELIA had higher sensitivity than the fluorescent detection assay as the Z' were in the acceptable range (>0.2) even at the lowest MOI of 0.1. In contrast, the fluorescent assay required higher MOIs for reliable data sets (Z'>0.2). At the 48 hpi time point, both detection methods generated high quality data sets with the CELIA providing improved Z' factors (>0.8). At 72 hpi, the CELIA and the fluorescent assay also produced excellent data using HCI for detection, while the fluorescent data detection by regular plate reader showed higher variability, maybe due to cytopathic effects. The EC 50 s and EC 90 s Factors that influence Ebola antiviral activities in cell-based assays were determined on those data sets with acceptable Z' (>0.2) and overall there was good correlation between the different detection methods (Table 4 ). All detection assays demonstrated that higher MOI and longer times of exposure led to an increase of the EC 50 values for toremifene citrate. In contrast, the EC 90 values showed considerably lower fluctuations under the different conditions tested.",

EBOV propagates very well in this cell line, and many laboratories, including ours, generate their virus stocks and determine virus titers in Vero E6 cells. However, the argument to use a cell line with more relevance to human disease has come up repeatedly. Hence, the human liver cancer cell line, Huh 7 and human MDMs were chosen for these studies. Macrophages are relevant to human disease, and they are considered to play an important role in virus dissemination in pathogenesis of EVD [37] . Therefore, a drug that is highly effective at inhibiting EBOV infection in MDMs may better translate to in vivo potency than Vero E6 cells.",

MDMs demonstrated optimal replication starting as early as 24 hpi at an of MOI 0.1. In contrast, EBOV grew slower in Vero E6 and Huh 7 cells. The optimal conditions for evaluation of drug efficacy using the fluorescent assay were at an MOI of 0.1 for the 72 h time point or at an MOI of 1 for the 48 h time point for all 3 cell types to ensure a strong virus signal and avoid destruction of cell layer (Fig 2G) . However, an MOI of 1 is not suitable for detecting inhibitors of later steps in the virus life-cycle. The ability to detect inhibitors of virus assembly or egress will be reduced with increasing MOI, as higher proportions of the cells will be infected even in the Factors that influence Ebola antiviral activities in cell-based assays Though Vero E6 cells are one of the most broadly used cell lines for testing compounds in in vitro assays, our data show that the performance of these cells is not ideal especially when evaluating drugs for anti-EBOV activity. Although it is never a good idea to passage cells for too long [38, 39] , we found that at lower or higher passages the Vero E6 cells can show a decreased percentage of EBOV-positive cells. Huh 7 cells showed more efficient and more reliable virus replication irrespective of passage number. Immortalized cancer cell lines are in general an easy choice for in vitro drug testing because they are easy to handle, propagate, expand, and plate on a week-by-week basis with relative consistency. In contrast, primary cell types such as human primary macrophages do not proliferate in cell culture and are ideally generated fresh from human blood upon use. For large scale testing, procuring the blood volumes needed for generating MDMs from a cumbersome isolation technique could be a challenge. MDMs demonstrated very efficient spread of virus through cell culture over time. Donor-todonor variability precludes consistency, and in general, macrophages from different donors are not pooled. Despite of the constraints, testing a selection of drugs that are closer to human clinical studies in human macrophages makes sense to get a better idea on efficacy in a more relevant target cell.",

Readings are quick and conducive to handling large numbers of plates during screening. However, the quality of the cell layer cannot be monitored. HCI provides images of 1 or more fields of each well, and a nuclear stain can be added in parallel to indicate the viability of the cell layer. In the assay development phase, this tool is especially useful in identifying conditions that will ensure a healthy cell layer or identify issues such as plate corner or edge effects for assay quality control. One drawback is that not the whole well is imaged, but only a certain number of fields inside the well. It is important to pick the fields wisely to avoid bias or skewing of data. Scanning at least 8 fields per well is recommended for statistical purposes, but that will increase reading time per plate. The time to read and analyze the HCI data can take considerably longer than the data acquired with the regular plate reader. HCI measures different parameters such as percentage of EBOV-positive cells and mean signal intensity per cell. Both the regular plate reader and HCI have unique applications in a drug testing program. While a plate reader is good for a quick readout of large number of plates, the HCI system is used to cross check on quality of cells and to clarify issues of noise and signal variability.",
