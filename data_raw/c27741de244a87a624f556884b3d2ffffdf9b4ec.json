In this study we analyzed proteomics data obtained with the SomaLogic technology from blood serum of a cohort of patients and matched healthy subjects. We developed a workflow based on biomarker identification and network-based pathway analysis that allowed us to describe different deregulated pathways. In addition to muscle-related functions, we identified other biological processes such as apoptosis, signaling in the immune system and neurotrophin signaling as significantly modulated in patients compared with controls. Moreover, our network-based analysis identified the involvement of FoxO transcription factors as putative regulators of different pathways. On the whole, this study provided a global view of the molecular processes involved in Duchenne muscular dystrophy that are decipherable from serum proteome.",

Despite these technological improvements, the extraction of knowledge from the data produced is still challenging and the development of data analysis workflows capable of providing additional insight compared to traditional methods would be highly advantageous. In particular, a first desirable outcome is the identification of accurate diagnostic and prognostic markers suitable for subject stratification, which would shorten the path to the application of precision medicine concepts to the clinical practice [4] [5] [6] . Another highly desirable outcome is a better understanding of the disease on the basis of the newly available proteomic profiles. For this second aim a systems biology approach based on network analysis would enable integration of highly descriptive disease biomarkers with existing knowledge and potentially provide additional insight on the affected biological processes [7] [8] [9] . In this work we introduce an approach to achieve both these aims using recently published proteomics data obtained from a Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) cohort. DMD is a rare disease caused by mutations in the gene that encodes dystrophin. The main clinical feature observed in DMD patients is the presence of muscular damage coupled with chronic inflammation that leads to a progressive muscular degeneration and fibrosis. The average age of diagnosis is usually at four-five years, when the symptoms appear and the disability starts to arise [10] . The availability of disease biomarkers that can be assessed using simple, non-invasive techniques would be useful to better understand the biological pathways altered in the disease and could be used for an early diagnosis. To this second end, serum creatine kinase (CK) level is usually evaluated. However, blood CK concentration shows high variability because it is influenced by age of the child, physical activity extent and pharmacological treatments [11] . In our study we employed an optimized version of the rank-based classification algorithm introduced in [12, 13] to identify two biomarker panels based on SomaLogic profiles of DMD patients and controls and characterize their classification performance. We then used the panels as the starting point of an analysis aimed at identifying the biological pathways altered in the disease. To circumvent the limitation represented by the relatively short list of proteins measurable in blood with the SomaLogic array, we resorted to a network-based systems biology approach to identify a list of biological processes that are affected in DMD. Therefore a first contribution of our study is the identification of accurate diagnostic and prognostic markers suitable for subject stratification. Another contribution is a better understanding of the disease in terms of pathways identified as affected on the basis of the altered serum proteomic profiles.",

The biomarker discovery algorithm identifies subject-specific lists of proteins, herein called signatures, which are then compared in order to classify each subject as belonging to one of the two classes (affected or controls). The aggregation of the individual signatures produces a list of proteins useful for subject classification and we refer to it as a 'biomarker panel'. Since the method can be tuned to obtain panels of different lengths, we applied it twice with different settings to obtain two biomarker panels, as shown in Fig 1. The shorter one was obtained specifically for classification purposes, while the longer one was derived to identify the biological processes affected by the disease. Specifically, we used the proteins in the long biomarker panel as input to the network-based tool NASFinder that identified functional modules from the sub-networks connecting biomarker proteins to known transcription factors.",

Overall, we determined that individual signatures formed of just two proteins out of a panel of six were satisfactory to discriminate DMD patients from controls with perfect accuracy (averaged over all the cross-validation rounds) and permutation test p-value < 0.001. These six protein epitopes correspond to the following genes: CA3, CD55, CDH5, CKB/CKM, FGG and TNNI2 (Table 1) . Principal component analysis performed on the dataset containing only data about these six proteins confirmed the separation between DMD patients and controls according to the main axis of variation (S1 Fig). The contribution of each protein in achieving a control/affected Proteomics data produced with SOMAscan technology were analyzed using a rank-based classification algorithm. We obtained two set of proteins (biomarker panels) useful for subject classification and disease characterization. The longer biomarker panel was used as input for network-based analysis.",

As an aid in interpreting the distance matrix, a map of the subjects is drawn by using the shortest N = 20% distances, with colors added afterwards according to control/affected status. In this case, the map clearly shows the emergence of two well-defined groups, with subject perfectly segregated by disease status (Fig 2D) . The six proteins are related to different fundamental aspects of the disease. In particular, serum creatine kinase is a marker of muscular damage [15] and it has been known for a long time for being increased in DMD patients, even if it is not DMD-specific [16] . Similarly, carbonic anhydrase 3 is another indicator of muscular damage and it is highly expressed in skeletal muscle. Also troponin is a muscle-specific protein involved in regulating muscle contraction and it was found in blood after prolonged exercise [15] . In addition to these proteins with a muscle origin, the biomarker panel included CD55, which encodes a regulator of complement cascade and, together with fibrinogen and cadherin, is likely involved in fibrosis, a DMD hallmark [17, 18] .

We identified 31 proteins whose serum level changes significantly with age. The top 5 proteins are shown in Fig 4 and the full list of biomarker proteins is shown in S2 Fig and S2 Table. With two exceptions, in all cases the protein levels decreased with age in DMD patients while they remain stable in controls. Nine of them showed a significant age-related change also in controls but the variation observed in the two groups was different and did not affect their separation (S3 Fig). These results are not unexpected since the disease is known to affect protein levels along its progression and this change has been related to the progressive loss of muscle mass [20] .

The genes coding the biomarker proteins present in the \"myogenesis\" gene set are: TNNI2, CKM, TPM2, FABP3, MAPK12, GSN, MB, CKB, NOTCH1 and CAMK2B. In addition to the muscle-related biological functions, Biocarta pathway analysis revealed the presence of proteins involved in the coagulation cascade and pointed out the presence of different signaling pathways differentially regulated in DMD individuals compared with controls (Table 3 ). In particular, significantly enriched Biocarta pathways included different gene sets related to insulin receptor-PI3K/Akt pathway (igf1-mtor pathway, akt pathway and igf1r pathway), consistent with the already described role of PI3K/Akt in muscle atrophy and hypertrophy [22, 23] .",

In our workflow we applied NASFinder, a network analysis tool we recently developed [14] . Specifically, we mapped on a global signaling interaction network the 52 proteins in the biomarker panel and we identified the sub-networks connecting these proteins with transcription factors (TF). We opted for the use of TF as source nodes because they are at the top of signaling and regulatory cascades. The connections between TF and proteins of interest were established by NASFinder preferentially through differentially expressed proteins (see details in Materials and Methods). To identify the biological processes associated with the disease regulatory circuits we performed a network-based pathway enrichment analysis. The significant pathways are reported in Table 4 together with the transcription factors that NASFinder identified as the most probable regulators. On the whole, the resulting gene sets are partially overlapping, as shown in Fig 5 and S3 Table, suggesting the presence of a shared regulated biological process that involves multiple pathways. Indeed, only myogenesis did not show genes in common with other pathways and, as a confirmation of its peculiarity, the transcription factor selected as putative regulator was MEF2C, a transcription activator specific of muscle genes. In the enrichment map it is interesting to observe the centrality of BioCarta BAD pathway, a gene set related to the regulation of the proapoptotic molecule BAD. Among the regulators of the sub-networks the Forkhead family of transcription factors was the most represented with 3 members: FOXO1, FOXO3 and FOXO4. They were respectively identified as regulators of the sub-networks enriched in genes involved in acute myocardial infarction pathway, cancer pathways, neurotrophin signaling and immune system pathway. In particular, eleven proteins in the NASFinder FOXO3 sub-network are present in the neurotrophin pathway (p-value = 1.34 x 10 \u22127 ). Seven of them (corresponding to the genes CAMK2A, CAMK2B, CAMK2D, FASLG, MAPK12, PIK3CA and PIK3R1) derived from the biomarker while the others (NFKB1, FOXO3, MAPK3 and PIK3CG) were added by NASFinder on the basis of the differentially expressed proteins. It is interesting to observe that 7 proteins (coded by the genes MAPK12, CAMK2A, CAMK2B, CAMK2D, MAPK3, PIK3CA and PIK3R1) were also identified in the Reactome immune system pathway (p-value = 0.003). Considering all the sub-networks and the related pathways pinpointed by NASFinder, PI3-kinase subunit alpha (PIK3CA) and PI3-kinase regulatory subunit alpha (PIK3R1) were identified as the proteins shared among all pathways, with the exception of myogenesis and myocardial infarction. The two proteins are subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, a key element in PI3K/AKT pathway, a regulator of several signaling cascades and in particular of FoxO signaling [24] .",

To further assess the similarity of the results between the two studies, we investigated their protein signature with our analysis workflow. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, although none was significant after multiple test correction, some of the most enriched pathways are shared between the two studies (see S5 Table) . Using NASFinder, the analysis identified 12 statistically significant pathways (S6 Table) . Interestingly, three of them (immune system, hemostasis and myogenesis) are shared with our analysis, and for myogenesis the transcription factor identified as a close regulator is the same. Comparing our results with the study by Ayoglu and collaborators [25] , which was performed with an antibody bead array platform, creatine kinase and carbonic anidrase were the proteins in common with those of our long panel. GSN was already pinpointed in mass spectrometry analysis of human serum by Cynthia Martin et al. [26] . In the comparison we also included two studies performed using a DMD mouse model. In this case, nine proteins were in common with a study that used the SOMAscan technology for proteomic profiling [27] and five proteins with a study based on mass spectrometry [28] .",

Based on this consideration we decided to analyze a type of evidence complementary to our proteomics data; specifically we selected a public dataset of genome-wide expression data obtained from the skeletal muscle of DMD and controls (GSE1004). This dataset contains expression data from quadriceps of patients with clinical symptoms consistent with a DMD diagnosis, whose biopsies were shown to be dystrophin deficient [29] . After having calculated the differentially expressed genes, to investigate the biological processes affected, pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the differentially expressed genes as input and we evaluated the overlap with the pathways identified by NASFinder. With the exception of two Biocarta gene sets, all the pathways identified by NASFinder from the proteome datasets resulted significantly enriched, as reported in Table 5 . We further evaluated the dysregulation of these pathways in a dataset of DMD patients in early phases of the disease and controls (GDS3027). These data allowed us to test the dysregulation of the pathways in a pre-symptomatic phase of the disease. With the exception of Biocarta gene sets, the other pathways resulted among the top 20 results (S7 Table) .",

Our workflow is based on the combination of two complementary methodologies: biomarker identification and network analysis. We applied the algorithm for biomarker identification to point out the essential features of the biological system, i.e. the minimum set of proteins able to fully separate healthy from affected subjects, and then we applied the network analysis to unravel the complex interactions among the proteins. Taking advantage of the flexibility of our algorithm, we calculated two different protein lists, a short one and a long one. All the proteins present in the short biomarker panel have been already described as DMD biomarkers in Hathout et al. [20] and they are related to the main pathological features observed in DMD [6] . However, the short biomarker panel described here, compared with the signature in Hathout et al. [20] , has the advantage of being able to classify the subjects with only six proteins achieving perfect accuracy and high statistical significance (permutation test p-value < 0.001). Our long biomarker panel has size comparable to the disease signature reported in Hathout et al.",

            "text": "(52 vs 46 proteins, respectively) but only approximately half of the proteins (26) are in common between the two lists. Such low overlap is not surprising in view of the fact that the different approaches used in the two studies (classification-oriented vs statistical significance) have been shown not to be equivalent [30] . From an investigational point of view, our classificationoriented list provides some additional insights on less known aspects of the disease pathophysiology and in particular to identify deregulated pathways and potential regulators. Indeed, in addition to proteins with a muscle origin, likely found in the serum proteome as a consequence of sarcolemma leakage [31] , our analysis pointed out several proteins involved in cell signaling that, given their biological role, it is not surprising to detect in blood serum. Our results are in line with growing evidences suggesting that the cellular structural instability caused by the lack of dystrophin affects different signaling pathways [32] [33] [34] . In particular, the network-based pathway enrichment analysis implemented in NASFinder identified nine pathways as significantly enriched and, among the influential nodes, different transcription factors belonging to the FoxO family were identified as possible regulators. In humans FoxO proteins are all expressed in skeletal muscle and they have been implicated in muscle homeostasis [35] . Specifically, regarding muscle mass, FoxO proteins were shown to enhance proteolysis through the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosome system [36] . Notably, a study on sarcopenia, the physiological age-related loss of muscle mass, identified FOXO3 as an upregulated gene in muscles from old subjects [37] and another study found increased FOXO1 mRNA in aged muscle [38] . However, findings from a more recent study suggest that sarcopenia is not due to FoxO activation [39] , highlighting the need for further studies to better understand the role of FoxO proteins in physiological and pathological muscle conditions. Among the sub-networks regulated by FoxO proteins, the neurotrophin signaling pathway, a cascade of biological processes regulating cell survival and apoptosis [40] , was identified as enriched in our analysis. Although neurotrophins have been mainly linked to the nervous system [41] , recent studies indicated their involvement in skeletal muscle adaptation and regeneration [42] . Specifically, experimental evidences showed that neurotrophins are involved in muscle regeneration in dystrophic mice [43] and the nerve growth factor, the paradigm of neurotrophin family, was identified in muscles from patients affected by DMD [44] . Interestingly, a recent study performed using the mdx mouse, a model of DMD, linked apoptosis of myofibers to the presence of connexin, a protein channel involved in NF-\u03baB activation, iNOS expression and apoptotic cell death [45] . In our analysis NFKB1, a DNA binding subunit of the NFKB protein complex, is present in the FOXO3 sub-network defined by NASFinder and the protein is part of the neurotrophin-related signaling. The network proximity analysis (Fig 6) suggested that the dysregulation of the neurotrophin signaling pathway in patients affected by DMD might be mediated by Fas ligand (FASLG), a mediator of the cellular apoptotic signal that is a direct interactor of the dystrophin protein [46] . A link between Duchenne muscular dystrophy and FASLG has already been reported by Abdel-Salam et al. [47] , which observed significantly increased levels of FasLG mRNA expression in blood of DMD patients compared to controls. In addition to neurotrophin signaling, our analysis pointed out, among the FoxO-related subnetworks, an enrichment for the immune system signaling with FOXO4 identified as a regulator. The role of FoxO proteins in immune system has been already described [48] and interestingly, this process, together with hemostasis, another significant pathway in NASFinder analysis, is a key player in fibrosis, a prominent feature of dystrophic muscle [49] . It is thus conceivable that the dysregulation of blood proteins belonging to these pathways is a consequence of the fibrotic process ongoing in muscles of DMD patients. Notably, modulation of the immune response was suggested as a potential means to alleviate the disease intensity [50] . The other FoxO transcription factor with a pathway enriched sub-network was FOXO1. In this case two pathways resulted enriched: BioCarta acute myocardial infarction and KEGG pathways in cancer. While the presence of cardiac dysfunctions in subjects affected by DMD is common [51] , we consider the presence of enrichment in cancer pathways (also KEGG glioma in TP53 network resulted enriched) a consequence of the bias introduced by the high number of genes annotated in cancer pathways. Indeed, we noticed that most of the genes in cancer pathways also belong to other enriched gene sets (S3 Table) .",

This methodology allowed us to identify different pathways deregulated in the disease and to pinpoint a putative role of FoxO signaling in DMD. One limitation of this study is the lack of validation of the biomarker panel classification performance using a second independent cohort of subjects. To partially address this issue and avoid overfitting, we trained the algorithm that computed the biomarkers according to a 5-fold cross-validation scheme. We also used a second dataset of a very different nature (transcriptional profile of muscle from an unrelated cohort) to confirm the end results of our analysis and we obtained a substantial confirmation of the results. Another limitation of this study, as any form of in silico analysis, is that it relies entirely on observational data. Therefore, our results will have to be validated by means of functional studies. Despite these limitations, our workflow derives its strength from the convergence of multiple types of evidences from independent experiments, crossed with existing knowledge about the biology of the disease.",

Briefly, after a preliminary protein selection phase based on the Wilcoxon test, the classification method ranks the filtered proteins by expressions level separately for each sample and then it produces a set of subject-specific signatures, where each signature is the list of the first n1 and the last n2 proteins in the ranking (n1 and n2 have the same value for all subjects and they are parameters estimated by the method). An all-to-all signature comparison is then carried out using a distance metric based on a weighted enrichment score [52] , resulting in a distance matrix that systematically quantifies the degree of similarity between the subjects. Subjects are then classified by the algorithm into the two groups of controls and diseased, by assigning each sample to the group of subjects whose elements have the lowest averaged distance from the sample. Finally, a protein biomarker is extracted, which collects all the proteins included in at least one subject-specific signature. Therefore, the proteins included in a biomarker are those required to compute the corresponding subject classification.",

Briefly, the proteins in the biomarker panel are mapped to a reference protein-protein interaction network, that is, the human signaling network from the Wang Lab -http://www.cancer-systemsbiology.org/ dataandsoftware.htm. Then, the subnetwork connecting the proteins of interest, in our case the proteins in the biomarker panel, and the closest transcriptional factor (molecules selected as regulators) is defined. If a protein of interest is not present in the reference network it is added, if possible, from BioGRID [58] as detailed in [14] . The paths that connect transcription factors and biomarker proteins are established by NASFinder preferentially through differentially expressed proteins and they were identified in our study using the Bioconductor package limma. Specifically, proteins were selected as significant when they showed a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value less than 0.05 in the comparison between DMD subjects and controls. Once the subnetworks were identified, we evaluated their overlap with reference pathways from KEGG, Reactome, Biocarta and the hallmark collection in MSigDB, as in the gene-set enrichment analysis. The significance of the overlap was calculated using one-sided Fisher's exact test. The degree of overlap among the pathways identified by NASFinder was visualized using the Cytoscape App Enrichment Map v2.1.0 [59] , run using Cytoscape 3.4.0.

For all the pathways, all the shortest paths from DMD to the genes were calculated and the shortest path distance was defined as the minimal distance found. To assess the significance, we selected 1000 random genes and, for each of them, we calculated the minimal shortest distance to the pathway.
