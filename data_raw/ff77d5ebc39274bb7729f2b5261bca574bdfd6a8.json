The prevalence of HCoV-OC43 infection among these patients was assessed using two different OneStep reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. The epidemiological profiles of the patients with HCoV-OC43 infection were described. Partial S and N genes of HCoV-OC43 circulating strains were sequenced followed by phylogenetic analysis and amino acid alignment. Our results showed that the prevalence of HCoV-OC43 infection was 12.52% (95% CI: 9.78-15.26%), and the epidemic peak occurred in autumn. Fifty partial S and 40 partial N fragments were obtained from these patients. Phylogenetic analysis based on neighbour-joining method showed that at least three distinct clusters (A, B, C/D) of HCoV-OC43 strains were circulating among adult patients with ARI in Beijing. In addition, some novel unique clusters (UNT) of HCoV-OC43 were found in the S-and N-based phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, consensus amino acids substitutes for each cluster were also found after alignment of partial S or N sequence coding region in this study. In conclusion, we herein describe the prevalence of HCoV-OC43 among adult patients and provide substantial evidence for the genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 circulating in Beijing.",

HCoV-OC43 has a high frequency of mutation, using both base substitution and homologous RNA recombination [26, 27] . Among the structural viral proteins, the spike (S) protein is used for receptor binding and viral entry and has the most variable sequence within the coronavirus genome [24] [25] [26] [27] . S protein is cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2 [2] . The S1 gene has been reported to show the dominant genetic diversity or heterogeneity among circulating HCoV strains [24, 27] . The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) gene is another common target for serological assays [28, 29] . In view of the published data and the role of structural proteins, analysis of the S and N genes would be appropriate for determination of the genetic diversity of HCoV variants. In addition, the use of multiple primer sets targeting the S and N genes is recommended for diagnosis of all types of HCoV infection [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] .",

Molecular epidemiology and evolution studies of HCoV-OC43 have recently been conducted in some areas [22] [23] [24] [25] , and the data revealed at least three distinct clusters based on RdRp, S, and N genes and the emergence of a novel genotype, D, arising from natural recombination events between genotypes B and C [25] . However, the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 variants among adult patients with ARI in Beijing are not understood fully. To address these issues, this report includes investigation of the prevalence of HCoV-OC43 among 559 respiratory samples collected in Beijing as assessed using two RT-PCR assays targeting the S and N genes, respectively, followed by direct sequencing of PCR products and genetic diversity analysis of partial S and N genes of HCoV-OC43 variants. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients were also evaluated and their relationships with genetic diversity determined. This is the first report of the molecular prevalence and genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 variants among adult patients with ARI in Beijing.",

Screening of extracted viral RNA was conducted by OneStep RT-PCR. A 714-bp fragment (24, , 918 nt) of the S1 gene was generated using the forward primer 59-GAACTATGG-CATTTGGATACAGG-39 and the reverse primer 59-AT-GACTGCAAATAGCCCAAATT-39; A 749-bp fragment (29,967-30,716 nt) of the N gene was generated using the forward primer 59-GTAAGAGAGGCCCTAATCAGAA-39 and the reverse primer 59-CTTCATTCATTTACTAATTACTGG-39. The 25-mL reaction volume contained 4-mL RNA extract, 5-mL 56QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Buffer, 1-mL dNTP mix (for a final concentration of 400 mM of each dNTP), 1-mL each primer (final concentration, 10 mM each), 1-mL QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Enzyme Mix (which contained Omniscript and Sensiscript reverse transcriptases and HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase), and RNase-and DNase-free water. The reactions were carried out with an initial 30-min reverse transcription step at 50uC, followed by a 15-min PCR activation step at 95uC, 40 cycles of amplification (30 s at 94uC, 30 s at 55uC, 1 min at 72uC), and a final 10-min extension step at 72uC. All PCR products were run on agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and then visualised under UV light.

The partial S gene from 50 amplicons from Beijing patients were compared with those from porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and 19 reference strains of HCoV-OC43 found in GenBank ( Table S1 in File S1). The resulting phylogenetic tree revealed the existence of various virus clusters (left in Figure 1 ). Seven HCoV-OC43 strains from Beijing (LY1, LY82, LY84, XH1316, XH1327, XH1400, and XH1444) along with five reference strains from genotype A belonged to Cluster A. The OC43 (DQ355405) and OC43-BE03 (AY903459) strains of genotype B belonged to Cluster B. Genotypes C (HK04-01) and D (BE04 and HK04-02) were difficult to separate based on partial S gene sequences. Nineteen clinical isolates from Beijing patients formed a novel unique cluster and showed high similarity with isolates from Japan (AB695079) and France (DQ355408), which were named as UNT (C/D). Interestingly, two ATCC prototype strains (Z32768 and Z32769) and three English isolates (HC734573, CQ772300, and DD266155) of HCoV-OC43, which showed high similarity with BCoV (AF391542), formed a unique untyped cluster, which we termed untyped cluster I (UNT1). In addition, 20 HCoV-OC43 clinical isolates from Beijing ARI patients were phylogenetically distinct from the other major clusters and formed another unique cluster, which we termed as UNT (B). Forty partial N-based amplicons from Beijing ARI patients combined with those from eight reference strains of HCoV-OC43 generated four major phylogenetic clusters (right in Figure 1 ). Cluster A comprised only one clinical strain from Beijing patient (LY373) and four reference strains from genotype A. Two clinical strains from Beijing (LY254,LY321) and the reference strain of genotype B (BE03) formed Cluster B. Seventeen clinical strains from Beijing (LY241, 249, 262-267, 270-274, 277, 278, 308, 326),which formed unique subcluster (UNT) and showed significant divergence from the reference strain of genotype C (HK04-01) and D (BE04, HK04-02). The remaining reference or clinical strains from Beijing formed the major cluster, named as C/D.",

We analysed 559 nasopharyngeal swab samples, 70 (12.52%; 95% CI: 9.78-15.26%) of which tested positive for detection of HCoV-OC43, which is consistent with a previous report [34] [35] [36] 40] .

Interestingly, we are the first to describe three novel HCoV-OC43 clusters or subclusters based on phylogenetic analysis of partial S genes. The UNTI cluster comprised of 4 isolates from Germany and England showed high similarity with BCoV (AF391542); however, no UNTI strain was found in our patients from Beijing.

The analytic sensitivity of primers specific for different targets has been described previously [33, 35] . In the current study, we designed two sets of primers to amplify partial S and N gene sequences of HCoV-OC43 based on the bioinformatics literature. The detection limit for each assay was 10 copies/reaction and rate was not significantly different for the two RT-PCR assays (8.94 vs. 7.16%; p.0.05), but the HCoV-OC43 detection rate was enhanced significantly when the results from the two assays were combined (12.52%; 95% CI: 9.78-15.26%). This indicates that combining RT-PCR assays with different targets is advantageous for detection of HCoV-OC43 infection with increased sensitivity.",

Our data showed that there were at least five distinct clusters of HCoV-OC43 strains based on analysis of this partial S gene. We also constructed phylogenetic trees using the partial N sequence (spanning amino acids 288-448 of N), which represents the major diagnostic antigen and more conserved transcripts of the HCoV infection. We found that some of HCoV-OC43 isolates from our patients with ARI showed discrepancies between the S-and Nbased phylogenetic trees, which might indicate the emergence of natural recombination events, as suggested in previous reports [25] [26] [27] , since one unique feature of coronavirus replication is the high frequency of RNA recombination [25, [42] [43] [44] . RNA recombination is an important mechanism for the natural evolution of coronaviruses. The mean evolutionary rate of HCoV-OC43 was calculated to be 6.7610 24 and 3.6610 24 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for the S and N genes, respectively [24, 25] . Hence, it is easy to speculate that the appearance of a novel cluster of HCoV-OC43 strains in the current study was due to natural recombination events within the circulating HCoV-OC43 population in Beijing. To better understand the recombination and evolution of HCoV-OC43, future studies should take into account the complete genome sequences of clinical strains. That being said, the data presented here provide a better understanding of the evolution of HCoV-OC43 in different geographic areas and the role of selective pressures at different regions of the genome.",
