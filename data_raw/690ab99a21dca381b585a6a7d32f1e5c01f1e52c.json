These key parameters need to reflect both the pulmonary (e.g. tidal volume, airway pressure) and the cardiovascular (e.g. heart rate, blood pressure) consequences of MV as well as oxygenation and acid-base status. Although MV may affect all these parameters, these entities have rarely been assessed together in the same study in mice (Table 1) . Table 1 summarizes ventilation studies, in which either lung impedance was measured or ventilation was performed for at least four hours. The table reveals that many studies that have focused on lung mechanics examined only a relatively short period of ventilation [2] [3] [4] [5] and only one study fulfilled both inclusion criteria [6] . Interestingly, studies in which mice were ventilated for more than three hours often provided cardiovascular parameters, but neglected the examination of lung functions [7] [8] [9] [10] . Some studies even completely lacked physiological parameters, although in several cases the authors referred to preliminary experiments that were not included in the published data [11] [12] [13] [14] . We believe that, without comprehensive information on physiological parameters, it is difficult to properly assess, standardize and compare the various ventilation strategies.",

            "text": "Studies on the mechanisms of VILI have identified several beneficial ventilation strategies, among them low tidal volume (V T ) ventilation and application of recruitment manoeuvres (RM) as well as high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Although RM have a sound physiological basis, it remains unclear how they should be applied [15] . In principal, RM may be used to reopen atelectatic lung areas in injured lungs or to prevent atelectasis in healthy lungs. The latter application requires lower recruitment pressures and hence can be applied more frequently. Without RM, pulmonary compliance is likely to decrease as shown already many years ago in anesthetized dogs both during spontaneous breathing and during mechanical ventilation [16] . In addition, regular short recruitment manoeuvres have proved to be useful in models of isolated rat and mouse lungs [17, 18] . In mechanically ventilated mice the usefulness of RM with the specific aim to keep pulmonary compliance and other lung functions constant has been explored only sporadically. Previous RM studies in healthy mice have focused on short periods of ventilation and potential lung injury, but did not compare ventilation with and without RM over several hours [4, 5] . In addition, the effect of RM on blood pressure in mice is not well defined, although increased intrathoracic pressure might decrease cardiac output [19] . The beneficial effects of PEEP have been demonstrated in several animal studies [20] [21] [22] . PEEP helps to prevent repetitive alveolar collapse and preserves surfactant function [1, 23] . While it is widely accepted that adequate PEEP together with low V T is a protective ventilation strategy, the effects of recurrent RM in this setting are unknown.",

(2) We used this set of parameters to define ventilatory conditions that guarantee stable lung mechanics, hemodynamics, acid base status and oxygenation over six hours. In particular, we studied the input impedance of the lung at low frequencies to distinguish mechanical properties of conductive airways and the distal lung [24] . (3) We investigated the physiological effects of recurrent RM on lung mechanics at two different tidal volumes (8 vs. 16 mL/kg) and at two different PEEPlevels (2 vs. 6 cmH 2 O). (4) Since inflammatory lung injury may occur even with 'non-injurious' ventilation [7, 8, 25] , we also assessed the extent of pulmonary inflammation, i.e. microvascular permeability, pulmonary sequestration of leukocytes, production of proinflammatory cytokines and lung histopathology. Our findings in healthy animals show that low V T ventilation will only maintain lung functions and gas exchange in a normal range if recurrent RM are used. In addition, recurrent RM reduced the extent of pulmonary inflammation, although mild inflammation was present in the lungs of all ventilated animals. The higher PEEP of 6 cmH 2 O was beneficial regarding lung mechanics, oxygenation and pulmonary inflammation. Thus, we suggest that a preferable ventilation strategy is one that combines low tidal volumes with sizable PEEP and recurrent recruitment manoeuvres.",

The first series of experiments was performed at a PEEP = 2 cmH 2 O, a PEEP level that is commonly used in animal studies that aim to study VILI (see Table 1 ). Ventilation with 8 mL/kg and no RM (lowV T noRM) caused a continuous decrease of pulmonary compliance (C) over more than two hours that reached a plateau at approximately 30% of the physiological baseline value (Fig. 1 ). Within this time pulmonary resistance (R) nearly tripled. Resistance and compliance showed less dramatic trends in mice ventilated with 16 mL/kg and no RM (highV T noRM). In this group C plateaued earlier (60 min) at about 60% of the baseline value and R increased to a lesser degree (,25%). R and C differed significantly between the lowV T noRM and the highV T noRM group (R: p,0.01; C: p,0.001). Respiratory input impedance revealed major alterations in the periphery of the lung. Tissue damping (G) and tissue elastance (H) were elevated in both highV T noRM and lowV T noRM mice, reaching significantly higher values in the lowV T noRM group (G: p,0.01; H: p,0.001). In the latter group, airway resistance (R aw ) was increased as well. The increase in G, H and R aw indicates that low V T ventilation without RM leads to closure of peripheral areas of the lung and causes a small degree of airway constriction. In consequence, hysteresivity (G/H = g) decreased slightly over time, but was in a comparable range in all groups.",

Histopathological samples revealed that no severe lung injury was induced by the ventilation strategies applied (Fig. 7) . Nonetheless, significant histopathological alterations were present in all ventilated lungs and were most obvious in mice ventilated with high V T (Fig. 8) . Alveolar septal thickening was observed in most of the ventilated lungs, resulting in a score of one. A score of two was given, when neutrophils were observed additionally, as in most lungs from highV T mice. This is in line with the results from the differential cell count in the BAL fluid. Only some highV T noRM mice showed alveolar congestion, bringing the lung injury score up to three. Hyaline membranes were not observed in any sections, indicating that the applied ventilation strategies induced only moderate injury in the healthy lungs.",

In the second series of experiments the ventilation strategies RM5, noRM and RM60 were applied to mice ventilated with low V T and a PEEP of 6cmH 2 O, to find out whether the impairment of lung mechanics during ventilation with noRM and RM60 could be prevented by a higher PEEP (Fig. 9 ). Ventilation with RM5 at a PEEP of 6 cmH 2 O (PEEP6_RM5) showed stable lung functions. Ventilation without RM (PEEP6_noRM) resulted, notwithstanding the increased PEEP, in a strong decrease in C during the first 180 min of ventilation until a plateau was reached at about 30% of the initial C. Correspondingly R, G and H increased and finally doubled in this group. Also ventilation with RM60 (PEEP6_RM60) did not suffice to keep lung functions entirely stable at a PEEP of 6 cmH 2 O. Although the decrease in C between the RMs was relatively moderate, the initial C was not maintained over six hours. R, in contrast, returned to the initial value after each RM. In line with this, lung impedance measurements revealed a moderate increase in H, but not in G after six hours. All three groups differed significantly from each other regarding C, R, H and G, except from the parameters measured in the PEEP6_RM60 group directly after the RM. R aw and hysteresivity were not different between the groups and R aw remained at baseline in all experiments (data not shown).",

Clinically, it has been shown that low V T ventilation improves the outcome of patients with injured lungs [32] , and also reduces inflammation in those with healthy lungs [33] .

We initially selected a relatively low PEEP level, because we plan to use the same PEEP in future studies on the molecular mechanisms of VILI, where high PEEP levels are known to be protective (many VILI models use no PEEP at all). Since RMs can be performed with varying duration, peak pressure and end-expiratory pressure [34] , we chose a very short type of RM, which we considered to be noninjurious to the lung and not to impair cardiac output. Accordingly, blood pressure and heart frequency were stable, regardless of the ventilation strategy. Although blood pressure was in a low range due to anaesthesia with pentobarbital, so that small changes might have been masked, this did not result in reflex tachycardia or impairment of microcirculation, as the pH values indicate (Table 3) . These stable cardiovascular conditions were also guaranteed by several supportive measures such as constant fluid support (200 mL/h), regular administration of pentobarbital via an intraperitoneal catheter, and an automated system to keep the body temperature constant. Further, it can be speculated that the low blood pressure is protective in this model, since edema formation is generally aggravated by high blood pressure.",

The supplementation of 3% CO 2 to the inhaled gas mixture in the high V T groups was adequate to prevent hypocapnia, which otherwise would have occurred at a respiratory rate of 90 min 21 in the highV T RM5 group. 3% CO 2 alone did not induce hypercapnia (see Table 3 ).

In accordance with previous studies [4, 5] RM with 25 cmH 2 O peak pressure were not sufficient to avoid a loss of lung volume (data not shown). The double sigmoidal nature of the murine pressure volume curve [38] may explain the positive response to RM with 30 cmH 2 O pressure. According to Zosky et al. [38] , pressures above 20 cmH 2 O induce fundamental changes in the murine lung, resulting in increased compliance. These changes are proposed to be either due to reopening of collapsed alveoli or to a secondary population of alveoli that are present but not aerated below a critical transrespiratory pressure [39] . In the present study, measurement of lung input impedance revealed that the alterations in pulmonary resistance and compliance in RM60 and noRM mice were predominantly due to changes in the periphery of the lung. Although we observed significant differences in R aw between RM5, RM60 and noRM mice ventilated at the same V T , this effect was rather small, indicating that bronchoconstriction of large airways is of minor importance to explain our findings. The strong increase in G and H in mice ventilated without RM demonstrates a progressive loss in lung volume [24] . Increases in tissue damping reflect energy dissipation and are associated with an increase in tissue resistance and/or regional heterogeneity as result of peripheral airway constriction, whereas tissue elastance reflects energy storage in lung tissues and represents lung stiffness [5] . The small decrease in hysteresivity shows that H increased slightly stronger than G. Further, it underlines that impaired lung functions were not primarily due to heterogeneity caused by narrowing of small airways [40] . Thus narrowing of conductive airways played only a minor role in this model and we conclude that the loss of lung volume was mainly due to formation of atelectasis.",

This supports the hypothesis that depending on the pressure applied to the lung some populations of alveoli are open and others closed [38] . The minimal lung volumes in the plateau phase differed according to the employed tidal volume, leading to the highest tissue resistance and elastance values in the lowV T noRM group. Formation of atelectasis was more severe in low V T than in high V T ventilation, as shown elsewhere [3, 4] , indicating that low V T ventilation without RM was injurious. These findings are in line with a previous work showing that low V T ventilation augmented lung injury in isolated rat lungs, proposing that the degree of lung injury is dependent on the end-expiratory lung volume [41] . Ventilation with high V T resulted in a higher compliance and thereby to some degree protected from the decline in lung volume. However, the application of one RM per hour was not sufficient to keep tissue resistance and elastance entirely stable over six hours, demonstrating that the beneficial effect of recruitment is transient and formation of atelectasis is reversible only to a certain point. The present data emphasize the importance of frequent deep inflations in mice in order to maintain lung functions in a physiological range.",

The present study demonstrates that impairment of gas exchange, to a level that would fulfil the clinical definition for ARDS [42] , can be caused by a ventilation strategy that leads to derecruitment of lung volume. On the other hand, our data on lung histopathology, neutrophil count and BAL levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines indicate that inflammatory lung injury was not severe even in the lowV T noRM group. Notably, neutrophil counts and histopathological alterations ( Fig. 6-8 ) did not correlate well with gas exchange and lung functions, further supporting our conclusion that atelectasis rather than inflammation was the major reason for the impaired gas exchange in the groups ventilated without sufficient RM. In fact, neutrophil infiltration was highest in the high V T groups, suggesting ventilation-induced inflammation (biotrauma) as a mechanism.",

Collapse of lung units is accompanied by an increase in vascular filtration pressure, leading to edema formation, when vascular barrier functions are impaired [43] . This is in line with the observed alveolar septal thickening. Furthermore, microvascular leakage may also interfere with pulmonary surfactant, thus contributing to a reduction of compliance [44] , which was clearly present in this model. Finally, in atelectatic lungs shear forces between closed and open alveoli may develop [1] . Taken together we conclude that a lack of recruitment manoeuvres may cause what has been termed atelectotrauma.",

            "text": "The present study demonstrates that repetitive recruitment manoeuvres are not only beneficial for lung functions, gas exchange and barrier function, but also reduce the liberation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 5) . This is an important finding, because in theory frequent deep inspirations might be a trigger for stretch-induced pro-inflammatory mediator release. IL-6 and KC were increased in the BAL and blood serum of all ventilated mice and it appears that ventilation will always cause mild inflammation in the lungs, both experimentally [7, 8, 25] and clinically [45, 46] . The underlying mechanisms may be related to the surgery or mechanotransductive processes, i.e. stretchactivation of signalling cascades, or to increased vascular shear stress in those groups ventilated with higher positive pressures [47] . IL-6 and KC were significantly lower in the BAL fluid of lowV T RM5 mice compared to all other groups, demonstrating that this ventilation strategy was the most protective one. It is well-established that protective ventilation, minimizing overdistension and recruitment/derecruitment of the lung, attenuates cytokine liberation in the lung and circulation [48] . Interestingly, the blood serum of both V T groups ventilated with RM5 contained significantly lower levels of IL-6 and KC than the corresponding groups ventilated with RM60 or noRM. This shows that the RM5 procedure was also protective at higher tidal volumes. The high levels of IL-6 and KC in the BAL of highV T RM5 mice indicate that the inflammatory response was initiated in the lung. Notably, neither levels of IP-10 nor of TNFa -two cytokines that are frequently found in severe forms of acute lung injury -were altered significantly in ventilated mice, compared to unventilated controls. The relatively high baseline values for TNF-a in unventilated mice are most likely due to the fact that BAL samples had to be diluted on order to gain enough volume for the assay. Concentrations were calculated by multiplication with the dilution factor, possibly leading to higher concentrations than actually present in the BAL. Nevertheless, all groups were analyzed at the same time and cytokine levels were in the same range in all groups, allowing a comparison. IP-10 is proposed to play a role in development of ARDS and is further considered as a useful biomarker for lung disease [49, 50] . TNF-a is considered as a mediator of pulmonary inflammation released by injurious ventilation [51, 52] . The finding that these mediators remained unaltered by ventilation further suggests that lung injury was only moderate in the current model. This study aimed to define settings for ventilation under stable conditions and therefore a second set of experiments was performed with a PEEP of 6 cmH 2 O, to address the question whether a higher PEEP could prevent the severe impairment of lung functions and the effects on oxygenation and inflammation, which were observed in the lowV T noRM and lowV T RM60 groups ventilated with a PEEP of 2 cmH 2 O. Lung mechanics and blood gas results revealed that a higher PEEP, even when combined with RM60, was not sufficient to prevent formation of atelectasis. C decreased and R, G and H increased strongly during the first 180 min of the experiments in the PEEP6_noRM group before parameters reached a plateau. A previous study demonstrated that an increase in PEEP from 2 cmH 2 O to 6 cmH 2 O alone did not prevent an increase in R aw , G and H during 150 min of ventilation, but was more effective during pressure controlled RM [5] . The present study shows that a combination of higher PEEP and short RM every 60 minutes does not suffice to prevent impairment of lung functions and that frequent RM are required, as with a PEEP of 2 cmH 2 O. Of note, the increase in R aw , which was observed in the groups lowV T noRM and lowV T RM60 ventilated with a PEEP = 2 cmH 2 O, was completely abolished in all groups ventilated with a PEEP = 6 cmH 2 O, indicating that a higher PEEP helps to prevent narrowing of large airways during MV.",

The second part of this work showed that differences in cytokine levels between mice ventilated with the same RM strategies were smaller with 6 cmH 2 O than with 2 cmH 2 O PEEP. IL-6 serum levels were even in a comparable range in all PEEP6 groups. Interestingly, the highest IL-6 and KC BAL levels were detected in the PEEP6_noRM group.
