            "text": "The AsiaFluCap Simulator is a combination of a disease model and a resource model. The resource model uses the pandemic scenario estimations from the disease model to calculate resource needs (see Additional file 4). As disease model, we adopted an existing SEIR model structure which was developed earlier, as part of the AsiaFluCap project, by Krumkamp and colleagues (2011) [1] . The disease model consists of a relatively simple SEIR structure assuming homogenously mixing patterns within a closed population. We chose to use a non-age-structured model as our main purpose of the AsiaFluCap Simulator was to demonstrate relative differences in resources needs during different pandemic scenarios, and not provide accurate quantitative predictions (e.g. development a tool for policy makers that provides a first approximation to the problem of illustrating the impact of limited resources on pandemic outcomes). Moreover, age-specific incidences and susceptibility to infection of future pandemics are not predictable, and an age-structured resource model would greatly increase data demands for the simulator. Such age-stratified data on resource utilisation and effectiveness are currently scarce.",

The severe pandemic scenario was based on the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 parameter values, assuming a person-to-person transmission rate similar to human viruses. The moderate scenario was defined by an average of the mild and severe parameter values. Distinction between these three scenarios consists of differences in the proportions of mild and critical cases; the proportion of critical cases requiring ventilation, and proportion of critical cases dying from influenza related illness. For users with modelling experience the three pandemic scenarios can be easily changed (e.g. updated with the latest literature values) by unhiding the 'SEIR model' Excel sheet (In this sheet all disease parameter values are displayed) in the AsiaFluCap Simulator.
