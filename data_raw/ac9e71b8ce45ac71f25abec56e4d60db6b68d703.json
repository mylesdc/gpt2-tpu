            "text": "Avian gastrointestinal (GI) tracts are highly populated with a diverse array of microorganisms that share a symbiotic relationship with their hosts and contribute to the overall health and disease state of the intestinal tract. The microbiome of the young chick is easily prone to alteration in its composition by both exogenous and endogenous factors, especially during the early posthatch period. The genetic background of the host and exposure to pathogens can impact the diversity of the microbial profile that consequently contributes to the disease progression in the host. The objective of this study was to profile the composition and structure of the gut microbiota in young chickens from two genetically distinct highly inbred lines. Furthermore, the effect of the Salmonella Enteritidis infection on altering the composition makeup of the chicken microbiome was evaluated through the 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis. One-day-old layer chicks were challenged with S. Enteritidis and the host cecal microbiota profile as well as the degree of susceptibility to Salmonella infection was examined at 2 and 7 days post infection. Our result indicated that host genotype had a limited effect on resistance to S. Enteritidis infection. Alpha diversity, beta diversity, and overall microbiota composition were analyzed for four factors: host genotype, age, treatment, and postinfection time points. S. Enteritidis infection in young chicks was found to significantly reduce the overall diversity of the microbiota population with expansion of Enterobacteriaceae family. These changes indicated that Salmonella colonization in the GI tract of the chickens has a direct effect on altering the natural development of the GI microbiota. The impact of S. Enteritidis infection on microbial communities was also more substantial in the late stage of infection. Significant inverse correlation between Enterobacteriaceae and Lachnospiraceae family in both non-infected and infected groups, suggested possible antagonistic interaction between members of these two taxa, which could potentially influences the overall microbial population in the gut. Our results also revealed that genetic difference between two lines had minimal effect on the establishment of microbiota population. Overall, this study provided preliminary insights into the contributing role of S. Enteritidis in influencing the overall makeup of chicken's gut microbiota.",

Development of the GI microbiota in chickens occurs immediately after hatching and is influenced by both genetic and external factors like diet and environment (1) . Unlike other animals, a newly hatched chick does not have acquired healthy maternal microbiota as they are housed separately from the adult hens immediately after hatch in commercial production (2) . Therefore, the GI tract of newly hatched chickens is usually sterile and presents an empty ecological niche that provides easy access for the pathogen to colonize with limited restriction (2) . This factor alone makes young chickens highly susceptible to enteric bacterial infections, such as Salmonella, which can result in different degrees of disease spectrum from a subclinical carrier state to a high mortality rate depending on the infecting bacterial serovar and host's susceptibility.",

Consumption of contaminated eggs produced by infected layer hens is one of the leading causes of Salmonella food poisoning in humans (4) . In chickens, S. Enteritidis can be easily transmitted horizontally via the fecal-oral route as well as vertically via the reproductive tract, which can contaminate the egg (5) . Additionally, chickens can also harbor S. Enteritidis asymptomatically and persist throughout their lifespan, which makes the identification of infected chickens and the eradication of the pathogen much more challenging. Young chickens can be exposed to S. Enteritidis through numerous external sources like contaminated feed or environment. The sterile GI tract of the newly hatched chickens also provides ample opportunities for a pathogenic organism like S. Enteritidis to firmly establish its own niche in the gut as early colonizer and potentially further impact the development of the gut microbiota during the disease state. Early exposure to Salmonella in young chick could result in two potential alternative outcomes: high mortality rate or persistence of infection in surviving chickens (6) . Prolonged persistent infection with S. Enteritidis in the GI tract of chickens throughout their lifespan could alter the development of gut microbiota and have detrimental effect on the overall gut health of the chicken host.",

A study by Cotter et al. had previously examined the association of B-complex immunity to S. Enteritidis using 12 congenic lines from UCD, differing in various Bcomplex haplotypes (13) . Results from the study had suggested that chickens from UCD254 (B 15 /B 15 ) were more susceptible to Salmonella infection compared to other lines in term of mortality and morbidity (13) .

A cloaca swab was performed to ensure all birds were Salmonella-free. The chickens were then transferred and housed in the temperature-controlled chambers with ad libitum access to water and commercial feed without antibiotic treatment. At 1 day of age, chickens were orally inoculated with 1 \u00d7 10 8 c.f.u of S. Enteritidis TN2 nalidixic acid-resistant strain (kindly provided by Dr. Andreas Baumler) or PBS for the non-infected birds. Dosage of S. Enteritidis was confirmed by serial dilution plating of the inoculum. A total of three replicate trials were conducted. For the duration of the trials, all non-infected chickens were housed together in the concrete floor pen with fresh, wood shaving for bedding material inside the environmental chamber. The infected group of chickens was housed separately in another chamber with the same environmental conditions as the control chamber. At 2 and 7 days postinoculation (DPI), chickens were euthanized by the carbon dioxide asphyxiation to collect spleen and cecal content for further analysis. Similarly, the organs from the same-age counterpart in non-infected group of 3 days old (3 D) and 8 days old (8 D) were also collected. All animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the UCD.",

Alpha diversity metrics analysis includes Chao1 index (richness estimate), Shannon's diversity, and Simpson's diversity index. Chao1 richness estimates the total number of species present in the community. The difference between the Shannon and Simpson indices is that the weights of abundant species are accounted differently. Both the abundance and evenness in distribution of species present in the community is included in Shannon index analysis, while only the abundance of species is considered in Simpson indices (24) . Microbial community dominated by a few species is considered to exhibit low evenness, while the community where the species abundances are distributed equally within the community are considered as balance community. Rarefaction curve was constructed based on the observed number of OTUs as function of number of sequences analyzed with QIIME to compare between non-infected and infected groups. Estimates of beta diversity were made using both unweighted UniFrac and weighted UniFrac (25) followed by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) in QIIME to characterize the microbial population diversity. To analyze the relative abundance of the microbial members at the family level, we identified eight major family groups that adhered to two conditions: classified OTU and population density detectable at more than 2% of the total community in all samples. For OTUs that were unclassified or in low abundances (below 2%), were binned together in others/unknown category. The results from the QIIME were further analyzed with linear discriminate analysis effect size (LEfSe) (26) . Then Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used to identify significantly differential abundance of the microbiota community between the comparison groups. Differentially distributed microbiome taxa were identified based on Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) that generated LEfSe cladograms for the each category comparison. Cladograms that had statistically significant taxonomic differences between the groups were identified. Significant alpha values of 0.05 and effect size threshold of 2 were used in the LEfSe analysis.",

In addition, the host genotype is another important factor in affecting the composition of the gut microbiota (7, 9, 11) . Early encounter with diverse enteric pathogens present in the environment during posthatch period also poses great risk for newly hatched chicks. This early host-pathogen interaction could potentially impact the further colonization of other microbes and shape the overall structure of gut microbiota.

On the other hand, another study by the Bumstead and Barrow (12) stated that there was no evidence to support strong association of MHC haplotypes with resistance to Salmonella typhimurium in newly hatched chicks. Our findings in the current study indicated that MHC haplotype had significant effects only on early stage of systemic infection of S.

The early inoculum challenged to young chickens in this study could be a possible driving force in potentially rendering the microbiota composition of chickens of late stage. Without pathogen infection, microbiota diversity and complexity often increase with age of the chick (28, 29) . Temporal changes in the chicken gut microbiota with aging could have important consequences on susceptibility to pathogen infection. The use of very young chickens as infection model is important for the current study as chickens are often exposed to Salmonella at very young age in natural setting. However, the immaturity of the immune system as well as non-establishment of complex microbiota in young chickens could have a significant effect on the outcome of the infection (30). Beaumont et al. (31) showed that increased resistance to Salmonella at adult chickens was negatively correlated to genetic resistance at the young age. Therefore, MHC haplotype effect on microbiota profile could be different by the use of different age infection model. Although it is beyond the scope of the current study, challenging at 2 weeks of age instead of 1-day-old chicks could provide additional insights of host genetic background impact on microflora composition and warranted further investigation.",

Temporal fluctuation in the microbial community structure at the family level was observed as chick aged (from 3 to 8 D). Enterobacteriaceae family was significantly enriched in younger chickens, while Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families were more abundant with a reduction in Enterobacteriaceae family in older chickens. The overall bacterial diversity in early life stage of chick host (both age groups) in the current study was low with a few members predominantly occupying the GI tract, which was in agreement with other studies (28, 29) . Similar to another study, the non-infected chickens at 3 days old had high abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (32) . Members of the Enterobacteriaceae family including bacterial pathogens like Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Shigella are known enteric pathogens in the GI tract. Harboring high level of Enterobacteriaceae in young chickens could potentially increase their susceptibility to infection by related enteric pathogens. Indeed, studies in mouse model have shown that increased susceptibility to related enteric pathogen infections were observed in host whose microbiota composition was dominated by the presence of E. coli belonging to Enterobacteriaceae family (33, 34) . The concept of \"like will to like\" was proposed by the Stecher et al. to help explain the bloom of closely related bacterial species in the GI tract that result in dysbiosis of microbiota in the disease host (33) . It had been suggested that high prevalence of certain bacterial species in the microbiota community could alter the conditions within the gut that selectively confer the fitness advantage upon other related species within the same phylogenetic group (35, 36) . We speculate that early colonization by members of Enterobacteriaceae family in GI tract of the newly hatched chickens could potentially precondition the intestinal tract of the chick host to allow easy colonization by enteric pathogens. Thus, depletion of certain bacteria taxa from Enterobacteriaceae family during the early posthatch period could potentially enhance the host resistance to enteric pathogen infection. This may be how growth promoters work in poultry feed as antibiotics in the growth promoters can eliminate certain members of Enterobacteriaceae family.",

Enteritidis is established within the niche of the GI tract, pathogen-associated alteration in microbial community structure occurred (37) (38) (39) . Our results revealed that S. Enteritidis infection resulted in significant reduction in bacterial diversity specifically at early postinfection period. Reduction in bacterial diversity in the infected birds was partially attributed by the presence of the Enterobacteriaceae family that dominated the microbial community. Major phylum shift was observed in infected group at 2 DPI where there was expansion of Proteobacteria with concomitant reduction in Firmicutes phyla. This sudden shift in microbial population structure due to S. Enteritidis infection changed the ratio of two major phyla groups, which is the hallmark indicator of intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in disease host (40, 41) . Salmonella associated alteration of the gut microbiota could be a result of either pathogen-commensal microbiota interaction or host mucosal immune response to the pathogen or even a combination of both (38) . Host-mediated inflammation response triggered by the presence of the pathogen could also change the conditions within the GI tract to favor and support the growth of specific member of the microorganisms. Studies in mouse colitis models have showed that inflammation allow facultative anaerobes like Salmonella or other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family to utilize anaerobic respiration as alternative growth pathway to gain competitive advantage over resident microbes that are mostly obligate anaerobe (34, 38, 40, (42) (43) (44) . The underlying mechanism that is driving the bloom of Proteobacteria phylum in chick host following Salmonella infection is not yet known. Whether similar route of respiration pathway is being utilized by Salmonella to gain growth advantage in inflamed chicken gut is the hypothesis that we are currently investigating.",

However, as time progresses with S. Enteritidis infection, a significant difference in community structure between the two groups was apparent, with clear separation in the group's clustering pattern on PCoA plots (8 D vs. 7 DPI). This result suggests that the impact of S. Enteritidis infection on microbial communities was more substantial in late stage than in early stage. A study by Videnska et al. (45) found that members of the families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae are predominantly present in the 2-week-old laying chickens, and likely play an important role in the overall development of the gut microbial community. Further analysis at the family level found that two core members of the gut microbiota belonging to Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families were significantly reduced in the infected groups. Our findings suggested that with S. Enteritidis infection, selective reduction of these bacterial genera could negatively impact gut microbial diversity and development. Although long-term impact of S. Enteritidis infection on microbiome development in adult chickens was not possible to be evaluated in the current study, further investigation in this regard could provide important insights on it.",

In addition, the abundance of members belonging to Lachnospiraceae family was significantly decreased with S. Enteritidis infection. Contrary to our findings, Videnska et al. (37) observed only minor modification in chicken gut microbiota with no significant changes in Lachnospiraceae family following S. Enteritidis infection. The discrepancies observed between this study and our findings may be attributed to different age of infection model, samples collected on different days of postinfection and different genetic background of chickens. Lachnospiraceae as well as another family, Ruminococcaceae, that also show significant reduction in the infected group, belong to the Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa (45) . Members of these groups generate butyric acid, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that are produced as end products of fermentation of carbohydrate by anaerobic intestinal microbes. There is complex interplay between diet, SCFAs concentration, and microbiota composition that regulate the colonization level of members of the Proteobacteria phylum (36, 46) . Depending on the type of SCFAs being produced and its concentration level in the gut, it can affect different members of microbial community in a different way. Specifically for Salmonella, high concentration of acetate production was found to increase the invasion gene expression of Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI1) (47) . High concentration level of butyric acid, on the other hand, down-regulated the SPI1 gene expression level, which can reduce invasion capability of bacteria in the host (48) . In the poultry industry, addition of butyric acid in feed has been shown to reduce both colonization and shedding of Salmonella in chickens (49, 50) . Taken together, reduction in butyric acid producing bacteria such as Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families with S. Enteritidis infection may implied that both producers and its products may have a potential protective role in providing colonization resistance against Salmonella infection or reducing the members of Enterobacteriaceae family in gut microbiota to maintain homeostasis. A novel Salmonella preventive strategies that implement combined approach of competitive exclusion bacteria with SCFAs should be explored to eliminate enteric pathogens and improve overall gut health of the chicken host.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our findings indicated that early exposure in young chickens to Salmonella influences and shape the overall microbiota composition. Microbial diversity was significantly reduced in S. Enteritidis-infected host compared to same-age noninfected group. Overall perturbation of microbiota community was found to be associated with expansion of Enterobacteriaceae family at early postinfection period. Decrease in butyrate producing bacteria belonging to Lachnospiraceae family was found to have a negative correlation with high prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae family, suggesting possible competitive interaction between the two bacterial taxa in the gut. Additionally, increased susceptibility to Salmonella infection in young chickens could be contributed by highly relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae family in the gut. Predominance of this bacterial taxa could potentially confer competitive growth advantage upon its related species over resident microbiota during enteric infection via altering the environmental conditions of the GI tract of the host, which further promote the imbalance state of the young chick's gut microbiota. This study provided a preliminary insight into the contributing role of early host-pathogen interaction that influences the composition makeup of gut microbiota.",
