Healthcare utilization patterns will affect the generalizability of data from sentinel sites and the potential to use them to estimate burden of disease. The objective of this study was to measure healthcare utilization patterns in Guatemala to inform the establishment of a sentinel surveillance system for influenza and other respiratory infections, and allow estimation of disease burden. Methods: We used a stratified, two-stage cluster survey sample to select 1200 households from the Department of Santa Rosa. Trained interviewers screened household residents for self-reported pneumonia in the last year and influenza-like illness (ILI) in the last month and asked about healthcare utilization for each illness episode. Results: We surveyed 1131 (94%) households and 5449 residents between October and December 2006 and identified 323 (6%) cases of pneumonia and 628 (13%) cases of ILI. Treatment for pneumonia outside the home was sought by 92% of the children <5 years old and 73% of the persons aged five years and older. For both children <5 years old (53%) and persons aged five years and older (31%) who reported pneumonia, private clinics were the most frequently reported source of care. For ILI, treatment was sought outside the home by 81% of children <5 years old and 65% of persons aged five years and older. Government ambulatory clinics were the most frequently sought source of care for ILI both for children <5 years old (41%) and persons aged five years and older (36%). Conclusions: Sentinel surveillance for influenza and other respiratory infections based in government health facilities in Guatemala will significantly underestimate the burden of disease. Adjustment for healthcare utilization practices will permit more accurate estimation of the incidence of influenza and other respiratory pathogens in the community.",

[1, 2] At the 58 th World Assembly in 2005, The World Health Organization adopted a resolution calling for Member States to fortify and coordinate national strategies to prepare for an influenza pandemic, including establishment of surveillance systems for human influenza. [3] To assist with the development of standardized influenza surveillance systems in the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a generic protocol for influenza surveillance incorporating two sentinel surveillance systems, one hospital-based system for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and SARI-related mortality and another for influenza-like illness (ILI) based in ambulatory clinics. [4] Sentinel surveillance for influenza can provide information on trends in viral circulation patterns and seasonality, along with virus characteristics to help guide decisions on vaccine composition. However, healthcare seeking behaviors can affect who accesses care at the sentinel site, limiting the ability to gather information to guide public health policies. Without understanding patterns of healthcare seeking behavior, it is not possible to calculate the burden of disease, generalize findings to a larger population or identify risk groups.",

Guatemala is divided into 22 departments, which are further subdivided into 10-29 municipios (similar to counties), made up of multiple communities. The Guatemalan Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (MSPAS) provides free healthcare in several different settings, including hospitals, health centers, health posts, and outreach centers. Hospitals and health centers are staffed by physicians and nurses, whereas health posts are staffed by nurses. Outreach centers provide preventive and primary healthcare but are only visited by trained medical staff a few days each month. In addition to the MSPAS facilities, formally-employed workers who contribute to the Guatemalan Institute of Social Security (IGSS) can receive healthcare from IGSS hospitals and health centers, which are concentrated in Guatemala City. Other non-governmental locations where people may seek healthcare are private hospitals and clinics, pharmacies, drug shops, and traditional healers and midwives. Communities in Guatemala vary in their access to healthcare depending on their size and location (e.g., urban vs. rural).",

In contrast to the country as a whole, which is almost half Amerindian indigenous, only 3% of Santa Rosa's residents are Mayan or Xinca, and Spanish is spoken by approximately 91% of the inhabitants. The mortality rate of children <5 years of age for Santa Rosa is 58 per 1000 live births, significantly higher than the average for the country (45 per 1000 live births).

There is one IGGS facility that treats only patients involved in motor vehicle accidents. Two small private hospitals as well as approximately 133 private ambulatory clinics are available for those who choose to pay for healthcare.

Socioeconomic status (SES) was estimated using a wealth index generated using the factor effects derived from the first principle component of a principle component analysis of household goods, house construction material, source of water supply, source of cooking fuel and sanitation facility; the wealth index was categorized into quintiles with households weighted by number of residents and sample weights. [16, 17] To account for the complex survey design, sample weights were applied in all analyses. We used the Wald Chi-square statistic to test for differences between proportions and logistic regression to test for trends related to age and SES. Analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) using PROC SURVEYFREQ or PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC.",

These findings suggest that in Santa Rosa, sentinel surveillance for pneumonia in government hospitals will significantly underestimate the burden of disease, by up to 75% for children <5 years old and 88% for persons aged five years and older.

We used a case definition that required self-report or report by a proxy of an illness that occurred up to one year prior to interview. It is well known that such self-reports are limited by recall decay, and recent episodes are more likely to be recalled than earlier episodes. [21] This could be noted in our data that demonstrated a decreasing report of pneumonia with increasing time before the survey. As long as recent illness episodes do not differ from prior episodes with regard to patterns of healthcare-seeking behaviors, there is no reason to believe that recall decay causes bias with regard to these variables. Because our case definition is based on self-report, there is substantial potential for misclassification, especially between mild and severe acute respiratory illness, and this can be seen in the report of some lower respiratory tract symptoms among respondents with ILI. However, the behaviors associated with episodes of ILI compared to pneumonia (lower probability of seeking care outside the home, less likely to seek treatment at a hospital) are suggestive of a more mild illness and we are reasonably confident that we have described the healthcare seeking behaviors that are broadly associated with both pneumonia and ILI. An additional limitation is our sample size, which is too small to permit age to be stratified into more than two groups, restricting our ability to model healthcare-seeking behaviors more precisely by smaller age groups. Finally, it is not clear whether results from one area of Guatemala with a significantly lower indigenous population than the rest of the country can be generalized to the nation as a whole.",
