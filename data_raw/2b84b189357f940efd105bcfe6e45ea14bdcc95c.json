[12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] These issues led to the formation in 2010 of the Consortium for the Standardization of Influenza Seroepidemiology (CONSISE). 19 CONSISE is comprised of international scientists experienced in conducting seroepidemiologic studies of influenza and other emerging respiratory viruses; two working groups on epidemiology and laboratory matters were formed to provide tools to help standardize protocols and laboratory methods used (see https://consise.tghn.org/ about/working-group-projects/). The overarching goal of CONSISE is to improve the quality of data arising from influenza seroepidemiologic studies, harmonize methods used in such studies, and thereby provide better evidence for policy makers that guides rational implementation of intervention and control measures. 19 Guidelines for the reporting of the design, conduct, and results of research have been an effective tool for improving the quality and interpretability of published data. Examples include the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE). 20, 21 These guidelines have become, in some instances, widely accepted standards for reporting of research studies, and the expectation that publications should meet these standards has helped to improve the design and conduct of studies. CONSISE has prepared the following statement, Reporting Of Sero-Epidemiologic Studies for Influenza (ROSES-I), which distills the experience of the working groups into a set of recommendations on the optimal reporting of influenza seroepidemiologic studies.",

A common convention, which is acceptable, is to consider a result below the limit of detection as a serial step below that limit; that is, if the starting antibody dilution is 10, then a value of <10 can be reported as a five for the purposes of data analysis rather than a zero or a \"not ",

During later stages of epidemics, or following epidemics, serologic testing can permit estimation of the number of infections that have occurred among the general population, which is important for determining important epidemiologic parameters, including the pathogen's transmissibility, the proportion of the population that remains susceptible to infection in subsequent epidemics, and the risk of severe disease or death conditional on infection. In the last decade, over 8000 studies have been published that are indexed with the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) term \"Seroepidemiologic Studies.\" Approximately 500 studies of these are indexed with MeSH terms \"Seroepidemiologic Studies\" AND \"influenza.\" The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic is an excellent example of how a variety of seroepidemiologic studies provided vital information to supplement what was available from clinical and laboratory surveillance data. 2-4 Severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was initially overestimated from the reports of high risks of severe disease among critically ill patients in adult intensive care units in Mexico City and Winnipeg. 5,6 However, inconsistencies in the reporting and standardization of both survey and laboratory methods have limited the comparability of results of 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza seroepidemiologic studies. 7,8 Debate has also arisen around the interpretation of seroepidemiologic studies of avian influenza A virus (AIV) infections",

The introduction should provide background information justifying the choice of antibody detection assay and thresholds for specific antibody titer or changes in antibody titer, which may be indicative of prior or recent infection [ROSES-I 2.1 and 2.2]. Depending on their design, seroepidemiologic studies can provide data on a variety of measures of the frequency of an outcome in the study population. For example, cross-sectional seroepidemiologic studies provide estimates of the point prevalence of different titers of antibodies, which are used as markers of prior infection (or vaccination) and may indicate the current level of antibody-mediated protection against infection with antigenically similar viruses if protective thresholds or correlates of protection have been established. The wording \"seroprevalence at an antibody titer of \u2026.\" is preferred to \"infection,\" because antibody titers are dynamic, initially rising and then generally declining during variable periods after infection, and therefore, different assumptions underlie inferences about prior infection from antibody concentrations. Serological testing of paired serum specimens provides estimates of the cumulative incidence of virus infection (or incidence proportion",

Inferences about the probability of prior or recent virus infection based on the titer of antibody in a single serum sample, or changes in the titer of antibody in sequential serum samples, are based upon assumptions about the kinetics of antibody titers following virus infection. In order for readers to assess or test the validity of the assumed relationship, it is important that details are provided of the actual or likely period of exposure(s) to the circulating virus strain and infection risk in relation to the time point that the serum samples are taken [ROSES-I 5.1-5.3].For example, an overly short (<14 days) or overly long (>6 months) interval between exposure(s) and serum sampling will increase the probability of uninterpretable results because antibody titers may not yet have reached a maximum titer, or may have decayed below the seroprevalence or seroconversion titer detection thresholds set to define infection retrospectively.",

For studies of virus infection transmission risk in households or closed settings, or for outbreak investigations, the definition of the setting being studied (e.g., how a household was defined) should be described in order to permit comparison with other similar studies [ROSES-I 6.2-6.3]. The results of seroepidemiologic studies among humans of antibodies to novel avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have sometimes been challenging to interpret, because it is difficult to distinguish the detection of low titers of virus-specific antibodies from the detection of low titers of cross-reactive antibodies. As such, seroepidemiologic surveys of novel AIVs should ideally compare the seroprevalence in exposed populations to the seroprevalence in populations who have likely not been exposed to the animal reservoir or to sick human case patients, and should report the efforts to validate the assay in virologically confirmed cases [ROSES-I 6.4].11,15,26 Variables, data sources, and biasAge is an important determinant of serologic responses to virus infection, and therefore, it is critical that the median and range of the age of participants, overall and by subgroup (study subjects and control population; the control group should have a similar median age andage range to the study group.), should be reported (ROSES-I 7.1). For influenza, antibody may be present as a result of immunization. It is therefore essential that where a vaccine exists, details are provided of the vaccine(s) used in the study population, when vaccination was administered in relation to the timing of sample collection during the investigation [ROSES-I 7.2], the methods used to identify and record vaccination history [ROSES-I 8.1], as well as statistical methods used to control for the potential effect of immunization [ROSES-I 9.1]. When no data are available on vaccination in the study population or the general population from which the study participants were chosen, this should be stated clearly along with any anecdotal information as to the presence or absence of vaccination during the period of study. When pathogens share similar antigenic epitopes, antibody assays may detect cross-reactivity to more than one pathogen. For example, antibodies that cross-reacted with the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus were detected in serum samples collected prior to the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. These cross-reactive antibodies were typically found in older people who were exposed to earlier influenza A(H1N1) viruses, particularly the 1918 H1N1 virus. 27 Therefore, any known or potential immunological crossreactivity and efforts to detect and control for cross-reactivity should also be reported [ROSES-I 7.3; 12a.7]. Influenza virus infection can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes, from asymptomatic infection to a rapidly progressive fatal illness. Different definitions of clinical illness and different methods of ascertaining the presence or absence of clinical illness will have variable sensitivity and specificity for detecting an influenza-associated illness. The definitions and methods used to identify the clinical outcomes should be described [ROSES-I 7.4].",

In addition, variable conditions of the assays should be described. The minimum detection level of the assay, and how this limit is defined or calculated, should be reported, as should the handling in the analysis of samples with a result below or on the borderline of the minimum detection level [ROSES-I 11.1].

Thresholds that are designed with high specificity for diagnostic purposes in the cases of clinical illness may not provide reliable estimates of virus infection rates at the population level, if specificity has been optimized at the expense of sensitivity. 31 Therefore, the criterion for defining a positive result (as either an indication of prior infection or to infer protection) and the justification for using this criterion in the particular study setting must be reported [ROSES-I 11.2]. Immunological correlates of protection from influenza virus infection and illness are difficult to establish and the relationship between antibody titer and protection is not binary (completely protected above a titer threshold and completely unprotected below the threshold). 32,33 Therefore, if results are used to make inferences about the proportion of a population or population subgroup that are \"protected,\" it is important that this is justified by reference to what is known about the correlation between antibody titers measured by the specific assay and protection from infection or illness [ROSES-I 11.3].",

Here, we have outlined which methodological details-study design, study population, epidemiologic data collection, specimen collection and handling methods, laboratory methods, justification of criteria for seropositivity, reporting of results, limitations and biases, and interpretation-should be included when reporting the findings of seroepidemiologic studies. Our aim is for the ROSES-I, like other standards of reporting (e.g., CONSORT, STROBE), to be developed and accepted as the standard for reporting of influenza seroepidemiologic studies. When novel influenza A viruses emerge, a rapid and robust evaluation of the implications of seroepidemiologic studies is critical in order to fully assess the population health risks and the need for mitigation measures. Without the ROSES-I-recommended information for reporting, our ability to interpret seroepidemiologic studies of novel influenza A viruses will be limited.This is the first version of the ROSES-I checklist, and we hope this will be refined with use and feedback. The approach used by CONSISE for influenza seroepidemiologic studies and the items outlined in this statement are likely to be applicable or adaptable to other emerging respiratory viruses, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); however for simplicity, the ROSES-I statement described here is focused on influenza viruses. For this reason, we have entitled this statement ROSES-I, to allow for extension of the acronym ROSES to other such pathogens.",

This statement consolidates the recommendations of the CONSISE epidemiology and laboratory working groups into the familiar format of a reporting guideline. It was developed by CONSISE members (PH, BC, JW, OE, KLL, MVK) with input by the CONSISE Steering Committee and other CONSISE members. Because seroepidemiologic studies are a specific kind of observational study, this ROSES-I statement has built upon the STROBE guidelines in order to avoid confusion and conflicts. As such, the ROSES-I statement should be seen as an extension of the STROBE guidelines, in the same way that the STrengthening the REporting of Genetic Association Studies (STREGA) guidelines are an extension of STROBE for gene-disease association studies. 25 2.1 | Search strategy and selection criteria References for this review were identified through a search of PubMed conducted on May 15, 2014, and updated in May 2015 using the term (\"Seroepidemiologic Studies\"[Mesh] AND \"Influenza, Human\"[Mesh]).
