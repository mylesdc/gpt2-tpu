Boars, as an important disseminator, shed PPV to sows via semen. PPV infects and numerously replicates in boar testicle, which results in damage of swine testicle in vivo. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a mediator of cell apoptosis, play a crucial role in the mitochondria apoptotic pathway. However, whether PPV infection induces ST cells apoptosis and ROS accumulation is still unclear. Methods: To determine the effects of PPV infection on the apoptosis, we detected morphological changes, DNA ladder, activities of caspases, and expression of PARP in PPV-infected ST cells. Moreover, aiming to investigate the effect of PPV infection on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and ROS accumulation, we detected the \u0394\u03c8m, apoptosis-related genes, and ROS. To investigate the role of ROS in the process of PPV-induced apoptosis, the ST cells were infected with PPV and treated with the ROS antioxidants. The ROS level was measured using Reactive Oxygen Species Assay Kit and the \u0394\u03c8m, expression level of Bcl-2, translocation of Bax, and redistribution of mitochondria cytochrome c were tested.",

Moreover, PPV infection suppressed Bcl-2 expression, enhanced Bax expression and translocation to mitochondria, decreased the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and triggered the release of cytochrome c, which caused the subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and initiation of apoptosis. However, during the process of PPV-induced apoptosis, the protein levels of Fas and FasL were not affected. Further studies showed that PPV infection caused ROS accumulation. Inhibition of ROS could reduce mitochondrial transmembrane potential and could significantly block ST cells apoptosis via suppressing Bax translocation, cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation. Conclusions: All these results suggest that PPV-induced ROS accumulation mediates apoptosis in ST cells, which provided theoretical basis for the molecular pathogenesis of PPV infection.",

In vertebrate cells, the apoptotic pathways mainly include the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways [12] . The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is induced by stimulation of death receptors that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family, such as Fas. The induction of intrinsic apoptotic pathway is associated with mitochondria upon activation that is highly regulated by ROS [13] . ROS, known as toxic products of cellular metabolism, are mainly produced by the mitochondria in most vertebrate cells and act as signaling molecules. Moreover, growing evidence suggests ROS are involved in regulation of many pathological processes such as cellular apoptosis [14, 15] . However excessive ROS is toxic to cells, especially in the process of apoptosis. It is indicated that ROS accumulation was able to enhance apoptosis by collapsing the mitochondrial potential, inducing mitochondrial oxidation channel, and releasing cytochrome C from mitochondria to the cytosol [16] . ROS accumulation is also linked to virus-induced apoptosis. For instance, parvovirus H-1 infection induces apoptosis via mediating ROS accumulation [17, 18] . We have reported that PPV infection could be able to trigger cell apoptosis through mitochondria-mediated pathway [19] . However, whether ROS are associated with PPV-induced apoptosis is still unclear.",

To determine the effect of PPV infection on \u0394\u03c8m, we detected the \u0394\u03c8m of PPV-infected and mock-infected ST cells. As shown in Fig. 2a , the percentage of \u0394\u03c8m-depolarized cells increased 6 % at 6 hpi and the level of depolarization was time-dependent. During mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, \u0394\u03c8m was regulated by Bcl-2 family members, such as pro-apoptotic protein Bax and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. To explore the effects of PPV infection on Bcl-2 and Bax, western blot analysis was performed. The western blot results showed that PPV infection increased Bax expression and suppressed Bcl-2 expression (Fig. 2b) .",

The mitochondrion-mediated (intrinsic) pathway is characterized by changed mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, cytochrome c then is involved in the formation of a multiprotein complex known as the \"apoptosome\" and activates the caspase cascade through caspase-9 [26] .

Isolation of mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins was carried out using the Mitochondria/cytosol Fractionation Kit (Pierce, US) according to the manufacture's protocol. Protein concentration was detected using BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, US). Equivalent amount of protein was loaded and (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 4 The role of ROS in PPV-induced apoptosis. a The effects of ROS inhibitors PDTC and NAC on ROS production. PPV-infected cells were treated with PDTC or NAC and stained with DCFH-DA. The ROS production was measured by flow cytometry. b The effect of ROS on \u0394\u03c8m in PPV-infected ST cells. The \u0394\u03c8m of cells infected with PPV and treated with PDTC or NAC was detected by flow cytometry. c The effects of ROS scavengers on the Bcl-2, Bax translocation, cytochrome c redistribution. ROS inhibitors-treated cells were infected with PPV and analyzed using western blot assay. The mitochondrial and the cytosolic proteins were respectively normalized to Cox-4 and \u03b2-actin. d The effect of ROS scavengers on the activity of caspase-3 in PPV-infected ST cells. Caspase-3 activity was measured using the caspase activity kit. e The effect of ROS scavengers on the apoptotic rate of PPV-infected cells. The apoptotic rate was measured by flow cytometry. The data represent three independent experiments \u00b1 SD. **, p < 0.01 in comparison with PPV infection alone subjected to electrophoresis on 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Subsequently, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore Corp, US). The membranes were blocked with 5 % non-fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibody at the dilution of 1:500 in antibody dilution buffer (PBS, 2 % non-fat dry milk) over night at 4\u00b0C. The blots were subjected to secondary antibody at the dilution of 1:10000 in antibody dilution buffer (PBS, 2 % non-fat dry milk) at room temperature for 1 h and detected with ECL reagent (Pierce, US).",
