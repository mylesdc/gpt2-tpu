First, compared to the Chinese Health and Family Life Survey in 1999-2000, TeSSHS has a lower proportion of participants with !1 sex partners in the past 12 months i.e. 5.2%, (95% CI 3.3-8.2%) for males and 2.7% (95% CI 1.6-4.7%) for females compared to that of China study, 10.0% for males and 4.0% for females admitted so [16] . Secondly, compared to the Youth Sexuality Study (2011) in Hong Kong where 19.7% of male and 5.2% of female youth (18-27 years old) reported eposex partners in the past six months [34] , the proportions of male and female aged 18-26 years old with !wisex partners in the past 12 months were 2.6% (95% CI 0.9-7.2%) and 3.3% (95% CI 1.1-9.7%) in TeSSHS respectively. Thirdly, the consistent condom use reported in the general population is 24% (95% CI 21.84-26.16%) [35] whilst the consistent condom use among TESSHS participants is 35.9%, indicating that they may be more health conscious and prepared to practise sexual risk reduction.",

Based on the findings of TeSSHS, Chlamydia trachomatis screening for sexually active youth between 18-26 years of age and older women (40-49 years) could be costeffective. Other risks factors such as living status and travel history could help identify people of higher risks. Certain key populations have expressed concern and the need of CT screening, for example, in the CT prevalence study among the cross-border truck drivers, a third of those who phoned for the results expressed this need [40] .
