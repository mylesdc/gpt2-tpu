The fusion protein was analyzed for reactivity with SARS patients' sera and with anti-sera against the two human coronaviruses HCoV 229E and HCoV OC43 by ELISA, IFA and immunoblot assays. Furthermore, to evaluate the antigen-specific humoral antibody and T-cell responses in mice, the fusion protein was injected into 6-week-old BALB/c mice and a neutralization test as well as a Tcell analysis was performed. To evaluate the antiviral efficacy of immunization, BALB/c mice were challenged intranasally with SARSCoV at day 33 post injection and viral loads were determined by fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR. Serological results showed that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the truncated S-N fusion protein derived the SARS virus were > 99% (457/460) and 100.00% (650/650), respectively. Furthermore there was no cross-reactivity with other two human coronaviruses. High titers of antibodies to SRASCoV appeared in the immunized mice and the neutralization test showed that antibodies to the fusion protein could inhibit SARSCoV. The T cell proliferation showed that the fusion protein could induce an antigen-specific T-cell response. Fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR showed that BALB/c mice challenged intranasally with SARSCoV at day 33 post injection were completely protected from virus replication.",

A final step of 5 min at 72\u00b0C was added to the last cycle. The fusion gene construct was established for expression of a truncated S-N fusion protein.

We aligned the N protein of five human coronaviruses (SARSCoV, HCoV229E, HCoVNL63, HCoVOC43 and HCoVHKU1) and found several fairly homologous regions, e.g. SARSCoV 57-210aa, 258-320aa. In these regions, the N protein of SARSCoV is 35-39% identical in amino acid sequence to the N protein of HCoV 229E and HCoV NL63 and 47-50% identical in amino acid sequence to that of HCoVOC43 and HCoVHKU1 ( Figure 4 ). We also found that the C-terminal of the N protein (SARSCoV 321-422aa) has lower identity in amino acid sequence among these human coronaviruse ( Figure 4 ). In addition, our previous research showed that some unique highly antigenic sites are located in the Cterminal part of the SARS N protein and in the 270-667aa of the SARS spike (S) protein [8] . Other research also showed that the C-terminal part of the SARS N protein was highly antigenic [27] . In the present study, using the pQE30 expression vector we cloned the N genes, gene segments encoding the C-terminal parts of the N proteins from all three coronaviruses, as well as SARSCoV gene segments encoding a truncated spike protein (264-680 aa) and a truncated S-N fusion protein, respectively. All proteins were highly expressed in E. coli M15. To evaluate the cross-reactivity of these recombinant proteins and viruses, IFA and immunoblot assays were performed. The results (Figures 2 and 3) showed that the truncated proteins only reacted with species-specific antiserum while the N proteins cross-reacted as did the viruses. The further ELISA results also showed that the intact N proteins of HCoV229E and HCoVOC43 cross-reacted with SARS patients' sera (21/460, 34/460 respectively) while the truncated N proteins did not cross-react with SARS patients' sera.",

The results indicated the N and S protein were complementary in detecting SARS-specific antibodies. This is consistent with previous studies [28, 29] . Five positive sera to SARSCoV lysate antigen were all tested positive against SARSCoV N protein but negative against SARSCoV truncated N-S protein. These sera were also tested positive against N proteins of HCoV229E and HCoVOC43 (data not shown), which could be reasonably explained partly by existence of other HCoV infections in these humans. The truncated S-N fusion protein was also subjected to ELISA with mice antisera against SARSCoV (BJ01), HCoV229E and HCoVOC43. Only mice antiserum against SARSCoV(BJ01) tests positive. These results showed that the SARSCoV truncated N-S protein had high specificity. Considering the difficulty of SARSCoV lysate antigen pro- duction and its false positive ratio (~0.77%, Table 2 ), the truncated S-N fusion protein is a suitable diagnostic antigen for detection of SARSCoV antibodies.",

            "text": "The S protein of SARSCoV is an important determinant of tissue tropism, as it mediates virus and cellular membrane fusion. Analysis of neutralizing epitopes showed that the receptor-binding region of the S protein plays an important role in virus infection [12, 30, 31] . A DNA vaccine study of SARSCoV has also shown that the S protein can induce protective immune responses to SARSCoV [32] . Moreover, some data showed that the N protein of SARSCoV could induce specific T-cell responses and studies of animal coronaviruses have suggested that both cellular and humoral immunity contribute to protection during persistent infection [13, 16, 33] . Considering that our fusion protein includes the receptor-binding region of the S protein and immunodominant T-cell epitopes of the N protein, we also investigated the role of the truncated S-N protein in anti-SARSCoV infection. Seven to nine days after injection of the fusion protein, the mice began to show seropositive for SARS antibodies. After the first booster, all mice generated high titer of SARS-specific antibodies and the antibodies could neutralize the SARSCoV infectivity. In the lymphocytes proliferation assay, the truncated S-N protein could induce T cell proliferation (Table 3 ). Compared to the control group, the mice immunized with the truncated S-N protein were protected from SARSCoV challenge, as indicated by a lack of detectable viral RNA. Therefore, in addition to being a valuable diagnostic antigen the truncated S-N fusion protein is a potential candidate for the development of a SARS subunit vaccine.",
