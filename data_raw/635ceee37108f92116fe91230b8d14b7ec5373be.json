The four RT-iiPCRs did not react with Zika virus and chikungunya virus; tests with serial dilutions of the four DENV serotypes made in human serum showed they had detection endpoints comparable to those of the reference method, indicating great analytical sensitivity and specificity. Clinical performance of the RT-iiPCR reagents was evaluated by testing 40 serum samples each (around 20 target serotype-positive and 20 DENV-negative); all four reagents had high agreement (97.5-100%) with the reference qRT-PCR.

DENV infection causes a wide range of clinical signs in humans, from asymptomatic to acute febrile illness (dengue fever, DF), to severe hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndromes (DHF/DSS) [1] . Dengue disease is a major public health problem in developing tropical countries and has being continuously spreading to new geographical areas [2, 3] . Frequent international travel to dengue endemic or epidemic regions has contributed to the escalating numbers of imported dengue cases in temperate region. Outbreaks of the four DENV serotypes have been increasing reported in the tropics and sub-tropics mainly in Asia, South America, and the Caribbean; multiple virus serotypes have been found co-circulating in the hyperendemic regions in Southeast Asia and Pacific [2] . Taiwan, located in the tropical-subtropical region of the Northern Hemisphere, has seen many DENV outbreaks since the first half of 20th century. Since 2006, southern Taiwan has faced dengue outbreaks of different scales every year; relatively large outbreaks occurred in 2014 and 2015, with DENV-1 and -2 being the major serotype, respectively [4] .",

In addition, antibody-mediated enhancement (ADE) of DENV infection further complicates disease severity [7] . Chances for developing DHF-DSS is elevated when infection with one of the four serotypes is followed by a heterotypic serotype; the replacement of DENV-3 by DENV-1 in Sri Lanka in 2009, was associated with a wave of severe dengue epidemic in Sri Lanka [8] [9] [10] .",

Current methods to aid diagnosis of DENV infection include virus isolation (e.g. antigen detection immunofluorescence assay), nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs; e.g. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR], real-time RT-PCR [qRT-PCR]), and serological assays (e.g. NS1 antigen detection, plaque reduction neutralization titers (PRNT), and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) [15] . Although a number of NS1 rapid diagnostic tests are commercially available to detect NS1 antigen during the first few days of fever, they do not provide serotype information [16] . PRNT, antigen detection immunofluorescence assay are able to determine DENV serotypes [17] , but they are both time-consuming, expensive, laborious, and feasible only in wellequipped laboratories. With relatively high specificity and sensitivity, NATs were recommended for the detection of DENV RNA by the World Health Organization [1] . Several multiplex qRT-PCR methods capable of serotyping have been reported [18] [19] [20] . However, performance of qRT-PCR tests requires skilled technicians and relatively expensive equipment that are not available to remote areas or developing countries; transportation of specimens is another major obstacle. In order to bring early serotyping of DENV to points of need (PON), a rapid, easy, mobile, NAT method of high sensitivity and specificity is needed.",

A lightweight hand-held model, POCKIT Micro Plus Nucleic Acid Analyzer (POCKIT Micro Plus), that works with a built-in rechargeable battery is also available. In this system, insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) is achieved consistently in a capillary tube (R-tube, GeneReach) in a simple, specially designed insulated heater and relies on fluorescent probe hydrolysis for signal detection [23, 24] . Various iiPCR/RT-iiPCR-based reagents, available commercially in a lyophilized format to facilitate long-term storage and easy shipping, have been validated to have analytical and clinical performance comparable to reference methods (real time PCR, nested PCR, virus isolation) for different important microbial pathogen hosts [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . The POCKIT device has been bundled with easy field-deployable methods for nucleic acid extraction, with potential to serve as a flexible mobile PON tool for rapid DENV detection in human and mosquito.",

Here, we evaluated preliminarily the performance of the four serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents to detect their target DENV serotypes in mosquito specimens on the hand-held POCKIT Micro Plus PCR system. Nucleic acids extracted from female A. aegypti mosquitoes experimentally infected with DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 serotype were subjected to PCR testing by the POCKIT DENV-1, -2, -3, or -4 RT-iiPCR. The results showed that the DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 RT-iiPCR can detect their target DENV serotypes but not the serotypes to be excluded (Table 4) , indicating excellent specificity for DENV serotypes in mosquito sample matrix.",

Accurate and rapid detection and serotyping of DENV can help improve the recognition of severe dengue warning signs in patients suspected of DENV infection. Timely reporting on the detection and serotyping status of DENV in mosquito can serve as an alert to people who fall ill to consider the possibility of dengue infection and seek medical assistant in time, and to initiate timely community and vector control programs to help mitigate the spread of DENV infection. In this study, tests with clinical serum samples showed that the four singleplex serotyping RT-iiPCR reagents had clinical performance comparable to that of the reference qRT-PCR for the detection of their target serotypes in human serum. There was one qRT-PCR-positive/RT-iiPCR-negative sample for DENV-2 and qRT-PCR-negative/RT-iiPCR-positive for DENV-3. The discrepancy in detection between the two assays was likely due to low viral loads in these samples; one supporting observation was that the one qRT-PCR-positive/RT-iiPCR-negative sample had a Ct of 44.49 in qRT-PCR. The four index reagents offered excellent analytical sensitivity and specificity to detect their target DENV serotypes in human serum on the compact field-deployable POCKIT device, and also had great analytical specificity in mosquito samples on the hand-held POCKIT Micro Plus.",

Furthermore, when patients with previous DENV infection were infected with a heterotypic serotype, the chances for them to develop DHF-DSS were elevated [7] . The pan-DENV RT-iiPCR/POCKIT system validated previously for the detection of all four DENV serotypes in human plasma and serum [32, 33] is useful in aiding the identification of acute DENV infection, especially for remote regions with high burdens of DENV infection. However, this system could not differentiate between different DENV serotypes. In this study, we showed that the four new RT-PCR reagents for DENV serotyping can work on the same field-deployable PCR system to serve as tools to allow timely near-patient serotyping of DENV in human and mosquitos to facilitate efficient disease management and public health surveillance.",

However, this technology is in general not available at most PONs to provide timely serotyping results in regions with threats of epidemic dengue; RNA degradation during the shipping process to the central laboratories is also a concern [43] . The POCKIT or POCKIT Micro Plus device has been bundled with the field-deployable taco mini extraction system in a durable suitcase (POCKIT combo, POCKIT Micro combo, respectively; GeneReach) to meet the needs of PON applications at different settings. The equipment can be operated with a car battery or a rechargeable battery and only a few simple steps are needed from sample to results with this mobile PCR system. Current commercially available NS1 immunological test products are rapid and do not require trained personnel to operate. They have been shown to have great performance for detecting DENV in both human and mosquitoes [44] . However, they do not provide serotype information. In addition, its sensitivity was relatively low on days 1 and 2 and after day 5 postsymptomatic onset in human, compared to that seen with the-RT-PCR methods [16] .",
