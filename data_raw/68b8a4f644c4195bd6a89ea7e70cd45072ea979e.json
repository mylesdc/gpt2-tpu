We used a publically available case line list to explore the effect of relevant factors, notably underlying comorbidities, on fatal outcome of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases up to the end of October 2016. A Bayesian Weibull proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the effect of comorbidity, age, epidemic period and sex on the fatality rate of MERS cases and its variation across countries. The crude fatality rate of MERS cases was 32.1% (95% credibility interval (CI): 29.9%, 34.3%). Notably, the incremental change of daily death rate was most prominent during the first week since disease onset with an average increase of 13%, but then stabilized in the remaining two weeks when it only increased 3% on average. Neither sex, nor country of infection were found to have a significant impact on fatality rates after taking into account the age and comorbidity status of patients. After adjusting for age, epidemic period, MERS patients with comorbidity had around 4 times the risk for fatal infection than those without (adjusted hazard ratio of 3.74 (95% CI: 2.57, 5.67)).",

The majority of patients in other countries had travelled to KSA and UAE prior to the onset MERS. Descriptive results on demographic characteristics, comorbidity, and contact patterns are provided in Table 1 . Fatal cases in patients with MERS were older (P < 0.001) and predominated in males (P < 0.001). Among the 1223 cases where comorbid conditions were reported, patients with comorbidity were at elevated risk for being dead compared with those without (11.1% vs 48.3%, P < 0.001). Note that cases with unknown comorbid conditions were similar to those without. When the history of contact patterns were categorized into camel contact, other animals, and presumed human, there was no statistical difference in outcome across these contact patterns (P = 0.476). The fatality rate was higher in the period before Mar. 20, 2014 , when compared to after (P = 0.004).

Applying survival analysis enabled us to detect the change in the force of fatal outcome by time reflected by the shape of baseline hazard showing a trend of increasing by decreasing rate and an improved fit by applying Bayesian proportional hazards regression model with Weibull distribution to observed data ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary material H). More importantly, our approach demonstrated the framework of predicting the prognosis of MERS cases with the consideration of individual characteristics, country-level heterogeneities, and time-varying change to the risk of MERS death. The case fatality rates by age groups were plotted using the estimated results based on the Weibull proportion hazards regression model with fixed effect adjusting for comorbidity and was compared with the results of Lessler et al. 22 in Fig. 5 . Our estimated results were consistent with that reported by Lessler et al. till the age group of 40-49 years, after which our case fatality rates appear markedly lower (35% vs 48% for 50-59 year olds, 40% vs 74% for 60-69 year olds, and 46% vs 84% for those over 70 years old) 22 . This discrepancy almost certainly arises because we have been able to take account of patient's comorbidity status, and these older patients are more likely to have comorbidities. Our data also includes MERS cases from outside KSA, but given the lack of evidence for variation in the impact of comorbidities across countries, this does not seem plausible as a major reason for these observed differences.",

The non-significant variation of fatality rate across countries we found here after taking into account the characteristic of MERS patients suggests that any variation in disease monitoring, contact tracing, case identification and thus timing of medical intervention across countries has had minimal clinical impact on average. However, the increasing survival rate we noted in the later epidemic period in our study could indicate that the quality and/or timing of medical treatment has generally improved as the epidemic has progressed. The potential causes of this require further study, but could be due to increased awareness, especially enhanced reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases. Conversely, it seems unlikely that this change is associated with a single mutation in the virus because several different MERS CoV phylogenetic clades have circulated in this period 15 . We also note that the case fatality rate of Zaire Ebola virus has similarly decreased with time 27 .",

Neverthelss, the work here differs in four respects. First, we have used a Weibull proportional hazards rather than Poisson regression, which has allowed us to investigate the incremental change in daily death rate over time. Second, we have not chosen to exclude the outbreak in South Korea as they did on the grounds that it was \"unique. \" Rather we have tried to explicitly model its potentially unique nature by allowing for variation in fatality rates across countries, finding no evidence that the characteristics of the South Korean outbreak being different from that seen anywhere else. Third, we have more than a year's extra data to analyse. Finally, these factors have combined to lead to our conclusion that those with a later time of infection onset had lower risk in our multivariate analysis, but this only showed in the univariate analysis of Rivers's study.",

However, the failure to detect an improvement in the fit of our models by DIC when we applied random intercept and random slope to the impact of comorbidities across countries (Supplementary material G) suggests a homogenous definition for comorbid conditions among countries.
