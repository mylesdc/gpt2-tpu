We sequenced some of the positive PCR specimens and used the obtained sequences to draw the phylogenetic tree based on the partial IBV-ORF-1a, N, and S1 gene sequences. The phylogenetic trees based on the IBV-N and S1 gene sequences showed that the circulating IBV strains in Al-Hasa during 2016 was showing a high degree of identity to some strains from Taiwan and Italy.

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious respiratory viral disease of chickens of all ages. The IBV belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and genus Gammacoronavirus [1, 2] . The IBV genome is a positive sense RNA molecule with a high tendency to frequent changes and recombination. There is a high degree of genetic diversity among IBV strains. Until recently, there was no available system for the definite grouping and identification of various IBV genotypes. One recent study used the combination between the phylogenetic analysis and the pairwise similarities on both the nucleotides and the amino acid levels to do fine mapping of the IBV genotypes [3] . This study used the full-length S1 gene sequences to develop a novel classification system for the IBV genotypes and lineages [3] . Based on the comparison of the coding sequence of the S1 gene from 1652 IBV strains, they were able to categorize the currently circulating IBV strains into 6 genotypes and 32 lineages [3] . The IBV infection usually causes high economic losses among the poultry industry. It is quite possible to become endemic in the chicken industry in some regions of the world. The virus has wide tissue tropism, including the respiratory, digestive, renal, and reproductive systems of the affected birds. It may affect the oviduct and lead to low production and low-quality eggs or may cause severe renal complications and mortality among the affected birds [4] . The IBV-infected birds usually shed the virus in their body secretions such as respiratory and the gastrointestinal tract secretions. These birds may remain active shedders of the virus for up to several weeks post-infection [5] . Secondary bacterial infections (Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma gallisepticum) always exaggerate the viral pathogenesis and auscultate the mortality rates among the infected chicken population [6] . The IBV infections continue to be a major problem to the poultry industry worldwide. In spite of the availability of several IBV vaccines, the virus continues to cause many outbreaks among the chicken farms in both broiler and layer settings [7] .",

Many IBV strains and serotypes have emerged since its discovery >80 years ago; meanwhile, the misuse of the IBV vaccines complicates the evolution and emergence of new IBV strains [8] . One possible explanation for the emergence of new IBV strains is the poor proofreading capability of the viral RNA polymerase. This resulted in high mutation rates alongside the viral genome. This leads to the emergence of new IBV strains occasionally [9, 10] . Many IBV vaccines are commercially available, including inactivated, live attenuated, and recombinant. The live-attenuated vaccines are the most commonly used in all types of poultry; these provide a good immune response; however, there is a possibility of revert to virulence. Meanwhile, the inactivated vaccines are usually administered to layers and breeder's chickens before the laying time as booster vaccines [11, 12] .",

We found great overlapping and consistency of the phylogenetic analysis based on the IBV-S1 and N genes. The reported sequences were closely related to other IBV strains reported in Taiwan, Italy, and China ( Figures-3-5 ). This high identity to foreign IBV strains may be due to that Saudi Arabia does import chickens from different countries including UK, China, Italy, and Taiwan. However, the IBV-ORF1a sequences revealed that these strains were related to other IBV strains belonging to the IBV-QX strain (L1148) (Figure-3) . It is well known that there is a great diversity of S1 gene among IBV strains, which make it a strong candidate for the IBV classification [26] . Furthermore, novel variations were reported among most of the IBV-N gene [27, 28] . This is suggesting the potential use of some IBV-S1 and maybe IBV-N genes for the classification of different IBV strains as described [3] .",

This indicates a wide distribution of IBV in the Al-Hasa in the Kingdom in general. In spite of the massive application of IBV vaccines in chicken farms under study, IBV is circulating, and thus, the currently used IBV vaccines under field conditions did not provide enough protection against the IBV infection. Another challenge in the context of this vaccination failure is the possibility of circulating of novel IBV strains that do not share any antigenic relationship with the currently used vaccines, and thus, protection cannot be achieved. We believe that IBV will continue to hit several chicken farms in the region and many other parts in the world. Further studies are highly recommended to do thorough molecular characterization of the currently circulating and the possible emerging IBV strains; thus, protection was usually achieved through the preparation of the homologous relevant specific IBV vaccines.",
