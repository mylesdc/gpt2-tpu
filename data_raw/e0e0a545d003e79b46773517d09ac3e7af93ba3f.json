            "text": "Background: Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) cause a wide range of diseases. However, the genotype diversity and epidemiological information relating to HAdVs among hospitalized children with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) is limited. Here, we describe the epidemiology and genotype distribution of HAdVs associated with RTIs in Beijing, China. Methods: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) were collected from hospitalized children with RTIs from April 2017 to March 2018. HAdVs were detected by a TaqMan-based quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay, and the hexon gene was used for phylogenetic analysis. Epidemiological data were analyzed using statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 21.0 software. Results: HAdV was detected in 72 (5.64%) of the 1276 NPA specimens, with most (86.11%, 62/72) HAdV-positives cases detected among children < 6 years of age. HAdV-B3 (56.06%, 37/66) and HAdV-C2 (19.70%, 13/66) were the most frequent. Of the 72 HAdV-infected cases, 27 (37.50%) were co-infected with other respiratory viruses, most commonly parainfluenza virus (12.50%, 9/72) and rhinovirus (9.72%, 7/72). The log number of viral load ranged from 3.30 to 9.14 copies per mL of NPA, with no significant difference between the HAdV mono-and co-infection groups. The main clinical symptoms in the HAdV-infected patients were fever and cough, and 62 (86.11%, 62/72) were diagnosed with pneumonia. Additionally, HAdVs were detected throughout the year with a higher prevalence in summer. Conclusions: HAdV prevalence is related to age and season. HAdV-B and HAdV-C circulated simultaneously among the hospitalized children with RTIs in Beijing, and HAdV-B type 3 and HAdV-C type 2 were the most frequent.",

They are common pathogens in children and cause a variety of diseases [1] . HAdV accounts for at least 5 to 10% of pediatric and 1 to 7% of adult respiratory tract infections (RTIs) [2] . There are currently seven different HAdV species (A to G), some of which specifically attack the conjunctiva (species D), the upper and lower respiratory tracts (species B, C and E), and the gastrointestinal tract (species F and G) [3] . Of the 90 AdV serotypes, 55 are known to cause human diseases, with AdV3, 4, 7 and 14 being the most common types to cause respiratory disease outbreaks [4] . HAdV has caused respiratory tract adenovirus outbreaks in Jiangsu and Taiwan provinces of China, as well as in Korea, Singapore and Malaysia [5] [6] [7] . Such infections have been estimated to cause 2-5% of RTIs overall and 4-10% of all pneumonias in City of Bethlehem [8] .",

At present, China has not yet established a nationwide epidemiological surveillance program for adenovirus infections, and infections with it do not need to be legally reported, so the institutions for disease control and prevention cannot conduct early detection screening or issue early warnings. Neither are there any U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved antivirals for adenoviral infections [10] . HAdVs play an important role in respiratory infections, particularly in children. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characteristics of HAdV infections occurring among children with RTIs in a Chinese tertiary hospital from April 2017 to March 2018. Collectively, the findings from this study underscore the importance of monitoring the epidemiology of HAdV infections and protecting vulnerable patients as part of the suite of infection prevention strategies in hospitals.",

HAdV detection was performed using qPCR assay targeting the highly conserved gene region (132-bp) of the HAdV hexon. TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA) was used to amplify HAdV hexon DNA using specific primers (Forward:5\u2032-GCCCCAGTGG TCTTACATGCACATC-3\u2032; Reverse: 5\u2032-GCCACGGTG GGGTTTCT AAACTT-3\u2032) and probe (5\u2032-FAM-TGCA CCAGACCCGGGCTCAGGTACTCCGA-3\u2032-TAMRA) [12] . Each 20 \u03bcL reaction mixture comprised 10 \u03bcL of 2 \u00d7 TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix, 1.8 \u03bcL of each primer (10 pM), 0.2 \u03bcL of probe (10 pM), 4.2 \u03bcL of sterile water, and 2.0 \u03bcL of the nucleic acid components extracted from each sample. The qPCR cycling program was as follows: 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) < 38 were regarded as positive. 10-fold serial dilutions of pMD18-T/Hexon plasmid from 10 10 to 10 0 copies per \u03bcL were prepared to establish a standard curve to measure the HAdV load. qPCR were performed using the Mx3005P qPCR System (Agilent Stratagene, USA). HAdV-positive samples were subsequently screened for the following pathogens: influenza A (FluA) and B (FluB) viruses, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1-4, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), WU polyomavirus (WUPyV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human coronaviruses (HCoV) NL63, OC43, 229E, HKU1 and human bocavirus (HBoV), as described previously [13] [14] [15] .

Herein, we describe (i) the prevalence of HAdVs in hospitalized children with RTIs presenting at Beijing Friendship Hospital during a one-year period; (ii) the clinical spectrum of the HAdV-positive RTI patients; (iii) the viral co-pathogens present in the HAdV infections; and (iv) the genetic diversity of the HAdVs. The clinical characteristics of the RTIs caused by HAdV are very similar to those of influenza, PIV and other respiratory tract pathogens, making it difficult to clinically diagnose this type of infection. Therefore, effective diagnostic methods are needed for rapid identification and genotyping of HAdV. The qPCR assay used herein was established to detect and quantify HAdV. A total of 1276 NPA specimens were screened for the presence of HAdV and 72 specimens (5.64%, 72/1276) were confirmed to be positive for HAdV, which is consistent with prior reports (1.70-13.90%) [16] [17] [18] . The detection rate for HAdV varies from region to region in China, and the rate for hospitalized children with acute lower RTIs in Zhejiang province from 2006 to 2012 was 0.63, and 2.24% in Shenzhen city from 2012 to 2015 [19, 20] . However, it is worth mentioning that such discrepant HAdV detection rates can be caused by methodological differences, the number of patients tested, the periods during which the samples are collected, and even a study's duration. Previous studies have shown that HAdV detection rates are positively correlated with the monthly mean temperature and sunshine duration, and negatively correlated with wind speed; in fact, the higher the air temperature, the higher the detection rate [21] . Our study also revealed that HAdV infections occurred throughout the year with the highest prevalence in the summer (9.52%, Jun to Aug), peaking in August (10.91%), which is similar to what has been found in Tianjin, a northern Chinese city, where HAdV infections are concentrated during the summer [22] . However, this finding is discordant with other studies that have reported seasonal peaks for HAdV infections in spring in Northern China and Mexico [23, 24] .",

Similarly to what has been found in Asia by other authors, HAdV-B3 was the most common type (56.06%, 37/66) followed by HAdV-C2 (19.70%, 13/66) and C1 (10.61%, 7/ 66).

Moreover, HAdV-B3 was the pathogen causing epidemic respiratory disease outbreaks in Europe, America, and Oceania.
