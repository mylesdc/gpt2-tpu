            "text": "Developments of DNA sequencing technology have resulted in a rapid expansion of genome data. It becomes a challenging issue to explore the secrets of genomes and maximize the scientific knowledge gained from them. The first step in analyzing a completely or partially sequenced genome is to identify all its genes. Accurate gene recognition is relevant to many biological applications, for example, DNA microarray, knockout experiments and drug design. There exist some well-known computer systems for gene-finding in bacterial and archaeal genomes. These systems are either based on statistic analysis, such as Gen-eMarkS [1], Glimmer [2, 3] , and ZCURVE [4] , or based on similarity alignment, such as CRITICA [5] and ORPHEUS [6] . Generally, satisfactory predicted results are obtained by using the above statistics-based software. On the contrary, genome annotation in newly sequenced viruses and phages is frequently based on similarity search methods such as BLAST [7] . Some species-specific genes are likely to be missed although high specificity is obtained by using similarity search methods. Evidence shows that an open reading frame (ORF) longer than a given length and not or slightly overlapping with any adjacent ORFs is likely to be a gene. However, simply assigning all such ORFs to genes usually generates over-predictions. Therefore, it is of necessity to use highly accurate and statistics-based systems for viral genome annotations. Unfortunately, currently there are very few satisfactory statistics-based viral gene-finding systems, except GeneMark gene-finding family [8, 9] . However, GeneMark systems for gene-finding in virus and phage genomes suffer from some basic drawbacks. It is the aim of this paper to put forward an alternative approach for viral and phage gene-finding to improve the quality of annotations, particularly, for newly sequenced genomes.",

            "text": "The ZCURVE system for finding protein-coding genes in bacterial and archaeal genomes developed by our group has been used in 40 laboratories or institutes all over the world [4] . In a recent paper, ZCURVE and the other two well-known bacterial gene-finding systems, Glimmer and CRITICA, are combined into a metatool named YACOP [10] . By adapting similar algorithm of ZCURVE, a new system specific to coronavirus genomes, ZCURVE_CoV, has been developed subsequently [11] . The ZCURVE_CoV system results in highly consistent results with GenBank annotations for coronavirus genomes, especially for SARS-CoV genomes [11] . However, the above software cannot be simply used to identify protein-coding genes in other viral or phage genomes. Here, a self-training system, ZCURVE_V is presented to address the problem. Similar to ZCURVE [4] and ZCURVE_CoV [11] , the present ZCURVE_V system is also based on the Z curve representation of DNA sequences [12] . Compared with the most widely used viral gene-finding system, GeneMark family [8, 9] , the algorithm of ZCURVE_V is much simpler, because only 33 recognition variables are needed. Therefore, ZCURVE_V is conceptually different from Gene-Mark. Compared with GeneMark, ZCURVE_V resulted in better predicted results for smaller viral genomes (< 100 kb). In addition, the performance of ZCURVE_V is generally better than that of GeneMark for genomes with particular features, such as amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus, probably with the lowest genomic GC content among all the organisms sequenced so far. Moreover, it is also shown that joint applications of ZCURVE_V and Gene-Mark lead to better gene-finding results for viral and phage genomes.",

The default settings are adopted for all the options unless indicated otherwise. Evaluation of ZCURVE_V is based on the comparison between the gene-finding results and the RefSeq annotations for each genome. It should be noted that the RefSeq records are usually listed as provisional and have not themselves undergone extensive curation and literature cross-checking. However, to test and compare the performance of the presented algorithm we do need some criteria. Knowing that the RefSeq records are questionable, we chose to select those RefSeq data which possess the maximum reliability. For example, gene annotations in HIV, HBV and coronavirus are well known in the literature. Therefore, these three viruses are selected as samples to test and compare the algorithm. Other RefSeq records are selected similarly. Due to the inaccuracy of the RefSeq annotations currently available, the comparison between the performance of GeneMark and ZCURVE_V based on the RefSeq annotations should be deemed as preliminary.",

Generally speaking, the results obtained by the latter are more accurate than those obtained by the former. To strictly evaluate the performance of ZCURVE_V, the predicted results deposited in the GeneMark VIOLIN database are employed unless they are not available. A total of 30 viral genomes not annotated by GeneMark were used for the comparison, whose names are listed as follows: canarypox virus Table 1 , where the genomes are listed in the order in which the chromosome sequence length is descending. For the 15 viral genomes with the chromosome sequence length larger than 100 kb in Table 1 , the average S n of ZCURVE_V and GeneMark is 95.9% and 92.5%, respectively, and the average S p of ZCURVE_V and GeneMark is 92.8% and 94.0%, respectively. For the 15 viral genomes with the chromosome sequence length less than 100 kb listed in Table 1 , the average S n of ZCURVE_V and GeneMark is 95.6% and 80.0%, whereas the average S p of ZCURVE_V and GeneMark is 93.2% and 91.1%, respectively. As can be seen, both the average S n and S p of ZCURVE_V for the small viral genomes are similar with those for the large viral genomes, whereas the average S n of GeneMark for small viral genomes is much lower than that for large viral genomes. Note that viral and phage genomes shorter than 100 kb constitute the major part of viral and phage genomes sequenced so far. Over 90% of the 979 viral and 212 phage genomes analyzed here are shorter than 100 kb. If the average is performed over all the 30 genomes, S n and S p are 95.7% and 93.0% for ZCURVE_V, respectively, whereas S p and S p are 86.2% and 92.5% for GeneMark. In summary, S p of both systems is well matched, but S n of ZCURVE_V is much higher (about 9.5% higher) than that of GeneMark. Although Glimmer (2,3) were designed for gene-finding in bacterial genomes, for comparison, the gene-finding results by Glimmer 2.02 for all the 30 genomes are also listed in Table 1 .",

To our knowledge, it has the lowest genomic GC content among all the organisms completely sequenced so far, which is 17.78%. In the original annotation by the submitter of GenBank entries, all of the ORFs larger than 180 bp are predicted as possible protein-coding genes [14] . Such annotation method is very likely to generate over-annotation. The current RefSeq annotation curated by NCBI staff remains nearly the same compared with the original annotation, i.e., the genome contains 295 possible genes. After run- ning ZCURVE_V, 245 out of the 295 annotated genes are found and the number of additionally predicted genes is 5. Among the 50 (295-245) genes not predicted by ZCURVE_V, only one gene has putative function and another two are similar to existing genes without functions in public databases, while the remaining 47 are only annotated as 'hypothetical proteins'. The result supports the notion that protein-coding genes are over-annotated in the amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus genome. The GeneMark VIOLIN database correctly predicts 239 annotated genes while the number of additionally predicted genes is as high as 323. It is obvious that most of these additional genes predicted by the GeneMark VIOLIN database are non-coding ORFs. Perhaps the severe over-prediction of the GeneMark VIOLIN database for the amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus genome is caused by its weak adaptability to genomes with particular features.",

The global AIDS epidemic killed 3.1 million people in the past year. In the current GenBank annotation for HIV-1 (GenBank AC: AF033819), 9 protein-coding genes are contained, in which 7 genes are single-exon genes without any intron. Genes tat and rev have one intron, respectively. When using default settings, ZCURVE_V and the GeneMark VIOLIN database predict 7 and 6 genes for the genome, respectively. The predicted results are listed in Table 3 . As can be seen, both ZCURVE_V and the Gene-Mark VIOLIN database predict the 5 annotated singleexon genes pol, gag, vpr, env and nef.

Heuristic approach [8] is a self-training method and no human intervention is required during the running process. However, the performance of heuristic approach is generally worse than that of the GeneMark VIOLIN database [9] . The GeneMark VIOLIN database provides just an up-to-date analysis of newly sequenced viral genomes and is not able to be used to analyze anonymous viral genomes. Similar to the heuristic approach of GeneMark family, the ZCURVE_V is also a self-training method and enables analyzing any anonymous viral and phage genomes without any human intervention. Because the executable version of the program ZCURVE_V may be downloaded and run locally, it will be used more conveniently. More specific options when running ZCURVE_V strengthen its power. The prediction of ZCURVE_V is more accurate than that of GeneMark for viral or phage genomes shorter than 1000 bp. Therefore, it is suggested that ZCURVE_V may serve as a preferred gene-finding tool for viral and phage genomes, especially for anonymous viral and phage genomes newly sequenced. However, we should point out the limitations of ZCURVE_V when predicting genes for viruses that use alternative coding schemes. This includes RNA editing, splicing, polyprotein processing, etc. Generally, like GeneMark, ZCURVE_V cannot deal with the above special cases.",

However the former is Markov-chain-based and mainly considers the local characteristics of DNA sequence, whereas the latter is the Z-curve-based and lays stress on global characteristics. Due to the difference of inherent algorithm, the predictions of ZCURVE_V and GeneMark are different, although most of the predicted genes are identical. Higher accuracy may be obtained by combining them, in which genes predicted by either ZCURVE_V system or the GeneMark VIOLIN database are finally predicted as genes. Clover yellow mosaic virus (CLYMV, NC_001753), lymphocystis disease virus 1 (LCDV-1, NC_001824), ....transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV, NC_002306) and yaba-like disease virus (YLDV, NC_002642) are chosen to demonstrate the effectiveness of joint applications of both systems. The results are listed in Table 6 . As can be seen, the number of genes missed by the ZCURVE_V program decreases significantly although the number of additional predicted genes increases. Currently, it becomes a hotspot to develop an integrated genome annotation platform by joint applications of two or more systems based on different statistic analysis principles [10, 19] . Similarly, joint applications of two or more viral gene-finding programs are also of necessity and feasibility. The programs of ZCURVE_V, GeneMark and others may all be jointed together to reach more accurate results. One referee of the manuscript points out that combining the use of prediction programs based on statistical measures such as ZCURVE_V with detection of functional motifs, sequence similarity, conservation of orthologs, presence of regulatory signals, etc., would be useful. Sequence similarity and conservation of orthologs methods may effectively reduce false positive predictions. Anyway, no one program can be used in isolation for making accurate predictions of the gene complement of any viral genome. Therefore use of multiple programs is always warranted. However, no concrete approach is provided to joint different information into a unified tool to reach the maximum accuracy. It seems that this is a topic of further study, not being included into the present paper.",

It is found that an ORF with the largest length among all others in a genome is very likely to be a protein-coding gene. This ORF is called the 'Maximum ORF' in this paper. After carefully investigating over 100 viral genomes that have annotated genes, the deduction that the 'Maximum ORF' is a gene is valid accurately. For the two very small viral genomes, cereal yellow dwarf virus -RPV satellite RNA (NC_003533) and arabis mosaic virus small satellite RNA (NC_001546), there are no genes at al, indicating that the seed ORF so obtained is meaningless for these two genomes. If the 'Maximum ORF' is larger than 400 bp, it is directly regarded as a seed ORF (gene). However, if the 'Maximum ORF' is less than 400 bp, it is regarded as a seed ORF only if the base composition at the second codon position meets the following equation: G 2 < (A 2 + C 2 + T 2 )/3 + 0.1, where A 2 , C 2 , G 2 and T 2 are the occurrence frequencies of bases at the second position of an ORF. This equation approximately reflects the fact that bases at the second codon position lack guanine to some degree [23] .

Here the same strategy is employed once more, while the related parameters are adjusted because of the change of the definition of coding potential score. Briefly, if the VZ score of the longer ORF between the two overlapping ORFs minus a given value is still larger than that of the shorter one, it is recognized as gene, and the shorter is a non-coding one. Otherwise, both are kept as coding. For more detail, refer to [4] .",

Secondly, no negative samples (non-coding sequences) are required in the training set of the algorithm for ZCURVE_V system. Thirdly, instead of Fisher linear discriminant algorithm, Euclidean distance discriminant method is used here. Due to the adaptation, the ZCURVE_V system is capable of recognizing protein-coding genes in any anonymous viral or phage genomes, even for those shorter than 1000 bp.",
