Smaller groups are generating more sequencing data than they can analyze alone. In order to extract maximal scientific and public health value out of these data, sharing of assembled consensus genomes and raw sequence data is critical. The democratization of genomics takes a village. This is especially true for infectious diseases, where searchable sequence databases allow for real-time tracking of viral epidemics and solving of foodborne bacteria outbreaks [1] [2] [3] . While recent high-profile cases receive the most attention, the fact remains that almost all infectious diseases exist in the context of an ongoing outbreak [1, 4] . In the clinical world, metagenomic analysis pipelines depend on and take advantage of the availability of many infectious disease genomes to allow for faster and accurate alignments [5] [6] [7] . In the basic science world, a graduate student studying the function of a singular protein is greatly assisted by being able to pull the world's history of sequence diversity for that protein before designing experiments [8] .",

First the provided sequences are used as queries for a local BLAST search (default) or an online BLASTn search. After results have been returned a reference annotation is downloaded, if a specific reference accession number is given then this reference is downloaded. Next the original FASTA file is aligned with the reference FASTA and the resulting alignment is used to map the reference annotations onto the new FASTA. Then custom code runs through the file and handles RNA editing, ribosomal slippage and splicing.

Ribosomal slippage allows viruses to produce two proteins from a single mRNA transcript by having the ribosome 'slip' one or two nucleotides along the mRNA transcript, thus changing the reading frame.

In RNA editing, the RNA polymerase co-transcriptionally adds one or two nucleotides that are not on the template. These changes are specifically created during viral mRNA transcription and not during viral genome replication. RNA editing presents an annotation issue because the annotated protein sequence does not match the expected translated nucleotide sequence. To correctly annotate genes with RNA editing, VAPiD parses the reference genome viral species, detects the RNA editing locus, and mimics the RNA polymerase. VAPiD adds the correct number of non-templated nucleotides for the viral species and provides an alternative protein translation. This process is hard-coded for human parainfluenza 2-4, Nipah virus, Sendai virus, measles virus, and mumps virus. Although RNA editing occurs in Ebola virus, references for Ebola virus are annotated in the same way as ribosomal slippage, so code written for ribosomal slippage handles Ebola virus annotations.",

To illustrate this, 30 synthetic viral genomes were created by manually mutagenizing sequences downloaded from NCBI GenBank. Only point mutations that did not lead to stop codons were used and each sequence was given about 10-25 changes depending on the viral genome length, equal to roughly one amino acid change per 1000 nucleotides. The species included were Nipah, Sendai, Measles, Mumps, Parainfluenza 1-4, Ebola, Rotavirus segments, MERS, SARS, Coronavirus 229E, West Nile Virus, HTLV, HIV1, Hepatitis A-C, Hepatitis E, Norovirus, Enterovirus, JC virus, and BK polyomavirus. All genomes were put together into a single FASTA file. Metadata (collection date, country and coverage) for each of the viral genomes was put together into a single csv file. VAPiD was then executed with the command [python vapid.py example.fasta example.sbt --metadata_loc example_metadata.csv]. After running for 123 seconds the program successfully generated 30 complete and correct NCBI submittable annotation files (*.sqn), which could be immediately emailed to NCBI. When these same sequences were run with the online option it took 280 minutes to complete, most of which was waiting for NCBI to return BLAST results. The above example shows how VAPiD would be ideal for busy groups who produce a diverse array of viral sequence such as public health or clinical testing labs.",

Additionally, the syntax is exactly the same to use VAPiD across all operating systems. The single human parainfluenza 3 virus took approximately 2 min to annotate (including waiting about 30 seconds for NCBI blast results to be returned) on a Windows 10 Virtual machine with a single 2.36 GHz core and 2 Gb of RAM. This example highlights how VAPiD can be used to annotate and submit viruses with only two input files (the author template file only needs to be created once) on almost any Mac, Linux, or Windows computer with a Python installation.",

VIGOR is an extremely fast and automatic viral annotator that is able to correctly annotate any number of virus genomes without prior knowledge of viral species or type. VIGOR also is able to correctly handle RNA editing and ribosomal slippageneeding only an input FASTA file with the genome to be annotated, it can produce NCBI compatible .tbl annotation files. VIGOR works natively on Mac and Linux systems. The annotations that VIGOR produces are identical to those created by VAPiD except that VAPiD only anotates CDS regions by default whereas VIGOR will annotate all regions. Two primary advantages VAPiD offers over VIGOR are 1) VAPiD can be installed and run on Windows systems, and 2) VAPiD automates metadata and NCBI submission preparation steps. This fits our intended use case of a public health laboratory that may only own Windows machines and does not want to spend extra time worrying about scripting tbl2asn and manually preparing metadata files. For those with powerful Linux machines and some knowledge of bash scripting we recommend stitching VIGOR and tbl2asn together with custom scripts. However, for those without the infrastructure or time to pursue this path VAPiD offers a reasonable alternative.",

This suite of tools is custom developed for internal Broad Institute users but publicly available and well-documented on GitHub. Viral-ngs takes a reference genome and corresponding annotation file and transfers the reference annotations onto a new genome. This is very similar to the way VAPiD transfers annotation, except viral-ngs requires the user to provide a reference, which avoids the potential problem of low quality references propagating errors. Viral-ngs is well suited for annotating large numbers of the same type of virus all at the same time. Another advantage of viral-ngs is that it contains many tools for going from raw sequencing reads to complete viral genomes. While viral-ngs handles ribosomal slippage and most normal viral genes, because NCBI compatible annotation files do not contain enough information to correctly annotate RNA editing viral-ngs fails in these cases. Outside of cases involving RNA editing VAPiD and viral-ngs produce identical CDS annotations, with viral-ngs transferring all other features. This software, like VAPiD, is also cross platform and could be easily run on a Windows machine with a slightly modified Python installation. The main advantages VAPiD offers over viral-ngs are the ease of batching multiple viral types together and also as with VIGOR, the automated metadata input and NCBI packaging.",

            "text": "As with all software tools and especially gene annotation programs, VAPiD is not without limitations. VAPiD was designed purely to expedite the process of submitting large batches of different human virus genomes from a clinical laboratory. As such, a major limitation is that VAPiD expects a \"complete genome\" to use as a reference to be available for each of the viral sequences submitted to it. VAPiD is not the preferred annotation tool for novel or extremely divergent viral species. However, we find that complete reference genomes are available for most viral species of clinical importance, especially for viruses that are commonly sequenced in clinical or public health laboratories. A further limitation of VAPiD is that it does not perform ab initio gene annotation. Instead VAPiD simply transfers annotations from the closest reference genome with a few quality control steps, such as allowing for slightly different gene lengths and RNA editing. A significant limitation of this strategy is that because the new annotation is generated from a downloaded reference, any errors that are in the downloaded reference will be transferred to the new genome. This means that VAPiD performs best on high-quality and accurate reference sequences. The downside of the VAPiD strategy is that if an inaccurate reference strain is used, error can propagate extremely fast. For example, early in our development we deposited roughly 60 human parainfluenza 3 viruses that had the matrix protein incorrectly annotated as 'matrix potein' [sic] due to a misspelling in the official NCBI reference sequence NC_001796 for HPIV3. To combat this problem, we have included a variety of ways to pull references, including directly specifying the reference. However, due to ease of implementation this functionality only works if all the viruses to be submitted are the same type. For those submitting many viruses of the same type we recommend using this feature to ensure annotation quality. VAPiD also contains code that overwrites misspellings in protein product names using NCBI's ESpell utility. This spell-checking step flags and corrects errors such as the misspelling mentioned above. A helpful message of what was corrected is printed to the console to prevent erroneous corrections. While this takes care of most misspellings, it is not a perfect fix, and viruses that we tested previously could have erroneous references uploaded in the future and further propagate error. It is for this reason that we highly recommend that users inspect and verify the accuracy of their new annotations, which have the potential to be used for future references. ",
