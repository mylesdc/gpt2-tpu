            "text": "Immunological checkpoints, such as the inhibitory CD200 receptor (CD200R), play a dual role in balancing the immune system during microbial infection. On the one hand these inhibitory signals prevent excessive immune mediated pathology but on the other hand they may impair clearance of the pathogen. We studied the influence of the inhibitory CD200-CD200R axis on clearance and pathology in two different virus infection models. We find that lack of CD200R signaling strongly enhances type I interferon (IFN) production and viral clearance and improves the outcome of mouse hepatitis corona virus (MHV) infection, particularly in female mice. MHV clearance is known to be dependent on Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7)-mediated type I IFN production and sex differences in TLR7 responses previously have been reported for humans. We therefore hypothesize that CD200R ligation suppresses TLR7 responses and that release of this inhibition enlarges sex differences in TLR7 signaling. This hypothesis is supported by our findings that in vivo administration of synthetic TLR7 ligand leads to enhanced type I IFN production, particularly in female Cd200 2/2 mice and that CD200R ligation inhibits TLR7 signaling in vitro. In influenza A virus infection we show that viral clearance is determined by sex but not by CD200R signaling. However, absence of CD200R in influenza A virus infection results in enhanced lung neutrophil influx and pathology in females. Thus, CD200-CD200R and sex are host factors that together determine the outcome of viral infection. Our data predict a sex bias in both beneficial and pathological immune responses to virus infection upon therapeutic targeting of CD200-CD200R.",

Lack of inhibition leads to excessive inflammation and autoimmunity and other severe disease symptoms. One of the receptors regulating this balance is CD200 Receptor (CD200R) [1] . CD200R was originally described as a myeloid receptor [2] , being expressed on macrophages, granulocytes and DCs, but later we and others recognized that it is also expressed on T cells, B cells and NK cells [3, 4] . The CD200R intracellular domain is devoid of the classical immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) present in most immune inhibitory receptors but it does have three tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated, one of which is embedded in an NPXY motif. CD200R-downstream signaling is dependent on the recruitment of Dok2 and RasGAP [5] .",

CD200 is expressed on thymocytes, activated T cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), vascular endothelial cells, hair follicular cells, in the central nervous system and in the retina (reviewed in [6] ). Both in mice and humans, CD200 exclusively binds to the inhibitory CD200R. In contrast to humans, the mouse CD200R family contains several activating receptors, but these do not bind CD200 [7] . Cd200 2/2 mice were first described to be more susceptible to autoimmune disorders [8] . Later its role in microbial infections was recognized. Infection of Cd200 2/2 mice with the gram negative N. meningitides causes increased lethality, proinflammatory cytokine production and lymphocyte activation [9] . We and others showed that in mouse influenza A virus infection CD200deficiency aggravates immune pathology [10, 11] . These studies were exclusively performed in female mice. They indicate that CD200-CD200R signaling controls the strength of the initial antimicrobial response and the return to homeostasis. We here studied the influence of CD200-CD200R blockade on clearance and pathology in two different virus infection models, coronavirus and influenza virus, in both male and female mice.",

We monitored viral spread using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) at day 2 and 4 after infection [14, 15] . Interestingly, at both time points we observed a decreased viral spread in female WT mice when compared to males. Moreover, lack of CD200 resulted in a significantly lower level of viral replication in females ( Figure 1A ,B and Figure S1A ,B,C). The viral RNA load in the livers at day 4 was assessed by quantitative PCR and confirmed the imaging results: WT female mice had significantly lower viral RNA levels than WT male mice ( Figure 1C) . Again, CD200-deficiency greatly decreased virus load in female mice. This was confirmed in histological liver sections stained with a monoclonal antibody against MHV (data not shown). The number of focal lesions in the liver, typical for MHV was also lower in female mice and again CD200-deficiency had a significant effect on these lesions only in female mice ( Figure 1D,E) .",

Our observed sex difference in IFN-a production and viral clearance upon MHV infection in mice is likely due to a similar sex bias in TLR7 responses. We hypothesized that CD200R signaling suppresses TLR7 responses in WT mice. Release of this inhibition would further reveal the intrinsically higher TLR7 responses in females and result in more rapid viral clearance. To test this hypothesis, we first administered a TLR7 ligand in vivo. As described previously [18] , intraperitoneal injection of a synthetic TLR7 ligand (imiquimod) leads to rapid release of type I IFN into the circulation. One-hour after injection we only detected significant amounts of IFN-a in the sera of female Cd200 2/2 mice, confirming the notion that CD200R inhibits the intrinsic potential for a higher TLR7 response in females ( Figure 2B ). We sacrificed the mice at 24 hrs after ligand injection, at which time point no serum IFN-a was detectable (data not shown) but type I IFN mRNA could be detected in the livers of these mice. Again, females expressed more IFN-b mRNA than males, with CD200-deficient female mice displaying even more elevated IFN-b mRNA levels ( Figure 2C) . Thus, release of CD200-mediated inhibition leads to increased production of type I IFN in response to TLR7 ligands, particularly in female mice.",

We generated a chimeric construct containing a LAIR-1 receptor in which the intracellular tail was replaced by that of CD200R. This allows for efficient cross-linking using anti-LAIR-1 antibodies to induce signaling via the CD200R cytoplasmic tail. We transfected HEK 293 cells with plasmids encoding a LAIR-1-CD200R chimeric receptor, human TLR7 and a luciferase reporter under control of a NF-kB driven promoter. Cross-linking of the chimeric receptor by anti-LAIR-1 antibody, but not by isotype-matched control antibody, resulted in robust inhibition of imiquimod-induced NF-kB activity ( Figure 3A ). CD200R contains three intracellular tyrosine residues. A chimeric LAIR-1-CD200R protein in which all three tyrosines are mutated to phenylalanine (FFF) did not suppress TLR7 responses upon cross-linking, indicating that the observed inhibitory effect is indeed dependent on CD200R-signaling ( Figure 3A ). In a cell line with stable ectopic expression of TLR7 and transient expression of the NF-kB-reporter and the LAIR-1-CD200R constructs we also observed that TLR7 signaling was inhibited through CD200R-mediated signaling. A similar effect was observed when luciferase expression was driven by an IFN-b promoter ( Figure 3B) . Thus, the enhanced type I IFN production and viral clearance of MHV in female Cd200 2/2 mice can be explained by the release of CD200R-mediated inhibition of the intrinsically higher TLR7 responses in females.",

Immunological checkpoints are provided by immune inhibitory receptors, which set a threshold for activation and dampen the immune system. In the case of a viral infection, this prevents pathology induced by the immune system, but on the other hand may prevent adequate removal of the virus. In this paper, we show that removal of such an immunological checkpoint in mice leads to rapid removal of corona virus, but also to more immuneinduced disease symptoms in case of influenza virus infection. We observe this predominantly in female mice. We demonstrate that this particular checkpoint inhibits anti-viral responses that are naturally stronger in females. Release of this checkpoint enlarges these sex differences. Our findings have major implications for therapeutic use of blockers of this pathway, which are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, as we predict that female patients will have a stronger response to such therapeutics.",

Although male Cd200 2/2 mice lost more weight than WT males, the weight loss started later and the difference was not as prominent ( Figure 4D ). This may indicate that lack of CD200 results in a more severe pathology in females. We observed an increased level of cellular infiltration in lung tissue of females ( Figure S2A ). Therefore we determined lung cellular influx by differential cell count in BAL fluid ( Figure S2B-D) . The total number of cells in BAL fluid was higher in all female groups but differences were not significant ( Figure S2B ). The number of lymphocytes was increased in females of both genotypes ( Figure  S2D ). At day 4 after infection, the number of lymphocytes was increased in females of both WT and Cd2002/2 groups. At day 8, the number of neutrophils in the BAL fluid was decreased in all groups, still the WT females displayed elevated numbers over males. Importantly, lack of CD200 resulted in significantly higher neutrophil counts in females but not in males ( Figure 4E ). As an additional parameter of lung damage we measured the total protein content in the BAL fluid. Lack of CD200 resulted in increased protein levels in the BAL fluid of both males and females, especially at day 8 after infection ( Figure 4F ). Overall these data indicate that female mice experience increased lung pathology upon influenza A virus infection, which is aggravated by the lack of the CD200R-regulatory pathway.",

Sex differences in TLR7 induced type I IFN production have previously been reported for humans [16, 17] and our data show that in mice this has a strong impact on the course of a viral infection. The mechanism for this is not understood. On the one hand, incomplete inactivation of the Tlr7 gene, on the X chromosome, resulting in higher TLR7 expression in females has been proposed [19, 20] . In our experiments, TLR7 mRNA expression was equal in male and female mice ( Figure S3 ). This is consistent with a prior report in which no evidence for escape from X-inactivation of the Tlr7 gene in humans was found [16] . There are conflicting reports concerning the influence of sex hormones on TLR7 responses [16, 17] . Alternatively, sex-dependent epigenetic mechanisms may contribute [16] .",

This suggests that CD200R affects proximal events in the TLR signaling pathway. CD200R is a unique inhibitory receptor, since its intracellular tail does not contain ITIMs. CD200R does contain three intracellular tyrosine residues. Mutation of all three tyrosine completely abrogates its inhibitory function [23] . The most distal tyrosine is located in an NPXY motif, to which the adaptor molecule Dok2 is recruited [24] . Dok 2 activates RasGAP and knockdown of these proteins diminishes the inhibitory action of CD200R [5] . However, the down-stream targets for CD200R mediated inhibition are not yet identified.",

This implies that, for influenza virus, the sexbiased type I IFN production and viral clearance are not regulated by CD200R, while the events leading to increased neutrophil recruitment and lung pathology are. Neutrophil responses to influenza virus infection were shown to be dependent on TLR7 [25] . Since neutrophils express CD200R, the strongly increased neutrophil influx in female Cd200 2/2 mice is in line with our finding that CD200R inhibits sex-biased TLR7 responses. In contrast to MHV infection, clearance of influenza A virus is not dependent on plasmacytoid dendritic cells [26] . Although influenza RNA triggers TLR7 [27] , the main source of type I IFN is the infected respiratory epithelium [28] . These cells do not express CD200R and hence are not influenced by CD200-deficiency, explaining the lack of effect of CD200-deficiency on type I IFN production.",

We are the first to demonstrate a strong sex bias in type I IFN production and viral clearance in mice utilizing two different models of virus infection. This is of importance for scientists studying these widely used models and may result in a completely different interpretation of data obtained, depending on the sex of the mice used. Moreover, sex biased clinical responses to virus infections have been reported in humans [31] . For influenza A virus (H5N1) a significantly enhanced case-fatality rate was found in women [32] . In agreement with these findings we now show increased lung damage, enhanced neutrophil influx and elevated IL-8, IL-6 levels in BAL fluid of female mice upon influenza A virus infection. A few reports discuss the possibility of a sex bias in severity of SARS-CoV infection [33, 34] . Also for HIV-1 infection, sex-related differences have been well-established [35, 36] . Our results underscore the importance of the issue of sex bias in scientific research, clinical trails, and vaccine studies, previously raised by others [19, 37] . Particularly, CD200 blocking antibodies are currently entering clinical trials for cancer treatment. Our data point to a possible pathological outcome of e.g. influenza virus infection in women as a result of CD200 blocking therapies.",

A chimeric construct containing the extra cellular region of human LAIR-1 (amino acids 1-160) fused with the transmembrane and intracellular rat CD200R (rCD200R) (amino acids 236-327) was cloned into pcDNA3.1/zeo (Invitrogen, Breda, the Netherlands). A tyrosine (Y) to phenylalanine (F) mutant of tyrosines 287, 290, and 298 in the intracellular rCD200R tail were generated with PCR-based mutagenesis. The mutant was cloned into the same vector and all sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The LAIR-CD200R plasmid was co-transfected with the TLR7 and reporter constructs. Twentyfour hours after transfection cells were trypsinized and seeded in 48-well plates coated with 3 ug/ml anti-LAIR-1 monoclonal antibody (clone 8A8). Forty-eight hrs after transfection cells were stimulated with imiquimod 3 mg/ml (Invivogen) in PBS. On the next day, cells were lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), luciferase activity was measured on a luminometer (Berthold technologies Centro LB 960), and data were analyzed with Microwin software. Total protein content was determined with a Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific). All luciferase values were normalized to protein concentration. Alternatively, we used HEK 293 cells stably expressing human TLR7 (Invivogen).",
