We develop a large-scale simulation-driven optimization model for generating dynamic predictive distribution of vaccines and antivirals over a network of regional pandemic outbreaks. The model incorporates measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, translated into the cost of lost productivity and medical expenses. The performance of the strategy is compared to that of the reactive myopic policy, using a sample outbreak in Fla, USA, with an affected population of over four millions. The comparison is implemented at different levels of vaccine and antiviral availability and administration capacity. Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the impact of variability of some critical factors on policy performance. The model is intended to support public health policy making for effective distribution of limited mitigation resources.",

Predicting the exact virus subtype remains a difficult task, and even when identified, reaching an adequate vaccine supply can currently take up to nine months [4, 5] . Even if the existing vaccines prove to be potent, their availability will be limited by high production and inventory costs [6, 7] and also will be constrained by the supply of antiviral drugs, healthcare providers, hospital beds, medical supplies, and logistics. Hence, pandemic mitigation will have to be done amidst limited availability of resources and supporting infrastructure.

One of the most notable among these efforts is a 2006-07 initiative by MIDAS [42] , which cross-examined independent simulation models of PI spread in rural areas of Asia [43, 44] , USA and UK [45, 46] , and the city of Chicago [47] , respectively. MIDAS crossvalidated the models by simulating the city of Chicago, with 8.6M inhabitants and implementing a targeted layered containment [48, 49] . The research findings of MIDAS and some other groups [12, 33] were used in a recent \"Modeling Community Containment for Pandemic Influenza\" report by IOM, to formulate a set of recommendations for PI mitigation [50] . These findings were also used in a pandemic preparedness guidance developed by CDC [51] .",

As the pandemic spreads from region to region, the optimization model distributes mitigation resources, including stockpiles of vaccines and antiviral and administration capacities (Section 2.3). The model seeks to minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks, using measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, translated into the cost of lost productivity and medical expenses. The methodology is calibrated and implemented on a sample outbreak in Fla, USA with over 4M inhabitants (Section 3). The strategy is compared to the reactive myopic policy, which allocates resources from one actual outbreak region to the next, each time trying to cover the entire regional population at risk, regardless of the resource availability. The comparison is done at different levels of vaccine and antiviral availability and administration capacity. We also present a sensitivity analysis for assessing the impact of variability of some critical factors, including: (i) antiviral efficacy, (ii) social distancing conformance, and (iii) CDC response delay.",

We adopted a CDC guidance [51] , which establishes five categories of pandemic severity and recommends quarantine and closure options according to the category. The categories are determined based on the value of the case fatality ratio (CFR), the proportion of fatalities in the total infected population. For CFR values lower than 0.1% (Category 1), voluntary at-home isolation of infected cases is implemented. For CFR values Influenza Research and Treatment 5 between 0.1% and 1.0% (Categories 2 and 3), in addition to at-home isolation, the following measures are recommended: (i) voluntary quarantine of household members of infected cases and (ii) child and adult social distancing. For CFR values exceeding 1.0% (Categories 4 and 5), all the above measures are implemented. As the effectiveness of social distancing is affected by some of the behavioral factors listed above [54] , we assume a certain social distancing conformance level. Travel restrictions considered in the model included regional air and land border control for infected travelers. Figure 2 , the optimization model is invoked at the beginning of every nth new regional outbreak epoch (n = 1, 2, . . .), starting from the initial outbreak region (n = 1). The objective of the model is to allocate some of the available mitigation resources to the new outbreak region (actual distribution) while reserving the rest of the quantities for potential outbreak regions (virtual distribution). By doing so, the model seeks to progressively minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks, spreading from the ongoing locations. Mitigation resources can include stockpiles of vaccines and antivirals, administration capacity, hospital beds, medical supplies, and social distancing enforcement resources, among others. The predictive mechanism of the optimization model is based on a set of regression equations obtained using single-region simulation models. In what follows, we present the construction of the optimization model and explain the solution algorithm for the overall simulation-based optimization methodology.",

IAR is defined as the ratio of the total number of infections over the pandemic period to the size of the initial susceptible population. To determine R 0 , all infected cases inside the simulation were classified by generation of infection, as in [33, 43] . The value of R 0 was calculated as the average reproduction number of a typical generation in the early stage of the pandemic, with no interventions implemented (the baseline scenario) [33] . Historically, R 0 values for PI ranged between 1.4 and 3.9 [37, 43] . To attain similar values, we calibrated the hourly contact rates of mixing groups [77] (original rates were adopted from [46] ). For the four regions, the average baseline value of R 0 was 2.54, which represented a high transmissibility scenario. The values of regional baseline IAR averaged 0.538.",

For both policies, as the total resource availability approaches the total resource requirement (starting from approximately 60%), the impact numbers show a converging behavior, whereby the marginal utility of additional resource availability diminishes. This behavior can be explained by noting that the total resource requirements were determined assuming the worst case scenario when all (four) regions would be affected and ought to provided with enough resources to cover their respective regional populations at risk. It can also be seen that on average, the DPO policy outperforms the myopic approach at all levels, which can attest to a more efficient resource utilization achieved by the DPO policy (see also Table 6 ). The difference in the policy performance is particularly noticeable at the lower levels of resource availability, and it gradually diminishes, as the resource availability increases and becomes closer to be sufficient to cover the entire populations at risk in all regions. It can also be noted that the variability in the performance of the DPO strategy is generally smaller than that of the myopic policy. In general, for both strategies, the performance variability decreases with higher availability of resources.",

We have used all four regions, separately, as initial outbreak regions for each type of sensitivity analysis. The results (patterns) were rather similar. Due to limited space, we have opted to show the results for only one initial region, chosen arbitrarily, for each of the three types of sensitivity studies. While Duval County was selected as the initial outbreak region to show the sensitivity results on antiviral efficacy, Hillsborough and Miami Dade were used as the initial regions to show the results on, respectively, social distancing conformance and CDC response delay. Figure 8 depicts the sensitivity of the average total cost and average total deaths to antiviral efficacy values between 0% and 80%. As expected, for both policies, the curves for the average number of deaths exhibit a decreasing trend which is almost linear for the values of \u03c4 between 0% and 40%.

In contrast, the DPO model distributes resources trying to balance the impact of actual outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks. It does so by exploiting regionspecific effectiveness of mitigation resources and dynamic reassessment of pandemic spread probabilities, using a set of regression submodels. Hence, we believe that in scenarios involving regions with a more heterogeneous demographics, the DPO policy will likely to perform even better and with less variability than the myopic strategy. We also note that the difference in the model performance was particularly noticeable at lower levels of resource availability, which is in accordance with a higher marginal utility of additional availability at that levels. We thus believe that the DPO model can be particularly useful in scenarios with very limited resources.",

The simulation features a flexible design which can be particularized to a broader range of PHI and NPI and even more granular mixing groups.",

The tool is intended to assist public health decision makers in implementing what-if analysis for assessment of mitigation options and development of policy guidelines. Examples of such guidelines include vaccine and antiviral risk groups, social distancing policies (e.g., thresholds for declaration/lifting and closure options), and travel restrictions.",

            "text": "Limitations of the model. Lack of reliable data prevented us from considering geo-spatial aspects of mixing group formation. We also did not consider the impact of public education and the use of personal protective measures (e.g., face masks) on transmission, again due to a lack of effectiveness data [91] . We did not study the marginal effectiveness of individual resources due to a considerable uncertainty about the transmissibility of an emerging pandemic virus and efficacy of vaccine and antiviral. For the same reason, the vaccine and antiviral risk groups considered in the testbed can be adjusted, as different prioritization schemes have been suggested. The form of social distancing implemented in the testbed can also be modified as a variety of schemes can be found in the literature, including those based on geographical and social targeting. Effectiveness of these approaches is substantially influenced by the compliance factor, for which limited accurate data support exists. It will thus be vital to gather the most detailed data on the epidemiology of a new virus and the population dynamics early in the evolution of a pandemic, and expeditiously analyze the data to adjust the interventions accordingly.",
