Two forms of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) have been identified that are parasite dependent. The first one Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (T. b. gambiense) causes a human chronic infection, endemic in Western and Central Africa while the other Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (T. b. rhodesiense) has a vast animal reservoir and causes acute illness in people in eastern and Southern African countries. HAT has high occurance in the remote rural areas, where the surveillance is weak or nonexistent, with 50 to 70 thousand estimated cases. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimation there are half-million cases of HAT or \"sleeping sickness\" resulting from infections with T. brucei rhodesiense and T. brucei gambiense. WHO has attributed 50.000 deaths annually to the disease [1] . By more recent estimates, up to 25.000 new cases occur per year, and 50 million people are at risk [2, 3] .",

Because suramin and pentamidine are ionized at physiological pH, they are unable to cross the blood brain barrier in therapeutic concentrations and are thus used for the treatment of hemolymphatic early stage HAT, caused by T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense infections, respectively. The treatment of the second or neurological stage, when the parasites invade the central nervous system (CNS), relies on the organoarsenical drug melarsoprol and the more recently registered eflornithine. The latter is ineffective against T. b. rhodesiense sleeping sickness and is used primarily to control CNS-involved HAT caused by T. b. gambiense. All the existing anti-trypanosomal therapies suffer from unacceptable toxicity, poor efficacy, difficulties of administration, and increasing treatment failures due to the development of parasite resistance [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . In the last couple of decades, no new drug has been developed for treatment of early-stage HAT, and only one drug has been developed for late-stage HAT [1, 3, 5] . The need is great for new orally active drugs for the control and eradication of this disease.",

Compared to the last 15 years there has been a revival of drug research and development regarding neglected parasitic diseases, and a number of drug development projects are currently ongoing [11] . In view of this, the researchers have endeavored to compile in the present section of the review, diverse series of compounds that have been recently synthesized by various research groups targeting DNA minor groove and many other new targets. Based on the mechanism of action this section has been divided into two sub-sections. The first sub-section includes the series of compounds acting as DNA minor groove binders while in the second sub-section are included all the other anti-trypanosomal compounds and their respective targets. Also are described herein prodrug approaches to provide oral bioavailability for the dication class.",

The aromatic diamidines i.e. pentamidine ( Figure 1) show their anti-parasitic action by binding strongly to AT-rich sequences in the minor groove of DNA. Therefore DNA minor groove has evolved as a productive target for designing new ant-parasitic drugs. In order to design newer analogues belonging to diamidine series, studies of the DNA complexes with diamidine compounds have been conducted and a number of diamidines have been crystallized with the DNA duplex d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 which provide valuable models for drug development in the diamidine series. Structures of DNA complexes of furamidine, berenil, and pentamidine, for example, reveal that they all bind in the DNA minor groove at the central AATT sequence. These drugs penetrate deeply into the groove and fit snugly between the walls of the groove. Their amidines form H-bonds with thymine-O2 and/or adenine-N3 acceptor groups on the edges of the bases at the floor of the groove. The amino group of G protrudes into the minor groove and prevents the compounds from assuming their preferred orientation deep in the minor groove. This binding to DNA eventually leads to inhibition of one or more of the several DNA-dependent enzymes (e.g., topoisomerases and nucleases) or direct inhibition of transcription.",

On comparing the activities of the synthesized compounds with pentamidine and melarsoprol, it was found that few compounds showed activity in the range or better than that of pentamidine and/or melarsoprol. The unsubstituted diamidine compound 64 ( Figure 3a ) with secondary amino group in place of oxygen atom exhibited subnanomolar activity (<0.001 \u00b5M) against T. b. rhodesiense and was nearly twice as selective against the pathogen as pentamidine. At the same time the diimidazoline compound 66 (Figure 3b ) exhibited the second highest anti-trypanosomal activity in the series with the IC 50 value of 0.001 \u00b5M and also had the highest parasite selectivity (SI T = 34500), being 63 times more selective against T. b. rhodesiense than pentamidine. The replacement of oxygen atom with sulphur atom as in compound 62 ( Figure 3c ) also generated active congeners having IC 50 (0.005 \u00b5M) value better than that of pentamidine (0.007 \u00b5M). The compounds 20-31 ( Figure 2c ) in which the cationic groups were present in the 3,3\u2032-position of the aromatic rings and the length of the carbon linker was varied from 3-6 exhibited lower anti-trypanosomal activity compared to pentamidine whereas among the compounds 12-19 ( Figure 2b ) of the series, in which the amidine groups were present at 4,4' position and the length of aliphatic chain was varied from three carbon atoms to six carbon atoms, compound 12 ( Figure 3d , IC 50 =0.007 \u00b5M) with three methylene linker between the aromatic rings had same in vitro activity as that of pentamidine (0.007 \u00b5M). Further introduction of 2,2\u2032-dichloro substituent in compound 12 improved the antitrypanosomal properties as evident from the in vitro activity of compound 32 (Figure 3e , IC 50 =0.004 \u00b5M).",

This replacement resulted in series of 18 compounds (Figure 4a ), most of which had lower cytotoxicity than pentamidine. SAR study pointed out that the antiprotozoal properties of these compounds depended on the placement of cationic moieties on the pyridine rings as well as the nature of substituents on the amidine groups. The N-substituted congeners were lesser cytotoxic than the unsubstituted diamidines whereas the N-alkylation of cationic fragments reduces the activity of compounds against T. brucei rhodesiense compared to pentamidine. A same trend was observed in pentamidine analogues series. The 2, 6-substituted dications (compounds 11-13, figure 4a ) and 2,4-substituted dications (compounds 14-18, figure 4a ) displayed lower potencies against T. brucei rhodesiense than the corresponding 2,5-substituted isomers (compounds 1-10, figure 4a), while among the 2, 5-substituted dications, the compounds possessing cationic substituents adjacent to nitrogen atoms in pyridine rings displayed superior activities against parasites compared to pentamidine as evident from compound 6 (figure 4b) which showed promising anti-trypanosomal activity (0.001\u00b5M) and lower cytotoxicity (4.90\u00b5M) than pentamidine and melarsoprol, but had poor in vivo activity giving only 1/4 cures in the STIB900 mouse model. However diamidoxime compound 9 (Figure 4c ), an oral prodrug of diamidine compound 6 ( Figure  4b ), exhibited excellent in vivo activity curing four out of four animals upon oral administration in STIB900 mouse model. Although compound 9 did not provide cure in the CNS mouse model of infection but its BBB permeability could potentially be improved by developing prodrug using lipophillic substitutions in place of hydrophilic substitution as used in compound 9. This could provide higher concentration of compound 6 in CNS.",

The structure activity relationship of the two series indicates that in both the cases the unsubstituted diamidines were more active than the N-substituted diamidines. The replacement of oxygen atoms in alkyl chain with secondary amino group improves the activity against T. b. rhodesiense of pentamidine analogues while in case of pyridyl analogue the compounds with oxygen atoms in the alkyl chain have been the active one. The most potent compound of these two series are compound 6 ( Figure 4b ) and compound 66 (Figure 3b ), which have excellent in vitro activity (0.001\u00b5M) better than pentamidine and melarsoprol and also have high selective against the T. b. rhodesiense parasite as evident from their selectivity index (SI of compound 6 = 4900 and compound 66 = 34500 \u00b5M). Initially it has been believed that the oxygen atom in the aliphatic linker and the amidine groups are important for anti-trypanosomal activity of pentamidine as these groups were part of recognition motif for P2 amino purine transporter in trypanosoma species. Thus the activity of compound 6 can be explained on this basis, but in case of compound 66 the amidine groups have been replaced by imidazoline and the oxygen atom has been replaced by secondary amino groups. Despite these replacements, the compound has shown excellent in vitro and in vivo activity. Thus this is in accordance to recently reported work [29] according to which there is no direct connection between the affinity for P2 carrier and anti-trypanosomal activity.",

The in vitro activity of the bisbenzofuran series was not so promising and only lead compound 8, (Figure 5b ) exhibited in vitro anti-trypanosomal activity (0.008 \u00b5M) comparable to that of pentamidine and melarsoprol.

Thus promising in vitro, anti-trypanosomal activity, excellent potency in the acute mouse model of trypanosomiasis and the reduced cytotoxicity (1.9 \u00b5M) of compound 1 compared to pentamidine warrants further pre-clinical and clinical trials of this molecule. While compound 32 and 20 can serve as lead compounds for further SAR optimization to derive congener with enhanced activity and lesser cytotoxicity. ",

However the precise mechanism by which these compounds show their anti-trypanosomal activity in not known. Among the three series the 2-phenylbenzofuran derivatives are attractive molecules because of their high activity, low cytotoxicity and high selectivity against the HAT parasite. The introduction of phenoxy fragment into the aromatic ring protects the phenylbenzofuran dervatives from metabolic deactivation. This structural modification retains affinity for the aminopurine P2 transporter. The diamidine and the hydroxy or methoxy group may be involved in binding to the DNA minor groove.

Two other analogues of furamidine (Figure 11b &c) have been evaluated against T. b. rhodesiense mouse model and have shown promising results. One approach to enhance the activity of furamidine has been the replacement of the central furan ring with other heterocyclic systems, including thiophene, pyrrole, oxazole, oxadiazole, thiadiazole, pyridazine, methylpyrimidine, and triazine [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] .

High through put screening (HTS) which resulted into identification of two novel compound series active against the enzyme trypanothione reductase. Series 1 was based on the quinoline scaffold (Figure 18a ) in which compound 2 (Figure 19a) with methylfuran group at R 3 position, Br at 6 th position of quinoline ring and N-methylethanamine group at R 1 position was the most potent and significant TR inhibitor with TR inhibitory activity of 1.1 \u00b5M. According to SAR study the replacement of methylfuran with other groups like furan, phenyl, pyridinyl, thiophene led to decrease in activity. Also the replacement of Br with H or F reduced the activity while Cl group retained the activity. At 4 th position the NH and NMe groups were equally active. The alkylamines at R 1 were active whereas the simple alkyl or aryl groups led to inactive compounds. The second series was based on the pyrimidopyridazine scaffold (Figure 18b) , in which the compound 49 ( Figure 19b ) showed promising inhibitory activity of 2.6 \u00b5M. In case of series 2 replacement of methyl group at R 1 position by H led to the decrease in activity. At R 2 position methyl and ethyl group showed activity while the H and chain extensions to propyl, butyl and cyclopentane led to decrease in activity. Substituted phenyl and alkenylphenyl group at R 3 position gave the most active compound of the series. Thus these quinoline compounds with promising activity could serve as lead compounds for further development of targeted drugs against African trypanosomiasis. In addition to this synthetic optimization study based on the lead anti-trypanosomal compound 1,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinolin-6-yl 3,5-dimethoxybenzoate ( Figure 20 ) was undertaken by Werbovetz KA et al [61] in an attempt to discover new trypanocides with potent in vivo activity targeting TR enzyme. In course of this a total of 53 compounds were evaluated in vitro for their anti-trypanosomal activity and cytotoxicity. The compounds with oxygen atom at 6 th position were the most active compounds in the series, for example compound 9 ( Figure 21 ) showed better anti-trypanosomal activity (0.007 \u00b5M) and low cytotoxicity (6.8 \u00b5M) than melarsoprol (IC 50 = 0.008\u00b5M and cytotoxicity = 7.9\u00b5M). Whereas compounds lacking the 6-oxygen atom or bearing an oxygen atom at the 7-position rather than the 6-position were far less potent than those containing an alcohol or acyloxy group at the 6-position. Compounds carrying aliphatic or a 2-phenylacetyl ester side chains were as potent and selective as their benzoylated or acetylated counterparts. However compound 9a was unstable due to auto-oxidation, so the unstable alcohols were esterified to generate prodrug 10a ( Figure 21 ) having promising activity of 0.014\u00b5M against these parasites and a selectivity index of 1700. The in vivo evaluation of compound 10a in a murine model of African trypanosomiasis showed good results as the prodrug extended the lifespan of mice infected with T. b. brucei.",

The compound 12 ( Figure 23 ) with propylamino group at R 6 position and methoxy group at R 2 , R 3 and R 9 was the most active one with in vitro anti-trypanosomal activity of 0.05 \u00b5M. The compound also showed good in vivo activity as it delayed parasitemia and extended survival in infected mice. According to structure-activity analysis the compounds with enhanced potency included alkylamino substitutions on N-6, methoxy groups on C-2 and C-3, and a methylenedioxy bridge between C-8 and C-9. Testing of indenoisoquinolines with promising activity on L1210 mouse leukemia cells revealed all the compounds were more effective against trypanosomes than against mammalian cells. The indenoisoquinolines also showed appreciable water solubility indicating that these compounds have good quality for drug development. These compounds showed their anti-trypanosomal action by multiple mechanisms. The study indicated that they stabilize topoisomerase-DNA complexes in situ and may also impede topoisomerase binding to DNA. These agents markedly inhibited DNA synthesis by interfering with topoisomerase and possibly other DNA-metabolizing enzymes. concentrations in the range of 300 ng/ml up to 900 ng/ml. Some of the DuPont compounds, developed as anti-tumour drugs, were highly active but also showed high cytotoxicity on HT-29 cells. It was observed that the position R 1 and position R 2 in the quinolone core nucleus was not prerequisite for anti-trypanosomal activity and also substitution at R 8 position was not necessary for trypanocidal activity. Thus, based on the result obtained from SAR analysis special attention should be given to R 7 position and the tetracyclic derivatives. The in vivo results of these compounds were very poor, as none of the compounds evaluated produced cure of mice in dose escalation experiment up to 100mg/kg i.p. However no signs of toxicity were observed during the experiments. The in vivo ineffectiveness had not been explained and no drug level determination in the plasma of the treated mice was performed.

The major drawbacks of DFMO are its cost, the duration of treatment and its availability. Recent clinical studies have investigated that DMFO can be used in combination with clinically used trypanocides including suramin, nifurtimox and melarsoprol [73, 74] . These combinations result in significant reduction in DFMO dosage and time of administration. Initial clinical study has shown that DFMO + nifurtimox are superior to DFMO + melarsoprol and melarsoprol + nifurtimox. The DFMO + nifurtimox regimen (NECT regimen) allowed reduction in DFMO regimen from 14 to 7 days (56 versus 28 infusions) with a 94% cure rate and are associated with significantly reduced adverse side effects as compared to melarsoprol-based therapy. The success of the combined regimen has been most likely due to ability of DMFO to reduce trypanothione levels and resistance to oxidative stress and the ability of nifurtimox to generate oxidative stress. Recently Gilbert et al [76] designed, synthesized, and evaluated substituted polyamines, carrying 1,3,5-triazine units, as potential anti-trypanosomal drugs. Preliminary results indicated that this route might be successful, and lead structure A (Figure 26 ) was used as a starting point for the synthesis of two series of analogues. In the first series, the influence of structural changes of the central core unit was investigated while in the second series, the effect of additional methyl substituents on the 1,3,5-triazine was studied. The compounds were designed with the intention to selectively target the interior of T. brucei via the P2 amino-purine transporter. In the first series the compound containing the ndodecyl chain as core unit, showed weak activity against T. b. rhodesiense. The compound with n-nonyl chain was the most promising compound and its various analogues were designed by replacing NH 2 groups on the triazine ring with NHMe and NMe 2 groups. Introduction of one or two methyl groups per triazine unit resulted in a 10fold increase in anti-trypanosomal activity. When four methyl groups per triazine unit were introduced, an 80-fold increase in activity was observed. Similarly, replacement of NH 2 group in n-dodecyl chain led to 2-20-fold higher anti-trypanosomal activity for the methylated derivatives. Monosubstituted compounds showed a slight increase in activity against T. b. rhodesiense as compared to the disubstituted compounds. The methylamino substituted triazines attached to the C9-(compound 8c, Figure 27 ) or C12-(compound 8f, Figure 27 ) polyamine precursor via an additional CH 2 linker resulted in most active trypanocidal compounds(IC 50 of 8c = 0.27\u00b5M and 8f = 0.18 \u00b5M). Beside good activity, the compounds showed poor in vivo activity producing no cure to the infected mice and concentrations greater than 10 mg kg \u22121 induced severe acute toxicity. The actual mode of action for the reported triazine substituted polyamines remains unclear. So to understand and improve the activities of these compounds, further research has to verify intracellular drug targets and possible metabolic pathways.",

This class of 6-N-cyclopropyl adenosine analogues modified at carbon 5', does not exhibit an inhibitory effect on human or parasite forms of the enzyme and displays only marginal antiviral activity in comparison to analogues which have been unmodified at 6-amino position (that are potent inhibitor of AdoHcy hydrolase). Therefore these compounds require further structural modification in order to develop newer analogues with improved activity against T. brucei.",

The two compounds, 4-[3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]morpholine (1.0\u00b5M) ( Figure 29a ) and 1-[3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]piperazine (1.1 \u00b5M) (Figure 29b ) with a pyrazol ring, are the most potent anti-trypanosomals of the series and have same cytotoxicity (61.6 \u00b5M), indicating that the pyrazol ring is very important for anti-trypanosomal activity. The substitution of pyrazol ring with isoxazole derivative leads to a six fold reduction in activity as compared to the most potent compound. In addition, substitution with nitrophenyl or aminophenyl also results in strong reduction in activity. The phenoxy ring in the compounds is also important for activity as replacing it by an ethylene group results in nine fold reduction in efficacy. Further substitution with a nitro group or an amino group reduces potency up to 4-fold or 18-fold respectively. The stage specific action of these compounds is unknown. Further optimization of this class of compounds is required in order to lower the cytotoxicity profile of the compound. ",

The latest technological advances (QSAR, structure-based design, ligand-based design, cheminformatics & bioinformatics) are providing a much improved basis for the design of ligands and inhibitors with desired specificity. Recently, computerassisted drug design approaches based on ligand-based and structure-based drug design have been successfully employed to develop new drugs for the treatment of cancer, AIDS and other diseases [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] . QSAR [97] has been widely used for years to provide quantitative analysis of structure and activity relationships of compounds. Our core research group has also performed QSAR analysis of dicationic diphenylisoxazoles [10] . In this study, attempt has been to investigate the relationship between the various physiochemical parameters and anti-trypanosomal activity of dicationic 3,5-diphenylisoxazoles that may be helpful in development of potent antitrypanosomal agents against sleeping sickness.",

The developed model has been validated by leave-one-out method of cross-validation and prediction of test set. The study indicates that the anti-trypanosomal activity is largely explained by cosmic energy, log P and total lipole descriptors. The QSAR study has reported in present study provides important structural insights, related to anti-trypanosomal activity. Authors have developed a validated and highly predictive model sharing important structural requirement for effective binding of anti-trypanosomal compounds to minor groove of T. b. rhodesiense DNA. The model reported in the study should be helpful in development of new compounds with improved efficacy and oral bioavailability. In line to the developed model authors have also designed some molecules which showed good activity in silico. The further study of these compounds is in progress.",

The unacceptable truth is the lack of attention of the government and less interest of pharmaceutical companies in light of less monitory gain in the area of protozoal infection since most of the affected people belong to poorer country. Surprisingly the endeavors of different research group discussed in this review belong to academic institutions. It is felt by the researchers that the treatment for HAT requires a combined approach by government organization, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. The most promising fact is that in the last decade several synthetic approaches have been made in the field of development of anti-trypanosomal therapies. Several compounds are being synthesized that yield new compounds for the treatment of HAT, as a result of these synthetic approaches newer leads have been identified, which are under different phase of drug development.",

The most important one is the newer analogous of existing drugs pentamidine (compounds 32, Figure 3e and 66, Figure 3b ) which shows excellent in vivo and in vitro activity (0.004 and 0.001 \u03bcM respectively) and also has very good selectivity index against the parasite but is cytotoxic. In an attempt to synthesise newer compounds with reduced cytotoxicity than pentamidine molecules, several benzofuran derivatives have been synthesized. However the replacement of phenoxy fragement of pentamidine with a benzofuran motif has resulted in poor analogues with lower antitrypanosomal activity but improved cytotoxic profile. However the strong activity against T. b. rhodesiense isolates indicates that steps should be taken to initiate further studies of compound 66 and compound 32 which can be further evolved as new lead compound. The newer analogues of furamidine also show promising anti-trypanosomal activity along with lower cytotoxicity than furamidine. Thus strong activity against T. b. rhodesiense and lower cytotoxicity of compound 3 (Figure 13b ) indicates that these compounds should be further evaluated. Thus the DNA minor grove binders are still the most interesting and potential target for the development of newer anti-trypanosomal agents.",

Six compounds (Figure 9) among the series including lead compound 1 (Figure 6a) exhibited excellent in vitro and in vivo anti-trypanosomal activity and were highly selective for the T. b. rhodesiense parasite. All the six active compounds contained diamidine groups, which clearly suggested that diamidines exhibited higher anti-trypanosomal activities compared to di(N-isopropyl)amidines and diimidazolines. The 5,-substituted dicationic compounds 29 (IC 50 =0.002 \u00b5M, Figure 9e) and 32 (IC 50 =0.002 \u00b5M, Figure 9c) showed better antitrypanosomal activity than the 6-substituted dicationic compound 38 (IC 50 =0.003 \u00b5M, Figure 9d). Whereas among the 5,5' substituted diamidines and 5,4' substituted diamidine, selectivity against the parasite of 5,5\u2032-substituted dications was higher than 5,4\u2032-substituted congeners. Introduction of the hydroxy substituents in the 7-or 2\u2032-position of compound 1 (Figure 6a) resulted into compound 20 (Figure 9a) and compound 32 (Figure 9c) with enhanced anti-trypanosomal activity and higher selectivity against T. b. rhodesiense. These dicationic compounds were further evaluated in the STIB900 animal model of African trypanosomiasisn. Only compounds 1, 32 and 20 showed exclellent in vivo activity providing 3/4 and 4/4 cures respectively when administered intraperitoneally.",

However compound 46 (Figure 15) with dicationic moiety at 4,4' position showed excellent in vitro activity (0.004 \u00b5M). The introduction of the hydroxy group in the 2-position of the phenyl ring significantly reduced activities and increased the cytotoxcity against T. brucei rhodesiense because of the formation of the intramolecular hydrogen bond between the hydrogen atom of the 2-hydroxy group and the 2-nitrogen of the triazole ring. The in vivo analysis of compound 46 showed that when administered at 4 \u00d7 5 mg/kg, 4 \u00d7 1 mg/kg and 1 \u00d7 10 mg/kg by the intraperitoneal route it cured all the infected animals in the acute mouse model of African trypanosomiasis.

Once validated, the findings can be used to predict activities of untested compounds. Though only countable but sustainable attempts has been made to build molecular model in the field of HAT, exemplified by the work of Prashanth A et al[98] who have performed 3D QSAR analysis on a library of heterocyclic diamidines derivatives with antiparasitic activity and Martin MB et at[99] who have performed CoMFA analysis on bisphosphonates against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.Prashanth A et al have performed CoMFA and CoMSIA based 3D QSAR analysis on furamidine and a set of 25 other structurally related compounds. The main goal of this study has been to correlate the structural features of this class of compounds with their biological activity using the knowledge of the DNA minor groove bioreceptor in AT sequences.Two different alignment strategies, based on a putative kinetoplast DNA minor groove target, have been used. Due to conserved electrostatic properties across the compounds, models that used only steric and electronic properties have not performed well in predicting biological results. An extended CoMSIA model with additional descriptors for hydrophobic, donor, and acceptor properties have had good predictive ability with a q 2 = 0.699, r 2 = 0.974, SEE, standard error of estimate = 0.1, and F = 120.04. The results have been used as a guide to design compounds that, potentially, have better activity against African trypanosomes.These specifically derived chemical properties that are important to activity and in view of this, the developed model can be adopted as a rational approach toward the selection of substituents at various positions in the scaffold. The information can be used to predict new compounds for synthesis that have high probability of enhanced activity.Martin MB et at have been the first to provide evidence that the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase is a principal site of action of the bisphosphonate risedronate in inhibiting the growth of bloodstream-form T. b. rhodesiense trypomastigotes, the causative agent of human East African trypanosomiasis. They have also reported 3D-QSAR/CoMFA analysis of 26 bisphosphonates, yielding a theoretical-versus-experimental pIC50 correlation of R 2 = 0.87 with a cross-validated R 2 value of 0.79. This has been the first report of a QSAR/CoMFA correlation for 1,1-bisphosphonates acting as antiparasitic agents. These results should be of use in the design and further development of bisphosphonates as antiparasitic agents.Daunes and D'Silva[100] have performed QSAR analysis in order to derive the contribution of Log P and Es to the in vitro antiprotozoal activity of glutathione derivatives. Analysis of the inhibition data (ED 50 ) vs calculated log P and Es values provided evidence to support membrane penetration and steric factors as the key component in the activity of these compounds. The optimum values for log P and Es determined have been 5.8 and \u22120.70, respectively. The best linear QSAR equation derived by a process of elimination, using a set of 17 compounds, excluding the outliers is eq 1 with an R 2 = 0.84 and F= 12.0 Equation 1 indicates that the therapeutic activity of these compounds decreases with increasing values of log P and Es.",
