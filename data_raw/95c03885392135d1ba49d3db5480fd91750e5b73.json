The best strategy to reduce the burden of influenza is through vaccination whose efficacy varies with respect to the circulating strains. This study was performed to better understand the molecular evolution of influenza A(H3N2) and assess vaccine efficacy in Cameroon. Complete sequences of three gene segments were obtained from 2014 to 2016 influenza seasons in Cameroon. Hemagglutinin (HA), Neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) genes of 35 A(H3N2) virus strains were amplified and sequenced. Predicted vaccine efficacy was measured using the P epitope model. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene showed that all Cameroonian strains had evolved away from the 3C.",

            "text": "Influenza A virus is a major cause of acute respiratory disease in humans and is responsible for approximately 250,000-500,000 deaths annually worldwide [1] . Pandemic influenza A virus infection resulted in significant morbidity and mortality in 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2), and 2009 (H1N1) [2, 3] . The first outbreak of influenza A/H3N2 was reported in 1968 and has since affected multiple countries [2] . In several seasons, A(H3N2) strains are more prevalent than the other co-circulating viral sub-types [4, 5] with high morbidity and mortality rates [6, 7] . Influenza A nomenclature is based on the genotypic properties of two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Currently, 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes have been recognized [8] . The primary target of host neutralizing antibodies is the HA glycoprotein where it inhibits binding to the sialic acid receptors present in the respiratory tract [9] . There are five identified antigenic sites for A(H3N2), namely, A, B, C, D and E [10] . Non-recognition of some strains by neutralizing antibodies present in the host is the consequence of mutations at these sites [11] . Continuous build-up of mutations at these antigenic sites is the basis for the evolutionary dynamics observed in the influenza virus resulting in antigenic drift [12] . About seven A(H3N2) clades (designated clades 1 to 7) and many sub-clades have evolved over the past few years, providing a significant challenge for the annual design of effective influenza vaccines [13] . At present, viruses in clade 3 are the dominant group, which has diversified further into three major subclades designated 3A, 3B, and 3C, with subclade 3C containing several distinguishable genetic groups [13, 14] .",

Viral RNA was extracted then from 140 \u03bcL of clinical samples with Qiagen RNA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions into a final volume of 60 \u03bcL elution buffer. Extracts were analyzed for the presence of influenza by a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in an ABI Prism 7300 or 7500 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA). Positive samples for influenza H3N2 with Ct below 30 after subtyping were eligible for sequencing.

We analyzed the coding sequences of 3 gene segments of influenza A/H3N2 virus strains from 2014 to 2016 influenza seasons in Cameroon and compared them with those of the WHO reference strains, WHO recommended vaccine strains [18] and with other epidemiologically relevant African strains from both GenBank and GISAID databases. We observed different phylogenetic clusters generated for different gene segments. The HA gene sequences indicated that all the Cameroon strains had evolved away from the 3C.1-A/Texas/50/2012-like clade by acquiring the genetic markers N145S, Y186G, P198S and F219S which has been identified as being characteristic of clades 3C.2 and 3C.3 [13, 34] [22] . Several amino acid mutations on epitope A of the HA gene were responsible for the drift between the circulating strains and the 2014-2015 vaccine strains, 3C.1-A/Texas/50/2012-like strain. This corroborates with the P epitope > 0.19 observed, and eventually resulting in a negative vaccine efficacy. The vaccine change to the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like strain for the following season resulted in more than 80% of the circulating H3N2 strains not covered by the selected vaccine. Notwithstanding the poor results with the previous influenza seasons, the 2016-2017 selected vaccine strain showed moderate efficacy when compared to the circulating virus strains. It is noteworthy that vaccination against influenza virus, is not a common phenomenon in the Cameroon population, however a better selection of annual vaccine with the use of P epitope as suggested by other authors, [21] will improve vaccine efficacy and encourage uptake of flu vaccine. This may result in reduced burden caused by influenza due to herd immunity [35] . The acquisition of a mutation in influenza A viruses conferring resistance to an antiviral agent may occur as a result of drug selection, spontaneous mutation or through genetic reassortment with another drug resistant influenza A virus [26] . Neuraminidase inhibitors target the NA glycoprotein which plays a key role in the production of new viral progeny. There have been rare reports of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors in influenza H3N2 virus strains [27] , and this was confirmed Cameroonian virus strains by the absence of previous mutations characteristic of this resistance. There was however a novel amino an amino acid mutation, Q136H, that had not been previously reported. Further investigation on the clinical relevance of this mutation will be essential for a better understanding of the molecular evolution of influenza A(H3N2).",

High prevalence of amantadine resistance in influenza A viruses was observed in other countries, irrespective of its use [25, 26] . Resistance to M2 inhibitors first appeared following extensive drug use in Asia and the US after the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic in 2004. Since there is no history of exposure to anti-viral drugs against influenza and eventually to adamantanes, Cameroonian virus strains with S31N mutation indicated that strains already harbouring drug resistant mutation were most likely introduced in the community. These resistant strains probably have a selective advantage over the sensitive strains that favour their evolution and fitness [36] .",

The Cameroonian H3N2 virus strains shared at least nine potential N-glycosylation sites with the 2014-2017 vaccine strains, and had similar glycosylation patterns. Group 3C.2a-like strains had acquired 2 additional glycosylation sites: 126NWT128 and 158NYT160. The predicted HA glycosylation patterns may contribute to a potential antigenic escape of influenza H3N2 viruses from antibodies raised against vaccine strain and previous circulating strains or increase viral fitness by yet-to-be-characterized mechanisms.",

Comparison of genes was performed on the strains circulating during the 2014 (N = 6), 2015 (N = 17) and 2016 (N = 12) seasons and sequences from the northern hemisphere vaccine and reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all Cameroonian virus strains had evolved away from the 3C.1-A/Texas/50/2012-like clade by acquiring several amino acid substitutions (Fig 1, Table 1). Virus strains from 2014 clustered with the 2015-2016 vaccine strain (3C.3a-A/Switzerland/9715293/2013) while virus strains from 2015 and 2016 clustered with the 2016-2017 vaccine strain (3C.2a-A/HongKong/4801/ 2014) except for one isolate (A/Cameroon/15V-8790/2015) which clustered with the reference strain, 3C.3a-A/Switzerland/9715293/2013. The 2014 virus strains differed from the 2015 and 2016 virus strains at three antigenic sites: antigenic site A, which contained 2 amino acid substitutions (A138S, R142G), antigenic site B showed 3 substitutions (N128T, F159Y and K160T) and antigenic site C showed a Q311H substitution when compared to the 3C.1-A/Texas/50/2012-like clade (Table 1). Isolate A/Cameroon/15V-8790/2015 differed from all other 2015 virus strains in this study by clustering in the same clade as 2014 strains. Isolate A/Cameroon/14V-4680/2014 differed from all other virus strains in this study in having a G263E substitution, and isolate A/Cameroon/16V-3265/2016 differed from all other 2016 strains by possessing N171K and R142G substitutions. Neuraminidase. The NA sequence analysis showed that all Cameroonian strains evolved away from the 3C.1-A/Texas/50/2012-like clade (Fig 2). Strains from 2014 influenza season clustered with the 3C.3-A/Samara/73/2013 strain while 2015 and 2016 virus strains did not cluster with any strain but were closely related to the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 vaccine strains (3C.3a-A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 and 3C.2a-A/HongKong/4801/2014, respectively). The NA genes of the 2014 virus strains differed from those of the 2015 and 2016 virus strains by substitutions of several amino acids: E221D and T267K were found in all 2015 and 2016 virus strains. Whereas, I67V, A110D, V313A and V412I substitutions were found only in 2014 virus strains. Matrix gene. Analysis of the M gene showed that 2014 virus strains clustered with the 2016-2017 vaccine strain, 3C.2a-A/HongKong/4801/2014, while 2015 and 2016 virus strains did not cluster with any reference strain (Fig 3). Globally, there was no significant change observed in the M protein of Cameroonian strains with respect to reference strains. One isolate, A/Cameroon/16V-3265/2016, displayed the amino acid substitution M165L compared to the 2016-2017 vaccine strain, A/HongKong/4801/2014.",

For 2016, P epitope of 0.0526 from 9 strains (dominant epitope = A; mutation 144) predicted a minimum vaccine efficacy against these strains of 72.36% (E = 34.01% of 47%, P epitope = 0) of that of a perfect match with the A/HongKong/ 4801/2014 vaccine strain. Influenza A(H3N2) demonstrated antigenic drift from epitopes B to epitopes A. The 2015-2016 vaccine strain A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, which belongs to clade 3C.3, was also examined for its ability to match the A(H3N2) strains of the same clade circulating in 2014. The resulting P epitope value of 0 gave an estimated worst-case vaccine efficacy against these strains of 100%. Moreover, clade 3C.2 strains of A(H3N2) in 2015 season and the 2016-",

There was no cluster between the Cameroonian strains and the recommended 2014-2015 reference vaccine strain for the northern hemispheres, 3C.1-A/Texas/50/2012-like clade. None of the selected African virus strains circulating between 2014 and 2016 clustered in the 3C.1-A/Texas/50/2012 clade either. Cameroonian strains formed two distinct clusters: 2014 virus strains clustered with the 3C.2a-A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like clade while the 2015 and 2016 virus strains clustered with the 3C.2a-A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like clade. Interestingly, the Cameroonian NA gene sequences had also evolved away from the 3C.1-A/Texas/50/ 2012-like clade by acquiring several amino acid substitutions. A unique 2015 isolate, A/Cameroon/15V-8790/2015, was comparable in many regards to the 2014 virus strains; however, its M and NA genes were unlike the remaining 2015 virus strains. Theoretically, a clear H3N2 vaccine mismatch was observed during the 2014-2015 influenza seasons as reported by Tewawong et al. in the Southern hemisphere",
