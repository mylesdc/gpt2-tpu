            "text": "Rice stripe virus (RSV) causes one of the most important rice virus diseases of plants in East Asia. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling rice resistance to RSV infection are largely unknown. Recently, several studies presented a novel model that melatonin (MT) and nitric oxide (NO) participate in the plant-pathogen interaction in a synergetic manner. In this study, there was a difference in MT content between two rice varieties that correlated with one being susceptible and one being resistant to RSV, which suggested that MT is related to RSV resistance. In addition, a test with two NO biosynthesis inhibitors revealed that NO inhibitor were able to increase the disease incidence of RSV. A pharmacological experiment with exogenous MT and NO showed that increased MT and NO in the MT-pretreated plants led to lower disease incidences; however, only NO increased in a NO-releasing reagent [sodium nitroprusside (SNP)] pretreated plants. The expressions level of OsPR1b and OsWRKY 45 were significantly induced by MT and NO. These results suggest that rice resistance to RSV can be improved by increased MT through a NO-dependent pathway.",

            "text": "Rice stripe virus (RSV), a typical member of the genus Tenuvirus, is transmitted mainly by the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus) (SBPH) in a persistent and propagative manner, and can infect many crops, such as rice, wheat, and several other gramineous plants, resulting in a severe loss of grain [1] ; in addition, Sun et al. reported that the virus can also infect Arabidopsis thaliana [2] . The infected plants exhibit typical symptoms, such as alternating yellow and green stripes, curly and drooping leaves, and necrotic lesions [3] . Previous reports indicated that the plant chloroplasts were damaged by excessive accumulation of starch, which was triggered by RSV infection, resulting in alternating yellow and green stripes [4] . Melatonin (N-acetyl-5methoxytryptamine, MT), an amine hormone that was isolated and identified from the pineal gland in the late 1950s, has been revealed to possess a broad spectrum of biological functions in both animals and plants in many studies [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . In particular, MT has been considered as a therapeutic indole for combating viral diseases, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and WNV (West Nile virus) [10] . Consistent with the benefits of MT in immunology and medicine in animals, MT can also induce plant resistance to pathogens, such as Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, Alternaria spp., and Fusarium spp. [11, 12] . However, the detailed mechanisms of MT -triggered plant innate immunity to viruses are elusive. Recently, several studies also indicated the potential involvement of a gaseous signal molecule or plant hormone in the defense response triggered by MT. For example, it was reported that nitric oxide (NO) induced by MT is responsible for disease resistance to Pst DC3000 infection in Arabidopsis [13] . Indeed, the vital role of NO in plant-pathogen interactions has been demonstrated by many studies [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . NO can be produced through the nitrate/nitrite-dependent pathway that is known to be catalyzed by nitrate reductase (NR) [19] and through the L -arginine-dependent pathway that is known to be catalyzed by a mammalian NO synthase (NOS)-like enzyme [20, 21] . Further, Lee et al. found that the disease resistance induced by MT correlates with plant hormones in Pst DC3000 [11, 22] . Thus, these studies may provide a potential mechanism for the effect of MT and NO in plant against other pathogen infections.",

As shown in Fig. 3c , compared to the water-treated group, Old-SNP treatment failed to reduce the disease incidence as SNP did, and cPTIO can exacerbate disease, which indicated that NO may play a vital role in the rice response to RSV infection. In addition, cPTIO could eliminate the MT positive effect on the disease incidence, which suggested that NO serves as a mediator in MT triggered rice resistance to RSV infection.

Compared to the water-treated group, the two genes were induced by both MT and SNP treatment and suppressed by cPTIO significantly after RSV infection, while the expression levels of OsPR1b was also induced by MT and SNP treatments, and OsWRKY 45 was induced by SNP treatment in uninfected plants, although the inducible level is lower than that in RSV infected plants (Fig. 4) . The results indicated that OsPR1b and OsWRKY 45 were induced by RSV infection and OsPR1b might act downstream of MT and NO signaling pathway, and OsWRKY 45 could be partially downstream of MT and NO signaling Fig. 3 The resistance to RSV can be improved by the increased production of MT and NO.

These results preliminarily suggested the protective role of MT to RSV stress. Secondly, pharmacological experiments with both exogenous MT and NO alleviated the disease incidence of RSV, while application with cPTIO had a negative effect on disease incidence, which indicates that MT and NO can improve rice resistance against the RSV pathogen (Fig. 3) . Overall, our results demonstrated the vital role of MT and NO in the rice-RSV interaction.",

Nipponbare plants were pretreated with different treatments and then were inoculated with virus-free SBPH or RSV (viruliferous SBPH). Total RNA was extracted from rice leaves at 18 hpi. The assay was performed by qPCR and normalized against the combination of UBQ 10 and GAPDH. The values of the water-treated group were set at 1.0. All the experiments were repeated three times, and similar results were obtained. The data represent the means \u00b1 SD of triplicate measurements. Different letters or asterisks represent significantly difference at P < 0.05 according to Duncan's multiple tests triggered rice resistance to RSV. Moreover, MT application can significantly enhance NO content level, while a NO donor has no effect on endogenous MT levels (Fig.  3) . These results further indicated that NO is a downstream signal component of MT triggered rice resistance to RSV, which is consistent with the previous report of Shi et al. on Arabidopsis [13] . However, this mode of action is not always the case, because Pozo et al. and Aydogan et al. both reported the inhibitory effect of MT on biosynthesis of NO [38, 39] . Thus, the detailed mechanism of the concentration-dependent interaction between MT and NO in plant-pathogen interactions needs to be studied further.",
