            "text": "Background: Resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in grapes and red wine, exhibits diverse pharmacological activities. However, relatively little is known about whether resveratrol modulates the ion channels in cortical neurons. The large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (BK Ca ) and voltage-gated sodium channels were expressed in cortical neurons and play important roles in regulation of neuronal excitability. The present study aimed to determine the effects of resveratrol on BK Ca currents and voltage-gated sodium currents in cortical neurons. Results: Resveratrol concentration-dependently increased the current amplitude and the opening activity of BK Ca channels, but suppressed the amplitude of voltage-gated sodium currents. Similar to the BK Ca channel opener NS1619, resveratrol decreased the firing rate of action potentials. In addition, the enhancing effects of BK Ca channel blockers tetraethylammonium (TEA) and paxilline on action potential firing were sensitive to resveratrol. Our results indicated that the attenuation of action potential firing rate by resveratrol might be mediated through opening the BK Ca channels and closing the voltage-gated sodium channels. Conclusions: As BK Ca channels and sodium channels are critical molecular determinants for seizure generation, our findings suggest that regulation of these two channels in cortical neurons probably makes a considerable contribution to the antiseizure activity of resveratrol.",

            "text": "Resveratrol (trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene), a polyphenolic phytoalexin, is derived from some edible materials, including grape skins, peanuts, red wine, and other berries. It has been demonstrated that resveratrol displays diverse pharmacological activities, including anti-platelet [2] , anticarcinogenic [4] , anti-viral [9, 18, 27] and cardio-protective effects [32, 33, 37, 43, 47] . Moreover, there is accumulating evidence indicating that resveratrol exhibits neuroprotective effects [8, 11, 23, 28] . For example, resveratrol attenuates kainic acid-mediated convulsions and the associated neurotoxicity [16, 42, 49, 54] and also protects against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures [31, 40] . Furthermore, resveratrol has the ability to inhibit the electrical activity of neurons [26, 30, 50] , enabling this compound ideal as a neuroprotective agent against excitatory effects on neurons. This compound can inhibit neuronal discharges in rat hippocampal CA1 area [25] and suppress epileptiform discharges mediated by glutamate [25] . In addition, resveratrol has the ability to produce a dose-dependent inhibition of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials [11] . These effects are likely associated with the alterations in neuronal cell membrane ion channel activities.",

When activated by cell membrane depolarization and elevation of intracellular Ca 2+ concentration, BK Ca channels allow the efflux of K + out of the cell, thus repolarizing and hyperpolarizing the membrane potential. This turns off voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels and thus inhibits the influx of Ca 2+ into the cell. These negative feedback mechanisms allow BK Ca channels to play an important role in regulating firing properties. BK Ca channels are expressed in various brain neurons where they play important roles in regulating action potential duration, firing frequency and neurotransmitter release [34] .

The present study demonstrated that resveratrol could stimulate the activities of BK Ca channels in cortical neurons. In fact, BK Ca channel is considered to be one of the intrinsic molecular determinants for the control of neuronal excitability in the central nervous system and play a role in the etiology of some neurological diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated the implication of BK Ca channels in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) pathology [22] . In fact, a selective BK Ca channel opener molecule (BMS-204352) rescues a broad spectrum of behavioral impairments (social, emotional and cognitive) in an animal model of FXS [17] . Resveratrol might be also beneficial to patients with FXS. BK Ca channels also play an important role in seizure etiology. Loss-of-function BK Ca channel mutations can lead to temporal lobe epilepsy, tonic-clonic seizures and alcohol withdrawal seizures [34, 35] . Paradoxically, some mutations in BK Ca channel subunit can give rise to channel gain-of-function that leads to development of idiopathic epilepsy (primarily absence epilepsy) [34] . Thus, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function BK Ca channels might serve as molecular targets for drugs to suppress certain seizure phenotypes including temporal lobe seizures and absence seizures, respectively. Actually, resveratrol has been found to reduce the kainateinduced temporal lobe epilepsy [16, 54] , suggesting that resveratrol might have potential for treatment of this seizure type through activation of BK Ca channels.",

Inhibition of sodium currents by resveratrol may account for its analgesic effects [12, 14, 44] . The a Functional expression of the voltage-gated sodium current in embryonic rat cortical neurons. Superimposed current traces in control (top panel) and during exposure to 2 \u03bcM TTX (lower panel). Under the experimental condition, depolarizing voltage command from a holding potential of \u221280 mV elicited an inward current sensitive to TTX. This inward Na + current was maximally activated by a test pulse at \u221220 mV (n = 8). b Concentration dependent effects of resveratrol on inward Na + currents. The currents were evoked depolarizing the cells from a holding potential of \u221280 mV to \u221220 mV. Representative traces showing the depression of inward Na + currents by resveratrol at different concentrations in these cells. c The graph shows the concentration dependent effect of resveratrol on the amplitudes of the inward currents measured at the peaks (n = 3-5). * Significantly different from control group (P < 0.05) Fig. 4 Resveratrol reduced action potential firing in embryonic rat cortical neuron. Current-clamp configuration was made in these experiments. All cells were bathed in Tyrode's solution containing 1.8 mM CaCl 2 . Trains of action potentials were evoked by a depolarizing current step. a Original potential traces obtained in control (upper) and in the presence (lower) of resveratrol (20 \u03bcM) by injecting a threshold current. b The potential traces obtained in the absence and presence of TTX (2 \u03bcM). c The potential traces obtained in the absence and presence of NS1619 (5 \u03bcM). In the presence of resveratrol, TTX, and NS1619, the action potential firing frequency was significantly decreased Fig. 5 Resveratrol reduced TEA-or paxilline-evoked increases in action potential firing in embryonic rat cortical neuron. a Action potential firing was measured in control, in the presence of TEA (1 mM), and TEA combined with resveratrol (20 \u03bcM). b Action potential firing was measured in control, in the presence of paxilline (20 \u03bcM), and paxilline combined with resveratrol (20 \u03bcM). TEA and paxilline significantly increased the action potential firing frequency. Upon application of 20 \u03bcM resveratrol in the presence of TEA and paxilline, the excitability was suppressed significantly present study demonstrated that resveratrol can inhibit the TTX-S sodium currents in rat cortical neurons. Several lines of evidence revealed that the pathophysiology of both acquired and inherited epilepsy is associated with abnormal expression or function of voltage-gate sodium currents [29] . The Na v 1.1 or Na v 1.2 mutations are associated with generalized epilepsy and inherited epilepsy [6, 19] . Together with the observations that the protective effects of resveratrol against seizure activities caused by kainic acid or pentylenetetrazole [16, 45, 46, 48] , our findings suggest that in addition to activation of BK Ca channels, blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels in the cortical neurons might also contribute to the anti-seizure effects of resveratrol.",

Because BK Ca channels are typically blocked by externally applied tetraethylammonium (TEA, 1 mM), this compound is often used to determine the contribution of BK Ca channels to the whole-cell currents. All cells were held at -50 mV in Tyrode's solution containing 1.8 mM CaCl 2 . Then, cells were depolarized from \u221250 to +70 mV with a duration of 300 msec. a The currents were recorded in the presence of TEA (1 mM) combined with NS1619 (5 \u03bcM) from the same cell. b, c, d Original current traces are representative of 3 experiments. The currents were recorded in the presence of TEA (1 mM) or TEA (1 mM) combined with resveratrol (10, 20 and 40 \u03bcM) from the same cell. Resveratrol (20 and 40 \u03bcM, but not 10 \u03bcM) increased the TEA-sensitive current in these cells (n = 3). e Bar graph showing the effect of resveratrol on TEA-induced currents.
