It causes watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in newborn piglets. A sensitive RT-PCR method is urgently required to detect PDCoV infection. In this study, we developed and evaluated a conventional RT-PCR assay and a SYBR green-based real-time RT-PCR assay that targeted the PDCoV gene. Both assays are specific and have the same limit of detection at 2 \u00d7 10 1 copies of RNA molecules per reaction. Eighty-four clinical samples were subjected to both conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR, and the same positive rate (41.7%) was achieved, which was much higher than the positive rate (26.2%) using a previously described onestep RT-PCR technique. In summary, a conventional RT-PCR technique was successfully established for the detection of PDCoV with the same detection limit as a SYBR green-based real-time RT-PCR assay.",

For the detection of specific antibody, the most commonly used serological assays included virus neutralization (VN) test, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [16] [17] [18] . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) are the most commonly used virological methods for the detection of nucleic acid. Various PDCoV-specific RT-PCRs and RT-qPCRs have been developed to detect PDCoV [2, 11, 12] . However, the detection limit of the gel-based RT-PCR for PDCoV detection has not been established [11, 12] . Real-time RT-qPCR was more sensitive than conventional PCR [2, 19] . Although the detection limit of nested PCR was similar to that of real-time RT-PCR, the additional amplification procedure made this test more complicated and easier for contamination.",

Meanwhile, there is no report about the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR assay for the detection of PDCoV. Thus, a SYBR green-based RT-qPCR assay was developed to compare the detection limit against conventional RT-PCR. Furthermore, conventional RT-PCR and RT-qPCR were used to evaluate clinical samples.",

A rapid and accurate diagnosis would be helpful to identify and segregate infected animals in a timely manner. Therefore, the main objective of present study is to establish the conventional RT-PCR and SYBR green-based RT-qPCR methods with high sensitivity for PDCoV detection. The sensitivity of developed conventional RT-PCR is same as that of RT-qPCR. After comparing the results of clinical samples analyzed by both assays, we concluded that these methods were sensitive, rapid, reliable, and cost-effective in nature. Several kinds of novel amplification methods, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR), and probe-based real-time PCR, have been developed to detect PDCoV with better sensitivity [19, 20] . Nevertheless, conventional RT-PCR is still widely used for detecting PDCoV [11, 12] . Although previous studies have used conventional RT-PCR to detect PDCoV, the detection limits of these assays have not been defined till date [11, 12] . A previous report has described that the detection limit of LAMP method was 10 copies, which was 100 times more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR [20] . This indicates that RT-PCR can detect PDCoV with a detection limit of 1000 copies. Recently, nano-particle-assisted PCR assays were used to increase the sensitivity of conventional PCR [22] [23] [24] . In the detection of duck Tembusu virus, the detection limit of nano-particle-assisted PCR was 1.8 \u00d7 10 2 copies [23] . This indicates that the sensitivity of nano-particleassisted PCR was 10-fold more than that of conventional PCR assay [23] . In theory, PCR assay can detect as few as 1 DNA/RNA molecule. However, the limit of detection for conventional PCR commonly could not achieve theoretical value because of various factors, such as primer design and reaction inhibitor in genome extract.",

            "text": "In present study, our main objective was to ensure that conventional RT-PCR could detect PDCoV with better sensitivity. The conservation of the target gene is important to the broad reactivity of the RT-PCR assay for detection of heterologous strains. The PDCoV gene was demonstrated to be highly conserved and chosen to be the target gene of RT-PCR and RT-qPCR in many studies [6, 12] . Thus, the gene was selected as the target gene in our study. To improve the sensitivity of the conventional RT-PCR, we adjusted several primer pairs and optimized reaction conditions. It was found in our study that the sensitivity of the conventional RT-PCR assay could be significantly improved with selected primers. However, modulation of reaction conditions, such as annealing temperature and primer concentrations, had no effect on the performance of the assay. The optimal sensitivity of RT-PCR was 2 \u00d7 10 1 copies by using the primers PCR-F/R for PDCoV detection, which was equal to that of SYBR greenbased RT-qPCR. The result was confirmed by the tests carried out in three independent days. The conventional RT-PCR had several advantages against the RT-qPCR as follows: RT-PCR does not require an expensive device for operation; moreover, RT-PCR is a cost-effective technique. In present study, it was proved that the sensitivity of RT-PCR was significantly improved in resource-limiting settings. Therefore, the high sensitivity of this method will reduce false negative results. The sequences of PDCoV gene have been used to generate the phylogenetic tree to analyze the epidemiology of PDCoV [13] . In our study, the gene products were approximately 950 nt in length; these gene products could be sequenced directly, providing a robust tool for molecular epidemiology study.",

The detection result of the conventional RT-PCR assay was 100% in agreement with that of the RT-qPCR assay, indicating the high sensitivity of the conventional RT-PCR assay. The positive rates detected by conventional RT-PCR and RT-qPCR were both 41.7%. However, when the samples were tested by one-step RT-PCR [11] , an assay reported in a previous study, the positive rate was only 26.2%. These results demonstrated that the previously reported conventional RT-PCR with low sensitivity would underestimate the prevalence of PDCoV infection in pig herd. Considering that most testing laboratories are equipped with thermocyclers rather than sophisticated quantitative PCR instruments, the highly sensitive conventional RT-PCR is more suitable for extensive applications in laboratories, which are specifically designed for PDCoV detection and surveillance.",
