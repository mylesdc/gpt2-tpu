With regard to Mariner's definition, my only suggestion is to leave out the 'emerging field' part. Already now, let alone in five years time that is no longer relevant. Of the two, my preference is with Catley as it less stresses the community level -implicitly referring to the level of households/livestock owners. I think participatory epidemiology can also be used for improving the understanding of diseases and options for disease control when dealing with other than communities, such as central and peripheral veterinary authorities, or private stakeholders such as farm managers. In my opinion, key to participatory epidemiology is the two-way direction of collecting information and developing disease control options as Catley is referring to when stating \"therefore should go beyond the simple provision of information to outsiders\". My experience is limited to working with veterinary authorities in Asia and Africa and I would argue that even with them using participatory epidemiology is relevant. More often than not, quantitative data (on disease incidence, on livestock and livestock owners populations, on value-chains) are absent, while they ask for revising or developing disease control plans. We, then use more or less similar techniques as in PE to retrieve information and data. Thus, in both definitions the word 'communities' maybe too restrictive if it refers to households, farmer communities or other field level communities. It is equally possible that my English language skills do not suffice for getting involved on definitions (as mentioned above).",

Furthermore PE also provided researchers avenues to be in touch with reality on ground so that research can be both action-and people-oriented. And at times PE helps researchers to understand why their predicted findings based on assumed hypothesis are not in tune with reality in the field. Essentially, PE is solely aimed to improve communal understanding of disease situation for its sustainable control. In this context, communal implies that everyone (i.e. community members and outsiders/researchers) involved in the exercise are ready to cooperate, such that knowledge gained or sourced is collectively processed and utilized by all parties involved thus ensuring the sustainability of the end result, which is disease control. In effect, PE is relevant to all parties (community members and outsider-the researchers), but it must be designed such that the community members sees the exercise as theirs for ownership role which in turn ensures sustainability.",

There is no explicit reference to action taken by the communities. Maybe because this knowledge is implicitly collected in order to be used in the framework of conventional surveillance systems and will be managed and highlighted by Vets and animal health specialists. The second one is more opening a pathway toward collective action and seems more oriented on the research of solutions and alternatives to conventional control strategies. Being implicit that local communities will be empowered in this process to take decision in order to better manage animal health problems (not a priori under the authority of vets or animal health specialist).

My own definition would also include a citizen science element as well -in some cases participatory epidemiology might include hunters collecting biological samples for lab analysis.

One thing I'm missing in both definitions is the One-Health approach, considering the fact that quite a few livestock diseases, or EIDs that might affect farm animals, are zoonotic or have a zoonotic potential.

The aim of the participatory epidemiology is not only to apply techniques involving data acquiring from the community members. It is to involve the community in the research, disease control or disaster risk reduction projects as active subjects, not only as the object of observation. In order to address the vulnerabilities of the community and improve its resilience in a sustainable manner, we need the active participation of communities. Harvesting epidemiological intelligence is only one facet of the participatory approach. Second, why harvesting only qualitative data? There were successful projects with quantitative data acquired by i.e. SMS data submission (eg. Philippines). The veracity and validity of the data may be questionable, but it applies to both qualitative and qualitative data.One of the similar definitions: -Schwab M, Syme SL. On paradigms, community participation and the future of public health. Am J Public Health 1997;87:2049-52.): (participatory epidemiology) \"implies working across disciplines and with the population itself, in defining variables, designing instruments, and collecting data (qualitative and quantitative) that reflect the ecological reality of life in that population, as people experience it.\" -Catley., A; Alders RG, Wood JLN (2012). Participatory epidemiology: approaches, methods, experiences. The Veterinary Journal, 191: 151 -160 \"Participatory epidemiology is the systematic use of participatory approaches and methods to improve understanding of diseases and options for animal disease control.\" The term 'participatory' should be used to refer to the active involvement of communities in the definition of project objectives and development of disease control strategies and therefore should go beyond the simple provision of information to outsiders. This definition is broader in scope and more open. It stresses the active involvement of communities, which actually empowers their members, aside from being more willing to take part in a project. Any definition requires an established context; and, the context is not epidemiology, nor the research, but populations in their natural and social environment. There are numerous definitions of participatory epidemiology, and a good overview can be obtained in Margaret W Leung, Irene H Yen and Meredith Minkler Community based participatory research: a promising approach for increasing epidemiology's relevance in the 21st century, Int. J. Epidemiol. (2004) 33 (3): 499-506. This citation points well to the essence of participatory epidemiology: \"The application of the principles of Community Based Participatory Research in such studies provides guidance for epidemiologists who wish to use their skills and training to advance health promotion and disease prevention with and for the public rather than on the public.\"",

I agree with the comments that 'emerging' is no longer appropriate. The approach is in fact institutionalized at many levels. It's included in some textbooks and in regular curricula of Universities in both developing and developed countries. It is also appears as a topic in international meetings and is utilized by a wide selection of countries and international organizations. I can support the removal of 'qualitative' but think we need to emphasize that PE is a learning methodology more than a research methodology. There are at least two very well written documents that describe the hazards of using participatory approaches to do quantitative research and I think some examples of 'quantitative uses of participatory approaches' actually sacrificed their participatory nature. The issue is that as we move to standardize questions and make the process more amenable to quantitative analysis we lose the special value of the participatory approach which is to empower people to express their own ideas in their own words and to encourage learning for all involved. If you go to the resource page of the PENAPH website you will find the two documents I referring to. Also, one point that has always nagged me since I wrote the PE Manual is the principle I was thought in grade school that you can't use the word in its own definition as it becomes a circular statement. Many of the definitions boil down to participatory epidemiology is the use of participation techniques in epidemiology. This is not very helpful for those who have been exposed to the complex topics of participation or epidemiology. Picking up where you helpful edits left off, I would suggest the following definition: \"Participatory epidemiology uses participatory techniques to create a shared learning environment leading to a better understanding of the epidemiological information and knowledge contained within community observations and experience-based knowledge to inform joint decision-making and action.\" Participation is the empowerment of people to identify and solve their own problems.",

It leads the definition into circular reasoning that is not clear. You could say that all epidemiology involves participation by communities in the gathering of data.

The project, is, in a sense, \"owned\" by the participants AND the researcher as opposed to being \"owned\" ONLY by the researcher (as in the case of non-PE epi\u2026or do I now call it traditional epi?). \"Participatory epidemiology, in animal health, is the systematic use of approaches and methods-using the active involvement of communities (i.e. all stakeholders involved) in the definition of project objectives and development of disease control strategies-to improve understanding of diseases and options for animal disease control.\" Communities might include those who own/raise/treat/butcher/etc animals in the geographic area of interest.

Moreover participatory epidemiology is actually seen as a very important tool to use for the evaluation of OH actions and impacts (see NEOH Cost action: http://neoh.onehealthglobal.net/). I think as well that in participatory epidemiology the concept of interactive mutual learning process should present as during practice of participatory epidemiology knowledge sharing is more effective. Another point, Participatory epidemiology can as well help to have a better understanding of farmers/stakeholder perceptions about a risk or an health problems, not only assessing knowledge, and we know that it's important to understand attitudes and reactions when facing health challenges and control strategies that are provided by external stakeholders.",

The more I look at it and am exposed to other professions I have realized that they all use similar approaches for community participation but call it something different. For example, community-based participatory approaches (CBPR) from nursing, or Ecosystem approaches to health (AMESH, etc)\u2026and the list could go on from here. The question that keeps coming to my mind is\u2026.what makes participatory epidemiology different that these? I keep coming back to the tool set that participatory epidemiology uses in its process. In the recent course that my graduate student and I took from Jeff Mariner, we learned participatory methods such as transect walks, focus group meetings with nonstructured interview techniques, calendars or proportional piling and matrix building (bean exercises) to engage groups discussion and permit translation of community knowledge into semi-quantitative data, outbreak investigation through both historical and acquired knowledge of the community, etc. None of the definitions included the uniqueness of the defined set of activities that seem to me to set apart the PE approach from other discipline approaches that I have encountered. My graduate student's project involves working with interested First Nations and Metis communities in Saskatchewan Canada to assess dog population and dog bite issues. The community's defined their issues, defined the control programs that they would initiate, and we have worked with them to document the changes in quantitative methods (dog counts, etc) but also have documented the community process and struggles to work on these issues within the context of other competing community health issues. In describing her project for a poster for the upcoming conference called ISVEE 2015 in Mexico, we called it \"community-based participatory approach using participatory methods such as transect walks, venn diagrams, non-structured interviews, ranking, proportional piling and matrix building\". This decision comes because the other members of the student's graduate committee are either from nursing or ecohealth circles where PE is not a well-known or wellused terminology. Most of the examples in week one appeared to involve use of these methods in developing countries. My question would be whether the term PE is only used there because we are trying to differentiate \"yet another method\" from already established methods of community-based research used in developed countries? This question does not just relate to PE as I am having the same discussion on what differentiates \"Citizen science\" from CBPR or PE.",

However, it didn't work well for almost all farms in the Campania region of Italy. So I had to travel down there to conducted a PE exercise. On arrival, I discovered the veterinarians and farmers have been wondering why the disease does not follow the usual expected seasonal pattern. The PE exercise revealed that the movement of sheep for grazing (by farmers) based on the dynamics of the climate in the region is responsible for the peculiar distribution/pattern of the disease amongst sheep. In effect, the PE exercise helped me to better validate and appreciate the limitation of my model and to explain how host movement is critical to sustainable control of the disease. Additionally the farmers and vets got the answer they have been seeking for, by so doing, they have come to appreciate the significance and how the farmer's practice of host movement based on changes in climate predetermines the real-time seasonality of the disease in question on the farm (PE revealed what was right before their eyes all along).",

For us to move out of this, I think we need to be better mobilizes of resources that can support closer farmer to veterinarian interactions possibly through lobbying government or partners in this venture.

Now, with this information, there are two (2) possible ways to prevent and/or manage any conflict of interest between community priorities and animal health policy. 1-Here the animal health policy is explained clearly to the relevant communities as the targeted objective. Then as incentive, one or more of the community highpriority health problems will equally be addressed alongside the execution of the animal health policy. I believe this is the best way to deal with the conflict; that is, if any between the community and animal health policy as every involving stakeholders will share in the ownership of the system. 2-Second option is to combine one or more priority problems of the targeted respondents together with the animal health policy such that they are inseparable from each other, that is, it will be seen together as the animal health policy. The challenge here is that this combination can only exist when it is pertinent to combine the two conflicting priorities as one.

With this exercise perhaps might say that diseases prioritized in the community are very likely to be those who have been diagnosed clinically or laboratory in close communities. With this information that authorities must include in their control plans or policies the control of these diseases. This situation usually happens in countries where the official veterinary service cannot reach all the communities and their surveillance systems are lack off. Therefore, the reporting of diseases or their presence in these communities is underestimated and wrongly delimits the area presence of these diseases and the strategies could not reach these communities. PE would be a great tool, as this will allow forgotten communities for the veterinary services to express their needs, context and As a result they will be visible. This could be an interesting way to enable the authorities to listen they needs and how on the basis of their culture or nanomedicine this communities could be solved their needs. Furthermore, this dialogue would perhaps improve national strategies for disease control based on the management of their herds in the community. So, these control plans might be adapted according of the operating systems how animals in their communities rise. These adapted strategies can be applied without having a conflict between national authorities and communities. This partnership would allow communities to be trained on the control of these diseases with the objectives of the veterinary service. Finally it could be improve the surveillance system because the communities which not only communicate the presence of the priority diseases, but the presence of other emerging or reemerging diseases, that may have capacity to generate epidemics in animal health and veterinary public health.",

Through participatory disease surveillance, we were able to establish the major livestock species kept and disease of priority in different communities in Plateau State, Nigeria. Most of the communities had poultry ranking first with regards to the livestock species mostly kept and the disease of utmost importance. However in the course of the exercise, one particular community differed in the livestock species kept and of course the disease of utmost importance. This tells us that a community is likely to have a different need with regards to disease control than what is assumed their need it. PE is therefore a needful tool to help government and the farmers to control the disease that is of importance to the different farming communities. The only challenge will be that different diseases have to be in the control programme. I think that farmers/communities could assure that their needs are being taken into consideration and addressed in disease control strategies and livestock policies by forming a cooperative and making their views known to Government and at the same time contributing their own quota in animal disease control rather than leaving it in the hands of Government alone.",

How do you think farmers/communities could assure that their needs are being taken into consideration and addressed in disease control strategies and livestock policies? In my experiences in Kenya and Somalia, the following somehow \"positive\" example shows the findings of PE exercise implemented under an ECHO emergency project aiming to assess livestock health in one specific district (Garissa) in Kenya. The PE survey teams were always formed by veterinarians from the vet services and external experts. We reproduced this exercise in different districts in north eastern Kenya. Following this exercise, in partnership with the Kenyan veterinary services, we integrated this information with previous evidence of diseases presence in the district, and we purchased vaccines (according to the different PE ranks). We then implemented the vaccination campaigns which targeted different diseases in different districts. However, the project (and the Veterinary Services), for a number of reasons (mostly economic and practicability of actions) haven't implemented any actions towards the control of the tick borne diseases or trypanosomiasis which ranked very high in all districts for a number of species. This was the limitation of this exercise. If such an approach is regularly used by vet services and the findings of PE are considered reliable enough by policy makers (but we would need to define \"enough\" here), PE could be the basis for targeted strategies applied to animal health control. What is needed is the evaluation of the effectiveness of control measures based on PE results.",

Although its clear the causative agent in Bacterial Morexella spp, the vector agent responsible was very surprising. A nocturnal insects which has been rarely reported in Africa( Uganda and Ivory Coast)proved to be main the culprit. The insects are tiny and rarely seen during the day -they only land on the animal eye during the night and later disappear. You need to spend a night at cattle boma to be able to see them.

My understanding is that PE is the overarching participatory approaches and methods/tools under which various other focused tools such as PDS, participatory baseline and impact assessments of livestock projects, participatory risk assessments, participatory disease socio-economic studies and general disease studies are delineated from. The PE focus on rural illiterate pastoral communities does not hold any longer (Harding et al, 2014) . Therefore one priority in PE future development is to gather and analyze evidence of various uses of PE globally.

This makes the task easy. PE is not an emerging field, as we all agreed. This means it has always been in use either unknowingly or knowingly. I believe the former is more common than the latter, hence the general thinking that this is an emerging field. The issue at stake here is sustainability of PEdriven projects, whether it is disease control and prevention or maintenance of public health/eco-health. Since PE is not an emerging field, as part of future developments of PE, all we need do is redirect the public's (or all relevant stakeholders') attention and focus to PE and its benefit. Particularly as we have glowing examples of the successful application PE to work with. This leaves out sustainability as main priority for future developments of PE. Sustainability: this is only possible when all relevant and actively participating stakeholders are given the ownership opportunity of the PE-driven project. In effect, the major focus of development of PE is in deciding the objectives/benefits (that will ensure its sustainability) as regards its application in projects. To this end, I think future developments of PE should be focused on the developments and standardization of step-wise checklist that can guide the formation of objectives for the application of PE in any project in question. Importantly, since, science, people, environment and ecology, etc, are ever dynamic and sometimes unpredictable; the final approved checklist should be reviewed at regular interval or as deemed necessary. The regular review of the checklist will ensure its relevance over time or space. NB: This checklist is to guide towards forming objectives that will ensure the sustainability of any project that is PE-driven, bearing in mind that sustainability will be assured when all stakeholders are included in the consideration process. Based on my humble experience, I think the checklist should include: -Define or identify the targeted stakeholders. This can be the host community or subset of a population/continent, professional bodies or association and/or even the government(s). -Define or identify other stakeholders that are anticipated to be participating in the project (that is those not captured in 1 above). -Is government(s) involved or not? -If government(s) is/are involved, any conflict of interest? -Who is/are the sponsors of the project?",
