Currently, no specific vaccine or treatment has been approved for this disease. To develop a therapeutic agent for SFTS, we isolated antibodies from a phage-displayed antibody library that was constructed from a patient who recovered from SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection. One antibody, designated as Ab10, was reactive to the Gn envelope glycoprotein of SFTSV and protected host cells and A129 mice from infection in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Notably, Ab10 protected 80% of mice, even when injected 5 days after inoculation with a lethal dose of SFTSV. Using cross-linker assisted mass spectrometry and alanine scanning, we located the non-linear epitope of Ab10 on the Gn glycoprotein domain II and an unstructured stem region, suggesting that Ab10 may inhibit a conformational alteration that is critical for cell membrane fusion between the virus and host cell. Ab10 reacted to recombinant Gn glycoprotein in Gangwon/Korea/2012, HB28, and SD4 strains. Additionally, based on its epitope, we predict that Ab10 binds the Gn glycoprotein in 247 of 272 SFTSV isolates previously reported. Together, these data suggest that Ab10 has potential to be developed into a therapeutic agent that could protect against more than 90% of reported SFTSV isolates.",

In severe cases, SFTS can include central nervous system manifestations, hemorrhagic signs, and multiple organ dysfunction, which can lead to death [18] [19] [20] [21] . No vaccines or therapeutics specific for SFTS have been approved for human use. Recently, a Phase 3 clinical trial of favipiravir (Avigan), a drug approved for the treatment of influenza virus infection in Japan, was initiated to expand its indication to SFTS treatment [22] . Monoclonal antibodies or convalescent sera from SFTS patients were tested to identify potential therapeutic intervention targets, resulting in the identification of SFTSV glycoproteins as molecules required for host cell entry [23, 24] and also as critical targets for virus neutralization through the development of humoral immunity. Both the Gn and Gc envelope glycoproteins of SFTSV are type I transmembrane proteins, and Gc is proposed to be a membrane fusion protein critical for SFTSV infection [25] . This has also been shown in Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) [26] , which is a well-known phlebovirus, whereas the function of Gn remains largely elusive across all other species in the genus Phlebovirus. The structure of the Gn head domain, which is composed of three subdomains, was resolved in SFTSV and RVFV [27] . However, the homology and arrangement within subdomains differ considerably between the two viruses, and the structure of the Gn stem domain still remains unknown. Moreover, the generation of an antibody for these targets in infected humans is rare, due to the presence of immunodominant decoy epitopes in the nucleoprotein [28] , which is a common phenomenon in a pathogenic virus-infected host [29] . In animal models, however, the protective effect of human convalescent sera was shown, suggesting that antibody therapy is possible [30] . Thus far, MAb4-5 is the only human neutralizing monoclonal antibody reported, and it was developed using a combinatorial human antibody library from five patients [31] . MAb4-5 binds to domain III of SFTSV Gn glycoprotein [27] . The neutralizing effect of MAb4-5 has been shown only in in vitro, and its in vivo efficacy remains to be shown.",

We randomly selected phagemid clones from the output titer plate from the last round of biopanning and subjected these clones to phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To minimize the number of clones reactive to the Fc portion of fusion proteins, Gn-C\u03ba and Gc-C\u03ba were used as antigens. Positive clones were selected and subjected to Sanger sequencing to determine the scFv nucleotide sequence. We identified five clones reactive to Gn and five clones reactive to Gc.

We found that cross-linkers bound to five amino acid residues (318Y, 324R, 326K, 328Y, and 331S) within domain II of the SFTSV Gn glycoprotein and also to four amino acid residues (371K, 372S, 379H, and 383S) within the stem region ( Fig 5A) .",

All the mutants were An anti-Gn glycoprotein antibody from a convalescent patient inhibits the infection of SFTSV expressed with an HA peptide at the carboxy terminus and the tags were used to measure the relative amount of each mutant. Alanine mutant proteins were captured by the Ab10 antibody, which was coated on the ELISA plate. Then, we measured the amount of captured mutant proteins by detecting the Fc portion of protein. The signals detected by capturing the HA peptide were used to normalize expression of mutant proteins. We measured the reactivity of Ab10 to alanine mutant Gn proteins, relative to wild type Gn glycoprotein, and found that alanine replacement of the amino acid residues in domain II from V315 to M334 resulted in reduced relative reactivity of Ab10 by more than 60%, except for S317, G319, and M321. This finding was consistent with our results deduced from the crosslinking coupled mass spectrometry ( Fig  5A and 5B ). In the stem region, replacing the cystine residues (C349, C356, C376, and C381) reduced the relative reactivity by more than 80%. This observation was consistent with a previous report that the structural stability of Gn was disrupted by a C356A mutation [27] . Also, mutation of the flanking residues of cystine, corresponding to G351, L354, E355, I357, T374, and V375 also reduced the reactivity by over 60%. Of the mutated residues that were distant from cysteine residues, mutation of G360, V361, R362, L363, T365, L370, G387, and K389 residues reduced the relative reactivity by more than 80%. The other mutations had minor effects on reactivity. Overall, Ab10 binding to Gn was predicted to be affected by 25 amino acid residues within domain II and the stem region of SFTSV Gn glycoprotein. Given that Gn glycoproteins from 247 isolates have conserved sequences for these 25 amino acid residues, we expect that Ab10 can react with 90.8% (247 out of 272) of SFTSV isolates currently reported (S8 Fig) .",

As an alternative approach, virus-directed monoclonal antibodies have also been developed and tested as therapies or as prophylaxis for viral diseases. Palivizumab (Synagis) was marketapproved for the prophylaxis of RSV in 1998. In addition, antibodies against HIV [37] [38] [39] , RSV [40] , Ebola virus [41] and influenza virus [42, 43] demonstrated potent efficacy in animal models. Antibodies targeting emerging or re-emerging viruses including MERS-CoV [44] [45] [46] and Zika virus [47] [48] [49] were also developed and are being tested in clinical trials. In the past several decades, antibodies have become one of the major therapeutic agents for cancer and autoimmune disease with indications that have rapidly broadened in recent years. Recent technical improvements in the discovery and manufacturing steps of therapeutic antibody production have also allowed rapid and successful antibody development to combat emerging infectious diseases [50] .",

Based on these observations, we first inoculated A129 mice with 2 \u00d7 10 5 PFU of the Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain and observed that all mice died 4 days after infection. With a 20 PFU dose of the Gangwon/Korea/2012 strain, mice died 5 to 7 days after infection.

Another group of antibodies was reported to bind the stem region of influenza hemagglutinin that is critical for conformational rearrangements that occur during membrane fusion [55] [56] [57] . This mechanism has more potential to be utilized for clinical development, because the stem region has fewer mutations than the receptor binding site.

Although the crystal structure of the phlebovirus Gn glycoprotein stem region has not yet been solved, a recent report showed a cryo-electron microscopy map of RVFV, and depicted the crystal structure of the RVFV Gn glycoprotein head region without a stem region [60] . The report also describes the membrane fusion mechanism of RVFV that is mediated by a low pH induced exposure of the hydrophobic Gc fusion loop. At a neutral pH, the Gn domain II (\u03b2-ribbon domain) shields the Gc fusion loop in the pre-fusion state and prevents premature fusion. Based on this report, we hypothesize that Ab10 simultaneously binds to domain II and the stem region of the Gn glycoprotein and prevents un-shielding of the Gc fusion loop.",

According to the epitope revealed in this study, Ab10 is estimated to interact with the majority of SFTSV isolates currently reported.

Transiently transfected cell supernatant containing recombinant Gn-Fc-HA proteins with alanine substitution was added to each well. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the microplate was washed three times with 0.05% Tween20 in PBS solution. Then, HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc antibody (31423; Invitrogen) diluted in blocking buffer was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, each well received 50 \u03bcL of 3,3 0 ,5,5 0 -tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution (34028; Thermo Scientific). The color reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcL of 2 M sulfuric acid. The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Multiskan GO; Thermo Scientific). Relative reactivity was calculated using absorbance values (Abs) as follows: % relative reactivity = [100 \u00d7 {(Abs of mutant captured by Ab10) / (Abs of mutant captured by HA antibody)} / {(Abs of wildtype captured by Ab10) / (Abs of wildtype captured by HA antibody)}].",

Fluorescent signals measured by confocal microscopy were quantified using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence software. Mass spectrometry data were analyzed using XQuest and Stavrox software. Plasmon surface resonance data were analyzed using BIAevaluation software. Visualization, alignment, and phylogenic analyses of amino acid sequences were performed with Geneious software. Thirty to fifty focus forming units (FFU) of SFTSV were incubated with serially diluted scFv-Fc fusion proteins for 1 h at room temperature and transferred to Vero cells in a 24-well tissue culture plate. After incubation for 1 h at 37\u02daC in a 5% CO 2 incubator, the cells were overlaid with 0.5% methylcellulose in RPMI medium with 2% fetal bovine serum and cultured for 2 days. Cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 15 min and incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Then, SFTSV localized clusters (foci) were visualized by incubating with 1 \u03bcg/mL of anti-SFTSV Gc glycoprotein antibody (Clone Ab3 from patent PCT/KR2017/003156) for 1 h, followed by incubation with 1:2,000 diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG Fc fragment specific antibody, conjugated with HRP (111-035-008; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) for 30 min and DAB substrate (K5007-BC; Dako). The percentage of neutralization was calculated for each diluted solution of antibody as the percentage of decreased fraction in the number of foci compared to that of the virus without incubation of scFv-Fc fusion protein. An irrelevant scFv-Fc fusion protein was used as an isotype control. Dose-response curves were drawn by non-linear regression analyses (variable slope model) and 50% FRNT values were determined from graphs using GraphPad Prism6 software. To examine binding activity of Ab10 antibody to SFTSV generated from Vero cells, serially diluted viral supernatants of SFTSV infected cells with a determined titer or the supernatant of mock-infected cells was coated onto microtiter plates (2692; Costar) at 4\u02daC overnight. Fifty to five thousand PFU of SFTSV were used to coat each well. The plates were then incubated with serial dilutions of Ab10 antibody or Palivizumab as an isotype control, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG Fc antibody (31423; Invitrogen). Reactions were developed by adding TMB substrate (34028; Thermo Scientific) and were terminated by adding 2 M sulfuric acid. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The amount of virus coated on each microplate well is indicated on the top of each graph, and the mean absorbance with standard deviation (s.d.) error bars is shown for each antibody concentration. Absorbance of Ab10 antibody bound to SFTSV-coated wells (red), Palivizumab bound to SFTSV-coated wells (blue), Ab10 antibody bound to mock-virus coated wells (magenta), and Palivizumab bound to mock-virus coated wells (purple) are shown in the graph.
