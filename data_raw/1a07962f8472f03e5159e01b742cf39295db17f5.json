            "text": "Hypericum perforatum L., also known as Saint John's Wort, has been well studied for its chemical composition and pharmacological activity. In this study, the antiviral activities of H. perforatum on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were evaluated in vitro and in vivo for the first time. The results of in vitro experiments confirmed that the antiviral component of H. perforatum was ethyl acetate extraction section (HPE), and results showed that treatment with HPE significantly reduced the relative messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression and virus titer of IBV, and reduced positive green immunofluorescence signal of IBV in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells. HPE treatment at doses of 480-120 mg/kg for 5 days, reduced IBV induced injury in the trachea and kidney, moreover, reduced the mRNA expression level of IBV in the trachea and kidney in vivo. The mRNA expression levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-\u03baB) significantly decreased, but melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), mitochondrial antiviral signaling gene, interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1), and interferon beta (IFN-\u03b2) mRNA levels significantly increased in vitro and in vivo. Our findings demonstrated that HPE had significant anti-IBV effects in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In addition, it is possible owing to up-regulate mRNA expression of type I interferon through the MDA5 signaling pathway and down-regulate mRNA expression of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 via the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Moreover, the mainly active compositions of HPE analyzed by highperformance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) are hyperoside, quercitrin, quercetin, pseudohypericin, and hypericin, and a combination of these compounds could mediate the antiviral activities. This might accelerate our understanding of the antiviral effect of H. perforatum and provide new insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies.",

            "text": "The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a prototype coronavirus containing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome (Cook et al., 2012) . IBV is the etiologic agent of infectious bronchitis (IB), which is a highly contagious, acute viral respiratory disease of chickens. IBV has been reported by many researchers all over the world (Jungherr and Terrells, 1948; Jungherr et al., 1956; Fabricant, 1998; Yu et al., 2001; Benyeda et al., 2009; Sjaak De Wit et al., 2011; Westerbeck and Machamer, 2019; Wu et al., 2019) . IBV has led to severe losses in the poultry industry (Jordan, 2017) , the direct losses are due to highly mortality, poor egg quality, and meat production, and the indirect losses result in increased costs and challenges in IBV prevention (Liang et al., 2019) . At present, live attenuated vaccines are widely used for the prevention and control of IB. However, due to extensive genetic diversity of IBV strains, the vaccines are becoming increasingly inefficient, with poor cross-protection effects among different serotypes of vaccines (Mo et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015; Lin and Chen, 2017; Yan et al., 2018) . Meanwhile, due to the lack of coordinated effort to prevent the IBV, and the lack of proper surveillance plus the introduction of foreign strains to combat the IBV in certain regions, the prevention and control of IBV has become very difficult. Therefore, it is imperative to find an effective antiviral drug or agent for the prevention of IBV.",

Therefore, the use of traditional antiviral herbs with no obvious side effects on the human body is still a major focus. Some reports have confirmed that traditional Chinese herbs could effectively inhibit the infection and replication of various viruses (Li et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2017; Yi et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2019) . Hypericum perforatum L. belongs to the genus Guttiferae, which contains approximately 400 species all over the world. The extract of H. perforatum contains several active compounds, including flavonoids, naphthodianthrones, and phloroglucinol derivatives (Napoli et al., 2018; Barnes et al., 2019) . Several reports have shown that H. perforatum extract had antiviral effects, such as influenza A virus, porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), and HIV (Barnes et al., 2001; Birt et al., 2009; Pu et al., 2009a; Pu et al., 2009b; Pu et al., 2012) . Like influenza A virus and PRRSV, IBV also belongs to RNA virus, but these PRRSV and IBV belong to different viral families. Since H. perforatum could resist influenza A virus and PRRSV, could it resist IBV?",

Moreover, the purpose of this work was to point out the antiviral active ingredients of H. perforatum and its anti-IBV mechanisms. For this purpose, the relative messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels of IBV in CEK cells, tracheas, and kidneys were measured. The positive green immunofluorescence signal of IBV in CEKs was observed. In addition, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of tracheas and kidneys was performed, and the relative mRNA expression of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, MDA5, MAVS, and nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-\u03baB) in vitro and in vivo were analyzed. Finally, the antiviral principal chemical composition of H. perforatum extract was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/ESI-MS. In summary, our findings for the first time showed that H. perforatum extract had significant antiviral effect on IBV, and it might up-regulate mRNA expression levels of type I interferon via MDA5 pathway and down-regulate mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 through the NF-\u03baB pathway. The HPE was found to be composed mainly of hyperoside, quercitrin, quercetin, pseudohypericin, and hypericin, and a combination of these compounds could mediate the antiviral activities.",

HPW had a very weak effect on IBV and SEE had no effect on IBV. Therefore, it was determined that the antiviral part of H. perforatum extract was ethyl acetate layer.

            "text": "IBV has a variety of known strains, these strains continue to mutate, and more mutants continue to recombine, resulting in more diverse and complex genotypes and serotypes of IBV (Bande et al., 2015; Feng et al., 2015; Laconi et al., 2019) . Due to the poor cross-protection of vaccines between different serotypes, it is difficult to prevent and control IBV infection. Therefore, development of an effective antiviral therapy is a crucial strategy for treating IBV infection. In this study, the anti-IBV effect of the drug was studied by three kinds of methods, qRT-PCR, determination of TCID 50 , and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA). qRT-PCR is a method of measuring the total amount of products after each reaction cycle with fluorescent chemicals in DNA amplification. IFA is a method to detect the presence of specific antigens in cells after the cells were treated with fluorescent-antibodies. TCID 50 is the amount of infection in which 50% of the cells are infected by the virus. The anti-virus effect of drugs is often detected by qRT-PCR (Schnepf et al., 2009; Li et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2018) , IFA (Xu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2017a) and TCID 50 (Xu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2013) in antiviral research. And these antiviral drug reports are similar to our research, so we also used these methods to detect the anti-IBV effect of H. perforatum. Although qRT-PCR and IFA could not detect live viral particles, they were used as a supplement in this study, and in this study we used the method of TCID 50 , which is a general method for the detection of live virus (Leclercq et al., 2014; Petiot et al., 2018) . Therefore, the results of antiviral studies in vitro are also credible in this study. In addition, although the best way to culture IBV is to use chicken embryos or chickens, the IBV replication in CEK cells was tested in this study. Because if the virus doesn't replicate well, viral particles can also be reduced or even die, which in turn affects the antiviral effect of the drug. In this study, we showed that IBV can replicate well in CEK cells (Figure  2) , which is consistent with the research report (Zhang et al., 2018) , and HPE had potential utility as antiviral agents against IBV. Our results showed that the HPE can reduce virus mRNA expression level (Figures 3A and 8) and virus titer ( Figure 3A) . Additionally, the SEE had no inhibitory effects and the HPW had poor inhibitory effects (Figure 3) . The results suggest that the HPE, which contains an enrichment of the main effective substances, was the bioactive fraction of H. perforatum extracts.",

            "text": "Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org October 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 1272 with MDA5 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Belonging to acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) in pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), it is well known that MDA5 plays a crucial role in avian respiratory disease progression (Yu et al., 2017) , whose function is to identify various pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and activates mitochondrial antiviral signaling gene (MAVS, also called IPS-1/VISA/CARDIF) (Lin et al., 2006) , activated MAVS can recruit downstream interferon regulatory factor-3/7 (IRF3/ IRF7) (Shi et al., 2015) , leading to the rapid production of type I IFNs (Xu et al., 2005; Soulat et al., 2008) . NF-\u03baB system is a master transcription factor in the recognition signaling and host responses to immune attacks (Deng et al., 2018) . It is well known that NF-\u03baB mediates inflammation, and several cytokine are also linked to NF-\u03baB signaling to enhance the inflammatory responses, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 (Salminen et al., 2008) . Several reports have pointed out the MDA5 signaling pathways and innate immune cytokines were activated after infection with IBV M41 strain (He et al., 2016) . MDA5 signaling pathway was disrupted by cleavage of the adaptor protein MAVS in the JS/2010/12 strain of IBV infection (Yu et al., 2017) . The type I IFN response plays a critical role in resisting SAIBK2 strain of IBV (Yang et al., 2018a) . MDA5 signaling pathways and innate immune cytokine (NF-\u03baB and IRF3) were induced after IBV-M41 strain infection (Zhang et al., 2017b) . On the other hand, the report had shown that H. perforatum extract significantly downregulated the concentration of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in lung tissue for mice infected with an influenza A virus (Pu et al., 2012) . In this study, we found that mRNA expression levels of MDA5, MAVS, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, NF-\u03baB, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 were significantly up-regulated after IBV infection in vitro and in vivo (Figures 5, 9, and 10) . Meanwhile, we found that HPE may be up-regulate mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 by MDA5 signaling pathway, and down-regulate mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 through the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Figures 5, 9, and 10) , suggesting that HPE may be inhibit IBV by affecting innate immune cytokines.",
