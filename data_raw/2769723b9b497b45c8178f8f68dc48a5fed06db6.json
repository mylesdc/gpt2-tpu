            "text": "Bagaza virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, first isolated in 1966 in Central African Republic. It has currently been identified in mosquito pools collected in the field in West and Central Africa. Emergence in wild birds in Europe and serological evidence in encephalitis patients in India raise questions on its genetic evolution and the diversity of isolates circulating in Africa. To better understand genetic diversity and evolution of Bagaza virus, we describe the full-genome characterization of 11 West African isolates, sampled from 1988 to 2014. Parameters such as genetic distances, N-glycosylation patterns, recombination events, selective pressures, and its codon adaptation to human genes are assessed. Our study is noteworthy for the observation of N-glycosylation and recombination in Bagaza virus and provides insight into its Indian origin from the 13th century. Interestingly, evidence of Bagaza virus codon adaptation to human house-keeping genes is also observed to be higher than those of other flaviviruses well known in human infections. Genetic variations on genome of West African Bagaza virus could play an important role in generating diversity and may promote Bagaza virus adaptation to other vertebrates and become an important threat in human health.",

Although diverse studies have contributed greatly to our understanding of the transmission modes of BAGV [8, 12] and the pathogenesis of BAGV infection [13] , only one study has addressed BAGV genetic diversity, reporting a high homology >90% between Central African Republic, Indian and Spanish BAGV isolates [9] . In West Africa, there is a lack of data on BAGV genetic diversity. To fill this gap and gain better insights into BAGV molecular evolution, we characterized the full-genome of 11 BAGV isolates, sampled from 1988 to 2014 in Senegal and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Firstly, we assessed genetic distances, phylogenetically informative sites found in more than one sequence contributing to branch ordering, N-glycosylation patterns, recombination events, selective pressures on West African BAGV sequences and their evolutionary phylogenetic relationships with previously available BAGV genomes. Secondly, to assess evidence of future BAGV codon adaptation to human house-keeping genes, a bio-informatics approach was used for analysis of codon adaptation biases.",

Subsequently, in September 2010, BAGV was associated with a high mortality among game birds (Partridges and pheasants) in southern Spain, the first detection of BAGV in Europe and the first isolation from a vertebrate host [9, 10] .

Reverse-transcription was performed using the AMV kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following manufacturer's instructions and cDNA were stored at \u221220 \u2022 C. The polymerase chain reaction with each primer set was carried out in a final volume of 50 \u00b5L using the GoTaq \u00ae DNA polymerase kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 \u00b5L (around 10 \u00b5g) of cDNA was added to 45 \u00b5L of a RT-PCR mix containing 25 mM MgCl2, 10 mM of dNTP, 5X reaction buffer, 5 U Gotaq polymerase, 16.5 \u00b5L of nuclease-free water and 40 pmols of each primer (Sense and Antisense).

The disentangle recombination signals option was \"on\" and the linear sequence setting was used. The remaining settings were kept at their default values. Only events with p-values < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 that were detected by four or more methods were considered to represent strong evidence for recombination using 100 permutations and the Bonferroni correction [28] implemented in the RDP4 program to prevent false positive results. A chi-square test was used to determine if the sequence identity between a recombinant isolate and a given parent was significantly different both inside and outside the recombinant region. In addition, a BootScan analysis including the recombinant and the parental strains determined above was also performed to confirm these putative recombination events. The occurrence of recombination in BAGV genomes was also investigated with a method called Genetic Algorithms for Recombination Detection (GARD) implemented in Datamonkey web server (http://datamonkey.org) [29] , that estimates breakpoints based on a genetic algorithm. The statistical significance of putative breakpoints was evaluated through Kishino-Hasegawa (HK) tests; breakpoints were considered significant if their p value was <0.05. Separate Neighbor-Joining (NJ) trees were constructed for identified putative recombinant region and non-recombinant alignment partitions dictated by the breakpoint locations.

If recombination was identified, these potential recombinant sequences were excluded from further analyses to avoid inferential biases [30] . The non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio (dN/dS) is a widely used method to detect positive selection. The statistical test dN/dS permitted to distinguish diversifying or positive selection (dN/dS > 1) from negative or purifying selection (dN/dS < 1). Positive selection is inferred when the rate of non-synonymous (dN) substitutions is higher than that of synonymous (dS) substitutions (dN > dS). Episodes of positive selection in each gene of BAGV were analyzed using methods of estimation among individual sites and internal sites on branches of the phylogenetic tree. For this, a total of 9 alignment partitions were performed corresponding to C, prM, E, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 proteins. As site model, we used the single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) that estimated the difference between non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) rates per codon site at 0.1 significance level. The fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR) method which evaluated episodic positive selection at each site in the alignment at posterior probability \u22650.9 was also used [31] . The mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) was also conducted at a 0.1 significance level for estimation selective pressure changes among codon sites. Finally, branch-site random effects likelihood (Branch-site REL) analysis was used to evaluate evidence of diversifying selection on specific branches in the phylogenetic tree at a proportion of sites, considering p-values less than 0.05 as significant. All four methods were conducted with HyPhy package implemented in Datamonkey web server [29] .

            "text": "The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) is a measure of the synonymous codon usage bias making comparisons of codon usage preferences in different organisms and assessing the adaptation of viral genes to their hosts [35, 36] . CAI was applied in many recent studies involving humans and RNA viruses [37] [38] [39] . To know if there is evidence of BAGV adaptation for codon usage in humans, the CAI was calculated for each isolate. To calculate normalized CAI, full-length polyprotein sequences of West African BAGV isolates and previously available BAGV sequences from Spain were compared to that of human using CAIcal v1.4 program (http://genomes.urv.es/CAIcal/) [40] . First, we obtained a \"raw\" CAI (rCAI) and then, the CAI was normalized by the \"expected neutral CAI\" (eCAI) value based on 1000 random viral sequences using similar length, codon composition, GC-content and human amino acid usage. Indeed, a table for human codon usage containing the entirety of human coding genes is publicly available [41] . Based on this table, we created a new table where only the 3804 identified human housekeeping genes were considered [42] . Normalized CAI threshold was obtained by calculating rCAI/eCAI values and a value above '1' is higher than neutral and considered as evidence of codon adaptation to the reference set of codon preferences [40] . CAI values obtained for BAGV were then compared to those of others MBFVs well known to infect humans such as Dengue virus (DENV), Usutu virus (USUV), WNV, Zika virus (ZIKV) and Yellow fever virus (YFV), NKV flaviviruses (ModV and RBV) and ISFs (CxFV and AeFV), using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test with R program. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered as significant. Sequences of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were compared to human codons and used as negative control to provide an example that results for codon adaptation to human house-keeping genes are robust and not false positives or anomalies. As there are no known cases of human infection, or evidence of human adaptation for TMV, we expected all sequences to have a lower CAI threshold than the calculated CAI.",

Analysis of new characterized BAGV complete open reading frames (ORFs) was performed at nucleotide and amino acid levels including previously available sequences from CAR (isolate DakArB209_CAR_1966, accession No. AY632545) and Spain (isolate Spain_H_2010, accession No. HQ644143) into multiple sequence alignments. The polyprotein length of the newly sequenced West African BAGV isolates was determined with respect to gene sizes (Table 3) . Although the 5 UTR was similar in length, the 3 UTR of these West African isolates was either 10 nt or 137 nt longer than those of sequences from CAR and Spain, respectively. In the 5 UTR, positions 52, 55 and 93 had nucleotide changes that were distinguishable for West African isolates. Nucleotide changes A to C at position 52 and T to C at position 55 were seen in West African sequences, and a T to C change at position 93 was observed only in sequences of the isolates ARD54139_Dakar-Bango_SEN_1989 and ARA23139_Dezidougou_CI_1988. Interestingly, the 3 UTR can be divided into three sections; a proximal highly variable section constituted by the 139 first nucleotides following the stop codon, a second highly conservative section located between nucleotide positions 140 and 434 and a moderately variable distal region comprising the last 142 nucleotides. In this distal section, 3 UTR sequences of West African isolates presented insertions of 74 nt and 1 nt, compared to the isolates from CAR and Spanish (KR108244-6), respectively.",

            "text": "Most motifs linked to virulence previously described in these proteins of other MBFVs were conserved among BAGV isolates. However, some non-conservative mutations were identified in E, NS1, NS3 and NS5. In general, non-conservative amino acid mutations (nc) are spontaneous, rare, and hazardous, and then represent the main causes of genetic diversity. Thus, non-conservative mutations observed on BAGV genome could modulate viral phenotypes of particular isolates in mechanisms such as virus cell entry, replication, production of viral particles, and assembly, and cause modifications in post-translational regulation as previously demonstrated for other flaviviruses such as DENV [58] [59] [60] . The E protein is involved in cell receptor recognition, attachment, cell fusion, tropism, and virulence [58] . NS1 is the most conserved non-structural protein of flaviviruses. Associated with the other non-structural proteins, the NS1 protein plays an important function in viral replication and assembly and viral escape to host innate immune response [61] . The NS3 protein is the main component of the replication machinery and ensures multiple functions in viral evasion to host antiviral response and in production and assembly of infectious viral particles [62] . The NS5 protein is the largest viral protein that serves as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and performs multiple functions essential for viral replication, including processing the viral polyprotein, replicating the viral RNA. Sharing these motifs of virulence mostly with MBFVs, NKVFs and CxFV than with AeFV showed that BAGV could be more closely related to MBFVs transmitted by Culex mosquitoes and could explain frequent BAGV isolations mainly from mosquitoes of Culex genus and its capacity to infect vertebrates such as wild birds [1, 4, 5, 9, 10] . In addition, The West African BAGV isolates characterized in our study were mainly isolated from Culex poicilipes and Culex neavei mosquitoes which have been reported as potential vectors for flaviviruses such as WNV [63] . Culex neavei was also found as a competent vector able to transmit flaviviruses such as USUV and WNV [64, 65] . Despite no available data on Culex poicilipes competency to transmit flaviviruses, these two mosquito species belonging to Culex genus could play an important role in natural transmission of BAGV to vertebrates such as wild birds since another member of the Culex genus, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, has been found competent to transmit BAGV to mice [8] .",

            "text": "The phylogenetically informative sites identified on the BAGV genome located mainly in NS3, NS4B and NS5 proteins, respectively, could have a considerable impact in viral fitness on host for corresponding West African isolates. In addition, the prediction of the N-glycosylated sites at different positions on BAGV genome such as Asn2333 in NS4B and the NYSI motif at 153th position of the E protein showed that post-translational modifications may influence acquisition or loss of capacity in mechanisms such as pathogenicity, evasion of innate immune pathways. Indeed, flaviviruses NS4B plays an important role in replication of viral RNA facilitating the formation of replication complexes and modulating host innate immune response such as interferons, microRNAs and RNA interference, formation of stress granules and the unfolded protein responses [66] [67] [68] . A previous study had shown that N-glycosylation of NS4B of DENV does not affect the protein stability but causes a considerable reduction in efficiency of viral production [69] . Presence of a glycosylation site and an informative site in the viral NS4B protein could influence the efficiency of viral replication and the outer shape of the virion. The presence of the N-linked glycosylation motif NYS had been previously reported at 67/153th and 154th on the E protein of DENV and WNV (lineage 1 strains and some neuroinvasive lineage 2 strains), respectively, involving in receptor binding, viral morphogenesis, viral infectivity, and tropism [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . Since glycosylation is a means of evasion to immune recognition within the host by masking particular antigenic sites from recognition by neutralizing antibodies, it could increase the diversity of the glycosylation on viral proteins [75, 76] . Nevertheless, it could be important in future studies to determine whether the predicted glycosylation sites are really used (asparagine-linked) using specific enzymatic digestion by Endo H and peptide N-glycosidase (PNGase F) [77] . Our data suggest the ability of BAGV to develop phenotypically important variations and potentially adaptation to new vertebrate hosts such as humans. However, to understand better the impact of variation on these predicted N-glycosylation sites and the identified phylogenetically important variations would require in vitro studies with reverse genetically engineered infectious clones on mosquito or mammalian cell lines and in vivo experiments in mosquitoes or in animal models like mouse [78, 79] . However, antibodies against BAGV proteins or infectious clone are currently not available for BAGV.",

The E protein is highly important because it encodes the most important antigen with regards to virus biology and humoral immunity. Therefore, large-scale genetic changes in this region, as might be brought about by recombination, could have significant impact on virus phenotype [44] .",

These results suggested frequent purging of deleterious polymorphisms in the BAGV genome that could be associated with accumulation of synonymous mutations during BAGV transmission [83] . However, location of more significant episodes of positive selection in the E, NS1 and NS5 proteins indicated that they could represent preferential selection targets during BAGV evolution [84] . Indeed, the E protein of flaviviruses plays a crucial role in early steps of host cell binding and viral entry and represents a main target for immune responses influencing antigenic response and positive selection on the E protein is a hallmark of the emergence of flaviviruses [85, 86] . Positive selection episodes have been also previously reported for the DENV-3 capsid, however, the impact needs to be further investigated [87] . Likewise, non-structural proteins could also be targets of positive selection.",

Interestingly, West African BAGV isolates showed a higher evidence of codon adaptation than MBFVs well known to infect humans, such as WNV which is a major cause of human encephalitis in USA and responsible of recent outbreaks in Europe [107] and ZIKV associated with microcephaly in fetuses and newborns during the outbreak in Brazil in 2015 [91] .

Otherwise, the iPSC cells can also generate primitive neural stem cells (NSCs), which can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes [110] . These BAGV sequences data obtained in our study could be used not only in future viral studies, but also in development of reverse genetic reagents or reliable diagnostic tools for investigation of this virus in human populations.",
