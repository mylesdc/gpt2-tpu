We investigated AstVs circulation in bats in Mozambique and Mayotte, a small island in the Comoros Archipelago located between east Africa and Madagascar. Biological material was collected from 338 bats and tested for the presence of the AstV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase gene with a pan-AstV semi-nested polymerase chain reaction assay. None of the 79 samples obtained from Mayotte bats (Pteropus seychellensis comorensis and Chaerephon pusillus) tested positive; however, 20.1% of bats sampled in Mozambique shed AstVs at the time of sampling and significant interspecific variation in the proportion of positive bats was detected. Many AstVs sequences obtained from a given bat species clustered in different phylogenetic lineages, while others seem to reflect some level of host-virus association, but also with AstVs previously reported from Malagasy bats. Our findings support active circulation of a large diversity of AstVs in bats in the western Indian Ocean islands, including the southeastern African coast, and highlight the need for more detailed assessment of its risk of zoonotic transmission to human populations.",

Bats were captured using mist nets and harp traps. On Mayotte, rectal swabs were obtained with sterile rayon-tipped applicators (Puritan, Guilford, ME, USA) from 21 Pteropus seychellensis comorensis, and droppings were collected from 58 Chaerephon pusillus. Swabs and droppings were placed in 1.5 mL of Virus Transport Media (VTM; [10] ), and were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. In Mozambique, one rectal and one buccal swab were collected for each sampled bat. The two swabs were then placed in the same tube, containing 1.5 mL of VTM, and were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sampled bat species and number of tested samples are presented in Table 1. RNA extraction was performed with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Reverse transcription was performed on 10 \u03bcL of RNA using the ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase and Random Primer 6 (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) using a previously published protocol [10] . cDNAs were tested for the presence of the AstV RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) gene using a pan-AstV semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay [10, 11] . PCRs were performed with the GoTaq G2 Hot Start Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in an Applied Biosystems 2720 Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Electrophoresis were performed on 1.5% agarose gels stained with 2% GelRed (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA). Chi square tests were conducted to investigate the effect of the host species, sampling period (month), and sex, on the probability of successful detection of AstV RdRp genes.

A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo coalescent analysis was also performed, with the program BEAST, version 1.8.4 [15] , and the Shapiro-Rambaut- Drummond-2006 (SRD06) nucleotide substitution model [16] . A strict molecular clock and a constant population size were selected. The analysis was performed with a chain length of 60 million generations sampled every 1000 iterations, with first 10% trees discarded as burn-in.

            "text": "High genetic diversity was detected among AstVs sequences obtained from Mozambican bats (pairwise distance up to 45%), without strong support for host family or species restriction ( Fig. 1 and Additional file 2 for details), as commonly described for bat AstVs [8, 10, 11, 20, 21] . Most of the detected viruses clustered in large phylogenetic lineages, in particular for Triaenops afer and Hipposideros caffer, although statistical support was limited. Sequences of AstVs detected in Nycteris thebaica and Mops condylurus were mostly highly divergent and not included in larger genetic lineages comprising viruses of same bat family or the same geographic area (Fig. 1) . The limited genetic information available for AstVs in public databases [1] , as well as the high saturation of their genome [22] , considerably affects the resolution of phylogenetic trees. Current understanding of the long-time evolutionary history of Astroviridae therefore remains limited. In addition, ecological factors involved in AstV infection in bats need to be better assessed. High temporal dynamics of viral infection has been documented before [17] , and the risk of spillover to other hosts, including humans, has also been demonstrated to coincide with changes in bat behavior and population structure [23] . The high propensity of AstVs for host shifts highlight the need for a better assessment of zoonotic transmission risk to human populations, particularly in relationship to some unique aspects of bat immunology and ecology. The funding agencies did not have any involvement in the study design, implementation or publishing of this study, and the research presented herein represents the opinions of the authors but not necessarily the opinions of the funding agencies.",
