            "text": "The human coronavirus is a major cause of respiratory syndrome and in particular of a disease called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This disease spread rapidly from China to several countries during 2003. The enzyme called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Main Proteinase (SARS CoVMpro) is an important enzyme involved in the life cycle of the human coronavirus. The crystal structure of the SARS CoVMpro complexed to the inhibitor has been solved previously [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . This enzyme is a member of the cysteine proteinases and exhibits the typical catalytic diad, cysteine and histidine, in the active site [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Previous studies on substrate specificity indicated that the active site, including the binding site, of the SARS CoVMpro could bind specifically to a substrate containing 8 amino acids. These positions in the octapeptide were termed P5-P4-P3-P2-P1-P1'-P2'-P3' and the sequence Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Phe. This sequence is optimal for the proteinase from Transmissible Gastro Enteritis Virus (TGEV), but it is unsuitable for SARS CoVMpro [7] . Recently, investigations of substrate specificity against SARS CoVMpro proposed that the octapeptides with sequences of Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-Ala-Gly-Phe and Thr-Val-Lys-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Phe are optimal for cleavage by SARS CoVMpro. It is interesting to note that when the P3 position of this latter octapeptide was changed from Val to Lys it caused an increase in the rate of catalysis (k cat /K m ) of the SARS CoVMpro of 4.31 fold [13] . However, information on interactions between P3Lys of the octapeptide and the S3 subsite of the SARS CoVMpro remain unclear. Therefore, our research intends to study the interactions between P3Lys and the S3 subsite in order to investigate the amino acids in the S3 subsite that are critical for binding P3Lys of the octapeptide. In addition, the two octapeptides Thr-Val-Arg-Leu-Gln-Ala-Gly-Phe and Thr-Val-Ile-Leu-Gln-Ala-Gly-Phe were used to investigate these interactions. At the P3 position these octapeptides contained either a long chain positive charge or an aliphatic hydrophobic amino acid. This was proposed to prove that the P3Lys is a significant amino acid for binding in the S3 subsite of the SARS CoVMpro. Thus, molecular modeling techniques can be used to clarify this problem [14, 15] . In the present paper, we present the 2 ns conventional MD simulation of the SARS CoVMpro complexed with the octapeptide and compare this to an uncomplexed SARS CoVMpro, with the purpose of investigating the amino acids in each subsite, and especially S3, which are crucial to increasing the substrate binding. Hence, the results obtained from this research are very important in the understanding of the binding mechanism and catalytic mechanism of the SARS CoVMpro.",

It is believed that this structure was in the natural form and ready for substrate catalysis [14, 15] . Firstly, the structure of the SARS CoVMpro, obtained from the energy minimization, was subjected to primary MD simulation. To perform MD simulation the structure of the enzyme was set to the GROMOS96 43a1 force field with explicit hydrogen atoms in the aromatic rings. The simulation cell was created in a cubic periodic box with a minimum distance of 0.9 \u00c5 between the protein and the box walls. The enzyme was soaked with approximately 40,000 water molecules defined using the simple point charges (SPC) of water model. The Glu and Asp of the SARS CoVMpro were set a charge of -1. Lys was set a charge of +1. His had an added hydrogen atom at the B position. As the total charge of the system was -6, six atoms of Na + were added to the system to adjust the charge to neutral. Electrostatic interactions between charged groups at a distance of less than 3 \u00c5 were calculated explicitly. Energy minimization was performed by using 1,000 steps of steepest descent method. Longrange electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle-Mesh Ewald method (PME) with a grid width of 1.2 \u00c5 and a fourth-order spline interpolation. A cutoff distance of 9 \u00c5 was applied for Lennard-Jones interactions. To maintain the system at a constant temperature of 300 K, a Berendsen thermostat was applied using a coupling time of 0.1 ps. Pressure was held at 1 bar, with a coupling time of 1 ps. The time step was set as 2 fs and the simulation performed for 100 ps. The structure of the SARS CoVMpro obtained at the last time point (100 ps) was selected for further molecular docking studies.",

Among them, chain 2 was called the one turn \u03b1-helix and chain 7 was called the long loop. Previous research has determined the equilibrium point of the system of the SARS CoVMpro free form, and found that the enzyme reached equilibrium after 400 ps [14, 15] . Therefore, initially in this research, MD simulation of the dimer structure of the SARS CoVMpro free form was performed for 500 ps (Figure 1) . Then, the structure of the enzyme was snapshot and the new confirmation compared to the starting structure. It had a different conformation in the active site caused by movement of the one turn \u03b1-helix and the long loop chain of the enzyme. The RMSD value was calculated from this comparison and was 2.62 \u00c5. This result indicated that the structure of the SARS CoVMpro and, in particular, the active site obtained from this research differed from the crystal structure. However, this new structure was considered an acceptable conformation for further docking and MD simulation, since the orientation of the protein chains in the active site were consistent with previously reported research [7, 15, 20, 21] . During simulation, the protein one turn \u03b1-helix and long loop chain stretched their backbone. This movement resulted in an \"open mouth\" catalytic cleft between domain I and domain II [15] .

However, the S3 position of the SARS CoVMpro is composed of two Glutamic Acids (Glu47 and Glu166). To date, it is not known which Glutamic Acid interacts with P3Lys. Therefore, this research investigated this problem by studying the interactions of the enzyme substrate complex through MD simulations. In addition, the orientation of the docking octapeptides was superimposable over the peptidomimic chloromethyl ketone inhibitor. This inhibitor was specifically bound to the SARS CoVMpro in the crystal structure (PDB ID = 1UK4).

The results shown in Figure 5 demonstrate that the fluctuation of the amino acids in the active site (highlight of the amino acid residues number) of the enzyme complexed with P3Lys ( Figure 5A ), were lower than with the other octapeptide complexes or the free form. The RMSF in the enzyme complexed with P3Arg also had low values, but these were still greater than those seen for P3Lys (Figure 5B ). This is in contrast to the RMSF values in complex with P3Ile ( Figure 5C ) which they still remain high values. However, the value of the long loop chain (right highlight) is seen to be consistent for all structures. The results also indicated that in the enzyme free form ( Figure 5D ) the one turn \u03b1-helix moved during simulation, which is in contrast to the enzyme complexed with octapeptide P3Lys, where the one turn \u03b1-helix chain maintained its position. From the results of MD simulations, it was found that the octapeptides in which P3 is either Lys or Arg have not fallen out of the active site of SARS CoVMpro during simulation. At the first time period of MD simulations, these P3 have their side chains pointed out to solvent and that after the observed conformational changes these would then point upward to Glu47, and not downward to Glu166.

However, The P3Lys was bound more specifically than P3Arg due to the steric hindrance effect of the planar Arg side chain. The hydrogen bonds, water-bridges and electrostatic interactions between S3Glu47 and P3Lys (Arg) have been observed continuously until the end of MD simulation times. This phenomenon has not been previously reported and this research can propose that the characteristic of S3Glu47, with the negatively charged region it generates, is important for the binding mechanism of SARS CoVMpro.",
