We aim to study the health impact of air pollution, particularly among the elderly, in a tropical region. Methods: A daily time-series analysis was performed to estimate excess risk (ER) of various air pollutants on daily death counts amongst the general population in Singapore from 2001 to 2013. Air pollutants included particulate matters smaller than 10 \u03bcm, and 2.5 \u03bcm (PM 10 , PM 2.5 ), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), ozone (O 3 ) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ). The studied outcomes were non-accidental and cardiovascular mortality. Single-day lag and distributed lag models were studied and adjusted for confounders.",

Four stations located at road-sides were excluded from the study because they did not reflect the daily exposure to air pollutants amongst the general population. Our final analysis included data from 18 studied stations and data completeness for each studied station was assessed by calculating the proportion of days on which data was collected out of the number of days in operation. Aggregated daily air pollutant concentrations were calculated following the Air Pollution on Health: European Approach (APHEA) protocol with added modifications [13] . In summary, imputed annual mean concentrations for each station were subtracted from the station-specific daily concentrations of the same year to generate a set of 'centred' values. Using the centred values, the arithmetic mean was calculated across all stations by day and the average of the imputed annual mean concentrations were then added back to derive the daily values used in the analysis. Average meteorological values were derived from daily means of dry bulb temperature and relative humidity from 5 stations which selected based on the shortest proximity to the air monitoring stations provided by NEA's Meteorological Service division.",

Selection of lag-day variables and smoothing spline parameters were based on models giving the lowest quasi-Akaike's Information Criterion [21] . Dummy variables of SARS and FLU are used to control for impact due to the periods of 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemics respectively while PH and afterPH are terms for public holidays and the day following public holidays. After the core model was established and chosen for each mortality outcome, variables depicting the various air pollutants were added for the single-day lag models. Two-pollutant models were further constructed for pollutants with significant effects in the single pollutant model. For the DLMs, basis functions were applied with the lag-response relationship defined a priori using a 3rd degree polynomial. Polynomials had been used in previous air pollution studies to analyse the lag-response associations [22] [23] [24] . A 30-day lag structure, signifying a medium-term period of about a month, was used to observe cumulative effects and mortality displacement if any. As a sensitivity analysis, cumulative lag-response charts generated with DLMs using 2nd and 4th degrees polynomials are shown in the Additional file 1: Figures S1 to S4.",

Greater effects were especially found in the elderly. The impacts of other pollutants were generally insignificant however. The strongest evidence for the impact of air pollutants on mortality lie in the particulate air pollutants. In a recent meta-analysis, a 10 \u03bcg/m 3 increment in PM 2.5 was associated with a 1.04% increase in mortality with substantial regional variations (ranging from 0.25 to 2.08%) [27] . In a study from 20 cities in the United States, a 10 \u03bcg/m 3 increased in PM 10 was associated with significant increase of 0.51% in overall mortality, with no impact from the other air pollutants [7] . Another study from 38 cities in China similarly showed a 10 \u03bcg/m 3 change in PM 10 concentrations was associated with a 0.44% increase in daily number of deaths [3] . In Europe, PM 2.5 was significantly associated with overall mortality while NO 2 was not [5] . The ESCALA study (Estudio de Salud y Contaminaci\u00f3n del Aire en Latinoam\u00e9rica) which included 9 Latin American cities in the tropics (albeit non-equatorial) found a similar significant association between PM 10 and mortality [28] . In our study, we found an increase of 0.63 and 0.66% in overall mortality with every 10 \u03bcg/m 3 increase in PM 10 and PM 2.5 respectively from the single-day lag model. No significant impact on overall mortality was found from the other air pollutants. The lack of impact from other air pollutants despite some findings from other studies may in part be explained by the lower concentrations of these air pollutants in our study. For example, the NO 2 concentrations in our study were about half that of several published studies [22, 29] which found significant associations between NO 2 and mortality. Similarly, significant lower concentrations of O 3 was noted in our study compared to others [28] .",

            "text": "Since the hypothesis was first postulated by Seaton et al. (1995) , that ultra-fine particulates, less than 0.3 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter, may provoke more alveolar inflammation causing exacerbation of existing lung disease and increased blood coagulability than larger respired particles, the impact of air pollution on cardiovascular health has received great attention. In addition, air pollutants result in increase in risk of cardiovascular events via various pathways including oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, atherothrombosis, and arrhythmogenesis [2, 29, 30] . Increased levels of air pollutants have been shown to be associated with progression in coronary calcification on computed tomography scans [8] . The same meta-analysis mentioned in the previous paragraph found a 0.84% increase in cardiovascular mortality with a 10 \u03bcg/m 3 in PM 2.5 [27] . The ESCALA study from tropical Latin American also found a significant association between PM 10 and cardiovascular events [28] . In study of 8 cities in China, a 10 \u03bcg/m 3 in PM 10 was associated with 0.36% increase in coronary heart disease mortality, with significant associations also found for NO 2 and SO 2 [31] . A study from Korea found that exposure to PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, SO 2 , and NO 2 , but not O 3 , increased the risks of cardiovascular events and mortality [6] . In our analysis of the single-day lag model, we found an increase of 0.90 and 0.88% in cardiovascular mortality with every 10 \u03bcg/m 3 increase in PM 10 and PM 2.5 respectively. Interestingly, in the single-day lag model, the earliest significant effects on overall mortality were seen on the same day as exposure while the effects on cardiovascular mortality were primarily seen on lag day 3. Although both lags are fairly acute, this may indicate a relatively more delayed effect of air pollution on the cardiovascular system compared to the respiratory system (the respiratory system being in direct contact with the inhaled pollutants). Furthermore, although the pro-ischemic and pro-thrombotic effects of pollution may occur within hours of exposure [32] , it may take longer (eg. days) for cardiovascular mortality to occur. A similar finding was demonstrated by Costa et al., whereby the impact of air pollution on cardiovascular mortality was evident only on lag day 3 while the impact on respiratory mortality was more immediate [22] . We did not find an impact of other pollutants on cardiovascular mortality. The elderly is an increasingly vulnerable group and sensitive to the effects of particulate matter. The elderly tends to be frailer, have more co-morbidities and less physiological reserves. In the Chinese study, the effect of PM 10 on overall mortality in those less than 60 years old was insignificant but became significant in those aged \u2265 60 years old (0.57% per 10\u03bcg/m 3 increase) [3] . In the Netherlands, PM 10 caused increased overall mortality in all age groups but only caused significant circulatory disease mortality in those aged > 65 years old [4] . Multiple other studies have also demonstrated the ill effects from air pollution in the elderly age group. In our study, we found similar significant associations with overall and cardiovascular mortality with PM 10 and PM 2.5 in the elderly aged \u226565 years but not in those < 65 years. The significant effects on mortality were seen primarily in the acute phase of lag 0-5 days. Interestingly, for cardiovascular mortality, the effects turned protective at a cumulative lag of 30 days in the elderly. This suggests that the number of cardiovascular deaths was lower as compared to another 30-day window period where no exposure to particulate matter had taken place. This could be attributed to the \"mortality displacement\" or \"harvesting\" effect [23, 33] . In the elderly population, high level of short term exposure to air pollution may cause greater mortality, advancing deaths and depleting the 'at-risk' group early on, resulting in a follow-on period with a mortality rate that is lower than expected [23, 33] . In a study on air pollution and myocardial infarction, higher levels of PM10 were associated with short-term increased risk of MI, but later reductions in risk suggest that air pollution may be associated with bringing events forward in time (\"short-term displacement\") [34] . Another reason for the apparent lower number of deaths later on might be the subsequent protective measures (e.g. wearing masks, staying indoors) that alerted individuals or organizations put in place during periods of high air pollution levels. This may in part explain the lower non-accidental mortality in the younger age group at cumulative lag of 0-30 days.",

The metaanalysis used data mainly from European, American and Western Pacific regions, with only one study on hospital admissions that included data from south-east Asia [27] . The Global Burden of Diseases Study included data from tropical regions but air pollution burden was largely estimated from satellite data and also extrapolated and applied risk estimates of air pollution from other studies for places where such estimates were not available [1] . Moreover, studies have shown that seasonal changes, temperature and humidity variation may impact the relationships between air pollution effect and health outcomes [13] [14] [15] , emphasizing the importance of validating these findings in the tropics, where the climate is starkly different. In the APHEA study, there was higher effects of PM 10 on daily mortality in cities with a higher temperatures [13] and similarly in Korea, hotter temperatures accentuated the effect of PM 10 on mortality [14] . In our study, we found similar significant findings on the negative impact of particulate air pollution on overall and cardiovascular mortality. The estimates from our study, although not directly comparable to other studies, appear to be on the lower end of the spectrum.",

Firstly, due to the timeseries analysis nature of the study, unmeasured clinical variables (eg. comorbidities), which could affect the actual estimates of air pollution on mortality, could not be fully accounted for despite our best efforts in controlling for potential confounding factors in the models. Our Results highlighted in bold are statistically significant models also did not adjust for the transboundary haze episodes as we wanted to analyse the general exposure of the public to air pollutants, and not to distinguish between domestic and transboundary air pollution. Secondly, the impact of indoor air pollution was not assessed as this data was not readily available, but we believe such effect would be minimal as residents in Singapore do not burn coals for cooking in the houses. Thirdly, a 3rd degree of polynomials was used to define the lag-response relationship over a period of 30 days. A different parametric shape or a different degree parameter would result in different ER estimates. However, a sensitivity analysis using up to 2nd or 4th degree of polynomials showed that these differences were minute and did not affect our final interpretation. A fourth limitation is that we did not explore the inclusion of different concentration-response functions to describe the exposure-response relationship [35] . In our analysis, we assumed a log-linear relationship via a quasi-Poisson model. Lastly, correlation between the paired pollutants in the two-pollutant models potentially resulted in multicollinearity that produced some unstable estimates.",
