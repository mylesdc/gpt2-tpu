            "text": "Theta-defensins (h-defensins) are macrocyclic antimicrobial peptides expressed in leukocytes of Old World monkeys. The peptides are broad spectrum microbicides in vitro and numerous h-defensin isoforms have been identified in granulocytes of rhesus macaques and Olive baboons. Several mammalian aand b-defensins, genetically related to h-defensins, have proinflammatory and immune-activating properties that bridge innate and acquired immunity. In the current study we analyzed the immunoregulatory properties of rhesus h-defensins 1-5 (RTDs 1-5). RTD-1, the most abundant h-defensin in macaques, reduced the levels of TNF, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-8 secreted by blood leukocytes stimulated by several TLR agonists. RTDs 1-5 suppressed levels of soluble TNF released by bacteria-or LPS-stimulated blood leukocytes and THP-1 monocytes. Despite their highly conserved conformation and amino acid sequences, the anti-TNF activities of RTDs 1-5 varied by as much as 10-fold. Systemically administered RTD-1 was non-toxic for BALB/c mice, and escalating intravenous doses were well tolerated and non-immunogenic in adult chimpanzees. The peptide was highly stable in serum and plasma. Single dose administration of RTD-1 at 5 mg/kg significantly improved survival of BALB/c mice with E. coli peritonitis and cecal ligation-and-puncture induced polymicrobial sepsis. Peptide treatment reduced serum levels of several inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in bacteremic animals. Collectively, these results indicate that the anti-inflammatory properties of hdefensins in vitro and in vivo are mediated by the suppression of numerous proinflammatory cytokines and blockade of TNF release may be a primary effect.",

Defensins of all three structural families were first recognized for their antimicrobial properties in vitro. Collectively, the antimicrobial spectrum of defensins includes bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses [5, 6, 7] .

The peptides have a macrocyclic backbone that is post-translationally generated by pair-wise excision and head-to-tail splicing of two nine-residue segments derived from truncated a-defensin-related precursors [12] . The nonapeptides may be identical (homodimeric splicing) or derived from different precursors (heterodimeric splicing) thus amplifying the diversity of h-defensin gene encoded products. Six rhesus macaque h-defensin isoforms (RTDs 1-6) are expressed in neutrophils where they are packaged in cytoplasmic granules. Specific neutralization of RTDs in lysates of macaque neutrophil granules markedly reduced the antimicrobial activities of this preparation against E. coli, S. aureus, and C. albicans, indicating a prominent role for these peptides as components of the PMN antimicrobial armamentarium [13] .",

The protective effect in vivo correlated with the reduction of pulmonary inflammation and the suppression of several pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung homogenates. To further characterize the immunoregulatory properties of h-defensins, we analyzed the effects of natural hdefensin isoforms on cytokine/chemokine responses in stimulated human leukocytes and THP-1 monocytes, and tested the efficacy of RTD-1 in two mouse models of bacteremic sepsis.

To determine how RTD-1 modulates inflammatory responses of human cells, peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were incubated with different TLR agonists with and without 10 mg/ml of RTD-1 and evaluated for the release of soluble cytokines/chemokines. We initially tested the effect of RTD-1 on ssRNA (TLR8 agonist) induced responses of PBLs to compare human cell responses with those obtained in mouse SARS-CoV (a single stranded RNA virus) pneumonitis. As shown in Figure 1 , ssRNA stimulation of human leukocytes induced cytokines/chemokines similar to those observed in murine SARS-CoV pneumonitis including IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, TNF, CXCL8 (IL-8), CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1a), and CCL4 (MIP-1b).

As shown in Figure 5B , all h-defensin isoforms suppressed supernatant TNF levels with potencies, based on estimations of IC50, ranging from 1-10 mg/ml (0.5-5 mM). RTDs 2 and 5 were substantially more effective than RTD-1, whereas RTDs 3 and 4 were less active. Analogous experiments were performed to assess the effects of h-defensin isoforms on LPS-stimulated THP-1 monocytes. In these experiments RTD 1-5 inhibited stimulated TNF release and the IC50s once again varied ca. 10 fold (Fig. 5C ). Of note, the hierarchy of anti-TNF potencies was the same as that obtained in E. coli-stimulated blood experiments, i.e., RTD-5.2.1.4.3. Human a-defensin HNP-2 had no inhibitory effect on TNF release in either assay (Fig. 5B & C ; also see Fig. 2 ), and a physiologic mixture of HNP 1-3 also lacked TNF inhibitory activity (data not shown). In each of the in vitro experiments described above, we confirmed that the reduction of cytokine expression was not the result of cytotoxic effects on the target cells as trypan blue staining confirmed that cell viability was .99% at the end of each incubation interval. Lack of cytotoxicity was further confirmed by the finding that VEGF-A expression increased following RTD-1 treatment ( Fig. 1 ; discussed further below).",

In a previous study, RTD-1 suppressed pulmonary bronchiolitis and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by SARS-CoV, an ssRNA virus. RTD-1 treatment of ssRNA-stimulated PBLs suppressed the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Fig. 1) , and the anti-inflammatory profile was similar to that obtained in the SARS-CoV pneumonitis model. RTD-1 also suppressed cytokine/chemokine release by PBLs stimulated with other TLR agonists, including those for TLRs 2, 4, and 5, and the peptide suppressed TNF release stimulated by both Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria. Based on these findings we speculated that the effects of RTD-1 were due to the modulation of early interactions of leukocytes with inflammatory stimuli. RTD-1 was ineffective in neutralizing LPS, indicating that peptide binding of this TLR4 agonist is unlikely to be an important anti-inflammatory mechanism. This differentiates h-defensins from other antimicrobial peptides that bind and neutralize LPS [24] [25] [26] .",

The time scale of the inhibitory effects (minutes) suggests that h-defensin may disrupt the mobilization of TNF from the surface of stimulated cells. Since TNF plays a central role in triggering and sustaining inflammatory cascades [22, 23, 27] , h-defensin blockade of TNF may suppress subsequent inflammatory responses, thereby reducing levels of other inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in vitro (Fig. 1 ) and in vivo (Fig. 7B) . Alternatively, h-defensins may interrupt TNF autocrine circuits that amplify the effect of this acute phase cytokine. While suppression of RTD-mediated TNF release was a common feature of antigen-stimulated leukocyte responses in vitro, we have yet to identify downstream mechanisms that result in the down regulation of secondary pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. In this context, the effects of inflammatory mediator blockade is highly complex and context dependent, and likely involves crosstalk of signaling factors that are differentially induced by distinct TLR agonists and other stimuli to produce protective and/or pathologic responses [28] [29] [30] . Thus it is not surprising that the immunomodulatory effects of RTD-1 varied as a function of inflammatory stimuli.",

            "text": "Correlation of in vitro effects, such as those analyzed using whole blood, PBLs, and monocyte-macrophages, with effects observed in vivo (e.g., sepsis models) must be interpreted with caution. In this regard, the relatively modest effects of systemically-administered RTD-1 on plasma cytokines in bacteremic mice contrasts with the dramatic down regulation of cytokines that occurred when leukocytes were treated with h-defensins in vitro; this apparent discrepancy is observed in many if not most in vitro/in vivo model comparisons. It is evident that the pathways induced by hdefensins in vivo (e.g., Fig. 7A and 8 ) require further investigation to delineate the mechanisms that confer efficacy in these models. In this context, RTD-1 treatment of PBLs produced a reproducible elevation of VEGF-A. However, the peptide had no such effect in vivo, and in fact significantly reduced VEGF-A levels in bacteremic mice (Fig. 7B) . In the lung, both protective and pathologic roles have been ascribed to VEGF and its physiologic regulation appears to play a critical role in the outcome of pulmonary acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome [31] . The induction of leukocyte VEGF-A by RTD-1 may represent a new mechanism whereby circulating cells are stimulated to release this vascular growth factor by locally expressed h-defensin. It is of interest to note the human neutrophil a-defensins inhibits VEGF-dependent neovascularization [32, 33] , potentially highlighting another difference between aand hdefensins. Studies are underway to analyze the mechanisms underlying the induction of VEGF-A in h-defensin stimulated leukocytes. Despite the fact that all known h-defensins have an invariant 10amino acid core structure (Fig. 5A) , five h-defensin isoforms varied significantly in their blockade of E. coli or LPS-stimulated inflammatory responses, and the hierarchy of anti-TNF potencies was the same in these two cellular assays. There was no correlation between peptide charge and anti-TNF efficacy; in fact the most effective (RTD-5) and least effective (RTD-3) peptides both have a net charge of +4. Human a-defensins shared none of the antiinflammatory properties observed with h-defensins. This is not surprising, given the lack of structural similarity between aand hdefensins [2] , and the fact that a-defensins possess pro-inflammatory properties that include up regulation of TNF and IL-1b expression by monocytes [34] , stimulation of TNF, IL-6, and IL-12 expression in myeloid dendritic cells [35] , and induction of IL-8 release by lung epithelial cells [36] [37] [38] .",

            "text": "The macrocyclic structure of h-defensins confers remarkable stability. RTD-1 was unmodified by incubation for up to 3 days in freshly prepared plasma or serum. RTD-1 was also well-tolerated when administered intravenously or subcutaneously to mice, rats, and chimpanzees. Following repeated injections, neither of two chimpanzees produced anti-RTD-1 antibody. The biocompatibility of RTD-1 enabled an evaluation of its therapeutic potential in animal models of systemic inflammation. The discovery of antimicrobial peptides and their proven roles in host defense has prompted studies to evaluate diverse peptides derived from human cells (LL-37 [39, 40] ), ungulates (indolicidin [41] )*** and sheep myeloid antimicrobial peptide (SMAP)-29 [42] ), and pigs (protegrins [24, 43] ) in preclinical bacteremia models. Protection against lethal bacteremia by LL-37 [40] , indolicidin [44] , and SMAP-29 [42] was observed following a single systemic administration of peptide at the time of bacterial challenge and therapeutic effects in Figure 7 . RTD-1 increases survival in E. coli peritonitis and modulates cytokine/chemokines. A. BALB/c mice were challenged with 8610 8 CFU E. coli K12 and treated simultaneously with s.c. injection of saline ( N ; n = 13) or 5 mg/kg RTD-1 (m; n = 13). Endpoint survival data are plotted and were subjected to x 2 analysis and P-value was #0.017 *) by day 3 or later. B. Plasma cytokines/chemokines were quantified in blood obtained from animals euthanized (n = 4 for each time point) at 0, 2, 4, and 12 h after i.p. challenge and treatment with saline ( N ) or 5 mg/kg RTD-1 (#). Sham controls were injected with RTD-1 alone (.). Cytokines/chemokines were quantified as described in Methods and results subjected to Student's t-test; P#0.05 (*). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051337.g007 each case were attributed to anti-endotoxic activities of the respective peptides. In contrast, in CLP sepsis, multiple doses of porcine protegrin PG-1 had little endotoxin-neutralizing effect and the treatment regimen produced no therapeutic effect compared to vehicle control [45] . Data presented here suggest that RTD-1 alters the course of disease in two models of bacteremic sepsis in a manner different from the above examples. Single dose administration of RTD-1 in either E. coli peritonitis or CLP sepsis produced a therapeutic response. In the former model, simultaneous but modest reductions in inflammatory cytokines were observed in RTD-1 treated animals. Surprisingly, a single dose of RTD-1 rescued mice rendered septic by CLP surgery even when treatment was delayed for 24 after peritonitis was induced. Efficacy of h-defensins in these models appears to be independent of direct anti-endotoxic effects since the peptide was ineffective in blocking the effects of endotoxin in the limulus amoebocyte assay. Current studies are underway to further characterize the mechanistic bases for the immunomodulatory activities of hdefensins in vitro and in vivo. The lack of immunogenicity and toxicity across species raises the possibility that h-defensin may have utility as human therapeutics. ",
