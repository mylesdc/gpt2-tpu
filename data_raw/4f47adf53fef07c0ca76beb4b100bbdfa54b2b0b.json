In particular, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident chaperones play key roles in synthesizing and processing viral proteins. Influx of a large amount of foreign proteins exhausts the folding capacity in ER and triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). A fully-executed UPR comprises signaling pathways that induce ER folding chaperones, increase protein degradation, block new protein synthesis and may eventually activate apoptosis, presenting both opportunities and threats to the virus. Here, we define a role of the MHV-68M1 gene in differential modulation of UPR pathways to enhance ER chaperone production.",

            "text": "As UPR initiates, the IRE1 oligomerizes and autophosphorylates the juxtaposed kinase domain. It subsequently activates its endoribonuclease function to remove a 26-nt intron from the precursor X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA. The spliced XBP-1 mRNA encodes a potent transcription factor that further activates UPR genes (e.g.: ERdj4) in the nucleus 6 . PERK activation resembles IRE1 as it undergoes oligomerization upon stress, induces autophosphorylation and activates its kinase domain. Active PERK phosphorylates and inactivates the eukaryotic translation factor-2 (eIF2\u03b1 ), attenuating global protein synthesis and thereby reducing the amount of new polypeptides entering the ER 6 . Unlike IRE1 and PERK, ATF6 is first transported from the ER to the Golgi under stress, where its cytosolic domain is released by protease cleavage and moves to the nucleus 10 . The nuclear ATF6 acts as a transcription activator of XBP1, and ER chaperone genes GRP78 and GRP94 11, 12 . It is important to note that the production of various ER chaperones is coordinated by the crosstalk between the three signaling branches. Previous studies have shown that under ER stress, GRP78 and GRP94 production is principally induced by the ATF6 pathway but is also partially controlled via the IRE1 pathways; likewise, although the IRE1 branch has a dominant impact on the induction of the ERdj4 gene, the ATF6 pathway is believed to play a role as well; moreover, XBP1, the central player of the IRE1 axis, is produced downstream of the ATF6 pathway [13] [14] [15] .",

Also, viruses are evolved to cope with the rapidly changing environment in the host. During the course of infection, a large amount of viral proteins are synthesized in a short period. Such demand pushes the cellular folding capacity to its upper limit which in turn can become a restricting factor to viral propagation. Therefore, most successful pathogens have evolved mechanisms to interact with the host chaperone network in order to create a favorable environment. For instance, the simian virus 40 utilizes chaperones for uncoating and entry into the host cells 16 ; the hepatitis C virus (HCV) requires the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone for protease maturation 17 ; both HCV and HBV are reported to involve a number of ER chaperones for viral protein folding 18, 19 ; and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) relies on chaperone cyclophilin A for virion assembly 20 .",

Two known human gamma-herpesviruses are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV). Persistent infections of gamma-herpesviruses are associated with a variety of human diseases including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma 21 . The narrow host range of human gamma-herpesviruses has limited their pathogenetic studies in vivo. We and others have been using murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) as a model virus to study gamma-herpesvirus infection 22 .

GRP78 is the most abundant ER resident chaperone and is highly stress-inducible 29 . The reporter construct (GRP78-fluc) used in the study contains the promoter region of GRP78 driving the coding sequence of firefly luciferase gene 30, 31 . GRP78-fluc was co-transfected into the 293T cells with PGK_renilla-luciferase (an internal control plasmid in which the renilla luciferase expression is driven by the constitutively active PGK promoter), and either individual ORFs of MHV-68 or a vector control. The reporter activity was measured by dual-luciferase assay 24 hours post transfection. From the screen, a strong induction (> 6-fold) on the reporter was consistently noted with multiple clones of M1 ( Fig. 1A and data not shown); in contrast, transfection with the sequence-related M3 showed basal-level activity comparable to that of vector control. The observed changes in reporter activity were specific for the stress response elements within the promoter region of GRP78, because M1 had no effect on the mutant reporter plasmid (GRP78mut-fluc) in which the response elements were eliminated 30 . In line with the reporter assays, the endogenous mRNA and protein levels of GRP78 were also upregulated in a dose-dependent manner with M1 expression as shown, respectively, by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 1B) and western blot analyses (Fig. 1C) .",

We speculated that in order to accommodate the newly-synthesized folding machineries, the amount or the size of the ER must have changed dramatically as described previously 32 . Indeed, electron microscopy analysis revealed a massive expansion of the ER in the M1-expressing cells as compared to cells transfected with the M3 plasmid or the control vector (Fig. 2) . The ratio of firefly luciferase activity to renilla luciferase activity was calculated based on the value of the vector control (set as 1). This assay and all following assays were performed in triplicates. Error bars show standard deviation. (B) Cells were transiently transfected with the M1 or M3 expression plasmids for 24 hours and were harvested for RNA extraction. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a primer set specific for GRP78 ( Table 1 ). The levels of GRP78 mRNA were normalized to that of GAPDH mRNA. The fold changes shown were calculated relative to the values obtained in vector-transfected cells (set as 1). (C) Cells were transfected as described in Fig. 1B and were harvested for western blot analysis using antibodies specific for GRP78 and \u03b2 -actin (loading control) as indicated. M1 and M3 genes were tagged with Human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and the expressions were shown using anti-HA antibodies. The lower panel shows the intensity of bands that was quantified from western blot analysis by measuring the peak height of the bands using ImageJ software. The intensity of bands in top and middle panel was compared to the intensity of vector control (which was defined as 100%). The relative intensity was calculated by normalizing the intensity of upper panel bands (GRP78) to the middle panel bands (\u03b2 -actin). (D) The promoter activities of GRP94 and ERdj4 were determined by reporter assay as described in Fig. 1A using the GRP78-fluc and ERdj4-fluc reporter plasmids, and mRNA levels determined quantitative RT-PCR analysis as in Fig. 1B using specific primer sets for indicated genes (Table 1 ). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 by Student's t test.",

The results also indicated that both M1 and M3 are secreted proteins, an observation confirmed in our study (Fig. S1 ) and by other groups 25, 28 . It has been well established that in eukaryotic cells, nascent proteins destined for secretion first enter the ER, where they are modified and assembled prior to transit into the secretory pathway. Indeed, both M1 and M3 proteins localize to the ER, as evidenced by significant co-distribution of the HA (M1/M3) and concanavalin A (Con A) signals (see below).

All four clones were also engineered with an N-terminal HA tag and a C-terminal FLAG tag. This arrangement allowed us to determine whether the N-terminal cleavage took place due to the presence of the signal peptide. Cells were transfected with individual clones and subject to western blot analysis using HA and FLAG antibodies respectively (Fig. 4B ). As expected, proteins bearing the M1 signal peptide sequence (i.e.: M1, M1SPF2, M1SPM3) could not be detected by the HA antibody (upper panel: Lane 1, 4, 6) indicating a cleavage at the N-terminus. In addition, IFA analysis revealed that all three proteins located to the ER (Fig. 4C ). In contrast, clones without the signal peptide (M1\u0394 SP, M1F2) were detectable by both HA and FLAG antibodies (upper and lower panels: Lane 2, 3), and IFA analysis showed that these proteins are distributed throughout the cells with no specific ER localization (Fig. 4C) . It is noteworthy that the HA antibody picked up a small amount of M3 protein suggesting that cleavage of M3 was incomplete when the protein is translated and processed (Lane 5). And the retarded cleavage became more evident in M3SPM1 expression (Lane 7) indicating that the M3 signal peptide causes slower cleavage than does that of M1.",

PstI cuts a site within the 26-nt intron in the unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u) but leaves the spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) intact. In cells expressing M1, an elevated level of XBP1s was observed, manifested by an increased amount of spliced products that are resistant to PstI digestion (Fig. 5A) . To quantitatively measure the splicing of XBP1, we employed a splicing-specific reporter system (pXBP1u-fluc). pXBP1u-fluc consists the coding sequence of firefly luciferase conjugated to the second ORF of XBP1u. Therefore, the luciferase is expressed only after IRE1-induced splicing removes the 26-nt intron 33 . Consistent with the PstI digestion results, M1 expression markedly increased the reporter activity to about 9-fold that of vector control (Fig. 5C) .",

It was later reported by the same group that secreted M1 protein act as a viral superantigen and is responsible for V\u03b2 4 + CD8 + T cell stimulation during MHV-68 infection in mice 28 . However, it has not been fully elucidated whether M1 plays a role inside the host cell. Here we discovered a novel function for the intracellular M1 protein. We found that M1 differentially modulate the UPR signaling cascades and preferentially induces the two chaperone-producing branches to activate ER chaperone expression. Specifically, the M1 protein stimulates the IRE1 and the ATF6 axes but spares the PERK pathway of UPR signaling (Fig. 7) . It is of interest that the virus selectively acts on the beneficial aspects of the UPR program while avoiding the detrimental features. One possible explanation is that the virus takes advantage of different stress sensing or activation mechanisms deployed by the three ER transmembrane sensors (i.e. IRE1, ATF6 and PERK). Although it is still unclear how these signaling proteins sense the ER stress, a recent study used the three-dimensional structure analysis to demonstrate that IRE1 activation is actually caused by direct binding to the unfolded proteins rather than by chaperone association as suggested earlier on 9 . This finding implicates that the three branches of UPR signaling network may be distinctly modulated at the initiation stage. We propose that certain undefined properties in the M1 protein leads to the differentiated modulation on the UPR sensors. Therefore, using M1 as a tool may offer a unique opportunity to dissect the mechanism underlying UPR sensing and regulation.",

We suspect that the 18-aa signal peptide of M1 protein plays an important role in switching on the IRE1 and ATF6 signaling axes through mechanisms that worth future investigation. Still, the presence of the intraluminal portion of M1 is critical to reach the full potential of its function in activating ER chaperone genes.

Accumulating studies have shown that viruses are able to engage the host chaperone machinery to support effective cell entry and nuclear import 16, [35] [36] [37] , viral genome replication 38, 39 , viral protein expression and folding [17] [18] [19] , and virion assembly [40] [41] [42] . In addition, examples have been found wherein viruses pack the host chaperons into the virion core before egress and that the incorporated proteins are necessary for invading new cells 43 . More surprisingly, some viruses can even encode proteins that exhibit chaperone-like activities to facilitate their infection (e.g.: TAg of SV40) 44 . Furthermore, host chaperons are also utilized by the viruses to manipulate other cellular processes. Earlier studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of chaperone proteins can protect cells against apoptosis and confer resistance to cytotoxic and antimicrobial drugs 45, 46 . Several reports further proposed that specific inhibition of the infection-induced chaperones may provide a solution to the appearance of drug resistant pathogens 47 . One recent study found that the inhibition of the Hsp90 chaperone in vitro and in vivo can prevent the outgrowth of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid 48 . Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests that improper activation of the UPR pathways and uncontrolled production of chaperones can adversely affect the immune response, a phenomenon exploited by certain viruses for an adaptive advantage 49, 50 . To sum up, by augmenting the expression of chaperone proteins can create an environment favorable to virulence and may have become a survival tactic among different viruses. In response to such high demand of cellular chaperones during infection, viruses have the urge to evolve mechanisms to boost the chaperone production.",

It is natural that different viruses adopt distinct approaches to tackle similar environmental challenges. For instance, previous studies have found that the M2 protein unique to MHV-68 enhances the cellular interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression to promote B cell growth and differentiation 51 while EBV encodes a viral IL-10 homolog to achieve the same goal 52 . Another example is the regulation of cell cycle through cyclin D: MHV-68 and KSHV depend on encoding the conserved viral cyclins 53 whereas EBV utilizes a viral gene (EBNA3C) to enhance the functional activity of cellular cyclin D1 for cell cycle progression 54 . Though relevant examples are lacking in regulation of UPR, previous work on human cytomegalovirus (beta-herpesvirus) has shown that viral infection can upregulate GRP78 expression without affecting the UPR pathways 55 , while studies on the herpes simplex virus type 2 (alpha-herpesvirus) revealed that the virus can encode a protein with chaperone-like activity. Therefore, although M1 is unique to MHV-68, we strongly believe that the human gamma-herpesviruses possess distinct chaperone-regulating approaches to achieve similar goals.",

The ability of M1 to selectively activate the UPR signaling presents a unique opportunity for defining the sensing and activation mechanism of individual UPR pathway. The wild-type M1 and M3 coding sequences (GenBank U97553) were PCR amplified from MHV-68 BAC DNA with an EcoRI site and Kozac sequence immediately upstream of the start codon and a Figure 7 . A scheme illustrating the effects of M1 on UPR signaling pathways. Our data demonstrate that the ER-localized M1 activates the IRE1 and ATF6 branches of UPR but spare the PERK axis to enhance the production of ER chaperone proteins.",

The two fragments were inserted upstream and downstream of a kanamycin-resistance cassette that contains an adjoining I-SceI site in a transfer plasmid with the backbone of pGEM-7zf(+ ). Using the resulting plasmid as a template, PCR was performed with primers bracketing the two sequence fragments and kanamycin-resistance cassette. The PCR product was subsequently digested with DpnI to eliminate the template plasmid, followed by gel extraction and electroporation into SHG68 competent cells harboring MHV-68 BAC, at 1.8 kV, 200 \u03a9 , 25 \u03bc F (1 mm cuvette). Positive transformed clones were then made subject to second round Red recombination that removes the kanamycin-resistant cassette. The resulting Kan-sensitive clones were confirmed by sequencing and expanded for BAC DNA purification. The viral BAC DNA was transfected into 293T cells with an equal amount of plasmids expressing the Cre recombinase to remove the BAC sequence. Three days post transfection, single viral clones were isolated through limiting dilution, validated by PCR, and propagated.
