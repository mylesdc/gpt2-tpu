The carbohydrate binding profile of HRL40 resembled those of Type I high-mannose specific antiviral algal lectins, or the Oscillatoria agardhii agglutinin (OAA) family, which were previously isolated from red algae and a blue-green alga (cyanobacterium). HRL40 potently inhibited the infection of influenza virus (A/H3N2/Udorn/72) into NCI-H292 cells with half-maximal effective dose (ED 50 ) of 2.45 nM through high-affinity binding to a viral envelope hemagglutinin (K D , 3.69 \u00d7 10 \u221211 M). HRL40 consisted of two isolectins (HRL40-1 and HRL40-2), which could be separated by reverse-phase HPLC. Both isolectins had the same molecular weight of 46,564 Da and were a disulfide -linked tetrameric protein of a 11,641 Da polypeptide containing at least 13 half-cystines. Thus, HRL40, which is the first Type I high-mannose specific antiviral lectin from the green alga, had the same carbohydrate binding specificity as the OAA family, but a molecular structure distinct from the family.",

These proteins have been found in a wide range of organisms in nature from viruses to animals and function as recognition molecules in many biological processes, such as host-pathogen interaction, migration of lymphocytes, and cell communication. Studies on lectins have mainly been performed for land plants and animals from the viewpoints of their physiological functions and applications as convenient tools in glycomics because of their capability to discriminate the difference in carbohydrate structures. Practically, a number of lectins have been isolated and characterized from land plants and animals, some of which are now commercially available and are even employed in clinical applications including carbohydrate profiling, blood typing, cancer diagnoses, karyotyping, and assessing the immunocompetence of patients [1] .",

In hydrophobic chromatography with stepwise elution of ammonium sulfate in PB, lectin was mostly adsorbed onto a HiPrep Phenyl FF column equilibrated with 1 M ammonium sulfate and then eluted with PB ( Figure 1A) . By re-chromatography of the non-adsorbed fraction, lectin was again recovered as PB-eluate in the same way. Both PB-eluates were combined and subjected to hydrophobic chromatography on the same column with a gradient elution (1.0-0 M) of ammonium sulfate in PB, in which the lectin was adsorbed and then eluted as a broad peak with 0.55-0.15 M ammonium sulfate ( Figure 1B) . The active peak fraction gave five major peaks in successive gel-filtration on a Superdex-75 column ( Figure 1C) . A major active peak obtained by gel-filtration was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a TSKgel DEAE-5PW column, affording a sharp protein peak with activity ( Figure 1D ). The purified lectin gave a single protein band of about 40 kDa and 10 kDa in non-reducing and reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), respectively ( Figure 1D ), and used for further experiments. The yield of the lectin, named HRL40 after the algal species H. renschii and its molecular weight, was 1.3 mg from 2 kg of the frozen alga (Table 1) .",

The binding preference of HRL40 for HM-glycans depended on the structure of branched oligomannosides; the highest binding activity was observed with oligosaccharides 11, 12 and 15 (binding activity, 100%), a little less binding activity with oligosaccharides 14 (89%) and 17 (74%), and moderate activity was with an oligosaccharide 18 (49%). Thus, the HM-glycans recognized by HRL40 possessed in common an exposed (\u03b11-3) mannose (Man) residue in the D2 arm of branched mannosides. On the other hand, no interaction was observed with HM-oligosaccharides 8, 9, 10, 13 and 16, which have a non-reducing terminal (\u03b11-2) Man attached to the (\u03b11-3) Man residue in the D2 arm. These results clearly indicated that HRL40 specifically recognized HM-glycans bearing an exposed (\u03b11-3) Man residue in the D2 arm and that the binding affinity could be impaired by the addition of (\u03b11-2) Man to the (\u03b11-3) Man residue. Otherwise, the presence of the (\u03b11-3) Man arm of a trimannosyl core, as well as the (\u03b11-2) Man attached to the (\u03b11-3) Man residue on the trimannosyl core, appeared to enhance the binding affinity because the lack of the residues lowered the binding activity, as compared between oligosaccharides 15 (100%) and 17 (74%), and between 17 and 18 (49%). The carbohydrate-binding profile resembled those of Type I HM-specific algal lectins (or the OAA family), such as the lectins from a blue green alga (cyanobacterium) O. agardhii (OAA) [15] and a red alga K. alvarezii (KAA-1) [12] as shown in Figure 3 .",

On the other hand, the masses larger than 13,020 Da may be derived from pyridylethylation at free cysteine residues where the mass increase by 105 Da each was observed. This estimation was also supported by the comparison of molecular weights of intact HRL40-1 and S-pyridylethylated HRL40-1 in the absence of a reducing agent ( Figure S1 ). Thus, this lectin contained a lot of disulfide bonds in the molecule. HRL40-2 was also analyzed in a similar way and almost the same results were obtained ( Figure S2) . Thus, the protein structures of HRL40-1 and HRL40-2 appear to be quite different from those of Type I HM-specific algal lectins (the OAA family), which are monomeric proteins and have one or no cysteine residues in the molecule [6, 10, 15, 29] .

HRL40-1 and HRL40-2 were examined for their N-terminal sequences by a protein sequencer (Procise 492-HT, Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA). However, the N-terminal amino acids cannot be sequenced, probably due to the modification at their N-termini. The treatment with 6 N HCl followed by the enzyme digestion with Pfu pyroglutamate aminopeptidase for deblocking formyl and pyroglutamyl groups were not effective in determining the N-terminal amino acids of both isolectins.

            "text": "HM-binding lectins have been attracting attention because they showed potent anti-viral activities by inhibiting the entry of viruses to the target host cells through binding with the viral envelope glycoproteins containing HM-glycans. We recently discovered and characterized HMbinding lectins from lower organisms, including marine algae and a blue-green alga (cyanobacterium) [6, [8] [9] [10] 12, 15] . They were strictly specific for HM-glycans and most of them have no affinity for monosaccharides, including mannose and are thermostable monomeric proteins. We demonstrated that these HM-specific lectins thus far isolated by our group can be subdivided into four families (Types I-IV) based on their primary structures and recognition modes of branched mannosides [30] . Among them, Type I lectins are specific for HMs bearing an exposed (\u03b11-3) Man in the D2 arm, and their binding activities are remarkably decreased with those having a non-reducing terminal (\u03b11-2) Man attached to the (\u03b11-3) Man residue. This group includes the lectins from several red algal species, such as E. serra (ESA) [6] , K. alvarezii (KAA) [9, 12] , K. striatum (KSA) [10] and a bluegreen alga (cyanobacterium) O. agardhii (OAA) [15] . From the cDNA cloning of a cyanobacterial lectin, OAA, we presented that the genes coding Type I lectin proteins are widely distributed in lower organisms [6, 12, 29] , including red algae and bacteria such as Myxococcus xanthus hemagglutinin (MBHA) [31] , Pseudomonas fluorescens lectin (PFL) [32] and Burkholderia oklahomensis agglutinin (BOA) [33] . MBHA and PFL were confirmed to inhibit the HIV-infection in the host cells using their HRL40-1 and HRL40-2 were examined for their N-terminal sequences by a protein sequencer (Procise 492-HT, Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA). However, the N-terminal amino acids cannot be sequenced, probably due to the modification at their N-termini. The treatment with 6 N HCl followed by the enzyme digestion with Pfu pyroglutamate aminopeptidase for deblocking formyl and pyroglutamyl groups were not effective in determining the N-terminal amino acids of both isolectins.",

The Type I HM-specific lectins (the OAA family) consist of two or four tandem repeats of the conserved domain of 66-67 amino acids. The crystal structures and NMR analyses indicated that the monomeric lectins of this family had the plural glycan binding sites in a polypeptide chain, in which two and four binding sites were formed by swapping between two and four tandemly repeated domains, respectively [36, 37] . The amino acid sequences were well conserved between domains as well as between the lectin species within this family [6, 12, 29] . In in silico search on GenBank database, the similar sequences have not been found in any proteins from animals, higher plants and green algae (Chlorophyta).",

            "text": "In this study, we isolated an HM-specific lectin, named HRL40 from the calcareous marine alga, H. renschii, for the first time. In terms of the oligosaccharide-binding specificity, HRL40 clearly belongs to the OAA family (Type I) because this lectin strictly recognized the HM-glycans having an exposed (\u03b11-3) Man in the D2 arm ( Figure 3) . Thus, HRL40 is the first Type I HM-specific lectin from the Chlorophyta. As seen in Figure 3 , the binding preference of HRL40 for the exposed (\u03b11-3) Man residue was markedly severe among Type I lectin family, promising the utility of this lectin as a valuable tool in the fields of basic and applied glycomics. To be exact, HRL40 potently inhibited the entry of influenza virus (A/H3N2/Udorn/72) to NCI-H292 cells with ED 50 of 2.45 nM, which was the highest anti-influenza virus activity that we have ever examined for lectins [8, 9, 13, 35] . In addition, the affinity constant (K D , 3.69 \u00d7 10 \u221211 M) of this lectin for the influenza virus envelope hemagglutinin was also remarkably high. Depending on the viral strain, the influenza viral hemagglutinins contain the HM-glycan(s) in the molecule, which is/are located close to the binding site for N-acetylneuraminic acid on the surface receptor of the target host cells [23] . It is therefore supposed that HRL40 inhibited the viral entry through binding to the HM-glycan of the viral hemagglutinin.",

            "text": "Despite HRL40 showing typical carbohydrate binding profile of Type I HM-specific lectins, its molecular structure was quite different from the family. HRL40 was an SS-linked tetrameric protein containing more than 13 half-cystine residues, in contrast to other lectins of the OAA family, which are monomeric and have one or no cysteine residues in the molecule. In addition, the presence of free cysteine residues was also suggested for this lectin ( Figure S1 ). We preliminarily prepared the peptide fragments of HRL40-1 using a few kinds of protease after S-pyridylethylation under a reducing agent and checked their sequences by nanoLC-MS/MS, and detected a lot of peptide fragments containing S-pyridylethyl-modified sequences. However, the peptide fragments having the sequences similar to the OAA family were not searched out. HRL40-1 and HRL40-2 shared the identical molecular weights and the number of disulfide bonds, but nevertheless they were clearly separated by reverse-phase HPLC ( Figure 6 ). It may be possible that both isolectins may differ in spatial structure or that they may have the substitution of a few amino acids, which does not affect the molecular weights. Due to the lack of available sequence information, including N-terminal amino acids, cDNA cloning of HRL40 remains to be clarified in the future.",

Kinetic parameters (k a , k d , K A and K D ) were calculated by fitting the data to the Langmuir model for 1:1 binding using the Biacore X100 evaluation software (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB).",

The lectin was strictly specific for HM-glycans having an exposed (\u03b11-3) mannose in the D2 arm of branched mannoside and showed potent anti-influenza virus activity through strong binding to the viral envelope hemagglutinin. The biological properties of this lectin resembled those of Type I HM-specific lectins from lower organisms (the OAA family). However, its molecular structure, which is an SS-linked tetrameric protein of a 11,641 Da polypeptide containing at least 13 half-cystines, was quite different from the family.",
