Several studies indicate that attenuated IBV vaccine strains contribute to the emergence of variant viruses in the field due to mutations and recombination. Therefore, there is a need to develop a stable and safe IBV vaccine that will not create variant viruses. In this study, we generated recombinant Newcastle disease viruses (rNDVs) expressing the S1, S2 and S proteins of IBV using reverse genetics technology. Our results showed that the rNDV expressing the S protein of IBV provided better protection than the rNDV expressing S1 or S2 protein of IBV, indicating that the S protein is the best protective antigen of IBV. Immunization of 4-week-old SPF chickens with the rNDV expressing S protein elicited IBV-specific neutralizing antibodies and provided complete protection against virulent IBV and virulent NDV challenges. These results suggest that the rNDV expressing the S protein of IBV is a safe and effective bivalent vaccine candidate for both IBV and NDV.",

It encodes five major structural proteins: spike (S), small envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and fifteen non-structural proteins. The S glycoprotein is the major antigen against which neutralizing and protective antibodies are produced. The S protein is partially or completely cleaved into the amino-terminal S1 and to the carboxy-terminal S2 subunits post translationally by a furine-like protease of host 4,5 . The S1 subunit is highly variable among different isolates of IBV. It is responsible for viral attachment to host cell and contains major neutralizing epitopes. The S2 subunit is highly conserved among IBV strains and contributes to viral fusion activity and elicits some minor but broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies 5-10 .",

Live vaccines have been found as one of the sources of IB outbreaks 12 . Live-attenuated vaccine strains also are not genetically stable and have a tendency to revert back to virulence 13,14 . Furthermore, circulation of live-attenuated viruses in the environment provides a setting in which the viral population may undergo mutations and recombination leading to creation of variant viruses 15,16 . Moreover, live IBV vaccines may cause pathological lesions or secondary bacterial infections in young vaccinated chicks 17, 18 . Inactivated IBV vaccines, which usually are administered by injection to layers and breeders are not an alternative for live-attenuated IBV vaccines. Inactivated vaccines of IBV do not elicit strong immune responses in chickens against circulating virulent IBV strains 19, 20 . The production and administration of inactivated vaccines are also time consuming and costly 13, 14 . Therefore, there is a great need to develop an alternative IBV vaccine.",

Recombinant NDV strain LaSota has been evaluated as a vaccine vector against several avian pathogens including IBV 28-32 .

The expression of codon optimized S2, and S proteins and non-codon optimized S protein of IBV strain Mass-41 by rNDV constructs was detected by Western blot analysis in DF-1 cells using a chicken polyclonal anti IBV serum ( Fig. 2A -upper panel and B). As the expression of non-codon optimized S was not detected clearly in the first attempt ( Fig. 2A) , we detected it in another attempt (Fig. 2B) . The expression level of codon optimized S protein of IBV was significantly higher than that of the non-codon optimized S protein of IBV. For the codon optimized S protein of IBV expressed from rNDV ( Fig probably represent uncleaved S protein (S0) or polymeric forms of S protein. The ~95 kD band represents S2 or S1 subunit of cleaved S protein of IBV. In the case of rNDV/IBV-S2 strain ( Fig. 2A-lane 1) , there are two bands (~170-220 kDa) on top, representing polymeric folded forms of S2 protein, a ~105 kDa band and a ~95 kDa band representing S2 subunit. The expression of S2 protein from a transcription cassette in which the signal peptide sequences of S protein was not fused with S2 gene was not detected (data not shown). Lane 4 of Fig. 2A and lane 3 of Fig. 2B represent rNDV as control. Lane 5 of panel A represents non-infected DF-1 cells. These results showed that codon optimized S and S2 proteins of IBV were expressed efficiently. The non-codon optimized S protein was also expressed from rNDV, but not efficiently and not consistently. A monoclonal anti-NDV/HN antibody was used to detect a ~70 kDa of HN protein of NDV in lysates, confirming similar level of NDV protein in each lane ( Fig. 2A-lower panel) . We further evaluated incorporation of IBV S and S2 proteins into NDV virions. The rNDVs expressing codon optimized S and S2 proteins and rNDV expressing non-codon optimized S protein were inoculated into eggs, 3 days after inoculation, viral particles in infected allantoic fluid were partially purified and analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 2C-upper panel) . Two bands (~170-220 kDa) on top, representing S protein, a ~95 kDa band and a ~60 kDa band representing S2 or S1 subunit of cleaved S protein, were detected in purified particles of rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C-lane 2) . The lane 4 of Fig. 2C shows two bands (~170-220 kDa) on top, representing polymeric folded of S2 protein, a ~105 kDa band and a ~95 kDa band representing S2 subunit. The lane 1 of Fig. 2C represents purified rNDV control and lane 3 of Fig. 2C shows purified rNDV expressing non-codon optimized S protein. These results suggested that the codon optimized S and S2 proteins of IBV expressed by rNDVs were incorporated into rNDV particles. A monoclonal anti-NDV/HN antibody was used to detect a ~70 kDa of HN protein of NDV in partially purified virions, confirming similar level of NDV protein in each lane (Fig. 2C-lower panel) . The expression of codon optimized S1 protein expressed from four individual rNDV constructs were detected by Western blot analysis in lysates (Fig. 3A) and supernatant (Fig. 3B ) of infected DF-1 cells, using a chicken polyclonal anti IBV serum. The lanes 1-5 represent infected DF-1 cell lysates of rNDV, rNDV/S1, rNDV/ S1 + IBV-S-TM&CT, rNDV/S1(cs\u2212) + NDV-F-TM&CT and rNDV/S1(cs+) + NDV-F-TM&CT, respectively. A ~130 kDa band representing expression of S1 by rNDV/S1 + IBV-S-TM&CT, rNDV/S1(cs\u2212) + NDV-F-TM&CT, and rNDV/S1(cs+) + NDV-F-TM&CT in lysate of DF-1 cells (Fig. 3A -lanes 3-5) and rNDV/S1 in infected DF-1 cell supernatant (Fig. 3B-lane 2) was observed. Our attempts to detect the incorporation of the S1 protein into NDV envelope were not successful, due to the difficulties in the detection of very low level of S1 protein by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Our results showed that the S1 protein was expressed at very low level by all the rNDVs based on Western blot analysis. Only the unmodified S1 protein was detected in the cell culture supernatant.",

To evaluate the protective efficacy of rNDV expressing S gene of IBV against a virulent NDV strain, groups of five 1-day-old chicks were immunized with rNDV, rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein and PBS. Three weeks after immunization, chickens were challenged with virulent NDV strain Texas GB in our BSL-3 plus facility. Our results showed that all chickens immunized with the rNDV and rNDV expressing codon optimized S gene of IBV survived after highly virulent NDV challenge, while all chickens in PBS group died at day 5 and 6 post-challenge (Fig. 9A) . Antibodies produced against IBV and NDV. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using a standard protocol of OIE was used to assess the level of antibodies mounted against NDV in serum samples of chickens 21 days after immunization. The results showed that HI titers of NDV was detected in serum samples of all chickens immunized with rNDV and rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein. There was no significant differences observed among HI titers against NDV in serum samples of chickens from groups immunized with rNDV and rNDV expressing S protein (Fig. 9B ). Virus neutralization assay was performed according to a standard protocol of OIE to assess the level of neutralizing antibodies mounted against IBV strain Mass-41 in serum samples of chickens at 21 days after immunization. The results showed that the neutralizing antibodies against IBV were detected in serum samples of chickens immunized with rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV and with commercial live attenuated IBV vaccine (Fig. 7D) . Neutralizing antibodies against IBV were not detected in 1:8 dilution of a serum sample from a chicken immunized with empty rNDV vector. This result showed that the rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV induces neutralizing antibodies against IBV.",

The S1, S2, and S genes of IBV strain Mass-41 were individually inserted between the P and M genes of rNDV strain LaSota. This site was chosen because it has been identified as the optimal site for insertion of foreign genes into NDV genome 26,34-37. Four different versions of IBV S1 gene were used to identify the version that is expressed at the highest level and incorporated into NDV particles. We were able to recover all the recombinant viruses and their growth characteristics were similar to rLaSota. However, the recombinant viruses containing IBV S gene grew slightly slowly than the parental virus. The viruses were stable after passages in SPF chicken embryos. Western blot analysis showed that chicken codon optimized S2 and S proteins were expressed at much higher levels and were incorporated into NDV particles. Whereas, all the four versions of S1 protein were detected at very low levels by Western blot analysis. It is noteworthy that the unmodified S1 protein was detected in the infected cell culture supernatant, indicating that the modification of S1 protein probably caused retention of the protein in the cell. These results suggest that the S2 protein acts as a chaperone to assist in the folding of the S1 protein. The S1 protein is folded incorrectly in the absence of S2 protein and the new structure probably causes loss of some conformational epitopes for IBV antibodies.",

Our results showed that the S protein, which contains both S1 and S2 proteins, is the best protective antigen of IBV. The S2 protein lacks major neutralizing epitopes which are present in the S1 protein, hence it is not an effective antigen. The S1 protein contains major neutralizing epitopes, but it losses some conformational epitopes when expressed separately. Although in the first study we showed that rNDV expressing S protein provided enhanced protection, it could not reduce virus shedding, indicating that we needed to determine whether the elimination of virus shedding would probably require a much higher level of immune response than that is induced by rNDV expressing S protein or would require the optimization of the IBV protection study. In this study, our results support previous reports that rNDV vectored IBV vaccines prevent disease but do not stop virus shedding 23, 24 . These results also support the recent report that a spike ectodomain subunit vaccine protects chickens against IBV 38 .",

Our results showed that a single immunization of 4-week-old chickens with rNDV expressing S protein completely protected chickens against IBV challenge based on disease and viral load in tracheas. Indeed, the level of protection conferred by rNDV expressing S protein was similar to that of a commercial IBV vaccine. However chickens immunized with either commercial live attenuated IBV vaccine or rNDV expressing IBV S protein showed very low levels of tracheal viral load. This showed that protection was greater when the chickens were immunized at an age when their immune system is relatively well developed. In the third IBV protection experiment, we showed that rNDV expressing IBV S protein protects adult chickens against a higher dose of virulent IBV challenge. However, compared to standard challenge dose of virulent IBV, a higher challenge dose of virulent IBV caused higher levels of tracheal viral load in adult chickens immunized with rNDV expressing IBV S protein and low levels of tracheal viral load in chickens immunized with commercial live attenuated IBV vaccine. Our result showed that although both the age of immunization and dose of challenge virus affect the results of IBV challenge, the influence of the age of immunization is greater than the effect of the dose of challenge virus.",

The expression of codon optimized S, and S2 proteins and non-codon optimized S protein of IBV were detected by Western blot analysis in infected DF-1 cell lysates, using a chicken polyclonal anti IBV serum (A-upper panel & B). The panel B was added to show the expression of non-codon optimized S protein clearly, since the expression of non-codon optimized S protein was not clear in panel A. For the codon optimized S protein of IBV expressed from rNDV (A-lane 3 and B-lane 2) two bands on top (~170-220 kDa) represent uncleaved S protein (S0) or polymeric forms of S1 or S2 protein. The ~130 kDa band, ~95 kDa band and ~60 kDa band represent S2 or S1 subunit of cleaved S protein.

In the case of rNDV/IBV-S2 (A-lane 1), there are two bands (~170-220 kDa) on top, representing polymeric forms of S2 protein, the ~105 kDa and the ~95 kDa band representing S2 subunit. Lane 4 of panel A and lane 3 of panel B represent rNDV as control. Lane 5 of panel A represents non-infected DF-1 cells.
