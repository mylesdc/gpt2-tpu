One challenge is to link phylogenetic trees to patterns of transmission. Particularly in bacteria that cause chronic infections, this inference is affected by variable infectious periods and infectivity over time. It is known that non-exponential infectious periods can have substantial effects on pathogens' transmission dynamics. Here we ask how this non-Markovian nature of an outbreak process affects the branching trees describing that process, with particular focus on tree shapes. We simulate Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes and compare different patterns of infectivity over time. We find that memory (non-Markovian-ness) in the process can have a pronounced effect on the shapes of the outbreak's branching pattern. However, memory also has a pronounced effect on the sizes of the trees, even when the duration of the simulation is fixed. When the sizes of the trees are constrained to a constant value, memory in our processes has little direct effect on tree shapes, but can bias inference of the birth rate from trees. We compare simulated branching trees to phylogenetic trees from an outbreak of tuberculosis in Canada, and discuss the relevance of memory to this dataset.",

Recently, the advent of next-generation sequencing has permitted the use of genomic data to assist in understanding outbreaks. Even small amounts of genetic variation within an outbreak can potentially be detected with whole-genome sequencing, and used to aid in reconstructing who infected whom 1-8 . Genomic data are typically analysed by inferring phylogenetic trees (phylogenies), namely trees in which the tips correspond to pathogen isolates from infected cases, and the internal nodes correspond to inferred ancestors. Phylogenies are usually rooted, binary trees. An ongoing challenge in epidemiology is to make the best use of genomic data, usually with the help of inference and analysis of phylogenetic trees that carry information on parameters including the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) 9,10 .",

In a branching process without multifurcations (ie where there is a positive time interval between successive branching events), the process defines a bifurcating tree moving forward in time; internal branch lengths reflect times between infection events, and pendant branch lengths reflect the time between an infection event and a sampling event. Under good conditions (where evolution is clock-like, within-host diversity is low and where sufficient diversity accrues across sampled individuals), a timed phylogenetic tree can be seen as an approximate representation of the true branching tree, though it does not include the information of who infected whom in a direct way. Indeed, the link between pairwise genetic diversity and who infected whom has been widely studied and discussed [6] [7] [8] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . These assumptions may break down for various reasons, but the study of branching trees remains a central tool for modelling phylogenetic trees.",

However, exponentially distributed (memory-less) infectious periods are not very realistic for many infections 23-28 . Non-exponential distributions in models of the spread of infection have been a topic of study for decades, and it is well established that incorporating memory in these processes can have large effects on the models' dynamics 24, 26, [29] [30] [31] [32] .

Several studies have suggested that tree shapes carry relevant information for epidemiology 21, [44] [45] [46] [47] , and tree shapes have recently been shown to have applications to inference from phylogenies derived from both viral and macroevolutionary data 21, 48 . Frost and Volz 21 noted that coalescent times are not sufficient to estimate epidemiological dynamics in complex models (such as structured populations), though they do very well in simple populations. They found that high transmission in the acute stage of HIV infection affected the asymmetry and the numbers of cherry configurations in phylogenies 21 . Recently, Hagen et al. 48 also found that variable speciation rates in macroevolutionary processes affect tree imbalance and produce trees that match the shapes of thousands of macroevolutionary trees better than trees from homogeneous processes. However, while asymmetry and cherry patterns capture aspects of tree shape, they do not describe it entirely. Incorporating tree shapes into the growing field of phylodynamics is an open challenge.",

We control either R 0 (the mean number of secondary infections) or the Malthusian parameter M (the mean rate of growth of the process), but vary the timing of infections, and explore how this affects the shapes of the outbreaks' branching trees. We find that contrary to our expectations, memory in the process has very little direct effect on the shapes of branching trees. Rather, it strongly affects the number of infected individuals (tips in the tree), and affects tree shapes as a consequence. It also affects estimates of the birth rate derived from branching times, and it affects the comparison between the branch timing and that expected under a Yule process. We find that phylogenies derived from data do not match the shapes of the constant-rate birth-death models even when the birth and death rates were fit to data, and we discuss whether this match should be expected.",

The length of the branch is either (1) the time between A's infection and A infecting B (if B is the first case A infected), or (2) the time between A's infecting the individual she infected just prior to B and the time A infects B. The pendant branch length to the tip labelled B is the time between either (1) B's infection and B's sampling (if B did not infect anyone) or (2) the time between B's last infection of someone else and B's sampling. In this way, the branching process defines a rooted, timed, bifurcating tree. While the focus of this paper is on how the shapes of these trees are affected by the intensity function describing when infection events occur, the motivation of the work makes the implicit assumption that these shapes are made relevant because under good conditions, timed phylogenetic trees are a reasonable approximation to these bifurcating timed transmission trees.

This can be very computationally time-consuming due to the variability of the tree size in branching processes. This complexity is part of the motivation for using simple intensity functions. To simulate non homogeneous trees, we wrote an iterative function that takes in input the ancestor, the start and final time of the tree, the intensity function and the life-span distribution: SimNHTree(ancestor, start-Time, finalTime, int, lambda). The branching property states that the subtree generated by each daughter of the ancestor is equal, in distribution, to the whole tree in every aspect but the starting time. To use this property we first find the number of daughters of the ancestor and their birth times, simulating a non homogeneous Poisson process with intensity int. Then, for each of the ancestor's daughters, the function SimNHTree calls itself with the daughter and its birth time as new input: SimNHTree(daughter i , birthTime(daughter i ), finalTime, int, lambda). This generates the ancestor's daughters subtrees which can be merged because we track each subtree's ancestor and start time.",

To do this, we use a simple algorithm that simulates a group of trees and if the total average of the tips is too high/low then the algorithm decreases/increases the final time and starts a new simulation. It stops once the average number of tips of each group is between 32 and 34 (to be comparable to our dataset) or between 98 and 102, in order to compare results in larger trees (Scenario 2-large). To exclude meaningless cases, we rejected trees with fewer than 5 tips. In each scenario, we vary the delay between becoming infected and infecting others, using different intensity functions (each labelled with a case number illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2(a)). In Scenario 3 we increase both the delay between becoming infected and infecting others (ie location of the intensity function) and the height of the intensity function.

However our non-homogeneous Poisson processes, in which cases survive their infectious period, have a Poisson offspring distribution.

In particular, as the start of the infectious period n moves further from the time of infection, the tree imbalance increases. A negative or null slope of both standardised Colless and Sackin imbalance is rejected with a p-value p < 10 \u22128 for both cases 1-4 and cases 5-8. The frequency of cherries is unaffected by memory if the R 0 is kept constant (p = 0.48). For cases 5-8 the frequency of cherries is decreasing, having rejected the hypothesis of a null or negative slope (p < 10 \u221215 ). The frequency of pitchforks shows a slight increase for cases 1-4 in (p = 1.3 \u22c5 10 \u22126 ) and decrease for cases 5-8 (p = 1.5 \u22c5 10 \u22124 ). Similarly the \"stairs 2\" feature 55 increases as n increases for cases 1-4 where the R 0 is kept constant (p = 1.4 \u22c5 10 \u22124 ) and decreases for cases 5-8 where the Malthusian parameter is constant (p < 10 \u221215 ). The normalised number of internal nodes with a single tip descendant (\"ILnumber\"), maximum heights and average ladder length increase when both the R 0 is constant (p 1.9 \u22c5 10 \u22125 , < 10 \u221215 , 9.9 \u22c5 10 \u22129 respectively) and when the Matlhusian parameter is constant (all p < 10 \u221215 ). Whereas it is difficult to visualise most topological differences, the increase in imbalance, standardised maximum height and average ladder can be appreciated from the example trees related to Scenario 1 in Fig. 5 . for instance the tree in (S1 case5) is more balance and has smaller ladders, in proportion to its tips, than (S1 case7) or (S1 case8).",

            "text": "However, the most dramatic difference between the various cases in Fig. 4 is in the number of tips. This was against expectation because the combinations final time-R 0 and final time-M were kept the same in cases 1-4 and 5-8 respectively (see Table 1 ). Particularly in cases 5-8 which have the same Malthusian parameter, the net growth is the same up to a (usually unknown) constant, and here it seems that this constant is highly dependent on the specific intensity function. This led us to ask whether the impact of memory on tree shapes in this context is just a matter of the impact of memory on the number of tips. To explore this question, we adjusted the time periods of the simulations to allow the different cases to produce branching trees of comparable sizes (Scenario 2). Fig. 6 shows the result. We now see lower differences between the processes. In the simulations where R 0 is kept constant, only the frequency of cherries, the \"stairs 2\" and the ILnumber show a statistically significant (p < 0.01) pattern. The cherry frequency and the \"stairs 2\" decrease (p of 0.2 \u22c5 10 \u22123 and 0.6 \u22c5 10 \u22123 respectively), whether the ILnumber increases as n increases (p = 0.3 \u22c5 10 \u22122 ). In the cases with constant M, more shape features showed statistically significant patterns. As the time between infection and the start of the infectious period grows, the cherry and pitchfork frequencies together with the \"stairs 2\" measure decrease (p of 10 \u221215 , 0.5 \u22c5 10 \u22123 , < 10 \u221215 respectively), whether the ILnumber, the maximum height and the average ladder increase (p of < 10 \u221215 , 0.3 \u22c5 10 \u22122 and 0.1 \u22c5 10 \u22123 respectively). Comparing to Scenario 1, adjusting for the size of the branching trees eradicates the some effects of memory, particularly in the simulations where R 0 is kept constant. In Fig. 5 , second row, some example trees for Scenario 2 were chosen. The shape difference between each other is not as evident as the trees from Scenario 1; there is a clear increase in the proportion of internal nodes with a one tip descendant (standardised ILnumber) from case 5 (11 nodes, 23 tips), to case 8 (14 nodes, 24 tips).",

The estimated values were used to simulate the homogeneous trees in scenario BDFit, please refer to Table 1 for the input values used. Data-derived trees had slightly lower imbalance and slightly lower normalised maximum height than the simulated trees once size was controlled (Fig. 6) ; the two inference methods differed more with each other in several shape parameters (cherries, IL number and stairs) than the data trees differed from the simulations. Comparing to Scenario 1, the variability in the data-derived trees was typically much lower than that in the constant-rate models and more closely matched the tightly defined simulations in cases 3, 4, 7, and 8, but then the number of tips in the data is fixed, and the numbers of tips in cases 3, 4, 7 and 8 were the most narrowly distributed as well.

Since the trees are ultrametric, the estimate of the birth rate should be equal to the Malthusian parameter.

When the delay is much larger than the pulse width (the duration of infectiousness), the branching events of each individual occur in a short time compared to the individual's life span, very much like a burst. In the limit where the \"burst\" becomes very short, each individual spawns offspring at a fixed time after infection. In this case, when we observe the tree, each individual has either reached this time, infected others and completed the infectious burst or not. In such a tree, shape features such as imbalance, the cherry-to-tips ratio and so on remain essentially unchanged over time. In contrast, if the delay is comparable to the pulse width, the first offspring of an individual may infect others before her \"youngest sister\" is born. This overlap can influence the shape because some part of the tree may not be born when the tree is observed at the cut-off time or when a chosen number of individuals is reached.",

This is a limitation, as branching events in phylogenies may not always correspond to transmission events in the outbreak. However, when within-host diversity is low, the pathogen evolves in a clock-like manner and accrues sufficient genetic diversity, the branching points in a phylogeny are likely to be very close to transmission events. A related complication is that the \"transmission bottleneck\" is not typically known; hosts may initially be infected with more than one pathogen lineage. Finally, hosts may be re-infected and carry multiple lineages as a consequence. We have chosen not to add these additional complexities to our exploration of memory and tree shapes. Indeed, if under models that capture within-host diversity or other complex features, transmission trees can be inferred 8, 67 , then comparing the shapes of those transmission trees to what might be expected under different intensity functions, as presented here, remains relevant. Challenges in the next generation of phylodynamics have recently been discussed elsewhere 10 .",

If sampling occurs through contact tracing, snowball sampling or respondent-driven sampling then this could have substantial effects on tree shapes, which are as yet uncharacterised.",

The number of possible tree shapes explodes exponentially in the number of tips, so specifying a shape in principle specifies a lot of information. Using shapes as informative summary features will require much more finely-resolved shape statistics than the few that are currently in use -mainly imbalance and the number of cherries. We have found that tree shapes are quite robust to variations in the waiting times between the onset of infection and infecting others. However, in our study, some shapes were strongly constrained by data (tree height, the average length of connected \"ladder\" components and the imbalance) and some were strongly affected by high R 0 and M (cherries, pitchforks, stairs and ILnumber). If this robustness to memory together with sensitivity to other aspects of the data, carries forward to an informative suite of tree shapes, shapes could provide an alternative approach to estimating epidemiological parameters such as R 0 and M using sequence data.",

The relevant phyloTop functions were then used with a function called treeListSummary. As inputs, this takes a list of functions (each of which return a topological property of a tree) and a list of trees. It then returns a data frame displaying the results of applying the input functions to the input trees. phyloTop has been made available on CRAN with a standard open source licence.",
