Table S1 shows a very strong preference for models with monthly-varying rates, which reproduce better the environmental drivers (as expected by comparing the middle and bottom rows in Manuscript Figure 3 ). It also shows a trend for the performance of model E over model C to improve going from \u2206T = 6 months to \u2206T = 1 month intervals. The latter effect is most likely due to the time-dependent external rate, \u01eb t , becoming free to vary more frequently and \"explain\" some infection events that would otherwise require a long-tail kernel. For convenience, the following discussion focuses on the results for \u2206T = 6 months (conclusions drawn from \u2206T = 1 month estimates being very similar). Table S1 shows no significant differences between the E and C models, except for site D1, for which model E is favoured. For the other census sites, the two models are essentially equivalent.

The iso-density curves for the E model ( Figure S1B) and for the C model ( Figure S1C ) are very similar down to densities of about 1km \u22122 (several hundred times less than the maximum density value). For lower values of the density, given that the internal sources of infection lie in the bottom half of the figure (geographical South), differences between E and C become visible in the top half (geographical North). In the northernmost region of the census site, the infection density for C is still non-negligible, although small, whereas the infection density for the exponential kernel is several orders of magnitude smaller. In the absence of external infection rate, such differences would clearly emerge from parameter estimation (e.g., giving DIC results strongly favouring the Cauchy kernel). However, when the infectious pressure generated by primary sources are added ( Figure S1 (D,E)), the differences disappear, and maps of potential infections generated by the two models are essentially identical. Hence, exponential and Cauchy models tend to converge in the presence of external infection. The scale of our observations (i.e., the size of the census sites), however, may play a role in this result. It is possible that, with data available at a larger scale, differences between the effect of long-range transmission (both density-and distance-dependent), modelled with a Cauchy kernel, and the effect of primary infection (only density-dependent) would be detectable.

For the 3-9 month period ( Figure S5(A1-A6) ), and to a lesser extent for the 6-12 month period ( Figure S5(B1-B6) ), the agreement of simulated and experimental summary statistics is good for all the intermediate times. The simulated autocorrelation functions for the 9-15 month period ( Figure S5(C1-C6) ) shows good agreement with the experimental autocorrelation functions up to 2 and 4 months from the beginning of the period ( Figure S5(C1,C2) ), and the discrepancy between simulated and experimental summary statistics observed in Manuscript Figure 5J emerges in the last two months ( Figure S5(C3) ). The discrepancy is most likely caused by a large above-average fluctuation of the primary infection rate \u01eb at month 15 (not shown here), or equivalently, by the fact that a higher-than average fraction of the new infections at month 15 was produced by external sources. Our model (with \u03b2 and \u01eb constant over the 6-month observation period) is not able to capture that effect: as a consequence, the model output contains a higher fraction of infections caused by secondary transmission, which in turn generate higher spatial autocorrelation, as found in our simulated data.",

            "text": "As a second example, we consider Figure S6 (C-E) for the spatial statistics of site D2 related to the 3-9 months observation period. The simulated autocorrelation function C 9 (d) ( Figure S6D ) is significantly overestimating the experimental autocorrelation function up to 300m. A similar effect is observed for the time-lagged statistic R 9 3 (d) ( Figure S6E ). Finally, simulated disease progress also consistently overestimates the observed disease progress ( Figure S6C ). The origin of the discrepancy in the latter case is clear: for two months (the first three red circles from the left in Figure S6C ), the observed epidemic spread very little (the cumulative infection count being: 26, 28, 34 infected trees at months 3, 4, 5, respectively). Monthly estimates of the secondary infection rate \u03b2 are consistently very small for months 4 and 5 (cf. Manuscript Figure 3I ). The offset gained by the simulated disease progress in the first two months is maintained up to the end of the observation period ( Figure S6C) ; thus, experimental disease progress \"lags behind\" simulated disease progress. The correlation between the positions of infected trees is generated when infection is transmitted from within the system (i.e., via secondary transmission), and increases with the number of sources of infection present in the system at a given time, I(t). Hence, a time lag between simulated and experimental number of infections, I(t), can generate a corresponding time lag between simulated and experimental autocorrelation. In Figure S6 , this hypothesis is tested in two stages: first, simulated and experimental spatial statistics are compared ( Figure S6(A-F) ); second, the experimental spatial statistics is artificially shifted forward in time and the comparison repeated ( Figure S6(G-J) ). In Figure S6(A-F) , we show the statistics at 5 months (A,D), 7 months (B,E), and 9 months (C,F) (respectively 2, 4, and 6 months from the beginning of the period, the latter corresponding to Figure S6(D,E) ). At 5 months (Figure S6(A,D) ) the simulated statistics (shaded gray) are already significant (as compared with the cyan dash-dotted line), while the experimental statistics (red lines) are not. The discrepancy between experimental and simulated statistics increases at 7 months ( Figure S6 (B,E)) and 9 months ( Figure S6 (C,F)). In Figure S6 (G-J), experimental statistics at 7 months ( Figure S6 (G,I)) and 9 months ( Figure S6 (H,J)) are compared with the corresponding simulated statistics calculated two months before, at 5 and 7 months, respectively. There is substantial agreement between simulated and experimental statistics with the 2-month lag, which confirms that the discrepancy in spatial statistics is mainly due to a delay of two months in the epidemic progress of the experimental system.",

In Figure S7 , we show that the spatial summary statistics used in the paper can discriminate between a \"good\" model (with exponential kernel and primary infection, cf. Manuscript Figure 5 ) and a wrong model that assumes negligible import of infection from outside (Cauchy kernel with very small primary infection). Model M \u2206T \u03b1 , \u2206T = 6 months, with dispersal given by a Cauchy kernel as in Equation (S5b), was fitted to the data for the Miami Dade site D1. The primary infection rate \u01eb was not estimated, but kept constant at a small value, \u01eb = 10 \u22126 (enough to initiate the epidemic, but negligible for subsequent epidemic dynamics). The estimated parameters were then used to generate simulated epidemic datasets and related summary statistics. The results (for the same time periods as in Manuscript Figure 5 ) are shown in Figure S7 . In the 0 \u2212 6 month period ( Figures S7(A,B) ), disease progress is inhibited by the small value of \u01eb, hence the results are not relevant to the present discussion. For the other periods ( Figures S7(C-K) ), although the progress of the epidemic is well reproduced (Figures S7(C,F,I) ), simulated spatial statistics (Figure S7 (D,G,J) and Figure S7 (E,H,K)) clearly and consistently overestimate experimental spatial statistics (compare with Manuscript Figure 5 for the exponential kernel with external infection).",
