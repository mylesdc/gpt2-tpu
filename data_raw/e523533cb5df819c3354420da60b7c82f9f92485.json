To monitor how transmissibility evolves and whether the countermeasures can reduce the transmission along the outbreak course, the effective reproduction number (R t ) is also a useful parameter.",

            "text": "The epidemic in the Republic of Korea (ROK) during 2015 was seeded from a traveller returned from Bahrain after visiting the United Arab Emirates and the KSA, and caused an outbreak of 185 confirmed cases. It has been the largest outbreak outside of the Middle East so far, 15 and much theoretical attention has been attracted to estimate its transmissibility. Hsieh 16 used a phenomenological model to obtain an estimate of R 0 ranging from 7.0 to 19.3. Xia et al. 17 and Kim et al. 18 used transmission dynamics models and obtained R 0 = 4.4 and 5.4, respectively. Reconstructing the transmission tree and considering the heterogeneity in the transmission processes, Nishiura et al. 19 estimated that the reproductive number throughout the whole outbreak has a mean of about 1.0 and a variance of 52.1 (it is worth mentioning that the mean reproductive number throughout the outbreak course is of no help for understanding the transmissibility of the causing pathogens). * These estimates differ from the studies based on previous MERS-CoV outbreaks [10] [11] [12] and show a quite diverse picture of R 0 for the ROK outbreak. In general, the transmissibility depends not only on the biological properties of a pathogen such as transmission mode and infectivity, but also on the susceptibility and contact patterns of the host populations. 1 The difference in transmissibility among different locations and ethnic populations highlights the importance of its setting dependency. It implies that given the same infectivity of a pathogen, the size and duration of the outbreaks it causes will depend on the contact patterns of the population attributable to their cultureassociated behaviours or geographical-related environment. Different from Westernised culture, Koreans have the tradition to visit relatives and friends in hospitals and can choose the hospitals that they think are the best for their treatment. This culture-associated behaviour along with increased infectivity in hospital environment 10,20 may have facilitated the spread of MERS-CoV in the ROK. 21 Both Xia et al. 17 and Kim et al. 18 used dynamics models to identify the main determinants of transmission in the ROK outbreak.",

This is also not true as the observed stage durations are non-exponentially distributed (see Appendix S1). They used the least-square methods to estimate the model parameters, which, in view of a huge amount of uncertainty and heterogeneity in the outbreak, 19 may not be appropriate. To comprehensively understand how these variations affect the estimation of transmissibility, a more general methodology such as Bayesian inference is needed which combined case data and the priors extracted from previous studies or direct estimates from the outbreak data.",

Although all transmissions occurred within hospitals, the affected hospitals were distributed across the ROK 21,22 so we assume the ROK population of size N=51 413 925 in mid-2015 24 are involved in the outbreak. On 4th May, all the people are assumed to be susceptible (S) except the index case who carried the virus but was not ill until 11th May. Contacts with cases will first become infected (E) and become infectious (I) after the latent period. In this study, we assume that latent period is equal to incubation. It has been noted elsewhere that asymptomatic MERS-CoV infections are not rare 23, 25 ; however, only three asymptomatic infections were detected among 16,752 close contacts during the ROK outbreak. 26 As these asymptomatic cases do not cause further infections, we assume that all infected people are symptomatic and admitted to hospitals and then being confirmed (C). It is worth mentioning that during the ROK outbreak, all transmissions occurred in hospitals. That is, the people who got infected (except the index case) are patients in hospitals due to other diseases or healthcare workers or visitors who visited friends and relatives there. Once confirmed, the cases would be put under security and isolation in designated facilities. The ROK outbreak data show that no infection was caused by confirmed cases so we assume confirmed infections do not contribute to the transmission process. 17, 18 Confirmed cases either recover or die.

In view of the intervention timeline shown in Figure 1, this effective breaking point indicates that both quarantining close contacts and informing the public the actual situation of outbreak could be the main countermeasures. Before this breaking point, R 0 could range from 5.4 to 9.1 depending on the day of the breaking point. These estimates well overlap with the statistical estimates. Although being significantly higher than the estimates based on the previous small outbreaks, our estimates are compatible with others on the ROK outbreak[16][17][18] and also the estimate on the 2014 outbreak in the KSA.14,34 In view of these analyses, R 0 of MERS-CoV before the effective intervention can be much higher than the threshold level in the healthcare-associated environment.

Understanding how these factors impact the transmission process can provide further information for the outbreak. For example, as far as the non-pharmaceutical interventions such as closing mass gatherings and school are concerned, it is important to explore the age-structured population dynamics of transmission. To identify how Korean culture-associated behaviour affects the spread, it is necessary to investigate the spatial and setting-dependent transmission dynamics. Even with these limitations, our dynamics model roughly catches the basic characteristics of the transmission dynamics during the ROK outbreak as evidenced by the agreement of its R 0 estimate with statistical methods and reasonable identification of breaking point in contact and diagnosis rates.Hence, it should provide useful information for us to understand the outbreak.Our estimate of R 0 is different from the previous, 10-12 which appears understandable. For small outbreaks or sporadic cases on which the previous analysis mostly based,13 the transmission processes end naturally without intervention. The ROK outbreak differed from the previous outbreaks in two ways: it was the largest outbreak outside of the Middle East so far and ended under the strong countermeasures. 21 Analyses indicate that transmission appears to be amplified in healthcare setting. 10,20,21,27,28,37 Specifically, Chowell et al. 12 who F I G U R E 4 Transmission tree reconstruction and estimation of effective reproductive number.

Notice the huge variation in Figure 4B, especially on day 11 (21st May), the R t has mean 27.8 and 95% CI ranging from 0 to 85. (The 97.5% level point 85 is not shown in the Figure 4B.) In the transmission tree that describes who acquired infection from whom among 185 cases, 162 cases (black circles except index case) know their unique infectors and the infectors of other 23 cases (red triangles) were reconstructed by method 7 modelled the progression of MERS-CoV cases in 2013 concluded that the relative contribution of hospital-based transmission is over four times higher than that of community transmission. This suggests another reason why the transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the ROK is much higher than the previous analyses because all the transmission events during the ROK outbreak were observed to occur in hospitals. This in return lends evidence that the healthcare environment is fertile soil for the transmission of MERS-CoV 14 and hints the importance of strengthening hospital infection control programmes.",

As they separated the two largest spread spreaders (of R = 80 and 24, respectively) from the whole system, the reproductive number during pre-intervention was estimated to be below the threshold level of 1.0. Nevertheless, it is interesting to notice the followings. Lee et al.28 based on survey22 to assume the date that intervention started was 7 June 2015, and the duration from illness onset to diagnosis reduced from 6 days to 2 days. The inference from our transmission dynamics suggested that the objective interventionstarted from 28 May 2015, and the delay from symptom onset to confirmation decreased from 9.3 to 4.1 days. Lee et al. 28 also assessed the effect of timing of control measures and like ours found that the early initiation of countermeasures can substantially reduce the size and duration of outbreak. A historical analysis 38 indicates the average trend that more than two new species of human virus are reported each year, which was further confirmed by the recent emergence of Swine flu, MERS-CoV, Ebola and Zika. Anticipation of novel virus species must be included in public health planning. Although we cannot predict their severity and transmissibility, learning from the past outbreaks and thus training our public health service system is an important part of our preparedness. One key lesson learned from the past outbreaks of emerging pathogens including SARS, Ebola and MERS-CoV is the setting-dependent transmissibility. For any potentially oncoming novel pathogens, it is hard (if possible at all) to predict their biological properties. The only strategy that can use as countermeasures is to reduce the contact rates such as closing mass gatherings and avoiding any unnecessary contacts. Hence, the knowledge is crucial about what changes in human behaviour and contact patterns help reduce the chance of their emergence and outbreak, or can avoid their rapid and large-scale diffusion among populations. Nevertheless, hospitals are clearly important settings for amplifying transmissibility, 37 many of which cases will be hospitalised, thus increasing the risk of exposing healthcare dynamics model identifies a breaking point at 28 or 29 May 2015 in contact and diagnosis rates. This breaking point reflects the consequence of changes in people's behaviour for selfprotection and Korean authority's designated facilities to isolate and quarantine the close contacts. Our estimates of the reproductive number of MERS-CoV before the breaking point are in agreement with others on the ROK outbreak, albeit significantly higher than estimates based on other small outbreaks and sporadic cases of MERS-CoV. The large-scale outbreak in the ROK was jointly due to the high transmissibility in the healthcare-associated setting and the Korean culture-associated contact behaviour. Limiting such behaviour by rapidly identifying and isolating cases and avoiding high-risk contacts effectively stopped further transmission.",

This further hints the reason why when MERS-CoV hit Westernised countries only limited transmission was experienced, but only causes a big outbreak in the ROK.Our dynamics modelling shows that facilitating early diagnosis by shortening the delay from symptom onset to confirmation and implementation of infection control measures such as self-protection and quarantining are efficient measures. Both reflect changes in people's behaviour upon knowing the outbreak situation. The first factor implies quick response and confirmation of the infected people so that the period they can transmit was decreased. The second factor reduces contacts, implying that keeping the community informed the true outbreak situation is important for control. The two interventions (self-protection and quick diagnosis) might be accomplished by different people: the latter can only be accomplished by those who became ill and their close contacts while everyone in the system can change their behaviours to become self-protected. In reality, it is likely that these two effects initiated in separate moments; however, the separate breaking points may not much impact the results as indicated in",

However, the simulations also indicate that if the countermeasures were delayed by 3 days, the outbreak size would double. Therefore, the lesson we learned from the outbreak is to rapidly isolate any suspected infected people who are hospitalised and their close contacts.",
