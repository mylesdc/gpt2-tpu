Chemokines, which are known to play a role in inflammation, are also involved in the remyelination process. We aimed to demonstrate that remyelination-stimulating factors are altered in the brainstem of 1-and 6-month-old taiep rats. We used a Rat RT 2 Profiler PCR Array to assess mRNA expression of 84 genes coding for cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors. We also evaluated protein levels of CCL2, CCR1, CCR2, CCL5, CCR5, CCR8, CXCL1, CXCR2, CXCR4, FGF2, and VEGFA by ELISA. Sprague-Dawley rats were used as a control. PCR Array procedure showed that proinflammatory cytokines were not upregulated in the taiep rat. In contrast, some mRNA levels of beta and alpha chemokines were upregulated in 1-month-old rats, but CXCR4 was downregulated at their 6 months of age. ELISA results showed that CXCL1, CCL2, CCR2, CCR5, CCR8, and CXCR4 protein levels were decreased in brainstem at the age of 6 months. These results suggest the presence of a chronic neuroinflammation process with deficiency of remyelination-stimulating factors (CXCL1, CXCR2, and CXCR4), which might account for the demyelination in the taiep rat.",

This demyelinating process has been associated with nitrosative stress in vivo and in vitro [3, 4] , glial-microglial activation and lymphocyte migration [4] , and an increase in lipoperoxidation, caspase-3 activation, and cell death in vivo [5] . The taiep rat has been considered as a chronic animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS) [6] , which is characterized by a remyelination failure in areas of chronic demyelination with absence of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and acute inflammation [7] . It has been suggested that astrogliosis in a microenvironment of chronic inflammation forms a barrier that impedes the OPC migration [7] . However, induction of an acute inflammation in areas of chronic demyelination can activate remyelination as proven in the taiep rat [8] . These results suggest that OPCs in the taiep rat are unable to generate myelinating oligodendrocytes due to the lack of the stimulatory factors and/or the presence of inhibitory factors [8] .",

To date, the immunological mediators involved in those differential cell processes in the taiep rat remain unknown. Several reports in different animal models [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and in human patients with MS [16] sustain the involvement of chemokines and their receptors in the CNS inflammation. Alternatively, chemokines also participate in myelin development. CXCL1 has been shown to play an important role in proliferation, differentiation, migration, and maturation of oligodendroglial cells and myelin synthesis [17] [18] [19] . Moreover, the deficit of CXCL1 and CXCR2 causes failure in the myelination process due to an aberrant migration of OPCs in the spinal cord white matter [20] . CXCL12 activating CXCR4 receptor has been involved in the OPCs maturation and remyelination failure [21] . CXCL12 also acts as a growth factor for stimulating the astrocyte proliferation and neuronal cells [22, 23] , via extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK 1/2) [24] .",

We used RT 2 Gene Profiler PCR Array to assess cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors and ELISA to measure CCL2, CCR2, CCL5, CCR5, CXCL1, CXCR2, and CXCR4. The measurements were made in the brainstem from 1-to 6-month-old taiep rats because this is the second region most affected and presents atypical cells at those ages [4] . The results were compared with those in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.

Aliquots containing 5 g of total protein were placed into wells of ELISA plates to determine chemokines and receptors in separate assay. Then, proteins were denatured by the addition of 100 L of 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 8.0) added into each well and the plate was incubated for 18 h at 4 \u2218 C. To block nonspecific binding sites, 200 L of 0.5% bovine serum albumin, IgG-free, was added to each well at room temperature (RT).

            "text": "Results obtained in this work support the idea that the taiep rat exhibits a chronic neuroinflammatory profile that Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity is different from other models of demyelination such as EAE. The major differences of taiep rats in comparison with EAE are that cytokines such as IFN-, TNF-, and IL-6 were unaltered but IL-1 and IL-10 were downregulated in 1-month-old taiep rats. In normal pups, the exposure to stress stimuli leads to decreased levels of IL-10 and IL-1 in serum [26] . Downregulation of IL-1 and IL-10 in the brainstem of taiep rats might be explained in part by the motor alterations of taiep mother and pups, acting as a stress stimulus. In addition, downregulation of TGF-1 was found in taiep rats. As TGF-1 suppresses inflammation and promotes neuronal survival in adult CNS, the lack of these effects could be associated with the increased neuronal apoptosis and necrosis in the brain of adult taiep rats [5] . The decrease in TGF-1 expression at 6-month-old taiep and SD rats might also be a sign of CNS aging. We found that GPR17 was downregulated in the taiep rats. This G coupled protein receptor is an important mediator of OPC differentiation and white matter repair that is expressed by a subset of OPCs to operate as an early sensor of brain damage [27] . Accordingly, inhibition of GPR17 expression causes impairment in oligodendrocytes differentiation and myelination in in vivo and in vitro systems [28] . Supporting this, GPR17 downregulation could contribute to alterations in remyelination in the taiep rats. Another coupled protein receptor that was downregulated in the brainstem of 6 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity 1-month-old taiep rats was FPR1 (formyl peptide receptor 1), which mediates the chemotaxis, activation, and cytokine gene transcription in phagocytic leucocytes in response to bacterial formylated chemotactic peptides [29] . These findings suggest that the immune response is decreased in the taiep rat, producing a predominant chronic neuroinflammatory process or astrocyte priming as was reported previously in cell culture [3] .",

However, CXCL1 mRNA was not affected in the taiep rats; the decrease of CXCL1 protein levels could be explained by instability of mRNA or a failure in its regulation. Related to the former suggestion, it has been reported that CXCL1 mRNAs contain adenine-uridine-rich sequence elements (AREs) in their 3 -untranslated regions (3 -UTRs) that exhibit constitutive instability.

Our results strongly suggest that the deficiency of the remyelinationstimulating factors such as CXCL1 and CXCR4 contributes to the failure in the process of remyelination in a microenvironment of chronic inflammation in the taiep rats. Further studies are needed to identify signal pathways and other mediators involved in the inflammatory response of the taiep rat.",
