There is excessive urinary wasting of uric acid resulting in hypouricaemia. Patients may be asymptomatic, but the persistent urinary abnormalities may manifest as renal stone disease, and hypouricaemia may manifest as exercise induced acute kidney injury. Here we have identified Macedonian and British patients with hypouricaemia, who presented with a variety of renal symptoms and signs including renal stone disease, hematuria, pyelonephritis and nephrocalcinosis. We have identified heterozygous missense mutations in SLC22A12 encoding the urate transporter protein URAT1 and correlate these genetic findings with functional characterization. Urate handling was determined using uptake experiments in HEK293 cells. This data highlights the importance of the URAT1 renal urate transporter in determining serum urate concentrations and the clinical phenotypes, including nephrolithiasis, that should prompt the clinician to suspect an inherited form of renal hypouricaemia.",

            "text": "The renal handling of uric acid is a complex and incompletely understood process [1, 2] . Uric acid is freely filtered at the glomerulus, the majority undergoes reabsorption via proximal tubular urate transporter proteins and a proportion (,10%) is secreted back into the filtrate in the late proximal tubule. Molecular genetic and genome wide association studies have recently allowed the identification of several proximal tubule urate transporters including URAT1 (alias SLC22A12) [3] and GLUT9 (alias SLC2A9) [4, 5, 6] . Proposed models of urate transport in the proximal tubule [7] suggest an initial uptake of uric acid from the filtrate by URAT1, coupled to organic acid transporters. GLUT9, in two different isoforms, allows for basolateral exit of urate from the proximal tubule (isoform I) and regulation of urate entry/exit at the apical membrane (GLUT9DN isoform). Finally, in the late proximal tubule there are transporter proteins mediating uric acid secretion (including ABCG2, NPT1 and NPT4) [7] . As uric acid excretion is mediated through molecular transporters, certain drugs such as fenofibrate, valproic acid, trimethoprim and losartan may be used to manipulate these processes [8, 9, 10] , thus allowing manipulation of serum uric acid levels.",

Recently Anzai et al. found mutations in SLC2A9, encoding GLUT9, in patients with severe renal hypouricaemia [22] . It is noteworthy that reports of idiopathic renal hypouricaemia secondary to mutations in uric acid transporters URAT1 and GLUT9 were initially reported from Japan, Korea and China [23] . More recently, three Jewish Israeli families of Iraqi origin have been reported to have renal hypouricaemia, with a common mutation in SLC22A12 [24] .

Clinical examination revealed that her abdomen was non-tender with no renal masses. A renal ultrasound scan (USS) revealed a single stone within the right kidney measuring 10 mm, without calyceal dilatation. Laboratory investigations on admission revealed normal renal function (serum creatinine 26 mmol/l, estimated glomerular filtration rate 123 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (according to Schwartz formula)). Although she was moderately dehydrated, she had persistently low serum uric acid levels ranging from 0.72-1.18 mg/dl. FE urate was elevated at 20.8%. Liver function tests, serum electrolytes, total protein and albumin were within reference values. Urinary excretion of cystine, calcium, phosphate, oxalate, glucose, low molecular weight proteins, amino acids and organic acids were also within reference limits. In order to clarify the etiology of urolithiasis, urinary excretion of xanthine and hypoxanthine was measured, showing normal values. Mutation analysis of SLC22A12 revealed a heterozygous missense mutation, leading to amino acid change p.R434C. Genetic screening of other family members revealed that her brother and father both carried the identical heterozygous change, but were asymptomatic in terms of renal stones, with normal renal ultrasound scan and no reported episodes of exercise induced renal failure. Biochemical evaluation revealed that the father had normal values of serum uric acid while the brother had moderately decreased serum uric acid level (1.56 mg/dl).",

Laboratory investigations revealed a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (pH 7.23, HCO 3 13.6 mmol/l, BE 212.6 mmol/l), hypokalemia (3.0 mmol/l), hypophosphatemia (0.84 mmol/l) and hypouricaemia (1.24 mg/dl). Simultaneous measurement of urine pH with electrode revealed value of 6.77 which pointed to distal acidification defect (expected urine pH,5.5). There was evidence of proteinuria on urine dipstix testing (1+) which was characterized with SDS-PAG electrophoresis as complete tubular proteinuria. There was a generalized hyperaminoaciduria, but no glucosuria. There was also evidence of uricosuria (FE urate varied between 24- 31%) and hyperphosphaturia (FE PO4 varied between 21-33%). Ultrasound examination revealed bilateral nephrocalcinosis and a solitary cyst in the left kidney measuring 10 mm. Following alkali therapy, metabolic compensation was achieved and her growth pattern improved. Following correction of the metabolic acidosis, the proximal defects of aminoaciduria and low molecular proteinuria resolved. Serum electrolytes also normalized, but there was persistent hypouricaemia during the two year observational period (1.24-1.36 mg/dl). Since the hypouricaemia was associated with an elevated FE urate , we undertook mutational analysis of SLC22A12 which revealed a heterozygous missense mutation, leading to amino acid change R434C. The mother of patient SK-3 (R434C) was also heterozygous for the R434C variant in SLC22A12. Biochemical evaluation confirmed she had a low normal serum uric acid level (2.3 mg/dl) with fractional excretion of urate of 19.3%. She had a normal renal ultrasound, but a past medical history of renal colic and passage of a single calculus 10 years ago. Patient SK-4: This 8 year old boy presented with recurrent attacks of visible hematuria and sensorineural hearing loss. A percutaneous renal biopsy was performed which demonstrated minimal glomerular abnormalities on light microscopy. Immunofluorescence studies did not reveal any immune deposits and electron microscopic analysis was not available. Given a clinical suspicion of Alport syndrome, genetic studies were performed, identifying a mutation in the COL4A5 gene. Following another attack of visible hematuria with very severe colicky pain, serum biochemistry revealed a low uric acid level. Repeated examinations of the uric acid confirmed persistent hypouricaemia, with high FE urate . Mutational analysis of SLC22A12 revealed a heterozygous missense mutation, leading to the amino acid change R347S. Genetic analysis confirmed that the mother of patient SK-4 was also heterozygous for the sequence variant R347S.",

The W258X variant of URAT1 is a typical mutation found in Japanese and Korean populations [23, 31, 37, 38] . Allele frequency of W258X in the general population in Japan was found to be as high as 1.9% [39] . Heterozygous carriers of URAT1 mutations are usually asymptomatic but they may develop nephrolithiasis. Prevalence of hypouricaemia in Japan varies between 0.15% [40] and 0.23% from the analysis of serum urate levels in 1730 school children [41] . In Korea, the prevalence of hypouricaemia in healthy adults is 3.3% [42] .

            "text": "Loss of function mutations affecting URAT1 have not been previously reported in a Caucasian population. However, single case reports from European patients presenting with clinical and biochemical features of hereditary renal hypouricaemia exist [44, 45, 46, 47] . Tzovaras et al. tested nine Greek subjects with primary renal hypouricaemia [48] . All had serum uric acid levels ,2.5 mg/dl, associated with a FE urate .10% and no other known cause of hypouricaemia. No definite pathogenic mutations were detected in this series and just one silent polymorphism (1246T.C) in exon 2 of the SLC22A12 gene was noted. It is questionable why hereditary renal hypouricaemia is apparently so rare in Caucasian populations. Either the prevalence of URAT1 mutations is indeed low in this population, or a decreased awareness of this disease and its presentation outside of the Far East allows cases to go undetected. Even in Japan, there are patients who have clinical features of renal hypouricaemia but no SLC22A12 mutations. Very recently, a genome-wide association study was performed in 6890 African Americans and 21708 European participants in order to try and identify risk alleles for elevated serum urate, associated with gout [49] . A novel URAT1 variant (G65W) was identified (rs12800450) and was associated with a reduction in serum urate of around 1.2 mg/dl per copy of the minor allele. Urate transport studies demonstrated a reduction in the urate transport for the G65W URAT1 variant [49] . This study validates heterozygous changes within URAT1 as a determinate of reduced serum urate levels. In this study the variant allele provided a protective affect against gout, but one may postulate that this may also be an at-risk allele for the hypouricaemia. Both biochemically and clinically, a single heterozygous change in URAT1 may be significant. Cheong et al. reported a W258X homozygous mutation in a 7 year old child, whose mother and brother were also heterozygous for W258X and had mild hypouricaemia and abnormally high FE urate , whilst his father who was also heterozygous for W258X, had a normal serum uric acid level of 4.6 mg/dL [23] . In the same report, an 11-yearold girl with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria and low serum urate was a compound heterozygote for W258X/R477H. [23, 31, 36] .",

Two additional reports have confirmed this finding [51, 52] . Matsuo et al. detected two heterozygous mutations in GLUT9 in two hypouricaemic subjects whom were negative for URAT1 mutations (R380W in exon 10 and R198C in exon 6) and confirmed their reduced transport activity in Xenopus oocyte expression system [51] whilst Dinour et al. recently described two families with recessively inherited hypouricaemia who were negative for URAT1 mutations [52] . Among hypouricaemic subjects in both families, three subjects had nephrolithiasis and three subjects had a history of exercise induced acute kidney injury. With genome wide homozygosity screen and linkage analyses they established SLC2A9 as a causative gene for renal hypouricaemia in these families. In these families, homozygous carriers of SLC2A9 mutations had very low serum levels of uric acid and extremely high values of FE urate (at around 150%).",

Inclusion of this case is helpful as the negative functional data and the transient hypouricaemia are consistent with this variant being benign. The dataset derived from the V388M variant allow a comparison to be made between it and the more functionally significant variants, acting as another negative control. Given the hypouricaemia was transient in this case, we do not assume that this sequence variant is causative. From our sequence variants of URAT1, mutations with an impact upon uric acid handling (when modeled in HEK293 cells) are associated with a persistent hypouricaemia.

Briefly, HEK293 cells [55] were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37uC and 5% CO 2 . Transient transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, the cells were grown 36-48 h before the experiments. Cellular uptake of [ 14 C]UA were measured in hURAT1 (or its mutants)-transfected HEK293 cells [55] grown on poly-D-lysinecoated 24-well plates. The cells were incubated in chloride-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing the following in mM: 125 Na gluconate, 4.8 K gluconate, 1.2 KH 2 PO 4 , 1.2 MgSO 4 , 1.3 Ca gluconate, 5.6 glucose and 25 HEPES, pH 7.4) for 10 min. The uptake study was started by adding HBSS containing [ 14 C]UA or to the plate. After 2 min, the cells were washed three times in ice-cold HBSS, then lysed in 0.1 M NaOH for 20 min followed by measurement of radioactivity by scintillation counting. The experiments were performed in quadruplicate per experiment and repeated twice. All the data are given as the mean 6 S.D. The Student's t-test was used to determine significant differences. A value of P,0.05 was considered to be significant.",
