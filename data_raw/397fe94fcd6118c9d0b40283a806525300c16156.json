S1 Appendix begins with a background section on Bayesian networks, and then steps through each section of Manuscript Fig 2. 1 Background on Bayesian networks Bayesian networks are a powerful tool for reasoning under uncertainty. They provide a graphical (and thus intuitive, visual and explicit) representation of relationships between components of complex systems, can manage incomplete domain knowledge, and are able to incorporate inputs from multiple scales and formats, including expert opinion [9, 10] . Bayesian networks have been widely applied in many disciplines, and have previously been used to support clinical and public health decision-making including by assisting in disease diagnosis [11, 12] , forecasting of epidemic spread [13] , and detecting outbreaks of rare pathogens [14] .",

Briefly, the model is based on a modified susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered (SEIR) compartmental model. At pandemic onset, the population is fully susceptible S to infection upon contact with an infectious individual. Individuals then enter an exposed class (infected but not yet infectious) where they can receive prophylaxis (E p ) or not (E np ). Infectious individuals can either present for healthcare (I) or not (A), and those who present can either receive treatment (I np,t ) or not (I np,nt ). Once recovered from infection (R Inp , R Anp , R Ip , R Ap ), individuals are assumed to be fully resistant to reinfection. The model also incorporates a dynamic \"contact\" label, applied to a fixed number of individuals drawn from the whole population each time a new infectious case appears. This allows simulation of targeted post-exposure antiviral prophylaxis (PEP). The Australian population was stratified into five distinct risk groups (young children, elderly, high-risk, health care workers, and the general adult population), to allow for differential risks of severe outcomes, differential benefits conferred by antiviral treatment, and targeted treatment and prophylaxis strategies. It was assumed that these groups mixed homogeneously. All simulations were performed as described by Moss and colleagues [1] . A schematic of the model structure is displayed in Figure 2 .",

The network also contains a decision node AVstrategies, representing each of the different antiviral strategies (including inaction), and a function IntModel that calculates the number of cases. The arrows from Scenario and AVstrategies to IntModel indicate that the number of cases will depend on both the pandemic scenario (i.e., transmissibility and severity) and the action taken (i.e., which antiviral strategy is employed).

It is important for decision-makers to consider the full Scenario posterior distribution, not just the expected values, due to possible underlying asymmetries of the posterior. Thus the figure also displays cases averted (values from Equation 5) for each of the pandemic scenarios, underlaid by a density plot of the Scenario posterior. This allows us to assess the relative number of cases averted under each combination of antiviral strategy and pandemic scenario, along with the scenario weightings specific to each hypothetical pandemic. The number of cases averted varies across pandemic scenarios under each of the antiviral strategies. Thus when the Scenario posterior is strongly weighted towards a high severity, low transmissibility scenario (as in Pandemic A), the expected number of cases averted is skewed towards higher values. Conversely when the Scenario posterior is strongly weighted towards a low severity, high transmissibility scenario (as in Pandemic B), the expected number of cases averted is skewed towards lower values. In the absence of situational evidence (and a uniform prior is used for Scenario), there is higher uncertainty around the expected value, since the Scenario posterior is also uniform. Figure 4 : Plots are shown for No evidence, Pandemic A (strong evidence of high severity, low transmissibility scenario) and Pandemic B (strong evidence of low severity, high transmissibility scenario) for each antiviral strategy. The plot for each antiviral strategy and evidence pair shows the cases averted for each pandemic scenario (coloured dots) underlaid by a density plot of the Scenario posterior, given the evidence (or the uniform prior, before situational evidence becomes available). The size of each pandemic scenario dot is also proportional to the Scenario posterior probability. The expected number of cases averted is indicated by the black bar through each plot. Each of the pandemic scenarios are labelled for antiviral strategy 'Rx all/PEP all', but not the other two strategies.",
