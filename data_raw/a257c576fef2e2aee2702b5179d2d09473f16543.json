This was highlighted by the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during a short-haul flight in 2002 [5] .

Most cases are reported after travel to developed countries in Europe or North America. At risk individuals are those with comorbidities, the elderly, smokers and the immunosuppressed. It is caused by inhalation of aerosols containing the bacterium and accounts for 2-15% of hospital admissions for community-acquired pneumonia, with a summer or autumn peak [45] .

Specific to schistosomiasis infections, Katayama syndrome should be suspected in travellers returning from Africa or South East Asia with fresh water exposure presenting with fever, eosinophilia, dry cough and urticarial rash. Other rare pulmonary presentation of helminths infections (such as paragonimus, toxocariasis and dirofilariasis) should be considered depending on travel destination and incubation period [71] .
