This study aimed at determining the potential impact of IFNL4 variation for the clearance of respiratory tract pathogens in Rwandan children (\u22645 years old, n = 480) seeking medical care for acute respiratory infections. Nasopharyngeal swabs were retrieved from all children at the first hospital referral and from 161 children at follow-up visits 2 weeks later. The swabs were analyzed for pathogens by real-time PCR and for host cell IFNL4 genotype at rs12979860 and rs368234815. Approximately 1/3 of the children were homozygous for the rs12979860 T allele and the rs368234815 G allele, which are overrepresented in subjects of African descent. These IFNL4 variants were significantly associated with reduced clearance of RNA viruses. Our results suggest that IFNL4 genotypes that are common among subjects of African descent may determine inefficacious clearance of RNA viruses from the respiratory tract.",

Polymorphisms in IFNL4, including rs12979860 and rs368234815, predict viral clearance in subjects infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Prokunina-Olsson, 2019) . Carriers of C at rs12979860 or TT at rs368234815 are thus more likely to resolve primary or chronic HCV infection than those carrying rs12979860 T or rs368234815 G alleles (Lindh et al., 2011; Griffiths et al., 2015; Prokunina-Olsson, 2019) . The unfavorable G allele at rs368234815 forms an open reading frame in IFNL4, and carriers of TT thus do not express functional IFN-\u03bb4 (Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013) . Details regarding the mechanisms that link variation in IFNL to clearance of HCV infection remain largely unknown (Rembeck and Lagging, 2015; Onabajo et al., 2019) . The frequency of the unfavorable IFNL4 genotypes is several-fold higher among Africans (35-40% TT at rs12979860) than among Esat-Asians and Caucasians (10-15% TT) Indolfi et al., 2014; The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2015 . These racial differences largely mirror the likelihood of resolution of HCV infection, which is considerably lower in subjects of African descent than in Caucasians (Indolfi et al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2014; Griffiths et al., 2015) .",

The realtime PCR was performed using the ABI 7900 384-well system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). In these analyses, Andersson et al., 2014; Elfving et al., 2016) . Genotypes at rs12979860 and rs368234815 were determined on host DNA recovered from the nasopharyngeal swabs using a 5'nuclease assay with allele-specific TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a reaction volume of 10 \u00b5l. Briefly, genomic DNA (3 \u00b5l) was added to a mixture (7 \u00b5l) of TaqMan genotyping master mix reagent and the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay mixture specific to the SNP being genotyped. Rs12979860 genotyping was performed using a predesigned assay (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA), while custom MGB probes (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and primers (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used for genotyping of rs368234815 at concentrations of 200 and 900 nM, respectively. Primer and probe sequences are provided in Table S1 . Assays were run on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA), in the following steps: allelic discrimination pre-read, amplification, and allelic discrimination post-read. The amplification step comprised a 10 min AmpliTaq enzyme activation at 95 \u2022 C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s denaturation at 95 \u2022 C and 1-min annealing at 60 \u2022 C. After allelic discrimination post-read, data were analyzed using the 7500 SDS software (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Automatic allele calling was employed to define SNP genotypes. Rs12979860 genotyping was performed in 477 patients (99.2% of the study population) among whom 161 had follow-up nasopharyngeal swabs (with 159 samples available for genotyping). Rs368234815 genotyping was performed in 156 out of 161 patients with follow-up nasopharyngeal swabs. Examples of allelic discrimination plots for IFNL4 rs12979860 and rs368234815 are shown in Figures S1 and S2 , respectively. ",

The formation of IFN-\u03bb4 is regulated by a dinucleotide frameshift variant, IFNL4-G at rs368234815, which is located within exon 1 of IFNL4 (Griffiths et al., 2015; Prokunina-Olsson, 2019) . Subjects carrying the G allele at rs368234815 are able to synthesize the IFN-\u03bb4 protein whereas those carrying TT/TT at this locus do not.

The mechanisms that explain the apparent disadvantage of the formation of IFN-\u03bb4 in defense against HCV remain to be defined. A commonly forwarded hypothesis takes the finding that induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) may render cells refractory to type I interferons into account. The formation of IFN-\u03bb4, a strong inducer of ISG, may thus compromise the anti-viral defense exerted by type I IFNs. The hypothesis is bolstered by studies showing that the intrahepatic expression of ISGs is elevated in HCVinfected patients carrying unfavorable IFNL4 genotypes and by reports showing that the expression of several ISGs heralds unfavorable outcome of HCV infection (Onabajo et al., 2019) .",

Our results thus largely mirror those obtained in studies of the impact of IFNL4 polymorphisms on the spontaneous or treatment-induced clearance of HCV-RNA.

The IFNL4 genotype did not predict clearance of DNA viruses or bacteria, which may imply that IFNL4 polymorphisms selectively or specifically regulates defense against RNA viruses. However, it should be considered that relatively few subjects in this cohort of patients were infected by DNA viruses and that the rate of clearance of bacteria was low. Confirmatory studies are required to establish the proposed association between IFNL4 polymorphisms and clearance of respiratory RNA viruses, including studies in adult populations.",
