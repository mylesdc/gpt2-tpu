            "text": "Immunochromatography (IC) is an antigen-detection assay that plays an important role in the rapid diagnosis of influenza virus because the protocol is short time and easy to use. Despite the usability of IC, the sensitivity is approximately 10 3 pfu per reaction. In addition, antigen-antibody interaction-based method cannot be used for the detection of influenza viruses with major antigenic change. In this study, we established the use of fluorescent immunochromatography (FLIC) to detect a broad spectrum of H5 subtype influenza A viruses. This method has improved sensitivity 10-100 fold higher than traditional IC because of the use of fluorescent conjugated beads. Our Type-E FLIC kit detected all of the H5 subtype influenza viruses that were examined, as well as recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins (rHAs) belonging to the Eurasian H5 subtype viruses and the Type-N diagnosed North American H5 subtype influenza A viruses. Thus, this kit has the improved potential to detect H5 subtype influenza viruses of different clades with both Type-E and Type-N FLIC kits. Compared with PCR-based diagnosis, FLIC has a strong advantage in usability, because the sample preparation required for FLIC is only mix-and-drop without any additional steps such as RNA extraction. Our results can provide new strategies against the spread and transmission of HPAI H5N1 viruses in birds and mammals including humans.",

            "text": "Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease of humans, caused by negative-strand RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza present global health problems involving morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. Influenza A viruses are classified into 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes, based on 2 viral surface proteins-hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Almost all possible combinations of HA and NA have been isolated from aquatic birds, poultry, and other avian species. In 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses were the cause of the first lethal human infection in Hong Kong [1, 2, 3] . This constituted the first identified transmission of an avian influenza virus directly from avian to human. The HPAI H5N1 virus in Hong Kong consisted of the HA gene that was derived from A/goose/Guangdong/1/96-like virus (H5N1; GS/GD/1) and 7 other viral gene segments derived from A/teal/ Hong Kong/W312/97-like virus (H6N1; W312) [4, 5] . The GS/ GD/1-linage viruses have been circulating with frequent reassortments, and one genotype, named type-Z, of 8 new H5N1 genotypes generated by reassortment became dominant in 2002 [6] . Since 2003, HPAI H5N1 viruses have spread from Asia to Europe and Africa, and have infected humans who have been exposed to infected poultry [7, 8] . Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene from isolated HPAI H5N1viruses formally identified over 30 distinct sub-clades of the virus [9, 10] . A recent study showed that clades 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and several second-and third-order groups from clade 2 have not been detected since 2008 or earlier [11] . The World Health Organization reported that the HPAI H5N1 virus has infected 620 individuals, causing 367 deaths (,59% mortality) as of 15 February 2013 [12] .",

IC is quick and easy to use, but has a relatively low sensitivity. The specificity is .90%, whereas the sensitivity is approximately 60% [18] . In addition, IC is based on an antigen-based principle, liked enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), meaning the low sensitivity of IC could be due to low activity of the antibody to the antigen, such as HA protein which is frequently mutated. Improvement of the sensitivity and reactivity of IC would make this technique an important tool in the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus. This study establishes specific antibodies for detecting influenza virus HA of the H5 subtype and shows that IC can be improved using antibodies conjugated with fluorescent beads (Fluorescent immunochromatography; FLIC). Although the FLIC strip has to be scanned by a fluorescent reader, the sensitivity is significantly improved. In addition, our combination of antibodies can detect a broad spectrum of H5 subtype influenza A viruses. Thus, FLIC is expected to provide new strategies for initial diagnosis of the human transmission of HPAI H5N1 viruses to humans.",

The LODs of FLICs for detection of H5N1 viruses are described in Table. 5. Compared with colloidal gold IC (Table. 3), the sensitivity of FLIC is several 10 times higher than that of IC. Improvement in sensitivity may cause a decrease in the specificity of the system. To confirm the specificity of FLICs, 10 7 TCID 50 of other subtype viruses, including HPAI H7N7 virus (A/ chicken/Netherlands/2586/2003), were tested (Table. 6 ). In addition, 1 mg/mL of 15 rHA of other subtypes, including Spanish influenza virus (A/BrevigMission/1/1918) and H1N1pdm (A/California/7/2009), were also tested (Table. 7).

Basically, diagnosis of influenza is made by detection of NP protein as a target antigen. On the other hand, for identification of the H5 subtype, it is necessary to detect the HA protein, which is in much lower abundance than the NP protein. This indicates that the sensitivity of IC would have to be improved. Additionally, IC is based on an antigen-antibody reaction, implying that it is not suitable for detecting emerging or re-emerging influenza viruses that are precursors of epidemics or pandemics. Thus, our goals for this study were to improve sensitivity of IC and establish a pair of antibodies that efficiently covers almost all H5 subtype HAs.",

Nevertheless, the FLIC reader provides objective measurement of positive signals. The LODs of Type-E and Type-N FLIC are 8.54610 3 pfu or 2.63610 3 pfu (per 100 ml sample solution), respectively, and these are almost equal to the LODs of commercial IC kits detecting viral NP protein (10 2 -10 4 TCID 50 /reaction) [17] .

Alert phase is defined as the time when influenza caused by a new subtype has been identified in humans. At Alert phase, rapid identification of [25] , due to the risk that LPAI H5 virus gains a high pathogenicity by mutation in poultry hosts. Ito et al. reported [26] that LPAI H5 virus (A/whistling swan/Shimane/499/83 (H5N3)) became highly pathogenic in chickens after 24 consecutive passages by air sac inoculation. The result indicated that LPAI H5 viruses have a potential of becoming HPAI viruses and public health threat. Thus, not only HPAI H5N1 viruses but also LPAI H5 viruses as well should be surveyed in poultry. In the above basis, our FLIC Type-N kit can become a powerful tool for rapid surveillance of LPAI H5 viruses. We have previously reported another method for rapid diagnosis, super high-speed quantitative PCR (SHRT-PCR) [27] , which is a recently developed version of qRT-PCR that is characterized by extremely short reaction times (less than 20 min per run for 40 cycles). Compared with SHRT-PCR, FLIC has a strong advantage in usability, because the work required for FLIC is only mix-and-drop without any additional steps such as RNA extraction. Thus, FLIC is more suitable not only for diagnosis in small clinics and hospitals, but also for rapid detection of HPAIV from infected-candidates in Asian countries.",

FLIC can play a critical role in diagnosing infected patients and poutry at Alert stage, because this method is more sensitive than the standard ICs as well as rapid and easy-to-use. FLIC can also be applied to detect other rapidly spreading pathogens, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus[21,22] for regulating the spread of such viruses.Our combination of antibodies against H5 HA detected many kinds of HA proteins.Type-E could detect all influenza viruses and rHAs belonging to the Eurasian type of both GS/GD/1-lineage and outlier. Because avian influenza viruses of Eurasian type play an important role in the human infection by avian influenza viruses, the Type-E would be useful for clinical diagnosis and surveillance in Asian countries. The antisera against clade 2.3.2 viruses very weakly interact with clade 2.3.4 viruses, but that against clade 2.3.4 viruses could not detect clade 2.3.2 virus [23]. However, our Type-E kit could detect both clade 2.3.2 and clade 2.3.4 viruses, meaning the kit identifies the general epitope of Eurasian type H5 viruses. Recently, 4 HPAI H5N2 viruses were reported in China [24]. Two of these HPAI H5N2 viruses contained the HA gene belonging to clade 2.3.4. The other 2 isolates included the HA gene of clade 7. Thus, we are interested in the reactivity of Type-E to clade 7 HA. Because Type-E detected a clade 4 rHA (A/goose/Guiyang/337/2006), which is genetically close to clade 7 HA, there is a high possibility of clade 7 HA recognition by Type-E. Type-N could detect all low pathogenic avian influenza H5 virus (LPAI H5 virus) and rHAs which we tested. All LPAI H5 viruses in poultry are notifiable to Office International des Epizooties (World Organisation for Animal Health; OIE)",
