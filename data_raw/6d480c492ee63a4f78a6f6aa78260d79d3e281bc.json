The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that ZIKV and associated consequences especially the neurological autoimmune disorder Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly will remain a significant enduring public health challenge requiring intense action. We apply a standardization of the multi-subcutaneous dorsal inoculation method to systematically summarize clinical neurological manifestation, viral distribution, and tissue damage during the progress of viremia and systemic spread in suckling mouse models. We found that C57BL/6 and Kunming mice (KM) both showed remarkable and uniform neurologic manifestations. C57BL/6 owned the highest susceptibility and pathogenicity to the nervous system, referred to as movement disorders, with 100% incidence, while KM was an economic model for a Chinese study characterized by lower limb weakness with 62% morbidity. Slight yellow extraocular exudates were observed in BALB/c, suggesting the association with similar ocular findings to those of clinical cases. The virus distribution and pathological changes in the sera, brains, livers, kidneys, spleens, and testes during disease progression had strong regularity and uniformity, demonstrating the effectiveness and plasticity of the animal models. The successful establishment of these animal models will be conducive to expound the pathogenic mechanism of GBS.",

            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family, which contains many viruses that cause human diseases, such as dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile encephalitis [1] . After ZIKV was first isolated in Uganda in 1947 [2] , ZIKV infection was regarded believe that choosing suckling immunocompetent mice as a potential ZIKV infection animal model has infinite potential. Instead, interferon (IFN) deficient models do have their superiority with more severe clinical manifestations. However, the profound immunological defects in these strains do confuse us with question regarding how much of a difference in IFN response will make in the natural pathogenic mechanism of ZIKV. Considering that pathogenicity of Flavivirus may be decided not just by the effect of the virus but by the immune response it triggers [46] , and an immunocompetent mouse model is urgently needed in order to discover the pathogenesis of ZIKV. Thus, we developed an inventive and normative infective method of ZIKV, i.e., multi-subcutaneous infection. After injecting ZIKV multi-subcutaneously into the backs of suckling mice, we observed signs and symptoms, organ distributions, and pathological changes to determine the application of suckling mouse models to ZIKV infection research. These suckling mouse models represent an important step toward understanding severe neurological outcomes and may be useful for drug screening, vaccine tests, and general ZIKV research. Additionally, by avoiding confounding factors, like transplacental infection and consequent placental insufficiency in brain development, such a neonatal mouse model will contribute to enhancing the understandings about the clinical outcomes of those who are infected in late pregnancy or early childhood.",

Five inoculation positions were established, including the back of the neck, the centre of the back, the front of the tail, and the waist on both sides, and 4 \u00b5L was injected into each site. Post-inoculation, all mice were monitored at least once daily for symptoms and signs of illness (lower limb weakness, upper limb weakness, slow movements, tremble, hunched posture, toe-walking, and neurological manifestations, such as tremors, abnormal gait, paralysis, and circle). Weights were also recorded daily. Organs of mice that were killed to determine viral loads were washed with PBS and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C, and organs of mice that were killed for histopathological examinations were fixed for 16-24 h in 10% paraformaldehyde and stored at 4 \u2022 C.

After incubation (8-10 days), onset (4-6 days) was characterized by slow movement, lower limb weakness, hunched posture, trembling, etc. (Figures 1A and 2B ). Lower limb weakness was the only common symptom shared by all sick KM (Movie S1); in these cases, the lower limb was unable to support the body to maintain balance and mice were unable to walk straight. This phenotype was used as an index of onset ( Figure 2E ) and had a total incidence of 62% (Figure 2A ). By day 9 or 10, BALB/c suddenly showed upper or lower limb weakness, hunched posture, ruffled fur, toe-walking, etc. ( Figure 2C ) and, after a two-day struggle, rapidly recovered, implying a very short onset time ( Figure 1A ). The symptoms were irregular, and hunched posture and toe-walking had particularly high frequencies, 83.3% and 66.7%, respectively ( Figure 2F ) (Movie S2). The incidence in BALB/c was 36% (Figure 2A ). Interestingly, a slight yellow extraocular exudate was detected in remaining mice by day 13 or 14, and continued for 3-5 days in 55.6% of cases ( Figure 2C ). The control animals grew normally throughout the trial. Lower limb weakness was the only common symptom shared by all sick KM (Movie S1); in these cases, the lower limb was unable to support the body to maintain balance and mice were unable to walk straight.

Generally, C57BL/6 began to sicken from days 8 to 11, with hunched posture and normal movement, but were unable to hold a balanced position at rest, often swayed, and finally fell. These phenotypes were referred to as movement disorders (MD) (Movie S3 and S4) and led to the highest morbidity, 100% (Figure 2A ,D). After 3-5 days, all mice entered the exacerbation stage; they maintained a seriously hunched posture, tiptoe standing position, jumped while walking, easily fell, and were difficult to turn over. We referred to these phenotypes as serious movement disorders (SMD) ( Figure 2D ,G, Movie S5). The symptoms of most of the mice (37/45) visibly worsened; mice lost movement abilities, struggled to stand, consistently fell, and finally maintained a side-lying position. They commonly died within 24 h and were described as \"endangered mice.\" Remaining eight mice who were able to stand during exacerbation finally tended to recover, with a single symptom remaining, i.e., a hunched posture.",

ZIKV-infected patients not only exhibit common symptoms, but also show occasional neurological manifestations, including GBS and, in particular, microcephaly in infants [49] . Dirlikov et al. [50] analysed 32 cases and summarized the GBS phenotypes associated with ZIKV, such as hyporeflexia or areflexia, leg weakness or paresthesia, arm weakness or paresthesia, and dysphagia. Similar to our results, during onset, C57BL/6 mice were unable to maintain balance, often swayed, and fell, indicating a connection with upper or lower limb weakness. Endangered mice were unresponsive, and this might be related to hyporeflexia or areflexia. In comparison, Manangeeswaran et al. injected suckling C57BL/6 with 2 \u00d7 10 3 PFU ZIKV at day 1 of age, their results had interesting differences with ours. With similar neurological manifestations like unsteady gait, loss of balance and ataxia, their C57BL/6 develop their symptoms around 13 days post infection, and recover two weeks later [35] . Instead, our C57BL/6 have especial exacerbation period after their common onset, which may be due to complex influencing factors. Owing to a lack of diagnostic criteria for GBS in mice, further studies of the relationship between this neurological manifestation and GBS are needed. Moreover, the morbidity reached 100%, supporting the feasibility of C57BL/6 as an animal model for ZIKV infection. Although the morbidity of KM was 61.1%, all invalid mice presented neurological symptoms, such as lower limb weakness. The morbidity of BALB/c mice was only 39.4%, with non-uniform signs and symptoms, but a slight yellow extraocular exudate was detected in some of the remaining unaffected individuals, suggesting the presence of ocular changes. Interestingly, non-purulent conjunctivitis is one of the clinical features [49] of ZIKV infection. Ventura et al. [51] analysed three cases of maculopathy along with microcephaly in children with suspected congenital Zika infection, and de Paula et al. [52] and Miranda et al. [53] reported ocular findings in infants with microcephaly associated with presumed ZIKV congenital infection. Miner et al. [25] found that ZIKV infection in mice causes pan-uveitis with shedding of the virus in tears. Unfortunately, the lack of ocular symptom diagnosis, the difficulty in acquiring excretion and tear samples in suckling mice, and incomplete periocular tissue sections limited our ability to systematically explain the ocular findings in BALB/c mice, and the mechanism should be examined in future studies.",

Clinical cases involving foetuses and infants exhibit cerebellar hypoplasia, microglial nodules, and neuronal and glial cell degeneration and necrosis [54] , similar to our observations in mice. For example, eosinophilic necrosis of several neurons in the cerebrum and cerebellum was found, and the molecular layer of the cerebrum showed apparent glial cell nodules. Such necrosis and nodules suggest viral replication based on previous findings that ZIKV replicates in both neurons and astroglial cells [55] , but this should be confirmed in future studies. Additionally, the cerebellum of C57BL/6 mice had more serious necrosis than the cerebrum. The cerebellum maintains balance, modulates muscle tone, and coordinates voluntary movements, potentially explaining the obvious imbalance and lack of coordination in C57BL/6 mice. Additionally, Purkinje cells as ghost cells were detected in both C57BL/6 and KM mice, but not in BALB/c mice. Purkinje cells are the only neurons that provide outflow and play important roles in motion coordination; they are probably involved in the dyskinesia in C57BL/6 and KM mice. Moreover, lymphocytic infiltration in KM suggested an inflammatory response, similar to the pathological changes reported in clinical cases [54] .

Unlike partial hyperaemia and oedema during recovery in KM and BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice maintained normal structures at all time points. However, it is not clear whether high viral loads in the kidneys of KM and C57BL/6 mice suggested that mouse kidneys could persistently carry high concentrations of the virus as a 'container,' influencing its own structure. Gourinat et al. [58] found that, compared to serum, the virus could be detected in urine for a longer period of up 10 days and even more than 20 days. In general, through glomerular filtration, tubular resorption, and secretion, urine is derived from blood. Therefore, virus-free serum should correspond to urine without virus. However, after the virus was cleared from the serum, the urine of patients still contained detectable virus, which suggests that ZIKV replication also occurs in human kidneys. Due to the small quantity of urine available from suckling mice, we were not able to determine virus loads in the urine in the present study. However, there is another possibility that biological components in serum which will affect virus replication, different from urine. Additionally, following the kidney, urine will pass the ureters, bladder, and urethra, so we cannot credit the kidney with this discovery. In our study, we did not lucubrate about virus clearance mechanism in serum and urine formation mechanism, so the role that the kidneys play in ZIKV infection still needs further exploration.",

[26] treated C57BL/6 mice with a single dose of an anti-IFNAR1-blocking monoclonal antibody, and observed a high viral load and serious pathological changes in the testes. These findings are consistent with those of Lazear et al. [15] , who discovered that the testes of Ifnar1-/mice have high viral loads after ZIKV infection. However, it is not clear whether type I IFN is an important regulatory mechanism when ZIKV passes the blood-testis barrier.",

            "text": "Just like DENV, ZIKV may be restricted in its natural vertebrate host range, generally including primates as its amplification and reservoir hosts [61] . Dudley et al. [24] recently established a rhesus macaque model of Asian-lineage ZIKV infection, which exhibited long-term viremia lasting at least 21 days. Even after apparent clearance of the virus from the blood, viral RNA was detected in the urine and saliva for a certain period, and the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma was suddenly detected after initial clearance. These results indicate that ZIKV could persist for longer durations in certain tissues at low levels, suggesting its storage in certain parts of the body. Our results indicated that viremia in C57BL/6 mice persists for 14 days, and after apparent clearance of the virus in the serum, ZIKV could persist for longer durations in the brain and spleen, indicating that there might be a 'container' for ZIKV. By contrast, viremia in KM and BALB/c mice only continued for seven days. Musso et al. [62] analysed samples obtained from 182 patients, and found that viremia persisted for five days; this was shorter than the duration observed in KM and BALB/c mice.",

            "text": "In general, major goals for the establishment of animal models are high similarity, feasibility, repeatability, and cost-effectiveness. ZIKV-infected C57BL/6 suckling mice without gene defects or immunosuppression exhibited phenotypes that were most similar to the natural infection status. The highest morbidity (100%), distinctive and easily observable neurological symptoms, regular viral loads in organs, and pathological changes suggested the feasibility and practicality of this animal model. Most of all, with incubation, onset, exacerbation and recovery, our C57BL/6 provide more administration phases and relevant assessment standards for potential therapeutics testing. Additionally, as inbred mice, which benefit from genetic homogeneity and low variation among individuals, C57BL/6 could withstand repeated experiments, and easy to breed at low costs and could be widely applied for drug screening and vaccine tests. By contrast, in spite of lower morbidity, the onset of KM mice exhibited uniform neurological manifestations. With widespread applications in life science research in China, and a long enough prodromal phase for medication around 8-10 days, KM will be an acceptable animal model for Chinese scholars. Despite the low morbidity and non-uniform clinical features, BALB/c mice have unique ocular symptoms which are similar to clinical cases. As a potential useful ZIKV-associated ocular manifestation animal models, BALB/c offers the option of testing conditions that may lead to clinical ocular findings. Despite the application mentioned above, we should also be very cognizant of the limitation that discoveries in such a ZIKV-infected suckling mice model may not be extrapolate to the physiological complications largely found in adults, driving us to conduct further research.",
