Understanding the prevalence of diseases, in relation to age and breed, would support appropriate guidance for future health care strategies and provide useful information for the early diagnosis of diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the major medical causes for dogs visiting primary-care veterinary clinics in the Republic of Korea, stratified by age and breed. Methods: A total of 15,531 medical records of canine patients were analyzed from 11 veterinary clinics who shared data from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. An electronic medical record (EMR) system was used for data collection, which included the animal identification number, age, breed, gender, neuter status, clinical information, and diagnosis. EMR data were classified using the International Classification of Disease system from the World Health Organization; presenting signs or diagnoses were identified according to breed and life stage. Results: Within the age groups, preventive medicine (16.7% confidence intervals (CI) [15.9-17.5]) was the most common cause for clinic visits for the <1 year and 1-3 year groups. Additionally, neutering surgery (6.6% CI [6.0-7.1]) and patella luxation (1.4% CI [1.8-2.7]) were frequently performed in these age groups. In the 4-6 year group, otitis externa (8.8% CI [7.8-10.0]) and dermatitis or eczema (8.5% CI [7.5-9.6]) were common medical problems. In older dogs (>10 year), the prevalences of heart disease, kidney disease, Cushing's disease, and mammary tumors were higher than in the other age groups. Small and toy breed dogs comprised 67.7% of all dogs in this analysis. For all breeds, otitis externa, dermatitis or eczema, vomiting, and diarrhea were common medical problems. Discussion: This study identified the most common medical disorders and differences in prevalences of diseases, according to age and breeds. The information from EMRs for dogs visiting primary-care veterinary clinics can provide background knowledge that is required to enable a better understanding of disease patterns and occurrence by age and breeds.

Owners who consider companion animals to be family members, expect their dogs to have good health. Changes in living environments, improvements in nutrition, and the development of veterinary medical technology, including the prevention of infectious diseases, as well as better diagnostic approaches and disease management, have resulted in a gradual increase of the average lifespan of the companion dog (Butterwick, 2015; Guglielmini, 2003; Sabnis & Rathbone, 2013) .

In recent years, various investigators have used demographic information of companion dogs to assess health issues and disease prevalences within particular populations. In addition, mortality and morbidity in a variety of countries have been reported, stratified by age and breed (Bonnett & Egenvall, 2010; Egenvall et al., 2005; Fleming, Creevy & Promislow, 2011; Proschowsky, Rugbjerg & Ersb\u00f8ll, 2003) . Large dog breeds have been noted to exhibit a shorter expected lifespan than small dog breeds (Fleming, Creevy & Promislow, 2011; Michell, 1999; Proschowsky, Rugbjerg & Ersb\u00f8ll, 2003) ; further, mixed breed dogs have a higher average lifespan than purebred dogs, except for Poodles and Border Collies (O'Neill et al., 2013; Proschowsky, Rugbjerg & Ersb\u00f8ll, 2003) . A previous report found that male dogs tended to have higher mortality rates due to trauma, whereas female dogs showed higher rates of neoplasms . Some breeds, such as Golden Retrievers and Boxers, die of cancer more frequently than other breeds (Fleming, Creevy & Promislow, 2011) . These reports show that breed and age are major risk factors for mortality in dogs.",

Moreover, some types of diseases, such as heart disease, often show no signs, even when the disease has progressed and the patient has been significantly affected (Atkins et al., 2009) .

We included no specialists, referral clinics, or teaching hospitals in this study. Before collecting data for this survey, data use agreements were signed by veterinary practitioners from each clinic when they agreed to provide their medical records. The data included clinical information, such as presenting signs or diagnoses of major health problems, reasons for the visit, and related clinical procedures. All clinical data were recorded by the veterinarians at their practices. A proprietary electronic medical record system (EMR; Into Vet., Inc, Into CNS, Seoul, ROK) was used for data collection; it included the animal identification number, age, breed, gender, neuter status, clinical information (clinical signs, client complaints, lab procedures), and diagnosis. The data collection procedure was performed in cooperation with the EMR software company.

The classification includes two general categories of International Classification of Disease (ICD) for human disease. Clinical notes and diagnosis terms included in the data were reviewed in detail by a veterinary researcher with clinical experience and were reworked as a list of terms using the most appropriate the standard nomenclature of veterinary disease and operations. The most definitive diagnostic term recorded for each disorder within an individual patient's record was manually classified using the ICD from the World Health Organization (ICD-10 version, WHO). For example, otitis externa was classified as \"Diseases of the ear or mastoid process,\" and heartworm was classified as \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases.\" Consequences involving external causes, such as trauma including injury, accident involving fracture, and wound including lacerations, tear and bit wounds that involved by soft tissues were classified within \"Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes.\" Some of the terms combined nomenclature which is broad informed terms were used in this study. For example, the term \"diarrhea\" included watery diarrhea, mucosae diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, and melena. The term \"vomiting\" included vomiting, regurgitation, and hematemesis. Most records were as classified in a main category of ICD and were not grouped into sub-categories. Dental problems, such as gingivitis and periodontal disease, were grouped within \"Dental disorder.\" Vaccinations for infectious diseases and heartworm prevention were grouped within \"Preventive medicine,\" because of this category's importance in veterinary practice. Additionally, male castration and female ovariohysterectomy were grouped within \"Neutering surgery\" when there was no underlying disease. Causes of death or euthanasia were not recorded.",

These data, including the percentages of other causes, are presented in Fig. 4 . For 1-to-3-year-old dogs, preventive medicine 16.7% (95% CI [15.9-17.5]) was most common cause for visiting the clinics. Neutering surgery 6.6% (95% CI [6.0-7.1]) was one of the most frequently performed procedures. For 4-to-6-year-old dogs, otitis externa 8.8% (95% CI [7.8-10.0]) was the most common medical problem, followed by dermatitis or eczema 8.5% (95% CI [7.5-9.6]) and preventive medicine 7.7% (95% CI [6.7-9.6]). Additionally, gingivitis 2% (95% CI [1.5-2.6]) was observed in the rank table for this age group. For dogs >7 years old, the most common medical problem was dermatitis or eczema, followed by otitis externa. In older dogs (10 years old), some diseases, such as heart disease, kidney disease, Cushing's disease, and mammary tumors occurred more often than in other age groups. Table 2 shows the prevalence of common medical problems according to individual breeds. Briefly, for Malteses, the major reasons for visiting the clinics were preventive medicine 10.3% (95% CI [9.3-15.9]), otitis externa 8.8% (95% CI [7.9-9.7]), and dermatitis or eczema 6.9% (CI [6.1-7.7]). For Poodles, preventive medicine 14.5% (95% CI [13.0-15.9]) was most common reason for visiting vet clinic and the most common medical problem was otitis externa 8.3% (95% CI [7.2-9.4]), followed by diarrhea 6.5% (95% CI [5.5-7.5]) and vomiting 6.2% (95% CI [5.2-7.2]). Pomeranians had similar disorders which was compared with Poodles, while they showed a prevalence of upper respiratory tract disease 4.5% (95% CI [3.5-5.8]) that was higher than in other breeds. For Shih Tzus, the most cause for visiting vet clinic was dermatitis or eczema 9.3% (95% CI [7.7-11.1]), followed by otitis externa 8.2% (95% CI [6.7-9.9]) and preventive medicine 6.0% (95% CI [4.7-7.5]). In addition, diseases of the visual system, such as conjunctivitis, obit disorders, and keratitis, occurred more commonly in Shih Tzus than in other breeds. For mixed breeds, trauma (including injuries, poisoning, or other related prevalence than in other breeds. For Yorkshire Terriers, gingivitis 2.8% (95% CI [1.9-4.1]) and seizures 1.7% (95% CI [1.0-2.6]) were much more common than in other breeds. For all breeds, otitis externa, dermatitis or eczema, vomiting, diarrhea, lameness, Malassezia infection, and dermatomycoses were common medical problems. Table 3 shows the p values derived from Pearson's chi-squared test for signs or diagnoses, according to the age groups and individual breeds. For the age groups, the majority of the top 20 presenting signs or diagnoses showed statistically significant differences among the groups, except for conjunctivitis, dermatomycoses, skin pruritus, foreign body ingestion, lameness, and Malassezia infection. For breeds, the majority of the top 20 presenting signs or diagnoses also showed statistically significant differences among the breeds, except for dermatomycoses, ear pruritus, health services, loss of appetite, and pyoderma.

For these types of surveys, a variety of data sources can be used to examine disease prevalence patterns. Veterinary teaching hospitals, referral practices with specialists, primary-care veterinary clinics, insured animal data, Kennel club registrations, questionnaires, and internet-based surveys are commonly used to conduct demographic or health condition research in companion animals (Bonnett & Egenvall, 2010; Diez et al., 2015; Dorn, 2000; Egenvall et al., 2005; Gobar, Case & Kass, 1998; Kubinyi, Turcs\u00e1n & Mikl\u00f3si, 2009; O'Neill et al., 2014; Zur, Lifshitz & Bdolah-Abram, 2011) . Veterinary EMR data have been proposed as a statistically valuable source of information for clinical research in dogs (O'Neill et al., 2014 (O'Neill et al., , 2015 S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno et al., 2015) . EMR data have a number of benefits: they are not difficult to acquire, they provide a wide range of comprehensive information, and they allow a wide range of multi-dimensional analyses. Currently, most veterinary clinics in ROK use EMRs for their practice management. The system is convenient for storing and sorting patient information, and it is easy to search desired categorical information.",

In a previous study, most dogs that visited vets were the <1-year-old or 4-to-7-year-old groups in the USA (Lund et al., 1999); a demographic study in the UK showed that 0-to-1-year-old dogs were the highest proportion, with clinic visits slightly decreasing with increasing age (S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno et al., 2017). These results are different than our study in that the <1-year-old population was a lower proportion of our total. The average age was 4.8 years and the oldest age was 20 years in this study. Most researchers have insisted that the average age of pet dogs has been increasing, and that their expected lifespan is longer ; O' Neill et al., 2013) . This study shows that the proportion of >10-years-old dogs was higher than the proportion of <1-year-old dogs. These older dogs will be an important part of veterinary medicine; with their different prevalences of diseases compared with younger dogs, owners and veterinarians will need health care plans that take properly consider the age status of the dogs.

In addition, disease prevalences were affected by breed (Dorn, 2000; Harvey, 1998; Lund et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2016) .

The most cause for visiting veterinary clinic was for preventive medicine and the most commonly presented sign was dermatitis or eczema, followed by otitis externa, diarrhea, and vomiting. Previous reports have shown the most common reasons for visiting vet clinics were: skin lump, pruritus, vomiting, loss of appetite, lameness, and diarrhea (Robinson et al., 2015) ; otitis externa, periodontal disease, and anal sac impaction (O'Neill et al., 2015) ; and dental calculus, gingivitis, and otitis externa (Lund et al., 1999) . Compared with previous study, the causes of visiting veterinary clinics were similar, but there were some differences in their rank levels in their calculations. Notably, dental diseases, such as gingivitis, were significantly lower in our study. The most affected organ systems were the integument, digestive, and musculoskeletal systems in the study by O'Neill et al. in the UK (2015) , whereas digestive disease was most common, followed by dermatological disorders and cardiovascular disease in a study in Italy (Martini et al., 2016) . In our study, skin diseases were most common, followed by digestive diseases, preventive medicine, ear diseases, and diseases of the visual and musculoskeletal systems. Even though the ratios were different in each study, the main causes (skin, digestive, and ear problems) were similar; although in the Italian study, cardiovascular diseases were much lower than in our study.",

            "text": "Previous reports suggest that the prevalence of disease is affected by age, as well as by breed (Bonnett & Egenvall, 2010; Egenvall et al., 2005) . We analyzed the frequency and distribution of medical problems by life stage (<1 year of age and every three years, from one to 16 years). Young dogs, for example, are more easily exposed to infectious diseases, such as parvovirus or coronavirus, and intestinal parasites, even though the proportion of preventive medicine is higher, and the prevalence of trauma such as falls, accidents, and factures is also higher than in older age groups. The prevalence of progressive diseases, such as neoplasm, heart diseases, and arthritis is related to age group as well (Bonnett & Egenvall, 2010; Egenvall et al., 2005) . This study shows that some kinds of progressive or degenerative diseases had a higher prevalence in older groups than in younger groups, including circulation disorders (e.g., heart disease), neoplasms (e.g., mammary tumors), musculoskeletal disorders (e.g., lameness), and hormonal disorders (e.g., Cushing's disease). The prevalence of heart diseases increases with age in small breed dogs, and dogs older than eight years have a reduced survival time, compared to younger dogs (Guglielmini, 2003; Templeton et al., 1976) . A previous study showed the mean age for dogs with heart disease was 10.6 \u00b1 2.62 years. This study revealed a similar result, in which the prevalence of heart disease was significantly different, according to age (p < 0.05). Additionally, heart disease is a high-risk factor in terms of mortality in dogs (Bonnett & Egenvall, 2010; Egenvall et al., 2005; Hoummady et al., 2016) . Age-related changes of cardiovascular function in dog affect the prevalences of not only hypotension, blood velocity, arterial compliance, and dispensability (Haidet et al., 1996; Miller, Nealeigh & Crowder, 1976) , but also increased ventricular systolic and diastolic stiffness associated with prolonged duration of myocardial contractility (Templeton et al., 1976) . In dogs, heart disease has been related to serious conditions, including progressive heart failure, pulmonary edema and/or congestion, hypertension, left arterial rupture, and pericardial tamponade (Borgarelli et al., 2008; Guglielmini, 2003; Pouchelon et al., 2015) . These reasons might reflect the result that increasing the prevalence of respiratory disorder in presented study. Some types of canine patients with class I heart disease have no clinical signs that are evident, even during exercise. However, this disease status can change frequently and dramatically over short periods of time (Guglielmini, 2003) . In older dogs, especially those >10 years, regular heart exams that may include heart rate, auscultation, radiography, and echocardiogram, are recommended.",

Increasing age is the most significant risk factor for the development of mammary gland tumors in dogs, with a mean age at diagnosis of approximately 8.4-10 years (Chang et al., 2005; Kustritz, 2007) . We also observed increased rates of mammary tumors in the >10 years old age groups. Sexually intact status is a major risk factor for the development of mammary gland tumors; sexually intact dogs have a seven-fold increased risk for developing mammary gland tumors with increasing age, compared with the risk for spayed dogs (Misdorp, 1988; Kustritz, 2007) . Hence, as age increases, unneutered female dogs should have regular health checkups, especially with regard to mammary gland tumors.",

Regular preventive medicines would help decrease mortality and morbidity, especially for some kinds of infectious disease, including parasitic diseases like heartworm and tick-borne diseases; it has benefit for prevention of human-animal interacted diseases.",

Although previous reports have demonstrated various breed distributions of medical conditions, our results clearly differ from those regarding distributions of dog breeds in other countries. The main breeds in ROK are small dogs and toy dogs. Common causes for visiting the veterinary clinic were similar across these breeds: preventive medicine, otitis externa, dermatitis or eczema, and diarrhea and vomiting. These medical problems, manifested as brown ears (externa otitis), itching on skin, or diarrhea and vomiting, are simple for owners to recognize, which is reflected in our results. However, some of these health problems are not obvious to the owner and can only be detected with by veterinary diagnosis. Notably, purebred dogs of many breeds and some mixed breed dogs are prone to congenital or heritable diseases (Asher et al., 2009; Dorn, 2000) . In pedigree dogs, hip dysplasia, patella luxation, entropion, retinal atrophy, elongated soft palate, skin fold dermatitis, uterine inertia, elbow dysplasia, lens luxation, ectropion, and trichiasis have been commonly identified (Asher et al., 2009; Hodgman, 1963) . As dogs aged, skin diseases, including dermatitis or eczema, malassezia infection in skin, dermatomycoses, skin pruritus, and pyoderma show high prevalence across breeds. We did not know which problems were heritable diseases; however, a previous report noted that some purebred dogs could be affected by various endogenous risk factors, such as hyperadrenocorticism in Poodle, hypothyroidism in Doberman Pinscher, and zincresponsive skin diseases in Cocker Spaniel and Alaskan malamute (Miller et al., 2013; Scott & Paradis, 1990) .",

These surgeries are commonly recommended as prevention for genital disorders, such as pyometra, mammary tumors, testicular tumors, and prostatic neoplasia and behavioral problems, such as mounting and urine spraying (Kustritz, 2007) . However, in house dogs, overweight or obese statuses were highly prevalent among neutered dogs; the most commonly reported risk factor for obesity was gonadectomy (Asher et al., 2009) . Even though we did not analyze body weight, it is an important factor contributing to life quality and longevity in companion dogs (Fleming, Creevy & Promislow, 2011; O'Neill et al., 2013) . A limitation of this study is that it is not a comprehensive, representative survey of the entire ROK. It is considered to be relevant for indoor dogs living in big cities, because it is aimed at primary veterinary clinics in Seoul, the largest city in ROK, and Jeonju, a smaller city. Therefore, it is not likely to be applicable to rural areas. Furthermore, if signs alone were considered when observing or consulting cases in veterinary clinics, some of the most frequently encountered breedspecific and congenital problems, and a variety of diseases that result from conformation character, malformation, and/or endocrine disorders would be missed because owners might not recognize them or regard them as important. Understanding why these types of problems tend to occur at higher rates than in other breeds may help in deciding when they should be prioritized; for owners, regular visits to the veterinarian for health screening can help identify these undetected problems and allow better treatment and management of some problems in earlier stages.",

Because most of the dog breeds in ROK are small and toy breeds, which are expected to have a long lifespan, we need to design appropriate approaches for them. The information in this study could provide information to educate owners, improve strategies for disease prevention, and enable management of problems earlier and more effectively. Ideally, it would be helpful to establish guidelines for primary health care at the national level. Additionally, various dimensions of analysis are required to determine the trends for factors affecting disease patterns. To our knowledge, no other study has performed this type of analysis using comparable methods to collect EMR data from a large sample of dogs in the ROK. This is the first study that describes disease patterns and occurrences according to age. There is a need for further studies to provide a more comprehensive analysis according to age groups within breeds.",
