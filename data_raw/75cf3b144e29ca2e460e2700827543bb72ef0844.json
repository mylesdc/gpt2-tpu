Novel avian influenza A (H7N9), a newly emerging infectious disease with a high fatality rate in humans [1] , has been initially reported in China in March 2013, followed by its wide spread in the eastern provinces of China and the first recorded death in 3 March 2013 [2] . Sequence analyses found that H7N9 viruses were of avian origin, but could adapt to mammalian species [3, 4] . This virus normally causes severe respiratory illness in humans, but demonstrates an asymptomatic infection in poultry [5] . Until now, a majority of human cases have been found in China, although sporadic imported cases have been detected in adjacent areas. As the human mortality rate due to H7N9 virus infection is approximately 36% and the virus can occasionally transmit from person to person [6, 7] , H7N9 poses a potential epidemic threat for China and a pandemic threat for the rest of the world [8] .",

However, it is necessary to analyze H7N9 cases data covering all seasons of a whole year, especially for this newly emerging infectious disease for which the spread mechanisms are still unclear, to improve our understanding of the risks of H7N9. Furthermore, disease control polices, such as suspending normal business operations, regular disinfection and the closure of live poultry markets [11] [12] [13] [14] , may have affected the spread of the disease and changed its clustering. Therefore, reanalysis using data for the entire period from February 2013 to March 2014 is warranted.",

A cylinder was used to define a potential spatial-temporal cluster, which centered at the county with different spatial radius used to search clusters in spatial and a time period of 1-28 days as the height of the cylinder for temporal cluster. The percentage of cases observed within a cylinder was compared to what would have been expected if the cases were randomly distributed in space and time. The statistical significance of each cluster was calculated based on generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) and Monte Carlo hypothesis testing [17] . In this paper, the simulation was set to 999 times. The p-value of 0.05 means that the GLR in this cylinder is higher than 5% of the GLR calculated during those 999 simulations. The maximum cluster size was set to 10% of the population at risk.",

Our map shows that most human cases occurred in and surrounding the Yangtze River delta region covering Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, and in Guangdong province in the Pearl River delta, while sporadic cases were distributed in other provinces. Other studies have illustrated the same cluster pattern, suggesting that the Yangtze River delta could be central to the onset of previous outbreaks [19, 20] . Some possible explanations for this include the fact that the Yangtze River and the Pearl River deltas are populated by migrant birds that provide a natural advantage for the influenza A to undergo mutation and reassortment [3] . Previous studies have also shown a positive correlation between human rates of H7N9 infection and the regional density of poultry markets [20] [21] [22] . While the Yangtze River delta in particular containing large amounts of ducks earmarked for meat and/or egg production [23] , it might be one of the reasons that most cases clustered there. Finally, due to a comprehensive surveillance system and generally good medical care in these areas, we cannot ignore the possibility that the increased incidence of H7N9 human infection in these regions is simply a function of better detection rates. However, there are other cities in China, such as Beijing and Hong Kong, being similar to Shanghai in this aspect, but only few cases were detected in these two areas, so this hypothesis is unlikely to be true.",

A similar cluster is identified if the H7N9 case dataset was analyzed for space-time clustering using SatScan (see SatScan result; Figure 5 ). It is interesting to note that most cases in 2014 do not cluster when time is taken into account. One explanation for this is that the central government intervention to manage H7N9 encouraged local officials and government agencies to shut down poultry markets where H7N9 cases were reported in nearby areas [25, 26] . For example, during the outbreak in April 2013, government intervention resulted in the shutting down of 780 live poultry markets [27] . Though sporadic H7N9 cases still occurred after May 2013 with a large resurgence in 2014, space-time clustering is less significant (p = 0.05) ( Figure 5 ) and spans over smaller area and shorter period than clustering in 2013. This suggests that shutting down poultry markets can be an effective intervention in halting the spread of H7N9.",

The SatScan results also showed that there were six clusters during the whole period. The primary cluster occurred during 13 March 2013 to 9 April 2013, while three secondary clusters occurred during the period of 19 February to 5 March 2013, 3 April to 16 April 2013 and 17 April to 7 May 2013. The remaining two secondary clusters were detected in the year of 2014, from early February to late March (Figure 5). Most of the secondary clusters except those that occurred in Guangzhou and Shenzhen (Figure 2)were identified in counties with no more than three cases during the whole study period.Comparing the results of Space-Time scan and ArcGIS, though they are different in some details, good agreement was found in three overall features: (1) the strongest cluster occurred in March 2013 to April 2013 in Shanghai and Zhejiang province; (2) these two areas have no other significant cluster since then during the entire study period; (3) a relatively weak cluster occurs in February 2014 near Guangzhou and Shenzhen.",
