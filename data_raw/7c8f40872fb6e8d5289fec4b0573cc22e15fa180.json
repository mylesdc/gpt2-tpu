The Chinese government and military forces have paid a great deal of attention to infectious disease prevention and control, and using military-civilian cooperation, they have successfully prevented numerous severe epidemic situations, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza A (H1N1), avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9, and Ebola hemorrhagic fever, while actively maintained public health, economic development, and national construction. This paper focuses on the mechanisms of the military-cooperative emergency response to infectious diseases-the joint working mechanism, the information-sharing mechanism, the research collaboration mechanism, and the joint disposal mechanism-and presents a sorted summary of the practices and experiences of cooperative emergency responses to infectious diseases. In the future, the Chinese military and the civilian sector will further strengthen the cooperative joint command system and emergency rescue force and will reinforce their collaborative information-sharing platform and technical equipment system to further improve military-civilian collaborative emergency infectious diseases disposal, advance the level of infectious disease prevention and control, and maintain public health.",

The responses to H1N1 in 2009 and to avian influenza H7N9 in 2014 highlighted the importance of military-civilian joint prevention and control. Test reagents were co-developed in record time; efficient medicine and a specific vaccine for H1N1 were developed and prepared, effectively preventing the prevalence of H1N1 in China. A Peramivir and sodium chloride injection was successfully developed and prepared, which played an important role in treating severe H7N9 cases.

Chinese president Jin-ping Xi, who is also the general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the chairman of the Central Military Commission, has called for further integration of military and civilian undertakings that could cover multiple areas and generate high returns, and he has urged military and local authorities to advance their work while considering the overall development of the country. Civilian-military integration has made the synchronized development of economic and national defense capabilities possible. The PLA should play an active role in local economic and social development and contribute to wellbeing of the public through actual deeds, including the military-civilian cooperative emergency response to infectious disease prevention and control.",
