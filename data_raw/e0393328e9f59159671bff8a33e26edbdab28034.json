Both are essential for the success of vaccine development. To explore new vaccination approach against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection, we have shown that Rv3615c, identified as ESX-1 substrate protein C of M.tb but not expressed in BCG, induced a dominant Th1-type response of CD4 + T cells from patients with tuberculosis pleurisy, which suggests a potential candidate for vaccine development. But subcutaneous immunization with Rv3615c induced modest T-cell responses systemically, and showed suboptimal protection against virulent M.tb challenge at the site of infection. Here, we use a mouse model to demonstrate that intranasal immunization with Rv3615c induces sustained capability of adaptive CD4 + T-and B-cell responses in lung parenchyma and airway.

These effector cytokines eliminated the infected cells and controlled M.tb replication. 9, 10 Thus, many vaccine developments have been focused on identifying new CD4 + T-cell epitopes inducing Th1-type responses, or modifying BCG to improve efficacy for providing a broader protection. 11, 12 Among them, ESAT-6 and CFP-10, which induce dominant Th1-type CD4 + T-cell responses, have been evaluated and shown potentially protective effects. The ESAT-6, formatted as an ESAT-6-Ag85 fusion protein, promoted strong and long-lived M.tb-specific T-cell responses in na\u00efve human volunteers 13, 14 ; the CFP-10, previously used for disease diagnosis, could induce IFN-\u03b3 release and reduce IL-4 secretion of CD4 + T cells, as well as promote antibody response with an enhanced IgG2a/ IgG1 ratio in mice. 15 Although the evaluation is ongoing, establishment of adaptive Th1-type CD4 + T-cell response with effector or effectormemory phenotype is one of the targets for vaccine development to prevent TB.",

They can expand rapidly in response to cognate antigens to establish a barrier that limits the infection of target cells without the time-consuming procedure of recruiting effector cells from lymphoid tissues and the circulation. 22 Intranasal immunization induces not only systemic but also airway mucosal immune responses, while subcutaneous immunization preferably elicits responses in the serum and peripheral lymphoid tissues. 23 Intranasal immunization with BCG preferably induced TB-specific CD4 + T cells in the lung tissue, 7 and lung tissue CD4 + memory T cellsmediated adaptive immunity against Bordetella pertussis and Coronavirus infections efficiently. [24] [25] [26] The route of immunization has an impact on the location and differentiation of vaccination-primed cells, and intranasal immunization has being tested as a promising approach to induce mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract for prevention of M.tb, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and other pathogenic infections. 11, 13, [26] [27] [28] The escalating magnitude of T-cell response and IFN-\u03b3 production induced by BCG did not provide additional protection against M.tb infection. 18 In search for new TB vaccine candidates, we evaluated Rv3615c, a protein whose secretion is dependent on a component of RD1, for potency of inducing T-cell responses of patients with tuberculosis pleurisy. 9 Rv3615c has previously been identified as an ESX-1 substrate protein C (EspC) and has been known as a protein with similar amino acid length and homologous sequence as ESAT-6, CFP-10, and other members of the ESAT-6 family. 29, 30 The encoding region for Rv3615c is out of RD1 but its secretion is controlled by the ESAT-6 secretion system. 31 Although not expressed in BCG, Rv3615c is actively expressed and accessible to the antigen-presenting process during intracellular M.tb infections in vivo. 32, 33 In a mouse model, subcutaneous immunization with recombinant protein containing Rv3615c promoted Th1-type cytokine productions in the spleen, and both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were responsible for the elevated cytokine productions, and a portion of them coexpressed multiple cytokines. 34 In human cases, Rv3615c or its overlapping peptides elicited PBMCs isolated from patients with active TB or latent TB infection (LTBI) to produce IFN-\u03b3, with a portion of them coproducing IL-2. 35 Rv3615 has been shown to contain multiple epitopes of human T cells, many of them induce predominately CD4 + T-cell responses, with only a few of them inducing weak CD8 + T-cell responses. Although the protection induced by subcutaneous immunization with Rv3615c was modest to virulent M.tb challenge, these data suggest the potential of Rv3615c as a vaccine candidate for inducing adaptive immunity beyond those elicited by BCG. Following previous studies, here, we use mouse model to explore if immunization with Rv3615c intranasally promotes sustained memory CD4 + T-cell response in airway compartment locally, and to examine the profile of T-cell response by comparing with those induced by subcutaneous immunization. Our study can provide information for rational design and inoculation route of a TB vaccine.",

We examined mononuclear cells isolated from the spleen, lung, and mesenteric and inguinal LN tissues from the immunized mice for their cytokine production upon Rv3615c stimulation in vitro. Data showed that cells from mice immunized with Rv3615c+CpG produced higher level of cytokines than cells from those immunized with Rv3615c and controls ( Figure 2A ). Cytokine productions peaked at week 4, and maintained for at least 16 weeks, except for IL-4 production, which diminished earlier than IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and IL-17, and dropped to baseline of controls at week 8. We also observed that IL-17 production decreased significantly at week 12, while production of other Th1-type cytokines maintained relatively steady. Mononuclear cells isolated from the LN had relative low cytokine production and retained the production for a shorter period than did cells isolated from other tissues, particularly for IL-4 production. Data suggested that Rv3615c+CpG immunization established an adaptive immune response in our mouse model, and S.C. immunization induced a systemic immunity that was mostly predominated with Th1-type responses.

We identified that Rv3615c contained an epitope of mouse CD4 + T cells, which is located within amino acids 41- homing (CXCR3 + and CXCR5 + ), costimulation (PD-1 + , CTLA-4 + and CD40L + ) and activation (CD43 + and CD25 + ) phenotypes, and higher frequency of IFN-\u03b3 + and TNF-\u03b1 + single and multicytokine (such as IFN-\u03b3 + TNF-\u03b1 + , IFN-\u03b3 + IL-2 + ) expressions than did cells in LV.

Studies showed that memory T cells located in mucosal tissues enhanced regional immunity by rapid control of infections. 11, 26, 41, 48 These tissue-resident memory T cells formed an immune barrier and functioned as a defence line to pathogenic invasions, and often coexpressed multicytokines and were potent at eliminating invading pathogens. 11, 26 Thus, I.N. immunization with RV3615c could be an effective way to induce adaptive immunity in the airway and the lungs.",

The use of CpG was based on our experience and previous studies. 49 The adjuvant might activate the innate immune system, lower the threshold for signalling of activation, and reduce the quantity of antigen required for initiating an immune response. 36 immunization with Rv3615c elicits additional protection beyond those induced by BCG. We propose that a sustained vaccine-induced CD4 + T-cell response against a broad spectrum of targets, and with diverse functionalities, provides a better protection compared to a narrow response. Our study provides important information related to inducing broad spectrum and quality immunity against M.tb infections, and sheds light on the rational design of vaccines.",

After prime and boost with Rv3615c, the cytokine-producing cells peaked at week 4. Most of the cytokine-producing cells expressed IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1; some of them expressed IL-17 and IL-2 in the spleen, lung, and LN. A few of them expressed IL-4, but the IL-4 production was only transient. The IFN-\u03b3-, TNF-\u03b1-, and IL-2producing cells were maintained for at least 16 weeks, while the IL-17producing cells declined in frequency significantly after 12 weeks. Since antigen-specific memory CD4 + T cells with a Th1-type profile were associated with a reduced M.tb burden in the animal model, an improved bacterial clearance, and less severe pulmonary inflammation in the human clinical trial, 39,40 our data suggested that Rv3615c induced a sustained adaptive immunity with the potential for a rapid response to M.tb challenge and protection against infection. Immunization-induced memory cells located at the site of pathogen invasion are crucial for timely and efficient response to an infection. Different immunization routes utilize different subsets of antigen-presenting cells, and consequently activate different subsets of CD4 + T cells at their specific tissue compartment 26 ; establishing a long-term resident CD4 + memory T-cell population in barrier tissues through local immunization promoted regional immunity and demonstrated a key point for vaccine design. 4,41 S.C. immunization expanded Rv3615c-specific CD4 + T cells systemically, in terms of elevated cytokines in serum, frequency of cytokine-expressing cells, and quantity of cytokines in the lung, spleen, and LN tissues. and cytokine-producing cells in BALF and LP, suggesting a status of tissue residency. The quantity of cytokines and frequency of cytokine-producing cells in lung were higher than those in the spleen and LN, and higher than those induced by S.C. immunization. In addition, I.N. immunization promoted not only regional immunity in the respiratory compartment but also systemic immunity, in terms of increased frequency of cytokine-producing cells and cytokine productions in the spleen and LN at the level comparable to that induced by S.C. immunization. I.N. immunization with Rv3615c also established a sustained adaptive B-cell immunity in the airway. The elevated Rv3615c-specific antibodies in sIgA, IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a isotypes were maintained in BALF for at least 8-12 weeks post the prime and boost, and antibodies in IgM isotype were maintained for at least 6 weeks. I.N. immunization also elevated Rv3615c-specific sIgA and IgA in serum, while S.C. immunization had no significant impact on antibody levels in BALF but elevated Rv3615c-specific IgG1 and IgG2a only in serum. Although the role of antibody response on preventing M.tb infection and in eradicating the pathogen is still in debate and requires further investigation, 42,43 our study has demonstrated that I.N. immunization establishes a sustained adaptive immunity in the respiratory tract and in lung tissue, posing an advantageous response to pathogenic invasion without time-consuming recruitment of effector cells from peripheral lymphoid tissues. 44 Efficiency of adaptive immunity depends not only on the magnitude of response but also on functional quality of cells responding to the infection. T cells with IFN-\u03b3 only production were characterized as terminally differentiated and exhausted, and associated with active TB progression, 45,46 while effector-memory CD4 + T cells with multicytokine coexpression were associated with control of M.tb and other infections. 47 I.N. immunization showed preference of inducing CD44 + CD62L low effector-memory CD4 + T cells (CD4 + T EM ) in the lung, with a frequency higher than those in the spleen and LN, and those induced by S.C. immunization. Many CD4 + T EM cells coexpress multicytokines. The frequency of IFN-\u03b3 + TNF-\u03b1 + double-expressing,and IFN-\u03b3 + TNF-\u03b1 + IL-2 + triple-expressing cells induced by I.N. immunization was significantly higher than those induced by S.C immunization, and higher than the cells in the spleen and LNs induced by the same immunization. The elevated frequency of CD4 + T EM and multicytokine coexpressing cells in the lung was maintained for at least 16 and 12 weeks respectively. Multicytokine coexpression and effector-memory phenotype represented a potency of CD4 + T cells in eradicating the pathogen and controlling the disease progression.45 Our data suggested that I.N. immunization with Rv3615c established an adaptive immunity with cells possessing functional quality and a sustainable response.Upon further analysis of cells after the prime and boost, our data revealed that I.N. immunization-expanded cells were mostly in the respiratory tract and LP, while majority of S.C. immunization-expanded cells were in the LV. Cells in BALF and LP had a higher frequency of effector-memory differentiation (CD62L low and CD127 + ), tissue residency (CD69 + and CD103 + ), migration and mucosal tissue",

Also, we have not distinguished if our I.N. prime and boost selectively expanded precursors of effector-memory CD4 + T cells in the respiratory tissue compartment or initiated migration and differentiation of na\u00efve cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues, although the magnitude of response was relatively low in the lymphoid tissues. However, as an extension to our previous investigation, we have demonstrated that I.N. immunization with Rv3615c establishes a sustained adaptive immunity and a potential of rapid response to M.tb infections in the local respiratory system. The I.N. inoculation is not novel for test of TB and other vaccinations. To our knowledge, there are few, if any, reports on Rv3615c-induced responses induced by I.N.in mouse model. We believe that our data provide information to support further investigation of the Rv315c as a vaccine candidate delivered by alternative routes. Limited by biosafety regulations, we are not qualified to test if immunization with Rv3615c could protect mice from a virulent M.tb challenge, and the potential of inducing sustainable adaptive immunity in humans requires further clinical study. The benefit of inducing effector-memory CD4 + T cells with multicytokine production and a tissue-resident property remain unclear in the context of this mouse model. Since M.tb proteins are expressed at different stages of the infection and induce distinct immune responses,50",
