An estimated 390 million people are at risk for infection with DENV and there are no effective vaccines or therapeutics. We utilized RNA chromatography coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry (qMS) to identify host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that interact with DENV-2 RNA. We identified ERI3 (also PRNPIP and PINT1), a putative 3\u2032-5\u2032 RNA exonuclease, which preferentially associates with DENV-2 genomic RNA via interactions with dumbbell structures in the 3\u2032 UTR. ERI3 is required for accumulation of DENV-2 genomic RNA and production of infectious particles. Furthermore, the mosquito homologue of ERI3 is required for DENV-2 replication in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitos implying that the requirement for ERI3 is conserved in both DENV hosts. In human cells ERI3 localizes to the Golgi in uninfected cells, but relocalizes near sites of DENV-2 replication in infected cells. ERI3 is not required for maintaining DENV-2 RNA stability or translation of the viral polyprotein, but is required for viral RNA synthesis. Our results define a specific role for ERI3 and highlight the importance of Golgi proteins in DENV-2 replication.",

DENV proteins are translated as a single polyprotein that is cleaved by cellular and virus-encoded proteases to give rise to individual DENV proteins. Viral RNA replication is accomplished by the multifunctional proteins NS3 and NS5, which copy viral RNA into negative strand templates for subsequent rounds of positive strand RNA amplification. Nascent transcripts are utilized as templates for translation of viral proteins, packaged into newly assembled virions or degraded by cellular enzymes to generate the 3\u2032 UTR-derived subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) 3,4 . Viral replication occurs in close association with intracellular membranes in part to conceal dsRNA replication intermediates, which can be detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and induce a strong innate immune response to infection 5,6 . While several studies suggest that these membranes are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, the dynamics and precise composition of membranes that support DENV replication are not known 6,7 . Indeed, several studies using the Kunjin strain of WNV demonstrate that Golgi-derived membranes are recruited to replication sites 8, 9 .

We identified ERI3 (also PRNPIP or PINT1) in an RNA chromatography-based proteomics screen host proteins that interact with viral RNAs. ERI3 was previously identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with prion protein and is closely related to ERI1 (also 3\u2032 hExo), a 3\u2032 -5\u2032 RNA exonuclease that regulates 3\u2032 end formation and cell cycle-dependent turnover of histone mRNAs [13] [14] [15] [16] . In addition, ERI3 was identified in an RNAi screen for proteins required for early events in HIV-1 replication 17 . RNAi-mediated knockdown of ERI3 impaired accumulation of viral RNA and production of infectious particles for both DENV-2 and YFV17D, but not Enterovirus 71 (EV71). RNA immunoprecipitation of ERI3 from infected cells showed that ERI3 bound to DENV-2 and YFV17D RNA, with a clear preference for DENV-2 genomic RNA over sfRNA. ERI3 localized with Golgi markers, and this localization was driven by sequences in the N-terminus of ERI3. During DENV-2 infection, ERI3 relocalized, along with Golgi markers, to sites of DENV-2 replication. ERI3 was not required for the stability of viral RNA, but was required for DENV-2 RNA synthesis. The localization of ERI3 to the Golgi and its relocalization to DENV-2 replication sites during infection highlights a previously unappreciated role for the Golgi in viral replication.",

A previous study utilized HeLa cell lysates and RNA affinity chromatography coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry (qMS) to identify proteins that interact with the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) of DENV-2 (New Guinea C strain) 10, 12 . We performed a similar screen with HuH-7 cell lysates to identify proteins that bind to the DENV-2 UTRs in a commonly used cell culture model for Flavivirus replication. We defined DENV-2 UTR-interacting proteins as those enriched \u2265 2-fold over the control RNA in three independent experiments with at least \u2265 2 ratio counts. Thirty-seven (37) proteins met these criteria ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1 \"Pos strand RBPs\"). Of these, twenty-one (21) proteins had been identified in our previous screen as candidate DENV-2 UTR-interacting proteins in HeLa cells 10 ; among these 21 was the putative DEDD RNA exonuclease ERI3 (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S1 \"New screen v Ward et al. 10 \"). ERI3 was enriched for binding to the UTR RNA 2.6-fold, on average (SD = 0.255) ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Indeed, ERI3 was independently identified as a candidate 'hit' in an RNAi screen for templates to generate RNA for chromatography. T7 promoter, aptamer sequence and nucleotide coordinates of sequences from DENV-2 NGC are indicated for the control NS2A and UTR constructs (figure adapted from 10 ). (B) Scatter plot comparing the results from two independent quantitative mass spectrometric analyses of DENV-2 UTR-interacting proteins (three independent experiments were performed in total). In the experiment plotted on the y-axis (forward experiment), the control RNA was incubated with lysate from cells labeled with light arginine and lysine (K0R0) and the DENV-2 UTR RNA was incubated with lysate from cells labeled with heavy arginine and lysine (K8R10). In the experiment plotted on the x-axis (reverse experiment), the control RNA was incubated with heavy lysate and the DENV-2 UTR RNA was incubated with light lysate. The minimum of 2 or more fold change for both reverse and forward experiments were used to select the most confident interacting partners (red dots in upper left quadrant).",

RNA chromatography and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed an interaction between ERI3 and DENV-2 and YFV17D RNA, but not EV71 RNA (Figs 1 and 2) . Additionally, ERI3 was a candidate 'hit' in an RNAi screen for DENV-2 host factors in HuH-7 cells (Barrows et al., manuscript in preparation). In order to test the functional importance of ERI3 for DENV-2 infection, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown and infection with DENV-2, YFV17D or EV71. ERI3 knockdown was performed using two independent siRNAs (siERI3_III and siERI3_VII) transfected 48 hours prior to infection. As a positive control for knockdown of DENV-2 host factors, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (ATP6V0C) that is required for endosomal acidification and efficient virus replication 20, 21 . At 24 hours post-infection, total cell lysates were harvested for western blot analysis or total cellular RNA was harvested and analyzed for viral RNA levels by qPCR. Tissue culture supernatants were harvested for foci forming assays or plaque assays. ERI3 knockdown was validated by western blot using an ERI3-specific antibody (Fig. 3A ,D,G) and qPCR for ERI3 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2A-C) . Knockdown of the vATPase subunit or ERI3 led to a 3-to 10-fold reduction in DENV-2 gRNA accumulation compared to the control knockdown (One-way ANOVA, P < 0.0001, Dunnett's post-test P < 0.05) (Fig. 3B ). Since the qPCR primers target the NS2A region of the viral genome and gRNA is incompletely degraded to generate sfRNA, we wanted to determine if gRNA was being degraded to sfRNA in the absence of ERI3. We performed qPCR using gRNA-specific primers and a set of primers that targets the 3\u2032 UTR, which detects both gRNA and sfRNA. In vitro transcribed DENV-2 replicon RNA, containing both target sequences, was used to generate cDNA, perform qPCR and plot a standard curve for absolute quantitation of gRNA and sfRNA levels, as described in Bidet et al. 18 . Knockdown of the vATPase subunit led to a 10-fold reduction of the sfRNA:gRNA ratio compared to the control knockdown (One-way ANOVA, P < 0.021, Dunnett's post-test, P < 0.05) ( Supplementary Fig. S2D ). DENV-2 replication is restricted early following knockdown of the vATPase subunit and RT-qPCR would primarily detect incoming viral genomes, leading to a reduction in the sfRNA:gRNA ratio ( Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S2D ) 21 . Similarly, knockdown of ERI3 led to a 5-to 10-fold reduction of the sfRNA:gRNA ratio compared to the control knockdown (One-way ANOVA, P < 0.021, Dunnett's post-test, P < 0.05) ( Supplementary Fig. S2D ). These results suggest that ERI3 is required for accumulation of both gRNA and sfRNA, and, therefore, an early process in replication is defective in the absence of ERI3.",

Given these observations we sought to define the role of ERI3 in DENV RNA replication. To determine if ERI3 functions in the synthesis or stability of DENV-2 RNA in infected cells, we developed an assay that would allow specific inhibition of virus transcription using the NS5 inhibitor NITD008 and analysis of DENV-2 RNA levels over time (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig. S4A ,B) 22 . We performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of ERI3 followed by infection with DENV-2 as described above. Infected cells were harvested at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after addition of 25 \u03bc M NITD008 and assayed for DENV-2 RNA using qPCR. Levels of DENV-2 RNA were normalized to GAPDH and plotted as the fold-change from the 4-hour time point. A linear regression analysis was used to compare ERI3 knockdown to the control siRNA treatment. Western blot analysis confirmed ERI3 knockdown compared to the control siRNA and pan-actin loading control at the 4 and 20 hour time points (Fig. 4A) .",

The DENV-2 replicon has most of the structural protein coding sequence replaced with the Renilla luciferase (RLuc) ORF, but retains the non-structural protein coding sequences required for RNA synthesis 23 . The replicon RNA initiates translation and subsequently RNA replication when electroporated into cells, bypassing the need for receptor-mediated endocytosis. We transfected cells with a control siRNA or two independent siRNAs targeting ERI3 (siERI3_III and siERI3_VII), and electroporated cells with in vitro transcribed replicon RNA. To assay viral translation in the absence of RNA synthesis, we also used a replicon containing a mutation in NS5 that renders the RdRp inactive 24 . Cells were harvested at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-electroporation and analyzed by western blot or dual-luciferase assay. Western blots of cell lysates confirmed that ERI3 levels were reduced at 4 and 72 hours post-electroporation compared to the control siRNA knockdown (Fig. 4C) . At 4 hours post-electroporation, there was no significant difference in RLuc levels with the NS5 mutant replicon or with the wildtype replicon in the control or ERI3 knockdown (Fig. 4D ). This indicates that translation of the incoming replicon RNA is not impaired following ERI3 knockdown. We performed an independent polyribosome analysis of DENV-2-infected cells and found that GAPDH and DENV-2 RNA localize to similar fractions in control and ERI3 knockdown samples ( Supplementary  Fig. S4E-H) , which was consistent with the replicon data.",

Interestingly, the Golgi markers GOLGB1, GOLGA1 and TGON2 all exhibited a similar staining pattern as ERI3 (Fig. 5C) , suggesting that ERI3 localizes in close proximity to the Golgi in uninfected cells. Additional studies using ERI3 sequences fused to EGFP suggest that Golgi localization is driven by sequences in the N-terminal portion of ERI3 (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig. S6 ).

Paradoxically, DENV-2 replication has been shown to take place in the ER 6,7 , whereas ERI3 has been shown to localize to Golgi structures ( Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S6 ). In order to determine the localization of ERI3 during DENV-2 infection, we infected HuH-7 cells for 18, 20 or 24 hours and probed with antibodies to ERI3, TGON2 and dsRNA, a marker for DENV-2 replication sites. As seen in Fig. 6 , ERI3 and TGON2 localized to condensed cytoplasmic structures, consistent with the Golgi in uninfected cells (Fig. 6A) . At 18 hours post-infection, ERI3 primarily localized to similar condensed Golgi structures as TGON2, distinct from areas marked by anti-dsRNA (Fig. 6A) . At 20 and 24 hours post-infection, however, the condensed Golgi structure appeared to expand or break down and both ERI3 and TGON2 relocated to within close proximity of dsRNA (Fig. 6A ). To confirm that TGON2 was relocalizing to ER-derived replication sites, we probed with antibodies to TGON2, dsRNA and the ER marker CANX. At 24 hours post-infection, TGON2 and CANX localized near to dsRNA, confirming that TGON2 is relocalizing to similar sites as CANX (Fig. 6A) . These data demonstrate that ERI3, along with Golgi-associated membranes, are found near sites of DENV-2 replication during infection. The localization of ERI3 in infected cells and its role in RNA synthesis probably explains why we do not detect significant interactions with the DENV-2 sfRNA.",

In order to further resolve the structures formed by ERI3, dsRNA and ER (CANX) or Golgi markers (TGON2) at replication sites, we performed additional imaging by three-dimensional super resolution microscopy. At 24 hours post-infection, samples were prepared as described previously and imaged using the Zeiss LSM880 confocal, equipped with an Airyscan detector capable of 140 nm resolution. DENV-2 infected cells were identified by positive staining for dsRNA and, consistent with the previous results (Fig. 6A) , ERI3 relocalized to the vicinity of replication sites as punctate aggregates (Fig. 6B) . CANX, a previously described marker for replication sites 6 , localized to the ER and nuclear envelope and near to viral replication sites. Volumetric rendering of these sites elucidated microdomains containing small membranous sheets of CANX along with dsRNA and ERI3 (Fig. 6B) . We performed a similar analysis using samples stained for dsRNA, ERI3 and TGON2. TGON2 relocalized from the Golgi and formed interconnected membranous structures surrounding the ERI3 puncta and replication sites, and dsRNA, ERI3 and TGON2 were observed in close proximity to one another without direct colocalization observed (Fig. 6C) . These results demonstrate that ERI3, as well as ER and Golgi markers, relocalize to replication sites in DENV-2 infected cells. Interestingly, these results suggest that both the ER and Golgi membranes are being remodeled in DENV-2-infected cells.",

Dominski (UNC, Chapel Hill). Several studies have established roles for 3\u2032 -5\u2032 RNA exonucleases in viral replication. Lassa fever virus nucleoprotein has been shown to possess dsRNA-specific 3\u2032 -5\u2032 exonuclease activity that degrades dsRNA replication intermediates that can stimulate the host innate immune response 27 . Our studies suggest that ERI3 function in viral replication is not linked to the host innate immune response, since RT-qPCR analysis showed similar levels of IFN and ISG mRNA expression following infection in control and ERI3 knockdown cells (S2 Fig. E-H) . Coronavirus nsp14 has been shown to possess 3\u2032 -5\u2032 exonuclease activity that is required for maintaining replication fidelity of the viral RdRp 28-30 . Since DENV-2 has been shown to undergo 3\u2032 end repair, it is possible that ERI3 is required for excision of non-templated nucleotides and maintenance of genome fidelity 31 . However, mutations that inactivate the proofreading activity of Coronavirus nsp14 had no effect on replication kinetics in tissue culture, suggesting that viral RNA synthesis and fidelity are not necessarily linked 30 . Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that exonuclease activity is not required for the pro-viral action of ERI3 (data not shown). While additional experiments are required to define the precise function in DENV-2 RNA synthesis, ERI3 could be an attractive host factor for therapeutic targeting in both humans and mosquitoes.",

However, in DENV-2-infected cells, ERI3 and the Golgi resident protein TGON2 relocalized near to sites of viral replication. Super-resolution imaging by Airyscan revealed that ERI3, as well as ER and Golgi markers, localized near viral replication sites, suggesting DENV-2 induces relocalization of these proteins to facilitate virus replication. Flaviviruses induce extensive membrane rearrangements during infection, and previous studies using DENV-2 implicated primarily ER-derived membranes 6, 7 . In contrast, studies of membrane rearrangements induced by the Kunjin strain of WNV suggest that Golgi proteins are recruited to replication sites 8, 9 . Furthermore, Brefeldin A inhibition of Golgi-ER retrograde transport has been shown to inhibit Kunjin virus replication, suggesting a critical role for Golgi proteins in Flavivirus replication 32 . Here, we present evidence that, in addition to ER-resident proteins, DENV-2 recruits Golgi-resident proteins to replication sites, highlighting a possible role for the Golgi in establishment or maintenance of viral replication. One model implicating Golgi proteins in DENV-2 replication is that they are required to establish replication sites in the ER membrane, either by initiating or stabilizing novel membrane structures in the ER. Indeed, several host factors, including Golgi-associated proteins, have been identified that mediate membrane deformation and establishment of DENV and other positive strand virus replication sites, including FASN and GBF1 33 . However, it is not clear whether ERI3 provides a functional link between membrane remodeling and viral RNA synthesis or is simply recruited from the Golgi to replication sites for synthesis-specific functions.",

(B) At 4, 8, 12 and 20 hours after addition of NITD008, total RNA from control and ERI3 knockdown was analyzed for DENV-2 RNA levels relative to cellular GAPDH RNA. Levels are expressed as the fold change from the 4 hour timepoint and were analyzed by linear regression using the GraphPad Prism software package. Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate. (C) Total cell lysates from control and ERI3 knockdown at 4 and 72 hours post-electroporation were analyzed by western blot for ERI3 and pan-actin. (D) Total cell were harvested at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-electroporation and analyzed by dual luciferase assay for Renilla and firefly luciferase content. The GDD sample was electroporated with a mutant replicon that contains point mutations in the active site of NS5, rendering it replication deficient. For each timepoint, Renilla luciferase (RLuc) levels were normalized to the 4 hour firefly luciferase level. Normalized RLuc was plotted and analyzed by one-way ANOVA using the GraphPad Prism software package. Replicon assays were performed in three independent experiments.Scientific RepoRts | 6:34379 | DOI: 10.1038/srep34379",
