            "text": "Asthma is a common, chronic respiratory disease that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. It is prevalent in more than 10% of the population in many industrialized countries [1] . Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR); patients with asthma typically present with coughing, breathlessness, wheezing, and chest tightening [2] . T helper (Th)2 cells secrete the cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which play critical roles in the pathogenesis of asthma, stimulate immunoglobulin E production, and enhance eosinophil accumulation [3] . Notably, the cytokine milieu in which T lymphocytes are activated is one of the most critical elements in determining T helper differentiation. IL-25 and IL-33 were recently recognized as playing a central role in immune deviation toward pathogenic Th2 responses during the evolution of T helper effector cells [4, 5] . Th1 secretions enhance neutrophilic infiltration, a hallmark of severe asthma, by inducing increased production of neutrophil-attracting chemokines in the lung [6, 7] . Th17 cells are characterized by IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-21 production; these cytokines also indirectly promote eosinophilic infiltration and airway macrophage survival by enhancing Th2 responses and B cell differentiation [8, 9] . Increasing cellular immune network complexity, Th9 and Th22 cells are involved in the pathological and physiological changes of asthma. Th9 cells, which mainly secrete IL-9, are major contributors to the onset and progression of asthma inflammation; IL-9 is associated with mucus hypersecretion, bronchial hyperreactivity, and increased Th2 cytokine expression [10, 11] . However, the exact mechanism of Th22 involvement in asthma development and pathogenesis has not been elucidated [4] . In contrast, regulatory T cells (Treg cells, a CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + subset) have inhibitory effects on asthma airway inflammation, inhibiting the proliferation of other T cells [12] ; it is believed they are mediated by cytokines such as tumor growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) and IL-10 [13] . FOXP3 expression is considered a master regulator of Treg inhibition function [14] . FOXP3 associates with other transcription factors, including nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), augmenting Treg transcriptional machinery, cytokine production, and protein expression [15, 16] .",

During birth and rapidly thereafter, the infant's gut is colonized by bacteria from the mother and the surrounding environment. It is obvious that exposure at birth would differ with the mode of delivery [17] . During vaginal delivery (VD), contact with the maternal vaginal and intestinal flora is an important source for initiating bacterial colonization of the infant's gut. This direct contact is absent during cesarean delivery (CD), and non-maternally derived environmental bacteria play an important role in the intestinal colonization of the infant's gut [18] . CD may alter gut bacterial flora, where VD newborns are colonized with beneficial bacterial strains earlier than CD newborns, whereas CD infants may have abnormal primary gut flora levels for up to six months after birth [19] . In addition, increased clostridia colonization is associated with CD [20] , altering microbial stimuli that may influence immune system maturation and the development of antigenic tolerance, increasing the risk of asthma and other allergic diseases [21] .",

We found that early-life fed-CL in CD infant mice created an immunosuppressive environment that increased CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + Treg numbers and impaired T effector cells, including Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 production and cytokine secretion in vivo following exposure to the allergen ovalbumin (OVA) after weaning.

Treg numbers and frequency in C/CL/-mice MLN were increased compared with that of C/-/-mice (Fig 4A-4C) . Conversely, Treg levels were significantly decreased in C/-/ OVA mice; that of C/CL/OVA mice were significantly increased compared with that of C/-/ OVA mice (Fig 4A-4C) . RT-PCR investigation of the expression of the Treg-specific transcription factor FOXP3 in whole lung tissue revealed increased Foxp3 expression in both fed-CL groups relative to C/-/-. Foxp3 expression was increased in C/CL/OVA mice as compared to C/-/OVA mice (Fig 4D) . We performed a standard in vitro T cell inhibition assay to define the function of the fed-CL-induced Treg cells. Fresh CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells and CD4 + CD25 -T cells were obtained from 6-8-week-old untreated BALB/c mice; induced CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells were obtained from C/CL/-mice. In comparison to the fresh Treg cells, the induced Treg cells had significantly improved inhibition function. In addition, the relative increase in CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells was accompanied by increased proliferation inhibition function; the inhibition was strongest at a 1:1 ratio (Fig 4E) . As expected, analysis of the cytokine content of the cell-free BALF revealed significantly decreased Treg cytokines (IL-10, TGF-\u03b21) in C/-/ OVA mice as compared with the C/-/-control. However, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 were significantly higher in C/CL/OVA mice as compared with C/-/OVA mice (Fig 4F and 4G) . Early-life fed-CL has an immunosuppressive effect Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, and Th22 lymphocytes are regularly associated with allergic asthma. Therefore, we assessed the levels of these lymphocytes to study the effects of fed-CL on Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, and Th22 inflammation in a mouse asthma model. Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 were increased in C/-/OVA mice as compared to the control C/-/-mice, but were statistically decreased in C/CL/OVA mice as compared with C/-/OVA mice (p < 0.05, Fig 5A) . Nevertheless, Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 levels were all significantly higher in C/CL/OVA mice as compared with C/-/-and C/CL/-mice (Fig 5A) .

As expected, the cytokines of Th1 (IFN-\u03b3), Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13), Th9 (IL-9), and Th17 (IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-23) were all significantly increased in C/-/OVA mice as compared with the C/-/-mice (Fig 5B-5E) ; however, the levels were all significantly lower in C/CL/OVA mice as compared with C/-/OVA mice ( Fig  5B-5E ). The Th22 cytokine IL-22 in C/-/OVA mice was significantly decreased as compared with the C/-/-mice; there was no difference in IL-22 production in C/CL/OVA mice as compared with C/-/OVA mice (Fig 5F) . Furthermore, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-23 levels in C/CL/OVA mice were higher than that in C/-/-mice, and IL-13, IL-9, IL-17A, IL-21, and IL-23 levels in C/CL/OVA mice were higher than that in C/CL/-mice (Fig 5C-5E ). IL-25 and IL-33 were recently recognized as being central to immune deviation toward pathogenic Th2 responses during T helper cell evolution [4] . In our study, IL-25 and IL-33 were statistically increased in both C/-/OVA and C/CL/OVA mice as compared with the C/-/-mice, and IL-25 and IL-33 levels were significantly lower in C/CL/OVA mice as compared with C/-/OVA mice (Fig 5G) .",

Indeed, there has been a progressive increase in the rates of CD worldwide, which the World Health Organization has reported as almost doubling in the last decade [34] . Several epidemiological studies have suggested that asthma risk is increased in children born by caesarian section [35] [36] [37] .

Treg numbers are normalized when the microbiota is reconstituted in germ-free mice, and a mixture of clostridial species (cluster IV and XIVa strains) appears to drive their development [39] . Clostridium-mediated induction of Treg cells in the colon may be responsible for systemic immune responses. In our study, a substantial increase in Treg cells was observed in mouse liver, lung, and spleen within three weeks of Clostridium inoculation. This finding suggests that Clostridium colonization in the intestine also affects the extraintestinal immune status [40] . In addition, the altered Schaedler flora, a defined group of eight bacterial strains that are common colonizers of mouse intestines and that include a combination of Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Flexistipes, and Clostridium species, can be used to reconstitute the microbiota to re-establish Treg numbers [41, 42] . Treg loss or absence results in the development of asthma, which adoptive transfer of natural or induced Treg cells can ameliorate [43] . Despite infants and young children representing a population highly affected by both C. leptum and asthma, there are very few data on the relationship between the two in the early stages of asthma development [40] .",

In most asthma phenotypes, there are increased levels of eosinophils, neutrophils, and other inflammatory cells in the tissues, blood, and BALF. Compared with the control, there were increased total cell number, eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages in the BALF of OVA-sensitized mice. Furthermore, there was aggravated inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissues. We also observed persistent AHR. Asthma is defined as a variable level of airway obstruction typically accompanied by AHR; we measured airway resistance to monitor the effects of C. leptum on AHR, and found that C. leptum inhibited the OVA-induced AHR in response to the inhaled methacholine. The recruitment mechanisms of inflammatory cells associated with and presumably causing AHR are well-studied. Inflammatory cell migration in to the lung, specifically, that of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils, is a major contributor to the development of allergic airway inflammation. Increased eosinophil numbers in the BALF and lung inflammatory infiltrates is a characteristic of asthma. Our results clearly demonstrate that C. leptum significantly reduces eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils in BALF and airway tissue inflammatory infiltrates.",

Feeding weanling mice with C. leptum increased MLN CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + Treg frequency and number. Additionally, there were decreased Treg percentages in the lungs of OVA-sensitized mice. Quantitative and functional impairment of pulmonary CD4 + CD25 + Foxp + Treg cells in pediatric asthma patients has been observed, demonstrating that CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + Treg cells can reverse established allergic airway inflammation and prevent airway remodeling [44] . These findings all suggest that decreased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 production causes impaired function of the local airway CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + Treg cells in this mouse model of asthma. As Treg cells inhibit disease-promoting immune responses, enhancing Treg function is an attractive potential therapy for treating allergic asthma. We also show that early-life fed-CL increased Treg numbers in the target tissue-associated lymph nodes, Foxp3 expression in the lung, and IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 levels in BALF. This immunosuppression could have beneficial effects with respect to asthma airway inflammation.",

            "text": "Indeed, our data demonstrate alleviated allergic responses in mice that had been fed with C. leptum as infants and then challenged with OVA during weaning. This was evidenced by AHR and the decreased Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell numbers in MLN and related cytokines (IFN\u03b3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-23) in the OVA-sensitized fed-CL adult mice. Interestingly, OVA-challenged adult mice demonstrate a Th9-mediated response [44] ; we found that OVA challenge in infant mice also featured a dominant Th9 component. Therefore, it is of little surprise that fed-CL plus OVA challenge inhibited the Th9 response as compared with OVA challenge alone. Th22 cells are recent siblings of Th17 cells that predominantly produce IL-22 and represent a separate T helper subset with distinct gene expression and functions. Recent evidence indicates that IL-22 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and allergic diseases, implicating Th22 cells and IL-22 as potential therapeutic targets in autoimmune diseases [11, 45] . Furthermore, researchers have only begun to explore the role of IL-22 in allergy and asthma, but the effect of IL-22 is inconclusive. IL-22 attenuates the allergic response in the lungs of mice, demonstrating the negative regulatory function of IL-22 in allergy [46] . IL-22 also appears important in the defense against severe chronic rhinosinusitis, which often develops from allergic rhinitis and is associated with IL-22 receptor polymorphisms [47] . Here, we show that OVA significantly decreases MLN Th22 frequency and BALF IL-22 levels and that fed-CL does not affect Th22 frequency and IL-22. Furthermore, previous studies found that B-cell expansion is required to induce Treg generation and T-cell tolerance. Consequently, it has been speculated that B-cells play a role in the Treg increase in mice with early-life C. leptum exposure [48, 49] .",

The presence of this inhibitory environment attenuated OVA-specific responses in the lung, leading to decreased overall inflammation and AHR. These findings illustrate a negative regulatory mechanism for asthma development in the context of C. leptum with OVA during early life, illustrating the importance of C. leptum in alleviating early-life asthma development.
