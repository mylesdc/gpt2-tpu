Influenza virus B, enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human coronavirus and parainfluenza virus 4 were rarely detected (<1%). Frequency of IFV A was highest among patients aged between 45-64 years (p < 0.001), while adenovirus among patients aged 14-17 years (p < 0.001), no differences was found in other RVs. The proportion of pandemic H1N1 increased with severity of pneumonia evaluated by PSI (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The proportion of RVs in CAP is higher than previously reported. IFV A pneumonia are usually found in patients older than 45 years, while, adenovirus pneumonia are common in adolescents and young adults. Pandemic H1N1 virus is still recognized by PSI as a high-severity pathogen. The findings contribute baseline data on viral CAP study in China.",

The CAP It has been generally assumed that for respiratory infections due to viruses, the optimal specimen is the nasopharyngeal aspirate, rather than throat swabs we used here [16] . Actually, the detection rate was higher than 22% reported by Ruuskanen O et al. [6] based on 2910 CAP patients from 10 studies, also higher than 5-20% reported by other studies that had not used PCRbased assays [17] . IFV A was the first ranking viral pathogen. Among 94 cases, 68 (72.3%) had IFV A as the only identified pathogen, 20 (21.3%) had co-infection with bacteria, and six (6.4%) had co-infection with other RVs. Similar with other reports [18, 19] , the analysis of subtypes of IFV A revealed that pH1N1 virus was circulating along with sH3N2 virus, as this surveillance was carried out from the post-pandemic period of pH1N1 [20] . It has been reported that younger age and more severe respiratory compromise are key features of patients with pH1N1associated pneumonia compared with seasonal influenza pneumonia [21] . Here, oppositely, pH1N1 infected patients were mostly distributed in patients older than 45 years, which was coincident with the findings reported by Viasus D et al. [22] . This upward shift in age distribution is probably due to a higher seropositivity against A (H1N1) pdm09 virus in young adult patients. On the other side, although IFV A infected cases distributed through all PSI groups, all cases in high risk group were determined as pH1N1 (accounting for 16.7%, p < 0.05). And 93.3% of sH3N2 positive patients were found in low risk group, without high-risk cases. Two of four dead patients were caused by pH1N1. These findings suggest that the severity of pH1N1-associated CAP is still higher [22] . Four co-infection cases of pH1N1 and H3N2 were presented with PSI I-II, the reason was unclear. Further analysis of corresponding viral load and antiviral treatment might be needed.",
