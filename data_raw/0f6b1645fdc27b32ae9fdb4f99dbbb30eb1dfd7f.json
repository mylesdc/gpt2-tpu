In an effort to explain the reason for this enhanced susceptibility, we investigated the production of NO and O 2 2 in the monocytes of individuals with G6PD deficiency compared with normal controls. We found that levels of NO and O 2 2 were significantly lower in the DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals compared with normal controls. Furthermore, the overall oxidative stress in DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals was significantly higher when compared to normal controls. Correlation studies between DENV-infected cells and oxidative state of monocytes further confirmed these findings.",

Dengue infection is caused by dengue virus (DENV), an RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae. There are four serotypes of the virus which are referred to as DENV1, DENV2, DENV3 and DENV4. All four serotypes can cause the full spectrum of disease [2] . DENV is primarily transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti. Other Aedes species that transmit the disease include A. albopictus, A. polynesiensis, and A. scutellaris [3] . Although uncommon, DENV can also be transmitted via infected blood products and through organ transplantation [4, 5] .",

On the other hand, some patients experience more severe illness such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which can be life threatening [6] . Several factors have been associated with the development of severe dengue including prior infection with a heterotypic serotype, the strain of infecting virus, age and gender, and the genetic background of the patient. DENV-related illness is more common in children, and in contrast to other infections, well-nourished children are more predisposed to severe illness [7] . Polymorphism in genes coding for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), mannan-binding lectin 2 (MBL2), Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4), transforming growth factor b (TGFb), DC-SIGN, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II alleles have been linked with an increased risk of severe dengue complications [8] .

G6PD deficiency affects the production of reactive nitrogen (RNS) and oxygen species (ROS) such as nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O 2 2 ), and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) resulting in alterations of normal redox state of the cells [13] . Cells of immune system employ RNS/ ROS to kill invading pathogens.

Among these, there are 200,000 to 500,000 cases of life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Factors contributing to the development of DHF/DSS are not yet fully identified. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is prevalent in Southeast Asian countries where dengue is also endemic. Besides affecting normal function of erythrocytes, G6PD deficiency also affects other cells by causing abnormal cellular redox. Altered redox state of cells may render them less effective in clearing up microbial and viral infections. Here we confirm previous findings that monocytes from G6PD-deficinet individuals support better dengue virus replication. In addition, we show that reduced production of reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species and elevated levels of oxidative stress are responsible for the enhanced viral replication. We suggest that redox imbalance observed in infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals may facilitate dengue transmission and affect clinical outcome. However, a handful of studies carried out in areas where both G6PD deficiency and dengue are endemic, reveal no statistically significant correlation between severity of Dengue and G6PD deficiency. Well-designed studies are needed to demonstrate that G6PD-deficient individuals are at risk of severe dengue. cytometry and plaque assay respectively.

We have not studied the up-regulation of viral receptors but did clearly see an enhanced production of viral particles in these cells. Based on our findings and those reported by others, we propose a model for the association between the redox status of the host cells and DENV. Following entry into the cell, DENV fuses with endosomal membrane to release its nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm where viral RNA is replicated and translated into proteins. These processes may be affected by the cellular redox state, being more efficient in an oxidizing environment, thus resulting in enhanced virus production.",

In Thailand, the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in the general population is approximately 14%. A cohort of 89 males diagnosed with DHF was studied to determine if G6PD deficiency was related to occurrence and/or course of dengue infection. Out of 89, a total of 17 (19.1%) DHF patients had G6PD deficiency, thus no significant association established between G6PD deficiency and DHF [15] . However, this study is based on only a modest number of hospitalized patients and therefore provides little information on the incidence of severe dengue in G6PD deficient individuals. High prevalence of G6PD is also reported in African population [33] but a low incidence of severe dengue is noted in populations of African origin in a couple of studies conducted in Cuba [34] and Haiti [35] . Since the outcome of these studies is inconclusive, well-designed studies are needed to demonstrate whether G6PD-deficient individuals are at risk of severe dengue with statistical significance. Such studies would be potentially beneficial in providing added knowledge of host defense mechanism, and may be clinically important for G6PD-deficient individuals travelling to or living in DENV endemic areas.",
