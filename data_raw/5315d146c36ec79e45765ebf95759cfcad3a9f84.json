Beyond initiation, cytokines activate pro-tumorigenic transcription factors such as STAT3 and NF-kB in existing cancer cells [8] .

However, despite this elaborate cross-talk between cancer cells and the inflammatory microenvironment, the approach to uncover critical players in this interaction has so far been sporadic and non-comprehensive. In this study, we hypothesize that a common inflammatory pattern exists among different cancer types, constituting a signature profile termed as iCAMP. We performed a comprehensive analysis of gene expression across 7 common epithelial cancer types. A robust oncoinflammatory profile was identified, demonstrating independent and strong predictive values in clinical outcomes of multiple cancers. This approach has also led to the discovery and validation of KPNA2 as the single most consistently up-regulated protein in cancer.",

The false discovery rate (FDR) of each gene on each normalized dataset was calculated using permutation method implemented by the ''RankProd'' package in R [19] . Each gene in each dataset was then associated with a raw FDR, F up gi (F down gi ) for being up/down-regulated [17] .

The number of genes being up-regulated, downregulated, and non-differentially expressed for each dataset was estimated by a Beta mixture model implemented in WinBUGS [20] . Based on this rate and using independent Bernoulli distributions, we calculated the likelihood of a gene to be falsely identified as over/under-expressed among the seven datasets for each FDR threshold l. The procedure was evaluated by estimating the false discovery rate (FDR g ) observing the above expected log likelihood, i.e. the proportion of false positives among the genes identified to be consistently differentially expressed. The ''null log likelihood'' was computed by permuting the F up gi (F down gi )values relative to the genes within each dataset, and then performing the same above procedures to calculate the expected value of the ''null log likelihood'' in each permutation b for every gene, using FDR g~0 :05 as a cutoff.",

These datasets include expression microarray profiles from cancer tissues and corresponding normal tissues. After determining dysregulated genes in each cancer type, the Consistent Differential Expression Pattern (CDEP) methodology was implemented to identify differentially expressed genes across the seven datasets. 911 genes were up-regulated and 618 genes were down-regulated. Using DAVID, these genes were then functionally classified and the immune-related genes were identified ( Figure S2 , Table S2 ). To further improve the signalto-noise ratio, genes which showed a fold change (FC) ,2 in five or more cancer types were excluded. This resulted in a robust inflammatory profile, termed iCAMP, of 44 up-regulated and 52 down-regulated genes at the mRNA level ( Figure 1 ). The protein expression of iCAMP was verified by IHC in 6 cancer types: breast, colon, lung, pancreatic, prostate and gastric by mining the Human Protein Atlas (Table S3 , Figure S5 ). The clinical significance of iCAMP was determined by using Oncomine database. Finally, the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool was used to pinpoint the function of iCAMP in cancer-associated inflammation.",

Additionally, tumors were also enriched with genes in other immunological categories such as host-virus interaction and response to wounding ( Figure S2A ). Down-regulated genes were highly enriched for complement components in the alternative pathway (9.9 folds), T-cell-associated genes such as CD8a, granzyme A and mal, T cell differentiation proteins (7.3 folds) and genes involved in regulating NK cell function such as lectin-like receptor subfamily K, member 1 (KLRK1) ( Figure S2B ). The functions of many iCAMP genes are yet to be understood. For example, KPNA2 was shown to be upregulated across a broad-spectrum of cancer types ( Figure 1 ) [23, 24, 25, 26, 27] . It is unclear, however, if the possible tumor-promoting activity of KPNA2 is due to its function as a nuclear transporter for selective immunoregulatory proteins such as STAT1 [28] and interferon-cinduced transcription factor IRF-1 [29] .",

            "text": "To examine the protein expression pattern of the iCAMP genes, we took advantage of the publically available protein expression database, HPAT. Genes which did not show differential expression by IHC were not excluded due to the limited sensitivity of this method. Using IHC as a filtering step would expand the false negative observations, limiting the power of this study. However, it was informative to define which genes showed protein changes in what cancer types as this has direct implications on the choice of genes for further functional analyses. For example, KPNA2 was found to be increased in all cancer types except pancreatic cancer ( Figure 2 ). On the other hand, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR), a protein involved in the trans-epithelial transport of immunoglobulins, is consistently down-regulated in cancer cells (Figure 2) . Altogether, protein expression data is available for 34 up-regulated and 38 down-regulated genes (total = 72) of the 96 genes (Table S3, Figure S5 ). Of the 34 upregulated genes at the mRNA level, 13 were also up-regulated by IHC in at least 3 of 6 cancer types studied. As for the transcriptionally down-regulated genes (38 were examined for protein expression), 20 showed down-regulation by IHC in $3 of the same 6 cancer types. Clinical significance of iCAMP genes We next chose to use ovarian cancer to study the significance of iCAMP genes based on two considerations. First, most of ovarian malignancies are of epithelial origin which is histologically similar to the seven cancer types from which the gene profile was defined. Second, ovarian cancer was not used to generate the iCAMP genes. The predictive value of these genes in ovarian cancer would validate the utility of our gene discovery approach. As a control, the clinical predictive values of these genes were also examined in colon cancer. To determine the direction of dysregulation of each gene in ovarian cancer, we mined 5 published datasets [30, 31, 32, 33, 34] and one additional dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Table S4) , which collectively contain 35 normal and 878 cancer samples. Based on the number of datasets showing dysregulation in each direction, each gene was labeled as elevated, unchanged or repressed in ovarian cancer (Figure 1) . A gene is determined to be elevated if 1) at least 1 dataset shows up-regulation (p,0.05) and none of the other datasets shows downregulation, or 2) at least 3 datasets show up-regulation and not more than one dataset shows down-regulation (p,0.05). The inverse applies to repressed genes. Based on that, 33 of the 44 upregulated genes were also elevated in ovarian cancer, 3 were repressed and 8 could not be determined. Among the 52 downregulated genes, 28 were also repressed in ovarian cancer, 7 were unchanged, 10 were elevated and 7 were undetermined ( Figure 1) . Thus, at least 61 out of 96 iCAMP genes were concordantly dysregulated in ovarian cancer.",

This score takes into consideration the number of genes within which the patient falls in the high risk group, as well as the risk each of these genes confers. The robustness of IGIS was validated using the independent ovarian cancer TCGA dataset. Based on cutoff values pre-determined from the initial training dataset above [22] , stage IIIC patients from the TCGA dataset were categorized as either high or low risk for each gene. Then, for each gene where a TCGA patient shows poor prognosis, relative risk (RR pre-determined by the training dataset) of that gene was added to the patients IGIS score. The TCGA patients eventually were distributed with different IGIS scores based on expression levels of all 18 IGIS genes.

Recently, transcriptional profiling of blood from colorectal patients and normal controls by qRT-PCR identified TNFAIP6 as a biomarker for colorectal cancer [43] . This study shows that TNFAIP6 mRNA is elevated in peripheral blood cells of colorectal cancer patients. Here, we investigated the protein levels of TNFAIP6 in colon cancer cells and adjacent normal epithelium. Immunohistochemical staining of 55 colon cancer specimens and 50 adjacent normal tissues revealed an increased expression in cancer on a per cell basis, as well as an increase in the frequency of TNFAIP6-expressing cells ( Figures 9A, B and C). TNFAIP6 protein levels did not predict overall patient survival (data not shown).

The expression of selective genes was confirmed by tissue microarrays. Although the biological significance of our finding awaits further studies, it is clear that the iCAMP not only exists but also shows significant clinical relevance.

Any given change in gene expression could be an active process initiated by cancer cells and eventually promote invasiveness, or alternatively, be a reaction by other cells of the immune system.

            "text": "Among the genes that drew our attention was KPNA2, which was increased in expression in 6 of 7 cancer types at the mRNA and the protein levels, with limited expression in normal epithelia. KPNA2 is an embryonic antigen, shown to be expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells [52] and normal human testis [53, 54] , and emerges again in a variety of epithelial [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 55, 56] and non-epithelial [57, 58] cancers. Despite the exceptional correlation of this gene with cancer behavior across multiple cancer types, its function in shaping tumor behavior remains unclear. One study showed KPNA2 to promote invasive phenotypes of human breast cancer cells in vitro [59] , but the mechanism underlying this observation was not investigated. In a cell-free system, KPNA2 was reported to interact with OCT4, a transcription factor involved in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal in embryonic stem cells [54] . Could KPNA2 expression lead to a significant activity in cancer cells to produce oncogenic inflammatory mediators? This is possible, particularly since KPNA2 does not seem to be a general nuclear importer. The selective transport of some key immunologically important transcription factors such as STAT1 and IRF1 by KPNA2 raises a strong possibility of underlying immunological properties of KPNA2. Thus, the potential dual roles of KPNA2 to regulate inflammation as well as stemness of cells suggests that it could serve as a critical link between chronic inflammation and oncogenesis. This speculation warrants further studies.",

This predictive value of iCAMP as a biomarker awaits further investigation in prospective studies, much like the MamaPrintH [60] and Oncotype DXH [61] in optimizing personalized medical practice. Given the inflammatory function of iCAMP genes, the integrated score could prove effective in identifying high risk patients who would benefit from immunotherapy. In this regard, significant efforts are already undertaken to implement the immune score into the staging of cancer, in conjunction with the tumor (T), lymph node infiltration (N) and distal metastasis (M) parameters [62] .
