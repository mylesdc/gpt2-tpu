It is attributed to the rupture of immature blood vessels in the subependymal (or periventricular) germinal zone in the brain of preterm neonates [1] . In the USA, it affects 12,000 premature newborns each year, which accounts for up to 20% infants before 32 weeks of gestation [2] . Clinical studies have revealed that premature newborns with GMH can develop hydrocephalus or life-long neurologic dysfunction, which include mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and psychiatric disorders [3, 4] . Accumulating evidence shows that stroke can elicit systemic response in multiple organs, rather than being solely a brain injury. Therefore, more studies are needed to assess potential relationship between the brain and peripheral organs.",

It plays a role in clearance of dying red blood cells, hemoglobin removal, iron homeostasis, and B cell antibody production. Mounting evidence shows that post-stroke immunological responses are not only generated from brain, but also in the peripheral organs and tissues, including bone marrow, blood, and the spleen. Current studies have investigated splenic responses after stroke and highlighted the effect of the spleen in regulating peripheral immune system which is considerably involved in the secondary brain injury [5] . Furthermore, more and more splenic responses induced by stroke are being investigated, such as sympathetic nervous activation [6] , chemotactic cytokines generation [7] , and antigen presentation [8] . Once stroke induces splenic contraction, splenic cells mobilize into the circulation and subsequently accumulate in the region of primary brain injury [9] . In addition, splenectomy and irradiation of spleen both successfully attenuate splenic responses induced by brain injury and contribute to decreased brain lesion size and neurodegenerative outcomes [10] [11] [12] .",

It converts biliverdin-IX-alpha into bilirubin-IX-alpha, which plays a crucial role in the cellular redox cycle [13] . Bilirubin has been showed to be a potent antioxidative neuroprotectant [14] [15] [16] . BLVRA has a serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase which modulates insulin signaling and contributes to reducing cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease [17] . The modulation of inducible isozyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which is the upstream of BVR, was involved in multifactorial mechanisms correlated with immunomodulation, circulatory integrity, and cell survival [18] . Upregulation of HO-1 in macrophages led to an antiinflammatory M2 phenotype with increased interleukin (IL)-10, but decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [19, 20] . Furthermore, studies have investigated whether BV administration regulates inflammatory responses in macrophages by inhibiting TLR4, a key regulator of the innate immune system. It has been shown that BVinduced anti-inflammatory effect was BVR-dependent, since secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in the absence of BVR in macrophages [21] . Moreover, BV treatment induced anti-inflammatory effect was abolished with endothelia nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibition, even in the presence of TLR4 inhibition. However, whether BLVRA administration attenuates spleen-associated secondary brain injury has not been evaluated.",

Rat pups were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane while placed onto a stereotaxic frame then isoflurane concentration was reduced to 2%. The scalp area was sterilized by isopropyl alcohol. Bregma was used as a reference point, stereotactic coordinates were measured as follows: 1.6 (rostral) and 1.5 mm (lateral), and 2.8 mm (depth). A 1 mm burr hole was drilled, and then a 27-gauge needle was inserted at a rate of 1 mm/min. 0. 3 U clostridial collagenase VII-S (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was infused by the Hamilton syringe. The needle is left in the place for 10 min after injection to prevent \"black-leakage.\" Once the needle was removed with a rate of 1 mm/min, the bone wax was used to seal the burr hole and then incision site was sutured. After given buprenorphine, animals were allowed to recover on a 37\u00b0C heated blanket. After they were fully recovered, animals were placed back to their dams. Sham surgeries consisted of needle insertion without collagenase infusion.",

In clinical settings, immunodepression was found within days after stroke, characterized by lymphopenia, increased anti-inflammatory cytokines, and splenic contraction [31] . These observations indicated a systemic inflammation generated immediately after stroke. Infections, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infection, have high incidence in stroke patients, which may even further increase their mortality. Therefore, it is crucial to understand immune responses after GMH, since neonates have limited adaptive immunity. Spleen is a secondary peripheral immune organ that reserves large quantities of immune cells to produce pro-inflammatory responses after brain injuries [5] . Therefore, we assessed the stored peripheral immune cells released into the circulation as the splenic immune responses to GMH. Indeed, in this study, we explored how BLVRA ameliorated GMH-induced brain injuries and the consequent neurological deficits. We further evaluated the underlying mechanisms by which BLVRA attenuated inflammatory responses in the spleen. It might be via direct inhibition of TLR4, a key mediator of innate immunity and attenuation of the infiltration of peripheral immune cells.",

Consistent with previous studies, we found significantly developmental delay in GMH rats, with spontaneous resolution of neurological deficits 3 days after GMH [22, 32] . In our previous study, GMH caused a dramatic decrease in the endogenous BLVRA expression level in the brain from 3 h after GMH. The consumption of BLVRA may contribute to activating microglia and resolving hematoma by translocating into the nucleus and inhibiting the TLR-4 promoter. GMH-induced reduction of BLVRA was increased after 1 day, but still lower than the sham level. The reason for the decrease may be that the profound inflammatory response from GMH consumes BLVRA accumulated in the brain. The expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were striking increased after GMH, which cause the continuous consumption of BLVRA more than its accumulation [33] .",

We demonstrated a marked decrease in neutrophils in the spleen in response to GMH, which was reversed by BLVRA treatment. BLVRA also attenuated neutrophil infiltration into the brain 1 day after GMH. The reduction of splenic immune cells is unlikely due to cellular apoptosis or differentiation to macrophages/dendritic cells. Instead, it might result from cellular mobilization into the circulation and to inflamed tissues [38] . However, a dramatic increase in apoptotic response occurred on day 3, rather than day 1 post-GMH. According to a previous report, by 96 h after stroke, the percentage of B cells was reduced by about half to~30% of the remaining splenic cells. According to the research [39] , we presume that the reduction of B cells by 1 day constituted the majority of splenocytes loss, as well as a striking decrease of B cells by 3 days. These changes were accompanied by an increase in splenocytes that were committed to the apoptotic event showed by TUNEL staining. This is consistent with studies showing significant splenic cell death after focal cerebral ischemia, which is likely to occur in hyporesponse to T cell mitogens stimulation at 96 h after brain injury [39] .",

Then, we tested whether BLVRA was present and regulated eNOS phosphorylation in the spleen. The marked increase in phosphorylation of eNOS was observed with BLVRA treatment. The BLVRA-suppressed splenic inflammation was dependent on eNOS, since a selective eNOS inhibitor, Iromycin A, abolished the beneficial effects of BLVRA. The marked increase in phosphorylation of eNOS was consistent with increased NO generation. In addition, no significant changes in NO production in response to BLVRA stimulation was seen with the selective iNOS inhibitor, MEG, indicating that this mechanism of BLVRA on NO generation was eNOS-dependent. NO signaling was involved in regulating the immune system through S-nitrosylation of posttranslational modification [21] . Furthermore, S-nitrosylation, a form of cysteine modification interacting with enzymatic function, is prominent in regulating immune responses, such as TLR4 signaling [41, 42] . Since LPS induced BLVRA S-nitrosylation, NO might modify BLVRA on a cysteine, leading to its nuclear translocation and the consequent immune regulation. The role of BLVRA in regulating NO generation and the mechanism by which GMH induced splenic inflammation have not been described. We hypothesized that BLVRA modulated eNOS-derived NO and NO, in return, translocated BLVRA into the nuclear, resulting in suppressed inflammatory responses. This hypothesis is strengthened by accumulation of BLVRA in the nucleus of splenocytes with BLVRA administration, which was correlated with increased phosphorylation of eNOS and NO generation. This effect is performed to be NO dependent, because similar BLVRA accumulation in the nucleus was observed after treatment with NO donor, SNP, without BLVRA stimulation. eNOS inhibitor led to decreased BLVRA translocation to the nucleus. Suppression of TLR4 protein was consistent with BLVRA translocation. Thus, splenic inflammatory responses were mediated through the eNOS/NO signaling.",
