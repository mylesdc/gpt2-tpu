            "text": "HMGB1 is a nuclear component involved in nucleosome stabilization and transcription regulation, but extracellularly it is able to serve as a potential late mediator of lethality. In the present study, we explored inflammation-promoting activity of HMGB1 and blockade of extracellular release of HMGB1 by glycyrrhizin (GL) in LPS/GalN-triggered mouse liver injury. At 1 to 10 h after LPS/GalN-treatment, mice were anesthetized to collect blood from heart puncture, and serum transaminase and HMGB1 were evaluated. Administration of LPS/GalN precipitated tissue injury associated with time-dependent alteration in HMGB1 serum levels. At 8 h nuclear immunoreactive products were remarkably reduced and extracellular HMGB1 expression was found exclusively in the pericentral foci. The treatment with GL significantly down-regulated the serum levels of ALT, AST, and HMGB1 in addition to the strong inhibition of tissue injury and extracellular immunoreactivity to HMGB1 and to acetylated-lysine. Furthermore, GL brought about a significant decrease in the number of apoptotic hepatocytes labeled with TUNEL-method. On the basis of these results, three apoptosis-associated genes were identified with microarray analysis and real-time PCR. The ChIP-assay revealed the binding of HMGB1 protein to Gsto1 promoter sequence in LPS/GalN-treated mice and the remarkable decrease in combined HMGB1 protein by GL. The current findings claim that a single injection of LPS/GalN might stimulate apoptosis of hepatocytes through the binding of HMGB1 protein to Gsto1 promoter region and that GL-treatment might prevent the apoptosis and inflammatory infiltrates caused with LPS/ GalN-injection by disturbing the binding of HMGB1 protein to Gsto1 promoter sequence.",

            "text": "High-mobility group proteins (HMGBs) are small DNA-binding proteins that serve an important role in transcriptional regulation [1] . One of these proteins, HMGB1 (amphoterin), has been identified as a late-acting mediator of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)induced or sepsis-induced lethality in mice [2] . In addition to the role of a non-histone nuclear protein, HMGB1 also functions as an inflammatory cytokine when passively released from necrotic cells [3] or actively secreted from stress-received cells such as monocytes/macrophages in response to endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, or interleukin (IL)-1b [2, [4] [5] [6] . Once released into the intravascular space, HMGB1 can potentially amplify local inflammatory responses by enhancing the release of cytokines and chemokines from stressed cells [7] and interact with endothelial cells by up-regulating surface receptors and causing the secretion of soluble pro-inflammatory mediators [8] . Extracellular HMGB1 functions as a damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) molecule and activates pro-inflammatory signaling pathways by enhancing pattern recognition receptors including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) [5, 9] . Mounting evidence suggests that HMGB1 may also function to facilitate the recognition of other immune coactivators such as LPS, DNA, and IL-1 through greedy binding to these molecules [10] [11] [12] .",

We have reported that upon stimulation by LPS activated macrophages secrete various pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-a [15] . Among them, TNF-a is a key mediator causing hepatic apoptosis and necrosis in LPS/ GalN-induced liver failure [16] . The number of apoptotic cells and the levels in serum concentration of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 as well as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) significantly increase after administration of LPS/GalN. However, glycyrrhizin (GL) has no effect on the production of these cytokines whereas it inhibits a significant increase in ALT levels and apoptotic cell numbers [15, 17] .",

The pathways governing HMGB1 release from hepatocytes are known to involve TLR4 activation and calcium signaling through calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) [5] . In other cell types, downstream events governing HMGB1 release have been linked to oxidation/reduction [32] and posttranslational modifications that include phosphorylation [33] and acetylation [34] . However, in LPS/GalN-impaired liver it is unknown if post-translational modifications of HMGB1 regulates its release from hepatocytes. As HMGB1 is released from both stressed and necrotic cells, it might be useful to characterize the cellular expression and bloodstream kinetics of HMGB1 during LPS/GalN-induced liver injury. The purpose of this study is to investigate the post-translational pathway that regulates nuclear shuttling of HMGB1 into the cytoplasm and its subsequent release in the liver intoxicated with LPS/GalN.

Immunohistochemistry with antibodies against HMGB1 revealed a distinct nuclear expression in the hepatocytes of control mice ( Fig. 2A ) and 1-3 h after treatment (Fig. 2B ). At these stages, some cells expressed the weak cytoplasmic immunoreaction for HMGB1, but no deposition of HMGB1 was seen in the extracellular milieu. Immunoreactions for HMGB1 in the nuclei began to be suppressed 6 h after the concomitant administration of LPS/GalN (Fig. 2C) , and at 8 h intranuclear immunoreactive products were remarkably reduced (Fig. 2G) and aberrant, extracellular expression of HMGB1 was demonstrated (Fig. 2D) . At this stage, immunolabeled HMGB1 was restricted to inflammatory pericentral areas. Pronounced cytoplasmic and additional extracellular HMGB1 expression appeared to coincide with the progression of inflamed liver (Figs. 1, 2) . At 10 h a distinct nuclear expression for HMGB1 was again significantly increased in the hepatocytes (Fig. 2G) , although occational hepatocytes remained to express cytoplasmic HMGB1 (Fig. 2E) . GL-treatment strongly inhibited immunoreactive expression of cytoplasmic and additional extracellular HMGB1 (Fig. 2F ) and a decrease in intranuclear immunoreactive products (Fig. 2H) , induced by injection of LPS/GalN.",

Hyperacetylation shifts the equilibrium of HMGB1 from a predominant nuclear location toward cytosolic accumulation and leads to subsequent release [34, 38] . To determine the acetylation status of HMGB1in mouse liver subjected to the concomitant administration of LPS/ GalN, the levels of acetylated HMGB1 were assessed by immunohistochemistry with polyclonal antibodies against acetylated-lysine ( Fig. 3A-H) . A few nuclear immunoreactive products were labeled in the hepatocytes of control mice (Fig. 3A, G) . The liver cells with nuclear immunoreactivity for acetylated-lysine were significantly increased in number 1-3 h after treatment (Fig. 3B , G) and some cells expressed the weak cytoplasmic immunoreaction for acetylated-lysine, but no deposition of acetylated-lysine was seen in the extracellular milieu. After 6 h of the concomitant administration of LPS/GalN, the immunoreactive intensity for acetylated-lysine in the nuclei began to be suppressed and immunolabeled products were extracellularly stained in the pericentral areas (Fig. 3C) . Intranuclear immunoreactive products were remarkably reduced at 8 h (Fig. 3D, G) and aberrant, extracellular acetylated-lysine expression was frequently found (Fig. 3D) . At this stage, immunolabeled acetylated-lysine was exclusively restricted to the inflammatory pericentral areas. Pronounced cytoplasmic and additional extracellular acetylatedlysine expression seems to coincide with both the progression of inflammation in the liver (compare Fig. 3 with Fig. 1 ) and timedependent change in the distributional pattern of immunolabeled HMGB1 (compare Fig. 3 with Fig. 2) . At 10 h a distinct nuclear expression of acetylated-lysine was significantly increased in the liver cells (Fig. 3G) , although some liver cells expressed cytoplasmic acetylated-lysine in the pericental areas (Fig. 3E) . In the liver of mice treated with LPS/GalN, administration of GL remarkably reduced the immunoreactive, cytoplasmic and extracellular response to acetylated-lysine (Fig. 3F) and showed a significant increase in number of nuclear immunoreactive products for acetylated-lysine (Fig. 3H) . These data suggest that the treatment with GL suppressed the translocation of HMGB1 into the extracellular milieu through the blockade of acetylation of HMGB1 and inhibited rapid activation of pro-inflammatory pathways accompanying the LPS-GalN-induced liver injury. However, mechanisms governing the translocation of HMGB1 recognized in the injured liver induced by an injection of LPS/ GalN remain to be unknown.",

The cytoplasmic (Fig. 3I) and nuclear (Fig. 3J) HDAC activity was increased in both liver tissues from animals subjected to LPS/GalN-or GL+LPS/GaIN-treatment compared with baseline animals, but not significant.

To evaluate the involvement of TLR4 and RAGE as the receptor of HMGB1, we measured the kinetics in mRNA levels of these receptors induced by LPS/D-GalN-treatment using real time PCR (Fig. 4) . LPS/GalN induced a significant decrease in mRNA levels of Rage (Fig. 4B) , whereas it significantly stimulated an increase in mRNA of Tlr4 (Fig. 4A ). In addition, an administration of GL did not become responsive to both the Tlr4 and Rage in mice treated with LPS/GalN (Fig. 4A,  B) . Consequently, our findings indicate that LPS/GalN-induced hepatic injury might not be caused by extracellularly released HMGB1 via receptors such as TLR4/RAGE.",

On the contrary, Stc1 expression pattern was up-regulated by LPS/GalN treatment and restored by injection of GL. To validate these results from microarray analysis, we performed semi-quantitative PCR using the cDNA from control, LPS/GalN-injured, and GL+LPS/GalN-treated livers. After an injection of LPS/GalN, the expression levels of Gsto1 and Cyp2d10 mRNAs were significantly decreased to 0.39260.017 and 0.36560.030, respectively. The expression levels of Gsto1 and Cyp2d10 mRNAs were significantly recovered to 0.76160.111 and 0.80560.138, respectively, by administration of GL (Fig. 6B, C) .

On the other hand, the mRNA levels of Pdcd6 were not significantly affected by LPS/GalN-or GL+LPS/GalNtreatment (Fig. 6A ).

            "text": "Mouse liver injury induced by lipopolysaccharide/D-galactosamine (LPS/GalN) is commonly used as a promising animal model for elucidating the mechanism of clinical dysfunction and for evaluating the efficacy of hepatoprotectives [15, 17, 40] . Multiple pathways converge to signal activation of endogenous inflammatory cells within the liver, as well as upregulation of key adhesion molecules and chemokines that mediate migration of inflammatory cells from the periphery into foci of activation and inflammation in the perturbed remnant. Once set in motion, these facets of the immune-inflammatory response join forces to stimulate tissue-destructive pathways and failure of regenerative programs [41] [42] [43] [44] . In this study, we provide the first in vivo evidence showing that HMGB1 is involved in the apoptosis of hepatocytes caused by LPS/GalN-treatment and administration of GL significantly improves hepatic injury, in parallel with suppression of exaggerated apoptotic cell death and enhanced expression of regeneratiom mediator. HMGB1 is a multifunctional protein: its earliest functions were described as a non-histone DNA-binding nuclear protein. HMGB1 binds to DNA in a sequence-independent manner and modifies DNA structure to facilitate transcription, replication, and repair [45, 46] . These functions are essential for survival, as HMGB1-deficient mice die of hypoglycemia within 24 hours after birth [47] . Recently, HMGB1 has been identified as a novel inflammatory cytokine and a late mediator of endotoxin lethality in mice [48] . Extracellular HMGB1 activates a large number of different physiological responses in different cell types [49] . HMGB1 may be released both through active secretion from various cells, including activated monocytes/macrophages [2] , neutrophils [50] , and apoptotic cells [51] , and passively as a danger signal from necrotic cells [3] . Through the TLR4 system, HMGB1 produces an early inflammatory response [4] , leading to amplification of HMGB1 secretion [5] . Active HMGB1 secretion from phagocytes displays delayed kinetics [2, 52, 53] . In the current experimental model, we could recognize the earliest biochemical and histological damage at 6 h stage after LPS/GalN-treatment. Thus, this delayed active HMGB1 release may partly explain some of our findings. The present immunohistochemistry revealed that the intense expression of HMGB1 focused on the inflammatory foci close to the central veins, that is, on the area susceptible to LPS/ GalN-treatment. Although the immunoreactive products of HMGB1 reached a maximum by 8 h, levels of HMGB1 in the serum were maximal at 10 h. Increase in the serum levels of HMGB1 seems to occur a little later than pathological damages in liver tissue induced with LPS/GalN-treatment. Thus, the observed efflux of HMGB1 appears to derive mainly from injured hepatic tissues. These results are identical with data obtained from patients with acute liver failure [54] . During LPS/GalN-induced liver injury, HMGB1 kinetics is distinct from that of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 obtained in our previous study [15] . This is in line with other previous works failing to find an association between HMGB1 and various cytokines (TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-10) [6, 55] and might reflect the complexity of inflammatory response in the clinical setting.",

            "text": "The role of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its ligands in maintaining and amplifying inflammation has been recently highlighted [56] . RAGE, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, interacts with ligands enriched in flamed milieu, includimg (carboxymethyl)lysine-modified adducts and S100/calgranulins, the latter members of a family of proinflammatory cytokines [57, 58] . Blockade of RAGE, employing soluble RAGE (sRAGE), the extracellular ligand-binding domain of RAGE, suppresses injury in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion [59] , as well as the induction of collagen-induced arthritis in mice sensitized to and challenged with bovine type II collagen [60] . In this study, however, the expression levels of Rage mRNA were conversely decreased by administration of LPS/GalN and GLtreatment did not exert any influence on its expression. In contrast, the expression levels of Tlr4 mRNA were significantly increased in LPS/GalN-induced hepatic injury as compared with the control, but GL did not inhibit it. GL binds directly to each of two HMG boxes of HMGB1, as shown by NMR and fluorescence studies [30] . The modest effect of GL on the intranuclear function of HMGB1 is agreement with the absence of cytotoxicity even at high GL concentrations and with the good pharmacological tolerability of GL in rodents and humans [61] . Interestingly, administration of GL does not cause the release of HMGB1 from apoptotic chromatin, implying that it will not produce paradoxical inflammatory responses to apoptotic cells [30] . The current results suggest that the effective mechanisms of GL are down-stream of initial TLR activation in the injured liver induced by LPS/GalN injection.",

In the present study, the doubleimmunofluorescence analysis for HMGB1/F4/80 or HMGB1/ CD11c revealed that activated macrophages and dendritic cells expressed HMGB1 in their cytoplasm in the LPS/GalN-induced hepatic injury, respectively. HMGB1 in monocytes and macrophages is extensively acetylated upon activation by LPS, causing localization of the protein to the cytosol [34] . Cytosolic HMGB1 is then concentrated into secretory lysosomes and secreted when the cells received an appropriate second signal [63] . The movement of HMGB1 into the extracellular space has been demonstrated for macrophages stimulated with LPS [34, 49, 64] as well as cells undergoing necrosis [3, 65] or apoptosis [51] . In our previous paper [17] , analyses using TUNEL-method, an oligonucleosomebound DNA ELISA, and microdissection-method showed that the degree of hepatic injury is associated with a substantial number of cells undergoing apoptosis in acute hepatitis induced with a single injection of LPS/GalN. GL-treatment suppressed the apoptosis of liver cells induced by LPS in D-GalN-sensitized mice. The role of HMGB1 in the precise mechanism of apoptotic cell death of hepatocytes in this experimental hepatitis remains to be unknown but is assumed to be implicated in the signal pathways regulating apoptosis [66, 67] .",

            "text": "To assess the acetylation of HMGB1 in the inflammatory hepatic specimens, we conducted the immunohistochemical analysis using the antibody to acetylated-lysine. This analysis revealed a few nuclear immunoreactive products in the hepatic cells of control mice. The hepatocytes with nuclear immunoreaction for acetylated-lysine were increased in number 1-3 h after the concomitant administration of LPS/GalN, but they were decreased at 6-8 h. At 8 h, aberrant, extracellular acetylated-lysine expression was labeled and mainly restricted to pericentral inflammatory areas. At 10 h a distinct nuclear expression for acetylated-lysine was again increased in the hepatic cells, although some hepatocytes remained to express cytoplasmic acetylatedlysine in the pericentral areas. Administration of GL strongly inhibited the immunoreaction of acetylated-lysine in the LPS/ GalN-induced liver injury. Immunohistochemical analysis for acetylated-lysine used in this experiment shows that administration of GL may inhibit acetylation of lysine in HMGB1 in the liver remnants of the LPS/GalN-induced mice. The ability of GL to suppress ALT levels is observed when administered at 30nmin before or at 10 min and 60 min after LPS/GalN, but GLtreatment has little effect on ALT levels when administered 3 h after LPS/GalN injection [15] . Thus, inhibitory effect of GL on LPS/GalN-induced liver injury might be due to binding directly to HMGB1 [30] before its acetylation. Acetylated HMGB1 has been shown to be involved in regulating HMGB1 DNA binding properties along with its subcellular location [68] . In vitro experiments have shown that lysine residues of HMGB1 between 27 and 43 represent functional nuclear localizing signals in macrophages [34] . Also, recent mutation analysis for the abilities of HMGB1 protein to bind and bend DNA has reported the role of lysines 2 and 81 as target sites for acetylation in full-length HMGB1 and truncated tail-less protein, respectively [69] . Serum HMGB1 released following liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in vivo is acetylated and hepatocytes exposed to oxidative stress in vitro also release acetylated HMGB1 [38] . Levels of acetylated HMGB1 increase with a concomitant decrease in total nuclear histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, suggesting that suppression in HDAC activity contributes to the increase in acetylated HMGB1 release after oxidative stress in hepatocytes. In their study, the isoforms HDAC1 and HDAC4 were demonstrated as critical in regulating acetylated HMGB1 release. Activation of HDAC1 is decreased in the nucleus of hepatocytes undergoing oxidative stress. In addition, HDAC1 knockdown with siRNA promotes HMGB1 translocation and release. Furthermore, HDAC4 is shuttled from the nucleus to cytoplasm in response to oxidative stress, resulting in decreased HDAC activity in the nucleus. On the contrary, in the present experiment we did not find a decrease in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear HDAC activities after injection of LPS/GalN. In addition, administration of GL did not induce a significant increase of nuclear HDAC activity. Phosphorylation of HMGB1 is another regulatory mechanism that influences its subcellular location [33] . Recently, it was shown that HMGB1 phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin protein kinase IV caused nuclear-to-cytoplasmic shuttling and release in LPS-stimulated macrophages [70] .",

            "text": "Damaged cells activate innate immunity and recruit inflammatory cells by collectively releasing danger signals known as the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). One such molecule is HMGB1, which has been implicated as an early mediator of organ damage in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and hemorrhagic shock, as well as a late mediator of lethality in endotoxic shock [2, 4] . In most cases the cells actively secreting HMGB1 appear to be immune cells such as macrophages, natural killer cells [71] , and dendritic cells [63] . However, it is becoming increasingly clear that non-immune parenchymal cells also participate in active HMGB1 secretion [72] . It has also been shown that neutralizing antibodies to HMGB1 amelliorate liver I/ R injury, thereby suggesting a therapeutic benefit of blocking active HMGB1 release to minimize I/R-associated damage. In contrast, our preliminary work presented the results that the intravenous injection of HMGB1 (500 ng/mouse) 6 hours after LPS/GalN-treatment or HMGB1 alone did not precipitate ALT/ AST activity (Fig. S2) . Furthermore, the intravenous injection of neutralizing antibodies to HMGB1 (2 mg/kg) did not ameliorate an increase in serum ALT/AST activity in LPS/GalN-injured mice (Fig. S3 ). In addition to these findings, the expression levels of Tlr4 mRNA in LPS/GalN-induced hepatic injury were significantly increased compared to the control, but those of Rage mRNA conversely decreased in this hepatic injury. Considering together with these data, acute hepatic injury stimulated by a single injection of LPS/GalN might not be caused by HMGB1 released into the extracellular milieu from non-hematopoietic cells (hepatocytes) or activated macrophages/dendritic cells. In the current investigation, numerous apoptotic cells were observed in the pericentral areas of LPS/GalN-treated liver. To understand mechanisms of hepatocyte apoptosis promoted in the LPS/GalN-induced hepatic injury, we explored the fluctuation in the expression of genes associated with the regulation of apoptotic cell death using the gene microarray analysis (Fig. S1 ). In this study, the clinical syndrome observed in LPS/GalN-treated animals, associated with diffuse hepatocyte apoptosis, was prevented by administration of GL. On the base of the results obtained from microarray analysis, furthermore, the expression patterns of 4 genes, Pdcd6, Gsto1, Cyp2d10, and Stc1, influenced by injecting LPS/GaIN or LPS/GaIN with GL were examined by quantitative PCR using the cDNA from control, LPS/GaINinjected, and GL+LPS/GaIN-treated liver remnants. To examine the binding of HMGB1 protein to these genes, we performed analysis with ChIP assay and revealed that HMGB1 protein intensely bound to Gsto1 promoter sequence in LPS/GaINinjected liver injury but could not detect a combination of HMGB1 with the promoter sequence of other genes. Furthermore, an administration of GL strongly inhibited the binding of HMGB1 to Gsto1 promoter sequence. GSTs (glutachione transferase) are a superfamily of ubiquitous intracellular enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to a wide range of exogenous and endogenous compounds, including chemical carcinogens, therapeutic drugs and oxidative stress products. New members of the GST structural family with novel catalytic activities and functions have recently been discovered [73, 74] . Mouse GSTO1 was indeed identified because of its overexpression in a mouse lymphoma cell line presenting with resistance against a variety of chemo-therapeutics [75] . After transfection with Gsto1 siRNA, transfected HeLa cells present with a marked increase of apoptosis as compared with controls [76] , suggesting that GSTO1 plays an anti-apoptotic role. GSTO1 overexpression is associated with activation of survival pathways including Akt kinase (cell survival factor) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/ 2 (cell survival and proliferation factor) and anti-apoptotic pathways of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1 (apoptosis blockade factor). Immunohistochemistry of LPS-treated liver remnants showed the remarkable decrease of nuclear reactivity and sparse reactivity of cytoplasm with the antibody to activated p65 at 8 or 10 h compared with controls or GL-treated remnants (Fig. S4) . Although the activation of NF-kB is associated with potent inflammatory responses in hepatic injury, key roles for this factor in inhibition of apoptosis in the liver have been also demonstrated definitively experimentally [77, 78] . In conclusion, in mouse liver injury induced by a single injection of LPS/GalN, HMGB1 protein appears to be implicated in the (direct and/or indirect) inhibition of a signal pathway associated with anti-apoptosis, i.e. down-regulation of GSTO1, and to stimulate apoptosis of hepatocytes rather than to act as pro-inflammatory factors in this experimental model. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that additional LPS-treatment induces release of HMGB1 into extracellular milieu and precipitates hepatic inflammation through the receptors of TLR4 and/or RAGE. In addition to the role of GL disclosed in this study, it has been reported that GL treatment inhibits the proliferation and migration of cells stimulated by HMGB1 cytokine, as well as HMGB1-induced formation of blood vessels and reduces inflammatory condition [31] . Figure S1 Gene microarray analysis. A microarray analysis shows that the expression patterns of 4 genes, Pdcd6, Gsto1, Cyp2d10, and Stc1, are influenced by injecting LPS/GaIN or LPS/ GalN with GL. (TIF) Figure S2 Serum ALT/AST levels after an injection of HMGB1. An intravenous injection of HMGB1 (500 ng/mouse) alone does not stimulate ALT/AST activity compared with the control. The serum ALT/AST activity is hardly affected compared to LPS/GalN-treatment alone, when HMGB1 (500 ng/mouse) is intravenously injected 6 h after LPS/GalNtreatment. (TIF) Figure S3 Effect of antibodies to HMGB1 on mice treated with LPS/GalN. When neutralizing antibodies (2 mg/kg) to HMGB1 are intravenously injected 5.5 h after LPS/GalN-treatment, they do not ameliorate an increase in serum ALT/AST activity induced in LPS/GalN-treated liver injury. (TIF) Figure S4 Expression pattern of NF-kB in LPS/GalN-treated mice. Immunohistochemical assessment of LPS/GalN-treatment on the activation of NF-kB in the liver remnants at 0 (a), 3 (b), 6 (c), 8 (d), and 10 hours (e) after injury and of the inhibitory effects by an administration of GL. At 3 h after LPS-treatment, the stronger nuclear immunoreaction is labeled compared with controls using an antibody against activated p65 (b), but its nuclear immunoreaction is gradually reduced in time-dependent manner (c, d). Immunohistochemistry for activated p65 shows an increase of nuclear reactivity in GL-treated remnants (f). CV: central vein. Bars = 200 mm. (TIF)",
