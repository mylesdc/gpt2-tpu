            "text": "Building of the medieval trading and pilgrimage network. Several main commercial confederations were active during Late Middle Ages. One of the most active one was the Silk Road, a trading and cultural network spanning along the Asian continent and connecting the Far East and the Mediterranean Sea. In the southern part of Europe there were two trade routes connecting by sea and land Genoa and Venetia with many other cities in the Mediterranean, Northern Africa, Near East, Asia and central Europe. In northern Europe the Hanseatic League connected many ports around the Baltic Sea with cities from North and North--East Europe. Some other minor commercial routes like English Wool Market, Spanish Wine Market or North--African Slave trades were also present at that time. Besides these trading routes, Europe also held some important pilgrimage routes, outstanding the Way of St. James, which connected Santiago de Compostela in Spain with many places in Central and Western Europe, the Via Francigena, which run from Rome to France, although reached places as far as Canterbury in England and the North--African Islamic routes that connected muslim cities with La Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula. To build the medieval trading and pilgrimage networks, we obtained the medieval routes from the Old World Trade Routes Project, OWTRAD 34 . This project provides electronic archives of geo/chrono--referenced data on terrestrial and maritime trade and pilgrimage and trade routes of Eurasia and Africa from 4000 BCE to 1800 CE. We selected those files describing the routes during the XII and XIII centuries CE. In total, we found 22 files with information about routes working during the Black Death period (Supplementary Table S5 online) Using this information, we built up a network that connected Eurasian and African medieval cities sharing trading or pilgrimage routes. This network was built by pooling the information from the 22 files. Because the traffic may occurs in both directions, our network was undirected. Some pair of cities were connected both by trading and pilgrimage routes. However, because information on traffic density is unavailable for the fourteenth century, the original network was unweighted and all connections between pair of cities had the same value = 1. Nevertheless, in order to explore whether trading and pilgrimage activities differed in their effect on plague--mediated mortality, we divided this overall network into two networks, one including only trading links (trading network, hereafter) and the other including only pilgrimage connections (pilgrimage network). For this, we followed the classification of the routes made by the OWTRAD project 34 .",

Because a city can be repeatedly infected without recovering from the diseases, we simplified the above equations by considering g = 0. We did this simplification because a city usually contains both infected and susceptible individuals. If this occurs, the city is considered to be infected although some individuals are susceptible. Under a scenario of re--infection, susceptible individuals can be infected before the recovery of the other individuals in the city. Nevertheless, it would be convenient in the future to test the response of the model to more complex scenarios, like for example, modelling the proportion of the population that is infected within cities. According to this model, every individual from the population will be eventually infected.

Rather, the transmission of the diseases is given by the contact network among cities. The probability of a city of becoming infected depends thus on the number of infected cities contacting with the focal city multiplied by the transmission rate of the disease. We included this constraint in our modelling approach by considering as contact network the empirical medieval network depicting trade and pilgrimage routes. Using SI epidemic models, we simulated the spreading of the Black Death along the medieval network. Because no accurate information exists on the transmission rate of the Black Death, we repeated the diffusion of the disease in several infectivity scenarios ranging between transmission rate of 0.05 (very low infectivity rate) to 0.95 (very high infectivity rate). We did 1000 simulations for each infectivity scenario. The epidemic was started in all simulations from central Asian cities. We obtained the number of times a given city was infected during each simulation. Afterward, using the same statistical models explained in the previous section, we tested whether the number of infections was related to the centrality and transitivity of the cities.
