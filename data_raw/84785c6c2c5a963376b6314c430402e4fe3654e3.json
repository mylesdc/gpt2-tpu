            "text": "Japanese encephalitis is a zoonotic disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). It is mainly epidemic in Asia with an estimated 69,000 cases occurring per year. However, no approved agents are available for the treatment of JEV infection, and existing vaccines cannot control various types of JEV strains. Drug repurposing is a new concept for finding new indication of existing drugs, and, recently, the concept has been used to discover new antiviral agents. Identifying host proteins involved in the progress of JEV infection and using these proteins as targets are the center of drug repurposing for JEV infection. In this study, based on the gene expression data of JEV infection and the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) data, we identified 286 genes that participate in the progress of JEV infection using systems biology methods. The enrichment analysis of these genes suggested that the genes identified by our methods were predominantly related to viral infection pathways and immune response-related pathways. We found that bortezomib, which can target these genes, may have an effect on the treatment of JEV infection. Subsequently, we evaluated the antiviral activity of bortezomib using a JEV-infected mouse model. The results showed that bortezomib can lower JEV-induced lethality in mice, alleviate suffering in JEV-infected mice and reduce the damage in brains caused by JEV infection. This work provides an agent with new indication to treat JEV infection.",

With its epidemic area expansion, JEV affects approximately 25 countries in Asia, and approximately 60% of the population lives with a risk of JEV infection [2] . At present, vaccination is the most effective way to prevent JEV infection. The common vaccines include the inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccine (JE-VAX), inactivated BHK-21 cell-derived vaccine, live-attenuated vaccine (SA14-14-2), inactivated Vero cell-derived vaccine, and the chimeric attenuated vaccine [5] . However, approximately 80% cases of the JEV infection occur in areas covered by the JEV vaccination program due to the failures of immunization strategies or the limitation of vaccines themselves [1] . To date, no clinically approved antiviral agents have been available for the treatment of JEV infection. Furthermore, few randomized clinical trials have tested treatments for JEV. In the past 30 years, only six agents for the treatment of JEV infection have been tested by clinical trials, but none of them have been found effective [1] . Therefore, it is essential and urgent to find a safe and effective treatment.",

            "text": "Drug repurposing has recently become a very popular method for drug discovery; drug repurposing provides old drugs (including approved drugs, under research drugs, and withdrawn drugs) with new indications by exploring new molecular pathways and targets [6, 7] . With this strategy, finding an alternative agent to treatment JEV infection will be fast and safe. During the past decades, the traditional method for drug repurposing depends on high-throughput screening of small-molecule libraries consisting of approved and developing drugs [8]. However, the success rate of high-throughput screening for effective repurposed drugs has dropped dramatically [9] . With the development of computational methods, the high-throughput omics data, virtual screening, and text mining have been used for drug repurposing [9,10]. One of the computational methods for antiviral drug repurposing is to target pathogen to block its lifecycle. Using the crystal structure of the E protein and the strategy of structural-based virtual screening (SBVS), Leal et al. identified a compound exhibiting marked antiviral activity against DENV with its EC50 being 3.1 \u00b5M [11] . The other methods for antiviral drug repurposing are targeting host genes to inhibit pathogen infection. Identifying the proteins participating in the pathogen infection process is the basis of host-targeted drug repurposing approaches [9] . Quan et al. identified 170 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection-associated genes by theoretical genetic analysis, and obtained high potential anti-Mtb drugs by targeting these genes [12] . Therefore, it is possible to rapidly identify effective therapeutics for JEV infection using the method of drug repurposing through targeting JEV-susceptible genes.",

Additionally, we analyzed Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) athway enrichment of these genes to validate our results. Using the information of the drug-target, we obtained the agents that have a potential treatment effect on JEV infection. We found that multiple targets of bortezomib play critical roles in the progress of JEV infection based on the analysis of the PheWAS data of encephalitis and of the gene expression data of human microglial cells after JEV infection. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of bortezomib using a JEV-infected mouse model. Overall, our research provided a novel agent for the treatment of JEV infection.",

It can take advantage of the biological network to identify key genes associated with diseases, regardless of whether their expression is altered significantly or not. To find the genes associated with JEV infection, we ranked genes with the GeneRank algorithm. Taking the absolute value of fold change as the initial importance of a gene, we obtained the order of functional genes participating in JEV infection. According to the result calculated by GeneRank, we defined the top 1% genes as significant genes involved in the JEV infection process (Table S1 ). As indicated in Table S1 , several genes have been reported to affect the process of JEV infection. For example, the expression of the 2',5'oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) family (OAS1, OAS2 and OASL) inhibited the replication of JEV in PK-15 cells in one previous study [18] . The members of the tripartite-motif containing (TRIM) protein were reported to be a negative regulator of IFN-\u03b2 during JEV infection and to inhibit JEV replication by degrading the viral protein in some other studies [19, 20] . The results suggested that the genes identified by the GeneRank algorithm may play critical roles in the lifecycle of JEV.",

According to the SNP-to-gene mapping method, we mapped the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) data to genes to identify potential genes associated with encephalitis, which exhibits similar symptoms to those of JEV infection [39, 40] . To recognize the gene-interaction networks related to encephalitis, we used the p-values derived from PheWAS data and the HotNet2 algorithm to calculate the subnetwork. We obtained 16 subnetworks that involved 64 genes associated with encephalitis (Table S3 ). It should be noted that four genes among the three subnetworks belong to the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (Figure 4 ), which agrees with the results that encephalitis-related viruses, including JEV, West Nile Virus (WNV), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), could utilize the UPS to promote viral entry, replication, and release [41] [42] [43] . In addition, the proteins (TAP1, TAP2, TAPBP) interacting with PSMB8 and PSMB9 belong to antigen-loading components that were important in the antiviral innate immune response [44] . The protein ADAR in the subnetwork was reported to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication through eliminating HCV RNA by adenosine to inosine editing [45] . These results confirmed that the genes identified by the HotNet2 algorithm were important in JEV infection. subnetworks with high biological relevance, and can be sensitive to both real and simulated data, it was used to find significant subnetworks associated with various diseases [16] .",

According to the SNP-to-gene mapping method, we mapped the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) data to genes to identify potential genes associated with encephalitis, which exhibits similar symptoms to those of JEV infection [39, 40] . To recognize the gene-interaction networks related to encephalitis, we used the P-values derived from PheWAS data and the HotNet2 algorithm to calculate the subnetwork. We obtained 16 subnetworks that involved 64 genes associated with encephalitis (Table  S3 ). It should be noted that four genes among the three subnetworks belong to the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (Figure 4 ), which agrees with the results that encephalitis-related viruses, including JEV, West Nile Virus (WNV), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), could utilize the UPS to promote viral entry, replication, and release [41] [42] [43] . In addition, the proteins (TAP1, TAP2, TAPBP) interacting with PSMB8 and PSMB9 belong to antigen-loading components that were important in the antiviral innate immune response [44] . The protein ADAR in the subnetwork was reported to inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication through eliminating HCV RNA by adenosine to inosine editing [45] . These results confirmed that the genes identified by the HotNet2 algorithm were important in JEV infection. ",

We combined the gene expression data with the protein-protein interaction (PPI) database to rank JEV infection-related genes that could be used as the targets to find new antiviral agents. The results showed that host proteins involved in JEV infection include viral infection pathways and immune response-related pathways, which was consistent with the infection mechanism of JEV. Afterwards, we found that bortezomib might be a potential agent for the treatment of JEV infection by targeting these genes. In addition, we identified genetic interaction networks related to encephalitis by the HotNet2 algorithm. Using these genes as the targets to screen drugs, we also found that bortezomib could be used for JEV treatment.",
