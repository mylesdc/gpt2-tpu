We compared these signatures by their capacity to segregate biological conditions by pathogenicity and predict pathogenicity in a test data set. The highest-performing signature was expressed as a continuum in low-, medium-, and high-pathogenicity samples, suggesting a direct, analog relationship between expression and pathogenicity. This signature comprised 57 genes including a subnetwork of chemokines, implicating dysregulated cell recruitment in injury. Conclusions: Highly pathogenic viruses elicit expression of many of the same key genes as lower pathogenic viruses but to a higher degree. This increased degree of expression may result in the uncontrolled co-localization of inflammatory cell types and lead to irreversible host damage.",

Deriving gene expression signatures of high pathogenicity that are robust to biological and experimental variation would be immensely valuable, both in the understanding of pathogenicity as well as in the surveillance of emerging infections. We define a signature as the minimum number of biological variables (here, expressed genes) required to (a) discriminate the phenotype of interest from other phenotypes, (b) identify replicates of the same phenotype, and (c) provide cohesive information about the underlying biological complexity [6] . However, the derivation of gene expression signatures from multiple, independent studies is hindered by a number of factors including the absence of standard experimental protocols, biological variability, and limited sample sizes.

Using these techniques we identified signatures of either a digital nature (oppositely expressed in LPIs and HPIs with respect to mock infections) or an analog nature (expressed in a continuum from LPIs to HPIs). We then compared these signatures on the basis of their capacity to predict the outcome of an independent transcriptome experiment.

This suggested that gene signatures could be identified on the basis of opposite directionality with respect to mock infections.

            "text": "We initially compared the signatures on the basis of their capacity to structure the biological conditions in the compendium. The expression of each signature set of genes was analyzed by principal components analysis (PCA), and the degree to which LPI-, MPI-, and HPIassociated conditions clustered proximally to conditions of the same pathogenicity and distally from conditions of other pathogenicities was compared. We also compared the ordering and overall separation of the pathogenicity clusters, both by visual inspection and by percentage variance explained. We reasoned that a more effective signature would result in greater separation of pathogenicities oriented along a dimension that also explained a higher proportion of the total variance [7] . Using all the genes in the compendium as input for PCA (i.e., no signatures), the native compendium showed little apparent structure ( Figure 2A ). Conditions did not discretely cluster by pathogenicity, nor did pathogenicities separate along either first or second principal components (PC1 or PC2, respectively). Using the digital gene signatures, more structure became apparent ( Figure 2B , C Pre-processing, QC, conversion to gene-level data Figure 1 Meta-analysis workflow. Briefly the compendium was assembled from multiple microarray data sets and either separated into intensity-level measurements or converted to log-ratios of measurements in infected samples to their respective mock infections. Different meta-analysis methods were applied and resulted in two classes of signatures. Various criteria were used to evaluate signatures. \"INF\" refers to infected samples, \"CTR\" to matching mock-infected control samples, \"PCA\" to principal components analysis, and \"PCCS\" to Pearson correlation coefficient scatter plot. signatures, respectively; x-axis in Figure 2B , C). However, the highest degree of clustering and separation was obtained using the analog signature. Conditions clustered more tightly by pathogenicity (particularly in the case of HPI) using this signature than other signatures, and PC1 accounted for a greater proportion of the total variance, 18% ( Figure 2D ). PCA therefore indicated that the analog signature resulted in the most effective discrimination of host profiles by pathogenicity. We note that the relatively low amount of variance explained by PC1 in the case of each signature was consistent with the presence of significant heterogeneity in the compendium. This heterogeneity may be attributable to a number of different factors including the variety of viruses, times post-infection, mouse strains, laboratories, and technical platforms represented in the compendium. Therefore, we compared signatures on the basis of the relative increases in variance explained by PC1 which aligned with pathogenicity in each case.",

We reasoned that a more effective signature would result in stronger correlations (higher Pearson correlation coefficients, or PCCs) among similar pathogenicities and weaker correlations (lower PCCs) among dissimilar pathogenicities. On a scatter plot of PCCs to exemplar LPI and HPI profiles, more samples would appear in two quadrants, with more LPI samples in quadrant II (LPI-high/HPIlow) and more HPI samples in quadrant IV (LPI-low/ HPI-high) where quadrants are defined by an equal partitioning of the PCC scatter plot plane at (0.5, 0.5). Using all of the genes in the native compendium, LPI and HPI samples appeared primarily in one quadrant, high for both LPI and HPI ( Figure 3A ). This indicated that LPI and HPI transcriptional profiles were correlated overall (for the majority of genes) and that LPI and HPI samples separated poorly from each other on the basis of overall transcriptional profiles. Digital gene signatures resulted in improved segregation of samples by pathogenicity, as indicated by increased numbers of LPI and HPI samples in quadrants II and IV, respectively (white regions in Figure 3B , C). However, the analog signature resulted in the largest overall segregation of biological samples, with the highest number of LPI and HPI samples appearing in opposite quadrants ( Figure 3D ).

Specifically we utilized a microarray data set measuring transcription in the lungs of mice infected with either swine-origin influenza A virus (SOIV) subtype H1N1 strain CA/04 (non-lethal in mice) or the mouse-adapted variant MA1 CA/04 (lethal in mice) at days 1, 3, and 5 post-infection (Josset et al., in preparation). PCC scatter plots were generated using the test set samples and the same LPI and HPI exemplars as above (in Figure 3) . We again reasoned that the most effective gene signature would yield the best opposite-quadrant separation of LPI and HPI samples. Comparing the better-scoring digital signature (i.e., generated by Fisher's statistic) and the analog signature, we found that the analog signature yielded the best segregation of test set samples ( Figure  4 ). In particular samples from the lethal variant MA1 CA/04 correlated strongly with the exemplar HPI, indicating that this and other HPIs resulted in similar transcriptional profiles for these genes ( Figure 4C ). Counting the number of LPI and HPI test set samples appearing in quadrants II and IV, respectively, and considering these as correctly predicted, we found that the analog signature resulted in an accuracy rate of ",

Assuming an equal distribution of genes among pathogenicity groups, we expected 33% to display one of these two patterns by chance. By comparison we observed that 43% of all genes in the compendium displayed these patterns ( Figure 5B ). However, an even greater proportion of analog signature genes displayed these patterns, 81%, consistent with a correlation between expression and pathogenicity ( Figure  5C ).

These conditions were in turn intermediate to extrema from other HPI and LPI conditions (i.e., early LPI and late HPI conditions).

A number of these have focused on respiratory viruses including several which resulted in lethality in experimental animal models. What distinguished these infections from others where experimental animals recovered was the subject of our analysis. To this end we assembled a compendium of transcriptome measurements from the lungs of mice and used meta-analysis to determine gene signatures that distinguished high-from low-pathogenicity infections. To our knowledge ours is the first meta-analysis study to focus on high-pathogenicity infections (HPIs). Previous studies have applied meta-analysis to infection data but focused on more general features of disease. For example, Jenner and Young analyzed the transcriptomes of various host species (mice, macaques, and humans) infected by bacteria or viruses and identified a signature of approximately 500 genes [8] . This signature showed that TLRs and pathogen-mediated signalling were broadly activated during infection but did not identify features resulting in animal lethality. Likewise Pennings et al. examined the transcriptional profiles of lung inflammation (in mice and macaques) due to various factors (including viruses, bacteria, chemicals, and allergens) and derived a 383gene signature up-regulated during inflammation [9] . This signature focused on the interferon response and immune signalling, but likewise no correlate of pathogenicity was identified. In addition both studies relied mainly on hierarchical clustering to determine signatures of interest. While hierarchical clustering provides a useful overview of high-dimensional data, it has the disadvantage of lacking a strong statistical basis (i.e., hypothesis testing) and its results (gene clusters) can be difficult to relate to specific outcomes. In contrast to previous studies, our goal was to determine a gene signature specific for HPIs. We therefore applied an ensemble of meta-analysis methods and derived multiple signatures which we compared by multiple criteria including the capacity to predict the outcome of a test data set. Each method had a different statistical rationale and could be expected to identify different features of the compendium. We had no a priori expectation of which signature would produce the best outcome in terms of these criteria.",

However, the analog signature displayed additional coherence, encoding multiple chemokines for the same receptor, namely MIG (CXCL9), IP-10 (CXCL10), and I-TAC (CXCL11) which all serve as ligands for the receptor CXCR3 [13] . CXCR3 is expressed on the surface of Th1 cells as well as NK and NKT cells and regulates the migration of these cells to sites of infection. Recent evidence indicates that CXCR3 engagement may drive further recruitment and inflammation, resulting in a positive feedback loop that may contribute to pathogenicity [13] . The analog signature also included genes for chemokines that bind the CCR3 receptor, specifically MCP-3 (CCL7) and MCP-4 (CCL13). CCR3 is the major receptor expressed on eosinophils and has previously been shown to have a role in the promotion of lung inflammation [14] . Interestingly CXCR3 ligands have been postulated to be antagonists for CCR3 [15] , and the expression of both sets of chemokines may reflect a high degree of dysregulation during HPIs and the recruitment of multiple immune cell types that may not normally co-localize during a controlled infection.",

Interestingly many secretoglobins are expressed specifically in the lung epithelium and may contribute to lung repair following damage [19, 20] . For example, uteroglobin/ CC16 (SCGB1A1) is secreted by bronchiolar Clara cells and postulated to have a role in reducing airway inflammation, though its exact function remains to be elucidated [21] .",

Altering the outcome of infection may not require opposite regulation to be achieved in particular pathways; instead, adequate tempering or delay of those pathways may be sufficient.

We also required that raw data be measured on whole-genome array platforms. Data were sourced from either in-house or external studies (Table 1 ). In the latter case, data were downloaded from public repositories or obtained directly from study authors. Pathogenicities of the corresponding experiments were determined by examination of the published outcome data (e.g., mortality or morbidity data or in cases of LPIs, statements attesting to the survival or recovery of all animal subjects). We defined HPIs as experiments resulting in 0% survival, LPIs as experiments resulting in 100% survival, and MPIs as experiments resulting in intermediate levels of survival (between 0% and 100%, non-inclusive).

Probes with present flags in all of the technical replicates for at least one biological condition in a given study were retained in the data set for that study. For ratio-based meta-analysis, two-channel data were reformatted as log 2 -ratios (infected/mock-infected), and onechannel data were converted to a two-channel-like format where mock-infection intensities were averaged prior to ratio. For meta-analysis based on direct comparison of intensities, two-channel data were separated into individual channels, and inter-array normalization was performed using NeONORM [23] . Additional data preparation involved converting probe-to gene-level data. Measurements for probes mapping to multiple genes were duplicated for each gene, and probes mapping to the same gene were averaged. RefSeq IDs were chosen as the common gene identifier. Probes not mapping to RefSeq IDs were excluded. Biological and technical replicates were averaged for the intensity-based approaches. Log-ratio measurements from all studies were combined resulting in measurements for 27,567 genes by 397 biological conditions. All data-handling tasks were performed using custom scripts in Perl.",

Specifically log-ratio measurements for each array were re-normalized by dividing by the standard deviation of the array, and one-sided t-tests were used to identify genes up-and down-regulated relative to mock infection, i.e., for the null hypotheses H 0 : log 2 (infected/mock) \u2264 0 and H 0 : log 2 (infected/ mock) \u2265 0, respectively. p-values for each directionality (up-or down-regulation) and pathogenicity (HPI or LPI) were combined according to Fisher's summary statistic S = -2 \u2211 log p [26] . The significance of S was determined by a permutation test whereby p-values were shuffled 1000 times among biological conditions, S was re-derived each time, and the resulting S values constituted the null distribution. An FDR-corrected pvalue of 0.05 was used as a threshold for significance. Genes that were found to be both up-and down-regulated for a given pathogenicity (HPI or LPI) were excluded from further analysis. The signature comprised genes found to be oppositely regulated in HPI and LPI.",
