However, the effects of Z-FA-FMK on these specific proteases were not examined or discussed. Figure 8A , this figure is difficult to understand. The author should clearly explain the results. 5., In Figure 8 and 9, mitochondria transport and neuron degeneration were examined to confirm the functional relevance of SMN protein stabilization mediated by Z-FA-FMK. Ideally, neuronal activities should be examined to eventually confirm the functional relevance, or the author should discuss about this. 6. In Figure 9A and B, although there was a decrease in ISI1+ motor neurons in SMA+DMSO group, the proportion of DAPI+ nuclei looks similar (i.e. similar numbers of total cells were still growing in each condition). How do the authors address the effects of differentiation variations/motor neuron purity among different groups in their quantification? Similar issue is for Figure 10C and D. 9. In Figure 9C , the author may also enlarge part of the figure to better display the axon swelling and breakdown. 10, In Figure 10C and D, there is no WT control. Besides, if there is no DAPI staining for total nuclei, how did the aut hor quant ify the percent age of posit ive cells ( Figure 10D )?",

Instead, we have examined two major families of cysteine proteinases and studied their effects systematically from multiple angles. We first performed a screen for these proteases using RNAi (Fig. 7) , then evaluated the candidates using co-Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot to exam their binding with SMN isoforms (Fig. 7) , and finally examined the degradation of SMN proteins after overexpression of cysteine proteases using inducible Myc-SMN2a and SMN2d ( Fig. 7; Fig. S7 ). Our data showed that both non-lysosomal (i.e. Calpain 1/7) and lysosomal cysteine proteases (e.g. CTSL/CTSB) can degrade SMN-full length and SMN-\u03947. These data are significant because except Calpain 1, the role of Calpain2/CTSL/CTSB in degrading SMN proteins have not been reported. Moreover, cathepsins (CTSB/CTSL) belong to lysosomal cysteine protease and lysosome dysfunction has been implicated in many neurological diseases. Thus, we demonstrate that SMN proteins can be degraded by both non-lysosomal and lysosomal cysteine proteases (through either direct binding or other mechanisms including lysosomal-mediated pathway), providing novel targets for regulating SMN proteins.

            "text": "Since E64d can pass BBB and is easy to be administered to neonatal mice, this drug was injected into SMA mice daily (every day starting from day 1). This may be why E64d showed a stronger effect than Z-FA-FMK in long-term and significantly increased in the life span of SMA mice. Nevertheless, Z-FA-FMK which is only treated for 3 days, showed a trend in increasing the life span of SMA mice. Both Z-FA-FMK and E64d significantly increase the proportion of spinal motor neurons in spinal cord section at day 6 in SMA mice (Fig. 10) . These data together demonstrate the effectiveness of candidate compounds in vivo and suggest a novel approach to treat SMA through targeting cysteine proteases. E64d is a potent inhibitor of thiol protease including CTSB (Hook et al., 2015; Inubushi et al., 1994; Romine et al., 2017; Trinchese et al., 2008; Tsubokawa et al., 2006) . E64d has also proved to be safe to humans as shown in a clinical study for Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury (this trial was stopped because lack of efficacy but the drug has proven to be safe to human). Given that E64d can significantly increase the proteins levels of SMN, the survival of spinal motor neurons, and the life span of SMA mice in vivo, our study not only identifies novel targets for regulating SMN proteins, but also provides a new candidate therapeutic agent for SMA. Table 1 summarized previous studies that are related to the susceptibility of SMN-\u22067 proteins and the upregulation of SMN proteins for SMA. As we can see, though previous studies have shown that SMN-\u22067 proteins are susceptible to degradation, they are focused on proteasome pathway, phosphorylation, and autophagy. The only study showed the role of cysteine protease in the SMN degeneration is from Strayer's group, in which only Calpain 1 was studied. Furthermore, the protective effects against motor neuron degeneration by cysteine protease inhibitors have not been examined before. During the review of our manuscript, a study reported and examined the role of Calpain 1 in SMA models (de la Fuente et al., 2018) , but did not examine any Cathepsin (lysosomal-dependent proteases) ; we have included a discussion of this study in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.",

This is of high importance because these members are different from Calpain 1 and have unique roles under pathological conditions.

In our study, E64d can significantly increase the proteins levels of SMN, the survival of spinal motor neurons, and the life span of SMA mice in vivo, suggesting that E64d serves a new candidate therapeutic agent for SMA.

            "text": "1. I appreciate the provided quantifications; however, the effects on SMN stability are often rather subtle. This should get mentioned in the manuscript text.-We appreciate this great suggestion. Though the increase of SMN-\u22067 by targeting individual cysteine protease is only 5-20%, the total increase of SMN (both SMN-FL and SMN-\u03947) through inhibiting the activity of multiple proteases would be higher. For SMA, Type I patients die before the age of 2, while type II patients who have 50% higher levels of functional SMN could live well into adulthood. Therefore, a moderate increase in SMN levels would significantly improve the survival of motor neurons. Moreover, compounds that increase SMN stability can be combined with drugs targeting other mechanisms (e.g. increasing SMN expression) in the future for combination therapy. We have now included a discussion on this issue in the revised manuscript.2. Please mention the statistical test used in the figure legends.-The related information has been added to the figure legends.3. The pulldown of Myc seems to not have worked well in the SMN2a/CAPN7 negative control experiment, please replace.-Thank you for pointing this out. We have replaced this in the revised manuscript.Sincerely, Thank you for submitting your Research Article entitled \"Drug screening with human SMN2 reporter identifies SMN protein stabilizers to correct SMA pathology\".
