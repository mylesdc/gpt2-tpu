Its genome comprises a 12 kb single-strand positive-sense RNA. In the present study, we report the patterns of synonymous codon usage in 141 CHIKV genomes by calculating several codon usage indices and applying multivariate statistical methods. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis showed that the preferred synonymous codons were G/C and A-ended. A comparative analysis of RSCU between CHIKV and its hosts showed that codon usage patterns of CHIKV are a mixture of coincidence and antagonism. Similarity index analysis showed that the overall codon usage patterns of CHIKV have been strongly influenced by Pan troglodytes and Aedes albopictus during evolution. The overall codon usage bias was low in CHIKV genomes, as inferred from the analysis of effective number of codons (ENC) and codon adaptation index (CAI). Our data suggested that although mutation pressure dominates codon usage in CHIKV, patterns of codon usage in CHIKV are also under the influence of natural selection from its hosts and geography. To the best of our knowledge, this is first report describing codon usage analysis in CHIKV genomes. The findings from this study are expected to increase our understanding of factors involved in viral evolution, and fitness towards hosts and the environment.",

            "text": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a member of the genus alphavirus of the family Togaviridae, is a small (60-70 nm), enveloped, singlestrand positive-sense RNA virus. The genome is approximately 12 kb in size and comprises two open reading frames (ORFs) encoding non-structural and structural proteins, respectively [1] . The CHIKV genome is arranged in the order of 5-9cap-nsP1-nsP2-nsP3-nsP4-(junction region)-C-E3-E2-6K-E1-poly(A)-39 [1] . Since the first isolation of CHIKV from a febrile individual in Tanzania in 1953 [2] , CHIKV has caused several outbreaks in Asia, Africa, and Indian Ocean islands, emerging as a serious public health concern [3] [4] [5] [6] . CHIKV infection is characterized by abrupt onset of high fever, headache, rashes, arthralgia and myalgia. The typical clinical sign of the disease is poly-arthralgia, which is a very painful condition affecting joints and may persist for several months to years in some cases [7] . Being an arthropodborne virus, the mode of transmission is the mosquitoes of the Aedes spp. It is generally accepted that CHIKV originated from Africa, where it is primarily maintained in a yellow fever-like zoonotic sylvatic cycle and depends upon non-human primates and arboreal, peridomestic mosquitoes as reservoir hosts. However, the spread of CHIKV in Asia and urban endemics are associated with a dengue-like ''human-mosquito-human'' direct transmission cycle, where A. aegypti and A. albopuctus serve as primary transmission vectors and humans serve as hosts [7] [8] [9] .",

            "text": "The genetic code comprises 64 codons that can be divided into 20 groups, where each group consists of one to six codons, and each group corresponds to each of the standard amino acids. Alternative codons within the same group coding for the same amino acid are often termed 'synonymous' codons, although their corresponding tRNAs might differ in their relative abundance in cells and in the speed by which they are recognized by the ribosome. This redundancy of the genetic code, in which most of the amino acids can be translated by more than one codon, represents a key step in modulating the efficiency and accuracy of protein production, while maintaining the same amino acid sequence of the protein. On the other hand, the synonymous codons are not chosen randomly both within and between genomes, which is referred to as codon usage bias [10, 11] . This phenomenon of synonymous codon usage bias has been studied in a wide range of organisms, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and viruses [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Studies on codon usage have determined several factors that could influence codon usage patterns, including mutational pressure, natural or translational selection, secondary protein structure, replication and selective transcription, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the protein and the external environment. Among these, the major factors responsible for codon usage variation among different organisms are considered to be compositional constraints under mutational pressure and natural selection [12, [18] [19] [20] .",

Considering their comparatively small genome size and other viral features, such as dependence on host's machinery for key process including replication, protein synthesis and transmission in comparison with prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, the interplay of codon usage among viruses and their hosts is expected to affect overall viral survival, fitness, evasion from host's immune system and evolution [15, 28] . Therefore, knowledge of the codon usage in viruses can not only reveal information about molecular evolution, but also improve our understanding of the regulation of viral genes expression and aid vaccine design, where the efficient expression of viral proteins may be required to generate immunity. In the present study, we report the detailed codon usage data and analysis of various factors shaping the codon usage patterns in CHIKV genomes.",

            "text": "Codon usage bias, or preference for one type of codon over another, can be influenced greatly by the overall nucleotide composition of genomes [21] . Therefore, we first analyzed the nucleotide composition of coding sequences from CHIKV genomes. As shown in Table 1 , the mean A% (28.91) was the highest, followed by similar composition of G% (25.75) and C% (25.19) , with the U% being the lowest (20.16) . The mean GC and AU compositions were 50.91% and 49.06% respectively. This appears to suggests there might be equal or almost equal distribution of A, U, G, and C nucleotides among codons of CHIKVs, with potentially more preference towards A-ended codons followed by G/C-ended codons. However, a clearer picture of overall nucleotide composition that could influence the codon usage preference in CHIKV genomes emerged from the analysis of the nucleotide composition of the third position of codons (A 3 , U 3 , G 3 , C 3 ) and of GC 1 , GC 1,2 , GC 3 and AU 3 ( Table 1) . The mean C 3 and G 3 were the highest, followed by A 3 and U 3 . The GC 3 values ranged from 54.9% to 57.2%, with a mean of 55.86% and a standard deviation (SD) 0.40 compared with that of AU 3 , whose values ranged from 42.8% to 45.1%, with a mean of 44.14% and an SD of 0.41. The GC 1 ranged from 50.6% to 53.8%, with a mean of 53.56% and an SD 0.27. The GC 1,2 values ranged from 48.2% to 48.7%, with an average of 48.45% and an SD of 0.07. Therefore, from the initial nucleotide composition analysis, it is expected that G/C-ended codons might be preferred over A/U-ended codons in CHIKV genomes.",

            "text": "To determine the patterns of synonymous codon usage and to what extent G/C-ended codons might be preferred, we performed RSCU analysis and calculated the RSCU values. Among the 18 most abundantly used codons in CHIKV genomes, eleven (UUC, CUG, AUC, GUG, CCG, UAC, UGC, CAC, CAG, AAC and GAC) were G/C-ended (C-ended: 7; G-ended: 4) and the remaining seven (ACA, GCA, UCA, AGA, AAA, GAA, GGA) were A-ended codons; none of the preferred codons were U-ended ( Figure 1A and Table 2) . From RSCU analysis, we observed that CHIKV exhibits comparatively higher codon usage bias towards G/C-and less towards A-ended codons. However, it is also interesting to note that the mean GC% and AU% values are very similar (Table 1 ), yet the G/C-ending codons were used in a comparatively biased manner, indicating that the G/C content at the third position of the codons influenced the shaping of the overall synonymous codons usage patterns. The overall general trend of the 59 synonymous codon usages was also relatively consistent among different genotypes of CHIKV, indicating that the evolutionary processes of the three genotypes of CHIKV are restricted by the synonymous codon usage pattern to some extent ( Figure 1B and Table 2 ). Furthermore, analysis of over-and underrepresented codons showed that codons with an RSCU.1.6 are infrequently observed in CHIKV genomes. The RSCU values of the majority of preferred and non-preferred codons fell between 0.6 and 1.6. We further divided the RSCU data into three groups; (A) codons with RSCU,0.6 (under-represented), (B) codons with RSCU values between 0.6 and 1.6 (unbiased/randomly represented), and (C) codons with RSCU values .1.6 (over-represented). Among 59 codons, only CUG (Leu) and AGA (Arg) had an RSCU.1.6. However, the under-represented codons (RSCU,0.6), were identified as follows: CUU, CUC for Leu, GUU for Val, and CGU, CGG for Arg. The remaining 52 codons had RSCU values between 0.6-1.6 ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ). These findings suggested that despite being an RNA virus with a high mutation rate in its lifecycle, CHIKV has evolved to form a relatively stable genetic composition at some specific levels of synonymous codon usage. This was further confirmed by ENC and CAI analysis as discussed in coming sections. Combining nucleotide composition and RSCU analysis, we deduced that the selection for preferred codons has been mostly influenced by compositional constraints, which also accounts for the presence of mutational pressure. However, we suspect that the compositional constraints may not be the sole factor associated with codon usage patterns in CHIKV, because although the overall RSCU values could reveal the codon usage pattern for the genomes, it may hide the codon usage variation among different genes in a genome [29] .",

            "text": "To quantify the extent of variation in codon usage among different genomes of CHIKV arising from different geographical regions and genotypes, the ENC values for each genome were calculated. The ENC values among CHIKV genomes ranged from 54.55 to 56.41, with a mean of 55.56 and an SD of 0.34 (Table 1 ). An average value of 55.56 (ENC.40) represents stable ENC values and indicates a relatively conserved genomic composition among different CHIKV genomes. In general, there is an inverse relationship between ENC and gene expression; i.e., a lower ENC value indicates a higher codon usage preference and higher gene expression and vice versa [30] . Our results show that the overall codon usage bias and gene expression among different CHIKV genomes is lower, slightly biased and would be mainly affected by the base composition. Previous studies on codon usage analysis among other RNA viruses, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (ENC: 50.91) [22] , classical swine fever virus (ENC = 51.7) [17] and HCV (ENC = 52.62) [31] , have also reported lower codon usage bias. The same is also true in the case of arthropodborne RNA viruses, including West Nile virus (ENC: 53.81) [15] and dengue virus (DENV) (ENC: 49.70: DENV-1; 48.78: DENV-2; 49.52: DENV-3; and 50.81: DENV-4) [14] . A possible explanation for the weak codon bias of RNA viruses is that it might be advantageous for efficient replication in host cells, with potentially distinct codon preferences [21] . The codon adaptation index (CAI) is often used as measure of level of gene expression and to assess the adaptation of viral genes to their hosts. Highly expressed genes exhibit a strong bias for particular codons in many bacteria and small eukaryotes. In comparison to the ENC, which is another way of calculating codon usage bias and measures deviation from a uniform bias (null hypothesis), CAI measures the deviation of a given protein coding gene sequence with respect to a reference set of genes [32] .

For instance, the codon usage pattern of poliovirus is reported to be mostly coincident with that of its host [34] , while the codon usage pattern of hepatitis A was reported to be antagonistic to that of its host [35] . We therefore computed and compared the codon usage of CHIKV with its two hosts (Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes), and transmission vectors (A. aegypti and A. albopictus). The results showed that the codon usage patterns of CHIKV were a mixture of coincidence and antagonism to its hosts and vectors (Table 2 ). In detail, the preferred codons for 12 out of 18 amino acids were common between CHIKV and H. sapiens. This included UUC (Phe), CUG (Leu), AUC (Ile), GUG (Val), UAC (Tyr), AGA (Arg), UGC (Cys), CAC (His), CAG (Gln), AAC (Asn), AAG (Lys) and GAC (Asp). Furthermore, all common preferred codons between CHIKV and H. sapiens were G/Cended (C-ended: 7; G-ended: 4), with exception of an A-ended preferred codon for amino acid Arg. Similarly, preferred codons for 10 out of 18 amino acids were common between CHIKV and P. troglodytes. In case of the two transmission vectors, 10 out of 18 preferred codons were common among both mosquito species and CHIKV. It is also interesting to note that, except for amino acid Arg, the remaining 10 highly preferred codons were same among CHIKV, H. sapiens, A. aegypti and A. albopictus. Moreover, the preferred codon usage profiles of A. aegypti and A. albopictus were also very similar: 16 out of 18 preferred codons were common between, with exceptions for the preferred codons for Asp and Gly ( Table 2 ). These results indicated that selection pressures from hosts and vectors have influenced the codon usage pattern of CHIKV and the possible fitness of the virus to adjust among its dynamic range of hosts and vectors. A mixture of coincidence and antagonism has also been reported previously in the case of HCV [31] and enterovirus 71 [13] . It was suggested that the coincident portions of codon usage among viruses and their hosts could enable the corresponding amino acids to be translated efficiently, while the antagonistic portions of codon usage may enable viral proteins to be folded properly, although the translation efficiency of the corresponding amino acids might decrease [31] .",

Therefore, we took advantage of a method proposed recently that estimates the similarity degree of the overall codon usage patterns comprehensively between viruses and their hosts by treating the 59 synonymous codons as 59 different spatial vectors. The advantage of this formula, as reported by the authors in the case of dengue viruses, is that the comparative overall codon usage takes the place of the direct estimation of each synonymous codon usage; thus, the new method avoids the situation that the variations of 59 synonymous codon usage confuse the correct estimation of the effect of the host on the virus for codon usage [36] . The similarity index D(A,B) was therefore calculated for each genotype of CHIKV in relation to its hosts and vectors. The similarity index was found to be highest for A. albopictus vs. CHIKV group followed by P. troglodytes vs. CHIKV, A. aegypti vs. CHIKV and lowest in the case of H. sapiens vs. CHIKV (Figure 2) , indicating that the effect of A. albopictus and P. troglodytes on the formation of the overall codon usage patterns of CHIKV is relatively higher than that of the A. aegypti and H. sapiens. Secondly, we computed the effect of transmission vectors on the formation of the overall codon usage patterns of three genotypes of CHIKV.",

In the case of A. albopictus, the strongest effect was noted on the ECSA genotype, followed by Asian and WA genotypes. As for the effects of the two primates on the formation of the overall codon usage of CHIKV, the strongest effect of H. sapiens was on the Asian genotype, closely followed by the ECSA and WA genotypes. By contrast, P. troglodytes had its strongest and equal effect on ECSA and Asian genotypes, followed by WA genotype (Figure 2 ). Therefore, from the similarity index analysis, we observed that selection pressure from hosts and vectors have contributed to shaping the molecular evolution of CHIKV at the respectively, on the formation of the overall codon usage patterns of CHIKV (Figure 2 ). The stronger effect of P. troglodytes than H. sapiens could also be attributed to the maintenance of CHIKV in a yellow fever-like zoonotic sylvatic cycle and its dependence upon non-human primates as reservoir hosts [7, 9] . Moreover, the similarity index of codon usage was also the highest between CHIKV and A. albopictus, as compared with A. aegypti, P. troglodytes and H. sapiens. The successful human-to-human transmission of CHIKV depends on Aedes mosquitoes [7, 9] ; therefore, the stronger effect of A. albopictus on all three genotypes of CHIKV suggests that this vector might be a more efficient reservoir for viral replication and transmission compared with A. aegypti. These results are in agreement with recent studies showing more efficient dissemination and transmission of CHIKV by A. albopictus, which contribute to its ongoing re-emergence in a series of large-scale epidemics [37, 38] .",

Codon usage is multivariate by its very nature; therefore, it is necessary to analyze the data using multivariate statistical techniques, such as COA [39] . Therefore, to determine the trends in codon usage variation among different CHIKV genomes, we performed COA on the RSCU values, which were examined as a single dataset based on the RSCU value of each coding region (Figure 3 ). The first principal axis (f9 1 ) accounted for 53.57% of the total variation, and the next three axes (f9 2 2f9 4 ) accounted for 25.16%, 7.62%, and 2.06% of the total variation in synonymous codon usage, respectively. For further analysis, plots were reconstructed based on different geographical locations ( Figure 4 ) and genotypes of CHIKV isolates ( Figure 5 ). As expected the CHIKV isolates belonging to ECSA genotype were distributed across all planes of axes. When these plots were accessed on regional basis, it was found that different genotypes are circulating in single country. This analysis showed that the three different genotypes of CHIKV might have common ancestor. This further implies that the geographical diversity and associated factors, such as presence of favorable transmission vectors, climate features, host range and susceptibility, have also contributed to shaping the molecular evolution and codon usage in CHIKV, even though it appears to be less influential than mutational pressure (based on the current analysis).",

Mutational pressure and natural selection are considered the two major factors that shape codon usage patterns [40] . A general mutational pressure, which affects the whole genome, would certainly account for the majority of the codon usage among certain RNA viruses [21] . To determine the extent of the influence of these two factors on CHIKV codon usage, we performed correlation analysis between different nucleotide constraints. A complex correlation was observed among different nucleotide constraints (Table 3 ). U 3 % had a significant positive correlation with U% (r = 0.621, P,0.01) and G% (r = 0.185, P,0.05), whereas it had significant negative correlations with C% (r = 20.606, P,0.01) A% (r = 20.278, P,0.01) and GC% (r = 20.806, P,0.01). C 3 % had significant positive correlation with C% (r = 0.621, P,0.01), A (r = 0.261, P,0.01) and GC% (r = 0.798, P,0.01), and negative correlations with U% (r = 20.5877, P,0.01) and G% (r = 20.217, P,0.01). A 3 % had positive correlations with A (r = 0.625, P,0.01), C% (r = 0.327, P,0.01) and negative correlations with U% (r = 20.373, P,0.01) and G% (r = 20.576, P,0.01), whereas no correlation was observed between A 3 % and the GC%. G 3 % was positively correlated with G% (r = 0.658, P,0.01) U% (r = 0.354, P,0.01), and negatively correlated with C% (r = 20.377, P,0.01) and A% (r = 20.610, P,0.01); the correlation with the GC% was nonsignificant. In the case of GC 3 %, positive correlation was noted with C% (r = 0.498, P,0.01) and GC% (r = 0.852, P,0.01), and negative correlation with U% (r = 20.480, P,0.01); the correlation with G% was non-significant. Finally the GC and GC 12 were also compared with GC 3 and a highly significant positive correlations (r = 0.28, P,0.01; GC 12 versus GC 3 ) (r = 0.85, P,0.01; GC versus GC 3 ) was observed as shown in Figure 6A and 6B respectively. Furthermore, a significant negative correlation between GC 3 and ENC values was also observed (r = 20.756, P,0.01). This analysis collectively indicates that mutational pressure is most likely responsible for the patterns of nucleotide composition and, therefore, codon usage patterns, because the effects were present at all codon positions.",

            "text": "Relationship between dinucleotide and codon usage patterns in CHIKV. It has been suggested that dinucleotide bias can affect overall codon usage bias in several organisms, including DNA and RNA viruses [41] [42] [43] . To study the possible effect of dinucleotides on codon usage in CHIKV genomes, we calculated the relative abundances of the 16 dinucleotides from the coding sequences of CHIKV. The occurrences of dinucleotides were not randomly distributed, and no dinucleotides were present at the expected frequencies (Table 5) . Under-representation of CpG dinucleotides in different RNA and DNA viruses has been reported [41] . In the case of CHIKV, the relative abundance of CpG showed deviation from the ''normal range'' (mean 6 (Table 2) . On the other hand, despite slight overrepresentation of the GpC dinucleotide, all GpC-containing codons were also under-represented (RSCU,1.6) and were not preferred codons for their respective amino acids, with two exceptions; GCA (Ala, RSCU = 1.43) and UGC (Cys, RSCU = 1.33) ( Table 2 ). It has been proposed that CpG deficiency in pathogens is associated with the immunostimulatory properties of unmethylated CpGs, which are recognized by the host's innate immune system as a pathogen signature [28] . Recognition of umethylated CpGs by Toll like receptor 9 (TLR9), a type of intracellular pattern recognition receptor (PRR), leads to activation of several immune response pathways [44] . The vertebrate immune system relies on unmethylated CpG recognition in DNA molecules as a signature of infection, and CpG under-representation in RNA viruses is exclusively observed in vertebrate viruses; therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that a TLR9-like mechanism exists in the vertebrate immune system that recognizes CpGs when in an RNA context (such as in the genomes of RNA viruses) and triggers immune responses [45] . Compared with differential (over-and under-) representation of CpGs in different organisms, UpA under-representation also exists in several organisms, including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and prokaryotes [41] . The presence of TpA in two out of three canonical stop codons and in transcriptional regulatory motifs (e.g., the TATA box sequence) is believed to be responsible for its under-representation. Therefore, UpA under-representation is expected to reduce the risk of nonsense mutations and minimizes improper transcription [43, 46] . In the case of CHIKV, the relative abundance of UpA also deviated from the ''normal range'' (mean 6 SD = 0.85960.022) and was under-represented, similarly to CpG. The six codons containing UpA (UUA, CUA, GUA, UAU, UAC and AUA) were also under-represented (RSCU,1.6) and were not preferred codons for their respective amino acids. The CpA (mean 6 SD = 1.12560.017) and UpG (mean 6 SD = 1.27560.022) dinucleotides were over-represented compared with the rest of the 14 dinucleotide pairs (Table 5) . Similarly, the eight codons containing CpA (UCA, CCA, ACA, GCA, CAA, CAG, CAU and CAC) and five codons containing UpG (UUG, CUG, GUG, UGU and UGC) were also overrepresented compared with the rest of the codons for their respective amino acids and a majority of them were also preferential codons for their respective amino acids, based on RSCU analysis ( Table 2 ). Over-representation of CpA and UpG in different organisms has been observed and is regarded as a consequence of the under-representation of CpG dinucleotides. One possible explanation is that methylated cytosines are prone to mutate into thymines through spontaneous deamination, resulting in the dinucleotide TpG and the subsequent presence of a CpA on the opposite strand after DNA replication [47] . However, this theory cannot explain under-representation of CpGs in RNA viruses. Moreover, under-representation of CpGs has also been observed in several vertebrate viruses, where it is independent of their genomic composition and replication cycles. Recently, two studies performed large-scale dinucleotide analyses in different viruses and suggested that the CpG usage of +ssRNA viruses is affected greatly by their hosts. As a result, most +ssRNA viruses mimic their hosts' CpG usage and the existence of an RNA dinucleotide recognition system, probably linked to the innate immune system of the host, has also been proposed [41, 48] .",

Among the 16 dinucleotides, 11 significantly (positive and negative) correlated with the first axis and 16 significantly (positive and negative) correlated with the second axis (Table 5 ). These observations indicated that the composition of dinucleotides determines the variation in synonymous codon usage. Therefore, from the present dinucleotide composition analysis, it is evident that selection pressure associated with (i) maintenance of efficient replication and transmission cycles among multiple hosts, and (ii) evolution of escape mechanisms to evade from the host antiviral responses, have contributed to shaping the overall synonymous codon usage in CHIKV.",

It has been suggested that if synonymous codon usage bias is affected by mutational pressure alone, then the frequency of nucleotides A and U/T should be equal to that of C and G at the synonymous codon third position [26] . However, in case of CHIKV genomes, variations in nucleotide base compositions were noted (Table 1 ), indicating that other factors, such as natural selection, could also influence overall synonymous codon usage bias. As the role of natural selection is also evident from previous codon usage analysis studies in several viruses [25, 26, 49] , we were interested to determine to what extent natural selection might be involved in the codon usage patterns of CHIKV. For this purpose, we computed the GRAVY and aromaticity (ARO) values for each CHIKV isolate (Table S1 ) and a linear regression analysis was performed between GRAVY, ARO and the f9 1 , f9 2 , ENC, GC and GC 3 values. The analysis results showed that the GRAVY values were not significant for f9 1 and were highly significant for f9 2 , ENC, GC 3 and GC. In the case of ARO, an opposite trend was observed: ARO values were significantly negatively correlated with f9 1 and correlations with f9 2 , ENC, GC 3 and GC were not significant ( Table 6 ). These results indicated that, although natural selection has influenced codon usage of CHIKV genomes to some extent, it is much weaker compared with mutational pressure.",

Our data suggested that codon usage in CHIKV is undergoing an evolutionary process, probably reflecting a dynamic process of mutation and natural selection to re-adapt its codon usage to different environments and hosts.

To minimize the effect of amino acid composition on codon usage, each coding sequence was represented as a 59 dimensional vector, and each dimension corresponded to the RSCU value of each sense codon, which only included several synonymous codons for a particular amino acid, excluding the codons AUG, UGG and the three stop codons.",
