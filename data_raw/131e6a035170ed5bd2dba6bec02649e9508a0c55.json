Recently, inactivation of STAT3 has been demonstrated as a therapeutic candidate for autoimmune arthritis. The expression of PTEN controlled by p53 regulates autoimmune arthritis through modulating the balance between Th17 and Treg. We hypothesized that PTEN regulated by p53 might reduce CIA severity and inflammatory response via inhibiting STAT3 activation. Our results revealed that PTEN could ameliorate experimental autoimmune arthritis by reducing STAT3 activity and Th17 differentiation. Systemic infusion of PTEN overexpression downregulated CIA severity. In addition, PTEN overexpression decreased the activation of T cells and modulated reciprocal differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells. We observed that PTEN expression downregulated by p53 deficiency induced the activation of STAT3. Loss of p53 exacerbated autoimmune arthritis and dysregulated the population of Th17 and Treg. These data suggest that induction of STAT3-modulatory activity of PTEN may be a therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis therapy.",

Gene expression of IL-17 in splenocytes isolated from p53 deficient mice was also significantly increased compare to that in WT mice (Fig. 4B ). T cell activation was profoundly upregulated in cells isolated from p53 deficient mice compared to that in WT mice (Fig. 4C ). Th17 differentiation in p53 deficient mice was significantly increased whereas Treg differentiation was significantly reduced compared to that in WT mice (Fig. 4D ). These data suggested that p53 deficiency could lead to T cell activation and imbalance between Th17 and Treg. p53 deficiency exacerbates CIA severity by upregulating inflammation. Based on arthritis scores, it was found that p53 deficiency exacerbated CIA progression in vivo (Fig. 5A ). Serum levels of total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a were significantly increased in p53 deficiency mice compared to those in WT mice (Fig. 5B) . Moreover, histological analysis showed that paws and ankles of p53 deficiency arthritis mice had higher degree of inflammation with bone damage and cartilage damage (Fig. 5C ). The expression of proinflammatory cytokines in joints were significantly upregulated in p53 deficiency arthritis mice compared to that in WT mice (Fig. 5D ). Our results suggested that p53 deficiency might have failed to regulate inflammatory response, thus worsening local inflammatory milieu.",

To our knowledge, this is the first research to provide evidence that PTEN could be used for RA therapy through regulating Th17/Treg balance. Previously, a number of documents have demonstrated that imbalance between Th17 and Treg can contribute to RA 1,24 . Modulation of Th17 and Treg cells has an important role in RA therapy 10, 25 . The activation of STAT5 prolongs Foxp3 production in Treg, while STAT3 activation increases the differentiation of Th17 cells 26 . Moreover, binding of p-STAT3 and p-STAT5 can competitively regulate IL-17 transcription 27 . Our results demonstrated that Foxp3 + T cells were induced by PTEN overexpression while p53 deficiency significantly induced p-STAT3 + T cells. This could be due to the diminishment of T cell transcriptional regulators such as Foxp3 and SOCS3 and the enhancement of ROR\u03b3 t, RUNX1, and BATF. In addition, PTEN decreased the number of Treg cells while Th17 differentiation was promoted in RA mice model. Hence, PTEN might be another efficient mechanism regulated by which p53 through controlling Th17/Treg balance.",
