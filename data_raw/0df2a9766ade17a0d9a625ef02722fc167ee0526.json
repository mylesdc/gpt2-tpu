Genetic evolution analysis indicates that all swine influenza viruses (SIVs) possessed full-length PA-X prior to 1985, but since then SIVs with truncated PA-X have gradually increased and become dominant, implying that truncation of this protein may contribute to the adaptation of influenza virus in pigs. To verify this hypothesis, we constructed PA-X extended viruses in the background of a \"triple-reassortment\" H1N2 SIV with truncated PA-X, and evaluated their biological characteristics in vitro and in vivo. Compared with full-length PA-X, SIV with truncated PA-X had increased viral replication in porcine cells and swine respiratory tissues, along with enhanced pathogenicity, replication and transmissibility in pigs. Furthermore, we found that truncation of PA-X improved the inhibition of IFN-I mRNA expression. Hereby, our results imply that truncation of PA-X may contribute to the adaptation of SIV in pigs.",

To explore the relationship between truncation of PA-X and viral adaptation in swine, we analyzed the frequency of the PA-X truncations in SIV by year based on all SIV sequences available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Influenza Viruses Resource, regardless of subtype and lineage. As shown in Fig. 1 , the PA-X proteins in all SIV cases were full-length before 1985, following which the number of SIVs containing truncated PA-X gradually increased. By 2015, more than 90% SIVs possessed truncated forms of PA-X. These data suggested that the truncation of PA-X protein may play an important role in the adaptation of SIV in pigs.",

Pigs are proposed to be \"mixing vessels\" or opportune intermediate hosts for the generation of novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential 14, 15 . Despite the pivotal role of pigs in the ecology of influenza A viruses, few virulence markers of influenza virus in pig are identified. Based on the fact that SIVs with truncated PA-X have been gradually increased and became dominan 5 , we investigate whether truncation of PA-X could adapt SIV for enhanced growth and transmission in pigs. We observed that truncation of PA-X promoted viral growth in PK15 cells and swine respiratory tissues infected ex vivo, increased the viral replication, pathogenicity and transmission in swine, and we further demonstrated that the altered ability of PA-X in suppressing IFN-I expression might responsible for these changes. These results suggested that SIV with truncated PA-X seemed to present a selective advantage in pigs, which is in accordance with the fact that the proportion of SIVs possessing truncated PA-X has continually increased and have become predominant in nature. In contrast, our previous study found that the 2009 H1N1, H5N1, and H9N2 influenza viruses with full length PA-X showed higher replication levels in A549 cells than those with truncated PA-X, and that virus with full length PA-X enhanced viral replication and pathogenicity in mice 16 . Coincidently, all of the avian and human influenza viruses possessed full-length PA-X in nature. Therefore, we speculate that the role of length of PA-X is associated with host specificity.",

To escape the antiviral response of the host, several viral proteins have been shown to suppress IFN-I expression, including vhs from herpes simplex virus (HSV) and nsp1 from severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), that is necessary for efficient virus growth and virulence [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . For the influenza virus, the newly identified PA-X protein, along with NS1, PB2, PB1, PA and PB1-F2 have been demonstrated to be involved in the IFN-I response modulation 27 . The most prominent IFN-I antagonist in influenza virus is the NS1 protein which can suppress the IFN-I response by interacting with RIG-I and TRIM25 [28] [29] [30] . Graef et al. demonstrated that the PB2 subunit of the influenza virus RNA polymerase complex interacted with MAVS and inhibited MAVS-mediated IFN-\u03b2 expression 31 . Additionally, the other polymerase proteins PB1 and PA were identified as part of the IFN-I inhibitory strategy evolved by influenza virus and suggested to interact with RIG-I, subsequently inhibiting RIG-I mediated IFN-I signaling 32 . Effects outlined of the PB1-F2 are strain specific, however interferon suppression seems to be a common property, as A/ Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1) as well as PR8 (H1N1) strains both exhibit IFN-\u03b2 antagonism 27 . More recently, Hayashi et al. reported that the presence of PA-X in A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) also resulted in a suppression of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA production through the shutoff activity of PA-X, leading to more efficient viral replication and more severe lung pathology in infected cells and mice 9 . Here, we clearly showed that truncated PA-X was more effective in inhibiting IFN-I mRNA expression in PAMs and pigs through the shutoff activity of PA-X, which is consisted with the enhanced replication, pathogenicity and transmissibility of PA-X mutants in pigs. Therefore, our study provides evidence that the adaptation of SIV in pigs may be partly due to the shutoff activity of PA-X.",

            "text": "In summary, we found that truncation of PA-X played an important role in the adaptation of SIV in pigs. Compared with that of full length PA-X, it conferred increased viral pathogenicity, replication and transmissibility in pigs, promoted viral growth in PK15 cells and swine respiratory tissues infected ex vivo, and greater inhibition of host IFN-I expression, which was consistent with the increasing occurrence of SIV with truncated PA-X. Generation of recombinant viruses by reverse genetics. All eight gene segments were amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from Sw-41X(WT) virus, and cloned into the dual-promoter plasmid pHW2000. The mutations were introduced into the PA gene using a Site-directed QuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR primer sequences are available upon request. The TR H1N2 SIV with full-length PA-X (61aa), Sw-61X, was constructed by extending PA-X from 41aa to 61aa on the backbone of Sw-41X(WT) virus. Substitution from stop codon (UAG) to tryptophan (UGG) codon at position 42 in the X-ORF did not change the PA ORF (Fig. 2) . Rescued viruses were detected using haemagglutination assays. Viral RNA was extracted and analysed by RT-PCR, and each viral segment was sequenced to confirm sequence identity. Viral titration and growth kinetics. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) was determined in MDCK cells with 10-fold serially diluted viruses inoculated at 37 \u00b0C for 72 h, as previous studies with Reed-Muench method 33, 34 . Multistep replication kinetics was determined by inoculating PK15 cells with a MOI of 0.01. Supernatants were sampled at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 , and 72 hours post-inoculation (hpi) and titrated by inoculating MDCK cells in 96-well plates. Three independent experiments were performed.",
