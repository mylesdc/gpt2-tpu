LASV infection of natalensis humans can cause Lassa fever (LF), a disease associated with high morbidity and significant mortality. Recent evidence indicates an LASV expansion outside its traditional endemic areas. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) included LASV in top-priority pathogens and released a Target Product Profile (TPP) for vaccine development. Likewise, in 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration added LF to a priority review voucher program to encourage the development of preventive and therapeutics measures. In this article, we review recent progress in LASV vaccine research and development with a focus on the impact of LASV genetic and biological diversity on the design and development of vaccine candidates meeting the WHO's TPP for an LASV vaccine.",

            "text": "Persistently infected Mastomys natalensis is the main source of natural LASV infection of humans 5, 6 . Rodent-to-human transmission occurs by the inhalation of dust contaminated by the excreta of infected rodents, direct contact of abraded skin with contaminated material, or the ingestion of contaminated food 7 . Clusters of infected M. natalensis are responsible for spatial distribution of Lassa fever (LF) cases in endemic areas [8] [9] [10] [11] . LASV infection is confined predominantly to M. natalensis monophylogenic group A-I in West Africa 12 , whereas other phylogroups from Central and Southern African regions have been associated with the non-pathogenic OW arenaviruses Mopeia (MOPV), Morogoro (MORV), Gairo (GAIV), and Luna (LUNV) [13] [14] [15] [16] . The detection of LASV in eastern Nigeria in M. natalensis from phylogroup A-II, which occupies a territory extending up to eastern Congo, underlines the potential of LASV to infect other genetically related host species and expand its geographic distribution 12, 17, 18 . In addition, the isolation of LASV from Mastomys erythroleucus and Hylomyscus pamfi in Guinea and Nigeria, respectively, suggests that host-switching events potentially contribute to LASV geographic expansion 17, [19] [20] [21] . LASV-endemic areas cover about 80% of Sierra Leone (SL) and Liberia, 50% of Guinea, 40% of Nigeria, 30% of each of Ivory Coast, Togo, and Benin, and 10% of Ghana with an at-risk population as high as 200 million people 20, 22, 23 . Moreover, West Africa is undergoing rapid demographic and environmental changes that are likely to increase LASV spillover events in coming decades 10 . The estimated global burden of LF is the highest among viral hemorrhagic fevers with the exception of dengue fever 24 .",

Lineages I-III comprise LASV strains isolated in different geographic areas of Nigeria. The largest lineage, lineage IV, with the prototypic JOSIAH/ SL/76/H (JOS) includes strains from Guinea, Liberia, and SL. Genetic analysis of clinical LF samples collected in 2008-2013 confirmed the existence of four major LASV lineages and provided additional evidence for high LASV genetic diversity, up to 25% and 32% for the S and L RNA segments, respectively 38,41 . A lineage V, which has a sister relationship with lineage IV, has been proposed for LASV isolates from Mali and Ivory Coast 39,42 . In addition, a Togo isolate with a mosaic genome structure (the L segment related to clade II and the S segment related to lineages I and IV) has been proposed to represent a separate lineage VI 43 . No evidence for LASV recombination has been presented so far, and naturally occurring LASV reassortment seems to be a rare event, since only three reassortants were identified among 194 LASV RNA clinical samples 38 . LASV geography-based clustering suggests multiple infections of individuals travelling across different LASV-endemic areas as the most likely explanation for the observed LASV reassortants 6 .",

Low or undetectable levels of pro-inflammatory chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and interferon (IFN)-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) receptors and IL-6 were associated with fatal LF 61 . High IL-6 in plasma is considered a biological marker of fatal LF linked with liver pathological regeneration 52,62,63 . Likewise, low levels of IL-6, IL-10, CD40L, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and blood urea nitrogen in LF patients from SL correlated with survival. At the terminal stage, LF is characterized by severe pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress, and signs of encephalopathy are observed with coma and seizures 28 .",

During the 2016 transmission season, patients with LF were predominantly from urban areas and fever was not a leading clinical sign, whereas bleeding diathesis, abdominal pain, and headache were present in more than 50% of confirmed cases 65 . Recent studies on a larger cohort of patients with LF treated in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (Edo State, Nigeria) 56 revealed similarities and differences between LF in SL and Nigeria. Both groups of patients had liver pathology manifestations, but Nigerian patients often had a lower AST/ALT ratio consistent with hepatocyte involvement. In both groups, higher viral load strongly correlated with poor outcome 25,65 . However, in contrast to SL LF, sepsis-associated hypothermia rather than fever was a predictor of poor outcome in Nigerian patients 67 . LF patients younger than 5 or older than 55 were the most likely to die 30, 56 . Kidney pathology, manifested as high creatinine and urea blood levels, was one of the most notable clinical features of Nigerian LF 56 . Analysis of 2017-2018 Nigerian LASV strains did not reveal differences in LASV genetic lineages or the epidemiology of the disease compared with previous years 68, 69 . The reason for the recent LF increase in Nigeria is not clear but is potentially related to changes in rodent reservoir or improvements in diagnostics and public awareness or both.",

One of the first LASV vaccine candidates supported by CEPI is being developed by Themis Bioscience and is based on recombinant measles vaccine technology from Institute Pasteur (www.themisbio.com). The measles virus vector-based vaccine platform looks promising for human infections with antibody-based protection 114 . However, there are no peer-reviewed pre-clinical data to support the application of this platform for the development of an LF vaccine with a predominant T-cell-mediated mechanism of protection. Pre-existing antivector immunity, as it might affect the outcome of clinical studies, has to be addressed for this approach. CEPI is also supporting a DNA-based vaccine against LASV 115 , which raises feasibility questions. There is no DNA preventive vaccine licensed for human use.

This lesson from EBOV vaccine development is applicable to LASV, since dependence on vaccine platform and vaccine recipients has been documented 48, 50, 74, 102, 109 (Table 1 ). The second rVSV-based LASV vaccine candidate supported by CEPI is based on the VesiculoVax platform licensed by Profectus BioSciences. This platform was developed to further improve the safety of the rVSV vector by N gene translocation and truncation of VSV-G cytoplasmic tail (CT1). The attenuated rVSV-N4CT1 vector was immunogenic in NHPs and induced only a mild inflammatory response after intra-thalamic inoculation 125 .

Population-based vaccination is the most effective option to control LF in endemic areas. The successful story of Candid #1, a live-attenuated vaccine against Argentine hemorrhagic fever 131 , provides a guideline for LASV vaccine clinical development. Because of the high LASV genetic diversity, multicenter trials in several endemic areas (countries) would probably be required to evaluate the crossprotective efficacy of vaccine candidates. Pre-existing LASV immunity potentially affects vaccine dose-dependent responses, and appropriate efforts must be applied during human trial design to correctly assess vaccine immunogenicity. Rooted research collaborations and capacity building will be crucial for anticipating multicenter immunogenicity and efficacy trials in West Africa 132,133 .",

The safety and efficacy of these vaccines in children and infants indicate that reassortant vaccine platforms are well suited for the pediatric population.

(A) LASV S RNA of strain 803213 was detected by using RNAscope in situ hybridization and amplification (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Inc.). Positively stained brown spots in liver tissues of LASV-infected marmosets (but not in tissues of mock-infected animals, not shown) are indicated by arrows. (B,C) Staining for AXL (additional LASV cell receptor) and Ki67 (hepatocyte proliferation marker) was performed as previously described 57 . Positively stained cells are indicated by arrows. Tissues of mock-infected marmosets were negatively stained on these markers (not shown).
