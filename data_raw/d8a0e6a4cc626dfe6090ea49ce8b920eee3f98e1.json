A total of 2,237 subjects aged 25-64, working and residing in Eskilstuna (central Sweden), enrolled in the study in August 2011. They filled in five detailed questionnaires including information on demography, personal characteristics, work tasks, work place, contact patterns, family structure, health status, physical activity and diet. During a 9-month follow-up period, the participants self-reported-via internet or telephone-any onset of fever, upper respiratory tract infection, or gastroenteritis immediately as they occurred. For each disease episode, the participants were asked to submit a self-sampled nasal swab for viral diagnosis. In total, 1,733 disease reports were recorded and 1,843 nasal swabs were received, of which 48% tested positive for one or more of 14 analyzed viruses. The cohort has been used to date to study diet, sleep and physical activity as determinants for upper respiratory tract infections. Analyses of contact patterns and occupational circumstances as risk factors for the transmission of infections are ongoing. The SWEDE-I study should be seen as a first pioneering effort to provide new insight in the epidemiology and prevention of viral infections. Potential joint collaborations can be discussed with the principal investigators.",

However, data on the preventive role of physical interventions, e.g. hand washing, in adult populations are rather weak and the results are conflicting [12] . The role of physical activity is uncertain [13, 14] . Body cooling seems to be unrelated to risk [15] , but sudden changes of temperature at work were significantly associated with the risk of community-acquired pneumonia in one study [16] . Sleep duration and efficiency was shown to be strongly linked to susceptibility to experimental inoculation of rhinovirus, adding support to the importance of shift work as a facilitating factor [17, 18] . However, to our knowledge, the effects of long sleep duration on infections are not well established. Smoking, and to a lesser extent passive smoking, appears to be important [19, 20] , and the importance of dust, particles and airborne irritants needs to be investigated.",

A representative sample of this particular target population was created by Statistics Sweden through record-linkage between its Labour Market Register and the Total Population Register. To achieve a premeditated sample size of 2,200, based on the low observed participation rates in earlier population-based infectious disease surveillance studies with a similar commitment [21] , postal invitations were sent to an age-and sex-stratified random sample of 14,008 individuals in August 2011. In particular, Bexelius et al.

Passive follow-up of the kind practiced in the present study, relying on self-initiated, eventdriven infectious disease reporting, has been thoroughly evaluated from various aspects, including validity and completeness of reporting [21, 25] . Despite substantial under-reporting, this seems to be remarkably constant over time so that adjustments using a constant correction factor would potentially restore validity of incidence rates.

It comprised symptoms known to be associated with acute respiratory infections or gastroenteritis: sore throat, coughing, runny nose, headache, fever and body ache. Information about exact date of onset, contacts with people in the family, in the workplace, or elsewhere who had similar symptoms before onset, and consultation with a doctor after onset were also collected. The symptom questionnaire is included in the supplementary material (S6 File). Based on pre-defined algorithms, the diseases could be classified as influenza-like illness (ILI), [26] common cold, [27] gastroenteritis, or other/unclassifiable. Viral agents. Concurrent with every symptom report (ILI, common cold, gastroenteritis, or other/unclassifiable), the participants were instructed to take a sample of secretions from the nose. Two kits with regular nylon flocked dry swabs in plastic tubes (Nordic Biolabs, T\u00e4by, Sweden), along with thorough instructions, had been sent to each participant shortly after entry into the cohort. The used kits were returned via regular pre-paid mail. When the last kit had been returned, the participant was automatically supplied with a new one. Viral diagnosis was performed by the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems in 384-well plates [28] . The samples were analyzed for 14 different viruses: Rhinovirus; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); influenza A, A(H1N1) and B; parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3; human coronavirus (hCOV) 229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43; enterovirus; and metapneumovirus (MPV). Remaining material was stored at-70\u02daC for possible future supplementary analyses. Each participant received a unique code which, combined with the individual's unique national registration number, gave access to a secure website with the viral test results.

This explains part of the 382 swabs that could not be matched, the remaining part is due to timing issues: when the number of days between arrival of the specimen to the lab and disease onset was greater than 15 or smaller Table 2 than -5 (case where the specimen was sent before the registered onset of disease) laboratory results were not linked to symptoms reported. On the other hand, 272 sick reports could not be merged to nasal swabs. Apart from the same issue of timing, this fact might also be explained by certain symptoms reported. The absence of a nasal sample correlates well with the presence of vomiting and the absence of runny nose. Further details on specimen results can be found in our Eurosurveillance paper [32] . Briefly, when analyzing the seasonality, we found that the peak in the number of returned swabs was reached in the last week of September 2011, but the proportion of positive tests increased from mid-November until April.

Selecting subjects from a restricted source population, however, might enhance feasibility of the study and increase completeness of follow-up [35] . In a small community with high participation density it is also easier to keep participants alerted to their reporting responsibility since information about the study tends to propagate by word-of-mouth. Given the significant commitment required, the low participation rate was expected. In addition, to preserve internal validity, the invitees were discouraged from signing up if they doubted that they were able to completely fulfil the commitments [21] . In the present study, the expected under-representation of men and of the age stratum 25-44 years was compensated for in the recruitment; despite that, the proportion of men and individuals in the age stratum 25-44 is still lower compared to the working age Swedish population in 2011. An older age, a higher degree of education and a predominance of females in respondents compared to the total population have been previously reported also in other epidemiological studies [36, 37] and it might cast doubt on the generalizability. It has been argued, however, that a skillful control for confounding and the understanding of mechanisms of effect [38] might be even more important than representativeness of the sample. Additionally, unintentional non-representativeness might cause greater bias when the probability of participation in the study is affected by the outcome [39] , but we have no reason to believe that a common outcome as viral infections is linked to decision to take part in the study. Lastly, the potential lack of representativeness due to self-selection has to be balanced against the potential bias from poor response to follow-up in a more representative sample [39] .",

            "text": "(II). Since assessment of exposures was only made once, there may be non-differential misclassification of the more relevant exposures that occurred in the few days that preceded the onset of disease episodes. From a purely biological point of view, this may lead to underestimations of the strength of causal associations, but since aspects of the work environment that are potentially modifiable tend to be more stable over time (e.g. working with young children, working in hospitals, working indoors/outdoors, being in contact with several people. . .), associations that are of interest from a public health perspective may be less liable to underestimation. Given the prospective nature of the study, exposure misclassification that is differential in regard to the outcome is unlikely. However, since participants did not answer the risk factor questionnaires before the start of follow-up, but rather spread them out over the first months, there is some scope for reverse causation. As all responses are recorded with a time stamp, there are ample possibilities to do sensitivity analyses, where each individual's start of follow-up is shifted to the point when all the relevant exposure information had been registered. Misclassification of the outcome is another internal validity issue. The total number of reported infections might be inaccurate, in particular we observed that individuals with more missing answers in the exposure questionnaires had a lower number of infections reported. The significant commitment required may have caused in some individuals reporting fatigue which, as a matter of fact, may result in fewer or zero infections being reported. In addition, it is not possible to distinguish between a zero occurrence and a nonresponse, but methods to account for the presence of excess zeros are available [40] . Extensive evaluations of the validity of selfinitiated, event-driven infectious disease reports have been done in two previous population-based surveillance cohorts, each followed during one infectious disease season [25] . Briefly, while the specificity was very high (essentially no false positive reporting), there was substantial under-reporting. The estimate was 60%, but since the reference standard measurements (retrospective reporting at the end of the surveillance period) were likely over-estimating the number of disease events due to so called telescoping bias, the true extent of under-reporting is likely to be of the order of 50% [25] . The constancy across sociodemographic strata in the validation studies allays the obvious concern that the under-reporting might be differential in regard to the studied exposures. Some further comfort inheres in the rule of thumb that independent non-differential disease misclassification with perfect specificity will not bias the risk-ratio estimate [41] .",

In addition, the follow-up covered the entire Swedish season of respiratory infections. (II) Viral testing was done on a large scale. Unique information was obtained about the dynamics of viral agent-specific outbreaks/epidemics occurring during nine months in a representative population. Long-term storage of the collected samples allows possible subsequent in-depth molecular studies. (III) Unlike traditional approaches in infectious disease epidemiology, where focus is placed on identifiable encounters with infected individuals, resulting in dichotomous viral exposure assessments, the assessments in this study are probabilistic in nature, based on observed, period-specific incidence rates in the population and self-reported contact patterns. (IV) The extensive set of covariates not only enhances control of confounding and imputation of missing values, but also provides new quantitative information about associations of a large number of occupational and non-occupational factors (e.g. air temperature, dust, hand washing, long sleep, exercise) with risks of common viral infections.",
