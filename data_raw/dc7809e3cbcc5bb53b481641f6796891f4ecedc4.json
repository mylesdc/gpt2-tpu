            "text": "We report the identification of a novel polyomavirus present in respiratory secretions from human patients with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. The virus was initially detected in a nasopharyngeal aspirate from a 3year-old child from Australia diagnosed with pneumonia. A random library was generated from nucleic acids extracted from the nasopharyngeal aspirate and analyzed by high throughput DNA sequencing. Multiple DNA fragments were cloned that possessed limited homology to known polyomaviruses. We subsequently sequenced the entire virus genome of 5,229 bp, henceforth referred to as WU virus, and found it to have genomic features characteristic of the family Polyomaviridae. The genome was predicted to encode small T antigen, large T antigen, and three capsid proteins: VP1, VP2, and VP3. Phylogenetic analysis clearly revealed that the WU virus was divergent from all known polyomaviruses. Screening of 2,135 patients with acute respiratory tract infections in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, and St. Louis, Missouri, United States, using WU virus-specific PCR primers resulted in the detection of 43 additional specimens that contained WU virus. The presence of multiple instances of the virus in two continents suggests that this virus is geographically widespread in the human population and raises the possibility that the WU virus may be a human pathogen.

Despite extensive studies in the past decades that have identified a number of etiologic agents, including rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenzaviruses, parainfluenzaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenoviruses, approximately 30% of all cases cannot be attributed to these agents, suggesting that additional respiratory pathogens are likely to exist [2] . In fact, since 2001, six previously undescribed viruses have been identified by analysis of clinical specimens from the human respiratory tract: human metapneumovirus [3] , SARS coronavirus [4] , coronavirus NL63 [5] , coronavirus HKU1 [6] , human bocavirus [7] , and the recently described KI virus [8] . In some instances, new molecular methods such as VIDISCA [5] , pan-viral DNA microarrays [9] , and high throughput sequencing [7, 8] have played key roles in the identification of these agents. The advent of these new technologies has greatly stimulated efforts to identify novel viruses in the respiratory tract and in other human disease states.",

To date, two polyomaviruses, BK virus and JC virus, have been unambiguously described as human pathogens. BK and JC viruses are ubiquitous worldwide, and in adult populations, seroprevalence rates approaching 75% and 100%, respectively, have been reported [10] . Although human polyomaviruses have been suggested to utilize a respiratory route of transmission, detection of BK and JC polyomavirus nucleic acids in the respiratory tract has rarely been reported [11, 12] . Infection with these two viruses is predominantly asymptomatic, although in the context of immunosuppression a number of syndromes have been clearly linked to these viruses. JC virus causes primary multifocal leukoencephalopathy, while BK virus has been associated with a variety of renal and urinary tract disorders, most importantly tubular nephritis, which can lead to allograft failure in renal transplant recipients and hemorrhagic cystitis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [13] . These viruses are believed to persist in a latent phase primarily in the kidney and can periodically undergo reactivation. Excretion of BK and JC viruses in urine has been reported in up to 20% of the general population [14, 15] .",

The patient had no other remarkable clinical traits other than the respiratory features of pneumonia. Testing of nucleic acid extracted from the NPA using a panel of 17 PCR assays for known respiratory viruses as described [20] yielded negative results. Total nucleic acid from the NPA was randomly amplified and cloned as described previously [9] . One 384-well plate of clones was sequenced using a universal M13 primer, and the resulting sequence reads were analyzed as described in Materials and Methods. Of the 384 reads, there were 37 poor quality sequences that were rejected from further analysis, 327 human sequences, six bacterial sequences, six viral sequences, and eight sequences of unknown origin that could not be classified. The bacterial sequences had greater than 97% nucleotide identity to known bacterial species, including Haemophilus influenzae (three reads), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Corynebacterium pseudodiphthericum, and Leifsonia xyli (unpublished data). Upon further examination, the six viral reads were collapsed into three unique regions, each of which possessed only limited homology to known polyomavirus proteins (sequences available in Figure S1 ). The highest scoring BLASTx hits for each of these three contigs possessed 35%, 50%, and 34% amino acid identity to JC virus STAg, BK virus LTAg, and SV40 VP1, respectively. At the time these experiments were performed, the KI virus genome had not yet been published. Subsequent analysis revealed amino acid identities of 66%, 65%, and 69% to KI virus for the three contigs. Furthermore, three of the eight previously unclassified sequence reads were determined to have between 58%-84% amino acid identity to KI virus VP1 and VP2 proteins by BLASTx analysis. Based on the limited sequence homology to known viruses, we tentatively assigned the name WU to the unknown polyomavirus.",

In addition, the overall GC content of the WU genome was 39%, which is quite similar to the GC content of BK (39%), JC (40%), and SV40 (40%). The genome organization included an early region coding on one strand for STAg and LTAg, and a late region coding on the opposite strand for the capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 ( Figure 1 ). These two regions were separated by a regulatory region that contained typical polyomavirus features. The regulatory region contained an AT-rich region on the late side of the putative replication origin. Three repeats of the consensus pentanucleotide LTAg binding site GAGGC were present, as was one copy of the non-consensus LTAg binding site TAGGC. While most polyomaviruses contain four copies of the consensus, baboon polyomavirus (simian agent 12) is a primate polyomavirus that contains only three copies of the canonical binding sequence and one non-consensus binding site [21] . Unusual features in the WU regulatory region included the presence of two partially overlapping LTAg binding sites and slightly variant spacing between the LTAg binding sites as compared to SV40, BK, and JC ( Figure S2 ).",

Earlier this year, a third polyomavirus, KI, was described in human clinical specimens, although its pathogenicity and prevalence in humans has not yet been established. The discovery of WU virus brings the number of polyomaviruses detected in humans to four. WU differs from BK and JC significantly in its genome sequence and in its relative tissue tropism, suggesting that it is likely to have unique biological properties. This discovery raises many questions for further investigation, such as, Is WU virus a human pathogen? If so, what kind of disease does it cause? Where in the body does WU virus reside? At what age does infection typically occur? Perhaps most importantly, there are likely to be many more as of yet unidentified viruses infecting the human body.",

First, the mouse polyoma-like viruses have insertions of varying length after amino acids 66 and 113 of SV40 as compared to the primate class. In the amino terminal domain of the WU virus LTAg, multiple sequence alignment revealed the presence of a two-amino acid and a ten-amino acid insertion at these two loci, respectively.

In addition, we sequenced the complete genome of five additional isolates from five independent patients. Unfortunately, efforts to completely sequence the two most divergent isolates (based on the 250bp sequence, B2 and B3) have been unsuccessful, presumably due to low viral titers in these samples. All six complete genomes were 5,229 bp in size, and overall, there was between 0.08% and 0.23% sequence variation from sample to sample, well above that expected from Taq PCR, ruling out the possibility that the additional positives were artifacts of PCR contamination. Moreover, the majority of the observed mutations were synonymous substitutions or in non-coding regions, lending further support to the argument that these were authentic strain variants. For JC virus, the reported intratype sequence variation is of a similar magnitude, ranging between 0.1% and 0.5% [23] .",

At all loci, WU virus was most similar to KI virus, but the degree of divergence between WU and KI was greater than the divergence between SV40 and BK, indicating that WU and KI are clearly distinct viruses (Figure 2 ). Based on the phylogenetic analysis, it appears that WU and KI define a novel branch within the Polyomaviridae family ( Figure 2 ). Relative to the established polyomaviruses, some analyses suggested that the WU/KI branch might be more closely related to the primate polyomaviruses, while other features of the WU genome suggested that it might be more similar to murine polyomavirus. For example, neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis suggested that the predicted STAg, LTAg, and VP1 open reading frames of both KI and WU were most closely related to SV40, JC, BK, and baboon polyomaviruses. Analysis of the VP2/VP3 region was more equivocal, as the proteins were too divergent to reliably assess. The apparent absence of the C-terminal ''host range'' domain in the LTAg and the agnoprotein open reading frame, both of which are present in the known primate polyomaviruses, suggested that WU virus was more similar to murine polyomavirus than the primate polyomaviruses by these criteria. While the evolutionary history of this virus is not clear at the moment, the totality of the analysis indicates that WU is clearly a unique virus.",

As the positive specimens were all collected from 2003 through 2006, it appears that WU is currently circulating, and its presence in both North America and Australia suggests that the virus is geographically widespread in the human population. The age range of patients that tested positive for WU virus spanned from 4 months to 53 years. The majority (86%) of the cases were found in children 3 years of age and under. Of the four positive specimens from adult patients (S1, S6, B1, and B3 in Table 2 ), three clearly had altered immune status. One patient was HIV-positive, one was immunosuppressed due to treatment for Wegener granulo- Table 2 . doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.0030064.g003 matosis, and one was pregnant. The fourth adult patient (S1), while not obviously immunosuppressed, also suffered from liver cirrhosis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and co-infection with herpes simplex virus, and required mechanical ventilation. In addition, there were two other positive patients older than 3 years of age: a 6-year-old child who had previously been a bone marrow transplant recipient ( Table 2 , B27) and a 6-year-old child diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( Table 2, The patients who yielded positive specimens suffered from a wide range of respiratory syndromes, including bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia as well as other clinical maladies ( Table 2 ). Detection of WU virus sequences in these patients is merely the first step in assessing the potential etiologic role of WU virus in acute respiratory tract disease. It is not yet known whether WU is infectious or whether it is capable of replication in the respiratory tract. One possibility is that WU is not involved at all in respiratory disease, but rather is simply transmitted by the respiratory route. The human polyomaviruses BK and JC are hypothesized to be transmitted by the respiratory route before taking up residency primarily in the kidneys. Latency in the kidneys of BK and JC is believed to be the reason that both viruses are excreted in the urine of up to 20% of asymptomatic individuals [14, 15] . In this study, using the same PCR assays that were effective in respiratory secretions, we did not detect WU in any of the 727 urine samples we tested. The lack of detection of WU virus in the urine may reflect sensitivity issues, a bias in the cohorts tested, or simply that WU is unlike BK and JC viruses and is not secreted in the urine. A similar tissue profile to that of WU virus has been reported in initial studies of KI virus [8] . Future experiments will aim to determine the tissue tropism of WU and whether any tissue reservoirs for WU virus exist.",

Although more extensive studies are necessary to confirm the generality of this observation, this raises several intriguing non-mutually exclusive possibilities to consider: 1) WU may be an opportunistic pathogen; 2) WU infection may predispose or facilitate secondary infection by other respiratory viruses; and 3) WU may be a part of the endogenous viral flora that is reactivated by inflammation or some other aspect of viral infection. Recent studies of the prevalence of the newly identified human bocavirus have also reported higher levels of co-infection than previously described for other viruses found in the respiratory tract, with co-infection rates as high as 50% reported [28, 29] . In addition, five of six samples positive for KI virus were reported to be co-infected with other known respiratory viruses [8] . As detection methods improve in sensitivity and more comprehensive efforts are made to examine the diversity of viruses found in the respiratory tract, a greater appreciation for the rates of dual or multi-infection is gradually emerging. For example, the use of extensive panels of PCR assays in this study revealed that one of the positive specimens was quadruply infected; adenovirus, rhinovirus, and bocavirus and WU virus were all present. Further investigations that aim to systematically define the spectrum of viruses present in the respiratory tract are clearly warranted so that the possible roles that coinfections may play in disease pathogenesis can be explored.",

These data suggest that WU virus and KI virus define a novel branch within the Polyomaviridae family with unexplored biology and pathogenicity. Another implication of these results is that the diversity of viruses in this family may be far greater than currently realized. Further experimentation is now underway to determine the relative pathogenicity of WU virus in humans and to understand the molecular properties of the virus.

Total nucleic acid was extracted using the Masterpure Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, http://www.epibio.com). Then, 100 ng of total nucleic acid was randomly amplified using the RdAB protocol exactly as described [9] . RNA in the total nucleic acid preparation was converted to cDNA by reverse transcription with primer-A (59 GTTTCCCAGTCACGA-TANNNNNNNNN). Two rounds of random priming with primer-A and extension with Sequenase (United States Biochemical, http:// www.usbweb.com) enabled second strand cDNA synthesis as well as random priming of DNA originally present in the total nucleic acid sample.

Amplicons were cloned into pCR4.0 and sequenced using standard sequencing technology. All primers used for amplification and sequencing are listed in Table S1 and their positions depicted in Figure S5 . Additional complete genomes were sequenced to at least 23 coverage using the same primers listed in Table S1 . Completed Nucleic acid prevalence studies. For all PCR assays, standard precautions to avoid end product contamination were taken, including the use of PCR hoods and maintaining separate areas for PCR set up and analysis. For initial screening of WU virus, PCR primers AG0044 59 tgttacaaatagctgcaggtcaa and AG0045 59 gctgcataatggggagtacc were used with Accuprime hot start Taq (Invitrogen) to amplify 1 ul of template using the following program: 40 cycles of 94 8C 30 s; 56 8C 30 s; 72 8C 60 s. For every 88 samples tested, seven notemplate negative controls were interspersed between the actual samples. Products were visualized following electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. The resulting 250-bp amplicon was sequenced directly in both directions using primer AG0044 and AG0045. These sequences have been deposited in GenBank (see Supporting Information for accession numbers). Secondary confirmation was performed using primers AG0048 59 TGTTTTTCAAGTATGTTGCATCC and AG0049 59 CACCCAAAAGACACTTAAAAGAAA that generate a 244-bp amplicon in the 39 end of the LTAg coding region.

Figure S1 . Raw Sequence Data from High Throughput Screening A) The initial six shotgun reads with homology to polyomaviruses. B) The three contigs derived from the six reads. The consensus TAg binding motif is GAGGC. The known primate polyomaviruses SV40, JC, BK, and baboon polyomavirus all have four copies of the copies of the binding site oriented as shown above for SV40 (NC_001669). The first nucleotide of the third copy of the consensus TAg binding site is defined as nucleotide 1 for WU and SV40. Differences between SV40 and WU Virus are 1) one of the TAg binding sites in WU virus appears to be a non-canonical TAGGC; 2) the second and third consensus TAg binding sites in WU virus overlap; and 3) the nucletoide spacing between the TAg binding sites in WU virus varies from the prototype SV40 as shown.
