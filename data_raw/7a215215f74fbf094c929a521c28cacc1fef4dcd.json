To better understand the risk of infections during decitabine treatment, we retrospectively examined the culture results from each infection-related serious adverse event that occurred among 85 AML and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients treated in a prospective clinical study using 10-day cycles of decitabine at Washington University School of Medicine. Culture results were available for 163 infection-related complications that occurred in 70 patients: 90 (55.2%) events were culture-negative, 32 (19.6%) were gram-positive bacteria, 20 (12.3%) were gram-negative bacteria, 12 (7.4%) were mixed, 6 (3.7%) were viral, 2 (1.2%) were fungal, and 1 (0.6%) was mycobacterial. Infection-related mortality occurred in 3/24 (13%) of gramnegative events, and 0/51 gram-positive events. On average, nearly one third of patients experienced an infection-related complication with each cycle, and the incidence did not decrease during later cycles. In summary, in patients receiving 10-day decitabine, infectious complications are common and may occur during any cycle of therapy. Although febrile events are commonly culture-negative, gram-positive infections are the most frequent source of culture-positive infections, but gram-negative infections represent a significant risk of mortality in AML and MDS patients treated with decitabine.",

The majority of these events were not associated with a causative agent; an identifiable organism was isolated in 45% of admissions and bacteria represented the most commonly identified source of infection. Microbiologically or clinically documented fungal or viral infections were diagnosed in less than 5% of hospitalizations. In our study, the ratio of gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria approached 2:1. Gram-positive cocci (predominantly coagulase-negative staphylococci) represented the most frequently isolated microorganisms. This finding is not surprising, and consistent with the literature of other chemotherapeutic agents in hematological malignancies as well as solid cancers [16, 17] . This dominant gram-positive pattern can be attributed to the widespread use of indwelling intravascular catheters and the use of prophylaxis targeted against gram-negative organisms (e.g., ciprofloxacin). Surgically implanted tunneled catheters have been associated with lower rates of bloodstream infections than percutaneously inserted catheters [18, 19] . In this study, we observed a nonsignificant trend toward greater numbers of gram-positive infections in patients with Hohn and PICC catheters, as might be expected. AML and MDS patients receiving decitabine frequently present with cytopenias and are unable to obtain a surgically implanted catheter until they achieve remission. This limits this opportunity for alternative access, and physicians should be cognizant of the risks and opportunities posed by different forms of percutaneous access. Enterococcal species, especially vancomycin-resistant bacteria, represented the second most common gram-positive isolates in our population, causing mainly bacteremia and urinary tract infections. Nevertheless, the rate of VRE infections appears to be similar in our patients compared to patients undergoing induction with more intensive chemotherapy (11% compared to 10%) [20, 21] . Although colonization is far more frequent than true infection even in immunocompromised patients, bacteremia with VRE has been involved in outbreaks among oncology patients treated with chemotherapy and can be associated with increased mortality rates [20, 22] .",

We observed an incidence of probable/proven invasive fungal infections of 7% including the mixed infections. Although the spectrum of the fungal pathogens is similar (commonly, Aspergillus species and Candida species), the incidence may be modestly lower than the reported 12% incidence rate of IFIs in AML patient treated with more intensive cytotoxic therapy [29] . Nevertheless, considering the high number of observed clinically suspected infections with negative cultures, we cannot exclude that the incidence of invasive fungal infections might be higher.",

In this cohort, admission to the hospital for evaluation of neutropenic fever occurred in the majority of patients at some point during treatment, and occurred in nearly one third of patients during each cycle of treatment. A causative agent was identified in less than half of admissions, and gram-positive bacteria were the most frequent agents identified. However, gramnegative infections were associated with mortality. Although expanding antimicrobial prophylaxis to include better gram-positive coverage (e.g., ampicillin or augmentin) could reduce the incidence of hospital admissions, this is unlikely to have an impact on overall survival. Furthermore, the downsides of this approach including toxicities and the potential for promoting resistance should be considered. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether the benefit of antibacterial prophylaxis outweighs the risks.",
