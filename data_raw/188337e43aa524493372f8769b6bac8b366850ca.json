As polysaccharides may also have antiinflammatory functions, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects and related molecular mechanisms of a crude polysaccharide (HMFO) obtained from HMF of CW in mice with dextran sulfate sodium-(DSS-) induced colitis and in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. HMFO ameliorated the pathological characteristics of colitis and significantly reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum. Histological analysis indicated that HMFO improved the signs of histological damage such as abnormal crypts, crypt loss, and inflammatory cell infiltration induced by DSS. In addition, HMFO inhibited iNOS and COX-2 protein expression, as well as phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p65 levels in the colon tissue of mice with DSS-induced colitis. In macrophages, HMFO inhibited several cytokines and enzymes involved in inflammation such as prostaglandin E 2 , nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 by attenuating nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases. HMFO attenuated inflammation both in vitro and in vivo, primarily by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation. Our findings indicate that HMFO is a promising remedy for treating inflammatory bowel diseases, such as colitis.",

It is estimated that 1-2 million people in the United States suffer from IBD, approximately half of which have UC. The exact cause of UC was unknown, but it appears to be related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors [3] . The goal of conventional IBD therapies is mainly to downregulate aberrant immune responses and inflammatory cascades. Conventional drugs for IBD include corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA; mesalazine), but these drugs have undesirable side effects, especially steroid therapy, which can cause infertility and developmental disability [4, 5] . IBD patients present diverse symptoms throughout the course of the disease. Some symptoms are directly related to disease activity, while others may be a consequence of therapy. The disease imposes a substantial burden on patients and significantly impacts their functioning and health-related quality of life [6] .",

Previously, we showed that a high-molecularweight fraction (HMF) of C. wilfordii exerted immuneenhancing effects on immunosuppression induced by cyclophosphamide and on macrophages, and this effect was attributed to the crude polysaccharide [25] . However, the anti-inflammatory effects of polysaccharides of C. wilfordii in a dextran sulfate sodium-(DSS-) induced mouse model of colitis and the related mechanism of action have not yet been reported. As polysaccharides may also have anti-inflammatory functions, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of polysaccharides from C. wilfordii on lipopolysaccharide-(LPS-) induced RAW 264.7 macrophages and on DSS-induced chronic colitis in mice.",

The highmolecular-weight fraction was precipitated by the addition of 4 volumes of 95% ethanol. The mixture was allowed to stand at 4\u00b0C overnight and was then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min to obtain the precipitate. The precipitate was lyophilized to produce HMFO, and the chemical and monosaccharide compositions of HMFO were analyzed in previous study [25] .

            "text": "in Mice with DSS-Induced Colitis. Histological analysis was performed to assess the therapeutic effects of HMFO on colonic inflammation. Mucosal thickness is regarded as an indicator of normal mucosal conditions. Treatment with DSS causes epithelial injury and infiltration of inflammatory cells, such as mast cells [32] . Colonic inflammation and mucosal injury were assessed by pathological examination of the colon after H&E staining, and representative results are shown in Figure 2 (a). Representative colon tissue sections from mice in the control group showed intact surface epithelium, cryptal glands, stroma, and submucosa. However, colon sections from DSS-treated mice showed branched crypts, cryptitis, decreased numbers of crypts and goblet cells, inflammatory cell infiltration, and extensive submucosal edema. In contrast, HMFO treatment improved the signs of histological damage, such as abnormal crypts, crypt loss, and inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure 2(a) ). Mice treated with DSS alone had significantly elevated histological scores, compared with those of healthy control mice. However, the histological score decreased to approximately 57% of that in the DSS-treated group when treated with the highest HMFO concentration (200 mg/kg) (Figure 2(b) ). These results suggested that HMFO treatment protected against acute DSSinduced colitis. To evaluate the protective effects of HMFO against leukocyte infiltration in colonic tissue, we measured the levels of MPO, a marker of leukocyte infiltration in the colon tissue. MPO is an enzyme that is produced mainly by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and is specific to granulocyte lysosomes. Therefore, MPO is directly correlated with the number of neutrophils [33] . As shown in Figure 2 (c), DSStreated mice showed a significant increase in MPO activity compared to that in control mice, and this increase was drastically decreased in the HMFO-treated group. Therefore, the increase in MPO activity in tissues induced by DSS correlated with the development of colonic inflammation, and HMFO administration markedly suppressed MPO accumulation in colonic tissues.",

A key characteristic of DSS-induced colitis is the increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines into the serum [34, 35] ; thus, we measured serum cytokine levels in this study. Serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the DSS-treated group than in the control group. However, IL-6 levels in mice treated with HMFO (100 and 200 mg/kg) were lower than those in the DSS-treated group (Figure 3(a) ). Serum TNF-\u03b1 levels were also increased in DSStreated mice compared with the normal control group, while HMFO-treated mice had lower serum TNF-\u03b1 concentrations than DSS-treated mice (Figure 3(b) ). Moreover, immunohistochemistry analysis indicated that HMFO at 200 mg/kg markedly reversed the increase in IL-6-and TNF-\u03b1-positive cells (brown stained) in the colonic mucosa of DSS-induced mice (Figures 3(c) and 3(d) ). High levels of proinflammatory cytokine production are a major characteristic of DSS-induced colitis [34, 35] . In DSS-induced acute colitis, enormous infiltrates appeared in inflammatory lesions, mainly consisting of T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, which produce various proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and IL-17 [34, 36, 37] . In the colon of patients with IBD, markedly increased numbers of mast cells and macrophages were observed, and these cells might contribute to abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines and mediators, such as NO and TNF-\u03b1 [38] .",

The effects of HMFO on the expression of inflammatory proteins such as COX-2 and iNOS in cytosolic extracts from the colon of colitis mice were detected by Western blot analysis. As shown in Figures 4(a) and 4(b), iNOS and COX-2 expression levels significantly increased in the colon tissues from DSS-treated mice compared to those in normal mice. However, HMFO administration remarkably reduced iNOS protein upregulation and significantly decreased DSS-induced COX-2 expression, down to normal levels with different doses of HMFO (Figures 4(a) and 4(b) ). The COX-2 and iNOS enzymes represent important molecular targets in the treatment and prevention of IBD, and their expression and activity are associated with disease severity, suggesting their potential as anti-inflammation drug targets. During active inflammation, bacteria can enter the lamina propria due to cell destruction and increased permeability. Inflammatory cytokines and bacterial antigens induce and drive the transcription of both COX-2 and iNOS, and these proinflammatory enzymes are also upregulated in murine experimental colitis and active human IBD [39, 40] . Our data clearly demonstrated that colonic damage was associated with elevated expression of both COX-2 and iNOS proteins, and HMFO administration potently downregulated their expression levels. In a similar study, pomegranate polyphenols and resveratrol decreased COX-2 and iNOS overexpression in murine experimental colitis [41, 42] .",

NF-\u03baB is a major transcription factor that, by regulating the expression of multiple inflammatory and immune genes, plays a key role in host defense and chronic inflammatory diseases [43] . NF-\u03baB was activated in the mucosal cells of IBD patients [44] and in experimental colitis models [41] and, thus, may be an ideal target for UC therapy. Therefore, the effect of HMFO on NF-\u03baB activation in mice with DSS-induce colitis was investigated. DSS administration significantly elevated the phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p65 levels in the colon tissue compared to those in the control group. However, HMFO treatment drastically attenuated NF-\u03baB phosphorylation, which was comparable in HMFO-treated and control mice (Figure 4(c) ). These results suggested that The effects of HMFO on LPS-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages were investigated by measuring NO release into the culture supernatant, using the Griess reagent. As shown in Figure 5 (a), HMFO significantly decreased LPS-induced NO production in a dosedependent manner, with >58% inhibition at 25 \u03bcg/mL HMFO, a nontoxic concentration. NO is synthesized by iNOS and is a well-known proinflammatory mediator involved in various physiological and pathological processes. Suppression of NO production has been suggested as a new pharmacological strategy for treating inflammation-related diseases [45] . As shown in Figures 5(b) and 5(c), iNOS expression at both the mRNA and protein levels significantly increased following LPS stimulation. However, iNOS mRNA and protein levels in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages were significantly reduced by treatment with HMFO. These results indicated that HMFO suppressed NO production by suppressing iNOS gene expression in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. The iNOS gene is the primary regulator of NO production in macrophages, and iNOS inhibitors have been found to attenuate osteoarthritis [46] , periodontitis [47] , septic shock [48] , and other chronic inflammatory diseases.",

To examine the inhibitory effects of HMFO on NF-\u03baB activation, we measured nuclear NF-\u03baB and cytoplasmic IKK \u03b1/\u03b2 and I\u03baB \u03b1/\u03b2 levels by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 7 (a), stimulation of RAW 264.7 macrophages with LPS increased nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB; however, this effect was inhibited by HMFO treatment. Our findings indicate that HMFO decreased NF-\u03baB activation by blocking the nuclear translocation of p65 via IKK-\u03b1/\u03b2-dependent I\u03baB phosphorylation (Figures 7(c) and 7(d) ). NF-\u03baB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is constitutively expressed in many cell types, including cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage [52] . Nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB is involved in initiating the transcription of several genes, including TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS [53] .",

MAPKs play critical roles in regulating cell growth and differentiation, cellular responses to cytokines [54] , and modulating NF-\u03baB activity [55] . To investigate whether HFMO-dependent inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation and NO production occurred through the MAPK pathway, we examined the effects of HMFO on the LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and ERK by Western blot analysis. As shown in Figures 8(a) and 8(c), pretreating cells with HMFO inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 in a concentrationdependent manner. These results suggest that HMFO may inhibit NF-\u03baB activation and NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages by suppressing MAPK phosphorylation.",

Furthermore, HMFO ameliorated the pathological characteristics of colitis, such as shortened colon length, and significantly reduced the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Histological analysis indicated that HMFO improved the signs of histological damage such as abnormal crypts, crypt loss, and inflammatory cell infiltration induced by DSS. In addition, HMFO inhibited iNOS and COX-2 protein expression and the levels of phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p65 in the colon tissue of mice with DSSinduced colitis. These results indicated that HMFO attenuated inflammation both in vitro and in vivo primarily by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activation. Thus, our findings indicate that HMFO is an effective and promising remedy for IBDs, such as colitis.",
