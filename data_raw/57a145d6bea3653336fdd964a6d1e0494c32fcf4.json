            "text": "Respiratory viruses of human origin infect wild apes across Africa, sometimes lethally. Here we report simultaneous outbreaks of two distinct human respiratory viruses, human metapneumovirus (MPV; Pneumoviridae: Metapneumovirus) and human respirovirus 3 (HRV3; Paramyxoviridae; Respirovirus, formerly known as parainfluenza virus 3), in two chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) communities in the same forest in Uganda in December 2016 and January 2017. The viruses were absent before the outbreaks, but each was present in ill chimpanzees from one community during the outbreak period. Clinical signs and gross pathologic changes in affected chimpanzees closely mirrored symptoms and pathology commonly observed in humans for each virus. Epidemiologic modelling showed that MPV and HRV3 were similarly transmissible (R 0 of 1.27 and 1.48, respectively), but MPV caused 12.2% mortality mainly in infants and older chimpanzees, whereas HRV3 caused no direct mortality. These results are consistent with the higher virulence of MPV than HRV3 in humans, although both MPV and HRV3 cause a significant global disease burden. Both viruses clustered phylogenetically within groups of known human variants, with MPV closely related to a lethal 2009 variant from mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), suggesting two independent and simultaneous reverse zoonotic origins, either directly from humans or via intermediary hosts. These findings expand our knowledge of human origin viruses threatening wild chimpanzees and suggest that such viruses might be differentiated by their comparative epidemiological dynamics and pathogenicity in wild apes. Our results also caution against assuming common causation in coincident outbreaks.",

For example, respiratory disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Gombe Stream National Park, Tanzania [3, 4] and in Kibale National Park, Uganda [5] , two populations that have been studied continuously for decades. Mortality from anthroponotic respiratory pneumoviruses (family Pneumoviridae) and paramyxoviruses (family Paramyxoviridae) has been documented in western chimpanzees (P. t. verus) in Cote d'Ivoire [1, 6] , eastern chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii) in Tanzania [7] , mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in Rwanda, lowland gorillas (G. g. gorilla) in Central African Republic [8] and bonobos (P. paniscus) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo [9] .

At Ngogo, 43.8% of chimpanzees observed between 3 December 2016 and 28 February 2017 exhibited respiratory signs. At Kanyawara, 69.1% of chimpanzees observed during the same period exhibited respiratory signs. At Ngogo, 25 chimpanzees (12.2%) died during the outbreak period (Figure 1 ). In contrast, no chimpanzees at Kanyawara died during the outbreak period, with the exception of a female recovering from disease who died following conspecific aggression (see below).

At Kanyawara, the carcass of a 22-year-old female chimpanzee was recovered approximately 10 days after having recovered from respiratory signs (but still remaining weak), immediately after having been attacked by conspecifics (for unclear reasons). Post-mortem analysis of this individual showed severe, diffuse pleuropneumonia with fibrinous adhesions to the thoracic wall and severe consolidation of all lobes of both lungs, as well as a serosanguinous pericardial effusion ( Figure S4 ). Analysis of paired fecal samples (prior to and during the outbreak period) using a Luminex assay that tests for a suite of human respiratory agents revealed different viral etiologies for each community ( Table 2) . Metapneumovirus (MPV, Pneumoviridae: Metapneumovirus) was detected in 7 of 11 individuals (63.6%) from Ngogo chimpanzees exhibiting clinical signs during, but not before, the outbreak period (Fisher's exact P = 0.0030). Human respirovirus 3 (HRV3; Paramyxoviridae; Respirovirus, formerly known as parainfluenza virus 3) was detected in 5 of 14 individuals (35.7%) from Kanyawara chimpanzees exhibiting clinical signs during, but not before, the outbreak period (Fisher's exact P = 0.0005). Adenoviruses (Adenoviridae) were present in samples from both Ngogo (36.4%) and Kanyawara (78.6%) but showed no association with the outbreak period (Fisher's exact P = 0.4545 and 0.5291, respectively) and have been previously characterized in this population at comparable frequencies [10] . Enteroviruses (Picornaviridae) were also present at low frequency in samples from both communities, similarly showed no association with the outbreak period (Fisher's exact P = 1.000 in both cases), and have also been previously characterized in this population at comparable frequencies [10] .",

Moreover, avian influenza had recently been reported in waterfowl in Lake Victoria, on the other side of Uganda [34] . Our results highlight how heightened vigilance for emerging infectious diseases can sometimes lead to erroneous inferences. Common environmental drivers (e.g. weather, human visitation patterns) may precipitate simultaneous outbreaks of distinct anthroponotic viruses in wild apes, creating the appearance of a single disease with a seasonal pattern. Our results also suggest that the transmission of respiratory viruses between chimpanzee communities is probably uncommon, despite high rates of transmission within chimpanzee communities. Chimpanzees from neighbouring communities rarely interact [33] , which may limit opportunities for intercommunity transmission even of highly contagious microbes. MPV and HRV3 both represent significant burdens to global public health [35] . MPV infection in humans Table S3. causes coughing, nasal discharge and weight loss [36] ; in non-human models signs are often more severe than for other related viruses [37] . MPV also causes clinical disease in experimentally infected chimpanzees [38] and severe and sometimes lethal outbreaks of respiratory disease in wild chimpanzees and gorillas, often with similar demographic patterns of infection as we describe herein [1, 6, 7, 21] , as does a related virus, respiratory syncytial virus (Pneumoviridae, Orthopneumovirus) [1] . Our results show that this comparatively high virulence of MPV is recapitulated in naturally infected chimpanzees.",

Post-mortem analysis of one individual at Ngogo revealed surprisingly little gross pathology of the respiratory tract, consistent with acute infection and rapid death, and MPV was recovered from all sections of that individual's respiratory tract, including the lung parenchyma ( Figures S4  and S5 ). In contrast, post-mortem analysis of an individual at Kanyawara revealed advanced respiratory tract pathology, consistent with longer term infection ( Figure S5 ), but we did not recover HRV3 from this individual's respiratory tract despite recovering a complete HRV3 genome from this same individual's feces collected approximately 2 weeks earlier.

The Ngogo MPV variant clusters within a sub-clade of viruses that is more recent (2008-2017) than other sub-clades, perhaps reflecting antigenic replacement of MPV strains over time. Notably, the Ngogo variant is very similar to a virus from a fatal infection of a mountain gorilla in Rwanda in 2009 [21] . This particular viral lineage may thus have a propensity for infecting apes, or it may simply circulate widely in East Africa.

Tourism is sometimes cited as a risk for anthroponotic transmission of viruses to great apes and helps inform current International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recommendations for preventing such transmission, such as visitor vaccination requirements, minimum observation distances, alcohol-based sanitizing gel and facemasks [13] . However, neither Ngogo nor Kanyawara is a tourism site. Ngogo is bordered by a tourism site (Kanyanchu) receiving thousands of visitors each year, but there were no reports of a concurrent respiratory disease outbreak in the Kanyanchu chimpanzees, although similar events have occurred there at other times. At Gombe National Park in Tanzania, provisioning chimpanzees with bananas (a discontinued practice) was, along with season, the strongest predictor of chimpanzee respiratory signs [48] , which affected between 0% and 9% of chimpanzees per month between 2005 and 2012 [4] .",

The role of other species in transmitting these viruses from humans to chimpanzees is also unclear. Kibale National Park contains a diversity of primate species and social groups, none of which were observed with respiratory signs at the time of the outbreaks, but complex patterns of cross-species transmission from humans to chimpanzees cannot be discounted. Such possibilities could be investigated through broad sampling of people (especially research staff) and wildlife during future outbreaks, including serologic assessments of prior exposure.",
