This article describes national trends in seasonal influenza vaccine (IV) coverage in Portugal from 1998/99 to 2010/11, analyzes progress towards meeting WHO 2010 coverage goals, and addresses the effect of major public health threats of the last 12 years (SARS in 2003/04, influenza A (H5N1) in 2005/06, and the influenza A (H1N1)2009 pandemic) on vaccination trends. Methods: The National Institute of Health surveyed (12 times) a random sample of Portuguese families. IV coverage was estimated and was adjusted for age distribution and country region. Independence of age and sex coverage distribution was tested using a modified F-statistic with a 5% significance level. The effect of SARS, A (H5N1), and the A (H1N1)2009 pandemic was tested using a meta-regression model. The model was adjusted for IV coverage in the general population and in the age groups.",

There was no trend in coverage (p = 0.097). In the younger age group (<15 years) a declining trend was identified until 2008/09 (p = 0.005). This trend reversed in 2009/10. There was also a gradual and significant increase in seasonal IV coverage in the elderly (p for trend < 0.001). After 2006/07, IV coverage remained near 50%. Adjusting for baseline trends, there was significantly higher coverage in the general population in 2003/04 (p = 0.032) and 2005/06 (p = 0.018). The high coverage observed in the <15-year age group in season 2009/10 was also significant (p = 0.015). Conclusions: IV coverage in the elderly population displayed an increasing trend, but the 75% WHO 2010 target was not met. This result indicates that influenza vaccination strategy should be improved to meet the ambitious WHO coverage goals. The major pandemic threats of the past decade had a modest but significant effect on seasonal influenza vaccination. There was an increase in vaccine uptake proportion in the general population in 2003/04 and in 2005/06, and in individuals <15 years old in 2009/10.",

In the last 12 years three major pandemic threats, not all caused by influenza virus, affected public and healthcare professionals' perceptions of the need for influenza vaccine (IV) uptake. These pandemic threats were severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, \"avian influenza\" (influenza A (H5N1)) in 2005, and the recent influenza A (H1N1)2009 pandemic. The rapid worldwide dissemination of SARS in 2003 was a rehearsal for the next influenza pandemic [7] . In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the emergence and persistence of influenza A (H5N1) in birds and the associated human fatalities were a public health threat and fostered early response strategies to contain the pandemic [8] . In April 2009, the spread of novel swine flu origin influenza A (H1N1) prompted the declaration of a pandemic by WHO in June of the same year [9] . Whether this raised awareness had a positive or negative effect on IV uptake varies according to country and to situation [6, 10, 11] .",

Using the same sample for more than one consecutive season could lead to biased coverage estimates. Specifically, the application of the questionnaire to the same sample in two consecutive seasons could lead to a greater proportion of individuals who choose to be vaccinated the next season. This change in behavior could artificially increase IV coverage, which would not represent coverage in the general population. There is no evidence of this bias in our study, because in each population group, IV coverage increase was not consistent or systematic for the four periods between changes in the sample population (1998 to 2001, 2002 to 2005, 2006 to 2009, and 2010 to the present).",

There was significantly higher coverage in the general population for two seasons: 2003/04 (p = 0.032) and 2005/06 (p = 0.018). Coverage in the 2009/10 season was not significant (p = 0.084).Two coverage levels were significantly higher at the 5% confidence level: the IV uptake for the 45-64-year age group in the 2005/06 season (p = 0.044), and the vaccine uptake for the 0-14-year age group in the 2009/ 10 season (p = 0.015).DiscussionInfluenza vaccine coverage from 1998/99 to 2010/11Between 1998/99 and 2010/11, IV coverage in Portugal varied between 14.2% and 17.5%. There was no consistent increase in percent IV uptake in the general population (p for trend 0.097).During this time period(Figure 1,Table 3), there were four seasons that had notably higher IV coverage estimates: 2003/04, 2005/06, 2008/09, and 2009/10. However, except for 2003/04, these seasons did not have the highest coverage proportions in the elderly segment of the population (\u226565 years), for whom vaccination has been long recommended. The seasonal IV coverage increase in the general population was primarily due to an increase in coverage in the 45-64-year age group in the 2005/06 and 2008/09 seasons and to an increase in the <15-year age group in the 2009/10 season",

Therefore, seasonal IV coverage levels among individuals <15 years old remained low. For most of the seasons, it was <10%. There were four seasons with slightly higher coverage levels in this age group: the 1998/99, 1999/00, 2005/06, and 2009/10 seasons, with coverage point estimates of 12.1%, 14.6%, 11.3%, and 12.9%, respectively.Children are not considered to be a risk group for seasonal influenza. However, the general increased awareness related to the A (H1N1)2009 pandemic, and specific recommendations from Portuguese health authorities to vaccinate children may have affected seasonal vaccine uptake.
