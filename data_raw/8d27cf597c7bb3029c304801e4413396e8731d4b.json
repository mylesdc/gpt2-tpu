Vampire bats are the primary reservoir of rabies in Latin America, where the disease remains among the most important viral zoonoses affecting humans and livestock. Unpredictable spatiotemporal dynamics of rabies within bat populations have precluded anticipation of outbreaks and undermined widespread bat culling programs. By analysing 1146 vampire bat-transmitted rabies (VBR) outbreaks in livestock across 12 years in Peru, we demonstrate that viral expansions into historically uninfected zones have doubled the recent burden of VBR. Viral expansions are geographically widespread, but severely constrained by high elevation peaks in the Andes mountains. Within Andean valleys, invasions form wavefronts that are advancing towards large, unvaccinated livestock populations that are heavily bitten by bats, which together will fuel high transmission and mortality. Using spatial models, we forecast the pathways of ongoing VBR epizootics across heterogeneous landscapes. These results directly inform vaccination strategies to mitigate impending viral emergence, reveal VBR as an emerging rather than an enzootic disease and create opportunities to test novel interventions to manage viruses in bat reservoirs.",

A central impediment to forecasting the cross-species transmission of bat viruses and developing strategies for their control is the scarcity of data that could inform how these viruses are maintained in their bat reservoirs [2] . In particular, data from bats are usually collected from small geographical areas over short timescales, whereas the high mobility of bats can enable long-term viral persistence across large spatial scales [3] . By contrast, cross-species infections ('spillovers') can span large areas and timescales, but rarely occur at sufficiently high frequency to enable robust inference into transmission dynamics within bats and are often complicated by the possibility of onward transmission within spillover host species [2] .",

The widespread distribution of the vampire bat, from Mexico to Argentina, coupled with a mechanism for cross-species transmission (obligatory blood feeding behaviour) creates high economic, social and public health burdens of rabies across the region [5] . Although post-exposure vaccination of humans and pre-exposure vaccination of livestock are available and efficacious, they are not practiced at large scales [5, 6] . Instead, control of vampire bat-transmitted rabies (VBR) uses bat population control, either by indiscriminate killing and roost destruction or by government-led campaigns that use a poisonous paste, 'vampiricide', to kill bats that groom treated conspecifics or feed from the wounds of treated livestock [7, 8] . The efficacy of these programmes has been questioned by field studies showing that rates of VBR exposure in bats were equivalent or higher in culled colonies and independent of natural variation in bat colony size [9] . Further modelling work showed that apparently counterproductive effects of culling could arise because VBR persists not locally within a bat colony, but by viral dispersal between colonies [10] .",

            "text": "Identifying the precise nature of spatial dynamics and how these contribute to long-term viral persistence is critical to improving rabies control. Detection of epizootic expansions or seasonally varying transmission could help anticipate when and where spillover could occur, thereby enabling preventative vaccination of humans and livestock or interventions within the bat population ahead of outbreaks [11, 12] . Because rabies is not transmitted among livestock following infection by bats, livestock provide an ideal sentinel to study the spatiotemporal dynamics within the natural bat reservoir. To date, phylogenetic and time-series analyses of VBR in livestock have revealed contrasting patterns. Epizootics were reported in the north of Argentina in the 1970s [13] , but more recent analyses show continuous infection of livestock, indicative of enzootic persistence [5,9,12,14 -16] . However, incidence varies within enzootic zones and is speculated to be affected by natural and anthropogenic processes. On the one hand, livestock vaccination or bat culls could conceivably decrease the burden and transmission of VBR, respectively, if practiced intensively. Yet, land use and climate changes could offset these gains by providing greater availability of livestock (a key food resource for bats) and increasing minimal winter temperatures, which together limit the size and geographical range of vampire bats [17] . If VBR outbreaks are increasing, determining whether increases are caused by spatial expansions into previously uninfected areas or intensified transmission within enzootic zones is critical to appropriately allocate vaccines, surveillance and educational campaigns. The national surveillance system of Peru has documented the time and place of rabies infections in largely unvaccinated livestock populations since 2004. Because rabies transmitted by dogs is restricted to a small, isolated region of Peru, virtually all livestock cases are spillover infections from vampire bats [18, 19] . This unique dataset creates a remarkable opportunity to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying the perpetuation of VBR in bat populations and thereby inform control strategies across Latin America. Here, using high-resolution time-series data on VBR outbreaks, we: (i) resolve the spatiotemporal patterns underlying previously undetected increases in the burden of VBR in Peru, (ii) test whether increases are caused by spatial expansions or intensified transmission within historically enzootic zones, and (iii) assess patterns of how spatial expansions occurred across the landscape. Next, in an area of intensive VBR transmission in the Andes, we pair timeseries data with field data on bat -livestock contacts, vaccination and reporting practices to (iv) estimate the velocity of advancing epizootics of VBR on a heterogeneous landscape, and (v) forecast impending spillover risks to humans and livestock.",

Changes in the infected area over time were estimated using annual kernel densities with the bkde2D function of the KernSmooth package of R (bandwidth \u00bc 0.15 and grid \u00bc 200 \u00c2 200 km) [22] . In two valleys where data suggested an epizootic advance (Chalhuanca and Rio Apurimac, figure 4b), we tested whether spatial expansions followed a wave-like pattern using linear regressions between the time and the distance of outbreaks from the predicted index case. Because VBR persisted locally after invading new areas, we divided the landscape into equidistant hexagonal bins using the hexbin function (xbins set to 6) of the hexbin package in R and analysed the month of the first outbreak in each cell. We incorporated effects of spatial heterogeneity on VBR spread by calculating distances to index cases as least-cost distances based on a landscape resistance model, defined as the minimum distance along elevations ,3600 m, the maximum recorded elevation of D. rotundus roosts in the area (see the electronic supplementary material). A sensitivity analysis for this assumption using 200 randomly selected elevation thresholds from 3500 to 4500 m for each of the two valleys is provided in the electronic supplementary material. The index cases of each travelling wave were estimated by simulating 5000 random hypothetical origins of each wave and choosing the origin that maximized the R 2 of each linear regression [23] . Wavefront speeds were calculated as the inverse of the slope of the linear regression with the intercept set to zero.

In the region of the country where most outbreaks occur, the expansion forms multiple independent waves of infection that are travelling at consistent rates and trajectories towards communities where we document high contact rates between bats and unvaccinated livestock and poor knowledge of rabies. Widespread invasions into new areas and increases in the burden to human and animal health reveal VBR as an emerging rather than an enzootic zoonosis and mandate new strategies for rabies control in Latin America.",

The trigger(s) of these expansions are uncertain, but they are occurring throughout the country in transition zones between the Amazon and Andes and in valleys within the Andes (figure 3). One possibility is that growing livestock populations could have increased the size or connectivity of vampire bat populations, facilitating viral introduction [5] . However, livestock census data from 1994 and 2012 indicate no change in livestock densities in the newly infected districts (Peruvian National Livestock Census, CENAGRO). Another hypothesis is that rising temperatures due to climate change could expand bat populations and thus VBR to higher elevations [17] . Indeed, our GLMM shows that VBR is spreading on average to higher elevations. Importantly however, expansions occurred in areas well below the maximum elevation of VBR in other parts of the Peru (3600 mts), and the elevation of outbreaks did not increase in high elevation regions where VBR was enzootic throughout the time series (i.e. Apurimac and Ayacucho; figure 3) . Thus, we argue that for the slow invasion hypothesis, the travelling waves in the two focal valleys of AAC were initiated only in the last few years despite molecular evidence that VBR was present in northwestern parts of the region since the early 1970s and the evidence from our questionnaire study that vampire bats are already present in rabies-free parts of each valley [14] (figure 5a).",

Indeed, although translocation experiments show that vampire bats are physiologically capable of long distance movements, home range sizes are typically ,10 km 2 [9, 24, 28] . One remaining question is why waves are travelling at different rates in different valleys. Different patterns of between-colony bat movements in each valley driven by underlying differences in the distribution of bat colonies could influence wave speeds. However, valleys had similar distributions of farms and intensities of bites (electronic supplementary material, figure S5 ), suggesting that long distance dispersal of VBR is unlikely to be a limiting factor in either valley. Anthropogenic disturbances, particularly the intensity of bat culls, could also conceivably influence viral spread. On the one hand, culls could reduce the probability of dispersal by an infected bat by reducing infection prevalence or competition-driven dispersal. On the other hand, dispersal by survivors of culls could facilitate viral invasion into uninfected areas. A similar example of disturbance-driven pathogen spread was observed in the UK, where disruption of badger territorial boundaries by culling facilitated the spatial spread of bovine tuberculosis [29] . Finally, differences in wavefront speeds could potentially arise if viral strains with different infection phenotypes circulate in each valley. However, previous work showed that only one geographically isolated viral lineage has circulated in the AAC since the early 1970s [14] . Therefore, we suspect that the waves described here have a common evolutionary origin, and recent evolution is unlikely to explain the observed variation in wavefront speeds.",

Although our phenomenological models of rabies spread account for habitat heterogeneity using a least-cost distance algorithm, other methods exist for estimating wavefront speed. Statistical methods such as trend surface analysis are used over larger spatial and time scales than our data, where outbreaks are distributed along relatively short valleys. Spatially explicit mechanistic models have also been widely used to model rabies spread in carnivores in heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. [27, 31] ). Unfortunately, the dispersal distances of infected bats and the sizes of colonies are unknown, so parameterization of such a model for VBR would not be straightforward. Moreover, without additional data, such models would not be expected to alter our mean predictions.

The waves of VBR that we identify are important, because they are occurring in real time and are predictable in speed and trajectory, creating a powerful opportunity to direct the distribution of vaccines and educational campaigns to areas where infection is imminent (electronic supplementary material, table S1). Our results further open new possibilities for the control of a bat-borne zoonosis in its reservoir. While interventions such as culling have historically focused on enzootic areas, our findings enable targeting of healthy bat populations before viral invasion. Such a strategy was attempted in Argentina in the 1970s, but even with a dramatic 95% reduction of vampire bat populations using cyanide poisoning, the epizootic advanced [34] . This failure could reflect an absence of natural geographical barriers allowing the virus to circumnavigate the intervention zone or the challenges of using population reduction to control a pathogen with frequency-dependent transmission [9, 10, 35 ]. An appealing alternative would be to increase the proportion of immunized bats while maintaining the age structure and relatively sedentary dispersal behaviour of vampire bats. A transmissible gel-based topical rabies vaccine was effective in captive vampire bats but has never been released in wild populations [36] . Vaccination ahead of the epizootic front could be particularly effective when paired with natural geographical barriers such as the high Andean peaks that occur in the AAC.",

The number of infected districts also increased in annual (non-cumulative) reports, with most dramatic spatial expansions coinciding with the increase in outbreaks following 2011 (figures 1b,2). Hotspots of spatial expansion occurred in the regions of San Martin, Amazonas and Cajamarca in the north of Peru (5.2 districts yr 21 , s.d. \u00bc 0.36) and in Apurimac, Ayacucho and Cusco in the south (4.1 districts yr 21 , s.d. \u00bc 0.12). By contrast, few new districts were infected in the Amazonian regions of Loreto, Ucayali and Madre de Dios (1.4 districts yr 21 , s.d. \u00bc 0.21), where no new districts were infected in the last 3 years. Consistent with epizootic spatial expansions from enzootic zones, 85% of newly infected districts had a neighbouring district infected in the same or previous year. Significant increases in the elevation of VBR outbreaks occurred in regions containing transitions from the Amazon rainforest into the Andes mountains (i.e. Cusco, Cajamarca, San Martin and Ucayali). By contrast, the mean elevation of rabies outbreaks was unchanged in regions with only high (i.e. Apurimac and Ayacucho in the Andes) and low rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc. R. Soc. B 283: 20160328 (i.e. Madre de Dios and Loreto in the Amazon) elevations (figure 3). The model with a region by year interaction was more strongly supported than year \u00fe region (DAIC \u00bc 91.2), year alone (DAIC \u00bc 1790.33) and region alone (DAIC \u00bc 96.05).Our GLMM showed that, controlling for region as a random effect, the elevation of outbreaks generally increased through time (z-value \u00bc 2.93, p , 0.01). However in several regions (e.g. Ayacucho, Cusco), the minimum elevation of outbreaks decreased through time concurrently with increases in the maximum elevation of outbreaks, creating a funnel pattern which indicates that downhill invasions also occurred (figure 3).(b) Velocities of travelling waves of vampire battransmitted rabies in heterogeneous landscapes In the AAC, kernel density estimates showed a 74% increase in the spatial extent of VBR between 2003 and 2014, equivalent to a newly infected area of approximately 21 000 km 2 (figure 4c). Two different spatiotemporal dynamics of VBR were observed. In the north of the AAC (e.g. San Miguel, Huanipaca, Huancarama districts), VBR persisted enzootically via sporadic outbreaks through the duration of the time series, consistent with metapopulation dynamics proposed by Blackwood et al. [10] (figure 4a,b). By contrast, VBR only recently invaded districts in the south or southwest (e.g. Tintay, Mollepata, Circa). In the valleys of Chalhuanca and Rio Apurimac, strong linear relationships between the temporal and the least-cost spatial distance from each outbreak to the predicted index cases revealed wave-like expansions of VBR (figure 5). By the end of 2014, these waves had travelled 39 km in Chalhuanca (94 outbreaks since 2009) and 54 km in Rio Apurimac (45 outbreaks since 2012). Dispersal rates were strikingly consistent through time, as evidenced by high R 2 values in linear models within each valley (R 2 \u00bc 0.98 and 0.93 for Chalhuanca and Rio Apurimac, respectively; figure 5b).

Red lines show the AAC, including the Apurimac, Ayacucho and Cusco regions. (b) Pattern of monthly (main figure) and yearly (inset figure) outbreak reports across Peru, excluding regions where dog rabies is enzootic (Puno) and two regions on the coast (Lima and Ancash) that reported small numbers of unconfirmed outbreaks. rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc. R. Soc.

Uncertainty in the origin locations had little influence on wavefront speeds. Bootstrap estimates revealed similar speeds across all plausible origin locations, with estimations ranging from 14.3 to 20.4 km yr 21 (R 2 : 0.87-0.98) in Rio Apurimac and from 6.7 to 11.2 (R 2 : 0.96-0.99) in Chalhuanca (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). Likewise, estimates of wavefront speeds were insensitive to elevation thresholds in the landscape resistance models, with values across thresholds in the range of 16.5-17.9 km yr 21 (R 2 : 0.92-0.93) in Rio Apurimac and 7.8-9.2 (R 2 : 0.97-0.98) in Chalhuanca (electronic supplementary material,",
