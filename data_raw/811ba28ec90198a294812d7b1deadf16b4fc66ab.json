            "text": "The Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, has emerged as a global public health concern. Pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies against other flaviviruses could modulate immune responses to ZIKV infection by antibody-dependent enhancement, highlighting the importance of understanding the immunogenicity of the ZIKV envelope protein. In this study, we identified a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target domain III (DIII) of the ZIKV envelope protein from a very large phage-display naive antibody library. These germline-like antibodies, sharing 98%-100% hoLogy with their corresponding germline IGHV genes, bound ZIKV DIII specifically with high affinities. One mAb, m301, broadly neutralized the currently circulating ZIKV strains and showed a synergistic effect with another mAb, m302, in neutralizing ZIKV in vitro and in a mouse model of ZIKV infection. Interestingly, epitope mapping and competitive binding studies suggest that m301 and m302 bind adjacent regions of the DIII C-C\u2032 loop, which represents a recently identified cryptic epitope that is intermittently exposed in an uncharacterized virus conformation. This study extended our understanding of antigenic epitopes of ZIKV antibodies and has direct implications for the design of ZIKV vaccines.

            "text": "Understanding the human antibody response to ZIKV is central to the development of effective vaccines and serodiagnostics. [9] [10] [11] [12] Threedimensional cryo-electron microscopy structures of ZIKV reveal that it shares a high structural similarity to other flaviviruses with known structures. 13, 14 The ZIKV envelope (E) glycoprotein, which was found to be a dimer on the surface of a mature virion, mediates viral entry, membrane fusion, and serves as the major target for neutralizing antibodies. 15 Recent studies have revealed that critical targets of neutralizing antibody responses to flaviviruses are conformational or quaternary epitopes that require higher-order structures not presented on E monomers. [16] [17] [18] Similar to other flaviviruses, the E protein of ZIKV comprises three domains: a central \u03b2-barrel domain (domain I, DI), an extended dimerization domain (domain II, DII), and an immunoglobulin-like domain (domain III, DIII). Previous studies on DENV-challenged mice showed that DIII-specific antibodies form a significant fraction of neutralizing antibodies and possess highly neutralizing activity. 19, 20 Intriguingly, it was found that the neutralizing human antibodies mainly recognize quaternary structuredependent epitopes presented on the intact virion in human immune sera; 21 however, the majority of antibodies produced during a primary infection of individuals are non-or poorly neutralizing antibodies that are typically recognized by the fusion loop or bc-loop on DII of the E protein 22, 23 and may cause antibody-dependent enhancement. 6, 24 For instance, pre-existing DENV immunity was found to be highly crossreactive to ZIKV and potently increase the subsequent infection of ZIKV. 6, 24 These findings highlight the importance of directing antibodies specifically against ZIKV DIII to prevent and treat ZIKV infection.",

[25] [26] [27] [28] The current study sought to develop ZIKV DIII-specific fully human mAbs with novel properties and minimal divergence from their germline predecessors. To do this, we chose recombinant ZIKV envelope DIII as the antigen for panning a very large na\u00efve IgM library (containing~10 11 antibodies) constructed from the blood of healthy adult donors. We identified a panel of antibodies that bound ZIKV DIII with high avidities ranging from low-nanomolar to subnanomolar and exhibited weak to moderate neutralizing potency. The most potent mAb, m301, broadly neutralized the American and Asian ZIKV strains circulating in the 2015-2016 outbreak. Combination of m301 with another mAb, m302, showed a synergistic effect in neutralizing ZIKV in vitro and in a mouse model of ZIKV infection. Interestingly, m301 and m302 bound adjacent regions of the DIII C-C\u2032 loop, which represents a recently identified cryptic epitope according to the structure of the mature flavivirus virion. Though cryptic, this epitope is speculated to be intermittently exposed in an uncharacterized virus conformation. Further immunogenetic analysis suggests that m301 and m302 are germline-like antibodies with~98% identity to the germline IGHV3-30 gene and that the fast and effective elicitation of such antibodies by immunization is promising. These results may be relevant for the understanding of antigenic epitopes of ZIKV antibodies, and the design of effective ZIKV vaccines and serodiagnostics.",

ZIKV DIII was produced and biotinylated at a specific site for use as a target antigen during bio-panning ( Figure 1A ). Antibody selection from the naive human Fab library was performed as previously described. 29 After four rounds of panning, potent enrichment was achieved, as indicated by a polyclonal phage ELISA ( Figure 1B) , and a panel of 12 DIII-specific Fabs with various binding affinities was identified using a soluble expression-based monoclonal ELISA ( Figure 1C ). Among these antibodies, four unique high-binding clones (m301, m302, m303, and m304) were selected for further characterization and converted into a full-length human IgG1 format. All antibodies were reactive to recombinant DIII or E glycoprotein in Western blot analyses, suggesting that m301-m304 mAbs might recognize linear epitopes on ZIKV DIII ( Figure 1D ). We next measured the binding kinetics of these mAbs to the recombinant DIII protein using biolayer interferometry by Octet-RED (Pall ForteBio). As shown in Figure 2A , all four antibodies exhibited high DIII-binding avidities. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) of m301 for DIII was 0.2 nM with an on-rate (k on ) of 2 \u00d7 10 5 per M per s and off-rate (k off ) of 4 \u00d7 10 \u2212 5 per s. The m303 mAb displayed a binding pattern similar to that of m301 with a K D of 0.15 nM. The m302 and m304 mAbs had much faster off-rates (k off 2 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 and 3 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 per s, respectively), and m302 had the slowest on-rate among the four mAbs (k on 4 \u00d7 10 4 per M per s). Consequently, m302 had a measured K D of 47 nM, and m304 had a K D of 4 nM.

Immunogenetic analysis of their sequences was performed using the IMGT tool to determine the closest VH and VL germline genes ( Figure 3 , Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S1 ). Analyses of germline gene usage indicated that they originated from different B-cell lineages. Furthermore, their nucleotide sequences displayed 98%-100% IGHV identity to the germline ( Table 1 ). The few somatic mutations were located in the N-terminus of the antibody heavy chain. These were positioned far from the CDR regions and did not appear to affect antigen binding (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S1 ). Therefore, all four antibodies were germline-like mAbs, which, in general, exhibit lower immunogenicity and better druggability properties compared to somatically hypermutated antibodies. 38 While the patterns of VDJ gene segment usage were diverse among the four antibodies, three of them shared the same IGHV3-30 germline gene with slight differences between allelic variants (m301 and m304, IGHV3-30*03; m302, IGHV3-30*04). Interestingly, the germline V-gene IGHV3-30 was frequently used by a number of human neutralizing mAbs isolated from individuals infected with flaviviruses, including West Nile virus, 39 DENV, 40 and ZIKV. 41 To further investigate the IGHV3-30 recombination frequency with specific IGHD and IGHJ genes among other germlines, we analyzed in detail the deep sequencing data of our antibodyome studies on naive IgM repertoires of 33 healthy adult donors and neonatal IgM repertoires of 10 newborn babies (unpublished). As expected, we observed a high IGHV3-30 recombination frequency with various IGHD and IGHJ genes. Notably, 32 unique VH clones were successfully identified as sharing a VDJ recombination pattern similar Figures S3  and S4 ). In contrast, only seven unique clones were related to m303, the antibody that utilized the IGHV3-64D germline gene (Supplementary Figure S5) . Taken together, these results suggest that the elicitation of these germline-like antibodies, especially the IGHV3-30 lineage m301-and m302-like antibodies, could be relatively quick and effective by immunization of ZIKV DIII-based immunogens.",

In comparison, m302 had modest neutralization activity, while m303 and m304 did not show any evident neutralization against ZIKV SZ01. To determine the breadth of neutralization of m301, we also tested its neutralizing activity against a panel of representative circulating ZIKV strains in addition to Asian lineage SZ01, including R103451 (Honduras strain), PRVABC59 (Puerto Rico strain), H/PAN/2015 (Panama strain), and FLR (Colombia strain). We found that the DIII of all these circulating strains is highly conserved, with only one mutation from the PRVABC59 strain (Supplementary Figure S6 ). Indeed, m301 was able to neutralize all these strains with similar potency, suggesting that m301 is a broadly neutralizing anti-ZIKV antibody ( Figure 4B ).

To test this hypothesis, we performed binding competition experiments using biolayer interferometry. The biosensors labeled with ZIKV DIII were saturated with a mAb analyte in solution, followed by the addition of a second mAb in Figures 5A-5D , m301 competed with m304 for binding to DIII, but not with mAbs m302 and m303. Neither m302 nor m303 showed any competition with the other three mAbs. Furthermore, m302 exhibited a much slower binding phase compared to the other three mAbs, which is consistent with its 10-fold lower k on value, as observed in the DIII binding assay ( Figure 2 ). These data reveal three distinct epitopes on DIII. Although m301 and m304 may recognize overlapping epitopes, the much lower neutralizing activity of m304 could be attributed to its 20-fold lower DIII binding avidity. Taken together, these results suggest that m301 and m302 bind different epitopes on DIII and thus may have a synergistic effect in inhibiting ZIKV infection. Indeed, an enhancement in the neutralization of an antibody cocktail (m301 in combination with m302) was detected compared with that of either m301 or m302 alone at the same concentration, indicating a moderate synergistic effect of m301 and m302 on ZIKV neutralization ( Figure 4D ).",

The structure of m301 was generated by homology modeling based on the crystal structure of a human germline antibody sharing 97% amino-acid sequence identity with m301, while m302 was built based on another germline antibody with 93% sequence identity. 34 The structures were energy-minimized in a water box and then docked onto the crystal structure of the ZIKV E protein DIII. 25 Interestingly, we found that both m301 and m302 engaged the 'C-C\u2032 loop' encompassed by C-and C\u2032-strands and their connecting loop, but in different directions and spatial locations ( Figure 6A ). As shown in Figure 6B , the epitopes of m301 and m302 on DIII were different, but mostly concentrated on the C-C\u2032 loop (9 and 12 residues, respectively). This result explains the competitive binding between m301 and m302 on DIII, but relatively moderate synergistic effect when used in combination for ZIKV neutralization. Analysis of antibody contact residues indicates that m301 binding is dominated by light-chain CDR usage, whereas m302 primarily used heavy-chain CDRs engaging DIII. To further localize the m301 epitopes, a panel of DIII alanine scanning mutants was generated. The binding of m301 to these mutants was measured by ELISA. Substitutions of four residues in the C-C\u2032 loop could significantly reduce the binding activity of m301 to DIII, including M345, P354, G356, and L358 ( Figure 6C ), indicating that these four residues are involved in the epitopic composition.",

Interestingly, the binding pattern of m301 on ZIKV DIII remarkably resembled that of DENV neutralizing antibody E111 on DENV DIII, which was isolated from mouse serum after immunization with a strain of DENV-1 virus. 42, 44 Similarly, the C-C\u2032 loop epitope recognized by E111 was completely inaccessible in all DENV virion models. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the cryptic C-C\u2032 loop epitope could be intermittently exposed in an uncharacterized virus conformation via a process named 'viral breathing'. Through this process, antibodies targeting completely inaccessible epitopes on the mature virion can still neutralize flavivirus infection. 43 Recently, mouse mAbs recognizing C-C\u2032 loop epitopes were also identified after immunization with ZIKV. 25 Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that m301 and m302 target an uncharacterized virion structure and moderately neutralize ZIKV via viral breathing. In vivo protection study Adult wild-type mice are not naturally susceptible to experimental infection with ZIKV. 45 Recently, we developed a lethal mouse model of ZIKV infection using C57BL/6 mice deficient in IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and \u03b3 receptors, named AG6 mice, which were successfully used in the establishment of a DENV infection mouse model. 46 In this study, we used this model to assess whether neutralizing mAbs could protect against ZIKV infection in vivo.",

Twelve hours later, they were treated (i.p.) with a single dose of either 0.5 mg m301 or a cocktail of m301 and m302 (each 0.25 mg) or PBS (control). This was followed by daily monitoring for well-being (weight loss and other clinical manifestations) and mortality. In the first 6 days, mice in the antibody groups were significantly more active and healthier than mice in the control group. At day 7, all mice in the control group suffered from complete loss of mobility, while only two mice in the m301 group and one in the cocktail antibody group appeared to have signs of limb paralysis. All others appeared healthy. However, all mice died within 10 days in spite of the considerable difference in clinical manifestations between the antibody groups and control group (Figures 7A and 7B) . At day 8, five of six mice from the control group (16.6% survival) died, and three of six mice from the m301 group (50% survival) or cocktail antibody group (50% survival) died. At day 9, all mice from the control group and m301 group had died, while only one mouse from 47 Therefore, to evaluate prophylactic efficacy, AG6 mice were inoculated with a cocktail of antibodies (0.25 mg m301 and 0.25 mg m302) and then challenged (i.p.) 4 h later with 10 3 PFU of ZIKV strain SZ01, instead of 10 5 PFU as used in the therapeutic study. Similar to the previous challenge, 10 3 PFU of ZIKV also resulted in 100% mortality within 9 days (Figures 7C and 7D ). One mouse from the control group died at day 7, and three more died at day 8 (33.3% survival). In comparison, three of six mice from the cocktail antibody group died at day 8 (50% survival). The remaining three mice did not show signs of limb paralysis, but they did exhibit reduced mobility, albeit to a lesser extent than the remaining two mice in the control group. The absence of significantly prolonged survival in the treatment groups could be attributed to the high sensitivity of the IFN-deficient mice to ZIKV infection. Residual virus load could also cause lethal infection in mice in the absence of complete neutralization of viruses by the anti-ZIKV mAbs. This interpretation is supported by a recent finding that even the lowest dose inoculum of 1 PFU of ZIKV virus resulted in 100% mortality. 47 Interestingly, in one study, all mice receiving different doses of ZIKV (from 10 4 to 10 0 PFU) died at the same time point (100% mortality at day 8), 47 which is consistent with our current findings. In another study, instead of using immunedeficient transgenic mice, the authors evaluated ZIKV-neutralizing mAbs in wild-type mice treated with an anti-IFN-\u03b1-receptor mAb, in which the mice exhibited less severe signs of disease and lower mortality compared to the IFN receptor knockout mice. 25 A more dramatic difference between antibody groups and the control group would likely be observed in such a model.",

However, FLE is the immunodominant epitope in the ZIKV E protein, and most ZIKVspecific antibodies in infected patients were found to be FLE antibodies. 27 It is therefore arduous to direct specific and potent immune responses to certain epitopes of DI/II without the elicitation of cross-reactive antibody-dependent enhancement antibodies.",

[25] [26] [27] Zhao et al. reported a panel of mAbs isolated from immunized mice with infectious ZIKV and recombinant DIII. These mAbs specifically bound to three distinct epitopes on DIII and efficiently inhibited the infection of African, Asian, and American ZIKV strains. Furthermore, those mAbs targeting the DIII lateral ridge region conferred complete protection in ZIKV-infected mice. 25 However, fully human mAbs with minimal immunogenicity in patients would be preferable. Except for isolating neutralizing antibodies from infected or vaccinated subjects, combinatorial antibody libraries and phage/yeast display-based technologies have revolutionized human antibody selection with high binding activity and novel properties. 29 Herein, through bio-panning of a human Fab library with ZIKV DIII, we successfully selected and characterized a panel of novel germlinelike human mAbs with high affinity and specificity against ZIKV DIII. This is the first study to use a phage display screen to identify human antibodies against ZIKV. The four mAbs (m301-m304) recognized three distinct epitopes on DIII and displayed functionally different properties. Since germline mAbs typically exhibit good druggability and low to no immunogenicity, these antibodies, especially the most potent neutralizing mAb, m301, have the potential for further development as antibody-based therapeutics, either alone or in combination with other DIII-or E protein-targeting human mAbs.",

Instead, m301 most likely engages the cryptic C-C\u2032 loop epitope in a manner similar to that of the DENV-1specific neutralizing mAb E111. 42 Residues on the C-C\u2032 loop are intimately involved in lateral E protein contacts on the mature virion surface.

            "text": "The structural and functional characterization of identified antibodies has implications for the design of effective ZIKV vaccines. E protein DIII was once considered to be the antigen of choice for vaccine development. 53, 54 However, in a number of studies, it was found that the use of recombinant flavivirus DIII as subunit vaccines only elicited poorly neutralizing antibodies targeting the AB loop of DIII. 19, 55 These findings suggested that the human antibody repertoire against flaviviruses may actually be directed away from these DIIIneutralizing epitopes, especially an epitope on the lateral ridge region of DIII recognized by many of the strongest flavivirus-neutralizing antibodies. 56 Therefore, DIII subunit vaccines are not among the leading candidates (and recently approved) for dengue vaccines, nor are they prominent among platforms leading the way for ZIKV vaccine design. 11, 57, 58 Our results indicate that antibodies targeting the cryptic C-C\u2032 loop are inherently less protective against ZIKV infection in vitro and in vivo than previously described potent neutralizing antibodies targeting the upper lateral surface of DIII. Although the binding affinities were very high, the neutralizing activities were low. Consistent with low neutralizing activities, these antibodies have only modest protection in mouse models. These results suggest that such antibodies targeting the cryptic epitope on DIII of the ZIKV E protein are probably not suitable as therapeutic agents against ZIKV. As human antibodies targeting the C-C\u2032 loop also exist in ZIKV-infected patients, a current priority is to understand whether such novel antibodies contribute to protective immunity in vivo, followed by translating this information into the design of more effective DIIIbased vaccine candidates.",
