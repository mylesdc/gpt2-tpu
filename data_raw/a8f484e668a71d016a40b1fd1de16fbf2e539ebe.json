The majority of patients in this study were under the age of 5 (776, 63\u00c15%). Most patients were enrolled in Vietnam (n = 826, 67\u00c16%). The median age was higher in Indonesian patients as compared to those from Vietnam and Thailand (16 year, versus 4 year and 2 year, respectively). One hundred and 67 patients (13\u00c17%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU); ICU admission data from 232 patients were unknown (Indonesia: 223; Thailand: 2; Vietnam: 7). Sixtyseven patients (5\u00c15%) were mechanically ventilated and the overall reported in-hospital mortality was 2\u00c14% (n = 29). Detected bacterial pathogens were M. pneumoniae (n = 33, 2\u00c17%), C. psittaci (n = 2), C. pneumoniae (n = 1), B. pertussis (n = 1) and L. pneumophila (n = 2). Fluctuations in frequencies were found in particular months for several viruses, with RSV occurring from July to November 2008 and rhinovirus peaking in March 2009 ( Figure 2 ). Due to differences in age group representation, the number of viral agents detected per patient was lower in Indonesia (60/225, 0\u00c127) than in Vietnam (800/826, 0\u00c197) and Thailand (151/171, 0\u00c188). Likewise, the proportion of identified viral agents detected that were RSV was higher in Thailand and Vietnam than in Indonesia (24/151, 15\u00c19%; 117/800, 14\u00c16%, respectively, compared with 3/60, 5%) whilst coronavirus was a greater proportion of identified viral agents in Indonesia (7/60, 11\u00c17%) than Thailand (3/151, 2\u00c10%) and Vietnam (11/800, 1\u00c14%). See Table S1 for pathogens detected by country. There were 234 of 1222 patients (19\u00c12%) who had at least two pathogens detected (bacterial and/or viral). Of these, 170 patients were found to have two pathogens, 54 patients had three pathogens, nine patients had four pathogens, and one patient had five pathogens. The frequency of each pathogen is shown in Table S2 . The pathogens most commonly detected in patients with two or more pathogens were bocavirus (n = 132) and rhinovirus (n = 123). The proportion of patients who had either a virus or a bacterium detected appeared to decrease with age, with the highest proportion of pathogens detected in the 0-4 age group, but increased again in those older than 65. Most viral pathogens were more common in children, with parechovirus and parainfluenza virus 4 only found in children (Table 2) . M. pneumoniae was found only in patients younger than 45 years, whilst both cases of C. psittacii occurred in patients 45 years and above.",

This rate of detection is lower than previously published data, where detection varied from 13% to 26%. 27, 28 However, as we did not include serological diagnostic methods for atypical bacteria, the true prevalence in our patients may have been higher. The most commonly detected atypical bacteria in this study were M. pneumoniae, followed by C. psittaci and L. pneumophila. The results from our study are similar to the aetiological studies of community-acquired pneumonia in Singapore and Malaysia, in which M. pneumoniae was the commonest atypical pathogen detected. 29 Very little is known about the epidemiology of C. psittaci in SEA, and indeed this pathogen has only very recently been described as causing human disease in Vietnam. 30 The type of pathogen detected was significantly associated with the duration of hospitalisation. Atypical bacteria and in particular infection with M. pneumoniae was associated with longer duration of hospitalisation. The age of the patients was also significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalisation, with the >65 years age group requiring longer admissions. This probably corresponds with increasing comorbidities and decreasing immunity with age, similar to other regions in the world. No clear seasonality was seen with the various pathogens detected, but rates of infection appeared to be higher in the winter and spring months and a study over a single year may miss seasonal trends. Rates of influenza virus A increased in Indonesia and Vietnam in April 2009 coinciding with an epidemic of seasonal H3N2 influenza in Vietnam, prior to the first sporadic cases of H1N1pdm09 detected at the end of May 2009. 31 The strengths of this type of study include the large numbers of patients who were enrolled prospectively from three different countries in South-East Asia allowing an overview of the viral and atypical bacterial causes of ILIs in the region. This study also used RT-PCR techniques; however, an important limitation was the lack of microscopy and sputum cultures for common bacteria associated with ILIs such as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type b and serology for atypical pathogens. Also, limited clinical data were recorded for these cases, making it difficult to assess the clinical significance of the various pathogens detected and the virulence of each pathogen. Although swabs from all patients meeting our eligibility criteria were analysed, we have no data concerning the number of patients who may have been admitted with ILI but not swabbed. The lack of clinical data also limits comparison between sites as differing admission criteria may impact on the distribution of pathogens. Similarly, both the lack of clinical data and the absence of data concerning overall admission limit our ability to interpret the findings relating to ICU admission; the finding that adult patients were overrepresented amongst those admitted to ICU could represent differential routine sampling of adults and children on such units; however, we feel this is unlikely. There was a lack of data related to patients and co-morbidities, such as immunosuppression and COPD, which could also have had an impact in the severity of infection seen. Furthermore, a lack of suitable control patients also limits our ability to determine the attributable fraction of ILI that is likely to be caused by each virus and also prevents useful analysis of the relevance of the high rates of nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type b.",
