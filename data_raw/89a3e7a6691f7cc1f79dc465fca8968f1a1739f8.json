Several factors such as variable and nonspecific clinical manifestation, existence of large number of serovars and asymptomatic hosts spreading infection, poor sanitation and lack of an effective vaccine make prophylaxis difficult. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective vaccine to halt its spread all over the world. In this study, an immunoinformatics approach was employed to identify the most vital and effective immunogenic protein from the proteome of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain L1-130 that may be suitable to stimulate a significant immune response aiding in the development of peptide vaccine against leptospirosis. Both B-cell and T-cell (Helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)) epitopes were predicted for the conserved and most immunogenic outer membrane lipoprotein. Further, the binding interaction of CTL epitopes with Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) was evaluated using docking techniques. A Molecular Dynamics Simulation study was also performed to evaluate the stability of the resulting epitope-MHC-I complexes. Overall, this study provides novel vaccine candidates and may prompt further development of vaccines against leptospirosis.",

The current research for developing recombinant and subunit vaccines are mostly focused on leptospiral motility, outer-membrane proteins (OMPs), lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and virulence factors 15 . These proteins have been recognized as playing major role in the interaction of pathogens with host cells and possibly associated with pathogenesis; hence, is the major focus of current vaccine research. Among these, significant protection in the hamster model has been reported with several outer membrane proteins, including LipL32 and the leptospiral immunoglobulin-like proteins (Lig) [16] [17] [18] . However, protective efficacy of these candidates was limited and also had failed to induce cross-protection and sterile immunity. Therefore, a highly conserved target that can stimulate both humoral and cell mediated immunity against leptospirosis is crucial for the development of an effective vaccine. The current status of leptospiral vaccine development demonstrates that there is an urgent need for the discovery of new effective vaccine candidates to provide immunity against majority of serovars 18 .",

The amino-acid composition revealed that the protein has 10,261 atoms comprising Carbon (3181), Hydrogen (5058), Nitrogen (896), Oxygen (1121) and sulphur (5) . The aliphatic index was calculated as 77.22. The grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) was calculated to be negative (\u22120.328). This negative value indicates the hydrophilic nature of protein and most of the residues to be located on the surface; hence this protein tends to have better interaction with other proteins. The secondary structure analysis of protein revealed that the protein is dominated by random coils (55.09%) followed by extended strand (23.15%), alpha helix (12.69%) and beta turns (9.07%).

The Ramachandran plot analysis of refined structure revealed that 80.3% of residues were located in most favoured region followed by 15.4% in allowed and 1.8% in generously allowed region, while only 2.5% of the residues were in disallowed region. However, ProSA-Web calculated Z-score of \u22122.97 indicating the model was not in the range of native protein conformation ( Fig. 2(C) ). Furthermore, the ModFold6 sever was used to evaluate the overall quality of the model (Table 3 ). (Table 4 ). In addition, maximum residual score for each amino acid residue was also predicted.

Proline and Valine at the 400 th and 401 st positions, found in the antigenic peptide 394 KYEVLLPVAAVPT 406 , was identified as having the highest antigenic residual score of 1.208. It should be noted that the epitopes 20 MKKILILLIALSFAVFGCSHK 40 and 42 KGILLPFLTLLNQ 54 were recognized as allergic to human; henceforward, they could not be considered as vaccine candidates. Fortunately, within 617 WAILVPGA 624 and 5 YSSSFILIIKKG 16 epitopes, some residues were also predicted as conformational as well as CTL epitopes, so can be considered as good candidates for peptide vaccine design. Moreover, the result indicated that the average antigenic propensity score of the predicted epitope was 1.008 while the minimum and maximum score was 0.855 and 1.208 respectively.

Prediction was made for Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR (HLA-DR) alleles and only strong binder (SB) epitopes having IC 50 value < 50 nM with high binding affinity to HLA-DR, were considered. As a result, a total of 33 SB T-cell epitopes for the query sequence were predicted and are shown in Supplementary Dataset Table S3 . It has been known that the binding strength of HTL epitope to the HLA-DR is a key factor in immunogenicity of the T-cell epitope and a good T-cell epitope candidate should interact with maximum number of HLA alleles 41, 42 . Therefore, based on the highest number of HLA-DR binding alleles, the top 10 epitopes were selected as putative HTLs (Table 6 ). Of these, epitope sequence 17 YRVMKKILI 25 interacting with highest number of HLA-DR alleles (336 alleles) can be considered as a good candidate for subunit-vaccine design. On the other hand, the peptide sequence 48 FLTLLNQDA 56 interacting with 120 alleles was predicted to be allergenic to human; hence, could not be considered for vaccine design. Moreover, the conservancy of all selected epitopes were found in the range of 2.17 to 95.65%, representing 46 serovars of pathogenic Leptospira spp. The epitope 565 IVFNSPVKK 573 interacting with 132 HLA-DR alleles was predicted to be at the highest conservancy level (i.e. conserved among 44 serovars). Details of predicted HTL epitopes along with their binding HLA-DR alleles are shown in Supplementary Dataset Table S3. CTL Epitope prediction. Cytotoxic-T-lymphocytes (CTLs) are critically one of the vital instigators of cellular immunity and play an important role in eliminating the infected cells. Hence, to identify the potential T-cell epitope that is recognized by CD8+ T-cell and stimulate both long-lasting and exclusive cytotoxic immune response, NetCTL 1.2 server 43 was employed. This server identifies the epitope candidates by using artificial neural network and calculates a combined score for a peptide sequence based on their MHC-I binding affinity, proteasomal C-terminal cleavage and TAP transport efficiency all together 43 . Herein, a total of 12 peptide sequences were predicted as CTL epitopes whose prediction scores were greater than 0.75 (Table 7) . Of these, epitopes 438 STVAYEDLY 446 , 299 QIGSIPFTY 308 and 619 ILVPGAWKY 627 have also been predicted to be antigenic and were conserved among 46 serovars of pathogenic species, which suggest that they could be promising vaccine candidates. In addition, they were predicted to have positive immunogenicity, wherein the positive score of immunogenicity signifies the high potentiality to stimulate strong CTL response. The peptide sequence 526 SSSDLNLGI 534 was predicted as antigenic for human, so cannot be considered for vaccine design. The details of predicted CTL epitopes with their IEDB immunogenicity score, conservancy value and allergenicity are shown in Table 7 .",

            "text": "The global incidence of leptospirosis is increasing year by year, from an initial estimate of approximately 500,000 cases in 1999 44 , to over a million of severe cases in humans, resulting in ~60,000 fatalities in 2015 3 . To overcome this disease burden, there is an urgent need of improved preventive measures against the disease. Vaccination is one of the most effective means to efficiently, rapidly and affordably improve the public health and the most feasible way to eradicate this infectious disease. The search for effective vaccines to prevent leptospirosis has been on-going for many decades 15 . Despite this, the development of broadly effective vaccines against leptospirosis remains desirable and yet challenging task due to the wide array of antigenic diversity among pathogenic species 12 . The currently available vaccines against leptospirosis consist of whole-cell inactivated and formalin-killed leptospires (bacterin). However, these vaccines often show severe side-effects and are unable to stimulate cross-protection against different serovars and hence, their efficacy is limited. Therefore, current vaccine research is mostly focused on peptide and subunit vaccines as compared to whole organism vaccines because subunit vaccines contain specific immunogenic components of the pathogens responsible for the infection rather than the whole pathogen, which may result in severe side-effects. In Leptospira, vaccine targets include OMPs, lipoproteins and transmembrane proteins. Indeed, the most promising vaccine candidate so far described is the surface protein Lig, while OM LipL32 is the most studied leptospiral protein 15 . However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates was limited and failed to induce cross-protective immunity. Therefore, the identification of other, more conserved, immunogenic OM proteins would be highly desirable for the development of cross-protective vaccine against leptospirosis. It is well-known that in Leptospira, OMPs exhibit high level of conservancy and are associated with pathogenesis; therefore, likely to be the most promising and successful candidates for peptide vaccines.",

            "text": "This study aims to screen and scrutinize the most antigenic OMP of the LIC, one of the most studied pathogenic Leptospira strains 14 , and to predict the possible antigenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes for epitope-based or peptide vaccine development by using in silico proteome wide-screening strategy. Several researchers have used in silico approach for identifying and designing of vaccine candidates [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] and some of them achieved promising clinical trial results (for example ref. 30 ). Screening using in vitro assays further reduces the number of vaccine candidates and hence, the number of laboratory animals required for efficacy testing. With immunoinformatics approaches, it is now feasible to screen the entire antigenic repertoire of a pathogen that could progress the discovery of potential vaccine candidates and may eventually improve existing vaccines. In our study, 21 proteins were predicted as highly immunogenic (antigenicity score > 1). Of these, two proteins (Q75FL0 and 52 . In addition, the LruC lipoprotein was found to be conserved among pathogenic Leptospira species. Thus, lipoprotein Q75FL0 could be the most promising new vaccine candidate for leptospirosis because of common and important features, including OM localization, conservation, and eliciting antibody production in patients 52, 53 . Vaccination, or immunization works by stimulating antigen specific B-cells or CTLs and HTLs immune response. Consequently, B-cells, HTLs and CTLs epitope were predicted in the Q75FL0 lipoprotein. An effective peptide-based vaccine should contain both B-cell and T-cell epitopes to be able to elicit humoral and cellular immunity respectively. Several researchers have identified combined B-cell and T-cell epitopes of Leptospiral OMPs for diagnosis and vaccine purpose (see for example refs 54, 55 ). In our study, a number of peptides were predicted as comprising both B-cell and T-cell epitopes including 5 YSSSFILIIKKG 16 , 301 GSIPFTYNTVQTIPLNLVVTD 321 , 434 AEGVSTVAYEDLYPSA 449 , 522 TKTVSSSD 529 , 576 LGSYPYDIFIKVI 588 and 617 WAILVPGA 624 , thus could induce humoral as well as cell mediated immunity and hence, can be considered for the development of peptide vaccines against leptospirosis. Furthermore, surface accessibility, surface flexibility as well as hydrophilicity for the B-cell epitopes have also been predicted in the current study. B-cell based vaccines provide antibody-mediated immunity which can be easily overwhelmed by surge of antigens. However, HTL plays a crucial role in inducing vital humoral or CTL responses and confer long-term immunity; hence, critical requirements for effective vaccine design. The response to T-cell epitopes is restricted by HLA proteins. HLAs are highly polymorphic i.e. the frequency of expression of different HLA types varies in different ethnic human populations. Therefore, to elicit broad immune responses in different human populations, the HLA specificity of T-cell epitopes must be considered as major criteria for screening of the epitopes 56 . Consequently, the epitope candidate should bind to the maximum number of HLA alleles to get more population coverage. Hence, in this study 10 HTL epitopes that bind to the maximum number of HLA alleles were selected as putative HTL epitope candidates. The main adaptive immunity against bacteria was thought to be primarily humoral i.e. mediated by B-cell or CD4+ cell 8 . However, humoral immunity is not far enough to completely clean the infection, cell-mediated immunity is needed to induce cell death and completely destroy the bacterial habitat. Although pathogenic Leptospira is not considered as a typical intracellular pathogen, indeed some bacterial proteins may be able to escape from the phagolysosome and reach to the cytosol of host cells and are exposed to the host CD8+ T-cells response, as reviewed in ref. 57 . Though, recent studies have reported that cell-mediated immunity is involved in the protective immune response stimulated by the Leptospira pathogen or vaccines 58, 59 . In the current study, one of the CD8+ restricted CTL epitope, 619 ILVPGAWKY 627 having high degree of conservancy among 46 serovars of pathogenic Leptospira, has also been predicted as antigenic site of linear B-cell and showing significant binding interaction with HLA-A*0201 protein; thus, considerably enhancing the possibility of this peptide to be a vaccine candidate. As per our knowledge, this immunoinformatics study represents novel vaccine candidates that will further aid in the development of improved vaccines for leptospirosis.",

I-TASSER generated five alternative 3D models of protein and assigned confidence score (C-score) for each model that infers the quality of the structure. The modelled protein with the highest C-score was refined and subjected for its quality assessment. The 3D model was refined by using GalaxyRefine server (http://galaxy.seoklab.org/). This server refines the modelled structure by reconstructing side-chain conformations followed by repacking and dynamics simulations to repeatedly relax the structure. GalaxyRefine has been evaluated as one of the best method to improve the local quality of the structure. This server can improve local and global quality of the models generated by structure prediction servers such as I-TASSER. Furthermore, to evaluate the refined model, quality assessment of the model was done by using three different servers viz. PROCHECK 64 , ProSA-Web 65,66 , and ModFold6 67 . PROCHECK was used to analyse the stereochemical quality of the model by evaluating the Ramachandran plot of the protein structure; whereas, ProSA-Web and ModFold evaluated the overall quality of the model. ProSA-Web calculated the overall quality score of the model by analysing their atomic coordinates which is frequently employed in protein tertiary structure validation.

B-cell epitope is the main antigenic region of an antigen which are recognized by the B-cell receptors of the immune system and are able to induce humoral immune response, which cause the B-lymphocytes to differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma and memory cells 69 . B-cell epitopes can be categorized as a linear (continuous) and conformational (discontinuous) based on their spatial structure. The Kolaskar & Tongaonkar method at Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) analysis resource (http://tools.iedb.org/main/bcell/) was applied to predict linear B-cell epitopes. The accuracy of this method to predict epitope is about 75% 35 . Flexibility, surface accessibility and hydrophilic properties are also important characteristics of B-cell epitopes 70 ; hence, to predict these properties, Emini surface accessibility 36 , Karplus and Schulz Flexibility 37 and Parker hydrophilicity 38 prediction methods were employed respectively with default parameters of IEDB analysis resource. ElliPro (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/toolsElliPro/) from IEDB analysis resource was used for prediction of the conformational B-cell epitopes with minimum score value set at 0.70, while the maximum distance was set as default. This method predicts epitopes based upon solvent-accessibility and flexibility 39 .

In addition, this peptide was found to be conserved among 44 serovars of pathogenic Leptospira. Molecular interactions of the top three docked complexes with CTL-epitopes and HLA-A*0201 are shown in Fig. 4. The detailed analysis of other docked complexes is shown in supplementary Table S4. Further, the molecular interaction analysis of these predicted CTL epitopes (other eight CTL epitoes) docked to HLA-A*0201 protein are shown in supplementary Fig. S5. Also, the binding mode of each epitope to HLA-A*0201 proteins for all 11 complexes are shown in supplementary Fig. S6.
