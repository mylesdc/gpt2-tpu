            "text": "Mutation rates can evolve through genetic drift, indirect selection due to genetic hitchhiking, or direct selection on the physicochemical cost of high fidelity. However, for many systems, it has been difficult to disentangle the relative impact of these forces empirically. In RNA viruses, an observed correlation between mutation rate and virulence has led many to argue that their extremely high mutation rates are advantageous because they may allow for increased adaptability. This argument has profound implications because it suggests that pathogenesis in many viral infections depends on rare or de novo mutations. Here, we present data for an alternative model whereby RNA viruses evolve high mutation rates as a byproduct of selection for increased replicative speed. We find that a poliovirus antimutator, 3D G64S , has a significant replication defect and that wild-type (WT) and 3D G64S populations have similar adaptability in 2 distinct cellular environments. Experimental evolution of 3D G64S under selection for replicative speed led to reversion and compensation of the fidelity phenotype. Mice infected with 3D G64S exhibited delayed morbidity at doses well above the lethal level, consistent with attenuation by slower growth as opposed to reduced mutational supply. Furthermore, compensation of the 3D G64S growth defect restored virulence, while compensation of the fidelity phenotype did not. Our data are consistent with the kinetic proofreading model for biosynthetic reactions and suggest that speed is more important than accuracy. In contrast with what has been suggested for many RNA viruses, we find that within-host spread is associated with viral replicative speed and not standing genetic diversity.",

While interspecies mutation rates range from 10 \u22124 to 10 \u22126 errors per nucleotide copied [4] , studies of antimutators and hypermutators suggests that fidelity can only vary by several-fold within a species [27] . The severe burden of mutational load exerts a strong downward pressure on mutation rates, and hypermutator strains are attenuated in vivo [9, [28] [29] [30] [31] . Given the short generation times and remarkable fecundity of many RNA viruses, a small kinetic cost to higher fidelity should result in strong selection against antimutators [32, 33] . However, the observed attenuation of antimutator RNA viruses in vivo has led many to argue for the adaptive benefit of high mutation rates, as genetic diversity provides a rich substrate for a virus's evolution in the face of varying intrahost environments [7, 10, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . This concept is central to viral quasispecies theory, which generally proposes a link between genetic diversity and viral fitness [24, 25] .",

The 3D G64S mutant of poliovirus was selected after serial passage in ribavirin, an RNA virus mutagen. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, 3D) of this variant contains a single glycine to serine substitution [5] [6] [7] . The basal mutation rate of 3D G64S is reported to be approximately 20% to 30% that of wild-type (WT) virus. While the 3D G64S mutant is attenuated in poliovirus receptor (PVR) transgenic mice, the relative importance of replicative speed and fidelity to this phenotype is not clear [7, 36] . Biochemical assays of 3D G64S suggest a physicochemical cost of high fidelity, but as in other systems, its contribution to overall fitness remains unquantified [6, 19, 39] .",

This is a moderate fitness defect, falling in the 64th percentile in a dataset of 8,970 fitness values obtained for point mutants of poliovirus under similar conditions [16] (e.g., human epithelial cells [HeLa] multiplicity of infection [MOI] 0.1, 8-hour infection cycle, and 6 passages; Fig 1B) . We also measured the relative growth properties of WT and 3D G64S using a plaque-size assay, which measures the growth, burst size, and spread of individual viruses in the absence of competition [40] [41] [42] . The distribution of clonal plaque sizes was significantly different (p < 0.005; unpaired t test with Welch correction; n = 272 WT and n = 220 3D G64S plaques) and consistent with a moderate fitness defect in 3D G64S (Fig 1C) . In contrast with prior work, we were able to detect a significant replication defect for 3D G64S by one-step growth curve, but only with rigorous synchronization, more frequent time points, and larger numbers of replicates ( Fig 1D) . This replication defect was not specific to HeLa because we observed a similar lag for 3D G64S in a 3T3 cell line [16] . \" \u00c3 \" indicates the relative fitness (0.78) and percentile (64th) of 3D G64S .

Here, the fitness gain from increased replicative speed is offset by a reduction in fitness due to increased mutational load. We derived a quantitative model of this trade-off (see S1 Text Model 1) by measuring the replicative fitness ( Fig  1F) and mutation rate (Fig 1G, S1 Table) of WT and 3D G64S under exposure to an exogenous mutagen, ribavirin [43] . WT and 3D G64S had equal fitness at approximately 150 \u03bcM ribavirin. Based on these data, our model indicates that WT incurs a fitness cost of 0.137 from mutational load alone. Therefore, any fitness benefit of the high baseline mutation rates in WT would presumably need to offset this cost. In 3D G64S , the cost of mutational load is reduced to 0.037.",

Two mutations-U6261C/3D I92T and A6813G/3D K276R -met these criteria, and their frequencies at passages 30 and 50 suggest that the I92T mutation may have arisen first. The 3D I92T mutation, which was found in both r-selected WT (3 out of 5) and 3D G64S (5 out of 5) lineages, did not change either fitness or mutation rate appreciably in the 3D G64S background (Fig 2C and 2D ). The r-selected K276R substitution, which was found in 3D G64S lineages (4 out of 5) and not in WT populations, decreased overall fitness in both WT (0.92 \u00b1 0.03; p = 0.0031 versus WT; t test) and 3D G64S (0.55 \u00b1 0.03; p = 0.005 versus 3D G64S ; t test).

The G64S/I92T/K276R triple mutant had a significant increase in fitness (0.7637; p = 0.0012 versus 3D G64S ; t test) and mutation rate (8.71 \u00d7 10 \u22126 s/n/r; p = 0.0120 versus 3D G64S ; t test) compared to 3D G64S and each double mutant.

These data suggest that, despite its 2-fold reduction in mutation rate, 3D G64S is not mutation limited and that, in the absence of strong selection, any adaptive benefit of a higher mutation rate is countered by the fitness cost of increased mutational load (see Fig 1F and 1G and associated model above). We next compared the phenotype of WT and 3D G64S viruses in vivo, where the ability to generate genetic diversity may allow a virus to escape host immune restriction and to replicate better in a range of environments. The available data have suggested that the attenuation of 3D G64S and other high-fidelity variants in experimental models is attributable to differences in the genetic diversity of the infecting population [7] . In this earlier work, viral Speed-fidelity trade-off diversity in the inoculum was manipulated using exogenous mutagen-2 passages in ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil followed by propagation in the absence of mutagen over 2 additional passages.

Therefore, we can exclude any significant differences in standing genetic diversity between our WT and 3D G64S populations.

Both viruses were able to access the CNS efficiently through this route over a range of doses ( Fig 4B, S2 Table) , but there was a clear delay in the 3D G64S group (p = 0.0239, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001 for 10 5 , 10 6 , and 10 7 pfu inocula, respectively). This lag persisted even when we infected with doses 20-fold higher than the median lethal dose (LD 50 ) of 3D G64S (S3 Table) . The difference in 3D G64S attenuation compared to prior work [7] does not appear to be due to the mouse model used because other studies in cPVR mice have reported results similar to those presented here [36, 54] . Both viruses spread to the CNS and replicated to high titers after intravenous inoculation, although WT titers in the brain and spinal cord were marginally higher at 5 days post infection (Fig 4C, p = 0 .0012 for brain and p = 0.0221 for spinal cord, Mann Whitney U test). We characterized the mutations present in the CNS populations of 12 spinal cords of intravenously infected mice (Fig 4D, 7 WT and 5 3D G64S ). Most mutations were rare, none were shared among mice, and there was an excess of synonymous or noncoding variants relative to nonsynonymous ones.

Using 3 different assays, we identified a significant fitness cost to higher fidelity and directly link this cost to viral replication kinetics. Our quantitative model of the speed-fidelity trade-off suggests that selection for replicative speed has pushed viral mutation rates to a level that imposes a significant fitness cost at baseline due to lethal or highly deleterious mutations. Consistent with the trade-off model, direct selection for increased replicative speed led to indirect selection of polymerases with higher mutation rates. The genetic interactions are quite strong because the 2 compensatory mutations exhibited reciprocal sign epistasis. The speed-fidelity trade-off in the poliovirus RdRp appears to be a generalizable phenomenon because compensatory mutations that increased the replicative speed of the 3D K359H antimutator also increased its mutation rate (Table 1) . Given the structural similarity among viral RdRp, the polymerases of other RNA viruses are likely to be subject to the same speed-fidelity trade-off, and we predict that the molecular mechanisms governing polymerase kinetics and mutation rate will be similar. Speed-fidelity trade-off Trade-offs are essentially constraints that force one parameter to change with another. In this case, viral mutation rate changes with replicative speed [55] . Similar trade-offs are central to the kinetic proofreading hypothesis, which posits a close relationship between the error rates of biosynthetic processes and the kinetics of their component reactions [56] . Studies of DNA replication and protein translation suggest that these systems optimize speed over accuracy as long as the error rates are within a tolerable range [57, 58] . We find a similar phenomenon in viral RdRp, in which the WT generates an extraordinary amount of mutational load, largely because of the benefit in replicative speed.",

Similarly, we find that the proposed link between within-host genetic diversity and virulence is confounded by the fact that faster replicating viruses are both more virulent and have higher mutation rates. The high mutation rates of RNA viruses and the highly deleterious fitness effects of mutations ensure that most genetic diversity is extremely rare and unlikely to be consistently maintained in the face of intrahost and interhost bottlenecks [53] . We do not dispute that virus populations will harbor minority variants, that a subset of these mutations may be adaptive or beneficial to the virus, and that some may be virulence determinants. However, the observation of genetic diversity is not in and of itself evidence that selection has optimized mutation rates for the future benefit of novel mutations. Indeed, our data show little adaptive benefit to a marginally increased mutation rate and identify no plausible mechanism whereby the observed increase in rare genetic diversity can influence pathogenesis. We suspect that RNA viruses are subject to other trade-offs of evolutionary significance, perhaps between polymerase speed and recombination rate or between recombination rate and polymerase fidelity. Here too it will be important to define the selective forces at play, thereby separating the causes from the consequences.",

Primary MEFs were derived from PVR mice. Day 13.5 embryos were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The heads and viscera were removed, and the body was minced with a sterile razor blade, trypsinized, and homogenized by pipetting with a 10 ml serological pipette. Cells were plated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1x penicillinstreptomycin, and 1x glutamine. An immortalized cell line was derived from PVR MEFs following the 3T3 protocol [60] . Briefly, freshly thawed MEFs were plated in 30 T25 flasks at a density of 3.8 \u00d7 10 5 cells per flask in complete DMEM. Every third day, cells in each flask were trypsinized, counted, and transferred to fresh flasks at a density of 3.8 \u00d7 10 5 cells per flask. As the cellular population began to increase (passages 13-15), cells were expanded into larger vessels and ultimately frozen down at passage 17.",

For the experiment in Fig 1A, HeLa cells were plated in 12-well plates, at a density of 2.6 \u00d7 10 5 per well the day prior to infection. Cells were infected at a total MOI of 0.1 with an equal TCID 50 of WT and 3D G64S . Three replicate wells were infected with each pair of viruses in 250 \u03bcl for 1 hour with occasional rocking. After 1 hour, the inoculum was removed and 1 ml fresh media applied. Passage 1 virus was harvested after an additional 7 hours (8 hours since infection). The titer of the passage 1 virus was used to calculate the dilution factor necessary to maintain an MOI of 0.1 for the subsequent 5 passages. RNA was harvested from each passage using Trizol (Ambion 15596026). Random hexamers were used to prime cDNA synthesis with 1/10 of the RNA. Each cDNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR using 3 different primer and/or probe sets with duplicate PCR reactions for each sample and primer set. The first set-COM2F 5' CATGGCAGCC CCGGAACAGG 3'' and COM2R 5' TGTGATGGATCCGGGGGTAGCG 3'-was used to quantify total viral genomic RNA in an SYBR green reaction (Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix; Thermo 4368708). Two custom TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) were used to quantify the number of WT and 3D G64S genomes. Duplicate wells were averaged, and relative amounts of WT and 3D G64S RNA were determined by normalizing the cycle thresholds for each of these probes to those of the COM primer set (\u0394Ct = Ct Virus \u2212 Ct COM ). The normalized values for virus passages 1-6 were then compared to passage 0 to obtain a ratio relative to P0 (\u0394\u0394Ct = \u0394Ct PX \u2212 \u0394Ct P0 ). This relative Ct value was converted to reflect the fold change in the ratio (\u0394ratio = 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct ). The change in ratio of the mutant relative to the change in ratio of the WT as a function of passage is the fitness ([\u0394log ratio Mut \u2212 \u0394log ratio WT ]/time).

Each fluctuation test was performed with 29 replicate cultures in 48-well plates. A total of 65,000 HeLa cells per well were plated the day prior to infection. In all cases, the media were changed to serum-free media 3 hours prior to infection. For infections in ribavirin, this serum-free media also included drug at the specified concentrations. Each well was infected in 200 \u03bcl volume with 1,000 to 4,000 pfu per well depending on the virus and experimental condition. Five independent aliquots were also saved for subsequent titering (see N i below). For infections in ribavirin, the infection media also included drug at the specified concentrations. Infected cells were incubated for 7 hours and then frozen. The lysed cells and media were harvested following 3 complete freeze-thaw cycles and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The empty wells were rinsed with 300 \u03bcl of complete growth media and combined with the initial 200 \u03bcl lysate. This 500 \u03bcl lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 1,400 \u00d7 g for 4 minutes. Twenty-four wells were titered by plaque assay with 1 mM guanidine hydrochloride in the overlay (see P 0 below). Five wells were titered by standard plaque assay without guanidine hydrochloride (see N f below). The mutation rate, \u03bc 0 , was estimated from these data using the P 0 null-class model: \u03bc 0 = \u2212lnP 0 /(N f -N i ), where P 0 was the fraction of the cultures that yielded no guanidine-resistant plaques, N f was the average number of pfu in the absence of guanidine, and N i was the average number of pfu in the inoculum. As described in [65] , \u03bc 0 can be converted to the mutation rate in nucleotide units by correcting for the mutation target (number of mutations leading to the scored phenotype, T) and the number of possible mutations at each target site (constant, 3) using the equation \u03bc = 3\u03bc 0 /T. The number of distinct mutations that could yield the guanidine-resistant phenotype was determined empirically by isolating and sequencing the entire 2C open reading frame for 15 guanidine-resistant plaques derived from WT virus and 15 guanidine-resistant plaques derived from WT virus treated with 200 \u03bcM ribavirin. In each case, we found 6 mutations that mediated resistance, although there were 7 total among 30 plaques (S1 Table) .",

The fitness values of WT and 3D G64S populations were measured by competition assay, as above, using samples from passages 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20. For PVR-3T3 cells, serial passages were performed as follows. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 7.6 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well the day prior to infection, yielding approximately 1 \u00d7 10 6 the day of infection. Serial passage lineages were initiated with passage 1 stocks of either WT or 3D G64S , and each passage was performed at an MOI of 0.5 in 1 ml for 1 hour. After 1 hour, the inoculum was aspirated, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and 2 ml of fresh growth media were applied. Viruses were harvested at 24 hours and titered every fourth passage to ensure an MOI of 0.5. There were 5 replicate lineages of WT and 3D G64S .",

For each sample, amplification of all 4 fragments was confirmed by gel electrophoresis, and equal quantities of each PCR product were pooled. Seven hundred and fifty nanograms of each cDNA mixture were sheared to an average size of 300 to 400 bp using a Covaris S220 focused ultrasonicator. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra DNA library prep kit (NEB E7370L), Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter A63881), and NEBNext multiplex oligonucleotides for Illumina (NEB E7600S). The final concentration of each barcoded library was determined by Quanti PicoGreen dsDNA quantification (ThermoFisher Scientific), and equal nanomolar concentrations were pooled. Residual primer dimers were removed by gel isolation of a 300 to 500 bp band, which was purified using a GeneJet Gel Extraction Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific).

The clonal control was a library prepared in an identical fashion from the pEW-M plasmid and was sequenced in the same flow cell to control for batch effects. True positive SNVs were identified from the raw output tables by applying the following filtering criteria in R: (i) Bonferonni-corrected p < 0.01, (ii) average MapQ score on variant reads >20, (iii) average phred score on variant positions >35, (iv) average position of variant call on a read >62 and <188, and (v) variant frequency >0.001.

Fitness values (!3 replicate competition assays for each data point) were determined for populations from every fifth passage (panel A) or every fourth passage (panel B), and the adaptability in the top panels was expressed as the slope of the regression for log10 fitness over time for each of 5 independent lineages of WT (filled circles) and 3D G64S (open circles, blue) for each cell line. The bottom panels show all the data from the 5 lineages together with the regression of log10 fitness over time. Exact p-values for the difference between the slopes for WT and 3D G64S on HeLa (0.0129) and PVR-3T3 (0.0013) were derived from a mixed linear effects model (see Methods).

(A) Maximum likelihood optimization of a simple binomial model (see S1 Text Model 2) estimated an average inoculum to CNS bottleneck size of 2.67 (lambda 2.44; 95% CI 1.39-3.82) based on experimental data for 4 barcoded poliovirus populations [49]. Shown are outputs of 10,000 simulations of the model (number of mice with 1, 2, 3, or 4 barcodes represented in the CNS). Each simulation represents 27 mice, and each mouse has a bottleneck size drawn from a zero-truncated Poisson with an average lambda of 2.43 (blue) or 10 (magenta).
