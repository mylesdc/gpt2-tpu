Western blots and/or ELISAs using ZIKV specific reagents should be used to characterize the supernatants. Although the methods section indicates that Western blot analysis was performed with cell supernatants, all Western blots presented (Figures 2, 3 , S2) include only cell lysates. This is particularly relevant for the E only vaccine candidates. Prior studies of other flaviviruses indicate a critical role for prM in proper folding and release of the E protein in mammalian cells (shown for TBEV in Allison et al., PMID: 10364309 and 7637027). Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that the ZIKV E only constructs were not effective immunogens as they could be improperly folded/ not released from cells. The inclusion of the E only vaccine candidates could potentially be removed altogether.",

The immune response and protection induced by these viruses was analyzed in mice. The manuscript is well written and results are consistent.

            "text": "Pg 7: The presentation of the Zika envelope protein structure is very poor. Authors should explain that it is composed of an ectodomain, consisting of three domains (I, II and III), and stem and transmembrane regions. They could cite the reference of Sirohi et al, Science 2016, which investigated the structure of the virus. Such explanation could perhaps be inserted in the introduction section and in results or materials and methods authors could indicate which part was deleted in truncate E proteins. Did they remove all stem and transmembrane regions? In fig. S2 one band corresponding to the NS1 protein should also not be present in rVSV-prM-E-NS1 infected cells? Pg 11: In the last sentence authors affirmed that results demonstrated that inoculation with rVSV-prM-E-NS1 induced high antibody levels 1 or 2 weeks after inoculation, but this is not what we observe in fig 3. As we see in fig 3, antibody levels in this group were similar to those detected in mice immunized with truncated E protein without prM. Pg 15: Authors affirmed that results demonstrated that co-expression of NS1 enhances Th2 and Th17 responses but they should also comment that in this group the IFN-g was also higher comparing to the other groups ( fig 6B) , suggesting a Th1 response. It seems that the presence of NS1 lead to a more balanced response including both Th1 and Th2 cells. Pg15/16: Authors affirmed that the mtdVSV-based vaccines were safe, but, as we saw in fig S4, animals immunized with rVSV-G1670A-prM-E also lost body weight. Overall, they should be more cautious in asserting about the safety of these viruses based on the present study. Pg 17: Why did authors immunized A129 animals by the intramuscular route while BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally? Is it because A129 are more susceptible and the intranasal route would lead to high morbidity and death? Standard deviations should be inserted in several graphs (Figs 3, 5A, S1, S3, S4, S5), informing it in figure legends.",

Although the methods section indicates that Western blot analysis was performed with cell supernatants, all Western blots presented (Figures 2, 3, S2) include only cell lysates. This is particularly relevant for the E only vaccine candidates. Prior studies of other flaviviruses indicate a critical role for prM in proper folding and release of the E protein in mammalian cells (shown for TBEV in Allison et al., PMID: 10364309 and 7637027).

We have now provided the Western blot data to characterize the ZIKV antigens released in cell culture supernatants (Please see Fig.S3 and Fig.2D and E) . Please see lines 189-195, and lines 288-292. All recombinant VSVs coexpressing prM and E/E truncations released a high level of E/E truncation in supernatants, even without the need for concentration of the supernatants. This suggests that E/E truncations were highly expressed by the VSV vector and were secreted into cell culture medium. In contrast, E/E truncations were undetectable in the supernatants when they were expressed without prM. This is consistent with previous observations that prM plays a critical role in proper folding and release of the E protein for TBEV (Allison et al., PMID: 10364309 and 7637027). These papers have been cited. For our manuscript, we used rVSV-E alone as a control. We showed that E alone was not an effective vaccine candidate when it was tested in mice.",

However, at late time points (weeks 4 and 5), we found that the DNA vaccine was capable of triggering high antibodies, consistent with previous studies. The efficacy of DNA vaccine may be affected by many factors such as the plasmid vector, adjuvant, and delivery strategy. Previously, two publications showed that a Zika DNA vaccine encoding prM-E was effective in triggering ZIKV-specific immune response and provided sufficient protection against ZIKV challenge. Larocca et al., (2016) showed that a high titer of ZIKV E-specific ELISA antibody was detected at week 3 when BALB/c mice was immunized intramuscularly with 50 \u00b5g of DNA vaccine. However, antibody titer at the early time points (weeks 1 and 2) was not reported in their studies. Dowd et al., (2016) showed that high titer of ZIKV antibody was detected at week 2 in mice when the DNA vaccine was delivered by electroporation. In addition, antibody triggered in C57BL/6 by a DNA vaccine was higher than that in BALB/c mice. We have now discussed these articles in the revised manuscript. Please see lines 547-557.",

We showed that ZIKV NS1 modulated ZIKV-specific antibody and T cell immune response, and provided the evidence that NS1 alone can provide partial protection against ZIKV infection in A129 mice. As suggested by Reviewer#3, we have now constructed rVSV-G1670A-NS1 and showed that rVSV-G1670A-NS1 provided substantial protection against ZIKV-induced viremia (please see our response to Reviewer #3 for the detail). Previously, NS1 proteins of several of other flaviviruses (such as Dengue virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus) can provide partial or complete protection against the virus challenge. Our results are consistent with the previous observations of NS1 proteins in other flaviviruses. Response: Yes, we have now used arrows to indicate the ZIKV VLPs and VSV ( Fig.1E and  Fig.S5 ). As suggested by Reviewer#3, we also purified ZIKV virions and performed an EM analysis. An EM image of native ZIKV virion was shown for comparison with ZIKV VLPs. Please see lines 221-224. 8.

To achieve more attenuation, we can use mutations in MTase active site (such as D1762A, K1651A, and E1833Q), which were detective in both G-N-7 and 2'-O methylation.

After intranasal inoculation, VSV infects olfactory neurons in the nasal mucosa and subsequently enters the central nervous system (CNS) through the olfactory nerves and disseminates to the brain. Thus, when designing the experiment in A129 mice, we chose intramuscular route for vaccination to reduce the side effect. In addition, it was known that intramuscular route was effective for delivery of VSV into mice. Importantly, our results showed that 10 5 PFU (2,000 higher than the lethal dose) of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 was completely attenuated in A129 mice, whereas rVSV-G1670A-prM-E still caused some weight losses.

At day 7 post-ZIKV challenge, viremia was cleared in mice vaccinated with rVSV-G1670A-NS1, whereas significant viremia was still detectable in pCI-NS1 group. Please see lines 478-499.",

            "text": "In the original submission, our results indicated that pCI-NS1 is capable of providing partial protection against ZIKV challenge in A129 mice. This is based on the fact that (1) pCI-NS1 showed less body weight loss, ZIKV associated symptoms, and encephalitis compared to the pCI control (Fig.6A, B, and C, and Fig.7G) ; and (2) pCI-NS1 group had statistically less viremia (in the brain, lung spleen and uterus) compared to the pCI control (Fig.7B-F) . It should be noted that we used a very high dose (10 5 PFU) of ZIKV for challenge experiments in A129 mice. In the published literature, several ZIKV researchers have used 100 or 1000 PFU of ZIKV for challenge experiment in A129 mice (Lazear et al., 2016; Aliota et al., 2016). Since A129 is highly susceptible to ZIKV infection, the level of immune response induced by pCI-NS1 may not be strong enough to confer complete protection against a high dose of ZIKV challenge. Our future experiments will compare the ability of NS1 alone (delivered by VSV vector or DNA vaccine) to protect against different doses of ZIKV challenge in A129 mice. Finally, the partial or even complete protection induced by NS1 alone has been reported for several of other flaviviruses such as West Nile virus, Dengue virus, and yellow fever virus.",

However, this has raised significant issues with some of the constructs used in the study. The authors include a leader sequence prior to the start of prM in all rVSV constructs that include the prM protein. But the E-only and NS1-only constructs should also be preceded by leader sequences, yet are not. The lack of a leader sequence likely explains why the full length E only construct is not detected even in the cell lysates of infected cells (Fig. 1D) , as it is not being directed to the correct cellular compartment. The use of rVSV-E as a \"negative control\" is an odd choice, because the full length, membrane bound E protein would not be predicted to be a useful immunogen regardless (even if it had the proper leader sequence), because it would not be secreted. The rVSV-NS1 construct has the same issue; NS1 is not a cytoplasmic protein, but is directed into the ER lumen during polyprotein translation. With the exception of the prM-containing constructs, any protective effects of the NS1-alone constructs (or non-protection with the E-alone construct) used in the current study are based on expression of viral proteins in a manner that does not occur during virus replication. There is no description of the ZIKV sequences used to generate the pCI plasmid constructs, so it is assumed that the pCI-NS1 also lacks a leader sequence.",

Additionally, subviral particles are formed in vivo, yet the text suggests that they are only recombinantly expressed (line 84). The expression of prM followed by truncated E results in the secretion of soluble E. The expected immunogens (subviral particles versus soluble E) are not acknowledged clearly throughout the manuscript. This is particularly evident in the lack of any Western Blot analysis for prM or M, which should be visible in the cell lysates and supernatants of the prM-E constructs.",

Fig.S6 has 12 groups and it is difficult to separate each group. The following Table summarized the body weight at day 7 post-inoculation. As you can see, rVSV with prM had less body weight loss compared to rVSV without prM, suggesting that rVSV with prM was more attenuated. Statistical analysis showed that rVSV-prM-E has significantly less body weight loss compared to rVSV-E (P<0.05), and rVSV-prM-E414 had significantly less body weight loss compared to rVSV-E414 (P<0.05).

Additionally, subviral particles are formed in vivo, yet the text suggests that they are only recombinantly expressed (line 84). The expression of prM followed by truncated E results in the secretion of soluble E. The expected immunogens (subviral particles versus soluble E) are not acknowledged clearly throughout the manuscript.

In the Figure Legend , we now clearly state the number of replicates for EACH experiments and how data are presented. In general, there are two types of experiments in this manuscript. First, in vitro experiments such as Western blot, virus growth curve which were done in three independent experiments. The Western blot gels presented are a representative of three independent experiments. Virus growth data were performed in three independent experiments and are expressed as geometric mean titers (GMT) \u00b1 standard deviation, and we state this. Second, in vivo animal experiments. For animal experiments, 5 or 10 mice were used/group to attain the power for statistical analysis. Data of body weights and T cell responses were the mean of 5 mice and expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Antibody titers and viral RNA titers were geometric mean titers (GMT) of 5 or 10 mice \u00b1 standard deviation. Response: We should have explained this experiment better. For T cell assays, each mouse sample was treated individually. After euthanasia, the spleen was isolated from each mouse, homogenized, a cell suspension prepared, split into three wells (triplicate per mouse) in 96-well microtiter plates (pre-coated with 20 \u00b5g/ml of ZIKV E protein), and cultured for 5 days. Flow cytometry was performed after intracellular staining with the corresponding anti-cytokine. For each group, data were expressed as mean % positive cells (the mean of 15 samples: 3 wells \u00d7 5 mice) \u00b1 standard deviation. These have been clearly stated in figure legend for Fig.3 .",

If it is below the detection level, a constant, such as \u00bd the limit of detection, should be used. Fig.3 panel G, H, I, and J). For all RNA quantification experiment, we used the SYBR Green-based qPCR method (TaKaRa, Japan) which may have a relatively lower sensitivity than specific probe-based qPCR method. Also, the detection limit for each animal experiment may be slightly different because we determined the detection limit for each experiment and each animal experiment had its own normal control (unvaccinated unchallenged).

The VSV genomic RNA is encapsidated by the viral N protein and forms a helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. During purification, it is difficult to eliminate the RNP complex (helical or ring-like structure). However, the EM pictures clearly showed that ZIKV VLP can be found in the supernatant. This is the purpose of the EM analysis.",

Importantly, they have ensured that all constructs expressing ZIKV E and E truncations encode a leader sequence when appropriate. This begs the question as to why data obtained with the original constructs lacking a leader sequence are still included, particularly the Western Blots. As the paper is somewhat lengthy, I would suggest removing these results. Much of the data presented for the constructs designed to express soluble E could also be removed, as these were never tested in the mouse challenge models and do not add much to the paper. While I believe the manuscript could be shortened and focused more on the constructs encoding NS1, overall the authors have appropriately responded to the reviewer's comments.",

They have performed several other experiments including the construction of other recombinant VSV encoding full length E gene, as well as truncated sequences of this gene, all fused to the signal peptide sequence corresponding the C-terminal region of the C protein. They showed that rVSV construct with the anchor C signal peptide led to more abundant expression of E/E truncations comparted to constructs without this peptide sequence and, more important, E truncated proteins were secreted to extracellular medium. However, no experiments were performed in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of the rVSV E truncated constructions or their protective potential! I understand that the manuscript is already extensive and results indicated that the construction with prM-E-NS1 seemed to induce better response comparing to others, but the information about E truncations that are secreted to extracellular medium is missing. It's possible that secretion of E protein, without the Cterminal sequence that is highly hydrophobic and in the context without prM, induces more neutralizing antibodies and could be more protective.",

Importantly, they have ensured that all constructs expressing ZIKV E and E truncations encode a leader sequence when appropriate. This begs the question as to why data obtained with the original constructs lacking a leader sequence are still included, particularly the Western Blots. As the paper is somewhat lengthy, I would suggest removing these results. Much of the data presented for the constructs designed to express soluble E could also be removed, as these were never tested in the mouse challenge models and do not add much to the paper. While I believe the manuscript could be shortened and focused more on the constructs encoding NS1, overall the authors have appropriately responded to the reviewer's comments.\"",

However, no experiments were performed in order to evaluate the immunogenicity of the rVSV E truncated constructions or their protective potential! I understand that the manuscript is already extensive and results indicated that the construction with prM-E-NS1 seemed to induce better response comparing to others, but the information about E truncations that are secreted to extracellular medium is missing. It's possible that secretion of E protein, without the C-terminal sequence that is highly hydrophobic and in the context without prM, induces more neutralizing antibodies and could be more protective.\"Response: Thank you for this comment. In this manuscript, we have tested all VSV constructs and DNA vaccine constructs in animals except the rVSV E truncated constructions with a leader sequence (rVSV-aE404, aE414, and aE415). Although it would be interesting to determine whether they can induce more neutralizing antibodies in animals, the main emphasis of this manuscript is the construction of rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 and the role of NS1 in protection. We have clearly showed that rVSV-G1670A-prM-E-NS1 has excellent safety, immunogenicity, and protection in various animal models. In addition, we have shown that NS1 modulates immune response and provide partial protection. In the future, we will determine the immunogenicity of three rVSV E truncated constructions in animal models.",
