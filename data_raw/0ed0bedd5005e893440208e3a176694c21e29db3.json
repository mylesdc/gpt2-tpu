These respiratory infections maybe caused by a wide range of microorganisms. Approximately 80% of cases are viral [3] . Some common viruses responsible for respiratory infections include Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), human Rhinovirus (hRV), human Enterovirus (hEV), Influenza A Virus (IAV), Influenza B Virus (IBV), human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), Coronavirus (CoV), Parainfluenza Virus (PIV), Adenovirus (AdV), and human Bocavirus (hBoV) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The similar clinical presentations of patients infected by various respiratory viruses make etiological diagnoses difficult when doctors simply make decisions based only on physical symptoms [10] [11] [12] . This can lead to the misuse of drugs, i.e. oseltamivir and amantadine are two effective drugs used to treat IAV infections but have no effect on URTIs caused by other respiratory viruses.",

This is one important reason for the over-prescription of unnecessary antibiotics to children presenting with fever in pediatric hospitals in Shanghai. With support from the Chinese Key SciTech Programme for Infection Control (under The Eleventh Five-year Framework), our laboratory began a pilot program to monitor virus pathogens responsible for URTIs symptoms in Shanghai. We adapted a VRDAL method for this surveillance pilot program based on a previously published paper by Australian scientists [16] . This multiplex RT-PCR method can detect 10 viruses at the same time, but cannot differentiate between hRV and hEV, PIV-1 from PIV-3, or RSV A from RSV B. The SeeplexH Respiratory Virus Detection assay (SeeGene Inc., Seoul, Korea) was introduced to the respiratory research community in 2007 and can efficiently differentiate 15 respiratory viruses [5] . Thus, the SeeplexH RV15 ACE Detection kit was also used to assess the virus profiles.",

Primers used for first and second round PCR amplifications are referred in original paper [16] . Subtyping of hEV, hRV, and PIV depends on the sequencing results from acquired PCR products. For the first round amplification, 2.5 mL cDNA was added to a 22 mL master mixture containing 500 nmol first round primers (100 nmol for picornavirus), 25 mmol MgCl 2 , 2.0 mmol dNTPs, and 0.3 U HotstarH Taq polymerase (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The PCR reaction protocol included a 15 min denaturation step at 94uC, then 35 cycles of 30 s at 94uC, 30 s annealing at 55uC, and 60 s extension at 72uC, then a final elongation step at 72uC for 7 min. For the second round amplification, 1 mL of each product from the first round was transferred to a freshly prepared master mixture containing primers for second round reactions. PCR conditions were the same as used in first round reactions. Final PCR products were separated by 30 min electrophoresis (10 V/cm) on a 2% agarose gel prestained with ethidium bromide.",

It detected 27.5% more positive specimens than the VRDAL method (78.7% vs. 51.2%). In addition to those viruses not covered by VRDAL (PIV4, hBoV, CoV and hMPV), the SeeplexH RV15 assay showed 40% higher sensitivity for detection of IAV, PIV1-3, IAV, AdV, and RSV A/B. For example, SeeplexH RV15 yielded a 8.5% infection rate for AdV compared to 6.1% by VRDAL. Since VRDAL requires a two round amplification procedure, whilst SeeplexH RV15 is performed using only one round, the improvement in sensitivity is attributed to a better primer design strategy adopted by SeeplexH RV15 assay as dual-priming oligonucleotide system.",

Another study had reported that the three most predominant viruses were RSV A/B (24.7%), hBoV (24.5%), and hRV (15%) identified in Shanghai and NanXiang children during period from Oct, 2006 to Sep, 2008 . In this study, the most prevalent respiratory viruses were identified as hRV (22.6%), IAV (19.5%) and PIV2 (18.3%). Specimens collected from outbreak events can greatly alter the infection profile for respiratory diseases. So caution was exercised to avoid inclusion such specimens in our tests. Thus, the different findings from the three reports cited are attributed to the yearly changes in Shanghai. The high incidence of RSV reported in Shanghai and NanXiang children was explained by the increased isolation rate of all viruses due to an extremely cold winter in 2007.",

For other viruses, in concordance with other studies, hEV was most frequently isolated in summer, while RSV A/B was most frequently observed in winter, hRV in fall, and PIV1-4 in springs. The IAV/IBV virus showed two peaks in seasonal distribution in Shanghai, a city with a temperate climate. This pattern was different from more northern cities like Beijing. Thus, more accurate forecasting of seasonal epidemic viruses could help healthcare professionals better prepare for combating respiratory infections in children. Since hRV and hEV showed different seasonal distribution patterns, SeeplexH multiplex PCR may be superior over the VRDAL PCR method, which can differentiate between hRV and hEV and so as to correctly detect seasonal changes in respiratory virus distribution.",
