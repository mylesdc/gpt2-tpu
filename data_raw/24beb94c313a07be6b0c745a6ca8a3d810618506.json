            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified in 2012 during the first Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks. MERS-CoV causes an acute lower-respiratory infection in humans, with a fatality rate of ~35.5%. Currently, there are no registered vaccines or means of therapeutic protection against MERS in the world. The MERS-CoV S glycoprotein plays the most important role in the viral life cycle (virus internalization). The S protein is an immunodominant antigen and the main target for neutralizing antibodies. In the present study, the immunogenicities of five different forms of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein were compared: the full-length S glycoprotein, the full-length S glycoprotein with the transmembrane domain of the G glycoprotein of VSV (S-G), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S glycoprotein, the membrane-fused RBD (the RBD fused with the transmembrane domain of the VSV G glycoprotein (RBD-G)), and the RBD fused with Fc of human IgG1 (RBD-Fc). Recombinant vectors based on human adenoviruses type 5 (rAd5) were used as delivery vehicles. Vaccination with all of the developed rAd5 vectors elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 response in mice. The most robust humoral immune response was induced after the animal had been vaccinated with the membrane-fused RBD (rAd5-RBD-G). Only immunization with membrane forms of the glycoprotein (rAd5-S, rAd5-S-G, and rAd5-RBD-G) elicited neutralizing antibodies among all vaccinated animals. The most significant cellular immune response was induced after vaccination of the animals with the full-length S (rAd5-S). These investigations suggest that the full-length S and the membrane form of the RBD (RBD-G) are the most promising vaccine candidates among all the studied forms of S glycoprotein.

MERS-CoV is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family, genus Betacoro-navirus. Dromedary camels are the natural reservoir of MERS-CoV; viral transmission to humans occurs during consumption of unpasteurized camel milk; airborne transmission is also possible [3] [4] [5] .",

There are data that demonstrate the immunogenicity of various forms of the MERS-CoV glycoprotein [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, the question of which form is preferable for a vaccine remains open, since an antigen panel has not been tested under the same conditions. In order to address this knowledge gap, we constructed five recombinant vectors based on human adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) expressing different forms of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein: -the full-length S glycoprotein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); -two secreted variants of the receptor binding domain of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein containing the alkaline phosphatase leader peptide (the RBD and the RBD fused with Fc of human IgG1 to increase stability and immunogenicity [18, 19] ); and -two transmembrane (TM) forms localized in the plasma membrane of the cell: either the full-length S or the RBD with the TM domain of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein. Because the full-length S glycoprotein is localized in the ER [26] , we constructed an S-G variant with a deleted ER localization signal.",

            "text": "The key in vaccine development is antigen selection. Most of the developed vaccines against MERS are based on the application of different forms of the MERS-CoV glycoprotein (the full-length S, the S1 subunit, and RBD) [14-16, 18, 22, 24, 47-55] , which is the main target for neutralizing antibodies. However, the question that still remains open is which form to choose for the development of an effective vaccine? It is known that the full-length S glycoprotein ensures 15%) , and rAd5-RBD (0.55%) groups. An analysis of IFN-\u03b3 production by splenocytes after the 100% protection against lethal infection caused by MERS-CoV in animals [44] . However, some authors have expressed concern about the use of full-length MERS-CoV S in the vaccine. Thus, it has been reported that a vaccine based on a full-length glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (which, like MERS-CoV, belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus) induces immunopathology in the lungs of a vaccinated organism because of the strong antibody response to the SARS-CoV glycoprotein and weak T cell (Th2-skewed) immune response [56, 57] . Glycoprotein modifications were for the most part based on the fact that the receptor-binding domain of the glycoprotein was included in the antigen. Various studies showed immunogenicity of the S1 subunit, the RBD or the RBD fused with Fc of human IgG1 (RBD-Fc) [15, 18, 19, 49, 58] . Studies focused on protection of drugs based on RBD (subunit vaccines) showed that RBD vaccination protected ~ 80% of animals from MERS-CoV, despite the high titers of neutralizing antibodies capable of blocking the interaction between the virus and the DPP4 receptor on the cell surface [42, 59] . The lack of 100% protection seems to be related to the need to develop a cellular immune response, as well as the need to block fusion of the viral and cell membranes, which is mediated by the S2 subunit. Furthermore, application of subunitbased vaccines, as well as inactivated ones, prevents the emergence of a balanced Th1/Th2 response and often leads to the development of Th2-skewed immunity [22, 42] . In the case of MERS, its development can lead to lung immunopathologies [48] . Therefore, it is important to take into account the fact that the vaccine-induced immunity must be Th1/Th2-balanced when developing an anti-MERS vaccine.",
