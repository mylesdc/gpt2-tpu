Therefore, it is of interest to estimate the degree of conserved antigenic sites among them. It is of importance to elucidate the shared antigenic-sites and extent of conservation between them to understand the evolutionary dynamics of MERS-CoV. Results: Multiple sequence alignment of the spike (S), membrane (M), enveloped (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins was employed to identify the sequence conservation among MERS and Bat (HKU4, HKU5) coronaviruses. We used various in silico tools to predict the conserved antigenic sites. We found that MERS-CoV shared 30 % of its S protein antigenic sites with HKU4 and 70 % with HKU5 bat-CoV. Whereas 100 % of its E, M and N protein's antigenic sites are found to be conserved with those in HKU4 and HKU5. Conclusion: This sharing suggests that in case of pathogenicity MERS-CoV is more closely related to HKU5 bat-CoV than HKU4 bat-CoV. The conserved epitopes indicates their evolutionary relationship and ancestry of pathogenicity.",

Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses which are classified into four genera, Alpha coronavirus, Beta coronavirus, Gamma coronavirus and Delta coronavirus [1] . HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and MERS-CoV are the six types of human coronaviruses evolved in between 1960 and 2015 whereas MERS-CoV is newly emerged strain. This newly emerged MERS-CoV, which is highly fatal, belongs to lineage C of the genus Beta coronavirus [2] . Human coronaviruses have been tracked down to zoonotic origin. Among the six strains of human corona-viruses, the first HCoV-229E has structural similarity with Bat coronaviruses. This phenomenon resemble to other members that are also have originated from different animal corona-virus like HCoV-OC43 from bovine corona-virus, SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 from bat or palm civet coronavirus and HCoV-HKU1 from Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Like other human coronaviruses, it is assumed that MERS-CoV has been evolved from zoonotic origin but the zoonotic source of MERS-CoV remains unknown [3] [4] [5] .",

The HCoV-229E has structural similarity with Bat corona-viruses [21] . Similarly SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 have originated from the bat but the zoonotic source of MERS-CoV is still not clear [3] . Though the MERS-CoV is found to be structurally related to the bat corona-viruses (HKU4 and HKU5) but there is no report of the sharing of antigenic sites among them.

We also predicted conserved antigenic sites and found that, MERS and HKU4 bat corona-viruses shared 30 % of S protein epitope and 100 % of E, M and N proteins epitope. And MERS and HKU5 bat coronaviruses shared 70 % of S protein epitope and 100 % of E, M and N proteins epitope. In most cases conservation level found >90 %. These findings suggested that, in case of antigenicity MERS-CoV is more closely related to HKU5 bat-CoV than the HKU4 bat-CoV.
