A cross-sectional survey among Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims in 2018. The uptake of the recommended vaccines was surveyed through an anonymous self-administered questionnaire to pilgrims attending a pre-departure Hajj/Umrah orientation course. Descriptive statistics were used for elaborating the demographic characteristics and vaccines uptake of the respondents. Multiple logistic regression was used for predicting the factors associated with the vaccines' uptake. A total of 1,274 pilgrims participated in the study with a mean age (standard deviation) of 42.42 (15.6). A total of 833 (65.4%) participants were females and 232 of the participants (18.2%) had at least more than one chronic disease. The uptake of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines were 28.6% (364/1,274) and 25.4% (324/1,274), respectively. Among the 527 pilgrims who were \"at increased risk\" of infections, 168 (31.9%) and 184 (34.9%) received influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, respectively. Gender, marital status and occupation were the common predictors associated with vaccines uptake. The vaccination uptake among Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims is low and declining from previous years. Educating the pilgrims toward vaccine uptake is essential and exploring the barriers for vaccination.",

Hajj pilgrims from more than 180 countries across the globe visit Saudi Arabia for the 2 pilgrimages yearly (3) . These mass gatherings are characterized by many challenges like an increased risk of infection particularly the respiratory tract infections due to the enormous population density of the participants, shared accommodation, environmental pollution and extreme climatic conditions (4, 5) . Outbreaks of diseases like influenza and cholera have all been associated with these two events (6) . Recently, Hajj pilgrimage has also drawn considerable attention from participating countries on the possible spread and transmission of emerging infections such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) due to numerous cases recorded by the host country since its emergence in 2012 and pandemic H1N1 (7) .",

Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the recommended vaccines.

An enhanced surveillance of Hajj pilgrims from Australia reported a prevalence rate of 1.1% from unvaccinated pilgrims (13) .

In addition, the Malaysian Health authorities recommend intending Hajj pilgrims to take influenza and pneumococcal vaccines to augment their body immunity system. Both vaccines are strongly encouraged for pilgrims aged 50 years and above and those with underlying medical conditions like asthma, diabetics, lung or kidney diseases. The vaccine should be administered at least a month before the departure date to the Holy Land and can confer immunity for influenza and pneumococcal infections for 1 and 5 years, respectively (18) .",

Full vaccination coverage was recorded during the 2009 influenza pandemic following Saudi authorities' insistence on vaccination (24) . This is mainly due to the misconception by many people that vaccines themselves could revert to cause disease, reliance on natural immunity and insufficient awareness (25, 26) . However, the common belief for alternative medicine during Hajj through consumption dates, honey, olive, pomegranates, and other blessed foods and fruits in Islam are common resulting in vaccine hesitancy. This misconception and misperception are generated and spread in Malaysia and affect the uptake of the recommended vaccines (27) .

Pilgrims from companies who were willing to participate were met at the beginning of the weekly Hajj/Umrah orientation course.

The participants were briefed at the start of the session and informed written consent was given to them. A self-administered questionnaire was given to those participants who signed the informed consent form. The survey included pilgrims' demographic information such as age, gender, marital status, occupation, the highest level of education, comorbidities, respiratory illness prior to departing for the Holy Land and history of influenza (flu) vaccine (within the past 1 year) and pneumococcal vaccine (within the past 5 years).",

This is due to the enormous role Hajj and Umrah play in global public health due to the risk of importing and spreading new infections to home country on return. The findings from this study revealed that the uptake of these vaccines was significantly higher among pilgrims with higher education levels. This study also showed that 41.4% of the participants are considered to be at risk of respiratory tract infection and the vaccine uptake among this group are 31.9 and 34.9% for influenza and pneumococcal vaccine, respectively. This findings are similar to the finding of a study conducted among pilgrims sample on arrival at King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah for the 2009 Hajj (29) . However, the uptake of these vaccines among this group is lower than that in a previous study conducted among pilgrims from Saudi (67%) (30). Despite the regulations by the Saudi health authority that necessitate influenza and pneumococcal vaccine compulsory before departure to Hajj, 100% coverage regarding the uptake of the vaccine is still lacking among most pilgrims from various countries (30-32). Our present study also showed a similar low level of recommended vaccines uptake among Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims. The low uptake could be explained based on the fact that pandemic influenza vaccine is not given free by the Health ministry, most are available at private clinics only a short time before the departure of pilgrims from their home countries and costly as reported in other similar studies (33) . Also, the suboptimal acceptance of these vaccines as reported in this study may have added to such lower vaccination coverage among pilgrims (34) .",

Education of all pilgrims before departure is imperative to enlighten and create awareness toward vaccine uptake. Additional studies are required to explore the barriers as well as motivators to bridge the knowledge gap about the mandatory and recommended vaccine's uptake.",
