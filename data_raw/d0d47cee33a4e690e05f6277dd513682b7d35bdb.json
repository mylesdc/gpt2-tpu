There is no vaccine or a less effective drug available against RSV infections. Natural RSV infection stimulates the Th1 immune response and activates the production of neutralizing antibodies, while earlier vaccine trials that used UV-inactivated RSV exacerbated the disease due to the activation of the allergic Th2 response. With a focus on Th1 immunity, we developed a DNA vaccine containing the native RSV fusion (RSV F) protein and studied its immune response in BALB/c mice. High levels of RSV specific antibodies were induced during subsequent immunizations. The serum antibodies were able to neutralize RSV in vitro. The RSV inhibition by sera was also shown by immunofluorescence analyses. Antibody response of the RSV F DNA vaccine showed a strong Th1 response. Also, sera from RSV F immunized and RSV infected mice reduced the RSV infection by 50% and 80%, respectively. Our data evidently showed that the RSV F DNA vaccine activated the Th1 biased immune response and led to the production of neutralizing antibodies, which is the desired immune response required for protection from RSV infections.",

Worldwide, the number of RSV-associated cases is estimated to be 33 million and the number of deaths up to 234,000 in children younger than 5 years old in spite of the fact that those numbers are lower in the USA due to the precautions against RSV [4, 5] . Besides the young children, the hospitalization rate of elderly people above 50 years old may be the same as influenza cases [2] .

Instead of vaccine, some researchers have been attempting to develop prophylactic antibody therapies targeting RSV F protein [7, 8] . Antiviral drugs such as ribavirin (a nucleoside analog), which targets hepatitis C and other viruses including RSV, ALS-8176 (a new nucleoside analog), and GS5806 (pyrazolo [1,5-a] pyrimidine based RSV fusion inhibitor), and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies such as Palivizumab (Synagis6) and Motavizumab (Numax), are administered to infants at high risk of developing respiratory diseases [9] [10] [11] [12] . As an alternative to expensive therapies, a vaccine conferring long lasting immunity is a less expensive and more efficient option against recurrent RSV infections [10] . Due to frequent antigenic variations of RNA viruses (RSV, influenza virus, and rhinovirus), developing a vaccine with complete protection is challenging. The incomplete immunity in response to natural RSV infections is responsible 2 Advances in Virology for repeated infections. RSV vaccine studies in the 1960s using formalin inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) consisting of the whole virus exacerbated the disease and even in some cases resulted in deaths because of the elevated T helper type-2 (Th2) mediated immune response [1, 13] . In addition, using a vector expressing RSV antigens is found far safer than subunit or inactivated RSV immunization [14] . With these important immunological responses, a safe and stable vaccine with long lasting immunity is an urgent need for the public.",

The RSV F protein mediates the fusion of the virus particle into the host by merging the virion envelope with the host cell membrane following virion attachment using the G protein. In addition, the F protein facilitates fusion of neighboring normal cells with infected cells, thus creating multinuclear giant cells called syncytia, which characterizes RSV infection [9, 16] . The RSV F protein is highly conserved among the different RSV strains compared to other RSV proteins [16] . On the other hand, the variability of the G amino acid sequence among various RSV strains is high [17] . Furthermore, previous reports demonstrated that RSV F vaccines provide protection against both RSV A and RSV B strains by producing neutralizing antibodies [8, 14, 18, 19] , whereas RSV G vaccines prominently induced a Th2 biased immune response, thereby enhancing the severity of the disease in subsequent RSV infections [20, 21] .",

Cell-mediated protective immunity is important in the clearance of infected cells. However, cell-mediated immunity on its own is not sufficient to provide complete protection against pathogens. Therefore, it is necessary to have memory B cells activating neutralizing antibodies upon reinfection. Although DNA vaccines are not highly immunogenic as compared to whole pathogen or protein vaccines, DNA vaccines have the advantage of expressing the native form of the antigen produced in vivo and inducing strong T and B cells responses. The changes in the epitope regions of the antigen may shift the immune response leading to unwanted allergic immune reactions as seen in the FI-RSV vaccine trials [6, 22, 23] . A highly immunogenic RSV F protein with conserved sequence would be a desirable DNA vaccine candidate for protection from repeated RSV infections. Our group has previously developed a DNA vaccine containing immunogenic regions of RSV F protein (residues 412-524) and showed that the DNA vaccine provides partial protection in BALB/c mice when combined with cholera toxin (CTA 2 B) adjuvant [24] .",

            "text": "As with other pathogenic infections, RSV initially activates the innate response and subsequently develops cellular and humoral immunity. The cellular immunity is needed to clear the infection, whereas the humoral immune response (antibody mediated) is required for protection from initial and subsequent RSV infections. During the 1960s, vaccinations performed with FI-RSV suggested that FI-RSV immunization leads to a predominant Th2 type allergic response. Whereas wild type RSV activates T helper type 1 (Th1) skewed immune providing protection against RSV disease [1] . Thus, the Th1 type immune response is desired for protection against natural RSV infections. To understand the mechanism and type of immune responses for FI-RSV immunizations, different animal models such as monkeys [29] , bovine [30] , mice [31] , and cotton rats [23, 32] were tested. All models challenged with wt RSV following the immunization with FI-RSV stimulated the Th2 type allergic response [23] [24] [25] [29] [30] [31] [32] . In contrast, animals immunized and challenged with wt RSV developed Th1 type antibody protection against RSV. Likewise, natural RSV infection produces a Th1 mediated immune response against RSV. However, the most desirable immunity against any kind of pathogen is a balanced Th1/Th2 response. Even though the exact mechanism of FI-RSV mediated enhanced disease was not fully understood, Murphy et al. suggested that formalin treatment altered the protective epitopes of F and G proteins and failed to produce neutralizing antibodies against real RSV infections. They also reported that the sera from FI-RSV immunized recipients did not neutralize RSV in vitro due to the lack of RSV specific neutralizing antibodies compared to the sera from wt RSV immunized recipients [23] . Consequently, the native form of RSV F is required to produce neutralizing antibodies and provide immunization against RSV infections. DNA vaccines are thought to be more advantageous due to the processing of antigens in their native forms by eukaryotic cells and due to the efficient presentation of antigens to antigen presenting cells. Thus, antibodies produced against the recombinant antigen expressed in the target host would easily recognize native nondenatured proteins of the pathogen and provide more efficient and specific protection against real pathogens compared to the recombinant protein vaccines expressed in bacteria [33] . In a previous study, we developed a DNA vaccine containing a region of RSV F (412-524 amino acids) conjugated with a modified cholera toxin gene and used to immunize mice which resulted in higher immune response [24] .",

Major structural changes in the RSV F protein may lead to disease exacerbation and allergic outcomes. The RSV F DNA vaccine is a preferred immunogen compared to the recombinant RSV F protein produced ex vivo. For DNA vaccinations, the intramuscular injection route is the best route that ensures antigen expression and native conformation. Besides the native structure, another advantage of DNA vaccination is that it elicits the Th1 biased immune response due to its endogenous expression and presentation to the immune cells, which is a favorable response for protection from pathogens [13, 34] . The Th1 immune system and the production of neutralizing antibodies are very important for protection from reinfection, which confers long term immunity by recruiting memory B cells. When the host encounters the same pathogen again, memory B cells abruptly produce pathogen specific neutralizing antibodies and immediately inactivate the pathogen before it enters into the host and starts infection [33] . We tested the ability of serum collected from RSV F immunized mice to neutralize RSV in vitro. Previous studies have shown that serum from FI-RSV infected mice does not neutralize RSV infection due to the altered structure of the RSV F protein [23] .",

The main immunological event responsible of failure of the vaccine was induction of a predominant Th2 response that enhanced RSV disease following natural infection. Our study aimed at developing a safe DNA vaccine that induced a Th1 mediated antibody response. This study provides a basis for future RSV vaccine development that could benefit from DNA vaccine designs and may consider combination of DNA vaccine immunizations followed by traditional recombinant vaccine immunizations for higher protection from RSV infections.
