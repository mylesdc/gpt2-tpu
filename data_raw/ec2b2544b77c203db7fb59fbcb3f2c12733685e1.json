However, application of previously developed vaccines for preventing CDI has been limited due to various reasons. Here, we developed a recombinant Lactococcus lactis oral vaccine and evaluated its effect on a C. difficile-infected animal model established in golden hamsters in attempt to provide an alternative strategy for CDI prevention. Methods: Recombinant L. lactis vaccine was developed using the pTRKH2 plasmid, a high-copy-number Escherichia coli-L. shuttle vector: 1) L. lactis expressing secreted proteins was constructed with recombinant pTRKH2 (secreted-protein plasmid) carrying the Usp45 signal peptide (SPUsp45), nontoxic adjuvanted tetanus toxin fragment C (TETC), and 14 of the 38 C-terminal repeats (14CDTA) of nontoxic C. difficile toxin A (TcdA); and 2) L. lactis expressing secreted and membrane proteins was constructed with recombinant pTRKH2 (membrane-anchored plasmid) carrying SPUsp45, TETC, 14CDTA, and the cell wall-anchored sequence of protein M6 (cwaM6). Then, 32 male Syrian golden hamsters were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 8 each) for gavage of normal saline (blank control) and L. lactis carrying the empty shuttle vector, secreted-protein plasmid, and membrane-anchored plasmid, respectively. After 1-week gavage of clindamycin, the animals were administered with C. difficile spore suspension. General symptoms and intestinal pathological changes of the animals were examined by naked eye and microscopy, respectively. Protein levels of anti-TcdA IgG/IgA antibodies in intestinal tissue and fluid were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay was done by TcdA treatment with or without anti-TcdA serum pre-incubation or treatment. Apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells was examined by flow cytometry (FL) assay. Expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines in the animals was detected by polymer chain reaction (PCR) assay.",

Of the 3 immunization groups, secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups had significantly lower mortalities, body weight decreases, and pathological scores, with higher survival rate/time than the empty plasmid group (P < 0.05). The tilter of IgG antibody directed against TcdA was significantly higher in serum and intestinal fluid of secreted-protein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups than in the empty plasmid group (P < 0.05) while the corresponding titer of IgA antibody directed against TcdA had no substantial differences (P > 0.05). The anti-TcdA serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group neutralized the cytotoxicity of 200 ng/ml TcdA with the best protective effect achieved by anti-TcdA serum pre-incubation. The incidences of TcdA-induced death and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells were significantly reduced by cell pre-incubation or treatment with anti-TcdA serum of membrane-anchored plasmid group (P < 0.05). MCP-1, ICAM-1, IL-6, and Gro-1 mRNA expression levels were the lowest in cecum tissue of the membrane-anchored groups compared to the other groups.",

Vaccine development involves the establishment of an appropriate animal model and further evaluation of the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. In previous research of C. difficile vaccines, Kink et al. [3] successfully established CDI model in hamster by intragastric gavage of 10 5 CFU C. difficile 18-24 h after subcutaneous injection of clindamycin (CLDM, 1 mg per 100 g body weight), and Torres et al. [4] administered the animals with 10 5 CFU C. difficile 3-h after CLDM gavage (0.5 mg per 100 g body weight). In general, golden hamster is considered ideal for establishing CDI model, because C. difficile-produced toxins can be neutralized by anti-C. difficile antibodies and CLDM-induced colitis model can be used as animal model of human CDIs.",

However, the application of previously developed vaccines for C. difficile has been limited for various reasons: 1) Vaccines for passive immunization of CDI are thought expensive and inconvenient in storage and transport; 2) Attenuated vaccines are commonly treated with formalin to inactivate the antigen or given with adjuvant, sometimes through invasive routes of immunization such as subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection, thus are not easily accepted by the patients. 3 ) Recombinant vaccines that are carried by attenuated S. typhimuriu or V. cholerae are of concern in terms of biosafety [1] .",

            "text": "Lactococcus lactis is a harmless food industry bacterium that has been used extensively for producing a variety of peptides, proteins, and oral vaccines. As compared to the vaccine carrier E. coli, L. lactis can be a superior alternative because it produces less protease with no endotoxin [7] . In the literature, Dieye et al. [8] designed a proteintargeting system for lactic acid bacteria and found that the L. lactis expression system constructed with the P59 promoter and Usp45 single peptide (SPUsp45) was capable of expression and extracellular secretion of target nuclease while the expression system constructed with P59, Usp45, and the cell wall-anchored sequence of protein M6 (cwaM6) was capable of extracellular secretion of the nuclease as well as anchoring it onto the cell wall of L. lactis and Bacterium lacticum. In a following study, Ribeiro et al. [9] expressed a fusion protein containing the Brucella abortus antigen L7/L12 and the Streptococcus pyogenes cwaM6 in L. lactis, which allowed the antigen anchored on the cell surface, thus improving its antigenicity. These authors further developed a food-grade live vaccine for immunization of B. abortus, which showed a protective effect on mice under laboratory conditions [9] . In addition, Mannam et al. [10] made a mucosal vaccine from live, recombinant L. lactis, which protected mice against pharyngeal infection with S. pyogenes. Together these researches have provided a completely new direction for development of vaccines, especially live probiotic preparations for oral immunization.",

To examine the colony formation from C. difficile spores, samples were taken from the plates containing a mixture of spores and vegetative cells and then resuspended in BHIS medium. The suspension was heated to 60\u00b0C for 20 min to kill vegetative cells and then cooled, diluted and plated onto BHIS medium. For use in germination assays, C. difficile spores were purified using the method of Akoachere et al. [15] withminor modifications. The spore-vegetative cell mixture was harvested by flooding each well of the 6-well dish with ice-cold sterile water. After 5 washes with ice-cold water, the mixture of spores and vegetative cells were resuspended in 20%w/v HistoDenz (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), layered onto a 50%w/v HistoDenz solution in a centrifuge tube, and then centrifuged at 15,0007\u00d7 g for 15 min to separate spores from vegetative cells. The purified spores, collected at the bottom of the centrifuge tube, were washed twice with ice-cold water to remove traces of HistoDenz and then resuspended in distilled water.",

After the C. difficile challenge, all animals of the empty plasmid group had diarrhea on day 1 ( Table 4 ), suggesting that the intestinal flora were disturbed by continuous administration of CLDM. Compared to the blank control, empty plasmid group had lighter diarrhea symptoms. Despite one died after the C. difficile challenge, the diarrhea symptoms were alleviated in the remaining animals, and a few became normal after re-administration of L. lactis carrying the empty plasmid. Together these observations indicate that the probiotic L. lactis has a protective effect on CDI animal model and may prevent C. difficile-associated diarrhea in animals by inhibiting C. difficile colonization and/or other mechanisms [18, 19] .",

Immunological evaluation by ELISA assay showed that the IgG antibody produced in serum and intestinal fluid of secretedprotein and membrane-anchored plasmid groups reacted with TcdA while IgA showed no obvious effect (Figure 7) . These observations can be related to previous work by Vaerman et al. [20] , which indicates that the IgG antibody in serum and intestinal fluid plays a significant role in protecting human and experimental animals from CDI, and that IgA plays aminor role in prevention and control of CDIs. In the present study, none of the animals died in secreted-protein plasmid group after the C. difficile challenge. In fact, their diarrhea symptoms were relatively light (Table 4 ). This is because TcdA acts an enterotoxin as well as a cytotoxin, with a lower cytotoxicity than the C. difficile toxin B [19] . Thus, application of TcdA mainly causes intestinal cavity hemorrhage and effusion while preventing the infected animals from death. (C) Anti-TcdA serum pre-treatment: cells became slightly round but still spindly. (D) Anti-TcdA serum treatment: cells became round and narrow; nuclei appeared condensed, but some cells were still spindly (\u00d7200 magnification).",

Pathological analysis and flow cytometry assay confirmed that oral immunization with the recombinant L. lactis carrying membrane-anchored plasmid most effectively prevented C. difficile-induced diarrhea in the animal model as well as apoptosis in the intestinal epithelial cells (Figures 3, 4 , 5, and 9). Compared to other immunization groups, membrane-anchored plasmid group had higher tilter of anti-TcdA IgG antibody in the serum and intestinal fluid (Figure 7) , with downregulated expression of mucosal inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 ( Figure 10 ). It was possible that the number of exogenous L. lactis cells in vivo gradually decreased due to phagocytosis by the M cells on the intestinal wall. Because membraneanchored plasmid anchors the recombinant protein onto the cell wall, phagocytosis of L. lactis cells carrying such plasmid can more efficiently deliver the antigen to the immune system than that of secreted-protein plasmid. Consequently, the recombinant L. lactis carrying membraneanchored plasmid is most effective for preventing CDI compared to other immunization treatments. Further investigation is guaranteed to explore molecular mechanism (s) of CDI prevention by the recombinant L. lactis live vaccine. ",
