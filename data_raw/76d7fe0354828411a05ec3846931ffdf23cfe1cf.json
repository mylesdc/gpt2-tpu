HKU1 virus uses its S1 subunit C-terminal domain (CTD) and not the N-terminal domain like other lineage A b-CoVs to bind to its yet unknown human receptor. Here we present the crystal structure of HKU1 CTD at 1.9 \u00c5 resolution. The structure consists of three subdomains: core, insertion and subdomain-1 (SD-1). While the structure of the core and SD-1 subdomains of HKU1 are highly similar to those of other b-CoVs, the insertion subdomain adopts a novel fold, which is largely invisible in the cryo-EM structure of the HKU1 S trimer. We identify five residues in the insertion subdomain that are critical for binding of neutralizing antibodies and two residues essential for receptor binding. Our study contributes to a better understanding of entry, immunity and evolution of CoV S proteins.",

HKU1 can only be propagated in well-differentiated primary human tracheal bronchial epithelial (HTBE) cells and human alveolar type II (hATII) cells [11] [12] [13] [14] . Although infection of multiple cell lines including A549 cells by HKU1 S protein pseudotyped lentiviruses has been reported 15 , efforts to repeat these results were unsuccessful 14, 16 . The binding of O-acetylated sialic acid is required but not sufficient for HKU1 infection 16 and the protein receptor remains unknown.",

            "text": "CoVs enter cells through fusion of viral and cellular membranes, which is mediated by the interaction between the viral spike (S) glycoprotein and the host receptor. The S protein is a class-I viral fusion protein and an important target for antibody neutralization and vaccine development. Each monomer of trimeric S protein is B180-200 kDa and composed of two subunits, S1 and S2. While S1 is responsible for receptor binding and recognition, S2 possesses all fusion machinery required for membrane fusion (Fig. 1a) . S1 can be further divided into four domains: N-terminal galectin-like domain (NTD) 17 , C-terminal domain (CTD), subdomain-1 (SD-1) and subdomain-2 (SD-2) 18 ( Fig. 1a) . Either NTD or CTD or both can function as the receptor-binding domain (RBD). All known RBDs of a-CoVs are located in the CTD [19] [20] [21] [22] , although the NTDs of some a-CoVs bind sugar 23, 24 ; SARS CoV (a lineage B b-CoV) and MERS CoV (a lineage C b-CoV) also use their CTDs to bind the receptor protein [25] [26] [27] . In contrast, most CoVs from lineage A b-CoVs, including mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), human CoV OC43 and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), use their NTDs to bind either receptor protein or sialic acid 17, 28 . Surprisingly, we recently found that the HKU1 virus, another lineage A b-CoV, uses its CTD, rather than its NTD, in the S protein to bind to its unknown receptor 29 . Among all b-CoVs, HKU1 CTD is one of the largest. Compared to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, there is a 76-amino acid insertion (amino acid 490-565, numbering from the S protein of genotype A HKU1 virus) in the CTD of the HKU1 S protein ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), whose function is unknown.",

            "text": "Recently, significant progress has been made in understanding the structural basis of the interaction of CoV S proteins with their cellular receptors. Several crystal structures of the RBDs of the S proteins of various CoVs in complex with their cognate receptors have been determined. Specific examples include complexes of the SARS-CoV CTD with human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) 25 32 , and the MHV NTD with mouse carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecular 1a (mCEACAM1a) 17 . The structural information for the CTD of lineage A b-CoV remains notably absent. In February 2016, two cryo-electron microscopic (Cryo-EM) structures for the trimeric S proteins of two lineage A b-CoVs, MHV and HKU1, were reported 18, 33 , and the two structures are very similar. The homotrimeric S proteins are triangular and 140-150 \u00c5 high with a diameter at the triangular cross-section ranging from 70 \u00c5 at the membrane proximal base to 140 \u00c5 at the membrane distal 'head'. While the 'head' is formed by three S1 subunits, the S2 subunits form the central stem. Individual S1s fold in a V shape and rest above the S2 subunits, preventing the conformational rearrangement of S2 that leads to membrane fusion. Surprisingly, the S1 CTDs are interdigitated in such a way that the corresponding surfaces in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are known to bind to their receptors are buried in the trimer 18 . However, significant parts of the HKU1 S1 CTD structure, including the 76-amino acid insertion, are missing in the Cryo-EM structure 18 . The critical question of the location of the receptor binding motif of the HKU1 S protein remains unanswered.",

We recently reported that the CTD of the HKU1 S protein contained the RBD and the epitopes for neutralizing antibodies mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 (ref. 29) . To gain structural and molecular insights into the receptor binding motif and neutralizing epitopes, we carried out a crystallographic study on the CTD of the HKU1 S protein. We designed several CTD-containing constructs with various N-and C-termini on the basis of the available structural information for the S proteins of other CoVs and secondary structure prediction of the S1 protein of HKU1. Among them, the construct encoding residues 310-677 (numbering from the amino acid sequence of S protein of HKU1 genotype A, or 1A), designated as 1A-S310-677aa, gave the highest level of protein expression in our insect expression system. Moreover, the purified 1A-S310-677aa protein was recognized by four conformational antibodies in ELISA, including mHKUS-2, -3, -4 and -6 ( Fig. 1b) . The mHKUS-1 only recognizes NTD of HKU1 S protein 29 . More importantly, HKU1 virus infection on primary HTBE cells was reduced approximately fivefold by pre-incubation and addition of 1A-S310-677aa at 20 mM (Fig. 1c,d) , whereas NTD of HKU1 S protein did not show marked inhibition at the same concentration (Supplementary Fig. 2A and refs 16, 29) . These results indicate that the function and overall conformation of the purified 1A-S310-677aa protein was nearly intact. After removal of its 6xhis-tag, 1A-S310-677aa protein formed crystals in the C222 1 space group with one molecule per asymmetric unit ( Table 1 ). The crystals diffracted to 1.9 \u00c5 resolution, and the structure of 1A-S310-677aa was solved using native single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing 34 . Native-SAD takes advantage of the weak anomalous signal of light elements naturally present in biological macromolecules such as sulfur and phosphorus. The construct 1A-SS310-677aa contains 24 cysteines. The anomalous scattering from sulfur and phosphorus is very weak and requires merging of multiple data sets from either multiple crystals or from a single crystal collected in multiple orientations. Accordingly, 16 data sets from two isomorphous crystals collected in multiple orientations were scaled and merged. The final dataset had an anomalous signal extending to B3.1 \u00c5 and its overall resolution was better than 2.3 \u00c5 (CC1/2 of highest-resolution shell: 89.4%). The final structure had excellent refinement statistics and stereochemistry quality ( Table 1) .",

Compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the insertion loop of HKU1 CTD is much bigger and spans residues 429-588, making it larger than the core structure in terms of the number of amino acids. The structure of the insertion loop consists of five b-sheets (b8-12) and five helices (a6-10), and the overall shape resembles an 'ox horn' (Fig. 2 ). The tip of the 'horn' is formed by folding back two anti-parallel b-sheets, b10 and b11. Of note, the subdomain contains several extended loops that lack the obvious secondary structures and is highly cysteine-rich. Sixteen cysteine residues form eight pairs of disulfide bonds, providing essential restraints that stabilize the structure.

Their CTDs shares 47.1%, 19.0%, 25.3%, 22.1% and 17.1% amino acid sequence identity with HKU1 CTD, respectively. The structure alignment of the CTDs from different b-CoVs reveals that the structure of the insertion loop of HKU1 significantly differs from the others (Fig. 3) . The r.m.s.d. values for the structural alignments of these CTDs are 1.9 \u00c5 between MHV and HKU1, based on 187 aligned residues (59% of MHV CTD); 2.2 \u00c5 between SARS and HKU1, based on 142 aligned residues (82% of residues in SARS CTD); 2.1 \u00c5 between MERS and HKU1, based on 158 aligned residues (76% residues in MERS CTD); 2.52 \u00c5 between HKU4 and HKU1, based on 136 aligned residues (65% of HKU4 CTD); and 2.36 \u00c5 between HKU9 and HKU1, based on 146 aligned residues (86% HKU9 CTD). A Dali server search against all available structures returned no homologue hits, indicating that the structure of the insertion loop of 1A-S310-677aa is novel. The SD-1 subdomain is b-rich and consists of amino acids 614 to 674. This subdomain contains five b-sheets (b15-19) and one helix (a11). All five b-sheets form a b-sandwich, with b15 and b16 in one layer and b17-19 in the other layer. The two layers stack tightly against each other through extensive hydrophobic interactions. The SD-1 of HKU1 shares B70% amino acid sequence identity with MHV, and their structures are also highly conserved 33 . The structure alignment of MHV and HKU1 SD-1 gave an r.m.s.d. value of 0.96 \u00c5 based on 60 aligned residues (100% of MHV SD-1). It is worth noting that b15 and b1 form parallel b-sheets, connecting the SD-1 subdomain to the core subdomain, and b1 is also directly connected with the NTD of the S protein 18, 33 . The b1 appears to play an important role in maintaining the metastable state of the S protein before binding to the receptor. A Tyr to Ala substitution at the position 320 (Y320A) in the b1 of the S protein of MHV A59 (equivalent to H318 in HKU1 S, Supplementary Fig. 1 ) causes spontaneous dissociation of S1 from S protein and results in formation of receptor-and pH-independent syncytia in 293 T cells ( Supplementary Fig. 3) , suggesting that the Y320A mutation in MHV S protein may disrupt the interactions between SD-1 and the core subdomain, and somehow cause the dissociation of S1 from S2 even without receptor binding, leading to conformational changes of S2 and membrane fusion. Previously Kirchdoerfer et al 18 postulated that the complex folding of SD-1 and SD-2 may allow receptor-induced conformational changes in the CTD to be transmitted to other parts of the S protein. Because SD-1 is connected to both NTD and CTD and the Y320A mutation in MHV S protein destabilizes the association between S1 and S2, we propose that SD-1 may serve as a key motif to allow receptor-induced conformational changes in either the NTD or CTD to be transmitted to other parts of the S protein.",

Since the majority of the insertion domain was missing in the EM structures of the trimeric HKU1 S proteins, integration of the high resolution structure of 1A-S310-677aa into the EM structure of the HKU1 S protein would aid our understanding of how the HKU1 S protein interacts with its unknown receptor and how the neutralizing antibodies, mHKUS-2 and -3, inhibit HKU1 virus infection. Using the core and SD-1 subdomains as references, we superimposed the crystal structure of 1A-S310-677aa onto the EM structure of the HKU1 S protein. This superimposition aligned 181 Ca atoms of the core and SD-1 subdomains with an r.m.s.d. value of 1.2 \u00c5, indicating a good fit. In this integrated model, all four glycosylation sites previously identified in the crystal structure remained well exposed. While N433 and N454 lie on the top of the trimer, N355 and N470 are at the side of the trimer (Fig. 4) . Consistent with previous findings 18 , the structural alignment of CTDs of HKU1, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV showed that the regions in the HKU1 CTD equivalent to the receptor-binding motifs of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are buried between two adjacent monomers in the trimeric HKU1 S proteins. Interestingly, the recently reported cryo-EM structure of the human a-CoV NL63 S protein reveals that many critical receptor-binding residues in the NL63 S protein were also either buried or masked by glycosylation in native trimer, and direct binding of the S protein to its receptor, hACE2, requires significant conformational changes in the S protein 35 . Hiding the receptor binding motif might serve as an important immune evasion strategy to avoid the generation of potent neutralizing antibodies against the receptor-binding motif 35 .",

Since there is a significant sequence difference in CTDs between 1A and 1B, we next determined whether the S1 protein of 1B (1B-S14-752aa) was recognized by our neutralizing antibodies (previously only tested on HKU1 genotype A). The mHKUS-1 antibody, which recognizes the NTD of the HKU1-A S protein, strongly bound the purified 1B-S14-752aa protein ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . To our surprise, no other antibodies (mHKUS-2, mHKUS-3, mHKUS-4, nor mHKUS-6) showed marked binding to 1B-S14-752aa ( Supplementary Fig. 4) , indicating that the epitopes for these antibodies might lie in the sequence differences in the CTDs between 1A and 1B. To further delineate the neutralizing epitopes of mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3, we constructed six 1A/1B chimeras (1A/B-1 to 1A/B-6) using 1A-S310-677aa as the backbone (Fig. 5a) . All chimeric proteins were expressed and their affinity to the neutralizing antibodies was evaluated. and mHKUS-3 (Fig. 5a) , suggesting that the epitopes for mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 may be present between amino acid 505-514, where the tip of the 'horn' is located. The tip has two possible interfaces that are accessible to antibody binding. To ascertain which interface was critical for binding, we investigated where the non-neutralizing antibody mHKUS-6 binds to 1A-S310-677aa. The mHKU-6 strongly bound to 1A/B -1, 1A/B -3, 1A/B -4 and 1A/B -6, but failed to bind to 1A/B -2 and only showed minimal affinity to 1A/B -5 (Fig. 5a) , indicating that the epitopes for mHKUS-6 are located at amino acids 478-503 and 551-571. Further analysis of the structure of 1A-S310-677aa reveals that mHKUS-6 likely binds to the helix formed by amino acid 480-484 and the nearby loop consisting of residues 560-564, next to the outer interface of the tip (Fig. 5a) . Since mHKUS-6 is a non-neutralizing antibody, we reasoned that the neutralizing epitopes of mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 likely lie on the inner interface of the tip and that the tip is highly immunogenic.",

While all mutant proteins were recognized by the mHKUS-6 antibody (Fig. 5b) , indicating that these individual mutations have minimal effect on the overall conformation of 1A-S310-677aa, replacement of the amino acids V509, L510, D511, H512 or W515 with alanine nearly completely abolished the binding of mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3 to 1A-S310-677aa (Fig. 5b) , suggesting that V509, L510, D511, H512, and W515 are essential for binding mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3.

CoVs have evolved to utilize different parts of the S protein to bind sugars, but the NTD of HKU1 is particularly intriguing. The NTDs of OC43 and BCoV fold like a galectin and bind to 9-O-acetyl sialic acid 17, 28 , and their amino acid sequences are highly homologous to the NTD of HKU1. However, despite the fact that several critical sugar-interacting residues in the NTD of BCoV are also conserved in the NTD of HKU1, purified HKU1 NTD neither binds to sugars 17 nor to the cells that bind to HKU1 S1 (ref. 16) . Moreover, while the BCoV NTD significantly decreased BCoV infection of HRT-18 g cells ( Supplementary  Fig. 2B) , the HKU1 NTD did not inhibit any infection of HKU1 virus of primary HTBE cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A and refs  16,29) , indicating that the HKU1 NTD likely does not participate in receptor binding. We performed a glycan array screen for 1A-S310-677aa. Interestingly, despite the lack of an obvious common sugar motif in the binding pattern, 1A-S310-677aa showed strong binding to several different sugars (Supplementary Data 1). Among these, Galb1-4Glcb-Sp0 gave the strongest binding, and the Galb1-4Glc motif was also present in several other sugars that showed higher binding. However, multiple attempts to co-crystalize 1A-S310-677aa with b-lactose (Galb1-4Glc) were unsuccessful, and the binding affinity of 1A-S310-677aa with b-lactose was close to background when measured using isothermal titration calorimetry. Of note, 4-, 7-and 8-O-acetyl sialic acids are absent in our glycan array, and whether these sugars constitute the attachment factor needs to be further studied.",

Since the HKU1 NTD does not appear to bind either one, the CTD must recognize both of them. We propose that these interactions can occur in one of several ways. The receptor binding groove contributes to the binding of one of them. The initial binding at the receptor binding groove may trigger conformational changes, leading to exposure of the second binding site to the other receptor. This is similar to what happens when the HIV envelope protein binds to CD4 and CCR5. The NL63 S protein may use a similar strategy, although it is unknown whether binding of heparan sulfate by NL63 S protein can trigger conformational changes that lead to exposure of ACE2 binding motifs in S protein. Alternatively, the hydrophobic pocket located at the top of the HKU1 CTD, which contains highly conserved residues between HKU1-A and HKU1-B ( Supplementary Fig. 5) , may serve as the other receptor binding site.",

The proteins were purified from the cell supernatantusing nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography and gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200High Performance column (GE Healthcare). The purified HKU1-S1protein was concentrated to 6 mg ml \u00c0 1 and stored in buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH8.0) and 100 mM NaCl.

The crystals were harvested in reservoir buffer with 8.8% (W/V) pentaerythritol ethoxylate (3/4 EO/OH) and 20% sucrose and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Structure determination and refinement. To determine the crystal structure of HKU1 1A-S310-677aa, different techniques, including molecular replacement, selenomethionine derivative and heavy atom soaking techniques, were used to solve the phase problem of 1A-S310-677aa, but attempts were unsuccessful. However, 1A-S310-677aa was cysteine-rich and contained 24 cysteines. Its Bijvoet ratio is approximately 1.77% at 5.96 keV, making the 1A-S310-677aa crystal a suitable candidate for native SAD phasing. The diffraction data collection and structure determination using the native SAD method have been described elsewhere 34 .

Each dataset consisted of 1,800 images collected with 60% transmission (flux of B0.9 \u00c2 10 10 photons per second), and all diffraction data were indexed and integrated using XDS software 36 . Scaling was performed with XSCALE. The data quality was assessed using PHENIX.XTRIAGE 37 . The substructures were determined using SHELXD in 1,000 trials with a cutoff of 3.2 \u00c5. Phasing was performed using SHELXE with combined chain tracing and density modification. From experimentally phased maps, initial models were built with BUCCANEER and PHENIX.AUTOBUILD 37 , and refined by manual model building with COOT 38 . The final dataset had an anomalous signal extending to B3.1 \u00c5 and the overall resolution was better than 2.3 \u00c5 (CC1/2 of highest resolution shell: 89.4%). Final models were obtained using datasets collected at higher energy (1.00 \u00c5) with a resolution at 1.9 \u00c5 and by molecular replacement using the initial model generated from the native SAD datasets.",

Prior to virus infection, apical surface of differentiated HTBE cells were washed twice with DMEM \u00fe 1% BSA and incubated with various amounts of soluble, truncated HKU1 S proteins for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After removal of the soluble S protein, cells were then inoculated with 150 ml of passage three of the amplified HKU1 (#21) virus diluted with an equal volume of each HKU1 S protein onto the apical surface for 4 h. After washing three times with DMEM \u00fe 1%BSA to remove unbound viruses, cells were incubated at 34\u00b0C. HKU1 viruses were harvested by washing once with 150 ml of DMEM \u00fe 1%BSA at 24 and 48 h post inoculation, and cells were fixed at 48 h post-inoculation and assayed for infection by immunofluorescence using a rabbit 1814 polyclonal antibody to HKU1 S protein and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cat# 111-095-144, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA).",

Viral RNAs were extracted from 140 ml of virus-containing apical wash using a QIAamp viral mini kit from Qiagen, according to manufacturer's protocol, and real-time PCR was performed using RNA Ultrasense One-Step qRT-PCR from Invitrogen targeting the N gene of HKU1. About 10 ml of viral RNA extract was mixed with 10 ml of master mix containing 2.3 ml of H 2 O, 1 ml of enzyme, 4 ml of 5 \u00c2 buffer, 0.2 ml of 10mM probe (5 0 -TTGAAGGCTCAGGAAGGTCTGC TTCTAA-3 0 ), 1 ml of 10 mM primer HKU1qPCR-F (5 0 -CTGGTACGATTTTGC CTCAA-3 0 ), 1 ml of 10 mM primer HKU1qPCR-R (5 0 -ATTATTGGGTCCACG TGATTG-3 0 ), and 0.5 ml of MgSO 4 . Following an incubation at 42\u00b0C for 5 min and a denaturation step of 5 min at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of amplification were performed for 3 s at 95\u00b0C and 30 s at 60\u00b0C on a Roche Light Cycler 480 machine. A serially diluted synthetic DNA fragment containing the sequence from 28,849 to 28,949 of the HKU1 genome was used as the quantitative standard to calculate the viral genome copy number in the samples for real-time PCR.",
