The New cluster 1 prevalent during 2009 and 2010 was not found in 2011 but QX-like viruses became prevalent in 2011. The recombination analysis revealed two new S gene recombinants, 11036 and 11052 which might have been derived from recombinations between the New cluster 1 and QX-like viruses and between the K-I and H120 (vaccine) viruses, respectively. In conclusion, multiple IBV genotypes have co-circulated; QX-like viruses have recurred and new recombinants have emerged in Korea. This has enriched molecular epidemiology information of IBV and is useful for the control of IB in Korea.",

Vaccination programs based on live attenuated vaccine H120 strain and inactivated oil-emulsion vaccine containing KM91 and M41 strains have been implemented for many years to control IB [14] . In spite of extensive vaccination, IB is still epidemic in Korea due to the continual emergence of variants [15] . Therefore, it is very crucial to understand the genetic characteristics of Korean IBV field isolates for the control of IB. Some studies on the molecular epidemiology of Korean IBVs have been reported [14, [16] [17] [18] . The studies on Korean IBVs showed that besides K-\u0399 (respiratory strains), K-\u0399\u0399 (nephropathogenic strains, including KM91-like and QX-like subgroups), and K-\u0399\u0399\u0399 (enteric strains), some recent isolates formed two different clusters (New cluster 1 and 2) [15] . However, all these studies were merely focused on S1 or even partial S1 gene sequence, therefore, the comprehensive genetic information of circulating IBV strains in Korea available is limited. Genetic analysis on multiple genes sequence has yet to be fully investigated.",

The relatively high variability was due to point mutations and nucleotide deletion or insertion in the coding regions of 3a and 3b. In contrast to S2 gene the amino acid identities were lower than the nucleotide identities in all of the S1 gene and the majority of 3a, 3b and E genes. It reflected that non-synonymous nucleotide changes were selected during virus evolution. The genes with this trait often played important roles in host adaptation and immune response evasion [24] . The roles of S1 and E proteins have been well documented but those of 3a and 3b are still unclear. The replication of recombinant viruses lacking 3a and/or 3b was not affected in chick kidney and in chicken embryos [8, 12] . Natural IBV isolates lacking 3a and/or 3b proteins, or expressing truncated 3a protein by a 43 nt-deletion at the 3\u2032-end of the gene have been reported but they replicated normally and showed virulence to chicken embryos and chickens [8, 25] . However, the titers of recombinant viruses lacking 3a, decreased earlier than wild type virus after reaching similar titers and a natural IBV isolate lacking start codon of 3a, replicated inefficiently in chicken embryos [8, 12] . Most of IBVs maintained intact 3a and 3b genes during evolution and 3a protein localized closely with MxA which plays a role in antiviral activity in smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, further study to reveal the functions of 3a and 3b are still considered valuable [26] .",

In this study all genotypes reported and Mass type were identified except K-III and New cluster 2. The result strongly suggested that different genotypes of IBVs have been co-circulating in Korea and genetic bases for new recombinant appearance have been established. The 20 out of 27 isolates showed same clustering patterns in S2, 3a, 3b, E and S1-E region gene-based trees as those in S1 gene-based trees. However, seven isolates (11052, 1123, 11036, 9106, 8067, 9011 and 1043) showed different clustering patterns. The discordance of clustering patterns in S1-based tree and other gene-based trees have already been described by others and may be caused by recombination [23, [27] [28] [29] .",

A new live attenuated vaccine strain (K2) has been used since 2010 [18] . The protective epitopes are dispersed in the S1 and N-terminal region of S2 genes, and K2 shared almost the same epitopes with KM91. Antigenic variation is related to amino acid change and most of Korean field isolates except KM91-like and Mass type viruses showed more than 10% and 20% amino acid changes compared to KM91 and M41, respectively. This may be the results of virus evolution under vaccine immunity pressure. According to the chronological comparison of each genotype frequency, the K-I group virus has not been isolated since 2009. The New cluster 1 prevalent during 2009 and 2010 was not found in 2011. The finding agreed with the report that K2 vaccine strain used in 2010 could confer cross protection against the new cluster viruses [15] . In contrast QX-like viruses existed in 2008 and disappeared in 2009 but recurred in 2010 with increasing tendency in 2011. These findings may reflect incomplete protection efficacy of commercial vaccines against QX-like viruses, therefore further investigation may be required to clarify the serological diversity of the QX-like and New cluster 1 viruses. The three isolates 1123, 11044 and 11051 of the KM91-like group were isolated from chicken flocks vaccinated with K2. The 11044 and 11051 were isolated within two weeks of vaccination and maintained the genetic traits of K2, 40 nt and 5 nt deletions in 3a and 3b, respectively, as well as high nucleotide identities of analyzed genes. However, 1123 did not show the genetic traits of K2 and formed a separate cluster from other KM91like viruses in 3a, 3b and E gene-based trees. Thus the pathogenicity of K2-derived field strains should be assessed in further study.",

In our study, convincing evidence showed that recombination event had occurred in the S1 genes of all eight New cluster 1, 11036 (QX-like) and 11052 (Mass) isolates. The New cluster 1 virus was first identified in 2007 and possessed the former half of the S1 gene from QX-like virus and the latter half from KM91-like virus [15] . In a previous study only S1 gene was analyzed and the origins of other genes were unclear. Our results showed recombination events occurred in the S1 gene of New cluster 1 viruses, with their putative parental strains being Korean strain 1123 (KM91-like) and China strain CK/CH/LSD/03I (QX-like), and two crossover regions (nt: 4-907 and 66-900) were observed. All New cluster 1 viruses except for 9106 strain shared high nucleotide and amino acid identities with 1123 strain in S2, 3a, 3b and E gene, indicating that the latter half of S1, S2, 3a, 3b and E genes originated from the KM91-like virus, 1123. Therefore, most of the New cluster 1 viruses were generated by acquisition of the first 900 nucleotides of QX-like virus S1 gene by a KM91-like virus. However, the fact that the 9106 strain shared relatively low nucleotide and amino acid identities with KM91 strain in the S2 gene, reflects that the New cluster 1 viruses are not clonal.",

Also, the possible recombination events had been predicted between New cluster 1 and QX-like, K-I and vaccine strain H120 (Mass), KM91-like and QX-like, respectively. The predicted recombination events involved all five genotypes. The extensiveness of predicted recombinations in IBV is more than formerly thought. What is more, we found recombinant 11036 might come from recombinant virus (New cluster 1). These results reflected the complex and reticulated evolution of IBV. Hot spots tend to lie immediately upstream of the S glycoprotein gene, as well as in nonstructural proteins 2, 3 and 16, although evidence of recombination was found in every sequence analyzed and was distributed throughout the entire genome [22] . All the hot spots in our study lie immediately upstream of the S glycoprotein gene. The S1 subunit plays a role in attachment to host cell receptors and contains conformationallydependent virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes [22] . Spike is also involved in membrane fusion and viral entry into the host cell [22] . The breakpoints near or in spike have the potential to lead to the emergence of new serotypes of IBV or new coronaviruses [22] . The genetic diversity and recombinant events of Korean IBV isolates explains why IBV isolates could escape immune response and obtain adaptability in Korea.",

The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences alignments were generated using the ClustalW Multiple Alignment method of BioEdit version 7.0.9.0 and compared with those of 35 reference IBV strains (Except for S1 gene compared with 50 reference IBV strains) retrieved from the GenBank database with the accession numbers listed in supplementary material (Supplementary Table S3) . A comprehensive phylogenetic study based on the nucleotide sequence of individual genes was conducted in order to determine the genetic relationship between different genes. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the Neighbor-joining method and Maximum-likelihood method using MEGA 5.05 version. Neighbor-joining trees and Maximum-likelihood trees were constructed based on the Kimura-2 parameter model and Tamura-Nei model, respectively. The bootstrap values were determined from 1,000 replicates of the original data.",

The RT-PCR reaction was carried out using Onestep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Three overlapping fragments were synthesized and amplified with gene specific primers, which were designed in the conserved region of M41 (DQ834384) and described in Table 2 . The RT reaction for synthesis of cDNA was incubated at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, and then heated at was increased from the default setting 30 bp to 60 bp. The highest acceptable P value was 0.05 and the detection of recombination events was applied between sequences sharing 0 and 100% identity. Seven algorithms in RDP 4.14, including RDP, GENECONV, BootScan, MaxChi, Chimaera, SiScan and 3Seq were used to evaluate the recombination events. Two phylogenetic trees, one constructed from the portion of the alignment between the inferred breakpoints, and the other from the remainder of the alignment were drawn and compared to assess recombination events further. Similarity plot and BootScan analyses were performed using the SimPlot program (version 3.5.1) to confirm further recombination events and recombination breakpoints.",
