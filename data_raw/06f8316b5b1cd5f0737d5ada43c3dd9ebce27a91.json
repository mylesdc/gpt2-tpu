TB is a major cause of illness and death worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa. Despite the fact that TB is a curable illness, the tragedy is that TB remains the biggest killer in the world as a single pathogen. The aim of this study was to determine the experiences of nurses caring for TB patients at a regional hospital in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive designs were used. A non-probability purposive sampling method was used to select the participants. The personal experiences of six nurses with more than five years' experience caring for TB patients at a regional hospital were explored, and it was guided by data saturation. Data were collected through in-depth individual interviews. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's method. Trustworthiness was ensured and ethical considerations were observed in this study. The research findings revealed six major themes from the raw data: challenges of the working environment, problems impacting on the quality of nursing care, fear, anxiety, stress and risk of contracting infection, nurses' perceptions towards patients, support structure available in the hospital, and support needs for the nurses. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address the challenges experienced by nurses caring for communicable diseases through provision of a positive practice work environment.",

Nurses in high TB burden settings are at higher risk of developing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) when compared to the general population, due to their exposure to the large number of smear-positive TB cases managed at hospitals or healthcare facilities [3] . Working in a high-risk TB setting can lead to harrowing experiences for healthcare, especially where health facilities are poorly equipped and managed. Health Care Workers (HCWs), especially nurses, have higher rates of latent and active TB than the general population due to persistent occupational TB exposure, particularly in settings where there is a high prevalence of undiagnosed TB in healthcare facilities and TB infection control programmes are absent or poorly implemented [4] .",

In 2009, the Limpopo Provincial TB Annual Report [6] stated that the number of TB cases in Vhembe district was 2194. In 2012, Vhembe district had the highest number of TB patients in the Limpopo Province [7] . Tshitangano et al. [8] , further indicated that TB infection control plans were not available at hospitals in Vhembe district and this contributed to the high number of TB patients. Infection control requires both human and material resources for maintenance and support [8] . In line with this assertion, Gursimrat [9] argues that one of the major challenges to control TB infection includes poor primary healthcare infrastructure. In addition, shortage of space and beds in the wards hinder separation of Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB) and TB patients in healthcare facilities and these increases risk of contracting infection in the wards [10] . Healthcare-associated TB has become a major occupational hazard for healthcare workers. It was therefore imperative to explore and describe the experiences of nurses caring for tuberculosis patients at a regional hospital in Vhembe district, Limpopo Province.",

Therefore, it is important for the hospital CEO and nursing unit managers to support them in order for them to remain productive. The hospitals should make sure that they order quality equipment, and other materials to assist nurses to do their work effectively. Nurses should be provided with adequate and necessary training to empower them with relevant skills and knowledge. Good management empowers employees in the hospital in different ways and also listens to their requests. Below are the comments made by the participants: Nurse (N5) said: \"Hmmm, we believe that for now we just need special support from the management and all TB programme managers, to empower us with knowledge maybe by having workshops with us or arranging in-service training. It is crucial that we gain more knowledge on how to communicate with patients who are showing side effects or who are likely to default when they are at home. I believe that if we can be empowered with knowledge, the death rate and the spread of disease can be reduced.\"",
