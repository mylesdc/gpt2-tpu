Cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assays that test for compounds active against hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV and SARS coronavirus utilize recombinant viruses and changes in reporter gene expression in engineered cell lines to measure antiviral activity [5] [6] [7] [8] . For example, a dual replicon assay system that combined reporter gene assays and FRET was used to screen for drugs effective against HCV [5] . Advantages of these cited assays include rapid readout and an ability to perform screens with viruses that must be handled under elevated biosafety conditions.",

The theory behind this approach is that amplification of the antiviral response will override virusencoded immune evasion strategies and restrict replication to subclinical levels.",

Several rotavirus vaccines in clinical trials show promising efficacy, suggesting that a long-term goal of rotavirus gastroenteritis becoming a vaccine preventable disease is attainable [10] . However, the significant mortality associated with rotavirus illness in the developing world suggests approaches to enhance the antiviral immune response and consequent natural resistance to rotavirus infection need to be explored. The importance of this issue and the significant amount of data available on rotavirus replication led us to use this virus as a model system. We report development of an assay that uses unmodified adherent epithelial cells to measure reductions in rotavirus infectivity in response to treatment of cells with a variety of compounds. A natural product library consisting of 280 compounds derived from plant extracts was screened, and several compounds that inhibited rotavirus infectivity in a dose-dependent manner were identified. All of the compounds that passed the designated criteria of a hit have been reported to have direct effects on inflammatory or antiviral gene expression or on virus replication. Development of such a platform to screen compounds for the ability to diminish virus replication easily can be applied to other virus systems where direct measurement of activity in epithelial cells is desirable.",

Similarly, we adapted an immunofluorescent (IF) infectivity assay to a moderate-throughput screening (MTS) format to measure changes in rotavirus infectivity following treatment of cells with compounds from a natural product library. In the standard IF assay, MA104 cells are cultured to confluence in 96-well microtiter plates, then infected with rotavirus in triplicate wells and incubated for 18-20 hours. Virus replication then is detected by indirect IF and replication is quantified by counting fluorescent focus forming units (FFU) in a dilution series by fluorescence microscopy. To adapt the assay to an MTS format that would necessarily eliminate manual counting of FFU, an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was used in place of the FITC-conjugated antibody, and the assay was developed with chemiluminescent substrate. Virus replication then was quantified in a microplate fluorometer with readout of relative light units (rlu). Use of an enzymatic signal to measure infectivity was validated by comparing changes in chemiluminescent signal versus virus dose measured by IF. The data shown in figure 1 illustrate the range of increase in chemiluminescent signal that corresponds with increasing infectious units in a 10 -1/3 virus dilution series. These data demonstrate that changes in the magnitude of the enzymatic signal accurately reflect changes in the number of infectious units measured by IF.",

Signals were developed with chemiluminescent substrate and measured on a ThermoElectron Fluroskan and scored as relative light units (rlu). Error bars are standard errors of the means (n = 5). In order to establish internal inhibition controls for the assay, we measured reductions in infectivity in response to cytokines known to induce antiviral gene expression. Cells were pre-treated with IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, or a combination of both cytokines. IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 both reduced infectivity, and the magnitude of reduction increased to ~80% when cells were treated with the combination of both cytokines ( Figure 2 ). The combination of IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 consistently yielded the greatest reduction in virus replication. Therefore, this mixture of cytokines, and IL-2 which is not known to have direct antiviral activity, were included as internal positive and negative controls, respectively, in each plate of every experiment.",

We screened a library consisting of 280 natural products purified from plant extracts, and several compounds were identified that reproducibly inhibited rotavirus replication without cytotoxicity. The assay has been validated statistically, as well as by the observation that compounds selected for further study were purchased from different sources and showed reproducible inhibition of virus replication. In addition, follow-up assays measured reductions in infectivity in response to compound treatment in the standard rotavirus IF assay and the degrees of replication inhibition and dose-dependence correlated with the values obtained in NF\u03baB activation in infected and uninfected cells in the presence of selected compounds the MTS assay. We calculated a true hit rate for the natural product library of 5% and a false positive rate of ~20%. We performed numerous optimization assays to reduce variability presented by variation in growth properties of our cell line. We also have initiated a screen of a 10,000 compound synthetic chemical library, and after screening 2500 compounds, our true hit rate is 1.8% (data not shown). These true hit percentages yield a large, but not prohibitive, number of compounds for follow-up studies both in vitro and in animal models.

However, two of the four compounds selected for follow-up study activated NF\u03baB and induced IL-8 secretion. Moreover, the majority of compounds called a hit in the screen for which data is available has been previously described to affect inflammatory or anti-inflammatory gene expression or pathogen growth in vitro (Table 1) .

Important for the studies described here, natural products are known to modulate immune responses and cell signaling pathways. Table 1 lists compounds designated hits in this study, along with some of the reported functions. Compounds were grouped into those chosen for further study (Group A), and those known to stimulate or repress inflammatory responses or innate immune signaling pathways and two with unknown functions (Group B). Also included in Group B are compounds with reported antiviral, antibacterial, or anti-protozoan activity. We have not yet deciphered mechanisms by which these compounds inhibit rotavirus replication in vitro. However, the fact that several of the compounds, for example, abietic acid, genistein, and capsaicin, interfere with NF\u03baB activation and cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2) expression is noteworthy (see Table 1 for references). NF\u03baB activation is an important regulator of COX2 expression; COX2 activity and COX-mediated prostaglandin synthesis is necessary for rotavirus infectivity in CaCo-2 intestinal cells [19] . Interestingly, the addition of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) restored infectivity reduced by the COX inhibitor [19] and three of the compounds we chose for follow-up studies all have an inhibitory effect on either synthesis or release of PGE 2 (see Table 1 references). The ability of \u03b1-mangostin and 18 \u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid to inhibit rotavirus replication when both compounds activate NF\u03baB is most likely because antiviral states are established upon treatment of the cells with each compound prior to infection. The definitive mechanisms by which the compounds identified in this natural product library screen warrant further investigation.",

Second, these viruses are well characterized with respect to structure, antigenicity, and mechanisms of virus replication, and thus an excellent resource for mechanistic follow-up studies is available. Third, rotavirus is promiscuous in its tropism for cultured cell lines, and multiple cell lines of different types and species of origin, including primary cell lines [20] , support productive Finally, the fact that rotavirus employs a mechanism to down-regulate antiviral gene expression allows consideration of possible evasion strategies when selecting and testing candidate immune potentiators [21, 22] .
