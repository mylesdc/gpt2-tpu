            "text": "In order to investigate the mechanisms of persistent foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection in cattle, transcriptome alterations associated with the FMDV carrier state were characterized using a bovine whole-transcriptome microarray. Eighteen cattle (8 vaccinated with a recombinant FMDV A vaccine, 10 non-vaccinated) were challenged with FMDV A 24 Cruzeiro, and the gene expression profiles of nasopharyngeal tissues collected between 21 and 35 days after challenge were compared between 11 persistently infected carriers and 7 non-carriers. Carriers and non-carriers were further compared to 2 na\u00efve animals that had been neither vaccinated nor challenged. At a controlled false-discovery rate of 10% and a minimum difference in expression of 50%, 648 genes were differentially expressed between FMDV carriers and non-carriers, and most (467) had higher expression in carriers. Among these, genes associated with cellular proliferation and the immune response-such as chemokines, cytokines and genes regulating T and B cells-were significantly overrepresented. Differential gene expression was significantly correlated between non-vaccinated and vaccinated animals (biological correlation +0.97), indicating a similar transcriptome profile across these groups. Genes related to prostaglandin E 2 production and the induction of regulatory T cells were overexpressed in carriers. In contrast, tissues from non-carrier animals expressed higher levels of complement regulators and pro-apoptotic genes that could promote virus clearance. Based on these findings, we propose a working hypothesis for FMDV persistence in nasopharyngeal tissues of cattle, in which the virus may be maintained by an impairment of apoptosis and the local suppression of cell-mediated antiviral immunity by inducible regulatory T cells.",

The nasopharyngeal epithelium (NP) has been identified as a site of both primary [12] [13] [14] and persistent [8, 10, [15] [16] [17] [18] ] FMDV infection in cattle; other studies have also reported the detection of persistent viral genome and antigen in regional lymph nodes of the nasopharynx [19] [20] [21] . Zhang and Alexandersen [22, 23] have suggested that the rate of viral clearance from a tissue, rather than the peak viral load during acute infection, is associated with persistence. Apoptotic processes, initiated from within infected cells or through effector molecules of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are essential for the removal of virus-infected cells [24] . An earlier study using the bovine transcriptome microarray suggested a potential role for the inhibition of apoptosis in persistent FMDV infection [25] . That study demonstrated relatively lower expression of pro-apoptotic genes in the NP compared to the lungs, which are permissive to FMDV replication during early infection [12] but do not become persistently infected [10] .",

Early defects in proliferation, IL-2 production and cytotoxicity are followed by the loss of TNF and IFN-\u03b3 production at late stages. With the increasing expression of inhibitory receptors like PD-1 and CTLA-4, exhausted cells become more responsive to inhibitory signals, resulting in further decreased effector function [29] . Apart from cell-surface inhibitory receptors, suppressive cytokines and regulatory T (T reg ) cells are centrally involved in the pathogenesis of T-cell exhaustion [28, 30] .",

            "text": "Cell-mediated immunity is an important mechanism for the clearance of infected cells and a highly regulated process. Among the overrepresented T-cell-receptor signaling genes, PD-1 (encoded by PDCD1) and CTLA-4 are important inhibitory receptors that are involved in Tcell exhaustion [46] , which is commonly associated with persistent viral infections [47] . Functional effector T cells can transiently express inhibitory receptors during activation and PD-1 is constitutively expressed by follicular T-helper cells [48] . High expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, however, is a key feature of the exhaustion of CD4 and CD8 T cells [28] . PD-1 and other cell surface inhibitory receptors as well as transcription factors that co-regulate T-cell exhaustion (CTLA-4, LAG-3, BTLA, and Tim-3, BATF, NFAT1 and eomesodermin) [47, 49] were all significantly overexpressed in NP tissues from persistently FMDV-infected carriers ( Table 6) . T-cell exhaustion is caused by chronic antigenic stimulation of T-cells in an immunosuppressive cytokine milieu [49] , and T reg cells can contribute to this process through the production of IL-10 and the induction of tolerogenic DCs [50] . The genes for TGF\u03b2 and IL-10 as well as many cell surface and intracellular molecules associated with type 1 inducible T reg (Tr1) cells (LAG-3, TNFRSF18/GITR, TNFRSF9/CD137, ICOS/CD278, ITGB2/CD18 and the transcription factors MAF/c-Maf, ZBTB32/ROG, EGR2, STAT3 and STAT5A [51] ) were significantly overexpressed in NP tissues from carriers (Table 7) . Tr1 cells are a subset of T cells that have strong immunosuppressive properties. They suppress effector T cells via IL-10-and TGF\u03b2-dependent mechanisms, but do not express Forkhead box 3 (FOXP3), the signature transcription factor of natural T reg cells [52, 53] . In contrast to natural T reg cells, which originate in the thymus, Tr1 cells are induced in the periphery by exposure to their specific antigen in the presence of inhibitory cytokines [54] . Several of the overrepresented functional terms in carriers (Table 3) involve cytokine and chemokine signaling. Specifically, IL-16 and the macrophage-derived chemokine CCL22 were significantly higher expressed in persistently FMDV-infected NP tissues (Table 7) . IL-16 and CCL22 preferentially attract T reg cells, and CCL22 also attracts T H 2-polarized T lymphocytes [55, 56] . IL-21, an important GC cytokine produced by follicular T helper cells [57] , was significantly higher expressed in NP tissues from carriers. IL-21 has a suppressive effect on FOXP3 + natural T reg cells, but induces FOXP3 -Tr1 cells [48, 52] .",

These genes were significantly higher expressed in the non-carriers than in the carriers (Table 10) , and this difference was mostly caused by a significant downregulation in carriers compared to the controls (S3 Table) . A member of the immunomodulating guanylate binding protein family, GBP6, was highly overexpressed in non-carriers compared to carriers and controls. Three of the 15 probes with the largest difference in signal intensity between non-carriers and carriers mapped to this gene (Fig 2) . Toll-like receptors are another key component of the innate immune system. TLR10 was significantly more highly expressed in carriers, both when compared to non-carriers and to na\u00efve controls. TLR10 is an anti-inflammatory pattern recognition receptor that is also expressed on T reg cells [72, 73] . Similarly, CD200 (OX2) and its receptor CD200R, both also overexpressed in carriers, have broad inhibitory effects on innate and adaptive immunity. CD200R activation mediates the polarization of effector T cells into Tr1 cells producing IL-10 and TGF\u03b2, modulates the cytokine environment from T H 1 to T H 2, and facilitates the synthesis of anti-inflammatory mediators [74] . Many pathogens exploit the CD200/CD200R signaling pathway, e.g. to restrict viral-induced inflammation during respiratory influenza infection or to interfere with the control of coronavirus infection [75] .",

This is the first time that tissues from FMDV carriers and non-carriers were analyzed with a bovine whole-transcriptome microarray, and we identified several sets of differentially expressed genes that could explain the mechanisms underlying the persistence or clearance of FMDV infection in these animals. Many of the genes that were more highly expressed in carriers suggest a broad activation of immune cells in persistently FMDV-infected tissues. Apoptosis plays a vital role in immune homeostasis [76] , and the observed regulation of pro-and anti-apoptotic genes could be a consequence of immune system activation with or without impact on FMDV persistence. Despite the novelty of these findings, this work should be considered to be an effort towards generating hypotheses based upon a single modality of investigation, the bovine whole-transcriptome microarray.
