To address these points, we retrospectively applied Manitz and Hohle's Bayesian outbreak detection algorithm (BODA) [1, 2] . This algorithm generates alarms signalling that the underlying process is out-of-control relative to the recent past. Alarms generated by the algorithm were compared with two outbreaks that occurred during the study period-the autumnwinter wave of the 2009 swine flu (H1N1) pandemic and the seasonal influenza outbreak of 2011.",

Fourth, because it is widely available in the R surveillance package [4] . Finally, because it has few adjustable parameters in the surveillance package, which decreases experimenter degrees of freedom. We viewed it as especially important to reduce experimenter degrees of freedom given the limited number of outbreaks that were analyzed in our study (n = 2). The parameters were chosen a priori-they were not tuned.",

Although it would be more common to learn parameters from the first weeks of data, this was not possible because the autumn wave of the H1N1 epidemic coincided with that period. The number of thermometers used during each time segment (week or day) was included in BODA as a covariate. The probability of a false alert was set at \u22643 per year for the main analysis and at 1-5 per year for secondary analyses.",

We then checked whether outbreaks continued to be detected across the range of allowed false alert rates. To examine timeliness, we ran the outbreak detection analysis twice. First, we ran it on fever data that had been binned into single week intervals, simulating the case of having data available on a weekly basis, which is currently the most common situation in US biosurveillance of influenza and some other diseases. Second, we ran the BODA on fever data that had been binned into 1-day intervals as a proxy for real-time availability. We then compared the earliest dates at which increased fever rates were detected during the periods of the influenza outbreaks, using the weekly and daily data with various false alert criteria.",

The light blue and dark blue areas show the weekly and daily rates of fevers, respectively. For example, data from the first week of August 2011 show that around 5 fevers were measured per thermometer. The outbreak detection algorithm produces an epidemic threshold (red lines) that is used to judge whether an outbreak is detected. When the observed fever rates exceed this threshold, an alarm is declared (red triangles). Using fever rates from the Boston ED, the algorithm successfully detected both the autumn-winter wave of the 2009-2010 swine flu pandemic and the seasonal flu epidemic of 2011. Outbreak detection was successful for both the weekly data and the daily data, even though the daily data appear quite noisy to the eye.",

Here, we defined a false alarm as any alarm issued outside of the epidemic periods shown in the figure (see the Methods section for more details). A key advantage of the Bayesian outbreak detection algorithm is that it allows the expected number of false alarms to be established prospectively. In the figure, we arbitrarily employed the criterion that an average of \u22643 false alarms should be issued per year. Both the weekly and daily analyses satisfied this criterion (weekly, 0 false alarms; daily, 2 apparent false alarms in 2 years). In additional analyses, we employed false alarm criteria ranging from \u22641 to \u22645 per year. While the weekly outbreak detection analysis showed diminishing ability to detect the outbreaks for low false alarm criteria, the daily analysis detected both outbreaks for all of the false alarm criteria, suggesting that daily fever data provided robust evidence of these outbreaks (Additional Table 1 ).",

As compared with the weekly data, the daily data provided 18 days of advanced notice for the H1N1 pandemic and 5 days of advanced notice for the seasonal flu outbreak with \u22643 false alarms per year. These indications are promising, especially because weekly CDC surveillance on influenza-like illness and laboratory-confirmed influenza is usually subject to several additional days of delay in practice, as the data are compiled. However, our analysis was importantly limited by the fact that our analysis only investigated two epidemic periods, both of which were of influenza.",

A Bayesian outbreak detection algorithm was retrospectively applied to weekly (light blue) and daily (dark blue) fever rates per thermometer.When the observed fever rates crossed the epidemic threshold generated by the algorithm (red lines), an alarm was declared (red triangles). Both of the known outbreaks of influenza (regions shaded red) were detected using the data from this emergency department. The daily data provided earlier alarms, and both the weekly and daily data satisfied the criterion of \u22643 false alarms per year. Table 1 . Applying the Bayesian outbreak detection algorithm to daily and weekly fever rate data, with various false alarm criteria. Applying the detection algorithm daily detected both outbreaks in all cases. Further, the daily analysis generally provided advanced notice of outbreaks in comparison with the weekly analysis, or identified outbreaks that were undetected by the weekly analysis. Inf. * Criteria for acceptable rate of false alarms, as specified in the Bayesian outbreak detection algorithm. ** Observed rate of false alarms, including every alarm triggered during a period other than the CDC-defined swine flu pandemic and seasonal flu outbreak periods in New England.",
