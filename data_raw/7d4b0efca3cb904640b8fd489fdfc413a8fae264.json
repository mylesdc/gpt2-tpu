In this study, TTSPs including TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, and MSPL were tested for their ability to facilitate PEDV replication in Vero cells. Our results showed that TMPRSS2 and MSPL played significant roles in the stages of cell-cell fusion and virus-cell fusion, whereas HAT and DESC1 exhibited weaker effects. This activation may be involved in the interaction between TTSPs and the PEDV S protein, as the S protein extensively co-localized with TMPRSS2 and MSPL and could be cleaved by co-expression with TMPRSS2 or MSPL. Moreover, the use of Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2 and MSPL facilitated PEDV replication in the absence of exogenous trypsin. In sum, we identified two host proteases, TMPRSS2 and MSPL, which may provide insights and a novel method for enhancing viral titers, expanding virus production, and improving the adaptability of PEDV isolates in vitro.",

It is characterized by vomiting and lethal, watery diarrhea, and is becoming a global problem [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . PED was first reported in feeder pigs and fattening swine in the United Kingdom in 1971 [8] . Since then, the disease has emerged in many pig-producing countries in Europe and Asia, resulting in tremendous economic losses to the pig industry. PEDV mainly infects the villous epithelial cells of the small intestine, which are rich in proteases, and causes atrophy of the villi, resulting in dehydration and diarrhea. Currently, although PEDV can be propagated in Vero cells treated with trypsin, which mediates the activation of virions for membrane fusion by cleaving the spike (S) glycoprotein [9, 10] , propagation of PEDV in vitro in a more Table 1 .

No TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, or MSPL mRNA was detected in the Vero cells in this study. Next, the effects of these proteases on PEDV replication in Vero cells exogenously expressing TTSPs were examined. Following transfection, Vero cells were infected with PEDV in the presence or absence of trypsin. As shown in Figure 2A , in the absence of trypsin, the viral titers of PEDV propagated in Vero cells transfected with pCMV-Myc expressing TMPRSS2 and MSPL were clearly higher than those of PEDV propagated in Vero cells expressing HAT and DESC1. Among the TTSPs, the viral titers in Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2 and MSPL were almost 10 2.5 to 10 4.5 times higher than those in the empty-plasmid group and even 3-to 30-fold higher than those in Vero cells cultured with trypsin (3 \u00b5g/mL). Moreover, the viral RNA levels in each group were determined by qPCR at different time points post-infection. As shown in Figure 2B , at 72 h post-infection, viral RNA levels in Vero cells expressing MSPL were significantly higher than those in the other groups, and the viral mRNA relative quantity in trypsin-treated cells was slightly higher than that in TMPRSS2-transfected cells. However, the efficacy of TMPRSS2 in activating PEDV replication was almost the same as that of 3 \u00b5g/mL trypsin and was higher than that of HAT or Furthermore, the TTSP inhibitor AEBSF-HCl was used to evaluate the effects of TTSPs on trypsin-independent PEDV entry. The cytotoxicity of AEBSF-HCl at the recommended concentrations was first tested to exclude cytotoxic effects. Then, TTSP-transfected Vero cells were treated with AEBSF-HCl and infected with PEDV. The pCMV-Myc-transfected cells were infected with PEDV in the absence of trypsin. At 12 h post-infection, viral RNA levels were determined by qPCR. As shown in Figure 2C , AEBSF-HCl induced strong inhibitory activity, resulting in dose-dependent decreases in the viral RNA levels. The viral RNA levels of PEDV in MSPL-transfected Vero cells treated with 500 \u00b5M AEBSF-HCl were significantly higher than those of cells transfected with other TTSPs. These results also indicate that TTSPs such as TMPRSS2 and MSPL play an important role in PEDV entry, suggesting that TMPRSS2 and MSPL promote PEDV replication better than trypsin. ",

TTSP-transfected Vero cells were infected with processed viral samples, and the relative RNA levels of PEDV propagated in Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2, MSPL, HAT, or DESC1 were determined for three serial passages. As shown in Figure 7A , TMPRSS2 and MSPL facilitated strain A replication to an almost 20-fold higher extent than the TTSP control (pCMV-Myc group) after three serial passages. Additionally, HAT could also promote culture of strain A in Vero cells. We speculate that there may be an active site of HAT on the S protein of strain A. The effect of trypsin on the isolation of strain B was not significant. However, the effect of strain B cultured in Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2 and MSPL was better than trypsin treatment; the viral mRNA level in Vero cells expressing MSPL was two times higher than that of the trypsin group after three serial passages ( Figure 7B ). TMPRSS2 and MSPL facilitated the propagation of the two PEDV isolates (strains A and B) in Vero cells efficiently and steadily, suggesting a promising approach for PEDV propagation of clinical samples in the absence of trypsin treatment.",

Currently, severe PED is one of the most important diseases affecting pig farming in China [54] . However, the effectiveness of the CV777-based vaccine has been questioned because PED outbreaks have also occurred in vaccinated herds [55] . Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the protective efficacy of vaccines and to develop new vaccines. However, PEDV isolation in vitro remains challenging, as the isolated virus may gradually lose infectivity upon continued passaging in cell cultures supplemented with trypsin [1] . Recently, we attempted to isolate PEDV from clinical samples, using porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and found that PEDV isolates were better adapted to growth in IECs than in Vero cells [34] , indicating that some trypsin-like proteases present in the IECs facilitated the propagation of PEDV. Moreover, previous research has suggested that several TTSPs located in the mucosal epithelium play critical roles in viral infectivity through the activation of viral surface proteins [23, 27, 31, 32] . At the beginning of this study, we designed primers according to the predicted sequences of swine TTSPs from national center for biotechnology information (NCBI), and attempted to amplify the full-length TTSP genes from the trachea, bronchus, lung, and small intestine tissues of piglet and IECs. However, we failed to obtain the porcine TTSP genes. We speculate that differences may exist between the actual sequences and predicted sequences. Although TTSPs are the host proteases of respiratory and digestive tract mucosa, the TTSP expression levels may be low or limited in some conditions or over a period of time, which results in difficulty in obtaining actual porcine TTSP genes. Therefore, we studied human TTSPs (TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, and MSPL) to explore their effects on PEDV replication.",

            "text": "The TTSP family is composed of more than 20 members and divided into four subfamilies: the HAT/DESC subfamily, hepsin/TMPRSS/enteropeptidase subfamily (including TMPRSS2 and MSPL), matriptase subfamily, and corin subfamily. TMPRSS2 and MSPL are predominantly expressed in the fetal liver and kidney [56] and on the brush-border of the duodenum [57] . HAT is predominantly expressed in the trachea [58, 59] , whereas DESC1 is restricted to the epithelia of the skin and oral cavity [60, 61] . In this study, we confirmed the presence of TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, and MSPL in the small intestines of normal piglets and IECs, and we also found that the mRNA levels of these TTSPs increased in PEDV-infected small intestine tissues and IECs. Whether or not the endogenous presence of TTSPs in the small intestines of piglets contributes to viral spread in infected piglets remains to be determined, and knock-out mice, as well as specific protease inhibitors, might be useful tools for these endeavors. Previous studies demonstrated that TTSPs play key roles in hormone or growth factor activation, epithelial differentiation, and the initiation of proteolytic cascades [62, 63] . The mechanism underlying the effects of up-regulated TTSPs in PEDV-infected piglet small intestine tissues requires further investigation. The inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and MSPL may be potential candidates for treatment of PEDV. Moreover, according to a comparison of the promotion effects of these TTSPs on viral replication and titers in vitro, TMPRSS2 and MSPL were particularly strong, suggesting that members of the hepsin/TMPRSS/enteropeptidase subfamily may activate PEDV emergence due to their specific structure. Additional research is underway to determine whether other members of the hepsin/TMPRSS/enteropeptidase subfamily are able to activate PEDV.",

MSPL exhibited the strongest effect followed by TMPRSS2. It has been suggested that the addition of trypsin mediates cell-cell fusion in PEDV-infected cells [64] , thus demonstrating that TMPRSS2 and MSPL exhibit trypsin-like characteristics that facilitate cell-cell fusion. However, it should be noted that the cell-cell fusion assay allows the interaction of cell surfaces on which large amounts of receptors and proteases may be expressed, and therefore it might not fully mirror virus-cell fusion.",

Thus, we used the previously published TTSP inhibitor AEBSF-HCl [41] to assess whether TTSPs (TMPRSS2, HAT, DESC1, and MSPL) activate PEDV entry into cells in the absence of trypsin. We found that viral RNA levels were decreased in a dose-dependent manner following AEBSF-HCl treatment. Additionally, we found that the level of viral mRNA increased in a dose-dependent manner in Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2 and MSPL, but not HAT and DESC1 at the stage of virus entry [65] . These results suggest that the activating effect of TMPRSS2 and, in particular, MSPL, on PEDV entry into cells was greater than that of HAT and DESC1. Although Liu et al. found that TMPRSS2 did not increase the entry of PEDV pseudoviruses into Huh-7 cells [66] , several studies suggested that some candidate cellular enzymes, such as TTSPs could activate PEDV replication [41, 64] , and that human TMPRSS2 has been shown to enhance the multicycle replication of PEDV [33] .",

Thus, an assessment of the co-localization of TTSPs with the PEDV S protein was performed, and our results showed that the PEDV S protein co-localized extensively with MSPL and TMPRSS2, indicating that these TTSPs might interact with the PEDV S protein to promote viral entry into cells. It is worth noting that PEDV-activating TTSPs co-localized with S protein, whereas inactive TTSPs did not, despite robust expression (such as DESC1) in the cellular system analyzed. It is therefore conceivable that the cellular localization of a TTSP, apart from its substrate specificity, might determine whether the protease can activate S and other viral glycoproteins; this possibility deserves further investigation. It has been confirmed that TTSPs cleave and activate the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins, and the cleaved fragments of the S protein may induce subtle conformational changes that increase its sensitivity for binding to its receptor [15] . We also attempted to verify the cleavage of S protein by TTSPs, and we found TMPRSS2 and MSPL could cleave PEDV S protein with the same size of cleavage fragments, but HAT and DESC1 could not. Therefore, our study further confirmed the roles of TMPRSS2 and MSPL in the PEDV S protein activation. However, the mechanisms of S protein activation by TTSPs for PEDV entry have not been clearly demonstrated, and additional research is under way to further investigate these mechanisms.",

These results indicate that TMPRSS2 and MSPL might be more conducive to PEDV isolation in vitro than exogenous proteases like trypsin, suggesting a promising approach for PEDV isolation in vitro, using Vero cell lines continuously expressing TMPRSS2 or MSPL.
