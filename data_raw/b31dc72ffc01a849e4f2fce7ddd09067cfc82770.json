            "text": "Background: Inappropriate use of antibiotics increases resistance and reduces their effectiveness. Despite evidencebased guidelines, antibiotics are still commonly used to treat infections likely caused by respiratory viruses. In this study, we examined the temporal relationships between antibiotic usage and respiratory infections in the Republic of Korea. Methods: The number of monthly antibiotic prescriptions and the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections between 2010 and 2015 at all primary care clinics were obtained from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. The monthly detection rates of respiratory viruses, including adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, human coronavirus, and human rhinovirus, were collected from Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cross-correlation analysis was conducted to quantify the temporal relationship between antibiotic use and respiratory virus activities as well as respiratory infections in primary clinics. Results: The monthly use of different classes of antibiotic, including penicillins, other beta-lactam antibacterials, macrolides and quinolones, was significantly correlated with influenza virus activity. These correlations peaked at the 0-month lag with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.45 (p < 0.01), 0.46 (p < 0.01), 0.40 (p < 0.01), and 0.35 (< 0.01), respectively. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between acute bronchitis and antibiotics, including penicillin (0.73, p < 0.01), macrolides (0.74, p < 0.01), and quinolones (0.45, p < 0.01), at the 0-month lag. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is a significant temporal relationship between influenza virus activity and antibiotic use in primary clinics. This relationship indicates that interventions aimed at reducing influenza cases in addition to effort to discourage the prescription of antibiotics by physicians may help to decrease unnecessary antibiotic consumption.",

In the Republic of Korea, the number of antibiotic prescriptions is relatively higher (31.7 defined daily dose [DDD] per 1000 inhabitants per day) than in other member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (mean, 23.7 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day) [3] . In Korea, the majority of antibiotics (ca. 90%) are prescribed in primary care and mainly for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs; ca. 57%) [4] . ARTIs are mainly viral in origin, are generally self-limiting, and do not require antibiotics [5, 6] . Secondary bacterial pneumonia is the most important clinical complication of respiratory viral infections. However, previous studies have shown that antibiotics do not improve outcomes for patients with ARTIs [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

Seasonal variation of antibiotic prescriptions has been documented in the United States [17, 20] , Canada [21] , and Europe [22] . Furthermore, it has also been shown that the incidence of influenza is highly correlated with the seasonal pattern of antibiotic prescriptions and that changes in testing can affect prescription rates of antibiotics [23] [24] [25] [26] . These previous findings support our results that the seasonality of antibiotic use is significantly associated with influenza virus activity in the country.

This is not surprising as pneumonia is an uncommon diagnosis in the outpatient setting compared to acute bronchitis (4334 cases per 100,000 persons). Pneumonia is a quite severe infection and often requires hospitalization for confirmation. Thus, many acute bronchitis prescriptions might reflect uncertainty on the clinician part as to whether the patient may have pneumonia, and are prescribing out of an abundance of caution despite the potential downside consequences of unnecessary antibiotic use.",

Conservative management is the main treatment option for patients with tonsillitis except in the case of streptococcal infections (detection rate in Korea: 8.3%) [27] . Our results demonstrated that antibiotic use was significantly correlated with acute tonsillitis with a larger magnitude than influenza virus activity. This correlation likely results from the physician's anxiety over the potential risk of developing secondary bacterial infections. Antibiotics prescribed for respiratory viruses are positively associated with poor quality prescribing [24, 28] . Patient satisfaction has been shown to be a major driver as well.",

Second, since enterovirus (mean detection rate: 3.1%) has not been assessed in the KINRESS since 2011 and the mean detection rates of other respiratory viruses, such as human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), and human parainfluenza virus (hPIV) were relatively low (hMPV: 1.28%, hBoV: 1.6%, hPIV: 4.0%), these viruses were not considered in this study. Third, we used primary care clinic-based sentinel surveillance data for respiratory virus detection. These data could underestimate the strength of virus activity; however, the pattern of influenza virus activity was similar to the pattern of influenza-likeillness in the country. Fourth, the number of samples collected was not consistent year on year due to the variation of respiratory virus activity (yearly mean number of samples collected is 12,938).
