[14] [15] [16] [17] In the present study, we analyzed children 5 18 For this subgroup analysis, we restricted the study to children who were 5 years old or younger with confirmed viral infections.",

Metapneumovirus (hMPV), though less common than RSV (9.7% and 24.7%, respectively) was more prevalent in our study than others had previously reported (4-5.5%). 20 hMPV was significantly associated with hospitalization; however, its ORs were generally smaller than those of RSV.

Data from this analysis were collected from individuals originally enrolled in the ILI-002 study in the Mexico Emerging Infectious Disease Clinical Research Network (La Red) (Clinical Trials identifier NCT01418287), which recruited a prospective cohort of ILI patients year-round from April 2010 to March 2014. Participants were recruited from five hospitals in Mexico City and one hospital in San Luis Potosi. Patients were eligible for participation if they met the study definition of ILI: at least one respiratory symptom (shortness of breath, postnasal drip, or cough) and one of the following general symptoms: fever \u2265 38\u00b0C or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia, or chest pain.

Only children with single viral infections are included Additionally, our prospective study design and the expanded panel of the RespiFinder 22 kit allowed us to perform an analysis of ILI outcomes among children with different single virus infections, providing unique insight into the relative severity of these infections.A limitation of the study is that our sample is restricted to patients meeting an ILI case definition; thus, our results might not be generalized to all acute respiratory infections. Nevertheless, the ILI definition that we used allowed for the inclusion of a broad range of clinical presentations, and, therefore, it is likely that this data might be of help for assessment of patients that seek acute medical care. We acknowledge that the decision to seek medical attention in a hospital (rather than in a primary care clinic) could be related to the perceived severity of the illness, potentially biasing our study population. As our study was primarily hospital based, the absolute rates of hospitalized vs outpatients are likely skewed towards those that present to a hospital for care of the ILI. However, we believe that the place of choice for medical attention would not confound the risk for hospitalization among those with severe ILI, regardless of the infectious agent should not influence the relative proportions of hospitalization between viruses.F I G U R E 2 Pairwise comparisons for the likelihood of requiring hospitalization in children \u22645 y of age with ILI caused by different viruses. Each panel shows the comparison between a specific virus and each of the other viruses included in the study. The adjusted odds ratios (taking into account age, sex, days from onset of symptoms, presence of underlying illness, and study site) are shown for comparisons between each pair of viruses. Statistically significant differences are shown in solid lines; nonsignificant comparisons are shown in dotted lines As mentioned previously, there were a number of children with viral coinfections. Although we suspect that each combination of viruses could result in specific virus-virus interactions, we did not have a sample large enough to examine this matter further. Finally, findings for RV/EV might be limited by the fact that the RespiFinder PCR assay does not distinguish between rhinovirus and enterovirus, and differences between these picornaviruses could not be elucidated any further. In summary, the availability of prospectively recorded data in this large cohort of patients provided us with the opportunity to describe the viral etiology and ILI severity in Mexican children. Our results indicate that among children with ILI, those with RSV and hMPV infections were at greatest risk for hospitalization, while children with RV/EV, PIV, coronavirus, adenovirus, and influenza were at lower risk. The observed differences in the likelihood of hospitalization between children with diverse etiologies support the need for closer observation in those with infections caused by RSV or hMPV. Ana A.
