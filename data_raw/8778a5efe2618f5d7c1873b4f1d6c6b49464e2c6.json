            "text": "The evolutionarily conserved AAA+ ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP) was previously shown to be a proviral host factor for several viruses from different viral families such as Flaviviridae, Picornaviridae, and Herpesviridae. VCP was shown to affect trafficking of Sindbis virus receptor and functions as a component of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) replicase compartment. However, the role of this cellular protein was not evaluated during replication of alphaviruses including chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Using siRNA, chemical inhibitors, and trans-replication assays, we show here that VCP is a proviral factor involved in the replication of CHIKV. Immunofluorescence assays confirmed that VCP co-localized with non-structural replicase proteins but not with dsRNA foci possibly due to VCP epitope unavailability. VCP pro-viral role is also observed with other alphaviruses such as o'nyong'nyong virus (ONNV) and SFV in different human cell lines. VCP proviral roles on several viral families now extend to replication of alphaviruses CHIKV and ONNV, emphasizing the pivotal role of VCP in virus-host interaction biology.",

The different chemical inhibitors assessed included DBeQ, a reversible inhibitor of VCP (Fang et al., 2015) , NMS-873, a specific allosteric VCP inhibitor (Magnaghi et al., 2013) , and CB-5083, an orally bioavailable active compound derived from the scaffold of DBeQ (Anderson et al., 2015) . Notably, CB-5083 has been shown to be selective, specifically inhibiting the ATPase activity of the D2 domain of VCP by binding in the nucleotide binding site (Tang et al., 2019) . All VCP inhibitors showed a dose-dependent effect on Gluc production with an approximate effective concentration 50 (EC50) ranging from 0.4 to 10 \u00b5M (Figure 2) . Toxicity of the different inhibitors at different concentrations was verified using the Cell Titer Glo assay and showed cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50) very close from their respective EC50 for DBeQ and NMS-873 suggesting that their inhibitory effect on viral Gluc production could be linked to the cytotoxicity effect. However, no significant toxicity for CB-5083 was observed ( Figure 2E) , suggesting that the inhibitory effect on CB-5083 on viral Gluc production is not due to cytotoxicity. Interestingly, the time-of-addition of chemical inhibitors relative to viral infection had no significant impact on the anti-CHIKV EC50 (Figures 2C,D,F) , with CB-5083 having the lowest EC50 (0.4 < EC50 < 0.45 \u00b5M) ( Figure 2E ). Taken together, these results suggest an antiviral effect of VCP inhibitor CB-5083 at a post binding or entry step.",

Altogether, results showed that CB-5083 had no negative effect on production of CHIKV replicase proteins or template RNA. However, when the replicase and templates were co-expressed, VCP chemical inhibition drastically decreased the amount of tdTomato mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) detected per transfected cell ( Figure 4E ) despite the increased Fluc RNA template availability. These results confirm that VCP is a proviral factor essential during CHIKV replication at a post entry step.",

Unfortunately, in this assay, nsP4 as well as dsRNA co-localization with VCP could not be assessed due to lack of suitable and species compatible antibodies, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient for all the acquired images indicated that VCP co-localized more with nsP2 and nsP3 than nsP1 ( Figure 5D ).

Therefore, we assessed the performance of a polyclonal rabbit anti-VCP antibody in immunofluorescence assay which would allow co-localization with the mouse antibody recognizing dsRNA. Using this combinaition of antibodies, we did not observe co-localization between VCP and dsRNA foci ( Figure 6A) . Interestingly, this antibody against VCP presented a very different localization pattern than the mouse monoclonal antibody used previously in both infected and non-infected conditions (Figure 5 ). Since the rabbit antibody, directed against the N-terminal, gave a punctuated localization different from the pattern observed previously near the cytosolic membrane with the mouse monoclonal antibody against VCP C-terminal (Figure 5) , we assessed co-localization of the two anti-VCP antibodies ( Figure 6B ). Signals from both antibodies did not co-localize, and localization of VCP near the plasma membrane was not observable using the N-terminal directed antibody raised in rabbit. Since the N-terminal of VCP is a site of interaction with several co-factors (Hanzelmann and Schindelin, 2017) , we hypothesize that the observed absence of co-localization of dsRNA with VCP could be due to a lack of N-terminal accessibility.",

CHIKV can be categorized into three main genotypes, the West Africa, East-Central-South-African (ECSA), and Asian genotypes. We compared the Chikungunya strain isolated during the La Reunion epidemic [La Reunion isolate LR2006-OPY1 (LR)] and an Indian (IND) strain isolated in India during the same epidemic from a patient presenting neurological complications both belonging to the ECSA genotype. We also compared a Caribbean (CRB) isolate (CNR20235) belonging to the Asian genotype, isolated during outbreaks in the CRB islands in December 2013, which we have previously shown to be less pathogenic than the LR isolate in vitro and in vivo in mouse models (Teo et al., 2015) . VCP inhibition with CB-5083 showed a dose-dependent inhibition of viral Gluc production with all viruses tested ( Figure 7A) . A dosedependent decrease of ZsGreen signal was also observed in cells infected with ZsGreen-tagged CHIKV or ONNV ( Figure 7B ). In addition, we assessed if the effect of VCP inhibition on CHIKV replication was reproducible in more relevant human cells related to cell types infected in patients: a human foreskin fibroblast cell line (BJ cells) and a muscle cells line (RD cells) (Suhrbier et al., 2012) . VCP inhibition with CB-5083 resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of CHIKV in BJ and RD cells ( Figure 7C ).",

Timeof-addition assays using specific chemical inhibitors of VCP suggested that the virus life cycle step involving VCP as a proviral factor would be viral RNA replication rather than binding or entry. Although the effect of VCP inhibition demonstred to be conserved across different alphaviruses (Figure 7) , variations in the level of virus inhibition were observed between the different cell types and virus isolates. These variations are likely due to the calculation for each virus and cell type, where the relative luciferase is normalized against the signals from the untreated infected internal controls, where background signal comes from initial Gluc contained in the inoculum.",

However, we did not observe a role for VCP as a binding factor of CHIKV (Figures 3A,B) , consistent with the fact that CHIKV and other alphaviruses binding and entry is NRAMP2 independent (Rose et al., 2011) . This observation was further verified using an entry assay (Figure 3C) , which showed an effect of VCP inhibition on intracellular viral levels consistent with a role of VCP during viral RNA replication. Therefore, excluding a role during viral binding or entry in our experimental setup. However, we cannot exclude FIGURE 5 | VCP localizes with CHIKV replicase components. HEK 293T cells were infected at an moi of 10, 2 hpi cells were then plated in Ibidi \u00b5-wells microscopy chambers; 5 hours post-plating, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and co-stained in duplicate for VCP with nsP1, nsP2, or nsP3 as indicated on the figure. Cells were counterstained with DAPI before confocal acquisition of z-stacks. that VCP inhibition prior to infection could also result in lower trafficking of viral receptor or other entry factors.",

In addition, viral replicase components nsP1, 2, and 3 were demonstrated to co-localize partially with VCP differentially (Figure 5) . This difference could be due to the fact that a significant portion of nsP1 is anchored in the plasma membrane while VCP, nsP2, and nsP3 are cytoplasmic. These results are consistent with earlier studies with SFV and HCV showing association of VCP with their replication complexes (Varjak et al., 2013; Yi et al., 2016) , and the role of VCP during virus RNA replication of poliovirus, enterovirus 71, human cytomegalovirus, West Nile virus, and HCV (Arita et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2016; Yi et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017; Phongphaew et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Yi and Yuan, 2017) . Interestingly, VCP was also involved in the egress of viral particles for poliovirus and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (Arita et al., 2012; Brahms et al., 2017) . The results on RVFV are of particular interest, where the study identified VCP as the target of FDA-approved drug Sorafenib effect on RVFV (Benedict et al., 2015; Brahms et al., 2017) . The same group has also identified Sorafenib as a potential drug that reduces replication of several alphaviruses including CHIKV (Lundberg et al., 2018) . It would be interesting to verify if Sorafenib inhibits alphaviruses in a VCP-dependant manner similar to RVFV.",

This effect extends to several other alphaviruses and understanding the exact role played by VCP during virus replication could shed light on a highly conserved viral subversion mechanism of cellular machineries via the multi-purpose protein VCP. This accumulating evidence suggest that understanding of such mechanism could open the way for designing new treatment strategies effective against a wide range of viruses by targeting a conserved VCP proviral role.",

CHIKV and ONNV were produced using in vitro transcribed viral RNA from NotI (NEB) linearized plasmids using SP6 mMessage mMachine (Ambion). Viral RNA was then transfected in Vero E6 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's recommendation. SFV6 was produced by transfection of plasmid containing infectious cDNA in HEK293T cells. Viruses were passaged once or twice in Vero E6 cells to obtain a sufficient titer.
