The gel pieces were washed with ddH 2 O and destained in 30 mM potassium ferricyanide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 mM sodium thiosulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min until they became colorless. Disulfide bonds were reduced by treatment with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Amersham Biosciences) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (JT Baker) for 1 h at 56\u00b0C. Iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich) was then used to alkylate the cysteine residues. The samples were diluted with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated with acetonitrile (ACN, Echo Chemical), and subjected to 0.001% trypsin (Biological Industries) digestion overnight at 37\u00b0C. The next day, the peptide samples were acidified with 5% formic acid (Acros Organics), and analyzed by LC/MS/MS using a Thermo Scientific LTQ XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).",
