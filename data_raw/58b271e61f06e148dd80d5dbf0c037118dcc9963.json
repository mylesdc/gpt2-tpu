This raises the question of how evolution has chosen the nucleotide sequence of HIV-1 that is observed today, or to what extent the actual encoding contributes to virus replication capacity, evolvability and pathogenesis. Here, we applied the previously described synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) approach to HIV-1. Results: Using synonymous codon pairs, we rationally recoded and codon pair-optimized and deoptimized different moieties of the HIV-1 gag and pol genes. Deoptimized viruses had significantly lower viral replication capacity in MT-4 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Varying degrees of ex vivo attenuation were obtained, depending upon both the specific deoptimized region and the number of deoptimized codons. A protease optimized virus carrying 38 synonymous mutations was not attenuated and displayed a replication capacity similar to that of the wild-type virus in MT-4 cells and PBMCs. Although attenuation is based on several tens of nucleotide changes, deoptimized HIV-1 reverted to wild-type virulence after serial passages in MT-4 cells. Remarkably, no reversion was observed in the optimized virus.",

The extraordinarily large number of possible encodings in natural genes is to some extent restricted by two encoding biases referred to as codon bias [1, 2] and codon pair bias [3] . The remarkable nucleotide composition of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome with an above average percentage of A nucleotides results in a codon composition that is different from that of the human genome [4] . Especially the more flexible third codon positions are preferentially occupied by A-nucleotides [5] , which induces ribosome pausing and inefficient translation [6] . The bias of A-rich codons in HIV-1 is thought to be the action of host enzymes of the APOBEC3 family. On the contrary, it has been shown that the HIV-1 A-rich sequence is not merely an evolutionary artefact of enzyme-induced hypermutations, and that HIV-1 has adapted to rely on A-rich RNA sequences to support the synthesis of viral cDNA during reverse transcription [7] . Recent data have identified a novel antiviral mechanism within the innate immune response, in which human SLFN11 selectively inhibits viral protein synthesis in HIV-infected cells by means of codon-bias discrimination [8] . Synonymous substitutions optimizing for human cell expression reduces the antiviral activity of SLFN11 [8] . Synonymous mutation is thought to be selectively neutral. However, previous work demonstrated that synonymous substitutions can negatively affect the replication capacity of several RNA viruses [9] , including HIV-1 [10] .",

SAVE works by recoding and synthesizing the viral genome; the wild-type amino acid sequence is preserved, but the existing synonymous codons are rearranged to create a suboptimal arrangement of codon pairs [3] . Although the reasons are still not well understood, some codon pairs occur more frequently, and others less frequently, than expected [12] . The overall codon usage in a genome can differ dramatically among species, although less so among closely related species [13] . It is unclear why some codon pairs are under-or overrepresented. It has been suggested that structural features that regulate tRNA geometry within the ribosome may govern genomic codon pair patterns, driving enhanced translational fidelity and/or rate [14] . For example, as described by Coleman et al., the amino acid pair Ala-Glu is expected to be encoded by GCCGAA and GCAGAG approximately equally as often. However, the codon pair GCCGAA is strongly underrepresented and is used only one-seventh as often as GCAGAG [3] .",

The mechanism of attenuation is unclear, but it has been suggested that translation is affected [3, 11] .

Moreover, HIV-1 can initiate translation either by the classical cap-dependent mechanism or by internal recruitment of the ribosome through RNA domains called IRESs (internal ribosome entry sites) [16] . To explore whether recoding synonymous codon pairs will generate viruses with altered replication capacity, we redesigned different parts of the HIV-1 genome. To phenotypically modify the replicative properties of HIV-1, we recoded the gag and protease (contained within the pol gene) coding regions by introducing optimized or deoptimized codon pairs without altering the amino acid sequence. Gag and protease coding regions were chosen in order to explore proteins with different function, structural and enzymatic, respectively.

These results demonstrate that deoptimized HIV-1 variants were able to recover fitness in tissue culture. Clonal sequencing of the different deoptimized viral populations at passage 15 showed that several deoptimizing synonymous substitutions reverted to wild-type (Table 4) . No significant reversions were observed in the optimized HIV-Pmax. The average mutation frequency in the deoptimized viral populations at passage 15 was between 1.5-fold and 12.0-fold higher than that of the wild-type population. There was a good correlation Figure 3 Single-cycle infectivity assay of HIV-1 protease codon pair-recoded synthetic constructs. HIV-1 protease codon pairrecoded synthetic constructs (Figures 1 and 2) were introduced into the GFP reporter HIV-1 infectious clone pNL4-3-deltaE-EGFP. The replication capacities of the different protease constructs are represented as a percentage relative to the wild-type HIV-1 HXB2 strain (100%). The relative replication capacity of the virus was determined by measuring the amount of p24 antigen. A reduction in the production of p24 protein in the culture transfected with a HIV-1 clone carrying a deoptimized protease was observed. The reduction in p24 expression was not accompanied by a reduction in the production of gag RNA (Table 3) . (Table 4 ). In addition to the reversion of deoptimized synonymous substitutions, many additional synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations were observed (Table 4 ) (Additional file 4: Table S3 and Additional file 5: Table S4 ). Most of these additional mutations alleviate negative codon pair-bias scores (data not shown), strongly suggesting that phenotypic reversion was due to the reversion of some initially mutated residues together with the fixation of new mutations. Especially interesting was the high number of nonsynonymous substitutions found in some deoptimized gag populations. For instance, the HIV-GminA construct incorporated as majority variants the nonsynonymous mutations R4G, P48T and K114R in both passage replicates, indicating Los Alamos database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/). Most of the nonsynonymous substitutions occurred in codons carrying deoptimized synonymous mutations, showing that the introduction of synonymous substitutions may allow the virus to explore an alternative nonsynonymous sequence space to improve viral fitness.",

            "text": "We found that by codon pair-deoptimizing different moieties of the HIV-1 gag and pol genes it was possible to produce viruses with significantly lower viral replication capacity in MT-4 cells and PBMCs. These findings confirm the validity of using the SAVE strategy to attenuate lentiviruses ex vivo, in particular HIV-1. Our results provide also evidence that attenuated viruses may display decreased rates of protein translation of the targeted genes. After restricting viral replication to a single cycle by using a single-cycle HIV-1 vector, a significant reduction in protein production was observed in the vector carrying an attenuated virus variant. This reduction in protein synthesis was not accompanied by a reduction in the targeted RNA copy number, which suggests that translation, and not transcription, is implicated in the generation of the attenuated phenotype. Moreover, the lower RNA/p24 ratio found in these experiments for the deoptimized virus also suggests that there may be a defect in virus assembly. It has been hypothesized that the presence of a rare codon, marked by a synonymous polymorphism, affects the timing of protein folding and function [18] . This study therefore demonstrates that synonymous codon pair reengineering is an effective tool to phenotypically affect the replicative properties of HIV-1. Codon-optimized HIV-1 genes significantly increased protein expression [6] . However, it was unknown whether HIV-1 codon reoptimization increases viral fitness or virulence. A high level of preferred human codon use runs the risk of disrupting some unknown property of the HIV-1 RNA that is deleterious for other reasons, e.g. disrupting the secondary structure of the HIV-1 RNA genome [19] or increasing the number of CpG islands [20] . Importantly, in our study, a protease optimized virus carrying 38 synonymous mutations was not attenuated and displayed a replication capacity similar to that of the wild-type virus in MT-4 cells and PBMCs. This result suggests that certain neutral genetic drift is operating in protease synonymous nucleotide residues. Thus, in addition to explore virus attenuation, synonymous codon pair recoding can be used to explore other aspects of the HIV-1 biology. Indeed, synonymous codon pair reoptimization has been used to overcome adeno-associated virus (AAV) Rep gene's inhibitory effects on adenovirus replication [21] , to identify unknown functional RNA elements in poliovirus coding sequences [22] and to study poliovirus evolvability and pathogenesis [23] .",

In contrast, we show here that highly attenuated HIV-1 variants carrying more or near one hundred synonymous substitutions reverted their phenotype after 15 passages in MT4-4 cells. Most notably, sequence clonal analysis of phenotypically reverted viral populations shows that phenotype reversion is due not only to the reversion of initially introduced synonymous mutations but also to the presence of new synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations. Of note, no genetic or phenotypic reversion is observed in a codon pair base optimized viral population after the same number of passages in MT-4 cells. Differences in the life cycle between poliovirus and HIV-1 may account for the above discrepancies. Alternatively, differences in virus protein or genome mutational robustness and evolvability can not be discarded. The different codon usage between poliovirus and HIV-1 may determine differences in their mutational robustness and evolutionary capacity [23, 24] . A higher number of substitutions may better prevent reversion to the wild-type genotype. Instead, other HIV-1 genomic regions can be explored to determine whether other structural or accessory genes can be targeted with SAVE to generate recoded virus with a higher genetic barrier for phenotype reversion.",

First, despite the fact that reduction in protein synthesis was not accompanied by a reduction in the targeted HIV-1 RNA copy number, RNA sequences may be also targeted by factors other than those of the translation machinery (e.g. aberrant splicing, RNA decay process or miRNA targeting). Second, although we obtained a robust attenuation in PBMCs from healthy donors, our variants should be tested in an animal model, ideally the SIV macaque model, in order to demonstrate in vivo attenuation. Animal experiments should include optimized viruses to test whether these optimized variants are also not attenuated in vivo. Proof that lower replication capacities ex vivo can be translated into in vivo attenuation come from studies of the evolution of resistance to antiretroviral drugs, which is characterized by significant costs in ex vivo replication capacity [25] . Future work should include the immunization of animal models with different codon pair-deoptimized attenuated HIV-1 strains to investigate whether recoded viruses are also attenuated in vivo and to determine their long-term stability.",

We performed 15 serial virus passages in MT-4 cells, which corresponded to nearly 60 days of cell culture.
