            "text": "The incidence of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection steadily decreased in the United States (U.S.) and other developed countries following the introduction of the HAV vaccine. Although vaccine became available in the U.S. in 1995, vaccination was not routinely recommended for children in California until 1999, and across the U.S. in 2006. The incidence of HAV decreased from six cases per 100,000 in 1999 to 0.4 cases per 100,000 in 2011. 1 3 San Diego's public health officer declared a local health emergency on September 1, 2017, due to the ongoing outbreak of HAV. As of October 17, 2017 , the county has identified a total of 507 cases with 19 deaths and 351 (69%) hospitalizations related to the outbreak. 4 Between June and October 2016, Hawaii reported 292 confirmed cases of HAV with 74 patients requiring hospitalization. 5 This outbreak was linked to raw scallops served at a local sushi chain and a subsequent product recall was instated with no new cases reported as of July 11, 2017. 6 A 2016 multistate outbreak of HAV linked to contaminated frozen strawberries resulted in 143 recognized cases and 56 hospitalizations. 7 These HAV outbreaks pose a unique challenge for public health officials for several reasons: the prolonged incubation period (15-50 days) ; infected individuals can transmit the disease up to two weeks prior to symptom onset; many infected persons remain asymptomatic; and many patients affected in these outbreaks are homeless and/or illicit drug users (both injection and non-injection), causing difficulty in contacting and following up infected persons. 3, 4 Emergency Department (ED) providers in affected areas may encounter and treat a large number of these patients. Additionally, if the disease arises in other regions, it is likely that ED providers would be the first point of contact for many symptomatic patients. Given the contagious nature of HAV, as well as potential morbidity and mortality associated with the disease, it is of great importance that cases of the infection be accurately recognized, isolated and treated, with prompt notification of public health authorities. ED providers have a unique opportunity to advocate for vaccination of vulnerable populations, and EDs have enacted vaccination programs during acute outbreaks. 8 After a thorough review of HAV infection, this paper describes a novel 3I tool, initially developed for Ebola virus and subsequently adapted for measles, MERS and mumps, [9] [10] [11] [12] for use by ED providers in the initial detection and management of HAV patients.",

After a few days to weeks, patients may develop dark urine and pale, clay-colored stools as well as jaundice and pruritus. In some infected persons, there is no prodromal phase or it is so mild that the infected person does not present for medical care until jaundice develops. Approximately 70% of infected adults will exhibit initial symptoms; jaundice occurs in 40-70% of cases. 13 During the prodromal phase, infected persons are highly contagious as there is viremia, and large quantities of infectious virus are shed in the stool. On physical examination, patients commonly present with fever, jaundice, scleral icterus and hepatomegaly. 14, 15 Less commonly, patients may demonstrate extrahepatic signs and symptoms of the disease, including splenomegaly, rash and arthralgias. In very rare cases, hematologic abnormalities (e.g. aplastic anemia, red cell aplasia and thrombocytopenia), neurologic abnormalities (e.g. optic neuritis and transverse myelitis), rheumatologic findings (e.g. leukocytoclastic vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinemia) as well as toxic epidermal necrolysis and myocarditis can occur.

Healthcare providers should suspect HAV infection in patients with the above-mentioned common symptoms (see \"Clinical Presentation\"), particularly in conjunction with elevated liver function tests. At initial presentation, persons with suspected viral hepatitis should have serologic testing for hepatitis A, B, and C, to include HAV immunoglobulin M (IgM), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core IgM, and hepatitis C antibody. Serologic testing for HIV should be performed if HIV-status is not known. The prothrombin time/international normalized ratio should also be checked. Anti-HAV IgM is an indicator of acute infection and can be detected in blood for up to six months after infection. Anti-HAV IgG is indicative of either past infection or vaccination. 29",

Clinical symptoms include jaundice, pruritus, fever, weight loss and diarrhea for a period of greater than three months. Laboratory tests will show elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and transaminitis. Cholestatic hepatitis will typically resolve without further intervention and treatment is limited to supportive management. 37, 38 Relapsing hepatitis can complicate some cases of HAV infection. A relapse of symptoms may occur a couple of weeks to several months after the original illness. Symptoms during relapse are typically milder in severity when compared to the initial acute illness.
