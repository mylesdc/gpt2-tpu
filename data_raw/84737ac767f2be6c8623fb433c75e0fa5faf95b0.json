Therefore, enhancing the ability to prepare for public health emergencies at the grassroots level and extend public health emergency response mechanisms to communities, and even to individual families, is a research question that is of practical significance. This study aimed to investigate mechanisms to determine how media exposure affects individual public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) to environmental disasters; specifically, we examined the mediating role of knowledge and trust in government. The results were as follows: (1) knowledge had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between media exposure and PHEP; (2) trust in government had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between media exposure and PHEP; (3) knowledge and trust in government had significant multiple mediating effects on the relationship between media exposure and PHEP.",

Strengthening emergency preparedness is the primary task of emergency management at the national and local levels [2, 3] . However, recent environmental disasters have revealed the limitation of government in real-time response and mobilization to help the public, especially when a disaster strikes a large area at the same time [4] . Public health emergency preparedness is a \"bottom-up\" system [1] , and individuals, families, and communities, industries are essential to increasing the resilience of emergency management [5] [6] [7] . They are the first respondents coping with disasters before the arriving of support from government. As responding at the first time and the first scene plays important roles on the mitigation of disaster losses, how to strengthen PHEP at the grassroots level, and how to extend public health emergency response mechanisms to communities and even families, is a research question of highly practical significance. In this study, we aim to describe the relationship between media exposure and individual PHEP behaviors.",

Murphy et al. found that watching national news, reading a newspaper, and listening to the radio can positively affect preparedness [11] . Paek et al., found that people who were more exposed to the news were more prepared for various emergencies reported by television, radio, newspapers, and the Internet [9] .

Traditional media (e.g., newspaper, magazine, radio, TV) were effectively used by the government to disclose public information, such as government performance and public service information. In 2006, the national government website system was established, from when government information disclosure can be carried out through new media (e.g., Internet, mobile phone customization). In late 2013, the central government of China put Micro. blog and WeChat as equally important new media channels of government information disclosure as government websites.",

This was true even in 2013 during the Avian influenza A (H7N9) outbreak, when information disclosure on traditional media peaked. In 2014, the government began to use WeChat and Micro. blog to release information. We found that from 2014 to 2016, official public health information disclosure on WeChat and Micro. blog was gradually increasing, while information disclosure on traditional media was steadily decreasing and remaining flat on government websites. Thus, we can predict that WeChat and Micro. blog were gradually supplanting traditional media. Based on this observation, we believe that both traditional and new media played a role in public health information disclosure in Hangzhou, and their purposes are continuously changing, which is representative of all of China. As such, we chose samples from Hangzhou. As shown in Figure 1 , we found that official public health information disclosure on government websites is relatively flat every year.

We also included gender, age, education, and household income as covariates in the model. To more specifically understand the mediating effect of knowledge and trust in government on the relationship between media exposure and public health emergency preparedness behaviors, we built four scenarios with two types of media exposure and two types of PHEP. In addition, the effects of the two types of PHEP were analyzed using the intentionally biased bootstrapping (IBB) model ( Figure 5 ). For the media exposure-cooperation (ME-COOP) behavior scenarios (Scenarios 1 and 3) , the most sensitive variable to change with COOP was government trust (GT), followed by knowledge (KN) and ME. On the other hand, ME and emergency supply behaviors (SUP) in Scenarios 2 and 4 showed relatively little change compared to those in ME-COOP. The most sensitive factor to changes in SUP was KN. The impact of GT was found to be relatively minor. New media exposure (NME) appeared to be larger than changes in traditional media exposure (TME).

Specifically, frequent exposure to both traditional media and new media can directly promote their ownership of public health supplies behavior. Although the direct effects of the relationship between media exposure and their cooperation behaviors was not significant, knowledge and trust in government mediated the relationship between media exposure and cooperation behaviors. Although different opinions exist related to the effect of media exposure on trust in government, the media malaise thesis indicates that mass media has an adverse effect on trust [40] , while the mobilization thesis contends that mass media has a positive effect on trust [41] , and the neutral thesis suggests that the relationship between media exposure and political trust is highly dependent on existing conditions [42] . Regardless of which research articles prevail, in the Chinese context, media is always a significant way to strengthen political trust; this positive effect has been empirically verified in our study and other academic research [43] . However, in the cross-scenario analysis, we found that trust in government can play roles in the relationship between media exposure and cooperation behaviors, while it did not play roles in the relationship between media exposure and supplies behaviors. Moreover, new media exposure does not have direct effects on trust in government in the NME-COOP scenario, which means that simple media exposure may not increase individuals' trust in government, but needs to through the growth in knowledge. Therefore, through the effective combination of new and traditional media platforms, various forms of public safety contents for distributing knowledge of public health emergencies, public health emergency management, and government activities and events should be communicated to the public in a seamless, comprehensive, and real-time manner in order to improve their trust in government.",

The executors and planners of emergency and preparedness need to be part of the community. They need to regularly meet, listen to, and become familiar with community representatives and residents. The content of these meetings may be public health information of interest to residents as well as emergency preparedness topics. Knowledge is a significant predictor for both types of PHEP, so disaster-related education programs should be developed and promoted throughout the community. The content and form of programs should be well-designed and based on the particular learning needs of different target groups, such as the 'trickle-down' process of dissemination for children. Community groups can be established for women, and special education can be provided for elderly and disabled people [44] . Because trust in government can promote cooperation behaviors, programs for education need to include an introduction to disaster-related government rules, procedures, actions, and events.",

Due to the advent of new media, the government cannot completely control media, and the new media users maintain a cautious and conservative attitude towards cooperation behaviors. New media exposure cannot directly lead to cooperation but must do so through an understanding and trust in government. Therefore, in order to promote PHEP through new media, simple verbal communication is ineffective, and more useful knowledge and skills should be disseminated. This requires not only the creation and cooperation of new media content providers, but the government also needs to participate in dissemination through new media. In fact, new media is an important way for the government to communicate with the public and build trust in government. Through new media, the government can give more feedback to the public's inquiries and needs, as well as provide more channels for public participation and help the public to better understand and support the government's emergency management activities.",

            "text": "This study analyzed the influence of media exposure on public health emergency preparedness behaviors to environmental disasters. Previous studies have conducted extensive empirical research on this topic; however, there has been relatively little study of the mechanisms with which media exposure impacts PHEP, as well as little consideration of the mediating effects of knowledge and trust in government. In this study, we constructed a model with influence mechanisms and performed an empirical analysis. The study's hypothesis of serial multiple mediating effects was supported. First, this study confirmed that media exposure could significantly and positively affect knowledge, trust in government, and PHEP. Knowledge had a significant and positive effect on trust in government and PHEP. Trust in government had a significant and positive effect on PHEP. Second, we found that knowledge and trust in government can individually mediate the relationship between media exposure and PHEP. Third, the empirical study also verified that knowledge and trust in government have serial multiple mediating effects on the relationship between media exposure and PHEP. Last, we found that the mediating effects are different among the four scenarios that combined two types of media exposure and two types of PHEP. The effect of media exposure on public health emergency preparedness was considered an important research question. In this study, we divided media exposure into traditional media exposure and new media exposure, and divided public health emergency preparedness into cooperation behavior and supplies. Through the role of knowledge and trust in government as mediators, we constructed a serial multiple mediation model with four scenarios. We suggest that future research could build on the new analysis framework of this study, expand the scope of the samples, and carry out some cross-cultural studies, thus revealing more meaningful conclusions.
