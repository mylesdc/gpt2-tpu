Substantial research has been conducted to assess viability of the virus on surfaces of vehicles and equipment, in feed and water, and on production building surfaces, but little is known about the persistence in PEDV-infected carcasses and effective disposal methods thereof. This study was conducted to quantify the persistence of PEDV RNA via quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at various time-temperature combinations and in infected piglet carcasses subjected to composting. Although this method does not distinguish between infectious and noninfectious virus, it is a rapid and sensitive test to evaluate materials for evidence of virus genome. Results: In the first study, PEDV was suspended in cell culture media at 1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID50 per sample (1 mL sample size) and subjected to various time and temperature combinations in triplicate including temperatures of 37, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70\u00b0C and exposure times of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 14 days. At all temperatures, viral RNA copies declined over time, with the decline most marked and rapid at 65 and 70\u00b0C. Detectable RNA did persist throughout the trial in all but the most extreme condition, where two of three samples incubated at 70\u00b0C yielded undetectable viral RNA after 14 days. In the second study, PEDV-infected piglet carcasses were subjected to two cycles of composting lasting 36 and 37 days, respectively, for a total compost time of 73 days. Composting was performed in triplicate windrow sections housed inside biosecure, climate-controlled rooms using insulated bins designed to represent a continuous windrow compost pile. Temperatures reached 35-57\u00b0C for 26 days of cycle 1 and 35-45\u00b0C for 3 days of cycle 2. Samples consisting of carbon material with or without decomposed tissue as available per sample site collected at ten locations throughout the cross-section of each windrow section following the primary and secondary compost cycles yielded no detectable viral RNA.",

The virus can infect all ages of swine and is characterized by clinical disease of watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, with high morbidity and mortalityoften near 100%in na\u00efve suckling piglets [2] . In May 2013, PEDV was detected in outbreaks of porcine diarrhea in Iowa, United States, and quickly spread to over half of the states in the U.S. and subsequently to Canada [3, 4] . Prior to this outbreak, cases of PEDV infection had been limited to Europe and Asia [5] . Extensive investigation into how PEDV arrived in the U.S. and quickly disseminated throughout the swine industry has implicated PEDVcontaminated feed or feed ingredients as the potential origin of virus introduction [6] [7] [8] [9] . A comprehensive root cause investigation report organized by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) identified flexible intermediate bulk containers, commonly used to transport feed ingredients, as the most likely source of PEDV introduction to the country [10] . These findings demonstrate the critical need to understand PEDV persistence in multiple complex matrices, including those in the environment, so that transmission of the disease can be prevented.",

            "text": "With nearly 100% mortality in pre-weaned piglets, the large number of carcasses and volume of infectious material generated during PEDV outbreaks was substantial. Proven, biosecure methods for carcass disposal are sought to control on-farm virus proliferation and limit site-to-site transmission. Major mortality disposal methods available to swine producers in the U.S. include rendering, incineration, burial, land-filling, and composting [11] . Although composting is widely accepted in the U.S. and Canada, it is not legally permitted for swine producers in the European Union, which are primarily limited to the methods of rendering and incineration [12] . Composting requires relatively low input costs, poses little environmental risk when properly designed and managed, and offers greater biosecurity than methods involving transport of infected carcasses beyond the farm boundary. Furthermore, in situations of disease-associated mortalities, composting is capable of inactivating the pathogen of concern when the system is managed to achieve and maintain pile temperature targets. Several studies have demonstrated this concept with carcasses and manure from virus-infected animals. Windrow-composted poultry manure from Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-infected birds was found to be free of detectable virus by virus isolation [13] . Avian influenza (AI) and NDV were inactivated following 7 days of composting at temperatures reaching 50-65\u00b0C [14] . Compost piles containing AI-infected chicken carcasses were determined AI-negative by virus isolation after 10 days [15] . Pseudorabies virus-infected pig carcasses composted at temperatures that reached 27 to 51\u00b0C contained undetectable virus by isolation techniques in samples collected at days 7 and 14, and compost samples collected after 35 days of composting were negative via bioassay conducted on na\u00efve exposed sentinel pigs [16] . For pig carcasses infected with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus, a more environmentally stable non-enveloped virus than those previously discussed, compost pile temperatures reaching 50\u00b0C at 10 days of composting was successful at virus inactivation [17] . Given these demonstrated successes, the USDA published guidance to promote composting as a disposal method for birds infected by highly pathogenic AI in response to outbreaks of this disease in 2016 [18] . Overall, composting has been proven effective for managing important viral pathogens in animal production waste products by multiple testing modalities and may also be a biosecure on-farm disposal method for use by swine producers to control PEDV transmission.",

Viral RNA reduction kinetics varied greatly among temperature treatments; however, the rate of reduction peaked after the initial days of temperature treatments above 37\u00b0C and then slowed (Table 1 ). This is reflected by the increase in mean quantification cycle (Cq) of the qRT-PCR over time, which corresponds with a reduction in RNA targets in the sample (Fig. 1 ). At 37\u00b0C, viral RNA steadily degraded at an average rate of 0.29 log per day throughout the temperature treatment. The amount of viral RNA detected from day 1 to 7 at 37\u00b0C was significantly different from all other temperature treatments on those days. At 45\u00b0C, viral RNA reduction was more rapid from days 0 to 4 (average 1 log reduction per day) with no mean log change thereafter. The 50\u00b0C treatment yielded a mean rate of RNA reduction from days 0 to 2 of 1.87 log of RNA per day, but the remainder of time treatment (2 to 14 days) did not reveal further significant decrease of viral RNA. At 55\u00b0C, RNA decreased by 2.91 log during the first day of treatment, 0.68 log during the second day, and remained generally stable from days 2 through 14 with no further significant decrease in RNA. For 60, 65, and 70\u00b0C treatments, viral RNA reduction was greatestbetween 3.72 and 3.9 login the first day with no difference (p < .05) among the temperatures. From 1 to 14 days, viral RNA decreased a total of 0.28, 1.42, and 2.44 log at 60, 65, and 70\u00b0C, respectively. Despite the similar rapid decrease at day 1, the quantity of viral RNA remaining at day 14 was significantly different among all of these high treatment temperatures.",

For FMD virus associated with infected pig carcasses, composting at temperatures reaching 50-70\u00b0C for several days was able to degrade viral RNA below RRT-PCR detection by day 21 [17] . FMD, a non-enveloped virus, is likely more environmentally persistent and resistant to organic solvents than enveloped viruses such as AI, NDV, and PEDV [22] . Therefore, the absence of detectable PEDV RNA in samples from the end of the first compost cycle at day 36 in this study is consistent with previous reports and is a reasonable result considering the variable physical properties of viruses. One problem with making a direct comparison between studies is differences in compost pile temperatures, especially when time and temperature treatment is presumed to be a vital component of pathogen destruction. The compost windrow sections in this study did not consistently achieve published compost temperature benchmarks or comparable maximum temperatures, as a mean temperature of 55\u00b0C for 4 h was only achieved at the core of the windrow sections during cycle 1. While the temperature profile of compost piles does affect the rate of decomposition and pathogen inactivation, virus degradation in compost material has also been shown to partly rely on factors other than temperature, such as microbial activity. AI and NDV in sealed vials subjected to composting were detected by RRT-PCR at the end of testing on day 21, whereas the viruses spiked into chicken manure, used litter, feed, and a homogenate of virus-infected embryonated chicken eggs contained in mesh bags and composted were not detectable by day 10 [14] . In the same experiment, virus-inoculated embryonated chicken eggs that remained intact during composting contained detectable viral RNA, but RNA had degraded beyond detection in those that were crushed. Similarly, with virus survival, another study where NDV and avian encephalomyelitis virus (AEV) were composted in sealed vials or permeable cassettes demonstrated markedly reduced virus survival within the cassettes [23] . NDV in cassettes survived no more than 7 days, while the virus in vials survived up to 28 days. Likewise, AEV in cassettes was inactivated in about 7 days, while the vials contained infectious virus for at least 49 days. Therefore, the exposure of viruses to the complex microbial environment and decomposition by-products of compost is associated with accelerated pathogen destruction beyond the effects of temperature. Because the compost windrow sections of the current study were relatively small and constructed of wood shavings and piglet carcasses without the addition of other carbon and nitrogen sources, microbial activity or temperatures comparable to what would be expected for on-farm mortality compost piles were not able to be sustained. Even under less than ideal composting conditions, PEDV appears to be sufficiently susceptible to composting conditions and comparable to other tested viruses.",

Infectivity was reduced to 0.05% of the original value when heated to 50\u00b0C for 3 h, indicating rapid inactivation at high temperatures [20] .

Consistently, low temperatures promote virus survival and long-term PCR detection of PEDV RNA, while high temperatures rapidly degrade PEDV. This may explain in part, the seasonal increase in PEDV cases that has been observed during the winter months in the United States following introduction [25] . Additionally, the persistence of PEDV RNA has been reported in open earthen manure storages for up to 9 months where environmental temperatures tend to be lower (\u221230 to 23\u00b0C) [26] . In controlled laboratory studies, PEDV-spiked manure slurry stored at 25, 4, and \u221220\u00b0C and PEDV-spiked feed slurry or dry feed maintained at room temperature (about 25\u00b0C) contained RNA for at least 28 days [27] . PEDV-spiked spray-dried bovine plasma contained detectable RNA for at least 21 days at a temperature of 4\u00b0C, although the virus survived less 7 days 22\u00b0C [28] . PEDV-spiked fresh feces exposed to 50 and 60\u00b0C temperatures over a range of relative humidity contained detectable virus RNA up to 7 and 3 days, respectively [27] . The time-temperature trial conducted in this study demonstrated that PEDV RNA persisted in sterile virus media for at least 14 days at temperatures of 37 to 65\u00b0C and was degraded to an undetectable concentration at 70\u00b0C in two of three samples. Compared to those results for PEDV-spiked fresh feces exposed to 50 and 60\u00b0C, this indicates that the complex matrix of manure at high temperatures more effectively degrades RNA. From 37 to 60\u00b0C, the average Cq of media at 14 days was about 30; not a significant difference despite clearly different treatment. RNA was often relatively stable in these treatments after an initial decrease in the first time points. While temperature may provide for virus inactivation and significant RNA decrease in a sterile environment, microbial or enzymatic factors are thought to promote elimination from manure and compost. This provides data to support field observations that while many environmental samples may be positive for PED RNA by qRT-PCR, this detection does not necessarily translate to the presence of infectious virus as RNA is likely detectable for an extended period of time even at elevated temperatures [26] .",

The combination of time and high temperature representative of the compost cycle has been shown to effectively degrade viral RNA in cell culture media, a matrix that promotes stability. Windrow sections achieved a benchmark mean temperature of 55\u00b0C for 4 h at the core during compost cycle 1, which was successful at degrading PEDV RNA. Standard benchmark temperatures for composting also include 40\u00b0C for 120 h and 55\u00b0C for 4 h at all points within the windrow sections during compost cycle 2, which are above the maximum temperatures achieved in this study experimentally. Because these experimental compost windrow sections were constructed of fresh wood shavings and piglet carcasses without the addition of other carbon and nitrogen sources that can improve pile conditions to promote microbial activity, and because these windrow sections were considerably smaller than field-scale compost windrows or piles, temperatures in on-farm animal carcass compost piles commonly achieve and sustain target temperatures much more readily. The complex compost material matrices from experimental compost windrow sections did not contain detectable PEDV RNA by qRT-PCR after one 36-d compost cycle, which supports the premise that greater temperatures sustained for longer periods during on-farm composting will provide effective biosecure disposal of PEDV-infected carcasses. Given our findings of both time and temperature incubations and experimental scale composting, these support the use of on farm composting for virus mitigation on farms.",

When temperatures failed to increase, or declined, water was added to windrow sections from a municipal source to achieve a damp sponge feel of the carbon material. In response to a slow temperature rise in all windrow sections, 5.5 kg of Roebic compost accelerator (Roebic Laboratories Inc., New Haven, CT, U.S.) was added to each windrow section on day 2 of the first compost cycle. On day 5, 0.4 kg of granular fertilizer (Lesco 18-0-18 fertilizer, Home Depot, Lincoln, NE, U.S.) was added to all windrows to further accelerate microbial activity. To add both the compost accelerator and granular fertilizer, carcasses were carefully uncovered and the products were evenly distributed across the exposed surface. Carbon material was then returned to the original configuration following fertilizer addition. Once manual temperature measurements reflected a sustained temperature of less than 100\u00b0C in all windrows, windrows were disassembled, temperature recorders were retrieved, compost material samples were collected, and windrows were reconstructed following the same protocol described previously to initiate a second compost cycle. During the second compost cycle, temperatures were monitored as previously described and moisture added as needed. As with the first compost cycle, once temperature measurements reflected a sustained temperature of less than 100\u00b0C in all windrows, windrows were disassembled for retrieval of temperature recorders and collection of compost material samples and remaining materials were incinerated.",
