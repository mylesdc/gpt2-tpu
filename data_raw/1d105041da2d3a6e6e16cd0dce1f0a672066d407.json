            "text": "Although canine adenovirus (CAdV) is highly prevalent in dogs, there is currently a lack of a quick diagnostic method. In this study, we developed a rapid immunochromatographic strip (ICS) assay using colloidal gold coupled to CAdV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). BALB/c mice were immunized with a purified CAdV-2 suspension, and four mAbs (belonging to two different epitopes) were generated and designated as 2C1, 7D7, 10D1, and 4G1. Western blot and protein spectral analysis indicated that the hexon protein of CAdV-2 recognized all four mAbs. The colloidal gold-coupled 7D7 and 2C1 mAbs were chosen for inclusion in the rapid ICS assay. The optimal concentrations of the coating antibody (2C1), the capture antibody (7D7), and the goat anti-mouse antibody were 1.0 mg/ml, 10 \u00b5g/ml, and 2.0 mg/ml, respectively. The limit of detection was approximately 2.0 \u00d7 10 2 tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 )/ml. Other common canine viruses were tested to evaluate the specificity of the ICS, and positive results were observed for only CAdV-1 and CAdV-2. The ICS test was conducted on 360 samples to detect CAdV, and the results were compared with those of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. The ICS test was found to be a sufficiently sensitive and specific detection method for the convenient and rapid detection of CAdV.",

Western blot results showed that these four mAbs specifically recognized the 330-kDa protein bands of CAdV-2 via SDS-PAGE (Figure 2A) . Furthermore, the 330-kDa protein was analyzed via MALDI-TOF-MS on the basis of peptide mass matching. An NCBI database search revealed that the 330-kDa protein that reacted with all four mAbs was a hexon (69 peptides with scores larger than 26 were significant; p < 0.05; Figure 2B ).

Western blot and MALDI-TOF-MS analysis revealed that all four mAbs recognized the CAdV-2 hexon protein. The trimeric hexon protein is the major structural component of the CAdV capsid, which appears relatively well conserved. The BLAST result showed that the CAdV-2 hexon protein had > 96% nucleotide identity and 100% coverage of the CAdV-1 hexon protein sequence, suggesting that the mAbs that recognized CAdV-2 may also recognize CAdV-1. Indeed, specificity testing showed that both could be detected by the ICS. The fact that the ICS is unable to distinguish between CAdV-2 and CAdV-1 might be an important limitation of this assay. Therefore, this ICS can serve as a quick field test that is used to direct which confirmatory PCR should be used to determine the type and help plan treatment. Moreover, there is a commercial ICS (Genbody, Korea) for rapid detection of CAdV-2 antigens on the market, so we can combine commercial ICS for CAdV-2 with our ICS for CAdV to determine the type. Of course, ICS testing must be also combined with a review of clinical symptoms of diseased animals in order to properly diagnose and treat in a clinical setting. Virus isolation and real-time PCR assays are reliable methods for diagnosis of CAdV infections; however, these methods are mostly restricted to well-equipped laboratories. The ICS method has been widely applied to detect various infectious agents (Li et al., 2011; Nakayama et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2019) , including canine viruses such as rabies and CPV (Tao and Li, 2014; Sharma et al., 2018) . However, there are no publications regarding ICS detection of CAdV, although there is commercial ICS that detect CAdV-2 on the market. Therefore, we developed an ICS using colloidal gold coupled with two CAdV-2-specific mAbs, and it was highly specific for detection of CAdV-2 and CAdV-1. This novel ICS will be useful for rapid diagnosis of CAdV without the need for expensive equipment.",

In this study, we chose two mAbs which targeted different epitopes as capture and detector antibodies in order to guarantee the sensitivity and specificity of the ICS and prevent other possible antigens from conjugating to the antibody. The limit of detection of the test strip was 2.0 \u00d7 10 2 TCID 50 /ml, which is more sensitive than the ICS developed using a single polyclonal antibody (pAb) and single mAb (limit of detection = 6.6 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 /ml) (Sharma et al., 2018) or another using two mAbs (limit of detection = 2.9 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 /ml) (Li et al., 2011) . Its sensitivity was also higher than that of the commercial CAdV-2 test strip from Korean GenBody (limit of detection = 3.0 \u00d7 10 2 TCID 50 /ml). In addition, the sample diluent is also an important part in the colloidal gold test strip system, as there is a risk of non-specific release without using the sample diluent. In our sensitivity testing, CAdV-2 diluted in serum took a longer time for the bands to appear, and the bands were lighter than in samples diluted in sample dilution buffer. Therefore, the samples must be properly diluted in the sample diluent during clinical testing.",
