Since we only collected 2-year data (2014 and 2015) after the \"Selective Two Child Policy\" (2014), the representativeness of the changing trend and solid statistical analysis was limited. Therefore, our results could not detect the effect of \"Selective Two Child Policy\" directly. We just suggest that the policy regulation may affect slight upward trend in mortalities to rise healthcare workers' attention about this potential problem (as we discussing in \"Limitations\", Page 3, Line 17-20 and Page 15, Line 15-19). It seems we haven't explained clearly the three mortalities, so we clarify the definition of \"neonatal mortality rate (NMR)\", \"infant mortality rate (IMR)\" and \"under-5 mortality rate (U5MR)\" in methods section (Page 6, Line 2-6). That is to say, U5MR included IMR, and IMR included NMR. Therefore, increasing in NMR (+0.08) must be smaller than IMR (+0.16) and U5MR (+0.20). However, increasing in mortalities in neonates (<28 days) and children aged 28 days to 1 year were bigger than children aged 1-4 years indeed after we calculated mortalities in different age groups. Increasing in mortalities in neonates and children aged 28 days to 1 year and 1-4 years were 0.08, 0.08 and 0.04 (from 1.50\u2030, 0.83\u2030 and 0.56\u2030 in 2014 to 1.58\u2030, 0.91\u2030 and 0.60\u2030 in 2015).

As the review mentioned above, Bayesian inference is really an excellent method and can be used in many fields. The present study used the surveillance data between 1992 and 2015 from Beijing Under-5 mortality rate Surveillance Network and aimed to analyze the dynamic changes in U5MR. The index of U5MR is an important indicator which reflects children's health and the development of economy and culture in a country or area. U5MR is different from cause-specific mortality rate, which is affected by many aspects of influencing factors such as population, policy, economy and environment. In addition, we can only acquire death data (case group) from the surveillance network and lack of healthy children data (control group). Therefore, using traditional regression analysis methods which consider related impact factors to predict is limited. ARIMA model can use time to replace kinds of influencing factors and can be established on the base of past values of series and previous error for forecasting. It has been applied to forecast incidence of hand-foot-mouth disease [1] , influenza H5N1 [2] and injury [3] . What's more, U5MR has continuity in time. In the model we established, R2=0.982, AIC=2.15, BIC=2.30 and MAPE=4.76%. Therefore, it is appropriate to forecast U5MRs by ARIMA model. Bayesian inference can use apriori information and sample information to establish steadier forecasting model to capture detailed patterns of mortality. Bayesian inference and ARIMA model both have advantages and disadvantages in prediction. We intend to process another further study to compare the effect of Bayesian inference and ARIMA model in predicting U5MRs. Furthermore, in the present study, we only intended to observe the long-term and prospective changing trend in mortality rates in entire under-5 children through the forecasting model, so we didn't consider to accounts for different age groups and specific diseases. At the same time, considering the length of the article, we are going to consider the suggestions in the future.",
