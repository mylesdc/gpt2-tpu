Unfortunately, there is still a lack of antiviral drugs or vaccines for a large number of viruses, and this represents a remarkable challenge particularly for emerging and re-emerging viruses. For this reason, the identification of broad spectrum antiviral compounds provides a valuable opportunity for developing efficient antiviral therapies. Here we report on a class of rhodanine and thiobarbituric derivatives displaying a broad spectrum antiviral activity against seven different enveloped viruses including an HSV-2 acyclovir resistant strain with favorable selectivity indexes. Due to their selective action on enveloped viruses and to their lipid oxidation ability, we hypothesize a mechanism on the viral envelope that affects the fluidity of the lipid bilayer, thus compromising the efficiency of virus-cell fusion and preventing viral entry.",

In a recent work, we showed that our compounds were also active against HSV-1/2, while they were completely ineffective against HPV, a nonenveloped virus [11] . These results suggested that the mode of action of our molecules could involve the viral envelope. Compounds acting on viral envelopes have been previously described: RAFI compounds inhibit a broad range of enveloped viruses by inserting into viral envelopes and altering the fusion kinetics in the hemifusion stalk due to their inverted cone structure [12] . Liposomes extracting cholesterol from viral envelopes have been reported to inhibit HIV, HCV and HBV [13] . Virolytic antiviral peptides derived from mastoparan were shown to inhibit different enveloped viruses acting on the envelope and causing its detachment from the viral core [14] . The selectivity of these strategies is based on the fact that viral envelopes are static and characterized by an absence of repair mechanisms, in contrast with the biogenic membranes of the cells that are endowed with plenty of tools to repair membrane damage or alteration [15] . Furthermore, since envelope lipids are derived from host cells, it is more complicated to the virus to develop resistance to these compounds if compared to those targeting the classical viral components; for this reason they are extremely promising targets also for viruses with a high mutation rate.",

The results shown in Fig 7A, 7B and 7C, demonstrate that the compound is not altering viral binding capability, differently from heparin, a known attachment inhibitor [16] . On the contrary, when entry assays were performed, it was possible to observe a reduction in the amount of virus associated to the cells ( Fig 7D) . With this assay, the signal from the virus could be related to virus in the cytoplasm or blocked in the endosomes, since the treatment with acidic glycine is affecting only the virus at the surface of the cell. For this reason we performed also an in immunofluorescence (IF) in which it was possible to visualize that there is virus signal in discrete dots, possibly endosomes, while in the control the viral signal is diffused in the cytoplasm (Fig 7E) , supporting the hypothesis that part of the virus could be blocked in endosomes due to an impaired fusion.",

After the exposure to compound 9d, the linoleic acid underwent a remarkable lipid peroxidation in the liposome system (Fig 8) .

In lipid peroxidation, free radicals attack double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids forming lipid hydroperoxides, which undergo homolytic scission to form a variety of cytotoxic compounds, such as aldehydes. This oxidative stress plays an important role in damaging membrane lipids. According to previous literature, the potential oxidative effect of 9d was evaluated toward the oxidation of linoleic acid, a carboxylic acid with two double bonds as a model lipid substrate. The lipoperoxidation of linoleic acid, incorporated in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) liposomes was determined using the TBA assay [20, 21] . DPPC liposomes were prepared with the thin film evaporation method and used to mimic a phospholipid bilayer, and to dissolve linoleic acid. TBA assay, commonly used as an index of lipid peroxidation, is based on the reactivity of malondialdehyde (MDA), a colourless end-product of degradation, with 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) to produce a pink adduct (TBA-MDA-TBA) that absorbs at 535 nm. MDA is indeed one of the final products of polyunsaturated fatty acids peroxidation in the cells and is generally considered an indicator of lipid peroxidation. MDA was detected spectrophotometrically according to the method described by Bay et al. with the following modifications [22] .",

After cooling in an ice bath, 4.0 mL of 1-butanol were added to each tube and the TBA-MDA-TBA complex was extracted upon stirring and centrifugation. The organic supernatant was evaluated by spectrophotometry. The calibration curve of TBA-MDA-TBA complex was obtained using a MDA precursor 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane. MDA can be obtained by acid hydrolysis from 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane in an equimolecular reaction.
