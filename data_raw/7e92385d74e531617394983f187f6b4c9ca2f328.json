            "text": "Musk of musk deer has been one of the most precious traditional medicinal materials for treatment of stroke, but trading is prohibited. Musk of muskrat, Ondatra zibethicus, is an accessible substitute for musk of musk deer. However, neuroprotective effects of the musk of muskrat on stroke model are so far unclear. Aim of the study is to determine neuroprotective effects of the musk of muskrat on focal cerebral ischemia. The protective effects against focal cerebral ischemia were evaluated using a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (90-minute occlusion followed by 24-hour reperfusion). Musk of muskrat was collected from scent bag of muskrat and orally administered at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg twice at times of 0 and 90 min after occlusion. The effects on sensorimotor dysfunction were investigated by using balance beam test and rotarod test after brain ischemia. The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Oral administration of musk at 300 mg/kg significantly reduced (p<0.001) the infarct volume by 32.4% compared with a vehicle-treated group. Oral administration of musk at 300 mg/kg also ameliorated ischemia-induced spontaneous and vestibule sensorimotor dysfunction in balance beam test and rotarod test compared with control group and COX-2 upregulation. Musk of muskrat may have neuroprotective effects against transient focal cerebral ischemia with recovery of sensorimotor dysfunction. Regarding the immunohistochemistry, the effects of muskrat may be due to anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of COX-2 expressions.",

Musk of muskrat consists of 2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine similar ingredients with musk of musk deer. It is known that musk of muskrat contains l-muscone, a key component, and macrocyclic musk compounds like civetone, cycloheptadecanone, cyclopentadecanone, cyclododecanone, and 22 kinds of C19-C26 fatty acids, sterol compounds, 19 kinds of esters, et cetera [6] [7] [8] .

Briefly, rats were anesthetized under 2% isoflurane in a mixture of N 2 O/O 2 (7:3) throughout the surgery. Left branch of carotid artery was exposed through a midline incision. The external carotid artery (ECA) was ligated and cut near the junction of the proximal ECA junction. The common carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were temporarily blocked by vascular clips. A 4-0 nylon monofilament (diameter 370 \u00b1 5 m) with a round silicone head was inserted into the ECA. Exact location of the suture was determined when the suture was inserted at a minimum of 18 mm from the CCA/ ICA junction. After 90 minutes of MCAo, the suture was removed to allow reperfusion. Rats in the sham operated group received the same surgical procedure except for a probe insertion. The rectal temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5 \u2218 C until 6 hours after ischemia with a heating lamp and blanket system (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Occlusion of the MCA was confirmed by the presence of characteristic behavioural deficits, such as paralyzed forelimb flexion, torso twist, and spontaneous circling after reperfusion. Rats that failed to meet these criteria were excluded from the study.",

Also it was found that it restrained COX-2 expression markedly when measuring after 24 h. MCAo model is known as the most suitable model for stroke treatment research because it induces focal cerebral ischemia by occluding proximal of middle cerebral artery where ischemic stroke occurs most frequently [14, 15] . Because there is the coexistence of necrosis of ischemic core and apoptosis spreading to penumbra region in MCAo model, it is the most analogous model with clinical stoke patients' pathophysiological and behavior pattern including extracellular edema and blood circulatory system intervention [16] . Both in clinical stroke and in MCAo model, necrosis at ischemic core cannot be protected without reperfusion therapy within 3 h; nevertheless it is known to be almost clinically unfeasible [16] . Meanwhile, in apoptosis arising in penumbra region neurons, death of neurons can be inhibited by neuroprotective substances [17, 18] . The brain infarct volume is the most important index to confirm the medicinal effects on injury of necrosis or apoptosis from focal ischemic stroke induced by MCAo model [19] and estimation of 90 min of MCAo-induced brain infarct volume after 24 h by TTC staining is known to be one of the most suitable conditions for evaluating the effects of sample due to its clear induction and low variation [20] . In this study, oral administration of musk of muskrat at doses of 300 mg/kg at 0 min and 90 min after MCAo significantly reduced brain infarct volume and infarct area was mostly restricted to ischemic core region. This result suggests that musk of muskrat can inhibit neuronal damage at penumbra region, which means it could be neuroprotective substance at focal cerebral ischemia.",

Brain injury is a form of physical impairment, accompanied by sensorimotor dysfunction [21] , and whether the sample ameliorates sensorimotor dysfunction is important to determine whether to conduct clinical trials [22] . The balance beam and rotarod tests are both commonly used to assess motor coordination and balance alterations following MCAo [12, 23] . These tests are also known to have considerable correlation with evaluation of locomotion by MCAo brain damage [24] . In this study, the reduction in infarct volume was accompanied by elevated balance beam score and prolonged rotarod latency after musk of muskrat treatment. The results suggest that the protective effect of musk of muskrat in cerebral cortex and corpus striatum injury is associated with a restoration of the ischemia-induced sensorimotor dysfunction, suggesting that musk of muskrat could help functional restoration after ischemia.",

Focal cerebral ischemia triggers an inflammatory reaction, which is known as the main factor to accelerate brain damage [25] . After several hours from ischemic stroke, blood brain barrier is collapsed and leukocytes invade in large scale in succession and mass production of inflammatory cytokine accelerates tissue damage, brain edema, and glial activation [26] . COX-2 is rate-limiting enzyme in charge of inflammatory reaction by transforming arachidonic acid into prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 [27] . COX-2 expression increases as of the activation of NMDA receptor from excessive glutamate release [28] and the production of inflammatory cytokine in focal cerebral ischemia [29] . It is known that this increase of COX-2 expression is one of the main reasons of secondary damage at ischemic stroke and, also, it has proved that selective COX-2 inhibitor or COX-2 gene deletion shows neuroprotective effect [30] [31] [32] [33] . These results suggest that neuroprotective effects of musk of muskrat after focal cerebral ischemia might be attributable to interrupting inflammatory reaction by the inhibition of COX-2 expression.",
