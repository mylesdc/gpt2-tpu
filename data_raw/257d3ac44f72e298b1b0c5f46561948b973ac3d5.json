However, the pathogenicity of RVA has never been directly compared in homologous and heterologous hosts. The bovine RVA/Cow-tc/KOR/K5/2004/G5P[7] strain, which was shown to possess a typical porcine-like genotype constellation similar to that of the G5P[7] prototype RVA/Pig-tc/USA/OSU/1977/G5P9[7] strain, was examined for its pathogenicity and compared with the porcine G5P[7] RVA/Pig-tc/KOR/K71/2006/G5P[7] strain possessing the same genotype constellation. The bovine K5 strain induced diarrhea and histopathological changes in the small intestine of piglets and calves, whereas the porcine K71 strain caused diarrhea and histopathological changes in the small intestine of piglets, but not in calves. Furthermore, the bovine K5 strain showed extra-intestinal tropisms in both piglets and calves, whereas the porcine K71 strain had extra-intestinal tropisms in piglets, but not in calves. Therefore, we performed comparative genomic analysis of the K71 and K5 RVA strains to determine whether specific mutations could be associated with these distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes. Full-length sequencing analyses for the 11 genomic segments for K71 and K5 revealed that these strains were genetically nearly identical to each other. Two nucleotide mutations were found in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of NSP5 and the 3\u2032 UTR of NSP3, and eight amino acid mutations in VP1-VP4 and NSP2. Some of these mutations may be critical molecular determinants for RVA virulence and/or pathogenicity.",

Among these genotypes, the G (for glycoprotein) and P (for protease-sensitive) genotypes for the VP7 and VP4 outer capsid proteins, respectively, are the most important and frequently analyzed for rotavirus classifications, as they possess important immunogenic epitopes that are relevant for immune protection and vaccine development [1, 8] . In extensive genomic studies, 27 G and 37 P genotypes have been identified globally, with various combinations of G and P genotypes distributed across humans and animals [7, 9] . The most common G serotypes of RVA found in pigs are G3, G4, G5, G9 and G11 in combination with two dominant P genotypes, P [6] and P [7] [10] [11] [12] . In calves, the G6, G8, and G10 genotypes are the major types in combination with either the P [1] , P [5] or P [11] genotype [13, 14] .",

Although it is still unclear what determines RVA host range restriction, several studies using different RVA strains and different animal models have implicated at least six rotaviral genome segments in host range restriction and virulence (VP4, VP7, VP3, NSP1, NSP2 and NSP4) [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Furthermore, there are several reports of direct transmission of RVA strains containing all 11 genome segments from heterologous species in nature. Complete genome analyses of equine RVA strain RVA/ Horse-tc/GBR/H-1/1975/G5P [7] revealed a likely porcineto-equine interspecies transmission [29] . The human RVA strain RVA/Human-wt/BEL/B4106/2000/G3P [14] , detected and isolated from a child with enteritis, was shown to possess the same genotype constellation as a lapine G3P [14] RVA strain RVA/Rabbit-tc/ITA/30-96/1996/ G3P [14] [30] . Whole genome sequence and phylogenetic analyses have revealed that the human G3P [3] RVA strains RVA/Human-tc/ISR/Ro1845/1985/G3P [3] and RVA/Human-tc/USA/HCR3A/1984/G3P [3] are closely related to the canine RVA/Dog-tc/USA/CU-1/1982/G3P [3] , RVA/Dog-tc/AUS/K9/1981/G3P [3] and RVA/Dog-tc/ USA/A79-10/1979/G3P [3] RVA strains, and the feline RVA/Cat-tc/AUS/Cat97/1984/G3P [3] RVA strain in all the genome segments [31] . These reports further suggested that direct transmission of heterologous RVA strains can naturally induce gastroenteritis in a heterologous host [30, 32] . However, little is known about the exact pathology of these strains in both homologous and heterologous hosts under natural and experimental conditions. Generally, RVA have been thought to cause only gastrointestinal tract infection, especially in the small intestine. However, increasing evidence indicates that RVA can cause viremia and extra-intestinal infections in humans [33, 34] . These data suggest that RVA can escape from the intestinal lesions and routinely spread to extra-intestinal organs [33, 34] . In experimental animal models, it has been clearly demonstrated that RVA cause not only gastrointestinal infections but also extraintestinal infections [34] [35] [36] [37] , which are caused by viremia [37] [38] [39] [40] . These experiments were performed with homologous [36] , heterologous [35] [36] [37] [38] or reassortant RVA strains [39, 40] . However, there is a paucity of direct comparison data on virulence and intestinal and extra-intestinal pathogenicity of RVA strains in their own homologous and heterologous hosts.",

            "text": "Porcine and bovine RVA are important pathogens because of their significant economic impact on the livestock industry as well as their crucial role as reservoirs for human infections [5, 11, 41] . Therefore, we previously investigated the causes of porcine and bovine diarrhea illnesses and characterized multiple RVA isolates from diarrheic fecal samples [11, 19, 20, 32] . Among the Korean RVA isolated, the bovine RVA strains RVA/Cow-tc/KOR/ K5/2004/G5P [7] and RVA/Cow-tc/KOR/K8/2005/G5P [7] isolated from diarrheic calves have a remarkably similar genotype constellation as the porcine G5P [7] RVA strain OSU [32] . This prompted us to investigate whether this heterologous strain K5 could efficiently infect and induce diarrhea and pathology in the intestinal and extra-intestinal tracks of its homologous (piglets) and heterologous (calves) host. To assess the cross-species pathogenicity of the bovine K5 RVA strain in calves and piglets, the porcine G5P [7] OSU-like RVA strain RVA/Pig-tc/KOR/K71/2006/G5P [7] isolated from a diarrheic piglet was also used for comparison in this study. From these experimentally infected animals, various tissues and organs, fecal and nasal swabs and blood were sampled and analyzed for morphological changes, antigen distribution using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and viral RNA presence by RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. To better understand the potential consequences of viral genetic variations on infection characteristics, the genomic polymorphisms between the porcine K71 and bovine K5 strains were compared. The findings from our study provide insight into the possible functional contributions of viral genomic polymorphisms in the virulence and pathogenicity of heterologous RVA strains.",

The supernatants along with the remaining bulk samples were collected and stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to analysis. After extracting total RNA from supernatants, each real time RT-PCR reaction was performed using a Rotor-Gene Real-Time Amplifica and this threshold, a direct relation between the cycle number and the log concentration of RNA molecules initially present in the RT-PCR reaction was evident. By linear regression analysis of these data, Rotorgene 6000\u00ae software set up a standard curve, which enabled the determination of the concentration of RNA present in the samples.",

For the porcine K71 strain, the full-length VP7 and partial VP4 genomic sequences were also determined [11] . In this study, the full-length genomic sequences of both strains were sequenced by RT-PCR assays with GSP specific to both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end sequences. In addition, 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 RACE for the 11 genome segments of both strains was performed to obtain the full-length nucleotide sequences of both strains. The full-length nucleotide sequences of all 11 genomic segments of both porcine K71 and bovine K5 strains were analyzed and compared with those of the reference RVA strains. Generally, both strains shared 99.6-100% nucleotide identities of all 11 genomic segments ( Table 5 ). The gene segments for K71 and K5 had the highest nucleotide identities with porcine RVA strain OSU (VP1-VP4, VP7, NSP1-NSP3), porcine strain JL94 (VP6), porcine strain RMC321 (NSP4), and panda strain CH-1 (NSP5) ( Table 5 ). The genotype constellations of strains K71 and K5 were identical; G5-P[7]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1, which is typical for porcine G5P [7] RVA strains, such as OSU (see Additional file 3). Phylogenetic analyses also demonstrated that all 11 genomic segments of both porcine K71 and bovine K5 strains clustered with those of porcine and porcine-like RVA strains (see Additional file 4).",

Sequential histopathological lesion changes in the small intestines of piglets and calves infected with each strain are summarized in Additional files 5, 6, 7 and 8. The porcine K71 strain tended to cause a sequential increase of histopathological lesion changes in the small intestine of inoculated piglets, but induced only mild changes in the small intestine of calves (see Additional files 5, 6, 7 and 8 and Figure 1 ). RVA antigen-positive cell counts in the small intestinal villi were much higher in piglets than in calves (see Additional files 5, 6, 7 and 8 and Figure 2 ). Mock-inoculated or inactivated-virus-inoculated piglets and calves had no diarrhea, fecal virus shedding, or histopathological changes in the small intestine. From these results, it can be concluded that the porcine K71 strain efficiently infected the small intestines of piglets, but not calves. In contrast to the porcine K71 strain, the bovine K5 strain induced continuous diarrhea in both virus-inoculated piglets and calves from 1 dpi to the termination of the experiment (Tables 2 and 4 ). Fecal virus shedding was also continuously detected by nested PCR from K5 strain-inoculated piglets and calves (Tables 2 and 4 ). The bovine K5 strain tended to cause a sequential increase of small intestinal lesion changes in both virus-inoculated calves and piglets (see Additional files 7 and 8, and Figure 3 ).

Real-time PCR results showed that viral RNA copy numbers of the porcine RVA strain K71 was observed in the feces of piglet at 1 dpi, reached a peak at 3 dpi, and then gradually declined after 5 dpi ( Figure 7A ). As expected, viral RNA copy numbers of porcine K71 strain were much lower in the fecal samples of virusinoculated calves than those of virus-inoculated piglets throughout the experimental period ( Figure 7A ). These results demonstrate that the porcine K71 strain efficiently replicated and induced pathology in the intestines of piglets, but not in those of calves. The bovine K5 strain replicated and induced pathology in the intestines of both virus-inoculated piglets and calves, but the viral RNA copy numbers were higher in the feces of piglets than in those of the calves, suggesting that strain K5 replicated more efficiently in piglets than in calves ( Figure 7B and C) .",

Therefore, viremia and extra-intestinal tropisms were evaluated in the sera and extra-intestinal specimens obtained from piglets inoculated with either porcine K71 or bovine K5 strains and calves inoculated only with the K5 strain. The viremia caused by the inoculation of the porcine K71 strain in piglets was detected by nested PCR at 2 dpi, and persisted for 2 or 3 days (Table 1 ), but no viremia was detected in the calves (Table 3 ). Real-time PCR results showed that viral RNA in the sera of virus-inoculated piglets were present at 1 dpi, reaching a peak at 3 dpi, and then gradually decreasing ( Figure 7A ). The viral RNA of bovine K5 strain were detected by nested PCR at 1 or 2 dpi in both virus-inoculated piglets and calves, and lasted to 5 dpi in piglets and to 6 dpi in calves (Tables 2 and 4 ). Real-time PCR detected viral RNA of bovine K5 strain in the sera from both virus-inoculated piglets and calves at 1 dpi; the copy numbers increased at 3 dpi and then decreased at 5 dpi ( Figures 7B and C) .

Knowledge of the virulence and pathogenicity of RVA strains in different host species is key to understanding methods of prevention and control of RVA infections. Direct interspecies transmissions of RVA have been reported to occur in nature on a number of occasions [31, 32, 54] . However, the pathogenicity of such strains remains largely unknown in different host species. In our previous report [32] , the bovine K5 strain has been isolated from a diarrheic calf, and characterized as a porcine-like RVA strain due to having the same genotype constellation as the porcine RVA reference strain OSU. In the present study, we further characterized its pathogenicity in its homologous (piglets) and heterologous (calves) hosts. In addition, the virulence of the bovine K5 strain in the homologous and heterologous hosts was compared with that of the porcine K71 strain. The porcine K71 strain was isolated from a diarrheic piglet and was identified as being an OSU-like strain with a genotype constellation identical to that of the OSU strain [11] . On the contrary to our expectations, the bovine K5 strain showed pronounced virulence and pathogenicity in the homologous (piglets) as well as heterologous (calves) hosts; piglets and calves infected with this strain had continuous diarrhea, high virus RNA copy numbers in the fecal samples, and severe and large histopathological lesions in the small intestinal mucosa. As expected, however, the porcine K71 strain had severe virulence and pathogenicity in piglets, but not in calves. When RVA cross the host species barrier, this is usually a dead-end infection since the virus is not able to properly spread in the new host species. However, if the interspecies transmitted virus is able to reassort with RVA inherent in that host species, the resultant reassortant strains may have a higher probability to efficiently infect and spread among the population of the new host [5, 25, 54, 55] . On the contrary to this general belief, our results highlight the existence of different enteropathogenic virulence depending on the strains, even among those with the same genotype constellation in nature. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the virulence and host range restriction of a particular RVA strain in its homologous and heterologous hosts.",

            "text": "Although the virulence and pathogenicity of heterologous RVA infections have never been documented under natural conditions, they have been reported in experimental conditions. Simian RVA strain RRV and lapine strains share similar VP4, VP7 and NSP1, which have been implicated in host range restriction, and the simian RRV strain has been shown to replicate efficiently and to transmit horizontally in a rabbit model [56] . Therefore, it is possible that the possession of these three related genes may confer RRV the ability to replicate efficiently in rabbits [56] . Genetically, human DS-1-like strains are believed to have a common origin with bovine RVA strains because they share the same genotypes of six genomic segments (VP6, VP1, VP2, VP3, NSP2, and NSP4) [5] . Moreover, DS-1-like strains have been shown to successfully infect cattle [57, 58] , but not piglets [26] . On the contrary, the virulent human RVA strain Wa has a similar genomic constellation to those of porcine RVA, i.e., only the VP7, VP4, and VP6 genotypes are different with the porcine RVA strain OSU, VP7, VP4, and NSP1 with the porcine RVA strain Gottfried, and VP7, VP4, VP6, and VP2 genes with the porcine RVA strain A131 [5] . Moreover, the human RVA strain Wa induces diarrhea and pathology in the small intestine of piglets [38, 59] . Based on these genomic and pathological properties, it has been speculated that human Wa-like RVA strains could have a common origin with the porcine Wa-like strains [5] . In the present study, both the bovine K5 and the porcine K71 RVA strains shared the genotype constellation with porcine RVA strain OSU, and induced diarrhea and intestinal pathology in piglets. In calves, however, the virulence of both strains was different; the bovine K5 strain induced diarrhea and intestinal pathology, but the porcine K71 did not. It is still unknown why the genetically nearly identical porcine K71 and bovine K5 strains had different virulence in calves. Interestingly, the human Wa-like strain D can also infect and induce mild disease in calves [5, 57] . Like the human Wa-like strain D, the bovine K5 strain showed virulence not only in piglets, but also in calves. Host specificity and pathogenicity of RVA may be the result of the interaction of numerous host factors and viral proteins. However, the molecular basis for virulence and/or host range restriction of the RVA strain is still unclear. To date, a number of gene segments have shown to be capable of affecting host range restriction and/or virulence (VP3, VP4, VP7, NSP1, NSP2, and NSP4) [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Most of these experiments were conducted using reassortant strains possessing quite different parental viruses. Our data show highly different virulence profiles in different hosts between two closely related RVA strains with identical genotype constellations. This indicates that differences in virulence and host range restriction cannot be fully explained by the genotype constellation.",

These unique mutations between the two strains may be possible candidates for virulence determinants in the heterologous host (Table 6 ). Since little information is available about the key virulence determinants (mutations) responsible for virulence and pathogenicity of RVA in a heterologous host, it is still uncertain whether the increased virulence and pathogenicity of bovine K5 strain in the heterologous host (calves) is induced by any single substitution in a certain gene or by a combination of these substitutions. Furthermore, three amino acid substitutions in VP1, VP3 and VP4, and one nucleotide substitution in the 3\u2032 UTR of K5 were found to be unique in comparison with other porcine and bovine RVA reference strains. Since the virulence and pathogenicity in the heterologous and/or homologous hosts of these porcine and porcine-like bovine RVA reference strains has not been tested, it is still uncertain whether the increased virulence and pathogenicity of bovine K5 strain in the heterologous host (calves) are induced by the observed substitutions. Therefore, the molecular and biological properties of each genome segment, and its possible association with host range restriction and/or virulence will be needed to be clarified in further studies, using reverse genetics to swap individual genes of these viruses or introduce particular mutations. The exact mechanisms of how the bovine K5 strain acquired these specific mutations are unknown. The mutations of strain K5 could have been acquired by serial replication in vivo in calves, or alternatively, the mutations of strain K5 could have occurred during serial replication in vivo in piglets, and subsequently have been transmitted to calves.",

Moreover, viremia and extra-intestinal pathogenicity of RVA infection have been clearly demonstrated in experimental animal models [35] [36] [37] 39, 40, 62] . However, little information is available as to whether heterologous RVA strains cause viremia and extra-intestinal pathogenicity in heterologous hosts. To address this point, we sequentially collected serum and extra-intestinal organs and tissues from piglets and calves inoculated with the bovine heterologous strain K5. Both piglets and calves inoculated with the K5 strain showed similar dynamics of viral RNA in the sera and extra-intestinal organs and tissues. Viral RNA was detected at 1 dpi and its concentration reached a peak at 3 or 5 dpi, and then gradually decreased. Viral antigen was detected in these extra-intestinal organs and tissues where degeneration and/or necrosis of the corresponding parenchymal cells were observed. Although this is the first report that the heterologous RVA strain causes viremia and extra-intestinal pathogenicity in its heterologous hosts, the patterns of viremia and extra-intestinal infection are consistent with those of other reports [35] [36] [37] 39, 40, 62] .",

In addition, non-synonymous mutations of bovine K5 strain compared with those of porcine homologous K71 strain may contribute to virus replication ability, virulence, and pathogenicity in the heterologous host (calves). These preliminary observations contribute to our understanding of RVA infection in homologous and heterologous hosts. To further clarify the molecular and biological properties of each genomic segment associated with host range restriction and/or virulence, a combination of standard biochemical and molecular tools, together with the experimental inoculation studies with many heterologous strains in their natural homologous and heterologous hosts and new technologies such as reverse genetics system, will be required.",
