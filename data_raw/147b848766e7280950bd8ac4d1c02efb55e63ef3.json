            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been a notable etiological agent of acute respiratory infection in humans, but it was not discovered until 2001, because HMPV replicates only in a limited number of cell lines and the cytopathic effect (CPE) is often mild. To promote the study of HMPV, several groups have generated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing recombinant HMPV strains (HMPV GFP ). However, the growing evidence has complicated the understanding of cell line specificity of HMPV, because it seems to vary notably among HMPV strains. In addition, unique A2b clade HMPV strains with a 180-nucleotide duplication in the G gene (HMPV A2b 180nt-dup strains) have recently been detected. In this study, we reevaluated and compared the cell line specificity of clinical isolates of HMPV strains, including the novel HMPV A2b 180nt-dup strains, and six recombinant HMPV GFP strains, including the newly generated recombinant HMPV A2b 180nt-dup strain, MG0256-EGFP. Our data demonstrate that VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells generally showed the highest infectivity with any clinical isolates and recombinant HMPV GFP strains. Other human-derived cell lines (BEAS-2B, A549, HEK293, MNT-1, and HeLa cells) showed certain levels of infectivity with HMPV, but these were significantly lower than those of VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells. Also, the infectivity in these suboptimal cell lines varied greatly among HMPV strains. The variations were not directly related to HMPV genotypes, cell lines used for isolation and propagation, specific genome mutations, or nucleotide duplications in the G gene. Thus, these variations in suboptimal cell lines are likely intrinsic to particular HMPV strains.",

MNT-1 [35] and HEK293 (ATCC CRL-1573) cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. LLC-MK2 derivative cells (ATCC CCL-7.1) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. A549 (NIHS JCRB0076) and BEAS-2B (ATCC CRL-9609) cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. All cells were incubated at 37\u02daC in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere except where otherwise indicated. Generally, trypsin is used for HMPV propagation in cultured cells. Trypsin activates proteolytically the HPMV F protein. Our group has previously demonstrated that transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) also activates the HMPV F protein [21] . To construct TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cells, the coding sequence of human TMPRSS2 [36] was inserted into an expression vector pAP3neo (Takara Bio). VeroE6 cells were transfected with pAP3neo encoding human TMPRSS2 and cultured in the presence of 1.0 mg/ml geneticin (G418; Nacalai Tesque). A transduced VeroE6 cell line was cloned by limiting dilution to enrich the population of TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 cells (VeroE6/TMPRSS2). The cloned TMPRSS2-expressing VeroE6 (VeroE6/ TMPRSS2) cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and antibiotics. To obtain influenza virus NS1-expressing A549 cells, the coding sequence of influenza virus NS1 protein (PR8 strain) was FLAG-tagged and inserted into a murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector, pMXs-TRES-Puro Retroviral Vector (pMXs-IP) (Cell Biolabs). To generate the retrovirus vector, Platinium-GP cells (Cell Biolabs) were cotransfected with pMXs-IP encoding FLAG-tagged influenza virus NS1 protein and an expression plasmid for vesicular stomatitis virus G protein by using TransIT-LT1 (Mirus Bio), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three days later, retrovirus vectors in the culture supernatants were collected, and A549/hSLAM cells [37] were infected with the retrovirus vectors. A549/hSLAM cells stably expressing influenza virus NS1 protein (A549/hSLAM-NS1) were selected in medium containing 5 \u03bcg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich).",

First, the infectivity titer (infectious unit [IU]) of working stocks of clinical isolates and GFPexpressing recombinant HMPV strains was determined using VeroE6 cells. For this, VeroE6 cells were incubated with serially diluted virus stocks in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and antibiotics at 33\u02daC in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. No trypsin was added to the culture media to prevent the second round of infection. At 48 hours post-infection (hpi), the number of cells infected with GFP-expressing recombinant HMPV strain was counted under fluorescent microscopy. At 72 hpi, cells infected with clinical isolates of HMPV strains were subjected to an indirect immunofluorescent assay with mouse anti-HMPV-F monoclonal antibody (clone 1G3) [43] and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-Mouse IgG antibody (Thermo Fisher Science), and the number of HMPV-infected cells was counted under fluorescent microscopy. Based on these data, IU was calculated. Next, seven cell lines (LLC-MK2, Vero-ATCC, HeLa, MNT-1, HEK293, BEAS-2B, and A549) were infected with 100 IU of HMPV strains and incubated in appropriate culture medium without trypsin at 33\u02daC in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere.

            "text": "Recently, epidemiological survey studies by PCR have detected the unique 180nt-dup and 111nt-dup in the G gene of A2b subtype HMPV strains [8] [9] [10] . At the Virus Research Center, Sendai Medical Center, Japan, varieties of respiratory viruses have been routinely isolated using a microplate system harboring several types of cell lines [16, [44] [45] [46] . A2b subtype HMPV strains were isolated from 86 patients between 2014 and 2016 [16] . Among the 86 patients, 41 patients in different seasons or locations were selected, and the nucleotide sequences spanning the G gene of HMPV strains in these patients were directly determined using the clinical samples. From these clinical samples, 20 A2b 180nt-dup strains were detected, while no A2b strains with 111nt-dup (A2b 111nt-dup ) were detected. The information of HMPV strains isolated from the 41 patients was also provided in S2 Table. To understand the relationships of these 20 A2b 180nt-dup strains among HMPV strains, a phylogenetic analysis was performed using the G gene sequences of the 41 HMPV strains and previously reported HMPV strains. In the phylogenetic tree, the 20 A2b 180nt-dup strains detected in Sendai were located in a cluster together with 3 A2b 111nt-dup and 24 A2b 180nt-dup strains previously detected in Yokohama city, Japan, and Barcelona city, Spain [8-10] (Fig 1) . These data showed that all the A2b 180nt-dup and A2b 111nt-dup strains detected in different areas are closely related to one another. Six HMPV A2b strains without nt-dup duplication in the G gene (classical A2b [A2b classical ] strains) were also observed in this cluster (Fig 1) . To obtain the highest resolution of phylogenetic relationships of subtype A2b strains, a phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome sequences was performed. Subtype A2b HMPV strains, which were subjected to fulllength genome sequencing in this study, are listed in Table 1 (Strain #1-7). The full-length genome sequence of hMPV/Sendai/0256/2015 was successfully determined directly from the clinical specimen. For other strains, it was difficult to determine the full-length genome sequences directly from the clinical specimens. Therefore, to obtain sufficient amounts of viruses for sequencing, these isolates were passaged in selected cell lines and subjected to nextgeneration sequencing to determine full-length genome sequences. Cell lines used for isolation and propagation of each HMPV strain are indicated in Table 1 . In addition to these HMPV strains, all the full genome sequences of HMPV strains available at the NCBI (as of 20 August 2018), except for the sequences with ambiguous nucleotide(s), were used in this analysis. The A2b 180nt-dup strains isolated in Sendai formed a small cluster together with a HMPV A2b strain isolated in 2016 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA (HMPV/USA/NM009/2016, GenBank accession number KY474539) (Fig 2) . These data indicate that the A2b 180nt-dup strains isolated in Sendai between 2014 and 2016 were closely related to the HMPV strain isolated in Albuquerque. However, based on the nucleotide sequence data in GenBank, the Albuquerque strain (HMPV/USA/NM009/2016) does not have 180nt-dup.",

One nonsynonymous mutation was found in the F gene after the passages in MNT-1 cells (Fig 3, S3 Table) . These data demonstrated that virus selection does not necessarily occur during the isolation and passages in MNT-1, VeroE6/TMPRSS2, Vero-ATCC, and LLC-MK2 cells, although certain selection may occur occasionally. For other four patients (Patient #2-5, Table 2 ), we focused on the F-M2-SH-G region, which encodes all three surface glycoproteins (F, SH, and G). The nucleotide sequence of this region was successfully determined directly from the clinical specimens of the 4 patients. From the same specimens, infectious viruses (#2-5 in Table 1 ) were isolated and subjected to full-length genome sequencing, as described above. These sequence data demonstrated that 2 out of the 4 strains (#3 and #4 in Tables 1 and 2) acquired no amino acid changes in all 3 surface glycoproteins (F, SH, and G) and the M2 protein during the isolation and passages in MNT-1 and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (Table 1) . Meanwhile, the other 2 strains (#2 and #5 in Tables 1 and 2 ) acquired many mutations. One strain (#2 in Tables 1 and 2) possessed highly biased U-to-C mutations in the SH and G genes. The other strain (#5 in Tables 1 and 2) had at least one amino acid change in all 3 glycoproteins and M2 protein. These data suggest that, for these two strains, certain selection or adaptation has occurred during the isolation and passages in these cell lines. ",

            "text": "Titration of virus stocks or samples is a fundamental procedure in virus research. However, the infectivity titers may differ greatly when different cell lines are used because of the different susceptibility and permissibility of each cell line. Therefore, the most susceptible and permissible cell line is generally used for titration. In this study, to assess the cell line specificity of HMPV, the infectivity titers of HMPV were determined using eight cell lines (VeroE6, LLC-MK2, Vero-ATCC, HeLa, MNT-1, HEK293, BEAS-2B, and A549). Table 1 lists the 13 clinical isolates used for this assay. The 5 HMPV strains (#1-5 in Tables 1 and 2) that were used for sequence analyses were included in this assay. In addition to the 5 strains, 2 additional A2b classical strains (#6 and #7 in Table 1 ) were used. In addition to these 7 A2b subtype strains, the A1, A2a, B1, and B2 subtype strains (Table 1) were included in this assay. The infectivity titers of all clinical strains were the greatest when determined using VeroE6 or LLC-MK cells (Fig 4) . The infectivity titer of each strain in VeroE6 cells was set to 100% for comparison. Vero cells purchased from ATCC (Vero-ATCC cells) showed 29.4%-110.6% infectivity to these clinical isolates. Low to moderate levels of infectivity titers were detected in BEAS-2B (5.6%-60.0%), A549 (3.5%-77.9%) and HEK293 cells (3.1%-26.9%). Uniquely, IA3 strain showed significantly higher virus titers than other clinical isolates (Fig 4) . As described, the titers varied among HMPV strains, but all were lower than those in VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells. The infectivity titers in HeLa cells were very low and varied significantly among strains (1.4%-17.8%). Unexpectedly, the infectivity titers of all the clinical isolates were very low (0.5%-7.8%) when MNT-1 cells were used for titration (Fig 4) , although five of them (#1-5 in Table 1 ) were isolated efficiently using MNT-1 cells. It was noted that, in spite of the lower infectivity in MNT-1 cells than in other susceptible cell lines, CPE in MNT-1 was easier to detect than in VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells, when these cells were incubated with clinical specimens of HMPV [16] . We also speculate that there are particular differences between HMPV virions in patients and those in the supernatants of cultured cells. ",

Table 3 shows a list of six recombinant HMPV GFP . The parental strains of JPS02-76EGFP (JPS02-76 GFP ), NL/1/99-gfp (NL/1/99 GFP ), and NL/1/00-gfp (NL/1/00 GFP ) have been isolated and propagated in tMK cells [4, 11, 21, 23, 47] , while those of rHMPV-Rluc/GFP (JPN03-1 Rluc/GFP ) and MPV-GFP1 (CAN97-83 GFP ) have been isolated and propagated in LLC-MK2 cells [20, 22, 26, 48] . The parental strain of MG0256-EGFP (MG0256 EGFP ) was isolated and propagated in MNT-1 and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (Tables 1 and 3 ). JPS02-76 GFP , NL/1/99 GFP , NL/1/00 GFP , JPN03-1 Rluc/GFP , and MG0256 EGFP were generated from the full-length genome plasmids using BHK/T7-9 cells, as described previously [21] , and propagated in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. CAN97-83 GFP was purchased from ViraTree (http://www.viratree.com/) and propagated in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. The subtypes of the parental strains of six recombinant strains are shown in Table 3 . The infectivity titers of all six HMPV GFP strains were greatest when they were determined using VeroE6 cells (Fig 5) . The infectivity titer of each HMPV GFP strain in VeroE6 cells was set to 100% for comparison (Fig 5) . All the six HMPV GFP strains showed reasonably high titers in LLC-MK2 cells (61.8%-99.3%). The titers in Vero-ATCC cells were also relatively high, as observed with the clinical isolates of HMPV. Among the six recombinant HMPV GFP strains, the cell line specificity was the strictest for JPS02-76 GFP [21] . The infectivity titer of JPS02-76 GFP determined using HeLa, MNT-1, HEK293, and A549 cells was only 0.7%, 0.4%, 2.0%, and 3.8%, respectively. In contrast, all tested cells showed reasonably high infectivity with NL/1/00 GFP strain. The infectivity titer of NL/1/00 GFP using HeLa, MNT-1, HEK293, 5) . A lack of the type I interferon (IFN) gene [49] is a possible reason for why HMPV showed the highest infectivity titers in VeroE6 cells. We have tested whether blocking the innate immune signals enhances the infectivity of HMPV. For this purpose, A549 cells constitutively expressing influenza A virus NS1 protein (A549/hSLAM-NS1) were used. NS1 protein is known to inhibit IFN induction and/or signaling [50, 51] . As expected, VSV-infected A549/hSLAM-NS1 cells showed significantly lower transcription levels of IFN-\u03b2, MX1, and OASL, compared with VSV-infected parental (NS1-nontransduced) A549/hSLAM cells (Fig 6A) . However, the infectivity titers of four HMPV GFP strains determined using A549/hSLAM-NS1 cells were mostly unchanged, when compared with those using A549/hSLAM (Fig 6B) , suggesting that the lack of IFN responses is not the sole determinant of the high infectivity of VeroE6 cells with HMPV.

The infectivity of Vero-ATCC was also high, but it was 2-to 3-fold lower than that of VeroE6 cells. Vero and Vero-derived cell lines have a large deletion in the gene cluster of the interferon (IFN) genes [52] . Thus, these cells do not produce type I IFNs and show high susceptibility to many kinds of viruses [53, 54] . Lack of IFN responses could be a major factor for VeroE6 cells having high infectivity with HMPV. However, suppression of the innate immune responses, including IFN production, by the influenza virus NS1 protein did not enhance the infectivity of A549 cells with HMPV at all. LLC-MK2 cells also demonstrated similarly high infectivity with clinical HMPV strains as did VeroE6 cells. Unlike VeroE6 cells, LLC-MK2 cells retain a functional IFN system and produce IFN in response to virus infections and exhibit an antiviral state [55] [56] [57] [58] . Therefore, the quality or condition of the IFN system is not the main factor that determines the infectivity of each cell line with HMPV.",

When compared with VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells, BEAS-2B, A549, HEK293, MNT-1, and HeLa cells showed significantly lower infectivity with HMPV. In addition, the infectivity of these cell lines varied significantly among HMPV strains. Among the thirteen clinical isolates, only IA3 (subtype A1) strain showed more than 10% infectivity in all five cell lines (BEAS-2B, A549, HEK293, MNT-1, and HeLa cells). In addition, among the six recombinant HMVP GFP strains, NL/1/00 EGFP (subtype A1) showed the highest infectivity in these five cell lines (BEAS-2B, A549, HEK293, MNT-1, and HeLa cells). However, the high infectivity phenotype in these cell lines was not a common feature for subtype A1 strains, because another subtype A1 strain (IA10) showed as low infectivity as other clinical isolates in these five cell lines. These variations in cell line specificity may reflect the different behaviors among the HMPV strains in the virus life cycle, such as receptor specificity [59, 60] , entry route [31], and fusion triggering mechanism [61] . However, it should be noted that no significant difference has been observed in clinical presentations among HMPV strains [62] .",

However, this study demonstrated that no amino acid change was required in the surface glycoproteins or even in the entire genome of HMPV to propagate in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 and MNT-1 cells. The F protein is responsible for viral attachment and membrane fusion and is essential for viral infectivity. Compared with the F protein, the roles of the SH and G proteins are less clear, because these proteins are dispensable for virus infectivity [63] . The SH protein has properties consistent with those of viroporins and modulates viral fusogenic activity [64] . The G protein of certain HMPV strains binds to cell surface glycosaminoglycan and may enhance viral attachment to host cells [65, 66] . HMPV G protein binds to the RIG-I cytoplasmic RNA recognition receptor and inhibits the expression of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines of infected cells [67] . Even though no adaptation mutation was necessary for the viral glycoproteins to grow in the cell lines, certain strains have acquired mutations. No common mutation was observed, but the unique observation was that the nucleotide changes were mostly U to C, mainly in SH and G genes. Similar nucleotide changes have been reported for several viruses as a result of RNA editing by adenosine deaminases [68] . It has also been documented that a high rate mutation due to adenosine deaminases occurs on defective interfering RNA of HMPV, when the virus is passaged at high MOI [69] .",

No A2b 111nt-dup strains were detected in this study. The full-genome sequence analysis of A2b 180nt-dup strains demonstrated that 180nt-dup in the G gene was maintained in the virus genome during the process of virus isolation and passages in cell lines. No nt-dup was detected in other genes. The different length of the G gene was also reported in avian metapneumovirus (AMPV) subtype C, the most closely related virus to HMPV among all the known viruses [70] [71] [72] . Extensive passages of AMPV subtype C with the long G gene in Vero cells have resulted in almost complete deletion of the G gene from the viral genome [73] . Nucleotide duplications in the G gene have also been reported in human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [74, 75] . The nucleotide duplication (60 nucleotides in length) in the G gene of RSV enhances the virus attachment to CHO-K1 and BEAS-2B cells [74, 76] . The G protein of certain HMPV strains supports virus attachment to host cells by binding to cell surface glycosaminoglycan [65, 66] . However, the cell line specificity of HMPV A2b 180nt-dup strains remained similar to that of the HMPV A2b classical strains.",

Our data in this study demonstrate that VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells show the highest infectivity with clinical isolates and commonly used recombinant HMPV strains, including the novel A2b 180nt-dup strains, five recombinant HMPV GFP , which have been used in different laboratories, and the newly generated recombinant HMPV A2b 180nt-dup strain, MG0256-EGFP. The consensus is that VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells have the highest infectivity for all the HMPV strains. Meanwhile, the infectivity of other cell lines (BEAS-2B, A549, HEK293, MNT-1, and HeLa cells) with HMPV is significantly lower than that of VeroE6 and LLC-MK2 cells and varies significantly among HMPV strains. These variations are observed for both clinical isolates and recombinant HMPV strains and not related to HMPV subtypes, cell lines used for isolation and propagation, specific genome mutations, or nucleotide insertions. Therefore, these variations would be intrinsic to HMPV strains, but the significance in HMPV infection in humans is unclear because no significant difference has been observed in clinical presentations among HMPV strains [62] .
