            "text": "Background: Infectious disease surveillance is a process the product of which reflects both actual disease trends and public awareness of the disease. Decisions made by patients, health care providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing health care and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which changes constantly. Biases are therefore imbedded in surveillance systems; these biases need to be characterized to provide better situational awareness for decision-making purposes. Our goal is to develop a statistical framework to characterize influenza surveillance systems, particularly their correlation with the information environment. Methods: We identified Hong Kong influenza surveillance data systems covering healthcare providers, laboratories, daycare centers and residential care homes for the elderly. A Bayesian hierarchical statistical model was developed to examine the statistical relationships between the influenza surveillance data and the information environment represented by alerts from HealthMap and web queries from Google. Different models were fitted for non-pandemic and pandemic periods and model goodness-of-fit was assessed using common model selection procedures. Results: Some surveillance systemsespecially ad hoc systems developed in response to the pandemic flu outbreakare more correlated with the information environment than others. General practitioner (percentage of influenza-like-illness related patient visits among all patient visits) and laboratory (percentage of specimen tested positive) seem to proportionally reflect the actual disease trends and are less representative of the information environment. Surveillance systems using influenza-specific code for reporting tend to reflect biases of both healthcare seekers and providers. Conclusions: This study shows certain influenza surveillance systems are less correlated with the information environment than others, and therefore, might represent more reliable indicators of disease activity in future outbreaks. Although the patterns identified in this study might change in future outbreaks, the potential susceptibility of surveillance data is likely to persist in the future, and should be considered when interpreting surveillance data.",

Having found high correlations with traditional surveillance systems and noting the benefits of timeliness and low cost, Internet-based surveillance systems have been widely recognized as important supplementary data sources for influenza surveillance [5] .",

Our research has shown that decisions made by patients, healthcare providers, and public health professionals about seeking and providing healthcare and about reporting cases to health authorities are all influenced by the information environment, which we define as the information the population is exposed to through media, the Internet, social networks, and so forth. And since the information environment changes constantly, surveillance data systems that depend on decisions by patients and health professionals are likely to be biased, possibly in different ways [6, 7] . Epidemiologists and public health practitioners typically recognize these potential biases qualitatively, and present their analysis of the available data with appropriate caveats. Public health practitioners and clinicians are also aware of the surge in medical resource utilization caused by the \"worried well\" in response to media coverage of disease outbreaks [8] . Awareness of these biases is often lost, however, at higher levels [9] .",

Others simply view information environment data as a direct proxy for disease transmission. Surveillance systems that are fast, inexpensive, decentralized, automated, and utilize the power of information technology seem to satisfy the need for a magic bullet in the digital era. Whether such systems work as expected, or are another example of \"big data hubris\" [12] , remains an open question.",

Rather than thinking of influenza-related web queries and news being direct indicators of disease transmission in the population, we view them as indicators of the information environment. We built a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model to estimate the correspondence between individual surveillance data and the information environment proxy data. Although not employed in this analysis, the model has the potential to incorporate epidemiological expertise through informed prior distributions. The findings have enabled us to understand how each surveillance system is related to the information environment and disease status, which should eventually help public health practitioners interpret the influenza surveillance data for situational awareness purposes, as well as prioritizing resources to different surveillance systems given the specific decision-making needs.",

The out-patient ILI surveillance network reports the proportion of outpatients with ILI [Fever (>38\u00b0C, oral or equivalent) AND Cough or sore throat] on weekly basis [13, 14] . During the Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection (pH1N1) outbreak, eight designated flu clinics (DFC) were operated from June 13 th 2009 to May 23 rd 2010 [15] , while the general out-patient clinics data were interrupted [16] . Hospital Authority, a public-sector organization that oversees all public hospitals, manages over 95% of the in-patient care [17] . The weekly numbers of hospitalization with principle diagnosis of pneumonia and influenza (P&I; ICD9 480-487) and influenza (ICD9 487) were obtained from the Hospital Authority for age groups of 0-4,5-14,15-64 and \u226565 years. Respiratory specimens from sentinel out-patient clinics, general practitioners are routinely submitted to the Public Health Laboratory Centre (PHLC) of CHP for sentinel surveillance purpose, while specimens from other outpatient healthcare facilities and hospitals are routinely submitted to the PHLC for diagnostic purposes [13] .

The heterogeneity in the disease transmission dynamics and the informational environment is less likely to be attributable to the geographic variability. Therefore, the influenza surveillance systems are presumably monitoring a relatively homogenous population under the same informational environment, which is an important presumption for this modeling approach. Also, in addition to the normal winter-spring peak, Hong Kong usually experiences a summer peak in July to August [19] , which potentially doubles the data volume. Since 2004, the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) has been monitoring influenza activity using multiple surveillance systems summarized in a weekly surveillance dashboard. These include sentinel surveillance system based at Accidents and Emergency Department of public hospitals, private medical practitioners, general outpatient clinics, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, childcare centres and kindergartens and residential care homes for the elderly, as well as more traditional laboratory and influenza-related hospitalization surveillance systems. Given the variety of data types available, as well as the availability of reliable estimate of incidence rate based on serological study during pandemic period as gold standard [18] , Hong Kong is chosen for this project.",

HealthMap is an online information aggregator and surveillance platform that identifies, characterizes, and maps events of public health and medical importance in real-time [20] . For this project, the first author manually coded Chinese language feeds using data filtered by disease category and geographic location. All feeds in both English and Chinese categorized as respiratory illness and related to Hong Kong area were verified for the correctness and completeness based on the original sources. Among 4,695 feeds that were extracted from the earliest date available, 2,166 feeds posted between January 1 st , 2007 and November 28 th , 2009 were extracted and tabulated for this study. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for HealthMap alerts data can be found in Additional file 1: Table S1 . Given the bilingual cultural environment in Hong Kong, we developed an original search matrix covering the disease and behavior related indicators in both English and Chinese. The \"seed\" for keywords are first identified based on literature review [11] . Each seed keyword is then assessed for correlated search terms through the Google Correlates tool [21, 22] . Additional keywords are then identified through snowballing, until no more new keywords are shown in the correlation list. By using Google Insight for Searchnow rebranded as Google Trendsthe search volume index is retrieved for each of the keyword individually for Hong Kong. The search volume index, also called the \"interest over time\" on the new Google Trends website, is the search volume of the individual search term divided by its maximum search volume during the user specified period [23] starting from 2004 to the latest available data.",

In order to make sure the algorithm is robust to the choice of initial values and convergence is achieved, we used three sets of initial values. It should be noted that OpenBUGS has a feature to generate random initial valuesit is advised that the user chooses the initial values carefully, as randomly generated initial values may result in epidemiologically unreasonable prior densities or unreasonable collection of values for the posterior or the likelihood function, or very slow convergence for the algorithm. The initial values used in the model, along with the OpenBUGS code, are included in Additional file 2. For each parameter, 500,000 iterations are conducted; the posteriors are calculated after the first 5,000 iterations are discarded. Three chains converge quickly for both modelsusually stabilizing after 500 iterations. 500,000 iterations with three initial chains take about 3,000 seconds for the NP model and 15,000 for the P model.

Figure 3 illustrates how biases can be introduced into the surveillance systems by drawing in not only non-flu patients but also increased numbers of flu patients, who otherwise might not present themselves to any of the surveillance systems. The proportion of the infected population captured by the surveillance systemsdefined as \"completeness\"is usually not constant but fluctuates. A surveillance system might only capture a small proportion of the actual infected population. However, as long as the ratio stays constant and independent from the information environment, it can be a useful for tracking disease in the population. Out of eleven surveillance data streams, fiveflu-HA, percentage of ILI visits at designated flu clinics, notifiable infectious disease reporting, number of specimen tested positive, number of specimen receivedhave consistently significant coefficients for all four k's ( Figure 2 ). In other words, the proportion of actual infected cases being captured by these surveillance systems is strongly affected by the information environment. If the coefficient has a positive CI such as Google search term for seasonal flu term (Figure 2A) , it suggests more infected patient would be captured by the surveillance systems when web searching for \"flu\" and \"influenza\" increases. When the coefficient has a negative CI, such as Google search terms for flu medications ( Figure 2C ), it suggests that web searching related to flu medication is inversely correlated with the portion of flu infected population being captured. The category \"medications\" includes over-the-counter medications for ILI, which can be an indicator of self-diagnosis and self-treatment. Self-treatment behavior might be related to the decision of not seeking medical attention from healthcare practitioners, and therefore inversely correlated to the flu hospitalization, general practitioner patient visits, and so forth.",

The non-flu index coefficient is significant for flu hospitalization, number of lab tested positive specimens, percentage of specimens tested positive and percentage of ILI-visits at general practitioners during the non-flu season, which suggests these surveillance data streams are influenced by the information environment related to other diseases such as common cold when flu activity is low.

How to accurately and effectively separate the \"signal\" from the \"noise\" becomes one of the biggest challenges in analysing internet-based surveillance data. Some researchers have developed natural language processing algorithms to classify this information automatically [34, 42] , some use crowd-sourcing platforms to engage Internet users in tagging data manually [43] , and some use both [44] . The curated data, which is thought of as reflecting actual disease status, is then compared to the traditional surveillance data and tested for correlations [31, 32, 34, 35] . This approach, however, does not prove the validity of the new surveillance method since both data streams may reflect the same information environment, therefore be biased in the same way. For instance, Google Flu Trends, which had been performing well in tracking CDC surveillance data, dramatically over-estimated the flu activity in the United States in 2012-13 flu season [37] . The overestimation might be due to the extensive media coverage of flu during the winter holiday season [45] , but raises the question of how well Internet-based surveillance systems reflect flu activity per se, rather than other factors such as public awareness.

Since patients usually do not have the ability to distinguish influenza from other viral respiratory infections themselves, flu and non-flu infections may be just as likely to be presented to general practitioners. This pattern might not hold during the early stage of a pandemic, when the spread of novel influenza virus may not keep up with the spread of awareness, possibly leading to a negative correlation between the percentage of ILI-related general practitioner visits and the information environment.

Thus, it is possible that when the physicians are \"sensitized\" by the media and official guidelines, they may actively look for cases that fit the clinical definition of influenza and sample them for laboratory testing.

When comparing the four hospitalization data streams side by side, we observed that flu-HA looks more similar to P&I-HA(0-15 yr) ( Figures 9A and C) , while P&I-HA is more similar to P&I-HA(65+ yr) ( Figures 9B and D) . The patterns are consistent in flu and non-flu season and in different years (Figures 8 and 9) , and correspondent to the pandemic model. In the pandemic model, we observed that flu-HA is more correlated with the information environment than P&I-HA, while pediatric P&I-HA also seems to be more correlated with the information environment than the P&I-HA for the elderly. Also, when replaced the incidence rate of all-age with 5-14 yr, data fits better for flu-HA, general practitioner ILI-visits, notifiable infectious disease reporting and P&I-HA(0-15 yr) (Additional file 1: Table S9 ). During the pandemic flu outbreak, since the children and young adults were considered to be at higher risk than the elderly, physicians may tend to order more laboratory testing for pediatric patients [7] . During the non-pandemic period, the same clinical practice might still prevail. Since pediatric mortality is a reportable condition, clinicians are more likely to order laboratory tests and use a specific diagnostic code if the test results are positive. The elderly patients, however, who usually have non-specific clinical manifestation for respiratory diseases and lower viral loads [46] , are less likely to be sampled, less likely to have a positive result if tested, and usually given a less specific diagnostic code such as \"pneumonia and influenza\".",

Advances in information technology have made a wide range of data available to public health researchers and practitioners, offering the promise of improving current surveillance systems, generating more sensitive and timely warnings of disease outbreak or providing more accurate estimates of disease transmission. For this potential to be realized, however, the characteristics of these new data sources must be understood before they are used in sophisticated statistical models. Olson and colleagues have suggested, for instance, that Google Flu Trends' impressive retrospective correlation with ILI surveillance data may be a product of over-fitting by \"fishing\" through numerous search term combinations as part of data mining. Moreover, Google Flu Trends' tendency to miss the beginning of an outbreak and its poor accuracy at the local level also limits its application in providing early warning and situational awareness [37] . The importance of understanding the nature of the data and the environment in which the data is generated may be overshadowed by researchers' and practitioners' enthusiasm for data availability (i.e. \"big data\") and purely statistical patterns (often ignoring confounding variables or underlying processes).",

Google search volume for some keywords in Hong Kong is not large enough to generate a search index; or sometimes is not of the same time resolution as the weekly surveillance data. More than half of the search keywords, for instance, are only available on monthly basis.

For instance, individuals who are aware of the on-going transmission of influenza are likely to search for information for prevention and self-diagnosis purposes, and may tend to seek medical attention once feeling sick. Thus, although it has not been recognized and studied systemically, many influenza surveillance systems may reflect changes in the information environment as well as actual disease trends. And although the data we analysed are all from Hong Kong, the underlying mechanisms are not specific to that region, so the problem may be widespread. Indeed, Zhang and colleagues and Stoto found similar patterns using less formal methods in the United States [6, 7] . Some surveillance systems seem to represent public awareness more than actual disease status. In particular, ad hoc surveillance systems set up during the early ascertainment of pH1N1 outbreaksuch as the walk-in clinics for ILI, making pH1N1 as a new condition for notifiable infectious diseaseare more correlated with the information environment than other surveillance systems that we identified in Hong Kong. Such results help us better understand and characterize influenza surveillance systems, which can be used in data interpretation, resources allocation, new surveillance systems design",

Other than Google searches, correlation between social media (e.g. Twitter) and similar data with traditional flu surveillance data may only indicate that both are reflecting the same information environment, rather the social media data reflecting actual disease status. Often times they are not clearly distinguished; and, people readily jump to the conclusion that the information environment data can be used as a proxy for disease status. As shown in our study, such an approach has its limitations. Information environment data such as web queries and tweets in fact have dual usage, (1) as proxy for direct estimate for disease, and (2) as covariates to control the model for public awareness biases. When researchers promote the idea of using the Internet data for disease surveillance among practitioners, the differentiation was not made clearly, and sometimes is lost when being communicated to the general public. Our study provides a framework to understand how the information environment data is related to the traditional surveillance data, which will help to fine tune the usage of information environment data.",
