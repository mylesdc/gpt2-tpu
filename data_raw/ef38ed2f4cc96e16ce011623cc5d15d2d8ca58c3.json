Here, a strategy to facilitate manipulation and rescue of classical swine fever viruses (CSFVs) from full-length cDNAs present within bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) is described. This strategy allows manipulation of viral cDNA by targeted recombination-mediated mutagenesis within bacteria. Results: A new CSFV-BAC (pBeloR26) derived from the Riems vaccine strain has been constructed and subsequently modified in the E2 coding sequence, using the targeted recombination strategy to enable rescue of chimeric pestiviruses (vR26_E2gif and vR26_TAV) with potential as new marker vaccine candidates. Sequencing of the BACs revealed a high genetic stability during passages within bacteria. The complete genome sequences of rescued viruses, after extensive passages in mammalian cells showed that modifications in the E2 protein coding sequence were stably maintained. A single amino acid substitution (D3431G) in the RNA dependent RNA polymerase was observed in the rescued viruses vR26_E2gif and vR26, which was reversion to the parental Riems sequence.",

Infectious pestiviruses can be rescued using RNA transcripts derived from these BACs. The pestiviruses have single stranded positive sense RNA genomes, about 12.3 kb in length, which includes a single long open reading frame, encoding a large polyprotein, flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) that are critical for autonomous replication of the genome [12, 13] . The polyprotein is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into four structural proteins (nucleocapsid protein C, envelope glycoproteins E rns , E1 and E2) and eight nonstructural proteins (N pro , p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B). The availability of genetically defined and stable pestivirus BACs facilitates the functional study of viral proteins or RNA structures and also the development of new marker vaccine candidates. Several CSFV vaccines with marker properties based on chimeric pestiviruses have been developed over the years [14] . In particular, chimeric pestiviruses with substitution of the entire E2 protein have been described [15] [16] [17] but also mutants with more subtle modifications, such as the modification of the important TAV-epitope [18] within the CSFV-E2 protein [19, 20] are promising marker vaccine candidates.",

The use of homologous recombination allows site-directed mutagenesis of BACs [22] and, by employing a counterselection scheme, specific modifications can be obtained without leaving residual \"foreign\" sequences [23] . The main advantage of this method is that there are no target limitations (e.g. based on size or location) and no need for suitable restriction sites. The integration of the modified sequence is performed in vivo (within E. coli) thereby potentially being more accurate than in vitro approaches like PCR-based methods. Although in vitro cloning approaches based on the use of high-fidelity polymerases for PCR amplification have significantly improved in recent years, the use of in vivo approaches should allow a more accurate method of mutagenesis due to the use of the cells own high-fidelity replication system which includes proof reading. Whereas BAC recombination has been commonly used for modifying DNA viruses, there are only very few reports about the use of this technology for RNA viruses [7, 24, 25] .",

Samples (30 \u03bcl), from an E. coli culture containing pRedET and the parental BAC grown overnight at 30\u00b0C in LB media (Cam, Tet), were used to inoculate 1.4 ml of fresh LB media with the same antibiotics to obtain exponentially growing bacteria at 30\u00b0C. Red/ET recombination proteins were induced by adding 50 \u03bcl of 10% (w/v) L-arabinose (Sigma). The PCR product (200 ng) containing the rpsL-neo cassette was introduced into these bacteria using electroporation (as above). Following electroporation, the cells were grown at 37\u00b0C for 70 min (to allow recombination) and then selected on plates containing Cam (15 \u03bcg/ml), Tet (3 \u03bcg/ml) and kanamycin (Kan, 15 \u03bcg/ml) overnight at 30\u00b0C to maintain the pRedET.

Cells infected with either the vR26/P-12 or the chimeric vR26_E2gif/P-12 were each detected by the polyclonal anti-pestivirus serum as expected. The anti-CSFV-E2 mAb specifically detected cells infected with vR26/P-12 but not cells infected by the chimeric virus containing the BDV-E2 protein (consistent with the results shown in Figure 2 ). In contrast, the anti-BDV-E2 mAb specifically detected infection by the vR26_E2gif/P-12 and did not recognize cells infected with vR26/P-12. Each result is in accord with the structure of the viruses. The 4th passage of vR26 (vR26/P-4) displayed a slower growth rate than the virus obtained after 12 passages (see Figure 5A ). It also had a reduced growth rate compared to both the vR26_E2gif/P-4 and vR26_E2gif/P-12. The fulllength sequence of pBeloR26 had revealed ten non-silent mutations compared to the reference sequence (AY25 9122.1) for this virus (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). Any of these mutations could be responsible for the impaired growth acting alone or in concert. For further investigation of this issue, full length cDNAs prepared from vR26/ P-4, vR26/P-12, vR26_E2gif/P-4 and vR26_E2gif/P-12 were deep-sequenced using both the 454 FLX and Ion PGM platforms for comparison and to determine the quasispecies distribution (Additional file 3: Figure S1 and Additional file 4: Figure S2 ). Sequencing data from both platforms revealed that both the vR26/P-12 and vR26_E2gif/P-12 were close to 100% changed at nt position A10665G compared to the BAC clones (resulting in the predicted amino acid substitution D3431G within the NS5B protein, the RNAdependent RNA polymerase, see Figure 5B ). This adaptation is a reversion back to the consensus cDNA sequence of the parental vaccine virus, vRiemser (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). Additionally, vR26/P-4 and vR26_E2gif/P-4 already showed evidence for this reversion being present within the population. For vR26/P-4, the level of reversion was 57%, while for vR26_E2gif/P-4 the extent of change was 73% (see Figure 5B ).",

            "text": "In this study, we have established the first BAC containing the full-length cDNA of a CSFV vaccine strain. The BAC differed from the parental cDNA sequence in 18 positions leading to 9 aa substitutions ( Table 1 ). The method that has been used for the generation of pBeloR26 is based on full genome amplification of cDNA followed by direct cloning to obtain the BACs [11] . This approach results in cDNA clones that reflect the quasispecies composition of the parental viral RNA and thus it is not guaranteed to obtain cDNA clones corresponding to the consensus sequence of the cDNA used. However, it is possible to correct the mutations using the BAC recombination approach if a consensus clone is needed. To demonstrate the utility of the Red/ET mediated recombination method we have generated a series of modified BACs derived from this CSFV full-length cDNA. These include BACs with substitution of the linear TAV-epitope present in the E2 protein and also BACs with substitution of the complete E2 protein with heterologous pestivirus sequences. We have also used the same approach for a range of different targeted modifications within CSFV BACs including specific deletions and substitutions in the 5\u2032UTR of CSFV [24] and for insertions of heterologous reporter sequences into CSFV replicons [25] . Using Red/ET recombinationmediated mutagenesis for the targeted design, the work can be expedited and focused, in principal, on any sequence within the viral genome and is not dependent on the use of internal restriction sites. The results demonstrate that Red/ ET recombination-mediated mutagenesis of pestivirus BAC cDNAs provides a useful tool for advancing the construction of modified pestiviruses. Cells infected with the parental vR26 virus were recognized by the two anti-E2 mAbs (WH211 and WH303) specific for the CSFV-E2 proteins, in contrast cells infected with the modified viruses vR26_TAV and vR26_E2gif, rescued from the recombined BACs, were not detected by these mAbs. Furthermore, as expected, cells infected with the vR26_E2gif were recognized by the anti-BDV mAb (WB166) whereas no staining was observed with this antibody in vR26 infected cells or in cells with vR26_TAV. The mAb WH303 recognizes the CSFV TAV-epitope [18] and the difference in 4 aa between the TAV-epitope and the corresponding sequence from BDV strain \"Gifhorn\" is enough to completely abolish the recognition by this mAb. The lack of staining of vR26_TAV infected cells by the WH211 indicated that the TAV-sequence is also important for the epitope recognized by this mAb. Thus, the chimeric pestiviruses, vR26_TAV and vR26_E2gif, containing heterologous E2 sequences can be readily discriminated from the vR26 using specific anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies. These new chimeric pestiviruses represents Cstrain based marked vaccine candidates with the characteristics desired for safe and efficacious DIVA vaccines against CSFV. Indeed, vR26_E2gif vaccinated pigs could be efficiently discriminated from C-strain vaccinated pigs and from CSFV infected pigs using CSFV-E2 specific antibody ELISAs (Rasmussen et al., unpublished results).",

The same reversion to the consensus sequence for the \"Cstrain Riems\" virus was observed in two independent virus populations, derived from independent BACs, and indicates that this substitution is important for efficient growth of the \"C-strain Riems\" virus in SFT-R cells. In contrast, all other nucleotide positions remained unchanged during the extensive virus propagation including the heterologous E2 sequences ( Figure 5B) . The glycine (G) residue at position 3431 in the polyprotein is highly conserved amongst CSFV strains; indeed, alignment of CSFV sequences retrieved from GenBank did not reveal any variation at that position (data not shown). Whether this mutation was derived from the cloning procedure or reflects a low-level variant present in the parental vaccine stock is unclear.",

The system shows high genetic stability of the BAC constructs (within E. coli) and the chimeric viruses rescued from the BACs can be efficiently and stably propagated in SFT-R cells and this represents a suitable system for the production of virus stocks for future marked vaccine experiments. The strategies employed in this study have applicability not only for CSFV (and other pestiviruses) but should be adaptable to the study of other RNA viruses.",
