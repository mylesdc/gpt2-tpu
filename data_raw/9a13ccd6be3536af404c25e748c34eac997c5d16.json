Recently, we have demonstrated CFTR expression in the brain, the spinal cord and the sympathetic ganglia. This study aims to investigate the expression and distribution of CFTR in the ganglia of the human gastrointestinal tract. Fresh tissue and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded normal gastrointestinal tract samples were collected from eleven surgical patients and five autopsy cases. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, laserassisted microdissection and nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were performed. Expression of CFTR protein and mRNA was detected in neurons of the ganglia of all segments of the human gastrointestinal tract examined, including the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix, colon and rectum. The extensive expression of CFTR in the enteric ganglia suggests that CFTR may play a role in the physiology of the innervation of the gastro-intestinal tract. The presence of dysfunctional CFTRs in enteric ganglia could, to a certain extent, explain the gastrointestinal symptoms frequently experienced by CF patients.",

In these organs the malfunction of the mutated ion channel leads to fluid and electrolyte transportation disorders along with obstructed ducts, atrophic epithelia, gland hypertrophy and ultimately results in inflammation and fibrosis [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . CFTR was originally thought to be exclusively expressed by epithelial cells. However, recent studies have shown CFTR expression in neurons of the human central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord 14-18 . In addition, widespread presence of CFTR has been demonstrated in the peripheral nervous system, including human spinal, sympathetic and paracervical ganglia [14] [15] [16] 19, 20 . These findings suggest that CFTR plays a significant role in the physiology of the central and peripheral nervous system. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is regarded as the intrinsic nervous system of the tractus gastrointestinalis 21,22 . It is composed of two plexuses embedded in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract, i.e. the myenteric plexus and the submucosal plexus 21,22 . The ENS is connected to the central nervous system through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. It regulates motility, glandular secretions, fluid transport, and local blood flow, among others 21 . In addition to the tractus gastrointestinalis, the ENS also exists in the walls of the pancreas and biliary tract, but these organ systems were not investigated in the present study.",

The majority of these diseases are is causally related to the malfunction of the CFTR protein in the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas resulting in enzyme insufficiency and thickening of gastrointestinal secretions [25] [26] [27] [28] . However, given its crucial role in the control of motility, and exocrine and endocrine secretions in the tractus gastrointestionalis, it is conceivable that abnormalities in the ENS might also contribute to the pathogenesis of the gastrointestinal diseases found in CF. In this study, we aimed to investigate the distribution and expression of CFTR protein and mRNA in ganglion cells of the human ENS. Widespread expression of CFTR was demonstrated in the ENS, which could provide an additional explanation for the gastrointestinal symptoms in CF.",

The slides were then quickly fixed in 70% ethanol for 1 min, rinsed in DEPC-treated water for 30 s, stained with DEPC-treated hematoxylin for 1 min, and rinsed in DEPC-treated water (pH 8.0) twice for 30 s each time. All of the chemicals were prepared with DEPC-treated water. The ganglion cell groups were identified by their morphology, and were isolated from the frozen tissue sections using the Leica Microdissection System (Leica LMD 6000 B, Leica Microsystems). The microdissected target ganglia were then collected in an Eppendorf tube. Smooth muscle cell groups were captured and used to exclude the expression of CFTR in smooth muscle cells. Epithelial cell groups were also captured and used as positive controls. The procedure was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. RNA extraction was performed using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Cologne, Germany) to extract total RNA from the dissected ganglion cells. The reverse transcription was carried out with the Super Script III cDNA Kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 \u03bcg of total RNA was extracted from the dissected tissue and reverse transcription reactions were performed using random primers at 55 \u00b0C for 60 min.",

All the solutions used were prepared with diethyl-pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water to avoid mRNA degradation. The tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in gradient ethanol, incubated in 1 N HCl at room temperature for 10 min to increase permeability and washed in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The slides were heated to 96 \u00b0C in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 min 29 . After being cooled to room temperature, and rinsed in 0.01 M PBS, the slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed and dehydrated in 90% ethanol for 15 s, and hybridized overnight at 45 \u00b0C with the specific digoxigenin-labeled CFTR cRNA probe.

After blocking with normal horse serum (1:100) at room temperature for 1 hour, the sections were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody (1:500; Roche Diagnostics, Pensberg, Germany) for 1 hour. Nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-choloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP; Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.) was used to visualize the reaction staining, which resulted in a purple-blue signal. All slides were counterstained with methyl green. The slides were incubated with a corresponding sense probe or with hybridizing solutions only as negative controls. To identify the cell type that expressed CFTR mRNA, immunostaining with antibody to NF was performed on tissue sections consecutive to the ones on which CFTR in situ hybridization staining was performed. The NF immunostaining results were compared with the CFTR in situ hybridization results on consecutive sections to investigate whether CFTR mRNA positive cells were NF-positive neurons.",

In the tractus gastrointestinalis CFTR was found localized to the mucosal epithelial cells of the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon, with crypt cells expressing more CFTR than villus cells 34, 35 . However, in the years following the discovery of CFTR several other cell types were found to express CFTR, such as fibroblasts, neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells 36, 37 . In respect to the human nervous system, CFTR expression was detected in the hypothalamus 15 . Yet recent studies have demonstrated a more widespread expression of CFTR in both the central and peripheral nervous system, including various regions of the brain, as well as spinal, cerebellum, sympathetic ganglia, paracervical ganglia and trigeminal ganglion 17 patients with CF might be directly related to the loss of CFTR 40 . In the present study we investigated CFTR expression in the ganglia of the ENS in various segments of the human gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix, colon and rectum. The results of IHC, ISH and RT-PCR, all convincingly demonstrate the presence of CFTR mRNA and protein in both the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to CFTR and NF and in situ hybridization with a CFTR mRNA anti-sense probe on consecutive sections demonstrated that the cells expressing CFTR were NF-positive neurons. As the enteric ganglia are in close proximity to the mucosal epithelial cells, which abundantly express CFTR, LMD was performed prior to RT-PCR to isolate only neurons. Successful amplification of NF mRNA and lack of amplification of CK mRNA confirmed that neurons were captured, but not epithelial cells.",

Whether autonomic dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract frequently occurs in CF patients is not clear, as symptoms might be non-specific and accurate tests to determine abnormalities are not readily available 52 . The main etiological factors of autonomic neuropathy in CF are considered to be metabolic and nutritional 52 . Given the expression of CFTR in the ENS together with the previously established CFTR expression in the sympathetic ganglia and paracervical ganglia, it is conceivable that malfunction of CFTR in the ganglionic neurons also contributes to the occurrence of autonomic neuropathy in CF.",

Some of these manifestations have a direct causal relation to the malfunction of the CFTR in epithelial cells of gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, such as the distal intestinal obstruction syndrome and meconium ileus, whereas others, such as fibrosing colonopathy and gastritis, are regarded as secondary complications of the disease or its therapy 24 . As CFTR is responsible for anion transport 58, 59 , its dysfunction causes abnormal water and electrolyte secretion resulting not only in thick and adherent fluids in the intestines but also in the development of mucous and acidic enzyme secretions in the pancreas causing destruction of pancreatic tissue with ensuing exocrine pancreatic insufficiency leading on its turn to malabsorption in the gastrointestinal tract 57, 60 . In light of the regulatory role of the ENS in motility, water and electrolyte flow and endocrine secretions in the gastrointestinal tract 21 , it appears, however, not unlikely that ENS abnormalities caused by dysfunctional CFTR may also play a role in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal diseases in CF.",
