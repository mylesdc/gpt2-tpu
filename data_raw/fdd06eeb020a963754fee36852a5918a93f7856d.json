When compared with ACEIs, patients on thiazide diuretics were significantly more likely to be switchers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.49, 95% C.I. 1.31-1.69, p,0.001), whilst patients prescribed CCBs and beta-blockers were similarly likely to have switching.

It affects more than 65 million adult Americans, and data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2000 showed that 28.7% of people had hypertension [3, 4] . A recent study among 25, 196 urban adults aged 18-74 years in northeast of China showed the prevalence of elevated blood pressure was 40.5% [5] , which conferred increased cardiovascular risks [6] [7] . In addition, hypertension has also been evaluated as the most contributory component of metabolic syndrome in the association with ischemic heart disease in Taiwanese Type 2 Diabetic Patients [8] . Despite clinical consequences of uncontrolled hypertension as expressed in morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease and stroke being well recognized [2, 9, 10] , very small proportions of patients achieve control at less than 140/90 mmHg [11] . This problem is worse in countries belonging to the Asia Pacific region like China, where recent studies have found that only 3.5% of rural and 3.7% of urban hypertensive patients achieved optimal control [12, 13] . It has been estimated by the American Heart Association that the yearly direct and indirect costs of hypertension exceeded 93.5 billion in 2011, and together with stroke and cardiovascular diseases, accounts for 17% of the total healthcare expenditure per year in the US [14] .",

Thiazide diuretics were found to be significantly more likely to be switched 180 days after their prescriptions when compared with other antihypertensive drug classes [22] . However, these studies were not exclusively patients who could be considered members of inception cohorts, as patients who had already taken antihypertensive agents were included, and the study was restricted to one of seven regions of Hong Kong. Moreover, no blood pressure levels were available as a covariate in regression analyses, and we included patients who were all seen in public primary care settings. In addition, the follow-up period was restricted to a short period of 180 days. The objective of this study was to evaluate the longer-term switching rates according to drug classes among all Hong Kong residents, and it tested the a priori hypothesis that there existed differences in switching rates among the major antihypertensive drug classes as reported in our previous study [22] .",

Prescriptions can only be issued via the computerized system. Any hand-written amendments to drug prescriptions by physicians and those requiring the patients to purchase in community pharmacies are also entered into the computer system. These computerized records are the only conduits for information entry by physicians at every patient visit in all primary care clinics run by the HA. Clinical guidelines are provided to all physicians regarding the need to enter the diagnosis of the consultation in the form of ICPC-2 or ICD-10 codes.

Our recent studies among Chinese hypertensive patients, including both new and follow-up clinic visitors in the years 2004-2007 [23, 31] , showed that 5.7% had their medication switched which is compatible with the low switching rate in the current study.

In Hong Kong a new guideline on management of arterial hypertension drawing on international experience has been developed and recommendations on the choice of first-line agents are similar [35] . Subjects aged 50 years or older (in models unadjusted for blood pressure levels), male patients, residents in more rural areas and those with at least one comorbid condition affecting antihypertensive drug choice were more likely to be switchers. The influence of age on the tendency to switch medications has been discussed in a recent study where switching rates of beta-blockers increased markedly from 14% for those aged ,40 years to 30% for patients aged .75 years [16] . However, although most studies demonstrate that older patients adhere better to medication regimens than younger ones, these findings are inconsistent [36] [37] [38] [39] . Conflicting data exist about whether male or female patients adhere better to antihypertensive treatments, as well on as the region of residence [36, 40] .",

To the best of our knowledge this is the first evaluation of this scale which addressed the switching profiles of antihypertensive agents among Chinese patients in real clinical practice. However, there are limitations which should be mentioned. We do not know from our data the actual reasons why patients were switched. Changing clinics, patient-initiated requests for a different drug following pharmaceutical company promotional campaigns and marketing strategies targeted towards front-line physicians [16] may also play a role in antihypertensive drug switching in addition to the occurrence of adverse effects after initiation. Furthermore, some might argue that the availability of new medications in the classes of medications in the study period, physician bias on selection of prescriptions, the implementation of local guidelines, and inefficacy of the initial prescription might, and the presence of certain comorbidities like diabetes, renal diseases and other cardiovascular conditions also explain medication switching behaviors. Critics might also argue that in different clinics under the present study, the procedures and standard practice of measuring blood pressure might differ from each other. In addition, information on socioeconomic status is not usually available in large dataset studies, although this study consists of district of residence and receipt of public allowance as two proxy measures. Furthermore, this analysis also excluded a significant number of patients who visited the clinic only once, patients who died within 180 days after the initial prescription, stayed in the cohort for less than 180 days, or prescribed more than one antihypertensive agent. This might underestimate the real switching rate as they might be at higher risk of switching. Also, hypertensive patients in Hong Kong sometimes attend both the private and public sectors for antihypertensive medication refills, although more than 90% of hypertensive patients attended the public sector for management of hypertension. If switching occurred in the private sector this information would not be captured in the database used in this study, but all our research shows that older patients are unlikely to switch from public to private sectors for care of their non communicable diseases [41] .",

Reluctance to start antihypertensive drugs can lead to greater risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [42, 43] . However, physicians should be vigilant when considering prescribing antihypertensives for patients who have the associated factors identified in this study as predisposing to the need for switching medications.",
