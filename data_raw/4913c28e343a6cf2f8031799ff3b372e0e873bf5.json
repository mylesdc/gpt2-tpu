Patients infected by HCoV-NL63 are typically young children with upper and lower respiratory tract infection, presenting with symptoms including croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Unfortunately, there are currently no effective antiviral therapy to contain HCoV-NL63 infection. CoV genomes encode an integral viral component, main protease (M pro ), which is essential for viral replication through proteolytic processing of RNA replicase machinery. Due to the sequence and structural conservation among all CoVs, M pro has been recognized as an attractive molecular target for rational anti-CoV drug design. Here we present the crystal structure of HCoV-NL63 M pro in complex with a Michael acceptor inhibitor N3. Structural analysis, consistent with biochemical inhibition results, reveals the molecular mechanism of enzyme inhibition at the highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket. We show such molecular target remains unchanged across 30 clinical isolates of HCoV-NL63 strains. Through comparative study with M pro s from other human CoVs (including the deadly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and their related zoonotic CoVs, our structure of HCoV-NL63 M pro provides critical insight into rational development of wide spectrum antiviral therapeutics to treat infections caused by human CoVs.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a diverse group of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses in the family Coronaviridae 1,2 . CoVs have been identified in a wide variety of hosts, including mammals and birds, and are shown to cause a number of respiratory and enteric diseases 1,3,4 . In 2003, the global epidemic of an atypical form of pneumonia named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) led to the discovery of SARS-CoV, a previously unknown CoV, as the etiologic pathogen 5-8 . Started in South China, SARS outbreak quickly resulted in more than 800 deaths worldwide 9 . Patients with SARS-CoV infection developed diffuse alveolar damage with the potential to progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome and eventually death 10 . Almost 10 years later, another previously unknown CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was found to cause a new epidemic starting in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 [11] [12] [13] . MERS infection led to acute pneumonia and renal failure, with mortality rate as high as 50% in hospitalized patients 14, 15 . In addition to the deadly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 4 other human CoVs have been identified so far, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, which are known to cause comparatively mild common colds 9,16,17 . According to their genomic sequences, these 6 HCoVs are further classified into alphacoronavirus genus (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and betacoronavirus genus (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) 12,18 . The emergence of CoV infection in human beings are believed to begin with zoonotic transmission from animal reservoirs 9 . For example, high degree of genomic sequence similarity was shown between bovine CoV and HCoV-OC43, suggesting a relatively recent animal-to-human transmission 11, 19 . In the case of human SARS-CoV, recent studies identified several SARS-like bat CoVs with over 95% genomic sequence identity, suggesting bats as the potential zoonotic reservoir 20-22 . While dromedary camels are suspected to be either reservoir or vector for MERS, as genomic sequence of isolated dromedary MERS-CoV was found identical to that of human MERS-CoV 23-25 .",

Nevertheless, infections in adults have also been reported, though consequences could be more severe in those with compromised immune system or other comorbidities [40] [41] [42] . Similar to SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 also uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for cellular entry 43 . Full genome sequences of HCoV-NL63 have been determined, revealing a mosaic structure with multiple recombination sites which indicate that possible mutation and recombination could occur when co-infected with other CoVs 44,45 . Based on molecular clock analysis, HCoV-NL63 shares common ancestry with bat alphacoronavirus sequences, with probable divergence 563-822 years ago 46 .

From a public health perspective, no effective antiviral strategy is available in face of future CoV emergence, potentially transmitted from the vast and mutable zoonotic reservoir. Previously, we have demonstrated that main protease (M pro ) is a conserved drug target throughout the subfamily Coronavirinae, which is suitable for designing wide-spectrum inhibitors 48, 49 . The 5\u2032 two-thirds of coronaviral genome is consisted of open reading frame 1 (ORF1), which encodes two large polypeptides of the replicase machinery: pp1a, and through ribosomal frameshift, pp1ab 18 . These two polypeptides are cotranslationally cleaved into mature nonstructural proteins (Nsps) through two proteases encoded in the 5\u2032 region of ORF1: papain-like protease (PLP) and 3C-like protease (3CL or Nsp5) 50,51 . 3CL protease is more commonly known as M pro because of its dominant role in the posttranslational processing of the replicase polyprotein. The M pro s from different human and animal CoVs are known to share significant homology in both primary amino acid sequence and 3D architecture, providing a strong structural basis for designing wide-spectrum anti-CoV inhibitors 48,49,52-55 . They employ a similar substrate-binding pocket, usually with a requirement for glutamine at P1 position and a preference for leucine/methionine at P2 position. Interestingly, in contrast to other HCoVs, only HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 exhibit a unique substrate preference of histidine in P1 position at the cleavage site between nsp13 and nsp14 37,53 . The structural and pharmaceutical significance of the P1 position preference of HCoV-NL63 M pro remains to be addressed.",

The two molecules form a typical homodimer (Fig. 1a) , which has been observed in the crystal structures of other CoV M pro s 48, 52, 53 . Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of M pro homodimer in solution which is also the only active form of the enzyme [56] [57] [58] [59] , supporting the physiological relevance of structural findings. A structural comparison of protomer A in M pro -N3 complex with that in apo enzyme (PDB ID: 3TLO; C. P. Chuck & K. B. Wong, unpublished work) revealed an overall architecture of three domains (Fig. 1b) in each protomer, a common feature among CoV M pro structures. Domain I (residues 8-100) and domain II (residues 101-183) together form a chymotrypsin-like fold, and the substrate-binding site is located in a cleft formed between domain I and domain II. The catalytic dyad composed of Cys144 and His41 lies in the center of substrate-binding site. Domain III (residues 200-303) of HCoV-NL63 M pro is composed of a globular antiparallel \u03b1 -helical cluster, a unique feature of CoV M pro that is required for homodimer formation. Domain III is connected to domain II through a long loop region of 16 residues. X-ray data-processing and refinement statistics are included in Table 1 .",

It then undergoes nucleophilic attack by the active site Cys of the enzyme, leading to the formation of a stable covalent bond (E-I). This step is governed by the inactivation rate constant, k 3 . Using a CoV consensus substrate reported previously 48, 49, 53 , we first determined the values for K m and k cat of the apo enzyme of HCoV-NL63 M pro , as 50.8 \u00b1 3.4 \u03bcM and 0.098 \u00b1 0.004 s \u22121 , respectively ( Table 2) . Cross comparison with M pro s from other human CoVs revealed that the kinetic parameters of HCoV-NL63 M pro is relatively close to those for SARS-CoV (K m = 129 \u00b1 7 \u03bcM, k cat = 0.14 \u00b1 0.01 s \u22121 ) 49 . Rather K m of HCoV-NL63 is higher than that for HCoV-229E, while its k cat is approximately ten fold larger than those for HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1. We then added inhibitor N3 to the kinetic assay of HCoV-NL63 M pro , and calculated the K i and k 3 as 11.3 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcM and 42.4 \u00b1 5.0 (10 \u22123 \u2022s \u22121 ), respectively (Table 2) . Although the k i for HCoV-NL63 is higher compared with those for SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E, indicating a lower affinity of inhibitor N3 to the apo enzyme, its k 3 is significantly larger, which strongly supports the ability of N3 to achieve mechanism-based irreversible inhibition against HCoV-NL63 M pro .",

C\u03b2 of vinyl group on inhibitor N3 forms a standard 1.8 \u00c5 covalent bond with the S\u03b3 atom of Cys144, as evidenced by clear electron density (Fig. 2b) . This indicates that a Michael addition reaction occurred between N3 and the catalytic site Cys144. Compared with the apo enzyme, only one specific conformation is observed due to the formation of covalent bond while there exists a double conformation for S\u03b3 in the apo enzyme. The carbonyl oxygen of ester on N3 is very close to the backbone NH of Gly142 and the backbone of NH of Cys144 (Fig. 2c) , which mimics the tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate state formed during serine protease cleavage and provides additional support to anchor the Michael acceptor. The benzyl ester part of N3 further extends into the S1' pocket, forming Van der Waals interaction with Val26 and Leu27 (Fig. 2b) .",

This feature is unique only in genomes of HCoV-NL63 (NC_005831) and HCoV-HKU1 (NC_006577). In contrast, glutamine is the exclusive residue in P1 among all cleavage sites for the other four human CoVs, including HCoV-229E (NC_002645), HCoV-OC43 (NC_005147), SARS-CoV (NC_004718), and MERS-CoV (JX869059). Such novel substrate specificity at P1 in HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 implies unique structural feature of S1 subpocket. The crystal structure of HCoV-NL63 M pro shows that the size of its S1 pocket is comparable to that of HCoV-HKU1, but smaller than those of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV. Clearly, a smaller S1 pocket in HCoV-NL63 could better accommodate the smaller side chain of histidine residue at P1 of nsp13-nsp14, and facilitate cleavage when weakened oxyanion hole is formed.",

Furthermore, the NH of N3 lactam ring forms two hydrogen bonds with O\u03b5 1 of Glu166 (3.1 \u00c5) and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Phe139 (3.2 \u00c5) respectively, which provide additional support to stabilize the lactam ring in S1 pocket.

The P2 position of natural M pro cleavage sites across of the genomes of six human CoVs usually prefers a hydrophobic residue (Table 3 ). It is surprising that the P2 residues are completely identical among all 11 cleavage sites between the two alphacoronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. In a majority of cases, it is leucine residue occupying the P2 position, with valine at nsp6-nsp7 and isoleucine at nsp10-nsp11. On the other hand, more variations are observed in the P2 position among betacoronaviruses, with more alternative residues such as methionine, phenylalanine, and proline, which might indicate less stringency of P2 specificity. The P2 site of inhibitor N3 mimics the side chain of leucine, in order to cover the maximum spectrum of natural M pro substrates for human CoVs 49 . As observed in the HCoV-NL63 structure with N3, the aliphatic isobutyl side chain of P2 protrudes into the deep S2 pocket via interactions with the alkyl portion of the side chains of Asp187, Pro189, and is well accommodated onto the Van der Waals surface of the pocket (Fig. 2b) . To determine the structural diversity in S2 pocket, we then superimposed the backbones of four know M pro structures from human CoVs.

Overall, M pro is extremely conserved among clinical HCoV-NL63 strains isolated worldwide ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), evidencing the enzyme's essential role in viral replication. Sequence variation is only observed in 3 residues: His69 is mutated to Tyr in 13 strains isolated from United States, Cys221 is mutated to Arg among all the strains that have not been cultured in vitro, and Met235 is mutated to Ile in only one strain isolated in United States (Fig. 5a) . When plotted onto the structure of HCoV-NL63 M pro , these 3 residues are all located in flexible regions, such as loop and molecular surface (Fig. 5b) . None of the 3 residues are directly interacting with inhibitor N3, which provides clear structural evidence to support the effectiveness of N3 against all the clinical strains of HCoV-NL63, in spite of significant genomic sequence variation and potential for recombination in viral transmission.",

Given the evidence of repetitive global epidemics (such as SARS and MERS) caused by zoonotic transmission 11, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , it is imperative to examine whether the substrate-binding site and the inhibition mechanism employed by inhibitor N3 are conserved between known human CoVs and their related zoonotic CoVs. We chose three most representative pairs of human CoVs and their zoonotic counterparts: HCoV-229E (NC_002645) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV, NC_003045), SARS-CoV (NC_004718) and SARS-related CoV isolated from bat (BtSARSr-CoV, KC881006), MERS-CoV (JX869059) and dromedary camel MERS-CoV (DcMERS-CoV, KJ713296). We then retrieved their M pro sequences from NCBI database. The direct bat ancestor of HCoV-NL63 has not been identified 47 , therefore we only use HCoV-NL63 M pro sequence and its secondary structure presented in this study as reference. Sequence alignment, shown in Fig. 6a , demonstrates significant homology in primary amino acid sequence among these 7 CoVs. A closer examination at the substrate-binding pocket further reveals a conservative 3D architecture at this drug target (Fig. 6b) . Those residues, which are critical for pocket formation, such as Leu27, Gly142 for pocket S1'; Phe139, His163, Glu166, His172 for pocket S1; His41, Tyr53, Asp187 for pocket S2; Leu167, Gln192 for pocket S4, are strictly conserved among various CoVs (Fig. 6a,b) . Peptidomimetic inhibitor N3, through its Michael acceptor and well-designed side chains, snugly fits into the conserved substrate-binding pocket. The binding of N3 establishes a concerted interaction network, including a 1.8-\u00c5 covalent bond between C\u03b2 of vinyl group on inhibitor N3 and the S\u03b3 atom of Cys144, 7 hydrogen bonds and extensive hydrophobic interactions between N3 and the above residues critical for interplay. These findings demonstrate that inhibitor N3 could exert inhibitory effect towards a conserved site in CoVs both before and after zoonotic transmission. Therefore, in addition to its role in inhibiting known circulating human CoV species, inhibitor N3 might also serve as a lead compound for preclinical and clinical testing against potential future epidemic caused by CoV emerging from zoonotic origin.

            "text": "The world has experienced two global outbreaks of CoV infections since entering the 21 st century [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [11] [12] [13] . Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause severe respiratory syndrome with high mortality rate 10, 14, 15 . In addition, four more human CoVs, namely HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43, have been identified as pathological agents for common cold 9, 16, 17 . The lack of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies against human CoVs calls for immediate action of the scientific community 9, 50 . We previously demonstrated that designing wide spectrum inhibitor at a conservative target is a viable method to develop anti-CoV therapeutics, given the high mutation and recombination rates observed in viral replication 48, 49, 51, 53 . The ability of CoV to cross animal-human boundary provides further support to our strategy. Indeed, several human CoVs, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, have been linked to zoonotic CoVs which naturally infect hosts such as bats or dromedary camels [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] 46 . In current study, we use the M pro from HCoV-NL63 as our model molecule, and present its crystal structure in complex with an inhibitor. Based on the structural detail at 2.85 \u00c5 resolution, the substrate-binding pocket of HCoV-NL63 M pro is conserved among three pairs of human and zoonotic CoVs (Fig. 6) . Several key residues at the subsites for substrate binding are completely identical among these seven coronaviruses, for example Phe139, His163, Glu166, His172 of S1; His41, Tyr53, Asp187 of S2; and Leu167, Gln192 of S4. These findings are consistent with the role of M pro in viral replication, which is essential to the proteolytic processing and maturation of replicase polyprotein (encoded by ORF1). Analysis of substrate recognition sequence, based on available whole genome sequences of all six human CoVs, provides additional evidence to the conservation of M pro substrate-binding pocket: the P1 position requires almost exclusively glutamine, and the P2 position exhibits strong preference for hydrophobic residues such as Leu and Val (Table 3) . Taken together, through designing of wide spectrum inhibitors at a conservative site on M pro , our study outlines a novel therapeutic approach of containing diseases caused by both existing and possible future emerging human CoVs.",

            "text": "A close examination of the interaction between HCoV-NL63 M pro and inhibitor N3 reveals structural details of inhibition mechanism. N3 is a synthetic peptidomimetic compound with Michael acceptor (Fig. 2a) , which achieves mechanism-based enzyme inactivation through forming an irreversible covalent bond with Cys144 of catalytic dyad (Fig. 2b,c) . The success of two serine protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has underscored the importance of covalent inhibitors for targeting viral proteases 62 . Both telaprevir and boceprevir are peptidomimetic inhibitors carry a warhead of \u03b1 -ketoamide, which forms a covalent yet reversible bond with catalytic triad serine residue of HCV NS3\u20224 A protease 62, 63 . Michael acceptor has also been used as a warhead in pharmaceutical targeting against viral protease, for example rupintrivir was developed as an inhibitor for 3C protease of human rhinovirus and enterovirus 50, 64, 65 . The backbone of N3 forms 7 hydrogen bonds with residues in the substrate-binding pocket (Fig. 2c) . The pockets accommodating N3 undergo gate-regulated switch to facilitate the binding of inhibitor N3 (Fig. 3) , an interesting phenomena initially observed in case of M pro from SARS-CoV 49 . In addition, the structure of HCoV-NL63 M pro exhibits several unique but interesting features. Examination of its natural cleavage sites based on HCoV-NL63 genomic sequence reveals an unusual histidine P1 residue between nsp13 and nsp14, which is unique to HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 among all human CoVs 37 . Such P1 anomaly is partially accommodated by the relatively smaller S1 pocket, as the size of its S1 pocket is comparable to that of HCoV-HKU1, but smaller than those of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV. The P2 position seems to present genus specificity among alphacoronaviruses, as the P2 residues among all 11 natural cleavage sites are completely HCoV-NL63 and its secondary structure are used as reference for the alignment. Sequence alignment was performed using ClustalW2 72 , and figure was generated using ESPript 3.0 73 . (b) Surface representation of conserved substrate-binding pockets from 7 CoV M pro s listed in (a). Background is HCoV-NL63 M pro . Red: identical residues among all seven CoV M pro ; magenta: substitution in one CoV M pro ; orange: substitution in two CoV M pro s. The residues forming the substratebinding pocket are labeled.
