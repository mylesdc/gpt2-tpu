An information coefficient was computed for determining the similarity between the two information sources as a criterion to locate primer-annealing sites, and predict products.

More than 80% of the predicted products had counterparts in the laboratory PCR results. VPCR predicted only 2 products for each of the gene families and gave more than 8 unspecific products in each case. Although Lexa We used the universal primer pair P0 and P6 [11] to predict 16S rRNA genes from 59 completed bacterial genomes. We correctly located all copies of 16S rRNA genes from 52 of the tested genomes with all threshold parameters at 0.85. Predictions for three strains yielded 1 or 2 unspecific products, which were eliminated when the threshold parameters were increased to 0.86 or 0.9. Discrepancies between SPCR prediction and GenBank data for three strains were found to be a result of incorrect annotation of the data. In only one strain was an unspecific product found that was longer than the expected gene copy.",

Sequence similarity between primer and template is the primary factor for selecting annealing sites. In this work we developed a new algorithm to assess the similarity between primer and template after the base sequences were converted into vectors of hydrogen bond numbers. We consider annealing of primer to template a means of information transfer. The hydrogen bond number vector for the primer is the source information, while the vector for template is the target information. The difference between the two information sources is a reflection of the fidelity of this information transfer process. Since hydrogen bonds are formed as a result of specific base recognition between the two DNA strands and the total number of hydrogen bonds is also a major force holding the two strands together, the similarity between these two information sources may be a good estimate of the probability of both annealing site selection and annealed structure stability. The information coefficient calculated in this work is a measure of similarity between two information sources. The value varies between 0-1, reflecting complete difference to 100% identity. In the SPCR program, the threshold can be increased to reduce expected products, which is comparable to increasing annealing temperature to reduce unspecific products in laboratory PCR. In contrast to BLAST, this algorithm tolerates any type of mismatch between primer and template. The successful prediction of all copies of 16S rRNA genes in complete",
