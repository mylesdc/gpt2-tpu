            "text": "During a lytic gammaherpesvirus infection, host gene expression is severely restricted by the global degradation and altered 39 end processing of mRNA. This host shutoff phenotype is orchestrated by the viral SOX protein, yet its functional significance to the viral lifecycle has not been elucidated, in part due to the multifunctional nature of SOX. Using an unbiased mutagenesis screen of the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) SOX homolog, we isolated a single amino acid point mutant that is selectively defective in host shutoff activity. Incorporation of this mutation into MHV68 yielded a virus with significantly reduced capacity for mRNA turnover. Unexpectedly, the MHV68 mutant showed little defect during the acute replication phase in the mouse lung. Instead, the virus exhibited attenuation at later stages of in vivo infections suggestive of defects in both trafficking and latency establishment. Specifically, mice intranasally infected with the host shutoff mutant accumulated to lower levels at 10 days post infection in the lymph nodes, failed to develop splenomegaly, and exhibited reduced viral DNA levels and a lower frequency of latently infected splenocytes. Decreased latency establishment was also observed upon infection via the intraperitoneal route. These results highlight for the first time the importance of global mRNA degradation during a gammaherpesvirus infection and link an exclusively lytic phenomenon with downstream latency establishment.",

For certain viruses this host shutoff activity is a consequence of viral gene expression strategies, such as influenzavirus cap snatching [5] or picornavirus translation factor cleavage to facilitate alternate mechanisms of ribosome engagement [6] . For others, the contribution of host shutoff towards viral replication and gene expression is not as apparent, although proposed roles include resource reallocation and immune evasion [6, 7] . In many cases, the precise in vivo function has been difficult to delineate, in part due to the multifunctional nature of the viral proteins driving host shutoff and the lack of appropriate model systems. Within this latter category are the gammaherpesviruses, which direct host shutoff primarily through the induction of host mRNA degradation.",

The related murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is often used as a model for human gammaherpesviruses because, unlike KSHV and EBV, it is genetically tractable, readily replicates in tissue culture without the use of chemicals or overexpression to overcome latency, and infects small rodents including laboratory mice [9, 10, 11] . MHV68 has therefore been instrumental in the identification of factors that contribute to in vivo replication and pathogenesis of the gammaherpesviruses.",

In the latent state few viral genes are expressed, and the viral genome is maintained in the nucleus of the host cell until stimulating signals induce lytic reactivation [12, 13, 14] . Most gammaherpesvirus-induced diseases are associated with latency. During the lytic cycle the vast majority of viral genes are expressed, and the virus undergoes active replication to produce progeny virions. At this stage during productive replication, gammaherpesviruses induce global mRNA degradation via the product of the alkaline exonuclease gene, termed SOX in KSHV, muSOX (ORF37) in MHV68, and BGLF5 in EBV [1, 15, 16] . SOX and its homologs are conserved in all subfamilies of herpesviruses, where they were first identified as DNA exonucleases critical for the resolution of branched structures that arise during viral DNA replication [17, 18, 19, 20] .",

Although the precise mechanism by which these proteins cause mRNA degradation remains unclear, biochemical evidence suggests that at least EBV BGLF5 and KSHV SOX possess some intrinsic ribonuclease (RNase) activity in vitro [21, 22] . In addition to mRNA turnover, SOX promotes the nuclear relocalization of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC), which leads to aberrant polyadenylation and nuclear retention of mRNAs [23, 24] . The failure to repopulate the cytoplasm with newly transcribed mRNAs is thought to increase the overall magnitude of the host gene expression blockade [23] .",

Previous studies found the DNase and host shutoff functions of SOX and BGLF5 to be genetically separable [25, 26] , making it possible to evaluate the role of each function of the protein in isolation. We report herein the identification of a functionally similar MHV68 muSOX point mutant that renders the virus selectively defective for host shutoff, enabling the analysis of the role of this phenotype during infection of cultured cells and in vivo. The mutant virus exhibited little to no defect during multi-step growth curves in tissue culture or during acute replication in the mouse lung following intranasal inoculation. Unexpectedly, the virus accumulated to significantly reduced levels in the lymph nodes at 10 days post infection and was highly attenuated at the downstream stage of latency establishment. Once trafficking was bypassed via an intraperitoneal infection, the host shutoff defective virus still was attenuated in establishing latency in the spleen. Our results identify for the first time a key role for the lytic mRNA turnover activity in establishing viral latency, emphasizing the important interplay between these seemingly disparate stages of the viral lifecycle.",

Briefly, the muSOX gene was amplified by error-prone PCR under conditions designed to introduce 1-4 mutations per gene. The PCR product was then cloned into a mammalian expression vector, and clones were screened for the ability to repress expression of a GFP reporter in a fluorescence-based assay in 293T cells. Mutants that did not deplete GFP fluorescence were categorized as host shutoff defective and further analyzed for wildtype protein expression levels by Western blotting, as even minor changes to the muSOX primary amino acid sequence often significantly reduced its protein expression. Finally, candidate mutants were tested for retention of DNase activity using an in vitro assay established previously for SOX and BGLF5 [25, 26] . After screening approximately 150 candidates, we identified a clone that lacked mRNA degradation activity of the GFP reporter, but retained wild-type protein expression levels and DNase activity. Sequencing revealed this clone to have only a single non-silent mutation, the amino acid substitution R443M, which we modified to R443I for purposes of screening by restriction digest. MuSOX R443I failed to suppress GFP protein expression in the fluorescent-based assay for host shutoff ( Figure 1B) , which was a consequence of its inability to degrade GFP mRNA ( Figure 1C ). R443I is expressed at slightly higher levels than wild-type (WT) muSOX ( Figure 1D ), as expected of a mutant that cannot promote turnover of its own mRNA. Importantly, WT and R443I muSOX both degrade linear DNA with very similar kinetics ( Figure 1E ). We conclude that the amino acid substitution R443I produces a single-function muSOX mutant selectively defective for host shutoff activity.",

We also generated a mutant rescue (MR) virus by replacing the R443I mutant with WT muSOX to ensure that any observed phenotypes could be attributed to the R443I mutation rather than to unexpected secondary mutations elsewhere in the viral genome. Restriction digests with PsiI and EcoRI confirmed that both recombinant viruses were successfully isolated and did not have any unexpected recombination events ( Figures 2B & 2C) .

They exhibit a biphasic lifecycle comprised of a lytic replicative stage and a relatively dormant latent stage. Members of the gammaherpesvirus subfamily include the human pathogens Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, the etiologic agents of some of the most common AIDS-associated malignancies. During a lytic gammaherpesvirus infection, cellular gene expression is severely compromised in a process termed host shutoff. In this study, we address the purpose of this activity in the viral lifecycle through the generation of a single amino acid point mutant selectively defective for host shutoff activity. Unexpectedly, host shutoff appears largely dispensable for viral replication, yet plays an important role in the ability of the virus to traffic and establish latency in the host organism. These findings link two distinct phases of the viral lifecycle and indicate that the global manipulation of gene expression may contribute to the establishment of a lifelong gammaherpesvirus infection. and MR infections reduced endogenous b-actin (actB), tubulin-b (tubb5), rplp2, and gapdh mRNA levels to 20-40% of the mock infected sample. In contrast, mRNA levels remained significantly higher in MHV68.DHS infected cells ( Figure 3A-3D) . Thus, the single amino acid change R443I in muSOX is sufficient to suppress virus-induced endogenous mRNA turnover. The somewhat lower endogenous mRNA levels in MHV68.DHS compared to mock infected cells could be due either to incomplete inactivation of the muSOX host shutoff function, or to the contribution of one or more additional viral genes towards host shutoff.",

To quantify these differences, we measured 75 plaques from 5 independent MHV68.DHS and MHV68.MR infections and found that, indeed, MHV68.DHS plaques were generally larger (p-value ,0.01) and had a broader frequency distribution ( Figure 5B ). This seemed unlikely to be a consequence of more rapid lytic replication, given the above growth curve results. In addition, the altered plaque size does not appear to be caused by enhanced cell-to-cell spread of the mutant virus, as we observed no significant differences in the ratio of extracellular to intracellular virus produced in 3T3 cells infected with MHV68.WT, MHV68.DHS, and MHV68.MR (data not shown).",

            "text": "We and others have consistently observed that plaques formed upon infection with wild-type (or mutant rescue) MHV68 are often quite heterogeneous in size. One possible explanation for this is asynchronous entry into the lytic cycle, in which smaller plaques arise from later entry into the lytic cycle. In this regard, we sought to determine whether the large plaque phenotype of MHV68.DHS might be due to enhanced entry into the lytic cycle, signified by an increased percentage of infected cells expressing early lytic proteins relative to the wild-type virus. To test this hypothesis, we acquired a version of MHV68 (MHV68-YFP) which constitutively expresses YFP from a CMV promoter, regardless of whether infected cells are in the lytic or latent phase [29] . Thus, YFP expression serves as a general marker of infection, whereas lytically infected cells are identified by immunofluorescence-based detection of the early lytic protein muSOX. NIH 3T3 cells were infected at an MOI of 1 with either MHV68-YFP or a version of MHV68-YFP bearing the muSOX R443I mutation (MHV68-YFP.DHS), and the percentage of cells co-expressing muSOX and YFP was calculated at 18 hours post infection. A similar number of YFP-expressing cells were detected in cultures infected with MHV68-YFP and MHV68-YFP.DHS, indicating equivalent efficiency of initial infection ( Figure 5C & data not shown). However, there was an approximately three-fold increase in the percent of cells coexpressing both YFP and muSOX following infection with MHV68-YFP.DHS compared to MHV68-YFP (30.1% versus 11.0%; Figure 5C ). A similar trend was observed when the YFPand muSOX-expressing cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry following infection with these viruses ( Figure S1 ). Also in agreement with these findings were increased levels of the viral ORF54 transcript following a MHV68.DHS infection relative to MHV68.WT or MHV68.MR ( Figure S2 ). Thus, enhanced and/ or more rapid expression of lytic genes occurs in cells infected with MHV68.DHS, perhaps escalating entry into the lytic cycle and leading to larger plaques.",

We first measured necrosis by quantifying levels of lactate dehydrogenase released into the media at 16 hpi, but detected no measurable release following infection with any of the viruses ( Figure  S3A ). We next monitored apoptosis by several assays, including measuring caspase activity, and testing for loss of plasma membrane symmetry and increased membrane permeability. While there was a slight, but statistically significant, increase in caspase 3/7 activity following MHV68.DHS infection relative to MHV68.WT or MHV68.MR infection, in all three cases the level was below that observed in mock infected cells ( Figure S3B ), making it unlikely that this is a primary cause of the increased plaque size. Plasma membrane asymmetry was monitored using PE-conjugated Annexin V, which binds to a component of the plasma membrane normally found on the cytoplasmic surface, and membrane permeability was quantified by the nucleotide binding dye 7-Amino-Actinomycin (7-AAD). By flow cytometry we detected no significant increase in Annexin V binding or 7-AAD staining following infection with either MHV68.DHS or MHV8.MR relative to the uninfected control ( Figure S3C ).

Viral titers were equivalent at 3 dpi for all three viruses, and at 5 and 7 dpi we observed only a very modest 2-3 fold defect in MHV68.DHS relative to MHV68.MR accumulation ( Figure 6 ). Although MHV68.WT reached higher titers than MHV68.MR at 5 dpi, the two viruses accumulated to equivalent levels at all earlier and later timepoints (see subsequent sections). To ensure MHV68.DHS had not reverted back to WT or incorporated any compensatory mutations, we sequenced the muSOX gene from infected lung homogenate but found no changes.

            "text": "All gammaherpesviruses studied to date block host gene expression through widespread mRNA degradation, yet the contribution of this function towards the viral lifecycle remained unknown. Here we analyzed the impact of host shutoff both in tissue culture and in vivo infections with the murine gammaherpesvirus MHV68, and we found this activity to be largely dispensable for acute lytic replication yet critical for the downstream viral accumulation in the lymph nodes and subsequent establishment of latency in the spleen. These results were unexpected given that MHV68-induced host shutoff is executed by muSOX, a viral protein whose expression has only been detected during the lytic cycle [38, 39, 40] . In addition, the role for muSOX-induced mRNA turnover clearly diverges from that of the alphaherpesvirus host shutoff factor vhs, which similarly induces global mRNA degradation but plays a critical role during acute replication in vivo [41, 42, 43] . The severe attenuation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 vhs mutants is hypothesized to be a consequence of ineffective immune evasion, as vhs blocks dendritic cell activation and down-regulates the type I interferon response [44, 45, 46] . In contrast, we find little difference between MHV68.MR and MHV68.DHS during acute replication in mice, suggesting that while alpha-and gammaherpesviruses block host gene expression via analogous mechanisms, the functional ramifications of this activity are distinct, and may relate to the unique in vivo biology of each class of virus.",

Although SOX, BGLF5, and muSOX are functionally homologous and likely induce mRNA degradation through a similar mechanism, the identified amino acid mutations that selectively remove host shutoff activity are not conserved, nor are they positioned in the same three-dimensional region. Likely these different mutations alter the local structure of each protein thereby inhibiting or weakening the mRNA or co-factor interactions which contribute to overall mRNA degradation. In this regard, we anticipate that the residual host shutoff activity observed upon infection with the MHV68.DHS virus is at least partially due to incomplete inactivation of muSOX mRNA turnover activity by the R443I mutation.",

Our failure to detect a significant replication defect for MHV68.DHS during a multi-step growth curve in cultured murine fibroblasts or in the mouse lung implies that resource reallocation is unlikely to be the primary role for muSOX-induced mRNA depletion. Likewise, the similar viral titers in the lungs of mice infected with MHV68.MR or MHV68.DHS argues against a role for muSOX in the general suppression of host innate immune responses Because MHV68.DHS still retains residual mRNA degradation activity, it is possible that some degree of host shutoff could be important for viral replication. However, the appearance of significant defects in downstream viral events even with a partial host shutoff defect further strengthens our conclusion that host shutoff plays a vital role in the lifecycle and pathogenesis of MHV68 in vivo.",

            "text": "The first major defect observed in an in vivo MHV68.DHS infection is significantly lower levels of the virus in the lymph nodes at 10 dpi. Following an intranasal infection, wild-type MHV68 undergoes lytic replication in the lung and upper respiratory track, after which the virus drains to the lymph nodes and spleen where a variety of cell types are infected, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and B-cells [37, 50, 51, 52] . A burst of lytic replication occurs at these sites [30, 32] , after which replicating virus is cleared and long-term latency is established. Lower levels of MHV68.DHS in the lymph node could be caused by a cell-type specific role for muSOX-dependent mRNA degradation in viral replication or immune evasion during viral transport to, and maintenance in, the lymphatic tissue. The observation that the EBV muSOX homolog (BGLF5) down-regulates HLA class I molecules and CD8 + T cell recognition in cultured cells may support this model [25] . The means by which the virus traffics to the sites of latency establishment remain unclear, yet it is likely that latently infected B cells carry the virus given that viremia is undetectable during an infection, and latently infected B cells are present in the lung very early after infection [37, 53, 54] . A failure of MHV68.DHS to establish latency in these cells might also cause their selective immune-based eradication and decreased accumulation in the lymph nodes. Alternatively, muSOX could influence the ability of the virus to reactivate from latency, as this process has been linked to efficient latency establishment. Mutations in a number of genes alter the frequency of lytic reactivation and lead to lower levels of latency establishment following an intranasal infection, such as vcyclin (ORF72) [55] , M1 [56] , M2 [57, 58] , and LANA (ORF73) [59, 60] , but unlike muSOX these genes are all expressed during latency as well as during lytic replication [61] . Mutations in the lytic ORF36 gene encoding a protein kinase also lead to defects in latency establishment and reactivation [62, 63] , which have been tracked to the requirement for ORF36 to inhibit the IRF-3 mediated type I interferon response [62] and its modification of the DNA-damage response protein H2AX [63] . Experiments are currently underway to examine MHV68.DHS replication, reactivation, and latency establishment in specific cell types relevant to in vivo infection.",

This defect could arise simply as a downstream consequence of the aforementioned impairment in trafficking. However, significantly reduced levels of viral DNA are detected in the spleen even after an intraperitoneal infection, which bypasses the need for acute replication in the lung and subsequent trafficking through the lymph nodes [37] . Thus, MHV68.DHS appears defective in both trafficking and latency establishment in the spleen. Such a phenotype might occur if MHV68.DHS-infected cells preferentially entered the lytic cycle, perhaps enabling more efficient clearance by the immune system. This model is supported by our observation that an increased percentage of cultured 3T3 cells infected with MHV68.DHS express lytic markers relative to those infected with MHV68.WT. However, if this represents enhanced entry into the lytic cycle, there must be a downstream defect that tempers subsequent viral output, as the host shutoff mutant virus does not replicate to higher titers in 3T3 cells than the wild-type virus. In this regard, host shutoff could be important for optimizing the balance of host or viral proteins in an infected cell, as has been reported in an EBV mutant lacking BGLF5, where altered levels of proteins inhibited viral maturation and egress [64] . One mechanism that could shift the balance of infection away from latency is if muSOX down-regulates factors that inhibit latency establishment; such negative regulators would then accumulate in the presence of the R443I mutant, driving cells into lytic replication. MuSOX activity may also be required for the virus to achieve the appropriate level of host and or viral factors packaged into the viral particle in order to efficiently establish latency in newly infected cells rather than enter the lytic cycle.",

Also similar to MHV68.DHS, these viruses replicate to near wild-type levels in the lung but establish latency at lower levels in the spleen. The constitutive RTA-expressing viruses have been found to efficiently traffic to the spleen but fail to be maintained at this site [66] . This attenuation has been ascribed to the viruses producing excessive amounts of the RTA-inducible lytic genes, creating an intracellular environment favoring immediate entry into the lytic cycle rather than entering latency. Thus, during an infection, an important role for muSOX may be to ensure that factors driving lytic replication are not overrepresented. While it is tempting to speculate a connection between the increased percentage of lytically infected 3T3 cells and the latency establishment defect in vivo with MHV68.DHS, at present the precise relationship between these observations remains unclear.",

To generate the MHV68.DHS BAC, a targeting region consisting of 566 nt upstream and 568 nt downstream of the mutation site was ligated into pGS284 between BglII and NotI restriction sites and electroporated into the S17lpir strain of E. coli. The MHV68-YFP BAC infectious clone was a generous gift from Dr. Samuel Speck (Emory University) [29] , and MHV68-YFP.DHS was generated using the same methodology as MHV68.DHS. The targeting vector for the mutant rescue BAC (MHV68.MR) was generated by ligating the region around wild-type muSOX into pGS284. Targeting vector-containing cells were cross-streaked with BACcontaining GS500 cells and successful recombinants were identified by colony PCR and subsequent digest with PsiI. BAC DNA was isolated from positive clones using the Qiagen Large-Construct kit (Qiagen). BAC variants were verified by restriction digests with EcoRI and PsiI and sequencing of the region surrounding the recombination site. BAC-derived MHV68 virus was produced by transfecting 2 mg of BAC DNA into NIH 3T3 cells using SuperFect (Qiagen). Virus was then amplified in NIH 3T12 cells and titered by plaque assays on NIH 3T3 cells. Before infecting mice, the loxP-flanked BAC vector sequence was removed from the recombinant viruses by passaging the virus over Vero cells expressing Cre recombinase (kindly provided by Dr. Samuel Speck, Emory University) [59] , and BAC removal was confirmed by PCR analysis.",
