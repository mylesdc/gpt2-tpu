Similar to study, several others have found a significant association between the age of less than 6 months and a higher risk of hospitalization and severe bronchiolitis. [15] [16] [17] [18] However, Grimwood et al did not find a significant correlation between children aged less than 2 months and bronchiolitis severity in a multivariate analysis. 19 Hospitalization rates that are attributable to RSV bronchiolitis are usually the highest between 30 and 90 days after birth. 20 This age coincides with the declining concentration of transplacentally acquired maternal anti-RSV immunoglobulin, which protects infants against disease. 20, 21 Certain studies have shown that prematurity is independently associated with more severe bronchiolitis, 15, 16, 22 while the others have not found significantly higher rates of hospitalization and severe bronchiolitis among premature compared to full-term infants. 17, 20, 23 In the present study, the proportion of preterm children was highest in the PICU group and lowest in the PED group, which suggested a more severe bronchiolitis. However, multiple logistic regression model did not show a correlation between prematurity and In the present study, antibiotic treatment was significantly associated with severe bronchiolitis, which is in accordance with some previous reports. 24, 25 Although the design of our study did not enable analysis of the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy, the finding that almost all patients in the PICU group received antibiotic treatment compared to only 3.6% in the PED group might suggest that bacterial superinfections lead to a more severe course of bronchiolitis.",

            "text": "The present study showed that RSV, hRV and hBoV were the most frequently present viruses in nasopharyngeal swab of children with bronchiolitis. The predominance of RSV is in agreement with several previous reports. 3, 5, 32 The second most common pathogen is usually hRV, followed by InfV or PIV 5, 19, 33 while in our study hBoV ranked the third. Some reports indicated that hBoV is rarely detected as a single agent in hospitalized children with bronchiolitis, leading to speculation that this virus is more likely to be an innocent bystander than a true pathogen. 5 However, Ur\u0161i\u010d et al have recently reported the first fatal case of an extremely severe bronchiolitis caused by hBoV in an immunocompetent child. 16 The absence of association between virus type and characteristics of patients is in agreement with the findings of several previous articles. 6, 17, 18 Nevertheless, in some reports, differences in the severity of the disease caused by various types of viruses or viral co-infections were established. 1, 34, 35 According to our study, multiple viruses detected in the nasopharyngeal swab were moderately associated with a more severe course of the bronchiolitis, although not significant (P = 0.091). Other studies proved that children with viral coinfection were less likely to be admitted to intensive care unit than children with single virus infection. 21, 22 Possible explanation is that as one or more viral respiratory pathogens can be detected in the upper respiratory tract of as many as 30% of asymptomatic young children, 36, 37 it is likely that in several patients with bronchiolitis and more than one virus detected in nasopharyngeal swab, one of the viruses is responsible for the acute infection while the others are innocent bystanders, possibly as a result of prolonged shedding after an already resolved infection.",

The proportion of children with comorbidities was statistically significantly higher in PICU group than in PED or WARD group (P < 0.001). Comparison of children receiving antibiotic treatment among the three groups showed significant differences as the majority of children in PICU group received antibiotics compared to a much lower proportion in the WARD and PED group. The most common viruses present in nasopharyngeal swab were RSV (272/473, 57.5%), HRV (121/473, 25.6%) and HBoV (87/473, 18.4%).

Firstly, the sample size of a PICU group is relatively small. With only 24 patients, more detailed analysis was sometimes not possible. We believe that our results are reliable, but bigger sample would provide additional insights and some pertinent variable investigated might have been",
