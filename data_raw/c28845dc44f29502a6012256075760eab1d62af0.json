Here, we evaluated the utility of ChAdOx1, a promising replication-deficient simian adenovirus vaccine vector platform with an established safety profile in humans and dromedary camels, for MERS-CoV vaccine development. Using a transgenic lethal BALB/c MERS-CoV mouse model we showed that single dose intranasal or intramuscular immunisation with ChAdOx1 MERS, encoding full-length MERS-CoV Spike glycoprotein, is highly immunogenic and confers protection against lethal viral challenge. Immunogenicity and efficacy were comparable between immunisation routes. Together these data provide support for further evaluation of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine in humans and dromedary camels, the animal reservoir of infection.",

Most infections (>80%) have been geographically linked to Saudi Arabia, but travel-related cases have occurred in Europe, Asia and Africa. 1 Dromedary camels are susceptible to MERS-CoV infections and appear to be the main reservoir of virus. However, human-to-human transmission underlies rapid spread of MERS-CoV within hospital settings. 2 High seroprevalence of antibodies against MERS-CoV has been reported in dromedary camels in the Middle East and various countries in Africa indicating widespread MERS-CoV circulation. 3 No licensed vaccines or treatments are currently available for MERS-CoV infections. Ongoing disease control strategies have so far relied on minimising contact with dromedary camels, observing standard infection control measures to limit nosocomial transmission, contact tracing and quarantine. Addressing this unmet need for MERS-CoV interventions has been prioritised by the WHO for urgent action 4 and could most rapidly be achieved through a one health approach in which products are codeveloped for use in humans (to prevent disease) and camels (to limit virus shedding and block subsequent transmission to humans). Leveraging vaccine technology platforms with an established safety profile in both these target species would allow relatively rapid progression through the product development pipeline.",

Among the most promising human vaccine platforms are replication-deficient simian adenovirus vectors (ChAd), which boasts a very good safety and immunogenicity profile in humans as demonstrated in clinical trials against a wide range of indications including malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, influenza, hepatitis C, Ebola and others. 5 One ChAd vector, termed ChAdOx1, 6 has undergone testing in dromedary camels, showing excellent safety and immunogenicity when encoding Rift Valley Fever viral glycoproteins. 7 We recently made a vaccine construct, ChAdOx1 MERS, 8 encoding the full-length MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein (GenBank accession number KJ650098.1) targeted by protective neutralising antibodies. 9 The spike glycoprotein transgene sequence was inserted in the ChAdOx1 E1 region, included a human tissue plasminogen activator signal sequence in the Nterminus, and its expression was under the control of the human major immediate early cytomegalovirus promoter including intron A. ChAdOx1 MERS was shown to elicit high-titre MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies and a robust CD8+ T cell response against the spike glycoprotein. 8 Here, to determine ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine efficacy we utilised a recently developed transgenic lethal BALB/c mouse model (van Doremalen et al., submitted) expressing the human dipeptidyl peptidase (hDPP4) gene in the Rosa26 locus, which renders mice susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. 10 Infection with MERS-CoV in the hDPP4 mouse model is uniformly lethal with a dose of 10 3 TCID50 or higher. MERS-CoV infection is characterised by an initial respiratory phase and a secondary encephalitic phase, similar to what has been described previously. 11 ",

This should be relatively straightforward given the established safety profile of the ChAdOx1 platform in humans 5 and dromedary camels. 7 A deployable human MERS-CoV vaccine will need to be safe and efficacious in at-risk populations, including healthcare workers, camel herders and those with comorbidities as highlighted in the ongoing WHO-led consultation on an ideal target product profile for MERS-CoV vaccines. However, a major gap remains in the understanding of key immune mechanisms responsible for protection from disease; whilst MERS-CoV infections elicit high titre neutralising antibody in camels, these do not appear sufficient to provide long-term protection against reinfection. [12] [13] [14] Identification of immune correlates of protection against MERS-CoV in humans and camels will allow cost-effective disease surveillance and vaccine monitoring.",

Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). An in-house produced rabbit polyclonal antiserum against HCoV-EMC/2012 (1:1000) was used as a primary antibody for the detection of viral antigen. Grading of histopathology and immunohistochemistry was done blinded by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. Lung tissues are shown at 100 and 1000\u00d7 (insert) magnification. ChAdOx1 eGFP intranasally (a) and intramuscularly (c) vaccinated animals show multifocal scattered positivity in the lungs. The inserts display MERS-CoV antigen within the Type I and II pneumocytes. ChAdOx1 MERS intranasally (b) and intramuscularly (d) vaccinated animals showed no MERS-CoV antigen positivity model. The excellent immunogenicity and efficacy observed here will underpin future evaluations of ChAdOx1 MERS in dromedary camels and humans.",

Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). An in-house produced rabbit polyclonal antiserum against HCoV-EMC/2012 (1:1000) was used as a primary antibody for the detection of viral antigen. Grading of histopathology and immunohistochemistry was done blinded by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. Lung tissues are shown at 100 and 1000\u00d7 (insert) magnification. ChAdOx1 eGFP intranasally (a) and intramuscularly (c) vaccinated animals show multifocal scattered positivity in the lungs. The inserts display MERS-CoV antigen within the Type I and II pneumocytes.
