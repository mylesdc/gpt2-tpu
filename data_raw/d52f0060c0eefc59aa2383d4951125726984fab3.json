Ten-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) female Balb/c mice were anesthetized with pelltobarbitalum natricum. Then, 50 \u03bcL of PBS containing 20 \u03bcg of 25 kD linear PEI (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) or 2.5 \u03bcg of CTB (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) or PBS alone as a control was intranasally administered twice at 24 and 48 h before challenge with 5 LD 50 influenza virus H1N1 (A/PR/8/34). Mouse body weights were monitored every day, and those with greater than 25% loss of their initial body weight were euthanized as described. 4 As shown in Figure 1A , the body weight of the mice in the PEI-pretreated group remained stable from day 1 to day 5 after H1N1 challenge and then gradually decreased until day 11, for a total loss of 18%, before recovering. By contrast, the body weights of the mice in the CTB-and PBS-pretreated groups decreased significantly beginning on day 2 and reached losses of more than 25% by day 8 and 10, respectively, after H1N1 challenge. The final survival rate of the mice in the PEI-pretreated group was 60%, whereas that of the mice in the CTB-and PBS-pretreated groups was 0% ( Figure 1B) . We then examined the viral titers in mouse lungs as previously described 5 and found that PEI significantly reduced lung viral titers on day 2 after H1N1 challenge, whereas the viral titers in the lungs of mice in the CTB-and PBS-pretreated groups showed no significant differences ( Figure 1C ). Subsequently, we examined lung sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin as previously described. 2 On day 2 after H1N1 infection, the pulmonary alveoli were relatively intact, and only a few inflammatory cells were observed in the lung tissues of mice in the PEI-pretreated group. However, the lungs of mice in the CTB-and PBS-pretreated groups were filled with abundant inflammatory cells ( Figure 1D ).

As previously reported, some of these cytokines, such as interferon, GM-CSF and IFITM3, were effective in protecting against influenza infection. 6-8 As shown in Supplementary Figure S1 , PEI induced a significantly higher RNA level of IFN-\u03b14 than CTB or PBS. Furthermore, the RNA levels of GM-CSF and IFITM3 elicited by PEI were similar to those induced by CTB but much higher than those induced by PBS. The RNA level of IL-17 in mice pretreated with CTB, an IL-17-inducing adjuvant, was approximately 7-and 42-fold higher than that in mice pretreated with PEI and PBS, respectively. These results suggest that IFN-\u03b14, GM-CSF, and IFITM3 are 'good cytokines' because they act as protective mediators against influenza virus infection, whereas IL-17 is a 'bad cytokine' that exacerbates pathology, primarily in the lung, after influenza infection.",

As previously reported, some of these cytokines, such as interferon, GM-CSF and IFITM3, were effective in protecting against influenza infection. [6] [7] [8] As shown in Supplementary Figure S1 , PEI induced a significantly higher RNA level of IFN-\u03b14 than CTB or PBS. Furthermore, the RNA levels of GM-CSF and IFITM3 elicited by PEI were similar to those induced by CTB but much higher than those induced by PBS. The RNA level of IL-17 in mice pretreated with CTB, an IL-17-inducing adjuvant, was approximately 7-and 42-fold higher than that in mice pretreated with PEI and PBS, respectively. These results suggest that IFN-\u03b14, GM-CSF, and IFITM3 are 'good cytokines' because they act as protective mediators against influenza virus infection, whereas IL-17 is a 'bad cytokine' that exacerbates pathology, primarily in the lung, after influenza infection.",
