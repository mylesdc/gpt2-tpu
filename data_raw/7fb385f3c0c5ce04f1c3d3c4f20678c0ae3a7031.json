The aim of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) towards respiratory tract infections (RTIs) prevention among Malaysian Hajj pilgrims. Methods: This study was conducted among Malaysian Umrah pilgrims in Malaysia from Kuala Lumpur and Kelantan. The questionnaire then underwent a series of validation process that included content, face validity and exploratory part. Item response theory (IRT) analysis was utilized for the validation of the knowledge domain. The attitude and practice were validated using the exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Results: The validation process resulted in a questionnaire that comprised of four main sections: demography, knowledge, attitude, and practice. Following IRT analysis of the knowledge domain, all items analyzed were within the acceptable range of difficulty and discrimination. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (KMO) was 0.72 and 0.84 for attitude and practice domain respectively and Bartlett's test of Sphericity for both domains were highly significant (P < 0.001). The factor analysis resulted in two factors with total of 12 items in attitude domain, and 2 factors with total of 13 items in the practice domain with satisfactory factor loading (> 0.3). The Cronbach's alpha for reliability of the knowledge, attitude and practice domains all showed acceptable values of > 0.6 (0.92, 0.77 and 0.85). Conclusion: The findings of this validation and reliability study showed that the developed questionnaire had a satisfactory psychometric property for measuring KAP of Malaysian Hajj pilgrims.",

KAP level at lower standard had been one of the foremost pointers of poor health, unproductive health care practice, the drop of the disease screening rate, and unrealistic preventive behavior toward various infections in various settings [10, 11] .

However, the prevalence of RTI during Hajj has continued to rise over the recent years among Malaysian and other pilgrims across the world [14, 15] . Currently, there is a paucity of standardized and validated measurement tool on its KAP towards prevention of RTIs during Hajj. Therefore, this research was conducted to develop and validate an instrument meant to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practice in terms of face validity, content validity, exploratory factor analysis and reliability towards prevention of respiratory tract infection among Malaysian Hajj pilgrims in order to understand and improve prevention strategies using health educational intervention.",

First, a briefing was done to the participants about the study and informed consent was then obtained from the respondents who agreed to be involved in the study. The KAP questionnaire forms were given to each participant for selfadministration. Data were analyse using R software version 3.5.0, in the R Studio environment.
