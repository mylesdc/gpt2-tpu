Virus isolation (VI), the traditional gold standard of diagnostic methods for EI, 5, 7 has now been replaced by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays because of their superior rapidity and sensitivity. 8, 9 Also, some rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests licensed for diagnosing human influenza have been successfully used in the diagnosis of EI. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] These RAD tests enable the qualitative detection of influenza A viral nucleoprotein antigens in respiratory specimens without technical expertise and expensive equipment. 16 Thus, they are often used as initial screening tests for EI. [10] [11] [12] 17 There are a variety of RAD tests commercially available. 16, 18 At the time of writing (April 2015), there were at least 21 RAD tests commercially available in Japan for diagnosing human influenza and one RAD kit for the diagnosis of avian influenza. Prior to this, no one had conducted an extensive comparison of the sensitivity of these RAD tests for the detection of EIV. We evaluated the sensitivity of selected RAD tests licensed in Japan for the diagnosis of human or avian influenza, in the detection of EIV in nasopharyngeal swabs from both experimentally and naturally infected horses.",

Although ImmunoAce Flu, BD Flu examan, Quick chaser Flu A, B and ESPLINE Influenza A&B-N showed the highest sensitivity with the detection limit at 10 4\u00c19 EID 50 /ml among the 22 RAD tests, their sensitivities were 125-fold lower than those of the molecular diagnoses (10 2\u00c11 to 10 2\u00c18 EID 50 /ml). These large differences in the sensitivity between the RAD tests and the molecular tests indicate that the latter are the most appropriate tests for EI diagnosis. However, ESPLINE Influenza A&B-N and BD Directigen Flu A (or A+B) were used for the screening of horses in quarantine stations and the identification of infected horses during EI outbreaks. [10] [11] [12] 17 Sensitive RAD tests may serve as an adjunct to molecular tests, and positive results are instructive as the specificities of the tests. They are a rapid and easy way to carry out preliminary screening if EI is suspected but are best used in a population of horses rather than in individual cases. Negative test results need to be verified by a molecular test; thus, the RAD tests are unsuitable for testing for freedom of infection prior to movement.",

            "text": "Over the decades, the rapid international movement of horses by air has increased the risk of virus incursions into susceptible population. 28, 29 Therefore, the detection of EIVpositive horses in quarantine facilities is an important control measure and the tests need to be of optimum sensitivity. The majority of horses are immunized between 21 and 90 days before shipment either with a primary course or with a booster. Thus, they are likely to shed far less virus than the horses in the experimental study discussed above and may show few or no clinical signs. Furthermore, quarantine periods vary depending on the importing country, the purpose of movement and the status of the exporting country. Thus, the window of opportunity for the detection of EI may be quite short and the nasal swabs may be collected prior to or after virus shedding has peaked. Our results suggest that the molecular diagnosis for EIV is more likely to protect susceptible local populations from the intrusion of EIV than a reliance on RAD tests which are less sensitive. Of the molecular tests used in this study, rRT-PCR appeared to be the most sensitive assay with a detection limit of 10 2\u00c11 EID 50 /ml, which can be converted to approx. 10 \u00c00\u00c16 EID 50 /2 ll/reaction, assuming that the efficiency of RNA extraction is 100%. The RAD tests enable veterinarians and others responsible for the health of horses to perform the rapid diagnosis of EI without special equipment and technical expertise. However, the usage of even the most sensitive RAD tests is best limited to population screening and all negative samples from suspect cases should be submitted to a laboratory for further testing.",

            "text": "In summary, the results of this study indicate that the sensitivities of the 22 RAD tests commercially available in Japan in the detection of EIV vary hugely. Moreover, this study showed that only three of 22 RAD tests, namely ImmunoAce Flu, BD Flu examan and Quick chaser Flu A, B, were substantially fit for diagnosing EI. As the viral nucleoprotein is highly conserved for the last three decades (>98% amino acid homology, data not shown) in EIV (H3N8), sequence diversity should not affect the sensitivity of these RAD tests. However, because these tests are frequently modified and their availability varies from country to country, re-evaluations of their performances may be periodically required in each country. RAD tests are not necessarily performed by equine healthcare professionals, and it is essential that those responsible for screening horses are made aware that the majority of such tests are unsuitable for the detection of EI-infected horses. It is imperative to select an appropriate RAD and to submit negative samples from suspect cases to a laboratory for confirmatory testing.",
