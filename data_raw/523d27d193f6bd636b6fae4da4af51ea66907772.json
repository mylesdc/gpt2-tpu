            "text": "HCV infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and liver cancer in the United States. To address the pathogenesis caused by HCV infection, recent studies have focused on the direct cytopathic effects of individual HCV proteins, with the objective of identifying their specific roles in the overall pathogenesis. However, this approach precludes examination of the possible interactions between different HCV proteins and organelles. To obtain a better understanding of the various cytopathic effects of and cellular responses to HCV proteins, we used human hepatoma cells constitutively replicating HCV RNA encoding either the full-length polyprotein or the non-structural proteins, or cells constitutively expressing the structural protein core, to model the state of persistent HCV infection and examined the combination of various HCV proteins in cellular pathogenesis. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the mitochondria, mitochondrial injury and degeneration, and increased lipid accumulation were common among all HCV protein-expressing cells regardless of whether they expressed the structural or non-structural proteins. Expression of the non-structural proteins also led to increased oxidative stress in the cytosol, membrane blebbing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and accumulation of autophagocytic vacuoles. Alterations of cellular redox state, on the other hand, significantly changed the level of autophagy, suggesting a direct link between oxidative stress and HCV-mediated activation of autophagy. With the widespread cytopathic effects, cells with the full-length HCV polyprotein showed a modest antioxidant response and exhibited a significant increase in population doubling time and a concomitant decrease in cyclin D1. In contrast, cells expressing the non-structural proteins were able to launch a vigorous antioxidant response with up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes. The population doubling time and cyclin D1 level were also comparable to that of control cells. Finally, the cytopathic effects of core protein appeared to focus on the mitochondria without remarkable disturbances in the cytosol.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped, positive, singlestranded RNA virus in the family of Flaviviridae [1] . The linear, non-segmented HCV genome of 9.6 kb encodes a polyprotein that undergoes post-translational cleavage by cellular and viral proteases to yield at least 10 mature proteins [2] [3] [4] . HCV infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and is the major cause of liver cancer in the United States. HCV produces a chronic infection in 50-80% of infected patients; among them, roughly 20% will eventually develop liver cirrhosis. It is widely accepted that insufficient host immune response in eliminating HCV leads to persistent infection and the eventual development of liver diseases [4] [5] [6] . Interferon-a and ribavirin treatments have been prescribed either to stimulate immune response for clearance of viruses or to disrupt viral replication. However, high toxicity and low efficacy toward the two most prevalent HCV subtypes, 1a and 1b, in the US has been a barrier to effective eradication of persistent HCV infections [7] .",

            "text": "To address the pathogenesis caused by HCV infection, recent studies have begun to focus on direct cytopathic effects. HCV proteins associate with different subcellular structures, including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and lipid droplets, to facilitate replication and assembly of viral particles [2] . These associations lead to alterations of the integrity and functions of organelles. HCV-mediated oxidative stress is commonly observed and is achieved by increasing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) or by altering cellular antioxidant capacities [8] [9] [10] [11] . In particular, HCV core proteins are shown to be closely associated with the mitochondria and cause increases in ROS and RNS production and lipid peroxidation [11] [12] [13] [14] , reduction in GSH and NADPH concentrations, reduction in mitochondrial complex I activities, and increase in mitochondrial Ca +2 uptake, which ultimately disrupts mitochondrial membrane permeability and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction [14, 15] . HCV nonstructural proteins have also been implicated in disturbing the redox balance and altering antioxidant enzyme levels [16, 17] . Specifically, NS5A is shown to up-regulate Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) through AP1 transcription factor in the p38 MAPK and JNK signaling pathways [18, 19] . Additional studies showed the involvement of NS5A in ER stress and disturbance of intracellular Ca +2 homeostasis, which leads to increased mitochondrial ROS production and altered mitochondrial function [18, 20] . Because of the relationship between chronic HCV infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, studies have also been carried out to identify HCV proteins that may be responsible for the hepatocarcinogenesis. For example, the HCV core protein has been shown to promote immortalization of primary human hepatocytes [21] , whereas the non-structural proteins NS3 and NS4B have been shown to transform NIH 3T3 cells either individually or in combination with Ha-ras [22, 23] .",

The study results revealed mitochondrial injury as a common defect among genome-length replicon, subgenomic replicon, and Core-on cells with enlarged mitochondria and focal loss of cristae ( Figure 1B ). Consistent with this observation, measurement of the cross sectional area of mitochondria directly from electron micrographs showed a significant increase in mitochondrial sizes ( Figure 2A ). The data indicates mitochondrial degeneration and the possible loss of mitochondria. Consequently, the number of mitochondria per cell was significantly reduced ( Figure 2B ). In addition to mitochondrial defects, accumulation of lipid droplets was common among all three HCV protein-expressing cell lines ( Figure 1B and Figure S2 ). Genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells also showed focally dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and prominent presence of autophagocytic vacuoles ( Figures 1B and 3A ).",

To determine the extent of ROS generation in the mitochondria, MitoSOX was used for live cell staining. The results showed a significant increase in ROS production in the mitochondria across all three cell lines ( Figures 2C and 2D ). After adjusting to the average number of mitochondria per cell, the level of MitoSOX intensity was similar among genome-length replicon, subgenomic replicon, and Coreon cells. Cytosolic and mitochondrial aconitases (ACO1 and ACO2) are very sensitive to inactivation by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and reduction in aconitase protein levels and enzyme activities have been used as indicators for increased oxidative stress in their respective subcellular compartments [24, 25] . Our studies showed that ACO1 existed at low levels, whereas ACO2 was barely detectable by western blot analysis, in Huh7 and HCV protein-expressing cells. ACO1 protein level was reduced by 18% in cells with the genome-length replicon ( Figure  S3A ), and total aconitase activity was reduced by 5-23% ( Figure  S3B ) in genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells. The reduction in total aconitase activity most likely reflected increased oxidative stress in the cytosol because the majority of aconitase in Huh7 cells was in cytosolic form.",

Changes in total LC3 and LC3-II levels were used as indicators of autophagy. Significant reduction of total LC3 and LC3-II levels was observed in subgenomic replicon, Core-on, and Core-off cells with overexpression of CuZnSOD/cytosolic catalase (SOD1/cCAT) or MnSOD/mitochondrial catalase (SOD2/mCAT) ( Figure 4A ). Although similar trends were observed in Huh7 cells, the extent of reduction did not reach a significant level. Despite comparable levels of CuZnSOD, MnSOD, and catalase expression ( Figure S4 ), LC3 levels were not altered in genome-length replicon cells. In contrast, X/XO treatment significantly increased total LC3 levels in genomic replicon, subgenomic replicon, and Core-off cells ( Figure 4B , left panel). However, LC3-II levels were only significantly increased in genomic replicon and Core-off cells ( Figure 4B , right panel). No significant change in LC3-II level was observed in Huh7, subgenomic replicon, and Core-on cells. Furthermore, addition of CAT to the X/XO treatment diminished the increase of total LC3 in genome-length and subgenomic cells ( Figure 4B ). The data suggest that the enhanced autophagy from X/XO treatment is mediated through H 2 O 2 in genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells.",

Significant increases in the protein levels of CuZnSOD, MnSOD, PRDX1, PRDX3, TRX1, and TRX2 were consistently observed in the subgenomic replicon cells, and the extent of increase ranges from 1.5-to 4.9-fold ( Figure 5 ).

Consequently, expression of HCV core or non-structural proteins led to increased ROS generation in the mitochondria, which most likely contributed to mitochondrial injury and degeneration. Expression of non-structural proteins also led to membrane blebbing in the ER and accumulation of autophagocytic vacuoles. Despite these changes, only cells with the subgenomic replicon (i.e. cells expressing the non-structural proteins) showed consistent upregulation of mitochondrial and cytosolic antioxidant enzymes. Cells with the genome-length replicon, on the other hand, did not have a robust antioxidant response and showed prolonged population doubling time and a decrease in cyclin D1 expression. Apart from the shared mitochondrial phenotype, increased lipid accumulation was also common among all three HCV proteinexpressing cell lines. Subcellular locations of HCV proteins have provided important clues to the site of viral genome replication and assembly, as well as the cytopathic effects caused by HCV infection. The ultrastructure study with immunogold labeling showed a distinct localization of core, NS5A, and NS5B proteins in the mitochondria and the ER. Significant core, NS5A, and NS5B distributions were observed in other subcellular compartments, including the Golgi apparatus, the nucleus, and lipid droplets. The study results are in general agreement with previously published data [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . However, the inner membrane location of core protein was unexpected because previous studies using proteinase K digestion suggested association of core protein with the mitochondrial outer membrane and the mitochondrial-associated membrane compartment [15, 28] . The discrepancy could be due to the compromised mitochondrial membrane integrity in genome-length replicon and Core-on cells, or due to artifacts from sample preparations for EM analysis. The association of core protein with lipid droplets also appeared to be lower than previous study results, and the discrepancy could be due to differences in the antibodies used.",

In this study, cells expressing only the nonstructural proteins were also shown to have suffered from mitochondrial damage, and the extent of damage, in terms of mitochondrial size and number, was comparable to that of cells expressing the full-length polyprotein or core protein (Figures 2A  and 2B ). In addition, the level of ROS production in the mitochondria, as detected by MitoSOX, was also comparable among the three HCV protein-expressing cell lines after adjusting for total mitochondria (Figures 2C and 2D) . The data suggest that multiple HCV proteins are capable of entering the mitochondria and cause increased oxidative stress, although the underlying mechanism may not be the same for each protein. The core protein-expressing cells had the lowest number of mitochondria per cell ( Figure 2B ). The data implies that Core-on cells may suffer from the most severe mitochondrial loss among the three HCV protein-expressing cell lines. Whether this is due to the higher level of core protein expression in Core-on cells ( Figure S1A ) will need to be examined with other approaches.",

            "text": "Cells respond to a variety of internal stress or cellular damages by forming autophagosomes to degrade damaged components and to recycle usable elements for future biosynthesis [33] . However, some RNA viruses, most notably, poliovirus, dengue virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus develop the abilities to overcome such cellular defense by hijacking the autophagocytic pathway to facilitate viral replication [34] [35] [36] [37] . Multiple studies in recent years have shown that HCV infection of the human hepatoma cell line Huh7 and immortalized human hepatocytes induce autophagocytic vacuoles [38, 39] and that autophagy machinery is required for the initiation of HCV replication [40] and the production of infectious particles [41] . HCV induces the accumulation of autophagosomes via activation of the unfolded protein response pathway without enhancing autophagocytic protein degradation [38, 42] . Consequently, inhibition of autophagy inhibits HCV replication [41] . Although most studies are carried out with HCV genotype 2a, it is now well accepted that autophagy probably also occurs with infection of other HCV genotypes. What is not clear from these studies is whether enhanced autophagy persists during the chronic phase of HCV infection, and if and to what extent oxidative stress contributes to HCV-mediated activation of autophagy. In this study, we observed the accumulation of autophagocytic vacuoles and up-regulation of the autophagosome marker, LC3, in the genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells (Figures 3B-3D) . The data suggests that HCV non-structural proteins play a role in inducing autophagy, possibly through ER stress ( Figure 1B) , mitochondrial damage ( Figures 1B and 2A) , and induction of oxidative stress (Figures 2D and 4B ). Core-on cells, on the other hand, had a slight increase in the number of autophagocytic vacuoles without a significant increase in LC3-II or total LC3 levels ( Figures 3B-3D) .",

            "text": "HCV-mediated oxidative stress was likely a contributor in the activation of autophagy because enhanced antioxidant capacity significantly reduced total LC3 and LC3-II levels ( Figure 4A ), whereas increased oxidative stress led to a further increase in total LC3 and LC3-II ( Figure 4B ). ROS generated in the cytosol and mitochondria was equally capable of enhancing autophagy because increased antioxidant capacity in either compartment achieved comparable levels of reduction. In addition, H 2 O 2 appeared to be the main culprit in ROS-mediated activation of autophagy within this experimental system since addition of catalase effectively suppressed X/XO-mediated activation of autophagy ( Figure 4B ). Despite up-regulation of multiple antioxidant enzymes in subgenomic replicon cells ( Figure 5 ), these cells responded to further increase in antioxidant enzymes with reduced autophagy. It is important to note that although the antioxidant enzymes clearly can modulate the effects of viral proteins, they only serve to reduce the LC3 increase by ,26% in subgenomic replicon cells. The data suggest either that other mechanisms, such as ER stress, are important as well or that the antioxidant effect is incomplete. Overexpression of antioxidant enzymes also led to a reduction of autophagy in Core-on and Core-off cells. Antioxidant enzyme overexpression in cells with genome-length replicon, on the other hand, failed to reduce the level of autophagy even though the enhanced antioxidant capacity from SOD/CAT expression vectors was comparable to that of other cells ( Figure  S4 ). In contrast, increased oxidative stress effectively increased autophagy in genome-length replicon cells ( Figure 4B ). The data suggest that oxidative stress may not play a significant role in the basal level of autophagy in genome-length replicon cells; however, the cells are sensitive to additional oxidative stress and are capable of accumulating more autophagosomes under conditions of increased oxidative stress. Although total LC3 levels were increased in X/XO-treated subgenomic replicon cells, LC3-II levels were not changed with the added oxidative stress ( Figure 4B ). It is possible that the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II was already at the maximum level in subgenomic replicon cells, and additional oxidative stress was not able to enhance the reaction further.",

Whether the NS5A localization in the autophagosome observed in our study is a cellular defense mechanism elicited to degrade foreign antigens or a viral mediated self-preserving mechanism to enable viral replication remains to be determined. HCV transgenic mice expressing the full-length HCV polyprotein were also examined for the accumulation of autophagocytic vacuoles in the liver. However, no evidence of enhanced autophagy was detected. It is possible that additional factors are needed to cause the accumulation of autophagosomes in vivo or that very low viral protein expression levels in the transgenic mice were not sufficient to induce these changes. A previous study using the same line of transgenic mice [43] showed that long-term iron overload was necessary to induce the accumulation of autophagosomes. Since iron overload increases oxidative stress in the liver, the result is consistent with our finding in HCV protein-expressing cells in the relationship between oxidative stress and autophagy.",

            "text": "Huh7 cells with the subgenomic replicon showed significant upregulation of multiple antioxidant enzymes that belonged to the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments ( Figure 5 ). Despite the up-regulation of multiple antioxidant enzymes, the ratios of oxidized (Sulfonic form) to total peroxiredoxin 1 and 3 in the subgenomic replicon cells remained the same as that in Huh7 cells ( Figure S5 ), suggesting that the overall redox environment was still more oxidizing. This conclusion was also supported by the increased MitoSOX staining and reduced aconitase activities ( Figures 2C and 2D and Figure S3B ). Whether the up-regulation of multiple antioxidant enzymes in the subgenomic replicon cells is a direct response to the presence of HCV non-structural proteins or is merely a clonal variation will need to be deciphered with additional studies in the future. However, it is worth noting that previous studies with different HCV subgenomic repliconexpressing cells also showed a similar up-regulation in various antioxidant enzymes [17, 44] . Huh7 cells with the genome-length replicon had a 1.8-fold increase in the mitochondrial form of thioredoxin (TRX2), but a 15% reduction of its upstream enzyme PRDX3 ( Figure 5 ). The net result was a slightly higher ratio of PRDX3-SO3 to total PRDX3; however, the increase was not significantly higher than that of Huh7 cells ( Figure S5B ). The expression level of non-structural proteins should be comparable between the genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells based on the SEAP reporter assay ( Figure S1A ) and published results [45] . Therefore, the lack of antioxidant response in cells with the genome-length replicon was probably not due to a difference in the expression of non-structural proteins; but rather, it could be due to the additional cytopathic effects from core, E1, E2, and p7 proteins that counteract the antioxidant enzyme response induced by non-structural proteins. Consequently, the genome-length replicon cells had a prolonged population doubling time and reduced cyclin D1 expression (Figure 6) , which suggested delayed cell cycle progression. In contrast, Core-on cells showed no changes in any of the antioxidant enzymes examined.",

            "text": "In summary, our studies using Huh7 cells expressing different parts of the HCV polyprotein suggest that the presence of the fulllength HCV polyprotein leads to the most severe cellular damage, including generation of ROS, accumulation of lipids, ER stress, mitochondrial injury and degeneration, accumulation of autophagosomes, and prolonged population doubling time. Despite the elevated levels of ROS, these cells failed to mount a robust antioxidant response. Huh7 cells with only the non-structural proteins, on the other hand, have the same cytopathic changes as that observed in the genome-length replicon cells, but the cells showed a robust antioxidant response even though the response was not sufficient to suppress HCV-mediated ROS production. Our data suggest that HCV-mediated ER stress, mitochondrial injury, and oxidative stress form the three arms of mediators for the activation of autophagy (Figure 7) . Their effects are additive and inter-related. Without a concomitant increase in downstream protein degradation, autophagosomes accumulate and provide a sanctuary for HCV replication and protection from host immune surveillance [42] . The process likely helps to sustain a low level of viral production, which perpetuates chronic HCV infection and chronic liver injury (Figure 7) . In addition to activation of autophagy, HCV-mediated ER stress can lead to imbalance in Ca homeostasis, which further contributes to cellular oxidative stress [14, 15, 46, 47] . Mitochondrial injury can lead to metabolic deficits Figure 7 . Diagrammatic presentation of the cytopathic effects caused by various HCV proteins. Replication of HCV RNA and production of HCV structural (core, E1, E2, and p7) and non-structural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) in the rough ER and the subsequent partition of HCV proteins to different subcellular compartments lead to ER stress, mitochondrial injury, and the production of ROS. These cytopathic effects lead to activation of autophagy without a concomitant increase in protein degradation. Consequently, autophagosomes accumulate in HCV infected cells. EM photo with normal mitochondria (M) and rough ER (RER) was taken from healthy Huh7 cells; EM photos with enlarged mitochondria, ER blebbing, lipid droplet (L), and autophagosomes (A) were taken from genome-length and subgenomic replicon cells. The HCV genetic materials contained in genome-length replicon, subgenomic replicon, and Core-on cells are depicted at the top of the diagram. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0028551.g007 and further exacerbates cell injury and dysfunction. Oxidative stress can cause increased DNA damage and mutation, inactivation of redox-sensitive proteins, and activation of redox sensitive signaling pathways such as MAPK and AP-1 [48] [49] [50] . These cytopathic effects work in concert in the course of chronic HCV infection to promote cell death, hepatocyte turnover, alteration of the liver microenvironment, and ultimately cell transformation and tumorigenesis.",

Cells were imaged directly in HBSS with a 40x (NA = 0.6) objective on an Olympus IX71 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Coolsnap HQ monochrome camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA). For direct comparison of staining intensity, exposure time was kept constant at 500 msec for MitoSOX and at 200 msec for MitoTracker. Staining intensities of MitoSOX and MitoTracker were determined with Image J as pixel intensities, and a minimum of 40 cells each were analyzed.",

Huh7 cells with the genome-length or subgenomic replicon were cultured to ,80% confluency and cell culture medium from each cell line was removed for SEAP assays. The SEAP reporter assay was performed using the Great EscAPe SEAP Fluorescence Detection Kit (Clontech), and SEAP activities were normalized to total cellular proteins. To determine total aconitase activities, Huh7 and HCV protein-expressing cells were cultured to 90% confluency in 60 mm plates. Cell pellets were resuspended in aconitase buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8, 2 mM citric acid, and 0.6 mM MnCl 2 ) and passed through two rounds of freeze-thaw cycle between liquid nitrogen and room temperature water to break open membranes. Due to the low level of aconitases in Huh7 cells, total aconitase activities were determined with a kinetic assay [24] coupled to the PMS/MTT color reaction to enhance the sensitivity [25] . Following a 3-minute preincubation at 37uC in the dark, the reaction was continued at 37uC and the OD change was monitored every 5 minutes at 590 nm for up to 60 minutes using a plate reader (SpectraMax M3, Molecular Devices, Mountain View, CA, USA). The reaction appeared to be most linear in the first 30 minutes and consequently, OD change per minute, as a function of enzyme activities, was calculated for that time period. The final results were normalized to the amount of total proteins in the cell lysates.",

PRDX-SO3 antibody only detects sulfonylated PRDX and is not specific to PRDX1-SO3 or PRDX3-SO3. Consequently, sulfonylated PRDX1 and PRDX3 were distinguished based on their size difference ( Figure S5C ).
