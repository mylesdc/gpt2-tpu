Not much is known about the interactions between viral and cellular factors that regulate JEV infection. By using a kinase/phosphatase-wide RNAi screening approach, we identified a cell cycle-regulating molecule, checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), that plays a role in regulating JEV replication. JEV infection induced G1 arrest and activated CHK2. Inactivation of CHK2 and its upstream ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase in JEV-infected cells by using inhibitors reduced virus replication. Likewise, JEV replication was significantly decreased by knockdown of CHK2 expression with shRNA-producing lentiviral transduction. We identified CHK2 as a cellular factor participating in JEV replication, for a new strategy in addressing JEV infection.",

JEV is transmitted in a zoonotic cycle between mosquitoes and vertebrate-amplifying hosts, mainly swine and wading birds (Mansfield et al., 2017) . As a member of the Flavivirus genus, the JEV virion is enveloped and has a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. The initial steps of JEV infection include virus attachment to cell-surface receptors and entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Translation of the viral genome produces a polyprotein that is processed to structural core (C), precursor of membrane (prM), and envelope (E) proteins and the nonstructural proteins NS1\u223cNS5. Flaviviral genome replication occurs by the viral replicase complex via RNA-dependent RNA polymerization. The positive-sense genomic RNA is transcribed to a replication-intermediate negative-sense RNA, which is then used as a template to synthesize genomic RNA for subsequent translation and assembly of virion progeny (Tiroumourougane et al., 2002; Fields et al., 2007) .",

Some viruses have been shown to interact with and/or affect components of the ATM DNA damage pathway (Lilley et al., 2007; Bagga and Bouchard, 2014) . DNA viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (CMV) activate the ATM checkpoint pathway during DNA replication and inhibit DNA damage responses by mislocalizing checkpoint proteins from the nucleus to cytoplasm (Gaspar and Shenk, 2006) . Herpes simplex virus (HSV) induces an ATM-damage response that is essential for viral replication (Lilley et al., 2005; Shirata et al., 2005) . Inhibition of CHK2 kinase activity by the CHK2 inhibitor II significantly reduces the CPE and genome replication of HSV-1 in corneal epithelium (Alekseev et al., 2015) . Hepatitis C virus (HCV), an RNA virus belonging to Flaviviridae, induces G2/M phase arrest (Wu et al., 2008) and activates the dsDNA damage response pathway by causing DSBs and enhancing the mutation of cellular genes (Machida et al., 2004) . Knockdown of ATM or CHK2 suppresses RNA replication of HCV (Ariumi et al., 2008) , and HCV NS3-NS4A interacts with ATM, whereas HCV NS5B interacts with both ATM and CHK2 (Lai et al., 2008) . JEV is able to manipulate the cell cycle, which reduces the proliferation of neural progenitor cells (Das and Basu, 2008) and allows for persistent infection (Kim et al., 2015) .

U87, a human glioma cell line, was transduced by each of the seven VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus pool (Human kinase and phosphatase set) provided by the National RNAi Core Facility. Each kinases/phosphatases pooled tube contains \u223c180 kinase/phosphatase genes; each gene is targeted by 5 shRNAs that bind to distinct target sequences. The VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus set that carries these shRNAs knocked down 1260 genes encoding kinase/phosphatases, which accounts for \u223c90% of all kinase/phosphatase in accordance of the NCBI database. After selection with puromycin for lentivirustransduced cells, cells were infected JEV at an MOI of 10 ( Figure 1A) . Surviving cell colonies were cultured to extract genomic DNA. DNAs encoding shRNA were amplified by PCR and sequenced to determine their targets by BLAST alignment with the NCBI database to further confirm the identities of these genes as kinase/phosphatase encoding genes. Seven host candidate genes (Figure 1B) , were identified in cells survived from JEV challenge. To verify whether knockdown of these candidate genes indeed rescued cells from JEV infection, we transduced U87 cells with the lentiviral vector targeting each candidate gene and infected the cells with JEV. Knockdown of one of these candidate genes, CHEK2, substantially rendered cell survival from JEV infection. U87 cells showed reduced expression of CHK2 by transduction with lentivirus expressing an shRNA targeting CHK2 (Figure 2A) . Upon JEV infection, knockdown of CHK2 resulted in reduced CPE (Figure 2B) , enhanced cell survival ( Figure 2C ) and reduced JEV progeny production ( Figure 2D ) as compared with control knockdown shLacZ cells. To ascertain the importance of CHK2 in JEV infection, we further checked the involvement of CHK2 in another human cell line, A549 cells. Similarly, JEV production was reduced in human A549 cells with knocked-down CHK2 expression (Figure 3) .",

Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that may utilize host cell machineries during every step of their life cycles (Goff, 2007) . In this study, we used a human kinase/phosphatasewide RNAi strategy for large scale screening to identify a gene(s) involved in regulating JEV infection in U87 human glioma cells. Among the 1260 human kinases/phosphatases found, we identified a cell cycle-regulating molecule, CHK2, that facilitated JEV infection in the cells.",

Human papillomaviruses activate the ATM DNA response (Lai et al., 2008; Moody and Laimins, 2009 ). HSV-1 and SV40 recruit members of the ATM DNA damage pathway to specific sites in the nucleus during replication (Taylor and Knipe, 2004; Wilkinson and Weller, 2004; Zhao et al., 2008) . Furthermore, the NS5B of HCV was found to interact with both ATM and CHK2, and the replication of subgenomic replicon RNA of HCV was suppressed in cells with CHK2 knockdown (Ariumi et al., 2008) . In this study, we also found that downregulation of CHK2 and inhibition of CHK activity enhanced cell resistance to JEV infection. Likewise, progeny virus production and expression of viral proteins were reduced in cells with knockdown of functional CHK2. Because viral replication induces cellular stresses and triggers an ATR response, viruses may hijack CHK2 to elongate the cell cycle arrest, thus creating a time window for viral replication. Consequently, downregulation of CHK2 becomes a suitable way to inhibit virus propagation.",

BE(2)C cells were infected with JEV at MOI 0.1, 1 or 5 in the absence (DMSO solvent control) or presence of 25 or 50 \u00b5M CHK2 inhibitor II as indicated. (A) Immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates at 24 h with antibodies against T68-phosphorylated CHK2, CHK2 and actin. BE(2)C cells were treated with DMSO or CHK2 inhibitor II (50 \u00b5M), followed by JEV infection at MOIs of 0.1 (B) or 5 (C) for the indicated times. Culture supernatants were collected for virus titration by plaque-forming assays. Data are mean \u00b1 SD virus titers (n = 3). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01 ***p < 0.005 by two-tailed Student t-test. Viruses are streamlined organisms featured in minimizing proteins required for genome replication and control of the host cell cycle. In analogy to some RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (He et al., 2010) , mouse hepatitis virus (Chen and Makino, 2004) , and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Yuan et al., 2007) , JEV infection is able to regulate cell-cycle arrest in the G1 phase, probably resulting from CHK2 activation (Lavin and Kozlov, 2007) . Upon activation, CHK2 phosphorylates Cdc25a and Cdc25c (phosphatases), which results in G1/S or G2/M arrest via degradation or cytoplasmic sequestration, respectively (Antoni et al., 2007) . Each phase of the cell cycle should represent a unique metabolic status. Indeed, the transcription activity of Pol II is much higher in the G1 phase than in the S or G2/M phase (Yonaha et al., 1995) . As well, in non-dividing hepatocytes, the G0/G1 state has higher translation efficiency, which facilitates expression of the HCV genome (Fehr et al., 2012) . Likewise, to proliferate the viral genome, JEV may arrest the cell cycle in the G1 phase to increase Pol II transcription activity and translation efficiency. Moreover, oncogenic viruses often possess mechanisms to induce G1/S cell cycle arrest via p53 inactivation, thus rescuing the infected cells from apoptosis (Yew and Berk, 1992; Scheffner et al., 1993; H\u00e4rtl et al., 2008) . JEV inducing G1 arrest may be advantageous to gain sufficient time and resources for viral replication and to avoid early apoptosis of infected cells.",
