            "text": "Maintenance of epigenetic modifiers is of utmost importance to preserve the epigenome and consequently appropriate cellular functioning. Here, we analyzed Polycomb group protein (PcG) complex integrity in response to heat shock (HS). Upon HS, various Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC)1 and PRC2 subunits, including CBX proteins, but also other chromatin regulators, are found to accumulate in the nucleolus. In parallel, binding of PRC1/2 to target genes is strongly reduced, coinciding with a dramatic loss of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 marks. Nucleolar-accumulated CBX proteins are immobile, but remarkably both CBX protein accumulation and loss of PRC1/2 epigenetic marks are reversible. This post-heat shock recovery of pan-nuclear CBX protein localization and reinstallation of epigenetic marks is HSP70 dependent. Our findings demonstrate that the nucleolus is an essential protein quality control center, which is indispensable for recovery of epigenetic regulators and maintenance of the epigenome after heat shock.",

Proper maintenance of the epigenome is essential for cell viability, and increasing evidence suggests that changes in the chromatin landscape are causally related to aging-associated functional decline of a cell and ultimately cell death (Booth and Brunet, 2016) . Maintenance of the epigenetic landscape can only be guaranteed by correct positioning and activity of epigenetic modifiers across the genome, and may be threatened by proteotoxic stress. Importantly, misregulation of epigenetic modifiers (i.e. mutations, misexpression) is frequently observed in various cancer types, underlining that regulation of the epigenetic landscape is essential for appropriate cellular functioning (Dawson and Kouzarides, 2012) .",

PcG proteins reside in the canonical Polycomb repressive complexes 1 (PRC1) and 2 (PRC2) (Simon and Kingston, 2013) . The PRC2 complex contains EZH1/2-dependent methyltransferase activity toward histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) (Cao et al., 2002; Ezhkova et al., 2011; Kirmizis et al., 2004; Kuzmichev et al., 2002; Shen et al., 2008) . PRC1 can ubiquitinate histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119), by means of its E3 ligase subunit RING1A/B (de Napoles et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004) . PRC1 and PRC2 frequently colocalize at target genes and initially a hierarchical model was proposed for PRC1/2 function, where the CBX subunit of PRC1 recognizes the PRC2 mark H3K27me3, placing PRC1 function downstream of PRC2. However, recent studies have shown that PRC1 and PRC2 recruitment to chromatin, and associated histone modifying activities, can also be independent of each other (for a review see Blackledge et al., 2015) .",

Cellular stressors like HS and proteasome inhibition induce a quick depletion of the free ubiquitin pool and this coincides with a quick reduction of ubiquitinated histone H2A (H2AK119ub) in the cell Dantuma et al., 2006; Mimnaugh et al., 1997) . These data suggest that the epigenome may be affected by HS. A study in Drosophila cells indeed showed that HS leads to dramatic alterations of the 3D chromatin architecture as a consequence of weakening insulators between topologically eLife digest All cells in our bodies contain the same sequence of DNA, hence the same genes, in a compartment called the nucleus. Yet different sets of genes are switched on in different types of cells. Cells achieve this by a process called epigenetic regulation. Proteins known as epigenetic regulators modify DNA and its associated proteins in ways that can turn genes on or off. Different types of cells contain different epigenetic regulators, and so express different genes. The Polycomb group proteins (or PcG for short) turn their target genes off and are important to maintain the identity of a cell. When the target genes of PcG proteins are inadvertently switched on, this may lead to changes in the fate of cells, potentially resulting in diseases such as cancer. So, it is important that cells keep the PcG proteins active where necessary, even in the face of stress.",

This response is referred to as the Heat Shock Response and mediated largely by the so-called Heat Shock Transcription factor-1 (HSF-1) (Akerfelt et al., 2010) . HSPs function as molecular chaperones, not only guiding cotranslational folding under normal conditions but also serving to refold heat-unfolded proteins. If proteins cannot be correctly refolded, they can be poly-ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. Importantly, the intracellular pool of 'free' ubiquitin that is used for poly-ubiquitination of proteins is limited . As such, HSPs prevent protein dysfunction and aggregation, a hallmark of various age-related neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (Hartl et al., 2011; Kampinga and Bergink, 2016; Morimoto, 2008) .",

We observed that PRC1 and PRC2 subunits and various other chromatin modifiers accumulate in the nucleolus upon HS. Various labs have reported on reversible accumulation of reporter-proteins in the nucleus upon heat shock (Miller et al., 2015; Nollen et al., 2001; Park et al., 2013) , but whether this also holds true for endogenous proteins, and what could be the physiological relevance of this process, has remained unclear. We find that the nucleolar accumulation of these epigenetic regulators coincides with a displacement of PRC1 and PRC2 from their target genes and a dramatic loss of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3. Most importantly, the nucleolar accumulation is reversible in an HSP70-dependent manner allowing epigenetic recovery. Our data demonstrate that the nucleolus is an essential protein quality control (PQC) center that serves to restore the epigenomic landscape after conditions of proteotoxic stress in an HSP-dependent manner.",

We transduced cord blood CD34 + stem/progenitor cells using a GFP-CBX2 lentiviral vector ( Figure 1A) . Importantly, GFP pull out experiments in K562 GFP-CBX2 cells confirmed that GFP-CBX2 was properly incorporated in the PRC1 complex (Figure 1-figure supplement 1A) and ChIP-seq experiments in K562 GFP-CBX2 and K562 wild-type cells showed that GFP-CBX2 target genes largely overlapped with endogenous CBX2 target genes (based on ENCODE/Broad Institute data) and H2AK119ub enriched genes (van den Boom et al., 2016) . These data underline that the GFP-CBX2 fusion protein is incorporated into a fully functional PRC1 complex. Next, we studied the localization of GFP-CBX2 in untreated and heat shocked cord blood CD34 + cells. Whereas GFP-CBX2 was homogenously distributed throughout the nucleus in untreated cells, cells that received a HS (30 min, 44\u02daC) displayed strong accumulations of GFP-CBX2 in subnuclear domains, both in cells that were fixed after HS ( Figure 1B ) and living cells ( Figure 1C) . Similarly, K562 leukemic cells also showed HS-induced relocalization of GFP-CBX2 to subnuclear domains ( Figure 1-figure supplement 2A) . Transmission images suggested that HS induces relocalization of GFP-CBX2 to nucleoli, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence analyses using antibodies against the nucleolar proteins NPM1 and Fibrillarin ( Figure 1D and Figure 1 -figure supplement 2B-D). GFP-CBX2 localized directly around Fibrillarin, which is confined to the dense fibrillar component (DFC) of the nucleolus, and partially colocalized with the granular component (GC) protein NPM1. Taken together, these data suggest that GFP-CBX2 is most enriched in the granular component of the nucleolus (Boisvert et al., 2007) . The kinetics of HS-induced nucleolar accumulation of GFP-CBX2 were both dependent on the duration and temperature of the HS ( Figure 1E and Figure 1 -figure supplement 2E-F). Cells exposed to a temperature of 42\u02daC also displayed nucleolar localization of GFP-CBX2 albeit with slower kinetics.",

Indeed, all these CBX paralogs displayed HS-induced nucleolar accumulation ( Figure 1F and Figure 1 continued on next page G). Importantly, using immunofluorescence, we also observed nucleolar accumulation of endogenous CBX4 upon HS, both in K562 and HL60 cells ( Figure 1H and Figure 1 -figure supplement 2G). Based on these data, we hypothesized that a common domain in these proteins is sufficient for HS-induced nucleolar accumulation. Since the homology between these various CBX proteins is confined to the chromodomain (N-terminus) and Pc box (C-terminus), we generated GFP-CBX2 and GFP-CBX8 fusions only containing the chromobox (GFP-CBX2 [2-63]) or the chromobox and AT hook (GFP-CBX2 [2-96]) ( Figure 1-figure supplement 3A) . Strikingly, all generated truncated GFP-CBX fusion proteins displayed nucleolar localization after HS, suggesting the presence of the chromodomain is sufficient to induce nucleolar localization after HS (Figure 1-figure supplement 3B ). The kinetics of HS-induced relocalization of truncated CBX proteins were slightly slower, suggesting that also non-homologous peptide stretches in CBX proteins contribute to nucleolar relocalization.",

This observation was confirmed by fixing nucleoli and subsequent counterstaining with DAPI ( Figure 2D ). Next, we performed western blot analysis on isolated cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic and nucleoli fractions from GFP-CBX8 cells, which confirmed the presence of the nucleolar marker Fibrillarin in the nucleoli fraction and clearly showed an increase of GFP-CBX8 in the nucleolar fraction after HS ( Figure 2E ). To analyze changes in the localization of endogenous PRC1 subunits, we isolated nucleoli from wild-type K562 cells and similarly performed western analysis of the cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic and nucleoli fractions ( Figure 2F ). Also here Fibrillarin was prominently found in the nucleolar fraction and beta-actin was confined to the cytoplasmic fraction. Clearly, both endogenous CBX4 and CBX8 were enriched in the nucleolar fraction after HS. In addition, also endogenous RING1B levels were slightly elevated in the nucleolar fraction after HS. To validate these results in an independent cell line, we analyzed cellular fractions isolated from HL60 cells ( Figure 2G ). Also here, we observed a robust shift of endogenous CBX4, CBX8 and RING1B to the nucleolus after HS.",

It has been known that one of the most dramatic morphological changes in heat treated nuclei is the swelling of nucleoli (Welch and Suhan, 1986) . Whereas initially considered as heat-induced damage, several lines of independent observations have suggested that this might rather reflect a regulated, HSP-dependent process in which the nucleolus serves as a temporal storage site for unfolded proteins during proteotoxic stress (Nollen et al., 2001; Ohtsuka et al., 1986; Welch and Feramisco, 1984) . In line with this hypothesis, we also found that both HSP70 and DNAJB1 are accumulating in the nucleolus after HS ( Figure 2G ), which is in agreement with earlier Figure 1 continued CBX2 at continuous exposure at 42\u02daC or 44\u02daC.

In total, we identified 1279 proteins, and the nucleolar proteins NPM1 and Fibrillarin were among the most abundant proteins ( . Interestingly, proteins enriched in the nucleolus after HS associated with GO terms related to chromatin modification, gene expression, DNA repair, histone ubiquitination and protein refolding ( Figure 3B ). Consistent with our IF and biochemical fractionation data, various PRC1 subunits, including CBX2, RING1A, RING1B and PHC2 were significantly enriched in the nucleolus upon HS ( Figure 3C and Figure 3 -figure supplement 2B). Intriguingly, we also found that PRC2 subunits EZH2, SUZ12 and EED were enriched ( Figure 3C and Figure 3 -figure supplement 2B) and this HS-induced nucleolar accumulation of EZH2 and SUZ12 was confirmed using western blot analysis on nucleolar fractions isolated from K562 or HL60 cells ( Figure 3D ). HS-induced nucleolar accumulation of EZH2 was independently confirmed using immunofluorescence analyses in K562 cells, HL60 cells, and primary non-transformed CD34 + mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (mPBSCs) (Figure 3-figure supplement 3A-C). Intra-nucleolar levels of H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub were not increased in heat shocked cells versus untreated cells, suggesting that PcG proteins are not involved in Polycomb-mediated silencing of nucleolar chromatin ( Figure 3E ). In addition to these PcG proteins, many other chromatin and transcription regulating proteins were found to be enriched in the nucleolus after HS, including members of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) family and the FACT chromatin remodeling complex that both can remodel chromatin (Marfella and Imbalzano, 2007; Winkler and Luger, 2011) , and the PAF complex, which regulates release of RNAPII into processive elongation (Van Oss et al., 2017) ( Figure 3F and Figure 3 -figure supplement 2C). In addition, accumulation of BRD proteins and JMJD6 was observed in the nucleolus after HS ( Figure 3G and Figure 3 -figure supplement 2D). BRD4 and JMJD6 are co-bound to enhancers and regulate promoter-proximal pause-release of RNAPII (Liu et al., 2013) . Taken together, these data show that HS induces strong shifts of various chromatin and transcription regulators toward the nucleolus.",

Combined with our observations that many chromatin remodeling and transcription regulatory proteins accumulate in the nucleolus after HS, these data prompted us to speculate that such HS-induced redistributions may severely impact on the chromatin bound fraction of various epigenetic regulators. To analyze changes in PRC1 complex chromatin binding upon HS we performed ChIP-qPCRs in K562 cells expressing PcG GFP-fusion proteins and validated PRC1 binding to PcG target genes. Indeed, upon HS (1 hr, 44\u02daC) we observed a strong reduction in chromatin binding of GFP-CBX2, BMI1-GFP, MEL18-GFP and, to a lesser extent, GFP-RING1B ( Figure 4A ). To investigate how HS impacts on chromatin binding of endogenous PRC1 subunits, we performed ChIPs using an antibody directed against endogenous CBX8, and also here we observed a quick reduction in CBX8 binding to Polycomb target genes after HS ( Figure 4B ). Moreover, in line with our LC-MS/MS data, ChIP analysis using an antibody directed against the PRC2 subunit EZH2 also clearly showed a loss of endogenous EZH2 binding from target genes after HS, confirming that both PRC1 and PRC2 show strongly reduced chromatin binding after HS ( Figure 4C) .",

            "text": "To investigate how this may functionally impact on PRC1/2-deposited epigenetic marks, we analyzed H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 levels at PcG target genes. Previous studies have shown that HS induces a rapid but reversible loss of ubiquitinated histones Mimnaugh et al., 1997) . Indeed, we also observed a strong decrease in H2AK119ub levels after HS ( Figure 4D ). In addition, H3K27me3 levels were also significantly reduced in heat-shocked cells vs. control cells ( Figure 4E ). These data show that HS not only causes displacement of PRC1/2 complexes but also leads to a reduction of their respective epimarks. To assay HS-induced loss of PRC1 chromatin binding in a genome-wide manner, we performed ChIP-seq of both endogenous CBX8 (K562 cells) and GFP-CBX2 (K562 GFP-CBX2 cells) in untreated cells or after HS. Heat maps and band plots of CBX8 Clearly, also here a loss of CBX8 and GFP-CBX2 chromatin association is observed upon HS. TSS-localized peaks are associated to genes enriched for development-related GO terms, confirming that these are Polycomb target genes ( Figure 4H) . Typical examples of chromatin regions that show a reduction of CBX8 or GFP-CBX2 chromatin binding are shown in Figure 4I . Next, we analyzed HS-induced changes of other epigenetic modifications. Here we find that, in addition to loss of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3, after HS (1 hr, 44\u02daC) also H3K4me3 levels are reduced, and, likely as a consequence of H3K4me3 loss, H3K4me1 levels are increased ( Figure 4J ). The increase in H3K4me1 levels argues that loss of epimarks is not a mere consequence of decreased nucleosome occupancy but truly a consequence of changes in the epigenetic marking of the chromatin. Finally, we investigated whether the HS-induced loss of PRC1/2-associated epimarks also resulted in loss of silencing of Polycomb target genes. Indeed, we found that the expression of various Polycomb target genes was increased 3 hr after HS, and recovered to pre-HS levels afterwards ( Figure 4K ). Taken together, these data show that, in parallel to the reallocation of chromatin remodelers and transcriptional regulators to the nucleolus, HS induces a quick reduction in PRC1 and PRC2 chromatin binding and changes in the epigenetic profile of PcG target genes with consequences for the transcriptional state of these genes.",

            "text": "Heat-shock proteins modulate CBX protein recovery We next asked whether the HS-induced allocation of PcG proteins to nucleoli serves to allow for a quick recovery of the epigenetic modifiers to restore chromatin binding of epigenetic regulators and associated changes in the epigenetic landscape after heat shock. In addition, we argued that the coappearance of HSPs in these nucleoli may be required to recover these regulators from their solidlike, aggregated state. Certain mammalian HSPs have been demonstrated to be able to disentangle protein aggregates (Mogk et al., 2018; Nillegoda et al., 2018) , including the HSPs (DNAJB1 and HSP70) that we identified as part of the nucleolar proteome after heat shock ( Figure 3H ). To test the reversibility of nucleolar GFP-CBX2 accumulations after HS, we treated K562 GFP-CBX2 cells with a HS (30 min, 44\u02daC) and monitored GFP-CBX2 localization at 37\u02daC afterwards. Clearly, within 3 hr after HS the GFP-CBX2 nucleolar accumulations dispersed and GFP-CBX2 regained its original pan-nuclear distribution ( Figure 6A) , showing that nucleolar accumulations of PcG proteins are readily reversible. Similarly, and in line with our cellular fraction data and LC-MS/MS data, we also observed a reversible HS-induced nucleolar accumulation of DNAJB1 ( Figure 6-figure supplement  1A ). In addition, also HSP70 showed post-HS nuclear translocation, and localized to the nucleolus in a reversible fashion ( Figure 6-figure supplement 1B) . Accumulation of HSP70 in the nucleolus was not as prominent as observed for DNAJB1, which is in line with our LC-MS/MS data, and may be a consequence of other nuclear activities of HSP70. Next, we investigated whether drug-induced inhibition of the HSP70 machinery using the HSP70 inhibitor VER-155008 would impact on the relocalization of PcG proteins to the nucleolus or would delay recovery of GFP-CBX2 from the nucleolus after HS. Clearly, post-HS nucleolar accumulation was not impaired upon HSP70 inhibition, suggesting that the HSP70 machinery is not involved in chaperoning PcG proteins to the nucleolus after HS ( Figure 6B ). However, HSP70 inhibition led to a clear delay in recovery of GFP-CBX2 from the nucleoli suggesting that HSP70 activity is required to resolve the nucleolar accumulation of GFP-CBX2 ( Figure 6B and C) . Similarly, a partial knockdown of HSPA1A, an abundant heat-inducible HSP70 family member in human cells and identical to HSPA1B at the protein level, resulted in a significant delay of GFP-CBX2 recovery from the nucleoli in HEK293T GFP-CBX2 cells ( Figure 6 -figure supplement 1C-E). Next, we investigated whether induction of endogenous HSPs accelerates GFP-CBX2 recovery after HS. K562 GFP-CBX2 cells were treated with two consecutive HSs with a 3-hr interval ( Figure 6D ). HS is known to induce HSP expression (including several HSP70s), resulting in a period of increased thermotolerance. This cellular property allowed us to compare the kinetics of GFP-CBX2 recovery in the presence of basal or HS-induced HSP levels. Indeed, whereas recovery of GFP-CBX2 after the first HS required almost 3 hr, recovery after the second HS was almost completed within 30 min ( Figure 6E and F) . Importantly, the amount of GFP-CBX2 that initially accumulated during the first or second HS did not change dramatically ( Figure 6E and F). This implies that increased HSP levels specifically affect the recovery of GFP-CBX2 proteins from the solid phase within the nucleolus. Next, we tested whether the kinetics of recovery of GFP-CBX2 from the nucleolus and epigenetic recovery after HS were similar. Indeed, we found that H2AK119ub was completely recovered at 4 hr after HS, whereas H3K27me3 recovery was slightly delayed ( Figure 6G ). At later time points after HS we observed a complete recovery of GFP-CBX2 and various epigenetic modifications ( Figure 6-figure supplement 2A) . Interestingly, H2AK119ub recovery was strongly dependent on HSP protein expression. Thermotolerant cells that received a second HS displayed a much faster recovery of H2AK119ub compared to cells after the first HS ( Figure 6H ). In line with our ChIP-qPCR data, H3K27me3 was also reduced albeit with slower kinetics. Both HSP70 and DNAJB1 were strongly induced upon the first HS, whereas EZH2 and CBX8 protein levels were rather stable or slightly reduced. Next, we investigated whether post-HS H2AK119ub recovery is dependent on Polycomb proteins that are recovered from the nucleolus and not merely on newly translated Polycomb proteins. Therefore, we pre-treated K562 cells for 1 hr with cycloheximide or DMSO and studied H2AK119ub recovery after HS. Importantly, H2AK119ub recovery did not depend on de novo protein synthesis as H2AK119ub levels also recovered in cycloheximide-treated cells ( Figure 6 -figure supplement 2B). Taken together, these data show that molecular chaperones are crucial for recovery of GFP-CBX2 from the nucleolus and that this activity is essential for epigenetic recovery after HS ( Figure 6I ).",

At the same time, this 'storage' may allow for rapid recovery of proteins to re-initiate the crucial processes they are normally engaged in. For the nucleolus, these experiments have been done with reporter proteins, without any direct connection to physiological cellular processes. Despite this drawback, these studies revealed that HS-induced redistribution to the nucleolus is important for both refolding (Nollen et al., 2001) or degradation (Park et al., 2013) of these reporters. Our data are the first to show that numerous endogenous chromatin regulators temporarily accumulate in the nucleolus upon a HS, and, in an HSP70-dependent manner, fully and functionally recover to the chromatin upon return to physiological temperatures.",

            "text": "At this stage, we do not know what drives the association of the various PcG proteins to the nucleolus upon HS. Given the protein denaturation effects of HS, (partial) protein unfolding is likely a key driver of protein relocalization to the nucleolus. Whether it is unfolding of nucleolar proteins that cause retention of PcG proteins or actually partial unfolding of PcG proteins (or both) remains to be elucidated. Data from Audas and colleagues showed that a ncRNA, arising from intergenic stretches in between ribosomal DNA repeats, is capable of sequestering and immobilizing various proteins in the nucleolus upon acidosis or HS (Audas et al., 2012) . Alternatively or in parallel, heat-unfolded nuclear reporter proteins (Nollen et al., 2001) or cytosolic proteins (Park et al., 2013) have been reported to accumulate in the nucleolus via chaperoned transport. Whilst we cannot exclude this possibility here, the appearance of PcG proteins in the nucleolus were independent of the HSP70 machinery. However, like in other studies (Nollen et al., 2001; Welch and Feramisco, 1984) , we did find significant enrichment of HSP70 family members, and co-chaperones such as DNAJB1 and HSPB1, in the nucleolus after HS. We also show that both HSPA1A/HSP70 knockdown and inhibiting HSP70 activity result in a significant delay of GFP-CBX2 recovery from the nucleolus, whereas elevated HSP70 expression accelerates the reallocation of PcG proteins to the chromatin. Whereas the nucleolus is a membrane-less organelle with liquid-like properties (Brangwynne et al., 2011; Marko, 2012) , our finding that post-HS GFP-CBX2 accumulations are 1,6-hexanediol insensitive, suggest that it is present in the nucleolus in a more solid phase. This could relate to the requirement of an active HSP70 machinery for its re-solubilization upon recovery. In fact, both HSP70 and DNAJB1 that accumulate in the nucleolus are crucial components of chaperone machines with protein disaggregation power capable of functionally solubilizing proteins (Mogk et al., 2018; Nillegoda et al., 2018) . It is important to note that the functional recovery of epigenetic control was not dependent on de novo synthesis of the PcG proteins. Translation inhibition did not interfere with this H2AK119ub recovery, suggesting that a least a large fraction of nucleolar PcG proteins are re-solubilized and functionally refolded. In addition, a fraction of the nucleolar accumulated proteins may be targeted for proteasomal degradation supported by the HS-induced nucleolar enrichment of the 26S proteasome that we found. In line with these data, a link between the proteasome and the nucleolus was previously suggested and proteasome inhibition leads to nucleolar accumulation of the proteasome (Arabi et al., 2003; F\u00e1tyol and Grummt, 2008; Latonen et al., 2011) .",

However, whereas HS mainly induced accumulation of proteins in the nucleolus, transcription inhibition using actinomycin D resulted in a release of ribosomal proteins and RNA processing factors and an increase of snRNP proteins (Andersen et al., 2005) . In contrast, treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which similarly to HS leads to proteotoxic stress, led to an increase in ribosomal proteins in the nucleolus (Andersen et al., 2005) .

Our data suggests that HS-induced redistribution of PcG proteins to the nucleolus has direct implications for histone marking and is not limited to H2AK119ub, but also affects H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 levels at PcG target genes. Other studies have also shown HS-induced loss of H3K27Ac from HS-repressed enhancers (Chen et al., 2017) and changes in the 3D chromatin structure and epigenetic landscape in Drosophila cells (Li et al., 2015) . In this latter study, the authors observed a moderate localization of the Drosophila Polycomb (Pc) protein to the nucleolus upon HS. Although ribosomal DNA transcription in the nucleolus was strongly reduced upon HS, Pc binding to ribosomal DNA repeats was not increased, suggesting that Pc is not involved in repressing ribosomal DNA transcription (Li et al., 2015) . Whereas our HS-induced CBX protein accumulation in the nucleolus is more robust, we did not observe an increase in rDNA binding by CBX8 (data not shown). We also did not find increased H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub levels in the nucleolus after HS suggesting that accumulating PRC1 and PRC2 subunits are functionally inactive. Together these findings contradict a hypothetical chromatin regulatory activity of PRC1/2 in the nucleolus after HS but rather suggest that their respective subunits are undergoing protein quality control.",

Despite the fact that the majority of epimarks may be properly reinstalled, mistakes will result in epigenetic scars, which may contribute to cellular transformation, loss of cell function and ultimately cell death. Various studies have shown that alterations in transcriptional and epigenetic regulation are major contributors to aging-associated loss of cellular function (Booth and Brunet, 2016) . Based on our data, it is tempting to speculate that cellular-stress-induced epigenetic changes may contribute to age-associated epigenetic alterations. Importantly, it has been shown that the molecular chaperone system of a cell displays age-associated functional decline (Klaips et al., 2018; Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015) .",

We propose a model where HS leads to loss of chromatin binding and nucleolar accumulation of PcG proteins and various other epigenetic regulators, likely as a consequence of protein unfolding. Loss of PcG chromatin binding leads to a loss of PRC1/2-related epigenetic modifications which recovery depends on HSP70 activity in the nucleolus. ",

Error bars indicate the mean \u00b1 range calculated from independent microscopical images (n = 2; total cell number 50-90). Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test, *p<0.05, **p<0.01. Similar results were obtained in independent experiments. (D) Experimental design of thermotolerance experiment. (E) Representative images of K562 GFP-CBX2 cells fixed at indicated time points according to panel D. Scale bar represents 25 mm. (F) Quantification of percentage of K562 GFP-CBX2 cells with nucleolar accumulations at time points according to panel D. Error bars indicate the mean \u00b1 SD calculated from independent microscopical images (n = 5; total cell number 230-350). (G) ChIP-qPCR analyses of H2AK119ub, H3K27me3, GFP-CBX2 and endogenous EZH2 levels at the TCF21 locus in K562 GFP-CBX2 cells, either untreated or cross-linked at indicated time-points after a heat shock (30 min, 44\u02daC). Error bars represent mean \u00b1 range (n = 2, independent replicates, *p<0.05 and **p<0.01).(H) Western blot analysis of H2AK119ub, H3K27me3, HSP70, DNAJB1, EZH2, CBX8 and b-ACTIN levels in K562 GFP-CBX2 cells samples isolated at indicated time points according to panel D. (I) Schematic representation of the effects of heat shock on PRC1/2 chromatin binding and epigenetic marks. Protein quality control in the nucleolus leads to refolding of Polycomb proteins, resulting in reinstallation of epigenetic modifications at Polycomb target genes. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.45205.016 The following figure supplements are available for figure 6: Figure supplement 1. GFP-CBX2, DNAJB1 and HSP70 show comparable HS-induced relocalization kinetics and post-HS GFP-CBX2 recovery is delayed upon HSP70 knockdown. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.45205.017 Figure supplement 2. HS-induced epigenetic changes are reversible and H2AK119ub recovery is not dependent on de novo protein synthesis.
