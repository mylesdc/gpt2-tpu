Although they have been used as probes for chito-oligosaccharides, their detailed specificities remain to be investigated. In this study, we analyzed six chitin-binding lectins, DSA, LEL, PWM, STL, UDA, and WGA, by quantitative frontal affinity chromatography. Some novel features were evident: WGA showed almost comparable affinity for pyridylaminated chitotriose and chitotetraose, while LEL and UDA showed much weaker affinity, and DSA, PWM, and STL had no substantial affinity for the former. WGA showed selective affinity for hybrid-type N-glycans harboring a bisecting GlcNAc residue. UDA showed extensive binding to high-mannose type N-glycans, with affinity increasing with the number of Man residues. DSA showed the highest affinity for highly branched N-glycans consisting of type II LacNAc (N-acetyllactosamine). Further, multivalent features of these lectins were investigated by using glycoconjugate and lectin microarrays. The lectins showed substantial binding to immobilized LacNAc as well as chito-oligosaccharides, although the extents to which they bound varied among them. WGA showed strong binding to heavily sialylated glycoproteins. The above observations will help interpret lectin-glycoprotein interactions in histochemical studies and glyco-biomarker investigations.",

This classification is analogous to that of galectins forming a large group of animal lectins (e.g., \"proto type\" consisting of a single carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) such as galectin-1, 2 and 7, \"tandem-repeat type\" consisting of multiple CRDs such as galectin-4, 8 and 9, and \"chimera type\" consisting of a CRD and a non-CRD structural domain such as galectin-3 [16] ). With regard to the binding specificity of chitin-binding lectins, WGA is known to bind heavily sialylated glycans [17, 18] and tomato lectin (LEL) preferentially binds to repeated structures of N-acetyllactosamine (poly-LacNAc) [19, 20] . However, details of the glycan-binding specificity of these chitin-binding lectins are not known, even though they are well-known plant lectins.",

WGA is extensively used as a Van Damme has proposed the categorization of the known plant lectins, including chitin-binding lectins, into three groups: merolectin, horolectin, and chimerolectin. Further, superlectin was designated as a special group of chimerolectin [15] . This classification is analogous to that of galectins forming a large group of animal lectins (e.g., \"proto type\" consisting of a single carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) such as galectin-1, 2 and 7, \"tandem-repeat type\" consisting of multiple CRDs such as galectin-4, 8 and 9, and \"chimera type\" consisting of a CRD and a non-CRD structural domain such as galectin-3 [16] ). With regard to the binding specificity of chitin-binding lectins, WGA is known to bind heavily sialylated glycans [17, 18] and tomato lectin (LEL) preferentially binds to repeated structures of N-acetyllactosamine (poly-LacNAc) [19, 20] . However, details of the glycan-binding specificity of these chitin-binding lectins are not known, even though they are well-known plant lectins.",

In contrast, STL isolated from the plant tuber potato and DSA isolated from the seed of thornapple (Solanaceae) are more complex and categorized as a chimera-type lectin, both of which contain four hevein domain repeats and an extensin-like domain, the latter of which is located between two N-terminal hevein domains and two C-terminal domains, the function of which is not known [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . LEL isolated from the fruit of tomato (Solanaceae) also belongs to a chimera-type lectin, comprised of a single and three hevein domain repeats in the N-and C-terminus of the dimer, respectively, and an extensin-like domain in between, unlike STL and DSA [44, 45] (Figure 1) .",

Further analysis by a lectin microarray, where 43 commercial lectins, including the six chitin-binding lectins, are immobilized [50, 51] , was performed by probing with a serum glycoprotein, fetuin (FET), both before and after sialidase treatment to examine how the signal patterns are changed on the chitin-binding lectins.

However, their affinities were almost the same regardless of the chain length, unlike other oligomers (described in detail below). 004  005  006  007  008  009  010  011  012  013  014  015  016  017  052  101  102  103  104  105  107  108  201  202  203  301  302  304  305  307  308  313  314  323  401  402  403  404  405  406  410  418  419  420  501  502  503  504  506  601  602  701  702  703  704  705  706  707  708  709  710  711  712  713  715  716  717  718  719  720  721  722  723  724  725  726  727  728  729  730  731  732  733  734  735  736  737  738  739  901  902  903  905  906  907  908  909  910  911  913  914  915  918  919  920  921  927  928  929  930  936 004  005  006  007  008  009  010  011  012  013  014  015  016  017  052  101  102  103  104  105  107  108  201  202  203  301  302  304  305  307  308  313  314  323  401  402  403  404  405  406  410  418  419  420  501  502  503  504  506  601  602  701  702  703  704  705  706  707  708  709  710  711  712  713  715  716  717  718  719  720  721  722  723  724  725  726  727  728  729  730  731  732  733  734  735  736  737  738  739  901  902  903  905  906  907  908  909  910  911  913  914  915  918  919  920  921  927  928  929  930  936 004  005  006  007  008  009  010  011  012  013  014  015  016  017  052  101  102  103  104  105  107  108  201  202  203  301  302  304  305  307  308  313  314  323  401  402  403  404  405  406  410  418  419  420  501  502  503  504  506  601  602  701  702  703  704  705  706  707  708  709  710  711  712  713  715  716  717  718  719  720  721  722  723  724  725  726  727  728  729  730  731  732  733  734  735  736  737  738  739  901  902  903  905  906  907  908  909  910  911  913  914  915  918  919  920  921  927  928  929  930  936 004  005  006  007  008  009  010  011  012  013  014  015  016  017  052  101  102  103  104  105  107  108  201  202  203  301  302  304  305  307  308  313  314  323  401  402  403  404  405  406  410  418  419  420  501  502  503  504  506  601  602  701  702  703  704  705  706  707  708  709  710  711  712  713  715  716  717  718  719  720  721  722  723  724  725  726  727  728  729  730  731  732  733  734  735  736  737  738  739  901  902  903  905  906  907  908  909  910  911  913  914  915  918  919  920  921  927  928  929  930  936 003  004  005  006  007  008  009  010  011  012  013  014  015  016  017  052  101  102  103  104  105  107  108  201  202  203  301  302  304  305  307  308  313  314  323  401  402  403  404  405  406  410  418  419  420  501  502  503  504  506  601  602  701  702  703  704  705  706  707  708  709  710  711  712  713  715  716  717  718  719  720  721  722  723  724  725  726  727  728  729  730  731  732  733  734  735  736  737  738  739  901  902  903  905  906  907  908  909  910  911  913  914  915  918  919  920  921  927  928  929  930  936  937   I  II  III  IV  V Figure 3 , whereas the Roman numerals at the top represent types of glycans, i.e., high-mannose-type (I), agalacto-type (II), asialo-type (III), sialo-type (IV) N-glycans, glycolipid-type glycans (V), and others (VI). For oligosaccharide structures and specifications of the lectin columns, see Figure 3 and Table 1 (43 \u00b5M) . It was also evident that Lewis-type fucosylation abolished DSA binding to type II LacNAc by comparison between triantennary 313 and 419 (N.D.), and between tetraantennary 323 (4.0 \u00b5M) and 420 (5.2 \u00b5M), though the effect of Le x inclusion was less dominant in the latter. This feature was more evident for glycolipid-type glycans 724 (LNnT, 91 \u00b5M) vs. 726 (Le x , N.D.). DSA affinity appeared to be attributed to the number of intact type II LacNAc units.",

However, as noted above, LEL showed much stronger affinity for both chito-oligosaccharides (906 and 907) and oligo-LacNAc (901, 902, 903, and 905) than DSA. When the affinities of LEL for 901, 902, 903, and 905 were compared, it was evident that LEL affinity increased with the increasing number of LacNAc units: 901 (N.D.) < 902 (39 \u00b5M) < 903 (10 \u00b5M) < 905 (2.9 \u00b5M). DSA showed a similar tendency, but affinities to these oligo-LacNAc structures are relatively low; i.e., 901 (87 \u00b5M) < 902 (48 \u00b5M) < 903 (43 \u00b5M) < 905 (17 \u00b5M). Thus, LEL appears to work as a good probe for detecting oligo-or poly-LacNAc chains in N-, O-glycans, or glycolipids. On the other hand, affinities for these oligosaccharides were low for WGA and UDA, and not detectable for PWM and STL, though previous papers report that PWM bound to poly-LacNAc chains with a GlcNAc\u03b21-6Gal branched structure, which is the result of I-GlcNAc transferase action [64] .",

However, the binding was particularly evident in LEL, STL, and WGA. Notably, STL binding to this disaccharide was more selective than the other lectins. Considering that Gal\u03b11-3LacNAc, to which STL bound most strongly, is a xeno-antigen, and thus absent in human-derived samples, it may be a good probe for LacdiNAc structures in clinical samples in place of conventional Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA), which binds to both \u03b1and \u03b2-GalNAc [74] . WFA also binds strongly to glycoproteins, which have highly branched N-glycans such as asialo-\u03b11-acid glycoprotein (asialo-AGP) to which STL bound weakly (B20) (Figure 7) . Only WGA showed extensive, but rather selective binding toward O-glycans (not available in Figure 3  except core 1, 911) ; i.e., strong binding was found to core 6 (GlcNAc\u03b21-6GalNAc\u03b11-PAA; C16), core 4 (GlcNAc\u03b21-3(GlcNAc\u03b21-6)GalNAc\u03b11-PAA; C14), and core 2 {Gal\u03b21-3(GlcNAc\u03b21-6)GalNAc\u03b11-PAA; C12}. WGA apparently recognizes GlcNAc\u03b21-6-terminated O-glycans, because no binding was observed to core 1 (Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc\u03b11-PAA; C11) and core 8 (Gal\u03b11-3Gal\u03b11-PAA; C17) disaccharides and only weak binding to core 3 (GlcNAc\u03b21-3GalNAc\u03b11-PAA; C13) . WGA also bound to Tn antigen (GalNAc\u03b1-PAA; C10) and its anomer GalNAc\u03b2-PAA (B15), but to a much lesser extent compared with GlcNAc\u03b2-PAA (B23) and its 6-sulfo form ([6S]GlcNAc\u03b2-PAA; B24). WGA bound strongly to a glycolipid-type, Forssman disaccharide (GalNAc\u03b11-3GalNAc\u03b2-PAA; C15; 717 in Figure 3 ).",

However, DSA and UDA bound almost exclusively to TG (B4). This may reflect the difference in sialylation; FET contains sialylated triantennary N-glycans as the main components and AGP contains sialylated tri and tetraantennary N-glycans, while TF is composed of sialylated biantennary and TG contains high-mannose-type N-glycans in addition to biantennary complex-type and hybrid-type N-glycans. DSA, PWM, and UDA binding to TG (B4) may in part be attributed to binding to high-mannose-type N-glycans, which is consistent with FAC results. Other lectins (LEL and STL) also bound to TG (B4) but to a much lesser extent. Although these lectins did not show significant affinity for sialylated glycans in FAC, the observed binding to the glycoconjugate microarray is attributed to a clustering effect involving GlcNAc and/or acetyl group of Neu5Ac, a major component of sialic acid.",

It seems that a common feature of all of the chitin-binding lectins investigated here is that binding to TG was substantially reduced after sialidase treatment. Both WGA and UDA showed significant affinity for these desialylated glycoproteins, though the latter showed much stronger binding to asialo-TG (B22). However, LEL, PWM, and STL showed weak binding to asialo-AGP (B20), asialo-TF (B21), and asialo-TG (B22).

This may be related to the FAC result that UDA shows extensive affinity for high-mannose-type N-glycans.

Possible reasons for discrepancies between the results of FAC and glycoconjugate microarray include the cluster effect evident in the latter method. Lectin immobilization may also alter binding properties in FAC as well as in lectin microarray described below. Moreover, it should also be noted that any array platform is basically different from FAC in that the former is a \"competitive platform\" with a panel of immobilized glycans or lectins, which are reacted in a competitive manner with labeled probes; e.g., Cy3-lectins and glycoproteins. On the other hand, basic specificities of lectins are obtained by FAC using structure-defined purified glycans without any effect of carrier protein and with less effect of clustering of glycans (they are maximally diluted). In this regard, it should also be noted that native glycoproteins consist of considerably heterogeneous glycoforms [75] .",

Conversely, signal intensities of Gal-binding lectins (ECA, BPL, TJA-II, PNA WFA, and SBA) became much stronger after the sialidase treatment, with the exception of RCA120. It is known that RCA120 does not completely lose affinity for Sia\u03b12-6Gal [9] , which is a major linkage of sialic acid in FET [76, 77] . Among the six chitin-binding lectins, signal intensities of DSA, LEL, STL, and UDA were reduced for asialo-FET by approximately 11%, 42%, 34%, and 34%, respectively. However, WGA showed as much as 83% reduction in the observed signal after desialylation. Thus, the effect of sialic acid clustering is significant, but rather modest for most of the chitin-binding lectins under conditions where lectins are immobilized and diluted sialoglycoprotein, such as in FET. However, WGA showed enhanced affinity for FET compared with asialo-FET, similar to that in the glycoconjugate microarray. Therefore, sialic acid clustering is sufficient for WGA recognition at a glycoprotein level (triantennary N-glycans in FET), but not at a liberated glycan level as is the case in FAC analysis.",

            "text": "In this study, six representative chitin-binding lectins belonging to the hevein family were investigated in detail for their sugar-binding properties (for summary, see Table 2 ). However, there are many other chitin-binding lectins, which do not belong to the hevein family [81] . They include LysM (lysin motif), which was initially found in several bacterial autolysin proteins and is often associated with chitinase as a carbohydrate-binding module [82] . Interestingly, LysM also consists of a small number (approximately 50) of amino acids, including evolutionarily conserved disulfide bonds. It seems, however, that binding features to chito-oligosaccharides are fairly different between the two families [81] . Considering both compact and stable structures, chitin-binding lectins are good targets for protein engineering aimed at improving specific properties, which natural lectins lack. More diverse oligosaccharide specificity will be generated by recently developed molecular engineering strategies [83, 84] . Alternatively, tandem-repeat type lectins, such as WGA and UDA, may improve their performance both in terms of binding affinity and specificity by selecting one of their repeating CRDs resulting in a \"homogenous\" tandem-repeat. It is widely believed that individual CRDs, after duplication in the course of evolution, diverge from each other and, thus, their specificities have also diverged. In this context, it is important to identify a CRD responsible for the desired specificity, e.g., affinity for hybrid-type N-glycans containing bisecting GlcNAc in WGA. So far, however, such an approach has never been made with chitin-binding lectins. Future studies necessary for this approach include practical application of naturally and artificially produced chitin-binding lectins in various fields, e.g., medical, material and food sciences. Using the information obtained in these studies will generate more precise and systematic knowledge for lectin utilization in complex life systems.",

The flow rate and column temperature were kept at 0.125 mL/min and 25 \u2022 C, respectively. After equilibration of the columns, either excess volume of PA or pNP-oligosaccharides dissolved in TBS were successively injected into each of the lectin columns. Elution of PA-oligosaccharides (2.5 or 5.0 nM) was monitored by fluorescence (excitation and emission wavelengths of 310 and 380 nm, respectively), while that of pNP-oligosaccharides (2-60 \u00b5M) was monitored by UV adsorption (280 nm). The volume of the elution front (V) of each oligosaccharide was calculated as described previously [46] [47] [48] . V 0 was determined for an appropriate reference substance; i.e., Man\u03b11-6(Man\u03b11-2)Man\u03b21-4GlcNAc\u03b21-4GlcNAc-PA (003) for DSA, LEL, STL, and WGA, Gal\u03b21-4Glc-PA (701) for UDA, and 003 or Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc\u03b21-4Gal\u03b21-4Glc-PA (703) for PWM. Hence, retardation of the elution front of each oligosaccharide, i.e., V \u2212 V 0 , was used for determination of K d values.

Nevertheless, data derived by the present quantitative FAC analysis using structure-defined standard glycans provide key information to solve complex phenomena of biological systems, which include studies using these lectins in histochemical and cell separation studies. Currently, it is not known whether the described characteristics are attributed to differences in overall structural architectures (i.e., proto, chimera, or tandem-repeat) or in amino-acid sequences in CRDs. Detailed structural analysis is necessary to define the sugar-binding specificity of each CRD. Construction of tandem-repeat type homogenous hevein-like domains should lead to the development of a series of artificial chitin-binding lectins with much stronger avidity and much higher specificity.
