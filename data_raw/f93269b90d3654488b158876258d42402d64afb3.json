To identify factors that contribute to rSARS-CoV-DE attenuation, gene expression in cells infected by SARS-CoV with or without E gene was compared. Twenty-five stress response genes were preferentially upregulated during infection in the absence of the E gene. In addition, genes involved in signal transduction, transcription, cell metabolism, immunoregulation, inflammation, apoptosis and cell cycle and differentiation were differentially regulated in cells infected with rSARS-CoV with or without the E gene. Administration of E protein in trans reduced the stress response in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-DE or with respiratory syncytial virus, or treated with drugs, such as tunicamycin and thapsigargin that elicit cell stress by different mechanisms. In addition, SARS-CoV E protein down-regulated the signaling pathway inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1) of the unfolded protein response, but not the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) or activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6) pathways, and reduced cell apoptosis. Overall, the activation of the IRE-1 pathway was not able to restore cell homeostasis, and apoptosis was induced probably as a measure to protect the host by limiting virus production and dissemination. The expression of proinflammatory cytokines was reduced in rSARS-CoV-DE-infected cells compared to rSARS-CoV-infected cells, suggesting that the increase in stress responses and the reduction of inflammation in the absence of the E gene contributed to the attenuation of rSARS-CoV-DE.",

The coronavirus replicase gene is encoded within the 59 two thirds of the genome, and includes two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) named ORF1a and ORF1b. Translation of both ORFs in the cytoplasm of infected cells results in the synthesis of two large polyproteins, pp1b and pp1ab, processed by two viral proteases to yield 16 non structural proteins (nsps) [11, 12] . The nsps are involved in genome replication and transcription of subgenomic mRNAs (sg mRNAs) that encode structural proteins such as the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M), and spike (S), and a set of groupspecific proteins whose sequence and number differ among the different coronavirus species [13] . In the case of SARS-CoV, the group-specific proteins 3a, 6, 7a and 7b, are also structural proteins [14, 15, 16, 17, 18] .",

In addition, enveloped viruses modify and perturb membranes to generate new virus particles. This extensive use of intracellular membranes for virus replication and morphogenesis likely overloads the ER during infection, causing ER stress responses and triggering the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR increases the production of chaperones that facilitate protein folding, promotes the synthesis of lipids that constitute cellular membranes and inhibits translation in order to reduce ER stress [37] . The UPR is mediated by three ER-resident transmembrane proteins that are activated through binding to unfolded proteins: PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1) [38, 39, 40] . Upon activation, PERK dimerizes and autophosphorylates. This protein phosphorylates eIF2a, leading to the inhibition of translation.",

We showed that SARS-CoV E protein influenced the expression of genes associated to stress response, immunoregulation, inflammation, apoptosis, and cell cycle and differentiation. Among these changes, the effect on stress response was most robust, based on both the number of differentially expressed genes regulating this activity and on the extent of the changes observed. This downregulation of the stress response in the presence of gene E was specific as this process was reversed by providing E protein in trans. In addition, we showed that E protein reduced the cellular stress caused by another respiratory virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and two drugs (tunicamycin and thapsigargin) that induce stress by different mechanisms. Furthermore, the presence of E protein reduced the activation of the IRE-1 mediated pathway during the UPR. However, the activation of these signaling pathways in the absence of E protein was not sufficient to reverse the cellular stress induced by rSARS-CoV-DE since infected cells underwent apoptosis. In addition, the absence of E protein increased the expression of the double specificity phosphatases (DUSP)-1 and DUSP-10, and down regulated proinflammatory cytokines such as CCL2 and CXCL2. Therefore, the effect of E protein on the stress response, including the UPR, and on proinflammatory cytokine expression may explain the attenuation of rSARS-CoV-DE in vivo.",

In rSARS-CoV-DE-infected cells, the expression of at least 25 stress response genes was preferentially upregulated, compared to cells infected with rSARS-CoV. E protein supplied in trans reversed the increase in stress response genes observed in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-DE or with respiratory syncytial virus, and by treatment with drugs causing stress by different mechanisms. Furthermore, in the presence of the E protein a subset (IRE-1 pathway), but not two others (PERK and ATF-6), of the unfolded protein response was also reduced. Nevertheless, the activation of the unfolded protein response to control cell homeostasis was not sufficient to alleviate cell stress, and an increase in cell apoptosis in cells infected with the virus lacking E protein was observed. This apoptotic response was probably induced to protect the host by limiting virus production and dissemination. In cells infected with rSARS-CoV-DE, genes associated with the proinflammatory pathway were downregulated compared to cells infected with virus expressing E protein, supporting the idea that a reduction in inflammation was also relevant in the attenuation of the virus deletion mutant.",

To determine whether these cell lines were also susceptible to rSARS-CoV-DE, virus growth kinetics studies were performed. rSARS-CoV-DE passaged 16 times in Vero E6 cells (P16) was analyzed, as this virus grew with titers similar to those of rSARS-CoV, around 10-fold higher than virus passaged only once (P1). rSARS-CoV-DE-P16 contained only a single nucleotide substitution at amino acid 607 of the S gene (S607F) compared to the P1 virus [56] . Both rSARS-CoV-DE P1 and the P16 were attenuated in the highly susceptible transgenic mice model [56] , showing that the deletion of the E gene, and not the amino acid substitution in S protein, was responsible for virus attenuation. All the cell lines indicated above were infected with SARS-CoV with and without E gene at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 1, 3 and 5 and the percentage of infected cells at 24 hours post infection (hpi) was determined using an immunofluorescence assay. Similar results were obtained both in SARS-CoV and rSARS-CoV-DE-infected cells, so only the results obtained with SARS-CoV-infected cells are provided in Supplementary Table SI. An increase in the moi led to a higher proportion of infected cells in all cell lines. The percentage of infected cells was below 40% in all cases, except for African green monkey kidney Vero E6 and MA-104 cells (Supplementary Table S1), which have or do not have, respectively, a defect in interferon (IFN) production [57, 58] . More than 90% of Vero E6 cells were infected with rSARS-CoV-DE or rSARS-CoV at 24 hpi, whereas in the case of MA-104 cells, more than 80% of the cells were infected with both viruses at 24 hpi (Supplementary Table S1 ). The growth kinetics of rSARS-CoV-DE and rSARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells at an moi of 2 showed similar profiles and titers for both viruses, reaching maximum titers and cytopathicity at 15 hpi (Fig. 1A) . In contrast, in the case of MA-104 cells, although growth kinetics for rSARS-CoV-DE and the parental virus were similar, a 10-fold reduction in virus titers was observed in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-DE virus (Fig. 1A) . This difference is not unexpected, as the DE virus that was used in these experiments was passaged and adapted to growth in Vero E6, but not in MA-104 cells. The cytopathic effect in MA-104 cells was evident at 48 hpi and maximum virus titers were reached at 65 hpi (Fig. 1A) . The kinetics of genomic RNA and N gene sg mRNA accumulation were similar in rSARS-CoV-DE and rSARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 and MA-104 cells, as determined by qRT-PCR ( Fig. 1B and 1C ), indicating that SARS-CoV E protein had no influence on the accumulation of viral RNAs. Maximum levels of both types of viral RNA were observed at 15-22 hpi, in the case of infected Vero E6 cells and at 48 hpi in the case of MA-104 cells. These data showed that although Vero E6 and MA-104 cells were susceptible to SARS-CoV, the kinetics of the infection was slower in MA-104 than in Vero E6 cells, which needs to be considered when cellular mRNAs are collected for differential gene expression studies.",

Taking into account the data obtained in Figure 1 , early (7 hpi in the case of Vero E6, and 24 hpi in the case of MA-104 cells), and late (15 and 65 hpi, in Vero E6 and MA-104 cells, respectively) times post-infection (pi), were analyzed. Microarraybased studies of global gene responses were performed in triplicate in each case. As there are no commercially available microarrays specific for African green monkey species, and the sequence homology between humans and monkeys is very high [59] , human U133 plus 2.0 microarrays were used. The results of the microarray analysis have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, NCBI, accession code GSE30589). Only those genes showing significant expression changes (i.e., 2.0-fold and false discovery rate (FDR),0.01) at each time point were selected for further investigation. Comparison of gene expression in cells infected with rSARS-CoV with or without E gene versus mockinfected cells showed that more that 800 cellular genes were differentially expressed at late time post-infection ( Fig. 2) and that the number of genes differentially expressed increased over time (i.e. in the case of Vero E6 cells, 4940 annotated genes for rSARS-CoV versus mock-infected cells at 15 hpi, compared to 1324 annotated genes at 7 hpi; for MA-104 cells, 971 annotated genes for rSARS-CoV versus mock-infected cells at 65 hpi, compared to 11 annotated genes at 24 hpi). Interestingly, the number of annotated genes differentially expressed in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-DE compared to rSARS-CoV, in which the only difference is the expression of E gene, was reduced to 57 (Vero E6 cells) or to 72 (MA-104 cells) at 15 or 65 hpi, respectively (Fig. 2) . These genes were classified according to their most commonly accepted functions (Fig. 3) . A high number of genes related to stress responses (19 out of 57 in Vero E6 cells, and 19 out of 72 in MA-104 cells) were differentially expressed, with 2-to 35-fold increases. The pattern of genes upregulated in rSARS-CoV-DE compared to rSARS-CoV-infected cells was very similar in Vero E6 and MA-104 cells, and included different isoforms of heat shock protein (hsp) (hsps-10, -27, -40, -60, -70, -90 and -105/110), and different genes encoding ubiquitins and chaperonins (Fig. 3) . These data clearly indicated that the cellular stress induced by the infection was significantly reduced in the presence of E protein.",

A summary is shown in Fig. 5 . In contrast, no enriched GO terms were found for genes that were downregulated in MA-104-infected cells. All of the functionally enriched GO terms were related to cellular stress (chaperone binding, response to biotic stimulus, unfolded protein binding, protein folding), cellular death (anti-apoptosis), cellular transport (protein import, nucleocytoplasmic transport), transcription (transcription repressor activity) and metabolism (protein catabolic process, cellular protein catabolic process). Remarkably, similar, highly significant (FDR,0.01) changes in levels of genes related to cellular stress response to biotic stimulus, unfolded protein binding and protein folding were identified in both Vero E6 and MA-104-infected cells (Fig. 5) .",

These data indicated that SARS-CoV E protein alone reduced different types of stress, such as cytosolic (genes hsp90 AA1, UBB, hspH1), ER (gene SERPINH1) and mitochondrial stress (gene hsp10 E1), produced by infection with at least two different respiratory viruses (SARS-CoV and RSV). upregulated more than 10 fold. Green color indicates genes upregulated between 5 and 10 fold, at least in one cell line. For those genes recognized with more than one probe, the value corresponding to the highest upregulation or downregulation is represented. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002315.g003 Coronavirus infection induces ER stress [64] due to the extensive use of intracellular membranes for the generation of replication complexes and for the assembly of virus particles [36, 65] . In addition, viral glycoproteins can induce ER stress during infection as a result of incomplete glycosylation and incorrect folding or accumulation in the ER lumen [66, 67] . Accordingly, we decided to focus our attention on ER stress. To determine whether E protein alone was responsible for the downregulation of the ER stress response, Vero E6 and MA-104 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding SARS-CoV E protein or with empty plasmid as a control. At 24 hpt cell cultures were treated with thapsigargin and tunicamycin, which induce ER stress by altering intracellular Ca ++ levels or by preventing protein glycosylation, respectively [68] , for 8 or 20 h, or left untreated. The levels of E protein were monitored by Western-blot analysis and were similar to E protein levels after SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 (Fig. 9A) or MA-104 cell (data not shown). Total cellular RNAs were collected and the expression of the ER-stress inducible genes GRP78 and GRP94 was evaluated by qRT-PCR. The effect of E protein expression at the times post-induction when upregulation of these genes was highest is shown ( Fig. 9B and C). Treatment with thapsigargin and tunicamycin clearly induced the expression of ER stress genes in Vero E6 and MA-104 cells transfected with the empty plasmid ( Fig. 9B and C) . The expression of GRP78 and GRP94 was significantly reduced in the presence of E protein ( Fig. 9B and C) . No decrease in the expression of polQ gene was observed in the presence of E gene, suggesting that the reduction in the expression of stress related genes was specific ( Fig. 9B and C) . These data indicated that E protein alone was sufficient to reduce cellular stress caused by different mechanisms.",

In this work, to identify possible mechanisms for this attenuation, the effect of E protein on host cell responses during virus infection was analyzed by comparing the transcriptome of rSARS-CoV-DE and rSARS-CoV-infected cells. Among the genes differentially expressed, a large number of genes corresponding to cellular stress were upregulated in rSARS-CoV-DE compared to wt virus infected cells, clearly indicating that the presence SARS-CoV E protein reduced the stress response during infection. Upregulation of the stress response was also confirmed at the protein level, as the expression of representative stress response proteins, such as hsp60 and hsp90 was also increased. The addition of E protein in trans reversed the increase in stress response gene expression observed in rSARS-CoV-DE-infected cells, confirming the specific suppression of the stress response by E protein. Interestingly, levels of E protein were 10-fold lower than those expressed in SARS-CoV-infected cells, but were sufficient to reduce the increase in stress response genes, indicating the robust effect of E protein. In addition, rSARS-CoV-DE titers were not significantly increased by providing E protein in trans, probably due to the low levels of E protein expressed in rSARS-CoV-DE infected cells, indicating that the presence or absence of E protein, and not the amount of virus, was responsible for the increase in stress response and apoptosis. In addition, stress induced by another virus, RSV, was also downregulated by SARS-CoV E protein. Furthermore, expression of E protein in the absence of virus infection reduced stress induced by tunicamycin or thapsigargin. SARS-CoV E protein also inhibited a subset of the stress response. Specifically, E protein inhibited the activation of the XBP-1-mediated pathway of the UPR, and apoptosis induced by SARS-CoV. We have shown that in MA-104 cells infected with rSARS-CoV-DE, two important pro-inflammatory cytokines (CCL2/MCP-1 and CXCL2/macrophage inflammatory protein 2 [MIP-2]) were downregulated, indicating that the E protein reduces virus-induced inflammation.",

Further, it has been shown that SARS-CoV structural proteins S, 6, and 3a [66, 78, 79, 80] , and the accessory protein 8ab [81] induce ER stress responses. Using genomic approaches, the upregulation of stress genes in SARS-CoV-infected Huh-7 [82] , Vero [59] , and blood mononuclear cells [83, 84] has been reported in cell cultures and also in vivo [75, 85] . We show, for the first time, that SARS-CoV E protein limits the stress response elicited by SARS-CoV infection, which probably represents a selective advantage for the virus. In fact, we have shown that rSARS-CoV-DE is cleared faster than rSARS-CoV with E protein [26, 27] . We observed that genes related to hsps were upregulated in rSARS-CoV-DE infected compared to wt virus-infected cells. The presence of hsps on the cell surface facilitates the elimination of infected cells by natural killer (NK) and T cell subsets [32] . Hsps facilitate the presentation of antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I), helping clearance of infected cells by CD8 + T cells [86] .",

Therefore, E protein limited the ER stress caused by the unbalance of ER Ca ++ ion concentrations, and by the inhibition of N-glycosylation leading to the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins.

Only the XBP-1 pathway was significantly activated in cells infected with rSARS-CoV-DE compared to infection with the wt virus. Possibly, the partial activation of the UPR was not sufficient to alleviate cellular stress, and cell apoptosis was induced to help virus clearance [31, 41] . The ectopic expression of coronavirus E protein induces apoptosis in the absence of infection [87, 88] , whereas in this manuscript we describe that the expression of E protein in the context of SARS-CoV infection, limited the levels of apoptosis in infected cells, which may represent an advantage for virus production and dissemination [89] . This is not surprising, as previous experiments were performed in transfected cells and not in the context of viral infection, and as many other viral proteins such as 3C-like protease, spike, membrane, nucleocapsid, 3a, 3b, and 7a (reviewed by Tan et al. in [45] ), and proteins 6, 7b, and 8a [78, 90, 91] also elicit apoptosis. Removal of the E gene from SARS-CoV led to an increase in stress responses and UPR. Nevertheless, the stress and UPR responses were not able to balance the homeostasis of the system and apoptosis was increased as a defense mechanism that may have contributed to the attenuation observed in rSARS-CoV-DE-infected hamsters and mice [26, 27] . Overall, these data indicate that the regulatory influence of E protein on signaling pathways leading to apoptosis still needs further clarification. The control of the stress response and apoptosis by a viral protein has also been observed in infections by human cytomegalovirus, in which the UL38 protein suppresses ER stress-induced death, preventing premature cell death and facilitating efficient virus replication [92, 93] .",

The upregulation of stress genes observed in SARS-CoV-infected cells when the E gene was deleted probably diminished proinflammatory processes, leading to a decrease in pathology [94, 95] . In fact, we have observed that MAPK phosphatases DUSP1 and DUSP10 were upregulated in rSARS-CoV-DE-infected cells when compared to wt virus-infected cells. DUSP proteins are critical regulators of innate immune responses [96] . Using DUSP1 and DUSP10 knock out cell cultures and mice, it has been shown that these genes limit the expression of inflammatory genes such as TNF, IL-6, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3, CCL4 and CXCL2/MIP-2 [60, 97, 98, 99] . Interestingly, we observed a decrease in the expression of CXCL2/MIP-2 and CCL2/MCP-1 in rSARS-CoV-DE infected MA-104 cells compared to wt virus-infected cells, probably contributing to the reduction of lung inflammation that we observed in vivo [26, 27] . In human SARS, increases in IL-6, CCL2/MCP-1 and CXCL10/IP-10 expression were detected in the lungs of human patients with fatal SARS [48, 49, 100] . Furthermore, persistent expression of CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL9/ MIG and CXCL10/IP-10 was observed in the blood of SARS patients with fatal disease [48, 49, 100] , reinforcing the idea that elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines significantly contributes to the pathogenicity of the virus.",

Cellular RNAs were extracted at 15, 22 and 28 (A) and at 24, 48, 65 and 75 (B) hpi, and the expression of cellular mRNAs corresponding to cytosolic, ER and mitochondrial stress was measured by qRT-PCR. Numbers indicate the level of gene expression in rSARS-CoV-DE compared to rSARS-CoV-infected cells. Three independent experiments were analyzed with similar results in all cases. Two commonly used acronyms of each protein are indicated at the bottom of the figure. (TIF) Figure S3 Effect of S607F mutation in S protein on cellular stress responses induced by rSARS-CoV-DE infection. Vero E6 cells were infected with the viruses lacking E gene passaged one or sixteen times (rSARS-CoV-DE-p1 and -p16, respectively) or with rSARS-CoV at an moi of 0.5. Cellular RNAs were extracted at 22 hpi and the expression of cellular mRNAs corresponding to cytosolic, ER and mitochondrial stress genes was measured by qRT-PCR. Numbers indicate the levels of gene expression in rSARS-CoV-DE-p1 or -p16-infected cells compared to rSARS-CoV-infected cells. Three independent experiments were analyzed with similar results in all cases. Two commonly used acronyms of each protein are indicated at the bottom of the figure. (TIF) Figure S4 Effect of SARS-CoV E protein on the stress induced by infection with SARS-CoV. Vero E6 cells infected at an moi of 0.5 with rSARS-CoV-DE-P16, or with SARS-CoV, were transfected with a plasmid expressing E protein (E + ) or with empty plasmid (E 2 ) as a control. At 22 hpi, cellular RNAs were extracted, and the expression of the stress-induced genes hsp10 A1A, hsp90 AA1, hsp H1, SERPIN H1, and hsp10 E1, and that of polQ and 18S rRNA, as controls, was analyzed by qRT-PCR. In each case, the corresponding mRNA expression levels in rSARS-CoV-DE-P16-infected cells were compared to those of rSARS-CoV-infected cells. Standard bars represent standard deviations of the mean of results from three experiments. (TIF) Figure S5 Effect of SARS-CoV E protein on PERK activation. Vero E6 cells were infected at an moi of 2 with rSARS-CoV-DE and rSARS-CoV. Cell extracts were collected at different times post-infection and the levels of the phosphorylated form of PERK, and of GAPDH as a reference control protein were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies specific for these proteins. pPERK levels in rSARS-CoV-DE or rSARS-CoVinfected cells, related to the levels of the housekeeping gene GAPDH are shown.
