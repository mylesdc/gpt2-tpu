            "text": "The high rates of RNA virus evolution are generally attributed to replication with error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. However, these long-term nucleotide substitution rates span three orders of magnitude and do not correlate well with mutation rates or selection pressures. This substitution rate variation may be explained by differences in virus ecology or intrinsic genomic properties. We generated nucleotide substitution rate estimates for mammalian RNA viruses and compiled comparable published rates, yielding a dataset of 118 substitution rates of structural genes from 51 different species, as well as 40 rates of non-structural genes from 28 species. Through ANCOVA analyses, we evaluated the relationships between these rates and four ecological factors: target cell, transmission route, host range, infection duration; and three genomic properties: genome length, genome sense, genome segmentation. Of these seven factors, we found target cells to be the only significant predictors of viral substitution rates, with tropisms for epithelial cells or neurons (P,0.0001) as the most significant predictors. Further, one-tailed t-tests showed that viruses primarily infecting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than neurotropic viruses (P,0.0001 and P,0.001 for the structural genes and non-structural genes, respectively). These results provide strong evidence that the fastest evolving mammalian RNA viruses infect cells with the highest turnover rates: the highly proliferative epithelial cells. Estimated viral generation times suggest that epithelial-infecting viruses replicate more quickly than viruses with different cell tropisms. Our results indicate that cell tropism is a key factor in viral evolvability.",

In 2009, it was estimated that rotavirus infections alone result in $325 million in medical treatment costs and $423 million in societal costs each year [4] .

We also evaluated the relationships of viral substitution rates with dN/dS estimates, experimentally measured mutation rates, and estimated generation times. Though recombination undeniably plays a role in shaping viral evolutionary dynamics and could inflate substitution rate estimates [21, 22] , we conservatively removed any potential recombinants from our datasets prior to analysis. Through this broad analysis, we were able to demonstrate that cell tropism, and its impact on viral generation time, has the greatest influence on rates of mammalian RNA virus evolution.",

Compared to DNA viruses, RNA viruses replicate with much lower fidelity, which can explain why RNA viruses evolve significantly faster than most DNA viruses. However, there is tremendous variation among the evolutionary rates of different RNA viruses, which is not explained by variation in mutation rates. Here we present a survey of mammalian RNA virus rates of evolution, and a comprehensive comparison of these rates to different properties of virus genomic architecture and ecology. We found that cell tropism is the most significant predictor of long-term rates of mammalian RNA virus evolution. For instance, viruses targeting epithelial cells evolve significantly faster than viruses that target neurons. Our results provide mechanistic insight into why viruses that infect respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelia have been difficult to control.

Using a series of onetailed t-tests, we found that viruses that are transmitted through the fecal-oral/respiratory route have significantly higher substitution rates than those transmitted by arthropod vectors (P,0.0001). However, we also compared different cell tropisms within each of these transmission routes. We found that fecal-oral/respiratory transmitted viruses that target epithelial cells have significantly higher substitution rates than those that target other cell types (P,0.0001, Figure 5 ). Similarly, we found that neurotropic arboviruses have significantly lower substitution rates than arboviruses that target other cell types (P,0.001, Figure 5 ).",

Since these two cell types have some of the highest and lowest turnover rates, respectively, of all mammalian cells [33, 34, 35, 36] , we sought to determine if there were any associations between host cell turnover rate and viral generation time. Using the model proposed by Sanju\u00e1n (2012) that relates the long-term substitution rate, K, to the mutation rate, m, correcting for transient deleterious mutations, we were able to estimate generation times for the few viruses with reliable mutation rate estimates. This model, K~ame {bmG , with a~ga%0:27, b( 1{a)=s H %3:744 (G = genome length, g = generation time, s H = harmonic mean of the selection coefficient) [15] , confirmed that influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and poliovirus, which target epithelial cells, have substantially shorter generation times (,40 hours) than hepatitis C virus, which targets hepatocytes (.200 hours). These results, while based on a very limited dataset, provide quantitative evidence for a link between cell tropism and generation time. Shorter average generation times lead to more rounds of replication per year, which could neatly explain higher per-year substitution rates.",

Unfortunately, with the exception of latent viruses, which are most commonly retro-or DNA viruses and thus not within the scope in this study, it can be difficult to classify viruses as acute or persistent. The duration of persistence can vary; most persistent viral infections begin with an acute phase and may occasionally be resolved after only this acute phase (e.g., HCV), and many viruses that predominantly result in acute infections occasionally persist [39, 40] . By classifying the viruses in this study as accurately as possible, we found no significant association between infection mode and substitution rate. However, only three viruses in this study, all endothelial-infecting hantaviruses, were classified as strictly persistent. This causes the nesting of the persistent level with tropism for endothelial cells, and the persistent infection variable was therefore excluded from our analyses. Infection duration could be a factor explaining substitution rate variation across the Baltimore classifications of viruses, but there is no evidence that it affects the mammalian RNA virus substitution rates included in this study. Transmission mode and, less explicitly, host range are frequently invoked as determinants of viral substitution rates [5, 41] . Specifically, plant or animal viruses that primarily rely on arthropod vectors for transmission, and therefore obligately infect very diverse hosts, are thought to evolve more slowly than viruses with other transmission modes [5, 41, 42, 43] . Surprisingly, only one of our 15 ANCOVA analyses implicated transmission route as a significant substitution rate predictor, and we found no significant relationship between substitution rate and host range.",

For example, 25% of the arboviruses in our study are neurotropic, the second-most common cell tropism of our arboviruses (Table S1 ). Therefore, the observation that vector-borne viruses tend to evolve more slowly is qualitatively consistent with our results. Cell tropism does appear to be the more significant factor, though, as our results show that arboviruses with other cell tropisms evolve significantly faster than those with neurotropism. Previous studies have also indicated that phylogenetic relationships are predictive -that sister taxa have similar rates of evolution [5] . We initially included virus families as an explanatory variable in our analyses, but we had to discard it due to high colinearity with these other seven variables (data not shown). Once the virus families were removed, there was no statistically significant colinearity within the structural gene dataset. Of these seven non-colinear factors, cell tropism was the best predictor of viral substitution rates. The smaller nonstructural gene dataset, on the other hand, had significant collinearity among predictor variables that could not be resolved. The NS dataset also had only 1/3 of the taxa, inherently reducing its statistical power. It was not possible to expand the mammalian RNA virus NS dataset at this time; our novel rate analyses increased the number of reliable rates by 40% by exhaustively searching the available sequences in GenBank. The results of the combined dataset were nearly identical to those from the dataset of only S rates, again identifying target cells as the only consistent predictor variables. While many factors likely influence nucleotide substitution rates, and there may be inherent relationships among some of our seven variables, our results affirm that cell tropism is the most significant predictor of mammalian RNA virus substitution rate.",

While positive selection can certainly result in variation among very short-term substitution rates, purifying selection tends to dominate over longer timescales [21, 45, 46, 47] . However, variation is observed in the strength of purifying selection due to differences in host ranges. For instance, as previously mentioned, viruses vectored by arthropods have unique evolutionary constraints placed on them by their host diversity [41, 42, 43, 48] . While previous studies found that arboviruses are under stronger purifying selection than non-arboviruses [1, 41, 49] , we found that the dN/dS estimates based on structural genes of arboviruses were not significantly lower than those for nonarboviruses (P = 0.19). The dN/dS estimates based on nonstructural genes of arboviruses were only moderately lower than those for non-arboviruses (P = 0.04). Further, we found no significant correlation between the estimated dN/dS and substitution rates, suggesting that detectable differences in selection pressures do not explain the variation in substitution rates of mammalian RNA viruses. To date, there are no data supporting a link between cell tropism and sustained differences in selection pressures.",

Weak negative correlations between genome lengths and viral substitution rates have been attributed to a relationship between mutation rate and substitution rate, as smaller genomes could in theory withstand higher mutation rates than larger genomes [13, 15, 50] . However, while differences in spontaneous mutation rates appear to be significantly correlated to the longterm substitution rates of DNA viruses [15] , this linear relationship disappears past a certain mutation rate threshold: around 10 26 mutations per site per infectious cycle, the lower end of the mutation rate range of RNA viruses [13, 15] . It is, therefore, not surprising that we found no significant correlation between substitution rates and the available, reliable mutation rate estimates. Additionally, a recent study of the retrovirus HIV-1 found that infection of different cell types did not lead to differences in mutation rate [51] , providing some evidence that mutation rate is not correlated with cell tropism. Together, these data suggest that mutation rate variation among different cell types is not driving higher substitution rates in epithelial-infecting mammalian RNA viruses.",

For example, viruses in the acute phase of an infection generally replicate more frequently than those in a persistent infection, and viruses in a latent phase do not replicate at all [39] . Further, as an alternative to differential selection pressures, the argument that transmission mode drives viral substitution rates assumes that viruses that can be transmitted more rapidly will have shorter generation times (e.g., horizontal transmission vs. vertical transmission [5, 52, 53] ).",

However, there is evidence that for at least some RNA viruses, viral genome replication is highly dependent on host cell proliferation, with RNA synthesis occurring at much lower rates in poorly proliferating cells than in rapidly dividing cells [56, 57, 58, 59, 60] . For example, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that hepatitis C virus genome replication is enhanced in proliferating cells, perhaps due to higher levels of available nucleotides [59] , or because of higher levels of viral protein synthesis facilitated by nuclear translation initiation factors that only become available in the cytoplasm during cell division [58] . Similar dependence on cell proliferation for viral replication efficiency has been demonstrated in a number of picornaviruses [57, 60, 61, 62] . Further, using the model proposed by Sanju\u00e1n (2012), we found that viruses that infect epithelial cells have generation times that may be as much as 40-fold shorter than a virus that infects non-epithelial cells. This offers a possible mechanistic basis for our finding that viruses that target the fastest-dividing cells in the body (intestinal and respiratory epithelial cells [34, 35, 36, 63] ) have higher substitution rates than viruses that infect cells that turnover at very low rates, if at all (neurons [33, 35, 64] ).",

These results offer a new perspective on why it has been difficult to create effective vaccines for viruses that infect epithelial tissue, such as rotavirus and enterovirus 71 [65, 66] . Further, as it has been shown that higher rates of viral evolution can result in increased genetic diversity and higher epidemiological fitness [26, 67, 68] , the higher substitution rates of epithelial-infecting viruses predict increased evolvability and greater potential for emergence in novel host species [21] .",

            "text": "Long-term nucleotide substitution rates of mammalian RNA viruses were collected from the literature, with a focus on finding rates for the outer structural gene containing the major antigenic site(s) and non-structural (preferably the RdRp) genes. While the RdRp genes of the (-)ssRNA and dsRNA viruses are classified as structural, or virion-associated, genes [69] , they are generally thought to be more conserved and under very different selection pressures than the structural genes that interact with the host immune system [70, 71] . We excluded retroviruses from analysis because they are known to have highly variable substitution rates due to time spent integrated into DNA genomes, where they evolve at the rate of their hosts' genome [13, 72] . Viruses that predominately infect non-mammals, with mammals serving as incidental, dead-end hosts, were also excluded. Only rates estimated for individual viral species or strains were used, not those that aggregated multiple species into one analysis. Similarly, only rates from single gene analyses were included, not those based on full genomes or multiple gene alignments. In order to minimize any rate discrepancies that could result from variations among datasets (e.g., number of taxa, temporal range, portion of gene analyzed) and/or subtle methodological variations [45, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77] , only rates produced by Bayesian coalescent analyses of datasets composed of at least 30 taxa, isolated over a minimum range of 15 years and spanning at least 40% of the analyzed gene were included. Bayesian coalescent analyses provide estimates of viral evolution that are calculated over a longer range than simply the date range over which the taxa were isolated. This is because they determine the likely phylogenetic relationship among the isolates and infer substitution rates over the entire evolutionary history of the sampled taxa: over decades, hundreds, even thousands of years. These rates can therefore be considered ''long-term'' nucleotide substitution rates.",

For each variable, different base levels were tested to ensure that the chosen base level did not significantly influence the results. Collinearity among the variables was also assessed, with variance inflation factors (VIF) greater than 10 indicating redundancy among variables. Separate ANCOVA analyses were run on the structural and non-structural gene datasets. As there were multiple published rates for some viral species and strains, additional analyses were run for both the S and NS datasets with only one substitution rate per virus species.
