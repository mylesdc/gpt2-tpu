            "text": "For the Netherlands, sentinel surveillance case report data from 1970 to 2009 were provided by the National Institute for Health Services Research (NIVEL), and sentinel flu virological type and subtype counts from 1994 to 2009 from the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) [1, 2] . Case report and virological data were collected through the Dutch sentinel general practitioner (GP) network. The sentinel GP network in the Netherlands is nationally representative by age, gender, regional distribution and population density, and the population varied between approximately 106,000 and 134,000 registered patients. ILI incidence is defined as the number of people who consulted their GP with ILI in a week divided by the population of GPs practices which reported the consultation numbers of the same week. ILI cases are defined by fever (\u011b 38.0\u02ddC), sudden onset, and cough, sore throat, running nose, frontal headache, retrosternal chest pain or muscle pain (see also www.nivel.nl/peilstations). The virological data considered here correspond to patients that met ILI case definitions. Both data sets are reported by week, from Monday through Sunday, and information on age, gender and region was neglected in the present study. For For the Netherlands, type and subtype specific case report time series from 1994 to 2009 were estimated with a regression model that relates expected weekly ILI counts to weekly virological type and subtype counts. We found that the variability in the NIVEL case report data is appropriately described under an integer count model, and there was substantial evidence for overdispersion in explaining the spread of the residuals. To exclude multiplicity effects, we used a Negative Binomial model with identity link [3] . The virological surveillance data set includes weekly counts of ILI specimen that tested negative, which allowed us to model the baseline of negative ILI case reports explicitly. Compared to using a smooth, seasonally forced baseline function as is typically done [4, 5] , this approach led to slightly higher estimates of total incidence in winter seasons. This is because the baseline is not constrained to increase in winter seasons. Our initial regression model y t \" NegBinp\u00b5 t , kq \u00b5 t \" \u03b2 0`\u03b21 rA(H1N1) t s`\u03b2 2 rA(H3N2) t s`\u03b2 3 rB t s`\u03b2 4 rRSV t s`\u03b2 5 rNeg t s (S1) consistently overestimates total ILI past 2005, see Figure S1 . We found that this trend coincides with broad changes in relative sampling effort, which we defined as the number of ILI cases per virological specimen count. Figure S1B illustrates broad changes in sampling effort with a lowess fit. To adjust for broad changes in sampling effort, we model high sampling effort in an ad-hoc fashion with a binary variable S h t that equals one if the lowess curve in Figure S1B is above 4.5, and zero otherwise. Thus, a simple way to account for the interaction of the previous covariates with sampling effort is the regression model y t \" NegBinp\u00b5 t , kq \u00b5 t \" \u03b2 0r S h t s\u00b4\u03b2 h 1 rA(H1N1) t s`\u03b2 h 2 rA(H3N2) t s`\u03b2 h 3 rB t s`\u03b2 h 4 rRSV t s`\u03b2 h 5 rNeg t s\u00afr 1\u00b4S h t s\u00b4\u03b2 lw 1 rA(H1N1) t s`\u03b2 lw 2 rA(H3N2) t s`\u03b2 lw 3 rB t s`\u03b2 lw 4 rRSV t s`\u03b2 lw 5 rNeg t s\u00af.",

The difference \u2206 S1,S2 in the Akaike information criteria of models (S1) and (S2) is 93. Thus, accounting for broad changes in sampling effort leads to improved model predictions and improved model fit. While more refined statistical approaches to account for changes in sampling effort are possible in principle, the broad adjustment in terms of a binary categorical variable in model (S2) is sufficient for our purposes, particularly in comparison to the marked differences between estimated H3N2 incidence time series across countries.",

We expect this situation in most phylodynamic applications. Several MCMC and sequential importance sampling algorithms are available to improve computational efficiency [8, 9] . These algorithms must be run for some time, or \"burn-in\", until samples from the ABC target density are generated. Phylodynamic simulations can be time consuming, particularly when the mutation rate is high. To reduce the number of simulations during burn-in, we use an MCMC sampler exactly as the one in Figure 2 , but with a standard annealing scheme on the tolerances \u03c4 k and on the variance of the proposal density that updates at acceptance [10] . We applied the MCMC algorithm in Figure 2 with annealing on the tolerances \u03c4 k and the diagonal covariance matrix of the Gaussian proposal density. Here, the annealing schemes were updated at acceptance events. Since the MCMC sampler updates only a single particle in relation to its previous value, convergence to the target density is typically reached quickly.",

Particularly the magnitude of reported disease incidence varies across countries, likely reflecting differences in reporting practices and/or health-seeking behavior, and we identified summaries of H3N2 case report data that are largely insensitive to these differences (see Figure 1 and Table 1 ). A robust measure of the magnitude in interseasonal variation is the standard deviation in the log ratio of consecutive seasonal case report attack rates because it is based on fractional temporal information in cumulated case report data (\u03c3-attack). To capture the irregularity in interseasonal variation, we compute the autocorrelation in case report peaks for the first few lag years (correlation). Autocorrelation coefficients at the same lag year can vary largely, also because the H3N2 time series is relatively short. We only use the correlation to penalize against strong periodic model behavior;",

Because lower incidence results in more narrow phylogenies, this discrepancy can be explained with the addition of the phylogenetic summaries. To substantiate this explanation, we fitted the tier 1 model under a relaxed pop-attack weighting scheme (\u03c4`\" 0.08), which gave a distribution of pop-attack posterior summary errors that is almost identical to the one obtained with the phylogenetic summaries; see the second column in Table S3 . The associated R 0 is estimated at 3.2\u02d80.79, which is very similar to the estimate obtained with the phylogenetic summaries. Thus, the imposed penalties in the weighting scheme for narrow phylogenies (see Table 1 ) result in slight deviations to low maximum population-level attack rates, which implies relatively high values of R 0 when phylogenetic summaries are included. This implies that conditioning on phylogenetic summaries has an effect on parameter inference even under the SEIRS model, and the molecular genetic and epidemiological summaries are not independent of each other. S.8 Inference under models without spatial substructure Figure 3H -I illustrate that the spatial SEIRS model can reproduce the divergence of H3N2's HA phylogeny.

Briefly, a lower birth rate \u00b5 oe increases the extinction probability of phylodynamic simulations, especially for the fitted epochal evolution model, where infrequent but relatively strong cluster invasions lead to pronounced genetic bottlenecks, see Figure 6H . For an average lifespan of 80 years, more than 50% of all model simulations go extinct. A lower average lifespan than the 50 years used here reduced the extinction probability of phylodynamic simulations, but implied lineages that were 2-3 times as thick as in the observed HA phylogeny. Figure S20 . Reproducibility of interannual variability in H3N2 incidence for increasing nclust in 1968-2002. The first tier of the epochal evolution model was fitted with ABC to features of H3N2 surveillance data as specified in Table 1 under different assumptions on the number of antigenic clusters in 1968-2002: (A) nclust \" 0, (B) nclust \" 3\u02d81, (C) nclust \" 5\u02d81, (D) nclust \" 7\u02d81, (E) nclust \" 11\u02d82, (F) nclust \" 17\u02d84. (A) is the same as Figure 3G , and (E) is the same as Figure 5I . To circumvent computationally expensive phylogenetic simulations, we here generated the annual time series of the number of coexisting antigenic clusters and computed their average value in 1968-2002. To favor strain replacement, on average no more than 1.5 clusters were allowed to coexist in any season. Four MCMC chains were run in parallel, burn-in periods were pruned and the remaining samples were pooled. The two-dimensional histograms between correlation and \u03c3-attack indicate that the interannual variability in H3N2 incidence is increasingly better reproduced with a larger number of antigenic clusters that replace each other. Under the epochal evolution model, the turnover of more than 10 clusters, or equivalently 1 replacement event every 3-4 years, results in irregular incidence time series that are consistent with H3N2's interannual variability.",

BEAST MCMC parameters were fine-tuned from pilot runs, and a burn-in period of 2.5 million MCMC iterations was removed.Table S1summarizes the effect of different assumptions on population demography and molecular clocks on the estimated marginal log likelihood and the average clock rate as well as the coefficient of variation thereof. The constant clock assumes that all branches of the HA1 phylogeny evolve at the same rate, and results in relatively low clock rates. Generally higher clock rates with substantial variability among lineages are estimated with relaxed clocks, and lead to better marginal log likelihoods. Thus, we considered further only the BEAST trees inferred under relaxed molecular clocks and a piecewise constant skyline (bold in",
