            "text": "Abstract: Ebola virus infections lead to severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans and nonhuman primates; and human fatality rates are as high as 67%-90%. Since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976, the only available treatments have been medical support or the emergency administration of experimental drugs. The absence of licensed vaccines and drugs against the Ebola virus impedes the prevention of viral infection. In this study, we generated recombinant baculoviruses (rBV) expressing the Sudan virus (SUDV) matrix structural protein (VP40) (rBV-VP40-VP40) or the SUDV glycoprotein (GP) (rBV-GP-GP), and SUDV virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced by co-infection of Sf9 cells with rBV-SUDV-VP40 and rBV-SUDV-GP. The expression of SUDV VP40 and GP in SUDV VLPs was demonstrated by IFA and Western blot analysis. Electron microscopy results demonstrated that SUDV VLPs had a filamentous morphology. The immunogenicity of SUDV VLPs produced in insect cells was evaluated by the immunization of mice. The analysis of antibody responses showed that mice vaccinated with SUDV VLPs and the adjuvant Montanide ISA 201 produced SUDV GP-specific IgG antibodies. Sera from SUDV VLP-immunized mice were able to block infection by SUDV GP pseudotyped HIV, indicating that a neutralizing antibody against the SUDV GP protein was produced. Furthermore, the activation of B cells in the group immunized with VLPs mixed with Montanide ISA 201 was significant one week after the primary immunization. Vaccination with the SUDV VLPs markedly increased the frequency of antigen-specific cells secreting type 1 and type 2 cytokines. To study the therapeutic effects of SUDV antibodies, horses were immunized with SUDV VLPs emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant or Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The results showed that horses could produce SUDV GP-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. These results showed that SUDV VLPs demonstrate excellent immunogenicity and represent a promising approach for vaccine humans [29] . Furthermore, pre-existing immunity associated with live carrier vaccines is not hindered by VLP-based immunizations. Previous findings showed that SUDV VLPs could be readily assembled by the co-expression of insect cells with baculoviruses expressing GP, NP, and VP40 [30] .",

Briefly, the synthesized genes encoding the SUDV GP (158-368 aa) and VP40 proteins were separately inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector PET 30a (+) by using BamHI and NotI, in-frame with the 6\u00d7His-tag on the C-and N-terminus to construct PET 30a (+) -GP-his-C/N and PET 30a (+) -VP40-his-C/N. After the recombinant plasmids were confirmed by restriction digest, the two recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Transgen Biotech, Beijing, China) and the transformants selected on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates with 100 \u00b5g/mL kanamycin. A single clone was picked and inoculated into 4 mL of LB medium with 100 \u00b5g/mL kanamycin at 37 \u2022 C for overnight growth. Expression was induced with the addition of 0.4 mM IPTG when the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) reached 0.6. The proteins were purified using a HisPurTM Ni-NTA Spin Purification kit (Thermo Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To visualize the expression of the purified proteins, samples were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and stained with Coomassie blue, and protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) followed by analysis at an absorbance of 570 nm; bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as the protein standard.",

These SUDV VLPs vaccine and horse purified IgG provide ideas for the development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies that could prevent and treat SUDV infections. The Ebola epidemic is still spreading, vaccination is an effective means of preventing and controlling the outbreaks, and effective antibodies represent key drugs for the treatment of Ebola patients. Therefore, further Ebola vaccine and therapeutic antibody research are needed. ",
