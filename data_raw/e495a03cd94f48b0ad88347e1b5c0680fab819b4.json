Polyclonal antibody production in rabbits was carried out by Eurogentec (Belgium) applying the standard (87-days) immunization protocol. For intracellular PAFB detection, cell extracts were prepared from 24-144 h old P. chrysogenum Q176 mycelia. Frozen and grinded mycelia (0.5 g) were extracted with one ml protein extraction buffer (12.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8; 2.0% glycerol (v/v); 0.4% SDS; 2.5% b-mercaptoethanol(v/v)). The samples were then incubated at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min and centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 10 min, 20 \u00b0C). The supernatant was collected and subjected to 18% (w/v) tris-glycine SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For the detection of PAFB in the P. chrysogenum culture broth, 25 \u00b5L of 10-fold concentrated supernatant was separated by 18% (w/v) tris-glycine SDS-PAGE. Samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio Trace, Pall), which were blocked for 2 h in PBS/0.3% Tween (v/v)/3.0% skimmed milk powder (w/v) and then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with anti-PAFB antiserum (1:1,000 in PBS/0.3% Tween (v/v)/1.0% skimmed milk powder (w/v)). After washing in PBS / 0.3% Tween (3 \u00d710 min) the membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS/0.3% Tween (v/v)/1.0% skimmed milk powder (w/v) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed and proteinimmunocomplexes were visualized using NBT/BCIP (Promega).",

For PAFB overexpression the P. chrysogenum-based expression system was used 1 . To put the pafB gene under the control of the strong paf promoter, the paf gene in the expression vector pSK275paf was replaced by pafB genomic DNA that codes for the pre-pro PAFB. To this end, the pafB-gene (404 bp) was amplified from genomic DNA of P. chryosgenum Q176 using the primers pafB_BglII_fw/pafB_SmaI_rev (Supplementary Table S4 ). 1,292 bp of the paf 5\u00b4UTR and 386 bp of the paf 3\u00b4UTR were amplified using the primer pairs 5UTR_PstI_fw/5UTR_SmaI_BglII_rev and 3UTR_SmaI_fw/ 3UTR_SpeI_rev, respectively (Supplementary Table S4 ). After digestion of the PCR products with the respective restriction enzymes (SmaI, BglII, PstI, SpeI, New England Biolabs) the resulted fragments were ligated using the T4-DNA-Ligase (Promega). The ligation product (2,082 bp) was subsequently cloned into the SpeI and PstI digested pSK275paf vector exchanging the paf-coding sequence and resulting in the expression vector pSK275pafB.",

SacII digested DNA (2 \u00b5g per lane) was fractionated on a 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel. The DNA was transferred on Hybond-N membranes and hybridized with DIG-labelled probes, specific for the pyrithiamine (ptrA) resistance gene present on the plasmid pSK275pafB. The probes were generated from pSK275pafB by PCR using the oligonucleotides ptrA_southern_fw/ptrA_southern_rev (Supplementary Table S4 ). The Southern blot experiments proved multiple random integration of the transforming DNA into the fungal genome ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). A 1.3 kb DIG-labelled PCR probe spanning a part of the ptrA resistance cassette was used for plasmid detection. The presence of the transforming plasmid carrying the recombinant PAFB encoding gene in the genome of P. chrysogenum pafB strain was proven by the detection of a 3.7 kb hybridizing fragment, which corresponded to a SacII digested part of the transformed plasmid. The additional signals varied in sizes and intensities, which further proved multiple-copy random plasmid integration ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ).",

The full-length PAFB structure was modeled by manually building and adding a leucine-serine segment to the N-terminus of the first model in the 2NC2 structure using lsqman 3 for initial superposition and standard text editing for generating the Protein Data Bank submission of the full-length model. All subsequent calculations were performed with an in-house modified version of GROMACS 4 4 . Modifications including the handling of NOE distance restraints in a pairwise manner over multiple replicas 5 were described earlier 6 and the source files are freely available at http://users.itk.ppke.hu/~gaszo. The AMBER99SB-ILDN force field 7 was used with the GBSA implicit water model using the Onufriev-Bashford-Case method 8 . The initial model was energy minimized to the 1,000 kJ/mol/nm forrce limit using steepest descents. Short exploratory molecular dynamics calculations were run with and without NOE restraints. Restrained calculations were run using the distance restraints deposited in the Protein Data Bank for sfPAFB (Protein Data Bank ID: 2NC2) on two replicas for 100 ps with a step of 1fs and NOE force constant of 1,000 kJ/mol/nm 2 . In this simulation, only the final two conformations were analyzed. Unrestrained simulations were run for 3 ns and structures were sampled every 50 ps resulting in 61 models. Secondary structure content was calculated by running DSSPcont 9 on each model and then averaging the probabilities of the structural states for each residue. The state with the highest probability was chosen, in the case of equal probabilities (50-50%), preference was given to 'E' over 'L' and 'L' over 'S'.",

One hundred microliters of medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS) containing proteins in increasing concentrations were added to the monolayers of L132 cells (10 4 /well) in triplicates. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. After 72 h, the supernatant was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen, France). Ten microliters of MTT-solution (2 mg/mL), prepared in PBS, were added to each well and the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C. Then, 100 \u00b5l of SDS (100 \u00b5g/mL) was added to the wells to solubilize the MTT crystals. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 4 h, agitated until complete crystal dissolution and evaluated by measuring the OD 570 using a Multiskan EX 96-well plate ELISA reader (Thermo Electron Corporation).

For the doubly labelled form the resonances for the 3 N-terminal resonances are missing, suggesting that in this case the sfPAFB form is dominant. The excellent overlap between the spectra and the number of peaks reveals that there are no different conformations present in the two structures, indicating that the presence (or altered dynamics) of the N-terminal 2 residues has no significant effect on the overall structure of the protein.",
