Serum FGL2 levels were measured by ELISA. Spleen cells cultured with ConA for 48h or with E. multilocularis Vesicle Fluid (VF) for 96h were analyzed ex-vivo and in-vitro. In addition, spleen cells from non-infected WT mice were cultured with rFGL2/anti-FGL2 or rIL-17A/anti-IL-17A for further functional studies. For Treg-immune-suppression-assays, purified CD4 + CD25 + Treg suspensions were incubated with CD4 + effector T cells in the presence of ConA and irradiated spleen cells as APCs.

Our study provides a comprehensive evidence for a major involvement of the recently identified CD4 + CD25 + Regulatory T Cell Effector Molecule FGL2 to the outcome of AE. Our major findings are as follows: 1) FGL2 is mostly secreted by Tregs and partly contributes to their functions; 2) FGL2 can downregulate the maturation of DCs, suppress Th1 and Th17 immune responses, and support Th2 and Treg immune responses, and finally 3) IL-17A contributes to FGL2 secretion. Based on the present findings in mice, we will investigate FGL2 as a potential marker of progression of AE in human patients, or as a potential immunotherapeutical target. Early prediction of parasite regression (currently not yet possible) would allow clinicians to plan for withdrawing benzimidazole treatment, which is currently administered for life. Then, FGL2 should be investigated as a target for an anticipated immunomodulatory treatment of patients with progressive AE, especially of those who are non-or low-responders to benzimidazole treatment, or who suffer from side-effects due to chemotherapy.

Experimental murine AE is characterized, as studied in spleen or lymph node cells, by an initial Th1 response during the early stage of infection (till 1 month p.i.) that gradually switches to a more dominant Th2-biased response during the chronic phase of AE (2-4 months p.i.). Nevertheless, this mostly mixed Th1/Th2 profile, characterized by the concomitant presence of IL-12\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 at the very early stage of E. multilocularis infection [4] , is associated with the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the periparasitic granuloma and partial/ relative protective immunity (restriction of parasite growth) through fibrosis and necrosis [5] . It has been previously reported that CD4 + CD25 + T regulatory cells (Tregs) play a critical role in human AE by blunting immune responses to specific antigens, or by suppressing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, especially through interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) [6] . Moreover, increased CD4 + CD25 + Tregs were also observed in peritoneal cells of mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) infected with E. multilocularis, a finding that concurred with other findings demonstrating that E. multilocularis antigens promote T cell differentiation into Treg cells [7] .",

            "text": "Previous microarray analyses showed that expression of mRNA coding for the fibrinogenlike protein 2 (FGL2) were significantly up-regulated in the liver of mice perorally infected with E. multilocularis eggs [8] . FGL2, a member of the fibrinogen-related superfamily of proteins secreted by T cells, has recently been reported by a number of groups to be highly expressed in Tregs. Its role was associated to Treg effector functions [9, 10] . It was shown that FGL2 could inhibit dendritic cell (DC) maturation through binding to the low-affinity FcgammaRIIB receptor, and thus contribute to Treg activity [11] . There is evidence that FGL2 exerts an immunosuppressive effect on T cell proliferation. Thus, FGL2 seems to play an important role both in innate and adaptive immunity, by the fact to be expressed by activated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, and reticulo-endothelial cells as well [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . FGL2 has been propagated as a novel cancer biomarker, and was shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders such as allo-and xenograft rejection [12, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and cytokine-induced fetal loss [23] , as well as in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, such as viral hepatitis [14, 17] . However, nothing is known about FGL2 and its potential role in parasite-induced immunotolerance.",

To achieve these goals, Th1/ Th2-related and Treg/Th17 related cytokines, the maturation of DCs, and the generation of Tregs and their functions were studied at the different disease stages in an experimental model with active or knocked-out FGL2-expression.",

To examine whether IL-17A contributes to FGL2-secretion, spleen cells from non-infected WT-mice were co-cultured either with recombinant IL-17A (rIL-17A) as an external stimulus, or with anti-IL-17A antibodies, and FGL2 levels were quantitatively analyzed in respective culture supernatants by ELISA. As shown in Fig 1B, addition of rIL-17A lead to increased FGL2-secretion in a dose-dependent manner, while the addition of anti-IL-17A had no effect ( Fig 1B) .",

Purified splenic CD4 + T cells from AE-fgl2 -/mice exhibited an increased proliferation in response to ConA, as compared to splenic CD4 + T cells from AE-WT mice (P<0.01) (S3A and S3B Fig). To further study the role of FGL2 in Tcell proliferation, splenic CD4 + T cells from WT mice were cultured in the presence and absence of rFGL2. CD4 + Teffs showed a pronounced proliferation in response to ConA stimulation, which was inhibited by the addition of rFGL2 (S3C Fig) . Furthermore, T helper (Th) cells from AE-fgl2 -/mice appeared oriented towards a lower Th2 response at early stage of infection (1 months p.i.), and a stronger Th1-response at late stage of infection (4 months p.i.) (Fig 3A-3C and 3E ). This dichotomic polarization was, however, not confirmed by in vitro cultivation of the cells in the presence of ConA stimulation (Fig 3D) . Respective flow cytometric analyses of CD4 + T cells in spleen from AE-fgl2 -/mice and AE-WT mice showed that there was no difference in expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 at 48 h after of exposure to ConA (Fig 3D) . However, expression levels of IL-17A and IL-2 were significantly higher in CD4 + T cells in spleen cell cultures obtained from AE-fgl2 -/mice at 4 months p.i. when compared to AE-WT mice. The role of FGL2 in the maturation of different subsets of DCs, i.e. CD11b + and CD11c + DCs, was investigated. First, the maturation levels in both PECs and spleen cells from infected AE-fgl2 -/mice, AE-WT mice, and non-infected controls were studied. Among CD11b + DCs, the frequency of the maturation marker CD80 in PECs and spleen cells was higher at 4 months p.i. in AE-fgl2 -/mice than in AE-WT mice (Fig 4A and 4B) . The same was found for CD11c + DCs (Fig 4G and 4H) . However, there was no difference in CD86 frequency in both subpopulations of DCs (Fig 4D and 4E ). Subsequently, we assessed the same parameters, but upon in vitro cultivation and stimulation with ConA for 48 h. Findings revealed that CD80 frequency, not CD86, in both DC subpopulations from AE-fgl2 -/mice at 4 months p.i. was significantly higher than in those from AE-WT mice (Fig 4C,4F and 4I ).",

We originally hypothesized that upregulated FGL2-expression at the host-parasite interface promotes parasite proliferation. Comparative analysis of E. multilocularis growth in fgl2 -/mice versus WT mice at the late stage of infection showed clearly that AE-WT mice exhibited a significantly higher parasite load as compared to AE-fgl2 -/mice. In parallel, the parasite proliferation potential, assessed by determination of the E. multilocularis em14-3-3 gene-expression-level, was significantly higher in AE-WT mice, and respectively lower in AE-fgl2 -/animals. In previous experiments we had already documented that em14-3-3-expression significantly increased upon reduced protective immunity such as encountered in athymic nude mice, or decreased when the parasite growth was hindered as e.g. by albendazole therapy [28, 31] . AE-WT-mice also exhibited higher FGL2-levels in the serum as compared to non-infected mice, elevated fgl2 mRNA expression levels in respective PEC and spleen cells, and a concomitantly increased number of Tregs, which represent one of the major Treg producers [9] . Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that Treg-expressed FGL2 contributes to the pathogenesis of E. multilocularis infection. In other infection models, such as viral MHV-3 infection [10] , similar results have been demonstrated, while no such effects were found during protozoan (Toxoplasma gondii), bacterial (Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and other types of viral infections such as murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 and Sendai infections [32] . The successful survival of pathogens depends mainly on evading the host immune response by, for example, varying their surface antigens, eliminating their protein coat, and/or modulating the host immune response. Immunosuppression is sometimes directly caused by pathogen-derived metabolic products, and sometimes involves antigenic mimicry. One of the most sophisticated mechanisms of immune evasion is the selective activation of a directly targeted subset of T helper cells. Different pathogens may target different regulative pathways of the host immune response, such as Th2, Tregs or Th17. It is known that the regulation of such pathways is not dependent on single genes or molecules. Rather, a complex immuno-network is usually involved, which requires a sophisticated modulatory process via specific modulatory molecules from E. multilocularis to become effective, some may even act in combination or exert together a synergistic effect. Already know E. multilocularis bioactive molecules include e.g. Alkaline Phosphatase [33] , Em492 [34] , EmTIP [7] , among others; if these are involved in e.g. FGL2-induction needs to be further explored.",

In experimental AE [5, 35, 36] , the control of metacestode proliferation appears to be predominantly T cell-dependent, as assessed upon use of different immune-compromised mouse models [27, 31, 37] , and confirmed by observations in human AE-patients with immune suppression-associated conditions [38] [39] [40] [41] . It is therefore conceivable that the proliferating metacestode itself specifically activates and concurrently modulates the immune response to its own advantage. The metacestode appears to secrete immuno-active metabolites to suppress the protective Th1-type response, and to promote a secondarily reinforced Th2-type response through functional induction and maintenance of Treg cells [2, 25] . Tregs, which over-express a subset of regulatory cytokine genes including those coding for IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, play an important role in promoting immune tolerance in a number of parasitic disease models [42] . In AE, the expression of both cytokines appears up-regulated in mice as shown by different studies [39] , and other studies strongly suggested that they are also up-regulated in human AE-patients [43] .",

In Tregs of WT BALB/c mice, FGL2 encoding mRNA is constitutively expressed at a high level, and expression even increased after MHV-3 infection, and adoptive transfer of WT Tregs into MHV-3 resistant fgl2 -/mice suggested that FGL2 might be an important Treg effector molecule [10] . Previous studies on FGL2 had shown that rFGL2 suppressed T cell proliferation induced by anti-CD3/28 MAbs and ConA [47, 48] . In this study, we now demonstrated that rFGL2 suppressed CD4 + effector T cell proliferation in response to E. multilocularis antigenic metabolites present in the metacestode VF. We also showed that FGL2 inhibited the maturation of DCs, suppressed Th1 and Th17 immune responses, and FGL2 polarized an allogeneic immune response towards a Th2-oriented cytokine profile, both in vivo and in vitro. Conversely, in fgl2 -/mice, Th1 cytokine levels and activity of DCs and T cells were all increased when compared to WT-animals, and FGL2-serum-levels correlated with IL-4 expression in WT-mice before and after E. multilocularis infection. The development of a Th2-oriented immune response in WT-mice during the course of E. multilocularis infection corroborated the generally known effect of FGL2 to promote a Th2 cytokine production, with a concomitant inhibition of Th1-and Th17-oriented immunity [47] . Furthermore, increased serum levels of IL-17A correlated with high FGL2 serum levels, suggesting for the first time that IL-17A could contribute to FGL2-secretion. This was confirmed in vitro by the finding that recombinant IL-17A promoted the production of FGL2 in spleen cells.",

            "text": "We also investigated whether FGL2 would affect the functional activities of Treg cells, by directly assessing the effects of rFGL2 and of an anti-FGL2-MAb on Treg activities in vitro. The presence of recombinant FGL2 promoted Treg function, while addition of anti-FGL2-MAb completely abrogated Treg activity. Further evidence for the role of FGL2 as a molecule that promotes Treg function, and thus immunosuppression, was given by the observation that fgl2 -/mice exhibited both decreased Treg numbers and impaired Treg function. The mechanism by which FGL2 mediates its immunosuppressive activity is currently under investigation. Previous studies have indicated that FGL2 binds to the inhibitory Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor (CD32) expressed primarily on APCs. Both CD80 and CD86 ligands are found on APCs and are known to provide efficient costimulation, however, in our experiments, distinct functions may be attributed to CD80 and CD86. The differential functions of these molecules have already been the subject of considerable studies, with most data suggesting that the two ligands share substantially overlapping functions. There is, however, also an increasing evidence that supports the view that CD80 may be a more effective ligand for CTLA-4 than CD86 [49] . This FGL2-Fc\u03b3RIIB interaction through CD80 was shown to induce apoptosis in B cells, and to inhibit DC-maturation [11] . In E. multilocularis infection, several immune subsets may express the Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor, such as macrophages (including the 'epithelioid cells' that line the 'immuno-modulating' laminated layer), and also the numerous CD8 + T cells present in the periparasitic infiltrate [50] ; CD8 + T cells have actually been shown to express the Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor in a murine model of Trypanosoma cruzi [51] . Taken our recent data on the course of cytokine expression by the periparasitic immune infiltrate in E. multilocularis infection [4] combined with the results from this study we propose that in E. multilocularis infected mice the following events occur: (a) TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A are released by the host at early stage of infection; (b) these cytokines, and especially IFN-\u03b3 as demonstrated previously [32] but also IL-17A as shown in the present study, contribute to FGL2-secretion by Tregs and other cells; and (c) secreted FGL2 can bind to Fc\u03b3RIIB receptor, leads to a late-stage immune suppression by down-regulating the maturation of DCs, decreases co-stimulation of effector T cells, suppresses Th1 and Th17 immune responses, and accelerates Th2 immune responses. Some parasite's specific molecules may be involved in the modulation of FGL2, as discussed earlier.",

For instance, the experimental treatment of E. multilocularis infected mice with anti-FGL2-MAb could provide a means of converting the immunological anergy during chronic disease into a more pro-active, Th1-oriented immunity, with potentially fatal consequences for the metacestode. This is already under investigation. Furthermore, our findings may provide a rationale for studying FGL2 as a target for an immunomodulatory IFN-\u03b3 as demonstrated previously, but also IL-17A as presently demonstrated, contributes to FGL2 secretion by Tregs and other cells; once FGL2 is released, it binds to Fc\u03b3RIIB receptors, down-regulates the maturation of DCs, decreases co-stimulation of effector T cells, suppresses Th1 and Th17 immune response, accelerates Th2 immune responses, and overall this leads to an immune suppressed status that favors the continuous \"tumor-like\" progression of the parasitic metacestode.",
