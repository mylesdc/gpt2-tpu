Methods A representative cluster sample size for students was estimated using Fisher et al.'s formula while schools, sub-counties and education zones were clustered and sample size was calculated based on coefficient of variation by school type. Data were collected by questionnaire, medical examination using standard procedures, and focus group discussion, and descriptive analysis was performed on the completed questions. Comparisons between risk factors were made by chi-square and ANOVA analysis using SPSS for Windows (version 15.2; Chicago, IL) software. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results There was significant variation between communicable disease prevalence rates and age (X 2 4 , 0.05 = 2.458), school size (X 2 12, 0.05 = 18.636), gender (X 2 4 , 0 . 0 5 = 5.723) and class of students (X 2 1 2 , 0.05 = 15.202), and bed and desk spacing (p < 0.05 at 95% CI). However, there was no significant association in prevalence rates between both locality and type of school. There was strong evidence that student age has an effect on prevalence rates. The prevalence rate of malaria was higher in male (14.02%) than female students (6.68%) compared to prevalence of diarrhea, which was higher in female (7.96%) than male students.",

The findings of these studies, which showed that in Uganda 14-64% of school-age children have parasitemia at any one time, concurs with the determined prevalence rate of malaria that we observed ( Fig. 1; X 2 4, 0.05 = 2.458). This also concurs with the results of a study on the prevalence of malaria parasitema by Gitonga and others (2010) in 480 Kenyan schools between September 2008 and March 2010, which found an overall prevalence rate of 4%; however, this ranged from 0 to 71%. It also agrees with the findings of a study by Dai et al. (2008) ; Oduro et al. (2013) and others for Senegal, The Gambia, and Mauritania in which the prevalence of malaria infection in school-age children ranged from 5 to 50%.",

(2011) have shown there is strong evidence that, at the individual level, regular use of an insecticide-treated net (ITN) or long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLIN) substantially lowers the risk of malaria infection. This may be attributed to the fact that as children become older and more independent, parents have less control over the time when they go to bed, where they sleep and whether they use a net, frequently resulting in low Fig. 4 Prevalence rates related to student gender net coverage in children in this age group. However, evidence is needed to concretize the reasoning. This study has revealed that student age is a predisposing factor to infectious diseases (Fig. 6) . The same results were observed in a study by Baker et al. (2013) on infectious diseases attributable to household crowding in New Zealand, which showed that children less than 5 years old exposed to greater household crowding had 1.69 times the odds of pneumonia as children exposed to the least crowding. The findings of this study showed that the prevalence of tuberculosis and pneumonia is high among students where there is overcrowding in hostels and classrooms (Figs. 2 and 7) . It also revealed that students in the 14-17-year age bracket have a higher incidence of tuberculosis and pneumonia than those in the 18 years and greater age bracket 16 . Findings by the CDC (2007) also confirm these results.",
