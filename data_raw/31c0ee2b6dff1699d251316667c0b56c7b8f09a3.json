            "text": "The mucus-dwelling parasite Ostertagia ostertagi is one of the most important gastrointestinal nematodes in cattle. Our group has previously demonstrated the protective capacity of a vaccine against this parasite based on a native activation-associated secreted protein ASP1 (nASP) in combination with the saponin adjuvant QuilA. The aim of the current study was to analyse the effect of both antigen and adjuvant on the cellular and humoral vaccine-induced immune responses by comparing the native ASP to a recombinant version expressed in Pichia pastoris (pASP) and replacing QuilA by Al(OH) 3 . Immunization of cattle with the protective nASP+QuilA vaccine was associated with antigen-induced proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells combined with IFN-\u03b3 secretion and the induction of a mixed IgG1/IgG2 antibody response. ASP-specific activation and proliferation of NK cells was also observed in mice following the same vaccination regime. Replacing QuilA by Al(OH) 3 or nASP by pASP significantly decreased the capacity of the vaccines to trigger both NK cell activation and antibody responses and failed to induce protection against a challenge infection. Reduction of the structurally anchoring disulphide bonds of the nASP completely abolished its ability to induce NK cell activation and antibody responses, highlighting the importance of protein conformation for the immunostimulatory activity.",

Intramuscular immunization of cattle with the native ASP (nASP) in combination with QuilA adjuvant raises an effective immune response, resulting in a significant reduction in faecal worm egg shedding of 56-74% during a two-month period 17 . A reduction in worm fecundity is typically the first manifestation of immunity against this parasite. Such decrease can significantly affect pasture infection levels and prevent parasitic gastroenteritis. A similar protective response is however not observed when the native antigen is replaced by a recombinant version produced in insect cells 14 . Furthermore, replacing the QuilA adjuvant by Al(OH) 3 has also shown to completely abolish the protective effect of the native antigen 16 , indicating that both the antigen and the adjuvant are essential to achieve protection. Understanding how immunity in animals, vaccinated with the nASP-QuilA vaccine, is orchestrated might help to identify the essential features that are needed to induce protection, information which is crucial to direct future recombinant expression work. Previous research has shown that potential effector mechanisms involved in the vaccine-induced protection are antigen-specific IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies in the abomasal mucosa and increased levels of granule exocytosis, involving the local release of granulysin and granzyme B 18 . Information on the upstream mechanisms triggered by the vaccine and how these are influenced by antigen and adjuvant is still missing. Therefore, the overall aim of the present study was to analyse and compare the effect of both antigen (native vs recombinant) and adjuvant (QuilA vs Al(OH) 3 ) on the cellular and humoral vaccine-induced immune responses.",

To characterize the cellular immune response following vaccination in mice, spleen mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated at time of necropsy, and used for both 3 H-thymidine ( 3 HT) and PKH proliferation assays to determine antigen-specific proliferation in vitro. As observed in cattle, cells isolated from mice solely vaccinated with either QuilA or Al(OH) 3 did not show any proliferation following in vitro stimulation with the nASP or pASP (Fig. 4A ,E). Although significant proliferation was observed in cells from the pASP+ QuilA and nASP+ Al(OH) 3 vaccinated animals following re-stimulation with the corresponding vaccine antigens (Fig. 4B ,C,F), the highest proliferation was again observed in the nASP+ QuilA group. Furthermore, exposure of the cells from the pASP+ QuilA animals to nASP also resulted in a significant cellular proliferation in comparison to the medium control (Fig. 4C) . Interestingly, cells from mice vaccinated with the nASP of which the disulphide bonds were reduced did not show any proliferation after re-stimulation with the reduced antigen (Fig. 4D) . Mice were immunized three times in a 3-week interval intramuscularly in the thigh muscle and euthanized one week following the last vaccination. Mouse spleen MNCs were isolated and re-stimulated with either medium alone, nASP or pASP. 3 HT uptake was used as a measure of total cell proliferation. All graphs show the mean counts per minute (CPM) \u00b1 SEM for animals vaccinated with (A) QuilA, (B) nASP+ QuilA, (C) pASP+ QuilA, (D) Reduced-ASP+ QuilA, (E) Al(OH) 3 and (F) nASP+ Al(OH) 3 . Statistically significant differences are indicated with * p < 0.05. PKH assays were subsequently performed in order to characterize the proliferative cell populations. Confirming the 3 HT assays (Fig. 4 ), Fig. 5 shows that there was no increased proliferation of cells from the QuilA and Al(OH) 3 control groups nor from the reduced-nASP+ QuilA group upon in vitro stimulation with nASP, pASP or reduced-nASP (Fig. 5A ,D,E). On the other hand, B cells, and especially NK and non-T, non-B non-NK cells (CD3 \u2212 /CD21 \u2212 /CD335 \u2212 ) from nASP+ QuilA vaccinated mice showed significant proliferation after in vitro re-stimulation with nASP compared to cells stimulated with medium alone (Fig. 5B) . Antigen-specific proliferation of the NK and non-T, non-B non-NK cells (CD3 \u2212 /CD21 \u2212 /CD335 \u2212 ) following re-stimulation with nASP was also observed with cells from the pASP+ QuilA and nASP+ Al(OH) 3 groups (Fig. 5C,F ), albeit at a lower level compared to the nASP+ QuilA group. When re-stimulating cells from the nASP+ Al(OH) 3 group with nASP, modest levels of \u03b3 \u03b4 -T cell proliferation could also be observed (Fig. 5F ). Finally, re-stimulation of pASP+ QuilA cells with pASP induced antigen-specific NK cells proliferation, which was similar to that observed after nASP stimulation, but again much lower than the levels observed in the nASP+ QuilA group (Fig. 5C ).",

NK cells are large granular lymphocytes that either become directly activated by pathogens or through interaction with other pathogen-activated immune cells. They were originally named after their ability to spontaneously kill transformed, infected or non-self cells without prior sensitization or activation. Despite their innate origin, there is accumulating evidence that also NK cells can develop long-lived and highly specific memory to a variety of antigens [19] [20] [21] . Previous studies also indicate that NK cells are likely to be involved in the natural immune response in cattle following nematode infection. It was already shown that NK cells are important in the proliferation observed in the abomasal lymph nodes during the course of an infection 22, 23 . More recently, an antigen-specific proliferation of NK cells was observed in the draining lymph nodes of the small intestine of animals infected with C. oncophora 24 . Also, analysis of transcriptional changes by qRT-PCR in the abomasal mucosa following Ostertagia infection showed a significant upregulation of the NK cell marker CD335 25 and the expression of granulysin and granzyme, both proteins that are typically produced by NK cells 18 . Furthermore, the flow cytometric analyses performed in this study showed that NK cells represented roughly 15% of the total abomasal lymphocyte population following infection.",

            "text": "The observed NK cell activation and IFN\u03b3 production following in vitro re-stimulation with the native ASP is also in line with previously published data on an ASP (rOv-ASP-1) from the filarial parasite Onchocerca volvulus. In a series of papers, it was shown that immunisation with Ov-ASP-1 induced a highly dominant IFN-\u03b3 recall response following vaccination, most likely produced by activated NK cells, combined with a mixed IgG1/ IgG2 antibody reaction [26] [27] [28] . Similar to the O. ostertagi ASP, the bioactivity of Ov-ASP-1 was completely lost after denaturing the protein by boiling 26 . It is also interesting to note that secreted protein(s) of the human hookworm Necator americanus selectively bind to NK cells and induced IFN-\u03b3 production and that this process is dependent on the presence of the cytokines IL-2 and IL-12, likely secreted by activated antigen-presenting cells 29, 30 . Whether ASPs are responsible for this activity is currently unknown. Teixeira-Carvalho et al. 30 previously hypothesized that the activation of NK cells and IFN-\u03b3 production is part of an immune evasion strategy by the worms, in an attempt to down-regulate a protective Th2 response 29 . In case of the O. ostertagi vaccine it is unclear whether the NK cell activation is necessary to obtain protection or, alternatively, whether the protective capacity of the vaccine is based on the generation of antibodies, potentially interfering with the immunomodulatory activity of the ASP. Over the years, several studies have demonstrated that antibodies can provide protective immunity against gastrointestinal helminths in a direct and/or indirect way 31 . This protection would hypothetically be achieved through antibody-dependent activation of immune cells in the intestinal mucosa, or by interfering with enzymes and processes required for larval migration, invasion and feeding. In that context, nASP+ QuilA vaccinated cattle had an increased amount of nASP-specific IgG1 and IgG2-type antibodies both in blood and in the abomasal mucus. Interestingly, NK cells express Fc\u03b3 RIII (CD16) at their surface, which can mediate antibody-dependent cytotoxicity through the recognition of sequestered antigens 32 . NK cells are highly abundant in the intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocyte fractions of the abomasum, creating a high chance for effective contact between their CD335 + receptor and the different parasitic life stages of O. ostertagi. Therefore, a possible mechanism of action for NK cells against O. ostertagi could be the recognition of antibody-sequestered nASP and subsequent antibody mediated degranulation. Since NK cells are known to express granzyme B, perforin and granulysin, this could be an interesting link with previous observations on the upregulation of granulysin and granzyme B in animals protected by vaccination against O. ostertagi 18 .",

            "text": "The cellular and humoral responses observed for the protective nASP+ QuilA vaccine were markedly higher compared to responses observed for the non-protective nASP+ Al(OH) 3 vaccine, both in cattle and mice. The exact mechanisms by which both adjuvants act are not completely understood yet. It has been shown that Al(OH) 3 exerts a reservoir function, from which antigen is released slowly for a prolonged period of time 33 , whereas saponin-based adjuvants such as QuilA exert a more cytolytic function 34 . Despite the fact that Al(OH) 3 is regarded as a Th2 type immune response inducing adjuvant, saponin-based adjuvants seem to induce a stronger antibody response against the vaccine antigen than Al(OH) 3 35 , supporting the hypothesis of a possible important role for antibodies in the vaccination-induced protection against O. ostertagi. Additionally, not only the choice of adjuvant, but also the conformation of the antigen has proven to be essential in triggering a protective immune response. Unfolding the ASP completely abolished its ability to induce both NK cell activation and antibody induction. Furthermore, we also showed that the recombinant version of the ASP, expressed in P. pastoris, was less potent in triggering both a cellular and humoral response. These observations indicate that protein folding, potentially in combination with N-and/or O-glycans present on the peptide core, of the native ASP is crucial for its immunoreactivity and that these factors could be at the basis of the inability of recombinant ASP in triggering a similar response. This is in line with the results of inhibition ELISA's showing that antibodies raised upon nASP vaccination preferentially bind nASP over pASP, suggesting the presence of either different and/or additional epitopes.",

After 5 days of culture, supernatants were harvested and used on an ELISA. IFN\u03b3 and IL4 capture monoclonal antibodies were coated in carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) on 96-well Maxisorp (Nunc) plates at a concentration of 2 \u03bc g/ml and 4 \u03bc g/ml, respectively. Plates were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for one hour at room temperature. Afterwards, 50 \u03bc l of supernatant was administered to each well, and medium with a known concentration of either bovine IFN\u03b3 or IL4 was used as a standard. All conditions were performed in duplicate. Biotinylated monoclonal antibodies raised against IFN\u03b3 or IL4 (kindly provided by Prof. Jayne Hope, The Roslin Institute, UK) were added at a concentration of 2 \u03bc g/ml. Streptavidin-horseradish-peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a conjugate. O-phenylenediamine (Sigma-Aldrich) 0.1% in citrate buffer (pH 5.0) served as substrate. Optical density was measured at 492 nm. OD values were converted to concentrations using Deltasoft JV software (Deltasoft).",
