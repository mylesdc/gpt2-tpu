Here, by exploring a lipid library, we show that AM580, a retinoid derivative and RAR-\u03b1 agonist, is highly potent in interrupting the life cycle of diverse viruses including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and influenza A virus. Using click chemistry, the overexpressed sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) is shown to interact with AM580, which accounts for its broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Mechanistic studies pinpoint multiple SREBP proteolytic processes and SREBP-regulated lipid biosynthesis pathways, including the downstream viral protein palmitoylation and double-membrane vesicles formation, that are indispensable for virus replication. Collectively, our study identifies a basic lipogenic transactivation event with broad relevance to human viral infections and represents SREBP as a potential target for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.",

In the past 20 years, emerging and re-emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses, avian influenza A (H5N1) and A(H7N9) viruses, pandemic 2009 influenza A virus (H1N1), Zika virus, and enteroviruses have posed significant global public health threats [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Rapid and effective control of these epidemics at their onset was often not possible due to the long time lag required for the development of specific antivirals or vaccines. Early empirical administration of a highly effective broad-spectrum antiviral would improve patients' outcome and facilitate the control of these epidemics if given before or soon after the exact pathogen is identified. Current strategies for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents mainly focus on two aspects, virus encoded targets, and host defense factors or cellular machineries that are exploited by viruses 9 . Successful examples of virus-targeting strategy include blockers of viral attachment and fusion 10, 11 , as well as inhibitors targeting viral enzymes, such as protease, polymerase, and neuraminidase, or internal structural proteins 12 . On the other aspect, type I interferons (IFNs) and IFN-induced proteins can be used to trigger the cellular machineries of host defense to suppress viral replication. Nevertheless, challenges of drug toxicity and emergence of resistant viral progenies remain to be addressed.",

A key component in such reprogramming is the rapid up-regulation of lipid biosynthetic pathways, which can substantially impact on the viral replication process. Lipids have been recognized as structural elements of viral and cellular membranes. Viruses induce the formation of novel cytoplasmic membrane structures and compartments, in which viral genome replication and assembly occurs with perhaps shielding from host innate immune response. The involvement of lipids in the viral replication cycle is shared by enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, as well as both DNA and RNA viruses 13 . The correlation between virus infection and host lipid metabolism has been implicated in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) 14 . Infection with HCMV markedly upregulated flux through much of the central carbon metabolism particularly in flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and its efflux to the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway.",

Thus, the modulation of cellular lipid metabolism to interfere with virus multiplication may be an appealing, broadly applicable approach for antiviral therapy. To this end, we carry out a pharmacological screening of a lipid library. AM580, a retinoid derivative and RAR-\u03b1 agonist, demonstrates potent and broad-spectrum antiviral activities in vitro and in vivo. Using AM580 as a tool compound, we modify it by click chemistry and identify the host cell sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) as the direct binding target of AM580. SREBPs are bHLH-zip transcription factors that have well-defined roles in the regulation of cellular lipid homeostasis. In mammals, there are two SREBP genes that express three SREBP proteins. SREBP1a and SREBP1c are produced via alternative transcriptional start sites on Srebf1, whereas the Srebf2 gene encodes SREBP2. Canonical SREBP1c signaling preferentially drives expression of fatty acid biosynthesis genes whereas SREBP2 predominately transactivates genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, intracellular lipid movement and lipoprotein import 15 . Mechanistically, we find that AM580 blocks the interaction of SREBP1/2 proteins with the non-palindromic sterol regulatory elements (SREs) in the promoter/enhancer regions of multiple lipogenic genes, which inhibits their transcription and thus reverses the virus-induced lipid hyper-biosynthesis. Collectively, our study identifies SREBP-mediated lipid biosynthesis with broad relevance to human viral infections and represents SREBP as an undescribed target for the development of broadspectrum intervention strategies, especially for tackling novel viruses causing emerging infectious diseases.",

To understand the host response to virus infection, we determined the transcriptomic profile of human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells infected with MERS-CoV. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed to explore multiple aspects of virus-host interaction, including cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, human diseases, organismal systems, and metabolism (Fig. 1a) . Within the major category of metabolism, there is a combinational GO item with many global and overview maps that comprise sub-items such as carbon metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and biosynthesis of amino acids 16 . Notably, lipid metabolism was the top-ranking affected metabolic pathway, highlighting the importance of lipids among the metabolic changes triggered by MERS-CoV infection. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that steroid biosynthesis being the most highly enriched pathway, which indicated the markedly heightened lipid demands during MERS-CoV life cycle (Supplementary Figure 1a) . To explore how MERS-CoV infection perturbed lipid metabolism, an untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed in MERS-CoVinfected Calu-3 cells. Lipid features significantly changed with p < 0.05 (Student's t-test) in MERS-CoV-infected cells were selected. For better demonstration of changed lipids profile trend after MERS-CoV infection, a Heatmap was constructed according to the identified lipid list (Supplementary Data 1). As shown in Fig. 1b , these changed lipid features include glycerophospholipid and fatty acids classes, indicating that MERS-CoV infection strongly perturbed lipid homeostasis. To map the landscape of metabolic-transcriptional alterations in the context of virus infection, we performed an integrated transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis to simultaneously map genes and lipid metabolites in different pathways. As shown in Fig. 1c , integrative network modeling specifically revealed that the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway was most dramatically modulated by MERS-CoV infection. Collectively, we demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection triggered marked host lipid metabolic changes.",

Colorimetric assays reflecting cell viability were performed to select compounds that inhibited the cytopathic effects (CPE) that develop upon virus infection (Fig. 1d) . Screening conditions were optimized, in which at 0.1 MOI and 24 h post-MERS-CoV infection and at 0.01 MOI and 48 h post-H1N1 infection were chosen, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1b, c) . A lipid metabolite with anti-inflammatory effects, 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 , protected Huh7 cells against MERS-CoV infection, while the aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist FICZ and apoptosis regulatory messenger C16 Ceramide protected MDCK cells against H1N1 infection. Notably, AM580, a synthetic agonist, exhibited cell protection against both viruses and was selected for further investigations (Fig. 1d) . Interestingly, (R)methandamide, an agonist of cannabinoid receptor that functionally increased lipid accumulation in hepatocytes 17 , facilitated virus replication at non-toxic concentrations, thus caused more severe CPE than that of the virus control. These findings indicated that modulation of host lipid metabolism could significantly change the outcome of virus infection, thus corroborate with our hypothesis of modulating virus-induced lipid reprogramming for therapeutic intervention. Figure 3) . Overall, AM580 showed potent anti-MERS-CoV activity in cell cultures with significant inhibition of virus replication, cell protection, and anti-inflammatory responses. We previously established the human intestinal organoids (intestinoids) as an alternative route of virus transmission for MERS-CoV and an ideal tool for pharmacological evaluation 18 . Herein, we inoculated these intestinoids with 0.1 MOI of MERS-CoV and evaluated the effect of AM580. Our data demonstrated that AM580 treatment significantly (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) reduced MERS-CoV replication intra-and extra-cellularly (Fig. 2f , g). At 48 hpi, no PFU was detectable in AM580-treated intestinoid culture supernatants, representing a nearly 6-log 10 reduction in titers when compared with DMSO-treated controls (Fig. 2f) . The inhibition of MERS-CoV by AM580 was also evidenced by the markedly decreased expression of viral NP in the AM580-treated intestinoids when compared with the DMSOtreated intestinoids (Fig. 2h) . Collectively, we demonstrated that AM580 robustly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in human intestinoids.",

Mice in the AM580-treated group exhibited significantly less body weight loss (p < 0.05, Student's t-test) than that of the DMSO-treated group on days 4 and 5 post-infection (Fig. 3b) , and with lower lung tissue virus titers and viral loads (p < 0.01, Student's t-test) at days 2 and 4 ( Fig. 3c ; Supplementary  Figure 7e ). On day 4 post-challenge, the viral RNA load in brain tissues of the AM580-treated mice was undetectable and was 4log 10 lower than that of the DMSO-treated mice (Supplementary Figure 7e) . Histopathologic examination showed that alveolar damage and interstitial inflammatory infiltration in the lung tissues of the AM580-treated mice were substantially diminished compared to the control mice (Fig. 3d) . Collectively, these results demonstrated that AM580 effectively protected hDPP4transgenic mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge by inhibiting MERS-CoV replication and virus-associated pneumonia and encephalitis in vivo.",

To evaluate the role of SREBPs on MERS-CoV replication, we compared the growth of MERS-CoV in wild-type control cells (mock) and SREBP gene silencing or hyper-expression cells. Notably, transfection of SREBP1-or SREBP2-targeted siRNAs diminished the precursor SREBPs (pre-SREBPs) production, which significantly (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) reduced MERS-CoV replication (Fig. 4c) . Though the expression level of SREBP1 and SREBP2 in double knockdown is not more reduced than that of the individual knockdown because only 50% the amount of siRNA for each SREBP was applied, the double knockdown of both SREBPs resulted in about 2 log 10 (p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA) decrease of infectious virus particle when compared with the 1 log 10 reduction of individual knockdown, which indicated a potential synergistic effects when both activities of SREBP1 and SREBP2 were inhibited. Together, this result indicated that SREBPs were essential for MERS-CoV replication. Transactivation of lipid biosynthesis genes requires cleavage of pre-SREBPs to release their N-terminal nuclear forms (n-SREBPs), a process which is regulated by sterols 22 . Overexpression of either n-SREBP1 or n-SREBP2, however, diminished the antiviral potency of AM580 by about 1.5-log 10 upon MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 4d) . Together, these results indicated a pro-viral role of n-SREBPs in MERS-CoV replication and an inhibitory role of AM580 on n-SREBPs' activity.",

An AM580-derived probe with biotin and photo-affinity tags (AM580dp) was synthesized to facilitate the evaluation of its binding characteristics. The AM580dp was made by introducing a linker arm containing an azido end to the carboxylic acid group on AM580, yielding the azido-AM580, which was designed for further addition of a tri-functional linker with UV photo-affinity and biotin tags with specific probing functionalities (Fig. 5d) . Like AM580, azido-AM580 inhibited MERS-CoV replication in Huh7 and Vero cells (Supplementary Figure 5c) . Next, using an azidoreactive green fluorescent dye for localization, azido-AM580 was found largely in the host cell nucleus, which corroborated our hypothesis that AM580 may target a lipogenic transactivation event (Fig. 5e ). To capture the binding target, AM580dp was immobilized on streptavidin-conjugated agarose by its biotin group and incubated with transfected cell lysates expressing WT or Y335R n-SREBP1. RAR-\u03b1, a known AM580 receptor, was cotransfected as a control. After ultraviolet irradiation to activate the crosslinking photo-affinity tag in AM580dp, the protein-AM580dp complex was fixed and isolated. As shown in Fig. 5f , almost equal amounts of RAR-\u03b1 were precipitated by AM580dp in both WT or mutant Y335R n-SREBP1 groups, indicating that AM580dp was biologically functional. However, significantly more WT n-SREBP1 was detected than Y335R n-SREBP1, suggesting a stronger binding affinity between AM580 and WT n-SREBP1 than that of Y335R n-SREBP1. In addition, SRE binding activity of n-SREBP1 was significantly (p < 0.01, Student's t-test) diminished when Tyr335 was substituted with arginine, which highlighted the crucial role of Tyr335 in SRE recognition (Supplementary Figure 5d) .

To elucidate these downstream consequences, we investigated one of the SREBP-mediated pathways, fatty acid synthesis. First, we explored the ability of an endproduct of the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, sodium palmitate, to reverse the antiviral activity of AM580. Notably, both C75 (a FAS inhibitor specific for fatty acid biosynthesis pathway) and AM580 showed anti-MERS-CoV activity (Fig. 6a) . Addition of sodium palmitate did not affect the virus yield in MERS-CoV-infected cells treated with DMSO, but increased the virus yield (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) in MERS-CoV-infected cells treated with either AM580 or C75 (Fig. 6a) . This finding suggested that MERS-CoV replication hijacked host fatty acid synthesis, which can be inhibited through shut-down of lipogenic transactivation while rescued by exogenous palmitate. Next, we explored whether fatty acid synthesis was critically involved in the replication of other AM580-inhibited viruses. To this end, replication rescue assays using H1N1 (negative-strand RNA virus representative), EV-A71 (non-enveloped RNA virus representative), and AdV5 (DNA virus representative) were performed (Fig. 6b, d) . Indeed, significant (p < 0.05, Student's t-test) extents of rescue were achieved for these viruses and especially H1N1 virus (p < 0.01, Student's t-test) with addition of sodium palmitate.",

Using electron microscopy, perinuclear DMV clusters were readily detectable in MERS-CoV-infected cells (left panel, Fig. 6e ). In contrast, almost no DMVs were visualized after treatment by AM580 (right panel, Fig. 6e ). Since co-expression of nsp3 and nsp4 of MERS-CoV was sufficient to induce the DMV formation 26 , we used AM580 to treat the Huh7 cells co-transfected with nsp3 (~209 kDa) and nsp4 (~57 kDa) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 6f , no significant changes were detected in the expression levels of both viral proteins.

Palmitoylation, a downstream consequence of fatty acid synthesis, is a post-translational modification that modulates protein function and protein localization. In the context of influenza A viruses, the best characterized palmitoylated protein is the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) 27 . Therefore, we explored whether blockade of fatty acid synthesis would impede influenza HA palmitoylation and inhibit H1N1 replication. HAoverexpressed A549 cells were cultured with AM580 or vehicle (DMSO) or the positive control inhibitor 2-BP, which is specific against protein palmitoylation 28 . Palmitoylated HA protein was purified via resin-assisted capture. Strikingly, reduced levels of palmitoylated HA were observed with the addition of 2-BP (56%) and AM580 (69%) when compared with DMSO (100%) controls (Fig. 6f) . Moreover, 2-BP also showed inhibition against MERS-CoV and H1N1 replication in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 4b) . To examine the specificity, oleic acid, a downstream metabolite of palmitate was also used in the complementation assays. The result showed that additional oleic acid (100 \u00b5M) could not rescue the influenza A H1N1 virus replication but indeed complement the viral growth of MERS-CoV, ZIKV, and AdV5 (Fig. 6a, c, d) . This finding suggested that the palmitoylation of the viral HA was the main target of influenza A H1N1 virus inhibition by AM580. Overall, using DMV formation and viral protein palmitoylation as two important downstream consequences of SREBPs-dependent pathways, we demonstrated that the suppression of SREBPsdependent lipogenic transactivation reduced viral propagation fitness by intervening the downstream fatty acid biosynthetic pathway.",

SREBPs-mediated lipogenesis, affecting the building of membrane blocks, energy supply, and post-translational protein modification, is a complex process with cross talks and compensatory mechanisms that influence propagation of diverse groups of viruses (Fig. 7) .

Indeed, both betulin and a pre-SREBPs cleavage inhibitor PF 429242 exhibited some inhibitory effect on MERS-CoV replication at non-toxic concentrations ( Supplementary Figure 4a ). 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25HC), a cholesterol metabolite inhibiting infection by a broad range of pathogenic viruses, works indirectly through a 25HC sensor protein to elicit SCAP-Insig binding 29, 30 . While AM580 acts differently from the above inhibitors, these studies supports that proteolytic processing of SREBPs may also be a feasible target for broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. Similar to these studies, the use of cancer cell lines which usually underwent complex genetic and metabolic rearrangement may affect the interpretation of results 31 . In addition, usage of The importance of SREBP regulatory pathway has been implicated in the life cycle of hantavirus which is dependent on lipid synthesis for virus entry and membrane fusion process 33, 34 . This is also exemplified by the pharmacological inhibition of FAS by C75 or Cerulenin that impaired the replication of a broadspectrum of viruses. Specifically, HCMV and influenza A virus infections may require fatty acid synthesis to modulate membrane composition for viral budding or protein modifications 35 . Direct inhibition of FAS reduces infectivity of respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus serotype 16 by changing the membrane components of the virion progeny particles. DENV NS3 recruits FAS to sites of replication and stimulates fatty acid synthesis 36 . Distinct from those studies, our work underscores the indispensability of SREBP-mediated fatty acid synthesis to multiple post-virus-entry events, particularly for the emerging infectious viruses such as MERS-CoV and Influenza A virus. As examples, reduced DMV formation and viral protein palmitoylation are two important consequences of SREBP-controlled fatty acid synthesis inhibition (Fig. 6e, g) . Studies on other viral replication processes related to SREBP-mediated downstream pathways are warranted. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the inhibition of diverse viruses, including enveloped (MERS-CoV, H1N1) and nonenveloped (EV-A71) RNA, and DNA (AdV5) viruses, could be partially rescued by exogenously supplied palmitate and to different extents (Fig. 6a, d) . These results also support the requirement of de novo fatty acid synthesis for optimal viral replication. Moreover, transcriptional inactivation of lipogenic enzymes, in addition to FAS, may impair virus replication through diverse pathways in virus-specific manners (Fig. 7) .",

Possible \"offtarget\" effects of AM580 leading to its broad antiviral activity cannot be excluded as the compound was long known to be an RAR-\u03b1 agonist. Moreover, a small-molecule compound can be a multi-target binder due to its intrinsic structural features, while the elicited biological responses through one of the ligand-target interactions found presently may not necessarily account for the observed antiviral activity. Although teratogenic effects of AM580, as a pro-differentiation agonist and not a cytotoxic, have been reported in mouse models 37 , the anticipated therapeutic benefits outweigh its side effect when considering the short duration of 3-day treatment by AM580 in the animal experiments. In exploring AM580 analogs with comparable potency and improved bioavailability, tamibarotene 38 , an orally active retinoid for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia was identified (Supplementary Table 1 ).

First, we used an immunofluorescence test to visualize the distribution patterns of cellular lipid droplets (LDs) and cholesterol in the presence or absence of AM580 in MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells, which are liver cells highly active in lipid metabolism. Infection by MERS-CoV markedly enhanced the accumulation of LDs and cholesterol, whereas addition of AM580 significantly reduced their accumulation(Fig. 4a). To validate this observation, mRNA expression of lipogenic genes in the lipid biosynthesis pathways were investigated. Significant decreases in mRNA expression were detected in 13/17 (76.5%) genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (upper panel,Fig. 4b) and 10/12 (83.3%) genes in cholesterol synthesis pathways (lower panel,Fig. 4b) in AM580-treated infected cells, when compared In vivo antiviral activity of AM580. a DDP4 transgenic mice were treated by intraperitoneal inoculation of AM580 (red square) or 0.1% DMSO (placebo control, black triangle) for 3 days starting 6 h post-challenge with 50PFU of MERS-CoV. Survivals and clinical disease were monitored for 14 days or until death. Differences in survival rates between groups were compared using Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests. b Daily body weights of surviving mice. Student's t-test was used to compare different groups on each day post-infection. c Lung and brain tissues were collected for detection of viral yields using both plaque assay and RT-qPCR assays(Supplementary Figure 7).

Moreover, the profound increase of the major lipogenic enzymes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS) associated with MERS-CoV infection indicated that the virus rapidly upregulated lipid biosynthesis, while AM580 might antagonize these changes, thereby reducing virus replication.",

Scale bar: 20 \u00b5m. b The expression of multiple genes in fatty acid (upper) and cholesterol (lower) synthesis pathways were analyzed by RT-qPCR, respectively. * indicates p < 0.05 comparing DMSO and AM580 by one-way ANOVA. c siRNA knockdown of either SREBP1 (two distinct siRNA 1_1 and 1_2) or 2 (siRNA 2_1 and 2_2) or both SREBP1 and 2 (siRNA 1_2 and 2_2) reduced MERS-CoV replication. The knockdown efficiency and specificity was evaluated with western blot. siRNAtreated cells (100 nM siRNA for single knockdown and 50 nM each for double knockdown for 48 h) were infected with MERS-CoV (0.001 MOI and 24 hpi). Viral titer in the cell culture supernatant was evaluated with plaque assay. One-way ANOVA was used for comparison with the control siRNA pretreated group. d Hyper-expression of nuclear form SREBP1 and SREBP2 by transfection to Huh7 cells for 24 h, respectively, followed by MERS-CoV infection and (1 MOI, 12 hpi) AM580 treatment as indicated. Overexpression of n-SREBP1 and n-SREBP2 were analyzed by western blot using anti-flag tag antibodies. Differences in viral titer were compared with the vector-transfected control and analyzed using Student's t-test. e AM580 inhibited transactivation of lipogenic genes such as FAS (blue dots) and HMGCS (red square) but not LXRE (black triangle). Huh7 cells transfected with the indicated reporter plasmid were treated with serial-dilutions of AM580 for 24 h. For virus infection assays, AM580 was added after virus absorption; for luciferase assay, AM580 was added 6 h after plasmid transfection. Student's t-test was used to compare the AM580-treated with DMSO-treated groups. The experiments were performed in triplicate and replicated twice. The results are shown as mean \u00b1 s.d. **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05",
