Virus specific epitopes could benefit for developing JEV specific antibodies detection methods. To identify the JEV specific epitopes, we fully mapped and characterized the continuous B-cell epitope of the PrM/M protein of JEV. Results: To map the epitopes on the PrM/M protein, we designed a set of 20 partially overlapping fragments spanning the whole PrM, fused them with GST, and expressed them in an expression vector. Linear epitope M14 ( 105 VNKKEAWLDSTKATRY 120 ) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By removing amino acid residues individually from the carboxy and amino terminal of peptide M14, we confirmed that the minimal unit of the linear epitope of PrM/M was M14-13 ( 108 KEAWLDSTKAT 118 ). This epitope was highly conserved across different JEV strains. Moreover, this epitope did not cross-react with WNV-positive and DENV-positive sera. Conclusion: Epitope M14-13 was a JEV specific lineal B-cell epitpe. The results may provide a useful basis for the development of epitope-based virus specific diagnostic clinical techniques.",

The virus belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae; about 35,000-50,000 cases of and 10,000 deaths from JEV infection are reported annually [1] . JEV was first isolated in Japan in 1935, following which it spread to most other Asian countries. At present, this virus is even found in regions beyond its ecological boundaries. Recently, JEV has spread to regions as far as northern Australia [2, 3] . Hence, there is a concern that JEV might become a global threat. In fact, it is not unusual to find 2 or more flaviviruses co-circulating in one area. In Southeast Asia, the most important flaviviruses are JEV and dengue viruses (DENV) [4] . In northern Australia, Kunjin virus is found to co-circulate with JEV [5] . In Vladivostok, Russia, studies have reported the detection of WNV in birds [6] . In addition, there is evidence that WNV infection in India from Japanese encephalitis nonendemic areas and endemic areas [7] .",

JEV contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome with a size of 11 kb; the genome encodes 3 structural proteins, namely, core protein (C), premembrane protein (prM/M), and envelope protein (E), and 7 nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5). Of the 10 proteins, the E protein is the dominant antigen responsible for eliciting neutralizing antibodies and plays an important role in inducing immunologic responses in the infected host. However, antibodies against the E proteins of the 3 aforementioned flaviviruses could cross-reactive with each other. Previous reports [9, 10] show that in western blot (WB) prM protein may be used to serologically differentiate individuals infected with JEV from those infected with DENV, WNV and SLEV. Our preliminary WB results for JEV-positive sera also showed that prM reactivity could be used to differentiate JEV-positive sera from WNV-and DENV-positive sera. Hence, prM and antibodies against prM would be useful for conducting seroepidemiological studies of flavivirus infections in the regions that have prevalence of more than one flavivirus. However, because prM is a membrane protein, it is difficult to express it in Escherichia coli or other expression systems. In this report, we mapped and identified a linear B-cell epitope on the prM/M protein of JEV.",

Using the GST fusion protein set and the pooled JEV-positive swine sera, we mapped the linear epitope of the JEV PrM/M protein. The ELISA results indicated that the epitope was located in the M14 region ( 105 VNKKEAWLDSTKATRY 120 ). Moreover, by individually removing amino acid residues from the carboxy and amino terminals of the peptide M14, we confirmed that the minimal unit of the linear epitope of PrM/M was M14-13 ( 108 KEAWLDSTKAT 118 ). Sequence alignment showed that the epitope was greatly conserved across different JEV strains. Of the 24 selected JEV strains, only 1, i.e., strain JKT6468-a genotype 4 JEV strain-has one amino acid residue ( 113 N) different from that of the epitope M14-13 ( 113 D). However, further analysis revealed that this amino acid residue replacement ( 113 D to 113 N) did not affect the reactivity of the epitope to MAb 2F7-and JEV-positive swine sera.",

Serological cross-reactivity was mainly observed because these virus antigens contain the same immunodominant E glycoprotein epitopes responsible for eliciting a large proportion of cross-reactive serum antibodies during viral infection [13] . In this study, we identified a linear epitope from the PrM/M protein; this epitope could react with the JEV-positive swine sera and rabbit sera but not with rabbit anti-DENV and anti-WNV sera. The homogeneity between this linear epitope and all 4 serotype DENV PrM/M protein was less than 40%. Moreover, the same domains of the PrM/M protein from WNV did not react with the swine-anti JEV sera. and MAb 2F7. And only peptide lineage II strain 956 WNV showed weakly reactive with MAb 2F7 and epetide lineage I strain NY99 did not reactive with MAb 2F7. However around the world the predominant WNV were lineage I and lineage II consists exclusively of viruses from southern Africa and Madagascar and rare Europe district [14] . Hence, we confirmed that the epitope M14-13 was virus specific and could be potentially used in serological monitoring and for differential diagnosis of JEV infection.",

The virus strains listed in this figure were selected as representative strains. Abbreviations of each virus and GenBank accession numbers are listed in the parentheses. (B, C) The epitope homology peptides of WNV were expressed and analyzed by ELISA using MAb 2F7. The homology peptide of WNV strain NY99 did not react with MAb 2F7, while the homology peptide of WNV strain 956 was weakly reactive with MAb 2F7 (B). JEV-positive swine sera also did not reactive with the homology peptide of WNV (C).",
