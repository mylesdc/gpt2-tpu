            "text": "Modulation of oxidative stress is therapeutically effective in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Myricitrin, a naturally occurring phenolic compound, is a potent antioxidant. However, little is known about its effect on I/R injury to cardiac myocytes. The present study was performed to investigate the potential protective effect of myricitrin against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced H9c2 cardiomyocyte injury and its underlying mechanisms. Myricitrin pretreatment improved cardiomyocyte viability, inhibited ROS generation, maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced apoptotic cardiomyocytes, decreased the caspase-3 activity, upregulated antiapoptotic proteins and downregulated proapoptotic proteins during H/R injury. Moreover, the potential targets of myricitrin was predicted using Discovery Studio software, and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) was identified as the main disease-related target. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that 17-AAG, a pharmacologic inhibitor of Hsp90, significantly blocked the myricitrin-induced cardioprotective effect demonstrated by increased apoptosis and ROS generation. These results suggested that myricitrin provides protection to H9c2 cardiomyocytes against H/R-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis, most likely via increased expression of Hsp90.",

Accumulating evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies strongly suggests that apoptosis is one of the major mechanisms of cardiomyocyte injury following hypoxia and ischemia-reperfusion (Lam et al., 2013) . Reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction plays a crucial role in myocyte apoptosis during I/R injury (Takano et al., 2003) . Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) initiates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by inducing massive ROS production and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, which stimulates cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation, and subsequent caspase-3 activation, ultimately resulting in apoptosis (Ryter et al., 2007) . Hence, the inhibition of intracellular ROS levels and prevention of cardiomyocyte apoptosis are effective strategies to ameliorate myocardial I/R injury.",

It has been shown that myricitrin possesses considerable antioxidant activity (Sun et al., 2013a; Domitrovic et al., 2015) , antinociceptive action (Meotti et al., 2007) , antiinflammatory activity (Shimosaki et al., 2011) , and anti-fibrotic activity (Geng et al., 2016) . We previously demonstrated that myricitrin is able to protect endothelia cells against ROS-induced apoptosis and prevent plaque formation at an early stage in an atherosclerotic mouse model (Sun et al., 2013a; Qin et al., 2015) . We also reported that myricitrin inhibits high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis to prevent diabetic cardiomyopathy (Zhang et al., 2016) . These experiments have indicated that myricitrin can be used for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. However, there are few reports on the effects and mechanisms of myricitrin on cardiomyocyte apoptosis following I/R. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of myricitrin on H9c2 cardiomyocytes subjected to H/R to simulate I/R. The underlying molecular targets of myricitrin against I/R injury were also elucidated using bioinformatics approaches.",

Myricitrin, belonging to the flavonol subgroup, reportedly possesses effective antioxidant activity (Domitrovic et al., 2015) , with stronger free radical scavenging activity than other flavonol rhamnosides or quercetin (Wu et al., 2008) . Similarly, the results of the present study clearly showed that ROS production was well preserved as a result of myricitrin pretreatment during H/R; this effect was accompanied by significantly elevated activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT and decreased levels of MDA, suggesting that the cardioprotective effects of myricitrin against I/R are largely associated with its anti-oxidative capacity.",

            "text": "In addition to producing oxidative injury, cardiomyocyte apoptosis is also one of the major contributors to the development of myocardial I/R injury (van Empel et al., 2005) . Hypoxia and excess ROS alter the mitochondrial structure and trigger mitochondrial depolarization as well as dissipation of m (Sinha et al., 2013) . Disruption of m induces the release of proapoptotic molecules from the mitochondria and subsequently activates caspases, resulting in apoptosis (Sinha et al., 2013) . In the present study, the results indicated that myricitrin maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased caspase-9 activity and caspase-3 activation, and Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org reduced the apoptosis rate of the H9c2 cardiomyocytes against H/R. Caspase-3 activity can be induced by proapoptotic Bax and inhibited by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 (Kaushal et al., 2004) . Western blot analysis showed that myricitrin increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio compared with the H/R group. These data demonstrated that myricitrin effectively inhibits H/R-induced apoptosis and provides further evidence supporting its anti-apoptotic role (Qin et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016) . Myricitrin interacts with proteins, such as PI-3 kinase, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), PKC\u03b1, and PKC\u03b5 (Pereira et al., 2011; Schwanke et al., 2013; Qin et al., 2015) . In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that myricitrin potently inhibits calcium transport, likely through the interaction of the phenolic groups of this flavonoid with the Ca 2+ transporting protein (Thiyagarajah et al., 1991; Meotti et al., 2007) . In the present study, we investigated the potential targets that may have significant relationships with the pharmacologic effects of myricitrin using bioinformatics approaches. Among the targets of myricitrin, the main protein involved in I/R injury is HSP90. Hsp90, as an abundant chaperone that regulates cell signaling and the functions of many proteins that bind to it, referred to as \"client proteins\" (Wang et al., 2009) . According to previous studies, Hsp90 is a direct effector that enables the activation of the prosurvival PI3K/Akt pathway (Barksdale and Bijur, 2009 ). In recent years, studies have shown that Hsp90 mediates the mitochondrial import of PKC\u03b5 (Budas et al., 2010; Zhong et al., 2014) and plays an integral role in endothelial NOS signaling (Amour et al., 2009) , thereby efficiently protecting the myocardium against I/R injury (Kupatt et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2016) . Furthermore, Hsp90 facilitates the inhibitory effect of HAX-1 on SR calcium uptake, which is protective in I/R injury (Lam et al., 2013) . Thus, we speculated that Hsp90 is one of the targets of myricitrin to relieve the H/R injury of cardiomyocytes.",

            "text": "Next, we further investigated the roles of Hsp90 in the cardioprotection of myricitrin against H/R injury. As expected, myricitrin pretreatment obviously blocked the inhibitory effect of H/R on the expression of Hsp90. Hsp90 acts as an upstream regulator of the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt survival pathway during cellular stress (Barksdale and Bijur, 2009) . We previously showed that myricitrin mediates cardiovascular protection through activation of the Akt signaling pathway (Qin et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016) . In the present study, the addition of the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG substantially decreased Akt phosphorylation induced by myricitrin, thereby attenuating the prosurvival effects of the PI3-K/Akt pathway. In addition, inhibition of Hsp90 by 17-AAG markedly abolished myricitrininduced cardioprotection against H/R injury, as shown by the increased overproduction of mitochondrial ROS and loss of MMP. These findings are consistent with recent reports that Hsp90 is anti-apoptotic in cardiomyocytes through antioxidation and the preservation of mitochondrial function under stress conditions (Wu et al., 2012) . Based on these results, we suggest that Hsp90 is involved in the cardio-protective effects of myricitrin and that the interaction between myricitrin and Hsp90 may promote the anti-apoptotic PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes during H/R injury.",

Although more experiments are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying this protection because HSP90 associates with a variety of other signaling molecules, these results suggest that myricitrin may be a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of myocardial I/R injury.",
