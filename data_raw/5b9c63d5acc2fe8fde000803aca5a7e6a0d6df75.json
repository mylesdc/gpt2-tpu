Consequently, the compounds 7 and 9 adopt conformations in which two 4-hydroxycoumarin moieties are anti-disposed. Antiviral activity evaluation results indicated that the 4-bromobenzylidene derivative of bis-(4-hydroxycoumarin) (compound 3) possesses inhibitory activity against HSV-1 (KOS), HSV-2 (G), vaccinia virus and HSV-1 TK -KOS (ACV r ) at a concentration of 9-12 \u03bcM and at a minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) greater than 20 \u03bcM.

They are also involved in the actions of plant growth hormones and growth regulators, the control over the respiration and photosynthesis, as well as in the defense against various infections [1] . Although most of the existing natural coumarins have been isolated from higher plants, some of them have been discovered in microorganisms, e.g., aminocoumarin antibiotics: Novobiocin, coumermycin A 1 and chlorobiocin (produced by the actinomycete Streptomyces niveus) [2] .",

Subsequent in situ reaction of the chromon with 4-hydroxycoumarin already present in excess in the reaction mixture gave dimeric coumarin derivatives 1-15 bearing an aryl substituent in the central methylene linker.

Proton-decoupled 13 C-NMR spectra showed C-F coupling constants that enabled straightforward identification of fluorinated carbon atoms and their neighbors. In the 1 H spectrum of 1, 2, 4 and 10, which were dissolved in non-polar solvents, well resolved hydroxyl protons were observed in the range from \u03b4 11.3 to 11.5 ppm (see Experimental section for details). The strongly deshielded signals suggest that OH protons are most probably involved in hydrogen bond formation. In addition, two set of 1 H-NMR signals were observed for H5 and H5\" protons which indicates a slight difference in magnetic environment for otherwise symmetrical moieties. Furthermore, hydroxyl protons, which were observed between \u03b4 11.8 and 12.3 ppm for benzopyranocoumarin derivatives 16, 18 and 20, are most likely involved in hydrogen bonds.",

Conformational properties of 5, 14 and 20 were assessed with the use of 1D NOE difference experiments. Key NOE enhancements are shown in Figure 2 . The saturation of H* in 5 resulted in weak NOE at H6' (1.5%) and 2'-OCH 3 (0.8%, Figure 2a ). Likewise, the saturation of H* in 14 gave moderate NOE at H6' (3.7%) and weak NOE at 2'-OCH 3 (0.8%). These observations suggested nonrestricted rotation along C*-C1' bonds in 5 and 14. No NOEs indicative of relative orientations of individual heterocyclic moieties were observed for 20. Interestingly, benzopyranocoumarin derivatives 16, 18 and 20 showed two sets of signals in the 1 H spectrum for coumarin protons. One set of 1 H signals (H5-H8 protons) exhibited broader line-widths with respect to multiplets attributed to H5\"-H8\" protons. This phenomenon was studied in more detail for 20 by variable temperature experiments in the range from 298 to 358 K. As an example, broad multiplet at \u03b4 8.00 ppm corresponding to H5 becomes sharper at higher temperatures ( Figure 3 ). This suggests that rotation along C*-C3 bond is restricted at lower temperatures, most likely due to formation of hydrogen bond between the C4-OH and C2\" carbonyl group (for enumeration of atoms c.f. Figure 2 ).",

In general, the geometry of the molecules agrees with closely related structures [19] [20] [21] . This asymmetry, which is also found in similar structures, may be a consequence of steric crowding within the molecules. Because of the same reason all principal bond angles about C11 are widened over normal tetrahedral values, ranging from 112.5(2) to 115.4(2)\u00b0 in 7 and 111.75 (12) to 115.63(12)\u00b0 in 9. The coumarin rings are slightly distorted from planarity, with two planes inclined at 57.83(11)\u00b0 and 59.55(5)\u00b0 to each other in 7 and 9, respectively. The 4-hydroxycoumarin moieties are intramolecularly hydrogen bonded between hydroxyl and carbonyl oxygen atoms in both structures (see Figures 4a and 4b and Table S1 in ESI), thus forming two eight-membered rings. Thus, compounds 7 and 9 adopt a conformation in which two 4-hydroxycoumarin moieties are anti-disposed. Benzylidene bis (4-hydroxycoumarin) derivatives 7 and 9 form supramolecular self-assemblies by C\u2212H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds (Figures S1 and S2, see ESI) in which infinite chains are extended by one F\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F interaction between trifluoromethyl fluorine atoms in 7 [F2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F2 i = 2.934(5) \u00c5; (i): \u2212x, \u2212y, \u2212z] and one \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interaction in 9. The distance between the ring centroids of coplanar C5'-C10' rings [\u03b1 = 0 o ] in 9 is 3.6832(12) \u00c5, the planes are separated by 3.5132(8) \u00c5 and centroids offset is ca. 1.11 \u00c5.",

The intensities were corrected for absorption using the multi-scan absorption correction method [22] . The crystal structures were solved by direct methods [23] and all non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically by full-matrix least-squares calculations [23] based on F 2 using the programs integrated in WinGX [24] program package. The hydrogen atoms attached to the O3 and O3' atoms in 7 and 9, O3A and O3B atoms in 16 and O3 atom in 18 were found in a difference Fourier map and are refined with O-H distance restraint of 0.82 \u00c5. All other hydrogen atoms were treated using appropriate riding models, with SHELXL97 defaults [23] . Fluorine atoms of trifluoromethyl group in 7 are heavily disordered and restraints on anisotropic displacement parameters were therefore used in their refinement. The C29 and C31 atoms of ethanol molecules in 16 are disordered with the site occupancy factors refined to 0.62(3)/0.38(3) and 0.52(3)/0.48(3) ratio, respectively. Details of crystal data, data collection and refinement parameters are given in Table 3 . PLATON [25] program was used for structure analysis and molecular and crystal structure drawings preparation.

Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) in the presence of varying concentrations (100, 40, 8, 1.6 and 0.32 \u00b5M) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The anti-HIV activity and cytotoxicity of the compounds were evaluated against wild-type HIV-1 strain III B in MT-4 cell culture using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. MT-4 cells were suspended in culture medium at 1 \u00d7 10 5 cells/mL and infected with HIV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.02. Immediately after viral infection, 100 \u00b5L of the cell suspension was placed in each well of a flat-bottomed microtiter tray containing various concentrations of the test compounds. After four days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the number of viable cells was determined using the MTT method. Compounds were tested in parallel for cytotoxic effects in uninfected MT-4 cells.",

Accordingly, two 4-hydroxycoumarin moieties in compounds 7 and 9 are anti-disposed. The 4-bromobenzylidene derivative of bis(4-hydroxycoumarin) (3) exerted some inhibitory activity against HSV-1 (KOS), HSV-2 (G), vaccinia virus and HSV-1 TK -KOS (ACV r ) in the range of 9-12 \u03bcM at minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) greater than 20 \u03bcM, whereas the compounds 4-6, 8, and 20 exhibited rather pronounced anti-Feline Herpes Virus activity (EC 50 = 5-8.1 \u03bcM) but with MCC at only 4-7-fold higher than EC 50 values.",

Such activity is within the same magnitude as that of the plant lectin Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) [10] (EC 50 = 6 \u03bcM) but less active than Hyppeastrum hybride agglutinin (HHA) [12] (EC 50 = 0.38 \u03bcM). However it should be noted that the novel compounds showed cytostatic activities at concentrations that are only 4-5-fold higher than the antiviral active concentrations and therefore, it can be questioned whether the antiviral effect observed represents a direct antiviral effect or elicited indirectly by the cytotoxic activity of the test compounds. Similarly, the compounds 4-6, 8 and 20 exhibited anti-Feline Herpes Virus activity (EC 50 = 5-8.1 \u03bcM) the MCC were only 4-7-fold higher than the EC 50 values (Table 2, only selected data for compounds 1, 4-6, 7, 8 and 20 are shown).",
