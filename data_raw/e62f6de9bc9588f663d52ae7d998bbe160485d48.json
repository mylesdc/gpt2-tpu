The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of TGF-\u03b2 expression in acute hantavirus infection. Results: We retrospectively studied 77 patients hospitalised with acute Puumala infection during a hantavirus epidemic in Germany in 2012. Hantavirus infection was confirmed by positive anti-Puumala hantavirus IgG and IgM. Plasma levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22 were analysed. Based on glomerular filtration rate on admission, patients were divided in mild and severe course of disease. Puumala virus RNA was detected by PCR amplification of the viral L segment gene. Out of 77 Puumala virus infected patients, 52 (68%) were male. A seasonal distribution was detected in our cohort with a peak in summer 2012, the highest incidence was observed in the age group of 30-39 years. Puumala virus RNA was detectable in 4/77 cases. Patients with severe disease had a significant longer hospital stay than patients with mild disease (6.2 vs 3.6 days). Thrombocyte count (186 vs 225 per nl), serum TGF-\u03b21 (74 vs 118 ng/l) and TGF-\u03b22 (479 vs 586 pg/l) were significantly lower in severe compared to mild disease. However, C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly higher in patients with severe disease (62 vs 40 mg/l). TGF-\u03b21/Cr was the most sensitive and specific marker associated with renal dysfunction.",

            "text": "Three main clinical syndromes can be distinguished after hantavirus infection, i.e. hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) mainly caused by Seoul, Puumala and Dobrava viruses; nephropathia epidemica, a mild form of HFRS caused by Puumala virus; and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, which may be caused by Andes virus and Sin Nombre virus. There is no curative treatment for hantavirus infection, and eliminating or minimising contact with rodents is the best way to prevent infection [1] . The case fatality rate of HFRS varies from <1% to 12% depending on the virus type [2] . Over 50 000 nephropathia epidemica cases with Puumala virus infections have been registered in Europe, and even over 175 000 in Western Russia [3] . Approximately 150,000 to 200,000 humans are hospitalized each year because of hantavirus infections worldwide [2] . European hantaviruses of the family Bunyaviridae cause HFRS. Infection in humans occurs through inhalation of aerosolised virus particles from excreta of chronically infected wild rodents [4] . Puumala is reported throughout most of Europe (excluding the Mediterranean region) wheras Dobrava, carried by the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and Saaremaa, carried by the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), are reported mainly in eastern and central Europe [5] . In Germany, several hantaviruses pathogenic for humans are circulating, i.e. Puumala virus, Dobrava virus and Tula virus [6, 7] . Puumala virus is carried by the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) and leads mostly to a mild form of disease [3] .",

The most common symptoms are high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache and nausea or vomiting. Proteinuria, haematuria and acute kidney injury are signs of renal involvement. Classically, HFRS occurs in five distinct phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, polyuric and convalescent [8] . A severe course of disease comprises oliguria, high blood creatinine and a high leukocyte count [9] , the disease severity depends on the hantavirus genotype. A minority of patients needs transient dialysis treatment, but complete recovery is the usual outcome [10, 11] . Outinen et al. defined the severity of hantavirus infection by serum creatinine and thrombocytes count [12] . The role of immune response and cytokine expression during Puumala virus infection has been described previously [13, 14] . Techniques for the identification of novel hantaviruses by specific cell culture models had been established [15] . Only few cases of Puumala virus infection with severe disease had been reported for Germany recently [16, 17] .",

There are only few reports about the role of anti-inflammatory and suppressive cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 in hantavirus infection. Temonen et al. investigated kidney biopsies of patients with nephropathia epidemica and described an increased expression of the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, and platelet-derived growth factormainly in the peritubular area of the distal nephron. Concomitantly also at the same location expression of the endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM, and PECAM was seen [27] . Similarly, it was shown in a more recent study of deer mice infected with Sin Nombre virus, that TGF-\u03b21 expressing regulatory T cells may play an important role in limiting immunopathology in the natural reservoir host, but this response may interfere with viral clearance [28] . In a previous study it was shown that disease severity characterized by elevated creatinine and low platelet counts was correlated with high pro-inflammatory IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 but low immunosuppressive TGF-\u03b21 levels and vice versa, suggesting the induction of a protective immune mechanism to downregulate or even prevent a massive pro-inflammatory immune response [14] . Klempa et al. described mild and severe cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in patients infected with Dobrava-Belgrade virus in Russia [29] . In accordance with our results, they found a high number of patients with headache in severe hantavirus infection and elevated creatinine in severe course of the disease. In the current study, we were able to illustrate the role of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u00df2 as major protective markers of hantavirus infection. With increased production in patients with severe disease as a response to inflammation [30, 31] , TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22 serum levels reached similar levels in both patient groups one week after admission. Obviously, patients with severe disease generate TGF-\u00df delayed compared to patients with mild disease allowing stronger proinflammatory cytokine responses and inflammation in these patients. TGF-\u03b2 has a pivotal function in the immune system and controls the initiation and resolution of inflammatory responses through the regulation of chemotaxis, activation, and survival of lymphocytes, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, mast cells, and granulocytes [32] . There are reports of increased TGF-\u03b2 during many viral infections, such as influenza, HIV, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection. The neuraminidase glycoprotein of influenza A and B viruses have been shown to directly activate latent TGF-\u03b2 [32] . Prognostic and predictive values of TGF-\u03b2 in acute viral infections have not been studied.",

Inflammatory cell infiltrations and tubular damage were found in the kidneys, and these infiltrations contained mainly CD8 T-cells [33] . As reported by Rook et al., TGF-\u03b2 exerts profound inhibitory effects on T and B lymphocyte proliferation [34] . T regulatory (Treg)-and T suppressor (Ts)-mediated immunosuppression appears to depend on two pathways: cell-cell contact and cytokine secretion, whereby cytokine secretion is assumed to be more important. Intracellular cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 are characteristic for certain Treg subsets and are related with induced Treg function. Stimulation by mitogens significantly induce TGF-\u03b2 + -Treg and -Ts. Tregs are an important component in regulating the magnitude of the immune response to infection, thus preventing excessive inflammation and tissue damage [35] . In previous studies it was suggested that IFN-\u03b3secreting Treg are forming the first line of immunoregulatory T cells during an initiated immune response, followed by IL-2 \u2212 , IL-10 + , or TGF-\u03b2 + Treg. Thus, high serum levels of TGF-\u03b2s during the acute phase and convalescence period of hantavirus infection might be a protective parameter against pro-inflammatory cytokines and endothelial injury. We found a positive correlation of both TGF-\u03b2s with platelet counts and GFR. In contrast to TGF-\u03b2s, serum sCD30 and neopterin showed no significant correlation with main symptoms of disease.",

Patients were included in the study if both, hantavirus IgG and IgM were positive. Positive results of IgG and negative results of IgM for hantavirus may also indicate an infection with mild clinical symptoms. However, for these patients with positive IgG and negative IgM for hantavirus, reference samples were available indicating no acute but past hantavirus infection. Consequently, these patients had been excluded from the study. PCR for the detection of hantavirus RNA was performed on the L-segment [36] . For phylogenetic analysis positive samples were subsequently sequenced in the S-segment [18] . Characteristics of the sequence analysis are given in the legend to the figure.",

For ease of viewing, TGF-\u03b21 is shown in ng/ml, whereas TGF-\u03b22 and TGF-\u03b23 are shown in pg/ml. Serum neopterin was measured with the Neopterin ELISA kit (Brahms, Berlin, Germany). Based on control measurements in 36 healthy individuals, neopterin concentrations >15 nmol/l is considered above normal range. Sera were tested for serum sCD30 content using a commercially available ELISA kit (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria).
