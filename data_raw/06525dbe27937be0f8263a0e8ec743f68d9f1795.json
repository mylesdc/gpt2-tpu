            "text": "The need for a names-based cyber-infrastructure for digital biology is based on the argument that scientific names serve as a standardized metadata system that has been used consistently and near universally for 250 years. As we move towards data-centric biology, name-strings can be called on to discover, index, manage, and analyze accessible digital biodiversity information from multiple sources. Known impediments to the use of scientific names as metadata include synonyms, homonyms, mis-spellings, and the use of other strings as identifiers. We here compare the name-strings in GenBank, Catalogue of Life (CoL), and the Dryad Digital Repository (DRYAD) to assess the effectiveness of the current names-management toolkit developed by Global Names to achieve interoperability among distributed data sources. New tools that have been used here include Parser (to break name-strings into component parts and to promote the use of canonical versions of the names), a modified TaxaMatch fuzzy-matcher (to help manage typographical, transliteration, and OCR errors), and Cross-Mapper (to make comparisons among data sets). The data sources include scientific names at multiple ranks; vernacular (common) names; acronyms; strain identifiers and other surrogates including idiosyncratic abbreviations and concatenations. About 40% of the name-strings in GenBank are scientific names representing about 400,000 species or infraspecies and their synonyms. \u2021 \u00a7 | \u00b6,# \u00a9 Patterson D et al.

            "text": "Of the formally-named terminal taxa (species and lower taxa) represented, about 82% have a match in CoL. Using a subset of content in DRYAD, about 45% of the identifiers are names of species and infraspecies, and of these only about a third have a match in CoL. With simple processing, the extent of matching between DRYAD and CoL can be improved to over 90%. The findings confirm the necessity for name-processing tools and the value of scientific names as a mechanism to interconnect distributed data, and identify specific areas of improvement for taxonomic data sources. Some areas of diversity (bacteria and viruses) are not well represented by conventional scientific names, and they and other forms of strings (acronyms, identifiers, and other surrogates) that are used instead of names need to be managed in reconciliation services (mapping alternative name-strings for the same taxon together). On-line resolution services will bring older scientific names up to date or convert surrogate name-strings to scientific names should such names exist. Examples are given of many of the aberrant forms of 'names' that make their way into these databases. The occurrence of scientific names with incorrect authors, such as chresonyms within synonymy lists, is a quality-control issue in need of attention. We propose a future-proofing solution that will empower stakeholders to take advantage of the name-based infrastructure at little cost. This proposed infrastructure includes a standardized system that adopts or creates UUIDs for name-strings, software that can identify name-strings in sources and apply the UUIDs, reconciliation and resolution services to manage the name-strings, and an annotation environment for quality control by users of name-strings. 2 Patterson D et al. 4 Patterson D et al. 6 Patterson D et al. 8 Patterson D et al.",

Within this emerging area, names are said to have a special role (Patterson et al. 2010; Pyle 2016) because, from the time of Linnaeus, biologists have applied a convention of forming and using scientific names. Scientific names annotate almost all useful biological statements for most of the intervening 250 years. They still play that role, but are supplemented increasingly with records in which organisms are identified through molecular sequence data -such as molecular barcodes (Hebert et al. 2003 , Federhen et al. 2016 . Names act as a system of metadata with which we can organize open distributed data in a biologically meaningful way, and as such they make larger scale studies possible. Projects such as LifeWatch, Atlas of Living Australia and especially Encyclopedia of Life rely on names to organize content (Fuentes and Fiore 2014, Patterson 2010) . The Global Names Architecture is a vision to make a names-based cyberinfrastructure available for open and free use. Along with phylogenetic informatics ( Parr et al. 2012) , molecular bioinformatics, ecoinformatics (Michener and Jones 2012), and ontologies (Bard and Rhee 2004), a names-based cyberinfrastructure will make possible collaborative projects that extend across the scope and scale of biology, and create new opportunities for discovery.",

They include incorrectly formed names, changes to the correct name for a taxon, or the use of the same namestring (the sequence of characters, digits, and spaces that makes up the name) for more than one taxon (Patterson et al. 2010 ). This has led to a collection of environments and tools (see Peng et al. 2012 for overview) and standard names-lists (e. g. Zermoglio et al. 2016 ) to help manage the use of names both as metadata and to prevent the use of names that are mis-spelled or no longer are endorsed as the correct name by any taxonomic authorities. The Global Names Architecture (GNA) is a vision for an underlying free and open names-based cyber-infrastructure that will provide services (such as confirming spelling, authority informationm or indicating if the name has been rendered into synonymy) to users of names by drawing on expert sources of taxonomic and nomenclatural knowledge and adding value to them with new tools and data management environments. Some of the GNA tools are included in this study, but not all contingencies have been addressed, nor are all tools developed to deliver production grade (aiming at 95% satisfaction) services as yet. GNA aims to be dynamic (see below) and to embrace differing views as to the correct name for a taxon -views that are held in 'Taxonomic Authority Files' (van den Berghe et al. 2015) .",

Because of it, a search initiated with a single name-string may not find content that applies to a taxon because it was labelled with a different name. This problem has many causes. One is if species are moved to a different genus. The cryptophyte known as Chilomonas paramecium was moved to Cryptomonas when the species paramecium was found to have a sister group relationship with species within Cryptomonas (Hoef-Emden and Melkonian 2008) . In response, the species was moved to Cryptomonas and a second name, Cryptomonas paramecium, was created for the same species. The new name is a homotypic (objective or nomenclatural) synonym of the first name (see glossary of terms). That is, additional names are created for the same taxon because of new taxonomic and phylogenetic insights.",

Triactinomyxon gyrosalmo and Myxosoma cerebralis are different lifehistory stages of the same species, a discovery that came long after the stages were described as separate species (Wolf and Markiw 1984) . The two names are heterotypic (taxonomic or subjective) synonyms. The issue of two 'species' being found to be different stages in the life history of a single species is common among fungi that have sexual (teleomorph) and asexual (anamorph) reproductive stages; Hypocrea jecorina and Trichoderma reesei are scientific names for the teleomorph and anamorphic states of a single fungus species, respectively. Third, not all taxonomists agree about everything all of the time. More than one name may be endorsed for the same taxon at the same time by different taxonomists.

            "text": "Fourth, the name-strings for a species may not be forms of scientific names. Scientific names are presented in a latinized form, are compliant with the relevant code of nomenclature, or, if the codes do not apply to them (for example, because they are names of high ranking taxa), they are written in a comparable form consistent with the expectations of biologists. Scientific names may include annotations, authors, and dates of nomenclatural acts. Code-compliance typically addresses the names of families, genera, subgenera, species and subspecies. This definition of scientific names is not consistent with the use of the same term by GenBank (see \"Results\" below). Other classes of 'names' include common names, also referred to as vernacular or colloquial names, are part of living languages, such as French, Tagalog, or Latvian. Another class of 'names' are surrogates that may be strain numbers, acronyms, or other strings that take the place of a name. Finally, taxa may be distinguished using identifiers in the form of short molecular sequences or barcodes, or with data identifiers such as LSIDs or UUIDs. This classification is inexact as, illustrated below, some name-strings include scientific elements, or may be part common names, part acronym, or part surrogate (here and elsewhere, examples of name-strings from this exercise are presented in bold): Any name-string may be mis-spelled, distorted because of OCR errors, inadvertently concatenated, or have alternate spellings. Some examples of these problems are: arex appropinquata Schum. for Carex appropinguata; Troglodyted troglodyted for Troglodytes troglodytes; Verena mulinoides Speg. for Verbena mulinoides Spegazzini, 1902. Kummerovia striata and Kummerowia striata are alternative spellings in the same source; and corbulasulcata is a concatenation of Corbula sulcata. Another source of problems is the intrusion of non-code-compliant characters that can create additional name-strings due to encoding problems. To be compliant with nomenclatural codes, scientific names should -usually -use the English version of Latin. Yet, the following characters occur in name-strings that were presented as scientific names and are indexed by the Global Names Index.",

The Codes of Nomenclature seek to prevent homonyms by stipulating that when a name is used, it can never be used again for another taxon. However, given the number of species and the absence of comprehensive nomenclators, it is possible that one author inadvertently introduces as a new name one that has already been used. Dolium was introduced in 1990 for an unusual euglenid (Larsen and Patterson 1990 ), but had already been used for a mollusc (Lamarck 1801) . As different Codes of Nomenclature apply to different areas of life, the same name may be legitimately used for taxa of plants and of animals (Peranema is a name for a fern and for a flagellate). Up to 15% of generic names are homonyms (IRMNG homonyms, McNeill 1997) , but the number of species-level homonyms (e.g. Pieris japonica Shir\u00f4zu, 1952 -a butterfly, and Pieris japonica (Thunberg) D. Don ex G. Don -a flowering plant) is small (a few hundred) (IRMNG species homonyms). In the absence of agreement to use a unified code, transregnal homonyms will need to be disambiguated to avoid information on unrelated species being included among the results of a search using a homonymic name. Reference to authors, species names in the case of generic homonyms; and taxonomic or other context has the potential to achieve disambiguation.",

Approximately 2% of the acronym entries in GenBank are incorrectly classified scientific names (e.g. Aleiantus incertus Lebis, 1953). Many acronyms in GenBank are not classified as such, but occur elsewhere such as within 'scientific names' and 'type material'. In some cases, an acronym is associated with a scientific name (see below). Many acronyms end with a 'V' and refer to viruses (RTBV refers to 'rice tungro bacilliform virus'), and are reclassified by us as viruses. Some virus acronyms are classified by GenBank as scientific names. Name-strings classified as acronyms occasionally identify a source and the acronym appears unique to that source such that the acronym may be dereferenceable to a taxonomic entity, even if it is not conventionally named.

It is indicative that the data provider knew what taxon was being referred to with an abbreviated or genus-free name; but that clearly presents problems for re-use of data by others. A class of about 750 unique name-strings in GenBank do not include reference to a taxon, or if they do, the taxon in question is negated. Typical annotations that negate a name are 'not', 'non' and 'nec'; others include 'cf.', 'nr.' (which indicate the taxon that was studied is similar to but not the same as the one mentioned), 'aff' is a firmer indication that indicates that the taxon studied is NOT the one that is referred to. 'Ab.' is a taxonomic judgement that the taxon in question is merely a variant (aberration) rather than a taxon in its own right. 'Scientific names' that are negated with annotations present problems to canonicalization and parsing. Streptostele cf. elgonensis 'Nabugabo' was matched to Streptostele elgonensis. Certainly some of these issues can be addressed by improved business logic, and in many cases the identity of an including taxon can be confirmed even if the target species is not -Campylobacter jejuni-like bacterium tells us the taxon is a Campylobacter. 6e. Environmental. Five thousand or so name-strings refer to a location, habitat, or material that was sampled, rather than to organisms. They contain no information that would lead to one or more terminal taxa. We did not assign to this class those name-strings that refer to a taxon that was encountered from a sample of the natural world (environment) -such as angiosperm environmental sample, Acanthamoeba environmental sample, or Thaumatomastigidae environmental sample. 6i. Acronyms are commonly used as or within name-strings. Some of the acronymcontaining name-strings contain taxonomic information, but over 72,000 unique namestrings from GenBank lack such information. As with name-strings with strain identifiers, some include reference to a recognizable data-source (below, ATCC) and we presume they can be linked to additional data through that unique source:strain identifier.

Candidatus. The rules of nomenclature for bacteria are challenging and require, among other things, the availability of a culture of the taxon in question. Much of the natural richness has never been cultured (Stewart 2012 , Tandogan et al. 2014 , and presents an excessive cost in time to achieve. Consequently, conventions have appeared to allow names to be presented even when they are not fully compliant with the relevant code. One solution is to refer to the taxon as 'candidatus' (Murray and Stackebrandt 1995) ; another is to use inverted commas to indicate the name is not yet code-compliant: 6. Chresonyms are formed when scientific names are coupled with the names and dates of authors who are not the authors of the basionym nor combination but who referred to the organism (Smith and Smith 1972). That is, the name-string does not deal with a nomenclatural act and is not code-compliant. Rather, these 'name+author' combinations indicate a usage of a name or a concept for a name. Other inappropriate name+author combinations (here referred to as apparent chresonyms) arise if a name element (such as subspecies) are excluded but the author of the element is retained. We refer to these as apparent chresonyms. In some taxonomic areas, chresonyms are incorrectly included within synonymy lists. Of almost 1,400,000 matches between GenBank and Catalogue of Life, 98,000 involved matches to two or more names in Catalogue of Life, involving 43,000 unique name-strings. These result from matches to homonyms, chresonyms or apparent chresonyms. Chresonyms present disambiguation problems and, if not attended to, give an inflated impression of the number of species in a list. As an example, the species name Naja haje, the Egyptian cobra, described as Coluber haje by Linnaeus, matched to: The Catalogue of Life refers to these name-strings as synonyms, which they are not. Naja haje annulifera, Naja haje anchietae, and Naja haje arabica Scortecci 1932 also match to the same bundle of name-strings because those subspecies, not included in the Catalogue of Life, are matched based on the canonical species versions of the namestrings.",

The integration of the identifiers as surrogates within a names-based infrastructure is achieved through algorithmic analysis of similarities to create bundles of identifiers that may correspond with species (BINs, Ratnasingham and Hebert 2013) , and with the inferred phylogenetic (=taxonomic) location within a global classification scheme being achieved through analyses of molecular similarities (Hinchliff et al. 2015) . Hinchcliff and colleagues provide a very extensive tree (dendrogram) that includes mostly the entities for which we have molecular data. In it, a large number of the 'tips' are not named species, but are entities labelled with molecular identifiers. It is unlikely that many such entities will be resolved to named species. This is most evident with prokaryotes. Given the exacting standards for code-compliance (i.e. availability in culture), a growing number of entities will either not be given any name, or will have interim names identified as such with the term 'candidatus' or other marker. It is urgent that molecular identifiers and names are managed together as alternative tokens for taxa, a point addressed for fungi by Schoch et al. (2014) and for bacteria by Federhen and colleagues (Federhen 2014 , Federhen et al. 2016 . In order to connect content attached to names to content associated with molecular identifiers, the integration process should include the mapping of molecular identifiers to species.

The concatenations were addressed by pre-processing with regular expressions -with a dramatic improvement in cross-matching to other sources ( Table 3 ). The library of expressions needs to be continuously improved as each new problem is identified. Other solutions include translation tables but such tables need to be included within reconciliation services of a names-based infrastructure. In addition to idiosyncrasies, about 400 name-strings relating to scientific names in DRYAD lacked the genus name (S hangoei and virescens). About one name-string in 20 in both GenBank and DRYAD contained no taxonomically useful information. As for the future, we see no benefits from the continued use of idiosyncratic versions of name-strings. Manual curation is tedious. Both can be addressed using open on-line name validation tools as part of future-proofing practices (see below).",

Most tools establish the existence of similar or different concepts on the basis of the taxonomic tree-path (parents), sister taxa, and subordinate taxa. The approach is sensitive to taxonomic completeness and conventions of sources under comparison. The use of concepts draws attention to finer granularity than can be achieved with names on their own. But, as different concepts with the same name overlap, the unambiguous definition of concepts by reference to defining characteristics will be needed if they are to be used in organizing biodiversity information. Yet, the characteristics that allow overlapping concepts to be distinguished are not codified in a standard way, are rarely specified, and, if accessible, can only be established with examination of taxonomic texts. As concepts are little used and cannot be readily identified, we do not regard the practical challenges of managing concepts as currently tractable on a large scale, and so do not regard this area as ready for inclusion in a cyber-infrastructure.",

At one end of the spectrum are instances in which all characters in a source name-string referring to a terminal taxon match a string in a target. Such matches may be the best, but could also be misleading. The increasing redistribution of digital names lists without any critical oversight may lead to matches among sources that have not verified the validity of the names. As an example, some recognize that the Global Names Index is not a source for taxonomically endorsed names, but others (e.g. http://marine.lifewatch.eu/belgian-lifewatch-e-lab) do treat it as a taxonomic database. Perfect matches may then be formed with other instances of the same mis-spelled name-strings or with chresonyms. Cross-checks against multiple taxonomically endorsed data sources or annotation (see below) are desirable to eliminate such matches. The next level of performance is a perfect match of the canonical versions of the terminal taxa. There is a small level of risk of homonyms (such as the examples of Asterina gibbosa and Baileya australis given above). Most homonyms have been listed in the IRMNG compilation and so can be converted into a reference vocabulary that the cross mapper can call upon to alert users to the possibility of a homonym. Less precise matching, from rank of genus and above is not useful if the agenda is to use names to interconnect data.

Annotations, once made, will be then compiled centrally, can accompany the data object, be made visible to the data source or supplier of the digital object, and may or may not automatically update the digital object.

Clearly, there is a need to further refine the matching logic, although the same benefits would arise if taxonomic compilations excluded name-strings that are not code-compliant:The use of canonicals often produce ambiguous or misleading results with chresonyms, homonyms, concepts, and subtaxa.The following two examples are of positive matches of single canonicalized name-strings of species to homonyms. \u2022 Asterina gibbosa (Pennant, 1777) matched to Asterina gibbosa Gaillard 1897 (a fungus), and to Asterina gibbosa (Pennant, 1777) (an echinoderm) and \u2022 Baileya australis (Grote, 1881) matched Baileya australis Rydb.

Such uses do not comply with codes of nomenclature, and so should not be included in synonymy lists. With the use of canonical versions of name-strings, chresonyms inflate the perceived matching of lists. Apparent chresonyms are instances of taxon+author combindations that do not refer to nomenclatural acts, and may, for example, because if subspecific taxa are excluded while the authors for those taxa are retained. As noted above, a junior synonym for the snake eyed skink from Mauritius, Ablepharus boutonii africanus, matched 15 variants of Ablepharus boutonii. 43,000 unique name-strings matched two or more names in Catalogue of Life. Some of these matches will result from canonical matching of species and subspecies, from errors in data entry, and there are a small number of instances of homonyms which match if canonical forms of names are used. Chresonyms have the potential of confusing reconciliation -as in examples where one name in Catalogue of Life is given as a synonym of two different species (Lacerta caucasica Engelmann Et Al., 1993 is indicated as a synonym of Darevskia alpina",
