Data from these surveillance systems showed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 circulated in West Africa later than in other regions of the continent. Methods: We contacted 11 West African countries to collect information about their influenza surveillance systems (number of sites, type of surveillance, sampling strategy, populations sampled, case definitions used, number of specimens collected and number of specimens positive for influenza viruses) for the time period January 2010 through December 2012. Results: Of the 11 countries contacted, 8 responded: Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo. Countries used standard World Health Organization (WHO) case definitions for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) or slight variations thereof. There were 70 surveillance sites: 26 SARI and 44 ILI. Seven countries conducted SARI surveillance and collected 3114 specimens of which 209 (7%) were positive for influenza viruses. Among influenza-positive SARI patients, 132 (63%) were influenza A [68 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 64 influenza A(H3N2)] and 77 (37%) were influenza B. All eight countries conducted ILI surveillance and collected 20,375 specimens, of which 2278 (11%) were positive for influenza viruses. Among influenza-positive ILI patients, 1431 (63%) were influenza A [820 influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, 611 influenza A(H3N2)] and 847 (37%) were influenza B. A majority of SARI and ILI case-patients who tested positive for influenza (72% SARI and 59% ILI) were children aged 0-4 years, as were a majority of those enrolled in surveillance. The seasonality of influenza and the predominant influenza type or subtype varied by country and year. Conclusions: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 continued to circulate in West Africa along with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B during 2010-2012. Although ILI surveillance systems produced a robust number of samples during the study period, more could be done to strengthen surveillance among hospitalized SARI case-patients. Surveillance systems captured young children but lacked data on adults and the elderly. More data on risk groups for severe influenza in West Africa are needed to help shape influenza prevention and clinical management policies and guidelines.",

            "text": "While useful information has been obtained from influenza surveillance in West Africa, this analysis demonstrates some key weaknesses in influenza surveillance during this time period. There were relatively few samples collected from hospitalized patients with SARI. With few data on hospitalized cases it is difficult to determine risk factors for severe influenza disease, which would help with prioritization of seasonal and pandemic vaccine. Half (4/8) of the countries collected none or less than 50 SARI samples during the 3-year study period. Establishing SARI surveillance has proven to be quite challenging in tertiary hospitals and secondary hospitals as these medical facilities are generally quite understaffed. Medical staffs struggling to provide basic services rarely collect specimens for surveillance purposes. Given budgetary and human resource constraints, having dedicated staff that would focus only or primarily on SARI surveillance and collection of outcome and denominator data may be unrealistic in these facilities without alternative means of support. Integration with other disease surveillance programs is possible, but would require further consideration given the need for laboratory confirmation and stringent handling requirements for virologic specimens. Additionally, data collected on adults and the elderly are quite limited. During the study period, 80% of ILI and 74% of SARI samples were collected from children aged 0-14 years. Children aged 0-14 years are approximately 43% of the total population of West Africa, given the higher rates of influenza-associated illness seen in children it is not unexpected that they would be a majority of SARI and ILI case-patients [22, 23] ; however, without systematic data collection it is difficult to assess these potential biases in enrollment. Collection of data on ages of all respiratory admissions could improve the understanding of potential biases in existing surveillance. In addition, the few number of elderly enrolled through facility-based surveillance suggest the need to identify surveillance sites that primarily serve adults or the use of community-based surveillance in some settings in order to improve representativeness. Collection of data on other risk factors for severe disease and outcomes of hospitalization (e.g. death, discharge) would also be useful to inform policy decisions. Furthermore, data were collected from health facility-based sentinel surveillance. Persons aged 60 and older are less likely to seek care at health facilities in many parts of Africa which may limit the utility of health facility-based surveillance for monitoring severe disease in this age group [24, 25] .",

While most countries detected influenza virus circulation throughout the year, there appear to be two seasonal peaks in influenza virus circulation in January-March and August-November. Data from Eastern Africa, primarily Kenya and Uganda, show that influenza circulates throughout the year; however, seasonal peaks mostly correspond with East African rainy seasons and the Southern Hemisphere winter [26] [27] [28] as opposed to the Western African harmattan and rainy seasons. In Southern Africa, influenza seasonality corresponds to the typical Southern Hemisphere winter months of June to August [29] . In addition to defining seasonality, ongoing influenza surveillance in West Africa has also provided reassurance that recent outbreaks of avian influenza A(H5N1) in poultry and wild birds have not resulted in substantial numbers of human cases. There were several limitations to this study. First, we assessed just 3 years of surveillance. As influenza transmission varies greatly from year to year, 3 years of data are insufficient to understand nuances of transmission dynamics in the countries we included. Also, not all countries conducted surveillance during the entire time period, which limits interpretation of the percentage positive and may account for the broad range of percent positive by country. Likewise, the individual countries have different climates/\u03bc-climates (coastal, tropical, arid, etc.) that may impact influenza virus circulation. Different case definitions and different sampling methods may have further contributed to the wide range of percent influenza positive by country. Selection bias may have also contributed to the wide range of percent influenza positive by country if clinicians chose to enroll casepatients they suspected of having influenza or to exclude those they thought had a different condition instead of enrolling systematically based upon case definitions. Data on population denominators for surveillance would also help estimate the burden of disease and further inform policy decisions around influenza prevention and control.",

            "text": "Influenza surveillance rapidly expanded during 2010-2012 in West Africa. Despite the improvements observed, there is a need to strengthen SARI surveillance and to collect more epidemiological data about outcomes of hospitalization, risk factors for influenza-associated hospitalization, and population denominators. These data will help to better understand influenza-associated disease and economic burden in West Africa. Alternative approaches to health facility-based surveillance may be required to identify influenza disease burden in groups with poor access to health facilities. Identifying risk groups and describing the timing of influenza virus circulation will help shape influenza vaccination policies for seasonal and pandemic preparedness.",

Among 20,375 ILI casepatients, the majority were children aged 0-4 years (14,775, 72.5%) and 5-14 years (1650, 8.1%). Older children and adults aged 15-64 years (3665, 18.0%) and adults aged 65 years and older (135, 0.7%) represented less than one-fifth of all enrolled participants. Information on age was missing for 150 (0.7%) tested ILI cases. Among 3114 SARI case-patients, 2100 (67.4%) were children aged 0-4 years, 216 (6.9%) children aged 5-14 years, 471 (15.1%) older children and adults aged 15-64 years and 47 (1.5%) adults aged 65 years and older. Age was missing for 280 (9.1%) tested SARI cases. Excluding those with missing age, the distribution of ILI and SARI cases among these age groups was significantly different (p < 0.001), with those enrolled in SARI more likely to be children aged 0-4 years and adults aged 65 years and older.Among the 23,489 samples collected, 9577 (40.8%) were from males, 8807 (37.5%) were from females, and gender was not reported for 5105 (21.7%) case-patients. Of the 20,375 ILI samples, 7977 (39.2%) and 7513 (36.9%) were collected from males and females, respectively. Of the 3114 SARI samples, 1600 (51.4%) and 1294 (41.6%) were collected from males and females respectively. For SARI cases, length of hospitalization and outcome of hospitalization were not reported.Influenza prevalence among ILI and SARI casesOverall 2278 (11.2%) of 20,375 ILI case-patients tested positive for influenza, ranging from 29.2% in Cote d'Ivoire to 4.2% in Mali. Among the countries that also conducted SARI surveillance, 209 (6.7%) of 3114 SARI case-patients tested positive for influenza, ranging from 31.6% in Togo to 4.7% in Niger. A majority of ILI casepatients testing positive for influenza viruses were children aged 0-4 years (1333, 58.5%) and 5-14 years (293, 12.9%). The remaining ILI positive samples were collected from patients aged 15-64 years (611, 26.8%) and patients aged 65 years and older (13, 0.6%).
