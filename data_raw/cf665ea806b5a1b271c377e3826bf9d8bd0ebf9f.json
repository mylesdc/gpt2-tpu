Previous studies on enveloped viruses have shown that many incorporated cellular proteins associated with the virion's membranes that might play important roles in viral infectivity. In this study, we sought to proteomically profile the cellular proteins incorporated into or associated with the virions of a highly virulent PRRSV strain GDBY1, and to provide foundation for further investigations on the roles of incorporated/associated cellular proteins on PRRSV's infectivity. Results: In our experiment, sixty one cellular proteins were identified in highly purified PRRSV virions by twodimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometric approaches. The identified cellular proteins could be grouped into eight functional categories including cytoskeletal proteins, chaperones, macromolecular biosynthesis proteins, metabolism-associated proteins, calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins and other functional proteins. Among the identified proteins, four have not yet been reported in other studied envelope viruses, namely, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase, peroxiredoxin 1 and galectin-1 protein. The presence of five selected cellular proteins (i.e., \u03b2-actin, Tubulin, Annexin A2, heat shock protein Hsp27, and calcium binding proteins S100) in the highly purified PRRSV virions was validated by Western blot and immunogold labeling assays.",

For ultracentrifugation, the virion pellets were resuspended in TNE buffer and layered on the top of 10 to 50% CsCl gradient. There was a single faint opalescent band at 20-30% gradients. Subsequently, the opalescent PRRSV particles band was harvested and loaded onto 25-65% sucrose gradients. The higher density particles band in 35-45% soucrose gradient was collected and purified for a second time according to the same PRRSV purification method. The purity of virus preparation was directly examined by transmission electron microscopy following negative staining (Fig. 1 ). The PRRSV samples contained an abundance of virion particles without obvious contamination from host cellular material. For further identification of the virions protein composition, the purified virions were first separated by SDS-PAGE and then stained with Coomassie blue, three bright lanes (nucleocapsid protein N, membrane protein M and glycoprotein GP5) and three faint lanes (GP2a, GP3 and GP4) were found (Fig. 1 ). Some visible fainter bands that might represent cellular proteins incorporated into the virions were also observed. Taken together, the highly purified PRRSV particles were obtained.",

In this study, the critical challenge was to prove that the host proteins were really an integral part of the virions and are not just non-specifically attached to the outside of the virions or derived from the contaminants. To address this question, the negative control of non-PRRSV infected Marc-145 cells lysates were purified using the same method as described earlier for PRRSV virions. Equal amounts of purified PRRS virions, protease-treated PRRSV virions purified Marc-145 cell lysates were included for Western blot analysis.

In addition, we detected no Annexin A2, S100 and Hsp27 in the negative control. Otherwise, it is an expectable result that we detected actin and tubulin in the non-viral infected MARC-145 cells lysate which might because of their high concentrations in all cells and subcellular fractions.

However, the underlying mechanism of PRRSV pathogenesis remains to be well defined. In this study, we obtained highly purified PRRSV virions by CsCl gradients combined with sucrose gradients ultracentrifugation. Virion-associated proteins were identified by using 2-DE/MS proteomics approach followed by Western blot and electron microscopy. A total of six viral proteins and sixty one host proteins were successfully identified. Number of evidences show that some of virion-associated host proteins may play an important role in virus infectivity [31, 32] . However, the relevance of cellular proteins to viral biology remains to be elucidated. This study provides strong evidence that cellular proteins are incorporated into enveloped viruses. Three of structural proteins GP2a (pI 10.0), N (pI 10.4) and M (pI 9.99) all belong to alkaline proteins, therefore none of them could be detected by utilizing 2-DE gels. Several glycosylation sites have been identified on GP5 protein, which may change GP5 pI. Meanwhile, GP3 and GP4 which belong to non-major structural proteins were not identified on the 2-DE gels, which can be due to low concentration. Moreover, the two proteins (GP3 and GP4) which are involved in posttranslational modification of glycosylation, and can change the proteins pI were not detected in 2-D gels. Our viral proteomics study of PRRSV virons identified several host cytoskeleton system proteins, which have the maximum profusion among the identified cellular proteins, including Actin, Keratin, Annexin, Coronin, Tubulin, Tropomyosin, and Cofilin. Enveloped viruses acquire their envelope through budding from the host cell, thus cytoskeletal proteins may be integrated inside the virions because of their propinquity to viral assembly and budding sites.",

The functional implication for assimilation of actin into these virus particles remains ambiguous. Actin has been suggested to play a role in the transport of synthetic viral RNA, which is presumably a prerequisite for budding [35] . In number of viruses, such as HIV and moloney murine leukemia virus actins are used to be very important during their budding [36] [37] [38] . Furthermore, actin and myosin form a dipolymer which play an important role in HIV 1 budding from host [39] . For influenza virus, actin plays indispensable roles during the endocytosis of the virus into polarized epithelia [40] . Beta-actin has been identified to interact with infectious bronchitis virus membrane protein and may play an important role in virion assembly and budding [29] . Keratin network is important for the intercellular transmission of persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection and facilitates its own intercellular spread through the interaction between the viral nucleoprotein, keratin 1 and stimulation of cell-cell contacts [41] . Cytoskeletal filaments vimentin, cytokeratin 8, cytokeratin 18, actin, hair type II basic keratin and PRRSV receptor mediate the transportation of the virus in the cytosol [42] .

Annexin A2 is a calcium-regulated membranebinding protein whose affinity for calcium is greatly enhanced by anionic phospholipids and implicated in a number of membrane-related events, including regulated exocytosis [43] . It binds calcium ions and may be involved in heat-stress response. Cellular annexin A2 was found to be endogenously associated with HCMV, HIV, influenza virus particles, and herpes simplex virus 1 [18, 20, 44, 45] . HCMV-associated annexin A2 contributes to cell penetration by the virus, and is acquired during virus egress from infected cells and is bound to anionic phospholipids expressed on the virus surface, which may contribute to membrane binding and fusion events required for virus entry [44] . Annexin A2 as a cellular cofactor interactes with phosphatidylserine that eventually promotes HIV entry into MDM [46] . It is also demonstrated that annexin A2 interacts with HIV Gag at the phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate-containing lipid raft membrane domains, at which Gag mediates viral proper assembly in monocyte-derived macrophages, moreover ectopic expression of Annexin A2 in 293T cells increases HIV-1 production [47, 48] .",

Hsp27 was also reported in HIV and influenza virus [20, 52] , which was identified as a protein that specifically co-immunoprecipitates with HCV non-structural protein 5A and may be involved in HCV replication [53] . Hsp27 phosphorylation has been linked to an inhibition of NF-B activation, suggesting that Hsp27 plays a role in HIV-1 infection of macrophages [54] . Moreover Hsp27 was observed to be up-regulated in PRRSVinfected PAMs [55] . Furthermore, Hsp90 complex which is incorporated into nucleocapsids are required for Hepadnavirus assembly and reverse transcription [56] . Purified primate lentiviral virions contain Hsp70 [52] . Some stress proteins, such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 are components for purified EBV virions and may regulate actin filament formation [28] . A proteomic analysis performed on highly purified HCV virions identified the heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) as a part of the viral particles demonstrating that HSC70 modulates HCV infectivity and lipid droplet-dependent virus release [57] .",
