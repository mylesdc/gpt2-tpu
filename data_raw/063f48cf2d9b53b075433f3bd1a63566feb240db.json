However, spatial information such as the spatial distribution, autocorrelation and risk factors of the disease is of great help in studying patients with hepatitis B. This study examined 2851 cases of hepatitis B that were hospitalized in Shenzhen in 2010 and studied the spatial distribution, risk factors and spatial access to health services using spatial interpolation, Pearson correlation analysis and the improved two-step floating catchment area method. The results showed that the spatial distribution of hepatitis B, along with risk factors as well as spatial access to the regional medical resources, was uneven and mainly concentrated in the south and southwest of Shenzhen in 2010. In addition, the distribution characteristics of hepatitis B revealed a positive correlation between four types of service establishments and risk factors for the disease. The Pearson correlation coefficients are 0.566, 0.515, 0.626, 0.538 corresponding to bath centres, beauty OPEN ACCESS salons, massage parlours and pedicure parlours (p < 0.05). Additionally, the allocation of medical resources for hepatitis B is adequate, as most patients could be treated at nearby hospitals.",

HBV is also an important public health issue in China [2], as national surveys conducted since the 1970s have repeatedly showed high morbidity from HBV infections in the general population [3, 4] . To address this challenge, many scholars now to study the disease using different approaches (e.g., pathology, immunology and epidemiology), but none of these approaches incorporate spatial information [5] . With the development of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and its applications in epidemiology [6], it has become clear the spatial information has great value in Epidemiology. Spatial epidemiology is a branch of epidemiology that uses spatial information to extend the analysis of disease distribution and risk factors. This information serves as a powerful analytical tool for epidemiological studies and will likely show greater significance in the future [7]. Our team have done some works on spatial epidemiology [8-10].",

Spatial epidemiology also explores the decisive elements that can impact public health and provides strategies and measures for disease prevention and cure and health promotion and hygiene services [7, 11] . Research on this subject mainly utilizes four elements: disease mapping, risk assessment in relation to a point or line source, disease clustering analysis and geographical correlation studies [11] . Disease mapping is the most important tool in spatial epidemiology and is used to describe and evaluate disease area distribution [7]. The most typical example of disease mapping is the epidemiological investigation of a cholera outbreak caused by street water pollution in London in 1854 [12, 13] . The assessment of risk factors is similar to geographical correlation studies in that they both focus on studying cause of geographical phenomenon. Moreover, analysis of disease clustering uses statistical methods to identify disease spatial aggregation, thus providing corresponding methods to search for etiologic clues [7, 14, 15] .",

However, exploring the risk factors for disease is complex and difficult, especially for diseases in which it is difficult to obtain patient exposure information, and data involving patients' privacy [7] ; this challenge represents a weak link in epidemiological studies. Compared with other infectious diseases such as schistosomiasis [19, 20] , most respiratory system diseases [21] and cardiovascular diseases [8], the spatial risk factors for hepatitis B are less obvious, and there have been few studies on this aspect. In view of this problem, this study sought to explore the spatial risk factors for hepatitis B and to discover the relationship between these risk factors and hepatitis B morbidity.",

Spatial access to health services refers to overcoming spatial obstacles to medical facilities [22, 23] . Based on different application environments and requirements, many different research methods are used to measure spatial access. Among the numerous methods, the gravity model (also known as the potential model) and the two-step floating catchment area method are the most widely used [24, 25] . However, both methods have flaws; the gravity model is somewhat abstract and difficult to understand, and the two-step floating catchment area method ignores the spatial access differences in demand points within the same search scope and the spatial access values in demand points outside of the search scope [26] . It is also difficult to set a reasonable search radius for each medical facility [27] . This current study used an improved two-step floating catchment area model to overcome these limitations. In particular this model considers the effect of distance decay by setting weighted distance values, and this improved method is also an effective method for setting a reasonable search radius for each medical facility. These two changes significantly improve the accuracy of measuring spatial access to health services.",

Figure 5 shows the spatial distribution of hepatitis B morbidity; Figure 5 used no interpolation method, whereas Figure 5b used kriging interpolation. In general, the locations of high morbidity on both graphs were the same, and the highest morbidity was observed in the southwest of Shenzhen. Nantou and its vicinity exhibited the most hepatitis B infections, and Guangming, Pingdi, Shiyan, Pingshan, Lianhua, Donghu, Nan'ao, Shekou (S) and their respective vicinities represented the other high-morbidity areas in Shenzhen in 2010. Comparing these two graphs, Figure 5a shows a statistical map of grade, whereas Figure 5 shows a contour map that weakens the influence of administrative boundaries on the spatial distribution of hepatitis B morbidity. The population often flows constantly from one district to another, and thus the results shown in Figure 5 better reflect the reality. ",

Comparing with Figures 5a,b and Figure  6 , it is clear that there was a positive correlation between the hepatitis B morbidity distribution and the density distribution of the four types of service facilities. The correlation between these two factors could be measured accurately by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. Figure 6 . The spatial distribution density of the four types of service facilities. Table 4 shows the Pearson correlation coefficients calculated between each type of facility and the hepatitis B morbidity after performing a t-test (p < 0.05). In general, there was a positive correlation between these types of facilities and the hepatitis B morbidity, which suggests that these facilities have a positive effect on the spread of hepatitis B. Among the Pearson correlation coefficient results, the coefficient between massage parlours and hepatitis B morbidity was the largest of the four types of facilities, followed by bath centres, pedicure parlours and beauty salons. Interpretation of the Pearson correlation coefficients is shown in Table 1 . Because hepatitis B studies are related to the social sciences, the interpretation of coefficients in this table is considered to be reasonable and reliable. From the calculation results, each of the four types of service facilities showed a positive correlation with hepatitis B morbidity in Shenzhen in 2010. Although these four types of facilities to an extent can make people's life convenient and drive local economic development, they greatly increase the risk of hepatitis B infection. Because of factors such as the large number of HBVinfected individuals in China, the troubling health status in the service facilities and a lack of disease prevention awareness, these four types of service establishment can be easily regarded as dangerous sources of HBV infection. Distinguishing between spatial risk factors not only helps to analyze how they influence the spatial spread of epidemic diseases, but also contributes to establishing disease prevention and control measures.",

The spatial distribution of hepatitis B; the distribution of high-transmission-risk facilities such as bath centres, beauty salons, massage parlours and pedicure parlours and access to regional medical resources were uneven in Shenzhen in 2010, with a main concentration of such factors in the south and southwest, which correspond to the economic centre regions of Shenzhen. On the one hand, these distribution characteristics indicated that hepatitis B infection had a positive correlation with the four high-risk service facilities. On the other hand, the allocation and spatial distribution of medical resources for hepatitis B was adequate.",

In addition, the correlation between hepatitis B and high-risk locations was not very strong, and thus further studies are necessary to determine whether hepatitis B correlates with certain geographical or other elements in Shenzhen city. Furthermore, The method, the improved two-step floating catchment area model to evaluate the spatial access to medical resources must continuously be modified for more accurate evaluation results. These limitations will be studied further in the future.",
