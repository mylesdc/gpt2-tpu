            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) of bat origin have caused two pandemics in this century. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV both originated from bats, and it is highly likely that bat coronaviruses will cause future outbreaks. Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of these viruses in humans. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is currently the preferred methodology for virus discovery to ensure unbiased sequencing of bat CoVs, considering their high genetic diversity. However, unbiased NGS is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences due to the high background level of nonviral sequences present in surveillance field samples. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting most of the CoV species. Using this technology, we effectively reduced sequencing costs by increasing the sensitivity of detection. We discovered nine full genomes of bat CoVs in this study and revealed great genetic diversity for eight of them. IMPORTANCE Active surveillance is both urgent and essential to predict and mitigate the emergence of bat-origin CoV in humans and livestock. However, great genetic diversity increases the chance of homologous recombination among CoVs. Performing targeted PCR, a common practice for many surveillance studies, would not reflect this diversity. NGS, on the other hand, is an expensive methodology and is prone to missing low-abundance CoV sequences. Here, we employ a capture-based NGS approach using baits targeting all CoVs. Our work demonstrates that targeted, cost-effective, large-scale, genome-level surveillance of bat CoVs is now highly feasible. 2020.

            "text": "C oronaviruses (CoVs) have the largest nonsegmented genomes among all RNA viruses, reaching up to 30 kb in length. The large genomes enhance plasticity, thereby allowing modification by mutations and recombination, which in turn leads to greater genetic diversity and high chances of cross-species transmission (1, 2) . The major reason for this phenomenon may be the numerous subgenomic RNAs generated during viral replication, which increase the chance of homologous recombination among closely related genes from different lineages of CoVs or other viruses (3, 4) . As a result, CoV taxonomy is constantly changing. Currently, there are four genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus) consisting of 38 unique species in the CoV subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, and the number is still increasing (5) . Open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) is the gene used for classification, but viruses in the same species may show great diversity in regions outside ORF1b, confounding the designation (6) . Bat CoVs classed as the same species can differ significantly in terms of receptor usage or virus-host interaction, as observed in bat severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)related CoVs (SARSr-CoVs) (7) . This difference would not be reflected by performing targeted PCR on short genomic fragments of ORF1b, currently a common practice for many surveillance studies (8) .",

            "text": "Over the past 20 years, two pandemics, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), have been attributed to CoVs (9, 10) . The outbreak in 2018 of swine acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS), another bat CoV, is a timely reminder that CoVs will continue to emerge and cause new outbreaks in the future (11) . All three disease agents can be traced back to bats, animals known to harbor other deadly viruses, including Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus (12) . Bat CoVs are highly prevalent around the world and also show great genetic diversity, making up almost 60% of all known Alpha-and Betacoronavirus species. It is generally believed that some of these bat CoVs have the potential to spill over into humans and other mammalian species, causing another SARS-like pandemic (13) . While predicting the potential spillover and emergence of a novel bat coronavirus is difficult, active surveillance is a valuable monitoring mechanism. Surveillance programs have been designed to aid viral discovery in wildlife reservoir hosts to mitigate infection and emergence in the human population. These programs propose to use next-generation sequencing (NGS) and other approaches to ensure unbiased evolutionary analysis of bat CoVs that takes into consideration their high genetic diversity (14) . In order to be effective, these types of surveillance programs rely upon processing of samples in a high-throughput manner and require the compilation of whole-genome sequences. Although NGS enables unbiased pathogen discovery, implementation of this methodology for virus surveillance is costly. Additionally, the inherent lack of sensitivity with an unbiased approach increases the burden of data analysis and decreases the chance of detection in field samples with low viral loads.",

            "text": "Enrichment NGS aids in the detection and characterization of diverse CoVs. In surveillance studies, detection and characterization are fundamental requirements to fully assess the risk that bat CoVs pose to humans. We aimed to address two main issues encountered during surveillance studies. First, many samples are collected but not all samples harbor viruses. Second, when viruses are detected, the high genetic diversity of CoVs means that full-length genome sequencing is essential to fully characterize viruses. In the context of CoV discovery, it is not time or cost-effective to perform unbiased NGS on all samples. Most data generated from unbiased NGS can be attributed to non-CoV-specific reads. To assess whether samples can be enriched to allow sequencing of only CoV-specific reads, we utilized NGS in conjunction with viral nucleic acid capture specifically targeting most of the known CoVs using a pool of 4,303 unique baits (18) . These baits were designed from 90 representative CoV genomes, and in silico analysis determined that these baits should target all known CoV species tested here ( [MHV]) were amplified in cell culture, and RNA was extracted from the supernatants. Additionally, to test the robustness of the assay, RNA was extracted from 3 clinical samples (oral swabs from humans infected with human CoV OC43 [HCoV-OC43], HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63). NGS libraries were constructed and either directly sequenced or subjected to enrichment prior to sequencing. The 17 captured samples were made into two pools (8 or 9 per pool) for sequencing. The total amount of data obtained was variable across samples, but in swabs, unbiased NGS consistently produced more data (Fig. 1A ). Within these data sets, the ratios of viral reads to total number of reads increased by almost 100% for captured samples, in contrast to the ratios of less than 1% for most of the unbiased NGS (Fig. 1B) . The high ratio of viral to total reads in conjunction with decreased data size reduces the sequencing cost and data analysis burden. This methodology could thus greatly facilitate large-scale surveillance studies. Ratios of viral to total reads were determined by mapping reads to the respective reference genome using CLC genomics. (C) CoV Circos plots. RNA extracted from cell culture supernatant or human oral swabs was subjected to NGS analysis.

The efficiency of CoV enrichment NGS was closely related to the number of baits and cycle threshold (C T ) value ( Fig. 1C and Table S2 ). Read depth and genome coverage were compared between unbiased NGS and enrichment NGS. The read depth for SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), MERS-CoV, PEDV, and TGEV increased from 10-to 1,000-fold throughout the genome after enrichment. The increase in read depth can be partially attributed to the high viral titers in cultured samples. Sequencing of the full-length genome of green fluorescent protein-labeled MHV (MHV-GFP) was successful, although the read depth was lower than for unbiased NGS (Fig. 1C ). An increase in read depth of at least 10-fold was observed in HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 in regions where baits were present. Sequencing of the partial genome of HCoV-HKU1 was successful with enrichment NGS, but the full-length genome was obtained with unbiased NGS (Fig. 1C) .

The CoV enrichment NGS approach with our custom bait panel resulted in good performance in most of the samples tested, but the sequencing cost was dramatically reduced. In our study, the approximate per-sample cost of HiSeq NGS (2 Gb of data) was $100, while the cost of enrichment NGS in a 10-plex sample format was approximately $60, including the hybridization and bait costs (detailed in Table S3 in the supplemental material).

Enrichment NGS performed poorly on samples containing low viral titers. Minimal reads were obtained for the genomes of BtTyCoV-HKU4r and BtHpCoV-HKU10r, and both samples had small amounts of viral RNA (C T value of \u03fe30). The technical procedure of the capture is itself a limitation of enrichment NGS (15, 18) . Key steps in the hybridization protocol, such as washes, could result in the loss of viral nucleic acid. While this loss is tolerable when the viral titer is high, a low level of viral RNA may give a false-negative result. We observed this situation with BtHpCoV-HKU10r. This virus was only detected by unbiased NGS. Similar observations have been made in previous studies, where full-length genome sequencing of human herpesvirus 1, West Nile virus, and MERS-CoV was achieved only when high viral titers were present (15, 18) . We could improve the capture efficiency in two ways in the future: by using newly designed probes that bind better to their targets or by changing the steps that affect binding. For example, 65\u00b0C is the preferred temperature for Dynabeads, and thus, any step that affected the temperature would cause loss of yield. We can create a constant work condition for this step in future, or we can use different beads that require a less stringent environment. Above all, although unbiased NGS is a better choice for these samples, large-scale bat surveillance would benefit from the reduced cost of targeted enrichment. We suggest that direct NGS and gap-filling PCR are good complements to enrichment NGS once a positive sample has been identified.",

Genome recombination has been documented for human CoVs, including OC43, NL63, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (2, 4) . It has also been suggested that recombination between the bat SARSr-CoV strains WIV16 and Rf1-related generated a new strain, SARSr-Civet CoV SZ3, with a breakpoint at the NSP16/spike and S2 gene region (7) . Breakpoints at the NSP16/spike and S2 gene region and nucleoprotein/accessory protein gene region can be found in most of the bat CoV species analyzed, suggesting that recombination is rather common. Recombination in spike or accessory proteins may generate a new virus capable of infecting via a different receptor or lead to different virus-host interactions. Genome diversity has not been assessed for CoV species like BtRhCoV-HKU2r since they were first discovered (13, 21) . We should be alert and vigilant with the knowledge that bat CoVs are likely to cause another disease outbreak, not only because of their prevalence but also because the high frequency of recombination between viruses may lead to the generation of viruses with changes in virulence. BtMiCoV-HKU8r is probably a new recombinant virus that may use a different receptor than the reference virus, considering the low similarity in their spike genes. And yet, we know very little about the functionality of their accessary proteins or the biological significance of this diversity. We previously provided serological evidence that HKU8r-CoV had jumped over from bats to camels and recombined with MERS-CoV, alerting other researchers that the CoV species could be dangerous (22) . Therefore, analysis of the short RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region, used in most CoV surveillance studies, is not sufficient and genomelevel comparison is needed to monitor the risk of alterations in species tropism and pathogenesis.",

All genomes were interrogated for ORFs using ORFfinder (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/). The search parameters were set to ignore nested ORFs and filter out ORFs of less than 150 bp. The standard genetic code and the \"ATG only\" rule were selected. Each ORF was identified and annotated through BLASTN and BLASTX using the NCBI database. Read mapping or PCR resequencing was used to verify novel ORFs. Read depth was assessed by mapping reads from direct or enriched NGS to their respective genomes using CLC Genomics Workbench version 12.0 (Qiagen). Bait positions were calculated by aligning baits to each genome by BLASTN. The ratio of viral reads to total reads was calculated for each sample. The ORF1b sequences of 38 ICTV reference genomes and 17 CoV genomes from this study were aligned by ClustalW (version 2.1). The phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining method in the maximum-composite-likelihood model in MEGA (version 7.0.18) with nucleotide substitution type and 1,000 bootstrap iterations.
