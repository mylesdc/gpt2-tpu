B. pertussis and RSV were detected from nasopharyngeal washes with Real Time-PCR. Results: Infants with pertussis were less often breastfeed than infants with RSV bronchiolitis (63.2% vs 89.5%; p <0.06). Clinically, significantly fewer infants with pertussis than controls had more episodes of whooping cough (63.2% vs 0.0%; p < 0.001) and also less frequently fever at admission (15.8% vs 68.4%; p <0.01), apnea (52.6% vs 10.5%; p <0.006), and cyanosis (52.6% vs 10.5%; p < 0.006). Infants with pertussis had more often no abnormal chest sounds on auscultation than infants with RSV bronchiolitis (0% vs 42,1%; p < 0.005). The absolute blood lymphocyte and eosinophil counts were higher in infants with B. pertussis than in controls with bronchiolitis (23886 \u00b1 16945 vs 10725 \u00b1 4126 cells/mm 3 , p < 0.0001 and 13.653 \u00b1 10.430 vs 4.730 \u00b1 2.400 cells/mm 3 , p < 0.001). The molecular analysis of 2 B. pertussis isolates for ptxA1, ptxP3, and prn2 genes showed the presence of gene variants. Conclusions: When infants are hospitalized for acute respiratory symptoms, physicians should suspect a pertussis infection, seek for specific clinical symptoms, investigate lymphocyte and eosinophil counts and thus diagnose infection early enough to allow treatment.",

Despite a widespread vaccination program, over the past fifteen years was seen a return of pertussis worldwide [1] . Pertussis resurgence in Europe has been attributed to an incomplete immunization program or to genetic changes in Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis). [2] The currently used acellular pertussis vaccine contains the pertactin gene variant prn1 and the pertussis toxin-B S1 subunit [3, 4] . Molecular changes in these two genes over the past years suggest that the antigenic divergence may make pertussis vaccination less effective than before [5, 6] .",

Hence, some infants remain unimmunized or incompletely immunized. In those who are incompletely immunized pertussis may develop in an atypical clinical form and be difficult to diagnose. Pertussis can be especially difficult to diagnose in children under 1 year of age during winter season, when other pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), circulate. In these difficult cases, pertussis acute respiratory symptoms can overlap with those of bronchiolitis. A study conducted in a group of infants hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis showed that almost 2% of the patients were co-infected with B. pertussis [7, 8] . Since B. pertussis-RSV co-infection is infrequent in young infants, physicians should keep the possibility of co-infections in mind as to diagnose it early and prevent bronchiolitis from becoming more severe [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

Another important finding in this study is that the B. pertussis strains circulating in our Pediatric Emergency Department seem to differ genetically from those currently used in DTaP vaccines. Of the 38 hospitalized infants enrolled in our study, five with pertussis and four with bronchiolitis had already been vaccinated. In Italy, vaccination schedule provides a first pertussis vaccine dose at the age of 3 months, and the booster doses at 5 and 12 months of age. This finding confirms previous reports, showing that many children with pertussis have never been vaccinated against pertussis, and that the first dose (or the first two doses) often provides scarce protection [14, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . When we analyzed our patients' demographic data, in line with others we found that children with whooping cough were breastfed less frequently than those with bronchiolitis [26, 27] . These results prevent us from conjecturing whether breast feeding might protect against the risk of B. pertussis infection in the first year of life and call for other studies to assess this important question [27] .",

            "text": "In two pertussis isolates, we undertook genetic molecular analysis to investigate gene variation in the pertussis toxin gene (ptx), in particular its S1 subunit (ptxA), the pertussis toxin gene promoter (ptx-P), and prn [4] [5] [6] . The \"universal\" indicator for characterizing the molecular features of B. pertussis is the catalytic subunit S1. Four S1 subunit variants have been described: S1-A (ptxA1), S1-B (ptxA2), S1-D (ptxA3), and S1-E (ptxA4) [2, 4, 6, 16, 18, 19] . Culture and molecular data allowed us to identify strains that express the S1-A variant, whereas pertussis vaccine contains the S1-B variant [4] . Pertactin gene polymorphisms reside in regions called R1 and R2. As many as eleven different prn alleles have been identified [5, 6] . Acellular pertussis vaccine contains the prn-1 allele. In the two infants whose aspirates were suitable for molecular genetic analysis, RT-PCR identified the prn-2 gene, also found in infants from other European countries (France and Finland) [5, 6] and in Japan [4] . We also found in both strains the ptx-P3 variant of the pertussis toxin promoter. This variant allows bacteria to increase toxin production so that more severe clinical signs and symptoms manifest [3] . Unfortunately, we were able to analyze B. pertussis strains in only two infants because cultures were negative in 16 infants with PCR confirmed pertussis who were already receiving specific antibiotic therapy when specimens were collected, or because technical problems arose during sample collection.",

Neither infant had been vaccinated against pertussis nor had they received macrolides antibiotic treatment at the time we collected their nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens. Equally important, the isolates contained the variant ptx-P3, known as high-producing pertussis toxin [31] , a variant that results in increased virulence and immune suppression. For this reason, we cannot exclude the possibility that both infants might have manifested the disease even if they had been vaccinated, because the vaccine-induced immunity would not have immunized them against the particular strain isolated.",
