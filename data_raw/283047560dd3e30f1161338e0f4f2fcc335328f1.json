Cats infected with Mhf that clear bacteremia are protected from Mhf reinfection, but the mechanisms of protective immunity are unresolved. In the present study we investigated whether the passive transfer of antibodies from Mhf-recovered cats to na\u00efve recipient cats provided protection against bacteremia and clinical disease following homologous challenge with Mhf; moreover, we characterized the immune response in the recipient cats. Ten specified pathogen-free (SPF) cats were transfused with pooled plasma from cats that had cleared Mhf bacteremia; five control cats received plasma from na\u00efve SPF cats. After homologous challenge with Mhf, cats were monitored for 100 days using quantitative PCR, hematology, blood biochemistry, Coombs testing, flow cytometry, DnaK ELISA, and red blood cell (RBC) osmotic fragility (OF) measurement. Passively immunized cats were not protected against Mhf infection but, compared to control cats, showed significantly higher RBC OF and B lymphocyte (CD45R/B220 + ) counts and occasionally higher lymphocyte, monocyte and activated CD4 + T lymphocyte (CD4 + CD25 + ) counts; they also showed higher bilirubin, total protein and globulin levels compared to those of control cats. At times of peak bacteremia, a decrease in eosinophils and lymphocytes, as well as subsets thereof (B lymphocytes and CD5 + , CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes), and an increase in monocytes were particularly significant in the passively immunized cats. In conclusion, passive immunization does not prevent bacteremia and clinical disease following homologous challenge with Mhf, but enhances RBC osmotic fragility and induces a pronounced immune response.",

            "text": "The natural route of hemoplasma transmission between cats is still unresolved, but aggressive interactions and blood-sucking arthropods have mainly been implicated [17] [18] [19] . For experimental transmission, the intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous inoculation of hemoplasma-containing blood has been successful [10, [19] [20] [21] . Recently, a low-dose infection model for Mhf that aimed to more accurately mirror the natural transmission of hemoplasmas was developed [22] . Different antibiotic regimens reduce hemoplasma blood loads and alleviate clinical signs but, so far, no treatment protocol has successfully and consistently cleared feline hemoplasma infections [21, [23] [24] [25] [26] . This limitation emphasizes the need to further investigate protective immune mechanisms against these agents. Recently, cats that were experimentally infected with Mhf or CMt and overcame bacteremia were shown to be protected from reinfection with the same hemoplasma species [27, 28] . A study by Novacco et al. [27] suggested a significant role for the humoral immune response in protecting against CMt reinfection: nine out of the ten cats that were protected from reinfection showed intermediate to high antibody levels against CMt before challenge. Furthermore, a transient decrease in antibody levels was observed in the protected cats immediately after attempted reinfection, which could be due to the binding of antibodies to the inoculated antigens. In the early phase after re-challenge, compared with the control group, the protected cats exhibited significantly higher IL-4/IL-12 ratios and CD4 + T lymphocyte counts and a pronounced eosinophilia. Therefore, the authors concluded that an early Th2 immune response, prior to the onset of bacteremia, is beneficial for protection against CMt reinfection [27] . This result was not found in the study by Hicks et al. [28] , where an early increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) was observed in cats protected from Mhf reinfection. Furthermore, the immune response seemed to be skewed towards a Th1 response after primary Mhf infection, whereas a switch from an initial Th1 to a delayed Th2 response was observed after primary CMt infection [27, 28] . These results suggest that cats respond to infection by different feline hemoplasma species with different immune mechanisms.",

The RBC OF reached maximal values at day 21 pi in eight out of ten animals in group A (range, 50% hemolysis in NaCl 0.63-0.79% w/v) and at day 100 pi in cat JHZ1 (50% hemolysis in NaCl 0.62% w/v) and at day 179 pi in cat JHW1 (50% hemolysis in NaCl 0.66% w/v; Figure 4A ). Cat JHW3 in group B, which turned Mhf PCR-positive only after the end of the experiment (day 154 pi), showed a pronounced increase in relative RBC OF at the time of Mhf bacteremia (50% hemolysis in NaCl 0.75% w/v, day 179 pi; reference interval, 50% hemolysis in NaCl 0.50-0.57% w/v; Figure 4B ). All cats in both groups tested negative in the direct Coombs test at all time points (data not shown).",

            "text": "This is the first study to investigate the protective role of the humoral immune response against hemoplasma infection using a passive immunization experiment. Our study demonstrated that the passive transfer of antibodies from Mhf-recovered to na\u00efve SPF cats does not prevent infection, high bacterial loads and the development of clinical signs following homologous challenge with Mhf. The passively immunized and control cats showed no differences in the onset and extent of bacteremia and anemia during the course of Mhf infection. Hicks et al. [28] recently documented that Mhf-recovered cats were protected from reinfection following re-challenge with a homologous Mhf isolate. Our study indicates that the presence of antibodies to Mhf cannot mediate protection against homologous challenge, but that cellular or innate immune mechanisms may be necessary to provide protection against Mhf infection. This is also in line with the study by Hicks et al. [28] , which reported protection from Mhf reinfection in the absence of a pronounced Th2-type response in the cats after re-challenge. In the latter study, the protected cats showed no increase in anti-DnaK antibody and IL-10 mRNA levels following Mhf re-challenge. The anti-DnaK antibody levels in the passively immunized cats were only higher in the first 2 weeks after transfusion than in the control cats, and they remained below the threshold for seropositivity up to day 28 pi. It is possible that the level of antibodies in the passively immunized cats following transfusion was not sufficiently high to prevent bacteremia. However, Hicks et al. [28] documented protection from Mhf although the antibody levels to DnaK did not rise after Mhf challenge infection and remained at rather low levels (mean log-transformed relative antibody level (RAL) < 1.2) when compared to the control cats with de novo Mhf infection (peak mean RAL > 2.2). They concluded that if Mhf-specific antibodies had been responsible for immune protection in these cats, then low levels of anti-DnaK antibodies could be sufficient to provide protection against Mhf infection. Because the assay and the calculations used to quantify anti-DnaK antibodies in that study were different from those used in the present study, a direct comparison of antibody titers was not possible. Furthermore, it needs to be considered that antibodies with different epitope specificities that are not detected with current DnaK ELISA could mediate immune protection. However, assays to measure such antibodies are not available.",

All CMt-recovered cats were serologically positive before Mhf inoculation. The study suggested that the pre-existing antibodies against CMt might have had enhanced infection kinetics in the CMt-recovered cats [15] . Although infection kinetics were not different between the passively immunized and control cats in this study, our results still suggest that the transfer of antibodies from Mhf-recovered cats could potentially be harmful. The passively immunized cats showed a significant increase in RBC OF during the course of infection. This effect was not observed in the control cats, indicating that the increase was not simply due to a non-specific effect of plasma transfusion on RBC fragility. It can be hypothesized that the antibodies bound to the Mhf organisms attached to RBCs. RBC-bound antibodies have been found after primary Mhf infection [16, 39, 40] and can induce receptor-mediated RBC phagocytosis or the activation of the complement system [41] . In the present study, RBCbound antibodies were not detected in the cats by Coombs test, but the sensitivity of this assay may be limited [42] .",

RBC destruction leads to the formation of free hemoglobin, which is processed by the mononuclear phagocytic system. During this process, bilirubin is formed, released in the blood stream and further metabolized and excreted by the liver. During pronounced RBC destruction, the capacity of the liver to metabolize bilirubin is overwhelmed, and hyperbilirubinemia occurs. Hyperbilirubinemia was observed in three cats of group A, although mean bilirubin concentrations in both groups remained within the reference interval. Nevertheless, the higher RBC OF values and occasionally higher bilirubin concentrations could point towards a more pronounced RBC destruction in the passively immunized cats following subsequent Mhf challenge exposure. The passively immunized cats showed signs of a more pronounced immune response when compared to control cats. Cats of group A showed higher lymphocyte, monocyte and B lymphocyte counts and higher total protein and globulin concentrations than the control cats at several time points during the experiment. Furthermore, peak globulin concentrations coincided with peak anti-DnaK antibody levels in both groups. This result was also found in our recent study, where we documented polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia during Mhf infection coinciding with high anti-DnaK antibodies [15] . We speculated that a large portion of the immune globulin pool was not hemoplasma-specific and was potentially due to a polyclonal B lymphocyte activation. The induction of autoreactive antibodies has recently been reported for the porcine hemoplasma Mycoplasma suis and is thought to be caused by the upregulation of B lymphocytes in response to changes to the RBC surface of the infected host [43] .",

This has been reported for other feline pathogens, i.e. feline coronavirus (FCoV) which can cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [44] . During the pathogenesis of FIP, the virus targets macrophages and infection of these cells can be enhanced in the presence of antibodies (antibody-dependent enhancement, ADE) [45] . Takano et al. [44] showed that cats passively immunized with antibodies to serotype I FCoV showed an enhanced onset of disease following inoculation with the homologous serotype; this was not found when cats passively immunized with antibodies to serotype II FCoV were challenged with serotype I. The authors concluded that FCoV re-infection with the same serotype might induce ADE and could advance the development of FIP. Although ADE has also been suspected in bacterial infection [46] , it is unknown whether it might play a role in the pathogenesis of feline hemoplasma infections [15] . Signs of infection enhancement have recently been documented in \"Candidatus M. turicensis\"-recovered, seropositive cats following a challenge with Mhf [15] . The study suggested that the presence of antibodies directed against CMt could enhance Mhf infection. However, to the best of our knowledge, disease enhancement after rechallenge with the same feline hemoplasma species has not been documented. In contrast, two studies showed that cats that had recovered from Mhf or CMt infection were protected from re-infection following re-challenge with the same hemoplasma species, respectively [27, 28] . Both studies had used an aliquot of the same Mhf or CMt isolate for re-infection that had been used for primary infection of the cats (personal communication, RHL).",

In two recent studies we reported a very similar pattern in the lymphocyte subsets following Mhf infection of na\u00efve and CMt-recovered cats.

We documented leukopenia and neutropenia, as well as decreased eosinophils, lymphocytes and increased monocytes, at times of peak Mhf bacteremia also in a recent study [15] .

Although low-level bacteremia, below the detection limit of the PCR assay, cannot be completely excluded in this cat, we would expect a productive infection to result in seroconversion [20, 50] . Because all cats in this study were kept under strictly controlled hygienic conditions, vector-borne transmission between the cats can be excluded. However, all cats of group B were housed together and four out of five cats in group B tested Mhf PCR-positive at the time that bacteremia and seroconversion occurred in cat JHW3. Therefore, direct transmission between the cats, i.e., by aggressive interactions, seems most likely, although no obvious clinical signs of aggressive interactions were observed in the cats in this study at any time during the experiment. A direct transmission of Mhf through saliva seems unlikely because only low hemoplasma loads can be detected in saliva of Mhf-infected cats [22] and transmission by oral or subcutaneous inoculation of saliva has not been successful for another feline hemoplasma species, CMt [19] .",
