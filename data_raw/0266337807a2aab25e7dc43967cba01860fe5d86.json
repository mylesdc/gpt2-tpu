We collected both blood and naso/oro-pharyngeal (NP/ OP) swabs from consecutive consenting patients \u00b3 1 year of age, with an axillary temperature \u00b3 37.5\u00b0C, and symptom onset of \u00a3 5 days. Specimens were analyzed using both acute febrile illness (AFI) and respiratory TaqMan array cards (Resp TAC) for multiagent detection of 56 different bloodstream and respiratory agents. In addition, we collected epidemiologic data to further characterize our patient population. We enrolled 205 febrile patients, including 70 children (1 < 15 years of age; 34%) and 135 adults (\u00b3 15 years of age; 66%). AFI TAC and Resp TAC were performed on 191 whole blood specimens and 115 NP/OP specimens, respectively. We detected nucleic acid for Plasmodium (57%), Leptospira (2%), and dengue virus (1%) among blood specimens. In addition, we detected 17 different respiratory agents, most notably, Haemophilus influenzae (64%), Streptococcus pneumonia (56%), Moraxella catarrhalis (39%), and respiratory syncytial virus (11%) among NP/OP specimens. Overall median cycle threshold was measured at 26.5. This study provides a proofof-concept for the use of a multiagent diagnostic approach for exploratory research on febrile illness and underscores the utility of quantitative molecular diagnostics in complex epidemiologic settings of sub-Saharan Africa.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] In Tanzania's South-Central region, data regarding the cause of nonmalarial febrile illness are currently lacking. At present, the malaria rapid diagnostic test is the only diagnostic tool used to direct febrile patient management in this region. [7] [8] [9] Thus, when a patient presents with fever and tests negative for malaria, clinical care providers must rely upon symptomatic conditions alone to define provisional diagnoses and determine appropriate treatment regimens. [10] [11] [12] Stakeholders have therefore recognized the need to improve knowledge surrounding the etiology of febrile illness, to optimize care, and to improve clinical outcomes. 3, 13, 14 In the regions of sub-Saharan Africa where viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections are not well-quantified, pathogenspecific diagnostic approaches to syndromic surveillanceevaluating only one or few pathogens-are inadequate. Most of these pathogen-specific studies have solely targeted malaria, and thus failed to consider other causative agents of febrile illness. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Given that multiple coinfections may contribute to morbidity, the detection of a single agent may not provide a complete understanding of disease etiology.",

Given that Kilombero is located in a highly endemic area for malaria, the detection of Plasmodium parasitemia in older children and adults is not unexpected and is not necessarily indicative of fever etiology. However, as observed in overall Ct distributions, Plasmodium was detected with the lowest median Ct value (18.5) , signaling relatively high parasite loads among affected individuals.

For the purposes of this study, we did not state final determination of disease etiology, but we included agents in our analyses if nucleic acid was detected and presented distributions of Ct for relative quantification of microbial loads. In addition, while AFI and Resp TAC are both validated diagnostic techniques, the specificity and sensitivity of these assays are not 100%. 27, 28 In addition, this pilot survey was limited both temporally and geographically and yielded a rather small sample size of 205 participants. Given the varying seasonal patterns of both respiratory, as well as vector-borne diseases, different results could have been obtained if this study had been conducted in another region or during another season or year. Furthermore, given resource and testing constraints of this study, we solely enrolled febrile patients meeting our enrollment criteria, and thus did not enroll community-or hospital-based controls for subsequent analyses.",
