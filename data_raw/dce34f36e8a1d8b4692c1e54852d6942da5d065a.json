Therefore, it is urgent for us to find out efficient ways to prevent and control this disease. In this study, the antiviral activity of a cationic amphibian antimicrobial peptide Caerin1.1 against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was evaluated by an in vitro system using Vero cells. We found that even at a very low concentration, Caerin1.1 has the ability to destroy the integrity of the virus particles to block the release of the viruses, resulting in a considerable decrease in PEDV infections. In addition, Caerin1.1 showed powerful antiviral activity without interfering with the binding progress between PEDV and the receptor of the cells, therefore, it could be used as a potential antiviral drug or as a microbicide compound for prevention and control of PEDV.",

It is the causative agent of an acute infectious enteric disease known as porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) that is clinically manifested by severe watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in the suckling piglets [2] . With the high mortality in the piglets, PED infection finally caused enormous economic losses to the global swine industry, especially after its recent re-emergence caused by variant PEDV strain throughout the world [3, 4] . However, the classical PED vaccines could not provide appropriate protection against the variant PEDV infection. Considering this, relevant studies of new antiviral materials are needed to prevent and control emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases such as PED [5] .",

Moreover, AMPs can work as growth and health promoters to improve the performance of pigs by enhancing the immune status, improving the intestinal health, and alleviating the toxic effects of deoxynivalenol in pigs [15] .

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of Caerin1.1 in the membrane mimetic environments showed that it has two \u03b1-helices and a flexible hinge region composed of two prolines [18] . Both prolines are essential for the antimicrobial activities [19] . Some studies have reported that Caerin1.1 exhibits antibacterial and antiviral properties by forming pores on the membrane to destroy the integrity of the particles [20, 21] . Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that Caerin1.1 has a complete inhibitory effect against HIV by preventing viral fusion to target cells and disrupting the HIV envelope, and, remarkably, that Caerin1.1 is also highly effective in inhibiting the transfer of HIV from dendritic cells (DCs) to T cells even when DCs are continuously exposed to peptides for 8 h after virus capture, and that Caerin1.1 has a bacteriostatic activity against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis [8, 21] . Although the mechanism that suppresses the activities of some bacteria and viruses has been illustrated clearly, it remains unknown whether Caerin1.1 can inhibit the growth of PEDV. So, this study is aimed to investigate the function of Caerin1.1.",

Some \u03b1-helical peptides such as Melittin and Cecropin have been reported to exert antiviral activities by direct disruption of virus membranes or inhibition of the virus replication [31] . The current study found that Caerin1.1 was able to destroy the structure of viral particles and reduce the viruses capable of infecting the cells and decrease their titers almost up to 3 logs. This is the first attempt to reveal that Caerin1.1 has strong antiviral activity against PEDV infection. Some AMPs including Cecropin D (CD-PRRSV, SALPs-AIV) were reported to have blocked viral attachment and invasion by interacting with the receptors of the host cells [32] . Based on these findings, so we tried to keep PEDV infection within the periods of the attachment and entry through the temperature control, and the results showed no evident differences in protein expression among attachment period treated group, entry period treated group, and the PEDV control group. The number of virus infecting cells did not diminish. This means that Caerin1.1 did not interfere with the attachment and entry process. Considering the fact that Caerin1.1 does not compete with the virus to conjugate with the cells, and the fact that viral attachment-entry processes are very fast and Caerin1.1 will not have enough time to act against the viral membrane, it can be concluded that Caerin1.1 has less significant antiviral activities in the pre-incubation of Caerin1.1-cells progress. To further understand the mechanism in the post-treatment process, we examined the antiviral activity during the replication period. The results showed that Caerin1.1 did not have obvious antiviral effect during viral replication period, but it can control the infection progress by blocking the release of PEDV particles to reduce viral transmission among the adjacent cells.",

As a matter of fact, we did a combination treatment with Piscidin which was also proved to be effective against PEDV [34] , but the results were not as good as expected based on our unpublished work. The mechanisms still remain to be further investigated. Although the joint use of Piscidin and Caerin1.1 did not work as well as expected, other candidates can be explored for the prevention of PEDV and other pathogens in drug combination studies. On the other hand, some related research work has been done in our laboratory. Our other unpublished work has preliminarily testified the extraordinary ability of Caerin1.1 against some other viruses including PRV (Pseudorabies virus) which is a herpesvirus with double-stranded DNA that can infect many mammal species. Therefore, many potential functions of Caerin1.1 are still to be explored in the future.",

The results show that Caerin1.1 can maintain the integrity of the host cells since it has very low cytotoxicity, and that it exhibits excellent virucidal activity in a dose-dependent manner even at very low concentrations. Caerin1.1 can reduce the viruses infecting the cells by destroying the integrity of the viral membrane, resulting in the decrease in the virus replication and protein expression. Caerin1.1 can also interfere with the virus release process essential for the inhibition of intracellular infection. Therefore, Caerin1.1 is an excellent antiviral material against PEDV. In conclusion, our study testifies the outstanding antiviral activities of Caerin1.1 and lays a foundation for future research and for the application of amphibian antimicrobial peptides. ",
