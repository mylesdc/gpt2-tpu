On August 8, 2014 , WHO under the International Health Regulations (2005) declared the Ebola epidemic in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [2] . A recommendation of the emergency committee was that countries with active EVD transmission should conduct exit screening at international airports, seaports, and major land crossings, and that other countries should not generally ban travel or trade [2, 3] . Decision to activate airport screening, however, was made by individual governments. A key benefit of an effective and rigorously conduced airport exit screening is protection of the international community by source containment to prevent international spread [3] . However, there are limited data on screening outcomes from countries with active EVD transmission [4] .",

Entry screening at points of entry undertaken as an additional measure prove ineffective as a screening modality. e low yields for exit screening are consistent with those entry screening outcomes for EVD in airport settings of high-income nations [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Of 1,993 arrivals to the United States of America from countries with EVD transmission (during October 2014 to November 2014), a total of 86 travellers (4.3%) were referred to public health officers-all of whom were health care workers [11] . None were diagnosed with Ebola. In New South Wales, Australia between 1 st October 2014 and 13 th April 2015, public health staff assessed a total of 122 travellers arriving from countries with EVD outbreaks [14] . Six people (5%) developed symptoms compatible with EVD and required further assessment, none developed EVD. State health authorities recommended targeted monitoring of at-risk populations such as returning health care workers. In the UK, 3388 passengers were screened at airports between 14 November 2014 and 4 January 2015, and 130 people were referred for follow up with no cases of EVD reported [14] . A European CDC review concluded that entry screening has an exceedingly low yield, contributing to a limited extent to the prevention of importation of EVD disease [10] . Screening of other infectious disease at points of entry have also yielded low detection rates [15, 16] .",

(6) Used proper PPE and maintain a distance of 1 metre from traveller or worker (appropriate PPE included: gown, face mask, face shield/goggles, gloves and booties).Travellers or workers who, in the assessment of the secondary screener, do not meet risk criteria for EVD were allowed to continue travel or work. ose traveller's boarding passes were marked indicating that the traveller has undergone screening.
