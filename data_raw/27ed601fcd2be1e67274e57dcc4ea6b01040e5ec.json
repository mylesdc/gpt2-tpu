Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is limited by the accumulation of non-specific products, but nucleic acid circuitry can be used to probe and distinguish specific amplicons. By combining this high temperature isothermal amplification method with a thermostable invertase, we can directly transduce Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Zaire Ebolavirus templates into glucose signals, with a sensitivity as low as 20-100 copies/\u03bc l, equating to atto-molar (or low zepto-mole). Virus from cell lysates and synthetic templates could be readily amplified and detected even in sputum or saliva. An OR gate that coordinately triggered on viral amplicons further guaranteed fail-safe virus detection. The method describes has potential for accelerating point-of-care applications, in that biological samples could be applied to a transducer that would then directly interface with an off-the-shelf, approved medical device.",

A simple molecular assay for MERS-CoV can potentially be developed by relying on the exquisite sensitivity and extreme simplicity of isothermal amplification reactions 11-16 , such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which yields up to 10 10 -fold amplification within 10 min to two hours 17,18 .

We now show that LAMP reactions can be made user-friendly and field-based by integrating LAMP, strand exchange signal transduction, and a commercial-off-the-shelf device, a glucometer, for pathogen detection. The use of glucometers to monitor non-glucose targets was pioneered by Lu's group, who adapted this device for aptamer-or DNAzyme-based detection of cocaine, ATP and metal ions 22-25 . These and other efforts 26-30 inspired our more generalizable approach to molecular diagnostics. The addition of a thermostable invertase allows all reactions to occur in the same tube at a wide temperature range, and the simplicity of the format ultimately yields atto-molar (or low zepto-mole) detection of pathogens such as MERS-CoV or Zaire Ebolavirus (ZEBOV or Zaire Ebola), even in sputum or saliva samples. The strand exchange reactions ensure low false positives, while the use of an OR gate guards against false negative detection. Moreover, the reaction components are modular and can be readily adapted to different protocols covering different reaction temperatures, times, volumes, and vagaries of reagent storage.",

Yeast invertase was conjugated to FPc 22 and could still successfully hydrolyze sucrose at its optimum temperature, 55 \u00b0C ( Figure S1A ).

The efficiency of strand displacement (Step II) was assessed using DNA mimic of the LAMP loop (1A-T). Strand displacement of an invertase conjugate was measured as a function of 1A-T concentration, and as little as 1 nM of oligonucleotide could be detected by a glucometer after 40 min (Step III, Figure S2 ).

We show how an isothermal amplification reaction can lead to the production of amplicons that specifically strand exchange invertase, which in turn leads to the production of an easily read glucose signal from otherwise inert sucrose.

            "text": "One issue with the transduction to glucose and readout by a glucometer is the potential presence of different levels of background glucose in biological samples. For more complex samples where endogenous glucose may affect virus detection, it may be possible to first remove background glucose or to do background subtraction by recording the ambient glucose level in the sample. 22 But the effect of existed glucose will be of less import with the detection of MERS-CoV or ZEBOV in oral or other non-blood or non-urine samples. For example, viral loads in a MERS-CoV patient are as high as 1-2 \u00d7 10 6 copies per mL in the lower respiratory tract, 1 \u00d7 10 3 copies per mL in stool, and 5-6 \u00d7 10 3 copies per mL in an oronasal swab 38 . It was reported that there should be even more detectable MERS-CoV virus in sputum than in oronasal swabs. 39 Given the excellent limit of detection (0.06PFU or 100 copies) we have observed, these clinically relevant limits should be observed against a moderate glucose background. For example, the average level of glucose in fasting saliva in non-diabetics is around 6 mg/dl, which would show a \"LO\" symbol in the glucometer and is small relative to our ~60 mg/ml signal amplitude. 40 Similarly, RT-PCR results 41, 42 suggest that ZEBOV can also be detected in low glucose samples such as saliva, stool, and tears during the acute period of illness. Thus, while glucose interference should be taken into account during assay development, it should not obscure reliable, robust detection of viral pathogens via our transduction method. We have proven the ZEBOV VP30 template can be detected when it is spiked into synthetic sputum ( Figure S7A ) and human saliva samples ( Figure S7B ). The synthetic sputum contained human genomic DNA, salmon sperm DNA, mucin, and other components (provided by the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, PATH, Seattle, WA). 21 The mucin was liquefied with 2% freshly made N-acetyl-L-cysteine and 1% sodium hydroxide prior to assay because it inhibited the Bst 2.0 polymerase. Human saliva was directly used after 10 min pre-heating (at 95 o C). The LAMP-OSD-glucometer method showed true positives in both 26% sputum and 20% saliva samples ( Figure S7 ), without losing any sensitivity compared to pure buffer (Fig. 5) . That said, signal amplitudes were decreased, especially for low copy samples.",

As few as 20 nucleic acid templates or 0.06 PFU of inactivated virus could be detected. ZEBOV virus could be detected by simply reconfiguring the primers and probes used for transduction. The nucleic acid strand exchange reactions were particularly amenable to further development for point-of-care applications, in that they were modular, programmable, and relatively insensitive to temperature and storage. These features were further highlighted by demonstrating that false negative reactions could be avoided by programming an OR gate into the transducer.",

The Inv-FPc conjugate was synthesized according to a previously published protocol with slight modifications 22 . Invertase was conjugated to the linker by dissolving 2.5 mg of yeast invertase (or TmINV) and 1 mg of the sulfo-SMCC linker in 1 mL PBS buffer (10 mM Sodium Phosphate, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4). This solution was shaken at 750 rpm for 2.5 hour at room temperature (RT, 25 \u00b0C). Subsequently, unreacted reagents were removed by filtration through an Amicon-30 K filter and the invertase-SMCC conjugate was subjected to six washes with PBS prior to resuspension in 850 \u03bc L PBS. Meanwhile, 120 \u03bc l of the thiol-labeled oligonucleotide SH-FPc (resuspended at a concentration of 125 \u03bc M in water) was activated for 1 hour at RT by continuously mixing with 15 \u03bc L of 100 mM TCEP.

All available ZEBOV genomic sequences were aligned using MUSCLE and the most conserved regions in the VP30 gene were used for designing LAMP primers. PrimerExplorer 4 (Eiken) was used to generate 3 sets of LAMP primers composed of the outer primers F3 and B3 and the inner primers FIP and BIP. Primer design was constrained to include at least a 30 bp gap between the F1 and F2 as well as between the B1 and B2 priming sites. These gaps should become part of the LAMP amplicon loop structures and were included to allow the subsequent recognition by the OSD probes. Primer specificity for all the sequenced ZEBOV isolates and a corresponding lack of significant cross-reactivity to other nucleic acids of human, related filoviral or pathogenic origin was further assessed using NCBI BLAST. All three primer sets were tested by amplification of plasmids bearing ebolavirus genomic fragments in standard LAMP reactions. Amplicon accumulation was analyzed at end-point by agarose gel electrophoresis and in real-time by measuring the incorporation of the intercalating fluorophore EvaGreen. Ultimately one of the three primer sets, ZEBOV.3.3 that demonstrated target-dependent amplification kinetics and generated minimal spurious amplicons was chosen for further assay development. were heated to 95 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by chilling on ice for 2 min (this pre-denaturing process was not necessary but typically results in improved sensitivity). Then, 1 \u03bc L (8 U) of Bst polymerase 2.0 and 0.2 \u03bc L (2 U) AMV reverse transcriptase were added to initiate the RT-LAMP reaction. The reactions were incubated for 1.5 hour in a thermal cycler maintained at 55 o C. A 5 \u03bc l aliquot of the reaction mixed with 3 \u03bc l of a 6 \u00d7 DNA loading dye was then analyzed by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Gel analysis of LAMP products was performed in a room completely separate from the normal laboratory space on a different floor of the building.
