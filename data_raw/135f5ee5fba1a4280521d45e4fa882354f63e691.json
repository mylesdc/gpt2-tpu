The incidence object is obtained by running the function incidence() specifying two inputs: a vector of dates (representing onset of individual cases) and an interval specification. The dates can be any type of input representing dates including Date and POSIXct objects, as well as numeric and integer values. The dates are aggregated into counts based on the user-defined interval representing the number of days for each bin. The interval can also be defined as a text string of either \"week\", \"month\", \"quarter\", or \"year\" to represent intervals that can not be defined by a fixed number of days. For these higher-level intervals, an extra parameter-standard-is available to specify if the interval should start at the standard beginning of the interval (e.g. weeks start on Monday and months start at the first of the month). incidence() also accepts a groups argument which can be used to obtain stratified incidence. The basic elements of the incidence object can be obtained by the accessors get_counts(), get_dates(), and get_interval().",

Here, we highlight three simple functionalities in incidence for estimating parameters via modeling or bootstrap and the two specialized data classes that are used to store the models and parameter estimates. As a basic model, we implement the simple log-linear regression approach in the function fit(), which can be used to fit exponential increase or decrease of incidence over time by log-transforming case counts and applying a linear regression on these transformed data. The log-linear regression model is of the form log(y) = r \u00d7 t + b where Figure 1. Generalized workflow from incidence object construction to modeling and visualization.

This function returns the estimated peak with a confidence interval along with the boostrap estimates. Alternatively, the function fit_optim_split() can be used to detect the optimal turning point of the epidemic and fit two separate models on either side of the peak.

The incidence object i.7.group is a list with class of incidence for which several generic methods are implemented, including print.incidence() and plot.incidence(). Typing incidence object i.7.group implicitly calls the specific function print.incidence() and prints out the summary of the data and its list components. The 5,829 cases (the total number of cases stored in the $n component) with dates of symptom onset ranging from 2014-04-07 to 2015-04-27 (spanning from 2014-W15 to 2015-W18 in terms of the ISO 8601 standard for representing weeks) are used for building the incidence object i.7.group. The $counts component contains the actual incidence for defined bins, which is a matrix with one column per group. Here $count is a matrix with 56 rows and 6 columns as groups by hospital with 6 factor levels are specified. The bin size in number of days is stored in the $interval component. In this example, 7 days suggests that weekly incidence is computed, while by default, daily incidence is computed with the argument interval = 1. The $dates component contains all the dates marking the left side of the bins, in the format of the input data (e.g. Date, integer, etc.).

In order to obtain a more complete picture of the epidemic dynamics of ZVD in Colombia, we merge these two data.frames into a single one, dat2, by variable date. As dat2 is already pre-computed daily incidence rather than a vector of dates such as those in example 1, we can directly convert it into an incidence object grouped by geographical locations, i.group, by using the as.incidence() function. This shows the flexibility of the incidence package in making incidence objects. Using the pool() function, the daily incidence stratified by locations, i.group, can be collapsed into an incidence object without groups, i.pooled. The stratified and pooled daily incidence plots of ZVD in Colombia are shown in Figure 4 , from which we can see that the epidemic of ZVD occurred earlier in San Andres Island than in Girardot. As shown in Figure 4B , the pooled daily incidence in Colombia shows approximately exponential phases before and after the epidemic peak. Therefore, we fit two log-linear regression models around the peak to characterize the epidemic dynamics of ZVD in Colombia. Such models can be separately fitted to the two phases of the epicurve of i.pooled using the fit() function, which, however, requires us to know what date should be used to split the epicurve in two phases (see the argument split in the fit() function). Without any knowledge on the splitting date, we can turn to the fit_optim_split() function to look for the optimal splitting date (i.e. the one maximizing the average fit of both models) and then fit two log-linear regression models before and after the optimal splitting date. The predictions and their 95% CIs from the two incidence_fit objects, 'before' and 'after', can be added to the existing incidence plot of i.pooled using the piping-friendly function add_incidence_fit(). As shown in Figure 5 , based on visual comparison of models and data, these two log-linear regression models provide a decent approximation for the actual dynamics of the epidemic (adjusted R 2 = 0.83 and 0.77 for the increasing and decreasing phases, respectively).

It is honourable that the name of a package \"incidence\" is the choice of the creators of course. It is true that incident cases are all individuals who change to non-disease status from disease, so in this way \"incidence\" could refer to the occurrence of new cases. In recent modelling papers, the term incidence has been associated to count time series under the same approach, so-called \"incidence time series\" . Nevertheless, the current name can be misleading for a certain number of epidemiologists. The reason is that in epidemiology the term incidence is traditionally associated to a measure of morbidity, so-called 'Incidence proportion' (or attack rate or risk; for more information see:",

At the first glance, the target audience reading the package name might believe that the package is dedicated to incidence calculation rather than epidemiological curve graphic representation and some basic modelling utilities. Indeed, the package is presented as being able to compute, handle and visualize time-related count data through epi-curve and additional derived features which are not related to measure of incidence (proportion) strictly speaking. 1 presented as being able to compute, handle and visualize time-related count data through epi-curve and additional derived features which are not related to measure of incidence (proportion) strictly speaking. You may wish to consider adding such features and include new capabilities to this package which can cover calculation/representation of incidence in epidemiology. For instance, adding a slot for population data to populate the denominator of an incidence proportion calculation. This can be completed by dedicated graphic outputs with points for each incidence values and line through all data points (geom line). Factor-specific incidence rate (and corresponding CI) can be considered as further extensions (factor: sex-, age-, or any other factor). The advantage is the possibility to overlay and compare several incidence line charts coming for different locations (e.g. attack rate for different health districts or for several population group). It is a suggestion and it is acceptable that the authors would keep the package focus on basic utilities and epicurve representation.",

A more careful description in the MS is needed to highlight this and other shortcomings of this approach.

While new data-such as whole genome pathogen sequences-are increasingly useful complements to epidemiological data (Gire et al., 2014), epidemic curves-which describe the number of new cases through time (incidence)-remain the most important source of information, particularly early in an outbreak. Specifically epidemic curves(often referred to as 'epicurves') represent the number of new cases per time unit based on the date or time of symptom onset. While conceptually simple, epicurves are useful in many respects. They provide a simple, visual outline of epidemic dynamics, which can be used for assessing the growth or decline of an outbreak (Barrett et al., 2016; Fitzgerald et al., 2014; Jernberg et al., 2015; Lanini et al., 2014; Nhan et al., 2018) and therefore informing intervention measures (Meltzer et al., 2014; WHO Ebola Response Team et al., 2014; WHO Ebola Response Team et al., 2015). In addition, epicurves also form the raw material used by a range of modelling techniques for short-term forecasting (Cori et al., 2013; Funk et al., 2018; Nouvellet et al., 2018; Viboud et al., 2018) as well as in outbreak detection algorithms from syndromic surveillance data (Farrington & Andrews, 2003; Unkel et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Overall I think this package is sensible and well-designed. My only major concern is with the log-linear fitting procedures; on the one hand, the authors say clearly that there are many fitting procedures which cannot (and should not) all be squeezed into this package, and I suspect that they don't intend these fits to be taken as very precise measures of the growth rate. On the other hand, I'm quite concerned by the possibility that users will take growth rates and confidence intervals estimated by these simplistic fits too seriously. There are a number of delicate issues around the estimation of epidemic growth rates:Assume log-Normal incidence (as done by a log-linear fit), or make other distributional Assume log-Normal incidence (as done by a log-linear fit), or make other distributional assumptions (e.g. Poisson or negative binomial)?If using exponential or log-linear fits, what time window should one use to capture enough of the beginning of the epidemic but not bias the growth rate downward by capturing the saturation phase of the epidemic (Ma I think I would have preferred that, if they were not going to go deeply into this area, that the authors instead provide some sort of non-parametric smooth fit (perhaps constraining the changes to be monotonically increasing before the peak and decreasing after the peak) rather than oversimplifying in this way.The minimal change that is needed to the document is a stronger set of caveats/warnings to users that the log-linear model may have major shortcomings in some circumstances, and should not be accepted unquestioningly.The package suggests that the fit() function is extendable to allow other fitting methods (\"While the incidence package returns incidence_fit objects containing log-linear models by default, they can be constructed from any model from which it's possible to extract the growth rate (r) and predict incidence along the model\"); I wasn't able to figure out how to achieve that goal.The main use of the package is for converting from line lists to aggregated incidence data. It would be useful (I can't tell if it's possible) to easily be able to aggregate data that are already in date/incidence form to coarser scales, or to approximately disaggregate incidence data.I had trouble fitting epidemic curves to data sets that only included incidence up to the peak or shortly beyond (it seems that the model was automatically trying to estimate a decline rate as well as an increase rate). This seems like an odd choice for a tool that people may be using to work with data from emerging epidemics that have not yet peaked.",
