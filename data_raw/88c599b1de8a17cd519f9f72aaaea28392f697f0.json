            "text": "Manipulating cell cycle is one of the common strategies used by viruses to generate favorable cellular environment to facilitate viral replication. Coxsackievirus B (CVB) is one of the major viral pathogens of human myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Because of its small genome, CVB depends on cellular machineries for productive replication. However, how the structural and non-structural components of CVB would manipulate cell cycle is not clearly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the capsid protein VP1 of CVB type 3 (CVB3) induced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. G1 arrest was the result of the decrease level of cyclin E and the accumulation of p27 Kip1 . Study on the gene expression profile of the cells expressing VP1 showed that the expression of both heat shock protein 70-1 (Hsp70-1) and Hsp70-2 was significantly up-regulated. Knockdown of Hsp70 resulted in the increased level of cyclin E and the reduction of p27 Kip1 . We further demonstrated that the phosphorylation of the heat shock factor 1, which directly promotes the expression of Hsp70, was also increased in the cell expressing VP1. Moreover, we show that CVB3 infection also induced G1 arrest, likely due to dysregulating Hsp70, cyclin E, and p27, while knockdown of Hsp70 dramatically inhibited viral replication. Cell cycle arrest at G1 phase facilitated CVB3 infection, since viral replication in the cells synchronized at G1 phase dramatically increased. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the VP1 of CVB3 induces cell cycle arrest at G1 phase through up-regulating Hsp70. Our findings suggest that the capsid protein VP1 of CVB is capable of manipulating cellular activities during viral infection.",

The control of cell cycle ensures the faithful replication and segregation of the genome (Fan et al., 2017) . The unidirectional progression of cell cycle is controlled by the periodic activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). The activity of Cdks largely depends on their partnership with specific cyclins in the distinct phase of cell cycle. In mammalian cells, cyclin D, cyclin A/E, and cyclin A/B couple with Cdk4/6, Cdk2, and Cdk1, respectively, to coordinate the transition between distinct cell cycle stages (Sanchez and Dynlacht, 2005) .",

            "text": "Coxsackievirus B (CVB) are species of non-enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the Enterovirus genus in the family of Picornaviridae (Garmaroudi et al., 2015; Leveque et al., 2017) . The six serotypes of CVB can cause a wide range of illnesses from mild gastrointestinal disorder to severe meningitis or myocarditis, which, in some cases, may progress to cardiomyopathy and heart failure (Alidjinou et al., 2014; Garmaroudi et al., 2015) . The genome of CVB encodes four structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) (Garmaroudi et al., 2015) . These structural proteins are configured into the typical icosahedral capsid. Beside the four structural proteins, CVB also encodes non-structural proteins including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D (3D pol ) and viral proteases 2A (2A pro ) and 3C pro (Yajima and Knowlton, 2009) . To synthesize viral proteins, the genome of CVB is first translated into a single polypeptide that is cleaved by the viral proteases to generate viral structural and non-structural proteins (Garmaroudi et al., 2015) . It is believed that the interaction between viral proteins and cellular machinery plays a key role for the pathogenesis of CVB infection. Extensive studies have been focusing on viral non-structural proteins such as 2A pro and 3C pro , since these proteases not only cleave viral polyproteins, but also cleave important cellular proteins such as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) (Chau et al., 2007; Feng et al., 2014; Hanson et al., 2016) . Thus, CVB infection leads to the disturbance of various cellular machineries including the increased assembly of autophagosomes Xin et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016) , up-regulated ubiquitinproteasome system (UPS) (Luo et al., 2003a) , and ER stress (Luo et al., 2018) . However, it is not clearly defined how CVB infection would modulate the cell cycle.",

While a direct implication of CVB3 in the manipulation of cell cycle has already been demonstrated, whether viral capsid protein VP1 exerts impact on the progression of cell cycle is unknown. In our previous study, we identified that the capsid protein VP1 of CVB3 (hereafter VP1) contains nuclear localization signal and is imported into the nucleus (Wang et al., 2012) . In this work, the impact of VP1 on cell cycle was analyzed. Our results show that VP1 arrests cell cycle at G1 phase through up-regulating the expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). This finding reveals a new role of VP1 in facilitating the replication of CVB3.",

The p-Rb releases a fraction of the transcription factor E2F, which promotes the transcription of the genes including cyclin E and A. These cyclins couple with Cdk2 which functions as a positive feedback to trigger the switch from hypo-to hyper-phosphorylation of Rb.

The hyper-phosphorylation of Rb is critical for G/S transition (Johnson and Skotheim, 2013; Fisher, 2016) . However, we have no evidence concerning the phosphorylation status of Rb through determining a single phosphorylation site (serine 780) of this protein. Thus, data from the present study are not sufficient for us to reach the conclusion whether or not R point passage is achieved in the cells expressing VP1. Evidence has shown that at early G1 phase, Rb is mono-phosphorylated by cyclin D-Cdk4/6. At the later stage of G1 phase, cyclin E-Cdk2 complex inactivates Rb by hyper-phosphorylation (Narasimha et al., 2014; Fisher, 2016) . These observations suggest that cyclin E, in combination with Cdk2, plays a crucial role for the hyper-phosphorylation of Rb and the entry of S phase. Moreover, studies in recent years support the concept that the mechanism, which controls S-phase entry when cells are under stress, might be very distinct from that of the normal cycling cells (Johnson and Skotheim, 2013) . Our data demonstrate that the level of cyclin E was reduced in the cells expressing VP1, while p27 kip1 was accumulated. These results suggest that lack of cyclin E and/or the accumulation of p27 kip1 are sufficient to induce G1 arrest. In consistent with our findings, previous study has shown that the accumulation of cyclin E occurs after the passage of R point and before the entry of S phase (Ekholm et al., 2001) , indicating that adequate level of cyclin E is critical for S phase entry. Evidence also shows that E2F is not sufficient to induce G1/S transition without cyclin E (Duronio and O'Farrell, 1995) . Therefore, declined cyclin E level in the cells expressing VP1 would at least contribute to G1 arrest.",

Knockdown of Hsp70 with siRNA resulted in the accumulation of cyclin E and the reduction of p27 Kip1 . These data indicate that the up-regulated Hsp70 causes the decrease of cyclin E and the accumulation of p27 Kip1 , leading to G1 arrest.",

As important molecular chaperone, Hsp70 plays critical role in protein folding, membrane translocation of proteins, and protein degradation via proteasome pathway (Nitika, and Truman, 2017) . The expression of Hsp70 is often induced by cellular stress such as infection, ischemia, inflammation, and exposure to oxidants (Shamovsky and Nudler, 2008; Radons, 2016) . Previous studies have demonstrated that up-regulated Hsp70 during CVB3 infection promotes viral replication (Helmbrecht et al., 2000; Qiu et al., 2016; . CVB3 hijacks the host cell to produce viral RNA and proteins by shutting down the cap-dependent translation of cellular proteins, while the translation of viral proteins relies on the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5 untranslated region (UTR) of viral genome (Bonderoff and Lloyd, 2008; Ullmer and Semler, 2018) . However, the translation of Hsp70 depends on IRES rather than cap-dependent . This ensures that its synthesis is not interfered by CVB3 infection.",

HSF1, which is the key transcription regulator that binds the heat shock response element upstream of the promoter of HSPA (the gene coding Hsp70) (Chou et al., 2012) . In addition, it is implicated that the activation of HSF1 is also regulated by Hsp70. HSF1 basally interacts with Hsp70, and this interaction was interrupted by stress when misfolded proteins compete with HSF1 for the binding of Hsp70 (Zheng et al., 2016) . Phosphorylation, while as a positive factor that facilitates the activation of HSF1, seems not play a critical role (Zheng et al., 2016) . It has been shown that Hsp70 interacts with P1, the capsid precursor of poliovirus and CVB1 (Macejak and Sarnow, 1992) . Based on the reported studies and our results, we postulate that, in addition to the up-regulated phosphorylation of HSF1, VP1 of CVB3 might interfere with the interaction between HSF1 and Hsp70 through binding to either one of these proteins, leading to the release and activation of HSF1.",

UPS is also promoted and utilized by CVB3 infection (Luo et al., 2003b; Gao et al., 2008) . Therefore, similar to the finding that CVB3 promotes the degradation of cyclin D (Luo et al., 2003b) , it is possible that the reduced abundance of cyclin E is the result of its up-regulated degradation through UPS in the cells expressing VP1 or infected with CVB3. However, this mechanism cannot explain the accumulation of Cdk inhibitor p27 Kip1 . A recent study demonstrated that the ubiquitination of p27 Kip1 by the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH7/UBE2L3 stabilizes p27 Kip1 while other Cdk inhibitors are not affected (Whitcomb et al., 2019) , suggesting that there is an intricate mechanism which controls p27 Kip1 . In consistent with our finding, the up-regulation of Hsp70 and p27 Kip1 has been reported in the cells with G1 arrest induced by radiation (Seo et al., 2006) .",

Thus, the increased expression of Hsp70 could be one of the protective responses of the host cells to maintain proteostasis under the stress of viral infection (Xu et al., 2019) . Although the gene expression profile remains almost undisturbed in the cells expressing VP1, as a viral component, VP1 is very likely identified as a foreign protein by the host cell, which triggers the stress response including the increased expression of Hsp70. Moreover, the nuclear localization of VP1 might directly or indirectly influence the expression of limited genes including HSPA1A and HSPA1B. Although we show that the increased level of Hsp70 is likely due to the elevated phosphorylation level of HSF1, which directly promotes the transcription of Hsp70, it remains unknown how VP1 could impact the phosphorylation of HSF1.",

We emphasized the difference between the outcomes yielded by VP1 and VP1 H220T , a mutated VP1 which loses the nuclear localization capability, in order to confirm that the nuclear translocation of VP1 disturbs cellular functions. Therefore, the cell cycle test was controlled by the cells expressing VP1 H220T and normal cells, which had not been treated with the control plasmid pEGFP-C1. Later we realized that VP1 H220T may not be a proper control for the cell cycle evaluation, because it may disturb the nuclear function. Our microscopic observation showed that VP1 H220T binds to the nuclear membrane and blocks the nuclear pores (Wang et al., 2012) .
