However, the lack of bat specific reagents, in particular antibodies, has limited our knowledge of bat's immunity. Using crossreactive antibodies, we report the phenotypic and functional characterization of T cell subsets, B and NK cells in the fruit-eating bat Pteropus alecto. Our findings indicate the predominance of CD8 + T cells in the spleen from wild-caught bats that may reflect either the presence of viruses in this organ or predominance of this cell subset at steady state. Instead majority of T cells in circulation, lymph nodes and bone marrow (BM) were CD4 + subsets. Interestingly, 40% of spleen T cells expressed constitutively IL-17, IL-22 and TGF-\u03b2 mRNA, which may indicate a strong bias towards the Th17 and regulatory T cell subsets. Furthermore, the unexpected high number of T cells in bats BM could suggest an important role in T cell development. Finally, mitogenic stimulation induced proliferation and production of effector molecules by bats immune cells. This work contributes to a better understanding of bat's immunity, opening up new perspectives of therapeutic interventions for humans.",

Native from Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesia, this fruit-eating bat is not a threatened species, unlike other bats species. In 1994, P. alecto was found to be the natural reservoir for Hendra Virus (HeV), and responsible for spillover into horses in Australia, causing a severe respiratory disease in these animals 12 . Due to the importance of horse races in Australia, research on P. alecto has received a lot of attention and strong government (Australia) support. In addition, P. alecto bats have been found to harbor other virus species potentially pathogenic to humans, including Lyssavirus, closely related to rabies virus 13 , previously unknown paramyxoviruses 14 as well as a novel betacoronavirus 15 . Serological evidence of infection with Menangle virus (MenV) in Pteropus spp. in Australia was also reported in 2008 16 .",

This was supported by the broad expression of IRF7 mRNA transcripts involved in the regulation of the interferon (IFN) responses, in various tissues from P. alecto. In addition, IRF7 siRNA knockdown resulted in enhanced viral replication in a bat cell line 17 . Furthermore, the constitutive expression of three IFN-\u03b1 genes in P. alecto tissues, which is expected to turn on the cell antiviral state, has also been linked to the ability of bats to coexist with pathogenic viruses 19 .",

Recent transcriptome studies from three different bat species have provided evidence that genes involved in adaptive immunity in other species are conserved in bats [20] [21] [22] [23] . These genes include MHC class I and II molecules, T cell receptors and co-receptors such as CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD28, as well as B cell specific markers such as CD19, CD22, CD72 and immunoglobulins. However, the characterization of bat immune cells has not been reported and this is likely due to the lack of specific reagents, in particular, antibodies. While raising monoclonal antibodies specific to bat protein markers represents the best approach, it is nevertheless time consuming and costly. In contrast, cross-reactive antibodies raised against the same targets in other mammals (in particular mouse and human) may offer a cheaper and faster alternative. Using cross-reactive antibodies, flow cytometry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (Flow-FISH) technologies we provide here the first phenotypic and functional characterization of the main adaptive immune cell populations in the black flying fox P. alecto.",

            "text": "Protein sequence alignment. Using the P. alecto genome Ensembl database, the amino acid sequence of major lymphocyte surface markers, cytokines and transcriptional factors was aligned with that of their human and mouse counterparts (Table 1) . Overall, the identity ranged from 44-95% with higher percentages systematically found between P. alecto and human compared to P. alecto and mouse (Table 1) . Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of intracellular molecules such as transcription factors Gata3, T-bet and Eomes was highly conserved between bats and human/mouse with sequence identity ranging from 88-95%, whereas it was lower for the surface markers (44-78%). High sequence identity was also found between bat TNF and IL-10, and their human counterparts (88 and 83%, respectively). Identification of the major lymphocyte cell populations using cross-reactive antibodies. To assess the cross reactivity of anti-human/mouse antibodies with bat ortholog proteins, we tested 47 commercially available antibodies (Table S1 ). Among which only 9 displayed cross-reactivity by flow cytometry with P. alecto lymphocytes. Interestingly, among these 9 cross-reactive antibodies, only 3 target surface molecules (MHCII,  CD44 and CD11b), whereas the remaining 6 target intracellular molecules including the intracellular domain  of CD3, transcription factors (T-bet, Gata-3 and Eomes), IL-10 and TNF cytokines (Table S1 ). This observation correlates well with the higher degree of sequence conservation between bats and human/mouse for intracellular molecules (Table 1) . It is worth to note that although the transcription factors Foxp3 and ROR\u03b3 t, expressed by CD4 + T regulatory cells (Treg) and CD4 + Th17 cells respectively in human and mice, were also highly conserved in P. alecto, identification of cross-reactive antibodies against these molecules was unsuccessful. Importantly, an antibody targeting the cytoplasmic domain of human CD3 molecule, which has also been reported to be highly cross-reactive with CD3 from other mammals (Table S1) , cross-reacted with its bat counterpart, thus allowing identification of the T cell population in P. alecto. However, since human/mouse antibodies failed to detect the major lymphocyte surface markers CD4 and CD8 from bat lymphocytes, a strategy based on the expression of transcription factors was adopted to further characterize the T cell subsets. Human and mouse T cell subsets express different transcription factors upon differentiation into effector cells [24] [25] [26] . As such, Gata3 has been reported to be the master regulator driving the development of the CD4 + Th2 subset, whereas the CD4 + Th1 subset expresses predominantly Tbet. As for the CD8 + T cell population, co-expression of Tbet and Eomes was described, although Tbet is expressed at an earlier stage than Eomes during the development into effector cells and gets down-regulated later during memory formation 27, 28 . Based on the assumption that similar T cell subsets with similar expression pattern of transcription factors exist in bats, we devised the following flow cytometry strategy. Total bat splenocytes were first gated on live single cells, excluding doublets (Fig. 1a) . The total lymphocyte population was further defined by its forward and side laser light scatter properties (Fig. 1a) . Using cross-reactive anti-CD3 antibody, the CD3 + lymphocyte population was then identified and selected (Fig. 1b) . This cell population stained negative for IgG and CD11b, specific markers for B cells and myeloid cells, respectively, further supporting that these CD3 + cells are very likely T lymphocytes ( Fig. S1a-c) . Tbet, Eomes and Gata3-specific staining of the CD3 + population indicated a prominent (58%) Tbet + Eomes + double positive population in this particular bat spleen, which may correspond to CD8 + effector T cells (Fig. 1b) . Tbet + Eomes \u2212 (that could represent the CD4 + Th1 cell population or early activated CD8 + T cells) and Tbet \u2212 Gata3 + population (CD4 + Th2 cells) were also readily detected although the percentages of both cell populations were relatively low compared to the Tbet + Eomes + CD3 + lymphocytes (Fig. 1b) .",

Since CD4 and CD8 antibody staining failed, PrimeFlow technology was employed, which uses Flow-FISH that allows detection by flow cytometry of specific genes expression at the mRNA level. Thus, simultaneous and combined detection by flow cytometry of protein (using antibodies) and mRNA (using Flow-FISH) at a single cell level is possible 33 . Here, bat splenocytes were stained with anti-CD3, anti-Eomes, anti-Tbet and anti-Gata3 antibodies followed by in situ hybridization specific to CD4 and CD8 mRNA. Results indicated that 34% and 25% of the CD3 + cells were CD8 mRNA + and CD4 mRNA + respectively (Fig. 2 ). The fact that these percentages added up to 60% only of the total CD3 + population suggests lower sensitivity of flow-FISH assay compared to antibody staining. In addition, since the specificity and sensitivity for each target mRNA vary from one probe to another; direct quantitative comparison of different cell populations identified by Flow-FISH may be biased. However, it is possible to analyze sub-populations within a specific cell subset identified by Flow-FISH. Here, the combined Flow-FISH and antibody detection approach reveals that majority (75%) of the CD3 + CD8 mRNA + cells co-expressed Tbet and Eomes, and only about 1% expressed Gata3 (Fig. 2b ). This result thus validates our FACS strategy based on the differential expression of Eomes, Tbet and Gata3 to identify the CD8 + T cell population. In addition, comparable percentages of CD4 mRNA + and CD8 mRNA + cells that were Tbet + Eomes \u2212 were observed (13.4 and 10.6%, respectively). This observation thus supports that bat CD3 + Tbet + Eomes \u2212 cells are likely to represent the CD4 + Th1 subset as well as early activated CD8 + T cells. Among the CD4 mRNA + cells, another 12% expressed Gata3 (which could be CD4 + Th2 cells), and 13% co-expressed Tbet and Eomes. However, the greatest majority of CD4 mRNA + cells were Tbet \u2212 Gata3 \u2212 Eomes \u2212 triple negative, which could represent na\u00efve CD4 + T cells or other subsets that could not be identified due to the lack of cross-reactive antibodies.",

Together, the data revealed differential expression patterns of the transcription factors Tbet, Eomes and Gata3 in various organs, suggesting a differential representation and/or activation status of T cell subsets in these organs (Fig. 3) . Predominance of Tbet + Eomes + double positive cells (largely representing the CD8+ T cell population) was confirmed in the spleen from the 4 bats examined (Fig. 3a) . In sharp contrast, the T cell subsets from the bone marrow comprises of ~70% Tbet + single positive T cells (assumed to be CD4 + Th1 cells) and ~30% Tbet + Eomes + double positive T cells (CD8 + T cells) (Fig. 3b) . The predominant populations in the MLNs were Tbet \u2212 Eomes \u2212 Gata3 \u2212 cells (assumed to be CD4 + T cells) and Eomes + single positive T cells, which have been described as memory CD8 + T cells in other mammals 34 (Fig. 3c ). In PBMCs, Tbet \u2212 Eomes \u2212 Gata3 \u2212 triple negative as well as Gata3 + single positive T cells (both subsets assumed to be CD4 + T cells) dominated (Fig. 3d) . Together, the data suggest a predominance of CD8 + T cells in the bat spleen, whereas bone marrow and PBMCs display majority of CD4 + T cells and MLNs harbor similar proportions of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Furthermore, interestingly, whereas the percentage (50%) of CD3 + T cells among the total leukocytes in bats PBMCs and MLNs is similar to that found in mice at steady state, it reaches 60% in the spleen, which is twice the percentage found in mice (Fig. 3e) . Even more strikingly, we found that over 30% of the total leukocytes present in bats bone marrow are CD3 + T cells, which is far greater than the percentage described in human and mouse bone marrow which typically ranges between 4% and 8% 35 . This finding suggests that in bats the bone marrow may play a major role in T cell hematopoiesis in contrast to other mammals where the thymus usually fulfills this function; this hypothesis is consistent with the fact that we were unable to find the thymus in these wild caught bats.",

Cross-reactive anti-human TNF and anti-human IL-10 antibodies, as well as anti-bat IFN-\u03b3 antibody were used to detect by flow cytometry the production of these cytokines. In addition, Flow-FISH was used to detect the production at the mRNA level of IL-2 (T cell growth factor), granzyme B and perforin (cytolytic molecules mainly produced by CD8 + T cells and NK cells 10, 37, 38 ), IL-17A and IL-22 (inflammatory cytokines produced by Th17 cells) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2 ) (an immunosuppressive cytokine associated with Treg as well as Th17 differentiation 39, 40 ) .

            "text": "A number of interesting observations were made and pave the way towards a better understanding of the possible immune mechanisms and strategies evolved by bats to control and tolerate viruses that in humans cause high mortality rate. Firstly, our data revealed a different proportion of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells depending on the organ/tissue examined. In spleen, CD8 + T cells were predominant over the CD4 + T cell subsets. In the lymph nodes, a similar proportion of Eomes \u2212 Tbet \u2212 Gata3 \u2212 (CD4 + T cells) and T cells expressing Eomes only (which represents a CD8 memory phenotype in humans and mice) was observed. Instead, Gata3-expressing T cells were predominant in PBMCs suggesting that CD4 + T cells outnumber CD8 + T cells in the blood. Similarly, the bone marrow contained Tbet + single positive cells (CD4 + Th1 cells) and Tbet + Eomes + double positive cells (CD8 + T cells) in a 2 to 1 ratio. Surprisingly, over 30% of leukocytes present in the bats bone marrow are T lymphocytes, a significantly greater percentage than that described in human and mouse bone marrow which ranges between 4% and 8%. Furthermore, the CD4 + to CD8 + T cell ratio in human and mouse bone marrow is reported to be 1 to 2 35 , as opposed to the 2:1 ratio found in bats. This unique T cell profile may suggest that the bat bone marrow assumes the function of the thymus in providing support for T cell development. Alternatively, on-going infection, inflammation and/or autoimmunity could explain the high number of CD4 + T cells in the bone marrow of these wild caught bats [47] [48] [49] [50] . Likewise, predominance of CD8 + T cells in the spleen from these animals may indicate the presence of viruses in this organ or may represent the immune steady state of the bat spleen, specifically geared towards fighting viral infections. Interestingly, when total splenocytes from these bats were incubated with whole dengue virus (DENV) or peptides derived from various viruses including DENV, Nipah and rabies virus, no significant cytokine production and/or cell proliferation could be measured (data not shown). This result indicates (a) Splenocytes from two different bats were stimulated with ConA (red) or media (grey) for 5 days in the presence or absence of mouse recombinant IL-2 (mIL-2). Cells were gated on CD3 + . (b) Allogeneic Mixed Lymphocyte Reaction (MLR), \"stimulator cells\" (prepared form one bat spleen) were treated with Mitomycin C and were then co-cultured for 5 days with Cell Trace Violet-labeled \"responder cells\" (prepared from another bat spleen) (red) or were cultured alone in media (grey). Graphs shown represent cells gated on CD3 + cells. This experiment was repeated twice independently. that these bats have not been exposed to these viruses before, and may favor the hypothesis that at steady state, bats secondary lymhoid organs such as the spleen have a higher proportion of CD8 + T cells than other mammals. Further investigation in bats bred under specific pathogen free conditions in which an immune steady state or baseline can be established would be required to address these hypotheses.",

The fact that most of the bat B cells examined are IgG + thus suggests that these cells are antigen-primed B cells that have undergone somatic hypermutation of their B cell receptor. This finding is not very surprising and likely reflects that these wild-caught bats have been exposed to antigens from various pathogens and other sources. Further characterization of bat B cells includes assessing the ability of these cells to present antigens and to respond to specific stimulation such as TLR agonists or anti-Ig antibodies, and their ability to secrete antibodies.",

Single cell suspension from spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, bone marrow or blood (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs) were stained with Fixable Viability Dye e780 (eBioscience) for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C, then 10% FBS was added and cells were incubated for another 10 min. For staining of surface markers, the cells were incubated first with primary antibodies (Table S2) including anti-mouse I-A/I-E MHC class II (clone 2G9, BD), polyclonal anti-bat IgG (Novus Biologicals, NB7237), anti-mouse CD11b (clone M1/70, eBioscience) and anti-mouse CD44 (clone IM7, BD) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. This was followed by incubation with fluorescently labeled anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (ThermoFisher) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. For staining of intracellular proteins (including transcription factors and cytokines), the cells were first fixed and permeabilized using the Fix/Perm Foxp3-staining kit (eBioscience) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. Staining was performed at room temperature in the dark with the following antibodies anti-CD3 (clone CD3-12, Abcam), anti-mouse Eomes (clone Dan11mag), anti-human/mouse Tbet (clone 4B10), and anti-human/mouse Gata3 (clone TWAJ) antibodies (Table S2 ). All antibodies were purchased from eBioscience unless otherwise stated. Samples were analyzed using LSR Fortessa X-20 (BD) and Flowjo software.",
