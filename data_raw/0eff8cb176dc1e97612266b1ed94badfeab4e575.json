            "text": "In order for a virus to persist, there must be a balance between viral replication and immune clearance. It is commonly believed that adaptive immunity drives clearance of viral infections and, thus, dysfunction or viral evasion of adaptive immunity is required for a virus to persist. Type I interferons (IFNs) play pleiotropic roles in the antiviral response, including through innate control of viral replication. Murine norovirus (MNoV) replicates in dendritic cells (DCs) and type I IFN signaling in DCs is important for early control of MNoV replication. We show here that the non-persistent MNoV strain CW3 persists systemically when CD11c positive DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. Persistence in this setting is associated with increased early viral titers, maintenance of DC numbers, increased expression of DC activation markers and an increase in CD8 T cell and antibody responses. Furthermore, CD8 T cell function is maintained during the persistent phase of infection and adaptive immune cells from persistently infected mice are functional when transferred to Rag1 -/recipients. Finally, increased early replication and persistence are also observed in mixed bone marrow chimeras where only half of the CD11c positive DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. These findings demonstrate that increased early viral replication due to a cellintrinsic innate immune deficiency is sufficient for persistence and a functional adaptive immune response is not sufficient for viral clearance.",

            "text": "In vertebrates, innate immunity provides early control of viral infection and initiates adaptive immunity. It is generally thought that a virus must either avoid or evade an adaptive immune response to persist within a vertebrate host. The role of innate immunity in preventing viral persistence, apart from its role in initiating an adaptive response, is not completely understood. Type I interferon (IFN) is a cytokine with pleiotropic roles in the antiviral response, including innate control of viral replication. Murine norovirus (MNoV) replicates in cells of the innate immune system, including dendritic cells (DCs), and IFN signaling in DCs is important for early control of MNoV replication. We found here that MNoV persists when DCs are unable to respond to type I IFN. MNoV persistence is correlated with increased adaptive immune responses, likely reflective of increased early viral replication. MNoV also persists in chimeric mice with a 50% mix of wildtype and type I IFN receptor deficient DCs, consistent with a cell-intrinsic role for IFN responses in preventing MNoV persistence. These findings demonstrate that an innate immune deficiency can result in viral persistence apart from its role in generating an adaptive immune response.",

Therefore, continuously replicating viral infections represent scenarios of an ineffective immune response or immune tolerance. Mechanistic studies of persistently replicating viral infections including lymphocytic choriomenengitis virus (LCMV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) mouse models have provided numerous insights into immune mechanisms of viral persistence [1] [2] [3] [4] . In general, study of these and other models have focused on adaptive immune tolerance or the loss of adaptive immune function in determining viral persistence [5] [6] [7] [8] .

Human NoV and the closely related murine NoV (MNoV) also establish persistent asymptomatic infection, which may contribute to spread and population-level persistence in between outbreaks [9] [10] [11] [12] . Study of MNoV strains that differ in persistence has begun to identify viral and host correlates of persistent infection. MNoV strain CW3 is cleared whereas strain CR6 persists in wild type mice [10, 13] . We recently discovered that persistent intestinal CR6 infection is cleared by IFN-\u03bb-stimulated innate responses with no requirement for an adaptive immune response [14, 15] . IFN-\u03bb is closely related to type I IFN, but with more specialized roles at epithelial surfaces [16] .

We found that type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) expression on dendritic cells (DCs) was necessary for CW3 clearance. The adaptive immune response generated in mice with IFNAR deficient DCs was of increased magnitude, commensurate with the increased early viral replication, and the functional capacity of adaptive immune cells was maintained during persistent infection.

Viral genome copies were dramatically increased in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice four days after inoculation in systemic and intestinal tissues as well as in the stool (Fig 2A) . The greatest differences in genome copy number on day four were in the spleen (15,000-fold), liver (4,000-fold) and MLN (2,000-fold). CW3 was cleared from all tissues in control mice by 14 days after inoculation. The high titers of CW3 in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice were partly controlled between day 4 and day 14, with reductions in viral genomes between 8-400 fold (Fig 2A) . However, persistence of viral genomes was observed in the spleen, liver and MLN of CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice for at least 35 days (Fig 2A) . CW3 was only sporadically detected in the ileum and colon of CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice after day 21 and was undetectable in the stool of CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice after day 14 (Fig 2A) . Thus, CW3 persistence in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/was primarily localized to systemic rather than intestinal tissues. Similarly, CW3 persisted in the spleen and MLN but not in the colon of Irf3x7 -/mice ( Fig 2B) . These data are consistent with a primary role of the type I IFN response in DCs broadly limiting early viral replication and preventing viral persistence in systemic tissues.",

Therefore, we tested whether the increased viral replication in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice correlated with changes in DC number or activation. Three days after inoculation, the number of DCs in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice was unchanged relative to na\u00efve mice or cre-negative littermate controls ( Fig 4A) . Furthermore, DCs in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice exhibited increased cell surface expression of MHCI (K b ), MHCII, and costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86 compared to littermate controls ( Fig 4B) . These data demonstrate that type I IFN signaling on DCs is not necessary for their maturation in this context.

Indeed, when we stained NK cells from the spleen three days after inoculation with CW3, expression of CD11c was similar and expression of IFNAR1 was modestly reduced in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice. We further assessed NK cell numbers and expression of the surface markers KLRG1, CD62L, and Ly6C to determine if NK cell recruitment or differentiation was altered by the reduced IFNAR1 expression. NK cell numbers were unchanged (S1A Fig) ; NK cell expression of KLRG1 and Ly6C was not changed and expression of CD62L was modestly increased in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice (S1B Fig). These data suggest that a modest reduction in IFNAR1 expression on NK cells does not alter their recruitment or substantially change their activation following CW3 infection. CW3 persistence in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/is associated with enhanced humoral immunity Antibody responses are important for keeping persistent viral infections in check [20] , making loss of humoral immunity in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice a potential basis for viral persistence. To assess the humoral immune response to CW3 in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice, we measured the antibody response to viral particles or the NS1 protein by ELISA. Titers of serum antibodies to both viral particles and the viral protein NS1 were significantly higher (3-and 70-fold respectively) in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice compared to littermate controls ( Fig 5A) . To determine if the increased antibody titers resulted in enhanced neutralization of viral particles, we performed a serum neutralization assay. Serum from CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice was more effective at neutralization of PFUs than serum from littermate controls at the 10 \u22122 dilution ( Fig 5B) . Together, these data demonstrate that there is increased seroconversion and virus neutralization in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice. Thus, persistence of CW3 in these mice is not correlated with defective humoral immunity, and instead the humoral immune response in persistently infected CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice is enhanced.",

Therefore, we stained T cells for expression of IFNAR1 to determine if it was altered in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice. T cells from CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice had 25% less IFNAR1 in uninfected mice and 50% less IFNAR1 expression 8 days post-inoculation with CW3 ( Fig 6A) . Thus, expression of IFNAR1 is modestly reduced on T cells in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice and may impact their activation in response to virally-induced IFN. Prior work identified the immunodominant CD8 T cell epitope for CW3 [21] , which we used to assess the cellular immune response in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice. At the peak of T cell expansion eight days after inoculation, we observed an increased proportion of CW3-specific CD8 T cells in spleens (1.4-fold), MLNs (3-fold), and Peyer's patches (2-fold) of CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice compared to cre-negative littermate controls ( Fig 6B) . Likewise, a greater proportion of CD8 T cells in spleens of CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice responded by expressing IFN\u03b3 (1.7-fold), TNF\u03b1 (1.3-fold), or the degranulation marker CD107a (1.3-fold) following peptide restimulation ex vivo ( Fig 6C) . Among cells that responded to peptide restimulation in vitro, there was no significant difference in number of simultaneous functions (IFN\u03b3 production, TNF\u03b1 production, or degranulation) per cell ( Fig 6E) . To determine if there were increased T cell cytokine responses in vivo we quantified transcripts for IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and Granzyme B from spleens of mice 8 days after inoculation with CW3. There were increased transcripts for IFN\u03b3 and Granzyme B, while TNF\u03b1 transcripts were unchanged ( Fig 6D) . Together, these data indicate that, although there is a decrease in T cell IFNAR1 expression, persistence of CW3 in CD11c-Ifnar -/mice is not correlated with a defect in CD8 T cell expansion or functionality. In fact, there was an increased expansion of equally functional CD8 T cells in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice.",

Furthermore, there was no difference in the number of simultaneous functions per cell following peptide restimulation ( Fig 7D) . We also analyzed cell surface expression of the following proteins: 1. PD-1, which is upregulated transiently after activation and sustained on exhausted T cells; 2.

CD11c-Ifnar1 -/or littermate control mice were infected with CW3; 21 days later, splenocytes were isolated and transferred into persistently infected Rag1 -/mice. Six days after splenocyte transfer, genomes were detected by qPCR in spleens and ileums from Rag1 -/and viral titers were determined mice by plaque assay. Splenocytes from either CD11c-Ifnar1 -/or littermate control donors were similarly able to clear PFUs from the spleen and ileum (Fig 6A) . Likewise, splenocytes from either donor were similarly able to reduce viral genomes in spleen (10-fold) and ileum (10-fold) ( Fig 6B) . These data demonstrate that the adaptive immune response in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice, including both CD4 and CD8 T cells, is functional in an Ifnar1-sufficient environment in vivo and suggest that increased viral replication in Ifnar1-deficient cells is sufficient for establishing persistent viral replication despite a functional adaptive immune response.",

Prior studies utilizing the LCMV model causally link diminished CD8 T cell functionality to viral persistence [6] and other studies have demonstrate a role for type I IFN in regulating this process [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Furthermore, antigen abundance has been positively correlated with the degree of CD8 T cell dysfunction [5, 30] . The MNoV persistence demonstrated herein contrasts with this paradigm as it was not associated with failure to generate an adaptive immune response or loss of adaptive immune function. In fact, there is an enhanced adaptive immune response commensurate with increased viral replication, and this enhanced adaptive immune response is sustained during persistent infection. These data demonstrate that an innate immune defect in type I IFN can result in viral persistence without attendant effects on the adaptive arm of the immune system. These results provide a different view of viral persistence than prior work in the LCMV model. However, it is important to note that antigen abundance may be lower in the MNoV model relative to the LCMV model. Additionally, the importance of type I IFN in protecting against lethal infection differs between CW3 and LCMV [17, 25] , providing a potential basis for differing roles of type I IFN in these two models.",

The relatively greater effect of IFNAR in myeloid cells rather than intestinal epithelial cells is likely due to the preferential replication of CW3 in myeloid cells and/or low IFNAR expression on intestinal epithelial cells [32] .

            "text": "An additional conclusion from these data is that viral titer is not always positively correlated with adaptive immune dysfunction. In the LCMV model, increased viral titer and associated antigen levels are predictive of T cell clonal deletion or loss of T cell function [5] . Unlike the LCMV model, persistent infection of CW3 in CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice is not correlated with loss of CD8 T cell numbers or function. Instead, increased viral titers are balanced by a commensurate increase in CD8 T cell expansion and antibody production: wild type mice have intact innate control and a relatively lower level of CD8 T cell expansion and antibody production; Ifnar1 -/mice represent an unbalanced scenario with uncontrolled early viral replication resulting in death prior to development of an adaptive response; CD11c-Ifnar1 -/mice represent a 'sweet spot' where increased viral growth is controlled but not cleared by an enhanced adaptive immune response resulting a persistent balance between viral replication and clearance ( Fig  10) . This model is simplistic and does not consider other components of the innate immune response, but represents a rationale for viral persistence in the presence of an enhanced adaptive immune response.",

            "text": "The implication of this model is that the primary mechanistic basis for certain persistent infections could be manipulation of IFN, or other innate antiviral responses. Likewise, these data imply that some persistent infections could be treated by modulating innate immunity, particularly type I IFN, rather than targeting adaptive immune responses. Indeed, both of these principles are manifest in persistent HCV infection in humans. The HCV NS3/4A protease inhibits the induction of IFN by cleaving MAVS [33] . Prior to the recent development of small molecule inhibitors of HCV replication, the most effective therapy for persistent HCV infection included IFN treatment. So, successful treatment for HCV serves to circumvent the viral inhibition of IFN induction. Thus, HCV may be an example of a medically relevant persistent viral infection that persists due, in part, to loss of innate immune function. Persistence of other continuously replicating RNA viruses, such as chikungunya, measles, polyomavirus, may be similarly due to ineffective innate responses.",

Model for the relationship between IFNAR signaling, viral replication, the adaptive immune response, and persistence. The contribution of the adaptive immune response depends on the level of type I IFN deficiency. When the type I IFN response is intact, innate immunity is relatively effective at control of MNoV and a small magnitude of adaptive immune response is sufficient to clear the infection. When a susceptible cell type (i.e. DCs) lacks the ability to respond to type I IFN, MNoV replication is increased, a larger magnitude of adaptive immune response is elicited, and infection is controlled but not cleared. When type I IFN signaling is completely absent, MNoV replication is at a maximum and the host succumbs to infection prior to generation of a protective adaptive immune response. Quantitative RT-PCR Tissues were dissected and flash frozen. RNA from tissues was isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies) and DNA was removed using the DNAfree kit (Life Technologies). RNA from stool was isolated using ZR Viral RNA kit (Zymoresearch). RNA was reverse transcribed using ImPromII reverse transcriptase system (Promega).

The contribution of the adaptive immune response depends on the level of type I IFN deficiency. When the type I IFN response is intact, innate immunity is relatively effective at control of MNoV and a small magnitude of adaptive immune response is sufficient to clear the infection. When a susceptible cell type (i.e. DCs) lacks the ability to respond to type I IFN, MNoV replication is increased, a larger magnitude of adaptive immune response is elicited, and infection is controlled but not cleared. When type I IFN signaling is completely absent, MNoV replication is at a maximum and the host succumbs to infection prior to generation of a protective adaptive immune response.",
