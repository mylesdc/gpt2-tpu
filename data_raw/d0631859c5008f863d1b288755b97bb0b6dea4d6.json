            "text": "In this study, we developed a single leg knee joint assistance robot. Commonly used exoskeletons have a left-right pair, but when only one leg of the wearer is uncomfortable, it is effective to wear the exoskeleton on only the uncomfortable leg. The designed exoskeleton uses a lightweight material and uses a wire-driven actuator, which reduces the weight of the driving section that is attached on the knee directly. Therefore, proposed exoskeleton reduces the force of inertia that the wearer experiences. In addition, the lower frame length of the exoskeleton can be changed to align with the complex movement of the knee. Furthermore, the length between the knee center of rotation and the ankle (LBKA) is measured by using this structure, and the LBKA values are used as the data for intention detection. These value helps to detect the intention because it changes faster than a motor encoder value. A neural network was trained using the motor encoder values, and LBKA values. Neural network detects the intention of three motions (stair ascending, stair descending, and walking), Training results showed that intention detection was good in various environments.",

The planar parallel robot possesses three degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enable self-alignment [9] . However, the disadvantage of these studies was that the volume of the actuator was large. There are the exoskeletons that have a prismatic degree of freedom to self-align with the complex movements of the knee [10] [11] [12] . Due to this structure, the exoskeleton does not limit the wearer's range of motion moreover there is no need to enlarge the volume of actuator. The difference between [10] [11] [12] and the exoskeleton suggested in this paper is that the proposed exoskeleton has the structure which measures the change of the center of rotation. Though the change of the center of rotation is measured in [12] , they use the displacement sensor which is attached on the tibia model. However, the proposed exoskeleton in this paper can be equipped to actual wearer because the sensor is attached inside the exoskeleton. In this paper, the movement of the center of rotation was measured and used to detect intention. As a result, the intention is detected by using the data obtained by only one leg.",

There are other exoskeletons such as the Berkeley lower extremity exoskeleton (BLEEX) and the MIT exoskeleton [5] , which were designed to help healthy people carry heavy objects. However, the above exoskeletons have many actuators, and the size of the exoskeleton is large. As a result, modular exoskeletons have been developed. Modular exoskeletons do not support the entire lower body but only support some joints. In this study, a knee modular exoskeleton is developed. Using an exoskeleton on the knee is difficult because it has a complicated structure [6] . When the wearer wears the exoskeleton, it restricts knee movement because of the complicated movements of the knee joint. Therefore, numerous studies have attempted to design an exoskeleton that aligns with the complex knee movements. Schmidt coupling has been used to accommodate the",

Weight reduction is important because the driving section is directly attached to the wearer's leg. Therefore, an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer (ABS) resin, which is light and has high impact resistance, is used as the main material. However, if the exoskeleton were designed using only ABS, it would not have enough strength to withstand repeated forces. To solve this problem, the ABS resin parts are designed by inserting an aluminum frame to strengthen the structure. By placing the heavy parts in the torque output section and using lightweight materials, the overall weight of the driving section does not exceed 800 grams. Figure 3 shows an exploded diagram of the driving section. The upper frame is bound to the thigh and upper knee to prevent the exoskeleton from sagging and to decide the rotation axis of the exoskeleton. The outer housing of the Bowden cable is fixed in the upper frame, and the tension of the Bowden cable is adjusted by changing the length of the outer housing. The motors have high gear ratios, so they do not have back-drivability. Therefore, wearers feel a load when they try to walk with the exoskeleton.

However, if the exoskeleton were designed using only ABS, it would not have enough strength to withstand repeated forces. To solve this problem, the ABS resin parts are designed by inserting an aluminum frame to strengthen the structure.

The knee joint is rotated by moving the elliptical femur bone on the plane of the tibia bone. During movement, the point where the tibia and femur meet is translated back and forth.

For this purpose, the ankle part freely rotates along the lower frame pipe and moves prismatically and the linear bushing eliminates the friction between the lower frame pipe and the ankle part. The change of the LBKA depends on the knee movement. Therefore, it can be used to estimate the user's intention.

The ankle part rotates freely along the lower frame pipe, but the sliding variable The change of the LBKA depends on the knee movement. Therefore, it can be used to estimate the user's intention. To measure the change of the LBKA, a sliding variable resister is installed in the lower frame pipe. The ankle part rotates freely along the lower frame pipe, but the sliding variable resister can only move prismatically. Therefore, when the sliding variable resister is directly fixed to the ankle part, sliding movement friction of the sliding variable resister increases because of rotation of the ankle part. As a result, change of the LBKA cannot be measured properly. To prevent this, the prismatic part is connected to the sliding variable resister to move prismatically along the lower frame pipe, and the ankle part is free to rotate around the prismatic part. This structure eliminates the sliding friction of the sliding variable resister, thus making it possible to measure change of the LBKA accurately. In addition, while measuring the change of the LBKA, there is an error in the measured value when the ankle strap sags. To prevent sagging of straps, a sag prevention part is attached to a flexible strap in order to make the strap stiff. Figure 6 shows how the self-alignment structure of the exoskeleton works. The left side of Figure shows the straightened knee, and the right side of the figure shows the bent knee. When the wearer straightens the knee, the length of lower frame, l j_s , is as follows:",

The reason is that the length between tibia plane and center of rotation has changed, but exoskeleton's length between the knee and ankle has not changed. As a result, the wearer feels uncomfortable, and the exoskeleton limits the wearer's range of motion. To solve this problem, the length of the margin can be changed because the ankle part is designed to have a prismatic passive DoF. When straightened, the exoskeleton has a length margin of l v_s .

In the wire-driven actuator, because the friction compensator controls the displacement of the spring, the spring moves first and after that the motor compensates the movement of the spring. Because of this, the knee angle measured by the encoder of motor is delayed information. However, the LBKA changes without delay because this changes according to the internal motion of the knee joint. In addition, because the ankle sensor measures the movement of the joints inside, it reflects the intention of the wearer well. Therefore, intention detection is possible with only two sensors of one leg.",

Thus, walking \u2192 stair ascending \u2192 walking combination in Figure 15 and walking \u2192 stair descending \u2192 walking combination in Figure 16 are all combinations in which three states can be mixed. Figures 15 and 16 show that the intention detection is good even when the states are mixed. Figures 17 and 18 are graphs showing that the wearer performs the same motion as Figures 15 and 16 . When training, the neural network was trained by using the data operated in the same period as Figures 15 and 16 , however in Figures 17 and 18 , the wearer operates motion at different periods. Therefore, intention detection could have failed, but as shown in Figures 17 and 18 , the intention detection performed well. Figure 19 shows the sensor value when the knee is bent repeatedly in a standing position. This sensor data pattern is similar to sensor values when the wearer operates other motion, so intention detection could have failed. However, this graph shows that wrong intentions are not detected when similar sensor patterns are measured. These graphs show that the intention is detected well in many difficult cases.",

The exoskeleton is efficient because the wearer can wear it only on the leg in which the wearer needs assistance. In addition, by using a wire driven actuator, a heavy motor is installed on torque output section to reduce the load due to inertia force. The actuator was back-drivable using the friction compensation algorithm, resulting in a maximum measured load of 0.33 N. A simple self-alignment structure was applied and the change of LBKA value is measured by self-alignment structure. Experimental results show that the measured LBKA value reflects the movement of the wearer's knee joint well and is measured without delay unlike the encoder of a motor. Therefore, the intention can be detected only by the sensor of one leg. As a result of testing the training intention detection algorithm for the wearer's various motions, it was confirmed that the intention detection works well in all cases when different motions are mixed, period is different, and input pattern is similar.",
