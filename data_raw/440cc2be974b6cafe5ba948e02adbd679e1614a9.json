Increasing SFTSV infection has raised serious concerns in East Asia 2 . The reported fatality of SFTSV infection, ranging from 10 to 30%, is significantly higher than that of the hemorrhagic fever caused by Hantavirus in the same area 3, 4 . Although the virus is mainly transmitted by tick bites, human-human transmission has been reported 5, 6 . No effective therapies or vaccines are available yet, and the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis are poorly understood. Although previous studies revealed that the impairment of innate immune response as well as inflammatory cytokine storm played important roles in the disease progress 7, 8 , our knowledge of virus-specific humoral response to SFTSV infection and its roles in the pathogenesis is extremely limited.",

Previous studies revealed that dendritic cell (DC)-restricted antigen presentation alone could initiate the Tfh cell program but could not complete ultimate effector differentiation 10 . However, the cooperation of MHC-II-positive DCs and B cells could realize the optimal effect in Tfh and germinal center (GC) B-cell differentiation in response to viral infection 11 . Tfh, along with follicular DCs, repeatedly undergo intimate interactions with the antigen-experienced B cells in GC to facilitate the B-cell expansion, differentiation and affinity maturation of plasmablast and memory B cells for the generation of high affinity antibodies 12, 13 . Therefore, Tfh, mainly residing at the GC of lymph node (LN) and spleen (SP) 13 , play the pivotal role in the production of pathogen-specific class-switched neutralizing antibodies. A number of earlier studies demonstrated that peripheral Tfh (pTfh) cells exhibited transcriptional and phenotypic similarities to lymphoid Tfh cells 9, 14 . We, therefore, investigated the regulatory status of Tfh in the peripheral blood of SFTS patients.",

In the current study of a patients' cohort, we examined the dynamic nature of serologic response, modulation of B-cell subsets, myeloid DCs (mDCs) and pTfh cells, as well as several related regulatory cytokines, to elucidate the status of B-cell dependent immune response and its roles in the pathogenesis of this virulent viral infection.",

To investigate if the defective antibody responses were associated with viremia, serum viral loads were determined at the corresponding time points. The quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the serum viral loads of all survived patients gradually decreased during acute phase of SFTS, and became undetectable within 7-12 days after symptom onset (Fig. 2a) . Strikingly, all deceased patients maintained continuously high levels of viremia from symptom onset until they succumbed to the disease. The viral loads of the deceased group were significantly higher than the survived group in the 3-week period post symptom onset (p < 0.005). The mean log 10 values of the viral load in the deceased patients were 7.5, 8.2 and 8.0 for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks, respectively, as compared with 5.3, 1.9 and 0 in the survived patients (Fig. 2a) . NP-IgG titers had strong association with serum viral load as shown by correlation analysis of the dynamic data of 10 survived and 5 deceased patients (Fig. 2b) , suggesting that virus-specific IgG exerted crucial effect in viral clearance. However, the correlation between NP-IgM titers with the viral load was not significant (Fig. 2b) . In order to confirm the role of virus-specific antibodies in the clearance of virus, we further investigated the neutralization activity of Gnspecific antiserum from an immunized camel, and sera from a convalescent patient and a deceased patient (Fig. 2c) . The results showed that the sera of both Gn-immunized camel and the convalescent patient effectively neutralized SFTSV, with 50% FRNT value at 0.118 \u00b1 0.001 and 0.009 \u00b1 0.002, respectively.

B-cell subsets were defined phenotypically as reported 19, 20 : naive (CD19 + IgD + CD27 \u2212 ), memory (MB, CD19 + IgD \u2212 CD27 + ), plasmablast (PB, CD19 + IgD \u2212 CD27 high ), marginal zone-like B cells (MZ, CD19 + IgD + CD27 + ), and double-negative B cells (CD19 + IgD \u2212 CD27 \u2212 ). The composition of total B cells in acute phase of SFTS was presented in Fig. 3b . We and others had previously reported that disease outcome did not impact on the numbers of patient's leukocytes and lymphocytes 8, 21 . The regulation of the proportion and numbers of each B-cell subset also exhibited high consistency. The proportion of naive B cells within total peripheral B cells of the deceased and the survived groups was significantly lower than that of the healthy control in the 3-week period post symptom onset (Fig. 3c) . Interestingly, the mean weekly frequency of the naive B cells in the deceased group dramatically reduced to only 6.8, 5.7, and 5.2 in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks, respectively, in contrast to 25.4, 23.3, and 21.6 in the survived group.

It is interesting that a large fraction of IgM \u2212 IgG \u2212 PBs in PBMCs was observed in the deceased patients, representing 71.2, 54.6, and 65.2 of the total PBs in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd weeks, respectively, as compared with only 31.3, 31.1, and 30.6% in the survived group ( Supplementary Fig. 3g ). Considering that PBs could secret other immunoglobulin isotypes besides IgG and IgM 27 , we further measured IgA and IgD expression in these PBs ( Fig. 4c -d) and found that only low levels of IgD + and IgA + fractions were detected in the PBs and they showed no significant difference between the two patient groups. Taken together, we conclude that a relatively large fraction of CD27 + CD38 + B-cell subset in the deceased patients didn't secret IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgA isotypes.",

The result showed that the expression of all three genes in PBs was significantly down-modulated in the deceased group ( Fig. 4e-f ). To further illustrate the functional regulation of ASC in SFTS patients, we performed an Elispot assay, which captures virus-specific IgG after cell stimulation in vitro using samples from three patients, representing different temporal phases and clinical outcomes. R848, an TLR agonist, was used as the non-specific stimulator 28 . The samples of two survived patients, P28 and P29, were collected at the early and later phases of acute SFTSV infection, respectively. The sample of patient P30 was collected one day before death. PB of two survived patients, but not of the deceased patient, produced Gn-specific IgG (Fig. 4g) . Moreover, the stimulation with the combination of R848 and Gn protein produced more specific IgG secretion than with only R848 in the survived patients.",

By comparison with the healthy control, the proportion of Robust pTfh differentiation emerged in survived patients. To understand the roles of Tfh in the B-cell immunity against SFTSV, we defined the pTfh phenotypically as CD3 + CD4 + ICOS + CXCR5 + PD-1 + [9] and gated them on PBMCs as shown in panel D (Fig. 5a) . We analyzed IL-21 expression in pTfh after in vitro stimulation with Leukocyte Activation Cocktail by FACS and RT-PCR. The number of pTfh in the survived, but not the deceased patients showed robust increase in the 1st week, as compared with that in the healthy control (Fig. 5b, right panel) , and then gradually decreased in the following two weeks to the baseline (Fig. 5b) , suggesting that pTfh expansion in the early stage of acute SFTVS infection is associated with the recovery of the disease. Moreover, the expression of ICOS, a surface molecule for Tfh migration to GC [29] [30] [31] , showed no significant difference among three groups (Fig. 5c, left panel) . However, PD-1 expression on pTfh in the deceased patients maintained a significantly higher level than that in both the survived patients and the healthy control (Fig. 5c, right  panel) . The expression of ICOS, PD-1 and IL-21 by individual patients as measured by FACS was shown in Supplementary Fig. 6 . FACS analysis of IL-21 expression in pTfh of selected SFTS patients (6 deceased and 12 survived) demonstrated that the proportion of IL-21 + pTfh was significantly higher in the survived patients than that in the deceased patients in the 1st and 2nd weeks post symptom onset (Fig. 5d, left panel) . In addition, RT-PCR analysis also showed that the relative gene expression of IL-21 in the sorted pTfh of the survived patients was significantly higher than that of the deceased patients (Fig. 5d, right panel) . To further explore the influence of pTfh on B-cell maturation, we performed a CD4 + B-cell helper assay by placing the pTfh sorted from SFTS patients in co-culture with autologous naive B cells, and assessed proliferation and CD38/ IgM expression by FACS (Fig. 5e) . Although both CD38 and IgM expression showed no significant differences in B cells between the survived or deceased patients, the greater proliferation of naive B cells was still observed when co-cultured with autologous pTfh from the survived individuals (Fig. 5f) . Collectively, these data indicated the impairment of Tfh in promoting B-cell immunity during fatal SFTSV infection.",

The expression of co-stimulatory molecule CD86 on mDCs from the 2nd week and the proportion of CD80 + CD86 + /mDCs in the 3rd week of the survived patients were significantly higher than that of the deceased patients, as the expression of CD80 showed no meaningful difference between both patients' groups (Fig. 6g, h) . These data suggest that the differential activation of mDCs in the survived and the deceased ARTICLE patients was mainly due to the expression of CD86, which may impact on their antigen presentation function. In order to further evaluate the antigen-presentation function of mDCs during SFTS virus infection, we isolated mDCs from peripheral blood of healthy donors and performed allogenic DC/T-cell co-culture and stimulation assay using in vitro infection model [35] [36] [37] (Fig. 6i, j) . When mDCs were infected with SFTS virus, the proliferation rate of T cells as measured by CFSE tagging and the level of IFN-\u03b3 in the supernatant were significantly lower than that of the mock infection, demonstrating that mDC activation of T cells could be inhibited by SFTS virus infection.",

The absence of antibody response to SFTSV in fatal cases also illustrates that current serologic tests alone are insufficient for the diagnosis of the SFTSV infection, particularly in the severe cases. Neutralization assay confirmed the deficiency of functional humoral response in the fatal SFTSV infection, and implicated the potential roles of Gn-specific antibody in infection control.

However, phenotypic analysis of PBs by two different gating strategies showed a consistent but unique phenomenon that PBs in the deceased patients proliferated to a larger extent than that in the survived patients, which is apparently in contrast to the weakened production of the virus-specific antibody. The negative intracellular staining of IgG and IgM in PBs and the absence of virus-specific IgG provides compelling evidence on the dysfunctional proliferation of PBs in the fatal SFTS cases. Furthermore, the inhibited expression of BLIMP-1, IRF-4 and XBP-1, critical for the maturation and antibody production of PBs, indicated that the CD27 + CD38 + B subset in fatal SFTSV infection was only phenotypical but not functional PBs. This functional defect of PBs was likely attributable to the inhibition of monocytes and dysregulation of cytokines 48 , which is under further investigation. Class-switch recombination (CSR) is crucial for establishing effective anti-viral immunity, which is mediated by activationinduced cytidine deaminase (AID) in mature B cells [49] [50] [51] . Recently, the molecular mechanisms that control CSR have been elucidated 52, 53 . A study by Pone et al. demonstrated that BCRsignaling synergizes with TLR-signaling to induce AID and immunoglobulin class-switching 52 . Feldman et al. found that the chromosome conformation of constant region (C H ) loci, which served as the target for CSR, was regulated in a cytokine dependent fashion in mature B lymphocytes 53 . Interestingly, in our previous 8 and present studies, we observed that TLR3 signaling pathway and IL-4 secretion were both significantly inhibited in fatal SFTSV infection.",

            "text": "The dynamics of pTfh during acute viral infection in patients hasn't been previously reported, despite limited data on HIV and SIV infections in animal models 12, 13, 54 . We found that the pTfh peaked at the early phase of acute infection in survivors, then rapidly declined as the infection proceeded. This phenomenon can be explained that the antigen-experienced Tfh quickly migrates into the GCs to provide systemic T help for the establishment of the humoral response 55 . Similar phenomenon was observed in SIV-infected Rhesus Macaques, in which an early loss of splenic Tfh resulted in the deficiency of antigen-specific antibody production 12 . Therefore, we suggest that an early expansion of Tfh is critical for humoral response to SFTSV infection and for the control of viral pathogenesis. Although previous study demonstrated that ICOS played critical roles in protective humoral response against Influenza virus 30 , ICOS on pTfh exhibited no significant difference between two SFTS patients' groups, indicating that it is not related to the failure of specific antibody response. However, the expression of PD-1, a crucial inhibitory molecule of T cells, was upregulated and maintained at a high level throughout the entire disease course in the deceased patients. Despite PD-1-mediated CD8 + T-cell exhaustion has been well addressed in chronic infections and cancer 56, 57 , its roles in acute viral infection, especially in the regulation of CD4 + T subsets are poorly understood. A recent study reported that high percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing CTLA-4 and PD-1 were the unique immune signature in fatal Ebola virus infection 29 . Our observation illustrated that the lethal SFTSV infection might share this \"unique\" immune characteristic with Ebola virus infection. Notably, anti-PD-1 immunotherapy has been shown to be effective and safe in controlling persistent HCV infection in chimpanzees 56 . Therefore, PD-1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in lethal SFTSV infection. In our previous study, we found that mDCs were impaired in the fatal cases 8 , consistent with a recent report by Zhang et al. 58 . Since monocytes were reported as the target cells of SFTSV 18,59 , we investigated the apoptotic status of peripheral monocytes of SFTS patients and found that monocytes underwent severe apoptosis and necrosis even at the early stage of the fatal infection. This observation is consistent with our previous work 8 , in which we found that the gene expression of IL-6 and CD40L in the monocytes was markedly inhibited with the development of disease severity. CD40L signaling and IL-6 have been reported to confer the apoptotic resistance to a variety of stress inducers, including virus infection 60 . Moreover, significantly elevated apoptosis rate of mDCs shown by in vitro infection assay confirmed the direct cytopathic effect of SFTSV on mDCs.",

In fact, down-modulation of the co-stimulatory molecules on DCs was also observed in other viral hemorrhagic fever 61, 62 . An in vitro study demonstrated that in HIV infection the frequency of CD86 + mDC approached 100% in all conditions, in contrast to CD80 expression on mDCs that was almost completely inhibited 63 . However, the regulation of these two co-stimulatory molecules in SFTS exhibited an entirely distinct profile. Meanwhile, phenotypic analysis of peripheral B cells demonstrated inhibited expression of both HLA-DR and CD80 on memory and MZ B cells, indirectly indicating the impairment of antigenpresentation function of B cells. After all, because the transcriptional and phenotypic similarities between peripheral and follicular B cells involved in antigen-presenting process are still poorly understood, the profiling of co-stimulatory molecules in the peripheral B cells would only serve as an indirect evidence for this process. Therefore, animal model study should be performed to further elucidate the role of B-cell antigen presentation in the pathogenesis of SFTSV infection in further investigation.",

One is that IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23, all immune-suppressive cytokines, were drastically elevated at the early phase of infection 64, 65 , followed by a subsequent inflammatory cytokine storm leading to the cytokine-mediated organ damages. IL-10 has been shown to suppress GC formation by affecting Tfh cell function, in part by altering the expression of transcription factors BCL-6 and BLIMP-1 66 . Additionally, earlier studies showed that IL-10 down-regulated MHC-II expression and co-stimulatory molecule B7, which is consistent with our observations in the present study 67, 68 . The expression of IL-4 and GM-CSF, both absolutely required for the differentiation and maturation of DCs 15, 16, 69 , was markedly down-modulated in both monocytes and lymphocytes, especially in severe and fatal cases 8 .

We propose that during fatal SFTSV infection (Fig. 9) , large quantity of naive B cells are continuously primed into PB cells by the presence of persistent viremia. However, due to defective mDC maturation resulting from massive monocytic apoptosis and insufficient IL-4 and GM-CSF, the differentiation of naive T cells into Tfhs is impeded. Lack of cognate Tfh and MHCII antigen presentation by mDCs and B cells, the initially primed antigen-experienced PB cells fail to mature and undergo immunoglobulin CSR, which accounts for a complete absence of virus-specific IgG response to NP and Gn, in the deceased patients. The current study also points to the roles of NP-and/or Gn-specific antibody response in the control of viral pathogenesis and shed light to the potential target for vaccine or therapeutic antibody development.",

            "text": "Schematic presentation of the mechanisms in the defective humoral response to SFTSV infection. a In the pre-germinal center (pre-GC) phase, persistent viremia primes large quantity of naive B cells into PBs and causes massive monocytic apoptosis, resulting in impaired mDC differentiation, accompanied by the downregulation of TLR3, IL-4 and GM-CSF. Due to insufficient MHC-II antigen presentation by mDCs and B cells, the differentiation and function of Tfh are inhibited, characterized by the decreased numbers and downregulation of IL-21 secretion. Additionally, the expression of PD-1 on Tfh, which act as an important inhibitory molecule of T-cell function, was observed to be persistently upregulated in deceased patients. The expression of three key transcriptional factors, BLIMP-1, IRF-4 and XBP-1, was down-modulated due to the lack of Tfh stimulation. PBs failed to differentiate into non-GC plasma cells and were unable to secret IgM antibodies. b In the GC phase, Ag-experienced B cells interact with cognate Tfh and mDC. However, the B-cell maturation is impaired due to the dysfunction of cognate Tfh and mDC, which, together with the downregulation of TLRs and IL-4, inhibited the induction of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), resulting in the complete inhibition of immunoglobulin class-switch in the deceased patients.

All antibodies and reagents used in flow cytometry analysis were purchased from BD Biosciences, USA, and the antibodies were grouped into six panels for the phenotypic analysis of B cells (A, B), PB and MB cells (C, D), mDC (E) and Tfh (F), respectively. Red blood cells were removed by lysing in Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer. Antibody combination in each panel was as follow: Panel A (CD3-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD19-FITC, CD27-APC, IgD-PE, HLA-DR-PE-Cy7, CD80-APC-H7), Panel B (CD19-FITC, CD27-APC, IgD-PE, IgM-PE-Cy7, IgG-APC-Cy7, CD21-PerCP-Cy5.5), Panel C (CD3-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD19-FITC, CD27-APC, CD38-PE-Cy7, IgG-APC-Cy7, IgM-PE), Panel D (CD3-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD19-FITC, CD27-APC, CD38-PE-Cy7, IgA-APC-Vio770, IgD-PE), Panel E (CD14/B220-APC-Cy7, CD11c-PE, CD123-APC, HLA-DR-PE-Cy7, CD80-FITC, CD86-PerCP-Cy5.5) and Panel F (CD3-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD4-APC-Cy7, ICOS-AlexaFluor647, CXCR5-BB515, PD-1-PE-Cy7, IL-21-PE). Intracellular staining of IgG, IgM and IL-21 was performed at room temperature for 30 min following cell fixation and permeabilization with FIX/PERM buffer. Immune phenotyping was carried out on a 6-laser Aria II (BD Biosciences, USA) Multiparametric flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using FlowJo version 9.2 (TreeStar, USA).",
