IB affects chickens of all ages, causing respiratory, reproductive, and renal manifestations [1] . Although control of IBV infection is primarily achieved through live attenuated vaccines, the infection is difficult to contain because immunization with different serotypes of the virus do not necessarily cross-protect against other serotypes [2] . Within an infected poultry flock, quick and accurate detection of the presence of the virus is imperative to properly vaccinate uninfected flocks. In addition, rapid differentiation of IBV infection from other upper respiratory tract diseases (e.g., avian influenza, Newcastle disease, infectious laryngotracheitis, avian mycoplasmosis) is important so that appropriate measures can be taken in a timely manner [3] .",

Virus isolation has been considered to be the reference standard. However, such isolations are expensive and time consuming because several passages may be required to detect the virus. Immunoassays use IBV-specific monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus in direct or indirect fluorescent antibody and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) formats. Although faster and simpler than virus isolation, immunoassays tend to lack specificity and sensitivity. None of these immunoassays detect all strains or types of IBV [11] [12] [13] . Molecular assays, such as reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), for the detection of IBV are commonly used because highly specific and sensitive results can be obtained in a timely manner. Molecular assays detect viral RNA directly from a clinical sample or from virus isolated in a laboratory host system. When RT-PCR is used to amplify the spike glycoprotein (S) of IBV, the assay can be coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis or nucleic acid sequencing to identify serotypes of the virus [2, 10, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . More recently, many fluorescent probe-based real-time RT-PCR assays have been developed to detect IBV strains [2, 3, 9, 10, 15, 17] . Real-time TaqMan RT-PCR assays have been developed that amplify a fragment of the 5\u2032 untranslated region of the IBV genome to detect turkey coronaviruses and IBV [17] or that target the N gene for IBV detection [9] .",

IBV N gene amplification with SYBR green I real-time RT-PCR detected all the IBV strains assessed, whereas only 28 of 34 clinical swabs tested were positive for IBV by conventional RT-PCR. The increased sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR compared to conventional RT-PCR might be due to detection of the fluorescent signal emitted by specific amplification products [24] . Therefore, the SYBR green I real-time RT-PCR assay developed here using Moroccan field cases could be an important tool for the screening of samples during IB-suspected cases as the assay is rapid, simple, efficient, highly specific, and sensitive.",

These samples were identified during routine diagnostic efforts and stemmed from 34 commercial broiler chickens with clinical signs indicative of IB, including coughing, sneezing, rales, and nasal discharge. All samples had been confirmed to be IBV-positive by virus isolation, but serotypes were not determined. For this study, all samples were tested by SYBR green-I-based real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR. The swabs were suspended in 300 \u00b5l of phosphate-buffered saline, To avoid cross contamination and sample carryover, pre-and post-PCR sample processing were performed in separate rooms. Plugged pipette tips were used to transfer all fluids to eliminate aerosols. Amplified cDNA products were detected by melting curve analysis that consisted of 95 \u00b0C for 5 s and 65 \u00b0C for 60 s, and heated to 97 \u00b0C to measure continuous changes in fluorescence of SYBR green I. Following amplification, a melting curve analysis was performed with the Light Cycler instrument's software (software release 1.5.0, version 1.5.0.39) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Negative template control (diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water) and positive template controls (i.e., NDV, IBDV, FLUAV) were included with each PCR run. Each strain used was tested in triplicate.",

RNA extraction IBV RNA and negative control RNA (NDV [183.6 ng/\u00b5l], IBDV [67.5 ng/\u00b5l], FLUAV [92.1 ng/\u00b5l]) were extracted from 140 \u00b5l of supernatant from allantoic fluid using the QIAamp Viral RNA or RNeasy Mini Kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each RNA fraction was eluted in 50 \u00b5l of RNase-free water.SYBR green-I-based real time RT PCR SYBR green I-based real time RT-PCR was performed using a primer pair consisting of (a) downstream primer, AIBV-fr, targeting N gene nucleotide positions 811-832 (5'-ATGCTCAACCTTGTCCCTAGCA-3\u2032); and (b) upstream primer, AIBV-as, targeting N gene nucleotide positions 921-941 (5\u2032-TCAA-ACTGCGGATCA-TC ACGT-3\u2032, TIB Molbiol, Berlin, DE) as previously described by Meir et al. [9]. To minimize primer-dimer formation, primer set concentration and thermocycling conditions were both optimized (data not shown). PCRs were performed on a Light Cycler (Roche Diagnostics Ltd. Rotkreuz, CH). Each reaction was carried out using 5 \u00b5l of purified RNA and 20 \u00b5l of a reaction mixture, containing 0.5 \u00b5l of RT (50 U) (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA), 0.5 \u00b5l of RNase inhibitor (20 U), 0.5 \u00b5l of MgCl 2 (50 mM), 2 \u00b5l of FastStart DNA Master Mix SYBR green I (containing Taq DNA polymerase, SYBR green I, deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix [Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA]), and 0.5 \u00b5l of the two primers (final concentration of each primer is 10 \u00b5M) and enough nuclease-free water (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for a final volume of 20 \u00b5L for each reaction. The thermal profile consisted of 10 min of reverse transcription at 50 \u00b0C, 10 min of hot-start enzyme activation at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 45 cycles of PCR at 95 \u00b0C for 10 s (denaturation), 58 \u00b0C for 20 s (annealing), and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s (elongation).",
