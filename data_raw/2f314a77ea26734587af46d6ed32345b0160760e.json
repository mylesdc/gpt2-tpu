Therefore, we undertook to investigate changes in the lipid metabolism and survival rate, using 3D4/31 macrophages and Dudleya brittonii which has been used as a traditional asthma treatment. Methods: 3D4/31 macrophages were used as the in vitro porcine alveolar macrophages model. The cells were activated by exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Dudleya brittonii extraction was performed with distilled water. For evaluating the cell survival rate, we performed the water-soluble tetrazolium salt cell viability assay and growth curve analysis. To confirm cell death, cell cycle and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using flow cytometric analysis by applying fluorescence dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide. Furthermore, we also evaluated cellular lipid accumulation with oil red O staining, and fatty acid synthesis related genes expression levels using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with SYBR green dye. Glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle related gene expression levels were measured using qPCR after exposure to Dudleya brittonii extract (DB) for 12 h.",

However, recent studies on M2-like macrophages such as AMs report that lipid metabolism plays an important role in macrophage differentiation and activation of the M2 form. Two basic lipid metabolisms (fatty acid synthesis [FAS] and fatty acid oxidation [FAO] ) are known to work centrally [9] . The FAS pathway can be summarized as follows: carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA), and the production of palmitic acid (most basic fatty acids found in mammals) from malonyl-CoA or acetyl-CoA by fatty acid synthase (FASN) [10] . Using these or externally absorbed lipids, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is produced through the FAO and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The FAO pathway functions by converting fatty-acyl-CoA to acyl-CoA by the action of carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), subsequent to betaoxidation in the mitochondrial matrix by several enzymes include acetyl-CoA acyltransferase (ACAA), and finally production of acetyl-CoA by \u03b2-oxidation, and involvement in the TCA-cycle for generating ATP [11] .",

Since the research on the medical efficacy of plants has been continuously carried out and most of the plants have been studied, there is a growing demand for new plant species that have not been studied previously. The succulent plant, represented by aloe, is inhabited in unique environments such as desert, tropical regions, and coasts with high salinity, and has undergone relatively less research than other plant species [17] . Never-theless, a small number of succulent plants, such as aloe and prickly pear, have been successfully used for commercial purposes because of their proven efficacy in immunity [18, 19] . For this study, we selected Dudleya brittonii (D. brittonii) from several succulent plant species by collecting various information about respiratory immunity. D. brittonii, also called giant chalk dudleya, is a succulent plant mainly found in California and Mexico, and is widely used for ornamental purposes [20] . Due to a dearth of biological studies on D. brittonii, the effect on cells or animals is yet to be elucidated. Interestingly, according to the University of San Diego, Kumeyaay, a native American in California, used D. brittonii for treating asthma, an inflammatory airway obstruction disease closely associated with macrophages. Therefore, in this study, we attempt to verify the survival and metabolic efficacy of D. brittonii extract (DB) in AMs.",

We therefore examined the effect of DB on the cell cycle of macrophages treated with/ without PMA; cell cycle and cell death were evaluated by PI staining and flow-cytometric analysis. We observed that DB does not induce any significant change in the cell cycle either by applying single treatment or co-treatment with PMA, in 3D4/31 macrophages. However, the dead cells population was increased 2-fold as compared to the vehicle when DB was cotreated with PMA; furthermore, exposure to DB also reduces the number of dead cells as compared to the vehicle only treated cells (Figure 2A, 2B; p<0 .05). These results demonstrate that DB reduces the cell death in activated macrophages, and provides evidence of enhanced cell survival effect after DB exposure. We simultaneously confirmed the effects of DB on ROS production (12 h after treatment with DB and/ or PMA). DCFDA, a plasma membrane permeable molecule and sensitive indicator of ROS, was applied for the investigation. We observed intracellular reduction of ROS levels (20.93%\u00b12.89%) in 3D4/31 macrophages after treatment with DB, as compared to vehicle treatment and PMA treatment (25.08%\u00b112.41% increase after PMA treatment). Furthermore, DB-PMA co-treatment reduced the ROS level by 23.43%\u00b1 8.54% as compared to PMA treatment ( Figure 2C, 2D ; p< 0.05). Taken together, these results indicate that the PMA induced 3D4/31 macrophage activation induces ROS production, and DB has an antioxidant effect on both non-activated and PMA-activated 3D4/31 macrophages. Activated M1 macrophage ROS plays an important role in phagocytosis, but excessive ROS production induces inflammation and apoptosis by activating pro-inflammatory signaling such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and nuclear factor \u03ba-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells [26] . However, M2-like AMs do not require excessive ROS production to www.ajas.info exert their functions, thus activating the antioxidant system even further to lower the ROS level. Therefore, we believe that the antioxidant effect of DB on 3D4/31 macrophages will have a positive effect on the function and lifespan of M2type AMs.",

However, there are few studies reporting the changes in lipid production of porcine AMs. In this study, we confirm that PMA and DB upregulate the FAS pathway of porcine AMs, and increase lipid accumulation. Therefore, our results indicate that PMA induced activation is accompanied by lipid accumulation of porcine lung macrophages. In addition, since FAS plays a key role in phagocytic differentiation in monocytes [28] (a macrophage precursor cell), it is expected that administration of DB does not adversely affect the anti-bacterial function even if lipid production is upregulated in porcine CMs. Figure 4A , 4B, and 4C, respectively; p<0.05). This result suggests that DB induces an M2-like metabolic change in 3D4/31 macrophages that are not yet activated. However, the expression levels of gly-colysis, FAO, and TCA cycle genes were not significantly changed when 3D4/31 macrophages were activated by PMA treatment for 12 h; only a small number of gene expressions (ACACA, CTS) were increased, as compared to the vehicle. Finally, co-treatment with PMA and DB resulted in enhanced reduction in the expression of glycolysis genes (GLUT1, HK2, HK3, PFKP, PFKL, PKLR, PKM), and increase in the expres- In addition, the specific expression of anaerobic glycolysis genes (L-lactate dehydrogenase A-like 6B-like isoform [LDHAL6B], lactate dehydrogenase A [LDHA]) was confirmed to be increased after DB treatment alone or co-treat ment with PMA. Also, an unusual expression of the anaerobic glycolysis genes (LDHAL6B, LDHA) was observed in the case of DB single-treatment or co-treatment with PMA. M2like macrophages such as AMs use FAO as an important factor for differentiation [29] ; thus, up-regulation of FAO by DB is expected to positively affect the M2-like differentiation without inhibiting activity and function of 3D4/31 macrophages.",

Therefore, it is very important to keep the existing alveolar macrophage population healthy. Activation of AMs due to respiratory infections is a major threat to the AM population that exists from the time of birth; thus, the survival rate-enhancing efficacy of DB on activated AMs can be helpful for maintaining the respiratory health. AMs function even under normal conditions, even if there is no infection. Most functions of CMs are focused on the phagocytosis of the pathogen, but tissue-specific macrophages play an important role in maintaining homeostasis by removing apoptotic cells or cellular debris. Especially, AMs are closely related to inflammation and various diseases of the respiratory system. Pneumonia, Pasteurella multocida, foot-and-mouth disease virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Streptococcus suis, Haemo philus parasuis, etc., cause great losses in the entire farmhouse because of their high infectivity [31] [32] [33] . Therefore, the survival rate enhancement effect of DB on AMs may help to prevent respiratory infectious diseases by improving the respiratory immunity of livestock. In addition, pneumonia is mainly caused by infections such as bacteria and viruses. In pigs, pneumonia easily caused by Mycoplasma pneumonia, Pasteurella multocida, etc., or complications [34] . Pig pneumonia has a high infection rate and spreads easily on the farms, which inhibit the porcine survival and growth, so proper treatment and prevention are important, but there is no proper treatment or prevention other than antibiotics. However, since the use of feed additive antibiotics is prohibited, a method of improving immunity to prevent pneumonia has been attempted. Since AMs play an important role in the control of pneumonia through anti-inflammatory and phagocytic actions, DB may be useful for the prevention of swine pneumonia [35, 36] .",

However, their use has been banned in most countries due to environmental pollution and residue of animal products [37] . As a result, due to the precise correlation between steroid (or antibiotics) and infectious diseases, the repercussion has been an increase in the incidence of diseases in livestock. Hence, the demand for newer methods has increased and is newly developed to replace steroid (or antibiotics) [38] . Currently, steroids can be used for the recovery from bacterial infections or lung diseases, but they have no direct effect on the removal of infections and have been reported to only play a role in helping recovery [39, 40] . In this study, we observed increased survival rate of AMs with SRC3 expression, which is a steroid sensor. It has previously been reported that steroid treatment prevents livestock diseases, and lung infections are improved by steroid sensor stimulation such as SRC3 of AMs.",

            "text": "This study confirms that DB upregulates the FAS, FAO, and TCA cycle genes, as well as SRC3 mRNA expression and cell survival rate in 3D4/31 AMs. However, the reason for the increase in LDHA and the decrease in WST-1 cell viability due to DB treatment is difficult to explain. These irregular results are expected to be induced by anaerobic glycolysis [41] or antioxidant effect. WST-1 assay is based on the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase (M-DHase) [42] , M-DHase carries out energy production through oxidative phosphorylation on mitochondria, which is the largest part of intracellular ROS production [43] . Therefore, if the antioxidant activity of DB is accompanied by the inhibition of M-DHase activity, it is expected that similar results can be obtained as a decrease of viability with the decrease of ROS. In addition, further research in respiratory immunity using small animals such as a mouse needs to be performed in vivo, before practical application to livestock. Despite these limitations, this study confirms a new mechanism for the association of lipid metabolism and survival enhancement in the porcine AMs, and suggests that administering DB could potentially improve the survival rate of AMs. This study provides new insights and directions for further research in the immunity of the porcine respiratory system based on AMs and natural materials.",
