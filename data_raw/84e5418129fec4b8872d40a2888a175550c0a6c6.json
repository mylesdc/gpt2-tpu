The mass accuracy was better than 5 ppm. Samples were dissolved in 200 \u00b5L of the water/MeCN/HCOOH (50:50:0.1, v/v/v) mixture. Analyte solution was infused at a flow rate of 3 \u03bcl/min. The instrument parameters were as follows: scan range: 50-1600 m/z; drying gas: nitrogen; flow rate: 4.0 L/min, temperature: 200 \u00baC; potential between the spray needle and the orifice: 4.2 kV.",

The first was recognized the characteristic spin system of Arg (residue 2). Next on the basis of sequential NOE effects two substituted Dap residues linked via peptide bond were assigned (residues 3, 4 and 5 respectively). The chemical shifts of side chain HN protons of Dap (diaminopropionic acid residues) were determined by couplings with HN deriving from the backbone. The chemical shift of HN of ANB-NH2 (residue 1) was established on the basis of the coupling with HN of Arg. Protons of aromatic ring of ANB-NH2 were assigned by the coupling with HN of the same moiety. Residue 6 presence were visible as aromatic protons coupled with amide protons of Dap residue. ",
