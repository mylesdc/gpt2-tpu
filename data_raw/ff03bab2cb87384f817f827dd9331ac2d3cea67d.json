            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly emerging enteric pathogen in swine that causes diarrhea in neonatal piglets and creates an additional economic burden on porcine industries in Asia and North America. In this study, a PDCoV isolate, CHN-SC2015, was isolated from Sichuan Province in southwest China. The isolate was characterized by a cytopathic effect, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. CHN-SC2015 titers in LLC-PK cells ranged from 10 4.31 to 10 8.22 TCID 50 /mL during the first 30 passages. During serial passage, 11 nucleotide mutations occurred in the S gene, resulting in nine amino acid changes. A whole genome sequencing analysis demonstrated that CHN-SC2015 shares 97.5%-99.1% identity with 59 reference strains in GenBank. Furthermore, CHN-SC2015 contained 6-nt deletion and 9-nt insertion in the ORF1ab gene, 3-nt deletion in the S gene and 11-nt deletion in its 3 UTR compared with other reference strains available in GenBank. A phylogenetic analysis showed that CHN-SC2015 is more closely related to other PDCoV strains in China than to the strains from Southeast Asia, USA, Japan, and South Korea, indicating the diversity of genetic relationships and regional and epidemic characteristics among these strains. A recombination analysis indicated that CHN-SC2015 experienced recombination events between SHJS/SL/2016 and TT-1115. In vivo infection demonstrated that CHN-SC2015 is highly pathogenic to sucking piglets, causing diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and death. Virus was shed daily in the feces of infected piglets and upon necropsy, was found distributed in the gastrointestinal tract and in multiple organs. CHN-SC2015 is the first systematically characterized strain from southwest China hitherto reported. Our results enrich the body of information on the epidemiology, pathogenicity and molecular evolution associated with PDCoV.",

We compared CHN-SC2015 with 59 other PDCoV strains available in GenBank and found that the level of nucleotide identities ranged from 97.5% to 99.1%; the number of differences in the nucleotide sequences ranged from 606 to 230 ( Figure 4 , Table 3 ). The sequence alignment of the CHN-SC2015 strain revealed a 3-nt deletion (TAA) in the S gene compared to the US, Japan, South Korea, and Southeastern Asia PDCoV strains. This deletion was also present in a number of other Chinese PDCoV strains, indicating that they may have evolved from a common ancestor ( Figure 5B ). CHN-SC2015 also contained a 6-nt deletion (TATGAA) and a 9-nt insertion (GCCGGTCGG) in the ORF1ab gene compared with the PDCoV strains from Lao Figure 5A ). Additionally, a 11-nt deletion was found in the 3 UTR, not seen in 58 of the other PDCoV strain; PDCoV strain CHN-HG2017 from China also contained this 11-nt deletion ( Figure 5B ). and a 9-nt insertion (GCCGGTCGG) in the ORF1ab gene compared with the PDCoV strains from Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam, and a 3-nt deletion (GTT) compared with HKD/JPN/2016 ( Figure 5A ). Additionally, a 11-nt deletion was found in the 3\u2032UTR, not seen in 58 of the other PDCoV strain; PDCoV strain CHN-HG2017 from China also contained this 11-nt deletion ( Figure 5B ). ",

Several alphacoronaviruses, such as PEDV and TGEV cause diarrhea and vomiting in piglets, leading to enormous economic losses in the swine industry [35, 36] . Swine enteric coronavirus (SeCoV), a recombinant between PEDV and TGEV reported in 2016, also causes diarrhea in swine [37] . Additionally, some novel alphacoronaviruses related to the bat coronavirus HKU2 have recently been reported in China; these viruses, porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) [38] , swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV), [39] and swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) [40] are also major pathogens of diarrheal disease in swine. The deltacoronavirus, PDCoV, also causes diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in nursing piglets, and it is clinically indistinguishable from other enteric diseases caused by these porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus. Moreover, coexistence of pathogens, such as PDCoV and PEDV, PDCoV and PoRV, increase the mortality rate of infected piglets, which incurs massive economic losses to porcine industries [41] . Taken together, the pathogens associated with diarrhea in piglets have attracted much needed attention to the necessity for expanded preventative, diagnostic, and treatment measures.",

From the 10 samples, only the PDCoV strain CHN-SC2015 was successfully isolated. Viral identification was done by RT-PCR/qRT-PCR, IFA, and EM. Sample quality is a crucial factor for the successful isolation of PDCoV. Clinical samples may contain unknown viruses or other pathogens or very low amounts of infectious virus, all making successful isolation difficult [18] . The addition of exogenous trypsin in vitro enhances virus entry into the host cells by proteolytic cleavage of the S protein, which is necessary for coronavirus infection [42] . Therefore, the concentration of trypsin in the LLC-PK cell culture media may contribute to the isolation of PDCoV [43] . In our study, the maintenance medium was supplemented with 7.5 \u00b5g/mL trypsin, which is higher than the concentrations used in the studies that demonstrated the effectiveness of trypsin in in vitro PDCoV infections [44] . In addition, the time at which the sample is actually collected may also contribute to the success of PDCoV isolation.",

A sequence analysis based on the complete genome of the PDCoV strain CHN-SC2015 showed a 3-nt deletion in the S gene; this deletion is found in other Chinese isolates but not in isolates from the USA, Japan, South Korea, or Southeast Asia, suggesting a mechanism for differences in virulence among these PDCoV strains. However, whether this particular deletion contributes to the efficiency of viral replication and/or the virulence of these strains is in question. After passage 30, we found six nucleotide changes in the S gene compared with the original sample CHN-SC2015, which induced corresponding amino acid changes, excluding the synonymous mutations at the position 1443 and 1587. The amino acid mutation at position 162 is a glycosylation site located on the surface of amino-terminal domain within the S protein. The lack of glycosylation at this site may hinder the virus' ability to evade the host's immune response because of the lack of glycan shielding of S protein epitopes [34, 49] . The 11-bp deletion in 3 UTR in this strain was not found in 58 of the reference strains; the exception was PDCoV strain CHN-HG-2017, indicating that CHN-SC2015 may be a novel strain to the province of Sichuan. According to the phylogenetic results, based on the complete genome and S gene, PDCoV CHN-SC2015 falls into a different clade compared with many other PDCoV strains currently circulating in China. This difference indicates that variations, for the most part, existed in other genes of the PDCoV during evolution and transmission [50] . Moreover, CHN-SC2015 belongs to a different clade than PDCoV isolates from Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam.",

            "text": "In recent years, the pathogenicity of PDCoV to piglets has become a focus of investigation [16, 55, 56] . The clinical profile of PDCoV infection, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and death, are indistinguishable from other enteropathogenic porcine coronavirus infections such as PEDV and TGEV [19] . In our study, the pathogenicity of PDCoV strain CHN-SC2015 was demonstrated in five-day-old pigs orally inoculated with 10 6.35 TCID 50 /mL cell-culture-adapted virus. Gastrointestinal tissues from a challenged piglet at 5 dpi showed evident lesions indicating that the intestinal tract is the main site for virus replication. Recent reports have found that PDCoV is transmissible by indirect contact with an infected piglet, indicating that the respiratory tract may be the minor target for PDCoV infection [57] ; Moreover, in our study, we also found that the control piglets had developed mild diarrhea along with PDCoV CHN-SC2015 infection, leading to a low score of diarrhea from 6 DPI, which further supports the notion that PDCoV can transmit via the respiratory tract. This route of infection is also true for PEDV, which can disseminate from the nasal cavity to the intestinal mucosa, providing further evidence for the airborne transmission of gastrointestinal coronaviruses [58] . Analysis of daily fecal samples and post-mortem tissues and organs by qRT-PCR demonstrated that PDCoV RNA continually and gradually increased from 1 to 7 dpi in feces, PDCoV RNA was distributed in multiple tissues and organs, indicating extensive tissue tropism; these results are consistent with other studies [18, 59] .",

The phylogenetic and recombination analyses indicate that CHN-SC2015 is closely related to the other PDCoV strains in China than to the strains from Southeast Asia, USA, Japan, and South Korea. CHN-SC2015 contained deletions and/or insertions in ORF1ab, S, and the 3 UTR compared with the strains available in GenBank. Infection of five-day-old piglets with PDCoV CHN-SC2015 demonstrated its pathogenicity. Our results enrich the body of information on the molecular epidemiology and pathogenic of PDCoV. ",
