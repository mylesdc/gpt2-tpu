CR-III has been linked to polymerase and polyadenylation activity, CR-V to mRNA capping and CR-VI to cap methylation. However, how these activities are choreographed is poorly understood. Here we present the 2.2-\u00c5 X-ray structure and activities of CR-VI \u00fe , a portion of human Metapneumovirus L consisting of CR-VI and the poorly conserved region at its C terminus, the \u00fe domain. The CR-VI domain has a methyltransferase fold, which besides the typical S-adenosylmethionine-binding site ( SAM P) also contains a novel pocket ( NS P) that can accommodate a nucleoside. CR-VI lacks an obvious cap-binding site, and the SAM P-adjoining site holding the nucleotides undergoing methylation ( SUB P) is unusually narrow because of the overhanging \u00fe domain. CR-VI \u00fe sequentially methylates caps at their 2 0 O and N7 positions, and also displays nucleotide triphosphatase activity.",

            "text": "T he Mononegavirales order groups five families of monopartite, negative-strand RNA viruses many of which are highly pathogenic and/or contagious; the Filoviridae (of which Ebola virus is a representative), the Bornaviridae (Borna disease virus), the Nyamiviridae (midway virus), the Rhabdoviridae (rabies, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)) and the Paramyxoviridae (measles virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV)). These viruses encode a large RNA polymerase (L) (usually 42,000 amino acids) that is crucial to viral replication (Fig. 1a) . It has two distinct roles to replicate the RNA genome and to transcribe viral mRNA. As such it not only polymerizes RNA but also synthesizes fully methylated cap structures 1 . Capping involves the co-transcriptional addition of a guanosine (G) to the first nucleotide (N 1 ) of the nascent RNA chain via a 5 0 -5 0 triphosphate bridge, resulting in a GpppN 1 -structure. Typically, this is followed by methylation of nitrogen 7 (N7) of G, giving rise to m GpppN 1 -, and of the 2 0 -oxygen (2 0 O) of the N 1 ribose ( m GpppN 1m -). The cap protects mRNAs against 5 0 -exonucleases and promotes RNA transport and translation, while 2 0 Omethylation prevents detection by cellular-immunity sensors [2] [3] [4] . In Rhabdoviridae, CR-V catalyses cap addition by means of an unconventional polyribonucleotydyl-transferase (PRNTase) reaction where a conserved histidine in CR-V forms a covalent phosphoamide bond with the transcript, resulting in a CR-V-pRNA intermediate. The capped transcript is released after ligation of a Gpp to the pRNA. This mechanism differs from capping in eukaryotes and most other viruses, in which a guanylyltransferase (GTase) forms a phosphoamide bond with Gp, before transferring it to 5 0 ppRNA 2 . Paramyxoviridae also contain a PRNTase signature motif in their CR-V domains, suggesting they use the same capping strategy as Rhabdoviridae.",

CR-VI, moreover, has an unusual b-sheet; it lacks b3, but this is compensated for by the addition, at the other end of the sheet, of a new strand (b0), which glues the start of the N-terminal coil to the main structure. Also unusual is the fragmentation of aZ (resulting in the small z 0 -helix).",

Research into the activities of L and the mechanisms underpinning them has historically been hampered by a complete, order-wide absence of high-resolution structures. To redress this, we set out to study L domains of hMPV, a paramyxovirus of the Pneumovirinae subfamily closely related to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Like RSV, hMPV is highly contagious and causes respiratory tract disease 7 . As a part of this study, we expressed CR-VI \u00fe , a 406-residue fragment comprising CR-VI and the adjoining ' \u00fe domain', the variable region carrying the K-K-G-motif, investigated its MTase activity and solved its crystal structure. Besides sequentially methylating the 2 0 O and N7 atoms of small capped RNAs, CR-VI \u00fe also 2 0 O methylates uncapped substrates and displays nucleotide triphosphatase (NTPase) activity. Both the CR-VI domain, which assumes a fairly standard MTase fold, and the K-K-G motif of the (mainly helical) \u00fe domain are required for the MTase reactions. Combined, the data provide new insights into the modification of the 5 0 -ends of transcripts emerging from the polymerase domain of L. This structural information on a mononegavirus L protein, and the new insights in the capping mechanism it provides, should spur the development of novel antiviral drugs against this important group of highly pathogenic viruses.",

In vitro, CR-VI \u00fe most effectively binds and methylates synthetic RNAs containing the conserved start sequence of hMPV transcripts, preferring a substrate length of nine nucleotides (Fig. 2) . The methylation occurs at the GN7 and N 1 -2 0 O positions (Figs 2 and 3a), with 2 0 O-methylation preceding N7-methylation (Fig. 3a) , an uncommon order of events also occurring in VSV 8 . CR-VI \u00fe , moreover, efficiently methylates uncapped RNAs with 5 0 -phosphate groups (especially pppRNA), primarily at the 2 0 O atom of N1 since almost no 3 H-methyl . Substrate specificity was determined as above, but using various synthetic RNA substrates, and allowing the reactions to proceed for 16 h. Substrates were compared with GpppGGGACAAGU (red and blue panels) and pppGGGACAAGU (green panel), for which the degree of methylation was set at 100% (#, marked bars). The red-shaded panel compares the degree of methylation of nine-nucleotide-long hMPV start sequences with different 5 0 -ends and methylation states (the lighter bars represent uncapped RNAs). The results indicate efficient methylation of RNAs that already carried a (cold) methyl group, either at their N7-guanine or 2 0 O-ribose position (confirming the occurrence of 2 0 O-and N7-methylation, respectively), and of uncapped RNAs (especially pppRNA). The pppRNA substrate is predominantly methylated at N 1 , as substrates that were methylated beforehand at this nucleotide do not undergo substantial additional methylation (green panel). CR-VI \u00fe prefers the hMPV start sequence over the short GpppACCCC sequence, and over RNA-start sequences of Dengue virus and SARS coronavirus, irrespective of their lengths (blue panel). A nine-nucleotide hMPV substrate, however, is much preferred over one with only five nucleotides, indicating that additional interactions take place between the protein and nucleotides 6-9. Consistently a 10-times lower K D (dissociation constant) characterizes the interaction of CR-VI \u00fe with the 9-mer, compared with that with the 5-mer. The K D s, measured in triplicate using a dot-blot assay and listed at the right of the diagram ( \u00b1 s.d.'s), also show that capped and uncapped hMPV sequences are bound with comparable affinities, and that 2 0 O-methylated substrates are preferred over unmethylated ones.",

The crystal structure of CR-VI \u00fe was solved to 2.2 \u00c5 resolution in space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 with two molecules, disulphide-linked at residue C 1877 , in the asymmetric unit, assuming a 'head-to-toe' conformation ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). There are no significant differences between the molecules, which have a slightly twisted, bi-lobed shape, composed of two globular domains, the larger corresponding to CR-VI (residues B1,616-1,883) and the smaller to the \u00fe domain (1,884-2,005; Fig. 1b ). Although composed of only B120 residues in Pneumovirinae, the size of the \u00fe domain varies greatly within the Mononegavirales order, reaching B240 residues in Rhabdoviridae. In hMPV, it consists of six a-helices (a \u00fe 1-6). Helix a \u00fe 6 contains the K-K-G motif ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ) and together with a \u00fe 1 leans over the active cleft of CR-VI. Helix a \u00fe 4, and to a lesser extent helices a \u00fe 1, a \u00fe 5 and a \u00fe 6, packs down on l 1650-1666 , the second half of a long loop (residues 1,635-1,666) that swerves around the CR-VI domain ( Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 3 ; 'l' is used throughout the paper to denote loops). The l 1650-1666 region, which contains a small helix (a-a), acts as a fulcrum allowing the \u00fe domain to pivot relative to the CR-VI domain. Helix a \u00fe 3 varies in length, from 4\u00bd turns (in most crystals) to 6 (in Protein Data Bank (PDB) 4UCY), and the loop between a \u00fe 2 and a \u00fe 3 is always disordered ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).

Mutants are listed against a yellow, green or red background, to indicate that the altered residue belongs to l 1650-1666 , the rest of the CR-VI domain, or the \u00fe domain, respectively. They are also grouped according to whether they change the K-D-K-E tetrad, SAM P, SUB P or NS P. The results highlight the importance of essential SUB P residues (such as the K-K-G lysines K 1991 , K 1992 and K 1995 and l 1650-1666 residues H 1659 and R 1662 ) for both 2 0 O-and N7-methylation. All tetrad residues are crucial for region is further enlarged, as helix a \u00fe 2 completely unfolds and a \u00fe 3 unwinds to 3\u00bd turns. 12 , such as the long N-terminal loop and the position of helix aX. In its active core, however, it better resembles RrmJ-type flavivirus MTases (for example, 3EVF 9 ; Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Most notably, hMPV and flaviviruses share an unusually long (B10 residues), flexible b2 l (that is, the loop immediately following the b2-strand), which forms the SAM-binding pocket ( SAM P) along with loops b1 l and b4 l, shielding it from the solvent (Fig. 1b, c) .",

            "text": "In Wesselsbron (flavi-)virus, b2 l is found in closed or open conformations, either packing up against SAM (PDB: 3ELW) or exposing it to the solvent (3EMB) 13 , changes that may assist SAM uptake and/or SAH expulsion. In CR-VI \u00fe , b2 l similarly assumes alternate conformations (Fig. 4c,d) . In the 'closed' form, the ligand's ribose group is hydrogen bonded to D 1725 , and-via a water-to D 1722. Loops b1 l and b4 l also show a degree of flexibility. b1 l residue E 1697 , conserved in paramyxo-and filoviruses, forms a hydrogen bond with the NH 2 group of SAM and is essential for both MTase activities (Fig. 3b) . However, in the absence of SAM, its side chain either moves into the sub-pocket that normally accommodates the NH 2 group, or, more markedly, turns towards the solvent in the direction of b2 l, which in this case assumes the 'open' position ( Fig. 4d) . b4 l forms a side wall of SAM P, and together with aD and b5 also defines a deep, hydrophobic cavity not present in other MTases, termed NS P (or nucleoside-binding pocket). Although a role for NS P has yet to be determined, the pocket binds the adenosine moiety of SAM or ATP, soaked at high (25 mM) concentrations into CR-VI \u00fe crystals, causing b4 l to impinge onto SAM P (Fig. 4c,d; when SAM is used for soaking, one SAM molecule occupies SAM P, and another binds to NS P). GTP was not observed in NS P, but this may reflect a lower soaking concentration (2.5 mM), due to GTP's poor solubility. With the exception of E 1781 , the amino acids lining NS P are poorly conserved beyond the Pneumovirinae, and mutating key NS P residues barely affects the MTase activities (Fig. 3b) . CR-VI, finally, contains a Zn-finger, which is not conserved beyond the Pneumovirinae subfamily and links the small a-d 0 to the rest of the structure (Fig. 1b) . During the preparation of this manuscript, a 3.8-\u00c5 structure of VSV L, obtained by electron cryo-microscopy, was published 14 . The CR-VI (or MTase) part of VSV resembles that of hMPV, but apparently lacks a deep NS P pocket (PDB: 5a22, Fig. 5 ). The \u00fe domain (C-terminal domain) is more elaborate in VSV than in hMPV, containing extra regions N and C terminal of helix a \u00fe 6. The helix itself, however, appears well conserved, both in length and in position. Although a K-K-G motif is not present in VSV, it does contain an arginine (R 2038 ) strictly conserved among the Rhabdoviridae, which is structurally equivalent to hMPV's K 1995 , the second lysine of K-K-G motif.",

The Zn-finger, however, is not conserved, and a-helices B and Z are not fragmented. Helix aE, an element of the standard MTase topology (Fig. 1c) , is present in VSV (3), as a result of which NS P may have disappeared. aX is at a different location (4), and is preceded by an extra helix (ax 0 (5)). E 1833 , expected to belong to the K-D-K-E tetrad from sequence alignments, is buried in the structure and does not reach the surface of the catalytic pocket (6) , and the position normally taken by the K-D-K-E glutamate is occupied by T 1831 . The \u00fe domain of VSV is tilted, compared with that of hMPV, and more elaborate. Helices a \u00fe 1, a \u00fe 2, a \u00fe 3, a \u00fe 5 and a \u00fe 6 are conserved, but the a \u00fe 1-a \u00fe 2 loop is replaced by an extra helix (a \u00fe 1 0 (7)). a \u00fe 4 is absent, whereas a \u00fe 5 is enlarged and immediately follows a \u00fe 3 (8). The 2-residue loop connecting a \u00fe 5 and a \u00fe 6 in hMPV is replaced by a 34-residue coil carrying a small three-stranded b-sheet (9) . Helix a \u00fe 6 seems best conserved between the two \u00fe domains, although a K-K-G motif is not present in VSV. However, R 2038 , which is strictly conserved in Rhabdoviridae, takes the place of K 1995 ((10) and alignment below). In VSV, the \u00fe domain is extended beyond a \u00fe 6 with a 65-residue, partly helical, but mainly unstructured polypeptide (in grey (11)). Colour scheme and labelling are as in Fig. 1b. (b) . Alignment of a \u00fe 6-helices from Mononegavirales L proteins. K-K-G motif residues are highlighted in red; the arginine replacing the second lysine of the motif in Filoviridae and Rhabdoviridae is highlighted in magenta. Red letters indicate other (less strictly) conserved residues, except for the G that replaces the first lysine of the K-K-G motif in most Rhabdoviridae (blue). particular, the site adjoining SAM P, which holds the nucleotides undergoing methylation, has become a more elaborate, but narrower and possibly therefore, higher-affinity substrate-binding pocket (termed SUB P as it accommodates the nucleotide undergoing methylation). Consistently, electron density is found in SUB P following soaking or co-crystallization with GTP, whereas in other MTases added GTP predominantly shows up in the capbinding pocket. In particular, helix a \u00fe 6 and the \u00fe domainaffiliated l 1650-1666 help shape SUB P through the side chains of K 1991 and K 1995 (of the K-K-G motif), and of H 1659 and R 1662 , respectively (Fig. 4b) . The marked decrease in MTase activity of mutants altered at these residues (Fig. 3b) illustrates the importance of SUB P in correctly presenting the substrate nucleotides to SAM. Nevertheless, the pocket is too spacious for a single nucleotide, and the electron density in SUB P from a number of soaked crystals suggests that bound GTP often assumes more than one orientation. In structures where GTP could be fitted with confidence, the guanosine moiety predominantly interacts with l 1650-1666 residues H 1659 and R 1662 , and with K 1991 and (K-D-K-E residue) K 1673 , which clamp the guanine (Fig. 4b) . Unusually for cap-MTases, K 1673 is not part of aZ, but instead resides on the small z 0 (3 10 )-helix (Fig. 1b,c) . Whether any of the observed positions of GTP reflects in vivo binding of N 1 (as part of a transcript) is unclear; in MTase-RNA complexes (PDB: 1AV6 (ref. 17) , 4N49 (ref. 16) ), N 1 is situated much closer to the K-D-K-E tetrad (Fig. 6a) .",

K-K-G residue K 1995 corresponds to the Gp binding lysine in the signature motif of eukaryotic GTases, but here is in a loop instead of an a-helix ARTICLE Mg \u00fe \u00fe , resulted in radioactive protein bands on denaturing SDS gels, the level of radioactivity was low, and was not diminished by acid treatment before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), implying it is not due to phosphoamide bond formation. A second, strong argument against a GTase-based capping mechanism in hMPV (and in favour of a PRNTase-based one) is the fact that in the closely related RSV the cap is formed by Gpp ligation to pRNA 20 . We observed that CR-VI \u00fe also displays NTPase activity, converting GTP into GDP and ATP into ADP (Fig. 7) . GTPase activity, which is required for PRNTase-based capping, was previously reported in Mononegavirales L (ref. 21 ), but as yet could not be linked to a specific domain within the protein. The reaction observed with CR-VI \u00fe , however, is quite slow, possibly because other parts of L, or other co-factors, are needed for full activity. In line with this, we were not able to identify key activesite residues. Using the mutants listed in Fig. 3b , the greatest reductions in GTPase activity were obtained with E 1697 C (corresponding to the flexible residue at the bottom of SAM P; Fig. 4d ) and S 1669 A (part of SUB P, Fig. 4b) to 54 (\u00b120) and 57 ( \u00b1 16) % of the wild-type activity, respectively (n \u00bc 3). The deletion of the dipeptide G 1645 K 1646 from the long N-terminal loop resulted in a somewhat more pronounced B70% reduction ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). The NTPase activity was confirmed using crystallized CR-VI \u00fe (Fig. 7 ).",

It is unclear from the structure of VSV L how capping, cap methylation and RNA synthesis are coordinated 14 , but an involvement of CR-VI \u00fe in cap addition is consistent with the dynamic nature of the multi-domain polymerases of RNA viruses in general, exemplified by flu where the C-terminal two-thirds of PB2 has been shown to be extremely mobile 22, 23 . The presentation of uncapped (but CR-V-linked) pRNA to CR-VI \u00fe would also explain why hMPV L does not require a high-affinity cap-binding site. The integrity of both the PRNTase and K-K-G motifs, moreover, has been shown to be essential for viable mRNA synthesis in human parainfluenzavirus 2 (hPIV-2) 5 , in line with capping involving a concerted action of CR-V and CR-VI \u00fe . Assuming the transcript is presented to CR-VI \u00fe by the PRNTase, 2 0 O-methylation may actually occur before the cap is added (as a cap is not required for the reaction; Fig. 2b ), which would also be consistent with 2 0 O-methylation preceding N7-methylation. The possibility that 2 0 O-methylation precedes cap addition was also suggested by the ability of virions of the rhabdovirus spring viremia of carp virus to synthesize uncapped, N1-methylated oligonucleotides 24 . We did not observe significant methylation of free GTP by CR-VI \u00fe (levels were o5% of that of GpppGGGAC AAGU methylation), suggesting GN7-methylation takes place after G is added to the RNA. In addition 2 0 O-methylated substrates (GpppG m GGACAAGU and pppG m GGACAAGU) show an B2-fold higher affinity for CR-VI \u00fe , compared with their unmethylated counterparts (Fig. 2b) , which presumably reflects an RNA repositioning mechanism allowing the GN7 atom access to the SAM methyl donor in the second methylation step.",

The controls (GpppG, GpppG m , m GpppG and m GpppG m , from left to right) were obtained with the same substrate, using MTases that specifically methylate caps at the N7 or 2 0 O positions (human N7-and vaccinia virus 2 0 O-MTase). The TLC experiment used 0.65 M LiCl as mobile phase, allowing a clear separation of m GpppG and m GpppG m (top). The caps on the TLC plate were subsequently further resolved, this time using 0.45 M (NH 2 ) 2 SO 4 as mobile phase for a better separation of GpppG and GpppG m (bottom).

Comparison of the RNA-binding sites in vaccinia virus cap-MTase (PDB 1AV6) and CR-VI \u00fe . The vaccinia virus MTase (white surface, left) has a narrow cap-binding pocket (in between the red arrows) and a large, open RNA-binding site (adjoining the SAHcontaining SAM P). In CR-VI \u00fe (coloured surface, middle) the cap-binding pocket is not present, whereas the RNA-binding site is narrowed (into SUB P) by the \u00fe domain overhang (in red). A structural superposition (obtained by aligning the K-D-K-E tetrads, right) shows that the GTP ligand in CR-VI \u00fe is situated at a considerably greater distance from the tetrad than the first transcribed nucleotide (N 1 ) in the vaccinia virus MTase-RNA complex (shown in light pink).
