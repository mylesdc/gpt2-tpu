Here, we investigated the functional mechanisms of PD-1 as related to FH pathogenesis induced by the murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3). High levels of PD-1-positive CD4 + , CD8 + T cells, NK cells and macrophages were observed in liver, spleen, lymph node and thymus tissues following MHV-3 infection. PD-1-deficient mice exhibited significantly higher expression of the effector molecule which initiates fibrinogen deposition, fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), than did their wild-type (WT) littermates. As a result, more severe tissue damage was produced and mortality rates were higher. Fluorescence doublestaining revealed that FGL2 and PD-1 were not co-expressed on the same cells, while quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that higher levels of IFN-c and TNF-a mRNA transcription occurred in PD-1-deficient mice in response to MHV-3 infection. Conversely, in vivo blockade of IFN-c and TNF-a led to efficient inhibition of FGL2 expression, greatly attenuated the development of tissue lesions, and ultimately reduced mortality. Thus, the up-regulation of FGL2 in PD-1-deficient mice was determined to be mediated by IFN-c and TNF-a. Taken together, our results suggest that PD-1 signaling plays an essential role in decreasing the immunopathological damage induced by MHV-3 and that manipulation of this signal might be a useful strategy for FH immunotherapy.",

In inbred laboratory mice, the virus produces strain-dependent disease profiles that depend on the infection route, age, genetic background, and immune status of the host. For example, Balb/c, C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice develop acute fulminant hepatitis, while C3H mice develop a mild chronic disease and mice of the A strain exhibit no evidence of hepatitis [3, 4] . In contrast to the resistant A strain mice, FH induced by MHV-3 in susceptible mice is characterized by the presence of sinusoidal thrombosis and hepatocellular necrosis [2, 3] . These pathological findings occur concomitantly with expression of fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2), a virus-induced procoagulant molecule in the sinusoidal lining cells in the liver. FGL2 has the capacity to promote fibrinogen deposition and subsequently directly induce the coagulation cascades by the expression of procoagulant activity (PCA) [5] . Thus, up-regulation of FGL2 is an essential component of the lethal effects of MHV-3-induced FH.",

For example, PD-1-deficient mice develop more severe hepatocellular injury than their wild-type (WT) littermates in response to adenovirus infection [9] . In a herpes simplex virus (HSV) stromal keratitis mouse model, blockade of PD-1 signaling led to increased HSV-1-specific effector CD4 + T cell expansion, IFN-c production, and exacerbated keratitis [10] . A functionallysignificant high level of PD-1 expression has been found to be maintained by exhausted CD8 + T cells in mice chronically infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), in primates exposed to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and in humans suffering from infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV), or human Tlymphotropic virus (HTLV). However, blockade of the PD-1/PD-Ls pathway efficiently restored the virus-specific effector functions of the exhausted T cells, and lead to substantially reduced in viral load [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] . The PD-1 signal is also known to play a key role in the chronicity of infections with bacteria (Helicobacter pylori and Schistosoma mansoni) [16, 17] , pathogenic fungus (Histoplasma capsulatum) [18] , and parasitic worms (Taenia crassiceps) [19] . It appears that a number of pathogenic microorganisms exploit the PD-1 signal in order to evade host immune responses and to establish persistent infection.",

PD-1-positive cells were observed in tissues from the thymus, spleen, lymph nodes and liver. Cellular expression was localized to the cell membrane and in the cytoplasma while was completely absent from the nuclear compartment. PD-1-positive cells were distributed throughout the medulla and cortex of the thymus and lymph nodes. In the spleen, PD-1-positive cells were restricted to the germinal center under normal conditions, but extended to the red pulp after infection. In infected liver, more PD-1-positive cells were present in the portal and parenchymal areas, as opposed to the relatively low presence of PD-1-positive cells in only the portal area in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treated-mice (Fig. 1A) . The amount of PD-1-positive cells in the different organs of infected and control mice were counted and compared, results showed that the number of positive cells was significantly higher in infected mice (Fig. 1B) . Furthermore, FACS analysis revealed that PD-1 expression was enhanced on multiple subsets of immune cells, including the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, NK1.1 + NK cells and CD68 + macrophages (Fig. 1C) .

Small and discrete foci of necrosis with sparse polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration were observed in liver tissues from PD-1-deficient mice after 24 h of infection. In contrast, WT mice exhibited normal liver architecture at this time point. Slight liver damage became apparent in WT mice after 48 h of infection, meanwhile, the damaged areas of PD-1-deficient mice had enlarged and confluent necrosis had become evident. By 72 h of infection, the damaged region in PD-1-deficient mice had extended throughout the entire liver, while WT mice suffered much less damage and up to 60% of their liver tissue remained normal at this time point ( Fig. 2A) . Likewise, higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were observed in serum from PD-1-deficient mice after 72 h of infection (Fig. 2B ). More interestingly, PD-1-deficient thymus, spleen and lymph node tissues infected with MHV-3 for 72 h exhibited severely disrupted architecture, loss of cellularity, and the presence of substantial amounts of karyorrhectic/apoptotic cell bodies. The histology of these organs from infected WT mice at 72 h was relatively normal (Fig. 2C ). In conjunction with the apparent tissue necrosis, higher levels of cell apoptosis were also evidenced in the organs from PD-1-deficient mice by TUNEL staining (Fig. 2D ). The architecture of other organs, including the heart, kidney and lung was relatively normal and only rare apoptosis events were observed in these tissues after infection (Fig.  S2 ). In all, these results demonstrated that PD-1 deficiency led to enhanced pathological damage by MHV-3 in the liver, spleen, lymph node and thymus, where higher levels of PD-1-positive cells were found after infection.",

Here, we report that MHV-3 infection of program death-1 (PD-1)-deficient mice results in tissue damage throughout multiple organs, including the liver, spleen, thymus and lymph nodes. The liver damage, in particular, occurred earlier and was more severe in PD-1-deficient mice than in their wild type (WT) littermates. Further investigation determined that MHV-3 infection was associated with high levels of IFN-c and TNF-a in the damaged organs of PD-1-deficient mice. Conversely, intraperitoneal injection of a combination of anti-IFN-c and anti-TNF-a blocking mAbs led to inhibition of FGL2 expression, greatly attenuated tissue lesions and reduced mortality. Our results demonstrate that PD-1 signaling controls immunopathological damage following MHV-3 infection, indicating that manipulation of the PD-1 signal might represent a useful strategy for FH immunotherapy.",

In addition, the enhanced fgl2 expression was confirmed by quantitative (q)PCR, results revealed a 2.84-fold and 5.72-fold higher level was present in liver from WT and PD-1-deficient mice, respectively, after 72 h of MHV-3 infection, as compared to their uninfected controls. Moreover, its level in PD-1-deficient liver was 2.01-fold higher than that in the WT group at this time point (Fig. 4B) . Immunohistochemistry was used to show that FGL2-positive cells were present in necrotic liver tissues in PD-1deficient mice at 24 h after MHV-3 injection. The protein expression was found to be enhanced rapidly upon infection, and the highest level occurred at 72 h post-infection. However, occasional FGL2-positive cells were detected in the livers of WT mice at 24 h post-MHV-3 infection and these cells were also present, and slightly enhanced in number, at both the 48 h and 72 h time point (Fig. 4C ).

In spleen, however, the positive cells were only found in the red pulp. Again, the expression of FGL2 appeared to be restricted to the cell membrane and cytoplasma. The distribution of FGL2-positive cells in PD-1-deficient mice had not changed after 72 h of MHV-3 infection, but the number of positive cells in the examined organs was enhanced significantly and the levels of expression were much stronger (Fig. 5A ). In addition, the transcription of fgl2 in the spleen of PD-1-deficient mice was also significantly increased in response to infection (Fig. 5B) . Meanwhile, higher levels of fibrinogen deposition were found in the spleen and lymph node tissues of PD-1-deficient mice (Fig. 5C) . Moreover, the level of FGL2 present in serum, as measured by ELISA, was found to increase rapidly after infection, and the level in PD-1-deficient mice was significantly higher than that in WT littermates (Fig. 5D ). To clarify the source of FGL2, fluorescent dual staining was performed on spleen tissues and results demonstrated that FGL2 was principally associated with CD11c-positive dendritic cells (DCs), CD68-positive macrophages and CD31-positive endothelial cells (Fig. 5E ). All of these results indicated that the absence of PD-1 signaling can result in enhanced FGL2 expression, consequently inducing stronger fibrinogen deposition and more severe tissue necrosis in PD-1deficient mice following MHV-3 infection.",

Most of the evidence for this function, however, comes from models of tolerance or chronic infections [11, 12, 13, 14 15] . Although some studies have indicated that this signal might also participate in regulating acute infections [23, 24, 25, 26] , its functions in this disease condition are much less clear. Here, we used a mouse FH model mediated by MHV-3 infection to describe the effects of PD-1 in this disease process. Firstly, PD-1 was found to be significantly up-regulated on T cells, macrophages and NK cells within the thymus, spleen, lymph nodes and liver in response to MHV-3 infection. To determine the exact role of PD-1 in the pathogenesis of FH, PD-1deficient mice were used to establish an infection model. Interestingly, MHV-3-induced liver damage in PD-1-deficient mice occurred rapidly and the lesion area was much larger than in their WT littermates. We then extended our investigation to the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes, where increased PD-1-positive cells were observed post-infection. Surprisingly, severe tissue necrosis and substantial apoptosis was observed in these organs of PD-1-deficient mice at 72 h after MHV-3 infection. In contrast, these organs from WT mice exhibited relatively normal histology, a finding in agreement with previously reported results [27] . Taken together, these results suggested that PD-1 deficiency promoted expansion of the pathological damage from the liver to the lymph organs, including the spleen, lymph node and thymus in this FH model, thereafter, the absence of PD-1 was associated with higher mortality rates in response to MHV-3 infection.",

            "text": "Murine FH induced by MHV-3 is a recognized and validated model for studying host resistance/susceptibility to human hepatitis virus, and several studies have shown that BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice have an innate susceptibility to the infection [3, 4] . FGL2 has been proposed as a critical mediating factor of lethality in the MHV-3-induced FH mice due to the fact that it has the capacity to induce fibrinogen deposition, which in turn activates the coagulation cascades and induces procoagulant activity [5] . To clarify whether the tissue necrosis we observed in PD-1-deficient mice following infection was also mediated by FGL2, the expression of FGL2 was analyzed. Results showed that the expression of FGL2 was principally associated with CD31-positive endothelial cells, CD68-positive macrophages and CD11c-positive DCs. Surprisingly, significantly higher levels of FGL2 were observed after infection in all of PD-1-deficient organs, including the liver, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and serum than that in those from WT littermates. In addition, increased fibrinogen deposition was observed in the organs of PD-1-deficient mice. Although we currently have no direct data to evidence that FGL2 directly mediates the mortality of our PD-1-deficient mice, data from other researchers have clearly shown that FGL2 promoted mouse mortality in response to MHV-3 infection [5, 28, 29, 30] . Considering this, our results strongly indicate that the mortality of PD-1-deficient mice post-MHV-3 infection is due to the higher level of FGL2 secretion and increased fibrinogen deposition.",

            "text": "Indeed, it has been reported that both FGL2 and PD-1 are expressed on T cells, macrophages, and DCs, and that targeted deletion of fgl2 or PD-1 leads to impaired T cell activity, and these events are related to the development of autoimmune diseases [6, 31, 32] . We here also observed PD-1 expression as being enhanced on T cells (both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells). It was reasonable to propose that the expression of FGL2 may have been directly regulated by PD-1 signals. Unexpectedly, our FGL2/PD-1 dual staining showed that PD-1-positive cells in the liver, thymus, spleen and lymph nodes did not co-express FGL2, indicating that the expression of FGL2 was not directly regulated by PD-1. On the other hand, the expression of FGL2 is believed to be induced by IFN-c and TNF-a [21, 22] , while PD-1 signaling has the capacity to inhibit IFN-c and TNF-a secretion from PD-1-positive immune cells [6] . Therefore, we evaluated and compared the status of IFN-c and TNF-a in both PD-1-deficient and WT mice. Definitively, the transcription of IFN-c and TNF-a genes was rapidly enhanced post-MHV-3 infection in PD-1-deficient mice, as compared to WT controls. In particular, a higher level of IFN-c was observed in NK cells but not in CD3 + T cells of PD-1deficient liver post-MHV-3 infection, indicating that the PD-1 signal can inhibit IFN-c secretion from NK cells under such condition. Conversely, injection of a the combination of anti-IFNc and anti-TNF-a blocking mAbs was able to successfully inhibit fgl2 mRNA transcription and protein expression, resulting in reduced tissue damage and significantly protecting against MHV-3-mediated mortality in these mice. These results demonstrated that up-regulation of FGL2 in PD-1-deficient mice after MHV-3 infection was controlled, at least partially, by IFN-c and TNF-a.",

More interestingly, Levy and colleagues showed that the frequency of FGL2 + Tregs was higher in lymphoid tissues of MHV-3 infected mice, and treatment with FGL2-specific antibodies reversed MHV-3induced liver injury and mortality in vivo. These findings demonstrated that FGL2 is an important effector cytokine of Tregs that contributes to MHV-3-induced FH [30] . PD-1 signaling has also been described as participating in regulation of Treg differentiation and function [33, 34] . In our study, we also analyzed the status of Foxp3 + cells in both PD-1-deficient and WT controls. However, the number of Foxp3-positive cells in the liver, spleen, lymph node or thymus was not significantly different between PD-1-deficient mice and their WT littermates after 72 h of MHV-3 infection (Fig. S3) . Therefore, Foxp3 + cells are unlikely to be involved in the mortality of PD-1-deficient mice. However, the functional status of these Tregs (for example, the level of FGL2 secretion) in PD-1-deficienct mice requires further investigation, and such studies are in progress in our lab.",

Unpaired student's t-test (two-tailed) or the Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison of two groups where appropriate. Kaplan Meier curve with log-rank test (GraphPad Prism 4.03 software) was used to analyze the mortality rate. pvalue ,0.05 was considered as statistically significant. its protein expression in the liver, spleen and lymph node from PD-1-deficient mice after 72 h of MHV-3 infection in the presence of IFN-c and TNF-a mAbs or rat IgG1 isotype control antibodies was detected by qPCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. (C) The IFN-c and TNF-a mAbs treatment resulted in decreased damage to the liver, spleen, lymph node and thymus after 72 h of MHV-3 infection. (D) Reduced FGL2 level by IFN-c and TNF-a mAbs treatment resulted in reduced liver damage (indicated by AST and ALT levels). (E) PD-1-deficient mice were infected with MHV-3 (10 PFU) and simultaneously treated with IFN-c and TNF-a blocking mAbs (n = 4) or rat IgG1 control (n = 6), the survival rate was monitored for a total of 15 days. p = 0.025,0.05 was considered significantly different. One representative of three experiments that yielded similar results is shown. Magnification 6 400. NS: not significantly different. *p,0.05 and **p,0.01. n = 5/group. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1001347.g007 Figure S3 The number of Foxp3-positive cells was not changed significantly in PD-1-deficient mice after MHV-3 infection. Foxp3-positive cells in the liver, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes between PD-1-deficient and WT mice at 72 h after MHV-3 infection were detected by immunofluorescence staining (left). Statistical analysis of the number of Foxp3-positive cells in the indicated organs (right). Blue color indicates nuclear DAPI staining. Scale bar = 20mm. NS: not significantly different.
