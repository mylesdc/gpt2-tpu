Pregnancy-specific VSA (VSAPAM), which include the PfEMP1 variant VAR2CSA, are targets of IgG-mediated protective immunity to PAM. Here, we report an investigation of the specificity of naturally acquired immunity to PAM, using eight human monoclonal IgG1 antibodies that react exclusively with intact CSA-adhering IEs expressing VSAPAM. Four reacted in Western blotting with high-molecularweight (> 200 kDa) proteins, while seven reacted with either the DBL3-X or the DBL5-e domains of VAR2CSA expressed either as Baculovirus constructs or on the surface of transfected Jurkat cells. We used a panel of recombinant antigens representing DBL3-X domains from P. falciparum field isolates to evaluate B-cell epitope diversity among parasite isolates, and identified the binding site of one monoclonal antibody using a chimeric DBL3-X construct. Our findings show that there is a high-frequency memory response to VSA PAM, indicating that VAR2CSA is a primary target of naturally acquired PAM-specific protective immunity, and demonstrate the value of human monoclonal antibodies and conformationally intact recombinant antigens in VSA characterization.",

            "text": "People living in areas of intense transmission of Plasmodium falciparum parasites acquire protective immunity to malaria during childhood, and the bulk of mortality and severe morbidity from P. falciparum malaria is therefore concentrated among young children. Protective immunity acquired in response to P. falciparum exposure appears to be mediated mainly by IgG antibodies specific for variant surface antigens (VSA) that mediate sequestration of infected erythrocytes (IEs) in various tissues (reviewed by Hviid, 2005) . Despite pre-existing protective immunity, women become highly susceptible to P. falciparum infection when they become pregnant, and pregnancyassociated malaria (PAM) is a major cause of mother/ offspring morbidity (Guyatt and Snow, 2001; 2004) . However, in areas of stable P. falciparum transmission, susceptibility to PAM rapidly declines with increasing parity, consistent with acquisition of PAM-specific protective immunity (reviewed by Hviid, 2004) . PAM is caused by P. falciparum-IEs selectively accumulating in the placental intervillous space through VSA PAM-mediated adhesion to chondroitin sulphate A (CSA). VSAPAM differ in several ways from VSA expressed on IEs obtained from males and non-pregnant females. Thus, only VSAPAM mediate binding to CSA in vitro (Fried and Duffy, 1996) and only VSAPAM-expressing IEs are consistently not recognized by IgG in the plasma of P. falciparum-exposed women who have never been pregnant or by IgG in plasma from similarly exposed men (Beeson et al., 1999; Ricke et al., 2000) . These observations, and the fact that plasma levels of VSAPAM-specific IgG increase with increasing parity (Fried et al., 1998; Ricke et al., 2000) , are consistent with evidence that these antibodies are the mediators of protective immunity to PAM (Duffy and Fried, 2003; Staalsoe et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "The molecular identity of VSAPAM remains controversial, although current evidence points to VAR2CSA, an interclonally conserved member of the PfEMP1 molecules encoded by the multigene var family. Thus, transcription of the gene encoding VAR2CSA is increased among CSAadhering and placental isolates, VAR2CSA is exposed on the surface of CSA-adhering IEs (Salanti et al., 2003; 2004; Tuikue Ndam et al., 2005) , and plasma levels of VAR2CSA-specific IgG increase with increasing parity and correlate with protective immunity to PAM (Salanti et al., 2004) . However, the importance of VAR2CSAspecific antibodies relative to antibodies specific for other putative VSA PAM in acquired protective immunity to PAM remains to be established. The clonal analysis of memory B cells represents a powerful tool to dissect the immune response to complex pathogens such as P. falciparum (Lanzavecchia et al., 2006) . In this study, we used an improved Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immortalization method (Traggiai et al., 2004) to analyse memory B cells from multiparous PAM-exposed women. Frequency analysis and isolation of specific monoclonal antibodies identified polymorphic, linear and conformationdependent epitopes in VAR2CSA as dominant targets of the human memory B-cell response to PAM.",

We selected three donors (one parity 2 and two parity 3 women) with high VSAPAM-specific plasma antibody levels and used frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained 1 month post-partum. Memory B cells were immortalized with EBV in the presence of CpG oligonucleotides and allogeneic, irradiated PBMC as described (Traggiai et al., 2004) . A total of 5760 replicate cultures of 100 immortalized B cells per well were set up, and after 3 weeks the culture supernatants were screened for their capacity to stain erythrocytes infected with each of three P. falciparum lines. Two of the lines (FCR3-CSA and NF54-VAR2CSA) had been previously selected in vitro to express VSA PAM, characterized by reactivity with IgG from multiparous women and lack of reactivity with IgG from P. falciparum-exposed men ( Fig. 1) (Fried et al., 1998; Beeson et al., 1999; Ricke et al., 2000) . The third line (3D7-SM) was selected to express non-PAM-type VSA equally recognized by IgG from P. falciparum-exposed men and women ( Fig. 1) Jensen et al., 2004) . Supernatants from 105 of the polyclonal B-cell lines stained one or both of the VSAPAM-expressing lines. The frequency of VSAPAM-reactive polyclonal supernatants varied from 6/1920 [0.3% (95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.7%)] to 33/1344 [2.5% (1.8-3.4%)] in the three donors. These results suggest that the frequency of VSAPAM-specific B cells can be high (at least up to 1 in 4000 memory B cells) in recently pregnant multigravidae. The higher memory B-cell frequencies in the present study compared with earlier reports for PfEMP1 (Dorfman et al., 2005) and total P. falciparum antigens (Fievet et al., 1993; Migot et al., 1995) probably reflect the efficient method of B-cell immortalization employed here.",

Labelling of FCR3-CSA, NF54-VAR2CSA and 3D7-SM by IgG in individual plasma samples from P. falciparum-exposed pregnant women ( ), from sympatric men (\u1b62) and from non-exposed adult control donors (\u1b79) are shown. and growth characteristics. Six of the clones (PAM1.4, PAM2.8, PAM3.10, PAM5.2, PAM6.1, PAM7.5) produced antibodies recognizing antigens on the surface of erythrocytes infected by both the VSAPAM-expressing lines used to screen for antibody specificity (Table 1) . Antibodies from the two remaining clones (PAM4.7 and PAM8.1) only recognized FCR3-CSA. In contrast, none of the monoclonal antibodies recognized the 3D7-SM control line not expressing VSAPAM ( Fig. 2A-C) . Testing of monoclonal antibody reactivity with erythrocytes infected by a panel of additional parasite lines provided further evidence that all were indeed specific for PAM-type VSA expressed on the surface of CSA-adhering IEs (Table 1) . However, the monoclonal antibodies did not all recognize all VSAPAM-expressing lines, probably because the epitopes they recognize are polymorphic. IgG antibodies produced by a control B-cell clone (D7) did not recognize any of the tested parasite lines. Monoclonal antibody recognition patterns for individual parasite lines were tested in parallel, and repeated assessments of recognition patterns yielded consistent results.",

This is consistent with the finding that the var2csa sequence is composed of conserved stretches separated by stretches with substantial interclonal diversity (Duffy et al., 2006a; Trimnell et al., 2006) , and the prediction that B-cell epitopes in VAR2CSA DBL3-X locate mainly to polymorphic, surface-exposed parts of VAR2CSA . We therefore cloned and sequenced 43 VAR2CSA DBL3-X domains from placental parasite isolates. A subset of 29 of these domains selected to represent the overall VAR2CSA DBL3-X diversity was expressed as Baculovirus recombinant proteins and used in ELISA to test the specificity of the three VAR2CSA DBL3-X-specific monoclonals. The PAM2.8 antibody reacted with 25, PAM6.1 with eight and PAM8.1 with 20 of the domain variants (Fig. 4A) . A multiple sequence alignment of all the proteins indicated that the main difference between the PAM8.1-negative and -positive proteins was a C-terminal 16-amino-acid stretch that maps to a polymorphic region of 3D7-VAR2CSA DBL3-X, which is predicted to be a surfaceexposed loop (Fig. 4B) . Residues in this region either were deleted in the PAM8.1-negative proteins or had a different amino acid composition compared with the PAM8.1-positive variants (Fig. 4A) . To substantiate this possibility we constructed a chimeric protein where the 16-amino-acid stretch from a PAM8.1-positive domain variant (FCR3) was transferred to the corresponding site in a PAM8.1-negative variant lacking this sequence (3D7) (Fig. 4A, bottom) . The recombinant proteins corresponding to the unmodified FCR3 sequence and the chimeric construct both tested positive in Western blots probed with PAM8.1, in contrast to the recombinant protein representing the authentic 3D7 sequence (Fig. 4C) , thus confirming the predicted position of the PAM8.1 epitope. It was not possible to predict the exact targets of PAM2.8 and PAM6.1 by multiple alignments of the primary sequences.",

These observations are compatible with recognition by this antibody of a conformational epitope in VAR2CSA, but also with recognition of an unidentified non-VAR2CSA PAM-specific IE surface antigen. To address this question, we tested the ability of PAM1.4 to enrich VSAPAM-expressing IEs in two parasite lines (EJ24 and EJ27) initially expressing non-PAM-type VSA and only marginally recognized by PAM1.4 ( Fig. 5A and B, and data not shown). Although both isolates were originally obtained from the peripheral blood of pregnant women, and thus expected to express VSAPAM, isolates expressing non-PAM VSA -such as EJ24 and EJ27 -are occasionally found (Ofori et al., 2003, and our unpublished data) . Remarkably, a single round of PAM1.4 antibody selection of EJ27 ( Fig. 5C and D) and EJ24 (data not shown) resulted in rapid emergence of IEs uniformly recognized by PAM1.4 and expressing VSAPAM ( Fig. 5C and D). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the isolates showed increases in var2csa transcription in response to the selection for PAM1.4 reactivity (EJ24: twofold and EJ27: 30-fold). In addition, EJ24 acquired reactivity with the VAR2CSAspecific antibodies PAM2.8, PAM3.10, PAM6.1 and PAM7.5 following selection for PAM1.4 reactivity ( Table 1) . EJ27 did not acquire additional reactivity following PAM1.4 selection, probably because of interclonal C.

IE adhesion to CSA, which is thought to be a critical element in the pathogenesis of PAM (Fried and Duffy, 1996) , is mediated by VAR2CSA as documented by recent knockout studies (Viebig et al., 2005; Duffy et al., 2006b) , and several CSA-adhesive domains have been identified in the antigen (Gamain et al., 2005) . Recent studies in mice suggest that vaccination can elicit broadly reactive antibodies that can block VAR2CSAdependent IE adhesion to CSA (Gamain et al., 2004; Bir et al., 2006) , but whether such antibodies are ever produced in humans in response to PAM, how clinically relevant they are, and whether they can be induced by vaccination in humans remain unanswered questions.",

The 3D7 subline 3D7-SM was derived by human plasma antibody selection of 3D7 for expression of non-PAM-type PfEMP1 associated with severe malaria in children as described Jensen et al., 2004) . The VSAPAM-expressing subline 3D7-BeWo was selected by repeated panning of IEs on the choriocarcinoma line BeWo as described elsewhere (Haase et al., 2006) . Parasites were considered as expressing VSAPAM if the level of labelling of intact IEs by IgG in a panel of plasma samples from P. falciparum-exposed multigravid women was significantly higher than the level in plasma from sympatric men (Fig. 1, FCR3 -CSA and NF54-VAR2CSA).

Isolates EJ24 and EJ27 were obtained from the peripheral blood of pregnant, P. falciparum-exposed women and adapted to in vitro culture . Both isolates were selected for expression of VSA reacting with the human VSAPAMspecific monoclonal antibody PAM1.4 (see below), essentially as described , but using Protein A-coated magnetic microbeads, as VSAPAM-expressing IEs are prone to non-specific labelling by second-step antisera (Creasey et al., 2003; Rasti et al., 2006) .",
