Influenza virus conserved peptides have the potential to elicit crossprotective immune response, but without the help of potent adjuvant and delivery system they are poorly immunogenic. Biodegradable polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticle (PLGA-NP) based vaccine delivery system enhances cross-presentation of antigens by the professional antigen presenting cells. In this study, Norovirus P particle containing SwIV M2e (extracellular domain of the matrix protein 2) chimera and highly conserved two each of H1N1 peptides of pandemic 2009 and classical human influenza viruses were entrapped in PLGA-NPs. Influenza antibody-free pigs were vaccinated with PLGA-NPs peptides cocktail vaccine twice with or without an adjuvant, Mycobacterium vaccae whole cell lysate, intranasally as mist. Vaccinated pigs were challenged with a virulent heterologous zoonotic SwIV H1N1, and one week later euthanized and the lung samples were analyzed for the specific immune response and viral load. Clinically, pigs vaccinated with PLGA-NP peptides vaccine had no fever and flu symptoms, and the replicating challenged SwIV was undetectable in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Immunologically, PLGA-NP peptides vaccination (without adjuvant) significantly increased the frequency of antigen-specific IFN\u03b3 secreting CD4 and CD8 T cells response in the lung lymphocytes, despite not boosting the antibody response both at pre-and post-challenge. In summary, our data indicated that nanoparticlemediated delivery of conserved H1N1 influenza peptides induced the virus specific T cell response in the lungs and reduced the challenged heterologous virus load in the airways of pigs.",

Promising new generation flu vaccine platforms include use of highly conserved peptides in a vaccine formulation; because, recent developments in biotechnology tools have made the large scale production of antigenic peptides highly feasible at low cost. Attempts were made to develop IAV peptide vaccine by coexpressing conserved peptides of M protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) with Hepatitis B capsid protein [5] , and also using cocktail of conserved T and B cells peptides [6] . But due to lack of identified effective vaccine delivery and potent adjuvant system, peptides based vaccine candidates have been unsuccessful to induce robust response in pigs. Moreover, in intramuscularly vaccinated animals mucosal immune system is weakly activated. Recently, chimeric construct that express M2e on the surface loop of norovirus P particle (M2e-PP) was shown to produce high levels of antibody response and protect mice from a lethal challenge [7] . In pigs, M2e-PP also induced specific immune response, but failed to provide protection from disease (unpublished data).",

One of the endeavors of 21 st century is delivery of vaccines and drugs through biocompatible and biodegradable polymer based nano or microparticles. PLGA (poly lactic-co-glycolic acid) is a nontoxic, FDA and European Medicines Agency approved polymer, and widely used as a vehicle for drug and vaccine delivery [9, 10] . The properties of PLGA made it ideal to entrap even soluble vaccine Ags in nanoparticles (NP) (200-600 nm) to elicit strong immune response [11] . PLGA-NP entrapped peptide Ags are being protected from enzymatic or ionic degradation in vivo until they are uptaken by antigen presenting cells (APCs) [12] . Particulate antigens are readily taken up by mucosal M cells and APCs in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues in intranasally vaccinated animals [13] , which enhances antigen specific IFN\u03b3 secreting T cell response and production of high-affinity neutralizing antibodies in pigs [14, 15] . Benefits of PLGA based intranasal vaccine delivery system with the inactivated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in pigs and Hepatitis B Ags in rodents has been demonstrated [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

We entrapped M2e-PP and pooled four peptides separately in PLGA-NP using the similar procedure. In vitro characterization of both peptides and M2e-PP entrapped NPs showed comparable results and the data of M2e-PP is shown here. Entrapment efficiency of M2e-PP in NP was 50-54%. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging of NP revealed them as spherical particles (Fig 1A) . Size distribution profile of the NP was determined by dynamic light scattering technique and it was 227-316 nm with the majority of NPs around 260 nm (Fig 1B) . Surface charge of the particles was -21.93\u00b12.93 mV (an average value of ten runs) as measured by zeta potential analysis. In vitro protein release profile of M2e-PP from NP-entrapped M2e-PP suspended in PBS overtime was quantified under physiological conditions. PLGA-NP containing the vaccine cargo carry a small quantity of surface anchored Ags and they rapidly release upon reconstitution in PBS ( 10 min) called the burst release; while the entrapped Ags in NP release over a period of 4-6 weeks [15] . We observed a burst release of 14.3%, cumulative release of 25% (including the burse release) after 2 hr (day 0) and the total release of 64% over a period of 4 weeks (Fig 1C) . Thus, our results indicated that PLGA-NP release entrapped M2e-PP gradually, supporting the principle of depot-effect provided by PLGA-NP under in vivo conditions.",

Hence, to elicit strong specific response to influenza, we entrapped highly conserved H1N1 peptides in PLGA-NPs and inoculated intranasally in the form of mist to pigs to efficiently reach the mucosal inductive sites in the respiratory tract. Our results demonstrated a significantly reduced detectable infectious challenged virus in the airways of NPP and NPA vaccinated pigs, associated with augmented antigen-specific T cell response in the lung lymphocytes of NPP inoculated animals. Amounts of each of the four peptides entrapped in NP-Peptides vaccine is assumed to be the same, because in another independent study individual peptides entrapped in PLGA NPs had comparable levels of entrapment efficiency.

            "text": "Studies in mice demonstrated that intranasal administration of M2e-PP chimera induces high levels of M2e specific antibodies [7] . Conserved A7 and A8 peptides elicit antibody response in pigs, but failed to reduce the flu symptoms [5, 6] . Soluble antigens and peptides are poorly immunogenic, but when entrapped in NPs elicit strong immune response [38, 39] . Pulmonary immune response varies with the vaccine particle size and surface charge, because particles of 500 nm are readily phagocytized by dendritic cells and M cells at mucosal sites [40, 41] . Consistent with that the size of our candidate NP-Peptide vaccine was approximately 300 nm. PLGA-NP entrapped Ags are stable for 4-6 weeks and facilitate activation and maturation of APCs [40, 42] . Mechanism of induction of increased breadth of protective response by NPs based vaccine delivery system is mediated through efficient internalization of particulate Ags, followed by processing and cross-presentation of entrapped Ags by dendritic cells and macrophages to na\u00efve CD8 T cells [43] [44] [45] . This has been shown specifically using PLGA NPs delivery system mediated by their ability to disrupt phagosomes and release of cargo into cytosol for MHC class I loading [44, 45] . Based on our data with heightened peptide-specific CD4 CD8 double positive T cell response in LMNCs of NPP pig group, it is expected that both dendritic cells and macrophages in the lungs of pigs would have uptaken and efficiently cross-presented the PLGA-NP delivered peptide Ags to na\u00efve T cells. Pigs vaccinated with M2eHBc fusion proteins without NP delivery system has failed to protect animals from a challenge virus induced flu symptoms [5] . -1 to 7) . SwIV titer in BAL fluid at DPC 7 was detected by (B) viral RNA load by qRT-PCR, and (C) replicating infectious virus load using MDCK cells by immunofluorescence assay. The ratio indicated above each bar represents the number of pigs positive for virus and contributed to the data out of 6 or 7 animals. The viral titer is expressed in tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID 50 ) in each ml of the BAL fluid. Each data point or bar represents the average value of 6 to 7 pigs \u00b1 SEM. Asterisk denotes statistically significant difference at P<0.05 (*) between MKC and NPP or NPA pig groups determined by One way ANOVA followed by Tukey Post-hoc test. In pigs, a significant upregulation of activated CD4 CD8 double positive T cells has been associated with protective response against classical swine fever, Aujeszky's disease and PRRS viruses [14, 15, 46, 47] . In particular in our study, NPP but not NPA vaccinated pigs elicited antigen-specific increased activated IFN\u03b3 secreting CD4 CD8 double positive T cell response in the lungs. Interestingly, complete clearance of detectable infectious challenge virus was observed in the airways of both NPP and NPA vaccinated animals, despite the comparable low levels of humoral response. This data suggested the critical role played by NPs entrapped peptides delivery system in pigs, as well as the role of adjuvant M. vaccae WCL in possibly skewing the response of NPP towards the Th2 or Th1-Th2 balanced state, which needs further investigation.",

In place of the adjuvant M. tb WCL, we used a nonpathogenic mycobacterium, M. vaccae derived WCL; because, M. vaccae has comparable biochemical and cellular components of M. tb [48] , and also it was shown to possess potent adjuvant effects in rodents [49, 50] . Further, M. vaccae WCL was not entrapped in PLGA-NP, because greater adjuvant effects by soluble compared to NP entrapped M. tb WCL in intranasally vaccinated pigs was observed [14, 15] . Overall, our study suggested that M. vaccae WCL is not a potent adjuvant to NPP vaccine in pigs, indicating the need of including additional highly antigenic B cell peptides or inactivated SwIV entrapped in NPs and coadministered with a potent adjuvant to boost the specific antibody response in pigs.",
