However, these genes are often implicated in several physiological processes, and long-term inhibition of survival proteins might be accompanied with cytotoxic effects. To avoid this problem, an alternative therapeutic strategy relies on the identification and use of compounds that disrupt specific protein-protein interactions involved in androgen withdrawal. Specifically, the interaction of the chaperone protein Hsp27 with the initiation factor eIF4E leads to the protection of protein synthesis initiation process and enhances cell survival during cell stress induced by castration or chemotherapy. Thus, in this work we aimed at i) identifying the interaction site of the Hsp27/eIF4E complex and ii) interfere with the relevant protein/protein association mechanism involved in castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer. By a combination of experimental and modeling techniques, we proved that eIF4E interacts with the C-terminal part of Hsp27, preferentially when Hsp27 is phosphorylated. We also observed that the loss of this interaction increased cell chemo-and hormone-sensitivity. In order to find a potential inhibitor of Hsp27/eIF4E interaction, BRET assays in combination with molecular simulations identified the phenazine derivative 14 as the compound able to efficiently interfere with this protein/protein interaction, thereby inhibiting cell viability and increasing cell death in chemo-and castration-resistant prostate cancer models in vitro and in vivo.",

            "text": "Prostate cancer (PC) represents the second cause of cancer mortality in men, mainly because patients relapse to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) two years after androgen ablation. The final treatment option is chemotherapy (docetaxel), but the median overall survival is only two/three months. Recently, cabazytaxel and Abiraterone has been approved as chemo-and endocrinetherapy agents but overall survival is only around 12 to 18 months [1, 2] . The actual therapeutic strategy to delay or prevent the emergence of the castration-refractory phenotype in advanced PC involves targeting genes activated by androgen withdrawal (for review [3] ). Hsp27, a heat shock protein involved in pleiotropic cell functions [4] (for review [5] ) is a highly overexpressed gene in CRPC [6, 7] . Aberrant expression of Hsp27 has been associated with tumor growth, resistance to hormonal therapy, cell death inhibition, and poor prognosis [6] [7] [8] [9] . Silencing of Hsp27 expression by the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) increases apoptotic rates, induces tumor regression and enhances hormone-and chemotherapy in PC [6, 7] . Despite excellent results observed in relevant clinical trials (http://www.oncogenex.ca/) the functional role of stress-induced Hsp27 in castration or chemotherapy-induced cell death remains poorly defined. The purpose of our work is to elucidate the pathways leading Hsp27 action in CRPC and to find new specific therapeutic targets and treatment strategy for CRPC that would have limited toxicity for normal tissues. Using twohybrid experiment, we previously found that Hsp27 plays a major role in the protein translational initiation process [10] . These data led us to investigate the protein synthesis initiation pathway, a prerequisite for cell growth and proliferation. Thus, by northern and western blot analysis we found that Hsp27 down-regulation decreased eIF4E expression only at the protein level, without affecting mRNA content. The cytoprotection afforded by Hsp27 overexpression was attenuated by eIF4E knockdown using specific eIF4E siRNA. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that Hsp27 co-localizes and interacts directly with eIF4E. Hsp27-eIF4E interaction decreases eIF4E ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. By chaperoning eIF4E, Hsp27 protects the protein synthesis initiation process to enhance cell survival during cell stress induced by castration or chemotherapy. Forced over-expression of eIF4E induced resistance to androgen-withdrawal and docetaxel treatment in the prostate LNCaP cells line in vitro. In aggregate, these findings identified Hsp27 as a modulator of eIF4E and established a potential mechanism for the eIF4E-regulated cell death after androgen ablation and chemotherapy. Accordingly, targeting Hsp27-eIF4E interaction may serve as a therapeutic option in advanced PC [10] .",

The results showed that N1 and N2 correspond to two different variants of the N-terminal region of Hsp27 protein (residues 1-93, and 1-173, respectively), whereas mutant C1 corresponds to the Hsp27 C-terminal region, containing the last 113 protein residues (residues 93-205). The fulllength WT Hsp27 sequence was used as control. No endogenous Hsp27 expression REG cells transiently transfected or not (NT) with plasmids containing WT Hsp27 and N1, N2 and C1 and proteins were extracted for: (b) Western Blot analysis of histidine and vinculin protein levels from total cell lysates (TCL) and (c) Western Blot analysis of histidine and eIF4E protein levels after immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-eIF4E antibody (d) MTT quantification of REG cells viability. (e) Schematic representation of Hsp27 wild type (WT) and phosphorylation mutants of Hsp27 (3A and 3D) used in this study. In the former case, the 3A mutant of Hsp27 was specifically constructed by replacing the serine residues 15, 78 and 82 with alanine; concomitantly, the 3D Hsp27 isoforms was obtained by replacing the same serine residues with aspartic acid. (f) Western Blot analysis of histidine and vinculin protein levels from total cell lysates (TCL) and (g) Western Blot analysis of histidine and eIF4E protein levels after immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-eIF4E antibody.

(i) Overall view of an equilibrated MD snapshot of the Hsp27 WT/eIF4E complex. The proteins are visualized by their van der Waals surfaces, colored as follow: Hsp27 WT, firebrick; eIF4E, khaki. The amino acids of Hsp27 mainly involved in binding eIF4E are highlighted as follows: purple, residues belonging to the WDPF domain; green, residues belonging to the flexible domain. See text for details. (j) Per residue enthalpic contribution to WT Hsp27 binding with eIF4E. Only those Hsp27 amino acids affording a meaningful contribution to protein-protein formation contributing (\u0394H bind,res < -0.80 kcal/mol) are shown for clarity. From this analysis, it further appears that the Hsp27 \u03b1-crystallin domain is practically ineffective in Hsp27/eIF4E binding since residues belonging to this Hsp27 region display a negligible contribution to protein-protein binding enthalpy. (k) Overall view of equilibrated MD snapshots of the eIF4E in complex with Hsp27 N1, N2 and C1 truncated mutant isoforms. In each panel, the proteins are visualized by their van der Waals surfaces, colored as follows: Hsp27s, firebrick; eIF4E, khaki. The amino acids of Hsp27 mainly involved in binding eIF4E are highlighted as follows: purple, residues belonging to the WDPF domain; green, residues belonging to the flexible domain. Interestingly, the overall structure of Hsp27 N1 is de facto strongly affected by the loss of the \u03b1-crystallin domain, which plays a major role in the overall correct chaperon folding required for effective binding to eIF4E. the interaction of eIF4E with the phosphorylated form of Hsp27 (3D mutant) was similar to the one observed with the WT protein, while partial inhibition of the interaction was found with the unphosphorylated form (3A mutant) (Figure 1f-1g) showing that phosphorylation regulates the interaction. To understand the implication of Hsp27 phosphorylation on cell drug resistance, transfected cells were treated with docetaxel in serum free media. The analysis of cell viability showed that the unphosphorylated 3A mutant of Hsp27 restored sensitivity to cell death driven by docetaxel and androgen withdrawal, while no effect on cell viability was observed in the case of the constitutively phosphorylated mutant mimics (3D) ( Figure  1h ). The same results have been obtained in LNCaP prostate cancer models (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Hsp27 phosphorylation partly regulates Hsp27/eIF4E interaction and confirm that loss of this interaction can induce treatment-sensitivity.",

A per-residue binding enthalpy (\u0394H bind,res ) analysis [13, 14] allowed to determine which Hsp27 residues are mainly involved in this interaction ( Figure 1j ). Accordingly, we found that WT Hsp27 binds the initiation factor mainly by exploiting the initial residues of the domain WDPF (W=tryptophan, D=aspartic acid, P=prolin and F=phenylalanine) and the final residues of the flexible domain in the C-terminal region, these last providing a favorable contribution to the binding two times larger than that afforded by the amino acids of the N-terminal part ( Figure 1k ).",

As expected, the \u0394G bind values of the truncated forms were all less favorable compared to the WT protein (Table 1 ). Yet, a specific trend could be clearly discerned. Indeed, the presence of the C-terminal part still endow the Hsp27 C1 mutant with good eIF4E binding capability, inducing only a small decrease in binding affinity with respect to the WT (\u0394G bind(C1) = -9.99 kcal/mol). On the other hand, the Hsp27 N2 isoform is still able to maintain a minimal affinity against the eIF4E through its WDPF residues; however, the absence of the C-terminal region leads to a strong reduction of the interaction surface ( Figure 1h ) and this, in turn, reflects into a loss of almost 6 kcal/mol in \u0394G bind (Table 1) . Lastly, the presence of the sole WDPF domain in the N1 Hsp27 mutant form allows the formation of a network of very weak interactions with eIF4E, reflecting in a plummet of ~9 kcal/mol in the relevant value of \u0394G bind (Table 1, Figure 1i ). In aggregate, our in silico results confirmed that the most important interactions involved in binding of the Hsp27 protein with the initiation factor eIF4E are provided by its C-terminal part, strictly in agreement with the co-immunoprecipitation experiments.",

We performed our screening using phenazine derivatives that were previously shown to have an antitumor activity in pancreatic and prostatic cell lines [15, 16] and structure similar to inhibitors of the eIF4E/eIF4G interaction (Figure 2d ).

These couples of plasmids were transfected separately in HEK293T cells at different concentrations in order to find the ideal ratios and obtain the BRET signal. For the construction of BRET plasmids, we merged each gene (Hsp27 and eIF4E) with Rluc or YFP in N-terminal (N-ter) or C-terminal (C-ter) part. After, we tested the interaction between these two proteins with all the possible couple combinations of plasmids, on BRET on living cells or cells extracts. (b) Hsp27/eIF4E interaction in BRET experiment was investigated in HEK293T cell extracts.

To see if this inhibition was specifically due to Hsp27/eIF4E interaction rather than to non-specific protein degradations, 14 was tested on an irrelevant couple of proteins, CCND3/Luc and CDK6/YFP. The result showed no inhibition of this interaction by 14, supporting the specificity of Hsp27/eIF4E interaction inhibition ( Figure 2g ).

To verify this hypothesis, a plausible binding cavity for 14 in a region of the protein that belongs to the interacting surface of the Hsp27/eIF4E complex was identified (Figure 3a) .

The network of stabilizing hydrophobic interaction involves the two C 12 alkyl chains of the 14 and the side chain of the protein residue L117*, N118*, F129*, L189*, P190*, K192*, and I193*. The two amine substituents of 14 are engaged in two persistent polar interactions with the carboxylic side chain of E132* and E185*. In addition, a further stabilizing interaction via a weak hydrogen bond between the side chain of R128* and a nitrogen atom of the phenazine ring is detected. (b) (Left panel) MD simulation distance between the charged side chains of E132* and R186* in the eIF4E alone (red line) and in the eIF4E/14 complex (salmon line). In the eIF4E free protein, the two \u03b1-helixes spanning residues Q122*-I138* and R173*-G188*, respectively, are persistently stabilized by the presence of permanent interaction points between the side chain of their residues. In particular, a strong polar interaction between the charged side chain of the amino acids E132* and R186* is detected. As shown, the Average Dynamics Length (ADL) of this interaction between the two involved atoms is 2.96 \u00c5, and its persistence is verified along the entire MD run. Conversely, the same distance progressively increases during the first part of the simulations and finally settles around 9\u00c5 when the eIF4F is simulated in presence of the ligand. The reason for this behavior can be explained by that fact that E132* is engaged in a polar interaction with 14, as demonstrated by the complementary trend exhibited of the corresponding distance between the carboxylic moiety of E132* and the amine group of 14 shown in the right panel (MD simulation distance between the N2 nitrogen atom of 14 and the charged side chain of E132* (blue line), and between the N3 nitrogen atom of 14 and the charged side chain of E185* (green line). with 14 (26.09 \u00b1 0.17 and 13.7 \u00b1 0.18, p < 0.0001) ( Figure  4g ).

In this study, we sought to further characterize important facets of the interaction between Hsp27 and eIF4E. First, using both co-immunoprecipitation ( Figure 1 ) and BRET assays (Figure 2 ), we demonstrated that the interaction between Hsp27 and eIF4E may involve the C-terminal domain of Hsp27, and that loss of this interaction restores chemoand hormone-sensitivity of PC. Next, we determined that phosphorylation of Hsp27 enhances its interaction with eIF4E (Figure 1f-1g) . Finally, we identified and characterized the first compound, 14 able to inhibit the Hsp27/eIF4E interaction (Figure 3) .",

Structure and function studies indicate that the chaperone properties of Hsp27 correlate with the ability of the protein to form large oligomers, which are mediated by the non-phosphorylated form of Hsp27 [24, 25] .

This interaction further avoids MDM2/ AR binding and promotes MDM2 ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome [27] . Our work indicates that Hsp27 has a similar role on eIF4E, protecting it from degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system and allowing maintenance of protein synthesis. The hypothesis of the \"sorting\" function of this protein is reinforced by the fact that Hsp27 seems to be selective with respect to targets to be degraded. For example, it acts on p27 kip1 but has no action on other cell cycle proteins such as cyclin A, E, D1 or \u03b2-catenin [28, 29] .",

The C-ter part of Hsp27 (C1 mutant) and the loss of this interaction (N1 and N2 mutants) are both involved, at least in part, in the increase of treatment-sensitivity of the cells (Figure  1b-1c) . Thus, different portions of the Hsp27 molecule may be responsible for mediating the response to different stimuli. For example, the C-terminal domain may be largely responsible for the response to stress, whereas the N-terminal could be responsible for modulating hormonal signaling [30] . Another study indicates that the C-terminal of Hsp27 retains its flexibility during the interaction with dithiothereitol and suggests a highly flexible C-terminal in mammalian sHSPs is required for full chaperone activity [31] .",

The rationale of targeting Hsp27/eIF4E interaction is that long-term inhibition of two proteins separately may be toxic for the cells.

DNA content was determined by flow cytometry using a LSRII SORP (Becton Dickinson, France) machine. Rates of cells death were then measured using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.). 10 6 PC3 cells were inoculated in the flank region of 2-week-old athymic male mice (NSG). Tumors were measured weekly and their volume was calculated by the formula length\u00d7width\u00d7depth\u00d70.5236. When tumors reached 100 mm 3 , mice were randomly selected for treatment with PBS (control) or 14 alone. Each experimental group consisted of 6 control mice and 8 mice treated with 14. Phenazine 14 was tested at its highest solubility (1mg/ml). Injection lasted 8 weeks with two injections per week. Data points were expressed as average tumor volume levels \u00b1SE.

After blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity with Dako EnVision FLEX Peroxidase-Blocking Reagent SM801 (ready to use) (K8000, K8002, K8023; Dako UK Ltd.) for 5 min, the slides were washed thoroughly in wash buffer FLEX (Dako UK Ltd).

After two more washes in FLEX buffer, Dako EnVision FLEX/HRP SM802 (K8000; Dako UK Ltd.) was added for 20 min at room temperature. After two final washes with FLEX buffer, the staining was visualized by adding diaminobenzidine (Dako UK Ltd.) for 10 min at room temperature.

Delimitation of surface area was carried out manually using the mouse of the image analyzer. For each positive immunostained section, one negative control section (the following in a series of consecutive sections) was also used, and the optic density of this control section was taken away from that of the stained section. From the average values obtained (by the automatic image analyzer) for each tumor, the means \u00b1 SEM for each tumor (PBS and 14) were calculated. The number of sections examined was determined by successive approaches to obtain the minimum number required to reach the lowest SEM.
