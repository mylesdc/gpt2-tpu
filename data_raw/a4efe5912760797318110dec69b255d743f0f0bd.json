In this study, we investigated the roles of CXCR2 and CXCL1 in leukocyte recruitment to the CNS using a murine model of neuroinflammation. Methods: Wild-type (WT), CXCL1 \u2212/\u2212 , and CXCR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice each received an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Esterase staining and intravital microscopy were performed to examine neutrophil recruitment to the brain. To assess endothelial activation in these mice, the expression of adhesion molecules was measured via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting. To identify the cellular source of functional CXCR2, chimeric mice were generated by transferring bone marrow cells between the WT and CXCR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Results: Expression levels of the chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 were significantly increased in the brain following the i.c.v. injection of LPS. CXCR2 or CXCL1 deficiency blocked neutrophil infiltration and leukocyte recruitment in the cerebral microvessels. In the CXCR2 \u2212/\u2212 and CXCL1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, the cerebral endothelial expression of adhesion molecules such as P-selectin and VCAM-1 was dramatically reduced. Furthermore, the bone marrow transfer experiments demonstrated that CXCR2 expression on CNS-residing cells is essential for cerebral endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment. Compared with microglia, cultured astrocytes secreted a much higher level of CXCL1 in vitro. Astrocyte culture conditioned medium significantly increased the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in cerebral endothelial cells in a CXCR2-dependent manner. Additionally, CXCR2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in cerebral endothelial cells but not in microglia or astrocytes was increased following tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) stimulation. The intravenous injection of the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 significantly inhibited endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment to cerebral microvessels.",

Interactions between CXCR2 and its ligands play an essential role in mediating neutrophil migration to sites of inflammation. Although extensive studies have focused on the role of CXCR2 in inflammatory responses in different organs, the involvement of individual chemokines in different types of inflammatory responses remains contentious. For example, CXCL1 is essential for the host pulmonary defense to klebsiella infection [13] and mediates neutrophil recruitment during the progression of experimental Lyme arthritis [14] . However, even in the presence of high levels of CXCL1 expression, the interaction between CXCL2 and CXCR2 is still essential for neutrophil migration in response to specific antigen challenge [15] . Additionally, CXCL2 plays a more important role than CXCL1 in a viral antigen-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity response [16] . Furthermore, CXCR2 is widely expressed on neutrophils [17] , lymphocytes [18] , and other types of non-hematopoietic cells, including epithelial [19] and endothelial cells [20, 21] . Most studies have focused on the functions of CXCR2 expressed on hematopoietic cells, such as monocytes [22, 23] and neutrophils [24] [25] [26] [27] . However, recent studies have revealed a critical role of CXCR2 expressed on nonhematopoietic cells during inflammatory responses. In a murine model of acute kidney infection, CXCR2 on non-bone marrow-derived cells influenced the neutrophil response [19] . Additionally, CXCR2 expression on resident cells is essential for the migration of mast cell progenitors in the lung of antigen-challenged mice [28] . However, the roles of CXCR2 and its ligands in CNS inflammation remain to be addressed.",

Heterozygous F1 offspring were interbred to produce homozygous F2 animals. To functionally validate the TALEN-induced mutations, we intracerebroventricularly injected LPS into these mice and measured the level of CXCL1 in the brain. No expression of CXCL1 was detected in the CXCL1 mutant founder. The CXCL1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were viable and fertile and did not exhibit any gross abnormalities.",

Additionally, the protein expression levels of these adhesion molecules were assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 5A) . Consistent with the realtime PCR results, both CXCR2 deficiency and CXCL1 deficiency dramatically reduced the protein expression of P-selectin (Fig. 5B ) and VCAM-1 (Fig. 5C ) in the brain. A significant reduction in the levels of ICAM-1 ( Fig. 5D ) was also observed in the CXCR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, albeit to a lesser extent. Taken together, these results suggest that both CXCR2 and CXCL1 are critical effectors that mediate the expression of adhesion molecules on cerebral endothelial cells during CNS inflammation. It is well established that CNS inflammation induces permeability changes to the blood-brain barrier. The i.c.v. injection of LPS induced a significant change in brain albumin concentration 12 and 24 h post-treatment in both WT and CXCR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. However, no significant difference in albumin concentrations between the WT and CXCR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice was observed 4, 12, and 24 h after i.c.v. LPS injection (Fig. 5E) . Therefore, it is likely that rather than affecting the integrity of blood-brain barrier, CXCR2 deficiency affected neutrophil recruitment by attenuating endothelial activation.",

Intravital microscopy revealed that a deficiency in either CXCR2 or CXCL1 significantly reduced leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in brain vessels. Additionally, reduced expression of P-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 was observed in the brain of CXCR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Therefore, it is likely that the functional CXCR2 that mediates leukocyte recruitment is located on the CNS endothelium. Our previous study reported that TNF-\u03b1 in the LPS-treated brain activated the endothelium to cause an increase in adhesion molecule expression and leukocyte recruitment [29] . In response to i.c.v. LPS injection, CXCR2 deficiency did not reduce TNF-\u03b1 levels in the brain. Clearly, a deficiency in CXCR2 or CXCL1 directly affected cerebral endothelial activation, but not microglial activation. In addition to its chemotactic properties, CXCL1 also exerts direct effects on BBB permeability. The exposure of brain microvascular endothelial cells to CXCL1 in vitro altered endothelial permeability and facilitated transendothelial monocyte migration [38] . However, in our study, CXCR2 deficiency did not affect albumin leakage across the BBB. Therefore, the reduction in neutrophil infiltration was not due to a change in the Fig. 6 Leukocyte recruitment and the expression of P-selectin and VCAM-1 in the WT, CXCR2 \u2212/\u2212 , and chimeric mice. a Chimeric mice were generated by transferring bone marrow cells between WT and CXCR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. b Intravital microscopy was performed on WT, CXCR2 \u2212/\u2212 , and chimeric mice, 4 h after i.c.v.

Interestingly, functional CXCR2 is not expressed on circulating leukocytes from the bone marrow. Therefore, the activation of CXCR2 on leukocytes is not required for their recruitment in cerebral blood vessels. Earlier studies have identified the expression of CXCR2 on many types of CNS-residing cells [39] [40] [41] . Fig. 7 Astrocyte-derived CXCL1 and endothelial CXCR2 are essential for cerebral endothelial activation. A i.c.v. LPS injection (4 h) induced significant CXCR2 mRNA expression in WT mice. B Levels of CXCR2 protein after i.c.v. LPS injection from 4 to 24 h gradually increased compared with the control group (4 h after i.c.v. saline injection). C The expression of CXCR2 mRNA in primary brain microvascular endothelial cells, microglia, and astrocytes stimulated with either vehicle or TNF-\u03b1 (100 ng/ml) was measured via real-time PCR. The results are represented as the means \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments; *P < 0.05. D Primary endothelial cells, astrocytes, and microglia were seeded at 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/well in six-well plates and were incubated overnight. The following day, the cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS or 100 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 for 12 h. Cell lysates were collected and analyzed for CXCR2 expression via Western blotting. E Primary astrocytes and microglia from wild-type mice were seeded at 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/well in six-well plates and were incubated overnight. The following day, the cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS or 100 ng/ml TNF-\u03b1 for 12 h. Then, the conditioned supernatants and cell lysates were collected and analyzed for CXCL1 expression via ELISA. The results are represented as the means \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments; **P < 0.01. F Astrocyte culture conditioned medium was added into primary cerebral endothelial cells from wild-type or CXCR2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, and the levels of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were measured via Western blotting This finding demonstrated that the expression of CXCR2 on CNS-residing cells, including endothelial cells, astrocytes, and microglia, is more important than its expression on circulating cells during CNS inflammation. Moreover, TNF-\u03b1 robustly induced a high expression of CXCR2 mRNA in primary murine endothelial cells, but not in primary microglia or astrocytes. High levels of expression of the CXCR2 mRNA and protein were detected in wild-type cerebral endothelial cells, which strongly indicates that endothelial CXCR2 is a key player mediating cerebral endothelial activation. To further validate the role of endothelial CXCR2, we intravenously injected SB225002 to block the function of CXCR2 in brain endothelial cells, as SB225002 in the blood circulation can easily access the brain endothelium. Compared with mice treated with LPS alone, both cerebral endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment in the cerebral vessels were reduced in the mice treated with both SB225002 and LPS. Taken together, these data indicate that SB225002 potently inhibited CXCR2 function on brain endothelial cells, thereby blocked leukocyte recruitment.",

CXCL1 deficiency reduced leukocyte recruitment and endothelial activation by over 50 % in vivo. Astrocytes are essential structural components of the BBB [43, 44] ; among all cell types in the brain, they have the easiest access to the brain endothelium and can release CXCL1, which possibly accumulate in the perivascular space at an extremely high concentration to activate cerebral endothelial cells.
