Macrolides may be beneficial in settings where children have high rates of nasopharyngeal bacterial carriage and frequent prolonged illness. The aim of our double-blind placebo-controlled randomised trial was to determine if a large single dose of azithromycin (compared to placebo) reduced length of stay (LOS), duration of oxygen (O 2 ) and respiratory readmissions within 6 months of children hospitalised with bronchiolitis. We also determined the effect of azithromycin on nasopharyngeal microbiology.",

Three randomised placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) have been published and these RCTs used different doses and duration of macrolides to treat hospitalised bronchiolitis [16] [17, 18] . These studies also differed in affluence of settings which may reflect differences in the frequency and severity of acute respiratory infections in these populations [19] . Thus not surprisingly, results from the existing RCTs differed in the effect on reducing length of hospitalisation and O 2 requirement. A Turkish [17] trial reported improved clinical outcomes.

The higher rate is more likely in less-affluent settings and/or with those with more severe disease [22] [23] [24] . Viral-bacterial co-infections are more likely when the upper airways are densely colonised with bacteria or during repeated infections [25] . In the NT, children have early acquisition of bacteria in the nasal space [26] . This is more likely to be similar to Turkey where high rates of pneumonia and bronchiectasis are also reported [22] . Thus, we conducted a RCT on children hospitalised with bronchiolitis. Our primary objective was to determine whether a single large dose of azithromycin (compared to placebo) reduced length of stay (LOS) and duration of O 2 requirement in children hospitalised with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. We also determined the influence of azithromycin on the incidence of respiratory readmissions and presence of bacteria and viruses in the nasopharynx.",

'Ready for discharge' differed from LOS, as discharge from hospital in our setting is often delayed due to other social factors, especially in children from remote Indigenous communities.

Our findings are similar to the other two trials [16, 18] showing that a single dose azithromycin does not shorten LOS and O 2 requirement. However, methodological differences among trials need to be considered. One of the larger trials [16] included only children with RSV-confirmed bronchiolitis, thus limiting generalisation to bronchiolitis caused by other pathogens. Other differences included: age, ethnic populations, concurrent use of antibiotics, treatment practices and macrolide type, dose and duration. The immunomodulatory difference between azithromycin and clarithromycin may also account for the differential results between Tahan et al's study [17] with ours and the other 2 RCTs [16, 18] . For example, azithromycin increased the production of IL-10 whereas clarithromycin inhibited the production of IL-6 by dendritic cells in animal work [35] . Tahan and colleagues [17] used a daily dose for 3-weeks of clarithromycin, but ours like Kneyber et al [16, 18] (7-day daily dose) used a short course of azithromycin. However, Tahan et al's [17] study had very small numbers (n = 21) and high attrition. Thus, it remains unknown if a longer course of azithromycin may be effective in reducing readmission rates.",

However, unlike the Turkish RCT, [17] we did not find a beneficial effect of azithromycin on clinical outcomes. Possibly contributory reasons include the very high concomitant use of antibiotics in our group; different treatment regime used the density of bacterial carriage and secondary co-morbidities. The common use of antibiotics in children with bronchiolitis in our setting relates to the high rates of concomitant infections among children. A similar treatment practice occurs in Alaskan children [1] . 56% of Indigenous children in our trial received antibiotics before admission and 87% during hospitalisation. While the use of antibiotics is common practice in such settings, its effectiveness and possibly increased adverse events remains unknown. Ideally concurrent antibiotics should have been disallowed in our study but it was not possible to alter clinicians' practice and our a priori protocol allowed the concurrent use of antibiotics other than macrolides.",

Future research should look at the impact of azithromycin on viral load/copies.

This is not surprising as Indigenous children in the NT are 5 times more likely to be hospitalised for pneumonia and influenza than non-Indigenous children [43] . Whether readmission is related to the insult from bronchiolitis can only be postulated. Recurrent hospitalisation for respiratory illness is an independent risk factor for developing bronchiectasis and/or respiratory dysfunction in adulthood [44, 45] . In our region, bronchiectasis affects 1 in every 68 Indigenous children [46] .

            "text": "The prevalence of readmission for a respiratory illness within 6months in our trial was 21%; 70% had a wheezing illness. This was similar to the Turkish trial at 24% (53% were wheezing) [17] . The two most common viruses found in our cohort, RSV and HRV have been implicated for ongoing wheezing [47] [48] [49] [50] . New Zealand data have also recently described high prevalence (70%) of on-going intermittent wheeze 12-months post hospitalisation with acute lower respiratory infections [41] . In addition, wheezing and persistent cough can also be problematic post acute bronchiolitis [17] . Our trial (and the other published RCTs of macrolides for acute bronchiolitis) did not assess this, a known clinical research gap [7, 51] .",

Having older children increased the risk of including asthma prone children. We also did not limit to the first bronchiolitis admission. Removing the children with recurrent disease in a secondary analysis made no difference to study outcomes. As our study was limited to a single dose, it remains uncertain if any macrolides, or a longer macrolide treatment course, is beneficial in high risk children who do not receive any other antibiotics. Only having two sites, may also affect the generalisability of the results.",

Azithromycin reduced the proportion of bacterial carriage, but had no significant effect on reducing proportion of viruses. Further research is required to determine whether earlier administration and longer duration of azithromycin is beneficial to improve the clinical and microbiological outcomes of acute bronchiolitis, associated co-morbidities and prevent ongoing respiratory morbidity in this population.",
