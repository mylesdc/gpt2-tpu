The workshop provided a forum for discussion of recent advances in the field, in an informal setting conducive to interaction with colleagues. CSV2016 featured two internationally-renowned Canadian keynote speakers who discussed translational virology research; American Society for Virology President Grant McFadden (then from University of Florida, now relocated to Arizona State University) who presented his studies of oncolytic poxviruses, while Matthew Miller (McMaster University) reviewed the prospects for a universal influenza vaccine. The workshop also featured a variety of trainee oral and poster presentations, and a panel discussion on the topic of the future of the CSV and virus research in Canada.",

For Canada to meet the challenge of emerging and chronic viral infections, and realize its potential to lead in this research area, the virology research community must come together to exchange ideas and discover new opportunities for collaboration. Recognizing the outstanding need for better ways for the Canadian virology research community to interact, we founded the Canadian Society for Virology (CSV)/Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Canadienne pour la Virologie (SCV) (Figure 1 ). We seek to create structures that will foster collaboration and accelerate the translation of virology research findings to positive health outcomes for Canadians. To launch the CSV, we developed a Special Workshop in conjunction with the 35th Annual Meeting for the American Society for Virology. This workshop was the first scientific activity of the newly-founded CSV. The objectives of the 1st Workshop of the Canadian Society for Virology (CSV2016) were:",

Well known as the leading expert on a rabbit poxvirus known as myxoma virus, McFadden has elucidated many aspects of virus-host interactions, linking key poxvirus proteins to immune evasion and pathogenesis [1] . He has also led efforts to test the oncolytic properties of these viruses. It is a widely-held view that defective antiviral defenses are an 'Achilles Heel' of cancer cells that can be exploited for oncolytic virotherapy. McFadden made the case for myxoma virus as a promising oncolytic agent; it can kill a variety of human cancer cells in vitro, it is nonpathogenic outside of the rabbit host, it is genetically tractable, and there is no evidence for pre-existing antibodies in the human population.",

Most notably, no phosphatase has yet been identified that can dephosphorylate the p38 and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) enzymes following paramyxovirus infection. Ms. Robitaille reported that dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) is strongly upregulated in response to infection with the paramyxoviruses Sendai virus (SeV) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Ectopic overexpression of DUSP1 during infection diminished the levels of phosphorylated p38 and JNK MAPKs, whereas DUSP1-specific RNA interference had the opposite effect. Surprisingly, DUSP1-mediated inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation had no effect on downstream phosphorylation of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2)/c-Jun, or the levels of cytokines elicited during infection. Moreover, ectopic expression of DUSP1 has no effect on RSV replication in cell culture. Ms. Robitaille hypothesized that, in this system, DUSP1 may be affecting a different pool of p38 and JNK MAPK enzymes that govern alternative functions, while leaving activator protein 1 (AP-1)-mediated cytokine production intact.",

A liver-specific microRNA (miRNA) known as miR-122 dictates HCV hepatotropism by binding directly to HCV RNA near the 5 -untranslated region and promoting HCV RNA translation and replication [9] . Argonaute (Ago) proteins are components of RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) that direct the activities of miRNAs, and are necessary for miR-122-mediated promotion of the HCV replication cycle [10] . Dr. Joyce Wilson from the University of Saskatchewan stepped in to present the research of her postdoctoral fellow Dr. Yalena Amador-Canizares, who was unable to present due to a travel delay. Dr. Wilson reported that they had used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to knock out Ago2, the only Ago protein with 'slicing' (RNA cleaving) activity. Ago2 knockout cells supported HCV replication, suggesting that at least one other Ago protein can sustain high levels of HCV replication in the absence of Ago2. Dr. Wilson indicated that it will be important to methodically knock out combinations of all four Ago proteins to further elucidate their role in HCV replication.",

A 'One Health' approach has been proposed to prevent human MERS-CoV infection, by vaccinating camels [11] . This camel model demonstrated efficient MERS-CoV replication in the upper respiratory tract and shedding of virus [12] , but several factors, including high cost of obtaining and housing camels, limit the utility of this model for MERS-CoV vaccine development. Dr. Darryl Falzarano from the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) presented a lower-cost alternative model in alpacas, a new world camelid. Previous work had demonstrated seropositivity for MERS-CoV in alpacas [13] . Furthermore, Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4), the cell surface receptor for MERS-CoV, is highly conserved between alpacas and camels, and alpaca kidney epithelial cells can be infected ex vivo [14] . Dr. Falzarano reported that MERS-CoV replicated to high titers in alpacas that were intranasally-and/or intratracheally-infected with MERS-CoV. Irrespective of route of administration, all animals had MERS-CoV RNA and infectious virus in nasal swabs, and seroconverted following infection, and there were no signs of clinical disease. Finally, Dr. Falzarano demonstrated that initial infection by the combined route offers protection from subsequent infection (as measured by viral RNA levels recovered from nasal swabs), suggesting that alpacas are a suitable alternative model for assessment of vaccine efficacy and prevention of virus shedding.",

These high mutation rates are a major driver of RNA virus evolution, and the rapid emergence of adaptive mutations that affect tropism, virulence, fitness and drug resistance. Ex-patriate Canadian Dr. Marco Vignuzzi from the Pasteur Institute presented his approach to combine experimental evolution with mathematical modeling to determine the evolutionary trajectory of RNA virus mutants [15, 16] . Deep sequencing data, combined with bioinformatics, permitted representation of mutations in 2D space, while fitness is represented in the third dimension. Using these approaches, Dr. Vignuzzi demonstrated that a virus' sequence 'space' pre-determines its evolutionary trajectory, and altering this space can be used to attenuate viruses for vaccine development.",

Indeed, some individuals fail to clear subsequent infections despite pre-existing HCV-specific memory T lymphocytes. As a graduate student at CRCHUM, under the mentorship of Dr. Naglaa Shoukry, Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Hakeem demonstrated that viral persistence upon HCV reinfection was associated with limited expansion of virus-specific T cells, whereas protection correlated with expansion of broad sets of HCV-specific T lymphocytes [17] . By conducting longitudinal T cell receptor analysis and creating and characterizing CD8 T cell clones from sorted cells, Dr. Abdel-Hakeem discovered that protective immunity upon HCV reinfection was associated with focusing of the repertoire of HCV-specific CD8 T cells recruited from the memory pool whereby clonotypes with the highest functional avidity were selected [18] . These studies have implications for the rational design of HCV vaccines.",

The molecular mechanisms of Nef-mediated alterations in protein trafficking remain incompletely understood. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to detect interactions between Nef and MHC-I, Brennan Dirk (Western University) reported that Nef/MHC-I complexes localize to Rab5-positive early endosomes and the trans-Golgi network, but not to the lysosomal compartment [19, 20] . Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that residues Y320 and D327 in the carboxy-terminal tail of MHC-I were essential to maintain complex formation with Nef. These studies reveal that Nef interacts with the cytosolic tail of MHC-I to divert it from recycling endosomes to Rab5-positive early endosomes, highlighting the importance of the early endocytic network in the removal of MHC-I from the surface of infected cells.",

Using pseudotyped murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) bearing EboV glycoproteins to screen for small molecules that could selectively block infection, led to the identification of several molecules that function in the low micromolar range. Ms. Warkentin presented her findings that a lead molecule, Compound 1.0, blocked infection of native EboV, as well as a variety of MLVs pseudotyped with entry glycoproteins from Lassa fever virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Junin virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The related filovirus, Marburgvirus, was resistant to Compound 1.0. Virus attachment was unperturbed, suggesting that Compound 1.0 might be targeting a common host entry factor required for a post-attachment step.",

Dr. Miller described the limitations of current multivalent seasonal vaccines and the monovalent 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine that had negligible effect on the spread of virus due to the rate of vaccine production and distribution. These factors have necessitated new approaches to vaccine development. The discovery of bnAbs that target the highly-conserved stalk domain of hemagglutinin have raised hopes for vaccines capable of conferring \"universal\" immunity against influenza viruses. These antibodies are normally made in low quantities, but can be substantially boosted through exposure to \"pandemic-like\" hemagglutinin (HA) proteins [25] [26] [27] , and by overcoming the immunodominance of HA head domains [28] . By focusing research efforts on natural, polyclonal responses, Dr. Miller has discovered that both antibody isotype and specificity have major consequences on bnAb function. Specifically, stalk-binding antibodies of IgA isotype have a greater capacity to neutralize virus [29] , and Fc-dependent effector functions of bnAbs are regulated by interactions among multiple antibody specificities [30] . These findings are likely to have profound implications for the successful generation of \"universal\" influenza virus vaccines and therapeutics.",

Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology led to the identification of four novel Amdoparvoviral species, igniting new studies of molecular pathogenesis and epidemiology [31, 32] . Dr. Marta Canuti (Memorial University of Newfoundland) presented studies of AMDV molecular epidemiology in farmed and wild animals in Newfoundland, and contrasted this data with worldwide AMDV phylogeography and evolution. AMDV was highly prevalent in Newfoundland farmed and wild mink, with high diversity within single farms, high co-infection rates, farm-specific recombinants and polymorphisms within single infected individuals. Finally, the predominance of negative selection pressure on AMDV proteins was observed [33] . Dr. Canuti documented the movement of viruses between farms and the wild but also the existence of a wild-specific lineage. Globally, viruses from different countries fell within the same clades but formed country-specific subclades. These studies indicate that high AMDV prevalence in farms facilitates co-infections that favor viral recombination, further increasing viral diversity. AMDV moves from farms to the wild and is exchanged between different farms and countries, with subsequent evolution of parallel lineages generated by rapidly evolving viruses.",

An E1E2 vaccine derived from a single gt1a strain (HCV-1) has been shown to elicit bnAbs in guinea pigs, chimpanzees, goats, and healthy human volunteers [34] [35] [36] . Epitope mapping studies revealed that immunized goat and human antisera competed with bnAb binding, and competed especially well with bnAbs known to block the interaction between E2 and the major cell entry receptor CD81 [36] . Indeed, HCV-1 E1E2-based vaccines directly blocked the E2-CD81 interaction. Collectively, these studies suggest that immunizing with HCV envelope glycoproteins elicits nAbs that block early stages of HCV entry. These results support the use of such a vaccine antigen to induce cross-genotype neutralization.",
