            "text": "Viral infections cause many different diseases stemming both from well-characterized viral pathogens but also from emerging viruses, and the search for novel viruses continues to be of great importance. High-throughput sequencing is an important technology for this purpose. However, viral nucleic acids often constitute a minute proportion of the total genetic material in a sample from infected tissue. Techniques to enrich viral targets in high-throughput sequencing have been reported, but the sensitivity of such methods is not well established. This study compares different library preparation techniques targeting both DNA and RNA with and without virion enrichment. By optimizing the selection of intact virus particles, both by physical and enzymatic approaches, we assessed the effectiveness of the specific enrichment of viral sequences as compared to non-enriched sample preparations by selectively looking for and counting read sequences obtained from shotgun sequencing. Using shotgun sequencing of total DNA or RNA, viral targets were detected at concentrations corresponding to the predicted level, providing a foundation for estimating the effectiveness of virion enrichment. Virion enrichment typically produced a 1000-fold increase in the proportion of DNA virus sequences. For RNA virions the gain was less pronounced with a maximum 13-fold increase. This enrichment varied between the different sample concentrations, with no clear trend. Despite that less sequencing was required to identify target sequences, it was not evident from our data that a lower detection level was achieved by virion enrichment compared to shotgun sequencing.",

Recently, novel viruses such as influenza A H7N9 variants [3, 4] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [5, 6] have been discovered. Both of these cases exemplify the importance of continued surveillance for new pathogens, due to the risk of outbreaks or epidemics. Furthermore, viral infections are believed to cause approximately 15-20% of human cancers [7] . The known oncogenic viruses belong to highly divergent virus genera and include human papillomaviruses (HPVs), hepatitis B and C virus, Epstein-Barr virus, Merkel cell polyomavirus, human T celllymphotropic virus type-1 and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus [8, 9] . As the etiology of many cancers is still unknown, it is not unlikely that yet unidentified oncogenic viruses exist that infect humans, and it is therefore important that methods for the discovery of novel viruses are continually developed and improved.",

Traditionally, viruses have been discovered using immunochemical methods, electron microscopy and cell culture. Molecular methods such as PCR and microarrays have been employed more recently [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, most sensitive molecular methods are also highly specific, and require prior knowledge of the target sequence.

Virion nucleic acid enrichment by physical removal of host material may be combined with subsequent specific amplification of target nucleic acids either before or after preparation of the sequencing libraries [14, [17] [18] [19] . Virion enrichment utilizes the characteristic that viral genomes are protected by protein capsids, and for some viruses also a lipid envelope. Centrifugation of homogenized samples followed by filtration removes host cells and cellular debris. Leftover unprotected host nucleic acids can be removed with nucleases, theoretically leaving only enriched encapsidated viral DNA and RNA for extraction [20, 21] . Furthermore, target enrichment may be obtained by hybridization of specific probes to the viral target DNA/RNA [15, 22] or capture of host material using specific probes for subtractive hybridisation [23] . However, the use of such methods requires some knowledge to the sequences of the target and can thus be biased.",

The relevant libraries were all negative for viral sequences when tested in sensitive target-specific qPCR, suggesting that laboratory inter-sample contamination was unlikely. Furthermore, extensive shotgun sequencing of samples not sharing lanes (>1.4\u00d710 8 reads) showed no indications of contamination. Together this argues that the reads appear as an artefact of misreading of clusters or indexes during sequencing of several samples per lane. It has been shown that low numbers of contaminating reads can be extremely difficult to avoid. In a carefully controlled study up to 5000 parts per million (ppm) of all indexed reads were misinterpreted during Illumina sequencing, contributed also by carry-over of indexes during laboratory handling, or manufacturing of oligonucleotides [43] . Here, the observed level of artefact sequences range between 0.48-48 ppm (Table 5) , which is probably to be expected when processing samples containing high virus concentrations together with negative controls. In this study all negative samples producing viral reads, were sequenced together with the sample with the highest concentration of those particular viruses. However, when using these sequencing methods for viral discovery, where high viral titres are the exception, the risk of contaminating reads may be negligible.",

With shotgun RNA sequencing we detected EV down to a concentration of 125 copies/\u03bcl starting material. These findings indicate that the employed DNA and RNA HTS techniques in this study may be equally sensitive, and only less sensitive than the level reported with target pre-amplification [44] [45] [46] The coverage of the MeV plasmid was low in all samples upon DNA shotgun sequencing. Even for the highest concentrations of MeV plasmid (700 copies/\u03bcl) the coverage reached merely 26%, indicating that plasmid DNA may be difficult to detect by DNA shotgun sequencing. Preliminary experiments have shown that plasmids of a similar size and quality may be resistant to fragmentation by sonication (using a Bioruptor) performed prior to building the DNA library. We speculate that this resistance is caused by super-coiling which could explain the low number of reads detected by DNA shotgun sequencing. Other methods targeting circular DNA, such as \u03c629-mediated amplification [48, 49] , have proven highly efficient in selective amplification of circular DNA virus genomes [50] .",

Likewise, the fraction used for virion-enriched RNA libraries was nuclease-digested prior to extraction, during which some loss of RNA may occur.

All RNA libraries were prepared using ScriptSeq v2. It was difficult to estimate the potential impact of the different library kits. A place to look for differences could be the fragment lengths of the prepared libraries. The fragment lengths within the RNA libraries were approximately the same fluctuating between 150 and 500 bp with an average length of 350 bp. For the shotgun DNA libraries the fragment length within the libraries varied between 150 bp and 1000 bp. The same applied to the virion-enriched libraries; however, they tended to peak at around 200 bp, where the shotgun library fragment lengths were evenly distributed and thus in general longer than the virion-enriched libraries. This could indicate a small difference in the performance of the kits, however we assume this difference was negligible.

The results showed that enrichment of virion-associated DNA was successful and typically increased viral target sequences by three orders of magnitude. For the virion-associated RNA, viral target reads was increased up to 13 fold. The viral concentration seemed to have limited effect on the degree of DNA or RNA enrichment (Fig 4) . Hall et al., 2013 [27] has previously characterized the effects of virionenrichment on viral targets, using an enrichment approach similar to ours, with centrifugation, filtration and nuclease treatments. They showed that HAdV copynumbers were not affected by their enrichment treatments but that EV copynumbers were reduced 100 fold by enrichment procedures. The sequencing of EV yielded a 20-fold increase compared to samples that were not subjected to enrichment procedures, which is similar to what we detected.

Viral titres may vary, and may be high in acutely infected patients, but more often, viruses will be present in rather low titres. When using shotgun sequencing the major expense is currently the sequencing reagents, whereas virion enrichment is more labour-intensive and has additional reagent costs. Shotgun sequencing can be cost-prohibitive, but given the continually decreasing prices for HTS [24] , it may become the most appealing future virus discovery approach.",
