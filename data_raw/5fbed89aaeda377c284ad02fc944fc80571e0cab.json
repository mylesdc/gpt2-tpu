Recently, we engineered a soluble one domain CD4 (mD1.22) which can bind and neutralize all tested isolates as a component of a bispecific multivalent protein 9 . Thus, we have hypothesized that a bispecific fusion protein containing mD1.22 fused to an antibody arm that binds to CD16A on NK cells, not only would presumably neutralize all HIV-1 isolates but also could guide and activate natural killer (NK) cells to find and kill HIV-1 infected cells expressing its envelope glycoprotein (Env, gp120-gp41) at their surface. The capability of NK cells to kill target cells specifically by using bispecific antibodies to both CD16 and target cells was demonstrated Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 Scientific RepoRts | 7: 9130 | more than 30 years ago 10 .

Decreasing the size of the proteins can dramatically increase their effective diffusion coefficients, e.g., decreasing the size from 150 kDa to about 15 kDa can increase the diffusion through normal solid tissue about 100-fold 12 . Therefore, in an attempt to decrease the size of BiKEs we also used antibody domain binders to CD16A which we recently identified and described 13 . We have hypothesized that BiKEs generated by fusing the one domain CD4 through a flexible linker to an antibody domain binder to CD16A would have relatively small size which could allow them to effectively penetrate tissues and guide the NK cells to kill HIV-1 infected cells.",

Furthermore, these BiKEs mediated effective killing of HIV-1 infected T cells by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To our knowledge these are the first human domain-based BiKEs and the first against HIV-1 based on CD4; we found only one other report published as an extended abstract about BiKEs against HIV-1 based on an anti-CD16A llama domain and the VRC01 Fab 18 . The possibility that our CD4-based BiKEs can bind all HIV-1 isolates, their small size and fully human origin, combined with their high-affinity and specific, activating interactions with CD16A resulting in lysis of HIV-1 infected cells suggest that they are promising candidate therapeutics and worth of further evaluation in animal models and potentially in humans for therapy of HIV-1 infections with the final goal of its eradication.",

Similar high affinity binding was also measured by using ELISA although the EC 50 s were somewhat lower (0.8 vs. 8.2 nM) (Fig. 2c) . These two BiKEs also retained their high affinity (EC 50 , ~1 nM) binding to gp140sc through its mD1.22 arm as measured by ELISA (Fig. 2d) .

Interestingly, the fluorescence shift for BiKEs binding to CHO-ZA-gp160sc cells was substantially larger than binding to 293T-gp160sc cells, which is consistent with binding of other two Env binders, b12 19 and LSEVh-LS-F 20 , to these two cell lines (Supplemental Fig. 1 ) and indicated that CHO-ZA cells expressed higher level of surface-associated gp160sc than 293 T cells did after transfection.

We assessed whether the BiKEs, after engaging cell surface CD16A, could mediate functional activation of CD16A expressing Jurkat T cells (Jurkat T-CD16A cells) by monitoring their activation and cytokine (IL-2) secretion. In Jurkat T-CD16A cells, engagement of CD16A initiates activation signals through the CD3-\u03b6 chain, ultimately leading to de-phosphorylation of NTAFp (Nuclear factor of activated T-cells) and expression of luciferase (Promega, ADCC Reporter Bioassay). Thus, the activation signals could be monitored by testing luciferase activity. To compare the ADCC capacities of BiKEs and IgG1-Fc, we also measured the ADCC activation signals mediated by mD1.22-Fc, an Fc fusion protein with bivalent mD1.22. BiKEs and mD1.22-Fc can specifically activate Jurkat T-CD16A cells in the presence of 293T-gp160 SC cells (Fig. 4a) . The incubation of BiKEs with Jurkat T-CD16A cells in the absence of target cells or in the presence of 293 T cells non-expressing gp160 could not induce luciferase signals, demonstrating the high specificities of these BiKEs. Importantly, they can activate Jurkat T-CD16A cells at low concentrations (50% RLU at 0.2 nM). In this case the activity of mbk6 was higher than that of mbk11 and mD1.22-Fc indicating a correlation of binding affinity of BiKEs to CD16A (mD1.22-Fc < mbk11 < mbk6) with their functional activity.",

Co-incubation of Jurkat T-CD16A cells with BiKEs opsonized 293T-gp160 SC cells resulted in release of IL-2 (Fig. 4b) , which is consistent with the results obtained by using a positive control, bivalent 3G8. By contrast, the BiKEs alone or incubated with 293 T cells, or 293T-gp160 SC alone did not induce IL-2 secretion, demonstrating the high specificity of these BiKEs. The higher affinity mbk6 induced more IL-2 than mbk11 (p = 0.022) but less than 3G8, which again indicates that there could be correlation between affinity/avidity and cytokine release activity. However, when T cells were stimulated by 293T-gp160 SC cells, mbk6 was almost as effective as 3G8 suggesting a role for avidity effects. These results demonstrate that both BiKEs could specifically engage CD16A on the effector cell surface, and activate signals leading to cytokine release. NK cells degranulation mediated by BiKEs. Next we measured BiKE-mediated degranulation of NK cells in the presence of CHO-ZA-gp160 SC cells. NK degranulation was evaluated by monitoring CD107a and IFN\u03b3 expression levels after incubation with BiKE-opsonized target cells. To assess the specificity of these BiKEs, we used three negative controls: NK cells incubation with BiKEs in the absence of target cells, in the presence of HIV-1 Env negative cells or NK cells incubation with target cells in the absence of BiKEs. NK cells stimulated with PMA/ionomycin were used as a positive control. The CD107a staining results (Fig. 5a ) clearly showed that both mbk6 and mbk11 induced significant NK cell degranulation compared to the negative controls (Fig. 5a,b) .",

It should be also noted that the CHO-ZA-gp160 SC cells and CHO-ZA cells in the absence of BiKEs also could induce relatively weak NK cells degranulation, which may result from killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) recognition of Env or other ligands on target cells 21 . This is independent on CD16A mediated NK cells engagement. Induced expression of intracellular IFN\u03b3 was also observed although the level was not as high as the CD107a expression (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). This is consistent with previous observation that CD107a is a more comprehensive and sensitive marker of NK cells activation than cytokine secretion 22 . It should be noted that our CD107a and IFN-\u03b3 levels are lower than those induced by the VRCO1 based BiKEs 18 , which may result from the different experimental conditions such as different Env expression levels or NK cells donors or incubation time. These results demonstrate that BiKEs can specifically engage NK cells in the presence of gp160-expressing target cells.",

Besides, during HIV-1 infection and progression, the phenotype of NK cells can shift from cytokine secretion CD56 high population to CD16 high phenotype with expanded cytotoxicity along with diminished CXCR4 and CCR5 expression 28 , indicating that NK cells are effective effector cells against HIV-1. In addition, NK mediated cell killing mediated by CD16A doesn't rely on KIR/HLA-I matching or is not subjected to inhibition by other NK cells inhibitory receptors for which HIV-1 has evolved strategies to escape 24 .

Unlike the typical BiKEs consisting of two tandem single chain variable fragments (scFv), which usually encounter undesirable expression and folding issues 33 , our BiKEs only contain two immunoglobulin domains with total molecular weight of ~ 28 kD (Fig. 1b) . This simple format renders our BiKEs with high expression in E. coli (50 mg/L) and homogenous folding in solution (Fig. 1c) . To our knowledge, these are the first BiKEs reported which are entirely based on domains and therefore are of relatively very small size. The small size is important because their penetration in normal tissues including lymphoid tissue where HIV-1 mostly replicates could be significantly higher than antibody fragments and antibody fusion proteins. For example, a previous study has shown that a full size antibody (IgG1) of MW about 150 kDa has an effective diffusion coefficient about 100-fold lower in solid tissues than molecules 10-fold smaller 12 . Therefore, the effect of size could be significant. Our BiKEs are also fully human and may not exhibit immunogenicity if administered to humans. However, only further experiments in animal models of HIV-1 infection and ultimately human clinical trials will show whether they are immunogenic or not, and if immunogenic how immunogenic they are. Previously, a llama antibody domain that binds with high affinity to CD16A was identified 16 and used for generation of two BiKEs targeting carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 34 and Her2 35 . These BiKEs were successful in CD16A mediated lysis of target cells thus demonstrating for the first time that antibody domains are functional as components of BiKEs. Here, we present evidence confirming such statement and further expanding it with the use of fully human domains fused to another human protein domain (mD1.22).",

Interestingly, in these assays, mbk6 could engage effector cells more efficiently than mbk11, and mbk11 was more effective than mD1.22-Fc, which correlates with their CD16A binding affinity: mbk6 (~1 nM) > mbk11 (~21 nM) > Fc (0.1-1 \u03bcM). These results indicate that binding affinity of mbk6, mbk11 and mD1.22-Fc to CD16A correlates with their functional efficacy, given their identical epitopes on gp120 (CD4 binding site) and similar epitopes on CD16A 13 . Therefore, one could speculate that our high affinity BiKEs could function more effectively than HIV-1 bnAbs with CD4 binding site epitopes although we did not compare side by side the ADCC efficacy of BiKEs and bnAbs in this study.",

The high affinity to CD16A of BiKEs could result in binding to NK cells even when the CD16A expression level is low. Another consideration is that NK cells in the solid lymphoid organs and mucosae, where HIV-1 mostly replicates, are mainly CD56 pos phenotype, rather than the cytotoxic CD16 pos due to the decreased expression of the tissue-homing receptors on CD16 pos NK cells during the HIV-1 progression 28, 38 . The high affinity to CD16A could maximize the engagement of the low CD16 pos cell number in solid lymphoid tissues to kill HIV-1-infected cells. It can be also important in cases when the Env is expressed at low surface concentrations especially in chronically and latently infected cells 39 . Therefore, the high binding affinity of our BiKEs to both CD16A and gp120 could be important for their in vivo efficacy.",

All results, including activation and cytokine secretion by Jurkat T-CD16A cells, NK cell degranulation and killing of Env-expressing cells or HIV-1 infected cells, consistently were highly dependent on the presence of both BiKEs and target cells. BiKEs alone could neither activate Jurkat T-CD16A, nor induce degranulation of NK cells. Co-incubation of target cells with effector cells in the absence of BiKEs or co-incubation of Env-negative control cells with effector cells in the presence of BiKEs could not lead to the target cell killing. Although in the NK cell degranulation assays, co-incubation of NK cells with CHO-ZA-gp160 SC cells in the absence of BiKEs did induce very low expression of CD107A, it may result from the direct engagement of other receptors on NK cell surface such as KIRs and NCRs 21, 24 , which is independent of CD16A and BiKEs. Of note is that we have previously shown that one-domain CD4 (mD1.22) doesn't bind MHC class II molecules 9 . Thus, our data suggest that the activity of these BiKEs is highly specific.",

The Sfi I digested BiKE gene were then subcloned into Sfi I linearized pComb3X vector containing an in-frame C terminal 6 \u00d7 His tag followed by a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK). The recombinant BiKE plasmids were expressed in HB2151 cells and were purified by one-step Ni-NTA chromatography. The purity was checked by SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1b) , and the homogeneity was confirmed by Superdex 75 10/300 GL chromatography (GE Healthcare, Cat. No. 17-5174-01) (Fig. 1c) . The column was calibrated with protein molecular mass standards of 1.355 kDa B12, 6.5 kDa aprotinin, 13.7 kDa ribonuclease, 43 kDa ovalbumin and 67 kDa BSA. Purified BiKEs in PBS were loaded into a pre-equilibrated column and eluted with PBS at 0.5 ml/ min. Protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically (NanoVue, GE Healthcare). The protein was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. We noticed that storage could change its properties but not to significant degree to affect conclusions.",

Target cells were plated on 96-well plates at a density of 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells in 25 \u03bcL RPMI1640 complete medium per well. 50 \u03bcL of BiKEs or mD1.22-Fc 5-fold serially diluted from initial concentration of 50 nM was added into each well. Then the effector cells were added at a density of 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 cells in 25 ul RPMI1640 complete medium per well for a target: effector cell ratio of 1: 6. The assay was developed after 6-h or overnight incubation at 37 o C by using the Promega Bio-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Cat. No.: G7941) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
