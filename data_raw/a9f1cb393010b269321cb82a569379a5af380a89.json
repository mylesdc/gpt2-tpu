With the developments of sequencing technologies, a large number of protein sequences increase exponentially in the public databases. Famous sequences' comparison methods are alignment based. ey generally give excellent results when the sequences under study are closely related and they are time consuming. Herein, a new alignment-free method is introduced. Our technique depends on a new graphical representation and descriptor. e graphical representation of protein sequence is a simple way to visualize protein sequences. e descriptor compresses the primary sequence into a single vector composed of only two values. Our approach gives good results with both short and long sequences within a little computation time. It is applied on nine beta globin, nine ND5 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5), and 24 spike protein sequences. Correlation and significance analyses are also introduced to compare our similarity/dissimilarity results with others' approaches, results, and sequence homology.",

Dynamic representation is used to remove degeneracies in the previously mentioned approaches [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .

Each amino acid in the protein sequence is represented by a number, and a new 2D graphical representation is suggested. A new descriptor is introduced, comprising a vector composed of the mean and standard deviation of the total numbers of each protein sequence (A t , SA t ). Our graphical representation eliminates degeneracy and has no loss of information. It is suitable for both short and long sequences. As a proof of concept, our approach is applied on nine beta globin protein sequences and nine ND5 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5) protein sequences. It can be applied on any sequence length with the same efficiency. Correlation and significance analyses are introduced among our results, along with PID% [15] and ClustalW [33] to demonstrate the utility of our approach.",

Each amino acid in a given protein sequence has its own intensity and intensity level. ey are vectors of N elements as N is the protein sequence length. e combined intensity level is then computed and graphed to represent any protein sequence graphically. Our 2D graphical representation effectively displays differences between protein sequences without degeneracies. e graph does not overlap or intersect with itself. Our new descriptor suggested a vector of two elements, which are the mean and standard deviation of the combined intensity level (A t and SA t ). A similarity/dissimilarity analysis is evaluated by computing Euclidean distance between each two species' descriptors. Examination of similarity/dissimilarity among nine beta globin, nine ND5, and 24 coronaviruses protein sequences provided good results compared to previous approaches. e suggested approach is effective for both short and long sequences, and the computations are very simple. Furthermore, loss of sequence information is avoided. Correlation and significance analyses with PID% and ClustalW are also introduced to show the utility of our approach.",
