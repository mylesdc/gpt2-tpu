            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), belonging to the coronaviridae family, is the key cause of the fatal diarrhea of piglets and results in many pathological processes. microRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in the regulation of virus-induced apoptosis. During the process of apoptosis induced by TGEV infection in PK-15 cells, the miR-27b is notably down-regulated. Thus, we speculate that miR-27b is involved in regulating the process of apoptosis in PK-15 cells. In this study we demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-27b led to the inhibition of TGEV-induced apoptosis, reduction of Bax protein level, and decrease of caspase-3 and \u22129 activities. Conversely, silencing of miR-27b by miR-27b inhibitors enhanced apoptosis via up-regulating Bax expression and promoting the activities of caspase-3 and \u22129 in TGEV-infected cells. Subsequently, the runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) is a candidate target of miR-27b predicted by bioinformatics search. We further identified that the miR-27b directly bound to the 3 UTR of RUNX1 mRNA and suppressed RUNX1 expression, which indicates RUNX1 is the direct target gene of miR-27b. The over-expression of RUNX1 increased apoptosis and knockdown RUNX1blocked apoptosis of viral-infected cells via regulating Bax expression and the activities of caspase-3 and \u22129. Our data reveal that miR-27b may repress the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by targeting RUNX1, indicating that TGEV may induce apoptosis via down-regulating miR-27b and that miR-27b may act as a target for therapeutic intervention.

            "text": "miRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules and may regulate gene expression at post-transcription level (Bartel, 2009) . Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that miRNAs play important roles in cell apoptosis (Wilson & Doudna, 2013) . miR-29b effectively inhibits apoptosis via directly targeting caspase-7 and nuclear apoptosis inducing factor 1 (NAIF1) in Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cells infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) (Fu et al., 2014) . miR-27b promotes doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) (Mu et al., 2015) . Moreover, miR-27b is an endogenous inhibitory factor of apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) expression and decreases the apoptotic rate of neurons (Chen et al., 2014) . miRNAs are also involved in regulating the process of virus-induced apoptosis (Smith et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013) . Hs_154 promotes WNV-mediated apoptosis via inhibiting the expression of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Smith et al., 2012) . Our previous studies showed that miR-27b was significantly down-regulated during TGEV-induced apoptosis (Song et al., 2015) . Thus, we supposed that miR-27b may play a role in apoptosis induced by TGEV infection. In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-27b in TGEV-induced apoptosis in PK-15 cells and demonstrated that the miR-27b attenuated TGEV-induced apoptosis by targeting RUNX1, suggesting TGEV may use miR-27b to regulate apoptosis in PK-15 cells.",

The apoptotic rate was analyzed by flow cytometry at 24 and 48 hpi. The results showed that the over-expression of miR-27b led to a decrease of apoptotic rate and the down-expression of miR-27b increased apoptotic rate at 24 and 48 hpi (Fig. 1A) , indicating that miR-27b attenuated apoptosis induced by TGEV infection in PK-15 cells. We previously found that TGEV infection could cause PK-15 cell apoptosis through mitochondria-mediated pathway and FasL-mediated apoptotic pathway ( Ding et al., 2012) . Therefore, we analyzed caspase-9 activity of mitochondria-mediated pathway and caspase-8 activity of FasL-mediated apoptotic pathway. However, miR-27b did not affect the caspase-8 activity during TGEV infection (data not shown). As expected, the caspase-9 activity was decreased by miR-27b mimics and up-regulated by miR-27b inhibitors in the TGEV-infected PK-15 cells (Fig. 1B) . Moreover, we investigated the effect of miR-27b on caspases-3 activity in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells. The caspase-3 activity was decreased by miR-27b mimics and increased by miR-27b inhibitors in the TGEV-infected cells compared with control (Fig. 1C) . Taken together, these results suggest that miR-27b plays a negative role in the TGEV-induced apoptosis in PK-15 cells via mitochondria-mediated pathway.",

The sequence of the 3 UTR of RUNX1 was obtained by PCR and the two binding sites of miR-27b seed region in the 3 UTR of RUNX1 were mutated with a 3-bp substitution. The 3 UTR of RUNX1 and its mutational version were respectively sub-cloned into the 3 UTR of the Renilla luciferase dual-luciferase plasmid psiCHECK-2 ( Figs. 2A and 2B ). The constructs were co-transfected into PK-15 cells with miR-27b mimics (or negative control) or miR-27b inhibitors (or negative control). Compared with the miRNA mimics control, introduction of miR-27b mimics decreased the RUNX1-WT reporter activity (Fig. 2C) . To determine whether miR-27b inhibits RUNX1 expression, miR-27b mimics or miRNA mimics control were transfected into PK-15 cells. RUNX1 expression was assessed by western blot.

We assessed the effects of miR-27b on the replication and transcription of TGEV genes and found that the replication and transcription of TGEV structural and non-structural genes were not affected by miR-27b (Data not shown). We tested the effects of miR-27b on apoptotic rate of TGEV-infected PK-15 cells. The results showed that miR-27b decreased TGEV-induced apoptosis. We previously reported that miR-27b was decreased by TGEV infection (Song et al., 2015) , so we propose that miR-27b may present an antagonistic effect with TGEV infection on apoptosis via regulating mitochondrial pathway. An analogous situation has been reported that miR-27b alleviate hypoxia-induced neuronal apoptosis (Chen et al., 2014) . It indicates that miR-27b not only down-regulates cancer cell apoptosis, it also suppresses virus-induced apoptosis.",

In this study, we showed that miR-27b inhibited Bax expression and reduced the activities of caspase-9 and -3 during TGEV-induced apoptosis.

The imprecise binding make each miRNA has the ability to target multiple mRNAs. For example, miR-27b could suppress adipogenesis in hMADS cells by targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3 ) (Karbiener et al., 2009 ) and promote differentiation of myeloblasts through targeting RUNX1 (Feng et al., 2009 ). In the present study, we confirmed that RUNX1 is the target of miR-27b during TGEV infection, while whether miR-27b regulates apoptosis via RUNX1 is unclear. RUNX1 is a transcription factor, and play important roles in regulating the growth, development, and/or differentiation of multiple lineages of haematopoietic cells (Feng et al., 2009) . We found over-expression of RUNX1 reduced Bax and decreased the activities of caspase-9 and -3, and silencing RUNX1 up-regulated Bax and increased the activities of caspase-9 and -3. This suggests that miR-27b regulates TGEV-induced apoptosis via targeting RUNX1, which is an important supplement of RUNX1 function.",
