We analyzed a total of 450 fecal samples from eleven wolf packs belonging to three protected populations, in Italy (Abruzzo), France (Mercantour), and the United States (Yellowstone). We collected samples during two consecutive winters in each study area. We found no relationship between FCM concentrations and age, sex or social status of individuals. At the group level, our results suggest that breeding pair permanency and the loss of pack members through processes different from dispersal may importantly impact stress levels in wolves. We measured higher FCM levels in comparatively small packs living in sympatry with a population of free-ranging dogs. Lastly, our results indicate that FCM concentrations are associated with endoparasitic infections of individuals. groups remains largely unknown in free-ranging social species. Indeed, most studies of the causes of stress in social species focused on the impact of aggressive interactions and of factors related to dominance hierarchies [29] .",

            "text": "Wolves are highly social and typically live in family-based packs consisting of a mated pair and their offspring of the past 1 to 4.5 years [44, 45] . In a stable pack, dominance relationships are typically age-graded, with the parents being naturally the top ranking (hereafter 'dominant') individuals, and the only breeding members of the pack [46] . Multiple litters within a group may however occur, particularly when one or both of the original breeders are lost, or in newly founded packs [47] [48] [49] [50] . When former breeders become no longer reproductively active before their death, they may keep taking part in all other activities of the group [46] . Mating season takes place once a year during late winter. Most males and females usually reach sexual maturity as yearlings at about 22 months of age [51, 52] . Despite all sexually mature females of a pack having a normal estrous cycle and ovulating [46, 51, 53] , wolves are essentially monogamous and the breeding partners of established packs often pair for a lifetime [46, 47] . After 61-64 days of gestation [52] , an average of 4-6 pups are born in April-May, which greatly benefit from extended alloparental care by the pack members of both sexes [44, 46] . While growing up in the pack, the offspring learn social communication, hunting and foraging strategies, and gradually take part in the rearing of pups and territorial defense [44, 46] . Most wolves disperse from their natal pack between 9 and 36 months of age [46] , alone or in groups, with little known consistent difference between males and females in dispersal characteristics [44] . Dispersers may be accepted in existing packs, in particular after the loss of a breeding partner [44, 45, 54] . Although packs appear socially less cohesive in summer compared to winter [55], the litter of pups is the social core of the group [44, 56] and the social status of dominant individuals does not change throughout the year. Pack members may repeatedly leave and return to their natal pack at any time of the year, before ultimately dispersing. Dispersal most often takes place in fall, or from mid-winter to early spring, i.e. between the mating and the denning seasons [44] .",

No conclusive link between stress levels and within-pack agonistic encounters could be concluded from these studies, but they reported an increase of GCs during the annual mating season [57], at least in some individuals [58] . To our knowledge, social or territorial stability of packs was never investigated as a potential stressor in wolves. Since direct confrontations with neighboring packs can be severely injurious [44, 46] , stress levels might depend on the density of the population at a regional scale [31], pack size, and the overall duration of extra-territorial travels. Wolves are well adapted to winter conditions [60] , and previous investigations found no relationship between GCs levels and snow pack or minimum temperature [57] . In addition, no seasonal or circadian variation in GCs concentrations has been found in the species [53, 58] . Snowmobile activity was associated with elevated FCM levels in wolves [27] , and is the only anthropogenic stressor investigated in free-ranging populations that we are aware of.",

The potential impact of social and territorial stability on stress levels should be further investigated in free-ranging populations, especially in highly social and in territorial species. As persistent or repeated stressors may facilitate or induce pathologies and physiological alterations that can affect survival and fitness, we advocate considering the Introduction When confronted with a physical or psychological stressor that threatens their integrity [1, 2] , animals react with numerous physiological and behavioral responses to cope with the situation and reestablish homeostasis [3, 4] . The glucocorticoids (GCs) cortisol and corticosterone are front-line stress hormones [5] . While adaptive in the short-term, chronic elevated GCs levels consecutive to a prolonged or repeated exposure to a stressor become deleterious [2, [6] [7] [8] . Besides an immunosuppressive effect favoring pathogenic infections, chronic high cortisol concentrations can cause neuronal cell death, muscle and bone atrophy, poor wound healing, as well as inhibition of growth and reproduction [1, 6, 8, 9] . Even though exposure to persistent stress is therefore a weakening factor that can severely impair health and survival [2, 8, [10] [11] [12] , and may impact population dynamics through reduced resistance to diseases [13, 14] , the study of stress in free-ranging populations is still an emerging field of research [1, 15] .",

In accordance with this, previous studies of free-ranging social mammals and birds report a negative relationship between GCs levels and fitness [10] [11] [12] 14, 17] , though the direction of this relationship appears globally inconsistent across species [18] . Whereas a chronic stress response caused by high predation risk may be adaptive in prey species with intermediate life spans [19] , we are not aware of previous data suggesting an adaptive value of chronic or repeated stress in long-lived highly social predators such as wolves (Canis lupus). Recently developed non-invasive techniques enable the measurement of glucocorticoid metabolites in feces [2, 20, 21] , allowing large-scale and repeated investigations in free-ranging animals without affecting their behavior or physiology. Cortisol is the main secreted glucocorticoid in numerous mammals [13] , and fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) are successfully used as an index of stress in several species [15] , including the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) [22] .",

Environmental stressors identified in different mammals include anthropogenic disturbances [18, [25] [26] [27] [28] , extreme temperatures [1, 2] , elevated population density [29] [30] [31] , food limitation and infection by pathogens [8, 32] . At the individual level, GCs secretion can vary with age, sex, reproductive status or body condition [1, 2, 13] . Variations dependent on the temperament or personality of individuals were also suggested [1, [33] [34] [35] [36] . In social species, interactions with group members can also affect stress levels [37, 38] , while the relationship with social status remains variable or uncertain [7, 29, 34] . At the group level, an increase of FCM levels with group size was reported in lions (Panthera leo) [39] , while the effect of this factor varies with sex in ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) [40] . Low stress may correlate with the stability of the social environment [7, 38] . In particular, sudden changes such as the loss of an attachment figure, e.g. the mother or the mate in pair-bonding species [41, 42] , or the disruption of a strong relationship with a member of the group [43] are reported as important stressors. However, the impact of global social instability on established relation with wolf density, pack size, the presence of free-ranging dogs, and month, and (iv) investigated the possible relationship between FCM levels and endoparasitic infections.",

Snow-tracking sessions in wintertime, complemented in Mercantour by genetic analyses [67] , provided information on pack size (Table 3 ). In Yellowstone, we studied three different packs, selected based on the visibility of individuals and the accessibility of sample collection sites. To locate the packs, we relied on tracks, howls and bird activity near carcasses. We also collaborated with the local crew, who used telemetry. We monitored the packs daily, from dawn to dusk, whenever weather conditions and distance to the animals (approximately 100 to 1500 meters) allowed sufficiently detailed observation [76] .

In Yellowstone, main prey species were assessed through close monitoring of packs [48] [49] [50] 67] . c Abruzzo: [60] ; Mercantour: Millischer pers. comm.; Yellowstone: [72] . d Abruzzo: [73] ; Mercantour: Millischer pers. comm.; Yellowstone: [74] . e Wolves recovered in the study areas and adjacent areas expected to belong to the territory of wolf packs resident of the park.

Based on mtDNA and nuclear markers [80] , all fresh scats (n = 107) collected in Abruzzo from December 2005 to March 2006 were from wolves, except two samples from foxes. This provided a direct validation of the selection criteria adopted in this study area (98% accuracy). In Mercantour, systematic genetic analyses are performed on the samples to discriminate wolf scats from those of other species [81] . In both Abruzzo and Mercantour, in absence of snow, samples were collected at known scent posts or exploited carcasses, or during opportunistic surveys along trails [66, 67] . In Yellowstone, we collected fecal samples following direct observation and filming of contributing individuals. Daily monitoring allowed the selection of only those samples that stayed at or below freezing point from defecation to collection time. When an individual was observed defecating, we filmed the animal and the surrounding landscape in details (Canon XL-H1 camcorder, Canon EF Adapter XL, Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS USM photo lens, Canon Extender EF 2x II). On the same day, we visualized the recorded sequence on a computer and took relevant pictures of the computer screen with a digital still camera. The next day, or as soon as possible in accordance with park regulations, we collected fecal samples using the following procedure: We set a spotting scope at the exact place from where we filmed the defecating individual. From this place, one person guided a collaborator to the samples using walkietalkies, with the help of the pictures taken with the still camera. During these field trips, when no tracks of other canid species were found less than one meter away from the samples, we collected all scat found on wolf tracks. We abandoned sample collection when one or several wolves not belonging to the target pack were known to have used the area between scat production and collection time. This collection procedure provided information on the age, sex, social status and identity of a number of contributing individuals.",

As soon as thawed enough, we vigorously hand-mixed fecal samples for 1 min through the plastic bag. We then placed 1.55 \u00b1 0.05 g of feces in a plastic container, mixed with 10 ml of sodium acetate-acetic acid-formaldehyde (SAF) fixative [89] and kept the suspension at 4\u00b0C until it was tested. To detect protozoan cysts, helminth eggs and larvae, we used the following modified SAF concentration technique [89] : We filtered the fecal suspension through a strainer and centrifuged a 4 ml aliquot with 5 ml of physiologic solution (NaCl 0.85%) for 10 min at 500 x g. We removed the supernatant and resuspended the pellet in 6 ml of physiologic solution, and added 3 ml of ether. We vortexed the solution for 30 seconds, and then centrifuged it for 10 min at 500 x g. After removing the supernatant, we dissolved the pellet in a few drops of saline allowing adequate observation under the microscope. We prepared both stained and unstained preparations for each sample [90] . To obtain a stained preparation, we added a drop of 5 x diluted Lugol solution [91] to a drop of the concentrated fecal solution deposited on a slide. To observe unstained structures, we added a drop of saline to the concentrated fecal solution. After mixing with the corner of a coverslip (18x18 mm), the latter was used to cover the preparation. We examined each preparation by systematically scanning the entire coverslip at 100x magnification, using a calibrated Olympus BX50 microscope, and used 400x magnification to confirm each observation. We identified parasite eggs on the basis of their size, color, shape, look of content, and structure of the shell surface. Eggs and cysts were identified to genus or species level [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] , except for the Taeniidae family whose eggs cannot be discriminated by microscopic examination [93, 96] . Nematode larvae could not be identified and were not considered in the count of detected parasite taxa. We defined parasite richness as the number of different parasite taxa detected in a fecal sample.",

When candidate models were within \u0394AICc < 2, we estimated unbiased fixed-effects coefficients using model averaging [104, 105] . Averaged-coefficients in the final model were deemed significant when the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) did not include zero [104] .",

Higher FCM levels in January during pre-estrous in female wolves, compared to the other considered months, was also highlighted in these data. Considering our entire data set, we found that larger pack size is associated with lower FCM levels in the presence of a sympatric free-ranging dog population. We selected the protected wolf populations of Abruzzo, Mercantour and Yellowstone in order to exclude climatic differences [1, 2] and legal human-caused mortality that could bias our investigations. We standardized sample selection procedures and validated the cortisol EIA assay for wolf fecal samples. These precautions assured the reliability of the measured FCM concentrations, which therefore adequately reflect adrenocortical activity and stress levels in individuals and packs. Measured FCM concentrations in samples collected during the biological validation experiment and in samples collected in the study areas were within a similar range. We limited sample collection to colder months of the year as the best possible strategy to avoid bias caused by climatic factors in the measurement of FCM levels [13] . These precautions helped ensure consistency of the results and allowed the evaluation of the relationship between selected factors and FCM levels. Since no seasonal or circadian variation in cortisol level has been detected in wolves [53, 58] , we assumed no impact of the opportunistic collection procedure on our results.",

A detailed dietary analysis conducted on all wolf scats collected in Abruzzo [66] between January 2006 and October 2008 revealed important differences among the four studied packs in the prey species preferentially selected, be it in the winters of our study or during the rest of the year [66] . However, we found no significant difference among these packs in FCM levels globally measured in the data set from Abruzzo. Together, these data suggest that neither the overall diversity of consumed prey species, nor the preferential selection of specific prey species, affected FCM levels in the considered wolf populations. Lastly, if a hypothesized influence of GCs acquired through the consumption of prey [108] was demonstrated, we suggest that it would most likely be similar across our entire data set.",

Prior studies in this species failed to find differences in hormonal cycles between reproductive and non-reproductive individuals of the same sex, including between pregnant and non-pregnant females [46, 53] . Our results indicate that reproductive status does not likely have a direct influence on FCM levels in wolves. In agreement with this, previous studies found no variation of cortisol concentrations in female dogs relative to their reproductive status, reporting a peak in cortisol levels only during labor and at parturition [109, 110] . In our study, a likely elevation of FCM levels linked with parturition was not detectable, as delivery occurred outside the period of sample collection. That we found no difference in FCM levels between dominant and subordinate individuals supports [58] or contradicts [57, 59] previous conclusions. From an individual (male M302) that changed status from subordinate in the first winter to dominant in the second winter, we even measured two times lower FCM levels in the new leading position (as subordinate: 10.7 \u00b1 1.7, n = 2; as dominant: 5.1 \u00b1 1.1, n = 2), albeit based on a very small sample size. Individuals of different age, sex or social status might be exposed to stressors of different nature, which would translate into a similar effect on FCM levels. Alternatively, as reported in numerous species, our results suggest that variations in stress levels may be modulated by other factors related to individual differences, such as the personality or temperament [1, [33] [34] [35] [36] 111] , or the strength and/or the quality of the social bonds shared with other group members [41] [42] [43] . Such individual factors most likely affected FCM levels across our entire data set.",

Abrupt social changes are reported to be important stressors in several social mammals [41] [42] [43] 112] . In wolves, the loss of one or both of the dominant individuals creates important perturbations in the group, evidenced by an elevated rate of dissolution of such socially disturbed packs [113] . Adult wolves provide important stability to a pack through their knowledge of the territory, experience, and long-established social bonds. But attachment figures can include individuals of all age-classes, such as siblings, caregivers, and other specific social partners [46] . Our results may also reflect the stressful challenge of founding a new social unit. At first, establishing contact with unknown conspecifics is arduous, as the outcome of such encounters is always uncertain.

However, conversely to the packs in which the dominant pair was only recently established, breeding status was not much disputed in the Druid Peak pack (Molnar, pers. obs.), in accordance with incest avoidance commonly recognized in free-ranging wolves [45, 114] . Besides the fact that no group member died, a stable breeding pair specifically characterized this pack throughout our study. Our data suggest that breeding pair permanency might buffer the stressful impact of the mating season.

            "text": "Across our entire data set, the results indicate that pack size, the presence of free-ranging dogs, and the interaction between these two factors significantly affected FCM levels in wolves. Lower stress level measured from larger packs contradicts previous observations in lions [39] , and may be true only within a certain range of group size. This result might however reflect the higher competitiveness of larger groups for the defense of territory and related resources in long-settled populations, in which all suitable territories are often occupied. The fact that larger packs are less stressed than smaller ones in the presence of sympatric free-ranging dogs can be interpreted in a similar way. Free-ranging dogs are absent from Yellowstone and extremely rare in Mercantour, whereas they are very common in Abruzzo. Although no official assessment is available for Abruzzo, about 190 free-ranging dogs/100 km 2 have been estimated in 1999 through a sight-resight survey in the nearby Majella National Park, which has very similar ecological and cultural settings (Ciucci pers. comm.) . This important population of free-ranging dogs may have a stressful impact on sympatric wolves, possibly through competition [118] related to the defense of a territory and associated food source. Absent from Abruzzo, the solitary Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) is not an important competitor of wolves in Mercantour. Indeed, the population of the felid is fragmented in the French Alps and at low density compared to other Alpine regions [119, 120] . In Yellowstone, sympatric carnivores active in winter are solitary, as pumas (Puma concolor), or mainly prey on species different from the elk most commonly used by wolves, as coyotes (Canis latrans).",

Comparable landscape, climatic conditions, and sufficient prey base characterize the three study areas, and differences in diet did not appear to affect FCM levels. Nevertheless, we measured substantially higher FCM levels in Abruzzo, where we additionally detected most of the extreme values, recorded in all packs during both winters, and in almost every single month of the study. Together, these results suggest that this specific wolf population was under sustained or repeated stress at the regional scale. Many of the identified environmental factors that could have impacted FCM levels in the wolf population of Abruzzo are shared with Yellowstone, such as wolf density, or with Mercantour, such as a varied diet, and logging, hunting and pastoralist activities in part of the territory of the studied packs. Therefore, the main cause of elevated FCM levels measured in Abruzzo is not likely attributable to these factors. Tourism is important in the three study areas, but is mostly substantially reduced in winter. Pastoralism and increasing human density, but not tourism, were reported as meaningful stressors in spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), another large social carnivore [26] . Pastoralism is important in both European national parks, although much reduced in winter. Compared to the studied packs in Yellowstone, which spent about 99% of their time within the park boundaries [74] , wolves in Abruzzo and Mercantour are more regularly exposed to localized logging, as well as to hunting of wild ungulates taking place outside the boundaries of the parks [73] (Millischer pers. comm.). Indeed, the two European national parks are settled in a landscape more intensively dominated by human activities. Also, because of their small size, part of the territory of wolf packs lies outside the core area of the parks, potentially leading to an important edge effect [121] . Wolves may temporarily restrict their travels in portions of their territory free of such anthropogenic disturbances, as reported in lions [122] .",

In species establishing strong bonds with conspecifics, social disruption is reported as an important stressor [41] [42] [43] 126] . Such impact has also been suggested in wolves, with higher cortisol levels measured in hunted populations compared to undisturbed ones [127] . In Abruzzo, 56% of the wolves recovered dead were victims of poaching, while this proportion was of 33% in Mercantour, and 0% in Yellowstone (Table 2) . Taking wolf density into account, the number of poached wolves was 2.3 times higher in Abruzzo compared to the two other study areas. Social disruption as a consequence of poaching is reported to be a chronic stress condition in the African elephant (Loxodonta africana, [126] ), a species also living in family-based groups sharing strong bonds among group members. As anthropogenic persecution is expected to cause important and recurrent social instability in free-ranging wolf packs [45] , the high poaching levels repeatedly reported inside Abruzzo and within its outer buffer area (Gentile pers. comm.) may be a key factor explaining the elevated FCM levels measured in this population.",

In this population, in which infection by more than two endoparasite taxa was most commonly detected, elevated FCM levels were correlated with parasite richness. While elevated stress levels could predispose individuals to multiple infections, infection itself is a physical stressor that can trigger an increase in FCM levels [1, 8] . In a feedback process, increased FCM levels may favor infection by additional pathogens. Stress enhances the development of viral diseases otherwise optimally overcome by the immune system [128] , as reported for canine coronaviruses [129] . In wolves, stress and different parasitic infections are also predisposing factors to infection by canine parvovirus type 2 [51] . These viruses were detected in fecal sample analyzed in our study, collected in Abruzzo in the winter 2006-2007, and in Mercantour in the winter 2005-2006.

A prospective assessment of FCM levels in the three study areas could help specify the relative importance of these stressors, as human persecution of wolves has increased in Mercantour and in Yellowstone since our study. While occurring outside the boundaries of the national parks, legal shooting nearby Mercantour, and the opening of a wolf hunting and trapping season around Yellowstone directly impact wolf packs partly or mostly established in these protected areas (Millischer pers. comm., Smith pers. comm.). The potential impact of social and territorial instability on GC levels should be further investigated in free-ranging populations, especially in highly social and in territorial species. As for other anthropogenic causes of disturbances, comparing areas with intermediate densities of free-ranging dogs would help understand the impact of this specific factor on FCM levels in wolves and in other wildlife. The effect of tourism, logging and hunting activities on stress levels should likewise be studied in wolves and in other wildlife, in populations in which these factors can be precisely measured. Finally, prospective studies in free-ranging animals should also investigate the relationship between FCM levels and infectious diseases, including parasitic infections.",

We advocate acknowledging and considering the potential impact of direct and indirect anthropogenic causes of persistent or recurrent stress, in management and conservation programs of wolves and other wildlife. fieldwork technicians for their highly precious help in the field in Yellowstone, as well as to B. Landis, R. McIntyre, L. Lyman, D. St John, K. Hart, B. O'Grady, P. Meelis, who helped in locating, following, and identifying the wolves in Yellowstone. This study would not have been possible without the help of L. Grottoli, G. Millischer and their collaborators from Abruzzo and Mercantour respectively, who collected fecal samples in the field. We are very thankful to J.-P. Rivalain for his help in the selection and use of the filming material, and to K. Gunther for giving access to storage facilities in Yellowstone. We also warmly thank L. Mattei and her collaborators from the Popoli Wolf Sanctuary for the collection of the fecal material used in our validation experiment. We thank the Office National de la Chasse et de la Faune Sauvage, France (C. Duchamp), for giving access to fecal material collected in Mercantour, and G. Millischer for providing complementary information regarding this study area. We also thank the direction of Abruzzo for welcomingly facilitating our study, and in particular to L. Gentile for providing information on recovered dead wolves.",
