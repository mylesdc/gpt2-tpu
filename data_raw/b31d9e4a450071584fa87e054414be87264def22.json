Methods: We randomized 600 students into 4 treatment arms: 1) vitamin D 3 and gargling, 2) placebo and gargling, 3) vitamin D 3 and no gargling, and 4) placebo and no gargling. Students completed weekly electronic surveys and submitted self-collected mid-turbinate nasal flocked swabs during September and October in 2010 or 2011. Symptomatic students also completed an electronic symptom diary. The primary and secondary outcomes were the occurrence of symptomatic clinical URTI and laboratory confirmed URTI respectively. Results: Of 600 participants, 471 (78.5%) completed all surveys while 43 (7.2%) completed none; 150 (25.0%) reported clinical URTI. Seventy participants (23.3%) randomized to vitamin D 3 reported clinical URTI compared to 80 (26.7%) randomized to placebo (RR:0.79, CI 95 :0.61-1.03, p = 0.09). Eighty-five participants (28.3%) randomized to gargling reported clinical URTI compared to 65 participants (21.7%) randomized to the no gargling arm (RR:1.3, CI 95 :0.92-1.57, p = 0.19). Laboratory testing identified 70 infections (46.7 per 100 URTIs). Vitamin D 3 treatment was associated with a significantly lower risk for laboratory confirmed URTI (RR: 0.54, CI 95 :0.34-0.84, p = 0.007) and with a significantly lower mean viral load measured as log 10 viral copies/mL (mean difference: \u22120.89, CI 95: -1.7, \u22120.06, p = 0.04). Fewer students assigned to gargling experienced laboratory confirmed URTI, however this was not statistically significant (RR:0.82, CI 95 :0.53-1.26, p = 0.36). Conclusions: These results suggest that vitamin D 3 is a promising intervention for the prevention of URTI. Vitamin D 3 significantly reduced the risk of laboratory confirmed URTI and may reduce the risk of clinical infections. Trial registration: Clinical Trials Registration: NCT01158560.",

The lack of consensus among these studies may reflect substantial heterogeneity across trials resulting from variation in participant populations, degree of vitamin D deficiency, the dose and duration of vitamin D supplementation, and definitions of URTI [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Additionally, several trials were limited by retrospective data collection and post-hoc analyses of trials with nonrespiratory outcomes [12] [13] [14] . Consequently, there remains a need for rigorously-designed, large clinical trials to investigate the effect of vitamin D 3 on URTI in a healthy population.",

Robust standard errors were calculated in place of model based standard errors which are typically too large [27] . Multiple imputation, using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, was conducted to address missing data. Information collected at baseline and through weekly surveys was used to predict missing values for independent and dependent variables [28] . The pooled imputed data was used to conduct an intention-to-treat analysis adjusted for randomization strata: housing, trial year, vitamin D 3 and gargling allocation. Interaction between vitamin D 3 use and gargling was investigated using a crossproduct term. A complete case analysis, adjusted for the same variables, was performed as a sensitivity analysis.

            "text": "Consistent with previous studies in healthy adults, our primary analysis did not show that vitamin D 3 significantly reduced the risk of clinical URTI; however the 20% relative risk reduction may be clinically relevant. Li-Ng et al. randomized 162 adults to 2000 IU vitamin D 3 or placebo daily from December to March and reported no difference in self-reported URTI [15] . Laaksi and colleagues randomized 164 men to 400 IU vitamin D 3 or placebo daily from October through March but did not detect a significant difference in the number of days absent from duty due to URTI [16] . However, the proportion of men who did not experience a URTI was significantly greater in the intervention group (51.3%) than in the control group (35.7%) [16] . Murdoch et al. followed 322 adults randomized to monthly doses of 100,000 IU vitamin D 3 or placebo [19] . After 18 months, the study recorded 593 and 611 URTI episodes in the vitamin D 3 and control groups respectively, however this was not a significant difference [19] . Rees et al. performed a substudy of 759 participants in a trial of colorectal adenoma chemoprevention. Participants were randomized to receive 1000 IU vitamin D3, calcium carbonate, both or placebo daily and were followed for an average of 13 months which covered two winter seasons. The authors reported that supplementation did not significantly reduce the incidence of URTI [21] . Bergman et al. followed 140 adults with increased susceptibility to respiratory infections at an immunodeficiency clinic. After one year of daily supplementation with either 4000 IU vitamin D 3 or placebo, the authors reported a significantly lower infection score in the vitamin D 3 group [20] . Notably, our a priori secondary outcome which assessed laboratory confirmed URTI demonstrated a significant 46% relative risk reduction associated with vitamin D 3 supplementation. This result is consistent with two recent meta-analyses by Charan [29, 30] . Although these results support the use of vitamin D 3 supplementation, further meta-analysis, particularly an individual patient data meta-analysis, including the results from more recent trials and an exploration of heterogeneity between trials should be conducted.",

            "text": "Our study differed in several potentially important ways from previous studies. It is well established that vitamin D levels fluctuate seasonally [33] . Studies of Canadians have demonstrated a marked drop in vitamin D levels in the fall from their peak levels in the summer, and a high prevalence of low wintertime vitamin D levels [34, 35] . To capture peak rates of rhinovirus infection in students, we initiated our intervention in early September, rather than during late autumn and winter months. Thus, serum vitamin D levels did not have the same opportunity to decline as they naturally would during the autumn. Rather than having to overcome depletion in vitamin D levels, our study may have maintained and potentially enhanced vitamin D levels. However, in the absence of blood tests this cannot be proven. Additional differences include the frequency and quantity of vitamin D 3 supplementation. Our study used a relatively high dose of 10,000 IU of vitamin D 3 per week ingested as a single dose, an average of approximately 1400 IU/day. Although the optimal dosing regimen remains uncertain, it has been acknowledged that adherence with daily supplements is often suboptimal and larger, less frequent doses may be an effective alternative [36, 37] . A final methodological difference was our use of self-collected nasal swabs and laboratory confirmation of URTI. Our definition of clinical URTI may have been excessively broad and insufficiently specific which may have led to incorrectly classified events. It is possible that this definition captured episodes attributable to allergies or other causes, creating error in the statistical model and pushing the results towards a null effect.",

This would contribute to larger variance in the estimates and uncertainty surrounding our results.

Consequently, it is uncertain whether vitamin D 3 supplementation is beneficial for the prevention of non-rhinovirus URTI. An additional limitation was the lack of serum vitamin D testing without which we were unable to investigate whether individuals with lower baseline vitamin D levels benefitted incrementally compared to individuals with sufficient baseline vitamin D levels.",

A rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis of current studies, particularly an individual patient data meta-analysis which would facilitate the evaluation of potential variable interactions, would be instrumental to the design of future trials in this field which may need to include a larger sample size, longer period of follow-up or different dosing regimens, and targeted populations who may benefit disproportionately from vitamin D supplementation.",
