When cultured under appropriate conditions in vitro, this population of tumor cells gives rise to gliomaspheres, referred to more generically as tumorspheres (TSs). TSs have been isolated from various malignant tumors, including breast [4] , prostate [5] , bone [6] , colon [7] , kidney [8] and lung [9] , as well as brain [3, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . It was previously reported that the rate of isolation of TSs increase as the World Health Organization (WHO) grades of glioma rise [3] . Moreover, it is not possible to isolate TSs from GBM specimens in all cases, with reported isolation rates estimated at 43.8 % [3] . Notably, the ability to isolate TSs is a significant prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with primary GBM [15] .",

Our original expectation was that the greater the weight of the sample, the more likely the isolation of TSs. Contrary to our expectations, the mean weight for the TS-negative group trended larger than that for the TSpositive group, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.245).

It is also commonly thought that TS-generating cells comprise some proportion of the tumor, and that a higher proportion of these TS-generating cells would be associated with a more aggressive tumor [3, 15, 19] . A previous study reported a significant increase in TS isolation rate in gliomas with increased WHO grades [3] . This suggested the related hypothesis that a larger specimen mass would tend to favor an increased TS isolation rate. Our test of this hypothesis, however, revealed no significant difference in specimen weights between TS-positive and -negative groups. We also found that the two groups were not different with respect to clinical characteristics, molecular factors, or pathological features that might influence TS isolation. Siedel et al. [12] reported that most tumor samples with a size up to 0.5 cm 3 are suitable for GBM TSs isolation. Some authors recommend 200-to 500-mg specimens for isolation of GBM TSs [11] , and there have been some suggestions about the weight or volume of specimens for isolation of TSs from other kinds of cancers [5, 9, 20] . Most other TS-related studies have provided no description of the weight or volume of fresh specimens for TS isolation [19, [21] [22] [23] [24] . Generally speaking, reports such as those referred to above have assumed that, all other things being equal, larger specimens are better than smaller specimens for TS isolation [5, 7, 9, 11, 12] . However, no studies have compared TS-negative and -positive groups to establish optimal weights or volumes for TS isolation.",

Most studies on malignant tumors of the brain and other organs have reported TS isolation efficiencies up to 40-60 % [2, 3, 9, 15, 27, 28] , similar to the results of the results of our current study. However, some authors have described sequential modifications of isolation techniques that improved efficiency from 40 to 90 % in GBM patients [18] . In this latter case, improvements in TS isolation involved fixes to technical problems associated with each stage, such as early vulnerability of surgical specimens, mechanical disruption, and removal of red blood cells Fig. 1 Characterization of a representative GBM TS (TS15-88). a Morphology of TSs shown by phase-contrast microscopy (\u00d7100 original magnification). b Immunocytochemical staining of TSs for CD133 and nestin; nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (\u00d7100 original magnification). c TSs grown in neural differential media were immunostained for GFAP, MBP, NeuN, and TUBB3 (\u00d7200 original magnification). d IHC staining for CD133, CD15 and nestin in the GBM specimen from which this TS sample (TS15-88) was isolated, showing that these markers were well expressed (\u00d7200, \u00d7400 original magnification) in this GBM specimen Fig. 2 Weight distributions of fresh specimens in the two groups. There was no significant difference in the weight of surgical samples in the two groups (P = 0.245, Mann-Whitney test) Fig. 3 Receiver-operating characteristic curve for isolation of TSs. The optimal cut-off value to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of TS isolation from WHO IV gliomas was 500 mg and necrotic material from fresh specimens. Although studies such as this highlight the contribution of technical problems to the isolation of TSs, the fact that the ability to isolate TSs is correlated with poorer clinical outcome in various types of cancers [3, 15, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] indicates that success of TS isolation is not solely determined by technical issues.",

This result was a little similar to the value reported by other authors [11] . Ideally, specimens would be subdivided into various sizes and then cultured, or more than one specimen would be procured from a single patient. However, in actual practice, the operating room setting imposes limitations on specimen collection. We tried to collect specimens with a minimum of red blood cells and necrotic material, but this made it difficult to gather specimens of different sizes from each patient. Therefore, we emphasized the absence of significant differences between demographic and clinical characteristics of two groups, and used the ROC curve for statistical processing. An analysis of our data yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.618, which demonstrated poor discriminatory ability for the isolation of TSs [37, 38] . However, 500 mg of fresh specimen proved to be optimal in our study, and our summary data showed no significant difference in weight between the TS-positive and TS-negative groups, clearly ruling out size/weight of sample as a determining factor in successful TS isolation. Our study suggests some methods for improving the efficiency of TS isolation in addition to stage-specific technical modifications. Future studies using a larger numbers of cases are warranted to further address the relationship between the amount of fresh specimen and TS isolation rate.",

Instead, we found no relationship between the weight of specimen and TS isolation rate. Moreover, our data suggested that 500 mg of fresh specimen was optimal for isolation of TS with maximal sensitivity and specificity. The results of this study could provide useful technical information for cellular immortalization of patients with WHO grade IV gliomas. Authors' contributions SGK supervised the development of the work, gave precious advices, and finally approved the article. JKS, JHL, SJL and YMH performed the experiment, data analysis. KSS performed data analysis, interpretation of the results, manuscript writing, and revision of manuscript. SHP approved the statistical results. SHK approved the pathological data. THR, JHM, EHK, SHK, and JHC performed acquisition of data. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.",

Pathological diagnoses included GBM (n = 29), GBM with an oligodendroglial component (n = 3), and gliosarcomas (n = 3). There were 31 primary and 4 recurrent types of WHO IV gliomas. Of these 35 specimens, 18 were categorized as positive and 17 as negative for TS isolation(Table 1). Molecular factors, including IDH-1 mutation, MGMT promotor methylation, EGFR, p53, 1p and 19q LOH were evaluated. There were no statistically significant differences in age (P = 0.088), sex (P = 0.845), pathological diagnosis (P > 0.999), type (P > 0.999), 1p 19q codeletion (P > 0.999), MGMT promotor methylation (P = 0.358), p53 (P = 0.443), or EGFR mutation status (P = 0.193) between TS-positive and TS-negative groups.",
