To understand this process, we assess data from dengue national and municipal basins regarding population and demographics, transportation network, human mobility, and Ae. aegypti monitoring for the Brazilian state of Acre since the first recorded dengue case in the year 2000 to the year 2015. During this period, several changes in Acre's transport infrastructure and urbanization have been started. To reconstruct the process of dengue introduction in Acre, we propose an analytic framework based on concepts used in malaria literature, namely vulnerability and receptivity, to inform risk assessments in dengue-free regions as well as network theory concepts for disease invasion and propagation. We calculate the probability of dengue importation to Acre from other Brazilian states, the evolution of dengue spread between Acrean municipalities and dengue establishment in the state. Our findings suggest that the landscape changes associated with human mobility have created favorable conditions for the establishment of dengue virus transmission in Acre. The revitalization of its major roads, as well as the increased accessibility by air to and within the state, have increased dengue vulnerability. Unplanned urbanization and population growth, as observed in Acre during the period of study, contribute to ideal conditions for Ae. aegypti mosquito establishment, increase the difficulty in mosquito control and consequently its local receptivity.",

According to the literature, the global spread of dengue from Africa to Asia and the Americas was historically caused by the periodic human voyages across the oceans [4, 5] . Godding [6] further described outbreaks of dengue aboard ships. More recently, in a local survey in Iquitos, Peru, Stoddard et al. [1] showed that the movement of humans to places where contact with mosquitoes was probable was determinant for the transmission of dengue, regardless of the distance between people's place of residence. On a collective scale, spatial patterns of dengue distribution are determined by the social networks, since an individual's routine movements are similar to those of their contacts [1] .",

The Amazon region is one of the last frontiers of development in Brazil. At its western extreme, Acre occupies a strategic, but underdeveloped, place of integration in South America due to its geographical position in relation to the Pacific Ocean and its triple border with Peru and Bolivia. In the last 15 years, Acre has been the target of diverse and intensive government programs aimed at boosting its development. Examples of such programs are agrarian reform with the creation of several settlements; paving of roadways and expansion of airports [23, 24] ; the stimulus to new economic activities; and strengthening the exchange of commodities between Brazil and the Pacific countries by means of the Pacific road, completed in 2010. In response to these investments, the population of some municipalities doubled from the year 2000 to 2010, and the percentage of urbanization increased in 20 of its 22 municipalities [25] . It was during this period that the introduction and spread of the dengue virus in the state was observed, almost 20 years after its introduction and establishment in the country [21] .",

The invading species under consideration, dengue viruses, cannot establish itself in new areas unless the receiving community presents certain conditions to sustain autochthonous virus transmission. More formally, the emergence of dengue fever in a new region depends on the occurrence of two major events: (i) the arrival of at least one infected individual in the city and (ii) the subsequent positive growth of autochthonous dengue cases (i.e., disease establishment) [26] .",

The connections between municipalities-i.e., the network edgeswere classified according to the presence and status of roads, waterways, and airways. In the cases where municipalities were connected by more than one modal, this was taken into account by including all corresponding edges. Road status was tentatively classified year by year. However, since not all information was recorded every year, it is only an approximation. The combination of modal type and road condition resulted in the following categories: (1) unpaved road, (2) paved road and (3) road under maintenance; (4) waterway; and (5) airway. The third category encompassed roads under restoration, under construction and mixed conditions. Flight data. To describe the flow of individuals to Acre, airline data from 2001 to 2012 was provided by ANAC. This dataset contains information on the origin-destination for passengers on direct flights (with or without stoppage). For those on connecting flights, ANAC provides the number of travelers in transit per airport pair. We developed a methodology to combine the data regarding direct flights and passengers in transit to estimate the total number of passengers that travel between all possible airport pairs (see S1 Appendix). The total number of passengers to Acre by state of origin during the period of study is depicted in Fig 1. Commutation data (Mobility). To obtain an estimate of the flow of individuals between municipalities in Acre, we used data from the 2010 Brazilian Census [30] . In this dataset, respondents were asked to provide the country, state, and municipality of work/study. A fraction of them did not provide full information, that is, they mentioned working outside their municipality of residence, but with no further specification of state or municipality; some only provided destination state, but no specification of the municipality. To compensate for that, for each city of residence we aggregated all entries with the same level of information, (i) displacement only, (ii) destination state only, and (iii) complete information.

Here, evidence of transmission is indirectly obtained from the notification data via the calculation of the effective reproductive number, R t .

A value of R t > 1 indicates a sustained growth of incidence. Since no information is available on who infected whom, the primary cases are inferred from the generation interval of dengue, that is, primary cases are those that could be the source of transmission for the current cases given the time between the onset of their disease symptoms.

While the descriptors for the mobility network are static since we only have the flow of individuals for the year of 2010, the analysis of the transportation network status is dynamic since there were considerable interventions such as construction and paving of roadways during the period of study. We hypothesize that T 3 and the descriptors should be correlated since the road changes in the Acrean network is very evident, and the invasion of dengue in the state occurred first in the nearest municipalities in terms of distance and with better road structure.",

The accessibility to the northwest area of Acre began to improve after the year 2008, when paving of the highway BR-364 in the region of Manuel Urbano (MU) and Feij\u00f3 (Fj), in the central area of Acre. Highway BR-364 is the only one that crosses the state from Acrel\u00e2ndia (Acl, in the southeast) to M\u00e2ncio Lima (ML, in the northwest) and connects Acre to the rest of Brazil via Rond\u00f4nia state.",

We used Cytoscape software [55] to build a representation of the Acrean municipalities' mobility network, with edge width and color proportional to the natural logarithm of the daily number of travelers and node size proportional to the natural logarithm of each municipality's population (node color indicate access mode, as in Fig 3) . Nodes position are defined based on the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm [56] , which is a force-directed layout widely used in network visualization. In this layout, all nodes have a repulsion force between them, while edges weight are used as an attractive force between connected nodes. Nodes that share stronger connections, i.e., with more travelers, are placed closer to each other than those that share weaker or no connection. Therefore, groups of nodes sharing stronger bonds among them form regional clusters in this abstract space of connectivity. This particular visualization facilitates the detection of municipalities that share relatively strong bonds even when geographically far apart. On the other hand, nodes that are placed on the periphery with this algorithm are those that have relatively few and/or weak connections. We can see that the two most populous municipalities, the capital Rio Branco (RB) and Cruzeiro do Sul (CZS), are important hubs in this network. The access mode (waterway, paved and unpaved roads, airway) confers a natural clustering on the mobility network, suggesting an intuitive relationship between ease of access (transportation network) and the number of travelers (mobility network). Municipalities accessed by paved roads are more densely connected with each other, while the strong connection between Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul, which are connected by airports, considerably shortens the effective distance between east and west side of the state. Another example of this relationship is the fact that municipalities which are mainly accessed via waterways are peripheral in the mobility network. In fact, Marechal Thaumaturgo (MT), Jord\u00e3o (Jrd) and Santa Rosa dos Purus (SRP) have the lowest Ew, Cw and Sw centralities, with Porto Walter (PW) also among the five municipalities with lowest values for those centralities.",

The other city is Cruzeiro do Sul, one of the most distant cities in kilometers from Rio Branco, but populous and with an air connection to the capital.",

A summary of the main results is shown in Table 1 . This is an exploratory analysis only, since the sample size is small for modeling. Strength centrality was the network descriptor most negatively correlated with T 3 . This result suggests that municipalities in which the sharing of individuals with other municipalities was larger had a greater exposure to dengue and, consequently, smaller T 3 than those with lower integration. The Eigenvector centrality of the municipalities, which is related to how strong is the connectivity of a node's neighborhood, therefore its ability to concentrate population flow in the network, also presents negative correlation with T 3 . This is an intuitive result since this property enhances the probability of a node being invaded once a node in its vicinity presents an outbreak, even when not in direct contact. Finally, the distance from Rio Branco, measured by both the effective distance and in kilometers, also showed high correlation with T 3 . It is interesting to note that, geographical distance aside, topological properties of the unweighted structural network are not significantly correlated with T 3 . It is important to highlight that about half of the Acrean municipalities did not meet the criteria of dengue establishment, which has a significant impact on the correlation obtained. With that in mind, we also investigated if those network properties were correlated with the event of dengue establishment itself. In Fig 6, we show boxplots comparing the centrality of municipalities that witnessed dengue establishment during the study period and those which did not. This comparison allows for the evaluation of whether municipalities grouped by occurrence (YES/NO) are also characterized by significantly distinct network properties. It is possible to identify that the descriptors most correlated to T 3 were also those that differed the most between municipalities with and without dengue establishment, which are the geographical and effective distance to Rio Branco, Eigenvector and Strength centralities.",

Gradually the nearest municipalities in the southeast of the state also started recording it, and in 2001, eight municipalities had confirmed the presence of Ae. aegypti. These municipalities are the same municipalities where R t > 1 was detected earlier in time, being municipalities along BR-317 (SG, Cpb, Xpr, Epcd and Brl) or with a direct connection to RB (PA) and two with good access to BR-364 since the beginning of the study (SM and Acld). From 2002 to 2006, another three municipalities reported the presence of Ae. aegypti: Pl\u00e1cido de Castro, Bujari and Assis Brasil. Bujari is the nearest neighbor of Rio Branco, but Ae. aegypti presence was not confirmed until 2006. It is difficult to ascertain the specific causes for this. On the one hand, this was a predominantly rural municipality in the early 2000's. On the other hand, there was not a wellstructured vector surveillance program implemented in small towns such as Bujari until later. Pl\u00e1cido de Castro and Assis Brasil are frontier municipalities, the former at the border with Rond\u00f4nia state, receiving a considerable traffic of vehicles from the highly dengue endemic neighbor state. It is reasonable to infer that Ae. aegypti could be present there previously but unnoticed. However, dengue only established itself in Pl\u00e1cido de Castro in 2012/2013, despite the consistent detection of cases since 2001. Assis Brasil is a small town at the triple frontier Brasil-Peru-Bolivia. In 2000, it had a considerably small population, which may have contributed to the delayed invasion of Ae. aegypti.",

This invasion was interrupted, however, and the mosquito was detected again only in 2013 [58] . From the municipalities to the north of Sena Madureira along the BR-364 highway, four confirmed the presence of Ae. aegypti in 2015: Feij\u00f3, Tarauac\u00e1, M\u00e2ncio Lima and Porto Walter. The first three, together with Cruzeiro do Sul, are located along the BR-364 and are important stopping points for those traveling. For the same reason, it is not possible to affirm that the mosquito was actually absent before that, since monitoring was not implemented. Five municipalities remained Ae. aegypti free as of 2015, according to Introduction of dengue and network-based analysis the LI/LIRAa dataset (Table 2 ). These are the most peripheral municipalities of Acre, and also the most rural. Structural characteristics of Acrean municipalities can be part of the explanation for the slow invasion and establishment of Ae. aegypti in the state. According to IBGE's urban/rural classification, Acre is mostly a rural state, but the population of all municipalities and the percentage of urbanization increased from 2000 to 2010. The exceptions are two, Rodrigues Alves and Assis Brasil, where total population increased as well but the urban population decreased Introduction of dengue and network-based analysis [25] . Both municipalities presented an increase in the number of rural settlements [59] . Population growth, coupled with the increase in urbanization without improving the coverage of general services-such as garbage collection, water supply and sanitary sewage ( Table 2 ) -, contribute to the fact that, even in a more rural state, the ideal conditions for establishing the mosquito are guaranteed. Those characteristics increase the difficulty in controlling Ae. aegypti [50] and consequently the local receptivity.",

In Acre, the revitalization of its major roads, as well as the increased accessibility by air both to and within the state, have increased dengue vulnerability. Notice that the increase in the flow of people and importation of dengue cases to Acre coincides with when disease dispersion becomes more pronounced within the state, suggesting a synergy between increasing vulnerability of the state at a global scale and increasing local vulnerability among municipalities, fueling viral spread in the region. Human mobility is responsible for viral spreading, as both asymptomatic humans or those with very mild symptoms continue to carry out their tasks and take the virus to other regions. Humans are also responsible for possibly transporting the mosquito itself (which can be infected or not) by air, road, and waterway [2, 7, 62] .",

However, the strength (S) was the most relevant of the descriptors, because, in a small network, the relationship between local and global characteristics are stronger. Rio Branco is the main attractor of the state, with highest and strongest connectivity within Acre, since most of the routes connecting municipalities in the northwest to the southeast region pass by the capital. Also, it is a reference center for the entire state. A node with high connectivity, that is, a node to which many others connect to and where there are many outputs, is an essential node for the propagation of infectious diseases [63] . Therefore, investing in dengue control and prevention in a systematic manner in Rio Branco has potentially a strong impact throughout the state, not only because of its connectivity within Acre but also because this city is the main port-of-entry from other Brazilian states.",

Also, the unpaved connections to and from Manoel Urbano, which is structurally in between the two Acrean hubs, had also improved by that time. Most of its paving work was concluded by the end of 2010, although maintenance works continued for the rest of the study period. Despite the unavailability of detailed movement for performing a rigorous analysis, it is to be expected that during the period with unpaved and with major maintenance works in the roadways the flow of individuals was lower than when those structural bottlenecks were resolved. Therefore, we expect that the 2010 mobility flux data is more representative of the work/study-related movement from 2009 onwards.

Up until epidemiological year 2009/2010, when paved roads (black edges in that network) were mainly present in the vicinity of Rio Branco, the occurrence of R t > 1 was also mostly present in that area-which can be identified by node's color in Fig 5 as well as by the markings in Fig 3. In the area surrounding Cruzeiro do Sul, which was mainly connected by waterways (dashed blue edges) and roads under maintenance (orange edges), before 2007/2008 the occurrence of R t > 1 was registered only once at M\u00e2ncio Lima (ML) and a few times in Cruzeiro do Sul. These results reinforce the hypothesis that those cases notified in Cruzeiro do Sul were most likely imported cases from Rio Branco due to the airline connection. It is interesting to note that in terms of roadways, the path from Rio Branco to Cruzeiro do Sul had a structural bottleneck at Manoel Urbano (MU) since it was only accessed by means of unpaved road (red edges) up to 2007/2008. Improvements in the structural network started in 2008/2009, which included paving and maintenance work of the roadways around Manoel Urbano, and were consolidated in 2009/ 2010 with the conclusion of major maintenance work in the roadways directly connected to both Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul. We can see that is was precisely after those improvements that dengue notifications started to occur throughout the state of Acre, as well as the number of consecutive weeks with R t > 1 in each municipality. The combination of low occurrence of R t > 1 during the years with unpaved and under maintenance roadways, and the increased observation of R t > 1 after improvements were implemented reinforces the hypothesis that the human mobility network and the structural changes were relevant to the observed geographical spread of the virus in the state of Acre.",

The capital Rio Branco, the one with the largest population, has 336,038 inhabitants [25] . The second largest municipality in population size is Cruzeiro do Sul, with 78,507. The remaining ones do not exceed 40,000 inhabitants, the majority of them having less than 20,000 inhabitants. The peripheral municipalities according to the network descriptors are also those with the smallest populations and are, mostly, more rural than urban. These municipalities are less vulnerable and less receptive to dengue, which is seen by the low occurrence of R t > 1 and no event of sustained transmission as defined in this study. Nonetheless, in the world, there has been increased reporting of Ae. aegypti invasion and dengue introduction in less urbanized areas. In Colombia, dengue-infected Ae. aegypti was found in rural regions [65] south of Bogot\u00e1. In Nicaragua, a study showed the unsuspected presence of dengue cases in those areas as well [66] .",

            "text": "Overall, with this study, we understand that the determination of vulnerable and receptive localities for dengue in the state of Acre is essential for an effective action of entomological and epidemiological surveillance. It is fundamental that all municipalities, especially those with a roadway link, systematically monitor mosquito infestation, which is not currently the case. In addition, favorable conditions for mosquito development are present in Acrean municipalities, with low coverage of services, climate and increased urbanization [25] , which probably impacts on the availability of breeding sites for Ae. aegypti and its establishment. Acre has a humid equatorial climate, which may contribute to the transmission of the dengue virus occurring throughout the year. According to [50] , the mosquitoes of the region have the vectorial competence to transmit the DENV-2. Unfortunately, we did not find more biological information on the mosquito populations of Acre. We can conclude that Acre is a state at risk of major dengue epidemics, with entire populations susceptible to all serotypes of the disease. Due to the limited data and number of municipalities, our analysis is more descriptive/qualitative than quantitative. Nonetheless, we believe that the descriptors discussed here as well as the methodological approach has proved a valuable way to assess invasion risk which can be easily expanded to larger areas-conditioned on data availability -, allowing for a more quantitative analysis..

The contribution of Rond\u00f4nia, Distrito Federal and Mato Grosso to the exportation of dengue to Acre was mainly associated with the flow intensity between these states while that of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo was a result of the combination of moderate flow intensity and high rates of dengue activity. Others states such as Tocantins (TO), Roraima (RR) and Amap\u00e1 (AP) in the north, Maranh\u00e3o (MA), Piau\u00ed (PI), Para\u00edba (PB) and Alagoas (AL) in the east and all states in the south region were unlikely exporters of dengue cases to Acre due to the combination of low flow and low dengue activity.",

To illustrate the impact of interstate airflow in this population, the 2010 Census registered 3.6 thousand commuters to Rio Branco, so that the average daily out-of-state air passengers corresponded to almost 4% of daily commuters in 2001/2002, up to almost 14% in that of 2013/2014.
