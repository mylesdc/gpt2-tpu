Using a replicating modified vaccinia virus Tian Tan strain (MVTT) as a vaccine vector, we constructed MVTT HA-QH and MVTT HA-AH , which expresses the H5 gene of a goose-derived Qinghai strain A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005 or human-derived Anhui Strain A/Anhui/1/ 2005. The immunogenicity profiles of both vaccine candidates were evaluated. Vaccination with MVTT HA-QH induced a significant level of neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) against a homologous strain and a wide range of H5N1 pseudoviruses (clades 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.3.4). Neutralization tests (NT) and Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies inhibit the live autologous virus as well as a homologous A/Xingjiang/1/2006 and a heterologous A/Vietnam/1194/2004, representing two human isolates from clade 2.2 and clade 1, respectively. Importantly, mice vaccinated with intranasal MVTT HA-QH were completely protected from challenge with lethal dosages of A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005 and the A/Viet Nam/ 1194/2004, respectively, but not control mice that received a mock MVTT S vaccine. However, MVTT HA-AH induced much lower levels of NT against its autologous strain. Our results suggest that it is feasible to use the H5 gene from A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005 to construct an effective vaccine, when using MVTT as a vector, to prevent infections against homologous and genetically divergent human H5N1 influenza viruses.",

H5N1 was shown to be lethal to human in 1997 when 6 of the 18 infected human cases in Hong Kong died [3] [4] [5] . Although H5N1 viruses have not yet been transmitted between humans, cross-species transmission of these viruses to human has been documented in 633 cases, with a mortality rate of 59.6%, since the reemergence of H5N1 viruses in 2003 [6] . Several recent independent studies suggested that H5N1 viruses might require very few amino acid substitutions to become transmissible via respiratory droplets between mammals [7] [8] [9] . Therefore, great concern has been raised in the ability of H5N1 viruses to efficiently spread between humans and become a pandemic threat, thus making an H5N1 influenza vaccine an integral part of any pandemic preparedness plan [10] .",

            "text": "Broad cross-protection is a highly desirable feature of an H5N1 vaccine to avoid the possible pandemic of H5N1 influenza viruses. However, the efficacies of currently licensed vaccines appear to be insufficient partially due to the antigenic diversity present in the virus, restricting the utility of the vaccine to a small number of specific strains. Whilst the identity of any specific pandemic strain is rather difficult to predict before the event, it would take 4-6 months or more to deliver a vaccine using current manufacturing technologies [11, 12] . Therefore, great efforts have been made toward developing vaccines with broad cross-protection against H5N1 influenza viruses, as well as improving vaccine production methods to shorten the lead-time to vaccine delivery. New approaches, such as virus-like particles (VLPs), naked DNA and adenoviral and vaccinia vector-based vaccines have been developed to prevent H5N1 viral infections [10, 13, 14] . It was reported that inactivated H5N1 influenza viruses of clades 1 and 2.1 and virus-like particles (VLPs) containing the HA, NA and M1 proteins of IN5/05 and VN/1203 showed significant cross-protective potential [15] [16] [17] . Non-replicating vaccinia vectors, such as the Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) carrying an HA derived from the VN/1203 strain, displayed a high level of crossprotection [18] . A veterinary vaccine expressing the H5 gene of the A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005 (A/BhG/QH/1/05) also provided protection against lethal challenges of homologous and heterologous avian H5N1 influenza viruses [19] .",

VTT has been used extensively as a smallpox vaccine for millions of people in China before the 1980's [21] and was successfully developed into a vaccine vector for rabies and hepatitis B viruses [22, 23] . Compared to VTT, MVTT is very safe, as it has been shown to not replicate in mouse brain and does not cause death after intracranial injection or body weight loss after intranasal inoculation in immuno-deficient mice [20] . Moreover, using the spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV as the test antigen, we found that MVTT is superior to MVA for inducing high levels of neutralizing antibody via mucosal vaccination [24] . In this report, using MVTT as a live vaccine vector, we constructed MVTT HA-QH and MVTT HA-AH , which expresses the H5 gene of a goosederived Qinghai strain A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005 or human-derived Anhui Strain A/Anhui/1/2005.

In brief, Vero cells were infected with MVTT and subsequently transfected with a shuttle vector pZCxz containing the HA gene of influenza H5N1 flanked with MVTT HA sequences [26] . The recombinant virus was selected through six rounds of plaque purification under agar and confirmed by immunostaining assay using an anti-H5 serum [26] . The insertion of full length gene of H5N1 HA was further confirmed by PCR using specific primers. Total DNA was extracted from MVTT HA-QH , MVTT HA-AH or MVTT SIV infected Vero cells as described before [24] . The presence of full-length H5N1 HA genes were evidenced by the amplification of around 1700 bp fragments using the following pairs of primers: Anhui-F 59-ATGGAGAA-GATCGTGCTGCTG, and Anhui-B 59-GATGCAGATTCTG-CACTGCAGGCT; Qinghai-F 59 ATGGAGAAAATAG-TGCTTCT: Qinghai-B 59 AATGCAAATTCTGCATTGTA, respectively.

Both viral stocks were titrated simultaneously in Vero cells by a plaque forming assay using crystal violet staining or counting the plaques with GFP expression [26] .",

We analyzed the sequences of the HA genes derived from the human A/Xingjiang/1/06 strain and those from other countries.

Since both genes were included within the same insertion frame, the reporter gene served as a surrogate marker for the selection of recombinant VTT carrying the HA gene. Using this technique, we were able to generate and to purify the recombinant virus MVTT HA-QH and MVTT HA-AH . The positive plaque was selected under a fluorescence microscope and subsequently confirmed by immunohistochemcal staining assay using a mouse anti-H5 serum (Fig. 2B) . To further confirm that the full length H5N1 H5 gene was inserted into the MVTT vector, the total DNA was extracted from Vero cells infected by either MVTT HA-QH or MVTT HA-AH . Total DNA was extracted from MVTT SIV infected Vero cells as negative control. The full-length H5N1 HA genes were amplified from the total DNA extracted from both MVTT HA-QH and MVTT HA-AH infected cells using specific primers, but not MVTT SIV infected Vero cells (Fig. 2C) .

Serum samples collected on day 0 and day 28 after the first immunization and 2 weeks after the second inoculation (day 45) were subjected to a neutralization (NT) assay by using a previously described pseudoviral assay [10] . We found that MVTT HA-QH was able to induce potent NT response against the autologous viral strain with a dilution factor of IC 50 over 1000 after the first immunization (Fig. 3A) . The I.N. route induced seemingly higher levels of NT responses than the I.M. route after the first immunization (IC 50 titer: 4076 vs. 1326). Moreover, the second immunization boosted primary responses by 2 (I.N.) to 8 (I.M.) fold for NT titers. Mice who received the control MVTT SIV did not generate any responses, as expected (Fig. 3A) . In contrast, after the 2 nd immunization, none of the mice immunized with MVTT HA-AH was able to induce any NT response against its homologous strain (Fig. 3B) . We, therefore, conducted a 3 rd immunization with the same dose of MVTT HA-AH three weeks after the 2 nd immunization, but only one in five mice was able to produce NT responses against its homologous strain (IC 50 titer: 70). However, MVTT HA-AH was able to induce potent NT responses with a dilution factor of IC 50 around 1000 after the 2nd immunization against the Qinghai strain (Fig. 3C) . Furthermore, compared to MVTT HA-QH , MVTT HA-AH induced seemingly lower levels of NT responses through the I.N. route than through the I.M. route after the 2nd immunization. The 3rd immunization boosted the primary responses for NT titers. These results suggest that immunization with MVTT HA-AH was successful, however, A/ Anhui/1/2005 is likely to be less sensitive to the neutralizing activity of vaccine-induced antibody. Moreover, HA from A/ Anhui/1/2005 is less antigenic compared to HA from the Qinghai strain.",

We included the oral route, as it is one of the easiest methods of vaccination for resourcelimited settings. Serum samples collected on day 0 before vaccination, day 28 after the first immunization and 2 weeks after the second inoculation (day 45) were subjected to HI and NT assays using the live homologous A/BhG/QH/1/05 strain. We found that all three vaccination routes were able to induce both HI and NT responses ( Table 2 ). The I.N. route induced seemingly higher levels of both HI and NT responses than the other two routes after the first immunization. Moreover, the second immunization boosted the primary responses significantly, more specifically, 4-16 fold for HI and 5-7 fold for NT titers, which are consistent to findings using the pseudoviral neutralization assay (Fig. 3A) . Unexpectedly, two of the five mice in the oral group did not respond to the vaccine after two immunizations for unknown reasons. For the control, mice receiving PBS did not generate any responses, as expected. We did not conduct the ELIspot assay in this experiment because the animals were kept for subsequent viral challenge.",

By evaluating the body weight change and the survival rate, we found that all animals with detectable antibody responses were completely protected (Fig. 5) . Moreover, the protected mice exhibited no clinical signs of infection, including huddling, shivering and ruffled fur. In contrast, animals who received PBS and the two mice (2/5) that did not show any detectable antibody responses in the oral group, showed significant clinical signs of infection and died within 6 days post viral challenge. To determine whether or not MVTT HA-QH would confer protection against heterologous human H5N1 influenza viruses, we immunized another four groups of mice via the I.N. and I.M. routes. Here, we included the mock vaccine MVTT S for determination of whether the vaccine vector would induce any non-specific protection effects. Using the same vaccination protocol, but with a reduced dosage (1.5610 6 PFU of MVTT HA-QH ), MVTT HA-QH was able to induce both HI and NT responses, as expected (Table 3 ). In addition to the (Table 3) . Despite antigenic variation, HI and NT responses were also detected against the clade 1 A/VN/1194/ 04 ( Fig. 1 and Table 3 ). As expected, no H5-specific HI and NT responses were detected among mice immunized with MVTT S . To further determine the efficacy of MVTT HA-QH , the vaccinated animals were challenged with pathogenic A/BhG/ QH/1/05 and A/VN/1194/04 viruses 3 weeks post second immunization. Since A/HA XJ /WSN is not a pathogenic virus, it was not included in the challenge experiment. Consistent to our previous findings (Fig. 5 ), all animals with detectable antibody responses were completely protected against the homologous A/ BhG/QH/1/05 challenge (Fig. 6A) . Again, the protected mice exhibited no clinical signs of infection. Importantly, all animals with detectable antibody responses were also completely protected against the heterologous A/VN/1194/04 challenge (Fig. 6B) . In contrast, animals which received MVTT S showed significant clinical signs, including huddling, shivering, ruffled fur and body weight loss, and most of them died within 6 days post viral challenge. Despite the occurrence of clinical signs, three control animals (one in the I.M. group and two in the I.N. group) survived the A/VN/1194/04 challenge for unknown reasons (Fig. 6B) .",

Samples from the lung and brain were then subjected to viral isolation. In agreement with the data shown in Fig. 5 , no viruses were obtained from mice vaccinated with MVTT HA-QH (Table 4 ).

HPAIV has been considered a serious public health threat with pandemic potential. If an HPAIV pandemic occurs, it is estimated to claim the lives of over a hundred million people [29, 30] . However, currently licensed vaccines are only effective to a small number of specific strains. The difficulty to predict the pandemic strain together with long and slow process of vaccine production make the efficient development of a vaccine with broad cross-protection an important step for pandemic preparedness. Here, we describe a Modified Vaccinia Virus TianTan strain (MVTT) based H5N1 vaccine, expressing the H5 gene of a goose-derived Qinghai strain A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/1/2005, which can induce broadly neutralizing antibodies and cross-clade protective immunity in mice. Currently, human vaccines have mainly focused on clade 1 strains, among which VNM/1203/04-based vaccines are the most extensively studied. In contrast, both A/BhG/QH/1/05 and A/ Anhui/1/2005, although recommended by the WHO (World Health Organization) as one of the vaccine targeted strains, have yet to be comprehensively studied for their potential as a human vaccine candidate. In the past few years, viruses that are closely related to A/BhG/QH/1/05 have been found to have spread rapidly to Europe, India and Africa via migratory birds, and were likely the causative agents for several human infections throughout Europe and China, including our recently identified A/Xinjiang/ 1/06 [31] [32] [33] . In this study, we characterized the immunogenicity of MVTT HA-QH and MVTT HA-AH , and the antibody response induced against multiple H5N1 influenza viruses representing clades 1 (VN1203 and VN1194), 2.1 (ID05 and ID04), 2.2 (Qinghai and Turkey), 2.3.2 (Chinese duck E319) and 2.3.4 (Fujian and Anhui) (Fig. 1) using the pseudoviral NT assay. We found that Nabs induced by MVTT HA-QH neutralized pseudoviruses from all major clades tested. The MVTT HA-QH -induced serum inhibited viruses from clade 2.2 most optimally, followed by clades 2.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.4 and 1, suggesting that sequence variation in the antigenic sites probably accounted for the reduced NT titers of divergent H5N1 strains (Table 1) . Moreover, we characterized a MVTT HA-QH -induced antibody response against the human A/ Xinjiang/1/06 strain (Fig. 1) , a virus recently identified from a Chinese patient in Xinjiang province that is northwest to the Qinghai province. Despite sequence variations in the antigenic sites, probably due to adaptive infections in humans (Table 1) , the HA gene of A/Xinjiang/1/06 remains closely related to A/BhG/ QH/1/05 (Fig. 1) . It is, therefore, not surprising to see that MVTT HA-QH induced neutralizing and HI antibody responses that reacted equally well against both A/BhG/QH/1/05 and HA XJ /WSN (Table 3 ). In particular, the A86V and A156T mutations in A/Xinjiang/1/06 did not seem to confer resistance to the NT and HI antibodies induced by MVTT HA-QH (Table 1) . Furthermore, we determined the cross-reactivity of MVTT HA-QHinduced NT and HI antibodies against another human virus, the clade 1 A/VN/1194/04. Interestingly, although ten major antigenic mutations were identified between A/BhG/QH/1/05 and A/VN/1194/04 (Table 1) , which accounted for titer drops in HI (,8-fold) and live viral NT (,2-fold) assays (Table 3) , MVTT HA-QH was still able to induce significant levels of NT and HI antibody responses against the heterologous human A/ VN/1194/04 strain. Importantly, all MVTT HA-QH -vaccinations were completely protected against challenges with pathogenic A/ BhG/QH/1/05 and A/VN/1194/04, respectively ( Fig. 5 and 6 ). These findings indicated that MVTT HA-QH displayed a potential to overcome the problem of antigenic drift between clade 1 and clade 2.2, and therefore, is an attractive target vaccine for further clinical development. H5 from A/Anhui/2/05 appeared to be a weak antigen when using MVTT as a vector. This was most likely caused by mutations inducing conformational changes and hid of antigenic sites of HA (Table. 1), because the HA protein was efficiently expressed in MVTT -HA-AH infected Vero cells (Fig. 2) , and MVTT HA-AH was able to induce NT responses after the 2nd immunization against the Qinghai strain (Fig. 3C) . Consistently, A/Anhui/1/2005 is less sensitive to the neutralizing activity of MVTT -HA-QH -induced antibodies compared to other H5N1 influenza viruses, including strain A/duck/Fujian/1734/2005, which also belongs to clade 2.3.4 ( Fig. 3 and 4) . Two out of five mice in the oral administration group did not respond to the MVTT -HA-QH vaccine after two immunizations due to individual variance.",

            "text": "MVTT-based vaccines offer certain advantages over conventional influenza vaccines. With recent technical improvements, the time required for constructing MVTT-based vaccines is becoming significantly shortened. In comparison to adeno-vectored or DNAbased vaccines, vaccinia delivers a high level of foreign gene expression directly without time-consuming gene-optimization procedures [10, 13] . Critically, MVTT HA-QH does not depend on SPF eggs or primary chicken embryo fibroblast [34, 35] . MVTT HA-QH can be produced using WHO-recommended Vero cells with ease and without the requirement of bio-safety level-3 containment, which is necessary for inactivated vaccines. The large-scale production of MVTT HA-QH is, therefore, feasible. Given the large capacity for housing large foreign gene inserts, it is possible to use MVTT to generate a multivalent-H5 vaccine in order to further improve the breath of cross-clade NT and HI antibody responses. When compared to the widely-used modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , we recently demonstrated that MVTT is superior to MVA for inducing high levels of systemic neutralizing antibodies against SARS coronavirus, especially through mucosal routes of vaccination [24] . To this end, we found that intranasal vaccination with MVTT HA-QH induced consistently high levels of systemic NT and HI antibody responses that are equivalent to the outcomes of intramuscular injection. Moreover, intranasal vaccination can overcome preexisting anti-vector immune responses, which offers advantages for the elderly who previously have received VTT against smallpox [24] . As a non-invasive procedure, intranasal vaccination also has great implications for mass vaccination of human populations, especially in developing countries. Lastly, intranasal vaccination has made it possible to develop MVTT HA-QH as a potential aerosol veterinary vaccine, which, however, would require efficacy testing after being sprayed onto poultry and migratory bird populations. Given these reasons, our findings from this study have important implications in the fight against possible zoonotic HPAIV outbreaks.",
