Despite the fact that several assays are available, identification of an etiological agent is not possible in ,30% of patients suffering from respiratory tract diseases. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop a diagnostic set for the detection of respiratory viruses with sensitivity as low as 1-10 copies per reaction. Evaluation of the assay using a training clinical sample set showed that viral nucleic acids were identified in ,76% of cases. To improve assay performance and facilitate the identification of novel species or emerging strains, cultures of fully differentiated human airway epithelium were used to pre-amplify infectious viruses. This additional step resulted in the detection of pathogens in all samples tested. Based on these results it can be hypothesized that the lack of an etiological agent in some clinical samples, both reported previously and observed in the present study, may result not only from the presence of unknown viral species, but also from imperfections in the detection methods used.",

            "text": "Respiratory infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality, with a worldwide disease burden estimated at almost 98,000,000 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and more than 4,000,000 deaths per year [1, 2] . Several studies show that respiratory infections have the most prominent impact on the pediatric population, and it is assumed that preschool children experience 6-10 viral infections per year, while older children, adolescents and adults experience 3-5 per year [3, 4, 5] . Clinical presentation of viral respiratory infections depends heavily on patient status and the pathogen involved, and may show a broad variety of symptoms, including both upper (e.g. common cold, rhinitis, sinusitis, otitis media) and lower respiratory symptoms (e.g. pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, tracheitis and croup). Rapid and accurate detection and identification of viruses causing respiratory tract infections is important for patient care and disease control as this significantly decreases the length of hospitalization and reduces management costs. Furthermore, detection and identification of etiological agents enables the introduction of specific antiviral treatments and appropriate isolation precautions in severe cases [6, 7] . Despite this, no etiological agent can be identified in ,30% of patients suffering from respiratory tract diseases. Previous studies hypothesized that this might be due to the presence of as yet unknown viruses [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] .",

            "text": "Virus detection and typing is a tedious task because the presence of multiple viral species and strains blurs the image, and infection with a wide range of pathogens may result in a similar clinical outcome [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] . Numerous clinical virology laboratories continue to employ diagnostic algorithms, which incorporate antigen or culture-based methods. The latter have several drawbacks in that they are technically demanding and laborious. Furthermore, not all viruses replicate in cell culture (e.g. human bocavirus and human coronavirus HKU1) and the panel of susceptible cell lines is limited [20, 21, 22] . The undeniable advantage of this approach is that the recovered viral strains are valuable for further pathogen characterization and antiviral susceptibility testing [23, 24] . Antigen-based methods can be used for both detection and typing of pathogens in clinical samples or in cell culture. Until now, several assays have been developed, although high variability of viruses may pose a problem and lead to false-negative results [17, 25, 26] . Indisputably, the most sensitive and specific methods for detection of respiratory viruses are molecular techniques [17, 27, 28, 29] . Molecular methods may be roughly divided into sensitive and specific assays such as real-time PCR or loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods, and techniques with broad specificity that are capable of detecting a wide variety of pathogens. The latter group includes sequence-independent methods (e.g. virus discovery based on cDNA-AFLP (VIDISCA), Sequence-independent, single-primer amplification (SISPA), differential display) [23, 30, 31, 32, 33] . The main disadvantage of such an approach is that the sensitivity of the assays is limited. Further, these methods are relatively laborious and high-throughput analysis is unworkable. Some previously developed methods (e.g. universal primers or microarray-based methods) are designed to detect a broad range of targets combine, at least partially, the advantages of these two approaches.",

One microliter of such a template was further used as an input for the PCR reaction. The results presented in Figure 3 show that the assay sensitivity varied from 1 to 10 copies of template nucleic acids per reaction. Careful optimization showed that the assay sensitivity could be further increased. By increasing the primer concentration in the first PCR to 600 nM, a detection level of 1 copy per reaction was reached. Unfortunately at this sensitivity the image becomes blurred and difficult to interpret due to the appearance of non-specific products. No such distortion was seen in the clinical samples, most likely because of the presence of nucleic acids originating from eukaryotic cells that non-specifically bind to dome of the primers (data not shown).",

Numerous molecular assays have been described, though in silico analysis reveals that the majority of these methods are based on the sequence of only a single viral isolate, and that their performance in laboratory settings is limited (data not shown). In the current study, a broad and sensitive panel of assays based on a two-step nested PCR was developed for the detection of a majority of human respiratory viruses. Selected primer sets, designed based on complete GenBank information, are complementary to 95-100% of the sequences of archival and contemporary viral strains. Such an approach limits the influence of intra-species sequence variability and facilitates the detection of contemporary and (most likely) newly emerging strains. The developed assays may thus be considered not only as detection techniques but also as a basic tool for virus discovery. The main disadvantage of developed tests is that detection is limited to viruses that belong to specific viral families/subfamilies, and they cannot be used for all viruses. Furthermore, the diversity of viral species in combination with their low load in clinical samples may result in false-negatives [41] . This particular feature makes these assays inferior to sequence-independent methods (e.g. VIDISCA), which can detect unknown pathogens [23, 42] . Then again, assays based on degenerated primers offer far higher sensitivity than those based on sequence-independent detection techniques.",

Thus far, no study has identified a novel human respiratory RNA virus using sequence independent amplification techniques. Even though several improvements have been proposed [47, 48, 49] , the sensitivity of these methods is inferior to that of nested or real-time PCR. In the current study, detection of viral pathogens was possible in ,76% of clinical samples, leaving ,24% of cases undiagnosed. Such a detection rate is consistent with that in previously published reports [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] .

The obtained results clearly show that the evaluated tests are highly specific and sensitive. Thorough testing showed that the developed primer sets do not cross react with other respiratory pathogens and are able to detect viruses in a wide range of clinical samples. Further, HAE cultures can be used for pre-amplification of the signal contained in the sample and to facilitate detection of pathogens by standard PCR or sequenceindependent methods. Based on these observations, one may hypothesize that the reported lack of an etiological agent in a proportion of patients suffering from respiratory disease may result not only from the presence of unknown viral species, but also from a lack of sensitivity of the available assays. Further studies, including VIDISCA analysis, will provide greater insights into the epidemiology of different strains and species, and may possibly allow the detection and identification of previously unknown viruses. Virus yield for all pathogens was assessed by titration on fully confluent susceptible cells, according to Reed and Muench formula [50] . Plates were incubated at 32uC or 37uC, and the cytopathic effect occurrence was scored using an inverted microscope.",
