            "text": "Background: The volume of influenza pandemic modelling studies has increased dramatically in the last decade. Many models incorporate now sophisticated parameterization and validation techniques, economic analyses and the behaviour of individuals. Methods: We reviewed trends in these aspects in models for influenza pandemic preparedness that aimed to generate policy insights for epidemic management and were published from 2000 to September 2011, i.e. before and after the 2009 pandemic. Results: We find that many influenza pandemics models rely on parameters from previous modelling studies, models are rarely validated using observed data and are seldom applied to low-income countries. Mechanisms for international data sharing would be necessary to facilitate a wider adoption of model validation. The variety of modelling decisions makes it difficult to compare and evaluate models systematically. Conclusions: We propose a model Characteristics, Construction, Parameterization and Validation aspects protocol (CCPV protocol) to contribute to the systematisation of the reporting of models with an emphasis on the incorporation of economic aspects and host behaviour. Model reporting, as already exists in many other fields of modelling, would increase confidence in model results, and transparency in their assessment and comparison.",

Epidemic models are especially useful to address epidemiological, economic, and individuals' behavioural questions [8] [9] [10] . The usefulness of epidemic models in directing mitigation efforts has been supported by empirical findings that have echoed previous modelling predictions. For instance, models predicted that reduced international air travel would be unlikely to stop an influenza pandemic [11] , a finding later verified empirically during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [12, 13] ; other models predicted the potential of antiviral prophylaxis and contact tracing to control small outbreaks [5] , a prediction also verified in real-life outbreaks in semiclosed army camps [14] .",

            "text": "For epidemic models to produce reasonable predictions on the course of the epidemic and how it can be controlled, we need to be confident that the model captures the essential mechanisms that drive the epidemic dynamics [15] . It is therefore essential to parameterize the model from available data [15, 16] and validate the model to increase its credibility [17] . One of the main focuses of this review is to evaluate the trends in the construction and validation of mechanistic modelsmodels that explicitly incorporate the mechanisms or processes underlying the outcomes of the systemof infection dynamics for influenza pandemic preparedness, control and mitigation. Traditionally, the main approach for mechanistic modelling of influenza pandemics has been based on compartmental models (Table 1) represented by systems of differential equations. Compartmental models represented the dynamics of a hostdisease system for which a tractable analytical solution could in principle be derived through mathematical methods [8, 18] . It was not until the widespread availability of modern computing power that more complex compartmental models for which analytical solutions could not be derived and agent-based models (ABMs, Table 1 ) explored using computer simulation became an attractive alternative. Recent modelling work, dealing with the threat of an influenza pandemic of avian origin (A-H5N1), with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis in 2003 and the H1N1 2009 pandemic, has exemplified the use of both models solved analytically and through simulation [3, 5, 19, 20] .",

To facilitate model understanding, this review focuses in three pandemic modelling aspects that are recently experimenting substantial innovations: parameterization and validation, economic aspects [26] and behaviour of the hosts [27] . Given the diversity of new techniques in these aspects of Table 1 Definitions of model types Compartmental epidemic models Models that divide the population according to states relevant to the disease studied and represent the rates at which individuals change state. These models are widely used in epidemic modelling and can be represented by systems of differential or difference equations or stochastic rates. For instance a SIR compartmental model would divide the population according to whether the individuals are susceptible (S), infectious (I) or recovered (R). Basic compartmental models assume perfect mixing between homogeneous individuals but can be expanded to account for instance for different transmission rates between ages (age-structured compartmental models), or other heterogeneities Network or random graph models Network (graph) models are models that characterize the relationships between individuals. Infection occurs only between individuals (nodes) that have a connection between them (arcs or edges).",

Among all models, the dominant parameterization strategy (used by 47% of the models) was to adopt parameters from previous studies, especially from other modelling studies perpetuating the use of parameters chosen by other modellers ( Figure 1A \"parameterization\"). 25% of the studies utilized information or parameters derived from epidemiological, laboratory (e.g. viral shedding duration, cohort studies) or case data (e.g. epidemic curves, attack rates) from other sources to parameterize the model. It was common (60%, Figure 1C ) to use some sort of sensitivity analysis and this was more frequent in models that did not directly adopt parameters from previous models, suggesting that sensitivity analysis was not used as a complement to reusing parameters from previous models. ABMs were more frequently built using parameters chosen by modellers in previous studies (70% Figure 1C ) and constructed from population demographic data, for instance from decennial censuses, rather than using empirical data or parameters obtained from epidemiological or laboratory studies.",

Several real-time pandemic modelling articles involved sophisticated methods of parameterization employing on-going observed case data, such as maximum likelihood estimation [9] or sequential particle filtering within a Bayesian framework [43] . or survey results [44, 45] ; serological data [36, 46] ; epidemic cases or mortality time series [1, [47] [48] [49] ; and observed time of pandemic peaks [11, 12] . Examples of parameterization from historical epidemic data in ABMs included calibration to reproduce attack or serological infection rates from previous pandemics [33, 41, 42, 50] . Parameterization from case data can be used to investigate policy effectiveness. For instance, Cauchemez et al. [4] evaluated the effectiveness of school closures for pandemic control in France and showed that prolonged school closures would potentially reduce the attack rate of a pandemic by 13-17% by using MCMC Bayesian computational methods to fit an age-structured household-based compartmental model to influenza surveillance data.",

As a result, some articles specialize in the statistical analysis that leads to parameter derivation and others specialize in the analysis of broad policy questions. There is however the risk that this approach may perpetuate faulty parameterisations from previous studies, or applies a valid parameter value to an inappropriate setting. On the other hand, informing too many parameters in the model by fitting to epidemic time series may run the risk of overfitting or non-identifiability. It may be most credible to inform model parameters using a combination of field or laboratory studies data (e.g. to fit or even directly inform parameters such as recovery rates) and epidemic case data (e.g. to fit transmission related parameters), and then compare fitted parameter values to those obtained from previous studies. One of the possible explanations why this combination of data sources is not common is data paucity, rendering the use of parameters chosen from other modelling studies as one of the few alternatives. One way to increase the pool of available data for model parameterization is to establish international data sharing mechanisms among governments and researchers, especially regarding disease transmission between individuals and surveys of population contact patterns [51] , to facilitate the construction of robust models.",

While such difficulties can be overcome, for instance using maximum likelihood estimation methods [9] , particle filtering [43] or other likelihood-based computational methods [4] (Table 3) , these require at least some mastery of modern statistical techniques and may be computationally intensive. For instance, Bayesian methods that use MCMC algorithms or approximate Bayesian computation methods can be particularly powerful and flexible tools (Table 2 ) [52] . These methods allow the merging of prior knowledge on the epidemic parameterssuch as those derived from datasets described in the literature-with observed data from the outbreak in question. In addition they allow rigorous parameterisation of models of the processes underlying highly censored data [44] . Bayesian computational methods can thus be used as a flexible and powerful way to perform inference on unobserved parameters. Software such as openBUGS [53] and JAGS [54] are making the use of MCMC algorithms for model fitting accessible to non-specialists.",

For instance, school closures-identified as effective strategies [4, 34, 64, 65] -of more than four weeks have been shown to burden the economy and even treble the costs arising from an influenza pandemic [66] . In addition, individuals who are economically active will involve a much higher economic burden by job absenteeism due to illness or care giving [67] . Considering the economic impacts of such heterogeneities at a social and individual level may change the optimal implementation of an intervention from what would be recommended based on epidemiological considerations alone (i.e. minimising disease burden). The inclusion of a cost-effectiveness outcome (e.g. cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained or per case averted) is a common approach which allows comparison of the value for money of different interventions for the same health problem (or even with other health problems when generic measures such as QALYs are used as the denominator).",

Not allowing feedback is reasonable if job absenteeism can be approximated as a sudden shock to the production systemsthough in reality the shock might be progressive or present several peaks-or if feedback from the economy into the epidemic is not expected. Examples of such feedback could be changes in individuals' commuting patterns or behaviour as the economy is affected or a potential loss of the financial capacity to mitigate the epidemic at the individual and government levels.",

The inclusion of the behaviour of the individuals during an influenza pandemic has heretofore been uncommon among compartmental models and has only recently started to receive attention [10, 44, 80, 81] . Although most pandemic models represent individuals as entities whose behaviour remains invariant, in reality, human behaviour might hinder or foster pandemic mitigation efforts, especially for severe pandemics like that of 1918. Very few compartmental models reviewed considered the effect of changes in behaviour on the impact of the pandemic (7%). New insights have been obtained by integrating compartmental models with game theory [44, 80] . For instance, Galvani et al [44] parameterized an epidemiological game-theoretic model from questionnaires on perceptions on influenza. The model was employed to compare self-interested behaviour from the elderly towards vaccination with the socially optimal behaviour that would involve vaccinating children to reduce overall transmission. The model identified how the individual and social equilibria differed more for seasonal influenza than for pandemic influenzabecause pandemic influenza might also pose a substantial risk to the young. This study illustrates how, as a result of including human behaviour in the model, the need to incentivize individuals to reduce overall influenza transmission can be identified.",

The inclusion of behaviour can lead to substantially different conclusions. For instance, if individuals perceive an epidemic as lifethreatening, they might change their commuting patterns, wear masks and take more extreme precautions [86] and as a result, a model not considering these behavioural changes would overestimate the attack rate and the number of fatalities that eventually would result from the epidemic. In a similar fashion, if individuals perceive an epidemic to be benign, vaccination rates and adoption of precautions may drop, undermining the effectiveness of control measures (evidence of both kinds of responses has been observed during the H1N1 2009 pandemic [81] ).",

Is the model based on past influenza pandemics? Is the model aimed at generating predictions for future pandemics used to inform policy making? Are the predictions intended to generate quantitative or qualitative policy insights? Theoretical basis What are the underlying assumptions that support the construction of the model or parts of the model? E.g. the law of mass action, rational choice theory. What are the geographical and temporal scales of the model? What are the state and control variables and the parameters? Is the model solved analytically through mathematical methods or simulated? What type of model is it? Dynamic aspects Is time modelled as discrete or continuous? What variables and processes occur or are updated at each time step? Construction aspects Initialization How is the model initialized? E.g. what proportion of individuals is initially infected? Data Is the model informed by data from previous pandemics? If so, what are the main sources of data in the model? Space Is the model spatially explicit or implicit? What is the spatial structure of the model? Are the expected heterogeneities of transmission reflected by this structure? Stochasticity Is the model stochastic or deterministic? How is stochasticity modelled? Are individuals grouped by some characteristic? (e.g. age, risk of infection). Complexity Have model results been compared with simplified versions of the model? How did results differ?To what extent has the increase in complexity in the model hindered its interpretability?Have sensitivity and uncertainty analyses been undertaken? What types of analyses were done, what were the outputs and parameter ranges considered? Were there sensitive or uncertain parameters that were taken directly from previous modelling studies and that might entail a risk of bias to the predictions? Are there alternative data sets to obtain those parameters? Have alternative scenarios for values of those parameters been considered?",
