Several FDA-approved drugs, including selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), possess selective anti-Ebola activities. However, the inhibitory mechanisms of these drugs remain elusive. By analyzing the structures of SERMs and their incidental biological activity (cholesterol accumulation), we hypothesized that this incidental biological activity induced by SERMs could be a plausible mechanism as to their inhibitory effects on Ebola infection. Herein, we demonstrated that the same dosages of SERMs which induced cholesterol accumulation also inhibited Ebola infection. SERMs reduced the cellular sphingosine and subsequently caused endolysosomal calcium accumulation, which in turn led to blocking the Ebola entry. Our study clarified the specific anti-Ebola mechanism of SERMs, even the cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs), this mechanism led to the endolysosomal calcium as a critical target for development of anti-Ebola drugs.",

Entry of Ebola virus into the cells, which is mainly mediated by its sole glycoprotein (GP), is a target for therapeutic intervention 3-7 . Ebola entry is unusual in that it requires proteolytic-priming of GP followed by engagement of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) 8-11 , Recently, it has been proven that the Ebola virus enters cells through the endolysosome that contain both NPC1 and the two-pore segment channel 2 (TPC2) 12 .",

Unfortunately, there are still no FDA-approved vaccines or anti-Ebola therapeutics 1,14 . Considering the time-consuming process of developing new drugs, it is more cost-and time-effective to screen for effective anti-Ebola drugs from among the drugs that are already FDA-approved. Some groups have identified 80 FDA-approved drugs with selective anti-Ebola activity, including the SERMs 3,4,6,7 . Many of these identified drugs selectively inhibit the infection of Ebola virus and do not inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. While the mechanism of inhibition is unknown, it is clear that these drugs do not inhibit the internalization of Ebola virus to the lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1)-positive lysosome, the acidification of the endolysosome, or the processing of Ebola GP cathepsin 3,4,6 . Moreover, the inhibition of Ebola entry by SERMs is independent of expression of the estrogen receptors, making the mechanism by which SERMs inhibit Ebola infection difficult to ascertain 15 .",

Much of the incidental biological activities of the CADs are related to their structural properties; several CADs are weak bases which are protonated after entering the low pH of the endolysosome. The ionized form of the CADs cannot pass through the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer that surrounds the endolysosome compartment, and are, therefore, trapped and concentrated inside 17 . The concentrated CADs in the endolysosome could disturb phospholipid metabolism, the transport of lipids and proteins, and the activity of enzymes in the endolysosome.",

In this study, we explored the relationships between Ebola infection inhibition and the adverse effect of SERMs. Using an LC-MS/MS assay and imaging of endolysosomal calcium release, we demonstrated that SERMs could reduce the cellular sphingosine levels and subsequently induce accumulation of endolysosomal calcium. Moreover, chelating luminal endocytic calcium with high-affinity Rhod-dextran induced the specific inhibition of Ebola infection without inhibiting the internalization of Ebola virus-like particle (VLP) to the TPC2+ endolysosome. These data support our hypothesis that SERMs (and potentially other CADs) induce sphingosine defects and subsequent endolysosomal calcium accumulation, which in turn inhibit the release of Ebola from the TPC2+ endolysosome.",

We choose the pNL4-3-Luc-R \u2212 E \u2212 based Ebola pseudovirion to study the Ebola entry, and the Ebola VLP-mcherry (composed by GP, VP40 and VP40-mcherry) to study the Ebola internalization. Then, we treated the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 with two SERMs (tamoxifen and clomiphene), and infected them with the Ebola pseudovirion. Both SERMs selectively inhibited the Ebola entry more than 90%; however, they did not inhibit the entry of the VSV or Influenza A (A/WSN/33(H1N1), WSN) pseudovirions (Fig. 1a) . Treatment with estrogen and estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists did not inhibit the Ebola pseudovirion entry (Fig. 1a) , excluding the possibility that SERMs inhibit the Ebola entry through the ER pathway.",

The Ebola pseudovirion assay demonstrated that SERMs inhibit Ebola entry starting from 1 \u03bc M (Fig. 2a) . Filipin staining also indicated that SERMs induce cholesterol accumulation at approximately 1 \u03bc M (Fig. 2b,d, Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Therefore, the dosages of SERMs required to induce cholesterol accumulation matches the dosages of SERMs required for Ebola entry inhibition, which implies that this incidental biological activity of SERMs are related to the Ebola entry inhibition mechanism. Intriguingly, the cholesterol accumulation appeared after 8 h of SERMs incubation (Fig. 2c,e) , whereas the Ebola virus has already entered the cytoplasm at approximately 2 h 36 . Thus, we speculated that intercellular changes within 2 h after SERM treatment should mediate the cholesterol accumulation and the inhibition of Ebola entry. (a) Effects of E 2 , ICI, tamoxifen, and clomiphene on Ebola/WSN/VSV pseudovirion entry. HepG2 cells were pretreated with 10 nM E2, 100 nM ICI, 10 \u03bc M tamoxifen, and 10 \u03bc M clomiphene for 1 h and infected by Ebola/WSN/VSV pseudovirion with compounds for 24 h. The cells were then lysed, and the luciferase assay was carried out. NH 4 Cl serves as a negative control. (b) Representative images of colocalization of VLPs (red, marked by mCheery-VP40) with TPC2 (green, marked with EGFP) and LAMP1 (blue, marked with BFP) from 10 \u03bc M tamoxifen or 10 \u03bc M clomiphene treated HepG2.

Ebola virion is thought to be internalized into endolysosome primarily through micropinocytosis [39] [40] [41] , meanwhile the heavily glycosylated mucin-like domain and glycan cap of GP1 is removed by the low pH-dependent Cathepsins L and B, resulting in a 17-to 19-kDa GP1 42, 43 . Proteolytic processing of GP expose the GP1 receptor binding domain (RBD), which interact with the NPC1 domain C within the endolysosome 44, 45 . This interaction between GP1 and NPC1 domain C and low pH conditions are essential for subsequent membrane fusion 15, 34, 46 . However, whether there is other membrane fusion trigger factor remains unclear. Recently, it has been proven that TPC2 plays a key role in Ebola virus infection and the Ebola virus enters cells through the endolysosome that contain both NPC1 and TPC2 47, 48 . Although the definite role of TPC2 is uncertain, as a calcium channel, it may involve the movement of endosomes containing Ebola virus or the membrane fusion.",

Thus, we first speculated that the CADs with selective anti-Ebola activity may interact with NPC1 to disturb the interaction between NPC1 domain C and Ebola primed GP. However, we did not detect any interactions of tamoxifen/ clomiphene/U18666a with NPC1 domains A or C. In accordance with our results, another group also showed that clomiphene and U18666a do not disturb the interaction of NPC1 domain C and Ebola primed GP 3 . Recently, a study demonstrated that U18666a interacts with the NPC1 sterol-sensing domain (SSD) to inhibit NPC1 function and cholesterol transport; however, the authors emphasized that the inhibition of Ebola requires 100-fold higher concentrations of U18666A. They therefore excluded the possibility that U18666a interacts with the SSD of NPC1 to inhibit the Ebola entry 49 . Thus, these data demonstrate that NPC1 is not the target of CADs during Ebola entry inhibition.",

The majority of these CADs having selective anti-Ebola activity have the similar structural properties (pKa > 8, logP > 3) (Supplementary Fig. S6a ). Based on their structural properties, most CADs are protonated, trapped, and finally concentrated in the acid endolysosome compartment 27 . Due to the liposolubility of CADs, they insert into the lipid bilayer of endolysosome and disturb the metabolism of lipids and the transport of several components, leading to the DIP, cholesterol accumulation, and/or functional inhibition of ASM (Supplementary Fig. S6b) . Moreover, most CADs induce their incidental biological activities at micromolar concentrations, which match the concentrations of inhibition Ebola infection by CADs. Thus, it is possible that CADs inhibit Ebola entry through their incidental biological activities. A filipin staining and Ebola pseudovirion entry assay demonstrated that SERMs and U18666a induce the cholesterol accumulation and inhibit the Ebola entry at the same concentration (approximately 1 \u03bc M); however, the cholesterol accumulation (8 h) appeared after Ebola entry into the cytoplasm (2 h), implying that something changed within 2 h after the SERMs treatment to mediate the cholesterol accumulation and the inhibition of Ebola entry.",

This discrepancy might be due to the different cell types and/or the different treatment dosages of U18666a used. In agreement with our results, much research has demonstrated that CADs can induce the detachment of ASM protein from the inner endolysosome membranes leading to inactivation. Several CADs have been identified as functional inhibitor of ASM 27 , and Elojeimy et al. have demonstrated that some CADs also inhibit the activity of AC 50 . Due to the metabolic pathways of sphingomyelin, the inhibition of ASM and AC both decrease the cellular sphingosine. It has been reported that Ebola infection requires ASM activity 51 , so CADs could inhibit Ebola entry through the inhibition of ASM activity. However, how ASM is involved in Ebola infection is still unknown; future studies are needed to better understand the molecular mechanism of ASM and Ebola entry.",

In vitro, the conformational change of membrane-bound Ebola fusion peptide, which is required for the vesicle fusion, is dependent on calcium concentrations 52 . Moreover, the proteins in endolysosomal calcium channels, TPC1 and TPC2, recently have been identified as key players in Ebola entry. The inhibitors for TPCs can block nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)-stimulated calcium outflow and Ebola infection 47 . The sphingosine treatment could induce the deregulation of endolysosomal calcium 53 , and a subsequent study demonstrated that TPC1 and TPC2 (mainly TPC1) mediate the endolysosomal calcium response to sphingosine 54 . Consistent with these results, we proved that SERMs and U18666a decrease the sphingosine and increase the endolysosomal calcium. In addition, chelating luminal endocytic calcium with high-affinity Rhod-dextran also blocks Ebola infection, but not the internalization of Ebola VLP to TPC2+ lysosome. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the endolysosomal calcium is involved in Ebola infection and is also possible involved in the Ebola-endolysosome membrane fusion event.",

This study revealed the mechanism of Ebola inhibition by toremifene, however, binding and destabilize GP may not play the major role in other situation. Firstly, the author informed that residues lining the binding site are highly conserved among filoviruses except Marburg virus (MARV), suggesting that MARV may not bind these drugs, but it has been proven that toremifene and clomiphene (even other CADs) could effectively inhibit the infection of MARV 4,6 . Secondly, compared to the ethyl chlorine of toremifene, the corresponding ethyl group in tamoxifen and chlorine in clomiphene make weaker interations with the binding sites in Ebola GP 16 , and the obvious structural differences of raloxifene (and other CADs with anti-Ebola activities) with toremifene make the interactions more weaker (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). However, all these drugs can effectively inhibit the Ebola infection 3,4,6,7 . Thirdly, many of CADs with anti-Ebola activities inhibit Ebola and/or MARV infection at similar kinetics (inhibition > 90% at 10 \u03bc M) 3,4,6,7 , which is hard explained by interaction with GP. Therefore, the binding with GP plays a major role in Ebola inhibition by toremifene, but may not in the Ebola or MARV inhibition by toremifene, tamoxifen, clomiphene, raloxifene or U18666a (even other CADs with anti-Ebola activities).",

Based on previous studies and our results, we proposed a hypothesis of the Ebola infection (Fig. 6) . Under normal conditions, Ebola is internalized by the NPC1+ /TPC2+ endolysosome 55 , in which the primed GP interacts with NPC1 domain C 34 . The ASM and AC in the endolysosome then hydrolyze sphingomyelin to sphingosine 27 . The elevated sphingosine induces endolysosomal calcium outflow through TPC1 and TPC2 54 . Both the local calcium flux and the interaction of primed GP with NPC1 domain C induce conformational changes in the Ebola fusion peptide, triggering the membrane fusion during the Ebola infection 34 . When treated with CADs that have selective anti-Ebola activities, including SERMs and U18666a, the CADs are protonated and trapped inside the acidic endolysosome 27 . Due to their structural properties, these concentrated CADs induce the detachment of the ASM protein from membranes, which inactivates the ASM and in turn leads to a decrease in sphingosine 27 ",

VSV and WSN pseudovirions were generated in an identical fashion, but with the substitution of a plasmid encoding VSV GP or WSN HA/NA. Culture supernatant at 24 hour posttransfection (hpt) was collected and replaced with the fresh media. A second harvest was conducted at 48 hpt. All harvests were pooled and cleared of cell debris by two sequential centrifugations at 1070 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. VLPs in the cleared supernatant were then pelleted through 20% sucrose [in 20 mM Hepes, 130 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (HNB)] at 112,398 g (25,000 rpm) in an SW28 rotor for 2 hours at 4 \u00b0C. Pelleted VLPs were then resuspended overnight in 10% sucrose (in HNB; 1/100 of original volume of culture medium collected), aliquoted, and stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C.",

            "text": "Proposed hypothesis of Ebola entry inhibition by CADs.Under normal conditions, Ebola is internalized by the NPC1+ /TPC2+ endolysosome, in which the primed GP interacts with NPC1 domain C. The ASM and AC in the endolysosome then hydrolyze sphingomyelin to sphingosine. The elevated sphingosine induces endolysosomal calcium outflow through TPC1 and TPC2. Both the local calcium flux and the interaction of primed GP with NPC1 domain C induce conformational changes in the Ebola fusion peptide, triggering the membrane fusion during the Ebola infection. When treated with CADs that have selective anti-Ebola activities, including SERMs and U18666a, the CADs are protonated and trapped inside the acidic endolysosome. Due to their structural properties, these concentrated CADs induce the detachment of the ASM protein from membranes, which inactivates the ASM and in turn leads to a decrease in sphingosine. Without sufficient sphingosine, the endolysosome calcium outflow mediated by TPC1 and TPC2 are blocked, leading the endolysosome calcium accumulation. Without the calcium flux, there is no conformational change of the Ebola fusion peptide. Thus, there is neither membrane fusion nor Ebola infection.Scientific RepoRts | 7:41226 | DOI: 10.1038/srep41226",
