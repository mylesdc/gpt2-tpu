In addition, OLP may be associated with HCV-related liver disease. We investigated the visual analogue scale (VAS) and effects of oral care gel, REFRECARE-H \u00ae , on patients with OLP associated with HCV infection. Results: Nine OLP patients (mean age 67.9 \u00b1 7.6 years) with HCV-related liver diseases were recruited and their VAS score determined along with a biochemical examination of the blood. Types of OLP included erosive (6 patients) and reticular (3). REFRECARE-H \u00ae , an oral care gel (therapeutic dentifrice) containing hinokitiol, was applied by each patient as a thin layer on the oral membrane, after each meal and at bedtime for 30 days. Application of REFRECARE-H \u00ae improved the quality of life in all terms of dry mouth, breath odor, oral freshness, oral pain during rest, oral pain at a mealtimes, taste disorder, loss of appetite, sleep disorder, depressive mood and jitteriness. VAS scores of dry mouth, breath odor, oral freshness, and sleep disorder were significantly increased 30 days after application of REFRECARE-H \u00ae (P = 0.01, P = 0.05, P = 0.03, P = 0.04). VAS scores of oral pain at a mealtimes and taste disorder were increased 30 days after application of REFRECARE-H \u00ae (P = 0.06). There was an absence of side effects. Conclusions: REFRECARE-H \u00ae improved the quality of life for OLP. It is necessary for the hepatologist to educate patients regarding oral hygiene, as well as provide treatment of liver disease.",

Some patients had decreased sensitivity of taste despite the fact that they were unaware of their taste disorder. In addition, poor oral health has been reported for HCV-infected patients [16] [17] [18] [19] . In our previous study, dental problems delayed the initiation of IFN therapy for a maximum of 105 days [7] . HCV-infected patients treated with IFN therapy should be managed by intensive oral care because of lower resistance to infection during the therapy. With regard to the painful OLP, it is just conceivable that an oral cavity with HCV infection is likely to become less healthy than one without HCV infection. It is necessary for a hepatologist to educate patients regarding oral ",
