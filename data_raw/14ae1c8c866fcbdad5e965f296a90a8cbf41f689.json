These methods have had a positive impact in the field of virology and helped to further our knowledge of how viruses invade cells. Nearly all positive-strand RNA viruses propagate their viral genomes in part through intracellular membranes. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an Arterivirus, accumulates viral RNA that forms replication complexes (RCs) in infected cells. In this study, using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy (EM), we dissected PRRSV-induced membrane structures in infected cells and determined the correlations between PRRSV particles and vesicles stimulated by PRRSV to understand the structural and dynamic aspects of PRRSV infection.",

PRRSV is a small, enveloped, positive-strand RNA viral pathogen that encodes a polycistronic RNA genome consisting of a 15-kb long 3'-polyadenylation molecule that is responsible for detrimental reproductive disturbance, post-weaning pneumonia, growth disorders, low physiological performance, and a notable death rate in the swine industry. The first outbreaks of PRRSV were reported in Germany in 1990 and were farflung throughout Europe by 1991 [2] . The outbreak of PRRSV in China in 2006 received global attention [3] . To date, PPRSV continues to spread and cause severe economic losses in the porcine industry worldwide.",

Dramatic membrane rearrangements, which support viral replication and assembly, often occur in host cells upon virus invasion [4] . Widespread virus-induced membrane remodelling is the most prominent morphological feature observed in images of PRRSV-infected cells. This phenomenon was described more than 20 years ago, and the shapes, properties and formation mechanisms of these replicative structures have been characterized [5] . It has been shown that PRRSV mRNA is translated into a single polyprotein associated with certain organelles, such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and these structures are morphologically similar to autophagosomes [6, 7] . Synchronously, the polyprotein is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases, which produce individual proteins required for later viral RNA synthesis and virion assembly. Furthermore, several studies have identified extensive cytoskeletal alterations induced by various members of the order Nidovirales. For instance, microtubule networks and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) are reorganized in cells infected with EAV, and the innate immune system interfaces with the formation of replication organelles [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "Some positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses induce membranous vesicles (MVs) to assemble virus replication complexes (RC) in infected cells. To a certain extent, viral RNA synthesis and the formation of replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) benefit from induced MVs. It is believed that viral proteins, RNA and some factors from the host cell create a scaffold for RCs, favouring viral RNA synthesis [12] . Additionally, membranes induced by the virus assist viral RNA, especially double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), with escaping the host immune response to replicate [13] . Different viruses form their RCs on specific cellular organelles, such as the outer mitochondrial membrane, the ER [14] [15] [16] , the Golgi complex [16, 17] or the plasma membrane [15, 18] . Benefitting from electron microscopy (EM) and electron tomography (ET) technology, many studies have described the membrane rearrangements induced by positive-strand RNA viruses, including nodavirus (flock house virus), flaviviruses (dengue, West Nile and hepatitis C virus) and togavirus (rubella virus). Of note, in studies of other members of Nidovirales, the replication of EAV and three coronaviruses, specifically mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [19] , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) [20] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), induced membrane rearrangement, including DMVs and reticular inclusions or complex membranes [20, 21] . DMVs were also observed during infection with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), another coronavirus, and a small proportion of these DMVs were connected to the ER through their outer membrane, forming a zipped ER region [22] .",

In addition, nidoviruses such as corona-and arteriviruses induce reticulovesicular networks (RVNs) of interconnected ERderived DMVs and other membrane rearrangements. The RVN is thought to provide a location for viral replication or assembly and to protect the RC from innate immune detection [8] . However, in PRRSV-infected cells, the three-dimensional architecture of the membrane network, its occurrence, and the site of RNA replication have not yet been elucidated. A study was conducted in the 1990s to describe host cell modifications during PRRSV replication, but no other in-depth research has been conducted to identify the particular role of PRRSV virions in cell membrane rearrangement [5] . Here, we elucidated viral RNA, protein synthesis and particle release sites and described the details of PRRSV-induced membrane rearrangement. Finally, we identified potential sites for the synthesis of viral RNA that may be released.",

Viral titres were measured to quantify infectious, cell-interacting viruses.

The nucleocapsid structural protein is dispensable for genome replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription [27] . Immunostaining results also showed that the concentration of viral N protein increased until 24 h.p.i. and then reached a plateau ( Fig  1C) .

PRRSV is a positive-strand RNA virus that generates negative-strand RNA during propagation and transcription, and this negative-strand RNA is employed as a template for the assembly of positive-strand RNA. This process produces dsRNA intermediates, and dsRNA detection in virus-infected cells reflects viral replication. Cells contain many organelles; the ER is the main site involved in protein synthesis, and the autophagosome is involved in the phagocytic cell's own metabolism and invading molecules or viruses. Mitochondrial metabolism provides energy for cells, and lysosomes are responsible for the decomposition of certain types of metabolized organic matter. In mock-infected cells, low amounts of dsRNA or N protein were immunolabeled (S1 Fig). At 24 h.p.i., Marc-145 cells infected with PRRSV were fixed, and PRRSV dsRNA, N protein and cellular proteins were detected using mono-specific antibodies, antibodies (calnexin, LC3) and organelle markers (MitoTracker, LysoTracker), respectively. To better explain the colocalization of two markers, we quantified the overlap coefficient using Pearson's correlation, and values above 0.5 indicated colocalization. PRRSV dsRNA and N protein were mainly located outside of the nucleus and colocalized with calnexin or LC3 (Fig 4A, 4B , 4E, 4F and 4I), with Pearson's correlation values of 0.65\u00b10.10, 0.60\u00b10.11, 0.75\u00b10.09 and 0.68\u00b10.08, respectively. Additionally, colocalization was detected between N protein and MitoTracker RED, which is a marker of mitochondria (Fig 4H and 4I) , with a Pearson's correlation value of 0.56\u00b10.10; however, PRRSV dsRNA and MitoTracker RED demonstrated little evidence of colocalization (0.19\u00b10.07) (Fig 4D and 4I ). Neither PRRSV protein N nor dsRNA colocalized with lysosomes stained with LysoTracker (0.17\u00b10.08 and 0.17\u00b10.10) (Fig 4C, 4G and 4I ). In conclusion, the ER and autophagosomes were the sites of viral replication and assembly, while some virus particles may have attached to the mitochondria. ",

Compared with mock-infected cells (Fig 5A) , dsRNA coated with gold particles in PRRSV-infected cells was almost uniquely associated with vesicles or the ER (Fig 5A') but was not significantly correlated with other organelles, such as the mitochondria (Fig 5B and 5B') . Similarly, we used the IEM method to gold-label the viral structural N protein. PRRSV-induced vesicles were apparent, and immunogold labelling revealed vesicles containing the N protein of PRRSV (Fig 5C and  5C' ). Some N protein was also associated with mitochondria ( Fig 5D and 5D' ). In addition, we observed gold particles in the cytoplasm.

In this work, we combined ET, IEM and a number of molecular biology tools to generate a model of PRRSV-infected cells. Our results confirmed that the DMV structures in Marc-145 cells are induced by PRRSV; these DMV structures are similar to the RVN structures induced by EAV. However, the vesicles were notably smaller than those produced by coronaviruses. An integrated analysis of membrane remodeling during PRRSV replication and assembly Previous transmission EM studies in EAV-infected cells revealed that cellular membrane rearrangement is reduced by virus infection [33] . Using Marc-145 cells as a model, our study demonstrates a correlation between functional membrane remodelling and RNA synthesis during PRRSV replication (Fig 1) . We comprehensively monitored membrane rearrangements and viral replication every 4 h from 0 to 16 h.p.i. and every 12 h after 24 h.p.i. DMVs appeared at 16 h.p.i. and became larger at 24 h.p.i.; during this period, levels of newly synthesized viral RNA began to increase. These results imply a link between membrane remodelling and RNA synthesis. However, at 36 h.p.i., the size and number of DMVs were not significantly different, and large numbers of vacuolar structures appeared (Fig 3) . We inferred that the decreased viral RNA synthesis rate we observed was mainly attributable to increased viral genome packaging in the cytoplasm, resulting in an increased rate of viral particle release, thus preventing RNA accumulation. This may be induced by the consumption of RNA produced by the cells.",

The formation of RTCs is induced by positive-strand RNA viruses during infection; these RTCs contain viral proteins, host proteins, viral nucleic acids, and the host ER membrane and dsRNA formed during virus replication.

Polioviruses demonstrate extensive membrane recombination derived from sections of an anterograde membrane trafficking system to produce single-membrane vesicles and DMVs and form complex network structures [16] . Data from other studies have shown that the propagation of positive-stranded RNA viruses is connected to intracellular membranes; virus-induced membrane alterations are connected with viral RNA replication, including genome replication, and involve changes in the mitochondria and Golgi [9] [10] [11] 38] . Plant pathogens such as BBSV induce widespread rearrangement of the ER to form dotted spots or plaques in the cytoplasm, and tomato bushy stunt virus induces more peroxisomal and chloroplast remodelling [39] . In our research, PRRSV infection produced large numbers of vesicles, most of which were connected with the ER membrane structure and part of the constructed RVNs (Fig 6) . Notably, DMVs contained a channel linking their exterior to the ER. The diameter of this channel, which connected PRRSV-induced vesicles with the cytoplasm, must be sufficiently large for the exchange of RNA products and nucleotides with cytoplasm. This result is consistent with our hypothesis that this channel provides the required components for viral RNA synthesis sites. Our results suggest that the pattern of cellular pathology produced by PRRSV infection is similar to those of HCV and SARS-CoV and results in large numbers of complex structures that affect the reorganization of cellular membrane structures.",

It has been reported that pre-assembled nucleocapsid budding occurs on intracellular membranes [40] . Some previous studies provided particularly interesting EM observations from low-temperature electrophysiological experiments showing the structure of PRRSV particles extending from the cytosol to the budding process [41] . The core was described as a double-layered hollow structure with an average diameter of 39 nm. ET was first used to demonstrate the 3D resolution of the FHV replication complex [42] . This technique has since been applied to characterize the 3D characteristics of a variety of positivestrand RNA viruses, including Picornaviridae viruses, Flaviviridae viruses, hepatitis C virus and Coronaviridae viruses [10, 43] . In this study, ET captured viral particles budding from the ER membrane (Fig 7) . Viral particles are synthesized in vesicles derived from the ER and are secreted into the cytoplasm to exert their viral activities [19] . These structures have previously been detected exclusively in flavivirus [31] and coronavirus-infected cells. These similar results imply that certain positive-strand RNA viruses accomplish their replication and assembly by inducing the formation of replication complexes [44] .",

However, we identified some differences between membrane structures caused by PRRSV infection and other related viruses as well as novel membrane structures. These membrane structures are similar to the RNA synthesis sites confirmed for other positive single-stranded RNA viruses. More importantly, for the first time, we used ET to reconstitute nidovirus particle synthesis sites. Further research should investigate whether vesicles provide sites for PRRSV RNA synthesis and determine which viral proteins induce membrane rearrangement. To our knowledge, this study is the first to present the PRRSV-induced membrane changes associated with viral RNA replication in 3D models.",

The findings of this study are valuable for understanding the life cycle of PRRSV-invaded cells in vitro. 7) . The animation according to the tomogram shows that most virus particles were observed within the vesicle and that one particle was budding into the outside of the membrane vesicle, suggesting that these vesicles are the locations of PRRSV particle assembly and secretion.
