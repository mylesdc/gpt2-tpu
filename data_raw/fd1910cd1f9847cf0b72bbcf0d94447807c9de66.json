            "text": "Background: Emerging viral diseases, most of which are caused by the transmission of viruses from animals to humans, pose a threat to public health. Discovering pathogenic viruses through surveillance is the key to preparedness for this potential threat. Next generation sequencing (NGS) helps us to identify viruses without the design of a specific PCR primer. The major task in NGS data analysis is taxonomic identification for vast numbers of sequences. However, taxonomic identification via a BLAST search against all the known sequences is a computational bottleneck. Description: Here we propose an enhanced lowest-common-ancestor based method (ELM) to effectively identify viruses from massive sequence data. To reduce the computational cost, ELM uses a customized database composed only of viral sequences for the BLAST search. At the same time, ELM adopts a novel criterion to suppress the rise in false positive assignments caused by the small database. As a result, identification by ELM is more than 1,000 times faster than the conventional methods without loss of accuracy. Conclusions: We anticipate that ELM will contribute to direct diagnosis of viral infections. The web server and the customized viral database are freely available at http://bioinformatics.czc.hokudai.ac.jp/ELM/.",

The 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus spread worldwide through reassortment that exchanged a gene segment between pigs and humans [1] . Recently, cases of influenza A virus H7N9 transmitted from birds to humans have been reported [2] . The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak originated from the transmission of a novel bat coronavirus [3] . For the sporadically endemic Ebola virus, bats are suspected to be the natural reservoir, but this is still controversial [4] . Vector-borne zoonoses caused by transmission of viruses through mosquitoes and ticks have also become a public health concern. The 1999 outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) that occurred in New York was caused by the transmission of the WNV among birds, horses and humans via mosquitoes [5] . Similarly, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) was found to be due to a virus transmitted by ticks [6] .",

However, at the 6th taxonomic level, the assignments of Ictalurid herpesvirus 1, Simian adenovirus 3 and Human adenovirus 54 were also changed, suggesting that ELM failed to exclude the false assignment of Ictalurid herpesvirus 1. On the other hand, ELM excluded the most of the false assignments (IF <2.54, ranging from 20% to 100%). These results suggested that we could find out true assignments mainly by high inflation indices and partly by low taxonomic levels. The results for viruses identified using ELM with BLASTN viruses were assembled using SSAKE v3.8.1 [19] and are summarized in Table 3 . Next, we evaluated the effect of the BLAST hit score on the inflation indices. The results showed that the inflation indices had little association with the E-value in the BLAST search (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). We also investigated the coverage of the BLAST hits. Valid hits in dataset 1 were distributed across target genomic sequences but not a specific genomic sequence, something not seen in datasets 2 and 3 (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ).",

We identified the shift of Kobuvirus in dataset 4 to Bocavirus and Dependovirus in dataset 5, which depended on the age of the piglets (Table 4 ). These results were consistent with abundant virus genera described in the literature [18] . However, we failed to identify pig stool-associated small circular DNA virus in dataset 5 (Table 4 ). This virus belongs to the single-stranded circular DNA viruses. The members of this family show extensive genetic diversity [20] . The results suggested that, in this case, the inflation index was not preferable for evaluating the LCA assignments.",

Though short reads can reduce the accuracy of BLAST searches, in this study we verified ELM for average lengths of between 73 and 400 bases. The results showed no difference between the capabilities for taxonomic assignment. One approach to reduce the computational time needed for the BLAST search is the subtraction of reads by mapping host-derived reads onto reference sequences [18] , this virus is the novel pig stool-associated single-stranded DNA virus, which is not assigned to a specific genus. [21, 22] . This approach might be considered effective for reducing analyzed sequence data but is limited to known hosts. It is not suitable for surveillance of wild animals or metagenomic analysis because the host sequences have yet to be deposited in databases. Therefore, we need to decide a moderate threshold for NGS data before the mapping.",

The difficulty in applying this approach directly to virus identification was the increase of false positive assignments (Figure 4) . We tested several ways to solve this problem. As shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1 , changing the threshold of the E-value dependent on the size of the database is probably not effective for discriminating between true and false assignments. The criteria for evaluating breadth coverage, i.e. the proportion of reads mapped across the hit genomes and the depth coverage (the number of reads mapped at a position), also failed to identify the target viruses (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ). On the other hand, ELM analyzed how sequence similarity to the relatives changes. This extension of the LCA method suppressed the rise in false positive assignments. A limitation of ELM would be the false-negative errors because ELM cannot detect viruses distantly related to other relatives (Table 4 ). Therefore, viruses without relatives should be carefully handled without the inflation index.",
