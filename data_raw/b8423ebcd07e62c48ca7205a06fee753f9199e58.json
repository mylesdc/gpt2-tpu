Using dates of exposure and illness onset, we categorized cases into three groups according to the availability of these datasets. The infection process was parametrically modeled by generation, and convolution of the infection process and the incubation period was fitted to the data. By estimating the effective reproduction number, we determined that the effect of dengue risk communication together with mosquito control from 28 August 2014 was insufficiently large to lower the reproduction number to below 1. However, once Yoyogi Park was closed on 4 September, the value of the effective reproduction number began to fall below 1, and the associated relative reduction in the effective reproduction number was estimated to be 20%-60%. The mean incubation period was an estimated 5.8 days.",

By retrospectively analyzing data of the first autochthonous dengue epidemic of the 21st century in Tokyo, Japan, we assessed the effectiveness of the interventions. Once a dengue outbreak was PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.confirmed in late August 2014, the government of Japan took drastic mosquito control measures, targeting both adults and larvae. News of the outbreak was also widely disseminated via mass media along with experts' recommendations as to how people could avoid the risks of dengue infection. As the outbreak was not immediately controlled, the focal area of transmission, Yoyogi Park, was closed on 4 September. Using a mathematical model, we assessed how well dengue virus transmission was intervened in relation to the start times of interventions. As we incorporated precise timing into the model, we directly modeled the time of infection and accounted for the time delay from infection to illness onset. Thus, we revealed that mosquito control and risk communication measures alone could not interrupt the chain of transmission; however, adding park closure to these interventions was substantially effective in reducing the number of transmissions.",

There are four antigenically related serotypes (DENV1 to 4) , and first infection with one serotype is often self-limiting [5] , eliciting specific acquired immunity. However, following primary infection with one serotype, infected and recovered individuals remain prone to secondary infection with other serotypes that could induce a clinically severe form of infection, including dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [6, 7] . DENV infections are seen mostly in tropical and subtropical countries, but nonendemic areas in temperate regions are also at risk [5, [8] [9] [10] [11] , owing partly to the changing ecological dynamics of vector abundance, perhaps induced by global warming [12] and an increased volume of international travel [13] . Although vaccination is partly underway in endemic countries, concrete plans for the prevention and specific treatment of dengue have yet to be fully established [7, 14] . Moreover, the possible drawbacks of vaccination in lowendemicity settings remain a controversial issue [7] .",

However, Japan has experienced a steady increase in the number of imported cases, mainly from South and Southeast Asian countries [15] [16] [17] . Despite only sporadic abundance of Aedes aegypti, the species Aedes albopictus is widespread across Honshu Island and all western parts of Japan, theoretically allowing for chains of dengue transmission to exist [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Dengue was eliminated in the country by 1945 and transmission has not been observed for 70 years [24] ; however, a German traveler visiting Japan in the summer of 2013 was later diagnosed with DENV2 infection upon returning to Germany [25] . In 2014, autochthonous transmission was confirmed in metropolitan Tokyo [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] , resulting in a large outbreak involving a total of 160 confirmed cases, a shockingly high incidence for a previously dengue-free nation. It is now recognized that Japan is indeed at risk of dengue outbreaks during the summer season, indicating that a certain risk exists for the summer Olympic Games in 2020. This threat requires concrete planning for possible countermeasures in the event of another outbreak.",

            "text": "The 2014 dengue outbreak in central Tokyo was caused by a single serotype, DENV1, which showed high homology with the predominant circulating serotype in Southeast Asia [26] . There were two notable characteristics of this outbreak. First, of the total 160 people with a confirmed dengue diagnosis, 129 had visited or worked near Yoyogi Park, a national park that belongs to Shibuya Ward. Shibuya is a special ward that is a major commercial and business center. Shibuya has one of the busiest railway stations in the city, Shibuya Station, about 1 km from the park. Dengue transmission was concentrated in the park, where relatively high vector competence (mean biting rate 7.1 bites per person per 8 minutes) was observed [32] . Second, a few local residents seemed to remain for extended periods in Yoyogi Park (i.e., perhaps homeless people), and these people appeared to have been infected at a higher frequency than other individuals [33] ; however, the role of these individuals in amplifying transmission as primary cases has not been verified. Once the outbreak was recognized in late August 2014, concerted efforts were made to contain spread of the virus, including mosquito control targeting both adults and larvae, disseminating news of the outbreak via mass media, communication of dengue risk by experts to raise public awareness, and even a total ban on entering the park. Descriptive documents with details of the outbreak are available but are mostly limited to Japanese language [26, 28, 30, 33, 34] . However, the effectiveness of interventions during the outbreak remains an important epidemiological question.",

The index case produces generation 1, and the size of generation 1 is R 0 cases with the relative timing of infection following g t (i.e., following the infection time of the index case, there would be R 0 g t cases on day t). Subsequently, generation 1 produces R 1 cases of generation 2, where R 1 is the reproduction number of generation 1, and there would be R 0 R 1 (g \ufffd g) t cases as a function of time since index case t, where \ufffd is the convolution operator. If there are only two generations (excluding generation zero), the expected value of the incidence at t days since infection in the index case is R 0 g t + R 0 R 1 (g \ufffd g) t .

Unknown parameters \u03b8n = {\u03bc lP , \u03c3 lP , \u03bc Trans , \u03c3 Trans , R 1 , R 2 , . . ., R n\u22121 , \u03b5 1 , \u03b5 2 } were estimated using a maximum likelihood method. The exact number of generations was unknown; thus, we fit three different models with a variable number of generations (i.e., n = 2, 3, and 4 excluding generation 0) and later compared the Akaike information criterion values with a correction for small sample size (AICc) and mean squared error (MSE). We did not consider additional generations, because more generations unrealistically required shorter duration of the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). As a sensitivity analysis, we compared models with and without \u03b5 1 and \u03b5 2 , i.e., models in which (i) two effectiveness measures are jointly estimated (i.e., \u03b5 1 6 \u00bc1 and \u03b5 2 6 \u00bc1), (ii) only the park closure effect is estimated (\u03b5 1 = 1 and \u03b5 2 6 \u00bc1), (iii) only mosquito control and public awareness campaigns are factored in (\u03b5 1 6 \u00bc1 and \u03b5 2 = 1), and (iv) no effect of control measures are taken into account (\u03b5 1 = 1 and \u03b5 2 = 1). To this end, we fixed the generation time distribution, using parameters informed from the best model with \u03b5 1 6 \u00bc1 and \u03b5 2 6 \u00bc1 and jointly estimated only R i and these effectiveness parameters, comparing AICc values across different models.",

Regardless of the assumed number of generations, the first generation (i.e., generation 1) coincided with a small peak in the epidemic curve on 14 August; generation 2 was considered to be primarily responsible for the highest peak at the end of August (Fig 3B-3D ). Only when generation 4 was assumed to have existed, generation 3 was considered responsible for a small peak on about 7 September 2014. Table 2 summarizes the parameter estimates derived from the identified best model, given the assumed number of generations. The mean generation time from DENV infection in a human to another DENV infection in a human via a mosquito bite (i.e., \u03bc IP + \u03bc Trans ) was estimated at 17.2 days, 16.1 days, and 12.4 days for the assumed number of generations 2, 3, and 4, respectively. As the assumed number of generations increased, the estimated mean and standard deviation became significantly smaller, reflecting that the explainable transmission dynamics greatly varied by the assumed number of generations. The reproduction numbers in the absence of interventions were greater than the value of 1 by generation 2 (i.e., R 1 ) for the three models, and by generation 3 (i.e., R 2 ) if the assumed number of generations was 4. It should be noted that if the number of generations was 2, then the reproduction number of generation 3 (i.e., R 2 ) was not estimated but must have been zero (owing to the absence of generation 3). It should be noted that the latest estimate of R i was below the value of 1 and this was not surprising, because the epidemic came to an end in October 2014.",

Because the anticipated number of generations of infection was limited, and also because we sought to conduct careful evaluation of the causal association between the timing of interventions and the effective reproduction number R t , we did not use the structured compartmental modeling approach (e.g., using ordinary differential equations). Instead, we developed a novel method to directly parameterize the incidence of infection, by convoluting the incidence of infection with the incubation period, allowing us to precisely incorporate the timing of interventions and observe their effect on virus transmission dynamics on a given day. The proposed method suitable for application (i) when the generation structure is imaginable from a published estimate of the mean generation time or visually identifiable from the observed epidemic curve, (ii) when the time of infection needs to be modeled in relation to the timing of interventions, and (iii) when the observed data include doubly intervalcensored data.

This notion is supported by our model comparisons in which both \u03b5 1 and \u03b5 2 were required to act as free parameters, to better describe the observed epidemic dynamics. Of these interventions, mosquito control and raising public awareness were not sufficiently effective to break the chain of transmission, as they maintained R t >1, although the reproduction number exhibited a decreasing trend due to decrease in the observed incidence. Although mosquito control from 28 August 2014 was very intensive, DENV-positive Aedes were detected after these measures had been implemented [34] . To fully halt virus transmission, the combined effect of mosquito control, public awareness campaigns, and park closure was needed for a substantial reduction in R t ; this joint reduction effect was estimated to be 44%-88%. Therefore, according to our model results, we can conclude that control of the dengue outbreak at local level in Tokyo was essential to describe the empirically observed data and successful in reducing transmissions. It should be noted that the park closure effect includes not only the prevention of exposure among susceptible visitors but also removal of infectious hosts, including local residents of the park, from the focal area of transmission.",

Our estimate was consistent with an empirical estimate by Siraj et al.

However, the model with two generations alone indicated that the outbreak came to an end with the latest estimate of a generation-dependent reproduction number (of generation 1) as large as 9.3; if this model result were true, the reproduction number of the subsequent generation (generation 2) had to abruptly drop to 0. As mentioned in the Results, regardless of the assumed number of generations, the latest estimate of R i was below the value of 1 because the epidemic came to an end in October 2014. However, using the model with two generations, this had to happen quite abruptly, with a drop from 9.3 to 0. Using the model with four generations, the mean generation time had to be 12 days, allowing only about 6 to 7 days from illness onset in an infected person to EIP in a mosquito to biting a susceptible person. Thus, there was some interplay between the assumed number of generations and the resulting estimates, i.e., as the number of generations increased, the generation time was estimated to be shorter. As long as we cannot specify the exact number of generations, the only approach to address relevant uncertainty is to use multiple models with different numbers of generations, to verify that our practical conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions would not change drastically by varying the number of generations.",

            "text": "The present study was not free from limitations. First, this study rested on confirmed dengue cases in patients with symptomatic illness who undertook testing. Febrile patients who had visited Yoyogi Park were advised to seek medical attention during the outbreak; however, a substantial number of asymptomatic infections would have been missed [49] , and the present evaluation was made based only on diagnosed cases. Thus far, we have failed to explicitly estimate the ascertainment rate or number of asymptomatic infections using the observed empirical data. Second, Yoyogi Park was undoubtedly the focal area of transmission, but later transmission occurred in other parks in the Kanto region. In addition to spatial heterogeneity, the exposure behaviors in those parks were not rigorously traced, leading to substantial uncertainty in the empirical data (i.e., many cases belonging to Group 3 in our likelihood), thus making later epidemic data difficult to be captured by our simple model. Third, qualitatively, local residents of Yoyogi Park were suspected of being amplifiers of transmission. However, it was not possible to trace the behavior of these infected individuals, e.g., when they left Yoyogi Park and where they went after leaving the park, including whether they moved to another park as a next destination, thus being responsible for causing subsequent cases. It must be remembered that our high estimate of the reproduction number in the early stage of the epidemic could have reflected the existence of superspreaders. Fourth, we ignored environmental and ecological factors in our model [50] [51] [52] . The temperature mostly remained stable during the course of the 2014 outbreak; thus, the EIP can be assumed to be approximately stable. However, we ignored rainfall, which could have altered the population dynamics of Aedes species. Fifth, we examined only a limited number of assumed generations; theoretically, there could be six, seven, or an even greater number of generations explaining the observed epidemiological dynamics. However, considering the published EIP, it was implausible that there were six or more generations during the course of the 2014 outbreak.",

We successfully captured that impact using convolution of the incidence and the incubation period. By combining mosquito control, public awareness campaigns, and park closure, dengue control during the 2014 outbreak in Tokyo was highly successful. Should a similar event happen in the future, concerted efforts including similarly combined interventions, accompanied by identification of the location of exposure, should be implemented.",

Left vertical axis shows the observed number of cases (i.e., incidence as a function of the date of illness onset), and the right vertical axis shows the effective reproduction number, illustrated using a black solid line. Two red vertical dashed lines indicate times at which interventions started. The earlier one (from 28 August) included mosquito control and dissemination of outbreak information via mass media. The later vertical line indicates the date on which Yoyogi Park was closed. Black dot-dashed horizontal line indicates the threshold value 1 for the effective reproduction number, below which the outbreak will eventually be controlled. The effective reproduction number was estimated, assuming three different numbers of generations of infection, i.e., (A) two, (B) three, and (C) four generations excluding generation zero. Owing to the uncertainty of estimation during the very early stage of the epidemic, the effective reproduction number was plotted from 17 August. The shaded cyan area represents the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the effective reproduction number, calculated using 100 bootstrap samples.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007468.g004",
