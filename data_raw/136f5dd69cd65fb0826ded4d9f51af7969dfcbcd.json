A partial genomic sequence of a murine coronavirus was identified, and the whole genome (31428 bp) of the coronavirus was subsequently sequenced using PCR cloning techniques. Nucleotide sequence comparisons revealed that the genome sequence of the new virus was 91-93 % identical to those of known murine hepatitis viruses (MHVs). The predicted open reading frame from the nucleotide sequence encoded all known proteins of MHVs. Analysis at the protein level showed that the virus was closely related to the highly virulent MHV-JHM strain. The virus strain was named MHV-MI. No type D retroviruses were found. Degenerate PCR targeting of type D retrovirus and 5 0 -RACE targeting of other types of retroviruses confirmed the absence of any retroviral association with the LCH xenografted SCID mice.",

            "text": "Subtraction hybridization enables researchers to compare two populations of mRNA and to obtain clones of genes that are only expressed in one population. The basic principle behind the method is simple: both mRNA populations are converted to cDNA and then hybridized to each other; the hybridized sequences are then removed and the remaining unhybridized cDNAs represent genes that are only expressed in one population. Several different methods of subtraction hybridization have been successfully applied [1] [2] [3] [4] but each had limitations in identifying rare transcripts. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) [5] overcomes this by using an additional suppression PCR step that provides 10-100 fold enrichment of differentially expressed mRNAs, irrespective of their relative abundance. SSH has been successfully used to compare differences in gene expression between two transcriptomes [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] but, to our knowledge, the use of SSH for identification of an unknown virus has not been previously reported.",

The disease is characterized by the accumulation of clonally derived Langerhans cells [11, 12] and inflammatory cells including T cells, macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, giant cells, and plasma cells [13, 14] . The clinical representation of LCH can involve bone, skin, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and/or bone marrow [15] . To overcome issues relating to the availability of LCH tissue, the establishment of a mouse model of LCH was attempted by xenografting human LCH tissue into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice [16] . Following engraftment, several mice developed pre-T cell lymphomas, from which a cell line was developed, called ThyE1M6. Electron microscopy of this cell line appeared to show a budding retrovirus with an appearance similar to that of type-D-like retroviral particles [16] . When ThyE1M6 cells were injected into SCID mice, a lethal syndrome developed within 2 weeks in which mice developed generalized granulomas involving inflammatory cells in multiple organs. A virus was suspected, but antiserum detection tests for known viruses were not possible, as SCID mice do not have B cells and therefore cannot make antibodies. Histopathological studies revealed that the liver was the most-affected organ. Attempts to isolate virus from liver were unsuccessful, and molecular techniques were used in this study to identify the putative virus.",

PCR products were verified by sequencing to be derived from MusD1 or MusD2 retroviral sequences of mouse genomic DNA. After the second phase of optimization, 2 mM MgCl 2 was found to be optimal for both primer pairs, but an annealing temperature of 55\u00b0C was found to be optimum for the gag-PP2-FWD/REV primer pair, and 45\u00b0C for the pro-PP2-FWD/REV primer pair. Under the optimum conditions, both primer pairs produced sharp PCR bands (Fig. 1 ). In the experimental degenerate PCR, no PCR products were amplified, even after 70 cycles. RT-PCR internal control with mouse bactin primers produced the expected products (154 bp) from both infected and uninfected mouse liver cDNAs. These results clearly indicated that no type D retrovirus was present in the infected or uninfected mouse liver.",

We started with three pairs of infected and uninfected mouse liver RNA samples, and one pair of positive control human placental RNA sample (HaeIII treated and untreated). After quality testing in each step of cDNA synthesis, Rsa I digestion, and adaptor ligation, only one pair of 'tester cDNA' and 'driver cDNA' was selected for final subtraction analysis, based on quality assessment. The 'tester cDNA' was derived from the RNA of infected mouse (E4M31) liver, and the driver cDNA was derived from RNA of uninfected mouse (E5M32) liver. Since identification of a viral gene signature from the infected mouse liver was the goal, only the forward subtraction method was used, and the library was constructed from the forward-subtracted cDNAs only. Other gene sequences resulting from forward subtraction analysis (Table 2) were not analyzed for the same reason.",

Enterotropic strains, such as MHV-D, MHV-Y, MHV-RI, LIVIM, and DVIM, generally produce infections confined to the GI tract [36] , whereas polytropic strains, such as MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, MHV-4 (or JHM), MHV-A59 and MHV-S, initiate infection mainly in the respiratory tract, which can disseminate to the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and brain [35] [36] [37] . Polytropic strains are usually more virulent than enterotropic strains [38] . Although BLAST analysis of protein sequences showed a higher percentage of homology with MHV-3 proteins, comparative analysis of ORFs (Table 4 ) revealed that MHV-MI was more closely related to polytropic MHV-JHM virus or its variants. MHV-MI also contained the HE protein, which forms smaller spikes on virions [27] and enhances virulence when paired with spike protein (S) [39] . The HE protein is absent in the MHV-3 strain, and MHV-MI could therefore be predicted to be a polytropic virulent virus and a very close relative of MHV-JHM.",
