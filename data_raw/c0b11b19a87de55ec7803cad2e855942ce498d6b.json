In our previous study, a genetically engineered Lactobacillus casei oral vaccine (pPG-COE-DCpep/L393) expressing a dendritic cell (DC)-targeting peptide fused with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) COE antigen was developed. This vaccine induced significant levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG and IgA antibody responses in mice, indicating a potential strategy against PEDV infection. In this study, pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 was used for oral vaccination of newborn piglets against PEDV. We then assessed the immune responses and protection efficacy of pPG-COE-DCpep/L393. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine elicits a specific systemic and mucosal immune response. The T-helper cells mediated by pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 and PEDV infection display a Th1 phenotype. The histopathological results showed that pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 promotes lymphocyte proliferation and effectively protects piglets against PEDV infection. The transforming growth factor-\u03b2 level indicated that the recombinant Lactobacillus vaccine plays a role in anti-inflammatory responses in mesenteric lymph nodes during PEDV infection. These results show that pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 is a potential vaccine against PEDV infection. the CO-26K equivalent, COE), was expressed in transgenic tobacco, and used for immunizing mice, thereby inducing an effective neutralizing antibody response [3] . We therefore hypothesized that a recombinant vaccine using the COE gene would be effective against PEDV infection.",

Most of the maternal antibodies in the milk were digested by gastric acid and pepsin before entering the intestinal tract [4] . Additionally, they did not induce sufficient production of virus-specific IgA antibodies, resulting in inadequate mucosal immunity [5] . Vaccines must effectively provide mucosal protection in the intestinal tract. Mucosal immunity against viral entry into the intestinal epithelial cells was more effective than systemic immunity [6] . Anti-PEDV immunization with an oral vaccine in pregnant swine was better than injected immunization in reducing piglet mortality, and IgA was more important than IgG for protection in the colostrum [7] . Research has suggested that the first line of defense by IgA in the intestine would be more effective than that by IgG for protecting piglets against PEDV infection. Furthermore, dendritic cells (DCs), professional antigen-presenting cells, link humoral and cellular immune responses for homeostasis of the intestinal immune environment, and studies have focused on DC targeting for enhancing antibody titer. DCs can be found in all the lymphoid organs associated with the intestine, such as Peyer's patches (PPs), isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs), and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), as well as scattered throughout the subepithelial lamina propria (LP) of both the small intestine and colon [8] [9] [10] .",

Lactobacillus could help to induce stronger non-specific mucosal immune responses. The non-specific mucosal immunity can enhance the permeability of intestine to aid the removal of PEDV by macrophages and DCs in the intestine [20] .

Th1 cells are crucial for host defense against intracellular pathogens of cellular immunity, whereas Th2 cells are known to be important for the elimination of helminthic parasites with humoral immunity. The Th1/Th2 paradigm is useful for classifying the immune responses that occur in the elimination of microbial pathogens, such as cellular immunity and humoral immunity [24, 25] . We analyzed T-helper cell immune responses using peripheral blood T lymphocytes, before and after infection. The DNA plasmids vaccine of PEDV increased the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subgroups, and increased IFN-\u03b3 production in mice [26] . Our previous research showed that recombinant Lactobacillus was effective against TGEV infection, via the Th2 immune response. However, there are a number of studies that show that IFN-\u03b3 inhibits PEDV infection, and that a close relationship exists between DCs and IFN-\u03b3 during PEDV infection [27, 28] . We found that the recombinant Lactobacillus could weaken the PEDV infection in the form of IgA and IgG, which were up-regulated by the DC-targeting peptide as a molecular adjuvant.",

Our research first assessed cytokine profiles in piglets that were orally immunized with pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 after challenging with PEDV. We evaluated the expression of TLR-4, TLR-9, TNF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b2. We tested cytokine expression in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. TLRs are the pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system, and recognize pathogens through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [31] . TLRs recognize the pathogen-derived molecules at the earliest phase in the promotion of the immune response [32] . Our results showed that the expression of TLR-4 and TLR-9 in the mesenteric lymph nodes of the pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 group, was much higher than that in the PBS and pPG/L39 groups. TLR-4 was activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), while TLR-9 recognizes unmethylated CpG motifs in bacterial DNA [33] . These studies have shown that TLR-9 is induced by CD4+ T cells, which are prolonged by the T cell [34, 35] . Carvalho et al. reported that a higher expression of TLR-9 resulted in increased B cell proliferation, in response to CpG DNA [36] . The proliferation of T cells and B cells enhanced the IgA and IgG titers. All of these findings provide evidence that pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 can function as a bacterial carrier for antigen delivery, enhancing TLR expression and increasing antibody secretion in local immunity.",

TNF-\u03b1 links cell proliferation and survival, with different modalities of cell death, which are intricately linked to the epithelial response to injury [37] . TNF-\u03b1 expression in the splenic lymphocytes and mesenteric lymph nodes of the pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 group was significantly lower than that in the pPG/L393 and PBS groups. TGF-\u03b2 is a ubiquitous modulator of cellular responses, which also regulates numerous responses in monocytes, such as activation, host defense, and chemotaxis [38] . During infection, higher levels of TGF-\u03b2 may inhibit potential injuries resulting from increased inflammatory responses at sites of infection [39] . In our study, TGF-\u03b2 levels in the pPG-COE-DCpep/L393 and pPG/L393 groups were significantly higher in mesenteric lymph nodes than in the PBS group, and there was no significant difference in their levels in splenic lymphocytes. Anti-inflammatory effects would therefore result in marked protection of intestinal epithelial cells against PEDV infection.
