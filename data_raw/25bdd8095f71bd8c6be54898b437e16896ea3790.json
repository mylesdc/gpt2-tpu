Serum samples from patients diagnosed with falciparum malaria (FM) (n = 20), vivax malaria (VM) (n = 17) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 20) were investigated using multiple proteomic techniques and results were validated by employing immunoassay-based approaches. Specificity of the identified malaria related serum markers was evaluated by means of analysis of leptospirosis as a febrile control (FC). Compared to HC, 30 and 31 differentially expressed and statistically significant (p,0.05) serum proteins were identified in FM and VM respectively, and almost half (46.2%) of these proteins were commonly modulated due to both of the plasmodial infections. 13 proteins were found to be differentially expressed in FM compared to VM. Functional pathway analysis involving the identified proteins revealed the modulation of different vital physiological pathways, including acute phase response signaling, chemokine and cytokine signaling, complement cascades and blood coagulation in malaria. A panel of identified proteins consists of six candidates; serum amyloid A, hemopexin, apolipoprotein E, haptoglobin, retinol-binding protein and apolipoprotein A-I was used to build statistical sample class prediction models. By employing PLS-DA and other classification methods the clinical phenotypic classes (FM, VM, FC and HC) were predicted with over 95% prediction accuracy. Individual performance of three classifier proteins; haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A-I and retinol-binding protein in diagnosis of malaria was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The discrimination of FM, VM, FC and HC groups on the basis of differentially expressed serum proteins demonstrates the potential of this analytical approach for the detection of malaria as well as other human diseases.",

            "text": "The burden of malaria continues to worsen globally with a devastating impact on human health and corresponding impediment to economic improvement [1] . Despite worldwide initiatives, emerging drug resistance in different species of Plasmodium and paucity of information about the exact underlying mechanism of the disease pathogenesis are creating challenges for the management and eradication of the disease. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection represents the major cause of malaria associated morbidity and mortality worldwide. Falciparum malaria (FM) accounts for approximately 247 million cases and one million deaths annually, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa [2] , while outside the African continents, Plasmodium vivax (Pv) is responsible for more than 50% of all malaria cases [3] . In order to survive within the host cells and ensure their reproduction, intracellular parasites like Plasmodium develop versatile mechanisms to exploit their host cells and induce new permeability pathways to permit the uptake of nutrients and the removal of waste products, resulting into activation of multiple host immune cascades and inflammatory responses [4] . Plasmodium infection also affects blood coagulation by diverse pathobiological mechanisms, which results into development of fatal hemorrhagic complication [5, 6] . Investigation of the parasite induced alterations in host proteome and modulation of different vital physiological processes have great clinical relevance in the light of diagnosis and prognosis. Recently, proteomic studies have contributed substantially to our understanding of the clinical proteome of human malaria parasites [7] , profiling humoral immune responses to Plasmodium infection [8] and the malaria parasite infection-induced changes in host erythrocyte membrane proteins [9] . The findings obtained from such studies have provided better understanding of the disease pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions and host immune response.",

In recent years, a number of proteomic studies have been carried out to investigate the pathogen induced alterations in human serum/plasma proteome in different infectious diseases including dengue [11] , SARS [12] , leishmaniasis [13] , and leptospirosis [14] . In this study we have investigated the alterations in human serum proteome due to the P. falciparum infection for obtaining mechanistic insight about the disease pathogenesis and host immune response in the most virulent form of human malaria. Additionally, serum proteome changes in FM were compared with vivax malaria (VM); another widely distributed human malaria to study the similarities and differences in host responses against these two major plasmodial infections. To achieve this comparative analysis we have utilized selected dataset of our previous serum proteomics study on VM [15] , while additional proteomics and immune-assay-based experiments were performed using a bigger (compared to our previous report) clinical cohort of VM patients. The comparative study on FM and VM revealed that quite a few serum proteins associated with diverse essential physiological pathways, including acute phase response signaling, cytokine and chemokine signaling, complement cascades and blood coagulation are commonly altered in both of the plasmodial infections, while some uniquely modulated candidates such as calcium binding protein 39, calpain 10, regulator of G-protein signaling 7, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase, transthyretin in FM and ceruloplasmin, vitamin D-binding protein, serum amyloid P, alpha-2-macroglobulin, fibrinogen beta chain precursor in VM, were also identified. Recently, we performed serum proteomic alterations in another clinically relevant infectious disease, leptospirosis [14] . To evaluate the specificity of the identified protein targets and eliminate the generic febrile responses; expression level of the serum proteins differentially expressed in plasmodial infections (compared to the healthy subjects) was analyzed in leptospirosis patients from our previous study [14] . Another major intention of this present study was identification of the characteristics marker proteins, which can readily discriminate malaria patients (FM from VM as well) from healthy population as well as closely related infectious diseases with high accuracy. The potential serum protein biomarkers identified in our study were used to build statistical models, which successfully classified and predicted the clinical phenotypes of controls (healthy and febrile), FM and VM in a blinded study.",

In gel-based proteomic analysis samples were studied individually (n = 63 for classical 2DE and n = 30 for 2D-DIGE) rather than sample pooling to achieve better insights about biological variability from individual samples. In proteomic analysis two major high-abundance serum proteins; albumin and IgG were removed using Albumin & IgG Depletion SpinTrap (GE Healthcare) to reduce the dynamic range of the serum proteome. Depletion of these top two highabundance proteins removes more than 60% of the total protein content in human plasma or serum allowing detection of more proteins by increasing the effective concentration of the lowabundance proteins. Depletion of albumin and IgG effectively increased the overall spot number in 2D gels ( Figure S1A ). The efficiency of albumin and IgG depletion from human serum was evaluated by densitometric analysis of SDS-PAGE gels containing resolved serum proteins before and after depletion ( Figure S1B ). The densitometric analysis revealed around 85% and 80% depletion of albumin and IgG, respectively ( Figure S1C ). Serum proteome analysis of FM patients and healthy controls by 2DE identified 22 statistically significant (p,0.05) differentially expressed (with changes from 24.28 to +78.73-fold) protein spots (Table S1 .1). After staining with GelCode Blue Safe Protein Stain, over 700 protein spots were detected reproducibly in each gel by IMP7 software. Representative 2DE images of serum proteome profile of FM subjects and healthy individuals, and bar-diagrammatic representation of the fold change and 3D views of few selected spots are illustrated in Figure 1A and B. In MS analysis 12 different proteins were identified from the 22 differentially expressed protein spots, since in few cases MS analysis revealed similar identity for multiple protein spots appearing as different entities in 2D gels. The similar identity of multiple spots indicates the possibility of presence of various isoforms of those particular proteins probably due to the complex combinations of posttranslational modifications. Among the 12 identified proteins; 7 proteins were up-regulated (serum amyloid A, hemopexin precursor, apolipoprotein E, a-1-antitrypsin precursor, leucinerich a-2-glycoprotein, a-1-BN glycoprotein and a-1-antichymotrypsin precursor) and 5 proteins were down-regulated (haptoglobin, ficolin 3 precursor, apolipoprotein A-I, clusterin precursor and serum albumin) ( Figure S2 ; Table 2 and S2.1). Interestingly, serum amyloid A (spot U13 and U14) was found to be highly over expressed (.25-fold) in all the FM patients.",

We obtained reliable MS IDs for 63 protein spots out of 121 (Table S2. 2); while remaining 58 spots remained unidentified and produced virtually empty spectra, most likely owing to the presence of extremely diminutive quantity of proteins as indicated by the retrospective scrutiny of the spot volumes. The 63 protein spots identified by MS represented 30 (14 up-regulated and 16 down-regulated) differentially expressed proteins in FM patients ( Table 2 ; Figure 1C and S3). Proteins identified in 2DE experiment were also obtained in 2D-DIGE; additionally, new candidates were also identified by 2D-DIGE due to the higher sensitivity and reproducibility. 3D views and graphical representation of selected protein spots are shown in Figure 1D .",

Compared to healthy controls, quite a few serum proteins such as calcium binding protein 39, calpain 10, regulator of G-protein signaling 7, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase and transthyretin precursor were found to be differentially expressed in FM but not VM. In contrary, some proteins like ceruloplasmin, vitamin D-binding protein, serum amyloid P, alpha-2-macroglobulin, fibrinogen beta chain precursor exhibited altered expressions only in VM patients (Table S3 ). Among the 19 proteins, which were differentially expressed (compared to HC) in both of the malaria, only alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein and serotransferrin precursor (transferrin) exhibited opposite trends in Pf and Pv infections. Rest of the 17 proteins exhibited similar trend of differential expression in FM and VM; although, fold-change values were different ( Figure 2D ).",

Compared to the healthy controls, both FM and VM patients found to have lower serum level of haptoglobin and Apo A-I (p,0.0001 in a Mann-Whitney test) ( Figure 3A and B). The mean haptoglobin concentration was found to be 0.20860.048 and 0.33360.06 g/L in FM and VM patients respectively, while the healthy and leptospirosis (FC) populations exhibited a mean values of 0.91860.1 g/L and 0.88860.056 g/L (mean 6 SE). Likewise, Apo A-I exhibited more than three times lower mean value in both the malaria patients compared to the healthy subjects (39.3965.43, 43.1964 .96 and 137.0565.33 mg/dL in FM, VM and HC respectively). While the febrile controls shown a mean value of 76.5264.12 mg/dL, which is around 2-fold higher than the malaria patients. Serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) concentration was measured by sandwich ELISA. The serum levels of RBP was found to be significantly (p,0.01) lower in malaria patients ( Figure 3C ). Western blot analyses of four differentially expressed targets proteins; haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, clusterin and retinol-binding protein were performed on a subset of control [HC (n = 12) and FC (n = 6)] and diseased samples [FM and VM (n = 12 each)] ( Figure 3D ). CBB staining of the SDS-PAGE gels and Ponceau staining of the transferred blots containing the resolved proteins indicated equal loading of the samples in each lane ( Figure S5 ). Western blot analysis showed up-regulation of serum amyloid A and downregulation of haptoglobin, clusterin and retinol-binding protein in FM and VM patients (p,0.01) compared to the healthy and febrile controls.

The most significant related functions derived from these overlapping networks included, lipid metabolism (14 proteins, p = 2.92E 209 -5.48E 203 ), inflammatory response (18 proteins, p = 1.07E 211 -5.48E 203 ), molecular transport (15 proteins, p = 2.92E 209 -5.48E 203 ), immune cell trafficking (10 proteins, p = 9.32E 208 -4.12E 203 ) and humoral immune response (7 proteins, p = 1.10E 205 -5.48E 203 ). According to this functional pathway analysis, Pf infection leads to the alteration of multiple serum proteins involved in diverse essential physiological pathways, including acute phase response (Ratio = 0.067, p = 1.11E 218 ) and primary immunodeficiency signaling (ratio = 0.048, p = 5.1E 205 ) (Table S5. 2). Functional analysis of differentially expressed proteins was also performed using Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) databases. In PANTHER analysis blood coagulation system (p = 4.88E 205 ) was again identified. Moreover, the heterotrimeric G-protein signaling, interleukin signaling pathway and inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways were identified as related physiological pathways with statistical significance (p,0.05) (Table S5. 3).

As shown in Figure S9A , the two groups (FM and HC) could be clearly classified by phenotype, thereby providing an additional, unbiased estimate of class prediction. Secondly, we applied the class prediction model based on initial cohort (n = 10) to independently predict (assign) the phenotypic class to either FM or HC group on an independent blind group of 16 subjects (8 newly recruited FM patients and 8 HC). The model provided accurate phenotypic classification; and 100% of the FM (n = 19) and 94.74% of the HC (n = 19) subjects were accurately classified into correct phenotypes (Table  S8 .1C).

As a result, to circumvent the situation, enhanced plasma levels of antioxidant defense associated enzymes/proteins such as superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) are observed in acute malaria patients [25] . In both FM and VM patients we have identified elevated serum level of hemopexin, a heme-binding protein, which provides the second line of defense against hemoglobin-mediated oxidative damage during intravascular hemolysis [26] . Increased production of this acute phase protein by the host defense system could be helpful to circumvent the pro-inflammatory response with oxidative stress generated in patients with Pf or Pv infection. In contrast, haptoglobin (Hp) found to be significantly downregulated in FM and VM patients. Hp removes free hemoglobin (Hb) released during parasite induced hemolysis, and disappears as the Hp-Hb complexes leading to the malaria associated hypo-or ahaptoglobinemia and is a promising inflammatory marker to evaluate the severity of the Plasmodium infection [21] . Earlier reports have demonstrated the possible role of this APP as an epidemiological marker for malaria [21, 27] .",

Signaling via the erythrocyte beta 2-adrenergic receptor and heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Gas) regulates the entry of the human malaria parasite P. falciparum. Disruption of the interaction between the G-alpha-s subunit of the Gs protein and the receptor results in a reduced erythrocyte invasion by the parasite and subsequent low level of parasitemia [28] . Down-regulation in regulator of G-protein signaling in FM patients might be due to some host response to combat this parasitic infection. Conversely, up-regulation of apolipoprotein E was observed in the malaria patients. This apolipoprotein also inhibits Plasmodium invasion, since it shares the cell entry mediators (heparan sulphate proteoglycans and/or low density lipoprotein receptor) with the parasite [29] . The pathway analyses and densely connected networks based on our results provide an insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of malaria.",

            "text": "Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for the effective treatment and management of malaria. In recent years, multivariate projection methods are being successfully applied to analyze biological data obtained through genomic, transcriptomic or proteomic approaches to study various human diseases, with implications for diagnostics and clinical management [30, 31] . A sub-set of the proteins identified in our proteomic analysis was used to build statistical sample class prediction models to identify the classifier marker proteins for FM, VM and HC discrimination. Interestingly, two key classifier proteins: serum amyloid A and haptoglobin differentially expressed consistently in all of the malaria patients (FM and VM) compared to the control subjects (HC and FC) and remained statistically significant after FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg) and Bonferroni correction of the p-values obtained in t-test; indicating very strong correlation between the expression levels of these two serum proteins and plasmodial infections. The recognition ability of the prediction models for FM, VM and HC discrimination and cross-validation was almost 100% (Table S8) . We controlled for the statistical false discovery rate using three distinct, iterative validation steps: (i) k-fold crossvalidation algorithm for the original cohort, (ii) application of the marker subset identified in the original cohort to classify newly recruited patients, and (iii) performance of the marker subset validated using three well-known machine learning methods. In our study, biological replicates were investigated, i.e. each proteome profile was representative of a different human subject, and hence the data-sets are characterized by low homogeneity, conferring to the protocol a very high level of variability and complexity. Indeed the extreme heterogeneity or large biological variations including gender, age, genetic factors, dietary considerations, environmental factors and drug treatment affects the detection, validation and establishment of ''gold standard'' serological biomarkers [10, 32] . Nonetheless, the accurate discrimination among the FM, VM and control groups obtained by various prediction models on the basis of differentially expressed candidate proteins testifies to the excellent potential of this analytical approach for the detection and discrimination of VM and FM ( Figure 5 ; Figure S9 ). It should also be noted that uncomplicated FM and VM patients with diverse range of parasitemia; mainly low and moderate parasitemic (,5000 parasites/mL blood), were used for the validation of the prediction models (Table 1) . Even so, the discrimination accuracy of the study is very appreciable indicating the capability of our analytical approach for the detection of very low-level of parasitemia, which is highly promising from a diagnostic point of view. Although, diagnosis of malaria on the basis of microscopic examination of thin or thick smears of peripheral blood is the most commonly used and well-accepted method, but it requires highly trained personnel for smear interpretation, frequently fails to distinguish mixed-species infections or diagnose patients with ''sub-microscopic'' parasitemia below the detectable limit of blood smears, and in many areas of endemicity the operating characteristics of microscopy are poor [33, 34] . In quest of an early and accurate diagnosis of malaria and discrimination of Pf, Pv or mixed infection, establishment of serum protein markers can be an attractive approach apart from clinical symptoms and conventional microscopic examination of blood smears. To this end, some of the classifier candidate proteins identified in this study; such as serum amyloid A, paraoxonase, apolipoprotein A-I and E, haptoglobin, hemopexin, and complement C4 are very important due to their functional relevance in malaria pathogenesis and could further be investigated as potential surrogate protein markers for clinical implications. Various rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are in practice for malaria diagnosis, which diagnose the infection on the basis of detection of parasite proteins/antigens e.g. histidine-rich protein II (HRP-II) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [35] , whereas for the first time we have demonstrated the discrimination between FM and VM patients based on protein expression in human host. Malaria RDTs are used regularly in clinics due to the low cost, sensitivity and less detection time. However, analysis of frozen specimens of blood from parasitaemic patients using existing RDTs is bit challenging. Another limiting factor is the shelf-life of RDTs, since most of the existing RDTs deteriorate rapidly on exposure to moisture (humidity) and high temperature. Moreover, significant variations may appear between technicians in both RDT preparation and result interpretation process depending on experience of the performer, manual proficiency and visual perception [36] . To this end, serum protein markers can be potential candidates for development of an alternative sensitive diagnostic approach for malaria. Development of highly sensitive biosensors for the identified surrogate proteins might be attractive from a diagnostic point of view.",

We anticipate that information obtained from this study will provide valuable insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of malaria and may help to establish early detection surrogates for these infectious parasitic diseases to meet the need for better diagnostics and effective therapy. Some of our identified classifier proteins such as serum amyloid A, apolipoprotein A-I and E and haptoglobin, which successfully discriminated FM from VM might be prognostic host markers for disease severity. To this end, it would be interesting to elucidate the fate of the identified serum proteins in severe malaria patients and could be a future continuation of this study.

After sonication, the top two highabundance serum proteins (albumin and IgG) were removed using Albumin & IgG Depletion SpinTrap (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions. Extraction of protein from depleted serum samples was performed employing TCA/acetone precipitation method as described by Chen et al., with slight modifications [37] . In brief, depleted serum samples were diluted (1:4 ratio) with ice-cold acetone containing 10% (w/v) TCA. Uniform mixing was performed using mild vortexing for 15 sec and the mixture was allowed to incubate at 220uC for 2 hrs for protein precipitation. After completion of the incubation period, tubes were centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min at 4uC. Supernatants were separated and kept in fresh microcentrifuge tubes, and the pellets were dissolved in rehydration buffer [8 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 2% (v/v) IPG buffer (pH 4-7; Linear), 40 mM DTT and traces of bromophenol blue]. In order to precipitate the remaining amount of proteins present in the collected 10% TCA/acetone-containing supernatants, 1 mL icecold acetone was added to each tube and the samples were subjected one additional round of precipitation and extraction process. In all cases, prior to re-suspension in rehydration buffer, the pellet was briefly air-dried. Prior to proteomic analyses, protein concentration in the samples was quantified using the 2D-Quant kit (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 600 mg of depleted serum protein extract dissolved in 350 mL of rehydration buffer was loaded on 4-7 pH range IPG strips (18 cm) and underwent passive rehydration for 14-16 hrs. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed on an Ettan IPGphore 3 isoelectric focusing unit (GE Healthcare) for overall approximately 78 kVh using the following voltage settings: 200 V for 4 h (step and hold), 500 V for 1 h (step and hold), 1000 V for 1 h (step and hold), 8000 V for 3 h (gradient), and 8000 V for 7:30 h (step and hold). After completion of IEF, the focused IPG strips were stored at 220uC until the second dimensional analysis was performed. Preceding to the second dimensional separation, each strip was equilibrated to reduce and alkylate the proteins (for 15 min each) using equilibration buffer containing 6 M Urea, 75 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 29.3% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 0.002% (w/v) bromophenol blue. Just prior to use, 1% (w/v) DTT or 2.5% (w/v) IAA was added in the first (reducing) and second (alkylating) equilibration buffer, respectively. The second dimension was performed on 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gels using an Ettan DALTsix electrophoresis unit (GE Healthcare). After electrophoresis GelCode Blue Safe Protein Stain (Thermo Scientific, USA) was utilized for visualization of the protein spots.

Spot quantification was performed in % vol value using ImageMaster algorithm. It provided normalized value that remains relatively independent of variations due to staining or protein loading. The gel analysis tables, histograms and 3D images generated by the software were used for further analysis.",

After scanning, gel images were cropped properly using Im-ageQuant software; version 5.0 (GE Healthcare) prior to importing in DeCyder 2D software; version 7.0 (GE Healthcare) for comparative analysis and relative protein quantification across the FM and control samples. Comparative analysis was performed using two different modules, differential in-gel analysis (DIA) and biological variation analysis (BVA) of the DeCyder software. Preliminary analysis was performed using DIA module to detect spots on a cumulative image derived from merging up to three individual images from an in-gel linked image set (malaria, controls and internal standard). It permits the pair-wise comparisons of each normal and malaria samples to the mixed standard present in each gel and offers spot-wise protein abundance as ratios. Further analysis was performed using BVA module to get the variation in protein expression levels between any of the two experimental groups (FM vs. VM, FM vs. HC and VM vs HC) across all the sets. Statistical significance of the average ratio of expressions was analyzed by Student's t-test. Protein spots exhibiting differential expression with reproducibly and statistical significance (p,0.05) were considered for further analysis. Bonferroni correction (for reducing Type I errors) of the p-values obtained from Student's t-test was performed using standard Bonferroni procedure to recognize those marker proteins which have very strong connection with the diseased state (remains significant after Bonferroni correction). Since Bonferroni correction is extremely conservative; comparatively less stringent false discovery rate (FDR) correction was also performed as detailed in Benjamini and Hochberg [38] .",

GelCode Blue stained preparative gels containing much higher amount of protein (1 mg) were used for excision of the spots of interest specified in the 2D-DIGE experiment. Spot excision was performed manually. In-gel digestion of the proteins separated by 2D gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Shevchenko et al., with slight modifications [39] . In short, gel slices were cut into small cubes (,161 mm) and washed with 50 mL of stain removal solution (25 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer) for removal of CBB stain. After washing, 50 mL of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (1:1 v/v) was added, followed by 5 min incubation with occasional vortexing at room temperature. After incubation, the solutions were removed. These two steps are repeated for three times. Then, 50 mL reduction solution (10 mM DTT in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate) was added and the gel pieces were incubated for 60 mins at 56uC in an air thermostat. Tubes were allowed to cool to room temperature after incubation, and 50 mL of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer was added to wash the gel pieces followed by dehydration with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v). After this step, alkylation solution (50 mM IAA in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate) was added and the tubes containing the gel pieces were incubated for 30 mins at room temperature in dark. Rehydration and dehydration steps were performed twice and gel pieces were allowed to dry. Once the gel slices were properly dried, trypsin solution (Trypsin Gold; Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) was added to the gel pieces keeping the ratio of trypsin: protein around 1:10 (w/w) and incubated at ice for 30 mins for absorption of the solution. After this step, the tubes were incubated overnight at 37uC. Adequate amount of ammonium bicarbonate buffer was added to cover the gel pieces. Extraction of the digested peptides from the gel matrix was performed using 100 mL of extraction buffer (0.2% formic acid in 66% acetonitrile) after completion of the enzymatic reaction. Extraction step was repeated thrice to ensure maximum recovery of the digested peptides. The collected supernatants were pooled in a single tube and concentrated using speed vac.

After air drying, the crystallized spots were analysed using a 4800 MALDI-TOF/ TOF mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA) linked to 4000 series explorer software (version 3.5.3). All mass spectra were recorded in a reflector mode within a mass range from 800 to 4000 Da, using a Nd:YAG 355 nm laser. The acceleration voltage and extraction voltage were kept at 20 kV and 18 kV respectively. Six point calibration of the instrument was automatically performed by a peptide standard Kit (AB Sciex) that included des-Arg1-bradykinin (m/z 904.468), Angiotensin I (m/z 1296.685), Glu1-fibrinopeptide B (m/z 1570.677), ACTH (18-39, m/z 2465.199), ACTH (1-17, m/z 2903.087), and ACTH (7-38, m/z 3657.923).

MS/MS spectra were acquired for the 15 most abundant precursor ions, with a total accumulation of 1500 laser shots and collision energy of 1 kV. Once the MS survey scans were completed, the data were processed to generate a list of precursor ions for interrogation by MS/MS. The combined MS and MS/ MS peak lists were searched using the GPS TM Explorer software version 3.6 (AB Sciex). Protein identification was performed by MS/MS ion search using MASCOT version 2.1 (http://www. martixscience.com) search engine against the Swiss-Prot database. Searches were carried out with the following parameters; all entries taxonomy, trypsin digestion with one missed cleavage, fixed modifications: carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues, variable modifications: oxidation of methionine residues, mass tolerance 150 ppm for MS and 0.4 Da for MS/MS.

PLS method models both X and Y variables simultaneously to find the latent variables in X that will predict the latent variables in Y [44] . The application of PLS as a classification method is indicated as PLS-DA [45, 46] . SVM separates two classes by generating the hyperplane (in a highdimensional feature space) which maximizes the distance from the hyperplane to the closest training examples [47] . In Decision Trees a sample gets classified by following the appropriate path down the decision tree. The Naive Bayesian model is built based on the probability distribution function of the training data along each feature. Since Decision Trees and Na\u00efve Bayes directly handle multi-class problems, we have used the default parameters for these techniques. The SVMs are trained using sequential minimal optimization with a linear kernel.

(C) Densitometric analysis of the 1D-SDS-PAGE gels revealed around 85% and 80% depletion of albumin and IgG respectively. (PDF) Figure S2 Trends of differentially expressed proteins in falciparum malaria patients visualized in 2DE gels. (A) Representative 2D gels of serum from healthy controls and FM patients. 600 mg of total serum proteins were focused on linear pH 4-7 IPG strips (18 cm) and then separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, which were stained with Gel Code Blue Stain. Protein spots exhibiting significantly altered expression levels are marked on the gels. Down (B) and up (C) -regulation of protein expression levels in FM patients. The 3D images of statistically significant (p,0.05) differentially expressed spots were analyzed using IMP7 software. Data is represented as mean 6 SEM (where n = 20). (PDF) Figure S6 IPA defined interaction networks associated with the differentially expressed proteins in falciparum malaria. Differentially expressed serum proteins identified in FM patients were entered as focus molecules in the analytical software to generate biological processes, pathways and molecular networks associated with the identified proteins. (A) The top-scoring network (score 35); cell signaling, molecular transport, vitamin and mineral metabolism. This network incorporated 14 out of the 27 differentially expressed proteins (focus molecules), (B) The second net-work; lipid metabolism, molecular transport, small molecule biochemistry (score 23). This network incorporated 10 focus molecules. Green and red symbols represent proteins that were down and up-regulated in falciparum malaria, respectively (identified in this study). White symbols represent associated proteins identified in the functional analysis for which the difference in expression level did not achieve statistical significance in our study. (PDF) Figure S7 Gene Ontology (GO) terms for molecular functions, cellular components and biological processes associated with the differentially expressed serum proteins identified in falciparum malaria. A total of 1394 Gene Ontology (GO) terms were identified, of which the distribution of second level of GO terms that were enriched in two or more proteins is shown as molecular functions (A) and cellular components (B) and biological processes (C). (PDF) Figure S8 Biological process regulated by differentially expressed serum proteins identified in falciparum and vivax malaria patients. Regulations were based on Natural Language Processing performed on MEDLINE abstracts as available in GeneSpring software package (version 11.5, Agilent Technologies). Identified process (A) common in both the plasmodial infections (B) specific for P. falciparum (C) specific for P. vivax infection. Red triangles and blue squares represent positive and negative regulations, respectively. (PDF) Figure S9 Discrimination of falciparum and vivax malaria from healthy controls on the basis of differential expressions of selected serum proteins. PLS-DA scores plot for (A) FM (red spheres, n = 10) and HC (green spheres, n = 10) samples, based on 5 differentially expressed proteins (Table  S8 .1A) identified using 2DE, (B) FM (red spheres, n = 6), VM (blue spheres, n = 5) and HC (green spheres, n = 5) samples based on 7 differentially expressed proteins (Table S8.
