Since December 2010, a large-scale outbreak of diarrhea has been observed in swine farms in China. Accumulated evidence indicates that this large-scale outbreak of diarrhea were caused by highly virulent PEDV variants. Methods: A PEDV strain, YC2014, was isolated from intestinal samples of suckling piglets with acute diarrhea in 2014. The complete genomic sequence of YC2014 and the nucleotide sequence of S gene were aligned with sequences of published isolates using MEGA 5.1 software. The immune protective efficiency of YC2014 were determined by testing PEDV neutralizing antibodies in sera, the colostrum and the milk on 7th day after farrowing of the immunized sows. The diarrhea symptoms of piglets after challenge were also observed. Results: Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genomic sequence of YC2014 and the nucleotide sequence of S gene demonstrated that the YC2014 PEDV strain was clustered with the PEDV epidemic strains, with >99 % nucleotide identity to these PEDV strains. The S gene sequence of YC2014 shared only 93.9 %~94.4 % identities with classical CV777, DR13 and JS2008 strains, with 15 nucleotide insertion in three sites and three nucleotide deletion in one site. The amino acid (AA) sequence of S gene of YC2014 shared only 92.8 %~93.4 % identities with classical CV777, DR13 and JS2008 strains, with 5 AA insertion in two sites and 1 AA deletion in one site. In the immune protective efficiency tests, the neutralizing antibody titers in sera, the colostrum and the milk on 7th day after farrowing of the inactivated YC2014 PEDV strain immunized group were significantly higher than the inactivated CV777 immunized group and the inactivated DR13 immunized group (P < 0.05). The traditional inactivated PEDV vaccines made from CV777 or DR13 could not protect piglets from YC2014 challenge, while inactivated YC2014 could provide piglets with 100 % protection against YC2014 challenge.",

The variations in amino acid sequence likely changed the immunogenicity of the S protein and led to immunization failure of current commercial vaccines. In this study, we successfully isolated the YC2014 PEDV strain from porcine intestinal samples in dead piglets during outbreaks of acute diarrhea. The S gene nucleotides analysis of YC2014 indicated that it was clustered with the PEDV epidemic strains, with 15 nucleotide insertion in three sites and three nucleotide deletion in one site compared to classical PEDV vaccine strains CV777 and DR13. The variations of the S gene sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the YC2014 strain compared to traditional PEDV vaccine strains may be the reason why some swine farms had well PEDV vaccine immunizations but still had sustained epidemic diarrhea which caused huge economic losses.",

The RNA of the isolated YC2014 PEDV strain cultures were extracted using the Viral RNA Mini kit (Geneaid Biotech, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of PEDV in the Vero cell culture was confirmed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with one pairs of primers to amplify approximately 1 kb partial sequence of nucleocapsid protein, N1: GCAAACGGG TGCCATTATCTC, N2: CTAGCTCACGAACAGCCAC ATTAC. The samples of PEDV in the Vero cell culture were confirmed to be negative for rotavirus A, B and C, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), caliciviruses and porcine deltacoronavirus via RT-PCR as previously described [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The PEDV YC2014 strain was then identified with immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Briefly, Vero cells grown on a 6-well plate were infected with the PEDV YC2014 strain. At 48 h post-infection, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with cold methanol for 10 min at \u221220\u00b0C. Cells were then washed three times with PBST and blocked with 10 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Preparations were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with mouse anti-PEDV nucleocapsid protein polyclonal antibody in dilution buffer (1 % BSA in PBST), this mouse anti-PEDV nucleocapsid protein polyclonal antibody, prepared by our laboratory, was collected from serum of ICR mice immunized with purified prokaryotic expressed N protein. After three washes with PBST, cells were treated with a rhodamineconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cwbio, China) at a 1:5000 dilution with PBS for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After a final four washes with PBST, all wells were examined using fluorescence microscopy (Axio Observer Z1, Zeiss, Germany). After ten passages on Vero cells, the one-step growth curve of YC2014 strain in Vero cells was monitored at 8 h interval after infection.",

Twelve commercial high-health sows (Large White) were randomly divided into four groups (Table 3) After immunization, sera samples were collected from sows at 7-day intervals until 35 days after immunization (7 days after farrowing) for detection of nucleocapsid protein specific antibodies with commercial indirect ELISA kits (Biovet, Canada) and PEDV neutralizing antibodies using YC2014 as indicator virus as described previously [20] . Briefly, 50 \u03bcl of PEDV strain YC2014 (2.0 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 /ml) was added to an equal volume of the sera samples and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The mixture was then inoculated to a 96-well plate containing confluent Vero cells. 2 h later, the culture plate was washed with D-Hank's three times, and then added 100 \u03bcl of DMEM containing 2 % fetal bovine serum (FBS). 48 h later, the culture plate was fixed with cold methanol for 10 min at \u221220\u00b0C, and incubated with mouse anti-PEDV nucleocapsid protein polyclonal antibody for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, and then stained with FITC-labeled rabbit antimouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The serum titers were determined as the reciprocal of the last serum dilution at 70 % or greater fluorescent focus reduction in the infected cell cultures under a fluorescent microscope. The colostrum and the milk on 7th day after farrowing of each sow were also collected and used for the detection of PEDV neutralizing antibodies. The average number of sows farrowing was 13, piglets in each group was coded and chosen randomly, respectively. On 7th day after farrowing, thirty piglets were chosen (Table 4 ), ten from group one (inactivated CV777 immunized group), ten from group two (inactivated DR13 immunized group), five from group three (inactivated YC2014 immunized group), and five from group four (saline treated group). These piglets were divided into six groups (Table 4) , each group were housed in a separate room and were artificial feeding with milk. Piglets in group one to group four were challenged orally with 1.0 \u00d7 10 4 TCID 50 of YC2014. Group five were challenged orally with 1.0 \u00d7 10 4 TCID 50 of CV777.
