            "text": "Phylogenetic inference is an attractive means to reconstruct transmission histories and epidemics. However, there is not a perfect correspondence between transmission history and virus phylogeny. Both node height and topological differences may occur, depending on the interaction between within-host evolutionary dynamics and between-host transmission patterns. To investigate these interactions, we added a within-host evolutionary model in epidemiological simulations and examined if the resulting phylogeny could recover different types of contact networks. To further improve realism, we also introduced patient-specific differences in infectivity across disease stages, and on the epidemic level we considered incomplete sampling and the age of the epidemic. Second, we implemented an inference method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to discriminate among three well-studied network models and jointly estimate both network parameters and key epidemiological quantities such as the infection rate. Our ABC framework used both topological and distance-based tree statistics for comparison between simulated and observed trees. Overall, our simulations showed that a virus time-scaled phylogeny (genealogy) may be substantially different from the between-host transmission tree. This has important implications for the interpretation of what a phylogeny reveals about the underlying epidemic contact network. In particular, we found that while the within-host evolutionary process obscures the transmission tree, the diversification process and infectivity dynamics also add discriminatory power to differentiate between different types of contact networks. We also found that the possibility to differentiate contact networks depends on how far an epidemic has progressed, where distance-based tree statistics have more power early in an epidemic. Finally, we applied our ABC inference on two different outbreaks from the Swedish HIV-1 epidemic.",

However, collecting data to develop a good representation of the network is very challenging. The increasing availability of sequence data provide additional information: previous work has shown that it is possible to recover social network features from viral phylogenies. Until now, however, it was assumed that within-host evolution is negligible in the reconstruction. Here, we propose an approach based on approximate Bayesian computation to infer network structure from a virus phylogeny, explicitly including a model for within-host evolution. In addition, we incorporate other important heterogeneity factors such as individual-based transmission rates and infectivity varying by diseasestage. We show that in some situations the within-host virus diversity adds valuable signal to identify network structure, but in other situations it muddles the underlying contact structure.",

The structure of these networks is a major determinant of the pathogen transmission dynamics and possible control strategies [1] . For example, it has been suggested that human sexual contact networks are characterized by a power-law-like degree distribution [2] [3] [4] which, in a specific range of the scaling exponent, results in an infinite variance of the network's degree distribution. This implies the absence of an epidemic threshold, making prophylactic strategies for sexually transmitted diseases very challenging.",

Finally, we analyzed data from two different epidemiological scenarios of spread among injecting drug users (IDU) in the Swedish HIV-1 epidemic using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) for network model choice and parameter inference following the algorithm defined in [23] . We found that virus geneaologies can differ from the underlying transmission tree in both topology and branch length and, therefore, that meaningful inference of social networks needs to take within-host evolution into account.",

They reach their maximum value at caterpillars (ladder-like trees), and their minimum on the maximally balanced trees. A binary tree is considered to be perfectly balanced if each internal node in the tree divides the leaves descending from it into two equally sized groups. The expected number of cherries in a tree with n taxa under a Yule model is n/3. In an asymmetric tree (more ladder-like tree), tips tend to coalesce with branches deeper in the tree, and there are fewer cherries than expected. The number of cherries and Sackin's index complement each other well, as the number of cherries captures asymmetry in the recent evolutionary past, while Sackin's index captures asymmetry over the entire evolutionary history of the sample. These two measures are only weakly correlated [15] . A high ratio of internal branch to external branch length occurs in 'star-like' trees.

An example of the impact of the within-host evolutionary process in a small size network/epidemic is shown in Fig 2. This figure shows a transmission history (A), its transmission tree representation (B), and four compatible virus genealogies (C-F). The genealogies display branch elongation/compression as compared to the transmission tree but also changes in topology. For instance, lineage 5, sampled in individual 5 infected by 2 soon after 2's own infection, appears consistently on the top part of the simulated virus genealogies and its branch can only be elongated by a small amount (because the pretransmission interval is small). On the other hand, lineage 10, infected later by 2, is located in different parts of the possible genealogies, thus indicating changes in the virus genealogy topology versus the underlying transmission tree. This happens because longer time implies an increase in the virus diversity in 2, i.e. more lineages are available in the donor. Therefore, as many virus trees are possible under any transmission history, it is important to evaluate the additional variation within-host diversity inflicts on the epidemiological inference. An epidemic can spread faster on ER and BA networks, thus the resulting transmission tree from a WS network includes longer times resulting in taller trees (Fig 3A) . This is mainly because WS has higher clustering than ER or BA. Both the unobservable transmission tree and the observable virus genealogy show the same tree height information. Other tree statistics, however, show different patterns of network discrimination based on transmission tree or virus genealogy. The proportion of cherries per taxa is slightly less informative on virus genealogies than on transmission trees (Fig 3A) . In particular, while there is a decrease for ER and WS (less balanced in virus genealogies than transmission trees), it increases for BA (more balanced in virus genealogies than transmission trees). A similar pattern is seen using Sackin's Index or Colless' Index (ER and WS less balanced in virus genealogy, BA more balanced (Fig 3D and  3E) ). Overall, differences between BA and WS become more evident in virus genealogies. Because Sackin's Index and Colless' Index are highly correlated we will only report Sackin's Index from now on.",

            "text": "An epidemic spreading on an ER network is similar to a population random mixing model. Therefore, it is expected to generate a balanced transmission tree [13, 15] . The average number of people infected by an individual in the ER network show little variance and therefore the within host evolution model will add some heterogeneity producing small changes in the tree topology leading to an increase in the unbalancedness in the resulting virus genealogy. In BA models, instead, the presence of superspreaders generate transmission histories that are very unbalanced [13] . When a donor infects two or more recipients within a short interval, the order of transmissions along with infection times become impossible to accurately reconstruct; all splits are within the donor, describing within-host evolution in the donor (also shown in [21] ). Overall, the pretransmission interval associated with each and every transmission is a random draw from the possible coalescence times in the donor's viral population. Therefore, in BA networks the virus genealogy will show larger changes in the tree topology with respect to the underlying transmission trees and result in more balanced trees. The ratio of the mean internal to external branch lengths is informative about the type of network (smallest for BA, higher for ER, highest for WS). While the trends were similar in transmission trees and virus genealogies, the expected ranges overlapped for ER and WS in transmission trees, and virus genealogies showed generally smaller ratios (Fig 3C) . Branch lengths increase linearly as a function of tree height during epidemic spread on both ER and BA networks. Deviations from linearity are observed for epidemic spread on WS (S3 Fig). At the end of an epidemic, the mean branch length is constant among networks but longer in virus genealogies rather than in transmission trees (Fig 3F) . Overall, trees from ER and WS networks are more imbalanced based on virus genealogies. However, as an epidemic spreads much faster in a BA network, the resulting virus genealogy will instead become more balanced because the virus does not have time to evolve time-structure between transmission events.",

Thus, rather than assuming a constant transmission rate throughout an infected person's disease stages, we tested 7 different infectivity profiles varying the ratio between the acute and chronic transmission rates and measured how they affected network model discrimination. The transmission rate in the pre-AIDS stage was held constant. Tree height becomes much less informative of network type the bigger the difference is between acute and chronic stage infectivity (Fig 4A) . This is because higher acute stage infectivity causes more infections in the acute phase and consequently the epidemic spread is faster. Since infection happens so rapidly, the external branches become very long compared to the internal branches, as all internal nodes are pushed to the root the higher the ratio between acute and chronic stage infectivity. Therefore, the total tree height is dominated by the external branch lengths (which are on average 1/\u03b3). Similarly, mean internal over external branch lengths, which was an important index when constant infectivity was assumed, is less informative if we assume high acute/chronic stage infectivity ratios. Differences observed between ER and BA assuming a constant infectivity profile diminish (Fig 4D) . Hence, branch length and tree height measures are less informative of network type when differences in acute-chronic infectivity are considered. Topological tree measures, i.e., cherries per taxa, and Sackin's Index, were less affected by differences in acute-chronic infectivities ( Fig  4B and 4C ). Both these measures, calculated on the possible virus genealogies, still informed about the underlying contact network structure that HIV spread upon.",

We did that by introducing variability in the overall infectivity level while keeping the acute-chronic ratio at 10:1 (\u03c3 = 0, 3, 10). While it was clear that introducing a non-constant infectivity profile diminished genealogical differences between underlying contact network structures, it was less obvious what effect introducing between-patient variation had (Fig 5) . While tree height remained with no power to discriminate between networks, internal to external branch length ratios became more discriminative (BA had lowest ratio, ER intermediary, and WS high). Individual variability seems to affect tree symmetry near the root more than towards the tips, since the Sackin's Index shows much more variation than the number of cherries per taxa. However, they both improved their power to discriminate between contact network structures, and Sackin's Index could differentiate WS from BA and ER networks. Thus, these simulations showed that the complex interactions that affect the resulting tree statistics when multiple levels of variability interact (within-host coalescence process, timing of infections relative to disease-and epidemic-stage, disease-stage infectivity differences, and patient individual variation), may induce non-trivial dynamic patterns.",

At 100% sampling of infecteds at any time during an epidemic, the mean branch length increases as a function of total number of sampled infecteds (number of taxa, Fig 6B) . BA typically produces shorter tree branches than ER and WS as more individuals are sampled. Thus, if it were possible to sample everyone at time of infection, then the trend of adding longer tips towards the end of the epidemic becomes more pronounced (Fig 6A) . The internal to external branch length ratios typically decrease as the epidemic progresses (S4B Fig) . This is mainly explained by the depletion of susceptible neighbors for individuals infected late in an epidemic, thus generating very long external branches. In addition, branches added later in the epidemic, resulting from chronic donors, divide already existing branches into shorter segments. BA trees show lower ratios than ER and WS throughout the epidemic, but WS and ER are less distinguishable during an epidemic. On the topological level, the Sackin's Index typically decreases as an epidemic matures (Fig 6C) . At the end of an epidemic (Fig 3) , BA and ER show more unbalanced trees throughout an epidemic and the most imbalanced trees come from WS networks (Fig 6C and 6D) . Simulations on networks of size 5000 show similar results: for comparison, see Fig 6 with S5 Fig and S4 Fig with S6 Fig. Thus , while these statistics are indicative of the underlying contact network, they are confounded by epidemic stage and the size of the susceptible population.

Interestingly, lower sampling fraction increases mean branch lengths derived from any underlying contact network (S7 Fig). This happens because the remaining branches in the genealogy represent increased numbers of infected hosts. However, this effect does not cause additional confusion over that caused by epidemic stage, as the differences between BA, ER, and WS networks are distinct at all epidemic stages and number of infected. On the other hand, we do not usually know at what stage an epidemic is (i.e., number of actually infected) but only the number of sampled hosts. The mean branch length as a function of number of taxa (Fig 7) could mislead the inference of underlying contact network, especially for small sample fractions. In fact, any branch length or tree height index would be affected by mistaking number of sampled hosts with stage of the epidemic because the number of infected grows faster than the number of sampled early in an epidemic.",

In the ABC analysis of the two IDU HIV-1 transmission chains among IDU we have assumed the same epidemiological model as in the simulations (stage-varying infectivity profile with ratio 10:1 acute:chronic, patient infectivity variation (\u03c3 = 3)) and a sampling fraction of 50%. For the CRF01 IDU outbreak, the susceptible population was assumed to be 200 and in the Swedish subtype B ongoing epidemic it was set to 3000. Results are shown in Table 3 .",

            "text": "In this study we addressed several outstanding factors that could affect HIV phylogenetic tree shape in addition to the underlying contact network upon which HIV spreads. While previous studies have evaluated how contact networks affect the resulting tree [13, 14, 16] , they ignored differences between transmission trees and virus phylogenies, varying infectivity over disease progression, among patient infectivity variation, sampling fraction, and epidemic stage. Here, we show that all these factors put further restrictions on what type of phylogeny one can expect, but also that these additional factors may confound the inference of contact network. Transmission histories are not perfectly reconstructed by virus phylogenies. In fact, it has been previously shown that virus phylogenies have a time bias that elongates external branches, shifts internal nodes backwards, and may cause lineage disordering relative to the transmission history [19] . In this study we account for these factors by sampling (many) possible virus genealogies from a transmission history using a recently developed within-host coalescent model [21] . Because many virus genealogies may be consistent with one single transmission history, one would expect this factor to add uncertainty to the network inference. However, there is also added signal about transmission times because the within-host diversity changes over the time of infection. Thus, because the degree distributions are different for each network type (Fig 1) , transmissions happen after different lengths of infection time, which affects the phylogenetic tree shape. Indeed, we show that the contact network inference from virus genealogies can be quite different than that from transmission trees, and that tree balance differences in fact may be more informative using virus phylogenies. Besides, transmission histories or trees can never be observed, or only partially and then with great uncertainty, which is the main reason for turning to phylogenetic reconstruction in the first place.",

Indeed, we find that varying infectivity affects the expected phylogeny under different contact networks. In fact, this factor alone seems to diminish phylogenetic differences between contact networks. Somewhat surprisingly, patient variation in infectivity works in the opposite direction, i.e., it seemed to amplify differences in the contact network structures. The result is that virus genealogies do carry a signal of what type of contact network HIV spread upon, but the expectations are different than what one would expect from a na\u00efve model where no virus diversity exists and all hosts are described by an identical constant infectivity over their pathogenesis.",

In certain settings, ER and BA behaved similarly (and differently from WS). In this case, it is likely that the difference is due to clustering, since there is no large difference between the degree distributions in the ER and WS, whilst WS is the only network (among the three considered) allowing clustering. In some other scenarios, WS and ER behaved more similarly (and differently from BA). This is most likely due to the different degree distributions.",

The model used for validating the ABC algorithm included stage varying infectivity, individual, and within-host variability. For complex models such as epidemic spreads on networks the likelihood function is computationally costly to evaluate and ABC offered a way to perform likelihood-free statistical inference. Furthermore, the use of summary statistics allowed us to study the relationship between readily measurable tree statistics and complex transmission dynamics. The analysis of the two outbreaks from the Swedish HIV-1 epidemic showed that inference on real datasets is typically much harder. As is to be expected, real world networks do not match perfectly with the simplified models considered in this study, that were chosen for comparability with previous studies [13, 14, 16] . In fact, in the ABC algorithm, the proposed parameters values are accepted if the simulated data based on them are close enough to the observed data. If the observed data were generated from a rather different or more complex model, then the simulated data from the candidate model probably will be far away from the observed data. Hence, very few proposed parameter values will be accepted. More realistic models, such as dynamic networks, may be able to better capture the features of the outbreaks, especially those occurring over a long period of time. Another class of network models that could be suitable in modelling these outbreaks is the configuration model which is flexible and has been studied extensively in the literature, or exponential random graph models (although in general slower to fit to data) which include a broader spectrum of degree distributions and clustering levels rather than the three simple networks considered here. The ABC inference scheme can also be extended to take into account uncertainty in the phylogenetic reconstruction, as shown in [56] . Each summary statistics calculated on the simulated trees would then be compared to the distribution of the same statistics calculated on the posterior distribution of virus genealogies. Romero et al. [56] apply this procedure investigating transmission between a heterosexual couple. However, the outbreaks we are analyzing in this paper are bigger in size and the whole algorithm would be more computationally expensive. Lastly, this work could be further extended to integrate other sources of network data coming from social surveys and/or public health intervention studies, as recently outlined in a review paper by [57] to improve network analysis in HIV epidemiology. The length of the acute phase was assumed constant, t 1 = 30 days while \u03b2 was assumed to be 1/8 year \u22121 . We do not assume a length for the AIDS phase a priori, but if an individual reaches the third stage, he will stay in the third phase until he is diagnosed or until death occurs.

The effective viral population size is modelled as a two piece linear function: first, it grows at rate \u03b2 1 until a random peak time t x , allowed to vary among individuals between t a and t b .
