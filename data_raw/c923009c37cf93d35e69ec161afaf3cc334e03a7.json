Development of molecular technologies allowed a better understanding of bronchiolitis aetiology. Results from cohort studies evaluating the association between single, multiple viral infections and clinical outcomes are conflicting. Data on viral bronchiolitis in children were found to be limited in Qatar. This study aimed to determine frequency and seasonal trends of viral pathogens causing acute bronchiolitis, and to explore association between viral pathogens, disease severity and length of stay (LOS). Methods: This is a retrospective descriptive study, including children admitted in 2010 and 2011 with acute bronchiolitis. Presenting history, physical examination and respiratory viral co-infections as detected by molecular assays were analysed. Results: At least one virus was detected in 315/369 (85.4%) of included children with single and multiple viruses in 67 and 33% of cases respectively. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most detected virus, accounting for 51. 2% followed by rhinovirus (RV) in 25.5% of cases. Fall and summer admissions were associated with longer LOS. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, retraction (OR 3.96; 95% CI 1.64,9.59) and age group 1-3 months (OR 3.09; 95% CI 1.06,9.05) were associated with longer LOS. Crepitation (OR 9.15; 95% CI 1.58,53.13), retraction (OR 4.10; 95% CI 1.05,16.12) and respiratory rate (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.28,1.66) were associated with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. Identifying the viral agent did not influence disease severity or LOS.",

            "text": "Bronchiolitis is considered one of the earliest and most common causes of hospitalisation among young children during their first 2 years of life [1] . Although the causative agents include bacteria, fungi and viruses, this acute infection is mainly attributed to respiratory syncytial virus, accounting for 50-90% of the cases [2, 3] . With the current utilisation of reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the detection of specific viral nucleic acids facilitated a better understanding of the viral aetiology of the infection. The 2014 American Academy of Paediatrics bronchiolitis guideline recommends against the routine use of radiographic or laboratory studies on the basis that knowing the infecting pathogen would rarely alter the clinical management [4] . However, a growing body of literature has identified an association between specific infecting pathogens with short and long-term outcomes [5] . Association between viral co-infection and disease severity have been assessed in several studies but with conflicting findings [5] [6] [7] . Although bronchiolitis is a self-limiting condition, hospitalisation rate has increased during the last two decades [3] . Assessment of bronchiolitis severity, through a combination of clinical symptoms and physical signs, remains a standard measure in daily practice though its impact on clinical outcomes, such as length of hospital stay, has yet to be confirmed. Data has been reported on seasonal variation of viral activity with conflicting evidence on its significance on disease severity and clinical outcomes [8, 9] . In Qatar, viral aetiology of bronchiolitis in children has been limited. Therefore the aims of this retrospective, descriptive study were: to determine the frequency and seasonal trends of viral pathogens causing acute bronchiolitis, and to explore the association between specific viral pathogens, disease severity and length of stay (LOS).",

For every child who met the inclusion criteria the following data were collected: age, gender, family history of asthma and/or atopy, clinical presentation and vital signs upon admission and length of hospital stay. Bronchiolitis severity was based on a score ranging between 1 and 5 that assessed wheezing, retraction, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation (see Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Patients with score of 1 or 2 were considered to have mild bronchiolitis and to have moderate to severe bronchiolitis if score was between 3 and 4, with 5 indicating respiratory failure. Wheezing on physical exam was categorised as none, mild, moderate or severe. Retraction was categorised as none, intercostal, intercostal and subcostal or intercostal and subcostal with seesaw chest motion. Viral identification laboratory results, medical therapy and need of mechanical ventilation during hospital stay were recorded.

In children aged <1 month, the most common detected virus was RSV (47.9%); for those between 1 and 3 months of age, RV (47.2%) was the most common virus. Children aged >3 months were found to be co-infected with RSV + RV (40%). Co-infection with RSV+ non-RV (75.8%) had the highest incidence in males whereas in females, RV+ non-RSV co-infection (40.9%) dominated. Family history of atopy or asthma, P = 0.008, and high respiratory rate, P = 0.026, were more common in RV single group, whereas crepitation was more frequent in the RSV+ non-RV co-infection group, P = 0.039. More children in the RV single group (91.7%) had LOS \u22654 days compared to the RSV single group (82.4%). Similar pattern was observed in terms of bronchiolitis severity with more children in the RV single group (65.7%) with moderate to severe bronchiolitis compared to children in the RSV single group (57.6%).

On multivariate logistic regression analysis, crepitation (adjusted OR 9.15; 95% CI 1.58,53.13; P = 0.014), retraction (OR 4.10; 95% CI 1.05,16.12; P = 0.043), and increased respiratory rate (adjusted OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.28,1.66; P < 0.001) were significant predictors associated with bronchiolitis severity, provided in Additional file 1: Table S3 .

Our study revealed that RSV and RV were the most commonly detected causative agents. This finding is in contrast to a previous report with a small sample size of 56 children with respiratory tract infection (RTI) in Qatar in which hMPV was the most frequently isolated virus [10] . Our findings are, however, in line with a number of large studies conducted in the Middle East and elsewhere [11] [12] [13] [14] . In Jordanian children of less than 2 years of age, RSV was a major cause of hospitalisation [11] . Other studies conducted in Saudi Arabia and Turkey reported the same [15, 16] . Geographic variations in seasonal activity of the most commonly detected respiratory viruses have been reported in the literature. In temperate countries, RSV peaks during the winter season, but with variation in the tropics. This diversity is mainly attributed to the region's climate characteristics, i.e. relative humidity, average monthly temperature and rainfall [17] [18] [19] . In their study, Haynes et al. assessed RSV seasonality in seven countries with diverse climate characteristics and found that RSV onset and peak timings were inconsistent with climate characteristics in all assessed countries apart from Thailand. RSV offset was found to be consistent in Guatemala [20] . Rhinovirus A was detected all year around with high proportion by the onset of summer in Japan but during the fall and spring in Cyprus while Rhinovirus C was mainly detected in the winter but during the fall and spring in Japan and Cyprus, respectively [18, 21] . In this study, RSV exhibited a strong seasonal pattern with peak activity during the fall and summer months, in contrast to RV, which showed minimal circulation during the fall.",
