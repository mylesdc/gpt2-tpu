Through in vitro studies, we show that virus infection up-regulated RANTES production at both mRNA and protein levels in human brain-derived cell lines and primary progenitor-derived astrocytes. Furthermore, IRF-3 pathway appeared to be essential for TBEV-induced RANTES production. Site mutation of an IRF-3-binding motif abrogated the RANTES promoter activity in virus-infected brain cells. Moreover, IRF-3 was activated upon TBEV infection as evidenced by phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF-3, while blockade of IRF-3 activation drastically reduced virus-induced RANTES expression.",

TBEV consists of three subtypes: the European subtype (TBEV-Eu) in most parts of Europe; Siberian subtype in eastern Europe, Russia, and northern Asia; and Far Eastern subtype (TBEV-FE) in eastern Russia and some parts of China and Japan. TBEV-Eu is mainly transmitted by Ixodes ricinus and the other two subtypes by Ixodes persulcatus [1] . In humans, TBEV causes a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from flu-like febrile disease to encephalitis of differing severity levels [2] . The clinical outcome may in part depend upon the subtype of TBEV infection. TBEV-Eu and TBEV-Sib subtypes are usually associated with milder disease, with mortality rates of 0.5-2 %. In contrast, infection with the TBEV-FE subtype results in the most severe CNS disorder, with mortality rates of up to 40 % and higher rates of severe neurologic sequelae [3, 4] .",

During the stage of active viremia, virus may cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and invade the CNS where it causes profound destruction of nerve cells [2] . The most severe forms of TBE may be characterized by major damage to neurons in different parts of the brain and spinal cord [4] . Generally, CNS pathology is the consequence of viral infection of corresponding cells and the resulting neuroinflammatory responses. In clinical studies, common findings include immunohistochemical staining of TBEV antigen in large neurons of human brains of fatal cases with relatively short natural clinical course. However, topographical correlation between inflammatory changes and distribution of viral antigens is poor, since affected regions with prominent inflammatory infiltrates and marked neuronal damage contained only few immunolabeled structures [7] . Furthermore, it was found that granzyme B-releasing cytotoxic T cells contribute significantly to neuronal damage in human TBE [8] , supporting the notion that liberation of inflammatory mediators and recruitment of cytotoxic T cells may contribute to nerve cell dysfunction in human TBEV infection. In a TBEV-infected mouse model, CD8 + T cells was also shown to play a pivotal role in the immunopathology of TBE as evidenced by prolonged survival of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) or CD8 \u2212/\u2212 mice following infection, compared with immunocompetent mice or mice with adoptively transferred CD8 + T cells [9] .",

Mediocre induction of RANTES in response to TBEV infection was found as early as 3 days post challenge (13.9 \u00b1 0.6-fold increase). Then, sustained up-regulation of RANTES in CNS was observed from day 4 to day 8 after infection. Closely mimicking the results from the protein array analysis, a robust increase in RANTES protein expression was observed on day 5 (226.6 \u00b1 11.7-fold increase) and persisted up to day 8 (258.8 \u00b1 10.5-fold increase) p.i. within the brain tissue. Interestingly, the induction pattern of RANTES expression appeared to be coincided with the dynamics of immune cell infiltration in the CNS. It is noteworthy that no concomitant increase of RANTES expression was recorded in tested peripheral tissues and sera (Fig. 3b) . Besides, the protein abundance for RANTES (in pg/ml) in the brain was also greater than those observed in tested peripheral tissues and sera following ic TBEV infection (data not shown). To strengthen that the results obtained from 1-week-old mice are also valid in adult mice, RANTES protein levels in the brain and serum were also measured in mice aged 7-8 weeks after ic infection with TBEV. By day 5 p.i., a slight increase in RANTES expression occurred in the brain of adult mice (2.9 \u00b1 0.5-fold increase).

To investigate the mechanism by which TBEV induces RANTES in the CNS, the ability of TBEV infection to trigger RANTES expression in human brain-derived cell lines was assessed. TBEV significantly induced RANTES production both at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in human glioblastoma cells T98G at 24 h p.i. and reached a high level at 72 h p.i. compared with mock-infected controls (Fig. 5a, b) . Human astrocytoma cells CCF-STTG1 and neuroblastoma cells SK-N-SH were also capable of significantly expressing RANTES in response to TBEV infection, but the level of RANTES expression was generally much lower than that in T98G cells (Fig. 5c-f ). To examine whether TBEV infection induces RANTES expression in primary CNS cells, further experiments were conducted using HPDAs as a model. RANTES transcription was induced by TBEV infection, with the increase started at 24 h p.i. and peaked at 72 h p.i. (Fig. 5g) . The protein levels of RANTES reached the peak at 72 h p.i., and the pattern was similar to that of the three cell lines described above (Fig. 5h) . In tested virus-infected brain cells, the upregulation of RANTES gene expression by TBEV was likely replication dependent, since UV inactivation dramatically impaired the ability of TBEV to induce RANTES mRNA expression and protein secretion. To reveal the kinetics of virus replication, virus titers were measured for the indicated time points by TCID 50 assay. As shown in Fig. 5i , TBEV replicated efficiently in all cell lines tested. Increasing titers of infectious virus were observed after 24 h p.i., and the maximum titer of virus was attained after 72 h p.i. Given the above-described RANTES expression profile, its production appeared to be significantly induced at time points that coincided with significant virus replication in human brain-derived cells. It was also found that viral replication was coupled to RANTES upregulation in alveolar epithelial A549 cells (Additional file 1: Figure S1A -C). However, though TBEV could replicate in human monocytic cell line THP-1, RANTES production was not significantly induced after infection of this cell line, demonstrating a cell type-specific pattern of RANTES production (Additional file 1: Figure S1D -F). To conclude, the human brain cells are capable of significantly producing RANTES upon TBEV infection, although the level of induced RANTES may vary depending on the cell type.",

As shown in Fig. 6d , mutation of the ISRE site not only affected the promoter basal activity but also nearly completely abolished TBEV-induced RANTES promoter activation.

BX795 significantly blocked the TBEVinduced phosphorylation of IRF-3 at Ser396. Furthermore, secretion of RANTES from T98G and CCF-STTG1 cells was significantly blocked in the presence of BX795. In contrast, treatment with MG132, a potent inhibitor of NF-kB activation, had no effect on RANTES release in virus-infected cells. Therefore, it appears that TBEV-induced production of RANTES is unlikely dependent on the NF-kB signaling pathway (Fig. 7e) .

NS not significant on aspects of extracerebral infection and neuroinvasion, we challenged mice with TBEV via ic route. Pathological analysis of CNS tissues from moribund mice demonstrated marked leukocytes infiltration, which is consistent with autopsy studies on human patients infected with TBEV [7, 8] . Once in the CNS, there are three possible mechanisms by which flaviviruses induce brain tissue destruction leading to the clinical manifestations of disease. Virus infection may directly lead to neuronal cell injury and virus-induced neuroinflammatory responses may cause neuronal death, or both [9, 35] . CNS pathology of TBEV is considered to be, at least in part, due to viral infection of corresponding cells, since virus induces both apoptosis and necrosis in human neural cells and also in mouse and monkey brain neurons [36] [37] [38] [39] . However, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that abnormal immune response is one major cause of tissue damage and fatal encephalitis [40] . TBEV infection of the CNS has been shown to result in markedly enhanced leukocyte migration into the brain tissue and immune-mediated BBB breakdown, both of which corresponded with excessive expression of chemokines and cytokines in the brain parenchyma [41] . Using an Ab array that detects 40 immune factors, we observed that TBEV infection stimulated several inflammatory mediators, including chemokine RANTES and MCP-1 and cytokines IL-12p40p70, IL-12p70, and IL-4. Our findings are in line with previous studies on chemokine and cytokine profiles of mouse CNS infected with the Neudoerfl strain of TBEV-Eu subtype or the Sofjin strain of TBEV-FE subtype, demonstrating a common induction pattern of these immune mediators among TBEV infection [41, 42] . It is noteworthy that we did not observe a significant increase of certain proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-6. This could be due to the sensitivity of the protein array adopted, various immune responses of distinct mouse models, or the difference in inducing specific cytokines by different TBEV strains. These need to be clarified in future studies.",

In this report, we found that CC chemokine RANTES was one of the most rapidly and rigorously induced molecule in the CNS during TBEV infection. The increasing level of RANTES expression between 3 and 8 days p.i. was shown to be consistent with increasing immune cell infiltrates and neuroinflammation in virus-infected 1-week-old mice. Besides, ic infection of TBEV in adult mice also induced a significant increase in the level of RANTES within CNS, but not in sera. These findings suggest that the capability of inducing RANTES expression by TBEV infection seems not to depend on age of the mouse. Even though the neonatal immune system is somewhat less mature than those of adult, neonates are not immune privileged, especially under high inflammatory conditions. A large body of evidence indicated that the mouse neonatal immune system is capable of mounting virus-specific T cell-based immune responses, as well as protective memory and Ab responses [43] [44] [45] . In other studies, increased expression of RANTES was found in neonatal mice after infection with viruses such as coxsackievirus B3 [46] and influenza virus [47] or protozoan parasite such as Cryptosporidium parvum [48] . It should be noted that though neonatal mice are a relatively highsensitive model for the study of flavivirus infections, peripheral administration of WH2012 strain via either ip, sc [18] , or im (data not shown) route did not lead to 100 % lethality. These data indicate that WH2012 strain used in this study is less pathogenic, as compared with some highly virulent TBEV isolates, such as strain Hypr [49] and strain Sofjin [50] .",

It has been reported that several viruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and rabies virus (RABV) can up-regulate RANTES production within CNS [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . Moreover, we demonstrated a TBEV-induced robust expression of RANTES in human brain-derived cell cultures that recapitulated the cell types normally found in the brain including neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. It is worth noting that RANTES was dramatically increased neither in tested peripheral tissues nor in sera. Similar findings were previously reported in human cases of TBE, showing that RANTES was significantly increased in CSF, but not in sera [12, 14] . Furthermore, our in vitro culture systems showed that TBEV induces the production of RANTES which is functionally active in recruiting human monocytic cells. Therefore, the strikingly high expression of RANTES within CNS is likely to be one of the mediators that form a concentration gradient in the brain during TBEV infection. For describing a specific involvement of RANTES in experimental TBE, future research should define the activated cell types which will be recruited into CNS after RANTES production upon TBEV infection.",

In agreement with our study, a previous report showed that, in a severe herpes simplex encephalitis mouse model, treatment with either Met-RANTES or anti-RANTES mAb decreased leukocyte recruitment into the brain of HSV-1infected mice [54] . Moreover, Met-RANTES treatment significantly reduced proinflammatory chemokine or cytokine production in the CNS and prolonged survival time of the mice after RABV infection [56] . Considering the important role of RANTES in exerting a potent chemotactic effect on both monocytes and T cells, our data suggest that both immune cells infiltrate reduction and survival extension in treated TBEVinfected mice was, at least in part, correlated with the blockade of RANTES alone. Early studies demonstrated the importance of CCR5, which is one of the receptors of RANTES, as a protective factor in the context of flaviviral infections. With the use of knockout mice, it was demonstrated that CCR5 deficiency reduced immune cell infiltration of the CNS and increased mortality after peripheral inoculation of WNV [57] or JEV [58] . In humans, homozygosity for the CCR5\u039432 allele is associated with the predisposition to the clinical TBE in Lithuanian people [59, 60] , but not Russian people [61] . These findings suggest that CCR5 deficiency is probably relevant to a weakened immune defense against evading flaviviruses. However, it can be speculated that direct administration of a receptor antagonist to the brain is clearly different to a systemic loss of the receptor, which may be ascribes to significant difference between the immune response elicited in the CNS and the response in the periphery. Moreover, it would be expected that antagonizing RANTES alone may differ from blockade of CCR5, in which both binding of a number of chemokines and recruitment of main immune cell types may be affected. In this study, we were not able to draw any conclusions on relationships between disease severities of TBE and a functional RANTES-CCR5 axis. Future studies with conditional RANTES and CCR5 knockout mouse models may help delineating the pathogenic mechanisms of the disease.",

Therefore, it seems that blockade of RANTES within CNS appears to result in alteration of the immune/inflammatory response, rather than a simple modulation of increase or decrease in the level of TBEV infection. Since both viral infection and host immune responses likely contribute to the pathogenesis of TBE, enhancement of the antiviral activity against TBEV and amelioration of the neuroinflammatory response may theoretically help in reducing the severity of the disease. Further studies are needed to determine whether concomitant administration of antivirus drugs together with antiinflammatory agents could offer an additive beneficial effect on TBE. With respect to other chemokines induced by TBEV, antagonizing MCP-1 within CNS did not significantly ameliorate TBEV infection (data not shown). However, future research is warranted to explore whether some of the detected or as yet unidentified immune mediators contribute individually and synergistically to neuroinflammatory responses in the process of TBEV infection.",

            "text": "In this study, we found that TBEV infection could induce RANTES production in human brain-derived cell lines and primary progenitor-derived astrocytes in vitro. This up-regulation was not detectable as early as 6 h p.i., and measurable RANTES mRNA expression and protein release only occurred between 24 and 48 h p.i. The results observed here are reminiscent of some previous studies on delay of IFN induction upon TBEV infection. At early stages of infection, viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was mainly found within ER-derived vesicles, thus to be largely unavailable for cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors (PRR) [62, 63] . Similarly, the mechanism behind the delay of RANTES production might also be that TBEV induces replication vesicles, thereby delaying the detection of viral dsRNA by PRR sensors. Although it is known that TBEV infection can induce RANTES production in vivo and in vitro, the underlying mechanism contributing to the induction of RANTES after TBEV infection has not been explored. Using brain-derived cells as a model, we demonstrated that TBEV infection activated the RANTES promoter in both time-and dose-dependent manners. It is generally believed that expression of many of the chemokine genes is regulated primarily at the level of transcription, and their promoter regions contain recognition sites for virus-activated transcription factors [64] . Binding sites for a wide variety of transcription factors annotated within the RANTES promoter include IRFs, NF-kB, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/activating protein 1 (AP-1) [29, 65] . These transcription factors have been shown to contribute to the differential regulation of RANTES gene expression, depending on the virus and the cell type [53, [66] [67] [68] [69] . We revealed in this study that TBEV-induced transcription of RANTES is mainly mediated by activation of the IRF-3 pathway. This conclusion is based on several lines of evidence: (i) mutation of the ISRE site almost completely abolished TBEVinduced promoter activation; (ii) over-expression of IRF-3, but not IRF-7 or IkB\u03b1 dominant-negative mutant, efficiently inhibited TBEV-induced RANTES production; (iii) TBEV infection triggered the phosphorylation of endogenous IRF-3 in a time-dependent manner; and (iv) addition of inhibitor targeting TBK1-IRF-3 signaling pathway considerably reduced RANTES production in T98G and CCF-CTTG1 cells.",

By interacting with mitochondrial adapter protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), RIG-I/MDA5 directs the activation of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 [72] [73] [74] . Activated TBK1 mediates IRF-3 phosphorylation, which ultimately leads to the transcription of type I IFN and other cellular genes with host defense functions. For instance, phosphorylation of IRF-3 can directly stimulate RANTES transcription [66] . In other scenarios, IRF-3 is also of particular importance in synergistically promoting RANTES expression, together with NF-kB activation [67, 75] . In the current study, we showed that RIG-I/MDA5-and TBK1-directed IRF-3 phosphorylation is critical for TBEV-induced RANTES expression. In contrast, NF-kB pathway did not appear to play an essential role in stimulating RANTES transcription following TBEV infection, as evidenced by both transfection experiments with dominantnegative mutants of IkB\u03b1 and pretreatment studies with NF-kB inhibitor MG132. It is conceivable that the pathways leading to activation of IRF-3 may distinct from the potential pathways that stimulate NF-kB in our system. Since ISRE promoters are activated by cellular IRFs but do not require NF-kB activation, we speculate that IRF-3-mediated activation of the ISRE is a major determinant of the induction of RANTES transcription after TBEV infection. It is important to note that other IRFs, exemplified by IRF1, have been shown to contribute to RANTES induction after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection [29] . Thus, though our results support the idea that IRF3 is involved in RANTES expression during TBEV infection, the potential role for other IRFs could not be excluded. Future studies will be important and interesting to clarify whether a somewhat activated form of other IRFs could, possibly in synergy with IRF3 signaling, result in the induction of RANTES after TBEV infection.",

In addition, our findings reveal the molecular pathway of TBEV-mediated induction of RANTES, involving activation of RIG-I/MDA5 and TBK1, with subsequent activation of IRF-3 resulting in increased RANTES expression. These findings expand the current knowledge of the role of specific chemokines during TBEV infection and render RANTES particularly interesting for further investigations in human and experimental TBE.",
