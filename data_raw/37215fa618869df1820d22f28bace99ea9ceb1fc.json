            "text": "In response to viral infection, host cells activate various antiviral responses to inhibit virus replication. While feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) manipulates the host early innate immune response in many different ways, the host could activate the antiviral response to counteract it through some unknown mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) which serve as a class of regulatory factors in the host, participate in the regulation of the host innate immune response against virus infection. In this study, we found that the expression levels of miR-26a were significantly upregulated upon FHV-1 infection. Furthermore, FHV-1 infection induced the expression of miR-26a via a cGAS-dependent pathway, and knockdown of cellular cGAS significantly blocked the expression of miR-26a induced by poly (dA:dT) or FHV-1 infection. Next, we investigated the biological function of miR-26a during viral infection. miR-26a was able to increase the phosphorylation of STAT1 and promote type I IFN signaling, thus inhibiting viral replication. The mechanism study showed that miR-26a directly targeted host SOCS5. Knockdown of SOCS5 increased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and enhanced the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response, and overexpression of suppressor of the cytokine signalling 5 (SOCS5) decreased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and inhibited the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response. Meanwhile, with the knockdown of SOCS5, the upregulated expression of phosphorylated STAT1 and the anti-virus effect induced by miR-26a were significantly inhibited. Taken together, our data demonstrated a new strategy of host miRNAs against FHV-1 infection by enhancing IFN antiviral signaling.",

Like other herpesviruses, latent chronic infection is a characteristic of FHV-1 infection. FHV-1 can hide in the trigeminal ganglia of cats in latency and can reactivate under certain conditions, which is also a latent infectious source [9, 10] . Previous studies indicated that \u03b1-herpesviruses usually encoded 65-80 open reading frames (ORFs) [11] , and similarly, FHV-1 encoded 74 viral proteins [12] . These viral proteins contribute to manipulating the host innate immune response. Our previous studies found that a total of 11 viral proteins (UL30, ICP0, UL11, UL55, UL1, UL45, UL27, UL3.5, UL48, UL4 and US3) could inhibit the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity [13] . Activated type I IFN signalling is suppressed within 12 h after FHV-1 infection [13] , but it is unclear how and what ways the host would use to counteract viral immune evasion.",

            "text": "MicroRNAs are short noncoding RNAs of approximately 20-24 nt that are processed by two RNase III enzymes (Drosha and Dicer) from long primary RNAs [14] [15] [16] , which play a crucial part in the regulation of gene expression post-transcriptionally through mRNA degradation or translational inhibition via seed regions complementary to the 3 UTR of target genes [17, 18] . Many miRNAs have been demonstrated to play important regulatory roles in the innate immune response [19] . Some studies have demonstrated that JAK-STAT signalling could be regulated by host miRNAs by targeting the proteins of the suppressor of the cytokine signalling (SOCS) family, such as SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS3 and SOCS5 [20] . miR-155 feedback enhanced type I IFN signalling by suppressing SOCS1 and inhibiting viral replication [21] . miR-30a-5p downregulated the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 via directly targeting their 3' UTRs [22] , which also enhanced IFN-I antiviral signalling. miR-130b and miR-432 enhanced the expression of IFN-\u03b2 by targeting cellular SOCS5 [23, 24] . During viral infection, host innate immunity is blocked at an early stage, and our previous studies also suggested that activated type I IFN signalling was quickly suppressed after FHV-1 infection [13] , but some miRNAs are still upregulated to enhance IFN signalling pathways [21, 23] . More importantly, it has been reported that some microRNAs can also inhibit virus replication by targeting viral genomes directly [25, 26] . Given the critical roles of miRNAs in regulating type I IFN signalling, it is unknown whether the host uses these miRNAs to restart the IFN signalling pathways upon FHV-1 infection.",

In this study, we demonstrated that miR-26a could suppress FHV-1 replication by enhancing type I IFN-induced antiviral signalling by directly targeting a negative regulator of this pathway, SOCS5. FHV-1 infection induced the expression of miR-26a in a cGAS-dependent manner. Moreover, SOCS5 plays a vital role in the host response to FHV-1 infection, and knockdown of SOCS5 would reduce the antivirus effect induced by miR-26a. This study reveals a new strategy in which host miRNAs are involved in inhibiting FHV-1 replication by regulating the innate immune signalling pathway.",

RIG-I, as an RNA virus sensor, recognises viral double-stranded RNA to detect invading viruses [29] . Our previous study demonstrated that FHV-1 early infection could activate the DNA virus sensor, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), to induce the IFN-\u03b2 [13] . Then, we investigated whether miR-26a was induced through the cGAS during FHV-1 infection. To confirm this, F81 cells were treated with poly(dA:dT), a synthetic double-stranded DNA, which can be sensed by the cGAS-STING pathway [30] . Then, the expression level of miR-26a was examined by qPCR. Indeed, miR-26a expression level was significantly increased after treatment with poly (dA:dT) for 12 h or 24 h (Figure 2A ). To further examine the role of cGAS in the expression of miR-26a, endogenous cGAS was knocked down by the siRNA method ( Figure 2B ) and then FHV-1or poly (dA:dT)-induced miR-26a expression level was analysed by qPCR. The results showed that knockdown of cGAS impaired miR-26a expression upon FHV-1 infection ( Figure 2C ) or poly (dA:dT) treatment ( Figure 2D ) and led to approximately 50% less expression than the mock transfection group. These data suggested that miR-26a was induced after FHV-1 infection through the cGAS-mediated signalling pathway.",

To explore the role of miR-26a in FHV-1 replication, F81 cells were transfected with miR-26a mimics or inhibitors for 24 h and inoculated with FHV-1 at an MOI of 0.1. At 24 hpi, the supernatant was harvested for the plaque assay, and the protein and RNA levels from cells were analysed through WB and qPCR, respectively. UL42, a DNA polymerase subunit of FHV-1, is an essential gene for viral replication, which can reflect the replication level of FHV-1, therefore, it was selected to detect FHV-1 replication level in the cells. As shown in Figure 3A , compared with the NC (negative control) mimics transfection group, transfection with miR-26a mimics (miR-26a) significantly reduced the expression of viral UL42 (Figure 3A Down) and resulted in a 10-fold decrease in virus production ( Figure 3A Up), as well as a 7-fold decrease in DNA abundance ( Figure 3B ). Moreover, miR-26a inhibitors (miR-26a-I) exhibited significant promoting effects on viral protein expression and virus titres, as well as genome abundance relative to NC inhibitors (NC-I) ( Figure 3A ,B). All these data demonstrated that miR-26a could significantly suppress FHV-1 replication. examine the role of cGAS in the expression of miR-26a, endogenous cGAS was knocked down by the siRNA method ( Figure 2B ) and then FHV-1-or poly (dA:dT)-induced miR-26a expression level was analysed by qPCR. The results showed that knockdown of cGAS impaired miR-26a expression upon FHV-1 infection ( Figure 2C ) or poly (dA:dT) treatment ( Figure 2D ) and led to approximately 50% less expression than the mock transfection group. These data suggested that miR-26a was induced after FHV-1 infection through the cGAS-mediated signalling pathway. 24 h, and then cellular miR-26a was measured by stem-loop qRT-PCR. The expression level of miR-26a was calculated by normalizing to that of snRNA U6, and the uninfected groups served as the mock group.

Then, the potential targets of miR-26a in the host were predicted using Targetscan software (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_71/). Computational analysis showed that the 3 UTR of feline SOCS5, a negative regulatory factor for the JAK-STAT pathway, contains potential target sites of miR-26a, which is complementary to the seed region of this miRNA and conserved in other mammals ( Figure 4A ). To verify whether miR-26a directly targets SOCS5, the 3 UTR of the target sites and its mutants were cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pmiRGLO. Dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that miR-26a mimics significantly decreased luciferase activity by nearly 50%, while miR-26a inhibitors markedly increased that in the cells transfected with pmiRGLO-SOCS5 ( Figure 4B Left) . In contrast, miR-26a mimics and its inhibitors did not affect luciferase activity in the cells transfected with pmiRGLO-SOCS5 mutants (Figure 4B Right) . These data suggest that SOCS5 may be a target gene of miR-26a. To further verify the results, we examined the protein levels of cellular SOCS5 after transfecting miR-26a mimics or its inhibitor. Overexpression of miR-26a significantly decreased the expression of endogenous SOCS5 in F81 cells, whereas the inhibition of miR-26a increased SOCS5 expression ( Figure 4C ).

SOCS5, serving as a target of miR-26a, is a negative regulator of JAK-STAT. So, to explore the effect of miR-26a on IFN antiviral signalling cascades, we analysed the level of phosphorylation of STAT1 (p-STAT1) (Y701) by WB assay. F81 cells were transfected with miR-26a mimics or inhibitors for 24 h, and the p-STAT1 expression levels were detected in the cells infected with FHV-1 for 24 h or stimulated with IFN-\u03b2 for 30 min. With FHV-1 infection or IFN-\u03b2 stimulation, the expression levels of p-STAT1 were significantly enhanced in the cells transfected with miR-26a mimics compared with levels in the NC mimics ( Figure 5A ), whereas the inhibition of endogenous miR-26a by inhibitor resulted in a decrease in p-STAT1s level ( Figure 5B ). Furthermore, we also measured the expression levels of three antiviral ISGs, including ISG15, Viperin and IFITM1, in the presence of miR-26a mimics or its inhibitor upon FHV-1 infection or IFN-\u03b2 stimulation. Consistent with the p-STAT1 detection results, overexpression of miR-26a significantly upregulated the expression of these ISGs induced by FHV-1 infection ( Figure 5C ) or IFN-\u03b2 stimulation ( Figure 5D ), and miR-26a inhibitors decreased the production of these ISGs ( Figure 5E,F) . All of these results demonstrated that miR-26a could promote type I IFN signalling. ",

It was necessary to exclude that miR-26a promotes the phosphorylation of STAT1 by upregulating the expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. First, we screened an effective siRNA#3 targeting on IFNAR1 ( Figure 6C ), then analysed p-STAT1 level induced by miR-26a in the condition of IFNAR1 knockdown. Compared with the siNC control ( Figure 6D Lane 3) , knockdown of the IFNAR1 inhibited the level of p-STAT1 ( Figure 6D Lane 7) upon FHV-1 infection, which demonstrated that knockdown of IFNAR1 blocked activation of downstream STAT1. However, compared with the NC mimics control ( Figure 6D Lane 7) , overexpression of miR-26a mimics could still promote the expression of p-STAT1 ( Figure 6D Lane 8) upon virus infection, revealing that knockdown of IFNAR1 did not block the upregulated expression of p-STAT1 induced by miR-26a.

Then, the expression level of p-STAT1, as well as virus titres, were examined. In the siNC-transfected group ( Figure Figure 8B) . Likewise, the anti-FHV-1 effect induced by miR-26a was also suppressed in SOCS5-silenced cells ( Figure 8B ). Therefore, these data further proved that miR-26a enhanced p-STAT1 expression level via targeting SOCS5, and SOCS5 is a key factor in miR-26a-mediated anti-FHV-1. siSOCS5#1 for 24 h and then inoculated with FHV-1 or IFN-\u03b2. Knockdown of endogenous SOCS5 enhanced the level of p-STAT1 upon FHV-1 infection or IFN-\u03b2 stimulation ( Figure 7F ). Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous SOCS5 also significantly upregulated the expression of three ISGs (ISG15, Viperin and IFITM1) induced by the IFN-\u03b2 treatment compared with the NC control ( Figure 7G ). Moreover, virus titres ( Figure 7H ) and genome copies ( Figure 7I ) were both decreased due to the knockdown of endogenous SOCS5. These data revealed that SOCS5 negatively regulates the JAK-STAT pathway and promotes FHV-1 replication. The relative expression levels of these genes were calculated by normalising to that of cellular 18S RNA. The supernatants and cells were collected for testing virus titres via the plaque assay (C) and virus copies by absolute quantification PCR (D), respectively. (E-I) Knockdown of endogenous SOCS5 enhanced IFN-elicited signalling cascades and suppressed FHV-1 replication. F81 cells were transfected with three siRNAs targeting SOCS5 for 48 h. The silencing efficiency was evaluated through testing cellular SOCS5 by western blot (E). siSOCS5#1 was selected for transfection into F81 cells. Thirty-six hours after transfection, the cells were infected with FHV-1 (MOI = 1 for p-STAT1 expression and ISGs mRNA analysis, and MOI = 0.1 for virus titres analysis) for 24 h or stimulated by IFN-\u03b2 (200 ng/mL) for 30 min. Then, the protein levels of p-STAT1 (F) and the mRNA expression of ISG15, Viperin and IFITM1 (G) were detected according to the method described above. Virus titres (H) and virus copies (I) were determined via the plaque assay or absolute quantification PCR, respectively. Empty vectors and siNC groups served as negative controls. All samples were independently repeated three times, and data are representative of three independent experiments. The significant differences are indicated as follows: NS > 0.05, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01. comparable, and miR-26a-mediated upregulation of p-STAT1 was inhibited compared to the NC group. On the other hand, miR-26a overexpression inhibited FHV-1 infection ( Figure 8B) . Likewise, the anti-FHV-1 effect induced by miR-26a was also suppressed in SOCS5-silenced cells ( Figure 8B ). Therefore, these data further proved that miR-26a enhanced p-STAT1 expression level via targeting SOCS5, and SOCS5 is a key factor in miR-26a-mediated anti-FHV-1. ",

We found that (i) miR-26a can suppress FHV-1 replication; (ii) miR-26a can significantly enhance IFN-I expression levels or IFN-I-induced signalling cascades by directly targeting SOCS5, a negative regulator of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway; and (iii) miR-26a was significantly increased after FHV-1 infection in a cGAS-dependent pathway, while SOCS5 was markedly decreased.

This family mainly functions in negatively regulating the JAK-STAT pathway [33, 34] , which is essential for the activation of downstream antiviral ISGs [35] . Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) induces both SOCS1 [36] and SOCS3 [37, 38] to block type I IFN at early infection stage within 6 h. HSV-1 infection of HEL-30 keratinocytes promoted the SOCS-1 promoter and increased its transcription [39] . Within 6 h post-infection, HSV-1 induced both SOCS1/3 expression, which inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT1 [38, 39] . However, while SOCS1 and SOCS3 were induced after HSV-1 infection, another member of SOCS family, CIS, was downregulated in these cells. In this study, we found that FHV-1 infection decreased the expression of SOCS5.",

In this study, overexpression of SOCS5 can inhibit IFN-induced signalling and promote FHV-1 replication, while knockdown of endogenous SOCS5 enhances the IFN-I signalling cascade and suppresses FHV-1 replication (Figure 7) , which further verified the negative regulatory role of SOCS5. Previous studies have reported that some miRNAs are involved in the innate immune response by targeting SOCS family proteins [22] [23] [24] . We found that miR-26a can directly target SOCS5 and decrease its expression and promote the STAT1 phosphorylation, which is used to inhibit viral replication by the host. Because SOCS5 showed a significant decrease after FHV-1 infection and displayed a negative correlation with the kinetic expression profiles of miR-26a ( Figure 4F ,I). But we cannot ensure that the downregulation of SOCS5 is entirely regulated by miR-26a, since maybe the regulation of SOCS5 is a very complex process related to many other signalling pathways. Nevertheless, the existing experiment results are enough to verify that miR-26a really targets and influences the expression of SOCS5 to a certain extent.",

HSV-1 infection activates a host type I IFN response in the early infection, but the functionality of this response is subsequently blocked by viral proteins [49, 50] , including ICP0 [51] , US11 [52] , UL36 [53] , UL42 [54] , VP16 [55] , VP24 [56] , US3 [57] and UL46 [58] . Our research group reported that the IFN pathway was activated upon FHV-1 infection through the cGAS pathway at early infection but was soon blocked by multi-ORFs of FHV-1 [13] . However, few reports have revealed how hosts activate various antiviral defences to inhibit viral immune evading following infection. cGAS, as an important sensor, could detect DNA virus entry. In this study, we found that miR-26a was an antiviral factor that was induced through the cGAS pathway. Additionally, the host can detect FHV-1 entry through the cGAS pathway and then upregulates miR-26a to inhibit viral replication. This study is the first to report that cGAS mediates induction of miR-26a in herpesvirus infection. However, further exploration is required to investigate the precise mechanism(s).",

Thirty-six hours post-transfection, relative luciferase activities were tested and calculated by normalizing firefly luciferase activities to Renilla luciferase activities (FL/RL). (C) Verification of target of miR-26a via western blot. F81 cells were transfected with miR-26a mimics (80 nM) or inhibitors (160 nM). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were lysed for western blot analysis to test the expression of endogenous SOCS5. GAPDH served as an internal control. NC mimics and NC-I served as negative controls.
