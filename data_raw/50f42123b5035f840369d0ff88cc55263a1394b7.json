A wide range of risk drivers are now known to lead to and/or exacerbate the emergence and spread of infectious disease, including global trade and travel, the overuse of antibiotics, intensive agriculture, climate change, high population densities, and inadequate infrastructures, such as water treatment facilities. Where multiple risk drivers interact, the potential impact of a disease outbreak is amplified. The varying temporal and geographic frequency with which infectious disease events occur adds yet another layer of complexity to the issue. Mitigating the emergence and spread of infectious disease necessitates mapping and prioritising the interdependencies between public health and other sectors. Conversely, during an international public health emergency, significant disruption occurs not only to healthcare systems but also to a potentially wide range of sectors, including trade, tourism, energy, civil protection, transport, agriculture, and so on. At the same time, dealing with a disease outbreak may require a range of critical sectors for support. There is a need to move beyond narrow models of risk to better account for the interdependencies between health and other sectors so as to be able to better mitigate and respond to the risks posed by emerging infectious disease.",

Poor health systems, a slow international response, low public trust in government and medicine in the outbreak area, the introduction of the virus to urban settings, and social practices such as burial rites that increase the risk of contagion have created a 'perfect storm' for Ebola transmission (1) . The gravity of the Ebola outbreak is demonstrated by thousands of deaths, 1 and by the potential for further spread. The interconnected and cross-border nature of the threat has facilitated Ebola transmission in West Africa, and it has also led to cases appearing in both the United States and continental Europe.",

This has long been the case; human interactions with animal hosts have led to infectious disease outbreaks dating at least as far back as the Justinian Plague (541\u00c1542 AD), while global trade and travel have facilitated disease transmission, from the plague in the 14th century, smallpox in the 16th century, to SARS or a novel influenza virus in the 21st century (2\u00c14). Indeed, it is often noted that in today's interconnected world, a disease can spread nearly anywhere on Earth within 24 hours. But infectious disease risks are not simply a by-product of globalisation. As Ebola demonstrates, a great many factors, some not restricted to the disease control or public health arena, can influence the spread of infectious disease. Assessing disease-related health risks thus necessitates understanding where they might arise and how successful it might be in transmitting. The largest risks tend to occur when novel diseases appear, when familiar diseases appear in novel geographic locations, or when preventative disease control measures break down, whether due to socioeconomic inequalities, lack of resources, accident, or conflict.",

'Infectious disease drivers and interconnected risk' section will discuss the types of factors that can influence the spread of infectious disease. 'Examples of interconnections and interdependencies in recent infectious disease events' section will provide some examples of recent infectious disease incidents that have been created by the interconnectedness of factors introduced in the 'Infectious disease drivers and interconnected risk' section. These examples are primarily focused on the European Union (EU), the area in which the authors are based, but the global linkages have been emphasised. 'Analysing interconnected and interdependent infectious disease risks' section will discuss some of the integrated risk modelling approaches that have been developed in an attempt to monitor and even predict infectious disease transmission, and the 'Conclusion' section will summarise this paper by reiterating the need for and importance of recognising the interconnected and interdependent nature of infectious disease risks.",

In health, the concept of interconnected risk helps draw attention to the fact that factors traditionally viewed of as 'external' to health can nonetheless drive health risks. Emerging infectious diseases, for example, can easily be viewed as interconnected because they are affected by a wide range of ecological, political, and socioeconomic 'drivers' (6\u00c18). They can also be viewed as interdependent because of their transboundary nature, and because risks from other sectors can interact synergistically or antagonistically. In short, the emergence of an infectious disease risk can amplify and be amplified by risks from other sectors. These could include employee absenteeism and workforce shortages, potential social discord, or severe disruptions in energy, healthcare delivery, transportation, or other critical sectors (9, 10) .",

Climate change involves mean temperature increases in many parts of the world, as well as increased likelihood of adverse or even extreme weather events (11\u00c113). Many infectious diseases are temperature sensitive as many vectors and pathogens are dependent upon permissive ambient conditions. There is thus a substantial body of research that collectively demonstrates that warming will increase the transmission of vector-borne diseases in the geographic ranges of their distribution (14\u00c118). Changing temperature and precipitation patterns can affect the habitats and population growth of cold-blooded disease vectors, such as mosquitoes and ticks, as well as the replication rates of infectious diseases within their hosts, and even the rates at which disease-carrying vectors bite humans (18\u00c120).",

Many modelling studies project significant shifts in the transmission of vector-borne diseases such as malaria (23, 24) , dengue (25) , and Chikungunya (26) under climate change scenarios, but it is important to note that the extent of observed changes will depend on the presence or absence of mitigating measures, such as vector control or socioeconomic development (27, 28) .

For example, one consequence of urban sprawl and deforestation is that wildlife may increasingly need to find new habitats in urban or abandoned environments, which could lead to increased human exposures to infectious pathogens.

Although the correlation between healthcare system financing and efficacy is not perfect, recent budget cuts to healthcare are an important consideration when anticipating infectious disease risk. In part related to the global economic crisis, it has been reported that many high-income governments have introduced policies to lower spending through cutting the prices of medical products and, for example, through budget restrictions and wage cuts in hospitals (54) . There are many indirect and direct pathways through which budget cuts could affect disease transmission; to provide just one example, it has been estimated that 20\u00c130% of healthcare-associated infections are preventable with intensive hygiene and control programmes 2 \u00c1 should investments in this area diminish, then healthcare-acquired infections could become an even more problematic issue. There are currently roughly 4.1 million healthcare-associated infections each year in the EU alone. 3 A broader issue related to healthcare provision is population mobility for both healthcare professionals and patients who might increasingly seek work or healthcare in other countries \u00c1 the provision of cross-border healthcare and the mitigation of cross-border health threats will necessitate collaboration across borders (55, 56) and solutions for the brain-drain of medical personnel from resource-poor countries (57) . Also related to the healthcare provision and practice is the over-prescription or overuse of antibiotics. In combination with a lag in pharmaceutical innovation, rapid transmission, and poor infection control measures, this has driven resistance of organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and carbapenemase-producing gram-negatives such as Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) (58) . Antimicrobial resistance is currently one of the major health risks facing society (59) .",

A vast range of familiar human pathogens can be acquired through the consumption of animal products and other disease drivers, such as global travel, further provoke this (61) . In addition to farmed animals, the hunting and slaughtering of wild animals has led to the emergence of more exotic pathogens: SARS originated in wildlife markets and restaurants in southern China (62) and HIV and Ebola have both been linked to the hunting or slaughtering of primates and other wild animals (33, 63, 64) . The density and health of livestock, meanwhile, have been linked to disease in humans (65, 66) . Although inconclusive, there is some evidence to suggest that livestock production may lead to increased antibiotic resistance in human pathogens.

Literally, hundreds of examples from around the world could have been selected. One study identified 335 events leading to an emerging infectious disease between 1940 and 2004, identifying numerous infectious disease 'hotspots' across the globe \u00c1 areas in which a disproportionately high number of disease emergencies have concentrated (35) . Western Europe is identified as one such hotspot, and as the region with which the authors of this chapter are most familiar, the examples below will be slightly biased towards Europe. Nonetheless, while highlighting the interconnections between diverse disease drivers, the global interdependencies inherent to these examples will also be evident. The following examples have been selected to interrogate how different combinations of drivers have affected recent infectious disease risks.

In the wake of the global economic crisis, many health professionals across Europe anticipated adverse effects in relation to infectious disease incidence and control (92) . An observed rapid increase in reported HIV cases among PWID in both Greece and Romania was thought to be linked to the economic crisis (48) . In Greece, for example, HIV incidence among PWID increased by 1600% in 2011 (47) . From an epidemiologic standpoint, it is difficult to causally link the economic crisis with an upsurge in HIV in a particular subpopulation. Nonetheless, there are potential causal factors worth noticing. Yearly change in the Greek GDP has been found to be inversely associated with HIV case reports, homelessness, unemployment among PWID, and HIV prevalence among drug injectors seeking drug treatment in Athens (47) . Meanwhile, causal pathways have been hypothesised to include the following factors: the economic recession increased income disparities, leading to increased homelessness; this contributed to increased injecting network sizes among PWID, which were then exposed to new introductions of HIV from migrant communities, themselves subject to difficult socioeconomic circumstances in their home countries (47) . Transmission risk was intensified by low levels of available injecting equipment and other prevention services (47) . Although difficult to demonstrate the causal linkages, this scenario suggests 5 http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm. aspx?List08db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&ID0940&Root Folder0/en/press/news, accessed January 12, 2014. that the economic crisis, which originated in the financial sector, may have contributed to a large upswing of HIV in a vulnerable population, making conditions among PWID even more tenuous and, simultaneously, leading to fewer resources dedicated to harm prevention.",

            "text": "Birds are a natural reservoir for influenza viruses, and A virus subtypes H5, H7 and H9 have all led to outbreaks in human populations (94) . In recent years, the most significant outbreaks have been related to H5N1 and H7N9. Although a limited number of human cases infected with influenza A(H5N1) has been reported, the high case fatality and its potential ability to adapt to human hosts have raised concern at the global level (95) . More recently, in the spring of 2013, 145 people in China were infected by the avian influenza strain A(H7N9), leading to 45 deaths (96) . The virus was detected in poultry but also in the environment. The closure of live poultry markets in April 2013 did lead to a dramatic drop in the number of cases (97) although sporadic cases have been reported through the end of 2013. 7 A broad combination of factors can trigger and sometimes amplify avian influenza outbreaks (98, 99) . Ecological and environmental factors play a key role. Population density of both human and animals \u00c1 as well as the proximity between them \u00c1 are known risk factors for avian influenza infections in humans. Live bird markets and human consumption patterns of poultry and other avian species are also known to contribute to the risk of both influenza emergence as well as infection (100) . Seasonality is another influencing factor, although different hypotheses exist as to why winter seasons are traditionally driving influenza transmission (101) . Bird migratory patterns, particularly where migratory birds might interact with livestock poultry, create potential pathways for introduction of the virus into new regions. Air travel can quickly lead to the rapid global spread of influenza (3) . Meanwhile, the level of available public health measures, from mole-cular surveillance to rapid vaccine production, are important determinants of the impact that any given influenza outbreak might have (102) . Significantly, different avian influenza strains have different characteristics, further challenging the public health response. For example, influenza A(H5N1) is highly pathogenic in birds, leading to natural sentinel surveillance systems, while influenza A(H7N) may circulate among healthy birds, thereby remaining undetected (103) .",

In Pakistan, two workers associated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and its polio vaccination campaign were shot dead in July, 2012 (107) , and it has since been reported that 31 people associated with polio campaigns were killed in the country between July 2012 and December 2013; reportedly, polio workers have been targeted for killing with terrorist intentions. 8 Vaccination campaigns in Pakistan have been further hindered by public mistrust (107), a situation that likely further deteriorated after it was revealed that one doctor had run a fake vaccination campaign as part of a collaboration with the US Central Intelligence Agency efforts to find Osama bin Laden (108, 109) . Pakistan had reported 85 polio cases in 2013, up from 55 in 2012. 9 Assuming that roughly 7 http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm. aspx?List08db7286c%2Dfe2d%2D476c%2D9133%2D18ff4cb1b568 &ID0930&RootFolder0%2Fen%2Fpress%2Fnews%2FLists%2FNews &Source0http%3A%2F%2Fecdc%2Eeuropa%2Eeu%2Fen%2Fhealth topics%2Favian%5Finfluenza%2FPages%2Findex%2Easpx&Web0 86661a14%2Dfb61%2D43e0%2D9663%2D0d514841605d, accessed January 10, 2014. 95% of polio infections are asymptomatic and another 4.5% have mild or non-paralytic symptoms, 10 this means that at least a few thousand additional people could be currently carrying and transmitting the virus in the country. Meanwhile, polio eradication programmes have pushed back their target completion dates, and it is has been reported that 350,000 children in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas have not received polio vaccinations since mid-2012. 11 Spill-over into neighbouring countries is one consequence of halted polio eradication. It appears that an introduction of polio from Pakistan into the broader region led to viral circulation in Israel, Egypt and, potentially, Syria (110) . In Israel, circulation of the poliovirus occurred despite an estimated vaccination coverage of greater than 95% of the general population (110, 111) . In Syria, 17 laboratory-confirmed cases were identified in 2013, implying widespread circulation of poliovirus (111) .",
