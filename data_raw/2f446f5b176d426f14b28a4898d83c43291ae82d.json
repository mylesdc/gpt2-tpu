Various vaccination strategies against toxoplasmosis in rodent models have been used in the past few decades; however, effective vaccines remain a challenge. A recombinant adenovirus vaccine expressing ubiquitin-conjugated multi-stage antigen segments (Ad-UMAS) derived from different life-cycle stages of T. gondii was constructed previously. Here, we compared the immune responses and protection effects in vaccination of mice with Ad-UMAS by five vaccination routes including intramuscular (i.m.), intravenous (i.v.), subcutaneous (s.c.), intraoral (i.o.), and intranasal (i.n.). Much higher levels of T. gondii-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were detected in the sera of the intraoral and intranasal vaccination groups on day 49 compared with controls (p < 0.05). The percentages of CD8 + T-cells in mice immunized intranasally and intraorally were larger than in mice immunized intramuscularly (p < 0.05). The highest level of IL-2 and IFN-c was detected in the group with nasal immunization, and splenocyte proliferation activity was significantly enhanced in mice immunized via the oral and nasal routes. Furthermore, the higher survival rate (50%) and lower cyst numbers observed in the intraoral and intranasal groups all indicate that Ad-UMAS is far more effective in protecting mice against T. gondii infection via the mucosal route. Ad-UMAS could be an effective and safe mucosal candidate vaccine to protect animals and humans against T. gondii infection.",

Current research on T. gondii vaccines only focuses on antigens expressed in the tachyzoite stage, which only induce partial protective immunity [20, 28, 38, 44] . The development of a variety of epitope combinations from different stages of the life cycle, including tachyzoites, bradyzoites (in tissue cysts), and sporozoites (in oocysts), are likely to induce full protection [2, 3, 4, 43] . With the development of bioinformatics, epitope vaccines are considered a novel immunization approach to prevent T. gondii infection.

Recent studies have also found that recombinant canine adenovirus type-2 expressing TgROP16 and TgROP18 provides partial protection against acute T. gondii infection in mice, and indicate that adenovirus vectors may be potentially useful in the development of an effective vaccine against T. gondii infection [21, 22] . The mucosal immune system consisting of specialized epithelial cells can trigger both humoral and cell immune responses when antigens are administered with appropriate adjuvants or attenuated live vaccines via mucosal routes (oral, nasal, sublingual, ocular, genital, or rectal) [18, 23] . Furthermore, local mucosal immunization can lead to antigen-specific T-and B-cell responses not only in mucosal sites but also systemically [5, 24] . Hence, there is a greater need for effective vaccines that exert protective effects at mucosal surfaces, especially for intracellular parasites such as T. gondii.",

The survival rates of mice immunized via different routes are shown in Figure 3 . The mice immunized with Ad-UMAS via i.m., i.o., and i.n. showed an almost 50% survival rate and lower survival rates of 40% were found in the i.v. and s.c. immunization groups 28 days after challenge. All the control mice died within 8 days. The level of protective effect against chronic infection was evaluated by counting cysts in the brains of mice challenged with 20 cysts of the PRU strain of T. gondii (Fig. 3 ). An obvious reduction in the burden of brain cyst was detected in all the immunized mice compared with the control mice (p < 0.05). The brain cyst numbers in the oral and nasal immunization groups were significantly reduced to 459 \u00b1 34 and 398 \u00b1 61, respectively, which is much lower than the other immunization groups with injection in muscle (569 \u00b1 23), via the venous route (892 \u00b1 51), and via the subcutaneous route (675 \u00b1 65) (p < 0.05).",

Mucosal vaccines are advantageous compared with systemic vaccines from a production and regulatory perspective [18, 23] . Previous studies have revealed that a Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) vaccine greatly enhances local mucosal immune responses in immunized BALB/c mice with the intranasal inoculation method [24] . Ideal attenuated vaccines could be engineered to have a limited capacity for replication and to deliver an effective antigen, while avoiding unwanted inflammatory responses [35, 39, 41] . Recombinant adenoviruses are some of the most intensively investigated vaccine carriers in many pathogenic infections, such as Ebola virus, HIV, and the malaria parasite [1, 11, 16, 32] .

CD8 + T-cells can control the spreading and development of T. gondii infection in synergy with CD4 + T-cells [12] . In our study, CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocyte subsets from immunized mice were assayed by flow cytometry. There was a marked increase in the percentage of CD8 + T-cells in mice immunized with the Ad-UMAS vaccine via mucosal routes. Cytokines play a critical role in the activities of Th cells. As we know, Th1 cells are responsible for limiting tissue extension of the parasite through the production of IL-2 and IFN-c [15] . Our results show that in contrast with the blank control, high levels of IL-2 and IFN-c were induced in mice immunization with Ad-UMAS especially treated intraorally and intranasally. However, there is no difference in IL-10 production between vaccinated and control groups. Additionally, splenocyte proliferation activity was significantly enhanced in mice immunized via oral and nasal routes. These results clearly suggest that mucosal vaccination with Ad-UMAS can significantly augment Th1-mediated cellular immune responses in which CD8 + T lymphocytes are considered as major effectors responsible for controlling parasite infection and secreting IFN-c during the cellular response against toxoplasmosis.",

The PRU strain is more likely to induce chronic infection in mice following intragastric administration with cysts [36] . In order to simulate acute and chronic infection in the host, mice were infected with the RH strain and PRU strain by different challenge routes. When challenged with lethal doses of T. gondii (1 \u00b7 10 3 ), all five groups immunized with Ad-UMAS had a prolonged survival time as compared with control mice. In particular, mice immunized intranasally and intraorally showed higher survival rates than with the other immunization routes. Since protection via vaccination was not 100% because the strain of the parasite has high mortality and the dose of RH parasites for immunized mice was larger, the optimal challenge dose should be determined in the future. Furthermore, the higher mucosal immune responses that were induced by intraoral and intranasal vaccination of Ad-UMAS may explain the significant reduction in the cyst burden in the mice immunized with Ad-UMAS intraorally and intranasally, which exhibited reductions of 75.3% and 78.6% of brain cysts, respectively.",
