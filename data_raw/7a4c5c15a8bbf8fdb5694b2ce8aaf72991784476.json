Case-study reports on 2002-2004 SARS outbreaks have discussed the role of quarantine in the community in transmission.

Secondary Case Count Difference (SCCD) reflects reduction in the average number of transmissions arising from a SARS case in quarantine, relative to not in quarantine, at onset of symptoms. SCCD was estimated using Poisson and negative binomial regression models (with identity link function) comparing the number of secondary cases to each index case for quarantine relative to non-quarantined index cases. The inverse of this statistic is proposed as the number needed to quarantine (NNQ) to prevent one additional secondary transmission.",

The study of quarantine effectiveness presents several methodological and statistical challenges. Further research and discussion are needed to understand the costs and benefits of enacting quarantine, and this includes a discussion of how quantitative benefit should be communicated to decision-makers and the public, and evaluated.",

Quarantine is the segregation of healthy persons exposed to an infectious disease from unexposed persons, until the exposed person becomes ill or the incubation period has passed [2, 5] . Quarantine is also one of the most controversial measures available in outbreak control, with important impacts on economic activity and civil liberties [6, 7] . Public health agencies need to have weighed evidence of the potential costs and benefits of these manoeuvres before the next outbreak of a severe, novel infection [8, 9] and to have publicly and widely communicated the importance of planned control measures [6, 10] . This makes outcome evaluation of modern quarantine activity an important area for research [2, 4, 6] .",

Statistical estimates used in health decision-making tend to derive from differences in outcome rates in treated versus non-treated individuals (e.g., risk difference, RD; attributable risk, AR and population attributable risk, PAR) [12, 13, 15] , as well as variations on the number needed to treat (NNT) statistic [11, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Research to evaluate the impact of modern quarantine is less well-developed, and no clear tradition has emerged in the measures of association used to communicate net harm and benefit. The quantitative impact of control measures for infectious diseases is commonly assessed using variants of the effective reproductive number, R (the average observed number of secondary infections per index cases in an observed population). R t the daily effective reproductive number, is the observed number of secondary cases to index case at a specific time. When R t, has a value below1.0, this is evidence that an outbreak is dying out [21] .",

Community contacts were classified by closest level of exposure to the index case (e.g., level 1 being closest at \u226530 minutes within a distance of one metre [23] ). For all community contacts, outcome status as a secondary SARS case was defined [23] .

This, seemingly intuitive, analysis treats the individuals in whom the outcome is measured as though they were assigned to treatment conditions. Therefore, information regarding quarantine status is used only from the 204 SARS index cases with one or more community contacts. In place of typical logistic regression which would yield an odds ratio (OR), we obtained risk difference (na\u00efve secondary attack rate difference -ignoring index cases with no contacts) as the measure of association, using a generalized linear regression model with binomial error term and identity link function.

The SSCR is a function of the ratio of secondary cases per quarantined index case (SC q ) and of the ratio of secondary cases per non-quarantined index case (SC nq ) as discussed below.

IRR is equal to the exponent of the beta coefficient for the regression term of interest [26, 27] . For Poisson models used here, no offset was specified for the number of community contacts at risk for each index case. Said differently, the outcome variable here is not the rate of secondary transmission among a variable number of potentially exposed community contacts per index case, but the number of secondary SARS cases arising from an index case. The SCCR is the exponentiated beta term for this model (where quarantine status was entered as a binary variable).

The average difference in secondary SARS cases in moving from non-quarantine to quarantine status is estimated at 0.133 secondary cases per index case. The final estimate in Table  2 is NNQ suggesting 7.51 SARS index cases be placed under quarantine to reduce the number of secondary cases by one. When variance estimates and confidence intervals are estimated using a large-sample assumption (asymptotic variance) all Poisson regression models presented were statistically significant. When negative binomial regression was used to estimate SCCR, this became non-significant (p = 0.057). When using bootstrap variance methods, confidence intervals for all estimates became very wide and none of these estimates were significantly different from the null value. Table 3 presents supplemental analyses of the degree to which the effect of quarantine is explained by reduction in the number of contacts. Adjustment of the effect of quarantine only for the total number of contacts had little impact on the point estimate for SCCR (0.35245 versus 0.31598; data not shown), nor its significance (when compared to Table 2 ). However, when quarantine status was also adjusted (see Table 3 ) for the number of close contacts (level 1; see Table 1 ), the SCCR attributable to quarantine was reduced by 3.6% and it's asymptotic level of significance went from p = 0.026 to p = 0.046.

A review of simulation studies on quarantine effectiveness for SARS has been presented by Bauch and colleagues [9] . This review, and other individual reports [43] suggest that quarantine measures are most effective when mobilized at the very start of the outbreak when numbers are small. While decision-makers must rely heavily on simulation studies, a persistent concern raised [33] is that results are driven by prior assumptions; which may be unrealistic. Simulations rely on some degree of simplification such as considering only point-source outbreaks in non-overlapping populations. More sophisticated models incorporate heterogeneity in parameters including variations in size and behaviour of human contact networks, differences in transmissibility due to the host, and levels of adherence with control measures, such that scenarios simulated reflect what happens in real-world experiences [4, 33, 44, 45] . Simulation studies, typically, do not present impact statistics familiar to health policy makers, and may not provide evidence as compelling to decision-makers as real world outbreak experiences. To give an example, a recent World Health Organization review on control measures for influenza cited no simulation studies but only real-world observational data [46] .",

Some of these reports appeared well after the outbreak, with efforts made to complete data on onset dates and transmission in hindsight (e.g., [42] ). Drawing inference from epidemic curves suits only point-source outbreaks, and amount to one-group, pre-test post-test designs [47] , providing weak evidence for causation.

For discussion purposes, we present several effect measures, including Secondary Case Count Difference (SCCD) and \"number needed to quarantine\" (NNQ), a novel adaptation of NNT. Our point estimate of NNQ for the Ontario outbreak was 7.5 persons in quarantine to one SARS case averted using data from probable or suspected SARS cases. As a point estimate, this NNQ compares very favourably with NNTs reported for public health interventions such as chemoprophylaxis for leprosy [50] and meningococcal disease [51] , or vaccination against pertussis [52] and influenza and pneumococcal disease [53] , particularly with a condition like SARS with significant morbidity and a high casefatality rate. All estimates we present for the impact of quarantine, however, are imprecise. Bootstrapped confidence intervals include values for no impact. Statistical power is a limitation to this and many analyses of real outbreak data.",

Interventions such as vaccination are more complex in that outcomes may be assessed at the individual or population level, with different implications, although the individual vaccinated is part of the same population. Number Needed to Vaccinate (NNV) has been estimated incorporating herd immunity [52] . The case of quarantine is distinct even from vaccination, in that all potential benefit is to other persons. It is theoretically possible to study sets of index cases and their contacts as independent units of analysis, although it is often difficult to identify precisely which persons exposed which others [43] . Here, we have worked with contacts matched to an exclusive index case [23] . The creation of sets of cases and associated controls goes only part-way toward a complete network-based analysis [33] , although future studies could address non-independence of networks.",

Within Public Health records, we were able to confirm 140 quarantined false positive \"cases\". These cases were quarantined contacts who became ill with possible SARS symptoms but were subsequently excluded as SARS cases, and they had at least one identified community contact. Future cost-benefit studies should include information on such groups (e.g., [36] ). Legitimate costs are incurred for and by these false positive cases and their contacts which should be taken into account. Because people without the disease can't spread it, uneven distribution of such individuals across infection control conditions being compared could bias estimates of impact. As we found, the rate of false positive cases (resulting in no transmission) may have a large influence on the apparent benefit. Several case-reports discussed problems with prospective record-keeping, in terms of detailed contact tracing and the implications of time-lags in serological testing (including those never tested), as challenges to both outbreak management and research [4, 35, 41] .",

However, the applicability of this evidence to the current experience with pandemic influ-enza is less certain. Ferguson et al [58] present simulation data suggesting community quarantine and isolation may play a role in influenza control but comment that this would presume such measures were feasible. Transmission patterns for influenza however, make it less likely that contact tracing and quarantine would be fast enough to avoid transmission which is greatest in the earliest stage of infection [46] . Under such circumstances, use of a 'severe' [57] measure such as quarantine is likely not justified where such efforts are likely to yield little benefit.",
