            "text": "Helicobacter pylori causes cellular vacuolation in host cells, a cytotoxic event attributed to vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) and the presence of permeant weak bases such as ammonia. We report here the role of \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), a constitutively expressed secretory enzyme of H. pylori, in potentiating VacA-dependent vacuolation formation in H. pylori-infected AGS and primary gastric cells. The enhancement is brought about by GGT hydrolysing glutamine present in the extracellular medium, thereby releasing ammonia which accentuates the VacA-induced vacuolation. The events of vacuolation in H. pylori wild type (WT)-and \u0394ggt-infected AGS cells were first captured and visualized by real-time phase-contrast microscopy where WT was observed to induce more vacuoles than \u0394ggt. By using semi-quantitative neutral red uptake assay, we next showed that \u0394ggt induced significantly less vacuolation in AGS and primary gastric epithelial cells as compared to the parental strain (P<0.05) indicating that GGT potentiates the vacuolating effect of VacA. Notably, vacuolation induced by WT was significantly reduced in the absence of GGT substrate, glutamine (P<0.05) or in the presence of a competitive GGT inhibitor, serine-borate complex. Furthermore, the vacuolating ability of \u0394ggt was markedly restored when co-incubated with purified recombinant GGT (rGGT), although rGGT itself did not induce vacuolation independently. Similarly, the addition of exogenous ammonium chloride as a source of ammonia also rescued the ability of \u0394ggt to induce vacuolation. Additionally, we also show that monoclonal antibodies against GGT effectively inhibited GGT activity and successfully suppressed H. pylori-induced vacuolation. Collectively, our results clearly demonstrate that generation of ammonia by GGT through glutamine hydrolysis is responsible for enhancing VacA-dependent vacuolation. Our findings provide a new perspective on GGT as an important virulence factor and a promising target in the management of H. pylori-associated gastric diseases.",

GGT has been implicated in various host cell damaging effects including induction of apoptosis [6] , upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 in human gastric cells [7] , inhibiting T cell proliferation [8] and generating H 2 O 2 leading to DNA damage [9] . The enzyme is first synthesized as a pro-enzyme (~60 kDa) before being subsequently processed to give a large (~37 kDa) and a small (~20 kDa) subunit. The large and small subunits then associate to form the active enzyme [4] . Biochemically, GGT catalyzes reactions in which a \u03b3-glutamyl moiety is transferred from \u03b3-glutamyl compounds, such as glutathione, to amino acids (transpeptidation) or water (hydrolysis).",

            "text": "One of the virulence processes of H. pylori is that it causes cytoplasmic vacuole formation in cells in vitro [10] and in vivo [11] . The process has been attributed to a well-studied secreted virulence factor, vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) and the phenomenon is dependent on the presence of permeant weak bases such as ammonia [12] in the extracellular medium. A current model of the vacuolation process involves VacA being internalized into the endosomal compartment by endocytosis [13] and altering V-ATPase activity [14] , thereby leading to an increased influx of H + into the endosome. This then leads to an accumulation of ammonium ions and subsequent water influx into the endosomal lumen, giving rise to the osmotic swelling of late endosomes which results in the formation of massive vacuoles, both in number and size [15] . A major source of ammonia required for vacuolation is reported to come from the hydrolysis of urea by urease [16, 17] . Akin to urease, GGT is also known to generate ammonia by hydrolyzing glutamine [18, 19] , an amino acid that is abundant in plasma [20] . Hence, it was of great interest to investigate if GGT also contributes to the vacuolation process.",

There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in neutral red dye uptake between rGGTtreated and untreated cells after 24 hours (Fig 3A) , implying that rGGT does not possess intrinsic vacuolating activity. This was confirmed when both \u0394vacA and \u0394vacA/ggt induced minimal levels of neutral red uptake. Interestingly, when rGGT was supplemented into \u0394ggt-treated AGS culture for 24 hours, vacuolation was restored to almost a similar level as that induced by WT (P<0.05), an effect not seen when rGGT was supplemented to \u0394vacAor \u0394vacA/ggtinfected cells. The results indicate that GGT is indeed unable to induce vacuolation in the absence of VacA but is involved in exacerbating its effect. It was therefore not surprising that the co-incubation of WT and rGGT also significantly increased the extent of vacuolation compared to that induced by WT alone (P<0.05), reiterating the potentiating effect of GGT on VacA in vacuolation (Fig 3A) .",

A maximum concentration of 3mM ammonium chloride was chosen as higher concentrations of ammonium chloride (! 5mM) have been found to induce vacuolation independently of VacA [12] . Interestingly, exogenous addition of ammonium chloride restored vacuolation induced by \u0394ggt in a dosedependent manner and was fully restored to the level of that induced by the parental strain in the presence of 3mM ammonium chloride (Fig 3C) . In contrast, neutral red uptake by uninfected cells or AGS co-cultured with \u0394vacA did not show significant difference in neutral red uptake, confirming that 3mM ammonium chloride does not induce vacuolation intrinsically. These results suggest that the absence of GGT in \u0394ggt affects its ability in inducing vacuolation in AGS cells due to a decrease in ammonia production by the isogenic mutant. This hypothesis was further strengthened by measuring the concentration of ammonia in the cell culture medium of WT and \u0394ggt-infected AGS cells (Fig 3D) . The results show that concentration of ammonia in the cell culture medium of AGS cells infected with WT was significantly higher than \u0394ggt in the presence of 2mM glutamine (P<0.05). In contrast, no significant differences were observed between them in glutamine-free media.",

As a control, mouse IgG 2a and IgG 2b isotype negative controls failed to inhibit vacuolation. Similarly, in the presence of SBC, a competitive GGT inhibitor [28] , vacuolation induction by WT in AGS cells was significantly decreased (P<0.05) while the level of vacuolation remained unchanged in \u0394ggt-treated cells (Fig 6B) . The effect of SBC in inhibiting vacuolation was also observed to be dose-dependent but required a minimum concentration of 8mM SBC to be effective.

This agrees with a previous report whereby vacuolation induced in Sfl Ep cells by broth-culture filtrates from a urease-isogenic mutant did not differ significantly to that induced by the parental strain in the absence of urea [32] . In the same report, it was also found that a large portion of ammonia in the broth filtrates was a urease-independent metabolic product of the bacteria, indicating that there are other bacterial factors responsible for the production of ammonia essential for vacuolation induction. In this study, we show that neutral red uptake induced by \u0394ggt was significantly lesser than that induced by \u0394ureAB (where GGT is still present), emphasizing that GGT is the other important ammonia-generating factor alongside urease under the tested culture conditions.

However, it is noted that the extent of vacuolation in vivo may not be as prominent as that observed in vitro which may be due to several factors such as differences in concentrations of VacA in vivo and in the detectability of it in epithelial cells contained within an intact mucosal surface as opposed to flattened, adherent cells of a monolayer [39] .",

            "text": "In conclusion, this work has revealed another important role of GGT, particularly in accentuating VacA-dependent vacuolation. This is a novel pathogenic effect of GGT which has hitherto not been reported and hence could be another reason as to why H. pylori with higher GGT activity is associated with more severe gastroduodenal diseases as was previously reported [9] . The fact that ggt gene is present in all H. pylori isolates [4, 5, 9] further illustrates the vital role of this enzyme in potentiating virulence. Intriguingly, it has been reported that other VacA activities such as induction of apoptosis and epithelial permeability can be potentiated by ammonia [17, 40] , thus raising the possibility that these activities may also be potentiated by GGTproduced ammonia and would certainly be an interesting area to explore. Taken together, our findings provide a new perspective on GGT as a potent virulence factor and a potential target in the management of H. pylori-associated infections. The cells were subjected to neutral red uptake assay. Uninfected cells (UN) served as control.",
