However, high-level expression and purification of recombinant FGF21 (rFGF21) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is difficult because rFGF21 forms inclusion bodies in the bacteria making it difficult to purify and obtain high concentrations of bioactive rFGF21. To overcome this problem, we fused the FGF21 with SUMO (Small ubiquitin-related modifier) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and expressed the fused gene in E. coli BL21(DE3). Results: By inducing with IPTG, SUMO-FGF21 was expressed at a high level. Its concentration reached 30% of total protein, and exceeded 95% of all soluble proteins. The fused protein was purified by DEAE sepharose FF and Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Once cleaved by the SUMO protease, the purity of rFGF21 by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was shown to be higher than 96% with low endotoxin level (<1.0 EU/ml). The results of in vivo animal experiments showed that rFGF21 produced by using this method, could decrease the concentration of plasma glucose in diabetic rats by streptozotocin (STZ) injection.",

FGF21 is induced and secreted from the liver upon fasting and acts on adipose tissues to induce metabolic adaptation to fasting [3, 4] . Specifically, FGF21 stimulates lipolysis in adipocytes, a process which releases fatty acids into the bloodstream; when they reach the liver, these fatty acids are converted to ketones [3] . FGF21 is free of the proliferative and tumorigenic effects [5] [6] [7] that are documented for other members of the FGF family [3, 8, 9] . Systemic administration of FGF21 reduced plasma glucose, fructosamine, triglycerides, insulin, and glucagon in diabetic rhesus monkeys [10] . FGF21 administration led to significant improvements in lipoprotein profiles, by lowering lowdensity cholesterol and by raising high-density cholesterol, as well as causing weight loss in the animals [10] .",

Likewise, P5, P6, P7, and P8, were reacted to form fragment B; primers P9, P10, P11, and P12 formed fragment C, primers P11, P12, P13, and P14 formed fragment D. Using A and B as the common template, and P1 and P8 as the forward and reverse primers, the reaction was denatured at 94\u00b0C for 5 min. This was followed by 30 consecutive cycles of denaturation: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s at 55\u00b0C, extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and then a final single extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min to get the fragment M. Fragments C and D were used to create fragment N. Finally, Fragments M and N were used to form the FGF21 fragment, according to the previously described procedure.",
