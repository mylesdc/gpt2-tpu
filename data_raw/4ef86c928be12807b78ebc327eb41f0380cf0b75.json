Isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods offer significant advantages over the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), since they are more rapid and do not require the sophisticated instruments needed for thermal cycling. We previously described a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, 'Strand Invasion Based Amplification' (SIBA\u00ae), with high analytical sensitivity and specificity, for the detection of DNA. In this study, we describe the development of a variant of the SIBA method, namely, reverse transcription SIBA (RT-SIBA), for the rapid detection of viral RNA targets. The RT-SIBA method includes a reverse transcriptase enzyme that allows one-step reverse transcription of RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) and simultaneous amplification and detection of the cDNA by SIBA under isothermal reaction conditions. The RT-SIBA method was found to be more sensitive than PCR for the detection of influenza A and B and could detect 100 copies of influenza RNA within 15 min. The development of RT-SIBA will enable rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral RNA targets within point-of-care or central laboratory settings.",

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays have been developed for the diagnosis of influenza and remain the most common platform used in NAAT. The RT-PCR method includes, as a first incubation step, the reverse transcription of RNA to complementary DNA (cDNA) by a transcriptase enzyme, followed by a PCR cycling stage. A RT-PCR run is typically completed within 2 h. Most reverse transcriptases are not thermostable; consequently, the reverse transcription step must be performed prior to the PCR step (Gerard et al. 2002) .

The IO, used in SIBA reactions to separate the target duplex DNA, includes a 5\u2032 region that is not homologous to the target sequence. This nonhomologous region, termed the seeding region, is included in the IO to allow for optimal coating of the homologous portion by the recombinase. The affinity of the recombinase for DNA molecules was previously suggested to be dependent on both the length and nucleotide composition of the target molecule (Formosa and Alberts 1986) . Therefore, we hypothesized that the length and composition of the seeding region could also impact the speed of SIBA assays. In order to test our hypothesis, SIBA influenza A assay IOs containing seeding regions that differed in length and nucleotide composition were designed and tested, and the results are depicted in Fig. 3 . The use of an Influenza A assay IO with no seeding region resulted in reactions with the longest detection time, suggesting that the seeding region is of vital importance for efficient amplification of the target DNA. Furthermore, shorter detection times were observed as the length of the seeding region increased. Our experiments demonstrate that the optimal length of the seeding region, in terms of assay speed, is a minimum of six nucleotides. To evaluate the impact of the nucleotide composition of the seeding region on assay speed, seven IOs with seeding regions containing either polyC, polyT, polyA, polyG, poly purines, poly pyrimidines, or mixed nucleotides were tested. The use of IO seeding regions containing polyC and polyT resulted in the shortest detection times, while the use of an IO containing a polyG seeding region led to the longest detection time. The IO containing a seeding region with a mixture of pyrimidine nucleotides was found to display shorter detection times than that with a mixture of purine nucleotides. In Fig. 2 a Mechanistic description of the RT-SIBA reaction. 1 RNA is reverse transcribed to cDNA by the transcriptase enzyme. 2 The SIBA reaction requires two targetspecific primers and an invasion oligonucleotide (IO). All singlestranded elements are coated with gp32. 3 T4 UvsX recombinase polymerizes the IO displacing bound gp32. The lengths of the primers used are too short to act as substrates for UvsX. 4 IO invades the complementary region of the target duplex through the activity of UvsX. The invasion process facilitates the complete separation of the target duplex, allowing target-specific primers to bind the target. 5 The strand displacement polymerase is able to extend the dissociated target duplex from the primers. This event leads to the production of two copies of the target duplex. The recombinasemediated target duplex separation and polymerase-mediated extension are the basis for exponential amplification conclusion, IOs for both influenza A and B assays used in the following experiments were designed to contain seeding regions consisting of a polyC sequence of 10 and 14 nucleotides in length, respectively.",

Previously, it was demonstrated that SIBA technology is a feasible method for the reliable detection of DNA from pathogenic micro-organisms (Hoser et al. 2014) . In this paper, we demonstrate that RT-SIBA can be applied for the rapid detection of pathogens that have RNA, rather than DNA, as their genetic material, as is the case for the majority of viruses. The method described here includes a reverse transcriptase enzyme in the same reaction tubes as the other SIBA reaction components required for nucleic acid amplification and consequently permits a one-step reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA and simultaneous amplification and real-time detection of cDNA by SIBA. The SIBA method consists of a recombinase, required for homologous recombination, an IO, which is a substrate for the recombinase, and two target-specific primers that are not substrates for the recombinase. The IO separates the target duplex, with the aid of the recombinase, consequently allowing the primers to bind and extend the target via the action of a DNA polymerase. Repeated cycles of duplex separation and primer extension are the basis for exponential amplification. In this report, the amplification times for the SIBA influenza assays were first optimized by varying the length and composition of the IO non-homologous region (i.e., the seeding region). Our experiments showed that a polyC or polyT non-homologous IO region of at least ten nucleotides in length resulted in the shortest detection times. The recombinase, UvsX binds preferentially to pyrimidine rich nucleotides (Formosa and Alberts 1986) , however, the reaction demands both the binding and release of the recombinase and consequently the optimal configuration of the seeding region was determined empirically. The necessity of the seeding region demonstrated that the recombinase perform less efficiently at the initial potential binding sites prior to its polymerization from 5\u2032-3\u2032.",

Thus, the complete test can be conducted in less than 30 min. This is significantly faster than the real-time RT-PCR method, which took over 1 h for the detection of influenza. In RT-SIBA, the reverse transcription and cDNA amplification occur simultaneously and at the same reaction temperature, thus facilitating rapid detection of target RNA. By contrast, in real-time RT-PCR, reverse transcription requires an initial incubation period of 30 min at a constant temperature prior to the repeated PCR cycles of denaturation, annealing, and elongation, resulting in a total run time of 90-120 min. Furthermore, RT-SIBAwas found to be more sensitive than RT-PCR for the detection of influenza A and B.

It is possible that the presence of gp32 in the RT-SIBA reaction mixture could also contribute to the high analytical sensitivity displayed by RT-SIBA for RNA targets. This is supported by previous studies, which showed that single binding proteins enhance the yield of cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase, thus improving DNA amplification sensitivity (Jefferies and Farquharson 2002; Villalva et al. 2001) . Furthermore, the difference in RT enzymes used in RT-SIBA and RT-PCR could account for the significant difference in sensitivity between the methods.

The RT-SIBA influenza assays amplified the influenza specimens specifically, with no cross-reactions with other respiratory pathogens. Since RT-SIBA was found to be less susceptible to sample derived inhibition, the method does not require highly purified RNA template material and crude disruption of viral particles using detergents was found to be sufficient. The sensitive and rapid detection of influenza viruses within 15 min, as well as the tolerance to sample derived inhibition, demonstrate that these assays are powerful molecular diagnostics tools. Since the method is performed at a low and constant temperature, there is potential for it to be run using battery operated and portable devices of considerably lower complexity than those used for RT-PCR. Isothermal methods can reasonably be expected to extend the use of molecular methods outside of centralized laboratory spaces into lower complexity settings, such as smaller laboratories, the field, or even domestic homes.",
