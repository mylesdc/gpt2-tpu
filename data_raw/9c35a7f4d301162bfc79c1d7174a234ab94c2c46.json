Vaccine development is one of CD prevention methods to protect people at risk. Two plasmids containing genes encoding a trans-sialidase protein (TcSP) and an amastigote-specific glycoprotein (TcSSP4) were used as DNA vaccines in a canine model. Splenomegaly was not found in either of the recombinant plasmid-immunized groups; however, cardiomegaly was absent in animals immunized only with the plasmid containing the TcSSP4 gene. The inflammation of subendocardial and myocardial tissues was prevented only with the immunization with TcSSP4 gene. In conclusion, the vaccination with these genes has a partial protective effect on the enlargement of splenic and cardiac tissues during the chronic CD and on microscopic hearth damage, since both plasmids prevented splenomegaly but only one avoided cardiomegaly, and the lesions in heart tissue of dog immunized with plasmid containing the TcSSP4 gene covered only subepicardial tissue.",

It is one of the major endemic problems in Latin America and ranks as the third most important parasitic disease in the world after malaria and schistosomiasis [2] . An estimate of the number of T. cruzi infections by states in Mexico was made that indicated that the calculated number of potentially affected people is 5.5 million [3] . Several studies describing the seroprevalence in dogs of this country have been conducted and importantly demonstrated a direct correlation with the seropositivity in humans. The seroprevalence in the dog population ranges between 1.6% and 21% depending on the geographical region [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] suggesting that dogs may be domestic reservoir hosts and help to maintain human transmission of T. cruzi when dogs and humans cohabit with vector insects, creating thus a public health problem [9] .",

Prevention of T. cruzi transmission is mainly through the control of vector populations, control of blood transfusion and organ transplantation, and monitoring children from chagasic mothers. However, it is necessary to consider other alternatives, such as the development of vaccines that would be key to improve the control of CD. The development and establishment of regulatory immunization schemes have enabled controlling successfully and even eradicating many diseases worldwide. DNA vaccination represents a promising strategy to attempt to prevent many conditions associated with virulent microorganisms, including obligate and facultative intracellular parasites whose ability to reside within the host cells sustains their resistance to the host's defense mechanisms for longer periods [20] .",

No evidence of amastigotes' nests was observed in any tissue analyzed of all experimentally infected dogs. Similar microscopic changes of sections of heart tissue were found in all DNA immunized/infected and SS mock-immunized/infected groups, including inflammatory infiltrates with mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells and without parasitism in this tissue ( Figure 2 ). Lymphocytes were the predominant cell infiltrates along with a few histiocytes and neutrophils. Alterations related to heart inflammation were identified in 100% of the dogs immunized with TcSSP4 gene (pBCSSP4 plasmid), pBK-CMV, and inoculated with SS groups, whereas in the TcSP gene-(pBCSP plasmid) immunized/infected animals abnormalities were found in 71% (5/7). However, the extent of inflammation of the heart tissue during the chronic phase of infection was reduced in dogs immunized with the recombinant plasmids, as evidenced by the significant differences in the inflammatory lesion scores between subendocardial tissues from dogs immunized with recombinant plasmids and those immunized with the pBK-CMV empty cloning vector or SS mock-immunized (Table 3) , as well as between myocardial tissues from TcSSP4 gene-(pBCSSP4 plasmid) immunized/infected dogs and from all other groups (Table 3 ). In immunized/infected groups (including the mock-immunized/infected group as control for infection) with similar inflammatory lesion scores, no significant differences among themselves were found.",

In contrast, the dogs immunized with the TcSSP4 gene at the same dose and then infected exhibited a heart index similar to that of the healthy non-immunized group, and probably TcSSP4, the amastigote specific protein, encoded by the TcSSP4 gene, had a partial protective role during CCC likely because this gene induces immunity against the stagespecific surface antigen present on the intracellular form.

Immunization with the TcSSP4 gene (pBCSSP4 plasmid) had a partial protective role avoiding cardiomegaly and microscopic heart damage since the dogs of this group showed heart indices similar to those of healthy animals, and the microscopic lesions did not reach myocardial or subendocardial tissues; therefore, DNA vaccination could be an approach to reduce the severity of chronic T. cruzi infection.",
