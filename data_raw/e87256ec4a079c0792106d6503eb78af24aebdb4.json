A recent interest has grown to create antimicrobial copper touch surfaces, in order to counteract microbial spread in the healthcare environment. For the first time, five French long-term care facilities were at 50% fitted with copper alloys door handles and handrails. Related to the environmental bacterial contamination, 1400 samples were carried out on copper and control surfaces over three years after copper installation. In addition, some copper door handles were taken from the different facilities, and their specific activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was tested in vitro. In comparison to control surfaces, copper door handles and handrails revealed significantly lower contamination levels. This difference was observed in the five long-term care facilities and it persists through the three years of the study. High and extreme levels of bacterial contamination were less frequent on copper surfaces. Although, the antibacterial activity of copper surfaces against MRSA was lowered after three years of regular use, it was still significant as compared to inert control surfaces. Therefore, copper containing surfaces are promising actors in the non-spreading of environmental bacterial contamination in healthcare facilities.",

In 2012, in Europe, the HAI prevalence was around 6%, ranging from 2% to 11% for overall European countries [2] . In the healthcare environment, microorganisms can easily spread from resident to resident [3] and from resident to staff through different pathways. Direct contact between people is the most obvious factor of microbial cross-contamination. The hands of a healthcare worker can have a high risk of being contaminated following a direct skin contact with infected patient [4] [5] [6] , and hand hygiene is the first strategy for preventing healthcare-associated infections [7] .

Each facility employs its own staff and uses its own protocol for disinfection and cleaning. Those protocols have not been changed throughout the study. In each facility, half of the resident's room and corridors were fitted out with Steriall \u00ae copper alloys (Lebronze alloys, Suippes, France). Briefly, half of the original door handles of residents' room and original corridors' handrails were replaced by copper ones, the other half remained as before and was used as control surfaces. Two different copper alloys were used, one for the rooms' door handles (around 90% of copper) and one for the handrails (around 70% of copper) in every corridor adjoining copper fitted rooms. The sampling series were conducted over an 18 months period and executed with at least one week of delay between them. The number of rooms involved, surface cleaning protocol and frequency, date of the copper alloys set-up, and sequences of sampling are summarized in Table 1 . For each series, ten copper as well as ten non-copper fitted patient rooms were randomly selected and excluded from the next series of the same sequence (except in facility C were the total number of rooms was below 30). For each selected room, the samplings were performed on the external door handle (corridor side) and on the closest handrail in the corridor, at a distance of 10 centimeters from the edge of the handrail.",

Even so, the MRSA burden was significantly reduced as compared to control; there was more heterogeneity in the residual burden distribution on the copper handles.

A simple gesture such as \"holding a door handle\" can participate to a wide and fast dispersion of pathogens and favor the cross-contamination between inanimate surfaces and patients. Indeed, inanimate surfaces play an important role as a microbial beholder, despite hand-washing, which currently remains the primordial step against pathogens dissemination. To fight against microbial dissemination, new disinfection methods are being developed. Nevertheless, bacteria can still rapidly recolonize touch surfaces, especially multidrug resistant bacteria that are frequently found in healthcare facilities [13] . Given this context, the use of copper surfaces brings a new perspective for constant and inherent disinfection. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial properties of door handles and handrails containing copper that have been used on a daily base in five long-term care facilities.",

Indeed, the regular use of classic disinfectants or cleaning solutions can somehow modify the copper surface and lead to a loss of the surface antibacterial activity. Such antagonist effects between cleaning solutions and copper surfaces have already been pointed out [39, 44] . Mikolay et al. [39] observed low bacterial burden reductions by copper surface, ranging from 0% to 40%. They suggested that these values were due to the daily cleaning solution used in the hospital, proposing that the glucoprotamin, a bactericidal compound that is present in the solution, may form a thin layer on copper surface, thus protecting environmental bacteria from direct contact with copper. These results indicate that the use of an appropriate disinfectant or cleaning solution for copper surfaces and the application of a specific upkeep protocol could lead to an even better and stable copper antimicrobial activity.",

Interestingly, it is, by far, the largest long-term care facility of the study, with a capacity of 347 residents and a number of 193 employees. Potentially, a higher number of people in an establishment may induce a more intensive use of surfaces, and then results in higher levels of surface contaminations, but also on a faster lowering of the antibacterial activity of copper by oxidation or dirt accumulation.",

High-level contaminations, depending on numerous parameters (humidity, temperature, time delay between contamination, and sampling) stochastically occurred on touch surfaces in long-term care facilities during the study. Our results showed that copper surfaces are less subject to these extreme contaminations, this frequency being reduced by 50% on copper handrail and by 79% on door handles. The average reductions of bacterial burden, as well as the 4,6 times decrease of high contaminations (>20 CFU/cm 2 ) on copper door handles as compared to control handles, (Figure 1 ) suggest that door handles display a stronger antibacterial activity than handrails. These differences in activity between the door handles and handrails may depend in many factors, including the cleaning protocols that are different for door handle and handrail, the way the two types of items are used by the persons and most probably the difference in the percentage of copper, door handles having a higher copper percentage (90% vs. 70%) and being more active against bacteria than handrails.",

In addition, statistical correlation indicates that the medians of bacterial burden on copper surfaces correlates with the medians that were observed on control, demonstrating that the global bacterial burden levels on touch surfaces are influenced by forces depending on the facility and the period of time. Taking all into account, the overall bacterial burden levels were lower on copper surfaces, and this was observed in the five establishments, one year and three years after copper set-up, for both door handle and handrails ( Figure 3) .

MRSA is a pathogen that is frequently involved in healthcare-associated infections [2, 45] and is regularly found on healthcare touch surfaces [46] , where it can potentially persist under environmental conditions for months [12] . Here, we highlighted that, after three years of normal use in healthcare facilities, the copper handles maintain their activity against this pathogen, with a reduction superior to 90% for most of the tested copper door handles, as compared to the residual burden on glass and stainless steel door handles. The efficiency of the copper surfaces, however, seems to slowly decrease with time. While new copper door handles allowed an average 3.2 logs reduction of number of MRSA within two hours, the reduction dropped to 2.7 logs after one year and 1.7 logs after three years of use. Still, copper surfaces remain an interesting long-term solution to fight against touch surface contaminations, especially if installed in the whole facility. Also, as mentioned before, the cleaning protocols remained identical than before the set-up of copper surfaces and other studies have already suggested that cleaning solutions may have an antagonist effect on copper antimicrobial activity [39, 44] . Yet, even if using these inadequate solutions for more than three years, copper surfaces still demonstrate a significant impact against MRSA.",
