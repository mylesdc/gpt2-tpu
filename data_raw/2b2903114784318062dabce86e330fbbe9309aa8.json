            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an alphacoronavirus that has a significant agricultural and economic impact due to the high mortality rate associated with infection of neonatal piglets. Like other coronaviruses, PEDV makes use of a large, trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein to mediate membrane fusion and gain entry into host cells. Despite the importance of the spike protein in viral entry and host immune responses, high-resolution structural information concerning this large macromolecular machine has been difficult to obtain. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the PEDV S protein in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.1 \u00c5. Our studies revealed that the sialic acid-binding domain at the N terminus of the S1 subunit has an orientation that is substantially different from that observed in the previously determined spike structure from human alphacoronavirus NL63. We also observed dissociated S1 subunit trimers wherein the putative receptor-binding domains exist in a conformation differing from that observed in the intact spike proteins, suggesting that the PEDV receptor-binding domain undergoes conformational rearrangements akin to those that have been described in the related betacoronaviruses. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the biological processes that mediate alphacoronavirus attachment, receptor engagement, and fusion triggering while also identifying a source of conformational heterogeneity that could be manipulated to improve PEDV vaccine antigens. IMPORTANCE Coronavirus spike proteins are large, densely glycosylated macromolecular machines that mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion to facilitate entry into host cells. This report describes the atomic-resolution structure of the spike protein from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, a pathogenic alphacoronavirus that causes severe agricultural damage. The structure reveals a novel position for the sialic acid-binding attachment domain in the intact spike. We also observed shed fusion-suppressive capping subunits that displayed the putative receptorbinding domain in an accessible conformation. These observations provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive the earliest stages of alphacoronavirus infection and will inform future efforts to rationally design vaccines.",

ORF 2 encodes the fusion glycoprotein spike (PEDV S), which acts as both the major determinant of host cell tropism and the mediator of viral entry into host cells (10) . PEDV S is a homotrimeric class I fusion protein that is processed into S1 and S2 subunits by trypsin-like host cell proteases (11) . For most coronaviruses, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit attaches to cellular carbohydrates and the C-terminal domain of S1 (S1-CTD) binds to a cellular protein receptor (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . Carbohydrate binding by the S1 N-terminal domain is thought to keep the virus in close proximity to the host cell surface, whereas engagement of specific protein receptors by the S1-CTD is thought to initiate a series of conformational changes in the spike that ultimately result in membrane fusion and delivery of the viral genome to the cytosol. The S2 subunit mediates the membrane fusion event and exhibits the characteristics that define class I fusion proteins. These include a hydrophobic fusion peptide that is directly C terminal to a protease cleavage site, as well as a series of \u2423-helices in the prefusion conformation that rearrange to form a thermostable, elongated six-helix bundle in the postfusion conformation (17, 18) .",

PEDV S DA has been shown to preferentially bind to sialic acid, which is thought to heavily influence the host cell tropism of PEDV. This interaction has been characterized through both high-throughput glycan arrays and hemagglutination assays (20, 21) . Although a precise, quantitative analysis of the affinity of this interaction has yet to be reported, it is generally thought to be a relatively low-affinity interaction that is facilitated by the avidity effect of having numerous copies of trimeric spikes present on the viral surface (22) . Despite the importance of this carbohydrate-binding interaction in facilitating cellular attachment, the isolation of DA-deletion variants in vivo and in vitro suggests that sialic acid binding is not strictly required for cell entry (23, 24) . However, inoculation with DA-deletion variants results in attenuated disease compared to strains that contain DA (25) .",

It has been suggested that PEDV makes use of porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) as a receptor; however, pAPN-knockout swine testis cells are still susceptible to PEDV infection, and this putative interaction has yet to be recapitulated with purified, recombinant components (12, 29) . Regardless of the identity of its functional receptor, PEDV has been shown to infect and replicate in porcine, simian, and human cells, indicating that the virus likely makes use of receptors that share a high degree of homology among these species (21) .",

In one of these conformations, the S1-CTDs pack tightly against the S2 subunit, making the receptor-binding motifs inaccessible to host cell receptors and neutralizing antibodies. In the alternative conformation, the S1-CTD hinges away from the spike, such that it no longer associates with S2 and the receptor-binding motifs are no longer occluded (30) (31) (32) . It has been proposed that sequential receptor binding events trap this transient, receptor-accessible conformation and gradually destabilize S, leading to dissociation of S1, refolding of S2, and membrane fusion (32, 33) . However, in the only alphacoronavirus S structure reported to date, no such S1-CTD dynamics were reported and all three S1-CTDs were in a compact, receptor-inaccessible conformation (34) . Although it is possible that the alphacoronaviruses make use of a triggering mechanism different from that used by the closely related betacoronaviruses, it seems more likely that this transient conformation simply has yet to be observed.",

The structure revealed a DA conformation that was distinct from that observed in the previously determined NL63 S structure.

To structurally characterize the prefusion conformation of PEDV CV777 S, we expressed the soluble ectodomain, encompassing residues 1 to 1319. This construct was designed to be truncated just after heptad repeat 2 (HR2) such that the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), transmembrane domain (TM), and intravirion tail (IV) were excluded. To these residues we appended a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif, an 8\u03eb His tag, and a Twin-Strep-tag. Affinity purification from a 500-ml transfection volume yielded approximately 0.5 mg of protein, which was then further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SDS-PAGE revealed a single band between 160 and 220 kDa, corresponding to the molecular weight of a glycosylated monomer that showed no evidence of cleavage by endogenous proteases. The SEC chromatogram revealed a single, symmetrical peak with an elution volume corresponding to a molecular weight of roughly 600 kDa, suggesting a heavily glycosylated homotrimer. The purified protein was then used to prepare cryo-EM grids. Initially, CF-1.2/1.3 grids were used, but the PEDV S proteins were occluded from the thin ice and exhibited a tendency to cluster around the edge of the holes rather than being uniformly embedded throughout the vitreous ice layer. To mitigate these effects, CF-2/2 grids were prepared using optimized blotting conditions, which allowed collection of full fields of view that contained PEDV S proteins throughout.",

These data are also consistent with previous reports that PEDV S remains uncleaved during viral packaging and becomes proteolytically activated upon exposure to lysosomal proteases in the host cell (39) .",

However, our reconstruction of PEDV S clearly shows the corresponding density for DA jutting out from the apex of the trimer such that it is perpendicular to the 3-fold axis of symmetry and readily accessible to interact with its host cell attachment factor, sialic acid (Fig. 3A) . The positions of DA in these two structures are roughly related by a 180\u00b0r otation about a horizontal axis (see Movie S1 in the supplemental material).

Screening this complex under cryogenic conditions yielded a 10-\u00c5 reconstruction that was indistinguishable from the PEDV CV777 S apo structure (Fig. 4) . These observations are consistent with the theory that host glycans such as sialic acid are likely attachment factors that do not have a dramatic influence on the conformation of the prefusion coronavirus spike (41) . Several previous studies have described the isolation of PEDV S DA-deletion variants that have arisen spontaneously in animals as well as in cell culture (23, 24) . One such strain, PEDV PC177, was recently used to inoculate piglets in a PEDV challenge model, and it was shown that not only was the primary infection with PEDV PC177 significantly attenuated compared to infection with PEDV CV777, but also the piglets inoculated with the DA-deletion variant were significantly more susceptible to subsequent reinfection with PEDV CV777 than those that were originally inoculated with PEDV CV777 (25) . In an attempt to discover a structural explanation for these observations, we expressed and purified residues 1 to 1125 of PEDV PC177 S using the same C-terminal T4 fibritin motif and affinity tags that were used to express and purify PEDV CV777 S. Excluding the DA deletion at the N terminus of the spike, this variant shares 100% sequence identity with PEDV CV777 S. Because of this deletion, we were able to detect a slight but measurable shift of the PEDV PC177 S SEC elution volume relative to the Residues that are predicted to form \u2424-strands are colored in yellow, and residues that are predicted to form \u2423-helices are colored in pink, based on PSIPRED secondary structure prediction. elution volume of PEDV CV777 S (Fig. 5A) . The purified PEDV PC177 S was then observed by negative-stain EM (Fig. 5B) . The final 3D reconstruction of this S variant has a resolution of \u03f320 \u00c5, which was sufficient to show that, other than the absence of DA, the structure of PC177 S does not dramatically differ from that of CV777 S (Fig. 5C ). Because the previously reported differences in susceptibility to reinfection cannot be ascribed to any large-scale conformational differences between the spikes, these data suggest that the enhanced protection against reinfection in piglets inoculated with PEDV CV777 is due to a porcine immune response against DA. S1-CTD dynamics and S1 dissociation. The S1-CTDs of PEDV S adopt the same arrangement that has been described in the alphacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses, wherein the putative receptor-binding loops are tucked against the NTD of the same protomer (34, 38, 42) . Although these loops are present at the apex of the trimer (Fig. 6 , top panel; see also Fig. S5) , it is unlikely that they would be able to engage a host cell protein receptor without the receptor sterically clashing with both the NTD of the same protomer and the S1-CTD of the neighboring protomer (Fig. 6, bottom panel) . For the betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, this clash is avoided when the S1-CTDs undergo a hinge-like movement that repositions the domains above the rest of S1 (31, 32) . This conformational change is thought to allow the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S proteins to mask their determinants of receptor binding from antibodies in one conformation while making them readily accessible for host cell receptor engagement in another conformation. However, after extensive 3D classification of our PEDV CV777 data set, we were unable to observe any such conformational dynamism of the PEDV S1-CTDs in the intact PEDV S trimer. Despite this, the inaccessibility of the putative receptor-binding loops in their observed conformation suggests that there is likely to be an equivalent phenomenon in the alphacoronaviruses. The S1-CTD of the tan protomer is shown in ribbons, and the putative receptor-binding loops are colored red. A potential receptor (porcine aminopeptidase N [PDB ID: 4F5C]) is shown as a transparent molecular surface, colored blue. This model was generated by aligning the S1-CTD of PEDV S with the PRCV RBD from the crystal structure of PRCV RBD bound to porcine aminopeptidase N (PDB ID: 4F5C).",

The presence of these dissociated rings suggests that some small proportion of the purified spike was processed by endogenous trypsin-like proteases, even though SDS-PAGE analysis revealed only a single band corresponding to uncleaved S (Fig. 2) . Similar dissociated S1 rings have been reported during cryo-EM analysis of MERS-CoV S (31) . Despite the relatively few dissociated PEDV S1 caps that were observed, a 3D reconstruction generated from these particles resulted in a 9.4-\u00c5 map that showed evidence of the conformational rearrangement for two of the three S1-CTDs ( Fig. 7B and C) . These domains appear to have rotated \u03f330\u00b0away from the 3-fold axis of symmetry, presumably undergoing a hinge-like motion similar to what has been observed in the betacoronaviruses (Fig. 7D) . The two S1-CTDs that are observed in the \"out\" conformation are stacked directly on their respective SD-1s such that their receptor-binding loops are now pointed away from the NTD and are presumably readily accessible to engage with a putative host cell receptor without forming any steric clashes. Although further experimentation will be required to obtain high-resolution structures of these transient conformations, these observations provide some of the first insights into the process of alphacoronavirus receptor engagement and triggering.",

Although poor connectivity and a relatively low level of local resolution in this region of our map prevented us from reliably assigning atomic coordinates to the entirety of DA, the map clearly reveals that this domain is located at the apex of the trimer, \u03f340 \u00c5 away from the DA conformation in NL63 S. One possible explanation for this novel conformation is that we are merely resolving one of several alternative conformations that DA can sample. However, because we observed only a single, discrete conformation of DA in our data set, this explanation seems unlikely. It is also possible that this conformational discrepancy can be explained by the differences in the expression platforms that were used to produce the S proteins. Coronavirus S proteins are densely glycosylated, and differences in N-linked glycan addition and maturation in mammalian cells (used to produce PEDV S) and in insect cells (used to produce NL63 S) could lead to electrostatic differences or steric hindrances that may result in the conformational change. A third possibility is that DA of PEDV S genuinely adopts a stable, alternative conformation from that of the NL63 S DA.",

Collectively, these data suggest that the differences between the host responses to infection previously observed with PC177 and CV777 were solely due to the presence or absence of DA, suggesting that PEDV DA is capable of eliciting protective antibodies in pigs and that future PEDV vaccination efforts should include these crucial epitopes.",

Here, for the first time in alphacoronaviruses, we report similarly dissociated PEDV S1 rings among our intact S trimers. Yuan et al. (31) were able to generate a relatively low-resolution 3D reconstruction from their dissociated MERS-CoV S1 rings, which seemed to suggest that the MERS-CoV S1-CTD was flipped into the receptoraccessible \"out\" conformation. The 3D reconstruction generated from dissociated PEDV S1 trimers reveals a similar phenomenon, such that two of the S1-CTDs have rotated to a receptor-accessible \"out\" conformation. These data provide the first evidence for conformational dynamism of the S1-CTDs in alphacoronaviruses. It is currently not known why these distinct conformational states have not been observed for intact alphacoronavirus spikes, but it is possible that without a receptor or receptor mimic such as an S1-CTD-directed antibody to trap this receptor-binding domain (RBD)accessible conformation, the transient exposure of the S1-CTD is a very rare event (33) . Nevertheless, the 2D classes and 3D reconstruction of PEDV S1 reported here provide a glimpse at how the process of alphacoronavirus spike triggering is initiated.",
