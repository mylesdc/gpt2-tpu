We have studied the effects of TS on various human oral squamous carcinoma cell lines (HOSCC), including UM1, UM2, SCC-4, and SCC-9. These cell lines were treated with TS leaf extract and screened for viability, apoptosis, necrosis, and apoptotic gene expression. Normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOK) served as a control for cytotoxic assays. Viability of TS-treated HOSCC was reduced, whereas that of NHOK was not affected. FACScan analysis revealed that the leaf extract induced apoptosis or a combination of apoptosis and necrosis, depending on cell type. Microarray and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis for apoptoticrelated gene expression revealed that 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid (gallic acid, one of the major bioactive compounds purified from TS extract) up-regulated pro-apoptotic genes such TNF-\u03b1, TP53BP2, and GADD45A, and down-regulated the anti-apoptotic genes Survivin and cIAP1, resulting in cell death. This study suggests that gallic acid, the major bioactive compound present, is responsible for the anti-neoplastic effect of Toona sinensis leaf extract.",

It has been traditionally used as herbal medicine for as a febrifuge, astringent and carminative and as a treatment for enteritis [1] . It has recently been reported that TS leaf extract exerts pleiotropic biological functions such as a lypolytic effect on adipocytes [2] , protective effects against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress on DNA [3] , an enhancing effect on glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes [4] , and an inhibitory effect on SARS coronavirus replication [5] and leydig cell steroidogenesis [6] . In addition, the crude water extract of TS leaves has been demonstrated to possess anti-proliferative effects, to promoted apoptosis in human non-small lung cancer cells [7] [8] [9] [10] , and alleviate liver fibrosis [11] and hyperglycemia by altering the adipose glucose transporter 4 [12] . Most recently, the fractionated TS leaf extract (TSL2) was shown to induce apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cells and inhibit tumor growth in a xenograft model [13] . Gallic acid, a phenolic component purified from TS leaf extract, induces cell death in the human premyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60 [14] , and in human prostate cancer cells [15] . The biologically active compound in TS leaf extracts may be similar to other naturally obtained compounds such as genistein, phenolic compounds, flavinoids, tea polyphenols, alkaloids, polysaccharides and glycoproteins, and lectins and terpinoids, which are known to induce apoptotic cell death in cancer cell lines via various pathways [16, 17] .",

At the indicated time points, cells were harvested for viability assays. As shown in Figure 1 , TSL-1 effectively caused cell death at 48 hours in SCC-4, SCC-9, and UM1 cells, whereas UM2 was less affected. To confirm the toxicity of TSL-1, primary cultured normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOK) were also subjected to 12 to 48 hours of treatment. Our results clearly demonstrated that there was no significant inhibitory effect on NHOK at indicated various time points post-treatment with 250 or 500 \u00b5g/mL of TSL-1, as compared to untreated cells ( Figure 1 ).

Our results clearly demonstrated that TSL-1 induces HOSCC cell death by either apoptosis or a combination of apoptosis and necrosis.

Furthermore, gallic acid was identified as the major bioactive compound present in TS leaf extract, TSL-1, which induces anti-neoplastic activity by up-regulating pro-apoptotic genes and downregulating anti-apoptotic genes, resulting in cell death. also indebted to Jun Song, Hee-Yeon Cho, and An Giang for their advice and critical comments on the manuscript.",
