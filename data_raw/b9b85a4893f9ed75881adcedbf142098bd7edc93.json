The infectious titers of treated viral samples were determined by focus-forming unit (FFU) assay using an indirect immunofluorescence assay for HCV NS3 in hepatoma Huh7-25-CD81 cells highly permissive for HCVcc infection.

HCVcc in culture medium was sensitive to heat and could be inactivated in 8 and 4 min when incubated at 60\u00b0C and 65\u00b0C, respectively. However, at 56\u00b0C, 40 min were required to eliminate HCVcc infectivity. Addition of normal human serum to HCVcc did not significantly alter viral stability at RT or its susceptibility to heat. UVC light irradiation (wavelength = 253.7 nm) with an intensity of 450 \u03bcW/cm 2 efficiently inactivated HCVcc within 2 min. Exposures to formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, ionic or nonionic detergents all destroyed HCVcc infectivity effectively, regardless of whether the treatments were conducted in the presence of cell culture medium or human serum. Conclusions: The results provide quantitative evidence for the potential use of a variety of approaches for inactivating HCV. The ability of HCVcc to survive ambient temperatures warrants precautions in handling and disposing of objects and materials that may have been contaminated with HCV.",

Prior to the introduction of anti-HCV screening tests in the early 1990s, receiving blood and blood products or organ transplants was a major risk factor for acquiring HCV infection. Currently, injection of illicit drugs represents a major risk, while other routes of infection, including occupational exposure (such as needle stick), sex, and mother-to-infant transmission (with the exception of HIV-coinfected mother), seem infrequent [3] . Interestingly, it was shown recently in the chimpanzee model that HCV in infectious plasma could survive drying and environmental exposure to room temperature for at least 16 h. This finding has raised the possibility of person-to-person transmission of HCV via blood-contaminated objects and medical devices [4] . Clearly, it is fundamental to quantitatively determine the stability of HCV under environmental conditions and evaluate reliable procedures for inactivating this virus. However, such efforts have been hampered by the lack of an efficient cell culture system and convenient, small animal models for HCV. Although HCV RNA and antigens have been used as indicators for the presence or absence of virus particles, such detection methods do not distinguish between the infectious and inactivated viruses [4] [5] [6] . To circumvent this, several related viruses in the family Flaviviridae that can be readily cultured in vitro, e.g., bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV, genus Pestivirus), have been used as surrogates for HCV to study the inactivation process [7, 8] . Although these model viruses show similarity in virion and genome structure to HCV, more relevant systems are still needed to assess the reliable procedures for inactivating HCV.",

The HCVcc stock (2.5 \u00d7 10 4 FFU/ml in culture medium) lost its infectivity after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 48 h, when the FFU assay became negative and no residual infectivity was found upon three successive passages of the inoculated Huh7-25-CD81 cultures (Figure 1A) . Most of the infectivity loss occurred within the first 24 h [from 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 FFU/ml to (5.7 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 1 FFU/ml, a 2.6-log reduction], while a further 0.4-log reduction in the following 16 h brought the virus titer down to (2.3 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 1 FFU/ml, close to the detection limit (10 FFU/ml). In contrast to 37\u00b0C, viral titers declined much more slowly and smoothly at RT ( Figure  1B ). Incubation for every 2 days led to 0.4-to 0.5-log reduction in viral titers until day 14 when infectivity dropped to the level of detection limit. The virus stock became completely devoid of infectivity at day 16 (Figure 1B) and later (data not shown). When incubated at 4\u00b0C, no obvious loss of viral infectivity was detected within the first 4 weeks ( Figure 1C ). However, we noticed a nearly 0.5-log reduction of viral titer after 6 weeks, when the experiments were ended. Lindenbach et al reported that the infectivity of J6/JFH1 HCVcc did not change after three freeze-thaw cycles [10] . Consistent with this, we found no obvious reduction of infectivity even after five cycles of freezing and thawing of the JFH1 HCVcc stock (data not shown). This suggests that HCVcc is relatively insensitive to freeze-thaw manipulation.",

As shown in Figure 2A , at 56\u00b0C HCVcc lost most of its infectivity within 30 min, with a 2.9-log reduction in viral titer [from 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 FFU/ml to (3.3 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 1 FFU/ml). However, after 35 min, a very small amount of infectious virus was still detectable [(1.3 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 1 FFU/ml]. Complete viral inactivation took place at 40 min (Figure 2A) , and no residual infectivity was detected for samples treated beyond this time point (data not shown). Heat treatments at higher temperatures led to a more rapid decline in viral titer. At 60\u00b0C or 65\u00b0C ( Figure 2B ), HCV stocks were inactivated completely by 8 or 4 min, respectively. Similar kinetics of viral inactivation was observed when heat treatment was performed on HCVcc stocks spiked in human serum. When incubated at 56\u00b0C, the viral titer dropped by 3.6-log in the first 30 min [from 1.0 \u00d7 10 5 FFU/ml to (3.3 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10 1 FFU/ml].

Taken together, these results indicate that HCVcc is sensitive to heat treatment and 56\u00b0C or higher temperatures could be used for effective HCVcc inactivation.

Also, at these aldehyde concentrations, the viral titration results were not perturbed ( Table 1 and 2). Therefore, viral samples treated with 0.037% formaldehyde or 0.01% glutaraldehyde were diluted 100-fold for infectivity assay. The reduction in viral titer of an HCVcc stock (4.1 \u00d7 10 4 FFU/ml) following exposure to each of the aldehydes is summarized in Table 1 . At 2 h posttreatment of formaldehyde, a single fluorescent focus was detected in one of the triplicate wells in the FFU assay, while the other two wells showed negative results. Virus samples treated for 2.5 h were negative in the FFU assay; however, a positive IFA result was observed at the second cell passage, indicating the presence of residual infectious virus. After 3 h of treatment, no residual infectivity could be detected up to the third cell passage (Table 1) . Compared with 0.037% formaldehyde, 0.01% glutaraldehyde exhibited a higher efficacy in viral inactivation. Ten minutes of glutaraldehyde treatment resulted in more than 1-log reduction in infectivity.

The results of the current study have demonstrated that JFH-1 virus (genotype 2a) grown in cell culture can survive 37\u00b0C and RT for 2 and 16 days, respectively ( Figure 1A and 1B). Of note, the stability of JFH1 HCVcc spiked in human serum did not differ much from those in cell culture medium when incubated at RT (Fig. 1D) . When stored at 4\u00b0C, JFH-1 virus was found to be relatively stable, without drastic loss of titer during the 6-week observation period ( Figure 1C ). The latter result is in agreement with a previous report dealing with the J6/ JFH1 chimeric virus [10] . The ability of HCVcc to survive various environmental temperatures warrants precautions in handling and disposing objects and materials that may have been contaminated with HCV, to minimize the risk of HCV transmission.",

The mechanisms of heatmediated inactivation include denaturation of viral proteins, as well as disassembly of virus particles into noninfectious viral subunits and single proteins [15] . Viruses other than HCV in the family Flaviviridae have been shown to be sensitive to heat treatment. Yellow fever virus is routinely inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. At 60\u00b0C , BVDV and yellow fever virus have been reported to be inactivated effectively in 30 and 5 min, respectively [8, 16] . In the current study, similar kinetics of viral inactivation following heat treatment was observed for both the HCVcc in culture medium and those in human serum. While 10 min at 60\u00b0C or 4 min at 65\u00b0C was sufficient to eliminate the infectivity of HCVcc, incubation for 40 min was required to achieve complete viral inactivation at 56\u00b0C (Figure 2) . Therefore, pretreatment of HCV positive sera for 30 min at 56\u00b0C may not be absolutely reliable in eliminating their infectivity. However, because the efficiency of heat treatment could be affected by a variety of factors, such as the initial viral titer, protein concentration in virus suspension, as well as the existence of viral aggregates [8, 17] the exact temperature and time required for reliable HCV inactivation should be evaluated under each specific condition.",

            "text": "UV light irradiation is another commonly used physical method for viral inactivation. UVC with a wavelength range of 200-280 nm prevents viral replication by inducing formation of pyrimidine dimers in the viral genome [18] . A recent study reported that BVDV, when suspended in PBS, could be inactivated completely by 1.6 J/cm 2 UVC light, while viral suspension containing 5% FBS required a higher radiation dose [7] . The current study demonstrated that HCVcc in culture medium (2.5 \u00d7 10 4 FFU/ml, volume depth of 0.2 cm) could be inactivated completely by UVC irradiation at a dose of 2.7 \u00d7 10 -2 J/cm 2 within 1 min ( Figure 3A ), while those spiked in human serum (1.0 \u00d7 10 5 FFU/ml) required an irradiation dose of 5.4 \u00d7 10 -2 J/cm 2 for full inactivation ( Figure 3B ). Therefore, UVC light irradiation represents a highly effective means for inactivating HCVcc, the efficiency of which is not affected by human serum components that may interact with HCV virons in vivo. However, the irradiation dose required for each specific occasion may depend on the sample volume and its initial viral titer. As a chemical cross-linking reagent, formaldehyde inactivates viruses primarily by denaturing viral proteins, as well as the nucleic acids [19, 20] . Because the immunogenicity of the viral particles can be retained during inactivation, formalin (37% formaldehyde) treatment is the most used technique for preparing inactivated virus vaccines. For tissue fixation for histology or immunohistochemistry, 10% formalin (or 4% paraformaldehyde) is routinely used. Glutaraldehyde is another effective protein cross-linking reagent, mostly used for fixation of tissues for electron microscopy. Although the detailed mechanisms are not entirely clear yet, successful inactivation of many viruses with glutaraldehyde, including hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and SARS coronavirus, has been reported [18, 21, 22] . We demonstrated here that at RT, 3 h of exposure to formaldehyde (0.037%) or 20 min of exposure to glutaraldehyde (0.01%), respectively, could reduce HCVcc infectivity from 4.1 \u00d7 10 4 FFU/ml to undetectable levels (Table 1) . At these concentrations both aldehydes were also effective in inactivating HCVcc in the presence of human serum ( Table 2 ). The slightly longer times required (4 h for formaldehyde treated samples and 40 min for glutaraldehyde treated samples, respectively) were most likely attributed to the 2.5-fold higher initial titer of the HCVcc stock tested (1.0 \u00d7 10 5 FFU/ml). However, a limitation of the current study is that, because of the cytotoxic effect of the aldehydes, the infectivity of viral samples could be analyzed at only the 100-fold dilution, which may somehow have reduced the sensitivity of the assay. It should be noted, however, the routinely used concentrations of aldehydes for fixation purposes (4% for formaldehyde and 2.5% for glutaraldehyde) are far in excess of the ones examined in the current study and, therefore, should be highly efficient in achieving HCV inactivation.",

            "text": "Detergents are highly efficient at disrupting the lipidenveloped viruses, and solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment is a standard method for inactivating viruses present in human blood products [22] . The effects of both ionic (SDS) and nonionic (Triton X-100 and NP-40) detergents on HCVcc infectivity have been investigated here. All three detergents at the tested concentrations reduced HCVcc infectivity rapidly to undetectable levels (Table 3) . Importantly, both intracellular HCVcc and those released into culture fluid could be inactivated by each of these detergents, regardless of the presence of human serum, indicating that components of culture medium, human serum or intracellular proteins did not interfere with the disruptive processes exerted by these detergents. Under current experimental conditions, effective HCVcc inactivation took place immediately after vortex-mixing, rendering it impossible to delineate the kinetics of viral infectivity reduction during the detergent treatment process. This finding is reminiscent of that reported for HIV in a previous study, which demonstrated that HIV-1 spiked in solution containing 1% Triton X-100 was inactivated completely within 1 min [23] . As in the case of the aldehyde-inactivation experiments, the cytotoxic effect of detergents limited the sensitivity of the current assays. Interestingly, although 0.0005% Triton X-100 and 0.0005% NP-40 had no detectable effect on cell viability ( Figure 4C ), they still lowered HCVcc infectivity by 1.7-to 2.5-fold when the latter was compared with those determined in the presence of 0.001% SDS or without any detergent (Table  3 ). Most likely, the residual Triton X-100 or NP-40 still had some disruptive effect on virion integrity, which is important for viral infectivity. Alternatively, these detergents may have caused some cell surface alterations at this extremely low concentration that affect the process of HCVcc entry. However, to maintain the sensitivity of the assay, the detergent-treated samples were not diluted further for the infectivity test. Collectively, the robustness and immediate action of detergents in destroying HCVcc infectivity support the use of S/D treatment procedures in eliminating potential HCV contaminations in blood products.",

However, because the stability and resistance of HCV to different inactivation methods may vary from genotype to genotype, and even strain to strain, the optimal method and procedure used for HCV inactivation should be verified under each particular circumstance. We also note that the results of the current study were developed using an in vitro cell culture system based on hepatoma Huh7 cells, which may differ from normal human hepatocytes in supporting HCV infection. Thus, to what extent the procedures described herein can be applied to an in vivo setting awaits further evaluation.",

The infected cells were passaged at 3-day intervals with 1:3 to 1:4 split ratios into progressively larger culture vessels. At 12 days postinfection, the culture supernatants were harvested, clarified by centrifugation (5 min at 4000 rpm), and stored in aliquots at -70\u00b0C as the HCVcc stock.

Following PBS washes, the numbers of fluorescent foci (a focus is defined as a cluster of infected cells immunostained positive for NS3 antigen) per well at appropriate dilutions (generally containing 5 to 100 foci per well) were counted. The infectious titers, expressed as FFU/ml, were calculated from the average foci number of triplicate or duplicate (for samples derived from human serum spiked with HCVcc) wells. The detection limit of the FFU assay was 10 FFU/ml. For samples with infectious titers below the detection limit of the assay, the potential residual infectivity was examined as follows. Na\u00efve Huh7-25-CD81 cells seeded in 96-well plates were inoculated with samples to be tested (100 \u03bcl/well). Inoculated cells were passaged at 3day intervals from one well into three wells at each passage (with a 1:3 split ratio) to allow growth of residual infectious virus. IFA for NS3 were performed on each cell passage. If the IFA results remained negative for three successive cell passages (up to 9 days postinoculation), the tested sample was considered to be inactivated completely.",

After a 4-h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the MTT solution was removed and replaced with 200 \u03bcl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) per well. After the formazan crystals were dissolved by agitation (10 min at RT), the absorbance of solution in each well was measured at 490 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Bio-Rad). The percentage of cell viability was calculated as the ratio of absorbance in treated cells compared with that in untreated controls. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated twice.",

Immediately after the dilution, HCV infectivity in samples was titrated by FFU assay in Huh7-25-CD81 cells. Samples showing negative results in FFU assay were subjected to the residual infectivity test, as described in \"HCV infectivity assay\" As control, PBS was substituted for the aldehydes to treat the virus stocks, which were then diluted 100-fold to infect cells in the presence of either 0.00037% formaldehyde or 0.0001% glutaraldehyde, respectively.",
