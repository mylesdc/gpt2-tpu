In contrast to cytokine blockers, therapeutic blockade of TREM-1 can blunt excessive inflammation while preserving the capacity for microbial control. However, the nature of the TREM-1 ligand(s) and mechanisms of TREM-1 signalling are still not yet well understood, impeding the development of clinically relevant inhibitors of TREM-1. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-arthritic activity of a novel, ligand-independent TREM-1 inhibitory nonapeptide GF9 that was rationally designed using the signalling chain homo oligomerization (SCHOOL) model of cell signalling. Free GF9 and GF9 bound to macrophage-targeted nanoparticles that mimic human high-density lipoproteins (GF9-HDL) were used to treat collageninduced arthritis (CIA). We also tested if 31-mer peptides with sequences from GF9 and helices 4 (GE31) and 6 (GA31) of the major HDL protein, apolipoprotein A-I, are able to perform three functions: assist in the self-assembly of GA/E31-HDL, target these particles to macrophages and block TREM-1 signalling. We showed that GF9, but not control peptide, ameliorated CIA and protected against bone and cartilage damage. The therapeutic effect of GF9 was accompanied by a reduction in the plasma levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-a, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6. Incorporation of GF9 alone or as a part of GE31 and GA31 peptides into HDL significantly increased its therapeutic efficacy. Collectively, our findings suggest that TREM-1 inhibitory SCHOOL sequences may be promising alternatives for the treatment of RA.",

The abundance and activation of macrophages in the inflamed synovial membrane significantly correlates with the severity of RA [1, 3] . Therapies that fail to reduce the number of synovial sublining macrophages are unlikely to be clinically effective [4] . Major targets related to macrophage development, activation, growth and differentiation include tumour necrosis factor-a (TNFa), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF-1) [5] . M-CSF-dependent cells are known to be essential for collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) development [6] . Targeted delivery of antirheumatic drugs to macrophages is another highly desirable strategy for the treatment of RA because it would not only strike the cells that mediate or amplify most of the permanent tissue destruction but also spare other cells that do not affect joint damage [7, 8] .",

However, despite some recent evidence that peptidoglycan recognition protein 1 (PGLYRP1) may potentially act as a ligand for TREM-1 [15] , the actual nature of the TREM-1 ligand(s) and mechanisms of TREM-1 signalling are still not yet well understood, impeding the development of clinically relevant inhibitors of TREM-1. Recently, using a new model of transmembrane signalling, the signalling chain homooligomerization (SCHOOL) model [16, 17] , we designed a TREM-1-specific inhibitory nonapeptide GF9 that employs a novel, ligand-independent mechanism of receptor inhibition ( Fig. 1B) [18] . We demonstrated that GF9 attenuates the specific inflammatory response and ameliorates sepsis and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in animal models [18] . We also used selfassembling lipopeptide complexes that mimic human high-density lipoproteins (HDL) for targeted delivery of GF9 to macrophages (Fig. 1C ) and showed that this increases its therapeutic efficacy in vivo [18] .",

The molar ratio was 125:6:2:3:1:210 corresponding to POPC:cholesterol:cholesteryl oleate:GF9:apo A-I:sodium cholate for GF9-sHDL that contain GF9 and an equimolar mixture of oxidized apo A-I peptides H4 and H6 or 125:6:2:1:210 corresponding to POPC:cholesterol:cholesteryl oleate:GA/E31-I:sodium cholate for GA/E31-sHDL that contain an equimolar mixture of oxidized peptides GA31 and GE31. In subsets of experiments, GF9 or apo A-I H4 was DyLight 488-labelled. All obtained HDL formulations were purified and characterized as described previously [18] [19] [20] .",

In this study, using fluorescence microscopy and GF9-HDL with Rho B-labelled lipid, we first demonstrated a punctuated pattern of the interaction between GF9-HDL and macrophages ( Fig. 2A) , which closely mimics that of the physiological interaction between native HDL and hepatocytes, which is mediated by scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) [23] . To confirm intracellular uptake versus nonspecific cell surface binding, we next examined the interaction between J774 macrophages and GF9-HDL that contain Rho B-labelled lipid and DyLight 488-labelled oxidized apo A-I peptide H4. This interaction resulted in intracellular delivery of both lipid and peptide components of GF9-HDL (Fig. 2B) , suggesting that the whole GF9-HDL particle is uptaken by the cell, most likely by a receptor-mediated mechanism. Pronounced colocalization of lipid and apo A-I peptide H4 (Fig. 2B ) demonstrates that at this time-point, most of the GF9-HDL particles remain intact after uptake, when the others are degraded, releasing their lipid and peptide contents into the intracellular space. While the data illustrated in Figure 2A and B were generated using GF9-sHDL, similar results were observed for GF9-dHDL (data not shown). Our data also indicate that the use of an equimolar mixture of oxidized peptides GA31 and GE31 enhances uptake of GA/E31-HDL of discoidal and spherical shape by macrophages in vitro as compared with their unmodified counterparts (data not shown). Together, these findings suggest that oxidized apo A-I epitopes responsible for the interaction with macrophages are exposed in all types of the HDL particles used.",

Vehicletreated arthritic mice had histopathology changes, consistent with those seen in type II CIA (Figs. 3 and 4) . Microscopic alteration included infiltration of synovium and periarticular tissue with neutrophils and mononuclear inflammatory cells (inflammation), marginal zone pannus and bone resorption and cartilage damage (proteoglycan loss, chondrocyte death and collagen matrix destruction). Arthritic mice treated with GF9-G at 25 mg/kg (Fig. 3B) or free GF9 at 2.5 mg/kg (data not shown) had histopathology parameters that did not differ significantly from vehicle-treated mice. In contrast, all six-joint mean histopathology parameters were overall significantly reduced in mice with CIA treated using either a higher dose of free GF9 or TREM-1 inhibitory GF9 sequences incorporated into HDL (Fig. 3B ). In line with our clinical observations (Fig. 3A) , in mice treated with free GF9 at 25 mg/kg, a 96% reduction of summed scores compared to vehicle-treated mice was observed, which was similar to that observed in Dex-treated mice (99% reduction, data not shown). When compared to GF9-G-treated mice, mice treated with GF9 at the same dose had significantly reduced inflammation (94% reduction), pannus formation (98%), cartilage damage (96%), bone resorption (99%), periosteal bone formation (98%) and summed scores (97%) (Fig. 3C) . A similar tendency was observed A C B Fig. 2 Interaction of GF9-loaded high-density lipoproteins (HDL) with macrophages and colocalization of GF9 with TREM-1. (A) Fluorescence microscopy reveals a punctuated pattern of the interaction between GF9-loaded spherical HDL (GF9-sHDL) and J774A.1 macrophages that closely mimics that of the receptor-mediated physiological interaction between native HDL and hepatocytes. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C with GF9-sHDL that contain rhodamine (Rho) B-labelled peptide (red). Scale bar = 10 lm. (B) Confocal microscopy demonstrates that upon interaction, both lipid and protein components of GF9-sHDL are delivered intracellularly to macrophages. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C with GF9-sHDL that contain Rho B-labelled lipid (red) and DyLight 488-labelled apo A-I peptide H4 (green). Cell nuclei were stained with 4 0 ,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) dye (blue). Scale bar = 5 lm. (C) Colocalization of GF9 and TREM-1 in the cell membrane. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C with GF9-sHDL that contain DyLight 488-labelled GF9 (green) and stained for TREM-1 with Alexa 647-labelled anti-TREM-1 antibody (red). Scale bar = 5 lm. Reduction of histopathological scores observed in mice treated with GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL when compared to vehicle-or GF9-Gtreated mice was in line with the clinical findings (Fig. 3A) and varied from 66 to up to 88% (Fig. 3B ) depending on particle shape and composition. Figure 4 shows representative photomicrographs of joints from arthritic mice treated with GF9 and GF9-G in free form at the same dose of 25 mg/kg as well as with GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL. No differences were observed between arthritic mice treated with vehicle or control peptide GF9-G (Fig. 4) : the fore and hind paw joints had moderate to severe inflammation and cartilage damage with moderate pannus and bone resorption, as well as mild periosteal bone formation, in all joints. The ankle and knee joints from these mice had marked inflammation and moderate cartilage damage with pannus formation, bone resorption and periosteal bone formation (Fig. 4) . Markedly thickened synovial membrane and capsule were observed in the vehicle-and GF9-G-treated mice as a result of pannus formation and inflammatory cell infiltration. The chronic inflammation destroyed the joint lining, including the cartilage and other nearby supporting structures, such as bone (Fig. 4) . The formation of pannus probably resulted from overgrowth of the synoviocytes and the observed accumulation of inflammatory cells that led to deformed cartilage and bone. These findings agree with the observed clinical scores. In contrast, in the fore and hind paw joints of mice with CIA treated with free GF9 at 25 mg/kg, no or very minimal inflammation and minimal cartilage damage were observed (Fig. 4) . The knee and ankle joints of these animals had no lesions or very minimal inflammation and only mild evidence of synovial membrane thickening with pannus formation, which falls within normal limits and is comparable to nonarthritic naive mice (Fig. 4) . Similar histopathology was observed in mice with CIA treated with either sHDL-bound GF9 or sHDL-bound GA/E31 (Fig. 4) .",

Considering a high interindividual variability in cytokine levels in RA patients [34] , this suggests that the therapeutic response to cytokine blockers as well as the risk for complications can depend on baseline cytokine levels. Indeed, in patients with RA, baseline TNF is associated with the clinical response to infliximab (TNF blocker): a higher dose is necessary in patients with a high baseline TNF, whereas lower doses of infliximab are sufficient for those with a low baseline TNF [35, 36] . Further, for TNF blockers, an increased risk of malignancies is dosedependent [37] . This leads to the critical need for personalization of treatment using cytokine blockers as well as for substantial efforts to avoid excessive immunosuppression. In addition, cytokine blockers do not protect against cartilage damage as effectively as they do against bone erosion [38] .",

The observed colocalization of GF9 and TREM-1 in the membrane of macrophages incubated with free GF9 (data not shown) confirms this mechanism and is in line with the findings reported for other SCHOOL peptides [19, 21, 42] . Together with the intriguing ability of different viruses to use the SCHOOL mechanisms to disarm TCR and other receptors involved in the host immune response [19, 24] , these findings support our unifying hypothesis [19, 24, 43 ] that viral immune evasion strategies developed and optimized during millions of years **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** **** *** Fig. 5 Treatment with TREM-1 inhibitory peptide GF9 sequences reduces plasma cytokines in collagen-induced arthritis. Plasma was collected on days 24, 30 and 38 from arthritic mice treated with vehicle (black), GF9 (blue), GF9-loaded spherical HDL (GF9-sHDL, red) and sHDL that contain an equimolar mixture of GA31 and GE31 (GA/E31-sHDL, purple). Plasma samples were analysed for concentrations of interleukin-1b (IL-1b), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-a (TNFa) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Results are expressed as the mean AE SEM (n = 5 mice per group). ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001 versus vehicle. Considering the very short half-life of peptides in vivo and the lack of cell specificity of the self-insertion process, we used our reconstituted (synthetic) HDL-based delivery platform to provide targeted delivery of GF9 to macrophages and to prolong the peptide half-life (Fig. 1C) [18, 19, 22] . As expected, in contrast to free GF9, which is inactive at 2.5 mg/kg, HDL-bound GF9 at the same dose was therapeutically effective in treating mice with CIA (Figs. 3 and 4) . Although the underlying molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon need to be further elucidated, one can suggest that this may result from targeted delivery of TREM-1 inhibitory GF9 sequence to macrophages and/or from the prolonged circulatory half-life of HDL-bound peptides. Confocal data (Fig. 2) suggest that in line with our previous data [18, 22, 25] , methionine-sulfoxidized apo A-I epitopes involved in the interaction of HDL with macrophages are exposed in all types of these HDL particles and provide intracellular delivery of TREM-1 inhibitory GF9 sequences to macrophages, most probably in a receptor-mediated manner. On the other hand, while the in vivo peptide half-life is typically a few minutes [44] , native dHDL and sHDL are characterized by much longer half-lives up to 12-20 hours and 3-5 days, respectively [45, 46] . This could result in less frequent administration, which in turn might improve compliance. Further, our confocal data in vitro (Fig. 2 ) and the therapeutic efficacy of HDLbased formulations observed in vivo suggest that TREM-1 inhibitory GF9 sequences intracellularly delivered to macrophages can reach their site of action in the membrane from inside the cell. The use of HDL as a vehicle for systemic delivery of drugs is increasingly important [47] . Together with advanced clinical development of reconstituted HDL per se as a drug [48] , the capability of synthetic apo A-I peptides to functionally replace human apo A-I demonstrated in mice with CIA (this study) as well as in mice with sepsis, atherosclerosis and lung cancer [18, 19, 22] encourages further development of this HDL-based delivery platform.",

In the present study, trifunctional peptides GE31 and GA31 were shown to assist in the self-assembly of HDL, target these particles to macrophages and inhibit TREM-1. This suggests that multifunctional peptides that target TREM-1 and/or other receptors expressed on macrophages can be designed and used in developing the next-generation peptide-based therapies for RA and other diseases.",

Among them, TNFa, IL-6 and IL-1 serve as targets of cytokine-blocking therapies that are currently in development (e.g., IL-21, IL-23 and IL-33), at different phases of clinical trials (e.g., IL-7, IL-15, IL-17 and M-CSF), or approved (e.g., TNFa, IL-6 and IL-1 blockers) [50] . In the present study, TREM-1 inhibitory GF9 sequences significantly reduced plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and M-CSF in mice with CIA in a specific and dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, M-CSF plays a role in promoting tumour growth and progression to metastasis [51] . Currently, several inhibitors of M-CSF or its receptor are in various stages of clinical development for cancer therapy [52] . Thus, M-CSF may represent an important mechanistic link between the anti-arthritic activity of TREM-1 inhibitory GF9 sequences observed in this study and the anticancer activity of GF9 previously observed in two xenograft models of NSCLC [18] . This is in line with recent studies [53] , where M-CSF was suggested as the underlying factor facilitating tumour progression and metastasis in arthritic PyV MT mice. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",
