In particular, flaviviruses including WNV are sensed by the RLRs through binding of viral RNA Gale 2008, 2011; Errett et al. 2013) . RNA binding induces RLR activation and interaction with downstream signaling proteins that activate transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, and NF-kB to drive innate immune gene expression and the production of type 1 and III interferons (IFNs). IFN is secreted by the infected cell to signal through the IFN receptors on both the infected cell and on bystander cells, to drive the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) across the local tissue (Loo and Gale 2011) . Innate immune genes and ISGs have antiviral and immune modulatory activity to limit viral replication and spread such that their induction and function are essential for the control of WNV infection and immunity (Daffis et al. 2009; Suthar et al. 2010; Lazear et al. 2013; Lazear and Diamond 2015) .",

            "text": "The Oas genes including Oas1b are ISGs whose expression is induced by IFN in most cell types (Elkhateeb et al. 2016 , Choi et al. 2015 . In humans, the Oas family contains Oas1, Oas2, Oas3, and Oas-like (OasL) genes. Oas2 and Oas3 genes have high human-mouse sequence similarity with a 1:1 orthogonal copy. The mouse Oas gene cluster is located on chromosome 5 and includes Oas1, Oas2, Oas3, and OasL genes. The Oas1 gene has eight orthogonal copies (Oas1a, Oas1b, Oas1c, Oas1d, Oas1e, Oas1f, Oas1g, and Oas1h) in mouse compared to one copy (Oas1) in humans on chromosome 12. These eight mouse Oas1 genes are the result of gene duplications, rearrangements, and other evolutionary processes [Choi et al. 2015 , for more details of such genome regions in the CC, see Morgan et al. (2017) ]. Most members of the Oas gene family encode 29-59 oligoadenylate (2-5A) enzymatic activity that catalyzes adenosine into 29-59-linked oligonucleotides referred to as oligoadenylates or 2-5A (Kristiansen et al. 2011) . 2-5A serves as a ligand to bind and activate ribonuclease L (RNaseL), a latent endoribonuclease. When activated during viral infection, RNaseL serves to suppress viral replication by nucleolytic targeting viral and host RNAs. RNaseL products of RNA degradation can also serve as activator ligands of the RLRs, thus stimulating and amplifying further rounds of innate immune signaling (Malathi et al. 2007 , Siddiqui et al. 2012 , Drappier et al. 2015 . Among the Oas family members, Oas1b lacks 2-5A activity, revealing that the antiviral function of Oas1b is unique and independent of RNaseL activation for controlling WNV infection (Scherbik et al. 2006; Courtney et al. 2012; Elbahesh et al. 2011) . Oas1b is found truncated in classical inbred mouse strains due the presence of a stop codon/nonsense mutation within the mRNA (Elbahesh et al. 2011) . When otherwise expressed as a full-length protein, OAS1b provides functional antiviral activity against WNV (Elbahesh et al. 2011) . Recent studies found that OAS1b has a C-terminus domain targeting the endoplasmic reticulum with binding partner protein ABCF3 assisting in antiviral activity (Courtney et al. 2012) . The same study showed that full-length (nontruncated) Oas1b inhibited OAS1a activity and lowered 2-5A levels in a dose-dependent manner in vivo. Polymorphisms in Oas1b are also thought to impact the overall host immune response to virus infection, but how Oas1b operates in immune regulation is not defined (Bigham et al. 2011) .",

Genetic variation of immune genes plays an important role in infection outcome and contributes to host susceptibility and resistance (Ferris et al. 2013 ). As noted above, most wild derived inbred mouse strains produce a full-length Oas1b protein, whereas most if not all inbred mouse strains, including the strain of the reference genome, C57BL/6J, have a premature stop codon in Oas1b that links with susceptibility to WNV infection (Elbahesh et al. 2011; Mashimo et al. 2002 , see Figure 6 , Supplemental Material, Figure S1 , and Table 1 and Table 2 ). To capture the genetic diversity of Oas1b for functional studies of WNV susceptibility, we evaluated its expression and linkage with WNV infection outcome and innate immune transcriptional signatures in the CC mouse population (Iraqi et al. 2012) .",

The CC resource is composed of $70 independently bred, octo-parental recombinant inbred mouse strains (Srivastava et al. 2017) , out of several hundred lines started (Shorter et al. 2017) . Each CC line inherits haplotypes from three wild-derived (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) and five classical (A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShILtJ, and NZO/HiLtJ) inbred strains contributing both functional and nonfunctional OAS1b proteins into this MPP. Here, we use F1 crosses between CC strains, generated to understand complex and diverse phenotypic responses to virus infection (Rasmussen et al. 2014; Graham et al. 2016) . The CC mice are an excellent model of WNV infection because their intron and exon structures in the Oas gene family are conserved (Choi et al. 2015) . However, utilization of F1s allows sequences to differ between alleles at a locus, causing allelic heterozygosity between the wild-derived and classical inbred Oas1b sequences in this panel. Within this panel of F1s, we can generate classes of F1s based on their Oas1b alleles: functional Oas1b alleles from Dam and Sire (F/F), heterozygous RIX lines where only the Dam has a functional Oas1b allele (F/N), only the Sire (N/F), or neither parent has functioning Oas1b alleles (N/N). In previous work, we used the CC model to evaluate host responses to WNV and observed phenotypic variation that recapitulates the diversity in WNV susceptibility and outcomes observed in human populations (Graham et al. 2015 , Green et al. 2016a , Green et al. 2016b .",

The second Y i adjusts for kinship and e i for residual error in the animal (i). In order to generate additive allelic dosage probabilities for each F1, we generated eight-allele probabilities for each F1 with half of the probability for each allele coming from the inbred dam RI, and half coming from the sire RI, based on the MegaMUGA most recent common ancestor (MRCA) probabilities (http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py?run=FounderProbs) (Srivastava et al. 2017) . The X-chromosome of these F1 males presents a special case, where the eight-allele probabilities are inherited fully from the dam RI. QTL genome scans were performed by regression on the day 12 weight change on genotype probabilities for each of the eight founder strains using R (see Supplemental Material for executable code). A random-effect term was included in the model to account for kinship among animals. A LOD score for each marker was calculated from the likelihood ratio comparing the regression model described above to a regression model without the founder genotype probabilities. The statistical significance of LOD scores was determined via a permutation test. A threshold of p , 0.05 was used to select significant associations. DOQTL genotype probability files were generated with each animal having a unique genome probability entry. In this way, even animals from the same RIX would have individual (albeit identical) genome probability entries. This approach allowed us to assess both within-as well as between-strain phenotypic differences.",

HrW1 impacted day 12 weight loss (Figure 2, A and C). The Hrw1 aggregate peak contained 70 genes and microRNAs (excluding predicted genes). The genes under this locus include all the murine Oas genes as well as genes associated with biological pathways including actin cytoskeleton signaling, CD28 signaling in T helper cells, and integrin signaling (Table S1 and Table S2 ). The QTL peak sits over Oas1b. Based on previous mouse studies Mashimo et al. 2002; Ferguson et al. 2008; Kajaste-Rudnitski et al. 2006) , Oas1b is a known driver of disease phenotypes. To determine which of the eight strains in the CC were influencing the loci, we next looked at the founder effects driving this QTL.",

Haplotype effects are determined as the deviation from the population mean due to one copy of that founder allele at the locus. In this way, we can see that the wild-derived inbred strains CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WBS/EiJ ameliorate weight loss (higher value = less weight lost), whereas the five classic inbred strain alleles show enhanced weight loss (lower effects). These results are consistent with a previously reported analysis of Oas1b (Courtney et al. 2012) and on an individual's phenotype (weight percentage at day 12). The lower image shows the LOD score in the lower y-axis. The x-axis shows the locus in megabases at chromosome 5. Each colored line represents a different founder's predicted effect on phenotype.

The genes that flank the Oas cluster (Dtx1 and Rph3a) were identified as expressed compared to mock-infection in our heatmap. There are several genes whose expression was reduced (downregulated) independently of Oas signatures in the heterozygous F1s. Interestingly, Rasal1 appeared downregulated in CC(055x028)F1, which was previously observed with elevated viral load in the spleen and brain (Scherbik et al. 2006) , and this finding was confirmed with qPCR in the spleen at day 4 postinfection (see Materials and Methods). Rasal1 is an inhibitory regulator of the Ras-cyclic AMP pathway and is involved in dendrite formation (observed in melanocytes), intercellular signal transduction, and GTPase activity, and could be implicated in WNV disease. We also evaluated the expression of other Oas gene family members and found that the F1s with the largest induction of Oas genes were CC(017x004)F1 (F/F), CC(019x004)F1 (F/F), and CC(055x028)F1 (N/N). Oas1b is included in Figure 5 and was induced by WNV infection to be differentially regulated compared to mock, but was not always statistically different across infection time points after multiple statistical comparisons. Oasl1 (Oas-like gene 1), Oas3, and Oas1a were the most highly induced (upregulated) Oas gene family members across the panel. Oas1a and Oas1g, which are influential in viral detection and the innate immune response, were the next highest in expression. Oasl1 has been shown to regulate IRF7 production (Lee et al. 2013) . Oas3 was found upregulated in each F1 we screened using qPCR and transcriptomics in at least one time point except for N/N CC(090x040)F1, which had low gene expression levels. The importance of Oas3 in virus response is corroborated by a previous study that found that OAS3 displayed a higher affinity for dsRNA than OAS1 or OAS2, which indicated its contributive role in the antiviral response (Li et al. 2016) . Importantly, none of the significant Oas genes were suppressed or \"downregulated\" in our analyses. We validated our findings with qPCR in Oas target genes Oas1g, Oas2, and Oas3. Thus, our analysis of Oas gene family members is supportive of Oas genes playing a significant role in antiviral immunity.",

We first focused on the presence and absence of full-length Oas1b to reveal differences in gene module expression between the two groups. The immune response at day 2 postinfection (Figure 7 ) was impacted by Oas1b status. Immune pathways in F/F F1s were predominantly activated between days 2 and 4 postinfection. Aside from low level viral recognition, the N/N CC(006x007)F1 did not show significant activation in immune pathways until day 4 postinfection. By day 4 postinfection, several pathways were expressed in parallel, including pathways involving death receptor signaling, IFN response, toll like receptors, and viral recognition receptors, thus, marking the onset of the innate immune response. In contrast, STAT3 signaling was downregulated by day 4 postinfection in the F/F asymptomatic F1s, reflecting differential STAT3 signaling activity between the two groups. By day 7 postinfection, the N/N F1 profile marked a reduced transcriptional response within innate immune signaling pathways including NF-kb, and pattern recognition receptor signaling, possibly reflecting the progression of WNV infection out of the spleen onward to the CNS.",

Figure 9 represents the Oas1b allele from both parents (F/F), Figure 10 shows the network from Oas1b heterozygous (F/N), and Figure 11 shows the network from Oas1b homozygous nonfunctioning (N/N) mice. The F/F innate (day 2 postinfection) immune network (Figure 9 ) is comprised of Irf3, Irf7, Stat1, STAT2, Myc, and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family of proteins (PARP) response networks, and includes the Oas gene cluster. Irfs and Stats were the major hubs launching virus-responsive genes and ISG networks, along with the induction of the Oas pathway. IRF3/7 also connects with several pattern recognition receptors including DDX58 (the RLRs), IFIH1, and DDX60. PARP genes contribute to death receptor signaling and apoptosis while Mx1/Mx2 are ISGs involved in antiviral innate immunity against several viruses (Shaffer et al. 2001) . Antigen presentation is clearly activated, as indicated through network connections among the MHC class I family of genes. ABCF3 is connected by MYC (myelocytomatosis) and performs various roles in the cell, and has been identified as an Oas1b-binding protein of WNV control (Courtney et al. 2012) . IFIT1B and SNRPD3 (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein) connect to ORP1L, another Oas1bbinding protein. Thus, network analysis of F/F Oas1b mice reveals innate immune and antigen processing induction, OAS protein expression, and network interaction of known Oas1b-binding proteins in response to WNV associated with homozygous full-length Oas1b genotype.",

There are several connector hubs in this network driven by genes PLCG1, GRB2, and FYN. PLCG1 is involved in CD28 signaling in T helper cells and apoptosis. GRB2 is a growth factor receptor signaling-adaptor protein and is involved in a variety of cell signaling programs (Jang et al. 2009 ). Interestingly, ABCF3 is connected to GRPB2 through protein interactions with HIRIP3 (HIRA-interacting protein 3) and CSNK2A2 (casein kinase 2 a 2). It is believed that HIRIP3 functions as part of a multi-protein complex with roles in chromatin and histone metabolism. CSNK2A2 is a kinase, and has roles in apoptosis and G2/M phase cell cycling. ORP1L is connected to GRB2 through interactions with growth factor KITLG (Kit ligand). KITLG has several cellular roles including differentiation and apoptosis. The N/N network shares a STAT3 hub with the F/N network but its interaction partner is the FYN proto-oncogene (Src family tyrosine kinase family), which is involved in ATP binding as well as CD4 and CD8 receptor binding. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a well-documented immune signaling receptor, is downregulated. Taken together, these results link Oas1b haplotype with differential gene networks and WNV infection outcome.",

Our regulator network ( Figure 12 ) revealed that gene expression upregulation occurred predominantly in ISGs at day 2 postinfection. The network analysis determined activation of four transcriptional regulators (IRF3, IRF5, IRF7, and NCOA2).

Our study identifies new features of gene regulation linked with differential Oas1b genotypes within varied genetic backgrounds. This work also affirms the CC as a valuable tool for revealing the genetics of immune regulation and WNV control. CC mouse population is therefore an optimal model of virus infection amenable to defining genetic traits of disease outcome.",
