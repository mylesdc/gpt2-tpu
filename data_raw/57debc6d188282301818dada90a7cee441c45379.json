The former are NSP4-dependent, induce calcium-dependent chloride secretion and involve oxidative stress.

Electrical parameters may be used to measure the direct enterotoxic and cytotoxic effects in polar epithelial intestinal cells.

Pansini 5, 80131 Naples, Italy Full list of author information is available at the end of the article secretory diarrhoea and intestinal epithelial damage [12] . In the early phase of infection, RV directly induces chloride and water secretion in the intestinal lumen through the enterotoxic effects of the non-structural viral protein NSP4. This increases the intracellular Ca 2+ concentration and triggers electrogenic chloride secretion [12] [13] [14] . As recently reported, oxidative stress is a key mechanism in the enterotoxic effect induced by RV [14] . Following early ion secretion, RV infection results in severe damage to the structure of villi, with the disruption of epithelial integrity [15] .",

[20] described the anti-diarrhoeal effects of DS related to increased chloride and magnesium absorption in the rabbit ileal mucosa infected with enterotoxigenic E. coli. These effects were postulated to be due to the inhibition of mucolysis or to the attenuation of damage to the luminal surface of the intestinal mucosa. In addition, DS reduced interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) secretion and decreased neutrophil infiltration and monocyte activation, which both contributed to a reduction of the antigenic load in hapten-induced colitis in the rat [4] . Since IL-1\u03b2 induces chloride secretion [21] , it is possible that this anti-inflammatory effect contributes c Caco-2 cell monolayers were infected with RV, glutathione was evaluated 1 h following the infection, and the levels of GSH (grey) and GSSG (white) were measured. DS was present during the activation phase of the virus, as described in the \"Methods\". *p < 0.05 vs control; # p < 0.05 vs RV to the antidiarrhoeal mechanism of DS. However, such a mechanism cannot explain the effects observed with RV diarrhoea, which is not associated with intestinal inflammation.",

In this respect, it has been reported that DS acts as a physical barrier to toxic stimuli such as proinflammatory mediators [5] , facilitates the secretion of MUC2 into the colon and increases the thickness of mucus [4] .",

Although the remaining viral load was still sufficient to cause cell damage and spread infection in our model, the structural (cytotoxic) and functional (enterotoxic) consequences of RV infection were both strongly reduced. In particular, the number of Caco-2 cells infected with RV decreased in the presence of DS. In addition, the number of virions released in the culture medium was lower in cells infected with DS-treated RV rather than RV alone. This protective effect was maintained over three days following the infection. We therefore suggest that the anti-diarrhoeal effects of DS against RV are associated with a specific capacity of this clay to bind the virus, thus blocking both viral replication and the pathogenic effects of NSP4.",

RV is the main agent of infantile diarrhoea and is by far the most dangerous. However, DS is clinically effective against diarrhoea irrespective of the aetiology [11] , and there is a need to understand whether the mechanisms described in this paper, which essentially consists of trapping viral particles and blocking downstream pathogenic events, may explain a more general effect against enteric pathogens. In addition to classic enterotoxic pathogens, several agents induce diarrhoea in all or in part by enterotoxic moieties, including Cryptosporidium and HIV virus [22] . If these results are also confirmed with these agents, an entirely new understanding of the antidiarrhoeal effects of DS may open new options for treating diarrhoea. This may also include inflammatory diarrhoea, as the latter is induced by endogenous secretagogues, particularly inflammatory cytokines or others inflammatory gut disease [23] . Clinical evidence of an effect by DS in inflammatory diarrhoea has been reported [11] . Similar considerations apply to endocrine diarrhoea and diarrhoea due to radiotherapy.",
