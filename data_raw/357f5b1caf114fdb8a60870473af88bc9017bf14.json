Extremely high levels of non-specific psychological distress were reported by respondents in this study, with 34% reporting high psychological distress (K10 > 22), compared to levels of around 12% in the Australian general population. Analysis, using backward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis, revealed that those living in high risk infection (red) zones (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.57-2.55; p < 0.001) and disease buffer (amber) zones (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.36-2.46; p < 0.001) were at much greater risk of high psychological distress than those living in uninfected (white zones). Although prevalence of high psychological distress was greater in infected EI zones and States, elevated levels of psychological distress were experienced in horse-owners nationally. Statistical analysis indicated that certain groups were more vulnerable to high psychological distress; specifically younger people, and those with lower levels of formal educational qualifications. Respondents whose principal source of income was from horse-related industry were more than twice as likely to have high psychological distress than those whose primary source of income was not linked to horse-related industry (OR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.82-2.73; p < 0.001).",

Although EI was not detected in other States and Territories, stringent disease control procedures were put in place across all States; which included an initial stand-still of all horse movements and subsequent controls, movement restrictions, and biosecurity requirements for many months. Colour-coded EI control zones were established within four weeks of the outbreak based on the level of disease/disease risk in Local Government Areas in NSW and Qld; these were adjusted as the disease spread, and each zone was subject to specific controls and restrictions. Controls were reviewed, revised and expanded as the disease spread, subsequent disease containment and control progressed, and policies were revised. These zones are summarized in Table 1 . Further details of the outbreak, restrictions and zoning are available via the NSW Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI) and Qld. Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries (DPI&F) websites [2, 3] . Throughout the outbreak movement restrictions and biosecurity requirements remained in place, and no (or very limited) horse movement was ever allowed from higher risk zones to lower risk zones.",

In the UK higher 'caseness' as indicated by the GHQ(G) was found in farmers from 'badly infected' areas, although higher psychological morbidity generally, was reported in farmers from both badly infected and unaffected areas [9] .",

These authors report several aspects of relevance to the current study, including the increasing role of horses as companion animals as opposed to livestock or economic investments, and hence an increasing emotional attachment to horses; the complex and dynamic emotional relationship between farmers and their livestock; the emotional and practical implications of the animal-human relationship in disaster management, e.g. compliance with disaster management behaviours; and the impacts on veterinarians as first responders in disasters. These authors conclude that recognizing the mental health aspects of the animalhuman bond is an important factor in public health approaches to disaster and can be critical in promoting the resilience of individuals and communities. Therefore, it follows that in an animal-centred disease outbreak, such as EI affecting horses, the potential disruption of the animal-human bond, and the impact of policies restricting animal-human activities could have significant implications for the mental health and resilience of those affected.",

Thus, a minimum score is 10, indicating no psychological distress, and a maximum score is 50, indicating the most severe level of psychological distress.

The prevalence of 'very high' psychological distress in this sample was approaching five times the level reported in recent population health data for NSW [24] . Although this prevalence is very high, and there are some methodological reasons why this may be distorted (see study limitations section) it is certainly true that many of those impacted by EI, or the threat of EI, were subject to a wide range of acute stressors over a prolonged period, in a country where EI and such rigorous disease containment and control measures were previously unknown.",

Those in the areas where EI was present had higher risk of high psychological distress, furthermore, risks were higher in areas where EI was more active or threatening and the tightest levels of disease control were in place (i.e. red and amber/buffer zones). This finding suggests high levels of anticipatory anxiety. Interestingly, the risks of higher psychological distress in the purple zone (the region in NSW with the highest infection rate and earliest infections) were lower than in the red and amber areas. It is probable that during the timing of the study EI was more of a 'known' threat to those in the purple zone and there would have been some habituation to this risk; with many properties already infected or recovering, and restrictions eased due to the decision to let EI 'run its course' in this area at that time.",

There are probably a number of reasons for this effect: Victoria has a very extensive horse industry and is geographical closer to the infected States and diseaseaffected areas of NSW and Qld; there is also a high level of business interaction and physical movement of horses between Victoria and NSW and Qld; hence the level of proximal threat and the degree of disruption caused by disease control measures was probably experienced more widely in Victoria and may explain some of this effect. It should also be noted that although the remaining States were similarly uninfected, the overall prevalence of high psychological distress in horse owners from these States was still far higher than in the general population; those uninfected were not unaffected.",

Those in the 16-24 year age category reported the highest levels of high psychological distress and analysis indicated that although prevalence and comparative risks of high psychological distress reduced from age 24 onwards, these reduced risks only became reliably statistically significant from age 45 onwards, and high psychological distress was certainly still a risk to those in the 35-44 year age category. This is interesting because in the general population psychological distress is generally found to peak around middle age (40s-50s). The study findings would suggest that younger people were particularly vulnerable and were coping less well with the consequences of EI. The reasons for this finding are not known, however, research literature suggests that younger people form stronger emotional attachments to animals [28] , and they are also less likely to be resilient or practised, generally, when it comes to coping with adversity. From the general perspective of mental and physical health of younger people, it is interesting to consider the longer term consequences and potential burden of disease if these effects are enduring.",

These data were reported as part of the sample description to illustrate the wide range of industries affected by EI and the complexity of the affected population, and to provide information to aid interpretation of the findings. The nature of the potential psychological impacts of EI on those in different sectors is extremely diverse; from purely economic impacts, to loss of leisure pursuits and disruption of social networks, to loss of futures and missed opportunities in time, and many other possible impacts. Time, money and support will help most recover but it is possible that some people's mental and physical health will be permanently affected by EI and some will take many years to recover professionally if they choose to stay in these professions.",

Considering distress and risk perception in relation to human epidemics; it is likely that psychological distress would be far greater, since these present a threat to human health and possibly death. Certainly data collected during and after SARS in Hong Kong found high levels of fear and PTSD in health care workers and hospital workers [30] , and high levels of emotional disturbance in the general population [31] .

Firstly, the target population; those affected by EI, is a complex, disparate, and unknown population and therefore it is difficult to comment accurately on the representativeness of the sample. All horse owners in Australia are not registered on a centralized database, or otherwise controlled, and as a result, it is not possible to know how extensive the database used to access horse owners (the HECD) was. However, at a national cross-industry sector level it is believed that this was the most extensive and efficient online route to access the target population, and the use of the database as a central communication facility during the EI crisis meant that this was likely to have been a focus for those affected during the epidemic.",

The high proportion of women in the sample may be due to greater interest and participation in studies of this nature, but may also be indicative of higher levels of females in the target population, in particular in the main industry sectors represented in the data, i.e. recreational and equestrian. There are no official statistics on gender breakdown across horse industry sub-populations in Australia, but data indicate that the equestrian sector in the United States may comprise 80% women [33] , so the gender bias may reflect a gender bias in the main industry sub-populations in our data. Research data often report higher levels of psychological distress in women in the general population, and therefore, the gender demographic bias in our study might have led to an elevation in the levels of psychological distress reported in this study. However, the absence of a significant gender effect in this study, and the close matching of relative levels of psychological distress in men and women with data from the Australian general population, suggests that EI, as an adversity, was exerting similar impacts on males and females. It is not possible to explain why there was an absence of a gender difference in the data. One possible explanation is that the timing of the study; around the height of the EI epidemic, and the high levels of psycho-logical distress generally, reflected peak, acute levels in which gender differences were minimised and insignificant.",

Also, those experiencing higher distress may have been more motivated to respond. The extent of this response bias on the data cannot be accurately estimated, however, in anticipation of potential response bias, actions were taken to ensure that the study was presented to potential respondents in a way that would minimize such effects; e.g. the study was presented as independent of any industry group or government organization and it was clearly identified as a university research study.
