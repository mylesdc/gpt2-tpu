Given the high cost and time requirements for new drugs development, vaccines remain as a viable alternative, but there too traditional techniques of live-attenuated or inactivated vaccines have the danger of allergenic reactions and others. Peptide vaccines have, over the last several years, begun to be looked on as more appropriate alternatives, which are economically affordable, require less time for development and hold the promise of multi-valent dosages. The developments in bioinformatics, proteomics, immunogenomics, structural biology and other sciences have spurred the growth of vaccinomics where computer assisted approaches serve to identify suitable peptide targets for eventual development of vaccines. In this mini-review we give a brief overview of some of the recent trends in computer assisted vaccine development with emphasis on the primary selection procedures of probable peptide candidates for vaccine development.",

Annually, dengue virus disease affects about 50 to 100 million people globally with 9000+ fatalities [1] , rotavirus infects about two million children under five years of age, of whom about 527,000 die [2] , seasonal influenza epidemics cause severe illness in three to five million people, and a quarter to a half million deaths [3] , just to name a few. While drugs and vaccines are available for many of the viral diseases, the high mutation rate characteristic of viral genomes renders many of these rapidly obsolete. There is thus a continuous hunt for new drugs and vaccines, and this is compounded by the fact that new viruses are coming up to attack human hosts with higher frequency, while mutability of viral sequences rapidly render existing drugs and vaccines obsolete. Among the latest incidents of viral epidemics, one may recall the H1N1 (Influenza A type with Hemagglutinin subtype 1 and Neuraminidase subtype 1) swine flu pandemic of 2009, the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic of 2002-2003 [4] , the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic of 2015 [5] , the Ebola epidemic of 2014-2015 with 28,639 cases and 11,316 deaths reported until 16 March 2016 [6] , the dengue epidemics in India of 2015, and now, in 2016, the Zika virus epidemic in South America.",

Another conventional vaccine is the inactivated vaccine, which is produced by killing the original virus through heat or chemicals and then introducing the remaining virus shell into the host body. The shell, the virion capsid, when properly manufactured, retains enough of the original capsid to elicit immune response. Some varieties of polio vaccines and influenza vaccines are produced in this way. Improper manufacturing can retain some of the original virus and cause infections, and there are other problems, such as need for booster doses, etc., as well.",

The idea is to scan the viral genome for the protein antigens that can elicit an immune response and then synthesize them into a peptide vaccine. A more focused approach is to precisely locate the epitope regions within these antigens and utilize them to elicit the immune response [14] . The recent advancements in the technological and bioinformatics fields enable computer-based approaches for this purpose. Peptide vaccines have been in use against animals for some time. The first reported success was with the virulent canine parovirus [15] , stimulating development of other peptide vaccines against diseases, such as malaria [16] and classical swine fever virus [17] in animals, and vaccines for humans are in various stages of trials [18] . Recombinant DNA technology and naked DNA have been used to induce immune response against virus infections; synthetic peptide vaccines have been the other approach in peptide vaccinology [19] . These have prompted adaptations along similar lines to develop vaccines for new viruses; the NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases), under the NIH (National Institute of Health), USA, has taken up the case of the Zika virus with urgency and is pursuing several paths, including a DNA-based vaccine using a strategy similar to that of a flavivirus vaccine for West Nile Virus, a live-attenuated version of the Zika virus and a genetically engineered version of vesicular stomatitis virus, all of them are presently on the lab bench [20] .",

[24] determined several B-cell and T-cell epitope regions in Fasciola hepatica virus protein amino acid sequences using bioinformatics analyses; immunization of BALB/c mice (an albino, laboratory-bred strain of the House Mouse widely used in animal experiments) with synthetic peptides showed a high level of protection against the disease. A phase I trial of a multivalent peptide vaccine against non-small cell lung cancer found the vaccine using a mixture of four peptides to be safe and capable of generating strong T-cell responses [25] .

            "text": "The recent advances in bioinformatics, proteomics, immunoinformatics, structural biology and others have led to vaccinomics [29] and reverse vaccinology [30, 31] as novel approaches for a generation of new vaccines. In the realm of drug development, scientific and technological advances have led to powerful inhibitors like Relenza for influenza being developed from the neuraminidase crystal structure [32] and AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) drugs, such as Aegenerase and Viracept, being developed from a structure-based design approach [33] . Advances in peptide-based vaccines have come from a better understanding of immunogenetics, antigenic MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) binding peptides, HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) binding motifs, and others. The NIH website of database of clinical studies of human participants [18] lists 559 peptide vaccines under various phases of trial and development, the vast majority of them (438) related to cancers. They include a recombinant protein comprising nine conserved peptides from influenza A and B as anti-influenza peptide vaccine in a phase IIb study [34] , a phase I study of another influenza vaccine [35] , a multi-peptide mix with adjuvant of newly discovered conserved segments from a HIV-1 protein to augment the body's natural immunity with a broader, more rationally-designed immunity inducer [36] , a phase 1 study by the Mayo Clinic [37] of combining a vaccine therapy with chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide) expecting higher efficiency in killing tumor cells, an ongoing phase 1 study by the US National Cancer Institute of peptide vaccines in treating patients with metastatic cancer who have not responded to previous therapy [38] , among others. Singluff [39] , in fact, had reported that peptide vaccines have shown good promise in the case of many cancers, and a mixture of peptides evokes a good immune response in 100% of the patients. Table 1 lists a few more peptide vaccine projects in various phases of clinical trials [18] . The large number of trials being undertaken by so many commercial firms and academic-and health-related institutions suggests the potential of, and interest in, peptide vaccines. Phase II Identifier: NCT02691130 in [18] The rising interest in peptide vaccines has drawn many reviews [9, 19, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] , which may be referred to for the various aspects of this promising field. We are interested here in reviewing different approaches to one important step in the process of designing peptide vaccines, viz., choice of the protein and peptide segments. This is a crucial first step in the process, and good reliable results, firstly, require adequate molecular level data for each virus, and, second, a reliable technique to analyze the data to identify sequence segments of interest for the vaccine development purpose. Computer-based methodologies are the primary modus operandi here, as we had remarked in a recent article [45] . In this review, we elaborate on the bioinformatics and analytical approaches that have been used to pinpoint the peptide segments of choice.",

In silico screening of genomic information has reduced the workload of experimentalists with more focused goals. A number of server-based tools are available for prediction of probable antigenic sites, and their success is dependent on the accuracy of their predictions. While most approaches use sequence alignment to identify antigens, this approach has its limitations since some proteins may have additions, deletions and/or substitutions, but similar functions within the overall structure of the sequence, and these methods obviously cannot predict new and hitherto unrecognized antigens. This has given rise to alignment-free approaches, as in VaxiJen [46] , which is based on auto cross-covariance, allowing for antigen classification solely based on the physicochemical properties of proteins collected from bacterial, viral, and tumor protein datasets.",

[50] investigated a computational approach for the design of peptide vaccines against human coronavirus (HCoV), which causes upper respiratory tract infections and led to the SARS epidemic early this century. They presented 56 strains of the HCoV spike protein to the VaxiJen 2.0 server and selected the one with the highest antigenicity index for the next analysis of epitope-prediction for T-cell response. Selecting five peptides with the highest epitope scores from the protein, based on the results from the NetCTL 1.2 server [51], which predicts CTL (Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes) epitopes in protein sequences, they identified a 9 mer epitope, KSSTGFVYF amino acid sequence (a nonapeptide chain containing the following sequence of nine amino acids from left to right: lysine, serine, serine, threonine, glycine, phenylalanine, valine, tyrosine, phenylalanine), to interact with most MHC-I alleles with high affinity. They next determined the conservancy of the B-cell epitopes from the IEDB (Immune Epitope Database) server [26] and allergenicity from the AllerHunter tool and found this epitope to have 64.29% conservancy and an allergencity score well below threshold value. The next step was a molecular docking analysis, of the selected peptide with HLA-B*15:01, which was found to show good binding. A B-cell epitope search using the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar [27] antigenicity prediction method showed seven regions with high antigenic scores, which was reduced to three after solvent accessibility determination through the Emini surface accessibility option from the IEDB Analysis Resource.

The next step was to discard those that had a hydrophobicity exceeding 50%, implying reduced propensity to surface exposure and, therefore, to antigen-antibody interaction, and ensure that those retained had high antigenicity, as determined through a web server like VaxiJen; the highest antigenicity (1.4911, as per VaxiJen) and low hydrophobicity (33.33%) was scored by the peptide FAGHLKCRL (amino acid sequence reading from left to right: phenylalanine, alanine, glycine, histidine, leucine, lysine, cysteine, arginine, leucine) out of the six total peptides recommended.",

This has proven to be especially useful in virus-related studies, where the numerical measures have aided various studies, such as virus transmission paths [55] , prognosis of possible reassortments in H5N2 bird flu [50, 56] , and phylogenetic analyses [57] . Ghosh et al. [58, 59] used such alignment-free sequence descriptors to identify conserved peptides in viral protein sequences. The method is to scan each protein sequence by a window of 8/12/14 amino acids as required and consider the sequence descriptors in each window at each position for all the protein sequences and determine the regions with least variability. These regions, therefore, imply evolutionary pressures to retain their structure and, consequently, are relatively mostly conserved. These conserved stretches are analyzed for their hydrophilicity to determine the surface situated peptides, which are then confirmed through the protein 3D structures. The next step is to determine which ones have T-cell and B-cell epitopes, following which the retained peptides are tested for auto-immune threats. The remaining peptides that pass all these tests are reported to be good candidates to act as peptide vaccines.",

Almeida et al. [66] reported a strong immune response when using gold nano-particles as adjuvants in an ovalbumin peptide antigen leading to anti-tumor activity.
