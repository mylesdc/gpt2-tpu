In particular, there is no pre-existing vector immunity, construction and manufacturing is rapid, and candidate DNA vaccines have been extremely stable and safe [1] . However, DNA vaccine immuno-genicity in humans has been less than expected from preclinical studies in mice and monkeys. The basis for this is not fully known, but it is likely that inefficient transfection, particularly through the plasma and nuclear membranes of host cells, is a major factor.",

A number of steps have been taken to optimize protein expression including codon modification, altered promoters, translation enhancer motifs, and other changes to the plasmid backbone [10] . A variety of doses have been explored, and early in the program a decision was made to use the needle-free BiojectorH device based on published reports of BiojectorH delivery improving the antibody response to DNA vaccines in animals [11] and humans [12, 13] compared to delivery by needle and syringe (N/ S). In particular, vaccine studies for WNV [6, 8] , influenza [9] , and HIV [14] [15] [16] [17] have demonstrated favorable properties of DNA immunization that merit further development. Three doses of a WNV DNA vaccine expressing the prM and E proteins induced substantial neutralizing antibody responses comparable to those seen in horses known to be protected [6, 8] . In the influenza program, a single dose of H5 influenza HA DNA vaccine primed a four-fold increase in HAI antibody titers in .80% of subjects following a single 6 month boost with unadjuvanted inactivated H5N1 vaccine compared to 2 doses of inactivated H5N1 vaccine [9] . This concept is now being evaluated in Phase II studies using seasonal influenza vaccines. In the HIV vaccine development program, DNA primed broad and durable T cell responses and consistent antibody responses following boosting with rAd5 [15] [16] [17] [18] . This regimen is now being evaluated in the HVTN 505 Phase IIb test-of-concept study to determine efficacy. Given the progression of DNA vaccines into advanced clinical trials it is important to understand how delivery approaches may contribute to their immunogenicity.",

Randomization sequence was obtained by the statistician using computer-generated random numbers and was stratified by Ad5Ab titer as positive or negative to achieve balance across study groups. Within each stratum of Ad5Ab titer, five subjects were assigned to each combination of factors (DNA administration device and rAd5 booster dose) completely at random. The DNA administration device became known to both clinicians and subjects after completion of an electronic enrollment in the study database, while the dose of rAd5 vaccine remained blinded to all except the statistician and pharmacist until after the safety data collection following the rAd5 vaccine boost was completed.",

Local reactogenicity of the DNA injections was further documented by clinician assessments and photographs 3 days after injection. Laboratory and clinical followup continued through Week 42.

The primary objective related to safety of the vaccination regimens and secondary objectives related to immune responses at 4 weeks after the 3 rd DNA vaccine and 6 weeks after the rAd5 vaccine boost were the basis for the sample size.

Measures of positive T-cell response are defined by both a statistical test and a minimum magnitude threshold. Specifically, for ELISpot, a positive response is defined as at least 59 SFC per million PBMC and a non-background corrected mean that is at least 4 fold greater than the mean negative stimulation for the sample. For ICS, a positive response was defined as one with both a p-value of ,0.01 from a Fisher's Exact Test and a backgroundsubtracted magnitude that exceeded a pre-specified threshold. The pre-specified threshold was based on validation of negative samples and was allowed to vary for different peptides. For CD4+ cells, a value of.045 was used for all peptides; for CD8+ cells, the threshold was.07 for Env C,.058 for Gag B, and.045 for all other peptides. For ELISA, a positive response is defined as any measure with end-point titer $30. All comparisons of proportions between arms are done using Fisher's Exact Test; paired comparisons within individuals were done using Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests (post-DNA response compared to rAd5 vector boosting).

When present, these lesions were primarily observed on days 2-4 following vaccination and were not observed by clinicians or subjects after the 60 N/S DNA vaccine injections. After rAd5 injections, there were 4 reactogenicity events that met study criteria for prompt review by the safety monitoring team. These were grade 3 fever (maximum temperature 39.9uC) within the first day after injection, and 3 episodes of erythema or induration with maximum diameter .9 cm for which the onset 3 to 5 days post injection and duration averaged 4 days. The overall reactogenicity of the DNA vaccine by BiojectorH as compared to N/S injection and of rAd5 vaccinations at 10 10 PU dose as compared to 10 11 PU dose is shown in Tables 2 and 3 . The reactogenicity events resolved without sequelae and were consistent with earlier Phase I experience with the study vaccines [4, 19] . After the rAd5 vaccine, 2/19 (10.5%) at the 10 10 PU dosage as compared to 11/20 (55%; p = .006) at the 10 11 PU dosage had a pattern of moderate to severe systemic reactogenicity; which except for one case had acute onset in the first 24 hours after injection and frequently was accompanied by fever. There was no evident difference in the incidence of moderate to severe reactogenicity by pre-existing Ad5 antibody titer [7/20 (35%) in low titer group compared to 6/19 (32%) in high titer group].",

Vaccine-Induced Sero-Positivity/Sero-Reactivity (VISP/R) through Study Week 42. vaccines parenterally. While deposition may be controlled to be primarily intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous, or intradermal, IM injection delivers the injectate to all layers of the skin and subcutaneous tissues as it is propelled into muscle in a conical distribution. It has been speculated that needle-free injection devices may improve immunogenicity because of broader dispersion of the injectate than N/S [27] . A study in guinea pigs showed that BiojectorH delivery compared to N/S increased the uptake of DNA plasmids in muscle and skin cells near the injection site [28] . Vaccine delivery with needle-free devices has also been reported to have an association with increased local inflammation and may enhance immunogenicity through recruitment of immunocompetent inflammatory cells [12, 13, [29] [30] [31] [32] . Although the basic mechanisms by which BiojectorH delivery improves the potency of DNA vaccination are unknown, it is consistent with increased transfection frequency and greater antigen production. This could be related to the ballistic nature of the injection or due to the dispersal pattern that essentially increases the number of cells exposed to DNA molecules compared to needle injection in which much of the injectate pools in the needle track. DNA has been delivered by other needle-free devices in clinical trials. The Powderject TM system uses compressed helium to project DNA in the form of dry powder through the skin. Another device, the ''gene gun'', was developed exclusively for DNA delivery. It uses compressed helium to shoot nanoparticle-sized gold balls coated with DNA into the skin. DNA immunization by either device has elicited immune responses, but they have not been compared directly to N/S delivery, and neither device is currently licensed. BiojectorH is a hand-held, portable, easy to use, FDA-approved device for IM delivery of clinical products, including injections for children. Other approaches are being developed to improve DNA vaccine transfection efficiency. Electroporation has been shown to significantly improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in nonhuman primates [33] , although the results in human studies to date have been modest [34] .",
