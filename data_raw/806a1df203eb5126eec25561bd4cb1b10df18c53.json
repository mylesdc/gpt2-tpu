Here, we describe the in vivo variability and evolution of the BK polyomavirus by deep sequencing. Our data reveal the highest genomic evolutionary rate described in double-stranded DNA viruses, i.e., 10 \u22123 -10 \u22125 substitutions per nucleotide site per year. High mutation rates in viruses allow their escape from immune surveillance and adaptation to new hosts. By combining mutational landscapes across viral genomes with in silico prediction of viral peptides, we demonstrate the presence of significantly more coding substitutions within predicted cognate HLA-C-bound viral peptides than outside. This finding suggests a role for HLA-C in antiviral immunity, perhaps through the action of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors. The present study provides a comprehensive view of viral evolution and immune escape in a DNA virus.",

Furthermore, the prediction of viral peptides to determine immune escape suggests a specific role of HLA-C in antiviral immunity. These findings are helpful for future advances in antiviral therapies and provide a step forward in our understanding of in vivo viral evolution in humans.",

            "text": "Introduction Viral evolutionary rates can vary strongly depending on the method used to estimate them [1, 2] . Among Baltimore groups, the fastest evolving entities are single-stranded (ss) RNA and reverse-transcribing (RT) viruses, with rates ranging between 10 \u22122 and 10 \u22125 substitutions per site per year (s/s/y). The rates of double-stranded (ds) RNA and ssDNA viruses range between 10 \u22123 and 10 \u22126 s/s/y, whereas dsDNA viruses evolve more slowly (10 \u22123 and 10 \u22128 s/s/y) [3, 4] . It is important to note that only few estimates on dsDNA viruses are published. In fact, higher estimates are based on specific genes, as estimated for human papillomavirus 16 (E6 and E7), human adenovirus (hexon), or JC virus (VP1), which are in the order of 10 \u22123 s/s/y [4, 5] . Regarding estimates based on dsDNA complete genomes, all of them range between 10 \u22125 and 10 \u22127 s/s/y [3, 5] . This finding confirms that viruses are fast evolving entities whereas humans have much lower evolutionary rates (10 \u22128 -10 \u22129 s/s/y). However, the well-established co-divergence of viral populations with their hosts suggests the possibility of low evolutionary rates in viruses as well. For example, polyomaviruses were historically considered to be examples of human-virus co-divergence, and have been used as markers for human migration patterns, with proposed estimates ranging from 1.41 \u00d7 10 \u22127 to 4 \u00d7 10 \u22128 s/s/y [6, 7] . Detailed studies are needed to better understand dsDNA virus evolution in vivo, especially in viruses that can be considered as potential pathogens.",

Despite a few recent reports [8, 9] , limited information is presently available on the extent of viral variability in vivo, especially at the whole viral genome level, and only a few studies have tackled this variability in conjunction with the HLA genotype of infected individuals. Consequently, viral escape mutants-i.e., viruses that produce mutated peptides that are no longer able to bind to cognate HLA molecules-have been mainly studied for limited model epitopes in in vitro systems and in highly relevant RNA viruses such as HIV, HCV, influenza or dengue (see the following historical references [10, 11] ; for a recent review and full bibliography on the subject see [12] ). It is not surprising that RNA viruses can adapt to circumvent the immune responses [4] , but little is known about viral escape in DNA viruses.",

A retrospective cohort of 96 patients-225 samples-that underwent solid organ (N = 83) or hematopoietic cell transplantations (N = 13), harboring a minimum of 10 4 viral copies/mL in whole blood or urine, was selected. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the viral titers in blood (8.98 \u00d7 10 4 \u00b1 2.47 \u00d7 10 4 copies/mL) were significantly lower than those in urine (2.16 \u00d710 9 \u00b1 3.94 \u00d7 10 8 copies/mL) (Mann-Whitney U = 315.0, two-tailed, P < 0.0001).

Here, we present evidence that BKV is under strong purifying selection even in the immunocompromised host. Several specific features of the Polyomaviridae (e.g., limited size of the genome, small number of genes and overlapping transcription units) likely account for this outcome. In addition, the prevalence of purifying selection in essential genes is anticipated in all viruses as there is a requirement to complete the viral cycle, even in immunocompromised hosts. Most mutations in coding regions must be deleterious, and a high substitution rate implies the accumulation of mutations with deleterious effects [18] . This phenomenon is well known in RNA viruses, which have high mutation rates and short replication times. Similar results have been shown comparing mutational fitness effects and evolution in ssRNA and ssDNA viruses [19, 20] . Our study supports the hypothesis, in concordance with other recent findings [21] , that the evolutionary rate gap between small dsDNA and RNA viruses might not be as wide as previously thought. A recent study in lentiviruses has revealed that the combined effects of sequence saturation and purifying selection can explain the time-dependent pattern of rate variation. Purifying selection acts on the genetic diversity over long timeframes by removing a large number of transient deleterious mutations that are still present within short timeframes [4] .",

Limited differences (short branch lengths) between the previously designated genotypes II and III suggested the existence of only one genotype II/III with two subtypes (in contrast to more pronounced differences between serotypes II and III). A similar phylogenetic classification was observed by analyzing only the VP1 gene ( Fig 2B) . Incidentally, this finding indicated that the current BKV classification should be revised due to inconsistencies between serotyping and genotyping. Next, to establish the genotype of our samples, one reference strain of each genotype and subtype was used for the phylogenetic analysis ( Fig 2C) . Most of our samples (80.88%) belonged to genotype I, whereas genotypes IV and II/III were less represented (13.78% and 5.3% respectively). The clustering was patient-dependent but independent of the sample origin (urine or blood) and suggested that some samples likely contained a mixture of genotypes.

No differences between substitution rates in solid organ and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients were found (t-test, P = 0.2581).

However, when the dataset was reduced to the sequences of genotype I (n = 56) the average evolutionary rate was estimated at 1.33 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (95% CI = 3.13 \u00d710 \u22126 -5.59 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ).

It is usually assumed that RNA viruses evolve at a rate of 10 \u22124 s/s/y, while dsDNA can be close to 10 \u22128 s/s/y [23] . ssDNA viruses with small genomes evolving at rates similar to those of RNA viruses have been reported previously [24, 25] , as illustrated by the canine parvovirus, with a substitution rate of 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22124 s/s/y [26] . In the case of dsDNA, many evolutionary rates have been calculated under the assumption of co-divergence between viral and human populations, as observed for polyomaviruses. Recently, the substitution rate for JC polyomavirus was evaluated at 1.7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 s/s/y [27] . Based on this result, Bayesian analyses suggested the substitution rate of BKV to be on the order of 10 \u22125 s/s/y [5, 28] , while another study found only minor nucleotide substitutions in the genes encoding late proteins [29] .",

Our experimental results show, for the first time using whole-genome sequencing of in vivo viral populations (in a large monocentric cohort), that the genomic evolutionary rate of a dsDNA virus can be as high as that of RNA viruses. It is important to note that the sampling window of sequences may affect the estimates of evolutionary rates, because very short timescales can inflate them. A recent study has shown that estimates of evolutionary rates were lower for broader sampling levels and longer timeframes for both, DNA and RNA viruses, suggesting that the time dependence of substitution rates is ubiquitous among all viruses [4] . For example, lentivirus evolutionary rates from serial samples over a few years within a single patient or host are in the order of 10 \u22123 s/s/y [30], reflecting those observed in this study in a small dsDNA virus.",

Here, we show that small dsDNA genomes can also evolve as fast as single-stranded ones. Although BKV uses the host DNA polymerase for its replication, the virally-encoded Agnoprotein inhibits dsDNA break repair activity, thereby potentially increasing the error rate during BKV DNA replication [71] . Interestingly, cell tropism of RNA viruses was recently suggested as a key factor in their capacity to evolve, since viruses replicating in epithelial cells (as BKV) are characterized by rapid replication and higher substitution rates [72] .",

This difference in contribution of HLA loci was independent of the transplantation type (solid organ or hematopoietic) or the origin of the HLA loci (whether from the donor or the recipient) as assessed by a three-way ANOVA (P = 0.7947). Therefore, our results suggest that HLA-C might be specifically involved in the immune response against BKV through its peptide selection capacity for viral peptides. A possible mechanistic explanation for this finding stems from the amply documented interaction of HLA-C with natural killer (NK) and T cells expressing the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). Notably, the relevance of KIR and HLA-C interactions has been described for viral infections [73, 74] , and the involvement of NK cells in the immune response against BKV has also been reported [75, 76] , although further investigations should be done to confirm this hypothesis.",

Our results suggest that small dsDNA viruses should be treated as RNA viruses due to their similarities in evolution and immune escape.

TempEst analysis was conducted to detect a correlation between genetic divergence and sampling time, and it assured a temporal signal in our inter-patient dataset (S2 Fig) [84] . We used Bayesian estimates of the evolutionary rate with dated tips as implemented in BEAST [85] . Based on previous results by Firth et al.

A lognormalPrior with a mean of 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and a standard deviation of 1.0 was used for the substitution rate. Two independent runs of 30 million steps with 10% burn-in were used to obtain the median and 95% high probability density intervals for the relevant parameters in each model. In all cases, the effective sample size was > 200, as checked with Tracer v. 1.5 (available from http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk).",

IC 50 values represent the concentration of the peptide that will displace 50% of a standard peptide from the HLA molecule. The lower the IC 50 value, the stronger is the affinity of the peptide for the tested HLA molecule. According to the NetMHC parameters, peptides with IC 50 < 50 nM were considered high-affinity binders. IC 50 values of 5 nM and 500 nM were also tested, but a cutoff of 50 nM was chosen as the best indicator (at a 5 nM threshold not enough peptides were predicted to bind; at 500 nM all possible peptides within a given proteins were predicted to bind). Furthermore, all predicted epitopes were tested with NetChop 3.1 [89] to predict whether the epitopes could have been produced by the human proteasome using default parameters. All strong binding peptides with a high likelihood of being correctly cleaved (score prediction higher than the default threshold of 0.5) were included in further analyses.",
