Moreover, the prevalence of IBV was recorded highest in aged chicken at 41-60 weeks, which was 54.55% in layer, 27.27% in Sonali, and, afterward, 14.68% was found in broiler breeder, respectively.

Samples that were found high positive in IBV RT-PCR (Ct value below 30) were subjected to inoculation into chicken egg embryo to observe characteristic changes in chicken embryo. Swabs and organ samples were processed and passaged in 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs through allantoic cavity route. IBV virus suspected samples inoculated into chicken egg embryos after 3-5 passages showed dwarfing and curling of the embryos which are characteristic lesions of IBV. Allantoic fluid was collected from all inoculated eggs and performed partial sequencing of S1 gene for three isolates. After sequencing, the phylogenetic tree was constructed from the nucleotide sequences of IBV isolates. Two of the isolates are 4/91 IBV and another one matched with QX-like IBV.",

It also generates 13% of foreign currency and provides 20% fulltime employment and 45% partial employment of rural population [2] . However, it is the matter of regret that poultry industry in Bangladesh continuously facing challenges in several ways. Increased prevalence of disease outbreaks which reemergence of various pathogens with higher virulence due to constant natural evolution of variant strains as a result of recombination of virus and frequent use of live vaccine are the main reasons for such challenges [3, 4] .",

IBV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the genus Gamma coronavirus [10] . The spike (S) glycoprotein is cleaved into two smaller proteins, namely S1 (amino-terminal component) and S2 (carboxy-terminal component). The S1 portion has two hypervariable regions which cause virus neutralization and serotype-specific antigenic determinants that are responsible for binding to the host cell, neutralization, and immune response [11] and also important for involving pathogenicity of the virus to the host [12] .",

Mortality rates as high as 40%-90% were observed in affected chicks [14, 15] . The disease is transmitted through the air-borne, mechanical transmission between birds, houses, and farms. Air-borne transmission mainly occurs through aerosol and mechanical transmission occurs by personal contact, material, and equipment sharing in between farm and flock. Confirmatory diagnosis of IB can be achieved by a number of tests including agar gel precipitation test, hemagglutination inhibition, and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay. The more traditional methods used to determine the serotype of the virus include virus isolation and neutralization tests which are being fast replaced with rapid, specific, and confirmatory tests such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism [16] . The virus isolation is usually performed in specific pathogen free (SPF) 9-11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) [17] . RT-PCR has been used mostly for determining field strain of IBV. The antigenic variation of spike protein, especially S1 subunit protein, is determined by nucleotide sequencing method [7] .",

Of three types of chicken, commercial layer chickens were the highest (42.22%) prevalence of IBV and lowest prevalence was in broiler chickens. For other two types, it was 17.24% in Sonali and 14.93% in broiler breeder chicken. Except broiler, the other three types of chickens reared for more than 60 weeks of age that increased the chances of harbor of IBV infection. Jackwood [23] and Seger et al.
