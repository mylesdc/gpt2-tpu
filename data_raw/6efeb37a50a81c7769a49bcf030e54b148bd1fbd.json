The approach involves generating yeast cell libraries displaying a pool of random peptides of controllable lengths on the cell surface, followed by one round of fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) against antisera from mouse, goat and human, respectively. The amino acid residue frequency appearing in the antigenic peptides at both the primary sequence and structural level was determined and used to identify ''hot spots'' or antigenically important regions. Unexpectedly, different antigenic structures were seen for different antisera. Moreover, five antigenic regions were identified, of which all but one are located in the conserved HA stem region that is responsible for membrane fusion. Our findings are corroborated by several recent studies on cross-neutralizing H1 subtype antibodies that recognize the HA stem region. The antigenic peptides identified may provide clues for creating peptide vaccines with better accessibility to memory B cells and better induction of cross-neutralizing antibodies than the whole HA protein. The scheme used in this study enables a direct mapping of the antigenic regions of viral proteins recognized by antisera, and may be useful for dissecting the antigenic structures of other viral proteins.",

These methods provide much more information on viral epitopes, although they are often laborious.

            "text": "Inspired by advances in cell surface display technology [22, 23] and peptide fragment library construction [24] , we devised a highthroughput scheme that utilizes yeast display and FACS that allows for direct screening of random viral peptide libraries against complex antisera instead of isolated antibodies (Zuo T, Shi XL, Xu WH, Lin Z, and Zhang LQ, unpublished results). The peptide library is generated by random digestion of the gene encoding the target viral protein, followed by a PCR-based reassembly step that results in fragments with controllable lengths (normally in the range of 100-500 bp) [24] . These peptides are then expressed on the yeast cell surface by fusion to the yeast adhesion receptor AGA 2 protein, which has previously been used to display defined short antigen fragments of various viral and non-viral proteins [19] [20] [21] . From the sequences of the antigenic peptides after screening, it is possible to determine the relative frequency of each amino acid residue involved in recognition by antisera, and how these residues are distributed in the three-dimensional structure of HA. Using this approach, we analyzed the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus HA protein using mouse, goat and human antisera. Unexpectedly, different antigenic profiles were seen for different antisera. Moreover, five antigenic regions were identified, four of which are located in the conserved HA stem region responsible for membrane fusion. ELISA binding assays and absorption experiments using peptides that encompass these regions have confirmed their antigenic activities.",

            "text": "The procedure for construction, expression and screening of random viral peptide libraries using yeast surface display is shown in Fig. S1 (see also Materials and Methods for details). In step 1, the full length HA gene of the pandemic 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus (including the core HA protein of 519 aa, the signal peptide of 16 aa, and the inter membrane domain of 36 aa) was digested and re-assembled by PCR to form a pool of fragments enriched in 100-500 bp [24] . In step 2, the fragment library was ligated into the yeast display vector pCTCON-T (derived from the yeast surface display vector pCTCON-2 [23] shown in Fig. 1 ), transformed into yeast EBY100 cells and induced for expression, generating a typical library of 1610 5 -10 6 clones to cover most of the possible fragments [25] . Because there are 3 stop codons on pCTCON-T downstream of the peptide inserts to terminate every ORF, the theoretical possibility for in-frame fusions is 1/3 for the N-terminal end of the peptide inserts. Thus, the theoretical yield for cells expressing in-frame peptides is 1/6 (the fragments can be inserted in forward and reverse directions). Subsequently in step 3, the cell library was incubated with antisera, labeled with secondary fluorescent antibody and subjected to FACS in step 4, after which the cells harboring antibody-binding peptides were distinguished from those with non-binding peptides. In step 5, we isolated plasmids directly from the pool of yeast cells containing positive peptide sequences, which were retransformed into E. coli for sequencing. This reduced laborious plasmid extraction from individual yeast clones. Plasmids containing in-frame sequences were transformed back into yeast for individual flow cytometry (FCM) verification. Retransformation and FCM were also performed for plasmids containing out of frame sequences (false positive). Antigenic peptide sequences were aligned with the HA sequence in step 6 (see also Figs. 2 and 3). In step 7, statistical analyses both on the sequence and structural levels were then performed to map out the antigenically important regions of the HA protein, by summarizing the frequency of each amino acid residue appearing in the antigenic peptides (see also Fig. 4) .",

The majority of the HA1 subunit forms the viral membrane-distal globular head responsible for receptor binding, whereas the HA2 subunit together with the N-and C-termini of HA1 forms the membrane-proximal stem region that plays a major role in membrane fusion. Thus two plasmids, pCTCON-HA1, pCTCON-HA2, respectively, were constructed to display the HA1 subunit of 328 aa (residues 17-344 of the HA protein) and the HA2 ecto-domain of 192 aa (residues 345-536 of the HA protein) as positive controls for FCM (Fig. 1) .

Freshly induced library cells were incubated with mixed sera from immunized mice and subsequently labeled with fluorescent secondary antibodies. To avoid potential bias introduced by growth advantage of the yeast cells, only one round of sorting was performed. Plasmids isolated from positive yeast cells were transformed into E. coli cells and plated. Single clones (100) were picked randomly and sequenced, of which 82 (82%) were shown to contain in-frame inserts. These results indicate that the sorting process is able to distinguish in-frame sequences from the random library that contained only 1/6 (16.7%) in-frame inserts efficiently. After verification of individual peptides by FCM detection, the ratio of recombinant antigen expressed on the yeast surface (RAYS) was determined by dividing the mean fluorescence intensity of peptide expressing yeast cells by the mean fluorescent intensity of the nonexpressing (pCTCON-2) yeast cells [26] . 56 positive clones with a RAYS ratio $2 were considered as antigenic and analyzed at both the sequence and structural level [26] . Alignment of positive peptides with the original HA sequence shows that 87% are in the HA2 region (95627 aa), with just 13% in the HA1 region (259626 aa) which cover nearly the entire HA1 protein (Fig. 2, panel A). The FCM histograms of several representative yeast clones are shown in Fig. 3 , panel A. Clones M-5 (corresponding to residues 55-313 of HA, or 70 aa shorter than HA1) and M-7 (residues 69-275, or 120 aa shorter than HA1) were strongly positive (RAYS ratio .5), and contained the entire receptor binding domain (RBD) and the vestigial esterase domain in the globular HA head. Clones M-33 (residues 387-489) and M-52 (residues 423-492) displayed much shorter peptides but also showed strong fluorescent FCM signals (Fig. 3 , panel A), albeit with relatively lower RAYS ratios of 3-4. Judged from the mean fluorescence intensities, the binding affinities of these displayed peptides were generally weaker than the whole HA1 (Fig. S2,  panel B) .",

Nevertheless, when we perform a statistical analysis by summarizing the normalized frequency of each amino acid residue in all positive antigenic peptides (defined as the residue frequency map), a major peak with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) from residues 387-480 is revealed (Fig. 4 , panel A). We also modify the residue frequency map by taking into account the respective RAYS ratios of positive peptides, which however results in an overall rather similar frequency map (Fig.  S3, panel B) . Furthermore, even if we combine all the in-frame sequences from sorted yeast cells, a similar map (Fig. S3 , panel C) is again obtained, implying that the noises from the in-frame but The residue frequency map is then overlaid onto the crystal model of the trimeric HA of the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus (PDB ID: 3LZG) [27] , and annotated by colors from red (high frequency) to blue (low frequency) (Fig. 4, panel B ). This structural frequency map reveals that the major peak (corresponding to residues 387-480 within the FWHM) on the residue frequency map can be divided into two dominant antigenic regions since they have independent structural features. One corresponds to the central coiled-coil helix CD in the HA2 subunit responsible for membrane insertion, designated as R1 (residues 424-480, indicated by red, see also Fig. 5 ), while the other contains helix A in the HA2 subunit that is important for conformational change upon low pH exposure, designated as R2 (residues 387-423, indicated by faint red and white, see also Fig. 5) [28] . R1 is present in a relatively recessed surface area while R2 is located near the exterior surface area of the stem region. For the HA1 subunit, no distinct antigenic region is identified, because of the limited number of peptides (7) with relatively longer lengths (all .200 aa), which are insufficient to form peak areas.",

Specifically, the peptide P1 (corresponding to the R1 region identified in all three screenings, Figs. 4 and 5 ) was reactive to all three antisera. The peptides P3, P4 and P5, corresponding to the R3-R5 regions identified only in the screening against the goat antisera (Fig. 4 , panels C, D, and Fig. 5) were only reactive to the goat antisera (Fig. 6, panel C) .

First, the antibody responses to the 2009 A(H1N1) viral protein HA appear to vary significantly depending on the species, with the goat response being strikingly different from those of mouse and human (Fig. 4) . These results imply possibly different immune responses among animal species, and in the case of human, the specific immunization background may also play a role [13] . Moreover, the antigenic peptides obtained from the screening against the mouse or human antisera are predominantly located in the HA2 region, whereas those from the screening against the goat antisera are predominantly in the HA1 region. Second, five antigenically important regions, R1 to R5 in the order from most membrane proximal to distal (Fig. 5) , are identified. Moreover, except for R5 which is located in the vestigial esterase domain of the HA globular head, all of the other regions are in the HA stem region. Among them, R1 and R2 come together to form a major peak with a FWHM range from residues 387 to 480 (Fig. 4, panels A and E) . Although the peptide P2 corresponding to the R2 region showed no measurable affinity to either mouse or human antisera (Fig. 6) , which suggests that this region might be more conformation-dependent than the rest four regions, it is PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org assigned as a separate region for the following reasons: (1) structurally it is distinguishable from the R1 region (Fig. 5) , and (2) several recent studies have reported the epitopes of monoclonal antibodies targeting H1 subtype HA proteins, which fall into the R2 region of this study [10, 31, 32] (see below).",

However, technically the monoclonal antibodies used in these previous studies were obtained from murine hybridoma cells by radioimmunoassay (RIA) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. The nature of these assays favored the isolation of antibodies that bound predominantly to the globular head of the virus and inhibited binding of the virus to the host cells. In this current study, however, complex antisera were used, which should contain antibodies recognizing other regions of the HA protein. On the other hand, only one antigenic region (R5) is identified in the globular head in this study, possibly because the epitopes in this head region are more conformation-dependent and may require longer peptides or even a complete domain of HA1 to be displayed for full antigenicity (at least for the mouse serum and human plasma samples). It is then noteworthy that the head region, especially the area around the receptor binding site, contains mostly beta structures, which more likely require stabilization by long-range interactions than the helical structures in other regions of HA (Fig. 5) . However, the peptide library constructed in this study was enriched at 100-500 bp (or less than 170 aa), which was likely insufficient to map the conformational epitopes. Nonetheless, the current screening method is a valuable complementation to the more classical approaches that are biased toward full HA1 or HA2 domain.",

            "text": "Several recent studies support our findings regarding antigenic regions R1-R4 in the stem region of HA. In efforts aimed at characterizing antibodies with cross-neutralizing activity for various influenza virus subtypes [10, 13, 31] , it was found that most of these antibodies bind to the HA stem region and interfere with conformational changes of the protein critical for membrane fusion. For example, in the case of antibody CR6261 (binding to HA of the SC1919 virus, H1 type), two antigenic regions on HA stem were revealed: helix A in the HA2 region, and the adjacent HA1 region [32] . The critical sites in helix A (corresponding to residues 390-391, 393-395, 398, 401-402, 405 in H1N1 HA) fall within the R2 region identified in this study, whereas the hydrophobic interaction sites in the adjacent HA1 region (corresponding to residues 38-42, 306-307 in H1N1 HA) fall into regions R3 and R4 of this study, respectively. More recently, it was reported that for a different cross-neutralizing antibody that targets a broad range of H3 subtype virus strains, 12D1, the dominant contacts on the antigen (corresponding to residues 425-455 in H1N1 HA) [37] correlate well with the R1 region found in this study. Furthermore, vaccination in mice using a HA2-based synthetic peptide mimicking the 12D1 epitope was shown to provide protection against influenza viruses of H3N2, H5N1, and H1N1 subtypes [38] . Taken together, our approach should be useful for dissecting antigenic regions on the HA stem, and providing clues for designing more potent peptide vaccines in inducing cross-neutralizing antibodies than the entire HA protein [32] .",

            "text": "Compared with other labor-intensive epitope identification methods that rely on identifying critical residues in escape mutants and crystal structures, the method used here gives a direct and panoramic mapping of the antigenic regions of viral proteins recognized by antisera in a facile and high-throughput way. Our approach likely contains an inherent bias for shorter peptides, but nonetheless complements the more classical approaches that favor longer antigenic peptides or full antigenic domains. The scanning of antigenic peptides based on phage, bacterial or yeast surface display methods has been increasingly used in recent years. Our approach presents two advantages. First, technically we adopt an easy-to-implement scheme for generating a controllable size of peptides and our screening typically involves only one round of FACS-based sorting, in contrast to multiple rounds of panning or sorting used in the literature [15, 16, 18] . Although the latter results in many repeat sequences, we argue that much information is lost in the enrichment process. Second and more importantly, since simple alignment of antigenic peptides with the corresponding viral protein yields only limited information [15, 17, 39] , we employ a novel statistical means of summarizing the frequency for each residue appearing in the antigenic peptides at both the primary sequence and structural level, which enables a direct mapping of the antigenic structure of a viral protein. Along this line, it is interesting to note that, using our statistical approach, we reevaluate the highly repeated antigenic peptides identified for the H5N1 HA protein in a recent report [15] . Several major peaks are clearly revealed (Fig. S7) , which should be useful for further characterization of the antigenic peptides for H5N1 HA. (H1N1) influenza vaccine, and a mixture of 9 samples with the highest activity among 110 samples as judged by ELISA.

All samples were de-identified prior to analysis, and the protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Shenzhen East Lake Hospital. All viral strains are closely related.",

This process was repeated four times, and then the supernatants were used for determining the neutralization titers, using a microneutralization assay with A/reassortants/NYMC X-179A/California/07/ 2009(H1N1) virus and MDCK cells according to standard procedures [41] . Briefly, triplicate serial dilutions (1:50 to 1:1600) of antiserum samples were incubated with 100 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) of virus for 2 h at 35uC prior to adding MDCK cells. Cells were incubated at 35uC for 72 h, and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was determined. All the neutralization assays were performed at the AIDS Research Center, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University following standard procedures. Figure S1 Schematic outline of the screening approach. In Step 1, the gene encoding the viral protein H1N1 HA was amplified, digested and re-assembled to generate the fragment library (the red and grey segments indicate the antigenic and nonantigenic peptides, respectively). In Step 2, the fragment library was ligated into the display vector pCTCON-T, transformed into yeast cells and induced for expression. In Step 3, the yeast cells expressing random peptides were incubated with antisera and fluorescence-labeled second antibodies and subjected to FACS in Step 4. Afterward in Step 5, the gene fragments were isolated from the sorted cells and sequenced. The in-frame sequences were retransformed into yeast cells and verified by FCM detection individually. In Step 6, an antigenic peptide profile was extracted for the sequences corresponding to the antigenic peptides, based on which the residue frequency and structural frequency maps were derived in Step 7. (TIF) [15] . The x-axis represents all H5N1 HA amino acid residues. The y-axis shows the normalized frequency of individual residue appearing in the 784 antigenic peptides (39 unique sequences) obtained from panning against H5N1 avian influenza convalescent sera. The six clusters (I-VI) defined by Khurana et al. are graphically represented below the x-axis. Several representative antigenic peptides are also shown as green arrows (numbered according to Khurana et al.) . Even though the antigenic peptides were enriched multiple times during the screening process and thus these peptides are less diverse and might be biased in sequences, several peaks are clearly identifiable, and predominantly in the HA2 region.

Vector pCTCON-T was derived from pCTCON-2 [23] by inserting an assistant sequence with two Xcm I sites at both ends between Nhe I and BamH I sites. Digestion of pCTCON-T yielded a T vector for TA ligation with random fragments of the H1N1 HA gene. 'Stop', 'Stop*' and 'Stop**' stand for three different stop codons for three possible ORFs, respectively. The random peptide library was expressed under the control of the galactose inducible GAL 1/10 promoter and displayed on the surface of the yeast cells by fusion to the yeast adhesion receptor AGA 2 protein. Vectors pCTCON-HA1 and pCTCON-HA2, created by inserting HA1 and HA2 genes between the Nhe I, BamH I sites of pCTCON-2, were used as positive controls in FCM detection. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0018016.g001",
