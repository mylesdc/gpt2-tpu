            "text": "Bats are found to be the natural reservoirs for many emerging viruses. In most cases, severe clinical signs caused by such virus infections are normally not seen in bats. This indicates differences in the virus-host interactions and underlines the necessity to develop natural host related models to study these phenomena. Due to the strict protection of European bat species, immortalized cell lines are the only alternative to investigate the innate anti-virus immune mechanisms. Here, we report about the establishment and functional characterization of Myotis myotis derived cell lines from different tissues: brain (MmBr), tonsil (MmTo), peritoneal cavity (MmPca), nasal epithelium (MmNep) and nervus olfactorius (MmNol) after immortalization by SV 40 large T antigen. The usefulness of these cell lines to study antiviral responses has been confirmed by analysis of their susceptibility to lyssavirus infection and the mRNA patterns of immune-relevant genes after poly I:C stimulation. Performed experiments indicated varying susceptibility to lyssavirus infection with MmBr being considerably less susceptible than the other cell lines. Further investigation demonstrated a strong activation of interferon mediated antiviral response in MmBr contributing to its resistance. The pattern recognition receptors: RIG-I and MDA5 were highly upregulated during rabies virus infection in MmBr, suggesting their involvement in promotion of antiviral responses. The presence of CD14 and CD68 in MmBr suggested MmBr cells are microglia-like cells which play a key role in host defense against infections in the central nervous system (CNS). Thus the expression pattern of MmBr combined with the observed limitation of lyssavirus replication underpin a protective mechanism of the CNS controlling the lyssavirus infection. Overall, the established cell lines are important tools to analyze antiviral innate immunity in M. myotis against neurotropic virus infections and present a valuable tool for a broad spectrum of future investigations in cellular biology of M. myotis.",

            "text": "Bats belong to one of the most abundant, diverse and widely distributed mammalian groups. In the order of Chiroptera which is divided into two suborders Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera, a total of 1,240 species have been yet described [1] . Bats evolved early and changed very little over the past 52 million years [2] . Their wide distribution and migratory behaviour favour bats as vectors for viruses and raise concerns over their role in zoonotic diseases [3] [4] [5] . Among the large number of viruses detected in bats, some like Hendra virus, Nipah virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), Ebola virus, West Nile virus were reported to be zoonotic [4, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Also 13 of the 15 lyssaviruses, except Mokola virus and Ikoma lyssavirus, were detected in bats. In North America bats host RABV, whereas in Europe European Bat lyssavirus type 1 and 2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2) are found in different bat species [12, 13] . Annually, there are approximately 55,000 human deaths caused by rabies, especially in the developing countries of Asia and Africa [14] . Despite most human rabies deaths are associated with dog rabies, some of them can be directly linked to the contact with bats, such as 8 out of 226 human rabies cases were of bat origin in the Americas in 1983 and a few human cases caused by EBLVs were reported in Europe to date [15] [16] [17] [18] . Although bat associated viruses can cause severe diseases in various mammals, they seem to be less pathogenic for bats [3, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . After experimental infection with Hendra or Nipah virus, bats showed no clinical disease, while guinea pigs succumbed to the same dose of virus [21, 22] . Similar situation was also observed in Hendra virus infection in horses and bats [24] . Lyssaviruses are the only viruses that were reported to cause clinical disease in bats [26] . However, only a small proportion of bats develop clinical symptoms after experimental infection [25, 27] . This indicates a critical difference in the development of viral disease between bats and other mammals and requires profound investigation of bat immunology and host-virus interactions.",

Thus, development of stable cell lines for in vitro studies derived from European bat species is desirable. So far, several bat cell lines were reported in previous studies, but most of them were established from non-European bats, like Tb1-Lu from Tadarida brasiliensis, Mvi/It from Myotis velifer incautus, and several primary immortalized cell lines from Pteropus alecto, Carollia perspicillata, Eidolon helvum and Rousettus aegyptiacus [28] [29] [30] [31] . Viral infection studies have been carried out in the fruit bat cell lines to investigate the susceptibility, infection kinetics of henipavirus as well as the host innate immunity [28, 32] . However, the susceptibility to lyssavirus has not yet been examined in these cell lines. Additionally, except for a brain cell line from Eptesicus serotinus employed to investigate the type I interferon (IFN) response after lyssavirus infection [33] , the use of a bat cell line as a tool for studies into lyssavirus infection in its natural reservoir host is rare. A broader variety of bat cell lines, particularly European bat cell lines from tissues of immune relevance, is therefore urgently in demand for lyssavirus-host studies.",

At an early stage of immortalization, cell lines displayed a significant susceptibility to RABV (MOI of 10 at 24 hpi) as demonstrated by the infection with GFP fused RABV. Notably, MmBr exhibited considerably lower viral load compared to the other cell lines (Fig. 4) . Later, all passaged immortalized cell lines showed susceptibility to EBLV-1, EBLV-2 and RABV in a different extent (Fig. 5A and B) . Generally, the MmBr cell line presented lower sensitivity to all three lyssaviruses (MOI of 0.1) than the other four cell lines measured by qRT-PCR at 24 hpi (Fig. 5A) , and monitored by immunofluorescence at 72 hpi (Fig. 5B) . Thus, the susceptibility could be ordered as MmNol and MmNep fully susceptible with a very high replication rate, MmPca and MmTo susceptible with a much less viral replication of EBLV-1 and 2, MmBr susceptible for EBLV-1 and RABV with a very low viral replication and just single infected cells after EBLV-2 infection (Fig. 5B) . The different susceptibility of the cell lines to lyssavirus infection was further confirmed by the growth kinetics of EBLV-1 in two representative models: MmBr, much less susceptible and MmNol, highly susceptible (Fig. 5C ).",

Viral pathogens like lyssaviruses developed evasive strategies to escape these host defenses by counteracting the IFN mediated immune responses [43] . Co-evolution of the lyssaviral evading and bat's protective mechanisms resulted in an optimal balance, which protect bats as the 'natural host' from severe clinical symptoms or death. Bats, which changed very little over past 52 million years, illustrate this phenomenon very well by the resistance to lethal diseases caused by viruses in other mammals [11, [21] [22] [23] [24] .To understand the specificity of hostpathogen interactions in 'natural host' like bats, studies in bats have to be performed. However, due to the strict protection of the endangered European bat species, in vitro models have to be used. In this study, we successfully established five M. myotis cell lines derived from neural and immune related tissues. To ensure the suitability of these cell lines to analyze virus-host cell interaction, the susceptibility to the infection as well as the presence of corresponding defensive pathways have to be confirmed.",

            "text": "First, the existence of the viral sensors TLR3, RIG-1 and MDA5 in these permanent cell lines suggests a capacity of these cell lines to sense a broad range of RNA viruses. The increased expression of dsRNA receptor TLR3 and IFN induced genes ISG56, ISG43, Mx1 and IFIT3 after stimulation with poly I:C mimicking a viral infection indicates that these cell lines can be used as effective in vitro models to study the bat's innate immune responses to virus infection [32, 44] . Furthermore, to serve as valuable models would be a varying susceptibility of such cell lines to infection by lyssaviruses. In the present study, different susceptibility observed in different M. myotis cell lines using EBLV-1, EBLV-2 and RABV might be related to the different capacity of the cell lines to produce antiviral mediators and control the infection. Moreover, the strong difference in the susceptibility to RABV infection between MmBr and other cell lines provides a unique opportunity for comparative investigations of cell autonomous and innate immune mechanisms in a reservoir host. In addition to the lyssaviruses, the other member from the Rhabdoviridae family, like vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can also be investigated by using these models in the future studies. Preliminary results indicate a correlation between the observed varying susceptibility and the ability to up-regulate the PRRs and the IFN induced genes. Emerging evidences have shown that PRRs play pivotal roles in antiviral immunity in the CNS [45] . In the brain derived cell line MmBr, the high up-regulations of RIG-1 and MDA5 revealed activation of RIG-I-like receptor pathway during RABV infection. As previously reported, RIG-1 is a major PRR to induce IFN in the RABV infected cells, and MDA5 may function to sustain the IFN induction [46] . The increased expressions of IFN induced genes: ISG56, ISG43, Mx1 and IFIT3 in MmBr indicate that the production of IFN was induced by activated RIG-1 and MDA5. In contrast, the low expression level of TLR3 implies a vague involvement of TLR3 in anti-RABV infection immunity or resistance. It was shown that TLR3 participated in and benefited the RABV pathogenesis in human neuron cells [47] . However, the roles of TLR3 during RABV infection in bats need further investigations. Importantly, the significant expression patterns of PRRs observed in presented cell line models provide an access to this issue in vitro. To reach a successful infection, the viruses must overcome the barriers of innate immune system. It was reported that IFN production and signaling pathways were antagonized in P. alecto cell lines under henipavirus infection [32] . Similarly, a recent study showed limited expressions of type I IFNs and IFN induced genes during lyssaviruses infection in an E. serotinus brain cell line [33] . A correlation between the low viral load and high expression levels of IFN induced genes in MmBr contrasts to the high viral load and a silent expression pattern of antiviral effectors in MmTo, providing an evidence of a countermeasure to IFN system by lyssavirus in the peripheral tissue versus a protective mechanism to infection in the brain tissue of bats. Microglial cells are one of the major cell populations in the brain tissue. Additionally, comparing to neurons, they can be infected by different RABV strains to a lesser extent [48, 49] . The presence of CD14 and CD68 as well as the anti-lyssavirus responses in MmBr support a microglia-like feature of MmBr in the CNS. It was reported that a mouse microglia cell line can activate strong innate immunity during RABV infection [50] . The robust immune responses of the microglia-like MmBr demonstrated a critical role of microglia in the anti-rabies defense in bat's CNS. In addition to the function of microglia, the clearance of infected viruses in the CNS requires systematical responses through the complex interactions of different brain resident cells. Herein, the establishment and identification of a microglia-like cell model is a first step towards understanding of the complex reactions of CNS in response to lyssavirus infection in the reservoir species. Overall, this preliminary study using established cell lines implies that immune mechanisms that control the virus replication are present in the CNS of bats. It seems that the ability to control the pathogenic RABV replication via IFN system in the CNS contributes to the asymptomatic outcome in bats.",

(C) To further confirm the susceptibility, MmBr and MmNol cell lines were infected with EBLV-1 at a MOI of 0.01, and viral replication levels were measured by qRT-PCR over 72 hpi (n = 2). -changed: viral supernatant was changed with fresh medium at 1 hpi. -Not changed: viral supernatant was not changed during the whole infection process. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0109795.g005",
