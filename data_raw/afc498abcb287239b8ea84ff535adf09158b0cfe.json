With sufficient sequencing depth, it is now possible to detect subtle variations between members of the same species, or between mixed species with shared biomarkers, such as the 16S rRNA gene. However, traditional sequencing analyses of samples from largely homogeneous populations are often still based on multiple sequence alignments (MSA), where each sequence is placed along a separate row and similarities between aligned bases can be followed down each column. While this visual format is intuitive for a small set of aligned sequences, the representation quickly becomes cumbersome as sequencing depths cover loci hundreds or thousands of reads deep.",

When the sequences of interest are largely similar and only a few salient differences exist within these populations, it is difficult to quantify or to identify the important trends with existing tools. The MSA is a useful visual aid when analyzing a small set of sequences within a sample, but to identify important trends within a large number of sequences, or among multiple sets of deeply sequenced samples, a more quantitative approach is necessary. Existing tools, such as BioPerl [3] , BioPython [4] , and SAMtools [5] , are useful for efficiently generating, manipulating and storing MSAs, but statistical metrics and visualizations for the comparison of the samples that the MSAs represent, do not exist.",

Three independent projects that have used ANDES will be described in the \"Results and Discussion\" section. The first project involved quantifying, on a whole genome level, the mutation rates and the locations of novel variations for a coronavirus that had been passaged 10 consecutive times in cell culture. The depth of sequencing was derived from a single Solexa run for each of 3 selected passages. This exemplifies how ANDES can be used to compare temporally separated samples, to analyze genome-wide mutation trends, and to identify specific variations for further analyses. In the second project, ANDES was used to differentiate between the strains of human influenza H1N1 sequences that were deposited into GenBank. Because the majority of human H1N1 sequences were generated from the circulating seasonal strain, there were little, or no, consistent annotations in the GenBank records to differentiate them from the collected sequences of the 2009 swine-origin influenza pandemic. In this case, the sequencing depth was accumulated across data that were deposited by a community of influenza researchers. The clustering and analyses of the dataset made it possible to design strainoptimized, degenerate PCR primers for the purpose of sequencing both seasonal and swine origin H1N1 genomes. The final project described is an application of the ANDES toolset to assess the sequencing accuracy and identify loci-specific sequencing errors for a 454 Titanium sequencing run performed on a subregion of the 16S rRNA gene (16S rDNA). The deep sequencing of clonal copies of a 16S sequence provided the data to empirically determine actual PCR and sequencing error rates. This has played a critical role in characterizing the nature of sequencing errors on downstream analyses.",

            "text": "The fundamental data structure of the ANDES suite of tools is the position profile. This data structure contains the number of nucleotides that support each position of the analyzed region of interest. ANDES currently supports the conversion from the output of clustalw [6] (i.e. .aln files), however the format of the position profile is relatively trivial; therefore the encoding of output from an alternative alignment application should be readily supported. Alignments generated with RazerS [7] , MUS-CLE [8] , and AMOScmp [9] tools have also been successfully converted into position profiles and analyzed. Figure 1 shows the input MSA that the resultant position profile in Figure 2 was created from. Each column in the position profile is calculated by summing the number of nucleotides or gap contributions at each position. Each line of the position profile is essentially a probability mass function (pmf), with support at {A, T, G, C, and -(gap)}, when the values are normalized and sum to 1. Gaps introduced at the beginning or end of the MSA are assumed to be caused by read termination, so these gaps are not considered to be nucleotide variations and are therefore ignored. Bases with IUPAC ambiguity codes [10] in the alignment are given equal weight for each nucleotide they represent. For example, the IUPAC code, M, represents A or C, so 0.5 will be contributed to both A and C position counts. The major allele is also stored in the profile for visual convenience. The number of lines in the position profile is the gapped length of the consensus sequence for the MSA.",

The SE plot is generated by plotting the alignment of a single sample along the x-axis versus the SE on the y-axis (for example, Figure 6 ). A summary SE value for a single sample can be computed by taking the arithmetic mean of the SE for every position along the length of the alignment, L. Since the SE can be calculated within a single sample, it is useful for quickly identifying regions or positions of variability without the necessity of choosing an ideal reference sequence.",

Most sequencing technologies either include a step to amplify the target DNA or require quantities of DNA which required the investigator to perform DNA amplification a priori. It has been estimated that PCR amplification will introduce an upper bound on sequence quality which is dependent on the fidelity of the polymerase.

Sequences were grouped into biweekly partitions when possible. If the collection day was not available, then the sequence was assigned to the partition with the same month with a null day.

A distance matrix was then generated by computing the summary RMSD value between every position profile, and R, the statistical software package, was used to produce a dendrogram with the hclust function ( Figure 9 ). As apparent from the dendrogram, the human H1N1 samples that were collected from March to June 2009 have much greater sequence similarity than those collected from June 2008 to January 2009. This may be attributed to the sudden focus of H1N1 sequencing performed on potential swine origin viral samples that were collected starting March 2009. Many other applications can be imagined for comparing position profiles across partitions, for example, investigating influenza diversity among different avian species or association of viral clades by geographic location.",

The underlying position profiles of these partitions can then be merged together to generate a new cumulative position profile from which a consensus sequence can be generated for downstream applications, such as degenerate primer design. For example, suppose it was determined that the mutation rate for a circulating virus caused a percentage of previously designed primers to fail at an unacceptable level for high throughput sequencing over a period of 4 months. By downloading sequences from GenBank and building partitions of new sequences on a weekly basis, an incrementally merged profile, consisting of an arbitrarily defined time period extending into the past, can be quickly generated. After the merged profile has been converted into a consensus sequence with an appropriate threshold set to achieve the desired sensitivity, the currently used primers can be Figure 9 Example dendrogram clustering using an RMSD-based distance matrix. Each leaf in the dendrogram represents a biweekly partition of collection dates. The cluster of leaves on the left-hand side are likely attributed to the swine origin H1N1 virus outbreak, whereas those sequences collected on the right-hand side were based on the circulating seasonal H1N1 virus.",

These actual quality values were compared against those assigned by the 454 base caller, or associated with sequence features, such as homopolymer runs. Briefly, a mock community consisting of 22 known microbial organisms from the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria was established. PCR amplification targeted 3 variable regions of the ribosomal 16S gene, each approximately 500 bp in length. PCR products were then sequenced using 454 Titanium. The resultant sequences were then analyzed using the BLAST algorithm [15] against the 16S reference database consisting only of the mock community, in order to associate each sequence with an organism and 16S copy with the highest similarity. For each (organism, 16S copy, variable region) combination, a partition of sequences was created and AMOScmp was used to align the partitioned sequences against the specific (organism, 16S copy, variable region) reference sequence. A position profile was then generated based on the AMOScmp results. Figure 10 is an example of the estimated quality values along one of the (organism, 16S copy, variable region) combination partitions. The average coverage depth was 10,514. The majority of positions had error rates of less than 1 in 100 (QV > 20). These average QVs were then compared against the average of QVs for each position assigned by the 454 base caller in order to determine how well 454 assigned quality values correlated to actual error rates. Further correlation analyses were also performed after aggregating by nucleotide type and length of homopolymer runs (not shown).",

            "text": "The results from the studies indicate that there was little correlation between empirically determined quality values and the 454 assigned quality values. This suggests that many of the sequencing errors are unpredictable with current error models. The consensus sequences from 454 assemblies are generally of high quality because the availability of coverage depth ameliorates the impact of random errors. Systematic errors, such as those caused by homopolymer runs, which cannot be addressed with additional sequencing depth, are known and accepted to be a source of error that needs be addressed in downstream processing. However, the level of individual error rates cannot be dismissed if they are intended for downstream cluster analyses, an important step prior to establishing operational taxonomic units (OTUs). An example of the frequency of errors along Figure 10 Example plot of empirically determined quality values (QV). A subregion of the 16S gene was deeply sequenced with 454 Titanium and then transformed into a position profile. The average empirically determined QV was plotted on the y-axis, along the length of the genome on the x-axis. the length of an (organism, 16S copy, variable region) combination is shown in Figure 10 . This pattern of random error along the entire length of the alignment is consistent with the difficulties that have been observed when using individual 454 sequences to establish OTUs in order to estimate population diversity [16] . Contrary to initial supposition, addressing errors from homopolymer runs alone is not sufficient to solving the problem of accurately establishing OTUs. Tools such as ANDES, which allow an investigator to produce an accurate local and global view of deep sequencing results, serves to make the identification of these trends more visible, so they may eventually be addressed correctly.",
