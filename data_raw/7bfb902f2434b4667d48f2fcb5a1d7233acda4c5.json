During chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection however, excessive production of MCP-1 has been linked to disease pathogenesis. High MCP-1 serum levels are detected during the viremic phase of CHIKV infection and correlate with the virus titre. In vitro CHIKV infection was also shown to stimulate MCP-1 production in whole blood; yet the role and the mechanism of MCP-1 production upon infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells remain unknown. Here we found that active CHIKV infection stimulated production of MCP-1 in monocytes. Importantly however, we found that communication with other leukocytes is crucial to yield MCP-1 by monocytes upon CHIKV infection. Indeed, blocking interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor or the JAK1/JAK2 signalling downstream of the receptor abolished CHIKV-mediated MCP-1 production. Additionally, we show that despite the apparent correlation between IFN type I, CHIKV replication and MCP-1, modulating the levels of the chemokine did not influence CHIKV infection. In summary, our data disclose the complexity of MCP-1 regulation upon CHIKV infection and point to a crucial role of IFN\u03b2 in the chemokine secretion. We propose that balance between these soluble factors is imperative for an appropriate host response to CHIKV infection.",

MCP-1 acts as a chemo-attractant for monocytes as well as some other immune cells such as memory T lymphocytes and natural killer cells 20 . MCP-1-mediated migration of monocytes from the blood stream across the vascular endothelium is essential for routine immunological surveillance of tissues, as well as in response to inflammation 26 . Indeed, MCP-1 knockout mice have impaired monocyte recruitment following intraperitoneal thioglycolate administration, as well as in response to viral infection including influenza A virus, coronavirus and West Nile virus (WNV) [27] [28] [29] [30] . Similarly, MCP-1 receptor knockout mice show increased cellular infiltration and develop more severe disease than wild type mice following infection with influenza virus, WNV and CHIKV [31] [32] [33] . On the other hand, inhibition of MCP-1 synthesis with use of bindarit protects against CHIKV-induced bone loss, arthritis and myositis in a mouse model of acute CHIKV disease 34, 35 .",

To this end, cells were infected with CHIKV-LR Opy-1 strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, 5 or 10. MCP-1 levels were measured over time in the cell supernatants (SN) while the cells were harvested for intracellular MCP-expression analysis at 24 hpi. Figure 1A shows a representative time course of MCP-1 levels following CHIKV infection (left panel) and an average of the maximum increase of MCP-1 scored for all donors at different time points (right panel) in the cell supernatant. CHIKV stimulated a rapid increase in MCP-production, with initial chemokine detectable levels at 6hpi. Despite some variability among donors in the MCP-1 basal expression, CHIKV infection increased the levels of MCP-1 on average 2-to 3-fold between 24-48 hpi. Intracellular staining of MCP-1 confirmed the increase in expression of MCP-1 following CHIKV infection (Fig. 1b) . Also, and in line with previous studies 37 , non-replicative, UV-inactivated CHIKV (UV-CHIKV) did not trigger an increase in MCP-1 expression inferring that CHIKV replication is required for MCP-1 induction in PBMCs. Error bars show s.e.m. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test was used for statistical analysis.

Accordingly, we performed flow cytometric analysis to search for CHIKV E2 and MCP-1-positive PBMCs. Disappointingly; the frequencies of CHIKV + monocytes were negligibly low at conditions with high MCP-1 expression.

Counterintuitively however, no MCP-1 stimulation was observed upon infection of monocytes (Fig. 2b ) at any MOI tested ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Nonetheless, depletion of monocytes (on average 96% CD14 + cells was depleted) abrogated CHIKV-mediated secretion of the chemokine (Fig. 2b) . Incubation of non-infected monocytes with the SN of infected Mo\u0394 PBMCs also did not stimulate MCP-1 production (not depicted), confirming that infection of monocytes was imperative to lead to the production of this chemokine. Addition of IL-6, used as a positive control, stimulated MCP-1 production in all cell preparations (Fig. 2c) , indicating that positive selection did not affect the capacity of the cells to produce MCP-1 and was not the reason for the lack of MCP-1 secretion by infected monocytes. Thus far, these results implied that presence of other leukocytes was crucial for the chemokine production in the context of CHIKV infection. To test this, infected monocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of non-infected or infected Mo\u0394 PBMCs in a transwell co-culture system. In agreement with the data presented in Fig. 2b , neither monocytes nor Mo\u0394 PBMCs secreted MCP-1 upon CHIKV infection ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). In contrast, when infected monocytes could exchange soluble factors with other leukocytes, a significant increase (p < 0.5) in MCP-1production was observed ( Fig. 2d left panel). In effect, the increase in the chemokine levels was comparable to that found in the infected PBMCs of the corresponding donors ( Fig. 2d right panel) , although the additive role of the cell-to cell contact cannot be excluded. Notably, the increase of MCP-1 was observed regardless of whether Mo\u0394 PBMCs were exposed to the virus or not. Altogether, these data suggest that CHIKV infection of monocytes triggers a communication loop with other leukocytes that ultimately leads to MCP-1 upregulation and production in monocytes.",

Next, we sought to disclose the soluble factor involved in MCP-1 upregulation. It has been proposed that IFN type I can modulate MCP-1 secretion in a concentration-dependent manner 23, 40 . Type I IFNs are also readily produced in course of CHIKV infection 37 . Analysis of SN of PBMCs and monocytes revealed that CHIKV infection triggers MOI-dependent production of IFN\u03b2 but not that of IFN\u03b1 ( Supplementary Figs S4 and S5 ). Therefore, we hypothesized that IFN\u03b2 stimulation via IFN\u03b1 \u03b2 receptor (IFNAR) played a role in CHIKV infection mediated MCP-1 production in PBMCs. Indeed, pre-incubation of these cells with \u03b1 IFNAR1/2 antibody abolished CHIKV-mediated MCP-1 production (Fig. 3a) . A similar effect was achieved when JAK1/2-STAT signalling downstream of IFNAR was inhibited by Ruxolitinib (Rux) during CHIKV infection and/or IFN\u03b2 stimulation (Fig. 3b) . Together, these results strongly suggest that IFN\u03b2 -mediated signalling is responsible for the MCP-1 production in course of the infection. To substantiate the role of IFN\u03b2 in the communication between monocytes and other leukocytes, we next tested whether stimulation of Mo\u0394 PBMCs with IFN\u03b2 alone for 4 hours prior to their co-culture with monocytes could induce MCP-1 secretion in monocytes. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3c , addition of IFN\u03b2 -pre-treated Mo\u0394 PBMCs (washed cells) to monocyte monoculture increased levels of the chemokine after 24 hours of co-culture. As expected, stimulation of Mo\u0394 PBMCs with IFN\u03b2 did not result in MCP-1 production in the absence of monocytes. In summary, we propose a model of IFN\u03b2 -driven communication of infected monocytes with other leukocytes that is essential for MCP-1 secretion upon CHIKV infection in PBMCs (Fig. 4) .",

Therefore, we investigated whether modulation of this chemokine influences CHIKV replication in PBMCs. Accordingly, we either neutralized endogenous MCP-1 levels by means of an anti-MCP-1 antibody (Supplementary Fig. S6 ) or performed infection in the presence of increasing concentrations of human recombinant MCP-1 (hrMCP-1) as described in Methods section.

Our data demonstrates that monocytes are the primary source of MCP-1 during CHIKV infection. Monocytes require IFN\u03b2 -mediated communication with other leukocytes for MCP-1 production (Fig. 4) . In addition, we show that MCP-1 had no direct effect on the levels of virus progeny. MCP-1 secretion following active CHIKV infection in PBMCs was dependent on IFN\u03b2 . This is in line with the study by Pattison and colleagues, which showed IFN\u03b2 is required to sustain MCP-1 production in response to TLR3 activation in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) 24 . Also, in monocytes IFN\u03b2 can stimulate MCP-1 production 23 . Yet, despite the detectable levels of IFN\u03b2 following CHIKV infection of monocytes at high MOI ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ), we found no MCP-1 production in these cells, which might indicate that the autocrine effect of IFN\u03b2 was blocked during CHIKV infection. This phenomenon could, at least in part, be explained by the fact that CHIKV impedes the ability of infected cells to respond to type I interferon by preventing IFN-induced gene expression 44 . It remains to be seen why non-infected, bystander monocytes did not secrete MCP-1.",

In fact, IFN\u03b2 -stimulated Mo\u0394 PBMCs were able to trigger MCP-1 production in monocytes. Hence, MCP-1 secretion was regulated by yet an unknown soluble factor or factors triggered downstream of IFNAR signalling. MCP-1 levels are known to be controlled by several cytokines including, TNF-\u03b1 , IL-10, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 21, 23, 25, 45 . Indeed, in our experiments, addition of IL-6 but not CHIKV infection stimulated MCP-1 production in monocytes. This suggests that IL-6 was either not produced by monocytes upon infection, or it was present in amounts insufficient to trigger MCP-1 amplification loop 46 . In fact, lack of IL-6 (and MCP-1) production in CHIKV-infected monocytes, despite its presence in in vitro infected whole blood samples, was also reported by Her and colleagues 37 . We therefore deduced that IL-6 is one of the IFN\u03b2 -stimulated cytokines responsible for MCP-1 production, and that it is produced by cells other than monocytes. Counterintuitively however, treatment of PBMCs with Ruxolitinib prior to addition of IFN\u03b2 , increased the levels of IL-6 (Ruiz Silva, unpublished) while abolishing MCP-1 production completely. Our ongoing studies focus at the disclosure of the identity and the source of IFN\u03b2 -stimulated soluble mediator(s) that govern the MCP-1 upregulation in monocytes upon CHIKV infection in PBMCs.",

Yet, it is important to note that in our experimental set up no influx of new target cells was possible. Thus, we cannot rule out a scenario, in which increased levels of MCP-1 in the circulatory system result in an augmented recruitment of monocytes from bone marrow and thereby in an increased pool of cells susceptible to infection 29, 48, 49 . Indeed, in mice, inhibition of MCP-1 with bindarit led to significantly reduced titre of CHIKV at the site of infection 34 .
