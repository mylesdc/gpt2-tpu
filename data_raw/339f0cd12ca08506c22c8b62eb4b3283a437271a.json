            "text": "Although heterotypic secondary infection with dengue virus (DENV) is associated with severe disease, the majority of secondary infections are mild or asymptomatic. The mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection are poorly understood. In 2010, 108 DENV3-positive cases were enrolled in a pediatric hospital-based study in Managua, Nicaragua, with 61 primary and 47 secondary infections. We analyzed DENV-specific neutralization titers (NT 50 ), IgM and IgG avidity, and antibody titer in serum samples collected during acute and convalescent phases and 3, 6, and 18 months post-infection. NT 50 titers peaked at convalescence and decreased thereafter. IgG avidity to DENV3 significantly increased between convalescent and 3-month time-points in primary DENV infections and between the acute and convalescent phase in secondary DENV infections. While avidity to DENV2, a likely previous infecting serotype, was initially higher than avidity to DENV3 in secondary DENV infections, the opposite relation was observed 3-18 months post-infection. We found significant correlations between IgM avidity and NT 50 in acute primary cases and between IgG avidity and NT 50 in secondary DENV infections. In summary, our findings indicate that IgM antibodies likely play a role in early control of DENV infections. IgG serum avidity to DENV, analyzed for the first time in longitudinal samples, switches from targeting mainly cross-reactive serotype(s) to the current infecting serotype over time. Finally, serum avidity correlates with neutralization capacity.",

            "text": "The immune response to primary (1u) DENV infection is characterized by an early IgM response followed by an IgG response with predominantly IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses [5] . Na\u00efve B cells are stimulated and develop into DENV-specific B cells, which either differentiate into memory B cells (MBCs) residing in the secondary lymphoid organs or into plasma cells (PCs) secreting antigen-specific antibodies (Abs). Short-lived PCs are active during acute infection, while long-lived PCs (LLPCs) migrate to the bone marrow and are responsible for long-term humoral immunity [6, 7] . MBCs, which retain antigen-specific Abs at their surface, and LLPCs, which secrete antigen-specific Abs, undergo affinity maturation, and only clones bearing Abs with the highest affinity survive long-term [8] . This process takes several weeks after acute infection and continues despite the absence of circulating antigen. During a secondary (2u) DENV infection, MBCs are rapidly activated [9, 10] . Prior DENV infection provides robust immunity against the homotypic DENV serotype [11, 12] . In contrast, 2u heterotypic infections are associated with a higher incidence of DHF/DSS, possibly attributable in part to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), where pre-formed Abs to the 1u infecting serotype bind but do not neutralize the 2u infecting serotype, instead facilitating an increase in viral uptake by Fcc-receptor bearing cells [13] . In addition to ADE, cross-reactive T cells formed during the 1u DENV infection can be over-activated, potentially contributing to dengue pathogenesis [14, 15] . However, the vast majority of 2u DENV infections are asymptomatic or only result in mild disease [16] , suggesting a protective immune response [17] .",

Briefly, study enrollment occurred in the Nicaraguan National Pediatric Reference Hospital, Hospital Infantil Manuel de Jes\u00fas Rivera (HIMJR), in Managua from August 1, 2010, to January 31, 2011, during the peak dengue season. Inclusion criteria included age between 6 m and 15 years of age. Samples were collected for 3 consecutive days after enrollment (acute), 14-28 days after onset of symptoms (convalescent), and at 3 m, 6 m and 18 m post-illness. DENV infection was confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of viral RNA [34] ; isolation of DENV in C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells [27] ; seroconversion of DENV-specific IgM Abs as measured by IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) between acutephase and convalescent-phase serum samples [35] ; and/or a $4fold increase in total Ab titer, as measured by Inhibition ELISA [30, 36] , between paired acute-and convalescent-phase serum samples as previously described [26] . 1u and 2u DENV infections were defined by an Ab titer by Inhibition ELISA of ,10 or $10 in acute-phase samples, respectively, and/or ,2,560 or $2,560 in convalescent phase samples, respectively [31, 37] . The total Ab titer was measured only during the acute and convalescent phases of the infection, as it decreases substantially thereafter.",

Four different dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) cause the disease, which can be either inapparent or present with flu-like symptoms (Dengue Fever, aka ''breakbone fever''). The disease can be more severe and sometimes fatal, with signs of bleeding and vascular leakage leading to shock (Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever/Dengue Shock Syndrome). No specific treatment or vaccine is available. Understanding how the human immune response develops during a natural infection can be beneficial for future vaccine studies and trials. DENV-specific serum neutralizing capacity may play a role in protection. The neutralization capacity of the serum may depend on the serum avidity against DENV, the amount (or titer) of the anti-DENV antibodies, and the accessibility of the epitopes targeted by these antibodies. Here we show that DENV-specific IgM antibodies likely play a role in neutralization during primary DENV infections and show a correlation between serum avidity and neutralization capacity in secondary DENV infections, with greater avidity to a previously infecting DENV serotype as compared to the current infecting DENV serotype in the early phases of infection, switching over time to the opposite situation.",

Using samples from the same study population, we previously optimized the amount of urea to be used, and 6M urea for 1u DENV infections and 9M urea for 2u DENV infections yielded the best results for analyzing serum avidity to DENV over time [9] . To measure serum IgM avidity, a donkey anti-human IgM, F c -fragment-specific MAb (1:1,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used as secondary Ab. For acute-phase samples, days 4-6 post-onset of symptoms were chosen. Background levels were measured with dengue-negative human sera.

For 2u infections, we noted a similar pattern (p,0.0001 for each pair of adjacent time-points) ( Figure 1B ). In addition, for 2u infections, we measured the DENV2-specific neutralization capacity of the serum, which showed a similar trend ( Figure 1C ).",

Protection from DENV infection and/or disease may depend on DENV-specific serum neutralization and thus may be associated with DENV-specific Ab titer and DENV-specific serum avidity. However, several questions remained unanswered, such as the role of IgM Abs and whether serum avidity correlates with serum neutralization. Using our longitudinal sample series from our hospital-based study, we show for the first time that DENV-specific neutralization titers peak in the convalescent phase and then decrease over time in both 1u and 2u DENV3 infections. We also observed increasing DENV3-specific avidity between the convalescent phase and 3 m post-infection in 1u DENV3 cases and between acute and convalescent phases in 2u DENV3 infections. In addition, we detected higher avidity against a heterologous, potentially previously infecting serotype (DENV2) in the acute phase of 2u DENV3 infections, while avidity was higher against the current infecting serotype at later time-points (3-18 m). Finally, we show for the first time a correlation between serum avidity and serum neutralization titers in the context of DENV infection, and specifically demonstrate that serotype-specific neutralizing titers correlate with serum IgM avidity in 1u acute DENV infections and with serum IgG avidity in 2u DENV infections.",

MBCs and LLPCs develop from na\u00efve B cells and undergo affinity maturation and selection during the first 3 m after infection. As only clones with the highest avidity survive long-term, this leads to a higher mean IgG avidity over time [7, 8] . In contrast, in 2u DENV infections, we observed an increase in serum IgG avidity to DENV3 earlier, between the acute and convalescent phase, which cannot be explained by affinity maturation of newly activated DENV3-specific B cells. Rather, this suggests that cross-reactive Abs secreted by preexisting MBCs contribute to the early increase in avidity during 2u heterotypic DENV infections.

Here, we confirm these findings and show that subsequently, serum IgG avidity against the current infecting serotype increases over time such that avidity to the current infecting serotype is greater than that to the previous infecting serotype 3-18 m post-infection. Serum IgG avidity to DENV2 decreases at 18 m time-point, possibly as DENV2-specific LLPCs are displaced from the bone marrow and replaced by newly generated DENV3-specific LLPCs. LLPC niches are limited in the bone marrow, and newly formed LLPCs can replace LLPCs formed during earlier infections [44, 45] . The decrease in serum IgG avidity to DENV3 at the 18 m time-point could be explained by a strong extra-follicular response induced by the presence of pre-existing anti-DENV Abs in 2u infections, inhibiting the germinal center response and thus inhibiting a strong long-term immunity to the current infecting serotype, DENV3 [46] .",

We analyzed here whether DENV-specific serum avidity and total Ab titer correlate with DENV-specific neutralization. During 1u DENV infections, neither IgG serum avidity to DENV3 nor DENV-specific total Ab titer correlated with DENV3-specific NT 50 . Rather, the NT 50 correlated with IgM serum avidity to DENV3 in the acute phase of 1u DENV3 infections, showing that highly avid IgM Abs are also highly neutralizing and suggesting that IgM Abs play an important role in DENV-specific serum neutralization. In contrast, in the acute phase of 2u DENV infections, DENV3-specific NT 50 correlated with IgG serum avidity to DENV3. Because of the rapid kinetics of appearance of IgG Abs in a 2u DENV infection and the slow affinity maturation process, these highly avid IgG Abs are most likely secreted by MBCs formed during the previous infection rather than by newly-activated na\u00efve B cells. This suggests that cross-reactive Abs contribute to neutralization of acute 2u DENV infections. This is consistent with the isolation of strongly neutralizing cross-reactive MAbs from 2u DENV infections (S. Smith, J. Crowe, R. de Alwis, A. de Silva & E. Harris, unpublished data). IgG serum avidity to DENV2 and DENV2-specific NT 50 correlated at all time-points, suggesting that affinity maturation after the 1u infection contributes to strengthening the neutralizing activity of serum Abs. We also observed a correlation between IgG serum avidity to DENV3 and DENV2-specific NT 50 , further supporting the relation between cross-reactive Abs and neutralization. Furthermore, a positive correlation between DENVspecific total Ab titer and DENV3-specific NT 50 in acute 2u .

However, this could be due to the relatively low disease severity in the 2010-2011 epidemic in Nicaragua and thus the small sample size of DHF/DSS. Finally, pre-infection samples are not available through this hospital-based study; thus, we chose one likely previous infecting serotype (DENV2) to analyze in this group of patients.

            "text": "Overall, this study showed that IgM and cross-reactive IgG contribute to neutralization during acute DENV infections. To further support these results, we are conducting additional analyses of the DENV-specific serum neutralization capacity, including: 1) the use of b-mercaptoethanol to chemically deplete IgM Abs and 2) the use of DENV virions to deplete heterologous serotype crossreactive Abs. While cross-reactive serum avidity dominates the acute 2u DENV response, avidity to the current infecting serotype becomes dominant over time. Significant correlations were observed between neutralizing Ab titers and serum avidity to both the current and a heterotypic serotype. Future studies will address the relation of avidity and NT 50 to infection outcome (symptomatic vs. inapparent) and to disease severity. The unexpected results from the first proof-of-concept dengue live attenuated vaccine efficacy trial (Phase 2b) that were recently published [52] highlight the critical need to better understand the immune response to natural DENV infections and vaccine candidates and to identify robust correlates of protection. We believe that measurement of DENV-specific serum avidity should be integrated into evaluation of future vaccine trials and applied more broadly to the study of the immune response to DENV after natural infections.
