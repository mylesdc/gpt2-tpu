            "text": "Background: With the increase in prevalence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of acquiring and subsequently transmitting this lethal virus. In view of this, HCWs were evaluated for their knowledge of and attitude towards MERS in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross sectional study was performed in two hospitals of Qassim region in Saudi Arabia. A total of 280 healthcare workers were selected to participate in this study. Knowledge and attitude were assessed by using self-administered and pretested questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were carried out to express participants' demographic information, mean knowledge score and mean attitude score of HCWs. Inferential statistics (Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis tests, p < 0.05) were used to examine differences between study variables. Chi squares tests were used to assess the association between study variables and attitude questions. Spearman's rho correlation was used to identify the association between the knowledge, attitude scores. Result: Participants demonstrated good knowledge and positive attitude towards MERS. The mean scores of knowledge and attitude were 9.45 \u00b1 1.69 (based on 13 knowledge questions) and 1.82 \u00b1 0.72 (based on 7 attitude questions). The correlation between knowledge and attitude was significant (correlation coefficient: 0.12; P <0.001). HCWs were less educated about the management (42.4%), source (66%) and consequences of MERS (67.3%), while a majority of them were well aware of the hallmark symptoms (96%), precautionary measures (96%) and hygiene issues (94%). Although the majority of respondents showed positive attitude towards the use of protective measures (1.52 \u00b1 0.84), their attitude was negative towards their active participation in infection control program (2.03 \u00b1 0.97). Gender and experience were significantly associated with knowledge and attitude (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The findings of this study showed that healthcare workers in Qassim region of Saudi Arabia have good knowledge and positive attitude towards MERS. Yet there are areas where low knowledge and negative attitude of HCWs was observed. However, studies are required to assess the knowledge and attitude of HCWs at national level so that effective interventions could be designed as surveillance and infection control measures are critical to global public health.",

            "text": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome -Corona virus (MERS-CoV), a novel virus belonging to genus Beta coronavirus was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 [1] . Currently this virus has penetrated into countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula [2] . However, since the last update (27 March, 2014) , 290 cases have been reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). It has also been reported that 20.4% of MERS victims were healthcare workers (HCWs) [3] . Initially, the eastern region of KSA was affected by MERS, however reports have revealed that the virus has penetrated throughout the country including the region of Qassim [4] . Qassim is well-known to hold world largest camel market in the world. This region is also described as having plentiful water, lots of fruit trees, palm trees and greenery. The reproduction of bats is generally very high because of such environment and it may infect camels with MERS-CoV [5] . This pose a great threat to public health as people from all over Saudi Arabia and the neighbouring countries visit this market and this could escalates the transmission of infection nationwide. The large number of reported cases from KSA also reflects the transmission of this infection in healthcare settings [6] . Another study conducted earlier in 2013 reported the transmission of the virus through a hospital cluster, suggesting the mode of spread through contact and in the form of droplets [7] . Fever with chills/rigors, cough, shortness of breath, myalgia and gastrointestinal problems (diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain) are the common symptoms reported by researchers. Abnormal findings of chest radiograph are very common in MERS patients, while laboratory reports have shown thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and increase concentration of lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase. The mortality rate was found to be approximately 60% [4] . It has been reported that infection control measures can keep the virus at bay. However if the required actions are not taken promptly, it may cause significant disease burden on society and results in number of needless human deaths [6] . The occurrence of asymptomatic and subclinical MERS-CoV in community or in healthcare settings could be a huge threat to public health. In view of this, HCWs are at great risk of acquiring this infection or become a source of transmission to patients and their colleagues. The presence of this fatal virus among HCWs brings into light the urgent need of developing a thorough awareness program by initiating infection control measures to cut down the rate of this rapid prevailing disease.",

Firstly, the study instrument was sent to researchers and professionals from pharmacy and medical background to give their expert opinion with respect to its simplicity, relativity and importance. Secondly, a pilot study was conducted by the selecting a small sample of health care professionals (n = 12) who gave their opinions on making the questionnaire simpler and shorter. Participants from all healthcare professions were selected for the pilot study. Amendments from the participants were considered and integrated into the questionnaire, while ensuring its consistency with the published literature [10] [11] [12] [13] . After a thorough discussion, questionnaire was finalized by the authors and subsequently distributed to the participants for their response. Reliability coefficient was calculated by using SPSS v.20 and the value of Cronbach's alpha was found to be 0.74. The data of the pilot study was not used for the final analysis.",

This difference could be possibly explained by the fact that the referenced study was conducted in 2004, since then a lot of advancement has been made as now healthcare workers are more reliant on internet technologies to gain knowledge on emerging disease like MERS [15] . Speculation could also be made that most of the educational materials on MERS are posted online by ministry of health which may have urged the HCWs to use internet technology to gain access to those documents [3] . However, caution must be taken when using internet to gain healthcare knowledge because of the information overload. It is difficult to determine authenticity of the source and one can easily me misguided. Therefore, emphasis should be made on the development of evaluation skill among healthcare professionals for the extraction of knowledge from internet. The ministry of health website should also be kept updated regularly and healthcare professionals must be encouraged to visit official website to seek knowledge on health related issues. Additionally, under-utilized sources like seminars and availability of research articles could also be employed in a campaign to educate HCWs regarding MERS.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the most number of correct responses were gathered from the question about the symptoms of MERS followed by the question on the maintenance of hand hygiene in the prevention of disease transmission. These findings may be due to emphasis by the health authorities on such issues in their awareness program. These results are in line with the findings of other studies which showed the positive response of HCWs towards hand hygiene when dealing with SARS-CoV [16, 17] . These results were very encouraging as it is known that the lack of hygiene maintenance could lead to increase morbidity and mortality of deadliest virus like MERS [14] . However, with regards to knowledge of symptoms, the result of current research is not in accordance with a study conducted in US to determine HCWs knowledge of SARS in which a poor knowledge was exhibited by respondents when asked about symptoms of SARS [18] . The discrepancy in these results could be explained by a fact that educational campaigns by relevant authorities in Saudi Arabia have focussed more on sign and symptoms of MERS which may have enhanced their knowledge in this area of MERS [19] . Another speculation is that the outbreak of MERS in Saudi Arabia is very recent and there are more talks about it among the healthcare workers and in the community. Since, the focus is more towards symptoms and prevention; this may have increased their knowledge about the disease in these areas. Conversely, the healthcare workers were least knowledgeable regarding the management of MERS as 57.6% of workers replied wrongly when asked whether antibiotics are first choice drugs. This outcome is somewhat similar to another study in which 40% of respondents gave incorrect answer when asked about the management issue [20] . This again highlights the possibility that respondents were not thoroughly briefed about the management issues by the relevant authorities during their educational campaign and it was observed that majority of the correct answerers were given by experienced respondents. This argument is also supported by another false answer from almost 30% of the workers about the availability of vaccine. This question was again correctly answered by experienced workers in comparison to less experienced ones.",

The most positive attitude of healthcare workers was regarding the use of protective equipment when dealing with MERS patient (1.52 \u00b1 0.84). This finding is in line with another study which showed positive response from the healthcare workers that goggles and gloves should be worn when dealing with healthcare associated infections [23] . It was also observed that age was significantly associated with this question as the aged people (\u226540 years) more positively respond to this question as compared to younger ones (<40 years). On the contrary, the only negative attitude was observed when respondents adversely replied to the question of whether their active participation in infection control program can reduce the prevalence of MERS. Profession, gender and experience were found to be significantly associated with this question. Physicians, male and more experienced workers (\u22657years) showed relatively more positive attitude in reply to this question. This result is not in accordance with another study in which the highest attitude of healthcare workers was noted towards active participation in hospital control program [24] . The effect of gender and attitude could be well explained by the traditional norms and customs in Saudi Arabia. Males have more interaction and socialization than females. Their inclination towards meeting other healthcare professionals and specialists is more as compared to their female counterpart. This could influence their attitude towards their involvement in infection control measures to reduce the prevalence of MERS. Similarly, physicians were more positive in attitude as compared to healthcare professionals because of their in depth clinical training on infection control and greater opportunities of professional development as compared to other team members. The results are in agreement with other studies which have reported positive attitude of physicians among all healthcare workers [25, 26] . There is a need to improve the adherence of all HCWs to universal precautions of hospital infection as suggested by other investigators [27] .",

The constitutional and legal system has sanctioned more superiority to male in terms of interaction of with other professionals, traveling around the world for symposiums, conferences and other health related activities. All these issues may affect the knowledge and attitude of female healthcare workers [30, 31] .",

The study showed that poor knowledge was more apparent in response to questions regarding the treatment of MERS, availability of vaccines and the consequences of MERs in which the rate of incorrect responses were 57.6%, 44% and 28.8% respectively. Mean knowledge score of healthcare worker was 9.45 \u00b1 1.69. Of 153 respondents, 126 (82.35%) showed positive attitude towards MERS while 27 (17.65%) participants displayed negative attitude about MERS. On average, the most negative attitude was shown the HCWs when asked whether their own participation in infection control program could reduce the prevalence of MERS (2.03 \u00b1 0.97). Conversely, majority of participants responded positively when queried about the use of gowns, gloves and other protective measures when dealing with MERS patient (1.52 \u00b1 0.84).
