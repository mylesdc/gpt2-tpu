A simple molecular method for rapid detection of ERG11 gene mutations would be an advantage as a screening tool to identify potentially-resistant strains and to track their movement. To complement DNA sequencing, we developed a padlock probe and rolling circle amplification (RCA)-based method to detect a series of mutations in the C. albicans ERG11 gene using \"reference\" azole-resistant isolates with known mutations. The method was then used to estimate the frequency of ERG11 mutations and their type in 25 Australian clinical C. albicans isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole and in 23 fluconazole-susceptible isolates. RCA results were compared DNA sequencing.",

When applied to 48 test strains, the RCA method showed 100% agreement with DNA sequencing where an ERG11 mutation-specific probe was used. Of 20 different missense mutations detected by sequencing in 24 of 25 (96%) isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility, 16 were detected by RCA. Five missense mutations were detected by both methods in 18 of 23 (78%) fluconazole-susceptible strains. DNA sequencing revealed that mutations in non-susceptible isolates were all due to homozygous nucleotide changes. With the exception of the mutations leading to amino acid substitution E266D, those in fluconazole-susceptible strains were heterozygous. Amino acid substitutions common to both sets of isolates were D116E, E266D, K128T, V437I and V488I. Substitutions unique to isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility were G464 S (n = 4 isolates), G448E (n = 3), G307S (n = 3), K143R (n = 3) and Y123H, S405F and R467K (each n = 1). DNA sequencing revealed a novel substitution, G450V, in one isolate.",

Azole antifungal drugs are the mainstay of management of such infections. However, with increased use of these agents, particularly fluconazole, treatment failures associated with the emergence of azole-resistant strains of C. albicans have occurred [3] [4] [5] [6] This has been most evident in HIV/AIDS patients receiving long-term therapy for OPC [3, 7] The azoles bind to and inhibit the activity of lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase (Erg11p), a key enzyme in the fungal ergosterol biosynthesis pathway [8] . Several mechanisms of resistance to azoles have been described in C. albicans. These include increased expression of the drug efflux pump genes such as MDR1, CDR1 and CDR2 [3, [9] [10] [11] , amino acid substitutions in the target enzyme Erg11p due to missense mutations in the ERG11 gene [3, 5, 10, [12] [13] [14] [15] and possibly, overexpression of ERG11 [3, 16] Importantly in any one isolate, resistance may be due to a combination of mechanisms [3] [4] [5] 15] .",

For example, substitutions such as Y132H, G450E, G464S, R467K and S405F appear to primarily impact on fluconazole and voriconazole, but not posaconazole, susceptibility [12, 13, 16, 17] The effect of substitutions can also be additive -strains with G129A and G464S substitutions display higher MICs azoles compared with those with the G129A substitution alone [18] . The contributions of yet other ERG11 mutations to resistance are uncertain [15, 19] . As most strains of C. albicans are diploid, nucleotide mutations may occur as homozygous (in both alleles) or as heterozygous (in one allele) substitutions; the association of either type of mutation with the resistant (or susceptible) phenotype is not well defined [3, 20] .",

            "text": "Nonetheless, since even single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ERG11 gene can have an impact on susceptibility and contribute to resistance [5, 13, 15, 18, 19, 21] , the documentation of these changes is important. To date, the frequency and clinical relevance of specific mutations in unselected azole-resistant isolates is poorly-defined [17] although in one survey, ERG11 mutations contributed to resistance in 65% of fluconazole-resistant C. albicans from HIV patients with OPC [5] . In clinical practice, detection of ERG11 mutations as potential markers or comarkers of resistance would assist both the identification and tracking of azole-resistant strains. Traditionally, DNA sequence analysis has been the standard for identifying ERG11 nucleotide changes [5, 14, 17, 19] However, circularisable or padlock probes have recently been shown to reliably detect SNPs with high specificity, offering a rapid simple alternative to sequencing [22, 23] . Padlock probes comprise three distinct regions: a central linker is flanked by sequences complementary to the 5' and 3' termini of the target sequence. Upon hybridisation to the target, the probe ends are brought together and are joined by DNA ligase to form a closed circular molecule in a highly targetdependent manner ( Figure 1 ). The intensity of the probe signal is then increased exponentially by rolling circle amplification (RCA) generating up to a 10 9 -fold signal amplification within 90 min [22] [23] [24] RCA-based assays have been successfully used to identify fungal pathogens [25, 26] but have not yet been applied to the detection of gene mutations associated with antifungal drug resistance.",

A better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to these agents as well as early detection of resistance are essential for patient management. Azole resistance is often due to a combination of factors including increased expression of efflux pumps and missense mutations in ERG11 [3] [4] [5] 15 ]. The latter have been linked to clinically-relevant increases in the MICs, not only to fluconazole, but also to the newer azoles voriconazole and posaconazole [4, 5, 10, 15] This proof of principle study highlights the great potential of a simple rapid (2 h) and highly-specific RCA-based SNP detection assay that can be readily be performed in the clinical laboratory for the detection and/or surveillance for ERG11 mutations. Using this method, we identified Erg11p amino acid substitutions in 24 of 25 previouslyuncharacterised Australian isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole.",

These included SNPs that were located close together such as those at nucleotides 1343, 1346 and 1349 corresponding to the amino acid substitutions G448E, F449S and G450E, respectively (Additional file 1). Importantly, identification of ERG11 mutations by the RCA assay was concordant with sequencing in all cases where an ERG11 mutation-specific probe was used. An additional finding was that even though probes (or pairs of probes) were not designed to detect heterozygous nucleotide substitutions per se, the RCA assay detected such changes in isolates containing an ERG11 mutation in only one allele, as demonstrated by their identification in fluconazole-susceptible isolates.",

Nineteen of the 20 amino acid substitutions, including G450V, present in the test isolates were clustered into the three \"hot-spot\" regions as described previously [19] . These hot spots include the residues 105-165 near the N-terminus of the protein, region 266-287 and region 405-488 located towards the C terminus of the protein. The exception was the G307S substitution (n = 3 isolates). However, in a computer-generated model of Erg11p, G307S is located close to the heme cofactor binding site.

This hypothesis can be tested by site-directed mutagenesis and expression studies of specific ERG11 alleles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using this approach, Sanglard and co-workers demonstrated that the substitutions G464S, Y132H, S405F and R467K were linked to azole resistance among their collection of isolates [12] ; similar studies are warranted to determine if the new substitution G450V is associated with resistance. Testing matched, susceptible and resistant, isolates from the same patient for ERG11 mutations may also assist in determining if particular mutations impact on azole resistance; unfortunately, matched isolates were not available in the present study. In general, neither the type or number of mutations in isolates sequentially obtained from the same patient correlated with azole MICs (Table 2) , emphasising the need to assess additional genes to understand the contribution of each to the resistance phenotype. As such, methods that detect polymorphisms are well-placed to screen large numbers of isolates from different sources for mutations and to guide functional testing of these isolates for resistance.",

            "text": "This study demonstrates a new application of a simple RCA-based technique for the rapid and accurate detection of SNPs in the ERG11 gene as potential markers of resistance and for the tracking of resistant strains. Other sequencing-independent methods include conventional real time PCR and/or other probe-based technologies eg. molecular beacons or TaqMan probes [30, 31] . Results using conventional real time PCR are well-known to be highly-dependent on the physical characteristics of the platform. Molecular beacons and TaqMan probe methods are conveniently available in the form of commercial kits. Although able to detect SNPs with good sensitivity [30, 31] , strict attention to the Tm of the probes is required to ensure adequate specificity. The RCA-based method described here offers several advantages over other amplification techniques in that ligation of the probe ends by DNA ligase requires perfectly-matched target-probe complexes preventing nonspecific amplification generated by conventional PCR and resulting in very high specificity. It is also rapid (2 h compared to 1-2 days for DNA sequencing following DNA extraction). Whilst the set-up costs of the assay are relatively high, (AUD 300 per probe), a typical commercial batch of each probe provides sufficient material for up to 5000 assays. Running costs are estimated at no more than AUD 2 per assay compared to AUD 15 for DNA sequencing. The limitations of RCA in the primary identification of resistance are acknowledged (see above). However, the technique is well-suited as an epidemiological tool for high throughput screening for commonly-encountered ERG11 SNPs to assist in the detection of potentially-resistant strains and to track the movement of such strains. Further, its utility in detecting SNPs in other genes that have been linked to azole resistance in C. albcians such as those encoding for the transcriptional activator of CDR1 (TAC1) and the transcriptional activator Upc2 (UPC2) [32, 33] warrant consideration.",

To increase the specificity, the 3'-end binding arm was designed to have a Tm (51-56\u00b0C) below the ligation temperature [25] .

Amplification was performed on a Mastercycler gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf AG, North Ryde, Australia). The thermal cycling conditions were 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 45 s, 58\u00b0C for 45 s, and 72\u00b0C for 90 s, with a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min.

Sequences were entered into a BLASTn sequence analysis search and analyzed using editing and analyses programs in the BioManager (ANGIS) facility (accessed via. http://angis.org.au/). and padlock probe design The ERG11 sequence of the azole-susceptible strain C. albicans ATCC 28526 as published by Marichal et al. (Gen-Bank database accession no. AF153844) was used for probe design. This sequence was chosen because C. albicans ATCC 28526 has been extensively characterised. A total of 24 padlock probes targeting 24 different ERG11 mutation sites were designed (Additional file 1). Ten of the 24 probes were designed to detect 10 mutations present in the \"reference\" isolates(Table 1); the remaining 14 targeted additional ERG11 mutations which have been identified in azole-resistant isolates",
