We argue that for effective management of global health a basic strategy should include at least three essential tactical forms: actions of a directly focused nature, institutional coordination, and disciplinary integration in approaches to health management. Each level of action is illustrated with examples from the livestock sector in Asia. No clear example of all three tactical forms in place can be found from developing countries where food security is a significant threat although Vietnam is developing a comprehensive strategy. Finally, an ecosystem health approach to global health management is advocated; such an approach moves away from the traditional single disciplinary approach. Stronger guidance is needed to direct ecohealth research and application in the management of global health.",

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic (There was and is still disagreement as to whether or not SARS was a pandemic. By the Center for Disease Control (CDC) standards, SARS was a pandemic (http://www. cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no11/04-0797 02.htm). The simplest WHO definition of a pandemic at the time was \"a worldwide epidemic of a disease\". Although the World Health Organization (WHO) did indeed declare that we had entered the early phases of a pandemic, the official declaration of the highest stage of a pandemic, Phase 6, was never made) in 2003 accentuated this point, as did the Influenza Type A/H1N1 outbreaks of 2009. But before one jumps to the erroneous conclusion that globalization is the new demon, we need to recall that there have long been global movements of disease with devastating consequences such as the smallpox epidemic brought upon the Aztecs by invading Spanish Conquistadors in the 1500s [1] . No doubt the infrastructural differences in today's world mean the risk of a pandemic is greater than 500 years ago but so too are our defenses, particularly in terms of scientific technologies, research and knowledge transfer capacity, and institutional coordination. This paper outlines a broad approach to framing a strategy for managing and improving global health. For a global health management strategy to be effective, we argue that tactics must take place in at least three essential forms: actions of a directly focused nature, institutional coordination, and disciplinary integration in approaches to health management. We illustrate each level of action with current examples from the livestock sector in Asia including village level interventions to increase food security in Bangladesh, an example from Vietnam of improved institutional integration and cooperation to control emerging infectious disease, and improved capacity of researchers and other health personnel to adopt an ecosystem approach to health management in Asia.",

Root problems may show themselves as poverty and hunger as a result of low incomes and lack of market access in remote villages in northern Bangladesh, lack of awareness or concern for environmental contamination resulting from factors (there are of course innumerable factors, but they include attitudes and preferences, sociocultural beliefs, and the cost of change) including low education or inappropriately distributed market power among stakeholders in livestock producing villages in Southeast Asia, or high institutional transaction costs that prevent collaboration or integration of high-level health management strategies in Vietnam.

They seem to emerge without apparent warning, they spread with great speed, and they impose severe threats to global health, ranging from human to animal to economic health. Over the last ten years, these and other nEIDs have appeared in either Bangladesh or Vietnam and sometimes both countries, resulting in significant impact on the health and livelihoods of communities through increased morbidity and mortality of humans and livestock. Furthermore, hundreds of millions of dollars of economic damage has been caused from disruptions in local and regional trade, as well as enforced cessation of livestock production. The impact has been most severe among the rural poorthose who are able least to invoke mitigation strategies to the risks posed by global health challenges. Changes in human socioeconomic conditions include job loss or abandonment leading to poverty and hunger, rapid population growth and uncontrolled urbanization, movements of political, economic, and environmental refugees, exploitative behaviors and policies, and new contacts between wild fauna and humans and their livestock have altered the emergence and transmission of nEIDs [2] . The impact and implications of these changes on the health of small-scale livestock producers can be severe, most particularly where zoonotic diseases are involved. For example, all 93 human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Vietnam, from 2003 to 2005, 42 of which were fatal, had a history of exposure to sick poultry [3] .",

More than 50% of rural livelihoods depend on livestock for nutrition and cash income in both Vietnam [6] and Bangladesh [7] , and because the majority of small-scale livestock keepers are women, livestock also generates employment for women and offers them economic decision making power. The importance of this last point is often not fully appreciated with respect to decisions for the welfare of the household. When women who raise livestock are able to decide how and when the income is spent on the household, then they have control over varying and balancing food inputs for children and infants, increasing food security and improving the health of their family.",

This is a major precipitating factor for health problems among the rural poor, leading to low birth weight, delayed physical and mental development, and susceptibility to infections [10] . The use of livestock and horticulture has been accepted as a suitable intervention by some villagers in the Chars area [11] with initial success. Extending this intervention, integrated agriculture (the incorporation of sustainable crop and livestock practices) in an ecohealth (ecohealth can be defined as the field of study and practice that uses systemic and participatory approaches to understanding and promoting health and well being in the context of complex socialecological interactions) framework has been introduced as an additional option to address these extreme problems [12] . Preliminary results indicate that household income increased 60-70% when farmers invested in dairy cattle, allowing for economic decisions to be made (and increasing the role of women in making those decisions) regarding purchases of food, clothing, and medicine, and allowing for children to attend local Despite this step towards eradicating poverty in the Chars region of Bangladesh, major constraints remain. Productivity of cattle is low due to poor genetics and weak knowledge of management skills, there is limited integration of environmental sustainability options, and coliform bacteria from livestock pose a health hazard to humans who live in close contact with their livestock day and night. The latter is of more than local concern for the reasons described already; recent changes in Escherichia coli have been noted globally, generating apprehension over the possibility of the emergence from the livestock sector of \"super-bugs\" resistant to available antibiotics and generating world-wide concerns for health of animals and humans. This is also one of the reasons, consistent with observations of the World Health Organization, that poor livestock keepers are more likely to bear the brunt of the impact of zoonotic disease [13] .",

Regrettably, the other two essential forms of tactics are in relatively early stages in Bangladesh. Disciplinary integration in approaches to health management is rare, and institutional coordination is the exception rather than the rule, largely due to financial, educational, and to some extent political barriers at the level of institutions. Early progress has been made in the form of a National Livestock Policy that advocates these concepts with an action plan although this policy is yet to be ratified by the Government of Bangladesh [14] . This is an important step towards policy support for an integrated approach that will include improved access to health and agricultural services and targeted technical interventions intended to address poverty while leaving intact options for small-scale backyard livestock keeping.",

Livestock policy responses addressing poverty alleviation have tended to focus on intensive short-term interventions targeting single nEIDs (e.g., HPAI control policies in SEAsia), generally within the confines of solitary disciplines rather than long-term sustainable solutions which integrate truly transdisciplinary approaches. In Vietnam, emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) such as avian influenza and the association of livestock with EIDs have generated considerable control-based activities, particularly at the farm level [16] . For highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and occasionally for pig diseases including swine influenza (H1N1), options have included broad-scale depopulation, targeted culling, movement control, segregation of species of livestock, and vaccination. Knowledge of coordinated large-scale response programmes has increased, and Vietnamese government agencies have developed well-planned and-implemented programmes to respond to nEIDs such as HPAI. Evidence from Vietnam and Thailand indicates that while such programmes may reduce the risk of EIDs after farms have become infected, they do not address pre-infection strategies [17] . Furthermore, they do little to address the longerterm economic and household nutrition needs of poor rural households that are likely to be engaging in small-scale raising of livestock.",

Visits to participating communes in Vietnam in 2009 by the authors revealed that less than 10-15% of households had adopted more than two of eight main recommendations [19] ; no formal study has been published from study of these communes to examine the reasons for low adoption and implementation or the impact on health of women and children. Although the use of a multidisciplinary team is a giant step in a positive direction, we believe that part of the reason for low adoption may well be the focus on a single species outcome rather than an integrated outcome that balances environmental sustainability with community partnership and free choice of economic activities. In other words, results from adopting integrated agriculture and ecosystem approaches to health management have to be driven by basic understanding of the transdisciplinary issues and by free choice to engage in economic activities.",

The JP is a solid example of multi-institutional effort to address nEIDs and national health inequities using the resources of numerous government ministries and international nongovernment agencies. The JP initially addressed the immediate emergency support needed to control the outbreaks of HPAI that started in 2005. The programme has continued to a new phase in which design and implementation has included international coordination/technical assistance, communication, agriculture (livestock production and animal health), and human health involving the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), the Ministry of Health (MoH), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), and the World Health Organization (WHO). The overall objective of the program is \"to reduce the health risk to humans from avian influenza by controlling the disease at source in domestic poultry, by detecting and responding promptly to human cases, and by preparing for the medical consequences of a human pandemic.\" More specifically, the program aims at reduced risk of a global pandemic of HPAI emanating from Viet Nam and enhanced national and local capacity to manage outbreaks of diseases of epidemic potential caused by human and animal pathogens.",

However, the concept of sustainable ecosystem health to prevent emerging infectious disease is present in bits and pieces of activities throughout the JP (e.g., surveillance, training of community animal and human health workers, communication, vaccination, and restructuring) but is not a major pillar of understanding behind many of the activities (and was not intended to be). It was also recommended that although an ecohealth philosophy is evidently emerging in the JP strategy, wider knowledge of an ecohealth approach is needed, particularly at lower administrative levels, in order to appreciate the integrated roles of managing the interfaces of animals, humans, and the environment. Most importantly, this must be directed at nEIDs in general, rather than (e.g.,) HPAI or Influenza Type A/H1N1. Expanding this concept, as a broader theme is current being considered in the development of the new phase of the JP.",

This is not the only project in the region that aims to build capacity in an ecohealth approach to management of health.

Each of the three essential forms of tactics that we have identified would be important for implementing results of ecohealth research, but the groundwork in ecohealth research is still in its formative stages. We are calling for more research directed to ecosystem approaches to health management in order to inform development of sustainable solutions that improve the health and livelihoods of communities. Such approaches examine animal and human health as well as environmental and socioeconomic health and the complex interrelationships between these four dimensions. Understanding these complexities is critical to exploring the causes of nEIDs and to proposing recommendations for sustainable changes, particularly with respect to methods for raising livestock in a sustainable integrated agricultural system in low income countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, barriers to adoption and implementation of such methods, the role of health policy at local, national, and regional levels in promoting and supporting recommended programmes, evaluation of the impact on production, and impact on reducing the precipitating factors of nEIDs. In the particular case of an ecohealth approach that includes livestock within an integrated agriculture system, the goal of improving livelihoods through increased food security will be achieved through healthier livestock and humans, leading to improvements in productivity, increased incomes, and a greater degree of control over economic decision making at the household and community level. Ultimately this means less risk of health inequities in agricultural communities in poor countries and a reduction in global poverty and hunger.",

Evidence from developing countries indicates that this is indeed the general philosophy that has been adopted by governments, research institutions, the nongovernment sector, and other stakeholders working in poverty alleviation through livestock production and integrated agricultural development. It is difficult to find a clear example of all three forms of tactics in use, but the examples presented from Vietnam perhaps present the model in place that comes closest to illustrating this broad approach.",

The latter is not without its challenges, but the JP has been successful enough to warrant its use as a model for a broader One UN concept in which governments, international institutions, and development agencies bridge the sometimes enormous gaps between their institutions to share resources and engage in transdisciplinary problem solving in order to build sustainable solutions to global resources through global health management.",
