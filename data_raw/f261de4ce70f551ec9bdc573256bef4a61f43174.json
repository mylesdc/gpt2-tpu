This high-risk group of infection was previously identified by conducting large-scale visits/interviews, or manually screening among tons of recorded surveillance videos. Both are time-intensive and most likely to delay the control of communicable diseases like influenza. In this paper, we address this challenge by solving a multi-tasking problem from the captured surveillance videos. This multi-tasking framework aims to model the principle of Close Proximity Interaction and thus infer the infection risk of individuals. The complete workflow includes three essential sub-tasks: (1) person re-identification (REID), to identify the diagnosed patient and infected individuals across different cameras, (2) depth estimation, to provide a spatial knowledge of the captured environment, (3) pose estimation, to evaluate the distance between the diagnosed and potentially-infected subjects. Our method significantly reduces the time and labor costs. We demonstrate the advantages of high accuracy and efficiency of our method. Our method is expected to be effective in accelerating the process of identifying the potentially infected group and ultimately contribute to the well-being of public health.",

Influenza alone leads to a projected annual cost of 2.0-5.8 billion USD for the American health-care system (Yan et al., 2017) .

Manual approaches (surveys and interviews) require a significant amount of human efforts, while wearable devices introduce additional cost and are limited to small-scale study. Open challenges remain in the development of methods to fast capture the contact networks. Given the high density of surveillance cameras in metropolitans, the impact of using captured videos to identify the contact networks is under-explored. However, two significant challenges exist for this vision-based method: (1) re-identify the diagnosed patient in non-overlapping monitor cameras and (2) assess the potential risk of infection in the exposed population. The most popular solution to identify a specific person from videos is currently face recognition. However, poor illumination and camera viewpoint make it difficult for existing face recognition method to achieve satisfactory performance. Overlapping and occlusion of multiple faces also create significant difficulties. Meanwhile, it is nontrivial to assess the infectious risk from the captured video quantitatively. How to obtain a robust estimation of the interaction between the detected subjects in the video is still an open question.",

The contact in close distance between an infectious individual and the population leads to the spread of respiratory infections (Leung et al., 2017) . This paper investigates the diseases transmitted via droplets. The conventional methods started with social surveys, by asking participants to report their contact patterns, including the number/duration of contacts and other demographical information (including age, gender, household size) (Eames et al., 2012; Read et al., 2014; Dodd et al., 2015) . Understanding the contact pattern allows us to build parameterized models and capture the transmission patterns. Leung et al. (2017) proposed a diary-based design, using both paper and online questionnaires, and found out that the approach of using paper questionnaires leads to an increasing report of contacts and longer contact duration than using online questionnaires. However, conducting such social surveys and questionnaires requires a significant amount of time and effort.",

Researchers compared the two methods of reporting with paper diaries and recording with wearable sensors, to monitor the contact pattern at a conference (Smieszek et al., 2016) . They found out that reporting was notably incomplete for contacts <5 min, and participants appear to have overestimated the duration of their contacts.

It aims at reidentifying the person of interest from a collection of images or videos taken by multiple non-overlapping cameras in a large distributed space over a prolonged period. Re-ID is fundamentally challenging due to three difficulties: (1) diverse visual appearance changes caused by variations in view angle, lighting, background clutter, and occlusion. (2) difficulties in producing discriminating feature representation invariant to background clutter. (3) over-fitting problem due to the limited scale of a tagged dataset.",

The combined representation includes both the view captured by the camera and joint locations, which ensures the discriminating embedding. Song et al. (2018) proposed a mask-guided contrastive attention model to learn features separately from the background and human bodies. Their work takes the binary body mask as input to remove the background in pixel-level and use gait information as features. However, failure cases will happen when discriminative body parts are missing. Horizontal Pyramid Matching (HPM) approach is proposed by Fu et al. (2018) , solving this problem by using partial feature representations at different horizontal pyramid scales and adopting average and max pooling for inter-person variations. For similarity measurement, metric learning approaches are exploited such as cross-view quadratic discriminant analysis (Liao et al., 2015) , relative distance comparison optimization (PRDC algorithm) (Zheng et al., 2011) , locally-adaptive decision functions (LADF) (Li et al., 2013) and etc.",

The cameras are located on three floors, and 13 cameras have been fully labeled. The floor plans are offered on the dataset website 1 . To accurately evaluate our method, we choose four labeled cameras (camera ID: 50/54/58/60) on Floor 7 and analyze the contact patterns between the detected persons. Camera 50 and 60 are placed toward the corridor, Camera 54 captures an indoor office room, and Camera 58 monitors a lobby at the lift. These are typical scenarios in an office environment. Figure 4 plots the distance between subjects (marked as ID: 15, 22, 24, 32) in Camera 50. We here assume that the subject of ID:24 is the diagnosed patient and compute the relative distance with other subjects who appear in this camera. Because there is no direct body contact in this scenario, we use the distance between the body centers (the hip joints) of two subjects for the visual demonstration. The results show that the predicted distance between the two subjects is consistent with the perception in the real world.

Besides, the potential risk of infection varies according to different environmental set-ups and transmission routes of infectious diseases. A confined space like a room may lead to a higher risk than an open space. The cumulative effect of continuously contact over a while rather than a particular moment is difficult to measure. Besides, it is worth pointing out that we do not take the intra-person variations of immunity into account since it cannot be measured at the vision-level.",

Investigating the indirect infection caused by contaminated objects is in line with our future work. Besides, deploying our method in an in-the-wild study could validate the effectiveness of our method in the real world. One potential scenario is to predict the absentee statistics of the childcare center, given the surveillance camera videos.
