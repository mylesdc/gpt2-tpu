            "text": "Mucosal immunization of influenza vaccine is potentially an effective approach for the prevention and control of influenza. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the ability of oral immunization with a non-recombinant Lactococcus lactis displaying HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein, LL-HA1/L/AcmA, to induce mucosal immune responses and to accord protection against influenza virus infection in mice. The LL-HA1/L/AcmA was orally administered into mice and the immune response was evaluated. Mice immunized with LL-HA1/L/ AcmA developed detectable specific sIgA in faecal extract, small intestine wash, BAL fluid and nasal fluid. The results obtained demonstrated that oral immunization of mice with LL-HA1/L/AcmA elicited mucosal immunity in both the gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory tract. The protective efficacy of LL-HA1/L/AcmA in immunized mice against a lethal dose challenge with influenza virus was also assessed. Upon challenge, the non-immunized group of mice showed high susceptibility to influenza virus infection. In contrast, 7/8 of mice orally immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA survived. In conclusion, oral administration of LL-HA1/L/AcmA in mice induced mucosal immunity and most importantly, provided protection against lethal influenza virus challenge. These results highlight the potential application of L. lactis as a platform for delivery of influenza virus vaccine.

            "text": "Influenza virus infection results in respiratory illnesses and contributes to a high rate of morbidity and mortality in humans, particularly children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Three influenza pandemics had occurred in the 20 th century: 1918 Spanish flu, 1957-1958 Asian influenza and 1968 Hong Kong influenza, while one recently occurred in the 21 st century: 2009 pandemic H1N1 [1] . Besides pandemic influenza, seasonal epidemics of influenza is also of great concern, as it causes approximately 3-5 million of severe illness and Optimization of L. lactis binding conditions L. lactis displaying HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein was prepared as previously described [25] . Briefly, an overnight culture of L. lactis MG1363 was subcultured in GM17 broth and incubated at 30\u02daC until the OD 600 reading reached 0.5. The L. lactis culture (2 ml) was centrifuged at 2,000 \u00d7g for 10 min and the cell pellet obtained was resuspended in fresh GM17 broth (0.6 ml). Subsequently, refolded HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein (100 \u03bcl) was prepared as previously described [25] and added to the cell suspension and incubated at 30\u02daC for 2 h. The cells were then washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) thrice by centrifugation at 2,000 \u00d7g for 10 min. The cell pellet was eventually resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of PBS. Optimizations were performed to improve the binding of HA1/L/AcmA to L. lactis by varying the binding parameters, specifically the amount of recombinant protein (25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 \u03bcg) added to equal number of L. lactis cells, the duration of binding (1, 2, 3 and 4 h), and the type of binding buffer (GM17 and PBS). Other factors that may influence the binding of recombinant protein onto L. lactis, including pH and temperature were not examined as these factors may affect the integrity of the cell membrane and other biological processes of L. lactis, which may then affect the binding of recombinant proteins on the bacterial cell wall. After binding, the L. lactis cells pre-mixed with the HA1/L/AcmA were stained and analyzed using flow cytometry as previously described [25] . Briefly, cells were fixed with 200 \u03bcl of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min and blocked with 200 \u03bcl of 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with 200 \u03bcl of mouse monoclonal anti-polyhistidine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 1:1,000 dilution for 1 h, followed by incubation with 200 \u03bcl of Alexa Fluor1 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen Life Technologies, USA) at 1:500 dilution in the dark for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS between steps thrice and recovered by centrifugation at 2,000 \u00d7g for 10 min. The cells were eventually suspended in 1 ml of PBS for examination of stained cells using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) CANTO \u2122 II Flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA). A total of 5\u00d710 4 cells falling into the gate defined on the forward angle light scatter-side angle light scatter plot were acquired to determine the positive cell count and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI).",

HA1/L/AcmA-specific sIgA in faecal extract, small intestine wash, BAL fluid and nasal fluid were measured as main readout of mucosal immunity. The HA1/L/AcmA-specific sIgA in faecal sample (Fig 2C) was noted to be higher, but there was no statistically difference between mice immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA (mean OD: 0.59\u00b10.11) and the PBS-treated group (mean OD: 0.36\u00b10.09).

Changes in body weight and survival of mice were monitored daily as measure of disease severity. All non-immunized mice were susceptible to influenza infection, showing sickness such as decreased activity and huddling by day 3 postinfection (p.i.). Severe sickness such as hunched posture, ruffled fur and increased body weight loss of up to 20% were observed within day 8 p.i. (Fig 4A) . The rate of body weight loss calculated by linear regression analysis was -2.7\u00b10.1 and the maximum percentage change in body weight observed in individual mice over 14 days after lethal challenge with influenza virus was 20.6\u00b10.1% (Table 1 ). In contrast, body weight of mice in LL-HA1/L/AcmA-treated and HA1/L/ AcmA-treated group decreased until day 6 and 7 p.i., respectively, after which mice in both groups recorded an increase in their body weight till day 14 p.i.

A lower rate of body weight loss was observed in the LL-HA1/L/AcmA-treated (-0.3\u00b10.1) and HA1/L/AcmA-treated group (-0.6\u00b10.1), respectively, as compared to non-immunized mice (-2.7\u00b10.1) ( Table 1) . Significantly lower percentage change in body weight was noted in LL-HA1/L/AcmA-treated (11.6 \u00b12.5%) (p<0.01) and HA1/L/AcmA-treated group (15.7\u00b11.8%) (p<0.05) than the non-immunized mice. In contrast, the positive control group, which were mice immunized subcutaneously with HA1/L/AcmA-FA did not show body weight loss upon exposure to influenza virus (Fig 4A) . The mice instead recorded rate of body weight gain of 0.2\u00b10.0 (Table 1 ). In addition, there was significantly lower percentage change in body weight (p<0.001) in this HA1/L/ AcmA-FA-treated group (1.5\u00b10.7%) compared to the non-immunized group (Table 1 ). These data indicated that mice orally immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA or HA1/L/AcmA resulted in significantly less morbidity upon exposure to influenza virus. Mice in the HA1/L/AcmA-treated group suffered more severe sickness as presented by highest rate of body weight loss and percentage change in body weight among the treated group. Subcutaneous immunization of HA1/ L/AcmA-FA in mice did not result in any morbidity upon exposure to virus. Collectively, it was demonstrated that oral immunization of LL-HA1/L/AcmA is superior in reducing morbidity upon exposure to influenza virus compared to the HA1/L/AcmA without L. lactis as a carrier.",

Survival rate of mice immunized with HA1/L/AcmA-FA was the highest and significantly different (p<0.001) from non-immunized group, with all mice fully protected from the challenge (8/8, 100% ). There were no differences in the survival between all the immunized groups. As for non-immunized group, all mice were not protected (0/8, 0%) and the mean day of death was 7.0\u00b10.5 p.i. The mean day of death LL-HA1/L/AcmA-treated and HA1/L/AcmA-treated group was 8.0\u00b10.0 p.i. and 7.0\u00b10.0 p.i., respectively. Importantly, oral immunization of mice with LL-HA1/L/AcmA or HA1/L/ AcmA, or subcutaneous immunization with HA1/L/AcmA-FA provided protection to the animals against a lethal challenge with influenza virus.",

As such, while antiviral therapy has been available, vaccination is still the most effective strategy for the prevention and control of influenza. There is growing interest in mucosal vaccines due to their advantages over conventional injectable vaccines. Side effects associated with conventional vaccines, such as local reactions at the injection site are potentially reduced with implementation of mucosal vaccines. The need for needles during vaccine administration is also avoided, eliminating the possibility of blood transmissible infections [29, 30] . Moreover, mucosal vaccination can be easily administered without a trained personnel, thus considered a more favorable approach for mass vaccination [31] .",

            "text": "Most pathogens, including influenza viruses, initiate infection by entering the human body through mucosal surfaces. Mucosal vaccination stimulates this natural infection and can provide local immune protection by stimulating sIgA at the mucosal surfaces. SIgA is the most abundant immunoglobulin isotype present in human secretions [32] and is effective in according protection against influenza virus infection [33] . It has been reported to be more important than IgG in the protection of upper respiratory tract, specifically the nose and trachea [34] , primarily by reducing virus attachment and preventing internalization of the virus at the mucosal surfaces, thereby preventing infection [34, 35] . In addition, sIgA provides cross-protection against other subtypes of influenza virus [33, [36] [37] [38] . Cross-protection is particularly desirable due to the frequent antigenic changes that influenza viruses constantly undergo. Of the various mucosal immunization approaches, L. lactis is being explored as an effective vaccine vehicle. We previously developed a recombinant L. lactis displaying influenza HA1 and evaluated the immunity elicited by this recombinant construct in mice [28] . This recombinant L. lactis carried the HA1 gene that was genetically introduced into a vector containing an antibiotic resistance gene. The presence of this antibiotic resistance gene could eventually be a matter of concern, particularly the transfer of its antibiotic resistance gene to another organism when L. lactis is released in the field [39] . An approach utilizing a non-recombinant L. lactis will be advantageous as it is likely to overcome this concern, and hence be better accepted by the public. We subsequently developed a non-recombinant L. lactis displaying influenza HA1, LL-HA1/L/AcmA [25] , and evaluated its ability in the stimulation of mucosal immunity in this present study.",

The result is consistent with previous studies showing that oral immunization with L. lactis displaying antigens induced sIgA at sites other than the gastrointestinal tract [22, 24, [40] [41] [42] . The results of sIgA at other mucosal sites could be due to intestinally derived IgA plasma cells expressing CCR10 homing receptor that migrated towards the CCL28 cytokine, which is secreted by mucosal epithelial tissues present at sites such as large intestine, stomach, trachea, bronchi, mammary glands and salivary glands [43] . These migrated intestinal IgA plasma cells then populate the mucosal sites, and secrete HA1/L/AcmA-specific sIgA. Therefore, oral immunization could lead to presence of antigen specific IgA in both intestinal and non-intestinal mucosal tissues [44, 45] .",

The result obtained was in contrast with several studies that had demonstrated oral immunization of antigen using L. lactis elicited specific IgG in serum in addition to specific sIgA in faecal extract [9, 11, 12, [46] [47] [48] . Although mice immunized orally with LL-HA1/L/AcmA elicited significant mucosal immune response only, and not systemic immune response, more importantly, it was demonstrated that LL-HA1/L/AcmA could provide up to 88% protection in mice against a lethal challenge with influenza virus. An earlier study on mice immunized orally with L. lactis expressing HA of influenza H5N1 showed significant increase in specific serum IgG and intestinal IgA, but IgA was not detected in tracheal mucosal and only 30% mice were protected upon viral challenge [46] . Therefore, in this study, the protection in mice was likely due to the presence of sIgA specific against HA1 in the respiratory tract, which was possibly activated upon oral immunization. It would be beneficial to evaluate the neutralization ability of the sIgA induced by LL-HA1/L/AcmA by measuring its capability to inhibit influenza virus A (H1N1) in vitro, however it could not be examined due to the limitation of samples obtained. Besides sIgA, there are other protective mechanisms, such as T cell-mediated immunity, which may play a protective role by clearing the established infection and reducing disease severity [49, 50] . Therefore, additional studies are needed to elucidate the specific mechanism of protection by LL-HA1/L/AcmA. Nonetheless, the findings obtained highlight the importance of mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract in according protection against influenza virus challenge.",

Mice immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA also suffered less sickness and body weight loss upon lethal challenge with influenza virus. These results were in agreement with several earlier studies that oral immunization with L. lactis displaying antigen is more efficient than a simple antigen alone oral immunization [15, 47, 51] . The potential adjuvant effects of using L. lactis in oral immunization could be attributed to the presence of bacterial components that can stimulate innate immunity, leading to adaptive immunity [52] . Besides, L. lactis presenting heterologous antigen as a particle to the immune system, is more superior to soluble antigen presented on its own, particularly if the vaccine is to be delivered orally [53] . As the present study is focused only on the protection of LL-HA1/ L/AcmA in mice against homosubtypic influenza virus challenge, heterosubtypic influenza virus challenge can now be explored. Further investigation to surface display antigens from multiple influenza subtypes on a single L. lactis cell as candidate vaccine to render protection against a broad range of influenza subtypes can also be performed.",
