We previously showed that PGE 2 stimulated lung cancer cell growth and progression through PGE 2 receptor EP2/EP4-mediated kinase signaling pathways. However, the role of PGE 2 in controlling lung airway epithelial cell phenotype remains unknown. We evaluated the effects of c-Jun and 3-phosphoinositede dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE 2 .",

PDK1 siRNA and a PDK1 inhibitor blocked the effects of PGE 2 on normal cell growth. The PGE 2induced PDK1 expression was blocked by an antagonist of the PGE 2 receptor subtype EP4 and by EP4 siRNA. In addition, we showed that induction of PDK1 by PGE 2 was associated with induction of the transcription factor, c-Jun protein. Silencing of c-Jun using siRNA and point mutations of c-Jun sites in the PDK1 gene promoter resulted in blockade of PDK1 expression and promoter activity induced by PGE 2 . In contrast, overexpression of c-Jun induced PDK1 gene promoter activity and expression followed increased cell proliferation.",

An estimated 226,160 new cases of lung cancer was diagnosed in 2012 in the United States alone, and 160,340 lung cancer deaths are estimated to occur [1] . Chronic inflammation has been associated with an increased risk of cancer. Protein levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a mediator of inflammation, were reported elevated in several cancer types, including colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers, and suppression of either COX-2 expression or COX-2 activation, is being considered for cancer prevention and therapy [2] . Of the five prostaglandins (PG) produced by COX-2, PGE 2 appeared to play essential roles in tumor cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression [3] [4] [5] . Four receptor subtypes are known to bind PGE 2 , and they are named EP1-4. These receptors have also been implicated in tumor cell growth and progression [6, 7] . PGE 2 is increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also showing a higher incidence of lung cancer [8] .",

As an upstream regulator of AKT, PDK1 signaling is thought to play a key role in cancer cell growth, survival and tumor angiogenesis [10, 11] . Studies have shown high levels of activated PDK1 in a large percentage of common tumor types, including melanoma, breast, lung, gastric, prostate, hematological, and ovarian cancers [12] . When activated in tumor cells, Akt also has multiple effects that promote disease progression, including suppression of apoptosis and stimulation of tumor cell proliferation, metabolism, and angiogenesis [13] [14] [15] . Thus, the PDK1/Akt signaling pathway represents an attractive target for the development of small molecule inhibitors that may be useful in the treatment of cancer. However, the effects of PGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cells are not clear. Here, we explore the effects of PGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation and the intracellular signals involved in this process. Our studies show that PGE 2 stimulates human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through the EP4 receptor and activation of c-Jun, which increases the expression of PDK1.",

            "text": "The transformation is driven by both endogenous and exogenous factors including chemical agents that induce the activation of cancer-promoting genes. Accumulating epidemiologic and clinical data provide a strong link between inflammation and cancer initiation and progression [20, 21] , but the molecular inflammatory determinants remain to be established. COX-2 derived PGE 2 is a proinflammatory bioactive lipid and is the major prostaglandin produced in many human solid tumors, including cancer of the colon [22] , stomach [23] , breast [24] and lung [25] . PGE 2 and its receptors play an essential role in promoting cancer progression. For example, PGE 2 significantly enhanced carcinogen induced colon tumor incidence and multiplicity in rats. PGE 2 accelerates intestinal adenoma growth in Apc Min mice [26] . However, the effects of PGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cells are not clear.. Therefore, we will focus on PGE2 and its receptors and its downstream targets in human bronchial epithelial cells, and explore the potential mechanism. This is the first study on the effects of PGE 2 in inducing the activation of cancerpromoting genes in normal bronchial epithelial cells. In concordance with studies performed in tumor cells before, we demonstrate PGE 2 increases normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation, through increased PDK1 gene expression that is dependent on EP4 and induction of c-Jun. It unveils a novel role of c-Jun and PDK1 in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE 2 . Three-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) is a major mediator of cellular signaling between phosphoinositide-3 kinase and various intracellular serine/ threonine kinases, including PKB, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase, serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase, and protein kinase. PDK1 is able to phosphorylate Thr-308 on PKB\u03b1 [27, 28] , which has been shown to play a crucial role in normal and pathophysical conditions. Activation of PDK1 has been shown to regulate cell survival and growth, cell cycle progression, gene expression and differention [9, 29] . Autophosphorylation and growth-factorinduced phosphorylation in its activation loop is required for PDK1 activity [30] . S241A mutation abolished PDK1 catalytic activity completely, which suggests phosphorylation at Ser-241 is important for PDK1 signaling [31] . There is increasing evidence that PDK1 is involved in cancer progression and invasion. Tissue microarray analysis of human invasive breast cancer has revealed that phosphorylation of PDK1 on Ser-241 was strongly enhanced in 90 % of the samples tested [11] . Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-phospho-Tyr-9 antibodies demonstrated that the level of Tyr-9 phosphorylation is increased markly in diseased lung, liver, colon, and breast tissue compared to normal tissue [12] . Studies have shown that angiotension-II-induced focal adhesion formation is inhibited by infection with Adeno-PDK1-Y9F via paxillin [10] . This regulation of focal adhesion suggests that PDK1 participates in integrating signals that control cell growth, apoptosis and migration. PDK1 gene has been assoiated with poor differentiation of late stage lung cancer [32] . PDK1 was shown capable of augmenting tumorigenesis in tissues harboring ERBB2 amplifications [33] , PTEN deletions [34] , and mutations in the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIK3CA) [35] . Inhibition of PDK1 is therefore expected to attenuate tumors associated with deregulated PIK3CA/PTEN signaling. Indeed, hypomorphic mutation of PDK1 in Pten +/\u2212 mice delays the onset of tumorigenesis, and small molecule inhibitors of PDK1 inhibit tumor xenografts and lung colonization [36] . Further, PDK1 inactivation effectively attenuated the development of Kras oncogene-driven pancreatic cancer, but not NSCLC, further supporting the importance of PDK1 in tumor development, albeit, in select cancer types [37] . Here, we found that PGE2 increased the expression of PDK1 in bronchial epithelial cells. Overexpression of PDK1 enhanced cell proliferation, while cells stimulated with PDK1 inhibitor or siRNA reduced cell growth. These findings provides the first genetic evidence that PDK1 may also play an essential role in abnormally enhanced cell proliferation induced by PGE2 in bronchial epithelial cells, which was convinced in tumor cells in previous studies. Consistent with former studies, PDK1 inactivations by small molecule inhibitor of PDK1 or siRNA effectively attenuated cell proliferation in bronchial epithelial cells, supporting the potential importance of PDK1 in NSCLC development. PDK1 also plays a crucial role in metastasis. This kinase mediates mammary epithelial cell growth and invasion in the transformed phenotype, in part, by membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) induction, which in turn activates MMP-2 and modulates the extracellular matrix proteins decorin and collagen [11] . Knockdown of PDK1 inhibits spontaneous migration and epidermal-growth-factor-induced chemotaxis in breast cancer cells. In severe combined immunodeficiency mice, PDK1-depleted human breast cancer cells form tumors more slowly and are defective in extravasation to the lungs after intravenous injection [38] . These results indicate that PDK1 plays an important role in regulating malignancy in breast cancer cells. Moreover, reducing PDK1 expression in PTEN +/\u2212 mice protects these animals from developing a wide range of tumors [36] , thereby providing genetic evidence that PDK1 is a key effector in mediating neoplasia that result from loss of PTEN. In addition, PDK1 is an upstream kinase of AKT, which regulates activities of AKT, in turn, mediates the regulation of tumor cell growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis [39] . All these results validate PDK1 is a promising anticancer target for the prevention of tumors.",

The central role of PGE2 in tumor-genesis has been further confirmed through homozygous deletion of its receptors. Mice with homozygous deletion in EP1 and EP4 receptors, but not EP3, were partially resistant to colon carcinogen mediated induction of aberrant crypt foci [41, 42] . EP2 disruption decreases the number and size of intestinal polyps in APC \u25b3716 knockout mice [43] . In addition to colorectal cancer, it has been shown that EP1, 2, and 4 receptors were elevated whereas EP3 receptor levels were decreased in mammary tumors in COX-2-MMTV mice [44] . It was showed that PGE 2 promotes lung cancer cell migration via EP4-betaArrestin1-c-Src pathway [45] . In this study, blockade of EP4 by antagonists or by EP4 siRNA resulted in reduced PDK1 protein expression and activity of PDK1 promoter, suggesting that EP4 mediates the effect of PGE2 on PDK1 expression in normal bronchial epithelial cells. The EP4 receptor can activate several pathways that involve cell proliferation, adhesion, invasion and migration. These main molecules include G protein, adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A, exchange protein directly activated by cAMP, phosphodiesterase, phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Most recently, we found that the EP4 receptor could increase the expression of JNK [16] , which has been found to play a pivotal role in activating transcription factors (including c-Jun) that increase cellular growth and tumor formation in NSCLC cells. We also showed that activation of PI3-K, PKA, and JNK induced by EP4 was involved in the effect of PGE 2 on c-jun in NSCLC [46] .",

            "text": "Specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades control the activation of fos and jun family protooncogenes and their protein products (c-Jun and c-Fos) are known as the AP-1 family members. These \"early response protooncogene\" products dimerize to form the AP-1 transcription factor, a converging point that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, transformation, inflammation, pulmonary defense, and autoregulation of AP-1 gene transcription [46] . Early studies [47, 48] suggested that c-Jun had a role in early events in the pathogenesis of lung cancers because it was highly expressed in 31-50 % of patients with nonsmall cell cancers, and it was also upregulated in atypical bronchial epithelium. One study showed a transgenic mouse model directing conditional expression of the dominant-negative c-Jun mutant TAM67 in lung epithelial cells decreased tumor number and overall lung tumor burden in chemically induced mouse lung tumor models [49] . c-Jun is an important transcriptional activator of PDK1. Notably, expression of PDK1 is sufficient to restore tumor growth after c-Jun knockdown in melanoma cells, suggesting that PDK1 is an important mediator of c-Jun oncogenic activities [50] . Consistent with this, we found that PGE 2 increased the expression of c-Jun and exogenous overexpression of c-Jun enhanced bronchial epithelial cells proliferation and expression of PDK1, whereas inhibition by PDK1 inhibitor or siRNA caused inhibitions of cell growth and expression of PDK1. This suggests that c-Jun is an upstream regulator of PDK1 signaling. Induction of c-Jun by PGE 2 regulates the expression and activation of PDK1 and cell growth. It indicated c-Jun might play an important role in the potential mechanism of abnormal cell proliferation in brochial epithelial cells.",
