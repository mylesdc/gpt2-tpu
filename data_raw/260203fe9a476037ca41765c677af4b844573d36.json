They were identified as (-)-sesamin ( ), helioxanthin ( ), savinin ( ), taiwanin C ( ), 6-methoxy-7-hydroxycoumarin ( ), behenic acid ( ), 3-O-caffeoyl-quinic acid ( ), 5-O-caffeoyl-quinic acid ( ), 1,3-di-O-caffeoyl-quinic acid ( ), 1,4-di-O-caffeoyl-quinic acid ( ), 1,5-di-O-caffeoyl-quinic acid ( ), (+)-threo-(7R,8R)guaiacylglycerol--coniferyl aldehyde ether ( ), (+)-erythro-(7S,8R)-guaiacylglycerol--coniferyl aldehyde ether ( ), ferulic acid ( ), caffeic acid ( ), stigmasterol ( ), -sitosterol ( ), adenosine ( ), syringin ( ), and trans-coniferin ( ). Among these isolates, compound showed inhibitory activity against lipopolysaccharide-(LPS-) induced nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ) production with IC 50 values of 2.22 \u00b1 0.11 and 2.28 \u00b1 0.23 M, respectively. The effects of compound were associated with the suppression of LPS-induced expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein. Furthermore, compound negatively regulated the production of interleukin-(IL-) 1 and tumor-necrosis factor-(TNF-) at the transcriptional level in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. These antineuroinflammatory effects of compound were mediated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).",

Microglial cells are the primary resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and are associated with defensive mechanisms to maintain homeostasis against brain injury [2] . In steady state, microglia exert protective responses by regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. However, activated microglia produce excess immune reactions which are detrimental to brain tissue and can produce various proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-(TNF-) , interleukins (ILs), nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Released and accumulated, these proinflammatory mediators facilitate the development of neurodegenerative diseases [3, 4] . Therefore, it is important to suppress the secretion of proinflammatory mediators from activated microglial cells to prevent the neuroinflammation-related development of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Its dried roots and stem barks are famous traditional folk medicine for treating rheumatism, arthritis, paralysis, sinew, and bone pain [5] . Acanthopanax henryi (Oliv.) Harms, a Chinese endemic plant, has been used as a traditional remedy for the treatment of paralysis, arthritis, rheumatism, lameness, edema, injury from falls, hernia, and abdominal pain [6, 7] . Previous phytochemical studies 2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine on A. henryi led to the isolation and identification of more than 30 secondary metabolites, including five flavonoids, six caffeoylquinic acid derivatives [6] , sixteen triterpenoid saponins [8, 9] , one amide, one anthraquinone, one organic acid [9] , three lignans, one diterpene, one phenylpropanoid, and two phytosterols [10] . In addition, it has been reported that this plant exhibits diverse pharmacological activities due to the wide variety of chemical constituents. For example, metabolites of the leaves of A. henryi have strong antioxidant and antiacetyl cholinesterase activities [6] , and the 80% methanol fraction of root bark and ciwujianoside C3, which was isolated from leaves of this plant, have significant antiinflammatory effect in lipopolysaccharide-(LPS-) induced RAW264.7 macrophage cells [5, 11] . Moreover, some glycosides from the leaves of A. henryi have antiadipogenic effect, decreasing lipid accumulation through the inhibition of proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP ) in 3T3-L1 cells [12] . However, it has not been investigated yet whether this plant has antineuroinflammatory effects.",

Pretreatment with compound attenuated the LPS-induced production of IL-1 and TNF-, but it had little effect on IL-6 production (Figures 3(a)-3(c) ). Subsequently, to elucidate how compound inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production, the mRNA levels of the cytokines were examined. BV2 cells were pretreated with compound for 3 h and stimulated with LPS (1 g/mL) for 6 h. Consistent with the results obtained from the cytokine production data, pretreatment with compound reduced the LPS-induced mRNA levels of IL-1 and TNF-, but it did not affect to mRNA level of IL-6 ( Figures 3(d)-3(f) ). These results suggested that compound exhibits the antineuroinflammatory effects by negatively regulating the production of IL-1 and TNF-at the transcriptional level in LPS-challenged BV2 microglial cells.",

Our investigation showed that compound , isolated from A. henryi, suppressed NO and PGE 2 production in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells and also inhibited the LPS-induced expression of the iNOS and COX-2 protein (Figure 2) .

            "text": "MAPKs are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases, and they consist of three major subunits: p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). MAPKs are involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, stress responses, and immune responses [33] . In inflammatory responses, the activation of MAPKs leads to release of inflammatory-related factors, such as iNOS, COX-2, ILs, and TNF- [34] . Therefore, we further investigated whether the antineuroinflammatory effects of compound in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells were related to the inactivation of MAPKs. Our results showed that compound significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, but it did not affect the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK MAPKs. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) is one of the major transcription factors regulating inflammatory responses. When microglial cells are stimulated with ILs, TNF-, interferons, or LPS, NF-B can be activated following increased translocation of p65 and p50, which are subunits of the NF-B dimer, into the nucleus, as well as the phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (I B)-in the cytosol [35] . This response upregulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in microglial cells [1] . Therefore, NF-B can be an important target for the treatment of neuroinflammation-related neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, pretreatment with compound did not decrease the nuclear translocation of p65 and p50 or the phosphorylation and degradation of I B-(data not shown). Considering the effect of compound on the LPS-induced activation of NF-B and MAPK pathways, it is suggested that compound exerted antineuroinflammatory effects by specifically inactivating the p38 MAPK pathway.",
