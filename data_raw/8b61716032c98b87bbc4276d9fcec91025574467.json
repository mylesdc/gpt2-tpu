            "text": "Bats are increasingly implicated as hosts of highly pathogenic viruses. The underlying virus-host interactions and cellular mechanisms that promote co-existence remain ill-defined, but physiological traits such as flight and longevity are proposed to drive these adaptations. Autophagy is a cellular homeostatic process that regulates ageing, metabolism, and intrinsic immune defense. We quantified basal and stimulated autophagic responses in black flying fox cells, and demonstrated that although black flying fox cells are susceptible to Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) infection, viral replication is dampened in these bat cells. Black flying fox cells tolerated prolonged ABLV infection with less cell death relative to comparable human cells, suggesting post-entry mechanisms interference with virus replication. An elevated basal autophagic level was observed and autophagy was induced in response to high virus doses. Pharmacological stimulation of the autophagy pathway reduced virus replication, indicating autophagy acts as an anti-viral mechanism. Enhancement of basal and virus-induced autophagy in bat cells connects related reports that long-lived species possess homeostatic processes that dampen oxidative stress and macromolecule damage. Exemplifying the potential that evolved cellular homeostatic adaptations like autophagy may secondarily act as anti-viral mechanisms, enabling bats to serve as natural hosts to an assortment of pathogenic viruses. Furthermore, our data suggest autophagy-inducing drugs may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for combating lyssavirus infection. Viruses 2019, 11, 260 2 of 18 (EBOV) [9], and MARV [3,4,10], seroconverted, but did not develop pathology and only a minority of infected bats shed low level of virus in urine (NiV) [8] or high levels of virus orally (MARV) [4].",

            "text": "As bats are the only volant mammals, flight has been proposed to contribute to the ability of bats to function as natural reservoirs [11] [12] [13] . The aerobic demands of flight experienced by bats is higher than the aerobic demands of other terrestrial mammals experienced during aerobic exertion [14] . Positive selection of genes involved in DNA-damage repair pathways [11] and reduced free-radical production [15] in bats suggest an evolved response to the deleterious effects of an increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the high aerobic demands of flight. Cellular ageing occurs through a progressive accumulation of damaged organelles, misfolded and aggregated proteins, and dysregulation of cellular homeostatic processes [16, 17] . ROS can cause oxidative damage to macromolecules and DNA [18] , and ultimately contribute to cellular ageing. However, bats have a greater longevity [19] than what is typically projected in relation to their body size [20, 21] , and resistance to oxidative stress has been observed in long-lived bat species [22, 23] . Furthermore, the loss of DNA sensors in the PYHIN family [24] and decreased activity of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) [12] , may contribute to dampened inflammatory responses to the release of cytosolic DNA due to metabolic-related DNA damage or microbial infection [25] .",

At the crossroads of DNA-damage, oxidative stress, and microbial infection [27, 28] , autophagy, is a proteostatic process involved in cellular homeostasis, longevity, and survival [29, 30] . Canonically regarded as a response to starvation, the autophagy pathway recycles long-lived proteins, misfolded proteins, and damaged organelles during times of nutrient depletion. However, there are also multiple examples of selective autophagic pathways that utilize specific protein receptors to traffic ubiquitinated target organelles and proteins into cytoplasmic double-membraned vesicles, termed autophagosomes [31] . In addition to cellular stressors such as DNA damage and ROS, pathogen-recognition receptors can activate distinct autophagic processes as part of an intrinsic immune response [32] [33] [34] . For example, \"xenophagy\" shuttles intracellular microbes to autolysosomes for lysis, whereas \"aggrephagy\" removes toxic protein aggregates [35, 36] .",

Pteropus species are also the natural reservoirs of several zoonotic viruses including HeV, NiV [2], and Menangle virus [42, 43] . Cell lines have been established from the black flying fox [44] , which with the publication of its reference genome [11] , has been promoted as a model bat species. Black flying fox cell lines have been used to investigate the interferon response [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] , as well as transcriptomic and proteomic responses after HeV infection [51] . We rescued a modified recombinant ABLV expressing a green fluorescent protein (rABLV-GFP) and used both rABLV-GFP and a wild-type ABLV (wt-ABLV) to examine the role of autophagy after virus infection. In black flying fox cells, the basal level of autophagy was significantly higher than the levels of autophagy quantified in the human cell line used for comparative purposes. We observed that ABLV infection activated the autophagy pathway",

Bats experimentally infected with NiV and HeV [2, 7, 8] , Ebola virus in a dose-dependent manner, in both black flying fox-and human-derived cell lines, which we confirmed in primary black flying fox brain cells. Activation of autophagy through pharmacological methods decreased ABLV replication in both black flying fox and human cells, which suggested (1) that autophagy functions as an anti-viral defense during ABLV infection, and (2) that activation of autophagy might be an effective treatment against neurotropic viruses such as ABLV or related lyssaviruses. Lastly, we observed that in contrast to human cells, black flying fox brain-derived cells withstood a high dose of ABLV over a long incubation period and experienced significantly less cell death. Our findings provide an initial in vitro exploration for future studies that may illuminate the importance of autophagy as an enhanced post-transcriptional anti-viral pathway in bats.",

Autophagy functions as an anti-viral mechanism during vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection [55, 56] . VSV is a member of family Rhabdoviridae, which includes lyssaviruses such as rabies virus (RABV) and rabies virus-related viruses (e.g., ABLV). Wild-type RABV infection of a human neuroblastoma cell line was shown to activate the autophagy pathway [57] . A hallmark feature of autophagy induction is the cleavage and lipidation of the cytosolic microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3B-I) to autophagosomal-associated LC3B-phosphatidylethanolamine (LC3B-II). LC3B-II is incorporated into the developing autophagophore and retained in the autophagosome double membrane vesicle such that increased cellular levels of LC3B-II are used as a marker for the induction of autophagy [58] . Functional human and black flying fox LC3B proteins are identical in amino acid sequence after post-translational cleavage. Therefore, we compared quantities of LC3B-II between black flying fox and human cell lines by immunoblotting, following inhibition and stimulation of autophagy.",

PaBrH cells showed a significant percentage of LC3B-II conversion when infected with a MOI 10 at 24 and 48 hpi ( Figure 3C,D) . The NBF-L cells had a significant percentage of LC3B-II when infected for 48 hpi (MOI 1.0 and 10) ( Figure 3E ,F). We confirmed these results in primary black flying fox brain (PaBr) cells. A significant increase in LC3B-II was again dependent on a high virus dose, MOI 10 ( Figure 4A,B) . Additionally, treatment with BAFA1 increased LC3B-II, however the levels of LC3B-II remained statistically equivalent regardless of ABLV MOI. As there was not an additive effect of ABLV infection plus BAFA1 treatment, it is possible that the basal level of autophagic processes are so rapid that external stimulation (a) has little observable effect by comparison or (b) additional stimulation via ABLV infection increased autophagic flux such that autophagosome and LC3B-II turnover occurs more rapidly. These results suggested that although ABLV induced autophagy in both black flying fox and human cells, further enhancement of autophagic flux in black flying fox cells required a high virus dose. This observation highlights the need for additional studies of autophagic kinetics, both basal and induced, in black flying fox cells. Viruses 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 18 ",

We examined levels of p62 and NDP52 in PaBrH cells after ABLV infection, and in combination with BAFA1 treatment. Infection with ABLV alone resulted in less p62 ( Figure 5A ,B) and NDP52 ( Figure 5A ,C) detected in PaBrH cells at 48 hpi. In NBF-L cells, a mean fold decrease in p62 was observed at both 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 5D ,E).

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key modulator of autophagy [67] . We therefore tested the effects of both mTOR-dependent autophagy activation using the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (RAPA), as well as mTOR-independent autophagy activation with small molecule enhancer of autophagy-28 (SMER) stimulation [68, 69] . rABLV-GFP infected black flying fox cell lines, PaBrH and PaKiT, were treated with RAPA or SMER, respectively, during ABLV infection to elucidate whether activation of autophagy had anti-viral effects; human NBF-L cells were treated the same in comparison. RAPA and SMER activation of autophagy was monitored by CYTO-ID \u00ae (Enzo) staining of autophagosomes in PaKiT cells. Treatment with either RAPA or SMER induced autophagy in PaKiT cells, with RAPA showing a stronger effect ( Figure 6A ). Chloroquine (CHQ), an inhibitor of autophagic flux, was included as a positive control for autophagosome staining [60] . Treatment of black flying fox and human cells with RAPA after ABLV infection resulted in significant reductions in ABLV replication ( Figure 6B) . A significant reduction in ABLV titers after SMER treatment was only observed in human NBF-L cells, and a decreasing titer trend was observed in SMER treated black flying fox cells.",

Cell lysates collected after RAPA and SMER treatment of PaBrH and PaKiT cells, followed by analysis via western blot ( Figure 6C -F). Neither RAPA or SMER treatment had any significant effects on N or P protein levels in PaBr cells, however, N protein fold change had a decreasing trend in RAPA treated cells ( Figure 6C,D) . ABLV protein levels in bat PaKiT cells, infected and treated with RAPA and SMER, were examined by western blot (Figure 6E,F) . As seen in the PaBrH cells, N protein fold change had a decreasing trend in PaKiT cells when treated with RAPA, but not SMER. P protein levels were quantified for two independent experiments, and also had a trending decease in both RAPA-and SMER-treated cells. Although, western blot quantification of vGFP can be difficult because of low replication and vGFP expression levels in bat cells, we successfully quantified vGFP from two of the four independent experiments with PaKiT cells. The noticeable vGFP fold decrease caused by RAPA and SMER stands in contrast to fold changes in N and P proteins. Human NBF-L cells had a significant fold decrease of vGFP levels in both RAPA-or SMER-treated cells, but neither N nor P levels had any significant reductions ( Figure 6G,H) . These results indicated that autophagy acts as an anti-viral response in both black flying fox cells and human cells during ABLV infection. Given our limited on-hand reagents (e.g., ABLV N and P reactive antisera), we were only able assess the effects of autophagy activation on N and P protein levels. It is possible that other ABLV proteins such as M protein or L RNA polymerase, to which we lack reagents, are degraded by autophagy, and that degradation of these proteins leads to decreased ABLV replication as assessed by lower ABLV titers ( Figure 6B ) and ABLV vGFP expression ( Figure 6F,H) .

To examine the anti-viral effect of BEZ treatment on ABLV replication, NBF-L cells were infected with wt-ABLV for 24 h then treated with BEZ.

            "text": "Here, we focused on another well-conserved, intrinsic immune response and present a first experimental attempt to study the autophagy pathway during a virus infection in cell lines derived from a bat species. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that ABLV infection increased autophagosome generation and autophagy in black flying fox and human cells, and that autophagy activation in black flying fox cells was dependent on a high ABLV MOI. Yet, how ABLV RNA or proteins are sensed by host sensory machinery during ABLV replication remain unanswered. A related rhabdovirus, VSV, induces autophagy through G protein engagement independent of virus replication [56] and RABV M protein may also contribute to autophagy activation [57] . Autophagy has been implicated in either anti-and pro-viral processes for distinct viruses [33, 76] . For example, a protective role for autophagy was identified during VSV infection [55, 56] . In our study, pharmacological activation of autophagy decreased ABLV replication in both black flying fox and human cell lines, suggesting autophagy antagonizes lyssavirus infection.",

We found that the black flying fox brain cell line did not undergo significant cell death after what could be considered a pathogenic ABLV infection (MOI 10; 96 hpi). In contrast, ABLV induced substantial cell death in human neuroblastoma cells, similar to that observed previously with RABV infection [57] . Crosstalk and interplay between autophagic and apoptotic processes have long been recognized. Dependent on the environment or stimulation, autophagy can promote survival under stressful conditions (e.g., nutrient deprivation) or itself act as a mechanism of programmed cell death if left unchecked [78, 79] . Recently, we rescued a recombinant Cedar virus [80] , a non-pathogenic Henipavirus species also isolated from Pteropus species [81] . Such tools will facilitate opportunities to ask if autophagic response to ABLV can be generalized to other bat-borne viruses, and better define how the balance between autophagy and cell death is calibrated in bat cells.",

Epidemiology models suggest a possibility that latently infected individual bats contribute to episodic shedding and natural persistence of bat-borne viruses [84] . Although horizontal transmission within a population is still regarded as the primary source of transmission [85] , HeV and NiV recrudescence in Pteropus hosts have been reported [86] [87] [88] , yet the precise mechanism of latency or persistence is unclear. Autophagy functions as a pro-survival defense by removing toxic virus N protein aggregates during Sindbis virus infection, without having an effect on virus replication [89, 90] . Indeed, a pro-survival autophagic response that removes toxic protein aggregates and dampens virus replication might be critical for promoting viral persistence at the cellular level in natural hosts, maintaining the potential to shed virus with minimal disease presentation. More investigation is needed to translate in vitro bat immunity studies into a models of virus persistence and shedding within individuals and populations.",

Similarly, Brook and Dobson, 2015, postulated that autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria (i.e., mitophagy), a result of enhanced oxidative stress from the demands of flight, evolved a secondary anti-viral role for autophagy in bats [91] . New cell lines have recently been derived from additional bat species facilitating a greater comparative study across the bat taxa [92] . Furthermore, comparisons with rodent cell lines will strengthen whether in vitro intrinsic responses to virus infection are unique to bats or shared co-adaptations among other natural host species. Experimental challenges have limited our efforts to genetically silence or pharmacologically inhibit the autophagy pathways in black flying fox cells. Although we cannot yet definitively associate autophagy function with host tolerance to ABLV infection in black flying fox cells, ongoing experiments will refine our mechanistic understanding of enhanced basal autophagy and virus-induced autophagy in bat cells, and further characterize the pro-survival role of autophagy during virus infection.",

Nearly 10-fold higher titers were achieved in both human compared to black flying fox cell lines at 48 and 72 hpi. Quantification of GFP positive cells after rABLV-GFP infection revealed that nearly double the number of human cells were infected compared to black flying fox cell lines at 48 and 72 hpi (Figure 1C). Investigation of ABLV protein levels-including nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), and the virus-expressed GFP (vGFP) (Figure 1D)-revealed lower amounts of structural and non-structural ABLV proteins in black flying fox cells. GFP expression in black flying fox cells and human cells indicated that all four cell lines were susceptible to rABLV-GFP",
