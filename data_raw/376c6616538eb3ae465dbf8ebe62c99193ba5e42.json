There are currently very limited treatment options for SFTSV infection. We conducted a drug repurposing program by establishing a two-tier test system to rapidly screen a Food and Drug Administration-(FDA)-approved drug library for drug compounds with anti-SFTSV activity in vitro. We identified five drug compounds that inhibited SFTSV replication at low micromolar concentrations, including hexachlorophene, triclosan, regorafenib, eltrombopag, and broxyquinoline. Among them, hexachlorophene was the most potent with an IC 50 of 1.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M and a selectivity index of 18.7. Mechanistic studies suggested that hexachlorophene was a virus entry inhibitor, which impaired SFTSV entry into host cells by interfering with cell membrane fusion. Molecular docking analysis predicted that the binding of hexachlorophene with the hydrophobic pocket between domain I and domain III of the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein was highly stable. The novel antiviral activity and mechanism of hexachlorophene in this study would facilitate the use of hexachlorophene as a lead compound to develop more entry inhibitors with higher anti-SFTSV potency and lower toxicity.",

It was first identified in Huaiyangshan, a mountainous area in Huaiyang County in the Henan province of China [1] . Subsequently, the virus has also been isolated from infected humans, ticks, and mammals in Japan and South Korea. SFTSV is so named as it causes severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), an acute febrile illness characterized by high fever, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhagic complications in infected humans. Patients with SFTS may also develop other clinical manifestations such as systemic upset, coma, slurred speech, gastrointestinal upset, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy, as well as abnormal laboratory findings including leukopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, deranged liver function tests, proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated creatinine kinase and lactate dehydrogenate levels. The mortality rate of SFTS may be as high as 17% to 30% [1, 2] .",

Ribavirin exhibits some inhibitory effects on SFTSV replication in vitro and in a type I interferon receptor-deficient mouse model, but it was not found to be effective in a retrospective cohort of patients [2, 7] . Comparatively, favipiravir (T-705), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor with broad-spectrum antiviral activities, demonstrated higher in vitro and in vivo antiviral effects against SFTSV. However, favipiravir is not clinically approved or readily available in many countries affected by SFTSV, including China. To identify drug compounds that can be used to treat patients or reduce the transmission of SFTSV, especially in the hospital setting, we conducted a drug repurposing program by screening a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library consisting of 1528 drug compounds. We first established a robust two-tier (ELISA followed by viral load reduction assay) screening platform for SFTSV. Using this drug screening platform, we identified five drug compounds with anti-SFTSV activity in vitro, and characterized the anti-SFTSV mechanism of the most potent drug, hexachlorophene, as an entry inhibitor of SFTSV.",

The cell viability, SFTSV-NP protein expression, and the S-segment viral genome copy number in the culture supernatant were monitored at 1, 3, and 5 dpi, respectively. Favipiravir was used as a positive control in all three assays [7] . As shown in Figure 1a , differences of cell viability between the favipiravir-treated and the DMSO-treated groups were less than 20%, indicating that the CPE inhibition assay was not a sensitive assay for drug screening when favipiravir was used as a positive control. Next, the culture supernatants were subjected to ELISA and qRT-PCR analyses. As shown in Figure 1b , >10-fold and >15-fold read-outs between the favipiravir-treated and the DMSO-treated groups were detected with 0.01 MOI at 3 dpi and 5 dpi, respectively, by ELISA. In the viral load reduction assay, there was approximately 4-log 10 difference in SFTSV RNA load between the two groups at the 3 dpi and 5 dpi ( Figure 1c ). These data suggested that both the ELISA and the viral load reduction assay were sensitive drug screening assays for SFTSV. Considering the cost-effectiveness of the two assays and the need to balance between maximum drug efficacy and drug half-life (t 1/2 ), drug compound library screening was then performed using ELISA with 0.01 MOI of SFTSV as virus inoculum and the culture supernatant being collected at 3 dpi.

This event is induced by surface expression of viral fusion proteins that are fusogenic directly at the host cell membrane. Only viruses that are able to directly fuse at the cellular surface without the need of endocytosis induce syncytium formation. Syncytium formation of SFTSV-infected cells can be triggered by low pH buffer [19] . Since hexachlorophene interfered with SFTSV entry without inhibiting viral attachment to host cells or inactivating the virions (Figure 4) , we therefore asked if hexachlorophene inhibited SFTSV membrane fusion. To this end, we first treated SFTSV-infected cells in citrate-phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 5.0. Then, the cells were treated with hexachlorophene (5.0 \u00b5M, 2.5 \u00b5M, or 0 \u00b5M) (Figure 5a ). As shown in Figure 5b , syncytium formation in SFTSV-infected cells was dramatically inhibited by hexachlorophene in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that SFTSV-induced cell fusion was impaired. After 2 h, the infectious inoculum was removed, cells were washed, and the intra-cellular viral RNA load was determined by qRT-PCR. (c) SFTSV inactivation assay. SFTSV was incubated with 10 \u00b5M hexachlorophene for 2 h, followed by standard plaque assay from diluting the mixture for 1000 fold (i.e., the remaining concentration of hexachlorophene was below its IC 50 ). All experiments were performed in triplicates. Data are presented as mean values \u00b1 standard deviations. P value was calculated by Student's t-test (compared with the DMSO group).",

We showed that hexachlorophene potently inhibited SFTSV replication, as evidenced by significant (>2-log 10 ) reduction of viral RNA load and 100% plaque reduction at a drug concentration of 10 \u00b5M, which was below its CC 50 . The IC 50 of hexachlorophene against SFTSV (1.3-2.6 \u00b5M) was lower than that the other anti-SFTSV drug compounds reported thus far (caffeic acid, 180 \u00b5M; ribavirin, 40.1 \u00b5M; favipiravir, 25.0 \u00b5M; amodiaquine, 19.1 \u00b5M; and 2 -fluoro-2 -deoxycytidine, 3.7 \u00b5M) [38] [39] [40] . Using a combination of virus entry, attachment, inactivation, and membrane fusion assays, we showed that hexachlorophene interfered with virus entry and virus-induced cell fusion without affecting virus attachment to host cells or inactivating the virions. Molecular docking predicted that hexachlorophene bound stably with the deep hydrophobic pocket between domain I and domain III of the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein, providing insights into the structural interactions between hexachlorophene and SFTSV that explain the drug's in vitro antiviral activity.",

First, we showed that our two-tier drug screening platform is a robust system that can be utilized to identify anti-SFTSV drug compounds rapidly. This system could be used to screen larger chemical libraries containing more drug compounds to find additional treatment options for SFTSV. Second, the novel antiviral activity and mechanism of hexachlorophene in this study would facilitate the use of hexachlorophene as a lead compound to developing more entry inhibitors with higher anti-SFTSV potency and lower toxicity. The antiviral activity and mechanism of the other identified hit compounds by our two-tier screening system should be further characterized in future studies. Finally, the use of hexachlorophene as a disinfectant should be considered to reduce the risk of nosocomial outbreaks of SFTSV associated with contaminated environmental surfaces.
