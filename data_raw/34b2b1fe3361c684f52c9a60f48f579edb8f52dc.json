Infection might lead to hemorrhage, while a recent study showed an increased risk of myocardial infarction during or shortly after PUUV infection. The mechanism by which this hantavirus influences the coagulation system remains unknown. Therefore we aimed to elucidate mechanisms explaining alterations seen in primary and secondary hemostasis during PUUV infection. By using low passage PUUV isolates to infect primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) we were able to show alterations in the regulation of primary-and secondary hemostasis and in the release of fibrinolysis regulators. Our main finding was an activation of secondary hemostasis due to increased tissue factor (TF) expression leading to increased thrombin generation in a functional assay. Furthermore, we showed that during infection platelets adhered to HUVEC and subsequently specifically to PUUV virus particles. Infection of HUVEC with PUUV did not result in increased von Willebrand factor while they produced more plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) compared to controls. The PAI-1 produced in this model formed complexes with vitronectin. This is the first report that reveals a potential mechanism behind the pro-coagulant changes in PUUV patients, which could be the result of increased thrombin generation due to an increased TF expression on endothelial cells during infection. Furthermore, we provide insight into the contribution of endothelial cell responses regarding hemostasis in PUUV pathogenesis.",

Hantaviruses are rodent-borne, negative stranded, RNA viruses belonging to the Bunyaviridae family, which may cause two types of disease in humans (Goeijenbier et al., 2013) . In Europe and Asia, hantavirus infection causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), characterized by renal failure and bleeding complications. In North and South America, hantavirus infection causes the hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) where patients present with severe acute respiratory distress (Sargianou et al., 2012) . Changing ecological factors determine fluctuations in hantavirus epidemiology resulting in sudden increases in incidence, for instance through increased food availability, prolonged virus survival and decreased biodiversity (Reusken and Heyman, 2013) . Recent epidemiological studies reported an overall incidence increase of PUUV infections in Europe (Heyman and Vaheri, 2008) .",

            "text": "Although PUUV infections have a low case fatality rate (<1%) and in literature the virus is often described as the least virulent of the pathogenic viruses within the hantavirus genus, PUUV infections can cause severe disease in healthy adults, which may require a long recovery period lasting up to 1 year (Schmaljohn and Hjelle, 1997) . Furthermore, several reports described cases with severe (hemorrhagic) complications like pituitary gland hemorrhage, hematemesis and gastro-intestinal bleedings (Eckerle et al., 2012; Antonen et al., 2013) . In contrast to these bleeding complications, a recent study from Sweden reported increased risk for acute myocardial infarction shortly after PUUV infection (Connolly-Andersen et al., 2014) . Given the high incidence in Northern Europe, acute myocardial infarction as a complication of PUUV infection could have a major impact in endemic areas. In light of both bleeding and thrombotic events that might complicate PUUV infections, we hypothesized that endothelial cells, also the target cells for hantaviruses and the major regulators of coagulation and inflammation, play a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease (Zhou et al., 2003) .",

Subsequently, cells were washed five times with PBS and the bound platelets were quantified by using a platelet detection antibody (anti-CD41a 1:500 in dilution buffer) followed by a conjugate substrate reaction. CD41a expression was calculated by subtraction of the OD measured in the wells without platelet incubations (blanco) to correct for direct (a-specific) anti-CD41a antibody binding to PUUV and anti-CD3 was used as isotype control. Subsequently, ELISA plates were coated with mouse monoclonal anti-PUUV glycoprotein-or isotype control antibody (IgG2 corona virus; 1:500 in PBS at 4 \u2022 C overnight) followed by incubation with PUUV to capture the virus followed by platelet incubation, detection antibody and conjugate substrate reaction. Thirdly, to further confirm platelet PUUV binding, ELISA plates were coated with an anti-platelet antibody (1:500 in PBS at 4 \u2022 C overnight), followed by incubation with fresh isolated platelets and eventually an incubation step with PUUV or VSV followed by a hantavirus detection antibody (mouse mAB anti-PUUV-glycoprotein 1:500).

As a final step we studied the potential blocking of platelet binding by PUUV particles by the addition of a blocking step with polyclonal human anti PUUV serum.

The viral copy numbers in the supernatant or cell lysate of HUVEC incubated with BPL inactivated virus served as a control for nonreplicating virus. Consistently, the RNA copy numbers did not increase over time indicating the efficient inactivation of the virus by BPL treatment. Efficient inactivation was confirmed by negative IPOX staining of the HUVEC incubated with BPL inactivated PUUV (data not shown). Gavrilovskaya et al. (2010) reported the potential of Hantaan and Andes virus to bind quiescent platelets via \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin. Since this observation is of much importance in further understanding the alterations in primary hemostasis and its role in disease mechanisms in HFRS we decided to confirm this mechanism for PUUV using a different approach. First we assessed the ability of quiescent platelets to bind to PUUV infected HUVEC (Figure 2) . Binding of platelets was determined by measuring the intensity of CD41a (platelet glycoprotein IIb), a heterodimeric integral membrane protein present only on platelets and megakaryocytes. CD41a expression was significantly higher on the HUVEC monolayer after infection with a MOI of 0.5, or 3 compared to the control. Detection of CD41a expression did not differ when platelets were not added to the HUVEC monolayers, suggesting that there was no non-specific anti-CD41a binding to infected cells. Furthermore there was no difference in OD values when an isotype control (anti-CD3) was used to detect platelets. Based on CD41a expression, statistically significant differences were measured between infected wells and wells incubated with virus free VeroE6 medium (negative control) at 24 h post infection (one way ANOVA, MOI 3 vs. NEG p < 0.01, MOI 0.5 vs. Neg p < 0.05). After 48 h of infection this difference in CD41a expression was also significant between MOI 3 infected wells and the BPL inactivated virus control (one way ANOVA, MOI 3 vs. NEG p < 0.001 and MOI 3 vs. BPL p < 0.001; MOI 0.5 vs. NEG p < 0.05). Taken together, the data indicate that platelets bind to cultures incubated with PUUV. HUVEC incubated with BPL did show a trend to increased platelet CD41a expression (Figure 2) , but this was not statistically significant.",

By this approach we showed that TF expression was significantly increased with an almost twofold increase in OD value 48 h post infection (Figure 4A , Mann-Whitney U; p = 0.0047). Cells infected with PUUV also showed an increased TF concentration when the cell lysates of PUUV infected wells were compared to the lysates of control wells (Figure 4B ; both mock and BPL). Subsequently we wanted to prove that the increase in TF expression on the endothelial cell surface was of biological significance and would led to increased thrombin generation. Thrombin generation was quantified directly on infected endothelial cells by incubating normal plasma on cells and initiating coagulation by the addition of calcium ions. Infected cells induced plasma clotting faster due to increased thrombin generation (Figures 4C,D) . Using a calibration curve with purified TF in the absence of endothelial cells, we quantified HUVEC TF production after virus infection and after incubation with a virus free medium control.

For instance vitronectin, a stabilizer of PAI-1 activity in plasma, is largely regulated by this receptor (Mackow and Gavrilovskaya, 2009; Florova et al., 2013) . To study potential changes in regulators of fibrinolysis we first measured PAI-1 levels in the cell-free supernatant and supernatant of cell lysate from 24-well plates infected with PUUV or control infections. The total PAI-1 antigen (the combination of levels in the supernatant and cell lysate) was significantly increased 48 h post infection (Kruskal-Wallis; p < 0.05) with MOI 3 ( Figure 5A ). Subsequently, we tested if in our model PAI-1 would bind to vitronectin, since this binding is associated with increased/prolonged PAI-1 activity (Seiffert and Loskutoff, 1991) , and if this interaction is altered during infection. ELISA plates coated with a monoclonal antibody against vitronectin, incubated with supernatant from our experiments (pooled, control or from MOI 3 infected wells) followed by incubation with PAI-1 antibody suggested formation of PAI-1 vitronectin complexes due to an increase in OD compared to incubation with PBS (mean expression in medium 490 mOD (\u00b1100) vs. 370 mOD (\u00b170) p = 0.02). If supernatants were tested separately (PUUV vs. mock) levels of PAI-1 vitronectin complexes were increased after PUUV infection (Mann-Whitney U; p = 0.03; Figure 5B ).",

With the lack of a valid and accessible animal model for old-world hantavirus infection, we remain dependent on ex vivo cell culture models to address questions regarding virulence and pathogenesis (Vaheri et al., 2013b) . Taking into account the recently found association of PUUV infection with cardiovascular disease (Connolly-Andersen et al., 2014) and hemorrhagic complications that may occur during infection, the interaction between PUUV and the coagulation system especially warrants further attention. Since PUUV tends to rapidly lose virulence upon in vitro cell passages the use of low passaged isolates is of vital importance (Nemirov et al., 2003) . Therefore, we have put a lot of emphasis on obtaining low passage PUUV isolates and optimisation of the hemostatic assays under the right biosafety regulations using primary cell cultures.",

            "text": "Based on hemostatic changes seen in several clinical studies, most from Northern Europe, we decided to study specific parts of the coagulation system in vitro. We started by studying the effects of PUUV infection on formation of a platelet plug, the major event in primary hemostasis. Binding of platelets by PUUV infected cells could explain thrombocytopenia in acute PUUV patients, since it would result in wasting or loss of platelets adhered to these cells (Gavrilovskaya et al., 2010; Laine et al., 2011) . Especially if we make notice of the ability of hantaviruses to infect megakaryocytes and thereby lead to a decreased production of platelets, in addition to the loss of platelets adhered to infected cells (Liang et al., 2004; Lutteke et al., 2010) . In our model it seems that PUUV infection increases binding of platelets to the surface of HUVEC compared to control cells (Figure 2) . Here we assumed increased CD41a expression observed in the first experiments was the result of an increased number of platelets on the HUVEC. Theoretically, increased CD41a detection could also be due to an increased expression of CD41a on platelets, after 30 min incubation with infected HUVEC, rather than an actual increase in platelet numbers. While we cannot rule this out based on our experiments, we blocked extrinsic platelet activation by prostaglandin treatment making platelet activation less likely. Furthermore, in line with studies performed with more pathogenic hantaviruses (Gavrilovskaya et al., 2010) , we tested specific binding of platelets to PUUV particles. Judged from results from the platelet pull down experiments (Figure 3 ) this seemed to be a specific binding between virus and platelets which could be reversed by the addition of PUUV neutralizing antibodies. In these experiments we controlled for aspecific binding of antibodies (isotype control experiments), factors present in the virus culture medium (5 days old VeroE6 medium as a control) and binding of platelet detection antibody directly to PUUV.",

However, the observation that VWF concentration does not change during PUUV infection, further suggested a VWF-independent mechanism for platelet binding in HFRS. Results from earlier studies showed an increased VWF concentration in hospitalized PUUV patients (Laine et al., 2011) . One should keep in mind that overall plasma VWF level in any patient represents the state of the total endothelial cell layer and not only that of infected cells, as is the case in our model. Furthermore we are studying the acute response of endothelial cells in the first 48 h after infection, a time point at which PUUV patients are generally not considered to be hospitalized and tested. The increase of VWF in all three conditions (control, BPL and PUUV) over time in our HUVEC model could be the result of an increased number of cells or a sign of in vitro stress and activation of the endothelial cells. Since it seems highly unlikely the cells still multiply after the formation of a full monolayer, which is present at the time of infection, we believe that also non-infected cells show a certain level of activation when in culture. Gavrilovskaya et al. (2010) were the first to study the interaction of hantaviruses (Andes and Hantaan) with platelets, and concluded that there was a specific binding of Hantaan and Andes virus particle particles to \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrins present on both endothelial cells and platelets. Interestingly, our experiment showed a trend to increased number of platelets bound to the BPL-inactivated virus treated cultures, suggesting active replication was unnecessary and inactivated virus, bound to the cell surface, might also bind to integrins present on platelets. However, this hypothesis is merely based on a statistical trend observed in wells with the cells incubated with BPL inactivated virus. For the interpretation of our data one should take in mind that we made use of a MOI 3 BPL at t = 0 h and that the BPL inactivated virus will not replicate. Therefore at timepoint t = 24 and t = 48 the BPL control will most likely be comparable to the MOI 0.5 infection. It could very well be the case that when increasing the MOI for the BPL infection a more comparable result to the MOI 3 infection would be observed.",

This resulted in drastic activation of secondary hemostasis in our cell model during PUUV infection. Data from a direct clotting assay on the cell monolayer gives interesting insights in the potential mechanism behind increased thrombin generation seen in acute PUUV patients (Laine et al., 2010 (Laine et al., , 2014 . A clear pro-coagulant state, the result of an increased expression of TF on the surface of PUUV infected cells, resulted in enhanced thrombin generation. Increased thrombin generation (decreased thrombin time, overall increase in prothrombin fragments 1 + 2, antithrombin and protein C) that Laine et al. (2010 Laine et al. ( , 2014 observed in acute PUUV patients could very well be the result of direct infection of endothelial cells and concomitant increased production of TF. Whether increase in TF is a general defense response or if the virus actually benefits from TF, as is seen in certain herpesvirus infections (Pryzdial et al., 2014) , remains unknown. However, excess of TF production during infection could lead to increased clotting and eventually consumptive coagulopathy or even DIC, a severe condition that is only seen in a small percentage of PUUV patients (Laine et al., 2010) , but which could be one of the factors contributing to the hemorrhagic complications seen in HFRS. Especially since increased TF expression has been proven to play an important role in the pathogenesis of other viral hemorrhagic fevers like Marburg and Ebola (Geisbert et al., 2003a,b) .",

Increased \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 expression during PUUV infection combined with competitive binding of hantavirus with vitronectin for \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 could hypothetically lead to further alterations in PAI-1 half-life and stability. The increased level of vitronectin-PAI-1 complexes in the supernatant of PUUV infected cells further strengthens this hypothesis. Considering that an increase in PAI-1 and vitronectin could result in renal impairment, and even cause a nephritis-like response, pledges for further evaluation of interaction between \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 integrin, PAI-1, vitronectin and hantaviruses.",

Mock infected cells (A,B) showed no red peroxidase staining for PUUV nucleoprotein after 24 (A) and 48 (B) hours. Twenty-four hours after infection with MOI 0.5 (C) a small number of cells stained positive, which, increased at 48 h (D). Infection with MOI 3 resulted in more infected cells after 24 h (E), which increased slightly at 48 h post infection (F). Analysis of viral replication showed a more than 2-log increase of viral copy numbers in both supernatant (G) and cell lysates (H), suggesting active viral replication. Bars represent SE of the mean. BPL inactivation of the virus lead to no increase in viral copy numbers in the supernatant and a negative IPOX staining (data not shown). Furthermore infection was confirmed by western blot for the presence of the PUUV nucleoprotein in the cell lysate and Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) to confirm the character of the endothelial cells (I). The first four lanes show control wells with only one band present at the upper side of the blot (VWF). The last for lanes show the presence of both VWF and the PUUV nucleoprotein (\u223c55 kDa 10ug/lane). Data are representative of three independent experiments.",
