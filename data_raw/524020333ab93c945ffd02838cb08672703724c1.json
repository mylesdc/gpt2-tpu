The addition of an eight amino acid HIV-1 gp41 envelope incorporation motif further increased scFvFc expression on human cells and incorporation into lentiviral particles. Both antibody-displaying human cells and virus particles bound antigen specifically. Sulfation of CDR tyrosine residues, a property recently shown to broaden antibody binding affinity and antigen recognition was also demonstrated. High level scFvFc expression and stable integration was achieved in human cells following transduction with IRES containing bicistronic SIN lentivectors encoding ZsGreen when scFvFc fusion proteins were expressed from the first cassette. Up to 10 6 -fold enrichment of antibody expressing cells was achieved with one round of antigen coupled magnetic bead pre-selection followed by FACS sorting. Finally, the scFvFc displaying human cells could be used directly in functional biological screens with remarkable sensitivity.",

This shift, toward de novo human mAb isolation and their clinical use, is in part due to new antibody display and other library screening techniques, which are now being exploited to isolate human antibodies with high affinity and specificity. The microbial surface display technologies for screening antibody libraries include phage, yeast and bacteria. Phage-display is widely used due to its simplicity, versatility and ability to be adapted to many specific conditions, including selection on whole cells and tissues [8] . Yeast and bacteria display platforms have several advantages over the phage system including use of flow-cytometry and sorting techniques to enable finer affinity discrimination of selected antibodies [9, 10] . Among the non-microbial systems is ribosomal display that has the capacity to screen libraries of greater size as well as facilitating diversity and efficient antibody maturation in vitro.",

This has been particularly true for antibodies isolated by phage-display technology. There has been great interest in screening antibodies directly from mammalian cells due to their ability to provide proper posttranslational modification, as well as the existence of the natural chaperones that assist in antibody folding. Animal cells have been used for the direct screening of hypermutating antibodies [11, 12] and during antibody selection from a retroviral-antibody display library [13] . Transient antibody expression on the surface of human 293T has also been recently reported as a system to perform in vitro affinity maturation of human antibodies [14] . Furthermore, sulfation of tyrosine residues in the CDR residues of human antibodies can markedly affect antigen recognition [15, 16] and contribute bidirectionally to the binding activity of antibodies [17] . These latter findings suggest that antibody selection and expression on the surface of human cells may not only identify a population of antibodies that would be difficult or even impossible to detect in other microbial or cell-free display systems, which lack the ability to sulfonate CDR tyrosines, but may also be able to select against antibodies that may otherwise loose activity upon transferring to mammalian expression systems.",

To gain bivalency and increase the sensitivity of detecting antigens bound to surface antibody, the PS11 scFv was expressed as an scFvFc fusion protein [18] [19] [20] . For anchoring to the cell membrane, PS11 scFvFc protein was fused, in frame, to a transmembrane (TM) moiety. TM domains of HIV-1 gp41, CD8 and CD28 were tested for maximal surface expression of the scFvFc. As shown in Figure 1 , all anchoring moieties consist of a short extracellular region, an entire TM domain and a cytoplasmic tail. Eight residues of the most membrane-proximal HIV-1 gp41 cytoplasmic tail, previously shown to provide a putative ''envelope (env) incorporation motif'' [21] , were also tested for their ability to promote efficient pseudotyping of the scFvFc fusion proteins onto HIV virions or subsequently the cell surface, as a direct fusion to the gp41 TM or attached to the carboxy terminus of the CD8 or CD28 cytoplasmic tails.",

In the case of HIV-gp41, the last 19 residues of the extracellular region (solid blue) are followed by a TM spanner (22 residues; blue horizontal stripes) and a cytoplasmic tail (blue vertical stripes). Either the full length 151 residues of the cytoplasmic domain or a truncated region that includes only the first eight residues of the cytoplasmic tail were used. Numbering is according to p160 of HIV-1 HXB2. For CD8, the most membrane-proximal 12 residues of the extracellular domain (solid green) and 11 residues of the cytoplasmic domain (green vertical stripes) flank 21 residues of the TM region (horizontal green stripes). For CD28, an extracellular region consisting of 40 residues (solid purple) and a cytoplasmic region of 13 residues (purple vertical stripes) flank the 27-residue TM domain (horizontal purple stripes). To facilitate scFvFc-TM incorporation into virions, an eight-residue ''env incorporation motif'', which encodes the membrane proximal part of the gp41 cytoplasmic tail (NRVRQGYS; single blue line-amino acids 706-713), was attached to the carboxy-terminal ends of the cytoplasmic domains of CD8 and CD28. A nine amino acid C9 tag (red box) is positioned at Cterminus of all Fc domains to facilitate detection/quantitation of scFvFc expression on the cell surface. The gene cassette was cloned into pCDNA3.1 or the modified pHAGE lentiviral vector between Sfi-I and Pac-I sites. A CMV promoter controls expression of the scFvFc-TM transgenes. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0003181.g001 Figure 2 . Optimization of scFvFc cell-surface expression using different transmembrane domains. 293T cells were transfected with the pcDNA 3.1 based constructs encoding PS11-scFvFc antibodies of different configurations as described in Figure 1 and labeled under each lane in Panels a and b. pcDNA3.1-CMV-GFP was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. At 48 hours post transfection, cells were harvested and analyzed for GFP and scFv-Fc expression by FACS analysis. Panels a and b, represent results from FACS analysis of the percentage of transmembrane moiety, differences in cell-surface expression of PS11-scFvFc were observed in both the percentage of cells that were positive for scFvFc expression (Panel a), and more pronounced by their respective MFI values (Panel b). The data indicate that PS11-scFvFc antibodies anchored by the TM of CD8 (lanes 6 and 7) or CD28 (lanes 8 and 9) were highly expressed on the surface of mammalian cells, compared to PS11-scFvFc fused to HIV-gp41 TM (either a long or short cytoplasmic tails; lanes 4 and 5) that were poorly surface expressed, and their MFI values were low.",

As shown in Figure 2c , cells expressing PS11-scFvFc-gp41 (665-856) demonstrated punctate staining with large aggregates and exhibited an overall low level of cell-surface expression (image b). In contrast, PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 (706-713) proteins were evenly distributed on the cell surface and also had a reticular staining pattern, consistent with efficient ER folding and expression (image c). As a control, rhodamine conjugated antihuman Fc staining was not detected on cells transfected with ZsGreen encoding vector alone (image a). These results are consistent with the FACS data shown in Figure 2a and 2b. Low expression and possible aggregation of PS11-scFvFc-gp41 (665-856) may be a result of poor folding, as the natural Fc moiety forms dimers, while gp41 forms trimers through its TM. Finally, radio-immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the membrane bound PS11-scFv-CD28-gp41 (706-713) protein was dimeric ( Figure 2d ).",

As seen in Figure 3 , all PS11-scFvFc-TM proteins were functional for binding the biotinylated TRM peptide. The binding was specific, since an irrelevant X48-scFvFc, recognizing a biotinylated CXCR4 peptide [17] , showed only a relatively low level of APC-streptavidin staining (lane 4). Overall, the PS11-scFvFc-CD8-gp41 and PS11-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 proteins were the most competent in binding the peptide and exhibited higher levels of peptide binding compared to the corresponding constructs without the envelope incorporation motifs (Figure 3b , compare lanes 8 and 10 to lanes 7 and 9, respectively). This result suggests that this motif may stabilize surface antibody expression, by promoting its proper folding and membrane association. The lower surface expression of PS11-scFvFc linked to the gp41 TM region (Figure 2a Tyrosine sulfation of the mammalian cell-surface expressed scFvFc-CD28-gp41 antibodies We have demonstrated that in self-reactive human anti-CXCR4 antibodies, tyrosine sulfation occurs in novel areas of the V-region genes and contributes bidirectionally to antibody binding activity [17] . To determine if tyrosine sulfation could also occur on surface displayed scFvFc, the self-reactive human anti-CXCR4 antibodies X20-and X48-scFv were analyzed as scFvFc-CD28-gp41 (706-713) fusion proteins. Radioimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed that sulfation indeed occurred in the surface displayed X20-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 but not with X48-scFvFc-CD28-gp41 ( Figure 3c , compare lower lanes 3 and 2, respectively). Treatment of transfected cells with sodium-chlorate, a sulfation inhibitor [15, 22] , decreased expression but more significantly abolished sulfation of scFvFc proteins ( Figure 3c lower and upper panels, respectively). This is consistent with the results for each corresponding soluble scFv, where sulfation was mapped to tyrosine in VH CDR2 and VL FW3 regions of X20 and required for maximal binding and antigen recognition activity [17] .",

Viral particles were attached to Hela cells for 2 hour at 4uC. Cells were then fixed and stained with anti-HIV p24 antibody followed by Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or a rhodamine-conjugated anti-human Fc for surface Fc staining. Following these procedures, cells were washed and analyzed by confocal microscope. Shown separately are viruses stained for detection of p24 (image a) and scFvFc (image b) along with a merged image (image c). Panel c. Antigen specific capture of lentiviruses displaying corresponding scFvFc antibodies. Equal amounts of lentivirus particles expressing on their surface either the PS11-scFvFc or the 11A-scFvFc were loaded on a 96-well plate that was coated with the following specific antigens: TRM-peptide (PS11 specific), GD03-Fc (11A specific) or BSA. Following incubation to allow capture of the viruses to the antigens, wells were washed extensively and viral particles were eluted and quantitated by RT assay. Presented are normalized RT counts, where RT counts of particles bound to their antigens were divided by the RT counts of virus bound to the BSA control. Values are the average of duplicated samples and data are representative of two separate experiments. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0003181.g004 and the sensitivity of the isolation and enrichment process was evaluated. Our initial results indicated that, at one-week post-viral transduction, a single round of selection by direct FACS sorting of high antigen binding/ZsGreen expressing cells, resulted in a three log enrichment of antigen specific 11A-scFvFc surface displayed cells, from a background cell population. However, isolation of 11A-scFvFc expressing cells could not be reliably achieved at a mixing ratio below 1:1000 (data not shown). We hence modified the selection procedure in order to improve sensitivity for specific antibody detection. Lentivirus transduced cells were pre-sorted for ZsGreen expression soon after transduction. Upon further propagation, 11A-and PS11-scFvFc cells were mixed at different ratios; incubated with a fixed concentration of biotin-GD03-Fc protein and streptavidin-APC; and an enrichment step, using MACS-anti-APC microbeads (Miltenyi), was performed prior to FACS analysis and sorting of streptavidin-APC positive cells. FACS analysis showed that the enrichment procedure was highly efficient at cell mixing ratio of 1:10 6 , reaching at least 45-fold (compare Figure 6a R2 gates of left and middle panels; note 0.1% cells within R2 gate are nondistinguishable from a background value). Following magnetic bead enrichment, high (R2 gate) and low (R3 gate) APC-stained and ZsGreen expressing cells were again sorted and the two cell populations (about 500-1000 cells) were propagated for one week. A portion of cells was further propagated to reach a sufficient number for re-staining with biotinylated GD03-Fc protein and APC-conjugated streptavidin, while scFv genes from the remaining cells were rescued by PCR amplification of genomic DNA for rapid recloning and scFv DNA sequence analysis. As shown in Figure 6a (right panel), upon propagation and re-staining, the majority of originally high APC staining cells were positive for GD03-Fc binding (81% within the R2 gate), while cells isolated from R3-gate expressed low levels of ZsGreen and human Fc staining, but did not bind to biotin-GDO3-Fc (data not shown). DNA analysis confirmed that 51/56 of the clones generated from the R2-gated cells were positive for the 11A scFvFc gene (Figure 6b ). In contrast, 40/45 clones from the R3-gated cells encoded the PS11 scFvFc gene and only 2/45 clones expressed the 11A scFvFc. Overall, magnetic beads enrichment combined with FACS sorting of high antigen binding/ZsGreen expressing cells resulted in a 10 6 fold-enrichment of antigen binding cells in a tandem two-step round of selection.",

Together with optimized scFv PCR rescue and re-expression, this system should allow the development of rapid, iterative antibody enrichment procedures. Indeed, in the scFv gene PCR rescue experiment described in Figure 6b , only one week of cell propagation was used and shorter times are clearly possible. It should be noted that two cell populations were commonly detected as low (R3 gate) and high (R2 gate) ZsGreen expression and GD03-Fc antigen binding. This occurred despite optimized amounts of biotinylated GD03-Fc protein that were used to limit APC-streptavidin cross-reactive staining of irrelevant PS11 scFvFc transduced cells (Figure 5b ). Sequencing analysis confirmed that the majority of the R3-gated cells expressed the irrelevant PS11 scFvFc, while the vast majority of the R2-gated cells encoded 11A scFvFc (Figure 6b ). Thus, careful consideration of the background threshold for each antigen, and sorting for only high antigen binding and ZsGreen expressing cells, are useful guidelines to maximize the recovery of antigen binding positive cells. In addition, the positive signal to noise MFI ratio could potentially be increased through adjusting levels of biotin conjugation to an antigen probe or through an extra biotin/avidin amplification step. Initial MOI for transductions should also be controlled to ensure both library diversity and antibody expression.",

Cells were incubated with biotinylated GD03-Fc, a specific antigen for 11A-scFvFc, and stained for streptavidin-APC as described in Methods, and then analyzed by FACS. Note that two clusters of cells in Panel c represent high (R2 gated) and low (R3 gated) levels of 11A-scFvFc on their surface as measured by APC staining. These could reflect variations in cell-surface expression levels resulting from multiple integration events of the scFvFc cassette following transduction, or the difference in transgene integration site, i.e., its proximity to active transcriptional units.
