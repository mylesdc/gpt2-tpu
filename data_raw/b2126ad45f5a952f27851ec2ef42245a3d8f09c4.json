However, our understanding of its function regarding virus and host interaction is still limited. In this study, we employed immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to screen for cellular interacting partners of ORF3. Gene ontology analysis of the host interactome highlighted the involvement of ORF3 in endosomal and immune signaling pathways. Among the identified ORF3-interacting proteins, the vacuolar protein-sorting-associated protein 36 (VPS36) was assessed for its role in PEDV replication. VPS36 was found to interact with ORF3 regardless of its GLUE domain. As a result of VPS36-ORF3 interaction, PEDV replication was substantially suppressed in cells overexpressing VPS36. Interestingly, the ORF3 protein expression was diminished in VPS36-overexpressing cells, an effect that could not be restored by treatment of lysosomal inhibitors. In addition, disruption of endogenously-expressed VPS36 by siRNA could partially augment PEDV replication. Taken together, our study provides mechanistic insights into the contribution of ORF3 in PEDV replication.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is one of the major enteric pathogens currently threatening the swine population worldwide. Infection of PEDV, especially in neonatal piglets, leads to severe watery diarrhea, dehydration, and death, resulting in tremendous economic losses [1, 2] . PEDV belongs to the Alphacoronavirus genus in the Coronaviridae family. Its genome is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA encoding for viral replicase polyprotein (pp) la and pp1ab, spike (S), accessory protein (ORF3), envelope (E), membrane (M), and the nucleocapsid (N) proteins [3] . Like other coronaviruses (CoVs), PEDV initiates its replication cycle when the S protein binds to the cellular receptor. Shortly after receptor binding, the S protein undergoes conformational changes that facilitate the fusion between viral envelope and cell or endosomal membrane. Subsequently, PEDV releases genomic RNA into the cytosol of the host cell to initiate the translation of replicase polyproteins pp1a and 1ab followed by cleavage into small products by viral proteases. Concurrently, subgenomic mRNAs are generated by discontinuous transcription and translated to structural proteins. Nascent genomic RNA and structural proteins are assembled into new virions in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and subsequently released out of the host cell via exocytosis [4] .",

Although ORF3 has recently been proposed to play a role in regulating PEDV virus replication and pathogenesis [5] [6] [7] , its interaction with the host cell's proteins has not been clearly addressed. ORF3 has been shown to induce formation of double-membrane vesicles and prolong S phase of a cell cycle in transfected cells [8] . Moreover, our previous study demonstrated that ORF3 is localized in diverse cellular compartments, including cell surface, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Golgi apparatus (Golgi), and cooperated with the S protein to support virus replication in cell culture [9] . These findings point to the possibility that ORF3 engages in a variety of cellular pathways, some of which might be important for PEDV replication. Immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry is a combination method commonly used to identify novel viral-host protein-protein interaction [10] [11] [12] . Thus, identification of the ORF3 interactome would enable more insights into PEDV-host interplays.",

To this end, we hypothesized that VPS36 might modulate ORF3 expression by interacting with ubiquitinated ORF3 through its GLUE domain. To examine whether ORF3 was ubiquitinated, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with the plasmid expressing ubiquitin with HA-tag at N-terminus (HA-Ub) and that expressing ORF3myc. The ORF3 was pulled-down by immunoprecipitation using anti-myc bead, and the ubiquitination was detected by western blotting against anti-HA tag.

To this end, we co-expressed ORF3 and VPS36 in VeroE6-APN cells and performed an IFA and a western blot analysis to examine protein co-localization and expression. As shown in Figure 5a ,b, ORF3 was mainly co-localized with VPS36 in the cytoplasm and, notably, ORF3 expression was declined in the presence of VPS36. The reduction of ORF3 protein expression was unlikely due to cell cytotoxicity caused by VPS36 (Figure 5c ). To further investigate whether VPS36-mediated reduction of ORF3 would affect PEDV replication, we determined the growth kinetics of PEDV AV12 _ORF3myc in VPS36-expressing VeroE6-APN cells. As expected, we found that VPS36 could suppress PEDV AV12 _ORF3myc virus replication in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5d ). Difference in cytopathic effect (CPE) was also apparent in the presence of VPS36 in infected cells (Figure 5e ). Collectively, our data suggested that VPS36 could restrain PEDV AV12 _ORF3myc replication in VeroE6-APN cells. l-a-myc ::=:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::====:",

Our results so far are solely based on VPS36 overexpressing in host cells. To investigate whether the endogenously expressed VPS36 would have an inhibitory effect against PEDV AV12 _ORF3myc replication, we attempted to knock down the expression of VPS36 by DsiRNA targeting VPS36 (DsiVPS36). The DsiVPS36 sequences are shown in Table 2 . VeroE6-APN cells transfected with each DsiVPS36 were subjected to RT-qPCR and western blot analysis to determine VPS36 mRNA and protein expression, respectively. The results shown in Figure 6a ,b indicate that both DsiVPS36 could reduce VPS36 expression at mRNA and protein levels. Of note, DsiVPS36 was found to specifically target VPS36 but not the viral ORF3 (Figure 6c) . Interestingly, when VeroE6-APN cells were transfected with DsiVPS36 and subsequently infected by PEDV AV12 _ORF3myc, the growth of PEDV AV12 _ORF3myc was higher in VPS36 knock-down cells when compared to the infected cells with intact VPS36 expression (Figure 6d) . Notably, the difference in viral titer, albeit statistically significant, was less pronounced than those of viral copy number. Taken together, our findings suggest that endogenous VPS36 in VeroE6-APN cells also have suppressive effect against PEDV replication. Table 2 . DsiRNA and primers used in this study. ",

Recently, we have shown that ORF3 is not only localized in the ER-Golgi compartments but also on the cell surface by interacting with the spike protein [9] . As the transport through the ER and Golgi apparatus is critical for protein biosynthesis and secretory pathway [30] , the localization of ORF3 in these compartments points to the possibility that ORF3 might interact with various cellular proteins.

It should also be emphasized that proteins that weakly or transiently bind with ORF3 may not be identified in this study. Analyses by PANTHER database [18, 31] revealed that the majority of ORF3-inteacting partners are those that are localized in the organelles of the endo-lysosomal pathway including endosome, lysosome, and vacuole. This finding is in line with our previous study showing ORF3 localization in ER-Golgi secretory compartments [9] . It is also important to note that analyses, based on the biological process and pathway, strongly suggest the role of ORF3 in immune signaling pathways such as JAK/STAT, T and B cell activation, and interleukin signaling pathways (Table S1 ). In particular, we identified the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKBKB) as an interacting partner of ORF3. This finding might at least in part explain the ability of ORF3 to inhibit NF-\u03baB-mediated and IRF3-dependent type-I IFN production [32] .",

            "text": "Most, if not all, coronaviruses utilized endo-lysosomal pathway for entering into host cells [26] . It is intriguing that several ORF3-interacting proteins such as SNX13, MCOLN2, and VPS36 are associated with this pathway. VPS36, in particular, has been reported to regulate viral entry and morphogenesis [21, 22] . In this study, we showed that VPS36 could strongly interact with ORF3, leading to ORF3 downregulation, which, in turn, suppresses PEDV replication. As VPS36 is known to play a role for cargo sorting into MVBs to allow protein degradation when the MVBs fuse with lysosome [27] , it could possibly explain our finding that ORF3 might be prone to VPS36-mediated degradation. Interestingly, although VPS36 usually binds to ubiquitin through the GLUE domain and sorts the ubiquitinated proteins for protein degradation [23, 24] , our results indicate that VPS36 mediates ORF3 degradation perhaps via a distinct mechanism. Specifically, we found that VPS36 lacking the GLUE domain, but not the fragment bearing the GLUE domain, could efficiently bind to ubiquitinated ORF3. These results thus point to other possibilities such as ubiquitin-independent ORF3-VPS36 interaction or interaction with other components in the ESCRT complex [33, 34] . Another point worth mentioning is the fact that while lysosome inhibitor, chloroquine, failed to prevent the decrease of ORF3 expression, MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, could substantially alleviate ORF3 degradation, thereby suggesting that the ubiquitinated ORF3 might be targeted to the proteasome for degradation.",

            "text": "In the virus infection context, we observed that the downregulation of VPS36 by DsiRNAs could partially augment the viral yield. We are indeed disinclined to conclude that this effect is solely due to undisturbed ORF3 expression. It has been shown in our previous studies that ORF3 could suppress PEDV replication [7] . In addition, cell-adapted PEDV strains that replicate to high titer in vitro usually harbor abortive or truncated ORF3 [9] . In contrast, some studies showed conflicting results, showing that ORF3 could promote PEDV replication [6] . It is thus not clear whether the presence of intact ORF3 accounted for enhanced PEDV replication in our study. While VPS36-ORF3 interaction might play a role in regulating PEDV replication, we speculate that overexpression of VPS36 might affect PEDV replication via other mechanisms. Future studies will be needed to delineate the intracellular signaling pathway mediated by VPS36 in PEDV-infected cells and how VPS36 affects each step of PEDV replication.",

Among many candidates, VPS36 has been extensively investigated and identified as a potential suppressor of PEDV replication. A better understanding of how VPS36 interfere with PEDV replication is critical not only for our overall understanding of PEDV-host interaction, but for our general knowledge of how host proteins are modulated in the face of stress triggered by viral infection.",
