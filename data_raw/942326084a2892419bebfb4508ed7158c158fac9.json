These animals, hereafter termed the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs), were then chosen to become the obligate ancestors of all subsequent generations and bred to produce a distinct CC strain. The set of MRCAs from all strains composes the CC's obligate ancestors; that is, the set of individuals that together circumscribes the initial genetic material that can be passed on to subsequent CC mice. As a result of this breeding scheme, the inbred CC strain genomes are random and independent mosaics of the eight founder haplotypes Collaborative Cross Consortium (2012); (Srivastava et al. 2017) (Figure 1 ; more details at http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus).",

This typically involves inferring shared haplotype blocks and, by assuming that individuals sharing a haplotype block also share the corresponding allelic state, using this to impute genotype (Li et al. 2009; Marchini and Howie 2010) . A broad array of such imputation methods have been developed for use in humans (e.g., Hawley and Kidd 1995; Scheet and Stephens 2006; Marchini et al. 2007; Browning and Browning 2009; Howie et al. 2009; Li et al. 2010) and livestock (e.g., VanRaden et al. 2011; Hickey et al. 2012; Sargolzaei et al. 2014) ; these typically either start by inferring haplotypes from the genotype data or by approximating the pool of extant haplotypes via a large reference panel, and then use those haplotypes as a means to impute variant genotypes, which are assumed to be the primary interest.",

In such cases, haplotype-based imputation of specific variants may proceed as a second, refinement step to inform fine-mapping and candidate prioritization (Yalcin et al. 2005; Tian et al. 2011) . In any analyses using imputed variants, it important to note that the haplotype-based variant imputation is inherently probabilistic. A failure to account for variant imputation uncertainty can negatively affect the robustness of downstream decisions (e.g., overconfidence in a functional assignment), and can also produce misleading estimations of association significance and/ or variant effects (e.g., Marchini et al. 2007; Guan and Stephens 2008; Kutalik et al. 2011; Zheng et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2014) .",

This in turn reduces variant imputation uncertainty. For MPP RI strains in particular, once an animal's variants are imputed, the need for even sparse genotyping is largely obviated in its inbred descendants; they are effectively genotyped as well. Haplotypes can, and have been, similarly imputed for the entire CC population based on the CC MRCAs. In particular, a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based method (Fu et al. 2012) has previously been applied to MegaMUGA genotyping of the CC MRCA animals coupled with MegaMUGA genotyping from founder animals, Srivastava et al. 2017) to impute a probabilistic estimate of each CC strain's haplotype mosaic. Sequencing of the founders by the Sanger Institute has provided a catalog of the sequence variants within the founder haplotypes (Keane et al. 2011 ) as well as their predicted functional consequences (McLaren et al. 2010) , allowing for CC variant imputation.",

Nonetheless, our assumption is mostly reasonable: given the relatively small number of recombinations per CC line-on average 135 (Srivastava et al. 2017 )-the number of midgene recombinations is necessarily small, and an even smaller number of these recombinations will actually have an effect on downstream variants.

The user is interested in all zygosity variants, of all consequences, and all probabilities, and thus has applied no secondary restriction. After the user clicked \"Submit!,\" a URL to download the resulting table was generated, as well as an online version of the table. The first three rows of the table are shown here: noticeably they all represent the same variant in the same strain. The difference between the rows is highlighted in the yellow box: the genotype per row and its associated probability. Collectively, the three rows represent that there is a 25% probability of a C=C genotype, 25% of T=T; and 50% of T=C at this variant in CC012. (B) The remaining wrapped columns of output from part (A) (A was too wide). Note that each genotype has a different consequence, accentuating that only accounting for the most likely genotype would cause a nonnegligible loss of information. Also, note that this figure was pieced together from a screen capture to fit on a single page.",

Rather than describing them exhaustively, we will emphasize how each differs from a genotype query. a) Genotype cross query: rather than accepting a list of strains, this query only accepts two strains, simulates their F1 offspring, and returns data nearly identical in structure to genotype query data, except for a second strain per record. b) Diplotype query: there is no notion of a functional consequence with regard to a diplotype, thus, diplotype queries return neither functional consequences nor transcript IDs, which are closely tied to functional consequence in the ISVdb. Additionally, instead of records with (allele1, allele2) genotype, a diplotype query returns records with (haplotype1, haplotype2) diplotypes. c) Diplotype cross query: just like the genotype cross query, this query accepts two strains as input and simulates their F1.

With regard to completeness, in the generations since the MRCAs, additional mutations have accumulated and, thanks to the extremely small effective population size within each CC strain, rapidly become fixed. Sequencing results suggest that the number of variants now segregating in the CC has increased by 2% since the MRCA generation. (Srivastava et al. 2017) . Similarly, many of the regions harboring residual heterozygosity in the MRCA animals have by now become fixed. Regarding the precision of the imputation itself, the ability to construct the underlying haplotype mosaic is limited by, among other things, the resolution of the MegaMUGA genotyping array (or of any array), and particularly how well that array can mitigate the inherent difficulties arising with inferring haplotype state at recombination breakpoints and regions of identity-by-descent between founders. Our imputed variants thus reflect an incomplete and uncertain view of the current generation's CC genomes.",

Nonetheless, since sequencing is limited to a single animal per strain, it does not by itself provide a definitive answer genome-wide, largely due to residual heterozygosity.
