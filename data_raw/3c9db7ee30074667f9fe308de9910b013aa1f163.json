Following its discovery, many cases were identified in different regions of the Arabian Peninsula and worldwide thereafter [2, 3] . The most recent outbreak occurred in June 2015 in South Korea and was linked to a South Korean man who had recently traveled to the Middle East [3] . The infection then rapidly spread to 26 persons through close contact in a hospital. Within a few months, many cases (n=186) were reported in hospitalized and non-hospitalized persons in South Korea [3] . The disease showed a high mortality rate that reached up to 40%, which was higher than that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2002-2003 (10%) [4] .",

Lineage C of betacoronaviruses includes bat coronaviruses, which give a primitive impression regarding the origin of the virus [6] . The detection of MERS-CoV and its neutralizing antibodies in the sera of dromedary camels has shed light on the role of the camel as a possible animal reservoir, which may transmit the virus to humans [7] [8] [9] [10] . Indeed, researchers isolated the same MERS-CoV strain from both a camel \"in a barn\" and its infected owner in Saudi Arabia, thus providing further evidence of the potential airborne and direct contact transmission of the virus between camels and humans [11] .",

Researchers around the world are focused on the spike protein as the main target for vaccine development against MERS-CoV. The spike protein of MERS-CoV attaches to the host dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) receptor, which is expressed on several types of human cells [24] . Many studies published since 2012 suggesting vaccine models were constructed based on the spike protein and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) region to elicit a strong and protective immune response in vitro and in vivo [25] . Recombinant adenoviral vector vaccines are one of the most effective vaccines and showed interesting results during SARS-CoV outbreaks [12, 26, 27] . Since 2013, several studies were published, in which different viral vectors (e.g., adenoviruses and vaccinia virus) were used to develop recombinant vaccine candidates based on full spike gene or part of it and tested their ability to produce protective immunity against MERS-CoV infection [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . However, further investigations are needed on these suggested vaccines including testing their ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies in different animal models, stimulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses and their corresponding cytokine and chemokine profiles, distribution within the host, and their safety and duration profiles.",

These findings support the ability of this vaccine candidate to distribute effectively within host tissues and express the target protein. It has been established that DPP4 is expressed on multiple cell types in the human body including cells in the kidneys and lungs [24] . However, the N glycoprotein, but not the S glycoprotein, of MERS was the target of investigation of MERS-CoV localization using IHC [38] . The N glycoprotein was clearly present in lung tissues following MERS exposure. In fact, the current study can be considered pioneering given the use of the S1 glycoprotein to express viral distribution in tissues. Therefore, the expression of S1 protein in kidney tissues and not in lung might be used to explain previous in vitro experiments, which found a cytopathic effect of the MERS-CoV infection inside primary human kidney cells but not in primary human bronchial epithelial cells [39] . In a recent study, the adenoviral vector with enhanced green fluorescent protein but not the adenoviral vector with MERS in a hDPP4 mice experiment after intramuscular or intranasal injection [21] . This supporting our finding that this construct was able to reach the lung tissues, but the S1 protein was not expressed in lung tissues. However, S1 gene detection in lung tissues by conventional PCR and not by IHC indicates further investigation is necessary regarding the level and intensity of S1 expression in this tissue. Additional studies are also needed to explore S1 protein expression in other tissues such as the liver and intestine given the expression of DPP4 in these tissues [40] .",

In contrast, IL-4 production in cell culture showed a significant increase in control animals after antigen stimulation, while the production of this cytokine was significantly decreased in the At week 4, the fold change in IFN-\u03b3 gene expression was significantly higher in the Ad-Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-S1 group than that of both control groups (Ad-cytomegalovirus [CMV] and phosphate-buffered saline). However, there was a prominent increase in IFN-\u03b3 gene expression at week 6 in both Ad-MERS-S1 and Ad-CMV groups compared to that in week 4.

Interestingly, there was a significant increase in IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 gene expression in antigen-stimulated cell culture obtained from mice vaccinated with Ad-CMV at week 6. This might be due to the ability of adenoviruses to elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses [42, 43] .

The truncated RBD fused with the Fc portion of human IgG was able to elicit both isotypes with a relatively higher amount of the IgG2a isotype (Th1 response) [44] . Recombinant adenovirus vector carrying the S1 subunit or the whole S gene was also able to induce both types of the immune response.
