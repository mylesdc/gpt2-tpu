The results demonstrated that MUB and EF1-\u03b1 were the two most stable reference genes for all samples.

With the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, many candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of active ingredients have been obtained from the transcriptome database [14, 15] .

            "text": "With its high sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity as well as its high-throughput characteristic, the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) has become the most powerful and reliable molecular technique for gene expression analysis in a wide range of biological research areas [16, 17] . However, the quantitative results are often affected by several error sources, such as the amount of starting material, the RNA integrity, reverse transcription, and qRT-PCR amplification [18] . To obtain accurate qRT-PCR analysis results, it is crucial to normalize the raw gene expression data. The use of stable reference genes as normalization factors to minimize these errors has become the most common approach [18] . Housekeeping genes, or genes involved in basic metabolism, such as actin (ACT ), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), tubulin (TUB), and elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1\u03b1) have traditionally served as references in plant science, because they were believed to be consistently expressed across various tissues, developmental stages, and treatments [19, 20] . Nevertheless, numerous studies have reported that the transcription level of commonly-used housekeeping genes shows unacceptable variability under different experimental conditions [21] . If inappropriate reference genes are selected for normalization, the noise of the expressing assay will be increased, and thus, misinterpretation of the results will appear [22] . Consequently, it is essential to systematically evaluate potential reference genes to ensure that they are appropriate for a specific experimental condition [23] . To date, IGG (http://icg.big. ac.cn), a wiki-driven knowledgebase that collects internal reference genes for diverse species, has been integrating a comprehensive collection of more than 150 plants [24] , such as Arabidopsis [25] , cucumber [26] , wheat [27] , rice [28] , Artemisia annua [29] , and Panax ginseng [30] .",

            "text": "qRT-PCR has emerged as a broadly accepted method for gene expression analysis due to its accuracy, highthroughput, and sensitivity [18] . Nevertheless, selecting reference genes from the literature without systematic validation could cause inaccurate qRT-PCR results [22] . Hence, the selection and validation of appropriate reference genes for normalizing data is mandatory to acquire accurate quantification results under various experimental conditions for a given species. High-throughput sequencing technologies with fast development have provided a highly effective method to study plant transcriptomics [41] , plant epigenomics [42] , and plant genomics [43] . Moreover, the creation of large data sets and gene expression data by sequencing are regarded as an abundant source for reference gene selection, especially for non-model plants. Therefore, I. indigotica large-scale transcriptome data (SRR1051997) can serve as a gene pool to identify potential internal control genes. Systematic and comprehensive evaluation of nine reference genes was performed in different tissues of I. indigotica and in leaves subjected to various treatments. The results showed that a single amplification peak presented on the melting curve images, so all the primer sets had quite good specificity (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ). Additionally, the qRT-PCR performance of tested reference genes suggested high amplification efficiency values (close to 100%) ( Table 1 ). The statements mentioned above justify that these primers worked as expected and were reliable for further analyses of the stability of candidate reference genes. Three statistical algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to analyze the stability of these candidates. However, the stability rankings obtained from the algorithms were not identical. The results of geNorm and NormFinder were similar for some conditions, but discrepancies occurred for the orders ranked by Best-Keeper. For instance, in the ABA treatment, geNorm and NormFinder calculated ACT to be the most stable gene, while it was ranked moderately by BestKeeper. This apparent variation was probably due to the different calculation principles in the three statistical algorithms [44] . To obtain consistent results, a comprehensive online tool, RefFinder, which integrates the three algorithms, has been widely applied to generate a final comprehensive ranking of reference gene expression [45] . In the current study, the RefFinder analysis, identified MUB as the most stable gene in the all-samples set. Meanwhile, UBC, \u03b1-TUB and \u03b2-TUB had relatively poor expression stability values, which is similar to previous results in Artemisia annua L [29] and Brassica napus [46] .",

However, an increasing number of studies is showing that the expression stabilities of most of these genes actually have great variation [22, 45] . Therefore, the use of housekeeping genes as references must be validated under specific conditions. In this study, six traditional housekeeping genes, which are involved in the cytoskeleton (ACT , \u03b1-TUB and Fig. 4 Relative expression of IiCCR using the selected reference genes. The results were normalized using the selected stable reference genes (singly or in combination) and the unstable genes in sample sets across treatment with a N, b different tissues, c ABA, and d MeJA. The bars indicate the standard error (\u00b1 SE) evaluated from three biological replicates \u03b2-TUB), post-translational modification (UBC and CYP), and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (EF1-\u03b1), were shown to display dramatic differences in expression patterns under conditions of low-nitrogen stress, hormonal stimuli, and in different tissues. CYP was the most stable reference gene in different tissues of I. indigotica but exhibited relatively low stability in Lycoris aurea [19] . EF1-\u03b1 ranked neither as the top, nor as the least suitable gene under four experimental conditions. \u03b1-TUB and \u03b2-TUB of the tubulin gene family are used as reference genes in many species, such as Capsicum annuum L. [47] , Cynodon dactylon under cold stress [48] , and Eremosparton songoricum under various stress conditions [49] , but in our study, they, along with UBC, always displayed the least stable expression pattern. In addition, ACT was ranked first in ABA treatment and was also the most stable gene in the all-samples set. Consistent with the result in Lilium davidii var. unicolor, ACT also showed strong stability in I. indigotica [50] ; however, ACT is not appropriate for gene normalization in different organs of Salix matsudana [51] .",

In this research, three newly reported reference genes, MUB, TIP41, and RPL, were analyzed. MUBs are membraneanchored ubiquitin-fold proteins, which are thought to play a crucial role in diverse signaling cascades [52] . The corresponding genes are universally expressed in the tissues of many plants, animals, and fungi [53] . In Salix matsudana, MUB was shown to be highly stable under salt and drought stress conditions [51] . In the current study, we also found MUB to be the most suitable gene in the all-samples subset. The RPL gene also served as a stable reference gene [54] , but it showed less stable expression patterns under almost all tested conditions in I. indigotica. Similar to Lycoris aurea [19] , TIP41 was revealed to be the optimal reference gene for MeJA stress. As for I. indigotica, TIP41 also ranked first under low-nitrogen stress and was selected as the best reference gene. Previous studies have indicated that TIP41 has fairly stable expression during salt stress in oilseed rape as well as at different developmental stages and in various tissues of Arabidopsis plants [46, 55] . In addition, TIP41 was not only validated as a reliable internal control gene under abiotic stress in chickpeas [56] , it was shown to be suitable for cucumber plants under various degrees of nitrogen nutrition [57] .",

RefFind produced the final comprehensive ranking, showing that the optimal reference genes were MUB and EF1-\u03b1 across all samples; TIP41 and CYP under low-nitrogen stress; EF1-\u03b1 and TIP41 under MeJA stress; CYP and EF1-\u03b1 in different tissues; and ACT and MUB under ABA stress.

The PCR program was as follows: 5 min at 94 \u00b0C, 35 cycles of 10 s at 98 \u00b0C, 30 s at 60 \u00b0C, and 30 s at 68 \u00b0C, followed by 5 min extension at 68 \u00b0C. The PCR products were run on 2% agarose gel electrophoresis (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). The qRT-PCR was conducted in 96-well plates with an ABI 7500 realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using the SYBR \u00ae Green I (Biouniquer). The reaction mixture contained 2 \u03bcL of five-fold diluted cDNA, 2 \u03bcL of each primer (10 mM), 0.4 \u03bcL of 50 \u00d7 ROX1 and 10 \u03bcL of RealTime PCR Master Mix to give a final volume of 20 \u03bcL. The program for qRT-PCR was set as 10 min at 95 \u00b0C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C, and 30 s at 60 \u00b0C. The melting curves were recorded in each reaction by constantly raising the temperature from 65 to 90 \u00b0C (Additional file 1: Figure  S2 ). Each sample was run with three technical replicates, and every plate included one no template control (NTC) to monitor possible DNA contamination. The threshold cycle (Ct) was measured automatically. A standard curve was generated with five-fold series dilution of the mixed cDNA of all samples to calculate the PCR efficiency (E) and correlation coefficient (R 2 ). The PCR amplification efficiency (E) of each primer pair was calculated by the curve slope using E = [5 (\u22121/slope) \u2212 1] \u00d7 100% [51] .",

Finally, RefFinder (http://150.216.56.64/refer enceg ene.php) integrated the three algorithms to obtain an overall ranking. For geNorm and Normfinder, the mean Ct value of three biological repeats from each gene was converted into the relative expression level using the formula 2 \u2212\u0394Ct (\u0394Ct = Ct value of each sample \u2212 the lowest Ct value) [60] . For BestKeeper, the mean Ct value was imported into the program directly. Stability measures (M) of the candidate genes were calculated with the geNorm algorithm. Stepwise exclusion of the gene with the highest M (least stable gene) value was used to rank the analyzed genes. Subsequently, the pairwise variation (Vn/Vn + 1) values calculated by the geNorm were used to determine the optimal number of candidate reference genes; a value below 0.15 indicated that no additional reference gene was required. NormFinder evaluated the genes' expression stability by assessing intra and intergroup variation in a given sample set, offering a ranking in which the highest stability (S) value represented the least stable gene [61] . BestKeeper was used to calculate the standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) of the average Ct values. Analyzed genes with a standard deviation (SD) > 1 were considered to be unacceptable reference genes, and the gene with the lowest CV \u00b1 SD value was the most stable one.",
