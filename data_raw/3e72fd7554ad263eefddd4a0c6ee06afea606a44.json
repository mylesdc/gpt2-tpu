Such approaches are especially valuable when specimens are in poor condition or comprise very limited material, a situation that often applies to chiropteran (bat) specimens submitted to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for rabies diagnosis. Coupled with phenotypic plasticity of many species and inconclusive taxonomic keys, species identification using only morphological traits can be challenging. In this study, a microarray assay with associated PCR of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was developed for differentiation of 14 bat species submitted to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency from 1985-2012 for rabies diagnosis. The assay was validated with a reference collection of DNA from 153 field samples, all of which had been barcoded previously. The COI gene from 152 samples which included multiple specimens of each target species were successfully amplified by PCR and accurately identified by the microarray. One sample that was severely decomposed failed to amplify with PCR primers developed in this study, but amplified weakly after switching to alternate primers and was accurately typed by the microarray. Thus, the chiropteran microarray was able to accurately differentiate between OPEN ACCESS",

In particular, due to the mitochondrial genome's limited intra-specific variation but significant inter-specific divergence, partial nucleotide sequencing (barcoding) of certain mitochondrial loci for the purpose of species discrimination has gained widespread acceptance [2, 3] . Two mitochondrial loci, cyt b (cytochrome b) and COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I), have gained particular prominence in this role [2, 4] . Based on the pioneering work of Hebert and colleagues [5, 6] , the international barcode of life (IBOL) consortium, which seeks to generate millions of DNA barcodes for thousands of species world-wide, has adopted COI barcodes as the standard for studies on biodiversity throughout the animal kingdom [7] .",

Throughout the continent, including Canada, multiple RV strains are maintained by specific wildlife hosts, of both carnivora and chiroptera orders, within discrete but overlapping geographic areas and there is a need for tools that discriminate both host species and viral strains [18] [19] [20] . Currently, hundreds of confirmed rabid bats are reported annually in North America [17] and the persistence of RV in a broad range of native bat species continues to be a public health hazard due to the high fatality rate of this disease and frequent failure of the public to associate bat contact and even superficial bites with potential rabies exposure [21, 22] . While timely post-exposure or pre-exposure vaccination can prevent rabies in humans and other mammals, after onset of clinical disease the prognosis is extremely poor with almost 100% mortality [23] . Additionally, the persistence of RV in chiropteran hosts provides a source of potential cross-species infection for domestic animals and can, on rare occasions, result in the establishment of bat RV variants in terrestrial wildlife [24] , events which have the potential to undermine rabies control activities in non-flying RV reservoir species. Improved knowledge of the epidemiology and geographical distribution of bat-associated RVs, including the species responsible for disease maintenance, would facilitate better risk management of this disease and limit its impact on the health of humans and domestic animals.",

            "text": "In Canada, rabies diagnosis is routinely performed by the Rabies Centre of Expertise of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). Large numbers of bats are submitted annually and species determination is currently based on traditional taxonomic methods in which the specimen is visually examined for anatomical features consistent with each species [25] [26] [27] . Although 17 species of bats are considered indigenous to Canada [28] three species, the spotted bat (Euderma maculatum), eastern small-footed bat (Myotis leibii), and the western small-footed bat (Myotis ciliolabrum) rarely come in contact with humans due to their scarcity and/or their very limited ranges within Canada. As a result they are virtually never submitted for rabies testing. The pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) is also uncommon and very infrequently submitted so the vast majority of submitted specimens represent just 13 species. The bat samples received are often in poor condition due to decomposition or injury, or in some cases are incomplete (e.g., head only), thereby making species identification difficult or even impossible. In addition, some species (particularly of the Myotis genus) share highly similar physical features which further challenge species identification of these samples. To address these issues a recent study, which generated barcodes for 260 bat specimens representing 13 Canadian bat species, proposed the use of COI barcoding methods to improve species identification of submitted specimens [29] . Similar strategies involving sequence determination of other mitochondrial loci have been applied to confirm the nature of rabies reservoir species in Latin America [30] , and to expand knowledge of the epidemiology of bat lyssaviruses in Europe [31] . However, to facilitate routine use of such an approach in a diagnostic setting it was determined that a highly automated method which could be applied by analysts not expert in complex molecular biology techniques would be highly valuable.",

Using these same principles this report describes the development of a universal PCR for amplification of the COI gene and the development of a microarray for differentiation of 14 Canadian bat species that represent virtually all specimens submitted to the CFIA for rabies diagnosis for the past 20 years.

Aminoallyl dUTP was incorporated by random priming and the product was purified using spin columns, and labelled using Alexa Fluor 647 dye. The fluorescently labelled samples were purified using spin columns and stored at 4 \u00b0C until use.",

Following printing, the humidity was increased to 70% overnight and then gradually reduced to ambient humidity the following day. Printed slides were stored in a desiccating chamber until use. Printed slides were blocked by incubation in pre-hybridization buffer (5\u00d7 SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1 mg/mL BSA) for 45 min at 42 \u00b0C. Slides were then washed three times in 0.1\u00d7 SSC and once in Milli-Q water before being dried using a slide centrifuge (ArrayIt), and loaded onto a 24-well hybridization cassette (ArrayIt). Twenty-one microlitres of labelled amplicon was mixed with an equal volume of hybridization buffer (20% formamide, 10\u00d7 SSC, 0.2% SDS, and 0.2 mg/mL salmon sperm DNA), denatured at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min and then cooled to room temperature. The labelled amplicon and hybridization buffer mixture was loaded into individual wells of the hybridization cassette, which was then sealed and incubated overnight at 42 \u00b0C. The following day, hybridized slides were washed once in 2\u00d7 SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 \u00b0C, twice in 1\u00d7 SSC and twice in 0.1\u00d7 SSC at room temperature. Finally, slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned using the GenePix 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Image analysis was performed using GenePix Pro software version 5.0 (Molecular Devices). The reactivity of each sample to the capture probes was represented using the average median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the replicates. Probe reactivity was considered positive if it had an MFI greater than the mean MFI of the whole probe set plus two times the standard deviation. This cut-off value was calculated individually for each sample.",

A previous study of the variation of the COI gene in 13 Canadian bat species required the use of four separate PCR reactions for successful amplification of the COI gene from all the species [29] . Refinement of this PCR to facilitate target amplification by a single universal primer set was a prerequisite for efficient microarray analysis. Accordingly, an alignment of all available 685 Canadian bat COI gene sequences was examined to assist with primer design. This revealed gaps in the required sequence information. Thus multiple sets of PCR primers flanking the COI gene were designed and used to amplify the entire COI gene of single specimens for 13 of the 14 targeted Canadian bat species, and the majority of the COI gene of the remaining species (tricolored bat). The information obtained from sequencing the COI amplicons allowed design of a single primer pair for partial amplification of the COI gene of all 14 species. These COI primers were AECOX-1TAG FWD-3.0 (5\u2032-TAGRTTTA CAGYCTAATRCCTACTC-3\u2032) and AECOX-R1A (5\u2032-ACYTCAGGRTGRCCAAARAATCA-3\u2032).",

While many of the DNA samples included in this study were of poor quality based on analysis by gel electrophoresis (data not shown), all but one specimen were successfully amplified, including multiple samples from each target species. Thus these results indicate that for the vast majority of samples that were encountered, the universal PCR primers designed in this study can successfully replace the four separate PCRs [29] previously used to amplify the partial COI gene of the targeted bat species. The one sample that failed to amplify was badly decomposed and a weak product was only generated after switching to alternate primers that produced a slightly different amplicon of approximately the same size (data not shown). As shown in the following sections and Table 2 , for the purpose of this application a sufficiently large COI sequence which encompasses significant genetic diversity to allow use of multiple capture probes is necessary for accurate species identification. However given the possibility that other suboptimal field specimens are likely to be encountered, reduction in amplicon size may improve PCR product yields as described in other studies which used smaller microcodes [45, 46] . Thus amplification of this region of COI as two smaller multiplexed PCRs each <400 bp could be entertained. ",

The probes for Yuma bat (YUB) and Keen's bat (KEB) were more problematic; YU2 cross-reacted moderately with both the western-BBB and tricolored bat (EPB) samples ( Figure 2 ) although this appeared to be substantially reduced when the hybridization temperature was raised to 42 \u00b0C (data not shown). Both probes for KEB exhibited significant binding to some of the other species; strong binding of the probe KE1 to products of the Lasiurus bats (HRB and REB), as shown in Figure 2 , was partly reduced by increasing the hybridization temperature to 42 \u00b0C but this did not entirely eliminate cross-reactivity with the HRB sample.

However, one REB sample (#116) also showed strong reactivity with the KE1 probe for Keen's bat (P/N = 99.0) that was not observed with the other eight REB specimens (Figure 3(A) ). Sequencing of the amplicon from sample #116 revealed that the KE1 probe binding region had a single mismatch with the penultimate nucleotide of the KE1 probe, while the amplicon from the other eight REB specimens had an additional mismatch with a nucleotide near the center of the KE1 probe (Table 3 ). Only four out of 42 COI sequences from REB in the custom database had the same sequence as sample #116 in the KE1 probe binding region while 38 out of 42 (90.5%) had two mismatches in the KE1 binding region. The observation that the majority of the REB CO1 sequences present in the database have two mismatches with the KE1 probe suggest that most REB specimens will likely not react with this probe. The existence of a small number of REB sequences with polymorphisms that allows binding to the KE1 probe indicates that samples which react with both RE and KE1 probes should be categorized as an eastern red bat (REB). Collectively, capture probes for a particular species detected all specimens of that species. However, amplicons from a few of the species did not react with all probes for that species. This is likely due to polymorphisms that exist within the probe binding regions. For example, recent barcoding data divided all Canadian big brown bats (BBB) (Eptesicus fuscus) into two distinct populations (western and eastern) [47] . A capture probe designed from available sequences of BBB from British Columbia (BB-W) and a probe designed to sequences of BBB from the rest of Canada (BB-E) were able to differentiate the two populations using Mean + 0.25SD as a cutoff for positivity (Figure 3(B) ).",

The present study has employed a subset of the collection examined previously so that the phylogeny of all of these samples was already known. Unfortunately the unclassified specimen was not available for inclusion in this study but interrogation of its sequence revealed that it contained no mismatches with probe LE2, one mismatch with KE2 and two mismatches with both LB probes; accordingly it would most likely have been identified as M. evotis. Apart from this single sample, at least from a Canadian perspective, identification of these three species by barcoding and microarray analysis appears to be straightforward and a relatively large number of specimens belonging to these species have been tested in the current study.

Moreover, it is quite possible that climate change will result in the future northwards movement of bat species from the USA into Canada such that expansion of the array to enable identification of additional bat species will be required. One of the advantages of the microarray is the large number of capture probes that can be incorporated to provide additional redundancy and to increase assay resolution for differentiation of a larger number of species. This feature could potentially broaden the application of this technology to areas such as wildlife survey and conservation. Iatrogenic incursions of bats from further afield is also possible though probably highly infrequent; such specimens would likely give negative or inconclusive results with the microarray described and will likely require traditional barcoding or high density resequencing arrays for sequence characterization.",

            "text": "A number of prior studies have combined barcoding and microarray methods, mostly by employing traditional glass slide microarrays, to facilitate species identification. The scope of these prior studies varied widely. In one study Affymetrix technology was used to develop methods for the identification of a wide range of mammalian species [35] ; another study targeted a range of European fish species [37] . Some studies have focused on more limited numbers of species restricted to specific regions and/or animal orders [34, 38] while others have explored the utility of microarrays to identify species likely to transmit infectious disease agents [36, 38] . While the present study has used a similar approach to design and validate a tool for a very specific purpose, further development of this technique could enlarge its applicability. One possibility is to expand the array for use in other jurisdictions by adding probes for the differentiation of a larger number of species, e.g., the 39 species of indigenous North American bats for which cases of rabies have been reported [49] . The principle could also be extended to the analysis of the much larger number of bat species that inhabit tropical regions of the Americas, many of which harbor RV variants [50] ; indeed an array that identifies many neotropical bat species from Guyana based on their barcodes [8] has been described previously [35] . Alternatively, the adaptation of this method to novel far less labour intensive microarray platforms could be beneficial. For example, use of a single instrument that fully integrates and automates a complex molecular assay from nucleic acid extraction and gene amplification to array-based detection would yield a highly user-friendly microarray platform with a much more streamlined workflow. An instrument that uses an inexpensive bio-contained disposable reaction cartridge to perform such a workflow has recently been developed and applied to the detection of viruses responsible for human sexually transmitted diseases [51] . A fully automated and integrated assay for molecular species identification that does not require user handling after sample addition may be more cost-effective and rapid than DNA sequencing for applications described in this study. Thus, future work will focus on the adaptation of the methods described in this report to such highly automated platforms. As a result genetic-based tools for bat species identification will become more accessible, not only for laboratory based analysis but also for studies of bats in the field where live specimens could be rapidly and unequivocally identified using wing-punches or hair buds.",

Amplification of COI from a highly degraded sample required an alternate primer pair. A microarray-based method for identification of chiropteran specimens to the species level was also successfully developed and validated with 153 field samples. This chiropteran PCR and microarray assay would allow unequivocal identification to species of most, if not all, bat specimens diagnosed as rabid in Canada. This new test for species assignment of rabies positive bats can be used in conjunction with existing methods for rabies virus typing to provide scientific information into the host range and host association of various rabies virus variants in bat species in Canada. The associations made between bat species and rabies virus variants will improve knowledge of rabies epidemiology and provide much needed information to support ongoing surveillance of rabies and to assess the public health risk to Canadians. Further planned expansion of this barcoding microarray assay to include more probes for redundancy and allow differentiation of additional species, and adaptation to a fully automated platform would make this technology accessible to a wider group of potential users such as those involved in wildlife conservation.",

A cutoff of two times the standard deviation of the fluorescent intensity for all probes plus the mean fluorescent intensity of all probes was selected for each sample for positivity. Specific probes for each sample are indicated by a yellow box. All specimens were accurately assigned. The outlying signal with the KE1 probe is due to cross-reactivity with an eastern red bat (REB) specimen with a polymorphism which resulted in just a single mismatch to the Keen's bat probe (KE1). Panel B: Heat map of microarray results for 25 big brown bat (BBB) field specimens within the panel. A cutoff of 0.25 times the standard deviation of the fluorescent intensity for all probes plus the mean fluorescent intensity of all probes was selected for each sample for positivity.
