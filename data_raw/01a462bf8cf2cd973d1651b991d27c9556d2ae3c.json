Here, the crystal structures of TYMV PRO/DUB mutants and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that an idiosyncratic mobile loop participates in reversibly constricting its unusual catalytic site by adopting \"open\", \"intermediate\" or \"closed\" conformations. The two cis-prolines of the loop form a rigid flap that in the most closed conformation zips up against the other side of the catalytic cleft. The intermediate and closed conformations also correlate with a reordering of the TYMV PRO/DUB catalytic dyad, that then assumes a classical, yet still unusually mobile, OTU DUB alignment. Further structure-based mutants designed to interfere with the loop's mobility were assessed for enzymatic activity in vitro and in vivo, and were shown to display reduced DUB activity while retaining PRO activity. This indicates that control of the switching between the dual PRO/DUB activities resides prominently within this loop next to the active site. Introduction of mutations into the viral genome revealed that the DUB activity contributes to the extent of viral RNA accumulation both in single cells and in whole plants. In addition, the conformation of the mobile flap was also found to influence symptoms severity in planta. Such mutants now provide powerful tools with which to study the specific roles of reversible ubiquitylation in viral infection.",

            "text": "Viruses have much smaller genomes than their hosts. Consequently, they often encode proteins which are multifunctional. For instance, some viral proteases have a dual function, being also deubiquitinases, i.e. enzymes capable of removing ubiquitin tags grafted onto proteins and that often target them for destruction. The protease and deubiquitinase activities share a single active site that is used alternately for one function or the other, but how this switch between activities may be regulated is presently unknown. To answer this question, we studied a simple plant virus that is a useful model system for these complex Introduction Ubiquitin (Ub) is a 76-residue protein that is highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. Attachment of Ub to cellular proteins (referred to as ubiquitylation) is recognized as a key regulatory pathway, critical to a number of major cellular processes, including protein homeostasis, intracellular signalling, transcription, and immune responses [1] . Ub is covalently linked to the target protein via an isopeptide bond between its C-terminal Gly residue, and an acceptor amino acid of the target protein substrate, in most cases a Lys residue. Further conjugation steps to Ub itself can generate polyubiquitylated chains in a number of structurally different configurations [2, 3] that may play different roles in the cell, illustrating the exquisite versatility of Ub conjugation [4, 5] .",

Most of these enzymes are Cys proteinases, which can either trim or remove poly-Ub chains from substrate proteins, thus contributing to the reversal of Ub-dependent processes in cells. The breadth of DUBs in the regulation of cellular processes, and their role in promoting human disease, has become apparent over recent years [8, 9] , leading to further insights into the mechanistic details of such enzymes and their regulation, combined with increased interest in their use as potential drug targets [10, 11] .",

Viruses use various strategies to exploit Ub and Ub-like modifier pathways, with some recruiting host enzymes, whereas others encode their own ubiquitin ligases, or their own DUBs. Such mechanisms may be beneficial to the virus either by creating a more favorable cellular environment, by fine-tuning viral regulatory processes, or by inhibiting host defense mechanisms.",

For this purpose, two mutant versions of TYMV PRO/DUB designed to weaken PRO:PRO interactions were expressed and crystallized [38] . The structures reported herein reveal that the loop harboring the 865-GPP-867 motif is a highly mobile flap on the otherwise rigid PRO/DUB framework a result that is confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. Closure of this flap brings the catalytic site region closer to the canonical OTU DUB active site as seen in complex with Ub, even though the catalytic dyad remains exposed and unusually flexible. Functional analyses of structure-guided mutants indicate that the GPP flap acts as a switch for DUB activity, making it possible to dissociate the PRO and DUB activities of the enzyme, and to analyze their function in the viral life cycle independently. Viruses carrying these mutations displayed a reduced replication efficiency, confirming the critical importance of the DUB activity of PRO/DUB in control of the TYMV replication cycle, independently of the polyprotein processing. In addition, we observed that mutations affecting the loop mobility also markedly affected the severity of viral symptoms in planta.",

Molecule 'B' is slightly less ordered as revealed by a 10 \u00c5 2 higher average Bfactor (Table 1, S2A Fig) . Clear electron density is present for residues 730-874 of molecule 'A', and 732-874 of molecule 'B'. Both molecules have their C-termini far from the catalytic sites of other molecules in the crystal packing. We thus have two independent views of PRO/ DUB not engaged as a substrate in a PRO:PRO complex. Superimposition of molecules 'A' and 'B' of the \u0394C5 mutant with the WT (engaged) PRO/DUB (Fig 1A) shows that PRO/DUB retains the same conformation in all three environments, with the exception of loop 864-868. This loop was strongly constrained in the previous structure due to the cleaved PRO molecule's loop being bound by the cleaving PRO molecule. It is now released in both molecules of the mutant protein \u0394C5, and displays high mobility in this disengaged form. In molecule 'B', Pro866 at the tip of the loop (Fig 1B) In fact, in molecule 'B', the mobility of this loop leads to the closure of a hydrophobic zipper between Pro866 and Pro867 on one side, and Leu820 and Leu781 across the catalytic cleft on the other side ( Fig 1B) . His869 and Cys783 also come significantly closer together. Presence of unidentified atoms (S3 Fig) , possibly covalent adducts with DTT or sulfur compounds present in our cryosolution (see Materials and Methods), complicated the unambiguous modeling of the Cys783 side chain. However, it is clear that, in this closed conformation, His869 is now close enough to abstract a proton from Cys783. The large movement of the 865-GPP-867 motif observed in molecule 'B' as compared to the WT engaged PRO is due to a distinct flexing of the tip of the beta sheet into which it is inserted. This flexing extends to the neighboring 842-845 loop and, particularly, to the Asp843 at its tip that follows loop 864-868 ( Fig 1C) . In contrast, the conserved GPP motif itself, with its two cis-prolines, changes very little, although Gly865 shifts slightly, moving in the Ramachandran plot of molecule 'B' to a region that is disallowed to non-glycine residues. In summary, the crystal structure of \u0394C5 indicates that, while TYMV PRO/DUB is a rigid molecule, it harbours a very mobile loop, 864-TGPPS-868, that can shift the GPP flap at its tip with its atypical double cis-proline, from an \"open\" state where it can be recognized by another PRO molecule [21] , to two other states: a \"closed\" one where it forms half of a hydrophobic zipper, and an \"intermediate\" one, halfway in between. The closed zipper constricts the P side of the catalytic cleft and also brings the catalytic His869 closer to the catalytic Cys783.",

Monitoring the closure of the flap by the distance between C\u03b1s of P867 and L820 (Fig 1B) clearly shows that the flap then oscillates around this central conformation, but intermittently either closes to the other side of the cleft or goes back to the more open conformation (Fig 2A, top, the corresponding distances in the crystal structures are indicated as \"open\", \"interm.\" and \"closed\", respectively). These results confirm that the new structures complete the range of conformations accessible to the GPP flap and further indicate that the 'A' molecule best represents the PRO/DUB conformation when it neither is engaged as a substrate nor acts as a peptidase (Fig 2A, middle) . Interestingly, concomitant with the initial closure of the flap, H869 comes sufficiently close to C783 that the latter realigns and the two side chains form a hydrogen bond. This bond is formed in an orientation of side chains that is identical to that in other OTU DUBs (see Discussion). However the imidazole ring of H869 is still unengaged by a third catalytic residue and remains loose, frequently breaking the H-bond to C783 (Fig 2A, bottom) . These events do not correlate with the mobility of the GPP flap around the intermediate, equilibrium position. These results indicate that the organization of the catalytic site is also brought closer to the classical OTU DUB's by flap closure to the intermediate position, but is not further ordered in the closed flap conformation.",

            "text": "Molecular dynamics simulations of these mutants, performed in the same conditions as for the wild type, show that the molecular effects of these mutations are globally as expected, but also offer new insights into the link between flap movement and active site reorganization. Mutants P866G/P867G, G865A and D843A all significantly alter the dynamics of the GPP flap. First off, it becomes more mobile than in the wild type (S2B Fig). However, it does so in very different ways: In mutant D843A ( Fig 2B) the loop harboring A843 does not act anymore as a spring to the GPP flap. As a result, the flap remains closed much longer, but also at times opens wider, than in the wild type (Fig 2B, top) . At first sight G865A displays a similar behavior ( Fig 2C, top) , somewhat surprisingly since the mutation was designed to disfavor closure of the flap. However, examination of the trajectory shows that the constraint imposed by A865 leads to a twist of the flap. Only P867 comes into contact with L820 even in the most closed conformation, leaving the hydrophobic zipper half open (Fig 2C, middle) , in contrast to the D843A closed conformation (Fig 2B, middle) that is identical to the crystallographic closed flap conformation. The most disruptive mutant is P866G/P867G (Fig 2D) . Although the loop initially relaxes into the intermediate position, as in the wild type and the two other mutants, it is more disordered and, strikingly, in the second half of the simulation shifts to a position that is on average in an \"open\" rather than \"intermediate\" conformation (Fig 2D, top and middle) . Interestingly, this opening correlates with loss of the H-bond between H869 and C783 (Fig 2D,  bottom) , leading to an inactive conformation of the catalytic site. These results further confirm the connection between loop closure and active site organization. In contrast, the catalytic dyad's dynamics are much less affected in the two other mutants G865A and D843A (Fig 2B  and 2C, bottom) .",

The seeding procedure led to the same crystal form, and the I847A crystal is essentially identical to the \u0394C5 crystal. The only difference in packing between the \u0394C5 and I847A crystals is a slight shift of molecule 'B' with respect to The fact that the two mutants I847A and \u0394C5 display identical conformations in the same crystal packing environments shows that the mutations themselves have altered neither the overall structure of the molecule, nor the conformation of loop 864-868. Thus, the mobility and zippering of loop 864-868, and the associated changes in the active site conformations as compared to the WT PRO:PRO complex, are properties of the PRO/DUB framework and reflect available conformations of this mobile loop.

Processing at the HEL#POL and PRO#HEL cleavage sites of the 206K substrate was assayed by immunoblotting of the corresponding protein samples using anti-66K and anti-98K antibodies, respectively. As shown in upper panel of Fig 5, lane 3, the WT 98K protein processed the HEL#POL cleavage site efficiently in trans, as evidenced by the disappearance of the 206K precursor and the immunodetection of the mature 66K product. Note that the mature 98K product resulting from cleavage of 206K at the PRO#HEL site (lower panel) is obscured by the 98K produced in trans from pO-98K, but that cleavage activity is evidenced by the disappearance of the 206K precursor. As expected, cleavage of the substrate was inhibited upon mutation of the catalytic C783 residue (lane 4). Interestingly, we observed that all of the mutants assayed-including P866G/P867G and I847D (lanes 5 and 9)-retained the capability to process both the HEL#POL and PRO#HEL cleavage sites, although traces of intermediate cleavage products were occasionally detected.",

Those lesions appeared 1-2 days earlier than those caused by a WT infection, were self-limiting, and were found to restrict systemic viral movement, as evidenced by the absence of symptoms in systemic leaves, as well as the absence of viral RNA progeny (Fig 7B) . The E17-G865A mutant also displayed a peculiar phenotype (Fig 7A, panel d) , as the small local lesions on the inoculated leaves were originally chlorotic and did not appear to restrict systemic viral movement, leading to severe chlorotic symptoms in systemic leaves. However, around 15-17 dpi, the chlorotic areas then became necrotic, leading to tissue desiccation, and to a systemic necrosis phenotype, eventually leading to leaf loss. On the other hand, the symptoms induced by E17-D843A (Fig 7A, panel e) were milder than those caused by a WT infection, the local lesions being less chlorotic, as were the mosaic symptoms appearing on the systemic leaves.",

We also noted the insertion of a loop, directly upstream of the catalytic His869, with a striking 865-GPP-867 motif that is conserved in Tymoviridae-encoded proteins but absent from all other known OTU DUBs. Surprisingly, the two successive prolines in this motif were found to both assume a cis conformation. Here, we show that this loop is mobile, and that when left unengaged by an intermolecular interaction, the two-proline flap is much closer to the other side of the catalytic cleft, occasionally closing the gap and zipping up against the opposite Leu820 and Leu781 (Fig 1, Fig 2A) .",

On the P side, i.e. the side that binds the C-terminus of the Ub moiety to be cleaved, there is a constricted cleft with a conserved tryptophan overhanging the tunnel through which the Ub C-terminal glycines 75-GG-76 thread (Fig 8B and 8C, top) . The tryptophan also connects to the aliphatic part of the residue on the opposite side of the cleft, a residue that is variable among OTU DUBs (I266 in OTUD2 and Q331 in EAV PRO/DUB, Fig 8B and 8C top) , and that comes in sequence right before the catalytic histidine. Such a connection appears much less mobile than the TYMV PRO/DUB GPP flap. Indeed, in all available structures of OTU DUBs except one, the P side constriction is present and changes little, either between different DUBs or between free and Ub-bound enzyme. The exception is the structure of OTUD1, where the tryptophan is flipped out and the cleft consequently exposed. This conformation may reflect a state in which the DUB opens transiently to accommodate the isopeptide bond (and in the case of PRO/DUBs, the endopeptide bond) to be cleaved. At any rate, it seems that the TYMV PRO/DUB hydrophobic zipper substitutes for the stable hydrophobic constriction overhanging the C-terminal 75-GG-76 of ubiquitin in the other OTU DUBs. Thus, GPP flap mobility allows seemingly reversible restoration of the canonical OTU DUB physico-chemical layout on the P side of the catalytic cleft.",

This is in accordance with the requirements for the two endoprotease substrates of TYMV PRO/DUB, i.e. KLNGA# and RLLGS# for HEL#POL and PRO#HEL junctions, respectively [31] , which thus do not match the di-glycine Ub C-terminus. In contrast, other (+)RNA viruses encoding PRO/DUBs evolved endoprotease cleavage sites in their polyproteins that better match the Ub C-terminus. For instance the EAV OTU PRO/DUB putative cleavage site at the nsp2-nsp3 junction is RLIGG# [22] and those of coronaviruses (CoV) PRO/DUBs are LXGG# at the nsp1-2 and nsp2-3 junctions, and IXGG# at the nsp3-4 junction [42, 43] .",

Indeed this is a known form of regulation for cellular DUBs, where a mobile loop may lead to the realignment of the catalytic site residues from an inactive to an active configuration [45] . This regulatory mechanism is best characterized in the cellular DUB USP7, where this mobile loop is accordingly named \"switching loop\", and there brings the catalytic cysteine back towards the catalytic histidine ( S6 Fig). However, despite this similarity, the TYMV PRO/DUB active site is still an outlier among DUBs (Fig 8, S5 Fig and S6 Fig, bottom rows) . Indeed, two elements of the canonical cysteine DUB active site are missing. First, no oxyanion hole is restored in the more closed TYMV PRO/DUB conformations and, consequently, the catalytic cysteine remains unusually exposed on the P' side. Second, the third residue of the papain-like catalytic triad (an aspartate or an asparagine interacting with the catalytic histidine) is also still missing. Consequently, the TYMV PRO/DUB catalytic dyad remains highly dynamic and its side chains are still often misaligned and their crucial H-bond broken (Fig 2A, bottom) . In other cysteine DUBs, that all harbor a third catalytic residue, the catalytic histidine is stabilized thereby. It may still occasionally swing out (e.g. Fig 8B and S5A Fig, bottom right) but this is associated with an inactive configuration, because the histidine then points away from the other two residues of the triad [46] . Thus the peculiarly mobile catalytic dyad of the TYMV PRO/DUB active site may reflect a need to be further stabilized and/or completed by binding of partners. This too is a well known layer of regulation for cellular DUB activity in several DUB families, as in USP7 for instance, the conformational change of the switching loop being triggered by accessory protein domains [47] .",

In turn, mutants interfering with flap closure display phenotypes that are selectively defective in DUB activity. We thus conclude that loop mobility allows alternative recognition of different sequences on the P side, and likely (in)activation of the catalytic site itself. In this scheme, the closed flap conformation is associated with DUB activity, the intermediate conformation with PRO activity, and the open conformation with an inactive PRO/DUB, as borne out by our previous structure of a PRO:PRO complex [21] .",

This may be linked to the fact that the cleaving PRO also uses two other distant patches (borne by its N-terminal lobe) to recognize its substrate, thus possibly making the Ile847 patch less central to recognition of the PRO substrates. In contrast, recognition of Ub mainly involves a single distant patch recognizing the Ub surface centered on Ile44.

While traces of intermediate cleavage products were occasionally detected for 98K mutants in the PRO trans-cleavage assays (Fig 5) , the possible contribution of partially impaired 206K cleavage to the viral replication deficiency was ruled out by the analysis of viral replication proteins produced upon infection (Fig 6C and 6D) , as only fully mature proteins were detected under such conditions. Interestingly, a similar effect of DUB activity impairment on viral RNA accumulation was also observed in whole plants (Fig 7B) . We thus conclude that TYMV DUB activity plays a critical role in the viral RNA replication process, both in single cells and in planta.

It is therefore possible that the defect in TYMV replication upon DUB activity impairment may be linked directly to the decreased stability of the viral polymerase, which would thus become limiting for replication. Alternatively, tuning the ubiquitylation level of the viral polymerase may also contribute to processes other than regulating its stability. In that respect, the (+)RNA tombusviruses were reported to assemble their membrane-bound replication complexes by hijacking ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) complexes [50] , a membrane proteinsorting pathway in which reversible ubiquitylation events of cargo proteins are critical (reviewed in [51, 52] ). Fine tuning of the ubiquitylation level of tombusvirus polymerase appeared important in that process [53] . Whether TYMV DUB activity contributes to the assembly and/or regulation of the membranous spherule-like structures that host the TYMV replication complexes [54] remains to be determined. Finally, it is also conceivable that other, as yet unidentified, substrates of TYMV PRO/DUB may contribute directly or indirectly to the replication deficiency of TYMV DUB mutants.",

One of the most studied mechanism is that of resistance (R) gene-mediated defense responses, also referred to as effector-triggered immunity (ETI) [40, 60] , in which a R protein of the plant specifically senses an effector protein encoded by the pathogen. This specific recognition triggers a range of fast and multilayered defense responses, including massive ion fluxes, production of reactive oxygen species, changes in hormonal balance and a massive reprogramming of genome expression [61] . ETI often culminates with the occurrence of a hypersensitive response (HR), a physiological response manifested by local plant cell death, and containment of the pathogen to the initial infection area [39, 40, 60] . Although systemic necrosis is much less characterized than HR, both responses share similar phenotype and molecular features [62] , and systemic necrosis is thought to be caused by an incomplete resistance, due to late or weak interaction between the R protein and the elicitor, and not sufficiently strong to restrict virus propagation [63] .",

On one hand, the D843A mutant, whose flap was shown to stabilize in a \"closed\" conformation more frequently than the WT, led to milder symptoms. On the other hand, the P866G/P867G and G865A mutants, which both appeared unable to properly close their hydrophobic zipper and remained in an \"open\" or \"half-open\" position, led to rapid or delayed necrosis, respectively. Therefore, the appearance of necrotic symptoms upon inoculation of those two mutants may relate to the existence in plant cells of a R protein specifically detecting the \"open\" conformation of the GPP loop, whose sensing of the P866G/P867G mutant would be strong enough to induce HR and restrict the infection to the viral entry point, whereas part-time or weaker interactions with G865A would induce a delayed systemic necrosis. Transition from HR to systemic necrosis upon point mutation of a viral protein has indeed previously been reported [64] . At present, we also cannot rule out the possibility that other processes than HR-related responses may be involved in the appearance of necrotic lesions, such as the involvement of a general stress response possibly linked to toxicity of the mutant viral proteins, or a premature senescence pathway in response to viral infection. Future experiments will aim at characterizing those processes in more details.",

Determining the possible links between TYMV DUB and plant signaling cascades involved in antiviral immunity is an interesting question that the tools developed in the frame of this study will allow us to investigate in the future. Indeed, the TYMV mutants described herein, in which PRO and DUB activities are uncoupled, provide excellent tools for further study of the role of DUB in viral pathogenicity. Searching for additional substrates/partners of TYMV PRO/DUB, as well as system-wide analysis of the transcriptomics or ubiquitylation networks that are linked to viral infection can now be envisaged both at the cellular and whole plant level, which should help clarify the possibly ambivalent role that reversible ubiquitylation events may play during viral life cycles, being either a viral strategy to enhance infectivity, or a host defense reaction, or a combination of both [15] . We expect such studies to provide mechanistic insights into the complexity of virus infection but also to reveal how these mechanisms could be exploited to target pathogenic viruses.",

Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.25 or 0.5 mM, and the cultures were grown at 18\u02daC for 16h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in PBS buffer and harvested again. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 350 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml Lysozyme, and 1 U/ml Benzonase). The mixture was then incubated at 4\u02daC under gentle agitation for 60 min. Lysis was completed by 5 freeze/thaw cycles (70 K/303 K). The mixture was then centrifuged at 35000 \u00d7 g for 30 min or 24000 x g for 1h at 4\u02daC to remove insoluble cell debris. The supernatant was purified at 4\u02daC by affinity chromatography using a pre-packed 5 mL His-trap column (GE-Healthcare). The column was first equilibrated with buffer A (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 350 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT). The supernatant was loaded into the column at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The column was washed with 50 mL of buffer A, followed by 10 mL of washing buffer A1 (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.0, 350 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT). The protein was eluted using elution buffer B (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 350 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 1 mM DTT). Fractions were analyzed on 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE, and those containing PRO/DUB were concentrated using a centrifugal filter device with a 3 kDa cut-off. The concentrated fraction (usually 500 \u03bcl) was further purified at 4\u02daC through a high-resolution Superdex S-75 gel filtration column (GE-Healthcare) with Buffer C (10 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 350 mM Ammonium Acetate, 1mM DTT) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Fractions were analyzed on 16.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE, and those containing purified PRO/DUB were concentrated.

Briefly, as before, TYMV PRO/DUB \u0394C5 and I847A single crystals were obtained by seeding from multiple microcrystals initially obtained for I847A. Microseeding was performed in hanging drops prepared from equal volumes of protein solution in buffer 0.01 M Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.35 M ammonium acetate, 1 mM DTT and reservoir solution. The reservoir solution was composed of 0.1 M trisodium citrate pH 5.6, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, 15%-19%(w/v) PEG 4000, 5%(v/v) MPD. Crystals were transferred for~5 min in well solution supplemented with 5 mM DTT. Subsequently, the crystals were transferred for~1 min in well solution supplemented with a mixture of cryoprotectants, as described [77] . For \u0394C5, this was cryomix C5 (final concentrations of cryoprotectants 5% diethylene glycol, 10% ethylene glycol, 5% MPD, 5% 1,2-propanediol, 5% glycerol, 5 mM NDSB-201) and for I847A C6 (5% ethylene glycol, 10% MPD, 5% 1,2-propanediol, 5% DMSO, 5% glycerol). Hence, both cryoprotecting solutions contained significant amounts of sulfur-containing compounds (NDSB-201 and DMSO, respectively). Crystals were flashcooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen. Data were collected on synchrotron SOLEIL beamline Proxima1 and processed with XDS [78] .",

Relative quantities of cDNAs were calculated and normalized as described [91, 92] . According to previous validation analyses [93] , the Arabidopsis reference genes chosen to normalize data from protoplast samples were EF1\u03b1 (At5g60390) and PDF2 (At1g13320). In the case of plant samples, the abundance of viral RNAs precluded the use of PDF2, and the reference genes chosen to normalize data were EF1\u03b1 and 18S rRNA as previously described [94] . Replicate samples with a quantification cycle value (Cq) differing from the mean Cq value by more than 2 units were considered as outliers and were excluded from the calculation. Data relative to mutant transcripts were then expressed as a percentage of the mean value of the data obtained with WT transcripts that were transfected or inoculated simultaneously and analyzed by qPCR in the same run (S1 Dataset).
