            "text": "Duck viral enteritis (DVE) is an acute, contagious herpesvirus infection of ducks, geese, and swans of all ages and species. This disease has been responsible for significant economic losses in domestic and wild waterfowl as a result of mortality, and decreased egg production. Resveratrol is a naturally occurring phytoalexin in specific plants and exhibits inhibitory activity against many kinds of virus. In this paper, resveratrol was found to inhibit duck enteritis virus (DEV) replication in a dose-dependent manner, with a 50% inhibition concentration of 3.85 mg/mL. The inhibition in virus multiplication in the presence of resveratrol was not attributed to direct inactivation or inhibition of virus attachment to the host cells, but to the inhibition of viral multiplication in host cells. The assay of the time of addition limited the drug effect during the first 8 h of infection. This conclusion was supported by the ultrastructure images of the early stage of DEV infection, which showed that the replication of virus nucleic acid and the formation of the capsid in the cell nucleus were suppressed. In the indirect immunofluorescence assay, proteins expression in DEV infected duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) within 24 h post-infection (p.i.) was also effectively suppressed by resveratrol. In summary, the resveratrol has a good activity against DEV infection in vitro, which could be attributed to that fact that several essential immediate early viral proteins for virus replication were impacted by resveratrol.",

This compound has been shown to possess high bioactivities against many diseases, such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, diabetes and viral diseases. In several studies, resveratrol was found to increase the potency of several antiretroviral drugs synergistically against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [10] and herpes simplex viruses (HSV) [11] . Resveratrol was also found to be effective in treating influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARA) [12] .

In traditional antiviral research, the antiviral activities of test samples were confirmed mainly based on their capability to reduce virus titer or inhibit the CPE. Whether the multiplication of virus particles is influenced is unclear. Real-time FQ-PCR based on TaqMan technology, which was performed in this paper, provides an accurate means to quantify viral DNA. Based on this technology, the amount of the virus in cell cultures could be accurately detected at any point in time. In our research, DEV particles began to reproduce 12 h after inoculation and dramatically increased to a peak value at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 3) . The growth curve reported in this paper is almost consistent with the result of Guo's [36] . Thus, the influence of resveratrol on the multiplication of DEV in DEFs was analyzed. DNA proliferation was not detected until 24 h p.i. under treatment with resveratrol and the proliferation was maintained at a low level until the end of the test (Fig. 3) . This result indicates that resveratrol could inhibit the stage of virus intracellular proliferations. The conclusion of the growth curve assay was further evidenced by the assays for mode of action. In these series of experiments, resveratrol could not inactivate the virus in extracellular and also did not show any significant inhibitory effect during the stage of attachment and entry into the host cell. The inhibitory effect was only observed in the intracellular inhibition assay (Fig. 4) .",

The time of addition study in this paper demonstrated that the resveratrol affected the early stage of the DEV replication cycle (within 8 h p.i.) (Fig. 5) . For the alphaherpesvirinae subfamily of herpesviridae, virus replication and package all occur in the host cell's nucleus, in which the genomes of the virus are translated, and some early viral proteins are expressed for further transcription and replication of the viral DNA, then a new virus DNA is synthesized and viral structural proteins are produced; late in the infection, replicated DNAs are packaged into capsids [37] . According to this reference, the early stage of DEV replication might occur in the host cell's nucleus. Thus, we can assume that the process of DEV replication in the host cell's nucleus was inhibited by resveratrol. The TEM photos gave evidence that support the hypothesis that a large number of virus nucleic acids and virus capsids did not observed in the host cell's nucleus compared with the control group (Fig. 6) . Similar TEM photos of the DEV infected DEFs were shown in the references [36] , [38] . The results of the time of addition assay and the TEM assays locate the antiviral target of the test drug in an early stage of the virus cycle occurs in the host cell's nucleus, which further provide evidence that support the conclusion of the assay on mode of action and further limited the scope of antiviral targets to the host cell's nucleus.",

Galindo et al. reported that resveratrol could inhibit DNA of ASFV replication, late viral protein synthesis and viral factory formation [27] . In our investigation, after incubation for 24 h, protein expression in DEV infected DEFs was effectively inhibited by resveratrol (Fig. 7) .

The media was removed and replaced with drug-free media. DEV suspended without drug was used as control (effect of temperature). (2) Inhibition of virus attachment: DEFs were infected in media containing the drug and virus for 1 h at 37uC, and then the mixture was removed. The cells were overlaid with drug-free media. (3) Pre-treatment effect: DEFs were pre-treatment with drug for 1 h at 37uC. And then DEV was added to the cells after resveratrol solution removal. After 1 h 37uC, the inoculum was removed and replaced with drug-free media. (4) Intracellular inhibition: after removing the unabsorbed virus, the media containing the resveratrol was added to the DEFs. At 48 h p.i., the total DNA was extracted from DEV-infected DEFs and copies of DEV were evaluated by the real-time FQ-PCR assay. Values are means 6 SD (n = 3).

Total DNA was extracted at the indicated time points(2,4,6,8,10,12,24, 48, and 72 h p.i.) and the copies of DEV were detected by the real-time FQ-PCR assay. The copies of DEV were calculated according to the standard curve equations: Ct = 23.3286lg [virus copies/5.25]+40.138 (R 2 = 0.997)",
