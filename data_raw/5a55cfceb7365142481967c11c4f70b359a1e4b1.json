The first infected patient was assumed to belong to the general population. We assumed that his/her symptoms appear on O 1 = February 15, 2003, and he/she is admitted to hospital on A 1 = February 22, 2003. Furthermore, we assumed that he/she dies from SARS (d 1 = 1). The time \u03bd 1 when the patient becomes infectious was sampled from a uniform distribution on {O 1 \u2212 1, . . . , O 1 + 4}. His/her time of contamination was then chosen as \u03c9 1 = \u03bd 1 \u2212 5. The duration of infectious period for the first case was drawn from a uniform distribution in {0, . . . , X}, where X was sampled from the gamma distribution with mean and standard deviation (m, q). The patient's duration of hospital stay was drawn from a gamma distribution with mean and standard deviation as in the dataset. The number n C t+1 of new category-C individuals infected on day t + 1 was drawn from a binomial distribution with parameters S C t and p C t where [1] :",

The probability \u03c0 gp that a case would die was estimated as the observed mortality rate among patients in the general population : \u03c0 gp = 0.1308. Similarly, the probability of dying was given by \u03c0 hp = 0.3977 for nosocomial SARS cases and by \u03c0 hw = 0.0228 for a healthcare worker. For all i = 1, . . . , n C t , category C patient i had a probability \u03c0 C of dying. If the patient would not die (d i = 0), the duration of the infectious period was drawn from the gamma distribution with mean and standard deviation (m, q). If the patient would die (d i = 1), a number X was drawn from the gamma distribution with mean and standard deviation (m, q) ; then, the duration of the infectious period was drawn from a uniform distribution on {0, . . . , X} to take into account the potential reduction of infectious period caused by death. The time of the first symptoms was drawn from a uniform distribution in {\u03bd i \u2212 4, . . . , \u03bd i + 1} . For all non nosocomial cases, the time from symptom onset to hospital admission was drawn from a gamma distribution, with parameters depending on the time of symptom onset, taken from Donnelly et al. [2] . For nosocomial cases, the admission time was arbitrarily chosen as November 5, 2002. The time of discharge from hospital was Y days after symptoms onset, where Y was sampled from the dataset.",
