Probably structural information alone will not be sufficient to define antigenic distances due to the challenges in structural modeling. It is well known the results from structural modeling for single mutation are no more than 70% (e.g. Modeller). Without the details, it will be difficult to believe such structural information alone will be useful for influenza antigenicity measurement, for which a single mutation can lead to antigenic drift. In addition, within a single antigenic drift event, it is not uncommon that the mutations occur in one or more epitope. The current methods seem to only target a single epitope, and this does not seem to be realistic in influenza study. 2. It will be useful and critical for the authors to illustrate the changes of epitope \"fingerprints\" in the past four decades. Can these results match those antigenic drift events, which have been well characterized? 3. The authors claimed they collected the HI data from various sources for H3N2 data from 1969 to 2013. There is a long list of sources in the Supplementary Note. It is not clear how many HI tables are actually included? How these data are integrated into their analyses? As we know, the HI data from those listed sources were performed at different time, different lab, and different protocols, especially with different red blood cells. Thus, it is difficult to believe validation results using these datasets will be meaningful. The datasets shall be provided to be available to the users. 4. Even the authors claimed that ConH3 is broadly protective, the experimental results suggest that ConH3 only had high cross activities with one testing strain but not others. Because the authors did not enclose the sequences of ConH3, I can not know the details but it seems that ConH3 sequence could be designed from that particular strain. In addition, it is not common to use mice to characterize influenza antigenicity. 5. There are many publications related to epitope comparison using 3D structures. I would suggest the authors review those literatures and discuss the limitations of current studies and how this can be improved. 6. I would suggest the authors focus on influenza viruses. Many statements in this manuscript were either overstated or confusing. For example, the first statement in the summary statement was confusing.",

            "text": "1. The authors claimed that CE-BLAST could compare the antigenic similarity of any protein antigens and generalize for all protein antigens. But, It looks like the method is more suitable for mutated antigens with one dominant conformation epitope, while not for general protein antigens pair. One protein antigen may have more than one epitopes. If the method is used to evaluate the antigenic similarity of two proteins, all potential epitope pairs need to be compared and summarized. Thus, the authors could point out the usage conditions and boundaries of their method clearly. 2. For the scarcity of immune cross-reactivity data, the sequence similarity of the variable (V) regions of antibodies were used a measurement of antigenicity similarity. However, the authors did not present more evidence for the reasonability of using V-regions. Could the authors show if there is a high correlation between the sequence similarity of the variable (V) regions of antibodies and the antigenic variation of antigens, such as, influenza HA proteins. 3. There are several parameters in the CE-BLAST algorithm, such as, the \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 in the formula (1). I'm curious how these parameters are determined if there is no training dataset? 4. According to the description, two classes of features were used in the algorithm, including local structural and physicochemical fingerprints. The performance of the final model was tested and shown in the manuscript, while the contributions of each feature was not shown. To be more solid, it could be better to test the contribution of each feature and to show its necesity in the method. 5. The key idea of the CE-BLAST algorithm is to predict the antigenic similarity or variation based on the conformational structure and physicochemical fingerprints. As far as I know, there is method EADpred, published in a paper named \"Correlation of Influenza Virus Excess Mortality with Antigenic Variation: Application to Rapid Estimation of Influenza Mortality Burden\", had the similar idea. It's better to discuss the similarity and difference between your algorithm and that method. 6. Please provide more details for your designed HA sequence \"Con H3\". Such as, the sequence of the antigenic sites in \"Con H3\", and the comparisons between the \"Con H3\" and the seven reference strains. Also, you'd better to analyze or discuss the molecular mechanism of crossreactivity of \"Con H3\" against FJ02, WI05 and BR07 strains.",

In other words, there are known epitopes, but no assays. It is not self-evident that sequence similarity of variable regions is well correlated with the antigenic similarity of their respective epitopes. This really needs to be established -indeed, there must be many contrary examples (e.g. single mutations leading to antigenic escape; non-contact residues in the variable region that have a negligible impact on antigenicity when substituted; different antibodies binding to more-or-less the same epitope using different binding modes). These potential complications need to be addressed as well as their implications for the robustness of the validation.",

In CE-BLAST, a series of physic-chemical fingerprints beside structure information were added as a complement to evaluate the antigenic distance. Incorporating additional information will be explored in future version of CE-BLAST. Meanwhile, we tested the potential influence on antigenic distance for modeled structures comparing to crystalized structures, taking HA as an example. It can be found that the classification results show full agreement between modeled structures and experimental ones, indicating the feasibility of CE-BLAST on modeled protein structures. The detailed results are illustrated as below: a) In total, 24 HA crystal structures (Group C) in PDB were collected for the available 1725 HA sequences in our dataset. Their corresponding modeled structures (Group M) were obtained following the same protocols in our study. b) Pair-wised antigenic distance was calculated via CE-BLAST using default parameters for structures within group C, within group M (intra-group distance), and between Group G and Group M (inter-group distance) respectively. The results can be found in Figure R1 . It can be seen that, the classification results shows 100% agreement between both crystalized-modeled structures and modeled-modeled structures, indicating that using modeled structures shows little influence on CE-BLAST results.

However, in the case of HA antigen, all the whole neighboring areas of the 16 sites are actually taken into account, which cover the full length of 330 residues in HA1 under default parameters. In this sense, CE-BLAST can detect the antigenic distance caused by any mutations in whole HA1 protein. Here in this paper, we take 16 sites to calculate fingerprints instead of full length, because of their different contribution to antigenicity variance. Meanwhile, selecting representative sites to calculate fingerprints can significantly reduce the computational load.",

Firstly, we calculated the antigenic distance between all strains in each year to the dominant strain of previous year according to chronological order, then we define a new antigenic cluster if the antigenicity coverage of a new antigenic variant within current year is substantially large, comparing to the dominant strain of its previous year. The dominant strain of first year (1968) was set as A/Hong Kong/1/1968. Then the dominant strain in following year was identified as either the one with the largest antigenicity coverage within the year if no antigenic variants emerge, or the antigenic variant with the largest antigenicity coverage of that year. Details can be found in method part of CE-BLAST based antigenic clustering algorithm. CE-BLAST was used to construct an antigenic map for 16,672 historical HA proteins to determine the antigenic clusters of influenza A/H3N2 from 1968 to 2014 (Fig 4) .

Antigenically similar years were grouped into antigenic clusters represented by the first dominant strain in the beginning year of each cluster (cluster representative strain).

In addition, an additional antigenic group, represented by HK82 (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) , was detected by our method. Although the experimental screening didn't detect this cluster, Du's study of large-scale antigenicity mapping 2 pointed out its existence.

Accordingly, the classification results of CE-BLAST achieved AUC value of 0.857, 0.894 and 0.899 respectively on the 1072 data (Figure-Response5) . Secondly, the experimental antigenicity between DENV strains was mapped into Figure 5A -B by MDS method 1 after data cleaning and normalization (See ONLINE METHOD section). The overall antigenicity distance showed that serotype 1 is the closest to serotype 4 whereas serotype 2 is the furthest from the others. The topologies of antigenic clustering between those 47 strains were next examined and illustrated in Figure 5C according to CE-BLAST scores.

For instance, a tool which just looked at the date differences of isolates being compared, and assessed antigenic similarity based on the number of years separating the samples might do quite well if it did not need to offer a \"direct association\" with serology due to the strong antigenic drift observed in H3N2 (though I'm not suggesting that anything that crude would do as well as this tool).",

            "text": "To further test the generality of CE-BLAST toward newly emerged pathogens, the antisera data of DENV were collected from a large-scale study on the African green monkey 6 . In this cited study, 36 sera samples derived from monkeys injected with corresponding vaccine strains were tested individually against 47 DENV strains of four different serotypes. After removing un-interpretable data with undone and self-reactive titers <10, the remained titer data of 1072 strain pairs were included as our validation set. We modeled 47 E protein structures for CE-BLAST according to the sequences provided in the paper 6 . Unlike for influenza, no empirical titer threshold has been reported as being able to classify antigenic similarity or variance for DENV cases. According to the statistics on available data 6 , the titer value of over 90% of self-reactive pairs was over 20. Thus, three different values of 15, 20, and 40 were tentatively chosen as classification thresholds for further testing. Accordingly, the classification results of CE-BLAST achieved AUC values of 0.857, 0.894, and 0.899, respectively, on the 1072 strain pairs. Next, the antigenic grouping results of CE-BLAST were compared with that from classical sequence similarity and structure similarity based on experimental serological topology. Fig. 4a-b show the serological topology of experimental grouping between DENV strains by the multidimensional scaling (MDS) method 18 after data cleaning and normalization (Online Method). It could be observed that serotype 1 clusters closely with serotype 4 whereas serotype 2 clusters the furthest from the remainder. In Fig. 4c of the CE-BLAST results, the four serotypes of DENV could be correctly predicted and clustered. In comparison to grouping topology, serotype 1 was first clustered with serotype 4, whereas serotype 2 is the furthest from the remaining strains, which fully matches with the experimental topology ( Fig.4a-b) . However, in sequence-based clustering of Fig. 4d , serotype 1 was first clustered with serotype 3, followed by serotype 2 and last with serotype 4, which disagrees with the experimental results. Neither could the structure method achieve the correct topology for DENV subtypes, as displayed in Fig. 4e .",

Our prediction is strongly corroborated by experimental results from either one-month or three-month post-infection sera. The titer value of DENV1-V1937 vs. DENV1-T16007 is the highest among all pairs between DENV1-V1937 and the 47 tested strains, followed by DENV1-M61117 with the second highest titer values, indicating the close antigenicity between DENV1-V1937 and DENV1-T16007. In contrast, neither sequence-based nor structure-based methods could suggest the best serological relationship within DENV subtypes, as being displayed in Fig. 4d-e .

ZIKV is a member of the Flavivirus family, which recently emerged from Brazil and quickly became a significant public health concern. Evidence shows that ZIKV infections may lead to neurological complications such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults 20 and micocephaly in newborns 1 . Several reports discovered that the antibodies isolated from patients with dengue had the potential to cross-react with ZIKV 21,22 . As the main target of neutralizing antibodies, the E protein was reported to share high structural similarity with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.1 \u00c5 and overall sequence identity of 53.9% between ZIKV and DENV 23 .",

Then, the surface patches of ZIKV were compared with the corresponding patches in DENV subtypes through CE-BLAST. Potential cross-reactive patches (CRPs) were marked when their similarity scores rose above a certain threshold. The frequency of CRP labelled by the center residue was mapped onto a heat map resulting from binary comparison between 4 ZIKV and 4 DENV structures, as shown in Fig. 5a , with different rows representing DENV subtypes. Additional results can be found in Supplementary Fig. 3 and 4 . Although the in-silico cross-reactivity frequency could vary among different subtypes of DENV, strongly consistent CRPs in domain II and additionally weak CRPs in domain I could be detected across DENV subtypes (Fig. 5a3) .

It would be difficult to image this field strain can generate a broad protective spectrum. The authors may need to understand an influenza virus can cross react with those viruses which are circulated before or after this virus. For example, the H3N2 viruses in 2007 could have cross activities (to different extents) with those viruses in 2004 and 2009. The results showed that the sera from ConH3 had a titer of 12,150 against WI05, 2786 against BR07, 2111 against FJ02, and not for MO99. Thus, this result suggested that the ConH3 is most likely designed from a strain and would be expected to have similar immunity to this strain. In summary, the broad protective spectrum for ConH3 is not convincing.Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author): I have studied the revised version of the manuscript, with particular emphasis on the reasonable measurement of antigenicity similarity and features' contribution in the model. Given the renewed descriptions and results, I am now convinced of the reasonability of their methodology. I do no have any more comments.

How this model will be useful?The authors added computational performance for influenza antigenic variants prediction in this revision. The predicting accuracy were up to 90% but earlier ones were less than 40%. The variations of the results were surprising because the authors said their method is a unsupervised method. The descriptions on how the comparisons were performed were too sketchy.1) What exactly are the data used in the experiments? Do the authors used the same data in previously publications?2) How the performance were evaluated?3) The data and results should be provided along with this manuscript. The description on data in the supplementary data do not make sense at all. The authors should provide the exact sequence and serological data used in the studies.Reviewer #4 (Remarks to the Author):The authors have gone to great lengths to address the issues raised in my initial review, introducing three new sections to the paper. These substantially change my ability to assess how well the technique works.They compare CE-BLAST to three published techniques, one of their own and two others, for determining antigenic similarity that use serological data. The comparison paints CE-BLAST in a very favourable light. I might have chosen other more sophisticated techniques, but these would have been significantly harder for the authors to reproduce, and my main concern in my earlier review was to see that this structure/physicochemical-property-based technique was not substantially behind the state-of-the-art for these other classes of model. I am reassured to see that, to the contrary, the technique seems to do as well or better than their selected comparators in this case. AUC for match/mismatch assessment is something that I have not often seen before, with the techniques I am familiar with tending to examine mean absolute error of titre predictions (which itself has drawbacks), but since the technique under review does not directly estimate titre, this seems like a reasonable alternative.They then demonstrate the ability of the tool to identify antigenically similar viruses, which straightforward phylogenetic, sequence-based and structural alignment tools are unable to recognise. These two examples -between Dengue subtypes and between Dengue and Zika virusare well outside my area of expertise, but seem to be very positive for the utility of the tool. However, the highlighted comparison between 3 viruses within DENV1 seems somewhat arbitrary, given that we do not know if other viruses are further apart in the CE-BLAST clustering than the serology would suggest.Nonetheless, and despite the absence of experimental work such as reverse genetics to demonstrate the causal link between predictions and outcome, these results collectively address my concerns about the validity of the tool for identifying antigenically important changes and similarities between epitopes, and in particular as a tool-of-last-resort when no serological data exists, or possibly of first resort before such data is generated.It's important to note that I remain unfamiliar with any details of structural modelling in general (beyond a professional interest), for instance I still don't understand what a spin-image is, I'm afraid to say, and am unable to comment on the reasonableness or indeed validity of the underlying techniques being proposed. I was also again disappointed that the tool itself is not available online despite this being advertised in the abstract -this is something that must be addressed before publication, along with some mechanism for assuring it will remain accessible, as it would have been much easier to get to grips with this by \"playing\" with the tool a bit. However, within those (significant) limitations, I am now happy that the manuscript is suitable for publication.Note that the manuscript is still in need of proof-reading and editing. For instance, it would be good if CE-BLAST itself was spelt correctly throughout(!); I'm not sure the opening sentence of the abstract still connects to the rest of the manuscript as well as it did; a clearer explanation of the spin-image would be extremely useful; Finally, I think the revised title is inappropriate, or at least the use of the term \"precisely\". While I am happy that CE-BLAST can compute antigenic similarity, I would reserve \"precisely\" for the ability to actually estimate the antigenic distance in terms of titre of some other precisely quantifiable measure.",

In that case, those symbols were not marked in Fig 4a-b. finally some sentences especially in the discussion don't read very well, describing the technique as unique is unnecessary, and using PTM as an acronym without explanation.The final sentence was modified as follows:' Subsequent improvements will be further elaborated on Post-translational modification (PTM) antigens, parallel computing, and refined models that are tailor-made for specific proteins. ' Finally, I think the revised title is inappropriate, or at least the use of the term \"precisely\". While I am happy that CE-BLAST can compute antigenic similarity, I would reserve \"precisely\" for the ability to actually estimate the antigenic distance in terms of titre of some other precisely quantifiable measure.Thank you for pointing this out, we deleted the word and modified the title as follows: ' CE-BLAST: Making it possible to compute antigenic similarity for newly emerging pathogens '",
