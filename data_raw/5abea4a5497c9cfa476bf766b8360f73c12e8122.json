            "text": "In response to viral infection, the expression of numerous host genes, including predominantly a number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, is usually up-regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels. It was noted that in cells infected with coronavirus, transcription and translation of some of these genes were differentially induced. Drastic induction of their expression at the transcriptional level was observed in cells infected with coronavirus. However, induction of the same genes at the translational level was usually found to be minimal to moderate. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out using SARS-CoV proteins as baits, revealing that a subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), eIF3f, may interact with the N-terminal region of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. Meanwhile, parallel experiments confirmed that eIF3f could also interact with the S protein of another coronavirus, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). These interactions led to the inhibition of translation of a reporter gene in both in vitro expression system and intact cells. Interestingly, IBV-infected cells stably expressing a Flag-tagged eIF3f showed much higher translation of IL-6 and IL-8, suggesting that the interaction between coronavirus S protein and eIF3f plays a functional role in controlling the expression of host genes, especially genes that are induced during coronavirus infection cycles. This study reveals a novel mechanism exploited by coronavirus to regulate viral pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Activation and induction of host gene expression at both transcriptional and translational levels by virus infection constitute essential steps in host anti-viral response and viral pathogenesis. As one of the major factors that causes tissue damage and viral pathogenesis, induction and over-production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are a common phenomenon in many viral infections [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . However, it was frequently observed that the expression of these genes was differentially up-regulated at the transcriptional and translational levels in cells infected with a certain virus. For example, in cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and in sera from SARS patients, significant up-regulation of the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as CCL1, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCL9, CXCL10, IL-6, IL10 and IL12, was reported [5, [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, only a moderate increase of the expression of these genes at the protein level was detected [8] [9] . This differential up-regulation of the host gene expression at transcriptional and translational levels may simply reflect the relative capacity of host transcription and translation machinery in the infected cells. Alternatively, it would consist of a convenient and clever viral strategy to counteract host cell anti-viral response, as over-production of these host proteins is usually harmful to viruses. In this study, we show a novel mechanism exploited by coronavirus to regulate the translation of virus-induced genes at late stages of the virus infection cycle.",

In coronavirus-infected cells, a 39coterminal nested set of six to nine mRNA species, including the genome-length mRNA (mRNA1) and five to eight subgenomic mRNA species (mRNA2-9), is expressed. The genome-length mRNA1 encodes two overlapping replicase proteins in the form of polyproteins 1a and 1a/b, which are processed by virus-encoded proteinases into at least 16 putative nonstructural proteins (NSP1-NSP16) [13] [14] [15] . The four major structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), are encoded by different subgenomic mRNAs. In addition, several accessory proteins are also encoded by subgenomic mRNAs [15] . In coronavirus-infected cells, no obvious inhibition of host protein synthesis was observed at least at early stages of the virus infection cycle.",

            "text": "Viruses rely on the canonical cellular translation machinery to translate their own RNAs. This would facilitate the rapid production of viral proteins and meanwhile, render inhibitory effect on the production of host proteins including host anti-viral proteins [16] . In fact, viruses may inhibit host protein synthesis by targeting multiple steps in the gene expression process via various vices. For instance, vesicular stomatitis virus M protein inhibits the initiation of transcription of host genes [17] [18] [19] [20] , while adenovirus encodes VA RNA, a small highly structured RNA that competitively binds to the dsRNA-binding site of the doublestrand RNA activated kinase (PKR) and prevents its activation [21] . The majority of control over cellular mRNA translation, however, occurs at the initiation stage, the rate-limiting step of protein synthesis for many RNA viruses [22] [23] . Translation initiation begins with binding of the initiator Met-tRNA i to the 40S ribosomal subunit. This is facilitated by the formation of a eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2)/GTP/Met-tRNA i ternary complex and a subsequent 43S preinitiation complex. Viruses could inhibit cellular protein synthesis by targeting and inactivating components of the initiation complex. One well studied example is the picornaviral 2A proteinase which cleaves the initiation factor eIF4G within its N-terminal region containing the binding site for eIF4E and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) [24] [25] [26] [27] . The cleaved C-terminal region of eIF4G could be associated with eIF3 and eFI4A, binds with higher affinity to viral mRNAs and facilitates translation of its own protein [26, 28] .",

During the course of studying the gene expression profiles in cells infected with coronaviruses, it was noted that drastic induction of many virus-inducible genes occurred at the transcriptional level. However, induction of the same genes at the translational level was found to be usually minimal to moderate. To search for cellular proteins that are involved in protein synthesis and may interact with coronavirus proteins, yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out using different coronavirus proteins as baits. This screening led to the identification of eIF3f that could potentially interact with the N-terminal portion (SDC) of the SARS-CoV S protein. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to further test the interaction between SDC and eIF3f. To facilitate detection of the two proteins, SDC was tagged with a Myc tag and eIF3f with a Flag tag at the N-termini, respectively. Analysis of HeLa cells expressing the Myc-tagged SDC either on its own or together with the Flag-tagged eIF3f by Western blot with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody led to efficient detection of the Myc-tagged SDC (Fig. 1a, Similar experiments were then performed to check if the fulllength SARS-CoV S protein could also interact with eIF3f. As shown in Fig. 1b , efficient detection of the full-length S protein was obtained in cells expressing S protein either on its own or together with the Flag-tagged eIF3f by Western blot with anti-S polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 1b, top panel, lanes 1 and 3) . Analysis of cells expressing the Flag-tagged eIF3f either on its own or together with S protein by Western blot with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody showed presence of the Flag-tagged eIF3f (Fig. 1b , second panel, lanes 2 and 3). Immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates with anti-S antibodies and subsequent analysis of the precipitates by Western blot with anti-S antibodies detected the S protein in cells expressing the protein either on its own or together with the Flag-tagged eIF3f (Fig. 1b, third panel, lanes 1 and 3) . Western blot analysis of the same precipitates with anti-Flag antibody showed presence of the Flag-tagged eIF3f only in cells co-expressing the two proteins (Fig. 1b, bottom panel, lane 3) . These results confirm that the fulllength S protein can also interact with eIF3f.",

At 24 hours post transfection, cells were lysed and aliquoted. A portion of the lysates was used for luciferase assay while another was used for Western blot analysis of the protein expression. Expression of S protein could substantially inhibit the luciferase expression (Fig.3b,  lane 2) , whereas the empty vector alone did not cause any inhibition (Fig. 3b, lane 3) . Quantitative analysis of the inhibitory effect by measuring the luciferase activity showed that in cells transfected with Luc+empty vector, the relative luciferase activity is 1936 light units, which are 37-fold higher than that in cells transfected with Luc+S. Northern blot analysis confirmed that approximately equal amounts of luciferase mRNA were detected in cells transfected with luciferase together either with an empty vector or the S construct (Fig. 3b, lanes  4 and 5) .",

It was reasoned that in cells transfected with IBV S(EP3), expression of the S protein would be inhibited after the protein synthesis reaches to a certain level, as the S protein already synthesized would bind to eIF3.5, leading to the inhibition of translation and a lower level of S protein synthesis. On the contrary, in cells transfected with IBV S(p65), these initially transfected cells would fuse with the neighboring cells after the S protein expression reaches to a certain level and the eIF3.5 factor present in these neighboring cells would offset the inhibitory effect of the S protein, resulting in a higher level of S protein synthesis. As expected, no cell-cell fusion was observed in cells expressing IBV S(EP3) at 6, to 12 hours post-infection (Fig. 5a) . In cells expressing IBV S(p65), small syncytial cells were observed at 8 hours post-infection (Fig. 5a) . Giant syncytial cells were observed on almost the whole monolayer at 10 to 12 hours post-infection (Fig. 5a) . Western blot analysis showed that slightly more S protein was observed in cells expressing S(EP3) construct at 6 hours post-infected, compared to cells expressing S(p65) construct (Fig. 5b, lanes 1 and 5) . At 8 hours post-infection, approximately equal amounts of S protein were detected in cells expressing both constructs (Fig. 5b, lanes 2 and 6) . Much more S protein was detected in cells expressing S(p65) than did in cells expressing S(EP3) at 10 and 12 hours post-infection (Fig. 5b , lanes 3, 4, 7 and 8). As a loading control, very similar amounts of the btubulin were detected in samples (Fig. 5b) .

These results confirm that stable expression of the Flag-tagged eIF3f could offset the inhibitory effect of S protein on the translation of virus-inducible genes.",

These cytokines and chemokines could promote inflammation by induction of acute cell and tissue injury. Understanding the cellular and viral mechanisms that regulate the induction of these molecules at the transcriptional and translational levels would be essential for understanding the pathogenesis of coronavirus. In this study, the S protein of SARS-CoV and IBV was shown to interact with the initiation factor eIF-3f, leading to the inhibition of general protein synthesis. As the inhibition occurs at late stages of the virus replication cycle, the main effect would be on the translation of virus-induced transcripts, including predominantly proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This inhibition may therefore play an important role in regulation of the pathogenesis of coronavirus.",

The IL-6 mRNA was significantly upregulated in SARS-CoV-infected dendritic cells [5] . However, only slight increase of IL-6 at the protein level was detected in the serum of SARS patients [9] . In addition, Tseng et al. [34] also reported that IL-6 protein only increased two fold in macrophages and dendritic cells infected SARS-CoV.

The inhibitory effect appears to be general, as the synthesis of both viral and cellular proteins can be affected. However, as accumulation of the S protein to a certain level in the virus-infected cells is a prerequisite for the inhibition, it would be effective only at late stages of viral infection. This would be largely beneficial to the virus. At this stage, the viral RNA replication and protein synthesis in a given infected cell are nearly complete, inhibition of viral protein synthesis would render little effect on viral production and subsequent infection of neighboring cells. On the contrary, inhibition of host protein synthesis, especially the translation of virus-induced transcripts which are accumulated at very high concentration at this stage, would dramatically reduce the production of protein products from these genes. As most of these products are proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, synthesis and secretion of these products would cause inflammatory response, sensitize the neighboring cells as well as causing cell death. The most direct consequence of these cell/tissue responses anti-Flag antibody. The same membrane was also probed with anti-actin antibodies as a loading control. b. Analysis of viral RNA replication and protein synthesis in IBV-infected stable cells clones with high expression of eIF3f (+eIF3f) (lanes 1-5) and undetectable expression of eIF3f (-eIF3f) (lanes 6-10). The two stable Vero cell clones were infected with IBV at a multiplicity of infection of 2 and harvested at 0, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours post-infection. Ten micrograms of total RNA extracted from one portion of the harvested infected cells were separated on 1.3% agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane. Viral RNAs were probed with a Dig-labeled DNA probe corresponding to the 39 end 680 nucleotides of the IBV genome. Bands corresponding to the genomic and subgenomic mRNA are indicated by numbers 1-6 on the right. The same membrane was also probed with a Diglabeled GAPDH probe as loading control. The viral protein expression was analyzed by Western blot of total cell lysates prepared from another portion of the harvested infected cells with anti-IBV S protein antibodies. The same membrane was also analyzed by Western blot with anti-actin antibodies. c. Analysis of IL-8 expression. The total RNA preparations were analyzed by Northern blot with a Dig-labelled IL-8 probe (upper panels). The IL-8 expression at the protein level was analyzed by Western blot analysis with anti-IL-8 antibodies (lower panels). d. Analysis of IL-6 expression. The total RNA preparations were analyzed by Northern blot with a Dig-labelled IL-6 probe (lanes 1-8) . The IL-6 expression at the protein level was analyzed by Western blot analysis of culture media (lanes 9 and 10) and total cell lysates (lanes 11-12) harvested 24 h post-infection with anti-IL-6 antibodies. Western blot analysis of the total cell lysates with anti-actin antibodies was included as a loading control (lanes 11 and 12). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0001494.g006 would be the limitation and elimination of viral infection. This study therefore reveals a novel viral mechanism that controls the cellular anti-viral response. In fact, infection of cells stably expressing the Flag-tagged eIF3f with IBV showed reduced virus production, compared with cells without expression of the protein.",

However, regions with high similarity in the amino acid sequences between the two S proteins were found. For example, the region from amino acids 207-264 of the IBV S protein shares 58.62% amino acid similarity with the region from amino acids 264-321 in the SARS-CoV S protein.

The Nterminal part of the protein is normally not exposed to the cytoplasmic side of the membranous compartments of the cell. On the other hand, eIF3f is presumably a protein located mainly in the cytosol and nucleus [35] [36] . This would prevent or at least reduce the contact between the two proteins. However, immunofluorescent staining of cells expressing the two proteins clearly showed that the SARS-CoV S protein could interact with eIF3f and sequester the later to the site of S protein. It is likely that eIF3f could gain access to the luminal side of the membranous compartments and interact with the S protein. An alternative explanation may lie on the fact that multiple N-terminally truncated forms of the S protein can be detected in cells either infected with SARS-CoV and IBV or transfected with S protein constructs from both viruses (data not shown). As no transmembrane domain in this region, these N-terminally truncated S species may be localized mainly in the cytoplasm and interact with eIF3f.",

Similar observations were also reported in studies of other coronavirus S proteins [37] [38] [39] . Fusion of the neighboring cells would provide additional fresh eIF3f, which in turn enhances the expression of virus-induced transcripts pre-existed in the originally infected cells. It is therefore likely that inhibition of S protein-mediated fusion may, in addition to the inhibition of virus entry, alleviate the production of pathological cytokines and chemokines, leading to the reduction of cell damage caused by these products during the course of coronavirus infection.
