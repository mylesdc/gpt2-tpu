This retrospective cohort study aimed to determine the etiological agents responsible for respiratory tract infections by Anyplex II RV16 detection kit (RV16, Seegene), involving 2266 pediatric patients with respiratory infections admitted to the Department of Pediatrics at King Abdul-Aziz Medical City, Ministry of National Guard, Riyadh, from July 2014 to June 2015. The most frequent respiratory infections were recorded in the 1 to 5 year age group (44.7%). Rhinovirus (32.5%), Adenovirus (16.9%), and Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) B (10.4%) were most common. In single viral infections, Rhinovirus (41.2%), Metapneumovirus (15.3%), and Bocavirus (13.7%) were most frequent. In multiple viral infections, Rhinovirus (36.7%), Adenovirus (35.2%), Bocavirus (11.2), RSV B (7.8%), and RSV A (6.7%) were most frequent. No significant difference was observed in clinical presentations; however, rhinorrhea and hypodynamia were significantly associated with viral respiratory infections. Most respiratory viral pathogens peaked during December, January, March, and April. Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, and Bocavirus circulations were detected throughout the year. Winter peaks were recorded for Rhinovirus, RSV B, Adenovirus, and RSV A, whereas the Metapneumovirus, and the Bocavirus peaked in March and April. These findings enhance understanding of viral etiology and distribution to improve respiratory infection management and treatment.",

Children under the age of 5 years were detected with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV-1), human parainfluenza virus 2 (PIV-2), human parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3), human parainfluenza virus 4 (PIV-4), human rhinovirus (HRV), human enterovirus (HEV), and human bocavirus (HBoV). Coinfections with different multiple viruses were reported in 15% to 61% of patients. [6] [7] [8] [9] . Molecular techniques such as multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are widely used for the detection and identification of respiratory viruses [10] [11] [12] and are helpful in the management and treatment 2 BioMed Research International of respiratory infections [13] . Diagnosing respiratory viruses by isolation in cell cultures and serology is time consuming, laborious, expensive, and less sensitive in some cases. Molecular techniques provide quick results with high sensitivity and specificity. Multiplex PCR has been reported as a fast and sensitive assay for respiratory infection detection. Anyplex II RV16 (Seegene, Korea) is a multiplex real-time PCR based kit with Tagging Oligonucleotide Cleavage Extension (TOCE) technology. The pitcher and catcher are two novel components used in TOCE assay for unique signal generation in real time. In TOCE assay detection point is moved from the target sequence to the catcher so it provides the predictable melting temperature analysis for catcher duplex. This process offers the multiplex real-time PCR capability to Anyplex II RV16 kit. [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

In this study, the most common respiratory viruses detected were HRV (32.5%), AdV (16.9%), and RSV B (10.4%). A previous study [25] reported detection rates for RSV (23.9%), HRV (14.7%), and AdV (11%) in Saudi Arabia. In another study in China, influenza viruses (18.50%), RSV (7.86%), and AdV (3.47%) were found to be the most common respiratory pathogens [32] . In multiple viral infections, HRV (36.7%), AdV (35.2%), HBoV (11.2), RSV B (7.8%), and RSV A (6.7%) were found most frequently. In single viral infections, HRV (41.2%), HMPV (15.3%), and HBoV (13.7%) were detected most frequently (Table 3) . AdV and HEV were found to be significantly higher in number than other viruses. This finding suggests that the occurrence of these viruses may facilitate other viral pathogens to infect the patient. The mixed viral infection rate was 42.3% for all samples in our study. HRV (36.7%), AdV (35.2%), HBoV (11.2), RSV B (7.8%), and RSV A (6.7%) were found among most frequent coinfected groups. Another study has reported detecting multiple viral infections involving rhinovirus, AdV, and HCoV-OC43 groups [2] . HRV and AdV have also been reported as the leading viral pathogens involved in mixed viral infectious agents among children [33] . These results further suggest that some viral groups facilitate infection or colonization by other viruses in the same patients. Viral coinfection or the detection of two or more viral pathogens in a single patient may be attributed to asymptomatic persistence or the shedding of viruses [3] . The great variations in detection rates of multiple viral infections, in different studies, may be related to differences in study populations, locations, study periods, environmental factors, the number of viral pathogens tested, and differences in diagnostic techniques [2, 8, 34] . Similarities in clinical presentations of patients infected with different respiratory viruses make it difficult to diagnose the precise etiological agent based on clinical signs.",
