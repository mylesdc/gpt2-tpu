However, most of them require researchers to remain online and wait for returned results. The latter not only requires highly available network connection, but also may cause the network overload. Moreover, so far none of the existing approaches has been designed to address the following problems when retrieving the remote data in a mobile network environment: (1) the resources of mobile devices are limited; (2) network connection is relatively of low quality; and (3) mobile users are not always online. To address the aforementioned problems, we integrate an agent migration approach with a multi-agent system to overcome the high latency or limited bandwidth problem by moving their computations to the required resources or services. More importantly, the approach is fit for the mobile computing environments. Presented in this paper are also the system architecture, the migration strategy, as well as the security authentication of agent migration. As a demonstration, the remote data retrieval from GenBank was used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.",

Gouy and Delmotte proposes a biological sequence database system named ACNUC, which is able to provide powerful and fast query and extraction capabilities to a variety of nucleotide and protein sequence databases [5] . Lacroix presents a tool to query integrated web data sources composed of a retrieval component based on an intermediate object view mechanism and search views, and an XML engine [6] .

In the implementation of the case study, when a mobile agent is required to migrate, it invokes requestMigration() method to request an asynchronous migration. Then the multi-agent system processes the request by executing preDeliverAgent() method, and build a connection with the destination host by remotely invoking preReceiveAgent() method in that host through RMI over Internet inter-orb protocol (RMI-IIOP) [31] . Furthermore, the multi-agent system sends a request for transferring an agent to the system in the destination host. After obtaining a positive response from the destination host, the system in the source host starts to transfer the replication of the agent. If the transfer is successful, a message will be sent to close the connection, register the information to the destination host, make the agent reloaded in the destination host, and inform the source host to delete the agent; otherwise, the request will enter the processing queue in the source host.

Figure 7 demonstrates the returned analysis results in two mobile device emulators. This paper proposes an agent migration approach to fill in the gap that existing approaches have not addressed: retrieving remote data in a low-quality network environment, especially unstable mobile computing environments. The ability of migration offers mobile agents a means to overcome the high latency or limited bandwidth problem by moving their computations to required resources or services. The proposed approach can also overcome the resource limitation of mobile terminals and release mobile users from keeping online persistently. The system architecture and the migration service are given in details. A remote data retrieval in GenBank was used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.",
