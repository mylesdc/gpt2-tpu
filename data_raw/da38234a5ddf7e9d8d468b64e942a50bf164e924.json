As part of her pre-HCT conditioning regimen, the patient received myeloablative treatment with cyclophosphamide and 12 Gy total body irradiation. Iterative sequencing and RT-PCR confirmation of four respiratory samples over the 4-week peritransplant period revealed that the pre-conditioning strain contained an intact ORF4 gene, while the deletion strain appeared just after conditioning and persisted over a 2.5-week period. This sequence represents one of the largest genomic deletions detected in a human RNA virus and describes large-scale viral mutation associated with myeloablation for HCT.",

Although much attention has been paid to the epidemic potential and high mortality rates for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus coronaviruses, the most common human coronaviruses (HCoV) include 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63 viruses. 1 HCoV 229E and NL63 are alphacoronaviruses with genome lengths of 27-28 kb, and HCoV HKU1 and OC43 are betacoronaviruses with genome lengths around 30-31 kb. 2 Few studies have been conducted on the genome evolution of the common HCoV species. 3, 4 HCoVs enact a major burden on hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients with >10% cumulative incidence of HCoV infection among HCT by day 100 of transplant. 5 HCoV in HCT patients is associated with prolonged shedding, with a median duration of 3 weeks. 5 Conditioning regimens for HCT usually consist of chemotherapy and irradiation that may induce genomic alterations. 6, 7 Treatment-related myeloid leukemias are well-known to be associated with radiation therapy or chemotherapeutic agents such as cyclophosphamide. 8 Here we describe the generation of a large deletion in an RNA virus that was temporally associated with the myeloablative conditioning regimen for HCT.",

The previous year she had undergone four cycles of chemotherapy (G-CLAM, G-CLA, cytarabine, and decitabineprimed MEC). Her prior month's bone marrow evaluation showed 16% blasts by flow cytometry with normal cytogenetics. On day -12 (12 days prior to transplant), she was found to be infected by a coronavirus 229E with a cycle threshold (Ct) of 30 and persisted at the same Ct on day \u22129 (Fig. 1a) . Based on the patient's risk of relapsing leukemia and relative rarity of HCoV pneumonitis, the decision was made to continue with HCT despite ongoing viral shedding. On days \u22127 and \u22126 she received cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg, and on days \u22124, \u22123, and \u22122 she received a dose of twice-daily 2 Gy total body irradiation for a cumulative dose of 12 Gy (Fig. 1a) . Other significant drugs the patient received during this time period included acyclovir, granisetron, micafungin, voriconazole, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. A mismatched unrelated donor peripheral blood stem-cell transplant was performed on day 0. Throughout the HCoV infection, the patient had mild nasal congestion but never required supplemental oxygen. Her course was complicated by bacteremia on day 10 (10 days after transplant), thought to be due to grade 2 mucositis, and she was discharged on day 20.",

All qRT-PCR cycle thresholds (Ct) recovered over the four-week period were comparable, ranging between 31.3-33.5 ( Table 1 ). The percent of total reads mapping to HCoV 229E ranged from 0.01-0.75%, consistent with the low concentrations of virus found by qRT-PCR ( Table 1) . mNGS of the Day 15 post-transplant specimen revealed a large deletion that encompassed 548 of the 660 nucleotides of the ORF 4 gene (Fig. 1b) with average coverage of 68\u00d7 across the viral genome. Repeat library preparations of the same specimen demonstrated the same deletion. The deletion was found whether mapping to the HCoV 229E reference genome or the de novo assembly. No read was recovered within the area of the deletion, suggesting the presence of a viral population entirely containing the genomic deletion. mNGS of the day \u221212 and day \u22129 specimens from the same patient revealed a completely intact ORF4a/4b (Fig. 1b) . Other than the large deletion, no consensus variants were observed between the HCoV 229E consensus genomes recovered from day \u221212, day \u22129, and day \u221215 specimens. Mapping of reads from the day -12, day \u22129, day \u221215 samples to the day \u221212 consensus genome revealed two minor allele variants that reached >10% allele frequency and had consistent allele frequencies between the day \u221212 and day \u22129 samples. The first was a c.12332 A > G, p. K4111R change in the replicase protein that went from undetectable in the day \u221212 and day \u22129 specimens and was at Fig. 1 Detection of a 548-nucleotide deletion in a HCoV 229E strain associated with myeloablation. a Depiction of the case history surrounding myeloablation and coronavirus infection. A woman in her 40s with AML was found to be infected with a HCoV 229E just before her HCT. Due to the patient's advanced disease, the decision was made to continue with the transplant. Four successive HCoV-positive nasal swab specimens were available from the patient; two from before treatment with myeloablative cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation and two from after. All days are reported relative to HCT. b Coverage plots of mNGS reads mapped to the reference genome for HCoV 229E (NC_002645) of three samples from the patient revealed the generation of a 548-nucleotide deletion in the ORF4a/4b gene. In addition to deleting 83% of the coding region from ORF4a/4b, the deletion resulted in a frame shift that resulted in a premature stop codon 10 amino acids before the reference genome stop codon. Primer binding sites are denoted in blue for confirmatory junction RT-PCR. c Confirmatory junction RT-PCR of the four available HCoV-positive nasal swabs revealed the absence of the deletion before myeloablation and the presence of the deletion in specimens taken after myeloablation.

The ORF4-deleted virus maintained the same viral load over a 2.5 week period and was clonal by day 15 after transplant, suggesting that it was replication competent in vivo. No other majority consensus variants in the HCoV genome arose during the sampled period. One minor variant arose in the day 15 specimen that was not present in the earlier specimens, while another minor variant maintained a similar allele frequency throughout the sampled period. This rate of single nucleotide variant evolution is consistent with the molecular clock of HCoV and with a study of that found no HCoV genomic variants arose during the first month of infection. 9 The ability of the virus to persist in vivo despite the near complete loss of ORF4 suggests that this accessory gene is completely dispensable for HCoV 229E replication and may outcompete the wild-type virus under certain conditions. Indeed, HCoV 229E type strain contains a 2-nucleotide deletion that splits ORF4 into ORF4a/4b, and the alpaca alphacoronavirus contains a 1-nucleotide insertion that also disrupts the reading frame. 10, 11 Meanwhile, all other group1b coronaviruses including all known HCoV 229E clinical strains contain an intact ORF4. 10, 12 This is the first detection of a non-intact ORF4 in HCoV 229E associated with human infection.",

Cyclophosphamide is a well-known clastogen and has recently been associated with increased development of single nucleotide variations insertions and deletions. 7, 16 Alternatively, the myeloablative regime could have removed immune pressure, allowing for the loss of ORF4. It seems that in certain circumstances, deletion of ORF4 could prove a selective advantage as it was the only allele present in the day \u221215 specimen. This study has several limitations. We were unable to culture any of the patient's HCoV specimens to demonstrate ability to replicate in vitro. This is not necessarily surprising as HCoV 229E are not usually cultured in the clinical virology lab and the virus was present at low concentrations in the sample. We are also limited in accurately calling minor variants by the relatively low coverage of each viral genome. We did not attempt reverse genetics of any alphacoronaviruses to definitively show ORF4 is dispensable for in vitro replication, although the ability of the type strain to replicate despite a 2-nucleotide deletion in ORF4 and the luciferase gene replacement experiment described above are consistent with this possibility.",

Similarly sized (500-700 nucleotide) deletions have previously been found in hepatitis D virus in patients receiving antiviral therapy. 17 Our study is also the first demonstration of microbial evolution associated with cyclophosphamide treatment or irradiation. Further research into how chemotherapy and irradiation affect the microbiome is warranted.

Due to low coverage, minor variants were called with a minimum allele frequency of 10% at 11\u00d7 coverage, after trimming of inversions due to Nextera artifacts, variants within 10 nucleotides of end of read, and PCR duplicates.
