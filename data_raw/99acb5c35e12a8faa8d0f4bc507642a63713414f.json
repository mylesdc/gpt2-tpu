Humans are polymorphic for the germline dinucleotide variant, rs368234815-TT/\u0394G, in the IFNL4 gene encoding interferon \u03bb4. Since the IFNL4-\u0394G allele has been linked to impaired viral clearance, we hypothesized that potential exposure to sexually transmitted pathogens, as assessed by the number of lifetime sexual partners, may increase prostate cancer risk in an IFNL4-\u0394G-dependent manner. Accordingly, we find that men with 10 or more sexual partners and at least one copy of IFNL4-\u0394G have a significantly increased risk of prostate cancer while those with the same number of partners but lacking IFNL4-\u0394G do not. Moreover, a test for effect modification shows a positive interaction between the number of lifetime partners and IFNL4-\u0394G in the development of aggressive prostate cancer. Based on these findings, we conclude that a gene-environment interaction between IFNL4-\u0394G and sexual activity may increase the risk of prostate cancer.",

Based on these findings, we conclude that a gene-environment interaction between IFNL4-\u0394G and sexual activity may increase the risk of prostate cancer. C ancer-causing sexually transmitted infections (STI), such as human papillomavirus (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV), are common worldwide. HPV infections cause cervical and head and neck cancers, while HIV infections cause Kaposi's sarcoma 1 . The prostate gland is an organ that is easily exposed to infections of the urogenital tract. The innate immune response of the urogenital epithelium provides the first line of defense against pathogens and may protect against urogenital cancers. Accordingly, studies have reported an association between prostate cancer risk and mutations or genetic variants in innate immune response genes 2, 3 . However, the evidence for an association between STI and prostate cancer remains inconclusive. Multiple epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between lifetime number of sexual partners, as a proxy for STI, and prostate cancer risk and reported both positive [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] and null associations [12] [13] [14] [15] . Therefore, we hypothesized that discordance in these observations could be due to residual confounding by unknown host factors modifying the relationship between STI and prostate cancer.",

The \u0394G allele creates an open reading frame for IFN-\u03bb4, thus this interferon can only be produced in carriers of the \u0394G allele. Paradoxically, although IFN-\u03bb4 is an antiviral cytokine and a potent inducer of the JAK-STAT pathway, individuals carrying the IFNL4-\u0394G allele have impaired ability to clear certain viral infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) 16, 18, 19 , cytomegalovirus 20, 21 , coronavirus 22, 23 , and possibly HIV 24 . This effect has been attributed to increased induction of negative regulators of interferon signaling by IFN-\u03bb4 that could affect the function of other interferons 16, 17 . We recently showed that IFNL4-\u0394G is closely associated with the occurrence of an interferon signature, termed Interferon-related DNA Damage Resistance Signature (IRDS), in prostate tumors of African-American patients with decreased overall survival in this patient group 25 . Thus, IFNL4-\u0394G may have a significant function in prostate cancer biology.",

As the youngest age at diagnosis in our cohort was 42 years, and 24 of our participants had a prostate cancer diagnosis in their 40s and therefore could not report any sexual partners in their 50s and beyond, we decided to only look at exposures during their teens, 20, and 30s. Table 2 presents the associations of sexual activity during early adulthood (up to age 39) and throughout lifetime with prostate cancer. We did not observe a significant association between the number of sexual partners when the men were teens and their risk of developing prostate cancer later in life, according to the multivariable model, although a trend towards an increased risk was observed in the univariate analysis. On the other hand, when considering the number of sexual partners during an individual's 20s and 30s, individuals who had 10 or more sexual partners had a 41% and 59% increased odd of prostate cancer, respectively, compared with men who had 0-1 partners. Similarly, when considering the total number of sexual partners through the life course, men who had 20 or more sexual partners had a 47% increased odd of prostate cancer. These associations were significant in the multivariable model and were also dosedependent. For example, men who had 10 or more sexual partners had more risk than those who had 2-9 sexual partners during their 20s (P trend = 0.029) and 30s (P trend = 0.001). Our findings indicate that increased exposure to STI during early adulthood elevates individuals' risk of developing prostate cancer later in life, suggesting that STI may play a role in the etiology of prostate cancer. These findings were observed in both EA and AA men. However, we noted a more robust risk association among the AA men (Table 2) .",

To increase the statistical power to test this hypothesis, we combined individuals with moderate likelihood of exposure (2-9 sexual partners) with the highest likelihood of exposure (10 +sexual partners) and compared their risk to the reference group (0-1 sexual partners). As shown in Supplementary Table 4 , among those with an increased likelihood of exposure to STI in their 20s, 30s, or during their lifetime, the odds of diagnosis with prostate cancer were higher in carriers of \u0394G/\u0394G than of \u0394G/TT or TT/TT genotypes. Again, there was no significant relationship between the number of sexual partners and prostate cancer risk among TT/TT carriers. However, \u0394G/\u0394G carriers who had two or more sexual partners in their 20s and 30s, or had 20 or more sexual partners during their lifetime, had increased risk. For instance, for men with two or more sexual partners vs. none during their 30s, the odds ratios increased from 1 To further examine this observation, we tested for statistical significance of an interaction term between IFNL4-\u0394G and likelihood of exposure to STI during early adulthood, using the number of sexual partners as the surrogate measurement for STI likelihood. This analysis was performed for all prostate cancer cases and then stratified into nonaggressive and aggressive disease. Notably, the strongest evidence for a gene-environment interaction revealed an association of this interaction with the odds of developing the aggressive disease (Table 4) , where both IFNL4-\u0394G and multiple lifetime sexual partners synergistically increased the odds for aggressive prostate cancer (P interaction = 0.004). This association remained significant when a Bonferroniadjusted significance threshold of P < 0.00625 was applied. We made similar observations when we examined the association AA African-American, EA European-American, IQR interquartile range, SD standard deviation, PSA prostate specific antigen a Cases recruited within 2 years after disease diagnosis with an average interval between diagnosis and enrollment of 6.7 months b Age at study interview c First-degree relative with prostate cancer d Smoking status describes cigarette smoking e Pathologically confirmed using American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition f Cases with pathologically confirmed T1 or T2 and Gleason score \u2264 7 g Cases with pathologically confirmed T3 or T4 or Gleason score > 7 between number of sexual partners and disease risk among IFNL4-\u0394G carriers in strata of aggressive and nonaggressive prostate cancer. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 5 , IFNL4-\u0394G carriers who had 10 or more sexual partners in their 20s and 30s (or 20 or more lifetime partners), tended to have higher odds of being diagnosed with an aggressive than a nonaggressive disease. IFNL4-\u0394G has very divergent allelic frequencies across populations-<10% in Asians,~30% in Europeans, and up to 78% in Africans 16 -which can lead to a wide range of population attributable risks associated with this genetic variant. Given that the allele frequency is higher in AA, we stratified our analysis by race/ethnicity. We found that the odds of being diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer in men who had 10 or more sexual partners in their 20s or 30s (or 20 or more lifetime partners) was higher among AA men than EA men (Table 6) , consistent with the increased frequency of the IFNL4-\u0394G risk allele in AA compared to any other racial group. For AA men, having multiple sexual partners (10 or more) in their 30s, increased their odds of diagnosis with aggressive prostate cancer by 207% vs. only by 43% for nonaggressive prostate cancer (Table 6) . Similarly, in men with at least one copy of the \u0394G allele, having multiple sexual partners in their 30s was associated with 182% increased odds of a diagnosis with aggressive prostate cancer vs. only 56% for nonaggressive prostate cancer (Table 5 ). In EA men, however, these relationships were either non-significant, or borderline significant, again suggesting that the higher prevalence of the \u0394G allele in AA men could contribute to their increased risk for aggressive prostate cancer.",

In SeV-infected human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145, we observed a robust induction of the transcripts in the IFNL4 region (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary Table 5 ). Of note, mRNA induction is not allele-specific and can be detected in cells with the TT/TT genotype, although expression is generally lower with the TT/TT genotype due to nonsense-mediated decay of prematurely terminated out-of-frame transcripts 16 . However, IFN-\u03bb4 protein can be produced only in the presence of the \u0394G allele. Indeed, our Western blot analysis showed that IFN-\u03bb4 was strongly induced in the SeV-infected PC3 cells that have the \u0394G/ \u0394G genotype but not in DU145 cells that have the TT/TT genotype ( Fig. 2, Supplementary Figure 2 ).",

Our observations were consistent across age group and IFNL4 genotype strata. Furthermore, the odds of developing prostate cancer, particularly of an aggressive type, increased with the number of sexual partners in men carrying the IFNL4-\u0394G allele. As AA are more likely than EA men to carry the \u0394G allele, the effect was more pronounced in the former population.

            "text": "Since the first documented implication of STI as a possible etiologic agent for prostate cancer in the early 1950s 27 , multiple epidemiologic studies have subsequently explored this relationship. Yet, epidemiologic evidence for the association of STI with prostate cancer is still not firmly established. Multiple studies with self-reported exposure to any STI or to the most common, symptomatic STI (i.e. gonorrhea) have reported a positive association 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, [28] [29] [30] [31] , resembling the epidemiologic literature for cervical cancer before the discovery of HPV as the etiologic agent. In our study, we observed that self-reported exposure to gonorrhea increased the odds of diagnosis with prostate cancer by about 30% (Supplementary Table 6 ), which is in concordance with the 2005 32 and the 2015 33 meta-analysis data that reported a 35% and 31% increase in risk, respectively. The search for prostate cancer etiologic agents also encompassed sero-epidemiologic evaluations of the association between prostate cancer risk and infection with human herpesvirus 8, herpes simplex type 2, HPV, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis, but the reported findings are far from conclusive [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . Although our observations of a gene-environment interaction related to a STI do not implicate a specific STI, they suggest that exposure to some sexually transmitted etiologic agent(s) may lead to prostate cancer, but only in genetically susceptible individuals.",

In vitro infection of prostate cancer cell lines with SeV, a model for a wide range of RNA viruses, showed induction of IFN-\u03bb4 in a cell line homozygote for the \u0394G allele (PC3) but not in a cell line without this allele (DU145), supporting the hypothesis for a viral origin of IFN-\u03bb4 expression in prostate tissue. Until now, a detectable induction of endogenous IFN-\u03bb4 protein was only shown for hepatic cells 16, 17 .

Our study should not be affected by interviewer bias since sexual history information was acquired through a self-administered questionnaire filled in privacy.

In our view, it is unlikely that the general population is aware of the infectious hypothesis in the context of prostate cancer, arguing against a recall bias.

Although our findings do not implicate a specific STI, they strongly argue for an infection as an etiologic agent for prostate cancer in a substantial subset of patients. Whether the observed association is due to carcinogenic effects of a putative etiologic infectious agent or rather due to the host's response to the infectious agent needs to be examined in future work. Our data suggest that the etiology of prostate cancer may vary in population groups due to the ancestry-related genetic variation in resolution or progression of an infection following exposure. The proposed synergistic mechanism of prostate cancer pathophysiology is relevant for all populations but could disproportionally affect men of African ancestry. As such, these findings may shed light on the prostate cancer health disparity.",

For lifetime number of sexual partners, the \"5 to 9\" and \"10 to 19\" categories were collapsed to a new a category \"5 to 19\" whereas the \"20 to 30\" and \"40 or more\" categories were collapsed together into a new category \"20 or more\". Similarly, for the number of sexual partners that the men had during their different age decades (teens, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s), we collapsed the categories to three groups: a reference group (0-1 sexual partners) with presumed no or low chance of contracting a STI, a medium risk group (2-9 sexual partners) with intermediate likelihood of contracting a STI, and a higher risk group (10 or more sexual partners) with the highest likelihood of contracting a STI.

PC3 and DU145 cells were infected with SeV for 24 h, and induction of IFN-\u03bb4 was examined by western blotting with an anti-IFN-\u03bb4 antibody. Expression of GAPDH was used as a loading control. Shown are results of biological duplicates of cells noninfected (\u2212) and infected (+) with SeV. Recombinant purified IFN-\u03bb4 (2.5 ng) was used as a positive control; glycosylation of endogenous IFN-\u03bb4 produced in mammalian cells increases its molecular weight compared to non-glycosylated recombinant protein produced in E. coli. IFN-\u03bb4 expression is detected in PC3 cells (\u0394G/\u0394G genotype) but not in DU145 cells (TT/TT genotype). Original full-size versions of Western blot images are presented in",
