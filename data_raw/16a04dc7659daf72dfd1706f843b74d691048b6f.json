Previous studies suggest that the PEDV E protein plays an important role in the viral assembly process. However, the subcellular localization and other functions of PEDV E protein still require more research. Methods: The subcellular localization and function of PEDV E protein were investigated by examining its effects on cell growth, cell cycle progression, interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression and cell survival. Results: The results show that plenty of PEDV E protein is localized in the ER, with small quantities localized in the nucleus. The PEDV E protein has no effect on the intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) growth, cell cycle and cyclin A expression. The cells expressing PEDV E protein express higher levels of IL-8 than control cells. Further studies show that PEDV E protein induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated NF-\u03baB which is responsible for the up-regulation of IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression. Conclusions: This study shows that the PEDV E protein is localized in the ER and the nucleus and it can cause ER stress. The PEDV E protein had no effect on the IEC growth and cell cycle. In addition, the PEDV E protein is able to up-regulate IL-8 and Bcl-2 expression.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease of swine characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting, and watery diarrhea and results in high mortality in piglets [1] . The causative agent belonging to the family Coronaviridae is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which is first reported by Pensaert and DeBouck in Belgium and the United Kingdom [2, 3] . PED is currently a source of concern in Asia countries, where outbreaks are often more acute and severe than those observed in Europe [4] . PED is one of the most important diseases incurring economic loss in many swine-raising countries, mainly due to its high prevalence, compared to the rare incidence of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and the asymptomatic characteristics of the Rotavirus (RV) infections [3, 5] . PEDV is an enveloped virus possessing an approximately 28 kb, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome with a 5' cap and a 3' polyadenylated tail [4, 6] . The genome is comprised of seven open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural proteins and three non-structural proteins which are arranged on the genome in the order 5'-replicase (1a/1b)-S-ORF3-E-M-N-3' [7] [8] [9] . Genes for the major structural proteins spike (S, 180-220 kDa), membrane (M, 27-32 kDa), nucleocapsid (N, 58 kDa) and small membrane (E, 7 kDa) are located downstream of the polymerase gene [10, 11] .",

Studies on the assembly of coronavirus structural proteins by heterologous mammalian expression systems have shown that coexpression of E and M proteins from bovine coronavirus (BCoV), MHV, TGEV, IBV, and SARS-CoV results in the formation of virus likeparticles (VLPs) that are morphologically identical to spikeless virions. Moreover, it has been determined that both the MHV and IBV E proteins are sufficient for the generation of VLPs [12] . Recently, a recombinant MHV virus was constructed with the E gene deleted. This virus replicates with a low infectious titer, suggesting that E protein is critical, but not essential for MHV replication in vitro [12] . Presently, no data were reported about the subcellular localization of PEDV E protein, its effects on cell growth and cell cycle progression. The porcine intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line is the target cell of PEDV. The epithelial cells in the gut serve as a physical barrier, restricting the movement of components and the passage of potentially harmful microorganisms between the lumen and the underlying mucosa [13] . This study initiates the subcellular localization of PEDV E protein and elucidates the effects and mechanisms of this protein on cell growth and cell cycle.",

Furthermore, we show that plenty of PEDV E protein is localized in the ER and a little in the nucleus. PEDV E protein can induce ER stress. Under conditions of ER stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR) can initiate inflammation in mammalian cells and these responses are thought to be essential in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases [14, 15] . IL-8 as a pro-inflammatory neutrophil chemotactic factor plays an important role in the promotion of cell survival signaling [16, 17] . However, there is no report that PEDV E protein affects IL-8 expression in IEC. Our studies show that PEDV E protein up-regulates IL-8 expression which is associated with NF-\u03baB activation. Moreover, the cells expressing PEDV E protein causes high expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The experiment has potentially important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms of PED pathogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first report about PEDV E protein function on porcine intestinal epithelial cell.",

The histograms were quantitatively further analyzed to determine the percentage of cells in each of the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases, where G0/G1 phase cells show a 2 N DNA content and G2/M phase cells show a 4 N DNA content.

To understand the effect of E protein expression on cell cycle, we examined cyclin A protein levels in transfected cells and control cells using western blot assay. The result showed Cyclin A expression level was slightly changed in cells that expressed E protein compared with control cells. The result indicates that the expression of E had no change on cyclin A expression. To further support these findings, quantitative real-time RT-PCR was employed. The result shows that cyclin A mRNA levels in the GFP-Eexpressing cells were also no change compared with control cells.

After the treatment with MG132, the level of IL-8 in the supernatants from control cells was significantly decreased. In contrast, there was no change in supernatants from the GFP-E expressing cells. An investigation of the transcriptional levels of IL-8 using real-time quantitative PCR found that the mRNA levels of IL-8 in the GFP-E expressing cells is also higher than in the GFP transfected cells and untransfected cells ( Figure 5B ). These results suggested that PEDV E up-regulates IL-8 expression in IECs.

However, the subcellular localization and function of PEDV E protein is still unclear. Also, the function of this protein is yet to be studied, particularly with regard to its effect on host cell physiological changes. In this study, we constructed a eukaryotic expression vector and generated stably expressing cell lines of PEDV E in fusion with the GFP protein that allowed analysis of its properties. Co-localization studies clearly show that plenty of PEDV E protein is localized in the ER with small amounts collecting in the nucleus. In this study, Western blot analysis revealed that cyclin A protein levels in the cells expressing PEDV E protein were slightly change compared with control cells, suggesting that PEDV E protein had no effect on host cell proliferation and cell cycle. Our observations show that the PEDV E protein is likely to be responsible for inducing ER stress. In this study, the results show that PEDV E protein was localized in the ER and the nucleus and able to induce ER stress, as indicated by the significant up-regulation of the molecule chaperon GRP78, a typical marker of ER stress.",

Viruses use the ER as an integral part of their replication strategy; they must contend with the ER stress response and the downstream consequences of ER stress signalling, including the initiation of an inflammatory response through the activation of NF-\u03baB [14, 15, 22] . IL-8 as a pro-inflammatory neutrophil chemotactic factor plays an important role in the promotion of cell survival signaling and antagonizes the anti-viral activities of interferon. In this study, the results show that PEDV E protein was able to up-regulate IL-8 expression in host cells. PEDV E protein induced ER stress and significantly activated NF-\u03baB which consequently caused the promotion of IL-8 expression. Further research suggests that IL-8 expression in control cells treated with MG132 was significantly decreased compared with untreated cells. However, the IL-8 production from the cells of GFP-E protein expression treated with MG132 was not significantly changed compared with the untreated cells. These results show that MG132 was able to inhibit IL-8 expression in control cells and the E protein was able to antagonize MG132 function.",
