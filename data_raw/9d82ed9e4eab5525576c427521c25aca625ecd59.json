However, one of the major limitations of nucleoside analogues is the development of antiviral resistance. In that regard, flexible nucleoside analogues known as \"fleximers\" have garnered attention over the years due to their ability to survey different amino acids in enzyme binding sites, thus overcoming the potential development of antiviral resistance. Acyclic fleximers have previously demonstrated antiviral activity against numerous viruses including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and, most recently, flaviviruses such as Dengue (DENV) and Yellow Fever Virus (YFV). Due to these interesting results, a Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) study was pursued in order to analyze the effect of the pyrimidine functional group and acyl protecting group on antiviral activity, cytotoxicity, and conformation. The results of those studies are presented herein.",

Most of the recent studies within the Seley-Radtke lab have focused on the development of fleximer analogues for use in antiviral and anticancer therapeutics [11, 17, 20] . In particular, fleximer analogues based on the structure of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug Acyclovir have demonstrated great promise, with compound 1 demonstrating low micromolar activity against coronaviruses [17] , filoviruses [20] , and most recently, flaviviruses ( Figure 2 , unpublished results).

This series was also tested against the aforementioned viruses; however, these analogues were not more active than compound 1. Furthermore, the addition of an acetate protecting group (1-Ac) led to a decrease in antiviral activity, but also a large decrease in cytotoxicity (unpublished results). In order to explore the effects of different hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups on the fleximer pyrimidine ring, as well as the effect of various acetate protecting groups on antiviral activity, an SAR study was pursued. Herein, we report the synthesis and antiviral evaluation of series 1-5 ( Figure 3 ). Most of the recent studies within the Seley-Radtke lab have focused on the development of fleximer analogues for use in antiviral and anticancer therapeutics [11, 17, 20] . In particular, fleximer analogues based on the structure of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug Acyclovir have demonstrated great promise, with compound 1 demonstrating low micromolar activity against coronaviruses [17] , filoviruses [20] , and most recently, flaviviruses ( Most of the recent studies within the Seley-Radtke lab have focused on the development of fleximer analogues for use in antiviral and anticancer therapeutics [11, 17, 20] .

Not surprisingly, all the parent analogues (R group = H) were the least lipophilic of the series, with the amino series 4 and 5 demonstrating the lowest lipophillicity. On average, the difference between the parent analogues and the acetate analogues (R = Ac) was not substantial; however, the ethyl acyl analogues (R = EtAc) were substantially more lipophilic than the acetate analogues (for example, \u22120.14 compared to 0.52 for series 5). Not surprisingly, the increased branching also led to an increase in lipophilicity, as the t BuAc analogues were the most lipophilic of their series. While increased lipophillicity is typically associated with a better drug candidate, there is a limit where increased lipophillicity affects potency. For instance, the isopropyl acyl analogue 2-i PrAc demonstrated an EC 50 of 31.96 \u00b1 9.12 \u00b5M against EBOV and a logP of 2.15, whereas 2-t BuAc has an EC 50 of 81.34 \u00b1 10.15 \u00b5M and a logP of 2.85. Furthermore, the isopropyl acyl analogue 3-i PrAc demonstrates an EC 50 of 38.29 \u00b1 28.15 \u00b5M and a logP of 1.76, whereas 3-t BuAc has an EC 50 of 51.40 \u00b1 10.01 \u00b5M and a logP of 2.47. This suggests that compounds with logP values over 2.8 are too lipophilic, and thus are less active against EBOV. Interestingly, compound 4-i PrAc is less active than the more branched 4-t BuAc and is less lipophilic (logP = 0.88 vs 1.59), suggesting that compound with logP values greater than 1 may be more active. All together, these results suggest that lipophillicity and not branching affects antiviral activity.",

While none of the analogues analyzed were cytotoxic up to 100 \u00b5M, none of the analogues were more active against EBOV than compound 1. Regardless, it was determined that the 4-methoxy series were overall more active than the 2-amino series, suggesting that the 4-methoxy moiety may be more important for activity. Furthermore, compounds with logP values greater than 1 but less than 2.4 offer the necessary lipophilicity for activity. It was also found that compounds within series 1 and 2 adopt the typical anti-conformation, whereas compounds within series 5 adopt a syn conformation, thus offering another possible explanation for the differences in antiviral activity. With these initial results in hand, the synthesis of additional analogues, especially those with a methoxy group at the 4 position will be considered, in order to continue to try and further explore antiviral activity. The results of those studies will be reported elsewhere as they become available. ",
