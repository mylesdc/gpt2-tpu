            "text": "Interferon inducible protein kinase PKR is an essential component of innate immunity. It is activated by long stretches of dsRNA and provides the first line of host defense against pathogens by inhibiting translation initiation in the infected cell. Many cellular and viral transcripts contain nucleoside modifications and/or tertiary structure that could affect PKR activation. We have previously demonstrated that a 59-end triphosphate-a signature of certain viral and bacterial transcripts-confers the ability of relatively unstructured model RNA transcripts to activate PKR to inhibit translation, and that this activation is abrogated by certain modifications present in cellular RNAs. In order to understand the biological implications of native RNA tertiary structure and nucleoside modifications on PKR activation, we study here the heavily modified cellular tRNAs and the unmodified or the lightly modified mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNA). We find that both a T7 transcript of yeast tRNA Phe and natively extracted total bovine liver mt-tRNA activate PKR in vitro, whereas native E. coli, bovine liver, yeast, and wheat tRNA Phe do not, nor do a variety of base-or sugar-modified T7 transcripts. These results are further supported by activation of PKR by a natively folded T7 transcript of tRNA Phe in vivo supporting the importance of tRNA modification in suppressing PKR activation in cells. We also examine PKR activation by a T7 transcript of the A14G pathogenic mutant of mt-tRNA Leu , which is known to dimerize, and find that the misfolded dimeric form activates PKR in vitro while the monomeric form does not. Overall, the in vitro and in vivo findings herein indicate that tRNAs have an intrinsic ability to activate PKR and that nucleoside modifications and native RNA tertiary folding may function, at least in part, to suppress such activation, thus serving to distinguish self and non-self tRNA in innate immunity.",

PKR consists of two functional domains: an Nterminal double stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domain (dsRBD) comprised of two dsRNA binding motifs (dsRBMs) and a Cterminal kinase domain. These domains are separated by a flexible 20 amino acid linker [3, 4] . The dsRBM recognizes dsRNA with no sequence specificity via minor groove interactions [5, 6] , while the kinase domain helps mediate dimerization of PKR as well as possessing the kinase catalytic activity [7] [8] [9] .",

RNA species of this length are long enough to accommodate a PKR dimer [10] [11] [12] . Two models of RNA-mediated activation of PKR have been offered: 1) a model in which PKR has intrinsically disordered regions that become ordered upon RNA binding, and 2) an autoinhibition model in which the latent protein is locked into a closed conformation that is relieved upon binding to dsRNA of sufficient length [3, 13] . Activated PKR then phosphorylates translation initiation factor eIF2a, inhibiting translation initiation [14] . This overall process provides essential antiviral and antiproliferative functions for the infected host cell [15] .",

For instance, certain highly structured singlestranded viral and cellular RNAs with bulges, imperfect loops, pseudoknots, and single stranded tails can activate PKR [24] [25] [26] . In addition, largely single-stranded RNA can activate PKR in a 59triphosphate dependent manner, which may help distinguish self and non-self RNAs [27] [28] [29] , and this activation can be abrogated by incorporating nucleoside modifications into the transcripts [30, 31] . Several examples of non-canonical RNA activators of PKR include: HIV TAR and HDV RNA dimers [10, 11] , domain II and domain III-IV of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of HCV [32, 33] , the 39-untranslated regions (UTRs) of several highly structured cytoskeletal mRNAs [34, 35] , the 59-UTR of IFN-c mRNA [24, 25] , and mutant transcripts of the Huntington's and myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) genes [18, 36, 37] . These non-canonical RNA activators provide an activating length of 33 bp by either dimerization of the RNA [10, 11] , which roughly doubles the length of a given RNA species, or by non-Watson-Crick interactions in the loops of the RNA [1, 25] . In addition, siRNA containing just 19-21 bp can activate PKR, possibly by forming extended RNA species [1, 38, 39] .",

Given that modifications in tRNA strengthen tertiary structure [41] [42] [43] , one function of modifications might be to favor native RNA tertiary structure and thereby minimize tRNA dimerization. This observation could be related to innate immunity given previous data indicating that RNA dimerization drives PKR activation [10, 11] . In addition, previous studies suggest that unmodified tRNAs are capable of inducing an innate immune response via tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-a) in dendritic cells through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), whereas this induction is abrogated by modified tRNA [50] .

In the present study, we evaluate PKR activation by incorporating nucleoside modifications into biologically relevant tRNA transcripts, as well as endogenous tRNAs from various organisms. In the cytoplasm of the cell, tRNAs are the most heavily modified RNAs, with approximately 20% of its nucleosides being modified [51] . Since PKR is mostly present in the cytoplasm [52] and based on our previous studies on modified short RNAs and mRNAs [30, 31] , we reasoned that modifications in tRNAs may have a significant role in suppressing activation of PKR.",

            "text": "Most Nucleoside Modifications Abrogate Activation of PKR by tRNA In order to assess the effect of nucleoside modifications on PKR activation by tRNA, we chose to examine the commercially available phenylalanine-specific tRNA from yeast (tRNA Phe ) as an RNA substrate (Fig. 1A) . At first we compared activation (i.e. phosphorylation) of PKR by the T7 transcript of tRNA Phe and the natively isolated tRNA Phe (Fig. 1B, row 1 , compare the two lane sets). (In an innate immune response, PKR autophosphorylates, which allows it to phosphorylate eIF2a which inhibits translation initiation.) The T7 transcript contains a 59-triphosphate and unmodified bases, whereas the native tRNA has a 59-monophosphate and modified bases. The T7 transcript activated PKR to almost the same levels as the perfectly double stranded, dsRNA-79, whereas native tRNA Phe did not activate PKR above background at any of the RNA concentrations tested (Fig. 1B) . The abrogation of PKR activation by native tRNA Phe may be due to the internal modifications or to lack of a 59-triphosphate, given that some RNAs require a 59-triphosphate to activate PKR [27] . To test the role of the 59-triphosphate, we tested PKR activation by calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP)-treated T7-tRNA Phe . Activation of PKR was completely retained by CIP-treated T7-tRNA Phe (Fig. 1B , row 2, compare '59-ppp' and '59-OH' lanes), indicating that the 59-triphosphate is not a factor for PKR activation by T7-tRNA Phe . The unimportance of a 59-triphosphate for tRNA-PKR function is similar to that found for dsRNA and PKR [27] . Overall, these findings suggest that nucleoside modifications may play a key role in abrogating PKR activation by native tRNA Phe .",

            "text": "In order to better understand the role of nucleoside modifications in native tRNA-PKR interactions, we tested PKR activation by a series of modified T7-tRNA Phe transcripts. We fully substituted uridines in tRNA Phe with either 2thiouridine (s2U) or pseudouridine (y); cytidine with either 5methylcytidine (m5C), 29-O-methylcytidine (Cm), or 29-fluorocytidine (29-FC); and adenosine with N1-methyladenosine (m1A) (Fig. 1B) . These modified nucleosides are commercially available as triphosphates, which are amenable for use in in vitro transcription. Transfer RNAs containing the majority of these modifications (s2U, y, m5C, Cm, and m1A) revealed significant reduction in PKR activation, the exception being 29-FC, which showed an enhancement in PKR activation. These results indicate that modifications generally abrogate activation of PKR by tRNA, just as observed previously in model RNAs [30] . Moreover, retention of PKR activation by tRNAs containing 29-FC, which can accept a hydrogen bond, supports the importance of minor groove hydrogen bonding between the dsRBD and tRNA, as previously reported in unmodified dsRNAs [5, 6] . In considering these data, it is important to keep in mind that full substitution of a natural base with a modified one will affect the folding of the tRNA; as such, changes in PKR activation will be due to a combination of direct effects of the modification and indirect effects of the RNA folding. Overall, these findings suggest that tRNA has the potential to activate PKR and thus lead to an innate immune response.",

For example, cytoplasmic tRNAs are heavily modified (,14 sites/tRNA), whereas mitochondrial tRNAs generally contain relatively few modifications (,3 sites/tRNA) and have less variety in the modifications observed [53] . In particular, tRNAs from E. coli, bovine liver, yeast, and wheat contain many modifications as compared to mitochondrial bovine liver tRNAs [54] . To further test our observation that nucleoside modifications in tRNA influence PKR activation, we tested PKR activation by total tRNAs from different organisms, including E. coli, bovine liver, yeast, wheat and bovine liver mitochondria. All of these tRNAs are available commercially except for mitochondrial tRNA, which was isolated using published procedures [55] . As shown in Figure 2A , total mitochondrial bovine liver tRNA significantly activated PKR, while total tRNAs from other organisms did not. For example, at a 1.25 mM concentration, tRNAs from E. coli, bovine liver, yeast and wheat showed lower activation of PKR by ,22-, 7-, .25and 7-fold, respectively, as compared to mitochondrial tRNA. These observations strongly suggest that nucleoside modifications in these tRNAs play a major role in the abrogation of PKR activation, either directly or through their effects on tRNA structure.",

Remarkably, both of these tRNAs potently activated PKR, having activation profiles similar to each other and to the total mt bovine liver preparation, although there was somewhat less activation by the native mt-tRNA, perhaps reflecting a slight suppression of activation by its few modifications (Fig. 2B ). Because in vitro transcribed T7-mt-tRNA Met has no modifications and native mt-tRNA Met has very few, we believe that the ability of these tRNAs to activate PKR resides in the little or no modification present in them. This interpretation supports the notion that modifications in cytoplasmic tRNA play a significant role in minimizing PKR activation either directly or through effects on tRNA structure. Lastly, these results further support our earlier conclusion that PKR activation by tRNA is not 59-triphosphate-dependent in that neither of these tRNAs has a 59-triphosphate yet they are both potent activators: the unmodified T7-mt-tRNA Met has a hammerhead ribozyme-generated 59-hydroxyl while the natively isolated mt-tRNA Met has a 59-monophosphate.",

Native mobility-shift experiments were carried out as previously described, using P20, the dsRBD of PKR [5] . Appreciable binding was observed for dimer (K d ,1 mM) compared to monomer (K d ,5 mM) in the presence of 0.1 mg/mL herring sperm DNA (Fig. 4B) . Moreover, the binding ability of the monomer was completely abolished (K d .20 mM) when 0.1 mg/mL native yeast tRNA Phe was used as a competitor, while the binding ability of the dimer was reduced just 2.4-fold (K d ,3 mM) (Fig. 4C) . These results strongly suggest that the dimer is capable of binding PKR with high affinity as compared to the monomer. Overall, the approximate doubling of the number of base pairs present in the tRNA dimer helps promote tight binding and activation of PKR, as observed for other RNAs [10, 11] . ",

The Huh-7 cell line was chosen because it can produce interferon (IFN)-a/b and has the capacity to signal from the IFN-a/b receptor [27] . These cells can thus lead to PKR phosphorylation without the addition of IFN. Transfection with the positive control of dsRNA-79 induced activation of PKR (Fig. 5, lane 2) , while the mock transfection with RNA omitted did not (Fig. 5, lane 1) . Transfections of Huh-7 cells with a T7 transcript of yeast tRNA phe or natively isolated yeast tRNA phe were also conducted. The T7 transcript induced activation of PKR to the same level as the same amount of dsRNA-79 (Fig. 5 , compare lanes 4 and 2, respectively), while native tRNA phe did not activate PKR above the background found in the mock lane (Fig. 5, compare lanes 3 and 1, respectively) . These results parallel those found in vitro (Fig. 1B) and indicate that tRNAs have an intrinsic ability to activate PKR both in vitro and in vivo. It is important to note that unmodified and native yeast tRNA phe are thought to have the same tertiary structure, [41, 42, 44] suggesting that tRNA modifications may play a direct role in suppressing PKR activation in cells, at least in this case.",

Observation that the T7 transcript of tRNA Leu monomer did not activate PKR in vitro might seem to indicate that tRNA dimerization is critical for PKR activation; however it has been shown elsewhere that this non-activating transcript does not fold unless its synthetase is present [63] . Moreover, we were unable to detect any dimers of the PKR-activating mt-tRNA Met or other mt-tRNAs in vitro (Fig. S2 in File S1). On a related note, an unmodified T7 human mt-tRNA Met transcript, which is very close in sequence to the PKR-activating bovine version, adopts a cloverleaf structure [64] . This observation strengthens the importance of having native secondary structure in monomeric tRNA in order to activate PKR. This then suggests that RNA modifications play dual roles in suppressing activation of PKR by tRNA: 1.) They may help to abrogate activation when tRNA is a monomer with native secondary structure, which is supported by in vivo activation by natively folded yeast T7 tRNA Phe , and 2.) They may stabilize native tertiary structure to prevent the tRNA from dimerizing, which potentially activate PKR. Indeed, a role for RNA modifications in suppressing PKR activation has been reported previously for a non-dsRNA both in vitro and in vivo [30, 31] .",

            "text": "That tRNAs capable of activating PKR exist in the human cell but reside where PKR does not (i.e. in the mitochondria) is consistent with the absence of selective pressure on such tRNAs to avoid activating the innate immune system, although other functions of the modifications such as influencing native folding and the binding of proteins are almost certainly important. This possibility supports the notion that modification in cellular tRNAs function, at least in part, to suppress intrinsic activation of innate immune responses. It will be of interest to test whether there is a connection between tRNA from pathogens and PKR activation, as related to the innate immune system. In addition, it will be of interest to test whether other classes of cellular RNAs have an intrinsic ability to activate PKR or other innate immune sensors, and if certain cellular factors-for example, RNA modifications, tertiary structure, or protein binding function, at least in part, to suppress an innate immune response. The existence of the ability to activate the innate immune system intrinsic to the sequence and structure of a cellular RNA suggests the potential for rich regulation of innate immunity in response to stress, disease, or other exogenous signals that could function to unmask these suppressed RNA signatures. In wild-type, the 14 th position (bold font) is 'A', and in the pathogenic tRNA it is 'G'.
