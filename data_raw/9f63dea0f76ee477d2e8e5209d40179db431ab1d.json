In this study, we estimated the incubation period of HFMD from school outbreaks in Hong Kong, utilizing information on symptom onset and sick absence dates of students diagnosed with HFMD. A total of 99 HFMD cases from 12 schools were selected for analysis. We fitted parametric models accounting for interval censoring. Based on the best-fitted distributions, the estimated median incubation periods were 4.4 (95% CI 3.8-5.1) days, 4.7 (95% CI 4.5-5.1) days and 5.7 (95% CI 4.6-7.0) days for children in kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools respectively. From the fitted distribution, the estimated incubation periods can be longer than 10 days for 8.8% and 23.2% of the HFMD cases in kindergarten and secondary schools respectively. Our results show that the incubation period of HFMD for secondary schools students can be longer than the ranges commonly described. An extended period of enhanced personal hygiene practice and disinfection of the environment may be needed to control outbreaks.",

The estimated median incubation period of HFMD was 5.7 (95% CI 4.6-7.0) for secondary school students aged about 12-18 years and appears to be longer, though the difference did not reach statistical significance with the small sample size in the study. The estimated incubation periods can be longer than 10 days for 8.8% and 23.2% of the kindergarten and secondary school students respectively, based on the fitted distribution. The estimated incubation period for primary school children (n = 9) had a relatively low variability when comparing to other groups, probably because the data were obtained from a single school and hence likely to be caused by a single causative pathogen. In contrast, the relatively high variability of the estimated incubation period in the secondary school students (n = 73) may be explained by higher heterogeneity in host immune responses due to more previous exposure to different pathogens. To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the incubation period distributions of HFMD for different age groups based on empirical data. While the infection times were usually unobservable, the relatively short period between illness onset and sick absence in the school setting has helped reducing the uncertainty in the exposure period. The estimated incubation period was not sensitive to uncertainty due to unobserved transmission chain in outbreaks which may involve multiple generations. Our finding may have implications on the intervention or management of outbreaks in school settings, such as defining evidence-based observation period of HFMD outbreaks and maintaining a longer period of enhanced personal hygiene practice and disinfection of the environment 11 .",

In the questionnaire, we included individual questions on onset dates of the main symptoms of HFMD, and the start and end dates of sick absence. By prompting the participants to report the sequence of events related to the HFMD episode, the responses tended to be more coherent. We could not rule out potential infections from the community. However, we observed limited transmission from household in our study and the probability of community transmission should be even smaller during the limited period of school outbreaks. Finally, we did not collect specimens for laboratory testing, and therefore we lacked information on the causative virus strain and also may have misclassified HFMD cases due to the variation in the symptoms. During the study period, the main circulating strain in the community was Coxsackievirus A6 which associated with 58% of the outbreaks, followed by Enterovirus 71 15 . Further study is needed to assess potential heterogeneity in the incubation period for different virus strains. With the exception of vaccination against Enterovirus 71, other public health preventive measures against HFMD usually do not consider differences in serotypes. Our results could improve the evidence base for the control of HFMD.",

Statistical analysis. We fitted parametric distributions to the time from infection to the earliest symptom onset of fever, oral ulcer or rash 16 . The exact infection times were not observable but the exposure windows were defined from the symptom onset to the day before sick absence, assuming HFMD cases were infectious only after symptom onset 17 . All potential infectors in the same class were included to construct the exposure windows, assuming limited transmission between different classes. Cases with missing illness onset or absence date, along with subsequent cases in the same class were excluded from the analysis. In other words, only transmissions with complete observation of exposure windows were included in the analysis. Students with earlier HFMD cases in their households were assumed to be infected outside schools, and were included in the analysis only for the exposure to subsequent cases. We also accounted for weekends and school holidays during which there were no exposure in schools. We used maximum likelihood to fit gamma, Weibull and log-normal distributions to the potential incubation intervals and selected the best models using Akaike information criterion (AIC). We estimated the median incubation period for children in kindergartens (aged about 2-5 years), primary (aged about 6-11 years) and secondary schools (aged about 12-18 years) respectively and computed the relevant 95% confidence interval (CI) by the parametric bootstrap approach using 1000 replicates.
