This lack is reflected in the structure of the Introduction and Discussion sections. While the former is confusing and does not follow a clear logical flow, the latter seems to partly repeat the results section (except for few paragraphs, such as page 12 the 1st and 2nd, and page 13, the 3rd), and to partly to state already known. I think that a descriptive analysis might be still valuable, but only if better justified and well described.",

            "text": "Contact chains calculation The second major comment regard the calculation of contact chains. The paragraph reported from Page 7 line 28 to Page 8 line 5 is confusing and it took me a lot to understand how authors calculated the contact chains. In my understanding, they calculate the ICC (and OCC) starting each year from January for 365 days. My concern is that by calculating the contact chains in this way, they overestimate the chains value. For example, if a given farm (#2) receive an animal in February from farm #1, then is inactive for a prolonged time period, and in November sends an animal to farm #3, are farm 1-2-3 in the same chain? Konschake et al (2014, PlosOne) introduced an infection period for the calculation of contacts chains to overcome this issue. In this formulation two contacts needs to happen within the infectious period to be included in the same chain. The authors formulation could work in the context of slow-spreading diseases (i.e. bTB) in the absence of control measures, such as movement restrictions, but not for fast-spreading diseases (i.e. FMD). Another issue with that is the seasonality of movements and \"border effect\". The authors showed that by starting the calculation in different months (over a range of 3 years) results did not changed much. However, this sounds obvious, because the periods with more movements will be caught anyway by the chain, as cattle movement are known to have a marked yearly seasonal behaviour. So, I do not think this issue is addressed correctly. On the other hand, a \"border effect\" could prevent a correct calculation of contact chains. As an example, if I start to calculate the ICC on Jan 1st of a given year and ignore what happened in the last period of the previous year. How do the authors addressed this issue? Finally, in order to combine the information of the ICC and OCC the authors could use the method showed by Rossi et al (2017, Plos Computational Biology) , or at least discuss their results in the light of this. In general, I would refresh the literature on contact chains.",

If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to get in touch. Comments to the Author(s) The manuscript deals with an important aspect of animal disease spread by a relevant approach. However, as the movement of animals via markets is a phenomenon that plays a much more important role in the British isles than elsewhere in Europe, it would be useful for the reader to include some additional text about this. For some diseases, animals meeting at markets/shows (despite biosecurity measures in place) constitutes a major risk of dissemination and it would therefore be of great interest to see all the analyses performed on the dataset with markets and shows included as well as excluded. As this is relevant for 35% of the movements (p5, l46) it is not unimportant. At least, Figure S1 in the supplementary material could be placed next to Figure 2 to illustrate this, and some text added in relevant sections (Methods, Results, Discussion) . Moreover, as bovine TB is referred to (and rightly so), it would be of interest to relate the movement patterns (e.g. the pattern of the GSCC) to the different geographical risk areas for TB or, at least, add some comments about this in the Discussion. I have some minor comments, listed below: P7, L8: directed or direct? P12, L 36-41. The comparison with Sweden needs an added statement that the Swedish cattle trading system doesn't include livestock markets, the similarity is a large number of animals into fattening farms, not a proportion of these via livestock markets. In addition, Swedish fattening herds only sell directly to slaughter. P13, L14-15: \"these\" farms, not this farms P14, L20: rather \"than\" random selection P14, L27-28: perhaps point out that moving infected animals remains the highest risk (other contacts <100%) P15 L 9: it appears that you are hinting that contacts and ICC information should be added to farms' disease status information, this might be pointed out more clearly in the discussion, with pro's and con's of such a system.",

As TB is mentioned as a disease for which the study is relevant, the finding that animal movements increased while TB testing almost stopped entirely is worth commenting on. In many papers the stopped testing has been put forward as the main reason for subsequent increase in TB prevalence and animal movements have not been highlighted. This study demonstrates the importance of movements and it would be a shame not to emphasise it. The many animal movements still resulted in a lower number of edges in 2001, this should also be commented on, the particular aspects of restockning depopulated herds could be elaborated. Some herds with low in-degree and out-degree still had large ICCs and OCCs, this is also worth commenting on (false sense of security?) High ICC's in the North of England is also worth mentioning in connection with TB, as a lot of the low risk area for TB is in the North.",

            "text": "Comments to the Author(s) The paper titled \"Contact chains of cattle farms in Great Britain\" describes the cattle movement network in the study country during a time span of 15 years (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . The authors applied several network analysis metric in order to characterize the 15 yearly networks. Particular attention was given to a metric called \"contact chain\" (in the literature known also as \"infection chain\"), and to the merit of the authors this metrics was rarely used on such extensive datasets, in particular in GB (to my knowledge). The paper has the clear merit to conduct a complete network analysis, including many metrics that can describe the between-farms contact patterns due to animal movements, and to conduct this research through a long time-series. However, novelty elements hardly emerge from both the methods and the discussion/conclusion, since they applied metrics developed by others and already used in the context of livestock networks, and the conclusions are rather well-known in the literature. In fact, the major concern regards the structure and the lack of a sound scientific question to drive the paper.",

            "text": "The second major comment regard the calculation of contact chains. The paragraph reported from Page 7 line 28 to Page 8 line 5 is confusing and it took me a lot to understand how authors calculated the contact chains. In my understanding, they calculate the ICC (and OCC) starting each year from January for 365 days. My concern is that by calculating the contact chains in this way, they overestimate the chains value. For example, if a given farm (#2) receive an animal in February from farm #1, then is inactive for a prolonged time period, and in November sends an animal to farm #3, are farm 1-2-3 in the same chain? Konschake et al (2014, PlosOne) introduced an infection period for the calculation of contacts chains to overcome this issue. In this formulation two contacts needs to happen within the infectious period to be included in the same chain. The authors formulation could work in the context of slow-spreading diseases (i.e. bTB) in the absence of control measures, such as movement restrictions, but not for fast-spreading diseases (i.e. FMD). Another issue with that is the seasonality of movements and \"border effect\". The authors showed that by starting the calculation in different months (over a range of 3 years) results did not changed much. However, this sounds obvious, because the periods with more movements will be caught anyway by the chain, as cattle movement are known to have a marked yearly seasonal behaviour. So, I do not think this issue is addressed correctly. On the other hand, a \"border effect\" could prevent a correct calculation of contact chains. As an example, if I start to calculate the ICC on Jan 1st of a given year and ignore what happened in the last period of the previous year. How do the authors addressed this issue? Finally, in order to combine the information of the ICC and OCC the authors could use the method showed by Rossi et al (2017, Plos Computational Biology) , or at least discuss their results in the light of this. In general, I would refresh the literature on contact chains.",

Is it reasonable that about 450 herds (if I understand the figures correctly) that are classified as fattening herds would not introduce a single animal for 5 years but still qualify as active herds (so there must be outward movements as births would not be expected to occur at any significant rate in fattening herds).

Is it reasonable that about 450 herds (if I understand the figures correctly) that are classified as fattening herds would not introduce a single animal for 5 years but still qualify as active herds (so there must be outward movements as births would not be expected to occur at any significant rate in fattening herds). A brief explanatory comment could be added to this sentence, as it does sound extraordinary to have any number of \"closed\" fattening herds for a longer period.",

These efforts made the manuscript publishable. However, I would suggest a couple of things. First, to make more clear (in the abstract, in particular) that OCC and ICCs calculations are suited to bovine TB. In general, the abstract needs a bit more explanation on the background and the significance of the paper (as an example, one important result to me is that even after excluding markets, some farms act as \"hubs\" anyway). Second, I would also suggest to fix the syntax of some sentences, to improve the readability and the flow of the manuscript (example: lines 19-20 or 84-85, but throughout the text).

However, as the movement of animals via markets is a phenomenon that plays a much more important role in the British isles than elsewhere in Europe, it would be useful for the reader to include some additional text about this. For some diseases, animals meeting at markets/shows (despite biosecurity measures in place) constitutes a major risk of dissemination and it would therefore be of great interest to see all the analyses performed on the dataset with markets and shows included as well as excluded. As this is relevant for 35% of the movements (p5, l46) it is not unimportant. At least, Figure S1 in the supplementary material could be placed next to Figure 2 to illustrate this, and some text added in relevant sections (Methods, Results, Discussion).",

            "text": "The paper titled \"Contact chains of cattle farms in Great Britain\" describes the cattle movement network in the study country during a time span of 15 years (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . The authors applied several network analysis metric in order to characterize the 15 yearly networks. Particular attention was given to a metric called \"contact chain\" (in the literature known also as \"infection chain\"), and to the merit of the authors this metrics was rarely used on such extensive datasets, in particular in GB (to my knowledge). The paper has the clear merit to conduct a complete network analysis, including many metrics that can describe the between-farms contact patterns due to animal movements, and to conduct this research through a long time-series. However, novelty elements hardly emerge from both the methods and the discussion/conclusion, since they applied metrics developed by others and already used in the context of livestock networks, and the conclusions are rather wellknown in the literature. In fact, the major concern regards the structure and the lack of a sound scientific question to drive the paper.",

My concern is that by calculating the contact chains in this way, they overestimate the chains value. For example, if a given farm (#2) receive an animal in February from farm #1, then is inactive for a prolonged time period, and in November sends an animal to farm #3, are farm 1-2-3 in the same chain? Konschake et al (2014, PlosOne) introduced an infection period for the calculation of contacts chains to overcome this issue. In this formulation two contacts needs to happen within the infectious period to be included in the same chain. The authors formulation could work in the context of slowspreading diseases (i.e. bTB) in the absence of control measures, such as movement restrictions, but not for fast-spreading diseases (i.e. FMD).",

The authors showed that by starting the calculation in different months (over a range of 3 years) results did not changed much. However, this sounds obvious, because the periods with more movements will be caught anyway by the chain, as cattle movement are known to have a marked yearly seasonal behaviour. So, I do not think this issue is addressed correctly. On the other hand, a \"border effect\" could prevent a correct calculation of contact chains. As an example, if I start to calculate the ICC on Jan 1st of a given year and ignore what happened in the last period of the previous year. How do the authors addressed this issue? -We have clarified our methods at lines 160-170 to highlight our evaluation of a 36 month period and how it resolves problems associated with a border effect.",

I think this outcome was an example for an excellent interplay between authors and reviewers resulting in a considerable improvement of the paper quality.I finally like you to consider the minor modifications suggested by one of the reviewers, which look to me aiming at even further improving the manuscript and its perception. I leave it to you in how far you like to modify the text in response to the reviewers' suggestions.With kind regards, Dirk Drasdo Thank you. Here are our responses.Reviewer comments to Author: Reviewer: 1Comments to the Author(s) I have only one remaining question, that does not really qualify as a revision. I would suggest to double-check the statement on line 216-217 that 5.4% of fattening herds were closed for the five-year period (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . Is it reasonable that about 450 herds (if I understand the figures correctly) that are classified as fattening herds would not introduce a single animal for 5 years but still qualify as active herds (so there must be outward movements as births would not be expected to occur at any significant rate in fattening herds). A brief explanatory comment could be added to this sentence, as it does sound extraordinary to have any number of \"closed\" fattening herds for a longer period.Text clarified at Lines 238-240) Reviewer: 2Comments to the Author(s) The quality how this manuscript has improved and the authors were able to effectively clarify the purpose of it. These efforts made the manuscript publishable. However, I would suggest a couple of things. First, to make more clear (in the abstract, in particular) that OCC and ICCs calculations are suited to bovine TB.In general, the abstract needs a bit more explanation on the background and the significance of the paper (as an example, one important result to me is that even after excluding markets, some farms act as \"hubs\" anyway).Second, I would also suggest to fix the syntax of some sentences, to improve the readability and the flow of the manuscript (example: lines 19-20 or 84-85, but throughout the text).",
