In the absence of systemic immunodeficiency, decision of NTM lung disease treatment must relies on a careful risk/benefit assessment, given the requirement of long-term administration of multidrug therapies supported by limited evidence. The primary objective was to identify the factors associated with anti-NTM treatment initiation. Clinical and radiological outcome upon treatment were studied. Methods: This retrospective, single center study (2013)(2014)(2015)(2016) 45 months) addressed the criteria supporting treatment decision among adults with NTM lung disease without systemic immunodeficiency at our institution, with the assigned goal to harmonize the practice. All patients matched the current international definitions of NTM lung disease according to the American Thoracic Society criteria. Factors associated with anti-NTM treatment were investigated by conditional logistic regression. Clinical and radiological outcomes of treated and untreated NTMdisease cases were examined. Mortality rate was assessed. An expert radiologist conducted a blinded computed tomography (CT)-scan review of the treated and untreated patients.",

Prevalence of NTM lung diseases is unexpectedly increasing in industrialized countries, as consistently uncovered by recent studies [3, 4] . The key issue remains to determine whether NTM are the true and single promoter of an evolving lung disease or chronic airway colonizers, among others. To standardize the diagnosis of NTM lung disease, the guidelines for NTM diagnosis of the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and the British Thoracic Society (BTS) require isolation and growth of the same NTM strain on at least two separate samples from the patient [5, 6] .",

Exclusion criteria were HIV infection, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, active malignant disease, solid-organ transplantation or ongoing immunosuppressant treatments such as TNF inhibitor or high-dose corticosteroid (\u2265 1 mg/kg more than 21 days). Case identification was based on cross-referencing the databases of the mycobacteria laboratory and the departments of infectious and pulmonary diseases. Patients eligible for inclusion in the NTM lung disease cohort were those who matched the criteria previously defined by the ATS/IDSA and the BTS guidelines with the minimum requirement of clinical and microbiologic following criteria: (i) pulmonary symptoms associated with multifocal bronchiectasis with multiple small nodules on computed tomography (CT)-scan; (ii) proper exclusion of other diagnoses; (iii) NTM-positive culture results from at least two separate expectorated sputum samples or a NTM-positive culture result from at least one bronchial wash or lavage [5, 6] . Patients' characteristics at diagnosis were collected in order to perform analysis on 146 selected variables: demographics; history of predisposing factors; underlying pulmonary diseases; comorbidities; pulmonary function testing; respiratory bacterial or mycological co-infection(s), which definition was similar to NTM criteria, namely positive culture isolation of the same species from at least two separate expectorated sputum samples or a positive culture result from at least one bronchial wash or lavage; immunologic status; nutritional status; clinical features; microbiologic assessment through identification of NTM species on positive NTM cultures and sample culture conversions; radiologic features on high-resolution CT-scans (fibrocavitary disease or nodular/bronchiectasis disease); prior treatment for NTM lung disease, treatment combination and duration; outcome. Because of the retrospective observational nature of the study and the lack of any modification in patients' management, the need for informed consent was waived with the authorization of the Ethics Committee of Lyon University Hospital (Comit\u00e9 d'Ethique, Hospices Civils de Lyon), which approved the study under the number 17-207.",

            "text": "Here, three out of four criteria are part of guideline criteria leading to decision of anti-NTM treatment. They all reflect a degree of severity of NTM lung disease linked with progression of an impaired respiratory condition. The current problematic of NTM lung diseases shifts from distinguishing colonization from infection toward differentiating stable, poorly active vs. progressive active NTM disease, the latter being responsible for further structural lung damage(s). The risk/benefit analysis includes prescribing recommended long-term multidrug regimens with concerns over suboptimal cure rates and frequently reported drug-related side effects. To support these arguments, others have already shown that physician ATS/IDSA guideline [10] . Another study conducted in France has shown that among a cohort of 31 NTM lung diseases, only 12 (38.7%) received appropriate treatment matching ATS/IDSA guidelines [11] . Inappropriate prescriptions were mostly related to shorter treatment duration (6 months or less) and/or off-recommendation regimen, particularly those excluding macrolide from the combination or those using a single-drug macrolide regimen [10, 11] . It has to be acknowledged that guidelines specify that treatment for MAC-associated lung disease in HIV-negative individuals can be a three-times-weekly drug regimen upon culture conversion while on therapy for 1 year, which may favor treatment compliance [5, 12, 13] . Patients with bronchiectasis and NTM lung disease have a higher prevalence of being sensitized to Aspergillus than patients with NTM-free bronchiectasis [12] . Allergic airway manifestations in response to Aspergillus are termed Aspergillus-related lung diseases with a spectrum going from Aspergillus-induced hypersensitivity to the severe allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) [14] . By itself, the coexistence of NTM and Aspergillus in lung airway justifies the need for testing Aspergillus serology, total serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E and Aspergillus-specific IgE levels as well as mycological direct examination and culture of sputum or bronchial aspirates for presence of filamentous fungi in the diagnosis algorithm of patients with NTM lung diseases. Active co-infections with NTM and Aspergillus spp. have also been described, in which patients with NTM lung disease develop chronic forms of pulmonary aspergillosis which definitions and management have been revisited in recent updated guidelines [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

A previous study has investigated radiologic response to treatment showing consistent results with those found in the present study. Although anti-NTM treatment led to an improvement or stabilization of lesions for a majority of patients, these modifications were not significantly different from the untreated group who went through CT-scan follow up indicating that anti-NTM treatment did not lead to radiological abnormalities reversion [9] . The present study has strengths and limitations. The strength is the study of the largest cohort so far of NTM lung diseases in patients without systemic immunodeficiency with exhaustive data collection and blinded radiological assessment. We acknowledge the biases that contribute to mitigate conclusions from the study such as being conducted in a single center, the important differences in physician's management resulting in lack of consistency in treatment decision making, the number of missing data. In addition, the CT-scans were not performed at fixed intervals, particularly in the untreated subset of patients. Finally, treatment duration and outcome criteria were not standardized, which prevent to properly assess treatment efficacy. Useful consensus definitions for key outcome parameters to be used in the treatment of NTM lung diseases have been released very recently, which should harmonize data collection regarding NTM treatment [18] .",

Median anti-NTM treatment duration was 36.3 (IQR, 13.1-64.4) weeks. Thirteen (52%) of the treated patients developed at least one antimicrobial-related adverse event, among which gastrointestinal disorders (n = 6), impaired blood cell count (n = 5) and cholestatic and/or cytolytic hepatitis (n = 4). According to physician judgment, clinical stabilization and improvement was obtained for 8 (34.8%) and 12 (52.2%) of treated patients, respectively. Patient's median follow-up from diagnosis assessment was 17.1 (IQR, 8.7-27.1) months. Eighty-five CT-scans were reviewed for comparative assessment after treatment or over the course of follow-up in the untreated subset. The median interval between the initiation of NTM treatment and the date of the assessed images was 56.7 (IQR, 43.3-97.7) weeks. Although 34.8% (n = 8) and 39.1% (n = 9) experienced regression or stabilization of their pulmonary lesions in the treated patients, these rates did not differ from the untreated patients with 30.8% (n = 4) and 46.2% (n = 6) of regression and stabilization over the course of their follow-up, respectively",
