            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children under the age of 5 years. Almost 2 million children die from ARTIs each year, and most of them are from developing countries. The prevalence and correlation of pathogens in ARTIs are poorly understood, but are critical for improving case prevention, treatment, and management. In this study, we investigated the prevalence and correlation of infectious agents in children with ARTIs. A total of 39,756 children with one or more symptoms, including fever, cough, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, herpangina, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis, were enrolled in the study. All patients were hospitalized in Wuhan Children's Hospital between October 1, 2010 and September 30, 2012, and were evaluated for infectious agents. Pathogens, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii, were screened simultaneously in patient blood samples using anti-pathogen IgM tests. Regression analysis was used to reveal correlations among the pathogens. Our results showed that one or more pathogens were identified in 10,206 patients, and that Mycoplasma pneumoniae, adenoviruses, and influenza B virus were the leading infectious agents. Mixed-infections of pathogens were detected in 2,391 cases, with Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the most frequent pathogen. The most common agents in the co-infections were Mycoplasma pneumoniae and influenza B virus. Regression analysis revealed a linear correlation between the proportion of mixed infections and the incidence of multi-pathogen infections. The prevalence of infectious agents in children with ARTIs was determined. Equations were established to estimate multiple infections by single-pathogen detection. This revealed a linear correlation for pathogens in children with ARTIs. This study provides useful information for improving case prevention and management.",

Recent studies showed that atypical pathogens are also important cause of LRTI resulting in mild to life threatening illness, which should be obtained more attention. The most common atypical pathogens include Mycoplasma pneumonia (M. pneumophila), Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C. pneumonia) and respiratory viruses [2] . These atypical pathogens were listed as common agents of CAP in American Community-acquired Pneumonia Diagnosis and treatment guidelines in Adult (2007) and Chinese Community-acquired Pneumonia Management Guidelines in Children (trial, 2007) .",

M. pneumoniae is a frequent cause of hospitalization among children as young as 2 years of age and can even necessitate ventilatory assistance. L. pneumophila can occur across all age groups, but C. pneumoniae has emerged as an important cause of pneumonia in both adults and children as young as 2 years old. Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii) is the etiologic agent of Q fever, a known pathogen that causes fever, pneumonia, and intravascular infections [5, 6] . Studies of CAP have traditionally focused little on viral causes [2] . Currently, viral infections are also involved with 80% of episodes of CAP in children under 2 years old and over 40% of older children [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The existing studies have showed that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses (Flu) are important pathogens among the hospitalized and outpatient children presenting with ARTI [5, 6] .Adenovirus virus (ADV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) are also associated with a substantial proportion of ALRI in infants and young children [7] [8] [9] .",

In addition, the appropriate sample is critical for the aetiologic diagnosis. Sputum, representing lower-airway secretions, can rarely be obtained from children [2, 7] . New rapid detection of multiple viruses and bacteria has been developed lately [8, 9] . IgM antibody first appeared in the process of infection, but the last time not long. So it was regarded as diagnostic criteria of early infection. Specific IgM appeared in one week, peak within three weeks after infections, thus more valuable for early diagnosis in children based on Chinese Expert Consensus of Diagnosis and Treatment of Mycoplasma Pneumoniae in Children.",

The median age of children with RSV infections was lower than of those with other infections. The most frequent age range of children with ARTIs was 0-5 months, accounting for 25.3% of all enrolled cases; the least frequent ages were those >9 years (3.4%). The rate of respiratory infections was much higher in children older than 1 year compared with younger children [\u03c7 2 = 2786.9, P<0.001]. M. pneumoniae occurred frequently in all age groups but was more frequent in children older than 1 year. RSV and AdV infections were much more frequent than other viruses in children younger than 1 year and decreased with age; 66.4% of RSV infections and 65.0% of AdV infections occurred in children younger than 2 years old. IBV was more frequent in children older than 1 year. C. pneumonia and C. burnetii were infrequent among all age groups. another, the functions were y = 0.848+1.005x 1 (R 2 = 0.901) and y = \u22124.025+ \u22120.215x 2 (R 2 = 0.738) (Fig. 3A) . The linear correlation remained in dual infections, with the functions y = \u22120.191+0.957x 1 (R 2 = 0.886) and y = \u22124.792-0.205x 2 (R 2 = 0.731) (Fig. 3B) .

Since quadruple infections were only confirmed in 19 patients, the above regression relationship could not be confirmed in cases infected with four pathogens simultaneously. We compared the R 2 values for the two types of equation and found that the representativeness of the functions for y and x 1 was higher than that for y and x 2. We therefore selected x 1 as the independent variable for further analysis. ANOVA demonstrated no significant difference among various k coefficients for different agents, seasons, and age groups (Fig. 4) .",

M. pneumoniae, IBV, and AdV were the predominant agents. Multi-pathogen infections were also detected, with M. pneumoniae as the most frequently involved agent. The most common pathogens in co-infections were M. pneumoniae and IBV. Regression analysis showed a linear correlation between the percentage of co-infections and the proportion of each agent in the co-infection. We showed that M. pneumoniae is a major cause of respiratory infections in school-age children and young adults. Recent reports from several European countries have indicated an increase in the detection of M. pneumoniae infection over the past few years, notably in children aged 4-15 years [14] [15] [16] [17] . M. pneumoniae infection accounted for 32.3% cases of respiratory infection in Wuhan, China [18] . In most studies, RSV was the leading cause of respiratory tract infections, especially in hospitalized infants less than 6 months of age [19] [20] [21] . In agreement with these studies, RSV was detected in only 2% of cases in this study. Influenza viral infections were also common, in that 18.1% of cases were caused by these viruses, with IBV as the major agent. Generally speaking, simultaneous IAV and IBV infections were prevalent during the study period [22, 23] . However, IAV has been reported to be the more frequent agent [24] , and IBV epidemics occur in approximately 3-to 4-year cycles [25] . AdV infections were also found in respiratory tract infections. Several studies in China revealed that the proportion of AdV infections is increasing [26] [27] [28] . In this study, AdV was detected in 4.8% of ARTIs in children less than 16 years of age. This finding suggests that AdV is an important pathogen of ARTIs in inpatients in Wuhan that should receive more attention.",

The mechanism of multi-pathogen infections is still not clear. Some studies suggest that extensive damage to the epithelium of the respiratory tract in some viral ARTIs might promote superinfection by another virus [38] . Whether infection by one agent facilitates infection of the same pathogen or other pathogens in cells is still uncertain. We revealed a linear relationship between the proportion of mixed infections and the incidence of multi-pathogens infections. The k coefficients showed no significant differences according to pathogen, month, or age group. We may use the k coefficient as a constant in further studies. Our study supports the hypothesis that the proportion of the specific pathogen, rather than the pathogen itself, is relevant for co-infections.",

It was proposed that effective treatment for severe ARTIs will ultimately require identification of all involved pathogens [37] . Because routine identification of the causative agent in patients with respiratory infections is not cost-effective, information regarding mixed pathogen infections is lacking [42, 43, 44] . If further studies confirm that the linear relationship is also relevant to other pathogens or diseases in various regions, we will be able to estimate multiple infections by single-pathogen detection. However, the formula will work best for large samples. Nonetheless, it will help clinicians and researchers involved in the treatment, prevention, and control of ARTI.",
