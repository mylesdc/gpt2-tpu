            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates its DNA genome through reverse transcription of a viral RNA pregenome. We report herein that the interferon (IFN) stimulated exoribonuclease gene of 20 KD (ISG20) inhibits HBV replication through degradation of HBV RNA. ISG20 expression was observed at basal level and was highly upregulated upon IFN treatment in hepatocytes, and knock down of ISG20 resulted in elevation of HBV replication and attenuation of IFN-mediated antiviral effect. The sequence element conferring the susceptibility of HBV RNA to ISG20-mediated RNA degradation was mapped at the HBV RNA terminal redundant region containing epsilon (\u03b5) stem-loop. Furthermore, ISG20-induced HBV RNA degradation relies on its ribonuclease activity, as the enzymatic inactive form ISG20 D94G was unable to promote HBV RNA decay. Interestingly, ISG20 D94G retained antiviral activity against HBV DNA replication by preventing pgRNA encapsidation, resulting from a consequence of ISG20-\u03b5 interaction. This interaction was further characterized by in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and ISG20 was able to bind HBV \u03b5 directly in absence of any other cellular proteins, indicating a direct \u03b5 RNA binding capability of ISG20; however, cofactor(s) may be required for ISG20 to efficiently degrade \u03b5. In addition, the lower stem portion of \u03b5 is the major ISG20 binding site, and the removal of 4 base pairs from the bottom portion of \u03b5 abrogated the sensitivity of HBV RNA to ISG20, suggesting that the specificity of ISG20-\u03b5 interaction relies on both RNA structure and sequence. Furthermore, the C-terminal Exonuclease III (ExoIII) domain of ISG20 was determined to be responsible for interacting with \u03b5, as the deletion of ExoIII abolished in vitro ISG20-\u03b5 binding and intracellular HBV RNA degradation. Taken together, our study sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of IFN-mediated HBV inhibition and the antiviral mechanism of ISG20 in general. R, et al.

ISG20, an antiviral RNase induced by interferons, inhibits the replication of many RNA viruses but the underlying molecular antiviral mechanism remains elusive. Since all the known viruses, except for prions, have RNA products in their life cycles, ISG20 can be a broad spectrum antiviral protein; but in order to distinguish viral RNA from host RNA, ISG20 may have evolved to recognize virus-specific signals as its antiviral target. We demonstrated herein that ISG20 selectively binds to a unique stem-loop structure called epsilon (\u03b5) in all HBV RNA species and degrades viral RNA to inhibit HBV replication. Because \u03b5 is the HBV pregenomic RNA packaging signal and reverse transcription priming site, the binding of ISG20 to \u03b5, even in the absence of ribonuclease activity, results in antiviral effect to prevent DNA replication due to preventing viral polymerase binding to pgRNA. We also determined the structure and sequence requirements of \u03b5 RNA and ISG20 protein for ISG20-\u03b5 binding and antiviral activity. Such information will aid the function study of ISG20 against viral pathogens in host innate defense, and ISG20 has potentials to be developed into a therapeutic agent for viral diseases including hepatitis B.

A similar antiviral effect of ISG20 was also observed in Huh7 cells ( Fig  2B) . Furthermore, the ISG20-mediated pgRNA reduction is dose dependent (S1 Fig) and not due to a possible cytotoxicity effect caused by ISG20 overexpression (S2 Fig). In addition, along with pgRNA reduction, the levels of 2.4 kb and 2.1 kb HBV surface mRNA, which share 100% sequence identity with the 3' portion of pgRNA, were also reduced upon ISG20 expression (Fig 2, top panels) . The reduction of HBV 2.4/2.1 kb RNA by ISG20 was further confirmed by co-transfection of ISG20 and plasmid pLMS expressing HBV subgenomic surface mRNA in HepG2 cells (S3A Fig).

            "text": "HBV is the prototype member of hepadnaviridae family which contains a number of DNA viruses replicating their genome through reverse transcription of a viral RNA intermediate in hepatocytes. After cell infection mediated by the viral receptor, called sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) [2] , the 3.2kb relaxed circular (rc) viral DNA genome in the virion enters the nucleus and transforms into a nucleosome-decorated covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA minichromosome. Using cccDNA as transcription template, five viral mRNAs are transcribed from different transcription initiation sites but all terminated at a same polyadenylation site, which are, 3.5~3.6 kb precore mRNA, 3.5 kb pregenomic (pg) RNA, 2.4 and 2.1 kb surface (envelope) mRNA, and 0.7kb X mRNA. Besides serving as the template for translation of viral core protein and polymerase (pol), the pgRNA is also the template for reverse transcription. The pol recognizes a stem loop structure (epsilon, \u03b5) at the 5' terminus of pgRNA to recruit core proteins to encapsidate pol/pgRNA complex into nucleocapsid, where the reverse transcription takes place to yield progeny viral rcDNA [3] . Considering the importance of viral RNA in HBV life cycle, it is conceivable that HBV RNA reduction will result in a suppression of both viral DNA replication and antigen production. Therefore, hijacking HBV RNA is believed to be an important antiviral strategy for host defense against HBV. In line with this, interferons are able to directly reduce HBV RNA through both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms [4] [5] [6] [7] . In terms of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), the tripartite motif-containing protein 22 (TRIM22) and DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3 have been shown to inhibit HBV RNA transcription [8, 9] , and the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) have been identified as host intrinsic antiviral factors against HBV through promoting the decay of HBV RNA [10, 11] .",

This protein, which has been shown to be induced by both type I and type II IFNs, belongs to DEDDh subgroup of the DEDD exonuclease superfamily. Sequence homologies are distributed at three distinct motifs termed as ExoI (a.a7-16), ExoII (a.a 86-101) and ExoIII (a.a 147-157) [12] . ISG20 is a 3' to 5' exonuclease with the substrate preference of single-stranded RNA over double-stranded RNA or single-stranded DNA. Its enzymatic activity is mediated by the ExoII motif, as substitution of the Aspartic acid 94 (D94) in the ExoII motif to Glycine (D94G) completely abolishes its exonuclease activity [13] . Cellular proteins may be involved in regulation of ISG20 in substrate recognition and/or binding in order to avoid any non-specific cell toxicity, however which remain to be identified. ISG20 has been shown playing an important role in host antiviral innate immune defense [14] . It is a key ISG against alphavirus replication in host antiviral defense mediated via IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling [15] . Cells with overexpressed ISG20 are resistant to the infections of RNA viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza virus, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), hepatitis A and C virus (HAV and HCV), yellow fever virus, and HIV, but not to a DNA virus, adenovirus [16] [17] [18] .",

To test these possibilities, we recovered the HBV plasmid DNA from the transfected cells by Hirt DNA extraction, followed by Dpn I digestion and Southern blot analysis. The result showed that the levels of input HBV plasmid DNA recovered from whole cells were equal in the absence or presence of ISG20, as revealed by Dpn I-digested fragments (S4A Fig, top panel) . Furthermore, while ISG20 overexpression reduced HBV core DNA replication in cytoplasm, it did not affect the level of remaining cytoplasmic HBV plasmid DNA (S4A Fig, middle panel) , further confirming that ISG20 does not alter the stability and distribution of the input HBV plasmid. In addition, ISG20 transfection in HBV stable cell line HepDES19 cells also resulted in the reduction of HBV RNA, which were transcribed from the integrated HBV DNA (S4B Fig) . Collectively, these results clearly exclude any negative effect of ISG20 on the stability of HBV RNA transcription template, which is consistent with the reported inability of ISG20 to degrade double stranded DNA substrate in vitro [13] . Next, in order to determine whether ISG20-mediated down-regulation of HBV RNA via transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanism, we first assessed the potential effect of ISG20 on viral promoter activity. As shown in S5 Fig, the luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that ISG20 did not significantly affect the activities of HBV Enhancer II/Core (EnII/ Cp) promoter, S2 promoter, or CMV-IE promoter, but even enhanced HBV S1 promoter activity. Therefore, it is unlikely that ISG20 reduces HBV RNA through inhibiting viral promoter activity at the transcriptional level.",

Briefly, ISG20 expression vector or control empty vector was transfected into the inducible HBV stable cell line HepDES19 cells in the absence of tetracycline (tet) to induce HBV pgRNA transcription and ISG20 expression; 36 h later, tet was added back to shut down the de novo pgRNA transcription from the transgene, and after that, the levels of HBV RNA at different time points were analyzed by Northern blot (Fig 3A) . The representative Northern blot demonstrated that the levels of HBV RNA in HepDES19 cells overexpressing ISG20 at each time point were less than that in the control group, suggesting that ISG20 promotes HBV RNA degradation. This is consistent with the previous observations that ISG20 functions as the 3'-5' riboexonuclease to degrade single-stranded viral RNA genomes [14, 16] . It is worth noting that not every HBV RNA-containing HepDES19 cells were transfected by ISG20, therefore, the actual effect of ISG20 on HBV RNA stability ought to be stronger than observed in this experiment. To further quantitatively validate the observed enhancement of HBV RNA degradation by ISG20, we transfected HepG2 cells with tetracycline-inducible HBV expression vector pTREHBVDES and plasmid pTet-off expressing the tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activator (tTA), together with either control vector or ISG20 plasmid. In this way, both HBV RNA and ISG20 coexisted in same cells. Four days later, similarly to the above experiment in HepDES19 cells, tetracycline was added back to block new round of pgRNA transcription, and the time course HBV RNA level was quantified by qPCR. As shown in Fig 3B, the regular half-life of intracellular HBV RNA was approximately 6 h, which is consistent with previous measurements [10, 23] , but the decay kinetics of HBV RNA was much faster in cells transfected with ISG20, of which the HBV RNA half-life was much less than 3 h, suggesting that ISG20 promotes HBV RNA decay. Hence, we conclude that ISG20-mediated HBV RNA reduction is primarily through downregulation of HBV RNA stability.",

It was therefore of interest to assess the antiviral activity of endogenous ISG20 against HBV infection under its basal and induced levels. Firstly, we performed the test in HBV stable cell line HepDES19 [24] . As shown in Fig 4, knock down of ISG20 expression in the absence of IFN-\u03b1 treatment resulted in a marked upregulation of the steady state levels of HBV total RNA, encapsidated pgRNA, and DNA (comparing lane 4 to lane l). The observed relatively greater upregulation of core DNA than viral RNA upon knock down of ISG20 might be due to the longer lifespan of DNA. When the cells were treated with IFN-\u03b1, ISG20 was upregulated, and viral RNA and DNA were reduced, in an IFN dose-dependent manner (lanes 1-3). It is worth to note that the IFN-elicited reduction of HBV RNA in HepDES19 cells was less profound than in HBV-transfected cells with ISG20 overexpression (compared Fig 4 to Fig  2) . Such difference might be due to the reported weak response of hepatoma cells to IFN treatment [25] , and/or the potential unknown negative regulator(s) of ISG20 co-induced by IFN. Nonetheless, in the cells treated with IFN-\u03b1 and ISG20 siRNA, the levels of HBV RNA were restored to the untreated control level (comparing lanes 5 and 6 to lanes 1-3), suggesting that ISG20 plays a major role in IFN-mediated reduction of HBV RNA in HepDES19 cells. However, neither viral RNA nor DNA reached their levels in cells treated with ISG20 siRNA only (comparing lanes 5 and 6 to lane 4), indicating that other ISGs are involved in IFN-mediated suppression of HBV DNA replication at multiple steps.",

            "text": "Next, we assessed the antiviral function of ISG20 in an HBV in vitro infection system, specifically, the viral receptor NTCP reconstituted HepG2 cells [26] . The endogenous ISG20 in HepG2-NTCP12 cells was stably inhibited through lentiviral shRNA transduction. The obtained ISG20 knock down cell line and control knock down cell line were then infected with HBV and treated with or without IFN-\u03b1. As shown in Fig 5A, the basal ISG20 expression was successfully knocked down in HepG2-NTCP12-shISG20 cells (comparing lane 3 to lane1), and IFN-\u03b1 significantly upregulated ISG20 expression in the HepG2-NTCP12-shcontrol cells (comparing lane 2 to lane1), but only slightly induced ISG20 in the HepG2-NTCP12-shISG20 cells (comparing lane 4 to lane3). Then the outcomes of HBV infection were analyzed. The HBcAg immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that knock down of ISG20 resulted in a higher percentage of HBV positive cells when compared to control cells without or with IFN-\u03b1 treatment ( Fig 5B) . Because that the ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation will lead to an overall suppression of the entire HBV life cycle in the infection system, we infer that the increased percentage of core staining-positive cell number in HBV infected HepG2-NTCP-shISG20 cells is a combinational end effect of increased viral protein expression, DNA replication, and cccDNA synthesis, plus the possible higher virus spread rate. Since HBV RNA is a transfected with 4 \u03bcg of control vector or plasmid F-ISG20 for 36 h, then tet was added back to the culture medium to shut down pgRNA transcription. Cells were harvested at indicated time points. HBV RNA was extracted from harvested samples and analyzed by Northern blot. Expression of FLAG-tagged ISG20 was detected by Western blot. The results are representative of three separate trials. (B) HepG2 cells in 12-wellplate were co-transfected with 0.7 \u03bcg of pTREHBVDES and 0.1 \u03bcg of pTet-off, plus 0.7 \u03bcg of control vector or plasmid F-ISG20. Four days post transfection, tet was added back and cells were harvested at indicated time points and subjected to HBV RNA qPCR analysis. The relative levels of HBV total RNA normalized to \u03b2-actin mRNA levels in each samples were expressed as the percentage of the RNA levels from the corresponding sample at 0 h time point (Mean \u00b1 SD, n = 4). The half-life of HBV RNA was marked on the plot. HepDES19 cells were transfected with 100 nM of control siRNA (Lane 1-3) or ISG20 siRNA (siISG20) (lane 4-6) twice with a 24 h interval after tet being withdrawn. Culture medium was replaced 12 h after the 2nd siRNA transfection, and cells were either left untreated as controls (lane 1 &4) or treated with 100 IU/ml (lanes 2 & 5) or 1,000 IU/ml (lanes 3 & 6) of IFN-\u03b1. Cells were harvested 5 days after 2nd transfection. Viral total RNA (top panel), encapsidated pgRNA (upper middle panel), and core DNA (lower middle panel) were subjected to Northern and Southern analyses, respectively. ISG20 protein expression was revealed by Western blot, and \u03b2-actin served as loading control (bottom panels). The relative levels of viral nucleic acids and ISG20 more convincing marker for HBV infection and the authentic antiviral target of ISG20, the qPCR assay of HBV total RNA from the infected cells further demonstrated that IFN-\u03b1 is able to reduce HBV RNA in infected cells, and knocking down of ISG20 greatly favors HBV infection in both IFN-treated and untreated cells (Fig 5C) . Consistent with the observations in HepDES19 cells (Fig 4) , inhibition of ISG20 significantly but partially abrogated the overall antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b1 in HBV infected cells (Fig 5B and 5C) , presumably due to the induction of other antiviral ISGs. Collectively, the above data suggested that ISG20 serves as a host intrinsic restriction factor to limit HBV infection under both basal expression and cytokine induction. ISG20-mediated HBV RNA decay depends on its ribonuclease activity ISG20 has three putative exonuclease domains and it has been reported that a single D94G mutation in the Exo II domain completely abolished the protein's enzymatic activity in vitro [13] . In line with this, we found that the enzymatic inactive mutant F-ISG20 D94G failed to expression in the siISG20 transfected or IFN-\u03b1 treated samples (lanes 2-6) are expressed as the percentage of the control sample (lane 1). The data presented here are representative of two independent experiments. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006296.g004 The antiviral effect of ISG20 in HBV infection system. HepG2-NTCP12 cells stably transduced by control lentiviral shRNA (shcontrol) or ISG20 lentiviral shRNA (shISG20) were spinoculated with HBV at 100 vge/cell. 16 h later, the infected cells were mock treated or treated with 1,000 IU/ml of IFN-\u03b1 for 6 days, and the cells were subjected to the following analyses: (A) The expression of ISG20 was analyzed by Western blot. (B) HBV infectivity was assessed by HBcAg immunofluorescence, and the percentage of HBcAg-positive cells were calculated from multiple microscopic field of view (mean\u00b1SD, n = 5). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. (C) HBV total RNA were quantified by qPCR and the relative expression levels to \u03b2-actin mRNA were plotted as fold change to control samples (HBV infected shcontrol cells without IFN-\u03b1 treatment) (mean\u00b1SD, n = 3).",

Interestingly, although the levels of total viral RNA and capsid remained the same, the level of encapsidated HBV pgRNA was significantly reduced under the expression of ISG20 D94G mutant (middle panel, comparing lanes 5&6 to 1&2), which consequently led to the inhibition of viral DNA replication (bottom panels). The inhibitory effect of ISG20 D94G on pgRNA encapsidation was further confirmed with HBV genome harboring polymerase Y63D mutation, which supports HBV pgRNA binding and encapsidation but not DNA replication (S6 Fig) Since HBV pgRNA encapsidation requires the dynamic interactions among three viral components, specifically the pgRNA, Pol, and core protein [27] , it is possible that ISG20 D94G might be antagonizing one or more of these three viral factors to block encapsidation. However, ISG20 D94G did not inhibit capsid assembly (Fig 6, 3rd panel from the top), and ISG20mediated HBV RNA degradation does not rely on viral core or pol protein (S7 Fig) . Based on these data, we hypothesized that ISG20 might physically bind to HBV RNA for degradation, and thus in the particular case of ISG20 D94G , its association with pgRNA inhibited the binding of HBV polymerase to pgRNA and the subsequent pgRNA encapsidation.",

Since ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation relies on TR sequence (Fig 9) and ISG20 D94G competes with Pol for HBV RNA binding (Fig 8) , it is therefore of immediate interest to investigate whether ISG20 also directly binds on HBV \u03b5 to exert its antiviral functions. To this end, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was employed. As shown in Fig 10, purified recombinant His-tagged ISG20 proteins were incubated with 5' radiolabeled HBV \u03b5 RNA in vitro and the protein/RNA complexes were analyzed via the mobility shifting of the RNA in the native polyacrylamide gel. The proper folding of stem-loop structure of \u03b5 RNA was confirmed by recombinant Pol/\u03b5 complex formation as detected in the EMSA assay (S9 Fig). Interestingly, in the absence of other cellular proteins, His-ISG20 could directly, dose-dependently bind on \u03b5 RNA, shown as the shift bands in Fig 10C (lanes 3, 5, 7) , and the binding specificity between His-ISG20 and \u03b5 was confirmed by the His-antibody(Ab) /His-ISG20/\u03b5 super-complex formation detected as a super-shift in EMSA (lanes 4, 6, 8). Competition of ISG20 binding to the radiolabeled \u03b5 RNA by excess amount of cold \u03b5 probes indicated again that ISG20 specifically binds to HBV \u03b5 (lanes 9, 10, 11). It is of note that the incubation of ISG20 and \u03b5 RNA during EMSA was performed in protein/RNA binding buffer without manganese, an essential ion for the enzymatic activity of ISG20 [13] , therefore the degradation of \u03b5 RNA, if any could occur, would not be observed in this binding assay.",

To further determine the binding position within the lower stem and bulge region, the bulge sequences were mutated or the lower stem were truncated from the bottom (Fig 11A) , and used as probes in EMSA. Interestingly, we found that the loop (or bulge) sequence is not critical for ISG20 binding as long as the lower stem is intact; however the bottom 4 base-pairs of the stem is indispensable for ISG20 binding (Fig 11C) . To further confirm the requirement of these 4 base-pairs for ISG20 to carry out its biological functions, we disrupted the base pairing at the bottom of \u03b5 stem-loop in HBV 2.1 kb surface mRNA by removing 4 nucleotides from the 3' end of \u03b5 coding sequence, and found that the mutant RNA became resistant to the HBV core promoter. pA is the polyadenylation site.

Collectively, these findings imply that ISG20 recognizes sequence-specific secondary structure of HBV \u03b5 for RNA binding and degradation. Mechanism of ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation Exo III domain mediates the binding of ISG20 to \u03b5 Since ISG20 is able to bind on its RNA substrate directly in the absence of any other cellular or viral proteins, it is therefore of interest to investigate which domain of ISG20 is responsible for RNA binding. Three distinct exonuclease motifs, namely Exo I (a.a7-16), Exo II (a.a 86-101) and Exo III (a.a 147-157), have been predicted in ISG20 protein sequence from previous studies [14, 30] (Fig 12A) . Based on that, the recombinant mutant ISG20 proteins with each Exo domain deletion or Exo II D94G mutation were tested for \u03b5 binding activity by EMSA. As shown in Fig 12B and 12C , in comparison to wildtype ISG20, deletion of Exo I or Exo II did not reduce, but even increased the binding affinity of ISG20 with \u03b5 (lanes 2-4); however ISG20 with Exo III deletion completely lost the binding activity (lane 5), indicating that the Exo III is the functional binding domain of ISG20 for its RNA substrate. In addition, the enzymatically inactive D94G mutant retains its function for \u03b5 binding (lane 6), which is consistent with the observed association of ISG20 D94G with HBV RNA and subsequent inhibition of pgRNA encapsidation in cells (Figs 6-8) . It is worth noting that the \u0394Exo I and \u0394Exo II deletion mutants, as well as the ISG20 D94G mutant, exhibited altered mobility compared to wildtype ISG20 in the gel shift assay (Fig 12C, lane 2 vs. lanes 3, 4, 6) . While it is predictable that the faster mobility of \u0394Exo I:\u03b5 and \u0394Exo II:\u03b5 complexes is likely due to the protein's lower molecular weight (MW), the lower shift of ISG20 D94G :\u03b5 complex is probably because that such RNP complex exhibits a different structural conformation compared to the ISG20:\u03b5 complex.",

The previous biochemistry study has demonstrated that ISG20 catalyzes RNA degradation in vitro in a manganese-dependent manner [13] . As shown in Fig 13, under the reaction condition that supports ISG20 ribonuclease activity [13] , a wide spectrum endoribonuclease RNase A efficiently degraded \u03b5 RNA as a positive control (panel A and B, lanes 1-3) . However, ISG20 exhibited much less efficiency to degrade the full length \u03b5 RNA substrate (panel A and B, lanes 1, 4-5), and other two stem-loop subdomains (US+L, LS+B) (panel A, lanes 6-11), suggesting that ISG20 alone does not favor RNA with secondary structures for degradation. Such observation is consistent with a previous study showing that ISG20 operated poorly on doublestranded regions of RNA substrate in vitro [13] . In line with these, we found that ISG20 was able to catalyze the degradation of RNA substrate derived from the left arm of \u03b5 (panel B, lanes 6-8), which is lack of secondary structures. Furthermore, ISG20 efficiently degraded the single-stranded linear 30-mer poly(rA) oligo in vitro (panel B, lane 11), confirming that the recombinant ISG20 protein used in the assay was enzymatically active. As a control, RNase A was unable to degrade poly(rA) because it only cleaves RNA string at the 3\u00b4end of pyrimidine (rC or U) residues (panel B, lane 10) [31] . Since the RNA substrates were 5' radiolabeled, the pattern of degradation intermediates generated by ISG20 is consistent with the 3'-5' exoribonuclease activity of ISG20 (panel B, lanes 7, 8, 11) . Collectively, the above in vitro data indicate that other host cofactor(s) may be required to coordinate with ISG20 for the observed efficient HBV RNA degradation in cells.",

The selectivity of ISG20 for HBV RNA is determined by a unique viral ribonucleotide string that shapes a stem-loop structure (\u03b5) which exists in all HBV RNA species. ISG20 directly binds to the lower stem of \u03b5 through the C-terminal Exo III domain, and such protein-RNA interaction, possibly with the assistance of a host cofactor(s), will lead to the major antiviral action of ISG20, which is the enzymatic activity dependent HBV RNA degradation. Subsequently, viral protein translation and DNA replication will be inhibited (Fig 14) . In addition, under certain circumstance that the enzymatic activity of ISG20 could be inhibited (i.e. the ISG20 D94G mutant), the binding of ISG20 to 5' \u03b5 may remain antiviral by competing the binding of viral polymerase with \u03b5 and blocking the subsequent pgRNA encapsidation and reverse transcription.",

            "text": "It is well documented that, during acute HBV infection, the activation of host T-cell responses plays a pivotal role in clearing virus from hepatocytes via a noncytolytic mechanism, which is largely attributed to the antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines produced by the infiltrating immune cells, such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 [32, 33] . To date, IFN-\u03b1 is the only available immunotherapy for treatment of chronic hepatitis B [34] . Besides serving as an immunomodulatory agent to regulate the host adaptive immunity against HBV, the intracellular antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b1 is mediated by an array of ISGs. In search of intrahepatic ISGs associated with immune clearance of HBV, a growing body of evidence implies that ISG20 may be involved in IFN mediated inhibition of HBV, including 1) the upregulation of ISG20 in HBV transgenic mouse hepatocyte cell lines in which the HBV replication was inhibited by IFN [19] ; 2) the elevation of ISG20 level in viral clearance phase of an acutely HBV infected Chimpanzee [35] ; and 3) the upregulation of ISG20 in chronic hepatitis B patients who responded well to IFN-\u03b1 therapy [21] . Consistent with the above findings, we found that ISG20 can be highly induced in hepatocytes in vitro by all three types of interferons, and it plays a significant role in IFN-\u03b1 elicited antiviral effects on HBV infection and replication (Figs 1, 4 and 5) . Considering that HBV RNA are essential genetic components for viral replication and gene expression in its life cycle, upregulation of ISG20 expression by cytokines to eliminate HBV RNA is a very economical and efficient way in host defense mechanisms. In addition, our study also expands the antiviral spectrum of ISG20 to a DNA virus. Considering that current HBV therapy with nucleoside analogues is ineffective against viral protein expression and cannot efficiently promote HBeAg or HBsAg seroconversion [34] , it is thus envisioned that the ISG20-based antiviral therapy could be developed in the future to reduce both viremia and antigenemia in CHB patients.",

            "text": "While its cellular function remains elusive, ISG20 has been previously shown to inhibit a number of RNA viruses, including VSV, influenza viruses, HIV-1, picornaviruses (EMCV, HAV), and flaviviruses (HCV, WNV, and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV)) [16-18, 36, 37] . The previously reported antiviral effects of ISG20 on these RNA viruses are all dependent on its exonuclease activity, though the degradation of viral RNA directly catalyzed by ISG20 has not been experimentally confirmed. However, RNA degradation might not be the only mechanism of ISG20's antiviral action. For instance, Zhou et al found that ISG20 did not promote the degradation of a replication-defective HCV RNA genome in Huh7.5 cells [17] ; and Qu et al observed that ISG20 inhibits Influenza A Virus replication through interaction with viral nucleoproteins [37] . Furthermore, not all the RNA viruses are susceptible to ISG20, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has shown resistance to ISG20 in cell cultures [17] , indicating that there is viral specific factor(s) to determine the antiviral specificity of ISG20. Here, we clearly demonstrated that ISG20 is able to promote HBV RNA degradation in cell cultures, and such effect is dependent on the protein's exonuclease activity (Figs 2-6 ). During the preparation of this manuscript, Leong et al also reported that ISG20 inhibited HBV replication in cell cultures and in hydrodynamic injected mouse liver via exoribonuclease-dependent degradation of viral RNA, which is largely consistent with our results, but their study did not touch on the molecular mechanism for the selective targeting of HBV RNA by ISG20 [38] . In our study, we further mapped the sequence element responsible for ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation to \u03b5 region in HBV RNA genome (Figs 7-9) , and confirmed the direct binding of ISG20 to \u03b5 in EMSA assay (Fig 10) . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report revealing that the RNA sequence/structure-specific recognition is required for ISG20 to degrade its viral RNA substrate. Such characteristic of ISG20 makes it mechanistically distinct from RNase L, a well-known antiviral ISG that, upon activation, nonspecifically destroys both viral and cellular RNA in cells [39] . In this regard, ISG20 represents a novel class of cellular antiviral ISGs, which is reminiscent of the sequence-specific antiviral RNAi system [40] , but ISG20 targets viral RNA directly without the help of small guide RNA.",

            "text": "Despite acting as a host antiviral factor, the other potential functions of ISG20 in regulating host cellular function remain obscure. Since ISG20 targets viral mRNA for destabilization, it is plausible that they may also alter the stability of certain cellular mRNA to regulate host gene expression. For example, the observed enhancement of HBV S1 promoter activity by ISG20 may be due to the ISG20-mediated upregulation of host transcription factor(s) required for S1 promoter activity or downregulation of negative regulator(s) of S1 promoter (S5 Fig). This notion is also supported by previous observations that ISG20-mediated antiviral effect on HCV was not through inhibition of HCV RNA stability or translation, indicating that ISG20 might degrade the mRNA of a host factor(s) essential for HCV replication [17] . More interestingly, considering that ISG20 favors short RNAs with stem-loop structures for affinity binding, it is also possible that ISG20 potentially targets host microRNA (miRNA) precursors (pri-miRNA and pre-miRNA) [44] and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) [45] , which may contain \u03b5-like stem-loop structures, to regulate miRNA processing and lncRNA stability, respectively. In addition, it is known that IFNs regulate cellular gene expression primarily at the mRNA level [46] , so it is possible that ISG20, as a IFN-inducible RNase, may partly mediate the action of IFN through altering the host mRNA stability. We are currently conducting RNA-seq analysis to search for potential host RNA substrates of ISG20. ISG20 has three predicted exonuclease domains (Exo I-III) with Exo II being validated as the major enzymatic domain [14] . We found that the catalytic site (D94) in Exo II of ISG20 was essential for HBV RNA reduction, but the ISG20 D94G mutant retained RNA binding activity and inhibited HBV pgRNA encapsidation through competing the binding of HBV polymerase to \u03b5 (Figs 6-8) . Although such antiviral effect may be just minor in the context of wildtype ISG20-mediated HBV RNA degradation, this serendipitous finding led us to discover the binding property of ISG20 with HBV RNA (Fig 10) . Interestingly, the minimal binding site on \u03b5 for ISG20 is located at the bottom 4bp of the stem-loop (Fig 11) , which is dispensable for HBV polymerase to bind \u03b5 [47] , indicating that the inhibition of polymerase binding by ISG20 is due to ISG20/\u03b5 interaction-induced steric hindrance and/or conformational shift of \u03b5. In addition, the domain of ISG20 for \u03b5 binding was mapped to the Exo III region (Fig 12) , suggesting that the substrate interaction and degradation domains of ISG20 are separated. This is consistent with the reported crystal structure analysis of ISG20, which predicted that the amino acid composition of Exo II is unfavorable for RNA binding [30] . However, no classical RNA binding motif was found in the Exo III domain or the entire ISG20 sequence by computational prediction (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/protein/Q96AZ6). ISG20 has been shown to interact with host U1/2/3 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) [48] , which also have stem-loops, further indicating that ISG20 may possess a novel binding motif for such kind of double stranded RNA secondary structures including HBV \u03b5.",

ZAP exerts its antiviral activity against HBV with certain features similar to ISG20, specifically, both ZAP and ISG20 interact with HBV RNA for RNA degradation in a \u03b5-dependent manner. Since ZAP does not possess nuclease activity [49] , our initial hypothesis was that ZAP might recruit ISG20 to \u03b5 for RNA degradation. However, co-immunoprecipitation assay did not reveal any detectable association between ZAP and ISG20 in the absence or presence of HBV RNA (S10 Fig), indicating that ZAP and ISG20 work independently to target HBV \u03b5 for their antiviral functions, and host cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to recognize the \"non-self\" HBV \u03b5 as an antiviral sensing signal.",

In addition, since ISG20 could single-handedly degrade poly(rA) oligo in the in vitro degradation assay (Fig 13B) , whether the poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is required to remove the poly(A) tail in ISG20-mediated HBV mRNA degradation reaction awaits further investigations. Interestingly, our in vitro RNA degradation assay demonstrated that ISG20 efficiently degrades single-stranded RNA but not the \u03b5 RNA substrate (Fig 13) , indicating that additional host factor(s), likely a RNA helicase, is required to unwind the double-stranded region of \u03b5 for ISG20 to catalyze RNA degradation. Therefore, we have embarked on the identification of cofactors in ISG20 degradesome complex by proteomic approach.",

Plasmid pCMVHBV\u0394C\u0394P contains start codon mutations of core (ATG to CTG) and pol (ATG to ACG) ORF in pCMVHBV backbone to block the expression of core and pol, respectively. pCMVHBV-Y63D bears a Y63D substitution in the reverse transcriptase domain of HBV pol gene to block DNA synthesis but still allows pgRNA encapsidation [54] (Provided by Dr. Jianming Hu).
