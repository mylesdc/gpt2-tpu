            "text": "Yellow dwarf viruses cause the most economically important virus diseases of cereal crops worldwide and are transmitted by aphid vectors. The identification of aphid genes and proteins mediating virus transmission is critical to develop agriculturally sustainable virus management practices and to understand viral strategies for circulative movement in all insect vectors. Two cyclophilin B proteins, S28 and S29, were identified previously in populations of Schizaphis graminum that differed in their ability to transmit the RPV strain of Cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV-RPV). The presence of S29 was correlated with F2 genotypes that were efficient virus transmitters. The present study revealed the two proteins were isoforms, and a single amino acid change distinguished S28 and S29. The distribution of the two alleles was determined in 12 F2 genotypes segregating for CYDV-RPV transmission capacity and in 11 genetically independent, field-collected S. graminum biotypes. Transmission efficiency for CYDV-RPV was determined in all genotypes and biotypes. The S29 isoform was present in all genotypes or biotypes that efficiently transmit CYDV-RPV and more specifically in genotypes that efficiently transport virus across the hindgut. We confirmed a direct interaction between CYDV-RPV and both S28 and S29 using purified virus and bacterially expressed, his-tagged S28 and S29 proteins. Importantly, S29 failed to interact with a closely related virus that is transported across the aphid midgut. We tested for in vivo interactions using an aphid-virus co-immunoprecipitation strategy coupled with a bottom-up LC-MS/MS analysis using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer. This analysis enabled us to identify a third cyclophilin protein, cyclophilin A, interacting directly or in complex with purified CYDV-RPV. Taken together, these data provide evidence that both cyclophilin A and B interact with CYDV-RPV, and these interactions may be important but not sufficient to mediate virus transport from the hindgut lumen into the hemocoel.",

            "text": "Barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDV) in the genera Luteovirus and Polerovirus that cause yellow dwarf disease of monocots are phloem restricted, single-stranded positive-sense RNA plant viruses [1] . They are strictly dependent on aphid vectors for host-to-host transmission, and they are transmitted in a circulative, non-propagative manner [2] . The model for circulative transmission involves aphids ingesting virions while feeding on the phloem sap of infected plants. Virions are acquired into the vector by moving through the hindgut cells and then are released into the hemocoel. Virions circulate in the hemolymph and concentrate at the basal lamina of the accessory salivary gland. Virions are then actively transported across these cells and released into the salivary duct where they can be injected, along with salivary secretions, as the aphid feeds on a plant host. Luteo and poleroviruses causing yellow dwarf disease are believed to follow the circulative pathway through aphid vectors [2] ; however, virus transmission is aphid-species specific. All aphids can ingest the various viruses during phloem feeding, but only some of the viruses are transmitted by any single aphid species [3] . Transmission will not occur if the virus fails to cross one of two potential transmission barriers; the hindgut or the accessory salivary gland. Virus particles are transported across both tissue types by a mechanism that resembles receptor-mediated endocytosis [4] , with different ligands and receptors involved at each step. Viruses in the Luteoviridae do not replicate in their vector and are transmitted only as virus particles [5] . The virus capsid contains two viral proteins: a 22 kDa major coat protein (CP) and a minor 72 kDa read-through protein (RTP) [6] . These are the only viral proteins required for transmission, and both are required to interact with aphid components to facilitate virus transport through the aphid [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Chemical cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry revealed a distinct topological feature in the a polerovirus RTP that is required for virus-aphid interactions [11] .",

            "text": "Little is known about the aphid components responsible for virus transmission. Several candidate proteins have been identified using virus overlay assays [12] [13] [14] and more recently proteomic approaches [15] [16] [17] . Two proteins (SaM35 and SaM50), able to bind in vitro the MAV strain of Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), were isolated from the vector Sitobion avenae, but they were not detected in the nonvector aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis [12] . Another 50 kDa protein, able to bind to the GAV strain of BYDV, was detected in two vector species Schizaphis graminum and S. avenae, but not in the nonvector species, Rhopalosiphum padi [14] . None of these proteins were identified using mass spectrometry. Three Myzus persicae proteins that bound the related Beet western yellows virus were identified by mass spectrometry as actin, a receptor for activated C kinase 1 (Rack-1), and Glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (GAPDH) [13] . Rack 1 has been shown to be involved in the regulation cell surface receptors [18] and GAPDH is an enzyme of the glycolysis pathway that also regulates endocytosis when phosphorylated [19] . Actin is involved in intracellular trafficking, it interacts with endocytic components [20] and is involved in virus transport [21] . These proteins may play a role in virus transmission, but no direct evidence was provided and the protein interaction experiments were performed under denaturing conditions. Validating the involvement of proteins in the circulative transmission process has posed a significant challenge to the entire vector biology field. Aphids are not amenable to transgenesis. Functional analyses are possible but difficult to achieve. RNA silencing pathways are conserved and even expanded in aphids [22] . RNA interference (RNAi) has been successful [23, 24] although silencing is incomplete in these insects. Dissected gut and salivary gland tissues are tiny, making biochemistry studies difficult. No suitable aphid cell culture models are available to study protein function. However, aphids are an ideal vector species to couple genetics and proteomics to probe protein function [15] [16] [17] . Aphids are cyclic parthenogens; they alternate sexual reproduction with parthenogenetic reproduction. Aphid hybrid lineages generated by sexual reproduction can be maintained parthenogenetically and allow the investigator to phenotype each hybrid genotype for different traits, for instance transmission of different virus strains or virus species. Parthenogenetic reproduction makes aphids highly amenable to proteomics studies because massive quantities of protein can be generated from genetically identical aphids as easily as growing bacterial cultures. Furthermore, the genome sequence of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum has been published [25] information on key pathways regulating the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity [26, 27] and the aphid EST collection is also expanding.",

These genotypes do not harbor known secondary endosymbionts, only distinct genotypes of the primary endosymbiont Buchnera spp [16] . The F2 aphid genotypes were characterized for their ability to transmit both viruses. It was found that the ability to transmit each virus segregated independently in the population [29] . Moreover, it was found that the barrier (i.e. hindgut or accessory salivary gland) responsible for preventing virus movement in the nonvector genotypes also segregated; some of the nonvector F2 genotypes had a strong hindgut barrier, others had a strong accessory salivary gland barrier and others had both barriers.",

Cyclophilin B is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and extracellular space [31] as well as on the cell surface of mammalian cells [32] . This protein functions in the secretory pathway, possibly by chaperoning membrane proteins or having a role in receptor signaling pathways [33] . A direct role of cyclophilin in B/CYDV movement through aphids may involve chaperoning the virus to various membrane bound vesicles, e.g. endosomes, in either gut or salivary tissues. In this study, we used a combination of genomic, proteomic, and biological approaches to probe the function of cyclophilin in virus transmission.",

Peptide and protein probabilities were calculated using PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet algorithms [40] . Protein and peptide FDR was 0.0%. Spectral counts were normalized to the total and compared between co-IP with virus and no virus control. A Fisher's Exact Test was performed to test for spectral count differences between groups. We used Skyline [41] to perform label-free quantification of MS1 ion signals derived from cyclophilin peptides in the co-IP [42] . Skyline is an open source software program that can be downloaded from http:// proteome.gs.washington.edu/software/skyline. We created a comprehensive spectral library including sampling across multiple acquisitions in Skyline that contains all the MS/MS spectra from the co-IP experiments. Search engine parameters were adjusted in Skyline as described above for Mascot searches. The precursor isotopic import filter was set to a count of three (M, M+1, M+2) at a resolving power of 35,000 at 200 m/z. Raw files were then imported directly into Skyline. Extracted ion chromatograms were manually inspected for each peptide. A normalization factor was calculated to account for run-to-run variation in ion abundances. Peak areas from three peptides derived from a protein that showed no enrichment in the co-IP as compared to the healthy control were normalized to the total. A normalization factor was calculated for each peptide. These normalization factors were averaged for each individual LC-MS/MS run. Total peak areas for the cyclophilin peptides of interest from every MS run were normalized by the average normalization factor. Raw and normalized peak areas for the cyclophilin peptides can be found in Dataset S1. A Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to investigate differences between the normalized peak areas for each peptide.",

Proteins were extracted from three genotypes of S. graminum proteins and the co-IP was performed as described in Yang et al. (2008) . A full description of the aphid-RPV interactome will be described in a forthcoming manuscript. Surprisingly, cyclophilin B was not detected (data not shown). Instead, cyclophilin A was one of 30 proteins that were at least two-fold higher or unique in the co-IP reactions with virus compared to the negative control, p<0.05. Peptides specifically matching to cyclophilin A were detected in A3 and WY10A (vector genotypes) as well as C2, a nonvector genotype with only the nonvector allele (Dataset S2). Spectral counts were two-fold higher in the co-IP compared to the negative control indicating an enrichment of cyclophilin in the co-IP reactions with virus (Table 3) . However, the spectral counts were not statistically different between vector (A3 and WY-10A) and the nonvector genotype (C2, Table 3 ). To further verify an enrichment of cyclophilin in the co-IP reactions, we compared the ion intensity chromatograms from the full scan MS data for two cyclophilin peptides that were selected for tandem MS and that had excellent retention time alignment across the replicates ( Figure  S3 ). The normalized total peak areas for these two peptides were significantly higher in the co-immunoprecipitation reactions as compared to the control reaction with no virus (Figure 3 , P value = 0.022 and 0.027 using a Kruskal Wallis test, respectively), providing further support for an enrichment of cyclophilin A in the co-IP reactions.

The proteomic and genomic analyses of the nonvector parent were in agreement; the S28 protein was the only protein observed [17] and the nonvector allele was the only transcript detected. The proteomic analysis [17] suggested the presence of two different cyclophilin B isoforms in the vector parent; however, the genomic results presented here indicate the vector parent was homozygous for the vector allele. A plausible explanation for the presence of two different protein isoforms in the proteomic analysis is the spontaneous deamination of glutamine that can occur in aqueous conditions [45] . The product of this deamination would be a protein of similar pI than the cyclophilin isoform present in the nonvector parent (S28). The spontaneous deamination of glutamine is a rate limiting reaction, and it could explain the difference in the amounts of both protein forms identified in the vector genotype where a Figure 3 . Normalized peak areas from two cyclophilin A peptides show enrichment in co-immunoprecipitation experiments using aphid proteins and purified CYDV-RPV. Whole insects of genotypes A3, C2 and biotype WY-10A (efficient vector biotype recently collected from a field in Wyoming) were subjected to cryogenic cell lysis and protein extraction. The extracted proteins were co-immonoprecipitated with purified CYDV-RPV using anti-RPV antibodies. Two peptides from cyclophilin were enriched in gentoypes A3, C2 and the field collected biotype WY-10A as compared to the control co-immunoprecipitation with no virus (aphid proteins incubated with beads and antibodies). Peptide FFDMTADGEQLR (2+ precursor m/z 793.369) was higher in intensity than the HTGPGILSMANAGANTNGSQFFTTVK peptide (3+ precursor m/z 912.871). This is not a good indicator of differences in relative abundance between the two peptides, which could result from different ionization efficiencies. However comparison of peak areas for each peptide across the various samples is an accurate way to measure relative abundance of the peptide in each sample. Both peptides showed similar trends in the experimental co-IPs compared to the control. Both peptides were more abundant in the co-IP reactions with virus. Although the peak areas showed an overall lower abundance in biotype WY10-A, which might reflect a lower overall expression of cyclophilin in this biotype as compared to the lab-reared F2 genotypes, this difference was not significant using a Kruskal Wallis test. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0071620.g003 much greater amount of the isoform S29 was detected when compared to the S28 [17] . A second explanation for this observation lies in the limitation of 2-D DIGE, the gel-based technology that was used to discover these isoforms. Using 2-D gels, a common problem is the co-migration of proteins with similar molecular weights and pIs [15] . A co-migrating protein with similar pI and MW as S28 could account for this difference.",

However, because we only have analyzed 12 of the F2s and only 3 are good vectors, we may have a biased population. The correlation of the presence of the vector allele of cyclophilin with efficient CYDV-RPV transmission was extended to a number of field collected populations of S. graminum that can be separated into distinct biotypes [35] . Four of the 11 biotypes were efficient vectors of CYDV-RPV and all encoded the vector isoform of cyclophilin, whereas the seven biotypes showing lower vector efficiency only encoded the nonvector isoform. Genotypes lacking the vector isoform of cyclophilin but transmitting CYDV-RPV with lower efficiency express protein isoforms conferring vector competence [15, 16] . In these genetic backgrounds, the nonvector isoform of cyclophilin may be sufficient to allow virus transmission. S. graminum biotypes can be divided into two categories according to the host plant preference: some biotypes are adapted to agronomic crops whereas others colonize wild grass species [46] . Previously, we had reported a correlation between virus transmission phenotype and host adaptation of S. graminum [47] and that the ability to colonize cultivated crops might have come at the expense of the ability to transmit viruses causing yellow dwarf disease. A role of cyclophilin in host adaptation is unknown, but the cyclophilin isoform may serve as a valuable biomarker to rapidly identify risk factors of S. graminium populations as virus vectors and pests of agronomic cereal crops [15] .",

Cyclophilin spectral counts in the coIP with CYDV-RPV and Schizaphis graminum proteins show more than 2-fold enrichment compared to negative control. detected. Similar to the nonvector parent that contained only the nonvector allele, a majority of the F2 genotypes with low transmission efficiencies were homozygous for the nonvector allele. Interestingly, the two nonvector genotypes that were identified as having both cyclophilin alleles (BB1 and K3) were found to have a strong salivary gland barrier and were lacking a hindgut barrier (Table 2 ) [28] . In these genotypes, virus is transported across the gut tissues similar as in the vector parental genotype. The nonvector parent and the F2 genotypes that were homozygous for the nonvector allele have at least a hindgut barrier to CYDV-RPV transmission ( Table 2) . Cyclophilin has not yet been localized to any particular aphid tissues, but these results lead to the hypothesis that the S29 isoform of cyclophilin may be involved in the efficient transport of CYDV-RPV across the hindgut of S. graminum. Although the accessory salivary gland is the site that determines vector specificity for most aphid-BYDV/CYDV combinations [2] , the hindgut can act as a virus specific barrier and CYDV-RPV was shown to be a virus whose transport through the aphid is regulated at the hindgut [4] . Both isoforms of S. graminum cyclophilin B fused to a his tag interacted with CYDV-RPV but did not interact detectably with PLRV ( Figure 2 ). PLRV is a polerovirus related to CYDV-RPV but with different vector specificities. There is one major difference in the circulative pathway PLRV and CYDV-RPV take through the aphid. CYDV-RPV is acquired through the hindgut of the vector S. graminum [9, 48] whereas PLRV is acquire through the midgut of M. persicae [49] . The tissue tropism in the vector is determined by one of the virus structural proteins [7] , but the virus must interact with different aphid proteins in the hindgut and midgut. If cyclophilin functions during hindgut transport of the virus as the genetic correlation data suggests, this would also provide a plausible explanation for the interaction with CYDV-RPV and not PLRV.",

            "text": "The in vitro his-tagged cyclophilin interacted with CYDV-RPV but we did not detect this interaction using co-IP from total aphid protein homogenate. Yang et al. (2008) reported an interaction between CYDV-RPV and a single protein of the similar molecular weight and pI as cyclophilin B (S29) using co-IP-DIGE, but this protein was never identified to be cyclophilin using mass spectrometry [17] . The identification of a single protein assumed to be S29 as interacting with CYDV-RPV in the Yang et al. (2008) experiment conflicts with the his-tagging experiment ( Figure 2 ) that showed both S28 and S29 interact with CYDV-RPV. Our co-IP experiment with aphid and CYDV-RPV indicates the potential involvement of a third cyclophilin protein, cyclophilin A. One hypothesis is that the protein spot from the co-IP-DIGE reported by Yang et al. 2008 contained cyclophilin A and not either of the two cyclophilin B isoforms or perhaps a mixture of both. The difference in results could be explained by the differences in techniques used and the detection limits of each analytical platform. Indeed the cyclophilin A identified in complex with CYDV-RPV has a predicted pI and MW of 9.45 and 22.8, respectively, very similar to the cyclophilin B isoforms. These new data on cyclophilin A provide a more parsimonious explanation for the discrepancy in the data from the his-tagging experiment reported here and the co-IP-DIGE observations reported previously [17] . Speculative and yet reasonable explanations for why we did not identify cyclophilin B using the co-IP-LC-MS/MS approach include (a) that cyclophilin A outcompeted cyclophilin B for binding CYDV-RPV in the presence of both cyclophilins, (b) the washing procedure removed cyclophilin B from the complex, or (c) that cyclophilin B was not detectable in the complex matrix of the co-IP due to the incubation time that was used. Incubation times are known to have an impact on protein recovery during co-IP [50] .",

The reasons for the difference in transmission efficiency in these aphids when cyclophilin A and B from vector and nonvector aphids interact (directly or in complex) with CYDV-RPV are not clear. Both cyclophilins have a signal peptide that is predicted to be cleaved; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that they have different subcellular localization. The differing amino acid between the cyclophilin B isoforms is located in position 2 of the mature form. The glutamine residue present in the vector isoform is neutral whereas the glutamic acid residue in the nonvector isoform is acidic. This difference in charge may be responsible for changes in the tertiary structure of the protein resulting in different affinities for the virions or with other proteins. In spite of the in vitro interactions between cyclophilin A and B and CYDV-RPV, cyclophilin could be involved in virus transmission by another mechanism besides direct interaction with virions. Cyclophilins have been shown in complexes on mammalian cell surfaces despite the lack of domains explaining the association with plasma membranes [32] . Therefore, aphid cyclophilin proteins may be associated with other key plasma membrane proteins that function in virus recognition. In animals, cyclophilin proteins are now widely recognized to play diverse roles in virus-host interactions for vesicular stomatitis virus [51] , coronavirus [52] , human immunodeficiency virus [53] , hepatitis C [54] and vaccina virus [55] .",

However, the combination of genetic and biochemical data for a role in transmission is the strongest to date for any aphid protein being involved in virus transmission. Luteovirus transmission is a polygenic character governed by few major genes and several minor genes acting in an additive manner. Our results point to a role of these cyclophilin proteins in CYDV-RPV transmission, probably during crossing of the hindgut. The vector isoform of cyclophilin B (S29) does not appear to essential for CYDV-RPV transmission but might play an important role in facilitating the process. Continuing work is focused on localizing cyclophilin A and B in specific aphid tissues and providing evidence of an in vivo interaction of virus and cyclophilin in vector and nonvector aphid genotypes and aphid species. These results will help us to draw the boundary of how cyclophilin regulates yellow dwarf virus transmission. The results also highlight the importance of forging deeper connections between genomic and proteomic variation underlying complex phenotypes such as virus transmission by insects. Figure S1 .
