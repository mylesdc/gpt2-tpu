Reports in the literature have indicated that to infect cells the incoming viruses either fuse their envelope directly with the plasma membrane or exploit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To study the entry process in human tissue culture cells (HeLa, A549), we used fluorescence microscopy and developed quantitative, FACS-based assays to follow virus binding to cells, endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, membrane fusion, and infection. A variety of perturbants were employed to characterize the cellular processes involved. We found that immediately after binding to cells RSV activated a signaling cascade involving the EGF receptor, Cdc42, PAK1, and downstream effectors. This led to a series of dramatic actin rearrangements; the cells rounded up, plasma membrane blebs were formed, and there was a significant increase in fluid uptake. If these effects were inhibited using compounds targeting Na + /H + exchangers, myosin II, PAK1, and other factors, no infection was observed. The RSV was rapidly and efficiently internalized by an actin-dependent process that had all hallmarks of macropinocytosis. Rather than fusing with the plasma membrane, the viruses thus entered Rab5-positive, fluidfilled macropinosomes, and fused with the membranes of these on the average 50 min after internalization. Rab5 was required for infection. To find an explanation for the endocytosis requirement, which is unusual among paramyxoviruses, we analyzed the fusion protein, F, and could show that, although already cleaved by a furin family protease once, it underwent a second, critical proteolytic cleavage after internalization. This cleavage by a furin-like protease removed a small peptide from the F1 subunits, and made the virus infectious.",

In a recent publication, San-Juan-Vergara et al.

The results showed that RSV was rapidly and efficiently internalized, and that acid-independent membrane fusion occurred intracellularly after endocytosis. Cell biological studies demonstrated that endocytosis was macropinocytic, and that it was required for infection. The process involved activation of the EGF receptor and its downstream effectors including Cdc42, Pak1, and myosin II. RSV induced transient actin rearrangements accompanied by plasma membrane blebbing, elevated fluid uptake, and internalization of intact RSV particles into large macropinosomes. Expression of a dominant negative Rab5 mutant but not Rab7 decreased infection indicating that RSV penetration is intracellular, and takes place in Rab5 positive macropinosomes before fusion with endolysosomal compartments. The reason why RSV, unlike most paramyxoviruses, depended on endocytic entry was found to be the need for activation of the F protein by a second proteolytic cleavage. It occurred after endocytosis, and involved most likely a furin-like, vacuolar enzyme. . Gradient purifier RSV (,10 5 particles/50 ml) was resolved on the SDS-PAGE, followed by the blue silver gel staining. (B) . After binding to a glass slide, purified RSV was stained with anti-F-AF488 (green), anti-N-AF594 (red), and phalloidin-AF647 (pseudocolored white). The particles (n = 457) were imaged with a confocal microscope and analyzed for colocalization by Imaris. Arrowheads show particles with all three stains. (C). Equal volumes of the virus input (moi 10), the cell bound virus lysates, and the unbound virus (sup) were resolved by a SDS-PAGE. Western blots were developed with anti-P or anti-N RSV specific antibody. (left) Representative western blots.

One of the characteristic features of macropinocytosis is an elevation in the uptake of extracellular fluid [22] . Indeed, when serum-starved HeLa cells were exposed to RSV, we observed that the internalization of 10 kDa dextran-AF488, a soluble, fluorescent tracer added to the medium, increased by 50% and 120% at low and high moi, respectively, over mock treated cells (Fig. 6A ). The elevation was significantly higher than in serum-stimulated cells.

Inhibition of PI3K (wortmannin, Ly294002, PI-103), a downstream effector of EGFR, also reduced infection (Fig. 7C ). EGFR inhibitors had little effect on SFV. That the PI3K inhibitors boosted SFV infection was consistent with a distinct entry mechanism for this virus. In addition, inhibition of PKC (rottlerin, calphostin C) decreased RSV (Fig. 7D ). Although the effect on SFV was smaller, it suggested a role for PKC in the entry of both viruses.

Blotting with an anti-F1 antibody revealed a protein band in the isolated virus migrating with a molecular weight of 50 kDa, confirming that the F protein had been cleaved at least once already in the producer cells (Fig. 9F) . When virus bound to cells in the cold were allowed cell enter for 1.5 h at 37uC, the mobility of the cell-associated F1 became faster (48 kDa) indicating that further processing had occurred. The reduction in size of around 2 kDa was consistent with the loss of p27 at the N terminus of F1. Importantly, in cells pretreated with dec-RVKR-CMK, the processing of the 50 kDa F1 protein did not occur. As expected, a-PDX and leupeptin did not influence the processing step. When the time course of F1 processing was followed, we observed that some processed F1 was detectable already 15 min after cell warming (Fig. 9G) . It peaked at 60 min when the precursor was fully consumed. That the amount of F1 protein gradually decreased at later time points was probably due to lysosomal degradation explaining the decrease in band intensity in the endocytosis lanes in Fig. 9F . . HeLa cells were pretreated with dec-RVKR-CMK, a -PDX or leupeptin at indicated concentration for 1 h before experiment and inhibitors were continuously present during following steps of the experiment. Cells were infected with RSV or RSVDGDSH for 6 h before FACS analysis of GFP expressing cells. (B). HeLa cells were infected with RSV or RSVDGDSH for 1 h. Virus inoculum was replaced with medium containing 100 mM dec-RVKR-CMK and incubated for 6 before FACS analysis of GFP expressing cells. (C). Versene detached HeLa cells were pretreated with solvent (MOCK), dec-RVKR-CMK or EIPA at indicated concentrations and inhibitors were continuously present during following steps of the experiment. RSV-R18/DiOC or RSVDGDSH-R18/DiOC (moi ,5) was bound to cells at 4uC. Unbound virus was removed and cells were incubated at 37uC for 2 h in the presence of inhibitor. Cells were fixed and the MFI of DiOC fluorescence measured by FACS and normalized to mock no inhibitor controls. (D). RSV F protein (574 aa) is proteolytically processed by furin like protease at the two sites (A aa-106 and B aa-136) to generate disulfide bonds linked F1+F2 and small peptide p27 (aa sequence depicted above).

However, since the read-out was infection after 20 h, a role for CME in postendocytic steps in the RSV infectious cycle could not be excluded.

Unlike other paramyxoviruses, the F protein in RSV has two activating cleavage sites [29] . Our mass spectroscopy analysis and western blots showed that while F in the isolated virus had been cleaved in the A-site (RARR) generating F2 and F1, it had not been cleaved at the more C-terminal B site (KKRKR). The second cleavage occurred after endocytosis. Inhibition of the second cleavage by dec-RVKR-CMK inhibited RSV fusion and infection. That dec-RVKR-CMK is a furin inhibitor suggested that the protease in question belonged to the furin family of convertases. The enzyme was evidently acid-independent, and active in early Rab5 -positive macropinosomes. Cleavage at the B site was most likely important because after removal the p27 peptide 'cap' from the N-terminus, the hydrophobic fusion peptide is rendered the most N-terminal sequence in F1. In other class I viral fusion proteins, including other paramyxovirus F proteins, the fusion sequence is invariably N-terminal [43] .",

Infectious entry depends on endocytosis, which the virus induces by transiently activating macropinocytosis. The virus most likely meets the enzyme that generates the second cleavage in Rab5 positive macropinosomes, and fusion occurs after some delay in these vacuoles. In this respect, the virus resembles Ebola and SARS viruses, the fusion proteins of which are also activated within endocytic vacuoles by proteases [44, 45] . It is interesting to note that the F of Nipah virus, which has a single monobasic cleavage site in its F, is activated after endocytic uptake by cathepsin [46, 47] . Inhibitors of cathepsins block infection, and cathepsin double knock-out cells are not infected. The infectious entry of other paramyxoviruses (and other viruses that have pHindependent membrane fusion) may thus be endocytosis-dependent and the mechanisms more complex than previously assumed.",
