This process requires 48 to 72 hours. The rapid administration of the most appropriate antimicrobial treatment is crucial for the survival of septic patients; therefore, a rapid method that enables diagnosis directly from analysis of a blood sample without culture is needed. A recently developed platform that couples broad-range PCR amplification of pathogen DNA with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) has the ability to identify virtually any microorganism from direct clinical specimens. To date, two clinical evaluations of the PCR/ESI-MS technology for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections from whole blood have been published. Here we discuss them and describe recent improvements that result in an enhanced sensitivity. Other commercially available assays for the molecular diagnosis of bloodstream infections from whole blood are also reviewed. The use of highly sensitive molecular diagnostic methods in combination with conventional procedures could substantially improve the management of septic patients.",

The time window for the administration of an appropriate therapy is less than 6 hours once the symptoms are recognized, and it is optimal to administer broad-range antibiotics within the first hour, preferably after obtaining a blood culture for microbiological diagnosis [2] . Inadequate antimicrobial therapy increases the risk of mortality. Every hour of delay in initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy increases the mortality by 7.6% in patients with septic shock [3] . Conventional methods for the microbiological diagnosis of sepsis rely on blood culture followed by biochemical identification. It usually takes 1 to 3 days to obtain both the identification and the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the pathogen. The major limitation of blood culture methods is that they require a median timeto-positivity of 12 to 17 hours [4] . Another limitation of this method is that the presence of unculturable or fastidious microorganisms may decrease its sensitivity. Culture may also be negative if antimicrobial therapy was begun prior to blood sampling. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve the diagnostic tools for a better management of septic patients.",

Mass spectrometry technology has recently been introduced in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Using matrix-assisted laser ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) spectrometers the diagnostic process may be shortened [5] [6] [7] as the identification of the pathogen can be achieved within 30 minutes directly from a positive blood culture [8] . Additionally, this technology is able to detect the resistance to some antibiotics [9] , such as the presence of -lactamases (including carbapenemases), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and even vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. However, this technology relies on culture and, therefore, a median of 12-to 17-hour delay is unavoidable [4] . In order to further accelerate the diagnostic process, it is desirable to detect and identity pathogens directly from the patient's blood, avoiding the culture step.",

This limitation has been overcome in several commercial assays which are able to detect a number of microorganisms [10] [11] [12] . These assays are based on two main strategies: the identification of a selected group of pathogens using specific targets (i.e., SeptiFast [13] , VYOO [14] , and Magicplex [15] ) or the detection of a broad range of pathogens using universal/conserved targets (i.e., SepsiTest [16] , PCR/ESI-MS [17] ).",

Methods have now been developed that allow use of the PCR/ESI-MS technology on whole blood samples, and two clinical evaluations of this system have recently been published [21, 22] . A new version of the instrument is presented that has been designed to improve the sensitivity and implementation in the clinical laboratory. This review describes the current status of the molecular diagnosis of sepsis with emphasis on the PCR/ESI-MS technology. [13] . The presence of the resistance gene mecA may be detected with a separate test. The initial volume of blood required is 3 mL (using the manual DNA extraction protocol 1.5 mL aliquots are processed in duplicate) or 1.5 mL (using the automated DNA extraction) [23] . The region amplified in this assay is the internal transcribed spacer region (IST), which is located between the 16S and 23S ribosomal genes for bacteria and between 18S and 5.8S ribosomal genes for fungi [13] . The amplification is performed with a LightCycler 2.0 instrument; different pathogens are detected through specific fluorescent probes. The time-to-result using this approach is 4.5-6 hours. This assay has been widely evaluated in the clinical setting; however, the results are conflicting with reported sensitivities ranging from 15% to 98% in ICU patients [24] . Recently, Chang et al. reviewed all the available literature reporting use of the SeptiFast assay and performed a meta-analysis that included data on 6,012 patients from 35 selected studies. The overall calculated sensitivity of SeptiFast was 75.0% (95% confidence interval, 65.0-83.0%), and the specificity was 92.0% (95% confidence interval, 90.0-95.0%).",

A real-time PCR is then carried out in a screening step for identification of the group or genera level of pathogens present. Finally, a second real-time PCR is performed to achieve the identification at species level. Identification of 21 bacterial species, five Candida species, and Aspergillus fumigatus is possible. For the DNA extraction, 1 mL of whole blood is used and human DNA is removed prior to the lysis of microorganisms. The time-to-result of this assay is 6 hours.

Briefly, after the PCR, amplicons are desalted and analyzed by mass spectrometry. ESI-MS is used to determine the molecular mass of each amplicon, which is then used to calculate the base composition of each amplicon. The base compositions of multiple amplicons from different regions of the genome are compared to an extensive database and the identification of the pathogen is achieved (Figure 1 ). Even though the base composition analysis is not as informative as sequencing, it has enough discrimination power for the detection and identification of hundreds of microbial pathogens. A broad bacteria and Candida detection assay (BAC assay; Ibis Biosciences, an Abbott company, Carlsbad, CA, USA) has been designed for use in clinical research to identify more than 600 bacteria and Candida species. The BAC assay also detects resistance genes for three clinically relevant antibiotics: methicillin (mecA), vancomycin (vanA and vanB), and carbapenem (blaKPC).",

Although the most common targets are the ribosomal DNA genes (i.e., 16S for bacteria and 18S for fungi), several housekeeping genes (i.e., tufB, rplB, valsS, and rpoB) are also useful for the identification of pathogens [10, 11, 29] . Within these genes, highly conserved regions are used as priming sites, but the region amplified contains enough variability for the discrimination between species. For instance, in order to identify bacterial and Candida species, the BAC assay includes thirteen pairs of primers targeting different conserved regions (nine primers pairs for bacteria and four for Candida species). An advantage of using PCR primers designed for several conserved regions with varying degrees of specificity is that when more than one microorganism is present, there is redundancy of coverage across various primer pairs. This is especially relevant when the different microorganisms are present in different abundances, as using several nonoverlapping primer pairs may allow amplification of the less abundant species. Redundant amplification also prevents missed detections due to mismatches in single priming sites [29, 30] .",

            "text": "Since its original description by the team of Ibis Biosciences, the PCR/ESI-MS technology has been continuously evolving. The first instrument, named TIGER (for Triangulation Identification for the Genetic Evaluation of Risk) [31] , was initially designed for biodefense and surveillance applications, due to its capability to identify previously unknown and unculturable microorganisms. Shortly after, a commercial version of this technology appeared, the Ibis T5000 [17, 30] . In this format, the sample processing was automated and a software system permitted management of the instrumentation, signal analysis, and report generation. This version of the instrument was intended to be used in health and industry settings; it provided highly sensitive detection without the need for a highly trained operator. With the incorporation of Ibis Biosciences into the Abbott group, the system was upgraded [29] . This system, the PLEX-ID, was used in the aforementioned studies [21, 22, 32, 33, 35] . Recently, a newer version has been developed with improvements focused on the analysis of direct patient specimens. One of the principal changes is the use of a larger volume of blood (5 mL) in order to increase sensitivity. Changes in the extraction process allow BioMed Research International 5 A PCR/ESI-MS assay is able to differentiate species in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and classify these species based on drug resistance [38, 39] . This technology has also proved its usefulness for epidemiological proposes, given that it enables molecular genotyping [40] . For instance, genotyping of Staphylococcus aureus [41, 42] , Acinetobacter baumannii [43] [44] [45] , and respiratory pathogens [46, 47] [50] [51] [52] . Moreover, this technology shows a great promise for the global surveillance of influenza virus [53] [54] [55] . Remarkably, it was able to detect the novel H1N1 strain during the 2009 influenza virus outbreak without any modification in the Influenza Surveillance Assay (Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA, USA) [56] .",

Isolation of the causal agent provides an irrefutable proof of an infection and allows pathogen identification and determination of antibiotic susceptibility. However, many microorganisms are unculturable, fastidious, or slow-growing. Additionally, prior antimicrobial treatment negatively affects culture-based tests. In the case of bloodstream infections, lack of detection is critical. A significant percentage of blood cultures are negative despite the high likelihood of a bacterial or fungal infection [2] . Lack of culturability and the time to answer mean that many septic patients are not appropriately treated. PCR/ESI-MS is a robust technology that offers a rapid alternative for the diagnosis of bloodstream as well as other infections. Although being not currently commercially available, the new presentation of the technology has been improved in several aspects that significantly enhance sensitivity. The main advantage of this technology is that it can be used on direct patient specimens, avoiding the culture step. Using this technology as a complement to conventional methods will offer a real improvement in the management of septic and other critically ill patients (i.e., patients suffering from meningitis or fever of unknown origin). Its versatility for the detection of different kinds of microorganisms will make this technology a highly valuable tool in the clinical laboratory.",

Bhatia et al.[48] used PCR/ESI-MS to identify a Streptococcus intermedius species from cerebrospinal fluid (CFS) and from a fixed biopsy in a patient with a central nervous system (CNS) infection. Although this infection had a respiratory origin, both bronchoalveolar lavage and CFS cultures were negative. Farrell et al.[49] investigated the capability of PCR/ESI-MS to identify pathogens on several specimens collected from patients undergoing antimicrobial treatment. A total of 76 clinical specimens including swabs, blood cultures, fluids, and tissues were collected from 47 patients. From those, 72% (55/76) were culture negative, whereas 76% (58/76) were PCR/ESI-MS positive.Major viral families can also be detected using this approach. Of special interest is the new version of the Viral IC assay designed for the diagnosis of opportunistic viral infections of immunocompromised patients by viruses such as Herpesvirus, Adenovirus, Parvovirus, Picornavirus, and Polyomavirus. The ability of the assays on the PCR/ESI-MS system to detect influenza virus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, vector-borne flaviviruses, and alphaviruses has been demonstrated",
