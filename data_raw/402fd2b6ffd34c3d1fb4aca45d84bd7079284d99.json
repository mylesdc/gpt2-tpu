However, there is no consensus on how many cities should be selected or on how to select those cities. Using airport flight data that commercial airlines reported to the Official Airline Guide (OAG) in 2000, we have examined the network characteristics of network samples obtained under different selection rules. In addition, we have examined different size samples based on largest flight volume and largest metropolitan populations. We have shown that although the bias in network characteristics increases with the reduction of the sample size, a relatively small number of areas that includes the largest airports, the largest cities, the most-connected cities, and the most central cities is enough to describe the dynamics of the global spread of influenza. The analysis suggests that a relatively small number of cities (around 200 or 300 out of almost 3000) can capture enough network information to adequately describe the global spread of a disease such as influenza. Weak traffic flows between small airports can contribute to noise and mask other means of spread such as the ground transportation.",

Recent real and hypothetical threats have increased interest about the role airline transportation has in the spread of HIV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic influenza, and drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Nevertheless, the role that airline transportation has on infectious disease epidemiology is not yet completely understood. Global cross-continental disease transmission is more likely by airline travel than by other means of travel, such as by boat. Additionally, air travel is the main form of transportation to remote areas such as small towns in Alaska, Siberia, and certain islands in the Pacific [1] . In these remote areas, public health interventions follow the same airline transportation routes as the spread of disease, meaning these routes to remote areas cannot be ignored. On the other hand, local transportation patterns might be more critical for the continental spread of influenza, and national grounding of air transport is believed to have little impact on fast disease propagation [8] .",

They showed that the most-connected cities are not necessarily the largest but play a critical role, not only for economic and cultural purposes, but also for global public health. Therefore, the role of both large and small airlines in providing community connections needs to be better understood. For example, researchers of global disease spread base their models on different numbers of airports, ranging from 52 to the entire sample of 3100 connected cities [2] [3] [4] 9, 10] . Relying on either extreme might lead to flawed results. On one hand, having too few cities could lead to researchers' missing important pathways that could be critical in disease spread. Samples from networks have been shown to lose many important properties of the entire network, such as scale-free degree distribution, and lead to bias in the main network measures [11] [12] [13] [14] , which might bias the patterns of disease transmission. On the other hand, using the entire sample of 3100 air transport connected cities leads to connectedness bias, because two cities can be weakly connected by air travel but heavily connected by ground transport. Finally, as was shown by Guimer\u00e0 et al. [1] , some of the most-connected cities are not necessarily the largest and, conversely, some of the largest cities (and thus very important for their role in epidemics) might not be the most connected.",

When the sample size is very small, the probability is low that cities connected to a selected city have also been selected into the sample. As more cities are added from the highly connected end of the city list, more connections are filled and the average degree increases. When smaller and lessconnected cities are added, the average degree decreases (Figure 3b ). The clustering coefficient (the probability that two cities connected to a third city are also connected directly to each other) monotonically decreases with increases in the sample size ( Figure 3c ).

For the population-based samples, the peak corresponds to the largest degree of 500, and the average degree is around 17. This discrepancy reflects the fact that the largest cities are not necessarily the most connected nor do they have the largest flight volumes. The same argument applies to the clustering coefficient and the geodesic. As mentioned in Guimer\u00e0 et al. [1] and Borgatti et al. [16] , betweenness is a critical characteristic related to the bottlenecks in travel flows and disease transmission. Guimer\u00e0 et al. [1] showed that the 25 most-connected cities are not necessarily the most central in terms of betweenness. Therefore, we evaluated the impact of the sample size and sampling type (population-based vs. volume-based). We have created lists of cities sorted by air travel volume, population size, city betweenness, and city degree. For each sample size, we calculated the percentage of cities common to two or more lists and present the results in Figure 4 . For example, 80% of the 155 highest volume cities also appear among the 155 highest degree cities and vice versa.",

The highest volume and highest betweenness samples share no less than 50%. In fact, the percentage of shared cities increases as the sample size gets larger than 1000. The highest betweenness and degree cities show a similar pattern. On the other hand, samples based on the population show little commonality (less than 30%) with samples based on other characteristics when the sample size is smaller than 100 cities. This percentage increases as the sample size increases. It is monotonic for population-volume and population-degree, but is not monotonic for population-betweenness. A sample as large as 1500 cities (about one-half of the total network) is needed to ensure that 50% of the cities appear on all four lists. If a researcher wants to include the cities that are within the top 100 of both population size and flight volume, he or she will need to have a sample size of about 165 cities ( Figure 5 ). The multiplier generally decreases with increasing sample size; however, we observe that a nonlinear relationship between sample size and betweenness produces a bump in the three curves involving betweenness. Similar shapes, but the opposite directions, are observed in commonality plots.",

A large expected difference is regional coverage. When the sample size is small some critical cities such as Cape Town or Lagos would be left out of the sample. An example of selection discrepancy between population size vs. flight volume is Washington, DC, which is not a part of the 52 largest city sample but is a part of the 52 largest volume sample. The results also show that larger sample sizes tend to produce smaller FPTs, possibly due to the additional routes through which the disease can travel. Furthermore, when the sample size is large enough, there is no difference between the results from the volume-based and the population-based samples. However, when the sample size is small, air traffic connections to some cities can be inadequately represented, and the disease transmission time can be significantly biased. Most of the discrepancies occur in the small, populationbased samples. This is especially true for the large cities that are relatively weakly connected, such as St. Petersburg, Russia, where the FPT is about 130 days for a sample of 52 population-based cities, compared to 94 days in the full network. This difference is more than a month, which is very important for public health preparedness. Similar differences are observed for better-connected cities such as Cape Town (98 vs. 54 days), Bogot\u00e1 and Washington, DC, although for the latter two the differences are not as dramatic.",

Thus, to avoid bias in disease spread, a reliable sample should include at least the 100-150 cities with the largest flight volume and cities that are well connected. The addition of cities with large population sizes or those in remote locations will improve regional coverage. For example, Fairbanks, Alaska would not be selected in a population-based or a volume-based sample of size n,1000, but given its regional importance, it should be considered for inclusion regardless of the sample size in studies where the Alaskan region is of interest.",

We base our assessment of its ability to represent global disease dynamics on the observation that for our cities of interest it reproduced the FPTs found in the entire list of 2904 cities (within random error). The samples of size 500 and the volume-based sample of size 155 also share this same result.

We have shown that in order to reduce bias in the estimation of global disease dynamics, a network of connected cities should be based on the volume-based core that also includes the most-connected cities. About 150 cities are sufficient for adequate coverage of the major world regions. The results of the simulations suggest that samples based on air traffic volume better describe sample characteristics but can have poor regional coverage and thus need to be complemented by the samples based on population size, betweenness, and clustering characteristics. Next, one could add remote locations for answering questions about specific regions. We have shown through dynamic simulations that a relatively small number of cities (around 200 or 300) can capture enough network information to adequately describe the global spread of a disease such as influenza.",

For example, for practical optimization of the global distribution of antiviral medicine, mathematical models are more likely to consider the role of individual regions or cities in the context of the global spread of disease. If a model is based on a small number of cities, such as in the Rvachev-Longini model, the role of individual cities in the global spread will be underestimated. Incidentally, in a recent paper by Kern\u00e9is et al. [17] , the authors consider the role of different cities in a global epidemic under different disease characteristics. We would argue that some of their conclusions about the speed of the global spread and the behavior of different city types would change if the authors had considered a more representative set of cities including large metropolitan areas with little traffic as well as smaller but extensively connected cities.",

The results also show that the bias is smoothly dependent on the population size for all sampling methods and there is no ''natural'' threshold suggesting the optimal choice of the sample size. For each objective, the ''optimal'' sample size should be the balance of the scale at which the conclusions are made and the appropriateness of using airline transportation as the basis for human travel flows. One should keep in mind that very small airports can reflect insignificant private traffic flows, while most of the regional transportation is based on ground traffic. Although a large number of network characteristics could be studied with respect to the network samples, we have selected the ones that are clearly defined and were shown to be related to the spread of diseases, innovation, or information. Some measures were inevitably left out. For example, Ghani et al. [18] and Ghani and Garnett [19] demonstrated that network measures such as assortative mixing patterns and population representativeness were strongly affected by the way in which nodes were selected for inclusion in the simulated network. We did not consider the estimation of ''mixing'' matrices because the actual definition can be ambiguous. Mixing matrices can be defined in terms of flight volume, population size, region, etc. A number of other network measures can be found in Wasserman and Faust [20] .",

Although the actual curves and the quantitative results would be different for each specific study, the methodology of selecting a sample based on individual and network characteristics will guide future studies. Another limitation is that in this study the entire network of connected cities is known. Although complete or nearly complete network information is sometimes available in transportation studies, this is usually not the case in social network studies.

Orthogonal regression minimizes the orthogonal distance from the regression line as opposed to minimizing vertical distance in ordinary regression. The spread of the residuals is comparable to the range of the data indicating high variation of the flight volume for cities of the similar sizes. Orthogonal regression provides a useful reference line because it treats flight volume and city size as equal variables and could be viewed as the principle component capturing the essence of the relationship between the two variables. At the same time ordinary regression considers flight volume as a function of the city size. The lower slope in the regression line compared to the orthogonal regression indicates that there are many large cities that have a small flight volume as well as small cities with high flight volume. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0003154.g002",
