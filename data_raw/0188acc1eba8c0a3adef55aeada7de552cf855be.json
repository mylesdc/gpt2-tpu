Here we report a cluster of HCoV-NL63 cases with severe lower respiratory tract infection that arose in Guangzhou, China, in 2018. Twenty-three hospitalized children were confirmed to be HCoV-NL63 positive, and most of whom were hospitalized with severe pneumonia or acute bronchitis. Whole genomes of HCoV-NL63 were obtained using next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic and single amino acid polymorphism analyses showed that this outbreak was associated with two subgenotypes (C3 and B) of HCoV-NL63. Half of patients were identified to be related to a new subgenotype C3. One unique amino acid mutation at I507 L in spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) was detected, which segregated this subgenotype C3 from other known subgenotypes. Pseudotyped virus bearing the I507 L mutation in RBD showed enhanced entry into host cells as compared to the prototype virus. This study proved that HCoV-NL63 was undergoing continuous mutation and has the potential to cause severe lower respiratory disease in humans.",

The clinical information of the HCoV-NL63 infected patients was summarized in Figure 1 (C). The majority of patients who were infected with HCoV-NL63 had pneumonia, and two patients had severe pneumonia. Their ages ranged from 5 months to 5 years old. Clinical manifestation of these patients included cough, fever, coryza, shortness of breath, wheezing and abnormal pulmonary breath sound. Samples from HCoV-NL63 positive patients were also tested for other 14 common respiratory pathogens. Of the 23 patients, 19 (82.6%) of them were infected only with HCoV-NL63, while 4 (17.4%) patients were found to be co-infected with other pathogens, such as RSV, HBoV and EV. These data clearly showed that most of the patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were caused by HCoV-NL63 but not co-infected with other pathogens. HCoV-NL63 infection presented here preferentially caused severe lower respiratory tract infection rather than upper respiratory tract infection. No evidence of injuries, COPD, immune diseases, chronic diseases, metabolic disorders et al were detected in these patients. Comparison of clinical characteristics including age, co-infection and clinical symptoms showed no obvious differences between different subgenotypes infections (Table S1 ). Considering the increasing case number and the proportion of HCoV-NL63 single infection, this should be a smallscale outbreak associated with HCoV-NL63 in Guangzhou, China, in 2018 indicating HCoV-NL63 is a more important human pathogen than is commonly believed.",

Clean data was used for assembling or mapping against the reference sequence (NC_005831.2) of HCoV-NL63 (Figure 2A ). Using both next-generation and Sanger sequencing technology, five complete genomes and nine partial spike protein sequences of HCoV-NL63 were obtained and analysed in this study ( Figure 2B ). Other HCoV-NL63 sequences were not obtained because of low viral load in respiratory specimens. To investigate genetic relationship between HCoV-NL63 strains detected in this study and other HCoV-NL63 strains available in GenBank, we performed phylogenetic analyses based on partial spike gene sequences. All available HCoV-NL63 strains were collected and divided into three genotypes (genotypes A, B and C) based on phylogenetic analyses of partial S genes ( Figure 3 ). Genotype A was further divided into subtypes A1, A2 and A3. Genotype C contained three subgenotypes C1, C2 and C3. We also performed phylogenetic analyses based on complete genome, orf1ab and spike genes, respectively (Figure 4 ). Phylogenetic trees based on orf1ab, spike genes and complete genome showed similar topologies with seven sub-genotypes, which further confirmed the phylogenetic structure and supported a new subgenotype C3 circulating in Guangzhou, China (Figure 4 ). There were two subgenotypes (C3 and B) of HCoV-NL63 circulating in South China, Guangzhou, which associated with increasing numbers of severe respiratory illness in 2018.

Fourteen HCoV-NL63 spike gene partial sequences detected in this study were used for phylogenetic analysis by MEGA 7.0 software using Neighbourjoining method and further confirmed the presence of new subgenotype of HCoV-NL63. Bootstrap values greater than 60% were considered statistically significant for grouping. shared a common origin and formed a new subgenotype C3 on the same branch with other HCoV-NL63 subgenotypes. Meanwhile the old genotype B was also circulating in China which was identified previously from American clinical specimen [23] . In summary, the discovery of the new subgenotype C3 emphasized the risk of an epidemic caused by a mutated HCoV-NL63.",

The infectivity of pseudotyped HCoV-NL63 was detected by luciferase reaction in Huh7 cells. Cell control serves as the negative control to determine background. As showed in Figure 7 (A and B), in both lentiviral and VSV system mutant pseudotyped (507 L) showed increased viral entry into susceptible cells compared to WT. The higher viral entry may be associated with increased transmission and case number in human in South China. Sequences alignment between subgenotype C3 and B indicated only one SNP (E471D) was located in RBD region. To directly compare viral entry between subgenotypes B and C3, pseudotype bearing E471D mutation was prepared. No difference was observed between E471D mutant and WT in Figure 7 (C and D). The crystal structure of HCoV-NL63 RBD complexed with its receptor ACE2 has been published previously [24] and three key RBMs (receptor binding motifs) were defined as RBM1 (residues 493-513), RBM2 (residues 531-541) and RBM3 (residues 585-590).
