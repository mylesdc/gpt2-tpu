Most HIV-1 infected individuals worldwide are women, who acquire HIV infections during sexual contact. Blocking HIV mucosal transmission and local spread in the female lower genital tract is important in preventing infection and ultimately eliminating the pandemic. Microbicides work by destroying the microbes or preventing them from establishing an infection. Thus, a number of different types of microbicides are under investigation, however, the lack of their solubility and bioavailability, and toxicity has been major hurdles. Herein, we report the development of multifunctional chitosan-lipid nanocomplexes that can effectively deliver plasmids encoding siRNA(s) as microbicides without adverse effects and provide significant protection against HIV in both in vitro and in vivo models. Chitosan or chitosan-lipid (chlipid) was complexed with a cocktail of plasmids encoding HIV-1-specific siRNAs (psiRNAs) and evaluated for their efficacy in HEK-293 cells, PBMCs derived from nonhuman primates, 3-dimensional human vaginal ectocervical tissue (3D-VEC) model and also in non-human primate model. Moreover, prophylactic administration of the chlipid to deliver a psiRNA cocktail intravaginally with a cream formulation in a non-human primate model showed substantial reduction of SHIV (simian/human immunodeficiency virus SF162) viral titers. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the potential of chlipid-siRNA nanocomplexes as a potential genetic microbicide against HIV infections.",

Based on our success using chitosan-nanoparticles to deliver siRNAs to mice, we tested a cocktail of anti-HIV siRNA nanoparticles for preventing SHIV-1 transmission in a macaque model in a pilot study. The results showed that the anti-HIV siRNA microbicide cocktail can be selectively delivered by CNs to HIV-susceptible cells in mucosal tissues.",

These siRNAs were developed based on recombinant simianhuman immunodeficiency virus, SHIV89.6p chimeric lentiviruses: namely, SHIVs consisting of a SIVmac239 backbone and HIV type 1 (HIV-1) envelope (env) and regulatory genes. HIVspecific siRNAs were cloned between the BamHI and the HindIII sites of pSilencer1.0-U6 (Ambion). When the top strand and the bottom strand of each siRNA-encoding DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized, the BamHI site was included in the 5'-end of siRNA with 10 additional random nucleotides as flanking sequences, and the HindIII site was included in the 3'end of siRNA with 10 other nucleotides as flanking sequences. Each siRNA contained a 21-nt siRNA sense element, which is identical to the targeted gene sequences, then a 8-nt loop region, followed by 21 nt of the antisense elements and a double-T overhang. The siRNA targeting sequences (the sense element) are at position of 142 nt of LTR, 59 nt of Gag, 57 nt of Tat and 42 nt of Rev in the HIV89.6 genome, and 70 nt of rhesus macaque CCR5 and 97 nt of rhesus macaque CXCR4. The top strand and the bottom strand of each siRNA-encoding oligonucleotide were annealed and then digested with Apa1 and EcoR1 before cloning into pSilen-cer1.0-U6. The primer pairs for the respective siRNAs are shown in Table 1 .",

Mice were given intranasally (i.n.) 10 \u03bcg of Lipofectamine + 10\u03bcg of plasmid DNA encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). Mice were sacrificed on day 4 and their lungs were lavaged with 1 ml of PBS introduced through the trachea. The BAL fluid was centrifuged (10 for min at 300 x g) and the cells were rinsed with PBS and re-suspended. Mice were given PBS as control. Pooled cells from four mice were also quantified by flow cytometry to determine the EGFP transfection levels in BAL cells. Mice BAL fluid was analyzed for IL-6 content using an ELISA (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). An improved RVI model was used to evaluate microbicide formulations for their effects in tissues by analyses of histopathology, cellular infiltration, apoptosis, and mucosal permeability. In cervicovaginal lavages (CVL), supernatants can be evaluated for cytokines and leukocyte markers, and the cell pellet can be used to quantitate, phenotype, and measure the activation status of the leukocytes. In this study, chlipids and plasmid siRNA cocktail mixed with an antiinflammatory cream (C5-Biotechnology Inc., Tampa, FL) were administered intravaginally to healthy rabbits. The increase in the number of CD45+ leukocytes in the CVL was determined at the termination of treatment. Three groups consisting of two female rabbits each were maintained under the same environmental conditions and dosed daily with either 10 mg of cream alone or cream plus CNs or a mixture of cream plus CNs containing plasmid siRNA cocktail (consisting of siCCR5, siCXCR4, siTat, siRev, si5'LTR and siGag; 4 \u03bcg per plasmid /animal) for 10 days.

A group of five cycling rhesus monkeys weighing 6-9 kg and negative for type D retrovirus, SIV and simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV) were selected for the in vivo experiment. All macaques used were pretreated with a single intramuscular dose of Depo-Provera (30 mg/animal) 30 days before the study. The group of five macaques was divided into 2 control and 3 treatment monkeys. A mixture of cream (20 mg) and CNs containing psiRNA cocktail were applied vaginally on days 1, 3 and 6. The control group received a mixture of cream and CNs. On day 6 all the animals were inoculated vaginally with 250 \u03bcl (3000 TCID50/ml) of the SHIV SF162-p3 (procured from NIH). All the animals were bled periodically (days 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 20, 34 and 42) and plasma viral load was measured.

Later, 10 \u03bcl of the amplified product was quantified by anti-DIG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PCR enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay DIG detection, Roche), according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the probe at 20 nM concentration: 5'-CAT TTG GAT TAG CAG AAA GCC TGT TGG AGA ACA AAG AAG GATGTCAA-3'. All the samples were tested in duplicate. The standard used was a culture supernatant containing free SHIV SF162 aliquoted and diluted in plasma from a sero negative macaque collected in EDTA. All five macaques (2 control and 3 treatment animals) were infected with SHIV and the titer was determined by RNA copies/ml post infection. Viral titers were measured by the absorbance readings at 405 nm both before and after infection. Viral RNA copy numbers were estimated based on a standard curve.",

Currently, microbicide development efforts are focusing on compounds with highly potent and HIV-specific mechanisms of action, combination products, novel formulations and carefully designed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations [28] . All of the products in phase III are non-specific microbicides, which have been shown to be moderately effective in preliminary or reported studies. The latest Phase III study of PRO 2000 in 9,400 women showed that PRO 2000 does not offer protection against HIV. However, a study that enrolled 889 women in South Africa suggests that a vaginal microbicide containing tenofovir may be effective [29] . The sample size is relatively small, which restrict the finding that tenofovir reduces the risk of HIV transmission in heterosexual women. Moreover, microbicides based on the HIV-1 neutralizing antibody VRC01 or the combination of four first-generation broad neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs)-b12, 2F5, 4E10, and 2G12, showed protection against HIV-1 challenge in humanized BLT mouse model [30] . These studies suggested that we should not continue our investigation focused on the early generation, novel non-specific microbicides. These results also raise little doubt that at this juncture, agents with specific action against HIV, such as anti-retroviral drugs or targeted siRNAs, offer the most hope.",

Previously, others have developed DNA vector-based approaches to introduce siRNA into tissue culture systems and in vivo against HIV, HCV, RSV, SARS, and dengue virus as well as other viruses [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . siRNAs are used to inhibit HIV-1 by targeting various viral proteins or cellular cofactors that are important for HIV replication. The cellular receptor CD4, co-receptor CCR5, and viral Tat, Rev and Gag proteins are among the successful targets first reported in 2002 [34, 35, 37, 39, 41] . Other siRNAs targeting CXCR4, DC-SIGN, human transcription elongation factor P-TEFb or cyclophilin A were also shown to be effective in inhibiting HIV-1 replication in vitro [32, 33, 36, 38, 40, 43, 44, 46] . siRNAs can be introduced into cells as synthetic doubled-stranded RNAs, but are more effective when expressed from a plasmid under control of the RNA polymerase III promoter. Silencing CD4 reduced CD4 expression in 75% of Magi-CCR5 cells and reduced HIV-1 replication four-fold compared with the control [41] . The degree of inhibition was similar when siRNA-targeting CCR5 was tested in PBLs from different donors (3-7 fold of HIV-1 inhibition) [43] . Some synthetic Safety studies in RVI model. Rabbits (n = 9) were divided into three groups and in each group (n = 3) we applied cream alone, cream mixed with chlipid nanocomplexes, or cream mixed with psicocktail chlipid nanocomplexes every day for 9 days. In the RVI model, the CVL was collected at days 11 and 20, the cells were cytospun, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 100% methanol. The cells were later treated with anti-CD45 tagged with Alexa Fluor 555 and viewed under a fluorescence microscope. Images were taken at 100x magnification. The two panels on the right show H&E-staining of the cells from CVL of rabbits treated as described above.",

Thus, a cocktail of siRNAs targeting different HIV-1 gene sequences would be more likely to avoid HIV-1 mutant escape. By including siRNAs targeting HIV-1 coreceptors of CCR5 or CXCR4, additional advantages can be achieved to prevent HIV-1 transmission, because siRNA targeting HIV-1 coreceptors are not affected by mutations of the HIV-1 viral genome. Silencing of DC-SIGN by siRNA also significantly inhibited HIV-1 replication, presumably by preventing the transfer of virus from DCs to T cells. DC-SIGN is an additional target in controlling HIV-1 for our future optimization of psiRNA cocktail [32] . Although the viral titer was significantly lower in the group treated by siRNAbased microbicide around day 42, complete block of SHIV infection was obtained in our studies. The efficacy of our nanomicrobicides may have been restricted by the SHIV/macaque model, because siGag and siLTR are both target HIV sequences instead of SIV sequences. An alternative option is to test the efficacy of our nanomicrobicides in humanized BLT mice challenged by HIV-1, as humanized mouse model have been recognized as an easy approach with much potential for vaccine studies [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] .",
