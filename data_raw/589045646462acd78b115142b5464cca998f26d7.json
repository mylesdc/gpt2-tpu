Direct evidence was that intravascular injection of VEGF into healthy mice induced endothelial gaps and subsequent vascular permeability 9 . Also, the VEGF family plays a paramount role in promoting angiogenesis or vasculogenesis, which may be induced by local hypoxic conditions to promote survival, migration, and proliferation of endothelial cells (including EPCs) 10 . So, VEGF may not only be associated with positive revascularization of damaged tissue but also may contribute to edema. On the other hand, in a rat femoral head model of vessel deprivationinduced osteonecrosis, high VEGF expression accounted for the striking bone resorption-related remodeling of necrotic debris early during repair, with subsequent substitution by newly formed bone 11, 12 . It is known that continuously high VEGF exposure, however, serves as a chemoattractant for osteoclasts to induce osteoclastogenesis for bone resorption in vitro through a matrix metalloproteinase 9-dependent mechanism, which is similar to signaling pathways involving RANKL 13, 14 .",

For example, Src, as a downstream molecule of VEGF signaling, participates in mediating VEGF-induced vascular permeability in myocardial infarction mouse model 9 . Generally, Src family kinases (SFKs) representing a family of 9 similar proteins include Src, Blk, Fgr, Fyn, Hck, Lck, Lyn, Yes and Yrk 15 . The reviewed evidence just demonstrated selective requirement for Src kinases during VEGF-induced angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Briefly, mice lacking individual Src family kinases (e.g. Src) showed normal VEGF-induced angiogenesis, while mice deficient in Src showed no VEGF-induced vascular permeability. This suggests that VEGF-mediated angiogenesis requires SFK activity in general, whereas vascular permeability mediated by VEGF specifically depended on Src 16 . On the other hand, Src-deficient osteoclasts display decreased migration and fail to form a polarized ruffled membrane during bone resorption 17 . Furthermore, targeted disruption of Src in mice causes a defect in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, leading to osteopetrosis 18 . Normal osteoclast function can be rescued by bone-specific expression of Src in Src knockout mice 19 . Similar results have been found in vitro 20, 21 . Suppression of Src also interferes with ion transport, which is required to solubilize bone mineral during bone resorption by osteoclasts 22 .",

Results from the dynamic MRI perfusion function index, Micro-CT-based angiography, and histomorphometry of marrow circulation consistently demonstrated that anti-VEGF reduced both neovascularization and permeability, whereas a Src inhibitor did not reduce neovascularization but did reduce permeability. In addition, immunoblotting for phosphorylated Src also demonstrated significantly decreased Src phospho-Y418 levels in the Src-Inhibition, Anti-VEGF and Supplement & Inhibition Groups at each postadministration time point. Taken together, these results suggest that uncontrolled VEGF-Src signaling underlies the observed continuous increase in vascular permeability during inadequate repair of steroidassociated osteonecrosis, which is consistent with a recent consensus that normal vascular turnover requires precise spatiotemporal control of VEGF expression 28 . Accordingly, it encourages use of a selective blockade strategy of Src signaling for both maintaining VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and abolishing VEGF-mediated permeability to facilitate repair.",

In contrast, VEGF promoted destructive repair as evidenced by 100% incidence of destructive repair and moderately left shifted size distribution curve of trabecular thickness in VEGF-Supplement Group compared to the Control. VEGF is a chemoattractant for osteoclasts to induce osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo through a matrix metalloprotease 9-dependent mechanism, which is similar to signaling pathways involving receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) 13, [29] [30] [31] . These data suggest a potential link between uncontrolled VEGF signaling and destructive repair of steroid-associated osteonecrotic lesions for test- ing a therapeutic strategy by blocking uncontrolled VEGF signaling, which not only challenges the traditionally held opinion that enhanced VEGF signaling might augment bone repair, but also raises an emerging concept that uncontrolled VEGF signaling could induce destructive repair when MSCP is at a continuously low level.",

This could be explained by the significantly reduced vascular permeability caused by the Src inhibitor to avoid diverting blood away from the lesion center towards its periphery and accordingly facilitating delivery of oxygen and nutrients to local lesions for tissue reconstructional repair 32 .

Based on our established protocol for inducing steroid-associated osteonecrosis development 7,24-26 , all the rabbits were intravenously injected once with 10 mg/kg body weight of lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) on day 0. After 24 hours, three injections of 20 mg/kg body weight of methylprednisolone (Pharmacia & Upjohn, USA) were given intramuscularly at a 24-hour interval. At 0 (pre-induction/baseline) and 1 week after induction, bone marrow aspiration from iliac crest was conducted to determine size of marrow stem cell pool (SI-MSCP) in hematopoietic and mesenchymal compartment according to our published protocol 7 . At 2 weeks after induction, 121 rabbits with a decrease of at least 70% in SI-MSCP of both mesenchymal and hematopoietic compartment were identified as high riskers for progress to destructive repair within osteonecrotic lesions according to the published findings 7 . The selected rabbits were systemically administrated by intravenous injection with either Anti-VEGF antibody (recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-VEGF at 33 mg/kg/two weeks, Anti-VEGF Group, n 5 23) or VEGF (recombinant human VEGF at 0.05 mg/kg/two weeks, VEGF-Supplement Group, n 5 23) or Src inhibitor (PP1, selective inhibitor of Src activity with IC 50 of 170 nM, 0.3 mg/kg/two weeks), Src-Inhibition Group, n 5 23) or a combination of VEGF and Src inhibitor (recombinant human VEGF at 0.05 mg/kg/two weeks and Src inhibitor PP1 at 0.3 mg/kg/two weeks, Supplement & Inhibition Group, n 5 23) and control vehicle (Saline, Control Group, n 5 23) for 4 weeks. Six rabbits were sacrificed as baseline before administration. The sample size in each group was calculated according to our published paper 7 . At 0, 2 and 4 weeks after administration, in vivo dynamic MRI was performed on proximal femora for vascularization index and permeability index, respectively. After finishing dynamic MRI scan, euthanasia was also executed at 2 (n 5 8) and 4 (n 5 15) weeks after administration in each group. Bilateral proximal femora were dissected after sacrifice for the following evaluation on intraosseous vasculature, including three-dimensional angiography by micro-CT and two-dimensional histomorphometry of marrow circulation by optical microscopy. Repair pattern of osteonecrotic lesions was both qualitatively classified by histopathology and quantificationally differentiated by micro-CT. Local phosphorylated Src protein expression was quantified by immunoblotting.",

A bolus of dimeglumine gadopentetate (Magnevist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) (0.3 mmol/kg/body weight) was rapidly injected by an automatic pump linked to a previously placed 21-gauge catheter into an auditory vein. Dynamic MRI scans were performed in the prescribed plane with the following parameters: short T1-weighted gradient echo sequence, TR/TE 5 4/1.4 msec, flip angle 5 15, slice thickness 5 5 mm, in-plane resolution 5 0.86 3 0.86 mm, average 5 1. The temporal resolution was approximately 0.6 s per image acquisition. A series of dynamic images were obtained in 600 s to cover the wash-out phase 3, 24, 37, 38 .

            "text": "Histomorphometry of Marrow Circulation: For micro-vessel density (MVD), fifteen successive hematoxylin and eosin-stained 6-mm-thick sections from every decalcified sample were scanned initially at low magnification and then at high magnification to identify vascular 'hot-spots' 44,45 using the Optical Microscope imaging system (Zeiss). Selection of the hot-spot has been adopted as a standard procedure for angiogenesis studies in both solid neoplasms and for hematological oncology 46 . It is thought that such areas of increased concentration of micro-vessels may represent the emergence of a neoplastic clone with a higher angiogenic potential 47 . For each countable micro-vessel, an outline was traced to calculate the total count of micro-vessels per total examined optical fields in those successive sections from bilateral decalcified femoral samples in one rabbit (Micro-vessel Density) using image analysis software (ImageJ 1.32j, NIH, USA). For edema area (EA), the above histological sections were scanned to identify the interstitial marrow edema zone by OM. For each section, four randomly selected fields (up, down, left, right) were examined. The marrow edema zone was automatically traced by thresholding using ImageJ 1.32j 24 . The total area of the edema zone per total examined optical field area in those successive sections from bilateral decalcified femoral samples (Edema Area) in one rabbit were calculated accordingly. For size distribution of leakage particles, the above sections were examined with OM to identify leakage particles in the region corresponding to the scanned volume of interest during the above-mentioned Micro-CT-based micro-angiography. An easily distinguished black radiopaque particle (perfused angiographic substance) outside of a blood vessel was defined as a leakage particle. For each leakage particle, the outline was manually traced to quantify its area and perimeter using ImageJ 1.32j. Based on the stereology principle in bone histomorphometry 48 , leakage particle size was calculated as follows: Thickness 5 2000/ 1.199 3 (Area/Perimeter). A histogram to display the size distribution of all the leakage particles in those successive sections from bilateral decalcified femoral samples in one rabbit was generated using Excel 2007 (Microsoft, USA).",

            "text": "(6 weeks post-induction), 10 of those 15 rabbits in Control group had dominant destructive repair, whereas 1 of 15, 2 of 15, 15 of 15 and 3 of 15 rabbits had dominant destructive repair in Anti-VEGF Group, Src-Inhibition Group, VEGF-Supplement Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group, respectively. The incidence of the destructive repair in the Anti-VEGF Group, Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group was all significantly lower than that in the Control Group, whereas it was significantly higher in the VEGF-Supplement Group (15/15) when compared to the Control Group. There are even 1 and 3 rabbits showed dominant reparative osteogenesis in the Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group respectively. The repair pattern in the rest of the rabbits can not be clearly identified. (Figure 1) Measurement of Trabecular Structure in Osteonecrotic Lesions. For trabecular structure of osteonecrotic lesions by micro-CT measurement, there is no difference in quantities of either smallsized (0.036 , 0.2 mm) or large-sized (0.2 , 0.4 mm) trabecular bone between Anti-VEGF Group and Baseline Group. Compared to that at Baseline, less large-sized and more small-sized trabecular bones were found in Control Group and VEGF-Supplement Group, whereas more large-sized and less small-sized trabecular bone were found in Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group. Apparently, the size distribution of the trabeculae shifted toward thinning in the Control Group when compared to the baseline, and it further shifted toward thinning in the VEGF-Supplement Group when compared to the Control Group, whereas it hardly shifted in the Anti-VEGF Group or shifted toward moderately thickening in Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group when compared to the baseline. (Figure 2) Vascular Function Index. Time-course changes in dynamic MRIderived vasculature function index are shown in Figure 3. For the vascularization index (peak enhancement percentage, PEP), a significantly different pattern of PEP change over time in VEGF-Supplement Group, Supplement & Inhibition Group and Anti-VEGF Group compared to Control Group was evidenced by the Two-way repeat measures ANOVA (P , 0.05 for interaction between 'Time' and 'Group'). The PEP in the VEGF-Supplement Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group increased continuously and significantly from baseline at 2 weeks and 4 weeks postadministration (25% for VEGF-Supplement Group, 30% for Supplement & Inhibition Group at week 2 and 32% for VEGF-Supplement Group, 35% for Supplement & Inhibition Group at week 4, P , 0.05 for all); while it decreased continuously from Baseline in Anti-VEGF Group at 2 weeks and 4 weeks postadministration (220% at week 2 and 228% at week 4, P , 0.05 www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 5 : 8856 | DOI: 10.1038/srep08856 for both).It remained almost constant in the Control Group and increased gradually without significance in Src-Inhibition Group. For the permeability index ('permeability surface area product per unit volume of tissue', PSr), a significantly different pattern of PSr change over time in VEGF-Supplement Group, Src-Inhibition Group, Supplement & Inhibition Group and Ant-VEGF Group compared to Control Group was evidenced by the General Linear Model (GLM) (P , 0.05 for interaction between 'Time' and 'Group'). The PSr in the Src-Inhibition Group, Supplement & Inhibition Group and Ant-VEGF Group decreased continuously and significantly from baseline at 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-administration (229% for Src-Inhibition Group, 221% Supplement & Inhibition Group and 230% for Ant-VEGF Group at week 2 and 239% for Src-Inhibition Group, 228% Supplement & Inhibition Group and 236% for Ant-VEGF Group P , 0.05 for all); while it increased continuously from Baseline in VEGF-Supplement Group at 2 weeks and 4 weeks post-administration (19% at week 2 and 23% at week 4, P , 0.05 for both).It remained almost constant in the Control Group (Figure 3).
