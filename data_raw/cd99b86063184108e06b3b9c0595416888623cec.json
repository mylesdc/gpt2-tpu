This study examined the combined use of an ELISA and Western blot (WB) to detect antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (N) of IBV. The coding sequence for N was amplified by RT-PCR and expressed in Escherichia coli. A soluble recombinant N protein (rN) of approximately 50 kDa was obtained. A total of 389 sera were tested against the rN in ELISA and the results were compared with those of the commercial IDEXX IBV Ab test. ELISA-rN achieved a 90.34% sensitivity and 90.16% specificity. WB confirmed all false negative sera in ELISA-rN or IDEXX test as truly positive. The current study indicate that the combined use of rN in ELISA and WB is a powerful tool for the immunodiagnosis of avian infectious bronchitis.",

A total of 389 serum samples from chickens were used to develop and evaluate the ELISA-rN test. To standardize the indirect ELISA development, serum dilutions (1:100, 1:200 and 1:400) and different concentrations of purified rN antigen (50, 100 and 200 ng/well) were tested. Positive and negative sera for IBV were used as controls. The results were compared with those obtained from a commercial kit. Serum samples scored as negative with the commercial kit but as positive with the ELISA-rN were further analysed by Western blot analyses using the rN protein as an antigen. The results of the ELISA-rN were compared to the commercial kit results using receiver-operating characteristics curves, area under the curve, and confidence intervals with the software GraphPad Prism version 6.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, USA).",

The rN was expressed as a soluble protein to avoid the refolding steps and, after purification a yield of 10 mg/L of rN was obtained. The SDS-PAGE results demonstrated the presence of two distinct bands that had a molecular mass of approximately 45 and 50 KDa. Out of 244 sera that scored positive in the commercial ELISA IDEXX IBV Ab Test, 220 were also positive in the ELISA-rN, yielding an ELISA-rN test sensitivity of 90.16%. Out of 145 sera that scored negative in the IDEXX IBV Ab Test, 131 also scored negative in the ELISA-rN, indicating a specificity of 90.34%. Sera that tested negative in the ELISA-rN and positive in the commercial test also reacted with the rN protein in Western blot. Conclusions: The association between the ELISA and Western blot techniques developed in this study with a subunit of IBV (rN) were able to detect antibodies that the commercial ELISA did not detect suggesting that the ELISA-rN has greater sensitivity.",

            "text": "Keywords: IBV, Nucleoprotein, Recombinant antigen, Diagnosis, Indirect ELISA Background Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is caused by a virus in the Coronaviridae family, genera Gammacoronavirus. It is a highly contagious disease with a short incubation period [1] . The Avian coronavirus was previously classified, and is most commonly referred to, as avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The IBV is responsible for respiratory disease, which manifests in clinical symptoms such as sneezing and tracheal-bronchial rales that can lead to the development of more severe symptoms [2, 3] . Infected birds exhibit reduced performance, consequently leading to a reduction in weight gain and deterioration in egg quality and quantity. Secondary bacterial infections will also contribute to economic losses. Carcass condemnation due to the development of airsacculitis [4, 5] negatively impacts commercial sales of bird meat and eggs. Brazil was once the world's largest exporter of poultry and currently the world's third largest producer of bird meat [6] . The consequences of IBV are a significant threat to Brazil's poultry industry.",

It encodes non-structural (accessory proteins) and four structural proteins: the nucleocapsid protein (N), the spike protein (S), the envelope protein (E), and the matrix protein (M). The nucleocapsid protein, or N protein, consists of 409 amino acids. It has a molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa and directly binds with the viral genome to form the virion nucleocapsid [6, 7] . Its structure is highly conserved, with different strains of IBV sharing a high degree of identity (94-99%) [8] . The N protein is also known for its immunogenicity, inducing specific antibody and cytotoxic T-cells mediated responses [9, 10] . There is significant interest in the use of the IBV N protein as an important target for diagnosis since it possesses the antigenic characteristics required for the development of serological assays that can be applied to detect or quantify antibodies against the IBV [11] .",

The use of nucleoprotein as the antigen for diagnosis and evaluation of vaccine immune responses is an interesting target to explore since this protein plays a important role in IBV virus replication and the induction of a specific immune response in infected birds [16, 17] . The use of recombinant antigens in the design of a specific diagnostic technique facilitates the development of highly sensitive and specific assays that display a high antigen concentration and, thereby, reduce or eliminate background reactions. The use of recombinant antigens also represents a viable method of reducing immunoassay development costs. Easy production of antigens in expression systems leads to simple and efficient antigen development which can reduce the production costs associated with diagnosis [18] .

Serum samples from chickens with a positive diagnosis for Newcastle disease were used for the evaluation of the ELISA-rN specificity. The samples used in this study originated from birds with a known history of vaccination, including vaccination against the Newcastle disease virus, and were categorized into three groups: commercial egg-layers, broiler breeders, and meat-producing chickens.

To determine the cutoff value, negative sera were used, totalizing 20 sera, considering the mean of sera added of two standard deviation. The ROC analysis was used to simulate the influence of different cutoff values on the sensitivity and specificity of the test. The results were compared with those obtained with the commercial kit.

The Western blot technique may prove useful for epidemiological studies, for monitoring specific pathogen free farms, and in vaccine potency tests.

The production of rN was repeatable since the same ELISA-rN test results, and about the same yield, were obtained when different production and purification times were used.",

However, the N protein offers specific advantages when used for the purpose of diagnosis during viral infection since it is produced in larger quantities than the S protein (the N proteins is produced at a ratio of 6:1 relative to the S protein [24] and plays an important role in the virus's replications and assembly process [25] .

The yield of rN per litre of LB broth culture would coat approximately 1000 96-well microtiter plates allowing for the diagnostic analysis of approximately 45,000 serum samples in duplicate. Also noteworthy is the production cost reduction from using rN in a soluble form, since this eliminates costs associated with the refolding step while it also preserves important conformational epitopes. The currently available commercial test on the other hand, employs the whole IBV as an antigen which requires viral propagation and the implementation of robust laboratory biosafety standards [23] .",

This could be of concern as false negative results are undesirable, especially if a lot of birds are misdiagnosed. Thus, the ELISA-rN could be applied together with the WB developed in this study for the routine detection of IBV in diagnostic laboratories. False negative results that contribute to the spread of the disease can be avoided, or at least decreased, when the two tests are applied together.",
