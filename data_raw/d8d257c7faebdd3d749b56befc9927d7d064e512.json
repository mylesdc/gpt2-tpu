            "text": "The herbs Plantago asiatica and Clerodendrum trichotomum have been commonly used for centuries in indigenous and folk medicine in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. In this study, we show that extracts from these herbs have antiviral effects against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in vitro cell cultures and an in vivo mouse model. Treatment of HEp2 cells and A549 cells with a non-cytotoxic concentration of Plantago asiatica or Clerodendrum trichotomum extract significantly reduced RSV replication, RSV-induced cell death, RSV gene transcription, RSV protein synthesis, and also blocked syncytia formation. Interestingly, oral inoculation with each herb extract significantly improved viral clearance in the lungs of BALB/c mice. Based on reported information and a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, the phenolic glycoside acteoside was identified as an active chemical component of both herb extracts. An effective dose of acteoside exhibited similar antiviral effects as each herb extract against RSV in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these results suggest that extracts of Plantago asiatica and Clerodendrum trichotomum could provide a potent natural source of an antiviral drug candidate against RSV infection.",

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the major causes of lower respiratory tract infections, which cause a huge global disease burden [1] . It is the most important viral agent of serious respiratory tract illness in infants and young children. Nearly all infants have been infected with RSV at least once by the age of two years [2] . RSV is also a major cause of acute respiratory illness in the elderly, and it can have a detrimental effect in immune-compromised individuals. Even though RSV infection generally occurs at an early age, individuals may be re-infected throughout their lifetime, because naturally acquired immunity does not provide persistent protection [3] . At present, RSV vaccines and antiviral drugs are in the preclinical and clinical stage of development; however, no RSV vaccines or antiviral drugs suitable for typical use are commercially available at this time [4] .",

Modern analytical technologies applied towards the active compounds found in plants have allowed for greater insights into plant-derived pharmaceutical compounds [8] . Plantago asiatica is a perennial belonging to the family Plantaginaceae and is commonly used as a folk medicine in Korea, China, and Japan [9] . Plantago asiatica extract (PAE) has been used to treat a variety of health conditions, such as wounds, cholesterolemia, diarrhea, bronchitis, and chronic constipation [10] [11] [12] . Moreover, it has been shown to inhibit cancer and leukemia growth and to enhance cell-mediated immunity [13] . Clerodendrum trichotomum is a deciduous shrub that belongs to the family Lamiaceae (formerly Verbenaceae) and is widely distributed in South Korea, China, Japan, and the Philippines. Clerodendrum trichotomum extract (CTE) possesses broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory [14, 15] , anti-hypertensive [16] , anti-asthmatic [17] , anti-oxidative [18] and immunotoxin [19] properties.

For this experiment, a GFP assay was performed with some modifications, as described previously [25, 26] . Briefly, RSV-GFP virus was used, and a 50% reduction in GFP expression was considered equivalent to a 50% reduction in virus titer. As shown in Figure 3D ,F, PAE and CTE inhibited RSV-GFP infection (MOI, 0.1) by 50% at concentrations of 39.82 \u00b5g/mL and 27.95 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Next, we determined the CC 50 values of the two extracts based on a cell cytotoxicity assay using HEp2 cells. The assay showed CC 50 values of 938.43 \u00b5g/mL and 764.17 \u00b5g/mL for PAE and CTE, respectively ( Figure 3F,G) . Interestingly, the cell viability at the effective concentrations of both extracts was greater than 80%. The selectivity index (SI) indicates the safety of a crude extract against RSV infection [19] . The SIs of PAE and CTE were 23.5 and 27.3, respectively ( Figure 3H ). This data suggests that both PAE and CTE could be used safely as therapeutic agents against RSV infection. To calculate EC 50 value, 50% reduction of GFP expression was considered as equivalent to the 50% reduction in virus titer. The ratio between CC 50 and EC 50 was considered as Selectivity Index (SI). GFP absorbance and cell viability expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. Error bars indicate the range of values obtained from counting duplicate in three independent experiments. (** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 regarded as significant difference).",

            "text": "It has been previously reported that acteoside is an important phenolic glycoside in PAE [27] and CTE [15, 17] . To investigate for the presence of this glycoside in PAE and CTE, we performed reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on extracts from PAE and CTE. Interestingly, we found that both extracts contained acteoside as one of their major active components ( Figure 5A ). To assess the antiviral effect of acteoside, a monolayer of HEp2 cells was infected with RSV-GFP, and at 2 hpi, cells were treated with 10, 30, or 50 ng/mL acteoside and virus replication were monitored. As reported in Figure 5C ,D, acteoside treatment significantly reduced the GFP expression compared to untreated HEp2 cells. Furthermore, virus titers were determined by plaque formation assay. Similar to the results of the GFP expression analysis, acteoside significantly reduced the RSV plaque titer ( Figure 5E ). Cell death induced by RSV infection was also reduced in acteoside-treated HEp2 cells compared with untreated cells ( Figure 5F ). Next, the EC 50 and CC 50 of acteoside were determined in HEp2 cells as 15.64 \u00b1 1.07 ng/mL and 740.34 \u00b1 8.23 ng/mL, respectively ( Figure 5G,H) . The SI of acteoside against RSV-GFP was 47.33 ( Figure 5I ). Based on this data, the reduced viral replication caused by actioside ( Figure 5C -F) was due to its antiviral properties and not its cytotoxicity. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expression of viral genes in HEp2 cells treated with acteoside was determined, as with the herb extracts. Interestingly, acteoside-treated cells showed significantly reduced RSV-G mRNA compared with untreated cells (1.7-fold reduction at 36 hpi and 4-fold reduction at 48 hpi) ( Figure 6A ). Similarly, RSV-G protein synthesis was inhibited by acteoside treatment ( Figure 6B ). Therefore, our results demonstrate that acteoside can inhibit RSV replication in HEp2 cells.",

Interestingly, PAE and CTE-treated HEp2 cells showed significantly reduced RSV-G mRNA at 36 and 48 hpi ( Figure 4A ). This reduction in viral mRNA transcription positively correlated with the low level of viral replication observed at the same time points (Figure 2A,B) . Furthermore, PAE-and CTE-treated HEp2 cells showed significantly reduced RSV-G protein synthesis at late time points after virus infection ( Figure 4B ,C). Therefore, it is possible that PAE and CTE may affect the replication of RSV not only at the transcriptional level, but also at the posttranscriptional level. Syncytium formation by RSV is a well-known mechanism of cell-to-cell infection that contributes significantly to virus spread in vivo. PAE and CTE also significantly reduced the RSV-dependent formation of syncytia in HEp2 cells ( Figure 4D ). Since both herb extracts could inhibit RSV replication in vitro, we went on to test their antiviral potential in vivo. In vivo replication of RSV can also be accurately assessed by qRT-PCR [40] .",

Phenylethanoid glycosides are one of the major bioactive constituents present in both Plantago asiatica [46] and Clerodendrum trichotomum [47] . HPLC analysis was conducted to confirm this finding ( Figure 5A) , and acteoside was identified as one of the major constituents of both PAE and CTE. Acteoside, also called kusagin or verbascoside [48] , is a phenylethanoid glycoside isolated from many dicotyledons. Reportedly, acteoside has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and prevents cell apoptosis [39, 49] . A recent study demonstrated that acteoside induced ERK activation and subsequent IFN-\u03b3 production; thus, showed antiviral activity against influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [28] . Based on these reported findings, we evaluated the antiviral effect of acteoside against RSV. Interestingly, acteoside reduced RSV replication and virus-induced cell death in HEp2 cells ( Figure 5E ,F) similar to PAE or CTE treatment. In addition, the SI of acteoside against RSV in vitro indicates a high safety margin for its therapeutic effect ( Figure 5I ). We also confirmed that acteoside reduced the level of RSV-G mRNA and RSV-G protein synthesis at 36 and 48 hpi ( Figure 6A ). Specifically, intraperitoneal treatment with acteoside showed an anti-RSV effect in a mouse model ( Figure 6C) . These results are similar to the antiviral activity of acteoside against Influenza or VSV [28] . However, further studies demonstrating a detailed mechanism of how acteoside inhibit RSV replication are needed.",
