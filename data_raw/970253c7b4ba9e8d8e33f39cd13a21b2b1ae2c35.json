Our approach is based on PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) method of systematic literature review ). However our objective was not to identify all papers reporting pathogen findings but rather to generate a representative sample that could be used to determine pathogens that have existing surveillance studies. To implement this sampling we identified keywords to search three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for papers reporting surveillance results, or case reports for any pathogen or disease in wild pigs in North America. In order for an article to be included the paper must have contained the terms from Table S3 in the title, key words or abstract. All scientific peer reviewed literature from Journals and edited book volumes describing any wild pig pathogens in North America was considered eligible. We excluded so called 'gray literature' such as government reports, technical documents or other similar documents. These documents, while potentially containing valuable data, could not be sampled effectively using our approach and may have biased our findings. In addition, the results from many of these documents likely had corresponding peer review papers.",

Supporting literature including reference texts were made available during the review. Each expert reviewed the materials independently and made changes to the table based on the materials provided. Veterinary epidemiologists were selected based knowledge of human, wildlife and livestock diseases. When there was a differences in the categorization of host susceptibility the most conservative classification was used. The majority of clinical and subclinical classifications originated from the three reference texts and changes resulting from the expert review were largely restricted to experimental hosts or species that are rarely have natural infections. This final table was then used to develop transmission potential networks for the eight host species.",

First, free-ranging wild pigs are relatively recent new comers to Canada and most contemporary non-English journals publish abstracts in English. In addition, most Canadian wild pig populations occur in English speaking regions of Canada so we expect any excluded studies to be minimal. Second, we did not identify any studies written in Spanish with an English abstracts for studies from Mexico indicating that studies written in Spanish without English abstracts that may have been excluded were likely limited.",
