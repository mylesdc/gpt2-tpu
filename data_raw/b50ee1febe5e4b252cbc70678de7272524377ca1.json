To control these diseases various studies have been developed in the field of mathematical modelling, which is useful tool for understanding the epidemiological dynamics and their dependence on social mixing patterns. Method. We have used Bayesian approach to quantify the disease outbreak through key epidemiological parameter basic reproduction number ( 0 ), using effective contacts, defined as sum of the product of incidence cases and probability of generation time distribution. We have estimated 0 from daily case incidence data for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 in India, for the initial phase. Result. The estimated 0 with 95% credible interval is consistent with several other studies on the same strain. Through sensitivity analysis our study indicates that infectiousness affects the estimate of 0 . Conclusion. Basic reproduction number 0 provides the useful information to the public health system to do some effort in controlling the disease by using mitigation strategies like vaccination, quarantine, and so forth.",

Influenza A (H1N1) was originally referred to as \"swine flu\" because laboratory testing showed that many of the genes in this new virus were very similar to those found in pigs in North America. Further on, it has been found that this new virus has gene segments from the swine, avian, and human flu virus genes. The scientists call this a \"quadruple reassortant\" virus and hence this new (novel) virus is christened \"influenza-A (H1N1) virus\" [1] .",

To access the intensity of an outbreak, transmission potential can be quantified by reproduction number 0 , that is, average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a completely susceptible population [6, 7] . The importance of basic reproduction number 0 becomes more apparent when an emerging infectious disease strikes a population which is a key concept in the epidemic theory. If 0 is less than or equal to one, then transmission in the population goes stochastically extinct with probability of one after a small number of infections. If 0 is greater than 1, then there is a positive probability of a large epidemic. Statistical estimation of 0 is used to understand the transmission dynamics and evolution of the infectious disease which facilitate designing the effective public health intervention strategies and mitigation policies [8] .",

Most of these 0 estimates ranges from 1.1 to 2 [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Our estimated value of the basic reproduction number indicates the milder intensity of disease transmission in India. Interestingly, this estimated 0 with 95% credible interval is consistent with several other studies on the same strain [35] , along with many European countries [28] . Notably, it has a smaller credible length which is more reliable estimate; see Table 1 . Statistical inference of 0 is based on incidence (reported cases) and known generation time distribution. Some differences among these estimates are due to the choice of generation time distribution because 0 estimation relies much on the assumptions of the generation time distribution [38] . In general, shorter mean generation time may lead to smaller 0 estimates. Since, the estimate of 0 crucially depends on generation time distribution. From Table 1 , we conclude that generation time or infectiousness of an individual affects the basic reproduction number. This method does not require exponential growth assumption. Still our estimate is greater than one so one has to make effort in controlling the disease through control strategies, which are typically targeted to bring this number below one and maintain it, as this will lead to eventual extinction of the epidemic.",
