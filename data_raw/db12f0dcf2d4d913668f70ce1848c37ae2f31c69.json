We found that the concentrations of IL-8, RANTES, MIG and IP-10 were significantly higher in HFMD children with encephalitis compared to patients with FC. Additionally, these four chemokines were dramatically reduced during convalescence. Inversely, the level of MCP-1 was lower in encephalitis patients than FC patients and was not significantly reduced during convalescence. Additionally, MIG was strongly correlated with IP-10 in encephalitis patients. Furthermore, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of CSF MIG and IP-10 in distinguishing encephalitis from FC were 0.869 and 0.876, and the corresponding sensitivities/specificities were 67.7%/100.0% and 67.7%/95.5%, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate that chemokines play important roles in the pathogenesis of EV71 infection.",

Although EV71 infection in most cases is self-limited, it can also induce severe neurological complications, such as aseptic meningitis (AM), encephalitis, brainstem encephalitis (BE), pulmonary edema (PE) and other rarer manifestations 1 . These neurological complications can sometimes lead to permanent neurologic sequelae and even death, and fatal PE or cardiorespiratory failure is thought be the main disease process in fatal cases 1 . It has also been postulated that dysregulation of inflammatory responses and cellular immunity are possibly responsible for this pathogenesis 2-4 . For instance, an in vitro study conducted by Lu et al. showed that EV71 inhibited the cellular type I IFN response by targeting a subunit of the IFN receptor, IFNAR1 2 . An animal study revealed that both the lymphocyte and antibody responses reduced the mortality and tissue viral loads of EV71-infected mice 3 . In a clinical study, it was shown that elevated cytokine production (including IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-\u03b3) and lymphocyte (including CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, natural killer cells) depletion were responsible for EV71 infection 4 . Unfortunately, to date, there is no effective vaccines or therapy available for EV71 infection. Therefore, developing a better understanding of the neuropathogenesis of EV71 infection is of the utmost importance in developing a more effective clinical therapy for treating HMFD patients.",

For example, the concentration of RANTES is higher in patients with a bacterial infection (including sepsis, community-acquired pneumonia, skin abscess) than controls with no infection, indicating that RANTES may be involved in the pathogenesis of bacteria 6 . In the same study, a unique pattern of immune response with high levels of IP-10 but low levels of MCP-1 were found in patients with sepsis 6 . IP-10, MIG and IL-8 were significantly elevated in the sputum of asthma patients compared to healthy controls 7 . Similarly, the plasma levels of IP-10, MCP-1, MIG and IL-8 were significantly higher in patients with PE than those with uncomplicated BE, indicating overexpression of the chemokine cascade, which appears to play an important role in the immune response to EV71 infection 8 . However, few studies have evaluated the levels of chemokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of HMFD children. Additionally, encephalitis is the common neurological complication of EV71 infection; little is known about the roles of chemokines in encephalitis, and the key mediators underlying this inflammatory response remain unclear. Moreover, despite the severe consequences, early recognition of HFMD patients with neurological complications is important for selecting optimal intensive care, which might prevent disease progression.",

Still, the effect of EV71 infection on the host's adaptive immunity, especially chemokines, is not well understood. In the present study, the chemokines IL-8, RANTES, MIG, MCP-1 and IP-10 were found to be significantly changed in the CSF of HFMD patients in the acute stage of EV71-related encephalitis (Fig. 1) . Our finding suggests that chemokines, which function in the selective recruitment of leukocyte populations, are involved in the pathology of the central nervous system (CNS) EV71 infection. The increased expression levels of IL-8, IP-10 and MIG are consistent with those of previous studies 8, 11 . In addition, we found chemokines that were correlated with each other (Fig. 5 ), in accordance with the result of string bioinformatics analysis 12 , which showed that these chemokines act in cooperation with each other rather than alone (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Likewise, a cytokine storm has been considered to be the main trigger of EV71-related cardiopulmonary collapse 13 . Taken together, this evidence implied that the dysregulation of the chemokine cascade in the CNS appears to be important regarding the elicitation of the inflammatory response to EV71 infection.",

MIG and IP-10 are Th1 cell attractants, while MCP-1 is Th2 chemokine and RANTES can recruit both Th1 and Th2 cells 5 . Previous studies have shown that HFMD is a Th1-driven disease 4,9 . In line with this finding, we also showed that Th1 chemotactic factors (including MIG, IP-10 and RANTES), rather than MCP-1, are potent chemoattractants of Th2 and are significantly elevated in the acute phase. Thus, we assumed that increased CSF MIG, IP-10 and RANTES in children with encephalitis may result in enhancement of Th1 lymphocyte recruitment into the CNS. Accordingly, decreased expression of the Th2 chemokine MCP-1 in encephalitis patients may contribute to a diminished antagonizing effect on Th1 cytokine production and hence intensify Th1 predominance. Interestingly, we revealed that MIG, IP-10 and RANTES were decreased in the recovery phase, while no significant differences were observed for MCP-1. Together, these data imply that Th1 chemoattractants predominate after EV71 infection and contribute to host defense by promoting a protective Th1 response.",

This could explain why MIG was strongly and positively correlated with IP-10, reflecting a temporal co-operation between CXCR3 ligands. An abundance of data demonstrated that MIG and IP-10 are induced in a diverse spectrum of neuroimmune diseases that influence the CNS 14 . Shen et al. observed that overexpression of IP-10 increased the MIG levels, reduced the viral burden in multiple tissues and increase the survival of mice after EV71 infection 15 . Consistently, IP-10 and MIG were significantly increased in the present study. Since chemokines are produced by CNS cells within hours of infection 5 , we suppose that the increased chemokine levels in patients with encephalitis may mediate early regulation and recruitment of protective immunity, reducing tissue damage. Likewise, it was reported that IP-10(\u2212/\u2212) mice infected with a neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus had reduced MIG levels that failed to control viral replication in the brain 16 . Kuang Y et al. showed that IP-10 enhanced the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and attenuation of rabies virus (RABV) 17 . This evidence suggests that early expression of IP-10 or MIG within the CNS after virus infection is important in initiating and maintaining a protective immune response. However, it has been implicated that herpes simplex virus (HSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can aggravate disease [18] [19] [20] . In detail, exaggerated activation of IP-10 and MIG have been proposed to be associated with adverse outcomes (intensive care unit admission or death) of SARS 18 . Increased secretion of IP-10 in the eye facilitates the spread of HSV to other restricted sites within the eye 20 . IP-10 regulates the severity of the LCMV-induced inflammatory process, resulting in fatal meningoencephalitis 19 . Collectively, these studies demonstrate that IP-10/MIG have subtle and perhaps divergent roles in different virus infection. Table 2 .

Similarly, a previous study showed that the CSF to plasma ratio for MIG tended to increase with the increasing severity of disease and that the CSF IP-10 levels in patients with EV71 BE were significantly higher than the plasma levels in control subjects 8 . Moreover, no established antiviral treatment is available for HFMD. Therefore, our results indicated that IP-10 and MIG might be novel biomarkers to diagnose encephalitis, which may guide patient treatment in clinical practice. Although, the significant difference of IP-10 and MIG had been determined in the CSF, the number of detected cases was not large enough to have power as a solo diagnostic biomarker for encephalitis. Moreover, we performed ROC analysis to analyze the diagnostic efficiency of the markers for encephalitis and showed that the sensitivities of CSF IP-10 and MIG were low (67.7% and 67.7%). However, the combination marker of the five chemokines had a significant elevation of the area under the ROC of 0.953, and its sensitivity in detecting encephalitis was 89.9%. Therefore, the combination of these five chemokines could be applied to clinical diagnosis of encephalitis, which may potentially serve to monitor disease progression, and guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.",

This could be explained by the difference in the immune response between the systemic and local inflammatory response. Interesting, although the MCP-1 levels decreased in convalescence, there was no statistically significant difference of the MCP-1 levels between the acute and recovery phases.

Diagnosis of HFMD was determined based on a popular or vesicular rash on the hands, feet, mouth or buttocks, which was usually accompanied with fever. Encephalitis was defined by the presence of an altered level of consciousness (including lethargy, drowsiness or coma, seizures or myoclonus) with CSF pleocytosis. In addition, patients with simple febrile convulsion (FC) were enrolled as controls. Diagnosis of FC was based on the criteria described previously 21 . In brief, simple FC was defined as generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurring in the first 48 hrs of a febrile illness and lasting for less than 15 min, but without any focal signs or recurring within 24 hrs, or no associated evidence of intracranial infection or a metabolic disorder 21 . Sampling and data collection. At enrolment, throat swabs and rectal swabs were collected from all participants. Meanwhile, a lumbar puncture was taken to obtain an acute phase CSF sample from each patient. All clinical samples from the HFMD patients mentioned above were taken at the same time and within 3 days from HFMD symptom onset. Unfortunately, recovery phase CSF samples were only obtained from 13 HFMD patients with encephalitis. All samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis. All of the clinical data of the participants were collected by reviewing electronic medical records from both hospitals, including age, gender, hematologicalparameters, CSF cytology and CSF biochemical markers.",
