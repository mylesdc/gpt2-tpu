Which factor is the dominant reason for seasonality of TB? Are these the only influencing factors in term of extrinsic infection or intrinsic reactivation of TB? To examine those issues, we studied the seasonality of TB in Wuhan, China.

The time series of total pulmonary TB cases was decomposed into trend component, seasonal and irregular noise component. A decomposition of monthly case counts was obtained for groups of interest, according to time period, sex, age, occupation, district, and sputum smear result. If the population had the identifiable seasonality judged by TRAMO-SEATS program, we calculated the mean spring peak month, mean summer peak month, mean trough month, annual spring seasonal amplitude and annual summer seasonal amplitude with 95% confidence interval (CI), and annual spring-summer amplitude difference with median, upper and lower quartile for the years from 2004 to 2013. Annual spring and summer seasonal amplitude were calculated from isolated seasonal factor and defined as the fraction with the numerator being the spring-peak-to-trough or summer-peak-to-trough difference between the months with the highest spring or summer and the lowest case counts and with the denominator being mean case counts for that year. Annual springsummer amplitude difference was defined as a fraction with the numerator being the spring-peak-to-summer-peak difference between the months with the highest spring and the highest summer case counts and with the denominator being mean case counts for that year.",

Figure 1 showed the original time series of pulmonary TB cases from 2004 January to 2013 December. Wuhan city is located in Hubei Province which is in the middle of China. Wuhan has a subtropical wet monsoon climate. Based on the temperature data and climatic seasonal division method, seasons in Wuhan were defined as spring (March-May), summer (June-September), autumn (October-November), and winter (December-February) [18] . There were a dominant spring peak (March) and a second summer peak (September), along with the trough (December). Table 2 illustrated spring seasonal amplitudes for subgroups of each group and the comparisons of spring seasonal amplitudes. An annual mean of 56.81% (95% CI, 41.93%-71.69%) more pulmonary TB cases were notified in the spring peak month (March) compared with the trough month (December) from 2004 to 2013. The spring seasonal amplitude in 2004-2008(73.17%) was higher than that of 2009-2013(40.45%), and the difference between them was significant (P,0.05). There were no statistical differences in spring seasonal amplitude between males and females, age groups, center and far district, smear positive and smear negative pulmonary TB (P.0.05). There were significant differences in spring seasonal amplitude by occupation, with amplitude ranging from 59.37% to 113.22% (P,0.05). The most common of spring peak month was March, the others were April and May. The trough month for all groups and subgroups was December. Table 3 summarized summer seasonal amplitudes for subgroups of each group and the comparisons of summer seasonal amplitudes. An annual mean of 43.40% (95% CI, 28.88%-57.92%) more pulmonary TB cases were notified in the summer peak month (September) compared with the trough month (December) from 2004 to 2013. The summer seasonal amplitude in 2004-2008(60.11%) was higher than that of 2009-2013(26.68%), and the difference between them was significant (P,0.05). There was no statistical difference in summer seasonal amplitude between males and females, center and far district, smear positive and smear negative pulmonary TB (P.0.05). There were significant differences in summer seasonal amplitude by age, with amplitude ranging from 36.05% to 100.09% (P,0.05). There were significant differences in summer seasonal amplitude by occupation, with amplitude ranging from 43.40% to 109.88% (P, 0.05). The most common of summer peak month was September, others were July and August. The trough month for all groups and subgroups was December. Table 4 displayed the median, the lower and upper quartile of spring and summer seasonal amplitude difference in Wuhan from 2004 to 2013. The median of 0-14 years old group and student were negative which showed that the summer seasonal amplitude was higher than the spring seasonal amplitude.",

First, poor ventilated room crowded with people could increase the chance of transmission among the infectious source and the contactors in winter. In Wuhan city, the winter is from December to February, and the coldest month is January in most of the years. In winter, people are more likely to stay at home and close the window because of the low temperature, moreover, because of the severe air pollution. Second, the crowding and poor ventilated public transport plays an important role in the transmission of pulmonary TB [21] [22] [23] . The most important holiday (Spring Festival, Chinese New Year) in China is always at the end of January or at the beginning of February. Transportation during the Spring Festival holiday, called ''chunyun'' in china, is very busy. During the period of about half month before or after the Spring Festival, there are thousands of people taking buses/coaches, airplanes or railways to travel between the hometown and the work town. The crowding degree of the above public transports is several times as the usual time. Furthermore, the travel time of people on these public transports is longer than usual, pulmonary TB has more chance to transmit over ''chunyun'' time period.",

The cold weather may be a possible cause leading to health care seeking delay in winter. Another important reason for health care seeking delay may be the Spring Festival at the end of winter. During the Spring Festival, congregation for celebrating the coming new year always leads to heath care seeking delay. Thus, the consultation rate during this period is relatively low. This delay in health care seeking contributes to diagnosis delay which may increase the risk of disease transmission (due to the longer communicable period of tuberculosis) in winter.",

Moreover, from the onset of symptoms to the diagnosis of TB, there is a time interval which is called diagnosis delay. The median diagnosis delay of pulmonary TB cases in Wuhan was 35 days in our previous study [29] . After the increase of TB transmission in winter, the peak of TB cases would appear 16.8 months (the sum of incubation and diagnosis delay) later. In other words, the summer peak (July-September) in this study was most likely resulted from the winter transmission. In our study, the 0-14 years old age group had the highest summer amplitude which paralleled with the spring amplitude. The summer amplitude of 0-14 years old age group was significant higher than older age groups. The younger persons must have had relatively recent TB infection in winter compared with the elderly who may have been infected many years earlier. This suggested a possible organic basis for the above speculation.",

            "text": "The reactivation of TB means that the relatively longer time between the acquisition of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the onset of the symptoms comparing with the winter transmission. The reactivation of tuberculosis is associated with HIV infection, immunosuppressive therapy or complex factors such as poor nutrition and socioeconomic status which can lead to decreased immunity. First, vitamin D deficiency has been hypothesized to be contributed to the reactivation of TB [30] . Prior to the introduction of chemotherapy, the measures (sunlight exposure and fish liver oils supplement) to enhance the level of serum 25hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) were included as an integral part of traditional anti-TB therapy. Studies [31, 32] showed that vitamin D deficiency could impair cell mediated immunity and reduce function of macrophages, thus lead to the reactivation of tuberculosis. Synthesis of vitamin D is dependent on the sunlight. Latitude is considered as an important influencing factor of sunlight exposure. The consensus reached in nutrition is that, the serum 25 (OH) D concentration is quite low or absent above latitude of 33u N in winter [33] . Although there has been no data of the seasonal variation of serum 25 (OH) D concentrations of residents in Wuhan which is located at 30u N, we suppose that the serum 25 (OH) D concentrations are relatively low in winter of Wuhan residents. The result of one study showed that the serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D revealed about one month lag after the change of ultraviolet radiation [34] , another study showed that the trough of 25-hydroxy vitamin D was in mid-winter [35] . Thus, the trough month of the serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D in Wuhan residents is assumed to be in February, one month behind the trough of ultraviolet radiation (January). This would result in the reactivation peak in late winter, considering the diagnosis delay (35 days, about 1.2 month), then would lead to the spring peak (March) of pulmonary TB.",

Several studies showed that after a time of exposure to diesel exhaust inhalation, the expression levels of interleukin (TNF)-a, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-c in marine decreased significantly [36, 37] . IFN-c attacks and kills the Mycobacterium tuberculosis by macrophage activation. TNF-a is important in the procedure of granuloma formation and the infection localized. Furthermore, the inhibition of TNF-a by drugs would lead to TB reactivation [38] . A recent study suggested a potential association between the exposure to particulate matter (PM) and pulmonary TB [39] . Additionally, the frequent haze weather may lead to reduced ultraviolet radiation intensity, thus lower the level of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D in body. The haze weather is most frequently in winter. Consequently, all of the above factors would cause the winter or early spring peak of TB reactivation. Considering the diagnosis delay of TB, TB reactivation would manifest as TB peak in spring. Thus, we speculated that spring peak (from March to May) in our study was more likely caused by the reactivation of the latent TB than the enhanced winter transmission.",

Ane-Anyangwe's study [13] in the South Western Cameroon showed that the peak month was in winter (rainy season). The author attributed it to the two factors: vitamin D deficiency due to the lack of sunlight exposure, higher risks of indoor infection because of the humid and cold weather. The rainy season in Wuhan is very short, last about 20-30 days every year, usually from mid June to early July in summer. The precipitation does not have significant seasonality beyond the rainy season. The ultraviolet radiation is enough for the synthesis of serum 25(OH) D even during the rainfall season period. In rainy season, the temperature is high and the continuous heavy rain is infrequent(the annual mean frequency of continuous heavy rain was 0.41 times between 1959-1996, 95% lasted less than 5 days) [40] , thus it is not likely to enhance the indoor infection. There was no significant difference between the males and females in the spring and summer seasonal amplitude. This observation was similar to many of the studies on the seasonality of TB over the world [10, 41] . Even through the summer seasonal amplitude of smear positive was higher than that of smear negative pulmonary TB, which was similar to Luo's [12] and Leung's [10] study, but the difference between them was not significant.",

Second, all of the explanation of the seasonality was just the speculation, and the conclusions were not definite. Since the study is observational, the temporal association between cause and effect could not be established. There was a need of further study to explore the exact mechanism of the seasonal variation of pulmonary TB in Wuhan. The further research should be focused on the relationship between PM2.5 and serum 25 (OH) D concentration, PM2.5 and pulmonary TB, and so on.
