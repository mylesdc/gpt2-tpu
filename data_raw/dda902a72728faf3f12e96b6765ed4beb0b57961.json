We thus investigated whether and how virus affects migration of human epithelial cells and specifically how the nucleocapsid protein (N) modulates the cellular proteome and interactome using human Caco-2 cells in a wound-healing assay with Hazara virus as a model. Here, Hazara virus blocked cell migration in a dose-and time-dependent manner, disrupted the actin cytoskeleton and specifically reduced the expression of the IQ-motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) and water channel aquaporin 6 (AQP6) that regulate cytoskeletal organization, water homeostasis and vesicle communication. Moreover, in the Caco-2 cell proteome, we identified several distinct groups of molecules associating with N upon Hazara virus infection, being involved in the ensemble of important cellular processes, e.g., chaperone activity, metabolism, cellular defense against infections, cell morphology, and migration. These events do not only facilitate the virus life cycle, but they are also crucial for membrane and cytoskeleton dynamics, cellular self-renewal and wound healing, being so essential for body integrity and homeostasis.",

They are located both on the outside, e.g., in the skin surface, and on the inside, e.g., along the gastrointestinal tract (Ivanov et al., 2010) . The linings of blood and lymphatic vessels of circulatory system are accordingly covered by a specialized form of epithelium, the endothelium (Rodrigues and Granger, 2015) . These barriers display both physical and immune characteristics, where the former are potentiated by epithelial cell-to-cell junctions that prevent passage of pathogens and large molecules, and the latter are maintained via detection of antigens and recruitment for instance of phagocytes to the site of infection, potentially resulting in inflammation and tissue damage (Figure 1 ; Condeelis and Pollard, 2006; Ivanov et al., 2010; Rodrigues and Granger, 2015) . The epithelial cell barrier consists of a monolayer of cells that are constantly moving and renewed normally every 72 h in the gut. This is controlled by a highly sophisticated interplay between the cytoskeleton, intercellular junctions, extracellular matrix, FIGURE 1 | Epithelial barrier functions at the front line of viral infections. Epithelial and endothelial cell monolayers (in pink) provide a series of host barriers to pathogens and other environmental agents. These possess both physical and immune (in lilac) properties. Epithelium constantly moving, renewing, and normally undergoes a wound-healing process which is controlled by an interplay between matrix, water homeostasis (in yellow), and cytoskeleton and junctions-associated proteins (ex. IQGAP1 in green). Viruses of the Nairovirus genus (red asterisk) can overcome the first host barrier to enter the body and access underlying cells. Viruses enter host cells by endocytosis, replicates, and assembles in the perinuclear regions of the cytoplasm and leaves the epithelial cell monolayers from the basolateral side (in blue), and further utilize microtubule (light green) and actin (red), the components of host cytoskeleton during the whole life cycle.",

Extensive remodeling of the cytoskeleton is regulated by the Rho family of small GTPases (Zegers and Friedl, 2014) , where the IQ-motif-containing GTPase-activating proteins IQGAP scaffolds a plethora molecules to control diverse cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, cell proliferation and vesicle trafficking (Karlsson et al., 2012; Hedman et al., 2015) . We have thus provided an evidence that water fluxes through aquaporins (AQP) play a pivotal role in cell migration (Loitto et al., 2009; Karlsson et al., 2013) , besides selectively facilitating the transport of water and small uncharged solutes like glycerol both over the cell membrane (Verkman, 2005; Benga, 2012) and intracellular membranes (Molinas et al., 2016) . By such interplay with the cytoskeleton and signaling cascades, the AQP do assist directly and indirectly distinct processes, such as cell volume, signal transduction, metabolism, cell migration, and organelle physiology (Saadoun et al., 2005; Verkman, 2005; Loitto et al., 2009; Karlsson et al., 2013; Holm et al., 2016; Molinas et al., 2016) .",

It is an enveloped virus, with three negative-stranded RNA, designated as small, medium and large, which encode the nucleocapsid protein (N), surface glycoproteins, and a RNA-dependent polymerase, respectively (Morikawa et al., 2007) . The N is a multifunctional structural protein that plays a key role in the biology of RNA viruses, as it binds to the viral RNA genome and forms a ribonucleoprotein in mature virions. It also interacts with host cell proteins to facilitate the virus life cycle (Wulan et al., 2015) , and localizes in the perinuclear region (Andersson et al., 2004) and in the nuclei of infected cells (Cohen et al., 2011) . Since N is present in high amounts early during infection, it is useful for clinical diagnosis (Dowall et al., 2012b) .",

Hazara virus and CCHFV exhibit about 70 and 86% nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity, respectively (Honig et al., 2004) , correlating well with virus serology and pathogenicity. Hazara virus has thus been used as a valid alternative experimental model for a CCHFV infection (Ergonul, 2006; Dowall et al., 2012a) , enabling the investigation of Nairovirus and the development of antivirals without having access to a biosafety level 4 laboratory.",

The samples were further diluted in Laemmli sample buffer at equal protein concentrations, heated for 5 min at 95 \u2022 C and then subjected to electrophoresis. They were loaded on 8-16% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Lonza, Rockland, ME), and after separation, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF Immobilon-FL membrane (Millipore); the quality of the transfer was controlled by Ponceau S staining (Sigma Aldrich). Non-specific binding was blocked by 1-h incubation in 5% non-fat milk in PBS, pH 7.6 containing 0.18% Tween 20 at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with antibodies against CCHFV/Hazara N (Andersson et al., 2004) , IQGAP1, AQP6, and GAPDH (05-504, AB3073, MAB374 FIGURE 2 | Schematic layout of wound healing assays. Caco-2 cells were cultured in \u00b5-dishes with Ibidi inserts until monolayers were confluent. Cells were then either untreated (Control) or infected with Hazara virus at different MOI for 1 h. After 1-h infection, the cells were rinsed and maintained for 0, 24, or 48 hpi as shown in (A-C) respectively. To create a wound, the inserts were removed at 0, 24, or 48 hpi, and the cells were thereafter allowed to migrate. To monitor the wound healing, the images of cells migrating into the gap area of the wound were taken at indicated time using the benchtop microscope.",

Therefore, we investigated whether an infection with Hazara virus affected epithelial cell migration, using Ibidi wound-healing chambers (Figure 2) . The mature differentiated and polarized epithelial monolayers were infected with Hazara virus at two multiplicities of infection (MOI), 0.02 and 2.0 for 1 h, and wounds were then created at 0, i.e., immediately, or at 24 and 48 h post infection (hpi), allowing the cells to migrate and heal the wound for up to 52 h (Figures 2, 3) . For the 0-hpi wound, we observed that the migration rates of virus-infected cells were similar to the control, i.e., untreated cells ( Figure 3A) . For the wounds created at 24 hpi, the rates of healing for cells infected with Hazara virus at MOI 2.0 were significantly suppressed at 30-52 h. By contrast, the MOI 0.02 resulted in significantly promoted migration between 24 and 30 h after creation of wounds, as compared to the untreated control ( Figure 3B ). When the wounds were created at 48 hpi, the migration rates of cells infected with Hazara virus at both MOI 0.02 and 2.0 and 0.02 were significantly inhibited around 24-28 h ( Figure 3C) ; the control non-infected wounds were closed at that time and for this reason the study was not continued longer. In this set of experiments, no signs of Caco-2 cell death or apoptosis were seen.",

The distribution of these proteins in juxta-membrane regions went from a distinct uniform to a more disorganized and diffuse pattern; AQP6 re-localized to the cytoplasm; IQGAP1 formed cytoplasmic aggregates; and this was observed in more or less all cells in different fields of views.

To do so, epithelial monolayers were kept non-infected, or infected with Hazara virus at MOI 1 for 1 h, and at 24 hpi, total cell lysate samples were obtained and further immunoprecipitated using the antibodies against CCHFV/Hazara N. The N-enriched immune complexes, as well as total cell lysate samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (Figure 6) . For the latter, no significant difference in protein patterns of infected and non-infected cells was observed (Figure 6 , right panel). For the samples with N-enriched immune complexes, one additional protein band was reproducibly seen in the sample corresponding cells infected with Hazara virus (Figure 6 , left panel).",

The lower unit with white nodes represent 12 proteins displayed decreased binding to N-enriched immune complexes upon viral infection in comparison to non-infected control ( Table 1) . Edges represent protein-protein interactions where line thickness indicates the strength of data support.

This may allow virus to maintain long-term infections in the host and perturb the repair of epithelia by interfering with cytoskeletal structure and water homeostasis. Our findings corroborate several reports on how microbial pathogens may manipulate signaling pathways of the host cells, particularly cytoskeletal dynamics, to help them invade, replicate and maintain infections (Chazal and Gerlier, 2003; Sewald et al., 2016) . Thus, IQGAP1 regulates egress of Ebola virus (Lu et al., 2013) , invasion and replication of Moloney leukemia virus (Leung et al., 2006) and virulence of swine fever virus (Gladue et al., 2011) . Moreover, CCHFV did perturb strongly the microtubule and actin filaments during entry, growth and release to the surroundings (Andersson et al., 2004; Simon et al., 2009) . Additionally, other studies have proposed a new role for AQP as important proteins during viral infections and inflammation. Thus, the levels of AQP1 and 5 were low during pulmonary, adenoviral infection (Towne et al., 2000) . AQP4 was decreased in the acute phase of a Herpes simplex virus infection, but increased in the long-term of disease (Martinez Torres et al., 2007) . An infection of human cells with CCHFV strain IbAR 10200 downregulated the AQP6 mRNA expression (Molinas et al., 2016) . Furthermore, with Hazara virus as a model, we have recently provided an evidence for a protective role of AQP6 against virus infection (Molinas et al., 2016) .",

Coxsackie virus disseminates within host EMV upon stem cell migration and differentiation and thereby spreads to new cells (Robinson et al., 2014) . Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTS), which is a new Bunyaviridae family member, incorporates itself into EMV and use them as a delivery system for its own spreading (Silvas et al., 2016) . We suggest that Hazara virus may also take the advantage of host EMV to promote spreading through cell-tocell contacts and thereby the establishment and progression of infection.",

Moreover, upon infection, Hazara virus structural N is engaged with an array of cellular protein interactions (Figure 8 ). Our interactome data provide a foundation for future work on mechanistic insights into biology of an infection. Taken together, these events interfere with many cellular processes that potentially facilitate the virus life cycle, but they are also deleterious to cell renewal and wound healing at epithelial and endothelial linings being so essential to organism homeostasis under normal physiological situation and after bacterial or virus injury and infection.
