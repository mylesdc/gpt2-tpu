            "text": "Motivation: To understand protein structure, folding and function fully and to design proteins de novo reliably, we must learn from natural protein structures that have been characterized experimentally. The number of protein structures available is large and growing exponentially, which makes this task challenging. Indeed, computational resources are becoming increasingly important for classifying and analyzing this resource. Here, we use tools from graph theory to define an Atlas classification scheme for automatically categorizing certain protein substructures. Results: Focusing on the a-helical coiled coils, which are ubiquitous protein-structure and proteinprotein interaction motifs, we present a suite of computational resources designed for analyzing these assemblies. iSOCKET enables interactive analysis of side-chain packing within proteins to identify coiled coils automatically and with considerable user control. Applying a graph theory-based Atlas classification scheme to structures identified by iSOCKET gives the Atlas of Coiled Coils, a fully automated, updated overview of extant coiled coils. The utility of this approach is illustrated with the first formal classification of an emerging subclass of coiled coils called a-helical barrels. Furthermore, in the Atlas, the known coiled-coil universe is presented alongside a partial enumeration of the 'dark matter' of coiled-coil structures; i.e. those coiled-coil architectures that are theoretically possible but have not been observed to date, and thus present defined targets for protein design. Availability and implementation: iSOCKET is available as part of the open-source GitHub repository associated with this work (https://github.com/woolfson-group/isocket). This repository also contains all the data generated when classifying the protein graphs. The Atlas of Coiled Coils is available at:",

Such classifications demonstrate the structural diversity exhibited by proteins in nature; develop our understanding of proteins; and facilitate comparisons between structures. Further, protein-structure classifications provide inspiration for protein designers to identify the structures that are not yet present in these schemes and then construct them de novo (Kuhlman et al., 2003; Michalopoulos et al., 2004; Thomson et al., 2014; Zaccai et al., 2011) .

We sought a classification scheme for existing structures and the dark matter, as well as means that could delineate them. The system we have designed is fully automated, and its basis in mathematical graph theory is general enough that it can be readily applied to a diverse set of protein motifs.",

To address this, we used an alternative method for classification, which emulates the Periodic Table in structure (Moutevelis and Woolfson, 2009 ).

A knob is a side chain projecting from one helix that packs into the hole formed by four side chains on an adjacent helix. Extended regions of KIH packing cement the core of a coiled coil, locking hydrophobic faces of amphipathic helices together away from solvent. The program SOCKET (Walshaw and Woolfson, 2001) finds KIH interactions within protein structures and, therefore, can identify coiled coils automatically. Application of SOCKET to the PDB has delivered the CC\u00fe database (http://coiled coils.chm.bris.ac.uk/ccplus/search/) (Testa et al., 2009) , from which the Periodic Table of Coiled Coils (PTCC) (Moutevelis and Woolfson, 2009 ) has been manually curated. However, the number of structures in the PDB has more than doubled since the PTCC was introduced and an update is overdue. Furthermore, and importantly for protein design, the 'dark matter' of coiled coils is not explicitly defined in the PTCC, making it difficult to identify the next design challenges. For example, there are clear gaps in the first row of the PTCC beyond the classical and abundant coiled-coil dimers, trimers and tetramers; though these gaps are being filled to some extent through the de novo design of so-called a-helical barrels, which have 5 or more a helices arranged about a central super-helical axis (Thomson et al., 2014; Woolfson et al., 2012; Zaccai et al., 2011) .",

The objects form the nodes of the graphs (which for coiled coils are the a helices), and the interactions between them form its edges (the KIH contacts). Graph theory is the robust mathematical framework built from this generic definition, and its applications emerge in diverse fields including operational research, genetics, linguistics, geography, sociology, architecture and many others (Wilson, 2010) . In terms of applications to protein science, graph theory has been used in the form of Protein Structure Networks (Bhattacharyya et al., 2016) , for studying the rigidity of proteins (Sim et al., 2015) , probing the evolutionary constraints on amino-acid mutation (Parente et al., 2015) , comparing spatial arrangements of secondary structure elements (Grindley et al., 1993) , and representing pathways of protein-protein interactions (Huang et al., 2014) . Here, we apply tools from graph theory to address the problem of automatically classifying existing coiled-coil protein structures and partially enumerating the 'dark matter' of that protein structural space. We make particular use of the catalogue of graphs presented in the book 'An Atlas of Graphs' (Read and Wilson, 1998) , and therefore refer to our system as the Atlas Classification. This is an updated catalogue of natural structures combined with an enumeration of some of the 'dark matter'.",

Briefly, this proceeds as follows: Given a protein structure, the a helices are extracted and the centroid of the side-chain is stored for each residue. The helices are then considered in a pairwise manner. For each residue on the first helix, the four closest side-chain centres from the residues on the second helix are determined. If each of these four distances is less than a user-specified cutoff distance (the SOCKET cutoff, scut), then this is recorded as a KIH interaction with the residue on the first helix as the knob residue, and the four residues on the second helix forming the associated hole residues. The value of scut defines how tightly the knob must pack in the hole: reducing scut decreases or maintains the number of KIH interactions that are detected.",

However, iSOCKET confers several advantages over the foregoing program. The original program required a user-defined distance cutoff for assigning KIH (default 7.0 \u00c5 ), which were assigned in a binary fashion. The updated program collects all KIH at a deliberately large distance cut-off value (10 \u00c5 ), and allows the user to select any threshold below this. This allows for a more-generous assignment of KIH interactions. Additionally, arbitrarily large structures can be analyzed, including complex coiled coils and larger structures containing multiple coiled coils, with both mmCIF and PDB files formats being handled. iSOCKET also enables analysis of the protein structural environment that surrounds each individual KIH interaction, thus making it a powerful tool for analyzing coiled-coil packing in detail. Within iSOCKET, convenience methods have been added for analyzing the packing geometry of individual KIH interactions in detail. Properties defined in detail elsewhere Walshaw and Woolfson, 2001, 2003) , such as the knob-type, the depth of side-chain interdigitation, the corepacking angle, and the complementarity of the KIH interactions may all be calculated easily for both parallel and antiparallel coiled coils. Furthermore, the object-oriented basis of iSOCKET facilitates interpretation of KIH interaction networks, by representing these as a mathematical graph.",

To facilitate this, the a helices of the coiled coil form the nodes of the graph, and these are joined by edges that represent the KIH interactions. Since there may be many KIH interactions between a given pair of helices, there may be many edges joining two nodes on the graph. Each edge has a direction, starting from the helix that provides the knob residue and ending at that which provides the hole residues. Each node in the graph must have at least one edge associated with it, but the entire graph need not be connected. Indeed, where there are multiple separate coiled coils within the same protein structure these form the 'connected components' of the protein graph.

This is converted to a simple graph and each of its connected components is classified separately (i.e. as individual coiled coils) via isomorphism to the Atlas of Graphs. With reference to Figure 2A , the graphs associated with a coiled-coil dimer, a hexameric barrel and the complex coiled coil in Figure 1 are 'G3', 'G105' and 'G163', respectively. A structure containing a separate dimer and trimer has two connected components: 'G3' and 'G7'. Provided that the coiled coil contains 7 helices, its representative graph will be determined rapidly. For larger, complex coiled coils, we must confront the combinatorial explosion that prevents the Atlas of Graphs remaining exhaustive for larger graphs. Pragmatically, we introduce larger graphs as they are encountered: a graph that does not fit into the set of existing categories defines its own category and thus the Atlas of Graphs is expanded. Specifically, the graph corresponding to the first coiled coil to be encountered that contains > 7 helices is added and named as the previously unseen graph 'U1'. The second such coiled coil is then either isomorphic to the first (and so belongs to the 'U1' category), or initiates another new category 'U2'. All known coiled-coil structures can be categorized in this way. iSOCKET is used to identify graphs of KIH interactions within the protein structure and compare these, via isomorphism, to the graphs of the Atlas of Graphs. If no isomorph is found, the Atlas of Graphs is extended, and the new graph is added to the Atlas table in the database (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)",

There are no examples of hexameric barrels in the original PTCC: this highlights both the increase in structural data available, and the recent successes in designing a-helical barrel structures (Huang et al., 2014; Thomson et al., 2014; Zaccai et al., 2011) . Expanding on this, Figure 4A includes 4 examples of heptameric barrels, adding to the 'slipped heptamer' seven-helix coiled-coil in the PTCC (Liu et al., 2006) .",

Second, the Atlas classification was generated entirely automatically, and it is possible that the manual validation used to construct the PTCC would rule out some of the less densely populated categories as true coiled coils. Conversely, humans may be less adept at unambiguously identifying complex coiled coils, for example classifying only the central trimer over the surrounding entire assembly in the case of the six-helix bundles represented by G163.",

This was to be expected: as more KIH interactions were identified there was an increased likelihood of peripheral helices being included in morecomplex coiled coils. Whilst the absolute number of dimers represented in Figure 4C (1831) was greater than in Figure 4A (1759) , the proportion was reduced in the former to just 27%. At this highly permissive cutoff combination, loose packing between proximal helices is included and the resulting graphs may not represent tightly packed coiled coils. As the graphs get larger, the chances of two similar structures being placed into distinct categories increases, and so the specificity of the classification diminishes. As a counterpoint to this, there is greater sensitivity as many of the categories were more-densely populated. For example, there were 38 structures represented by G163. Manual inspection revealed these to be viral insertion proteins; this unsupervised classification scheme has grouped together structures of similar function, outside of its initial remit of coiled-coil classification. Strictly maintaining more-restrictive cutoffs would not group these structures in this way.",

To capture all the structures in the PTCC that correspond to small simple graphs for instance, scut must be varied between 7.0 and 7.5 \u00c5 , and kcut between 2 and 3. The graphical representation of an individual coiled coil may be sensitive to parameter values, as demonstrated in Figure 4D for a structure of hemagglutinin (PDB code: 4bsa) (Xiong et al., 2013) . Fixing kcut \u00bc 2 and setting scut \u00bc 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0 \u00c5 resulted in three different graphs. At low scut, only the central trimer was detected, but as it was increased, interactions were also found between the helices of the trimer and three outer helices. This pattern was common for the set of structures that were G163 for at least one of the 20 parameter combinations. The antiparallel six-helix bundle represented by G163 is a unifying feature of class 1 viral fusion proteins; these facilitate membrane fusion and therefore viral entry into host cells (Bosch et al., 2003; Harrison, 2015; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Markosyan et al., 2009) . Central to this function is the large-scale conformational changes that switch the structure between an extended trimer and six-helix bundles. In this case, our structural classification scheme automatically grouped structures together that share a clear structure-function relationship.",

All cycles from 3-7 are captured in the Atlas of Graphs and there are corresponding coiled-coil structures for each of these (Fig. 4A ). Larger cycles are not part of the Atlas of Graphs and so barrels with more than 7 helices are not represented.

Importantly, considering the exponential growth in protein structures deposited to the PDB, the classification is automatically generated and so is readily updateable. Visualization of the Atlas gives a simple overview of the classification (Fig. 4) , depicting each category of coiled coil as a simple graph. Interactive tools allow straightforward adjustments of well-defined structural parameters used to identify the coiled coils. Relaxing these parameters identifies larger, more-complex structural forms: showing the continuum between tightly packed coiled coils and looser arrangements of helices. These changes may be relevant for protein structure, stability and function (Hulko et al., 2006; Lupas and Bassler, 2017; Swain et al., 2009) . When classifying large, complex arrangements of helices, subtle differences between structures may result in them having different graphs and being categorized separately. By grouping large graphs that share properties such as having the same number of edges or containing a common subgraph, or using more than two structural parameters to filter further, useful automated meta classification layers could be implemented to tailor the classification.",

Furthermore, extant coiled coils are shown in the context of all possible coiled-coil structures; i.e. alongside the 'dark matter' of coiledcoil space (Taylor et al., 2009; Woolfson et al., 2015) . In this way, we see the small extent to which natural coiled coils, and the currently small number of designed structures, have sampled the available structural space. By contrast, in the PTCC dark-matter structures can only be inferred by their absence. Other than for simple cyclically symmetric structures (in effect, the top row of the PTCC) this is difficult using the PTCC, and entirely impractical to do systematically. Focusing on the expanded set of these cyclic graphs for example yields the first formal classification of a-helical barrels (Fig. 5) , further demonstrating the utility of the automated scheme. This Atlas of a-helical barrels presents a clear set of targets for protein designers (Huang et al., 2014; Thomson et al., 2014; Woolfson et al., 2015; Zaccai et al., 2011) . This is not restricted to soluble proteins: one of the octameric regions identified is from Wza (2j58) (Dong et al., 2006) , that we recently used to guide the design of a membrane-spanning a-helical peptide barrel (Mahendran et al., 2017) . Classifying membrane proteins using our scheme yields an Atlas of transmembane helix packing (Niitsu et al., 2017) . These are challenging but potentially useful targets for design in bionanotechnology and synthetic biology (Joh et al., 2014) .",

Indeed, the nodes need not be secondary structure elements at all: they could be domains, or chains within a larger protein complex. To classify another protein architecture (or indeed, anything else) it is only this first step-explicitly defining the nodes and edges and therefore the conversion into graphs-that needs to be re-implemented. Since the Atlas Classification scheme is not exhaustive for graphs with >7 nodes, it is most useful where this limit is not frequently exceeded.
