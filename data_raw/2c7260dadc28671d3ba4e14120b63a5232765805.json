            "text": "Background: Major intercontinental outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease associated with the Hajj occurred in 1987, 2000, and 2001. Mandatory meningococcal vaccination for all pilgrims against serogroups A and C and, subsequently, A, C, W, and Y controlled the epidemics. Overseas pilgrims show excellent adherence to the policy; however, vaccine uptake among domestic pilgrims is suboptimal. This survey aimed to evaluate meningococcal vaccine uptake among Hajj pilgrims and to identify key factors affecting this. Methods: An anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted among pilgrims in Greater Makkah during the Hajj in 2017-2018. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, vaccination status, cost of vaccination, and reasons behind non-receipt of the vaccine were collected. Results: A total of 509 respondents aged 13 to 82 (median 33.8) years participated in the survey: 86% male, 85% domestic pilgrims. Only 389/476 (81.7%) confirmed their meningococcal vaccination status; 64 individuals (13.4%), all domestic pilgrims, did not receive the vaccine, and 23 (4.8%) were unsure. Among overseas pilgrims, 93.5% certainly received the vaccine (6.5% were unsure) compared to 80.9% of domestic pilgrims (p < 0.01). Being employed and having a tertiary qualification were significant predictors of vaccination adherence (odds ratio (OR) = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.3-3.8, p < 0.01; and OR = 1.7, CI = 1-2.5, p < 0.05, respectively). Those who obtained pre-Hajj health advice were more than three times as likely to be vaccinated than those who did not (OR = 3.3, CI = 1.9-5.9, p < 0.001). Lack of awareness (63.2%, 36/57) and lack of time (15.8%, 9/57) were the most common reasons reported for non-receipt of vaccine. Conclusion: Many domestic pilgrims missed the compulsory meningococcal vaccine; in this regard, lack of awareness is a key barrier. Being an overseas pilgrim (or living at a distance from Makkah), receipt of pre-Hajj health advice, and employment were predictors of greater compliance with the vaccination policy. Opportunities remain to reduce the policy-practice gap among domestic pilgrims.

Furthermore, in 2000 to 2001, a large outbreak of meningococcal disease resulted in at least 47 deaths, including 11 deaths in the United Kingdom, and affected no fewer than 2400 people in several countries throughout Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America.

Switching the vaccination policy to the quadrivalent (serogroups A, C, W, and Y) meningococcal (MenACWY) polysaccharide vaccine in 2002, coupled with chemoprophylaxis at the port of entry for pilgrims arriving from the African meningitis belt, again brought the subsequent epidemics under control [8] . Since then, no further Hajj-related meningococcal outbreaks occurred [6] . The mandatory vaccination policy also applies to residents of Hajj zones and to personnel who serve pilgrims during the Hajj, including healthcare workers (HCWs) ( Table 1) [1, 9] . Monitoring the annual number of Hajj visas and mandating the vaccine as a prerequisite for the visa application both limited the numbers of overseas pilgrims and improved vaccination rates. For instance, reports on vaccine uptake among overseas pilgrims since 2006 showed a compliance of no less than 96% and reaching up to 100% [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ; however, concerns remain among this group of pilgrims, including the receipt of inappropriate vaccines and, due to the limited access to vaccines (including cost), the use of fraudulent vaccination certificates [11, 15, 16] .",

Despite this, unauthorized domestic pilgrims often sometimes enter Hajj sites without a permit and without formally registering with an official Hajj tour group. Additionally, despite being enforced and freely offered, the vaccine coverage was found to be very low (64%) in 2006 in the only published work reporting vaccine uptake among domestic pilgrims [12] . The rate was also unsatisfactory among domestic HCWs (ranging from 51.7% to 84.7%) in several studies conducted between 2009 and 2018 [17] [18] [19] [20] . In recent years, the enforcement of the Hajj permit requirement by rigorous procedures at points of entry into Makkah reduced the number and proportion of domestic pilgrims (from 1.4 million (45%) in 2012 to 600,000 (26%) in 2018) [21] . However, there is no recent study assessing the uptake of meningococcal vaccines among these pilgrims. To this end, a survey was undertaken to evaluate the coverage of MenACWY vaccines among Hajj pilgrims and to identify the key predictors and barriers affecting their uptake, particularly among domestic pilgrims, which was not assessed in previous studies.",

Thus, 20.5% (70/341) of domestic pilgrims failed to confirm their adherence to the complete vaccination policy (either did not receive the vaccine at all, received it over three years prior, or were unsure about their vaccination status). This translates to an almost seven-fold increased risk of non-compliance with the vaccine policy compared to overseas pilgrims (OR = 6.8, 95% CI = 1.6-28.8), p < 0.01). Lack of awareness that the vaccine is a mandatory requirement (63.2%, 36/57) was the main reason given for not receiving the vaccine (Figure 1 ). ",

The majority of overseas pilgrims received \"professional\" pre-Hajj health advice, while locals tended to rely on \"social\" sources. However, receiving any pre-travel health advice, being employed, and having a tertiary qualification were each individually associated with greater compliance with the vaccination policy. Previous reports on uptake of other recommended vaccines at Hajj also indicated that receiving pre-travel health advice was a considerable motivator for receiving vaccinations against other diseases [14, 23] . Furthermore, in a large survey among residents of Gulf Cooperation Council countries, doctors' advice was the leading motivator for receipt of influenza vaccine [24] . Worksite immunization was shown to be effective in facilitating influenza vaccine uptake in Saudi Arabia [25] . Similarly, some employed participants of this survey indicated receiving the meningococcal vaccine at or through their workplace. This may explain the higher vaccine uptake among employed participants compared with those who identified themselves as unemployed. Additionally, more educated pilgrims were more likely to receive the meningococcal vaccine than those with lower educational attainment. A cross-sectional study of Australian Hajj pilgrims also demonstrated that having a university education was associated with a higher likelihood of receiving recommended Hajj vaccines (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.7-6.7, p = 0.01) [14] . Previous reports also described a higher rate of vaccine uptake in women preparing to be pilgrims [20, 26, 27] . The association observed in this survey was in the same direction, but the difference with men was not statistically significant, which may be due to the low proportion of women who participated in the survey.",

Lack of awareness was also the main reason reported by Australian pilgrims in 2014 for not receiving Hajj recommended vaccines [14] . Lack of time was also found to be a barrier to vaccination among emergency room HCWs in Madina [19] and was shown to be a more significant barrier to influenza vaccination among domestic male pilgrims compared to female pilgrims [22] .",

Conjugate vaccines are more effective in controlling the carriage of meningococci [29, 30] but are considerably more expensive. Meningococcal serogroups that are not covered by the current quadrivalent vaccine were frequently isolated from throat swabs collected from pilgrims, namely, serogroups B and, less frequently, X [31] [32] [33] . A recent systematic review concluded that serogroup B dominated the carriage acquisition among Hajj pilgrims [32] , and most carriers received the polysaccharide vaccine, which is not expected to reduce the carriage acquisition of serogroups contained in the vaccine [34, 35] . The opportunity to prevent future outbreaks depends on an ongoing review of the current mandatory vaccination policy in view of these and future developments.",

However, since pilgrims are often too busy to complete forms, the small sample size and the submission of incomplete responses are key limitations of this survey. Additionally, the small number of unvaccinated participants limits the ability to draw reliable conclusions regarding the true role of specific barriers. Furthermore, the data are self-reported, and we had no way of validating vaccination histories; moreover, the questionnaire did not differentiate between conjugate and polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines. Finally, we considered all those who stated previous receipt of the vaccine as vaccinated; however, since some respondents did not state the year of vaccination, the true uptake rates may be lower than reported here. The inability to include \"unauthorized\" domestic pilgrims also adds to the potential overestimation of the true vaccine uptake rate among domestic pilgrims.",

Overseas pilgrims appear to have good uptake of the vaccine, as expected from the mandatory vaccination for visa policy. Receipt of pre-travel health advice, regardless of the source, is a key motivator for vaccine uptake, and lack of awareness about the vaccination policy is an important barrier. Improving vaccine uptake likely requires system-wide strategies, such as reducing financial barriers and increasing the availability of vaccination centers, as well as greater education of the public, particularly targeting those who are intending to perform Hajj, regarding Hajj-related health risks and prevention strategies. Strategies to improve the ability of local HCW to proactively provide preventive pre-Hajj health advice are also needed. Additionally, the success of the mandatory vaccination policy that is applied to international pilgrims should be modeled to improve compliance with the domestic policy through more rigorous checks and measures. Ongoing evaluation of such strategies is required to monitor the true uptake of vaccines and other health-promoting behaviors among domestic (and international) pilgrims, so that appropriate public health responses can be made to evolving situations.",
