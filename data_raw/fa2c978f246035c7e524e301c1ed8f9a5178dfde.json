            "text": "Background: Nucleoli are composed of possibly several thousand different proteins and represent the most conspicuous compartments in the nucleus; they play a crucial role in the proper execution of many cellular processes. As such, nucleoli carry out ribosome biogenesis and sequester or associate with key molecules that regulate cell cycle progression, tumorigenesis, apoptosis and the stress response. Nucleoli are dynamic compartments that are characterized by a constant flux of macromolecules. Given the complex and dynamic composition of the nucleolar proteome, it is challenging to link modifications in nucleolar composition to downstream effects. Results: In this contribution, we present quantitative immunofluorescence methods that rely on computer-based image analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques by monitoring the dynamic association of proteins and RNA with nucleoli under different physiological conditions. Thus, the protocols described by us were employed to study stress-dependent changes in the nucleolar concentration of endogenous and GFP-tagged proteins. Furthermore, our methods were applied to measure de novo RNA synthesis that is associated with nucleoli. We show that the techniques described here can be easily combined with automated high throughput screening (HTS) platforms, making it possible to obtain large data sets and analyze many of the biological processes that are located in nucleoli.",

As dynamic compartments, nucleoli are characterized by a constant flux of macromolecules, in part due to their shuttling between nucleoli and the surrounding nucleoplasm. Advanced fluorescence microscopy and photobleaching techniques revealed the highly dynamic nature of the nucleolus which is characterized by the transient association of many nucleolar proteins with this compartment [15, 16] . This feature is further emphasized by the short residence time of some of the nucleolar components; for example, fibrillarin may spend less than 40 seconds in the nucleolus of BHK cells [17] . Such a dynamic organization enables the nucleolus to rapidly respond to alterations in cell physiology, coordinate the responses to these changes and communicate them to the rest of the cell [1, 2, [4] [5] [6] . To understand the functional organization of nucleoli, accurate, reliable and fast techniques are required which can reveal subtle differences in the molecular makeup and activities of this compartment.",

However, despite the universal use of proteomic analysis and its success in identifying nucleolar proteins, it is still challenging to study the highly dynamic nucleolar proteome or the processes located in this compartment. As such, the detection of proteins that transiently associate with nucleoli is technically difficult for several reasons [21] . For instance, disruption of the cell integrity, which is necessary to isolate subcellular organelles or compartments, may lead to partial or complete disassembly of the fragile, membrane-less nucleoli. Ultimately, this may cause the loss of some nucleolar components, in particular those that are mobile and shuttle in and out of the nucleolus. On the other hand, the isolation of nucleoli from lysed nuclei by density gradient centrifugation may be complicated by cross-contamination with components that share a similar density or associate with nucleoli due to the lack of a nucleolar membrane [21] . These difficulties instigate the demand for additional techniques that can be combined with proteomic studies and generate new insights into the structural and functional organization of nucleoli. The procedures described by us provide powerful tools that serve this purpose. In particular, we present quantitative methods that rely on computerbased image analysis to measure fluorescence intensities in nucleoli. These assays employ several functions of the analysis software to first identify nucleoli and then quantify fluorescence signals that are located in this compartment. The protocols developed by us can be easily combined with automated high throughput screening (HTS) platforms, making it possible to obtain large data sets and analyze many of the biological processes that are linked to nucleoli.",

            "text": "Quantification of nucleolar fluorescence is complicated by the dynamic nature of nucleoli Measurements of organellar or compartment-specific concentrations of molecules frequently depend on a marker that identifies the subcellular structure of interest. It further requires that the marker detects a specific organelle or compartment under a variety of experimental conditions. However, in the case of nucleoli this approach is challenging, since several of the nucleolar \"marker\" proteins relocate in response to environmental or disease-induced changes. This is demonstrated in Figure 1 for two prominent nucleolar proteins, B23 (also known as nucleophosmin, NPM) and fibrillarin. Both proteins redistribute in response to stress, and their concentration in nucleoli can vary between different cells. Thus, B23 and fibrillarin cannot always serve as a reliable marker to define the nucleolar compartment. To overcome this obstacle, we present several distinct methods that measure pixel intensities in nucleoli (summarized in Figure 2 ). These procedures depend on recent advancements in computer-based image analysis and do not require a specific nucleolar marker protein. The different protocols developed by us accommodate a wide variety of experimental settings. They have been applied successfully to measure nucleolar pixel intensities for GFP-tagged reporter proteins, immunostained endogenous proteins and de novo synthesized RNA. These protocols measure the nucleolar fluorescence in multiple steps that involve three main operations ( The dynamic organization of nucleoli requires new tools for quantification of nucleolar fluorescence. The nucleolar accumulation of B23 and fibrillarin, frequently used as marker proteins for the nucleolus, is sensitive to changes in growth conditions. HeLa cells were grown under normal conditions or exposed to a 1-hour heat shock at 45.5\u00b0C. Cells were fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. Size bar is 20 \u03bcm. Note that a portion of either protein relocates from the nucleolus upon heat stress.",

For this experiment, the pixel intensities/area obtained for RPA194 with the Detect light holes filter operation was defined as 100%. Using DAPI and the Detect dark holes filter, 67% of the pixel intensities were measured, whereas the quantification based on Pol II and the Detect dark holes filter measured 74% of the fluorescence signal. The combination of the DAPI and Pol II images improved the detection of the RNA polymerase I subunit RPA194 to 80%.

The data analysis shows that as a consequence of heat stress, the average nucleolar fluorescence decreased for both B23 and fibrillarin. Figure 5a demonstrates that the stress-induced reduction in nucleolar concentration is highly significant for B23 and fibrillarin when the analysis is performed on individual nucleoli. Since many of the HeLa cell nuclei contain more than one nucleolus, we repeated the analysis after combining the measurements for individual nucleoli within the same nucleus into a single data point (Figure 5b ). Like the analysis of individual nucleoli described above, this approach uncovers that the abundance of B23 and fibrillarin is significantly different under control and heat shock conditions. This is further confirmed when the frequency distribution of pixel intensities is examined (Figure 5c , original results for pixel intensities/area are shown). Importantly, with our approach information can be obtained about the localization of B23 and fibrillarin at the level of single cells (Figure 5d , original results for pixel intensities/area are depicted) or single nucleoli (not shown). It is noteworthy that the differences between control and heat-treated cells in Figure 5 are not suitable for a high throughput screening assay.",

Thus, we examined whether heat stress altered the nucleolar/nuclear ratio of B23 or fibrillarin ( Figure 5e ). With these analyses, no drastic change in the nucleolar/nuclear ratio was detected for B23, whereas the ratio decreased significantly for fibrillarin. Since heat stress reduced the amount of B23 in nucleoli, but not the nucleolar/nuclear ratio, this may suggest that B23 relocated to the cytoplasm or was degraded upon heat shock. We tested this idea by quantifying the nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence in control and heat-stressed cells following published procedures [23] . This quantification showed a reduction of pixel intensities in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment. However, there was no significant change in the ratio of nuclear/cytoplasmic fluorescence, which was 1 \u00b1 0.05 (SEM, n = 26) for control and 1.13 \u00b1 0.06 (SEM, n = 26) for heat-shocked cells. These results are consistent with the idea that the concentration of B23 decreased in response to heat stress.",

In previous studies we had demonstrated that the distribution of RPA194 is less sensitive to heat than B23 or fibrillarin (unpublished data). Additional file 3 shows the double staining of Pol II and RPA194 in heat-treated cells. The staining pattern obtained for Pol II was useful to define the nucleolar compartment under these conditions, and we were able to demarcate nucleoli based on Pol II alone or by the combination of DAPI and Pol II staining. Notably, although RPA194 is less affected by heat stress than other nucleolar proteins, RPA194 relocates within the nucleus in response to other treatments. Therefore, RPA194 is not suitable as a universal marker for nucleoli. By contrast, the non-nucleolar protein Pol II is useful to demarcate nucleoli under these conditions.",

When pixel intensities/ area were compared for individual nucleoli within the same nucleus, variability was low for B23.

For these samples, EU-labeled nucleoli can be properly defined with the DAPI or RNA Pol II image or a combination of DAPI and RNA Pol II images. Thus, the nucleoli demarcated with our methods colocalized with the regions identified by newly synthesized RNA. Figure 3 for HeLa cells.

One step towards this goal is the development of protocols to quantify individual components of the nucleolus in a fashion that is fast, accurate and applicable to a large number of experimental settings. Although fluorescence microscopy can be used to visualize molecules in nucleoli, this method remains rather qualitative and subtle changes in the concentration of nucleolar components can be easily missed. As an alternative method to examine the nucleolar proteome, quantitative mass spectrometry has addressed different aspects of nucleolar organization [15, 30, 31] . One disadvantage of this technique is the necessity to purify nucleoli, possibly leading to the loss of components that are not tightly bound. Thus, for the accurate quantification of molecules anti-fibrillarin antibodies (red) were acquired with a high throughput imaging system equipped with a widefield optical imaging unit. Cells were incubated with the drugs indicated or the vehicle only (water for cycloheximide, DMSO for all other samples) and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described in the Methods section. (b-e) Following correction for background, the probe image was analyzed for the presence of nucleoli, which were defined as bright holes that are between 2 and 5 \u03bcm 2 in size and contain pixel intensities larger than the userdefined threshold. The total number of cells was determined with the DAPI image. It should be noted that the background correction and data analysis were performed in a fully automated fashion without visual inspection of the images. In parts b-e results for three independent experiments are depicted as average + STDEV. (b) For each condition the total number of nucleoli was divided by the number of cells; the results were normalized to DMSO-treated samples. (c) The area stained with anti-fibrillarin antibodies was used to evaluate the effect of different compounds. The threshold was set at 4 \u03bcm 2 ; and the percentage of nucleoli below this threshold was determined for each treatment. Several of the drugs increased the percentage of nucleoli that are smaller than 4 \u03bcm 2 . (d, e) The effects of drugs on the pixel intensity (d) and nucleolar area (e) were measured. Statistically significant differences for drugs delivered in DMSO were determined by One-way ANOVA. Data obtained for water and cycloheximide were compared by Student's t-test. Act D, actinomycin D; Meth, methotrexate; Rosc, roscovitine; DRB, 5,6-dichloro-1beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole; CHX, cycloheximide. located in nucleoli, alternative strategies are needed that circumvent these limitations. To this end, we developed protocols that combine microscopy with computer-based image analysis to measure pixel intensities in nucleoli in a quantitative and reliable fashion. The methods described here keep the structural integrity of cells and nucleoli intact, they are easy to use and applicable to nucleolar molecules that are present in very low abundance or only loosely associated with this compartment. We demonstrated the effectiveness of these techniques by monitoring the dynamic association of proteins B23 and fibrillarin with nucleoli under different physiological conditions. Furthermore, we showed the usefulness of our protocols to detect proteins in nucleoli that are fused to a fluorescent reporter, and to quantify newly synthesized RNA that is associated with nucleoli. Among the protocols discussed here Method 1 is the simplest, and we applied it successfully to several different cell lines. Additional methods described by us are valuable to measure nucleolar fluorescence under more specialized conditions. Signals that can be quantified with the presented techniques go beyond those derived from proteins. We show that our protocols can be easily applied to RNAs or biological activities that are located in nucleoli, as exemplified by the transcription of rRNA genes. Collectively, our methods provide a multi-disciplinary approach that generates information not only at the level of single cells or single nucleoli, but also for large populations of cells. One of the benefits of the protocols designed by us is their compatibility with state-of-the-art fluorescence microscopy. We provide proof-of-principle that these procedures can be combined with high throughput image acquisition using HTS automated platforms. Developing these methods sets the stage to quantify nucleolar components and activities for numerous samples and experimental conditions. Together with the growing amount of information emerging for the nucleolar proteome, methods in quantitative microscopy as they are described here can be expected to produce new insights into the complex biological functions that are orchestrated by the nucleolus.",

Furthermore, background noise can be produced if the difference between fluorescence intensities in nucleoli and the surrounding nucleoplasm is low. This noise, if left without correction, will interfere with the proper identification of nucleoli. Two different filters, the Median filter and Erode/dilate filter, can remove such background noise, thereby limiting the number of false positives. Median filter The Median filter smoothes the image and removes noise by replacing each pixel intensity with the local median intensity. Specifically, after selecting the median pixel value in a specified region, the center pixel will be converted to this value. This procedure is applied to all pixels of the image; it reduces, but does not eliminate completely, noise in the processed image. To apply the Median filter to an image, certain parameters have to be set such as filter width, filter height and sub-sample ratio. In Additional file 1b, we provide an example of the Median filter setting that is appropriate for the analysis of nucleoli in HeLa, MCF7 and NIH3T3 cells. These values are determined in several trials on different images. Since the Median filter will not decrease pixel values for noise to 0, objects with dimensions and fluorescence intensity similar to the nucleoli may generate false positives. To prevent the analysis of false positives, the proper identification should be verified by visual inspection and incorrectly identified objects should be excluded from the analysis. Erode/dilate filters As an alternative to the Median filter, the combination of Erode and Dilate filters can decrease noise and false positives. The Erode filter brings background noise to 0, which is achieved by assigning white pixels the value 0 (black), depending on the number of black pixels in the neighborhood. Although the Erode filter eliminates background noise, this operation may discard some nucleoli if they are smaller or less bright than the threshold set to identify the majority of nucleoli in the cell. Although the Erode filter will miss some of the nucleoli, it has the advantage that the number of false positives is low. Since the Erode filter demarcates an area that is smaller than the authentic nucleolus, the Dilate filter is applied on the Erode image (see Additional file 6 for details). This operation ensures that the regions identified by the software colocalize with the actual nucleolus. The Dilate filter uses the same principle as the Erode filter, however, it assigns to black pixels the value 1 (white), depending on the number of white pixels in the neighborhood. Visual inspection is required to verify that the objects identified as nucleoli correspond to dark holes in the DAPI image.",

Statistical correction (Background correction) Prior to the measurement of pixel intensities in the nucleolus, the probe image has to be corrected for the contribution of background fluorescence. This can be achieved by the statistical correction function. Statistical correction subtracts from each pixel in the image the average intensity value of a selected region which does not contain cells.

(a) If fluorescence signals in nucleoli are below the pixel intensities in the nucleoplasm, the Detect dark holes filter can identify nucleoli using the DAPI or probe image. (b) The Median filter reduces noise; regions within the yellow box were magnified 2.5-fold and contrast was increased to show changes generated by the operation. Note that all of the filters are applied only to define the nucleolar compartment; none of the operations affects the fluorescence of the probe image for which pixel values will be measured. It should be noted that reliance on the DAPI image only may result in identification of false positive that should be eliminated upon visual inspection. By contrast, some nucleoli could be missed when Pol II staining serves as the only reference. Using the Add image, a combination of the DAPI and Pol II staining, increases the accuracy of the identification process. This method is preferable when visual inspection is not permitted, as in experiments designed for HTS assays. (e) For Method 4 cells were incubated with antibodies against hsc70 and Cy3-labeled secondary antibodies (red), DNA was stained with DAPI (blue). Nucleoli with pixel intensities lower than the nucleoplasm are identified with the probe image (Method 4). Dark holes that represent nucleoli in the probe image are detected with the Detect dark holes filter. The Median filter will then reduce noise and improve the identification of nucleoli. None of these operations affects pixel values in the original probe image. Once the original probe image has been corrected for nonspecific background staining, the resulting Statistical correction image (Stat. correction) is used to quantify fluorescence signals. Based on the identification of nucleoli, the software measures pixel intensities for nucleolar segments (yellow) in the Statistical correction image.",

HeLa cells were incubated for 1 h at 45.5\u00b0C, fixed and stained with antibodies against Pol II and RPA194, a subunit of RNA polymerase I. RPA194 was chosen as a marker for nucleoli, because it is less affected by heat than B23 and fibrillarin (unpublished data). Original images are shown in the top panels. Nucleoli are identified based on the Pol II staining (panels in the middle). This requires the Detect dark holes (Holes) and Median filter operations. Alternatively, nucleoli are demarcated by combining the information of DAPI and Pol II staining. To this end, the Add function, Detect dark holes and Median filter operations are performed.",

Details are shown for a protocol that identifies nucleoli with the DAPI image and measures florescence intensities in the probe image. (a) The flowchart provides an overview over the operations that are applied to the DAPI and probe images before nucleolar fluorescence is measured with the multi wavelength cell scoring module. The nucleolar compartment is delimited by applying first the Detect dark holes and subsequently the Median filter. The probe image is corrected for nonspecific background fluorescence; this generates the statistical correction image for which nucleolar fluorescence will be quantified. (b) Individual steps of the analysis are compiled into a journal which will automatically carry out all of the different operations and save data in an Excel sheet. (c) In order to run the analysis with the multi wavelength cell scoring module, several parameters are required to define nucleoli and quantify fluorescence signals. The parameters include size constraints for the compartment and fluorescence intensities above background for both the DAPI image (left panel) and probe image (right panel). Based on this information, the software generates segments that colocalize with nucleoli. Segments are overlaid with the statistical correction image, and fluorescence intensities are measured in the statistical correction image for the areas defined by the segmentation.",

Individual nucleoli were given the same weight in the analysis, independent of the number of nucleoli in each nucleus.
