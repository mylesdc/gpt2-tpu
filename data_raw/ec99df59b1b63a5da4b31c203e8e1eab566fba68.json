            "text": "Exosomes are emerging as important mediators of cell-matrix interactions by means of specific adhesion proteins. Changes in the tissue-specific exosomal protein expression may underlie pathological conditions whereby extracellular matrix turnover and homeostasis is disrupted. Ocular hypertension due to extracellular matrix accumulation in the trabecular meshwork is a hallmark of glucocorticoid-induced glaucoma. In the trabecular meshwork, exosomal fibronectin mediates cell matrix interactions at cellular structures called \"invadosomes\". Trabecular meshwork cells use invadosomes to turn over their surrounding matrix and maintain passageways for flow of aqueous humor. In this study, we observed that human trabecular meshwork explants treated with dexamethasone released exosomes with significantly reduced amounts of fibronectin bound per exosome. Further, we found that exosome-fibronectin binding is heparan sulfate-dependent, consistent with our observation that trabecular meshwork exosomes are enriched in the heparin/heparan sulfate binding annexins A2 and A6. In this way, dexamethasone-treated explants released exosomes with a significant reduction in annexin A2 and A6 per exosome. Interestingly, we did not detect exosomal matrix metalloproteinases, but we identified abundant dipeptidyl peptidase 4, a serine protease whose activity was reduced on exosomes isolated from dexamethasone-treated explants. Together, our findings demonstrate mechanistically how corticosteroid-induced alterations in exosomal adhesion cargo and properties can account for the pathological matrix accumulation seen in many glaucoma patients. thought to be critically important in maintaining healthy IOP [3] . Further, aberrant accumulation of ECM is a characteristic of two major forms of glaucoma, primary open-angle glaucoma and corticosteroid-induced glaucoma [4, 5] . Currently there is no cure for glaucoma and the only effective therapy is lowering IOP [6] . Unfortunately, no clinically available IOP lowering drugs directly target the conventional drainage tissues or address the pathological ECM changes thought to impede drainage.",

Proteomic analysis of TM cell exosomes showed that fibronectin (Fn) is an abundant component [16] . This is consistent with a number of reports which have shown exosomal binding of Fn using a number of methods such as flowcytometry [17] , capture of exosomes on immobilized Fn[13] and density gradient ultracentrifugation [18, 19] . These results show exosomal affinity for Fn may be a common property of exosomes shared across a number of cell types. Recently, exosomes have been implicated in a number of cell-ECM interactions, including several that depend on exosomal Fn [18, 20] . These data suggest exosome-bound Fn plays an important role in cell-matrix interactions. Additionally, the amount of Fn bound to exosomes influences the magnitude of the cell-matrix interaction. For example, decreasing the amount of exosomal Fn decreases cell motility [18] .",

In fact, treatment of TM cells and tissues with corticosteroids has been used to identify the first glaucoma gene, MYOC [22], and as a reliable model to study ECM turnover by the TM in a controlled fashion. Here we used corticosteroid treatment of TM explants to determine whether released exosomes are altered by this glaucoma-inducing compound. We found that despite a Dexamethasone (Dex)-induced increase in Fn secretion by TM explants, the released exosomes had less bound Fn. Additionally, we show that TM exosome-Fn binding is dependent on the presence of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate. Finally, we found that TM exosomes are enriched in the known heparin/heparan sulfate binding proteins annexin A2 and A6 [23, 24] , and that Dex treatment of the TM explants significantly reduced the amount of these annexins per exosome. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that a drug causing ECM accumulation in the TM [4], ocular hypertension [25] and glaucoma in humans and animal models, alters exosomal cargo and properties in a way that can account for the observed ocular phenotype.",

Conditioned media was centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min to pellet debris. Cleared supernatant was transferred to fresh ultracentrifuge tubes. In some experiments, purified human plasma fibronectin (#F0895, Sigma-Aldrich) or exosomedepleted FBS (#S11550, Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA; FBS spun overnight at 100,000 g) was added to cleared supernatant for a final concentration of 2.5 \u03bcg/ml or 10% v:v, respectively.

Cleared supernatant was then concentrated using 100,000 MWCO PES Spin-X UF Concentrator (Corning) following the manufactures instructions. Concentrated CM was mixed with 60% OptiPrep (#D1556, Sigma-Aldrich) to a final concentration of 40% and placed in the bottom of a TLS-55 ultracentrifuge tube.

However, EV release from human TM cells resident in intact tissue has never been shown. To address this, EVs were prepared from the conditioned media of TM explants dissected from human donor eyes. The resulting EVs had a size consistent with exosomes ( Fig  1A) . Compared to other types of EVs, exosomes are reported to be uniquely enriched with tetraspanins including the annexins and the phosphatidylserine binding protein lactadherin [29] . Western blots show that the TM explant derived EVs contain annexin A2, A6 and lactadherin (MFG-E8) (Fig 1A inset) . EVs can be differentiated by their density [30] . Thus, EVs released from the human TM explants, were analyzed after floatation into a continuous iodixanol (OptiPrep) density gradient. Gradient fractions were collected and nanoparticle concentrations were quantified by nanoparticle tracking analysis. The majority of the TM explant EVs ranged between 1.07-1.10 g/ml (Fig 1B) , which is a density consistent with exosomes [31, 32] . Additionally, the vesicles within this density range had a size distribution identical to exosomes (diameter: mean = 104 nm, mode = 99 nm) (Fig 1B inset) . In summary, these data demonstrate for the first time, based on currently accepted criteria, that exosomes are produced in an organotypic culture model of the TM.",

TM cells secrete fibronectin and increase its secretion in response to corticosteroid treatment. To determine whether exosomes from TM explants also bind fibronectin and whether Dex treatment impacts binding, we split TM tissue from a single donor eye into two equal portions (to control for known donor variability in corticosteroid-responses [34] ) and cultured them separately in the presence or absence of dexamethasone (Dex) (100 nM) for 3 days. Western blots show that human TM explants responded to Dex treatment like TM cells in vitro [35] , with increases in Fn and myocilin (Myoc) secretion (Fig 2A and 2B) . Because of this increase in Fn secretion we hypothesized that Dex treatment of human TM explants will increase the amount of Fn bound to released exosomes compared to exosomes from untreated explants. In the six individual donor tissues tested, Dex did not significantly affect the mean or mode vesicle size (Fig 2C and 2D) . While there was a slight increase in mean vesicle concentration in the Dex treated samples, the change varied from donor to donor and was not significant (Fig 2E) . Exosomes from control and Dex treated TM explants were analyzed for Fn content by western blot. Contrary to our hypothesis and despite the variability between donors, there was a significant decrease in the amount of Fn detected per exosome (Fig 2F) .",

However, when TM conditioned media (serum-free) was incubated with FBS or purified Fn and exosomes were prepared, exosomes now pelleted with bound Fn.

While no syndecans were detected in the TM exosome proteome, a secreted heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan was observed [16] . To test whether a receptor for heparan sulfate exists and mediates Fn binding on TM exosomes, we incubated conditioned media from TM cell monolayers with increasing concentrations of heparan sulfate, isolated exosomes from the conditioned media and probed for Fn. Results show a concentration-dependent increase in exosome-bound Fn, attaining maximal binding and statistical significance at 100 pg/ml heparan sulfate (Fig 4A) . Interestingly, Fn-exosome binding was biphasic, first increasing, then decreasing dose-dependently at higher heparan sulfate concentrations. In these experiments, the only Fn source for exosome binding was Fn secreted from the TM cells into the serum free media over 2.5 hrs. In separate experiments, this basal Fn concentration was measured to be 0.24\u00b10.03 \u03bcg/ml (mean\u00b1SD). Using this data, we constructed a dose-response curve that allowed us to estimate an EC 50 value of~16 pg/ml heparan sulfate at the given Fn concentration ( Fig 4B) . To further test whether heparan sulfate mediates the exosome-Fn binding, a bacterial heparanase was shown to remove exosome-bound Fn (Fig 4C) similar to previously reported [17] . These data confirm that TM exosomes are released with a surface receptor for heparan sulfate that mediates the binding of Fn to the exosomes.",

Since Dex treatment of TM decreases MMP secretion/activity [35, 36] and accumulation of matrix material [4] , we next tested whether Dex altered exosomal protease activity. In our initial studies, we failed to detect exosome-specific MMP activity using an insolution fluorescent gelatinase assay. However, proteomic analysis of TM exosomes, identified the serine protease dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) [16] . DPP4 localizes to invadopodia and its inhibition results in reduced invasiveness [37, 38] . When examined specifically, we observed that exosomes released from Dex treated TM explants had significantly reduced levels of DPP4 activity compared to untreated controls (Fig 5C) . A reduction in DPP4 activity with Dex treatment is consistent with the resulting ECM dysregulation and accumulation in the TM of patients with steroid induced ocular hypertension.",

Supporting this notion, increased ECM accumulation is a common hallmark of TM tissue from glaucomatous patients [4] . Impaired ECM turnover in glaucomatous TM suggests that the mechanisms to interact with and modify surrounding ECM are dysfunctional. Cells interact with their surrounding matrix through several cellular structures range from migratory podosomes to invasive invadopodia, which fall under the general category of \"invadosomes\" [10] . While these structures perform different functions in cells, they appear to utilize interconnected processes. With that in mind, exosomes have been shown to perform essential functions in a number of these structures. For example, exosomes are released at and promote the formation of invadopodia [12, 13] . Exosomes also promote the assembly of focal adhesions [39] and control the rapidity and directionality of cell migration [18, 20] . The later phenomenon being due to Fn bound to the exosome surface that may help match matrix ligands to their complimentary cell surface receptors to coordinate invadosome functions [18] . Since exosomes bound to Fn is an essential component of invadosomes, our data support a mechanism by which a similar scenario occurs for invadosomes in TM cells. Thus, Dex-induced reduction in exosome bound Fn provides in part an explanation for the accumulation of ECM material in the TM of Dex-induced animal models of ocular hypertension and patients with steroid induced glaucoma.",

Our data support an additional mechanism by which Fn binds to exosomes in a complex of heparan sulfate and annexin proteins. When we purified TM exosomes, we found a number of proteins of the annexin family of tetraspanins, which are known to be enriched on exosomes [29] and thought to be located on the exosomal surface [42] . From TM exosomes, we detected abundant expression of the HS/heparin-binding annexins A2 and A6 [23, 24] . The idea that exosomes are released with receptors for heparin/heparan sulfate on their surface is supported by the recently described method of exosome purification via heparin affinity column [43] . Since it is well known that Fn binds heparin/heparan sulfate, we propose that exosomal annexins coordinate binding of heparin/heparan sulfate and Fn to TM exosomes. In the present study, we were able to alter Fn binding to exosomes in three ways: First, Dex treatment reduced exosomal Fn binding, which paralleled the reduction in both exosomal annexins A2 and A6. This reduction in TM exosomal annexins is likely due to an accumulation of annexins A2 and A6 in TM cell membrane following Dex treatment [44] . Second, we show that addition of purified heparan sulfate increased the affinity of TM exosomes for Fn. Third, we removed exosome bound Fn by enzymatically cleaving heparan sulfate. Together this demonstrates TM-derived exosomes bind fibronectin through a mechanism similar to but distinctly different than the syndecan-1-mediated mechanism used by myeloma cell-derived exosomes [17] . explants were analyzed for DPP4 activity using a peptide cleavage assay. Measured activity was fitted to a standard curve generated with known amounts of recombinant DPP4.

            "text": "The exact role of exosomes in cell-matrix interactions and degradation is unclear; however exosomes from a number of sources have been shown to possess proteolytic activity crucial in degrading the ECM. The membrane bound MT1-MMP has been detected on exosomes [45] and was able to cleave collagen 1, gelatin and pro-MMP2 into its active form [46] . MMP activity is critically important for maintaining outflow facility and therefore TM function [11] . Unexpectedly, we were unable to detect MMP activity attributable to MMP2 or 9. Instead TM exosomes possessed DPP4 activity and protein [16] . DPP4 is a serine protease that cleaves the two N-terminal amino acids from proteins when the second amino acid is proline or alanine (or possibly serine) [47] . It has a transmembrane region but can be cleaved to a soluble form [48] . The total number of physiological substrates for DPP4 is unknown but it has been proposed that they may be extensive [49] , and include signaling molecules known to affect TM function/outflow facility such as BMP4 [50] , IL-1 [11, 36] , bFGF [51] , CCL2/MCP-1 [52] and bradykinin [53] . DPP4-truncated signaling molecules were shown to have reduced receptor affinity and efficacy compared to their full-length counterparts [54] . DPP4 has also been shown to possess a number of extra-enzymatic properties, such as binding Fn [55] and mediating virus uptake [56] . Although the significance of exosomal DPP4 is unknown, DPP4 has been localized to invadopodia, affects cell migration/invasiveness [37, 38, 57] and is involved in cell adhesion to Fn [55] . In this context, the reduction in exosomal DPP4 activity from Dex treated TM explants may further reflect the general dysfunction in TM ECM homeostasis that results from Dex treatment. The data presented here is the first description of DPP4 activity in the TM. Future studies will have to determine what role, if any, DPP4 plays in TM cell function and outflow facility/IOP via its enzymatic or extra-enzymatic properties.",

            "text": "Corticosteroids have a number of pathological effects on the TM. For example, Dex decreases phagocytic activity of TM cells [58, 59] , increases the secretion of a number of ECM components [21, 60, 61] , inhibits TM cell migration and alters the actin cytoskeleton [62] . Interestingly, exosomes may be linked to these processes, such as cell migration [13, 18, 20] . Further, since the formation of invadosome structures is dependent on coordinated actin rearrangement [10] , the Dex-induced cross-linked actin networks (CLANs) may inhibit the formation of invadosomes and thus alter exosome release. While we chose to use Dex to model the TM dysfunctions that lead to decreased aqueous humor drainage, increased IOP and glaucoma, elevated levels of the cytokine TGF\u03b22 in aqueous humor have also been linked to pathological changes in the TM and glaucoma [50, 63] . Not surprisingly, the global effects of TGF\u03b22 on the TM are similar to those of Dex. They include formation of CLANs, increased secretion of ECM components and accumulation of ECM material in the TM [64] [65] [66] [67] . Since exosomes are localized to invadopodia and promote their formation [12, 13] , the observed TGF\u03b22-induced increase in matrix degradation at TM invadosomes [9] suggests the relationship between TGF\u03b22 and exosomes warrants further investigation.",

This protein had previously been identified as highly enriched in TM exosomes along with two other exosomal proteins we examined here, annexin A6 and DPP4 [16] . While our data shows that Dex treatment results in decreases in both annexins and DPP4 activity on TM explant exosomes, it is likely the effects of Dex on exosomal protein composition is not limited to these proteins. Since Dex works primarily by activation of glucocorticoid receptors, its effects on cell physiology are broad [68] . Future studies will have to determine what other changes in exosomal protein composition, and the resulting exosomal properties, stem from Dex treatment.",

Our results connect the hallmark change in glaucomatous TM tissue, ECM accumulation, with the role of exosomes in cell-matrix interactions. We suspect this connection is not limited to Dex-induced changes in TM. Therefore, we hypothesize that changes in exosome cargo and properties underlie many forms of POAG. Our future studies will test this hypothesis by examining whether other models of glaucomatous TM dysfunction, such as TGF\u03b22 treatment, also produce pathological changes in exosomal cargo and function.",
