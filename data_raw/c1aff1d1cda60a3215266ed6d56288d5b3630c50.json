From the perspective of viral replication, the transgene is not only dispensable but may even be detrimental. Thus vaccine revertants that delete or inactivate the transgene may evolve to dominate the vaccine virus population both during the process of manufacture of the vaccine as well as during the course of host infection. A particular concern is that this vaccine evolution could reduce its antigenicity-the immunity elicited to the transgene. We use mathematical and computational models to study vaccine evolution and immunity. These models include evolution arising during the process of manufacture, the dynamics of vaccine and revertant growth, plus innate and adaptive immunity elicited during the course of infection. Although the selective basis of vaccine evolution is easy to comprehend, the immunological consequences are not. One complication is that the opportunity for vaccine evolution is limited by the short period of within-host growth before the viral population is cleared. Even less obvious, revertant growth may only weakly interfere with vaccine growth in the host and thus have a limited effect on immunity to vaccine. Overall, we find that within-host vaccine evolution can sometimes compromise vaccine immunity, but only when the extent of evolution during vaccine manufacture is severe, and this evolution can be easily avoided or mitigated.",

The dynamics of this process are studied here with mathematical models. The potential for vaccine evolution within the host is somewhat limited by the short-term growth of the vaccine population before it is suppressed by the immune response.

Evolution of an attenuated vaccine is likely to be a reversion toward the wildtype state, the rate of this process depending heavily on vaccine design and the duration of vaccine virus replication in the host (reviewed in [1] ). To a first approximation, reversion toward the wild-type state should lead to the vaccination more closely resembling natural infection [2] , such as higher virus densities, side-effects and disease, and possibly an increased immune response. Within-host evolution of an attenuated vaccine might also predispose the virus to better transmission-also reflecting the wild-type state-but this outcome is not assured: viral adaptation to different tissues within the host may hamper growth in and dissemination from tissues important in transmission (e.g., [3] ).",

            "text": "The expected consequences for evolution of a recombinant-vectored vaccine are fundamentally different [4] . In most cases, the antigen against which immunity is sought comes from a foreign transgene inserted into a competent viral vector without replacing any vector genes. Vectors in development include adenovirus, VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus) and CMV (cytomegalovirus). The vector genome carries out all viral amplification and transmission functions, and the transgene does not contribute to any process benefiting vector reproduction. From an evolutionary perspective, the transgene is both dispensable and potentially costly: selection may favor loss of the transgene and thus loss of vaccine's ability to elicit immunity against the antigen encoded by the transgene. This evolution therefore generates something akin to infection by the wild-type vector. As vectors are typically chosen to be avirulent for immune competent hosts, vaccine evolution will result in no more than a harmless infection that does not generate immunity to the antigen encoded by the transgene. Considerable attention has recently been given to the evolution of attenuated vaccines and designs that retard their evolution. Evolutionary stability of attenuated vaccines seems attainable by engineering designs, including the introduction of hundreds of silent codon changes, genome rearrangements, and some types of deletions (comparisons and reviews are provided by [1, 5, 6] ). Far less thought has gone into the consequences of evolution for recombinant vector vaccines or of strategies to minimize this evolution.",

Both realms are part of a continuum, any evolution during manufacturing advancing evolution within the host (Fig 1) . The inoculum sets the starting point for within-host evolution, and indeed, an inoculum that is mostly revertant will limit vaccine efficacy even if no further evolution occurs within the host. From population genetics principles [9] , even if the inoculum has a seemingly low frequency of revertant, the evolution that has occurred prior to inoculation may greatly accelerate within-host evolution (Fig 1) .

            "text": "Intrinsic fitness differences. Intrinsic fitness effects are considered here to be those that stem from the intracellular processes of viral gene expression and assembly, independent of host immune responses. Intrinsic fitness differences between the vaccine and the revertant (wild-type vector) are plausible because the transgene is non-essential and has no evolutionary history with the vector genome. Thus, the insertion may be disruptive, and the resulting antigen expression may interfere with vector functions. Intrinsic fitness effects are expected to affect evolution during vaccine manufacture as well as within-host evolution, but it has largely been investigated in vitro, as would apply to manufacture and the pre-host phase. Indeed, intrinsic fitness differences may be the sole or at least the most important bases of vaccine inferiority. Because recombinant viruses have often been observed to evolve loss or down-regulation of engineered inserts, they are now commonly observed during in vitro growth for their 'genetic stability' (e.g., [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] ). Some recombinant viral genomes are stable over short term transfers in culture, others not, indicating that intrinsic fitness effects of the engineering are not universal. Thus, the possibility of vaccine inferiority should not be ignored, and furthermore, even when a vaccine appears to be stable over a few transfers, the short term population where the revertant has a 10% fitness advantage and starts at a frequency of 10 \u22126 . The curve shows the well-known population genetic principle that, while the favored type (revertant) is rare, its absolute frequency changes very little. But the frequency eventually reaches a level at which evolution is rapid. The yellow box represents a possible period of pre-host evolution, the green box representing the period of within-host evolution. The periods of within-host evolution are drawn to be the same length in right and left panels, as if the vaccine has the same within-host duration in both cases. The arrow represents a possible point at which manufacture would end and an inoculum be created, thus defining the boundary between pre-host and within-host evolution. The left panel depicts a short period of vaccine manufacture, the right a longer period of vaccine manufacture and one in which more pre-host evolution has occurred. It is thus easy to see the potential importance of pre-host vaccine evolution on within-host evolution, for even when the revertant is not a large component of the inoculum, it can be poised for rapid evolution within the host (right panel). The curve obeys p t \u00bc p 0 w t p 0 w t \u00fe1\u00c0 p 0 , in which p t represents the revertant frequency in generation t and w the fitness of revertant relative to vaccine. The curve is drawn for a common evolutionary process across pre-host and within-host evolution, but evolution in the within-host phase will typically experience different parameters than evolution in the pre-host phase. retention of antigen expression may mask an underlying long term instability. Thus most observations of stability merely set limits on the possible magnitudes of inferiority. Yet even if vaccine selective 'neutrality' turns out to be fleeting, merely a mistaken impression from shortterm observations, we will find that the phenomenon of short-term stability mirrors a solution to minimize vaccine evolution within the host-the solution of limiting vaccine growth.",

Fig 2 presented a hypothetical case in which evolutionary superiority of revertant did not suppress vaccine growth, hence evolution had little effect on antigen production. That process was one in which there was no interference between vaccine and revertant growth. Evolution does become important to antigen levels if vaccine and revertant interfere so that vaccine growth is depressed by the revertant, or if the duration of infection by the vaccine strain is reduced. In either case the revertant will then suppress antigen levels. Again, the problem is complicated by the limited duration of the infection: reduced antigen production due to vaccine evolution depends not only on interference between the two genomes but also on overall growth and the extent to which it affects the level of immunity to vaccine and vector. A mechanism that forces interference between vaccine and revertant can also limit the total amount of viral growth, thereby limiting evolution.",

This led to a resurgence of interest in the role of innate immunity in the initial control of infections. Later modeling studies of influenza infections suggested yet another mechanism, that the initial control of these infections could be largely described by simple resource limitation models, of the type used in ecology for population growth [25, 26] . The realization that all three different processes might suppress viral infection led to more careful examination of the roles of different factors in the early control of acute infections [27] [28] [29] [30] .

Conserved structures of pathogens targeted by innate immunity include dsRNA, frequently accompanying viral replication, plus lipopolysaccharides and endotoxins of bacteria [31] . Because innate immunity involves the activation of a standing population of immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, or triggering of the complement pathway, it can be elicited much more rapidly than the adaptive response; the latter requires many rounds of clonal expansion of rare antigen-specific cells to generate a population large enough to control the infection [32] . Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the innate response is required for the initial stimulation of the adaptive response [33] . Thus, innate immunity has a major role in early control of the viral population. Innate immunity can control both vector and vaccine, and it is not likely to discriminate between two genomes that differ by a single, non-essential gene (the transgene).",

But adaptive immunity to the antigen is specific to the vaccine and is thus another reason-besides intrinsic fitness effects-that the vaccine may have lower fitness than revertant. The evolutionary consequences should be the same for both types of inferiority, reducing the long term generation of antigen levels within the host, but adaptive immunity would be irrelevant to vaccine evolution during manufacturing and during early growth within the host. An interesting twist is that adaptive immunity to the antigen might eventually feed back negatively on itself to limit its own growth-immunity against a virus is intrinsically inhibitory, so adaptive immunity against the vaccine will limit vaccine growth and thus limit antigen build-up that would fuel further immunity. One question is whether this self-inhibition is worsened with vaccine evolution.",

However, without a specific empirical basis for the parameter values chosen, the details have little assured relevance. We therefore provide contour plots that allow easy comparison of many different trials in which parameters of specific interest are varied (Fig 5) . These graphs show the cumulative vaccine load (left panel) and final level of immunity to vaccine antigen (right) as a function of initial revertant frequencies and selective advantage of the revertant (c). A strong correspondence exists between vaccine load and the level of immunity generated, as is observed empirically following infection [40] . Subsequent figures therefore illustrate the level of immunity. The initial composition of the inoculum matters somewhat more to the adaptive response than does the intrinsic cost of the vaccine (as evident by the contours being closer to vertical rather than horizontal), but this pattern rests heavily on the parameter ranges chosen. Indeed, unrealistically large values of initial revertant levels (W(0)) are illustrated to offer contrast, as the outcomes are otherwise moderately insensitive to vaccine composition in these graphs. The good news is that, when the inoculum is mostly vaccine and revertant fitness is not high, evolution has little effect on viral load or final level of immunity (i.e., the lower left of each panel has a broad area of one color). This occurs because of the short duration of infection. Over longer periods of vaccine growth, the selective advantage of the revertant would undoubtedly play an increasing role in evolution. The large number of parameters (13) limits the degree to which we can conduct comprehensive sensitivity tests, so the trials are confined to variations in those parameters of greatest interest. Vaccine evolution driven by adaptive immunity. We focus on infections of short duration-that are cleared and do not rebound once suppressed. Factors that limit the duration of infection include resource limitation, and innate and adaptive immunity. For the most part these factors act equally against vaccine and revertant virus. Only one factor, adaptive immunity to the vaccine antigen (X), acts specifically on the vaccine virus and not the revertant. Intuition suggests that this adaptive immunity to the antigen can potentially suppress the vaccine's growth and give an advantage to the revertant. As with intrinsic fitness costs, this selection might feed back to limit vaccine growth and thus limit the development of further immunity to antigen by allowing revertant to grow and interfere with vaccine. This section considers whether these arguments are supported by the model. Any real vaccine that elicits immunity against the antigen may also experience an intrinsic fitness cost. The effect of immunity on evolution would then be confounded with the effect of intrinsic fitness effects on evolution, making it difficult to isolate one from the other. The models do not face this problem, however. They can be parameterized so that the only possible selection against the vaccine comes from immunity (by setting c = 0). Vaccine populations can also be freed of revertant by omitting revertant from the inoculum and setting the mutation rate to 0. Thus, we can measure the effect of adaptive immunity on vaccine growth from trials that lack revertant and then compare those results with trials that include revertant. The revertant is included at half the inoculum (representing pre-host evolution); it has no intrinsic fitness advantage over vaccine. Immunity (to vaccine) is reduced to just over a third of the level with no evolution. (Lower left): The revertant is a small fraction of the inoculum (0.01) but it has a 20% fitness advantage over vaccine. The level of immunity is 71% that with no evolution. (Lower right): The revertant is half the inoculum and has a 20% fitness advantage over vaccine. The level of immunity is now less than 0.3% that with no evolution-a depression of almost 3 orders of magnitude. The trials are parameterized so that virus is controlled by innate immunity with final clearance due to adaptive immunity; the mutation rate is 0 in all cases.

In contrast, the impairment specific to vaccine is due to the level of immunity (X) and the vaccine impairment parameter k X . Thus, immunity can develop while imposing little or no impairment, i.e., when k X ! 0. Second, adaptive immunity to the vector (Y) develops according to its own growth rate parameter (\u03d5 Y ) in response to vaccine plus revertant abundance (V + W), and it impairs both vaccine and revertant growth equally by impairment parameter k Y . When revertant is present, it increases the level of immunity to vector backbone/revertant but does not directly affect immunity specific to the vaccine. This immunity will result in faster clearance of both revertant and vaccine, and this results in decreased immunity to the antigen; this is the 'interference' that causes a problem from vaccine evolution.",

Of the two parameters, k Y has a much larger effect than does k X : compared to the left panel, the right panel, with revertant present, has vaccine-specific immunity suppressed more than an order of magnitude along the k Y axis, much less so on the k X axis. We attribute this effect of k Y to interference by the revertant: the revertant elicits high levels of immunity (Y) that indiscriminately also suppress vaccine, thereby suppressing vaccine-specific immunity X.

These conjectures are supported by Fig 7: when the revertant frequency in the inoculum is high, increasing the inoculum size appreciably increases the magnitude of immunity; a much reduced benefit is seen when revertant frequency is low, likely because there is less evolutionary interference from the revertant. These results suggest parallel benefits from reducing the frequency of the revertant in the inoculum and increasing the dose.

An intrinsic fitness advantage of the revertant virus, expected because transgene expression is likely to have metabolic and other costs, will lead to vaccine being gradually overgrown by revertant. This is only likely to cause a reduction in the immunity to the vaccine antigen if it leads to a reduction in the absolute amount (as opposed to merely a reduction in relative frequency) of the vaccine virus. There are in fact several mechanisms by which an ascending revertant population may suppress vaccine: revertant can reduce the amount of the vaccine virus in the host if the revertant uses resources required for virus replication or if the vaccine virus is cleared by the innate or adaptive responses elicited by the revertant.",

Critical to understanding and addressing this problem is recognizing that the vaccine may evolve both within the host and also during manufacture, whereby the inoculum already carries modest to high levels of revertant. The composition of the inoculum can have a large effect on within-host evolution and immunity. By limiting the amount of revertant in the inoculum, and also by boosting the inoculum level, it should usually be possible to limit the amount of within-host vaccine evolution and ensure that immunization is effective. We emphasize, however, that this solution will typically not work for transmissible vaccines and vaccines that establish long term infections within the host. Furthermore, using a large inoculum may seem to defeat the purpose of using a live vaccine.",

Small inocula that contain vaccine plus revertant are more prone to reduced immunity levels than are large inocula with little revertant. Composition of the vaccine has the larger effect for the inoculm sizes and initial revertant fractions shown, as indicated by the contours being more horizontal than vertical.

Another simple approach would be to compete several different vaccine designs in vitro and pick the design with highest retention of the transgene. Any approach using in vitro adaptation needs to avoid adapting the vector to the extent that it compromises ability to grow in vivo. Most of these possibilities are ways to reduce pre-host evolution and reduce revertant concentration in the inoculum.

For assessing vaccine evolution, the relevant biological realms are within the host and in vitro. In vitro growth environments are the more easily studied and may reveal much about a vaccine's intrinsic propensity to evolve loss of antigen expression. There are various ways intrinsic fitness effects and their evolutionary consequences might be studied. Vaccine growth in tissue culture may reveal some aspects of intrinsic fitness effects and should be relatively easy to study. Deletion of the transgene per se would be detectable by PCR, and the fitness advantage of revertant over vaccine could be measured from changes in revertant frequency. The quantitative relevance of an in vitro estimate to in vivo growth would be unknown, but the measure should allow qualitatively comparing engineering designs that improve intrinsic vaccine fitness. If vaccine reversion were due to down regulation of the transgene instead of deletion, fitness estimation would require knowing the mutations responsible and monitoring their frequencies. Use of culture-wide antigen levels to measure fitness might provide a sense of whether vaccine evolution would lead to reduced antigen levels in vivo, but it would be less sensitive in measuring evolution than is measuring mutation frequencies.",

First the vaccine should elicit an immune response that rapidly clears the pathogen (i.e. the rate constant for clearance of the pathogen, call it k P , is high). Second, the vaccine should elicit a large response to this antigen. This requires that the antigen rapidly elicits immunity (i.e. has low \u03d5 X , and in terms of immunology it should be an immunogenic antigen), and also requires a high vaccine viral load to generate a large response. Engineering this requires tackling a trade-off between avoiding vaccine clearance (i.e. having a low k X ) but allowing for rapid clearance of the pathogen (having a high k P ). Vaccines designed to express the antigen in a form that is different from that in the pathogen might help solve this problem. Thus, to elicit immunity to influenza, one might design secreted forms of the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase proteins. A recombinant hemagglutinin protein that is secreted rather than on the virion surface would prevent the antibody response to this protein from clearing the recombinant vector vaccine (have low k X ) without compromising the clearance of the influenza virus pathogen which has hemagglutinin on its surface (i.e. has high k P ). In this manner our model allows the identification and tuning of parameters that affect vaccine efficacy, and a comprehensive search of parameter space would identify ideal combinations of vaccine properties.",

Furthermore, those components may vary across tissues within the host. Sampling across this heterogeneity in vivo will be challenging but may be necessary to know whether, when, and where vaccine evolution is a problem. If revertant remains a minority of the population, we expect that vaccine evolution can be ignored.

We have modeled that responses to different antigens are generated independently of each other and do not compete. We have done so because vaccines are likely to cause relatively mild infections during which the densities of pathogen and immune cells do not reach sufficiently high levels required for competitive interactions to be important. The adaptive immune response may be more influenced by recruitment which is followed by a period of proliferation even in the absence of antigen [48] [49] [50] .

The left plot considers the absence of revertant, hence no evolution. The right panel introduces revertant at 3/ 4 the inoculum, with the same total inoculum size as in the left panel. The revertant reduces immunity X, but the effect of increasing k X is not made worse by the revertant.
