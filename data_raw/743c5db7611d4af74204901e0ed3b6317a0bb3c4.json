Effective pandemic management requires support from the population at risk for measures undertaken to mitigate the pandemic's spread. Previous studies during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 have shown that individual beliefs and perceptions play an important role in subsequent desired behavior change [2, 3] . Higher perceived effectiveness of measures undertaken [3, 4] and higher perceived threat of the disease led to higher rates of positive behavioral change, and better knowledge also increased the uptake of preventive measures [5, 6] . Similarly, in an anticipated H5N1 epidemic these factors also influenced both self and community protective behavior [7] .",

In tropical regions, influenza exhibits different seasonal patterns with a high baseline influenza-like illness rates and multiple influenza epidemic peaks annually [13] . This may result in different behaviors towards influenza compared to temperate countries with clear influenza seasons during winter months -for example the generally lower influenza vaccination uptake in the tropics [14] . However, there have been few studies on the knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the influenza pandemic in a tropical setting. There have also been no studies comparing such differences in various cohorts such as influenza cases, close contacts, and healthcare workers.

Other measures implemented include daily temperature monitoring, prompt reporting of all illnesses to healthcare staff, and laboratory testing of influenza-like illness clusters. Laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1-2009 were isolated at home for 7 days, while close contacts of these confirmed cases were allowed to continue working but were given post-exposure chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir and were segregated from the rest of the military units to prevent spread.

Questions on knowledge were used to assess a servicemen's general knowledge on pandemic influenza and on the recommended response measures. Questions on attitudes were used to assess perceptions towards pandemic influenza and these measures. Questions on practices were used to assess the actual compliance and practice of these measures.

This has substantial implications for public health educators and planners in implementing pandemic preparedness plans. It was evident that the knowledge score was the main predictor of the attitude and practice scores with strong correlation between knowledge and practice scores and knowledge and attitude scores. On the other hand, attitude scores alone did not predict practice score and the correlation between attitude and practice scores was weak. This shows that good knowledge is important to enable individuals to have better attitudes and practices in influenza risk reduction. In a previous study on SARS, better knowledge was also found to equate with better adoption of precautionary practices [6] . Clear communication and provision of updated information also helped improve vigilance and preparedness during the current pandemic [11] . A recent study found that educating the public about specific actions to reduce risks and communicating about the government's plans and resources helped to improve compliance to good practices [9] . Of interest, higher educational status in our cohort was a significant negative predictor of good practice, showing that educational status alone does not determine behaviours. Two previous studies on influenza [9] and SARS [2] also showed that education level did not have any effect on uptake of recommended behvioural patterns. Regarding influenza vaccine uptake and education level, some studies have showed that a higher education level resulted in higher influenza vaccination uptake [20, 21] , while another study on influenza vaccination uptake showed varying influence of education levels on influenza vaccination in different countries [22] . As such, it is important to focus on inculcating the correct knowledge to individuals as it will influence both attitudes and practices. On the other hand, positive attitudes on its own may not translate into desired behavioral change in the absence of adequate knowledge. For the exposure groups, influenza cases had the highest practice scores of all 4 groups. Use of masks was also highest among the influenza cases. Having been infected with pandemic influenza appears to have a substantial impact in behavior and adopting risk reduction practices. Although most if not all of these influenza cases will not be re-infected by the same pandemic virus again, adopting these practices will place them and their close contacts at lower risk for other influenza and respiratory virus infections.",

            "text": "At the same time, healthcare workers and contacts of influenza cases also had higher practice scores compared to general servicemen. Vaccination uptake was highest among healthcare workers and avoidance behaviors were the highest among contacts of influenza cases. Healthcare workers and contacts have had greater and more direct exposure to influenza cases compared to the general population and this first-hand experience may have resulted in behavioral changes. This possibly reflects the effect of actual real-life experiences with influenza on individual behavior. It will therefore be important to determine solutions to instill the same level of positive behaviors in the general population without the need for prior infection or the personal experience such as being close contacts or healthcare workers. One possible solution would be the sharing and imparting of personal experiences to the general community Ethnicity may also play a role in determining practices. We found that Malays (an ethnic minority) had significantly higher positive practices as compared to the Chinese (the ethnic majority). The Indians (another ethnic minority) also had higher practice scores as compared to the Chinese although this was not statistically significant. A previous study also reported that the ethnic minority groups had a 3.2 times higher likelihood of making recommended changes during this current influenza pandemic [9] . Another multi-ethnic study on a different subject (terrorism) showed that worry and voidance behaviours were more common among minority groups, suggesting that this effect may be due to shared perceptions of vulnerability or low levels of control [20] but further research is required to determine the actual causes for this phenomenon during epidemics. Overall efforts at increasing positive behaviours should therefore be rolled out to the entire population, with special focus on the ethnic majority. We found that age, sex, and housing-type (as a proxy of socio-economic status) did not predict knowledge, attitudes or practices. However, the vast majority (> 80%) of our participants were from the 19-23 age group due to the inherent nature of the military and our study was not structured to detect any differences due to extremes of age. In another pandemic study in the United Kingdom, younger age was found to have greater uptake of recommended behaviors but not for sex and household income [9] . However, another study on behavioral changes during SARS found that the older age had an increased beneficial effect on behavioral change but not sex [2] . This shows the differences in behaviors in different settings and towards different threats. Future studies need to be performed in different age groups in specific settings to determine the actual platforms for intervention.",

The questionnaire was also administered over a period of time and individuals' responses may have changed across time as they are exposed to different messages across time, include messages highlighting the pandemic's mild nature. We attempted to reduce this by starting the survey after the pandemic's peak and concluding it before the epidemic subsided. The response rate of 34.8% may also be of concern, but the study was sufficiently powered for all groups except influenza cases which numbers were smaller. Interestingly, the response rates among cases/contacts was high, and lower among healthcare workers, which may itself suggest behavioral differences which should be further studied. Given the anonymous nature of the survey, we were not able to obtain any data about non-responders. Finally, our study was a cross-sectional survey and may not have been able to assess the true association between knowledge, attitudes and practices, and future cohort studies should be considered to validate the findings.",
