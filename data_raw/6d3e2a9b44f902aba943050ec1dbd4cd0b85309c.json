The structure and dynamics of CF respiratory tract microbial communities during the early stages of P. aeruginosa colonization were characterized by pyrosequencing and cloning-sequencing. The respiratory microbiota showed high diversity, related to the young age of the CF cohort (mean age 10 years). Wide inter-and intra-individual variations were revealed. A common core microbiota of 5 phyla and 13 predominant genera was found, the majority of which were obligate anaerobes. A few genera were significantly more prevalent in patients never infected by P. aeruginosa. Persistence of an anaerobic core microbiota regardless of P. aeruginosa status suggests a major role of certain anaerobes in the pathophysiology of lung infections in CF. Some genera may be potential biomarkers of pulmonary infection state. which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.",

The respiratory tract of CF patients is colonized and infected by numerous bacteria from an early age. Among cultivable pathogens, which include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Burkholderia cepacia complex and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, P. aeruginosa is the most prevalent pathogen in CF. In children with CF, Kosorok et al. (2001) demonstrated a longitudinal correlation between P. aeruginosa acquisition and gradual deterioration of pulmonary function. Therefore, early detection of P. aeruginosa appears crucial for maximizing the chances of efficiently controlling this pathogen, notably by early institution of anti-Pseudomonas antibiotherapy (Valerius et al. 1991) .",

(2010) , the community composition of the CF pulmonary microbiota is a better indicator of disease progression than the presence of P. aeruginosa alone. The endogenous respiratory microbiota may modulate pathogenesis in a polymicrobial context through microbe-microbe and polymicrobe-host interactions (Sibley and Surette 2011) .

The lung infections of CF patients are also considered as polymicrobial (Sibley and Surette 2011; Sibley et al. 2006) . Recently, van der Gast et al. (2011) identified a core group dominated by P. aeruginosa and a satellite group composed of multiple microbial species, including species not routinely identified by culture and not recognized as CF pathogens. The inability of conventional infection models to detect a pathogenic response to certain microorganisms known as commensals should not mean that their potential to contribute to polymicrobial infection can be disregarded (Sibley et al. 2008) . The CF lung infection model has thus moved from a classical to an ecological paradigm.",

Twenty spontaneous sputum samples (4 per patient) were collected and homogenized with an equal volume of dithiothreitol (Digest-EUR \u00ae Eurobio, Courtaboeuf, France) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Clinical, therapeutic and biological data were compiled such as CFTR mutation, clinical state, antibiotic treatment and P. aeruginosa status. Sputum sample quality was verified by cytological examination of fresh smears and classified according to the number of epithelial cells and leukocytes. Sputum samples were classified in three quality classes: poor quality when the number of epithelial cells (cells/field) was \u226525 and the number of leukocytes (cells/field) was \u226410; appropriate quality when the number of epithelial cells was \u226425 and the number of leukocytes (cells/field) was \u226510.

OTUs of interest were also further classified to the species level using the RDP SeqMatch tool. Prior to alpha and beta diversity analyses, the OTU table was rarefied to the smallest number of reads obtained in a sample. Alpha diversity was determined using the Shannon index, Chao-1 estimator and equitability (evenness) index. Beta diversity was assessed using the Adonis test and the Bray-Curtis distance and visualized by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Diversity was also evaluated using the Simpson's diversity index (SDI) transformed with the arcsine square root. A non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis test) statistical test was applied in QIIME to test whether genera abundance was significantly associated with their associated metadata. A hierarchical ascendant classification (HAC) by Euclidean distance and an abundance heatmap were also obtained using XLstat software package (http://www.xlstat.com). The core microbiota was defined as OTUs present in at least 50 % of samples at a minimum relative abundance of 0.1 % of the total bacterial community. Sequences of the selected OTUs were aligned to the Greengenes core-setaligned using PyNast with default parameters. The concordance between detection of P. aeruginosa using 454 pyrosequencing and culture based-method was assessed. The alignment was then filtered to remove gaps and hypervariable regions using a lane mask and a tree was generated using FastTree (Price et al. 2009 ). A circular phylogenetic tree was then constructed using the Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL) (Letunic and Bork 2007) . The sequence data were deposited at the NCBI Short Read Archive (BioProject no. PRJNA258440).",

The high diversity found in the present study can be explained by the young age of these patients (mean age 10 years) because microbial diversity is maximal in this age range (Cox et al. 2010).

Nine of them have been described to be the most abundant genera in healthy lungs (Wat et al. 2008) . In agreement with previous studies, there was a large abundance of obligate anaerobes such as Veillonella and Prevotella (Tunney et al. 2008; Cheung et al. 2013) , and facultative anaerobes such as Gemella, which is thought to be a biomarker for the exacerbation in CF lung (Carmody et al. 2013) . OTUs corresponding to uncultivable bacteria affiliated to the TM6, TM7 and WPS-2 phyla also reported to be components of the oral microbiota (Adler et al. 2013) , were present at low abundances in the sputum samples. While TM7 has already been detected in CF sputum samples (Blainey et al. 2012) , this is the first time, to our knowledge, that TM6 and WPS-2 are reported in CF. The large abundance of so-called 'oral bacteria' in the respiratory microbiota of CF children corroborates the viewpoint that the oral cavity is a potential source of pathogens and other bacteria such as anaerobes that reach and colonize the lower airways of CF patients (Boutin et al. 2015; Rivas Caldas and Boisram\u00e9 2015) . In fact, undoubtedly, upper and lower airways are interconnected and it would be interesting to determine the origin of pathogens to better understand their colonization process in CF.",

In the present study, the issue was to know whether P. aeruginosa implantation was subsequent to a proliferation of anaerobes, or the contrary (chicken-and-egg problem). As the same anaerobic genera were detected in patients initially classified as 'never' , which became P. aeruginosa-positive a few months later, this might suggest that anaerobes do not impede implantation of P. aeruginosa. Indeed, mass-DNA sequencing revealed that, besides the well-known lung pathogens, a core microbiota including four persistent anaerobes genera (Veillonella, Streptococcus, Actinomyces and Prevotella) exists and is common to pulmonary diseases (Cheung et al. 2013) . Rogers et al. (2015) recently described the 'like begets like' phenomenon, whereby most dominant pathogens in microbiota are determinant for the implantation of P. aeruginosa. The role of these four genera as potential enhancers of P. aeruginosa colonization remains to be clearly demonstrated.",

The difference in bacterial density and in the number of reads of P. aeruginosa between 'never' and 'free' patients was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Thus, bacterial density did not appear to be a potential marker of P. aeruginosa implantation. Similarly, Shannon's index and equitability were not significantly different between 'free' and 'never' CF patients. Conversely, richness was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in 'never' .61); observed species: 71.6 (63.85-79.43)] than in 'free' patients ); observed species: 55.9 (45.24-66.71)] (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). Moreover, as depicted in Fig. 2b , the structure of the microbiota was affected by the Lee's status (see also Additional file 6: Fig. S3 ). Indeed, a significant clustering by Lee's status was observed (Adonis test p = 0.0199, R 2 = 0.105). The present results may suggest that the richness of the CF respiratory microbiota is directly negatively impacted by first acquisition of P. aeruginosa; this very preliminary data has to be reinforced with a larger sample dataset.",
