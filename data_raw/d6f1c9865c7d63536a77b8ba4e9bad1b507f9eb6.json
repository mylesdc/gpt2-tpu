The aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of hyponatremia in 3938 children who were admitted to the Cheil General Hospital and Women's Health Care Center with respiratory infections. Clinical data were collected, and multiplex RT-PCR analyses were done for various microorganisms. Hyponatremia was observed in 531 (13.5%) patients. The incidence of hyponatremia differed according to the respiratory tract infection (P < 0.0001) and microorganism (P = 0.001). In children with hyponatremia, the age at admission was significantly older (P < 0.0001), male gender was more frequent (P = 0.019), CRP was higher (P < 0.0001), and coinfection with multiple organisms was more common (P = 0.001) than in children without hyponatremia. In multivariate analyses, an older age at admission (P = 0.006), male gender (P = 0.004), and increased CRP (P < 0.0001) were independent risk factors. Sodium levels correlated negatively with WBC (P = 0.037), CRP (P < 0.0001), and number of hospital days (P = 0.020). The AUC values of age (0.586, P < 0.0001), CRP (0.599, P < 0.0001), and blood urea nitrogen (0.559, P < 0.0001) were all significant predictors of hyponatremia.

It was 10.5% in acute bronchitis, 13.4% in interstitial pneumonia, 16.7% in segmental and lobar pneumonia, and lowest (9.7%) in acute bronchiolitis. Upper respiratory infections were overrepresented in the hyponatremia group (14.6% vs 2.9%), whereas acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis were underrepresented in the hyponatremia group. In univariate analyses, children with hyponatremia were significantly older (P < 0.0001), more likely to be male (P = 0.019), and had higher CRP levels (P < 0.0001) and coinfections with multiple organisms (P = 0.001) than children without hyponatremia.

Since Stormont and Waterhouse first reported the association of hyponatremia with pneumonia in 1962 11 , only case reports and a few relevant studies have been published about this relationship in children [3] [4] [5] 12 . The incidence of hyponatremia has been reported to be about 30% in a small number of children with pneumonia or acute HRSV bronchiolitis [3] [4] [5] , but it has not been estimated in children hospitalized with acute tonsillopharyngitis or acute bronchitis. Moreover, no report has considered the incidence of hyponatremia in children with respiratory tract infections according to the viral etiology, such as adenovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus. Our study population was the first and largest cohort in the literature evaluating the incidence of hyponatremia in children with respiratory tract infections according to the causal microorganisms or radiologic findings. We found an overall incidence of hyponatremia (<135 mEq/L) of 531 from among 3938 patients (13.5%), and we found no cases with a sodium level of less than 126 mEq/L or seizures. Although a previous small cohort suggested that there was no association between hyponatremia and etiology or radiological patterns in pneumonia 3 , we found that the incidence of hyponatremia was highest (20.7%) in children with adenovirus infection and lowest (7.8%) in those with mycoplasma infection. Although adenovirus was not the most common cause of infection, it was the leading cause of hyponatremia. It may be because the adenovirus infection has a more intenstive systemic inflammatory response as reflected in a greater CRP elevation and more fever than other respiratory viral infections.

Now, we suggest that in patients with respiratory tract infections, SIADH could be caused by the inflammation itself. Recent research revealed that inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)\u22121\u03b2 and IL-6 are involved in the development of hyponatremia associated with inflammatory conditions, and they might be related to ADH secretion 18-20 . Landgraf et al. 21 reported that IL-1\u03b2 stimulated both the central and peripheral release of vasopressin in rats. In addition, Palin et al. 22 suggested that IL-6 induces activation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) neurons in response to a lipopolysaccharide injection. Most notably, Mastorakos et al. 23 2 hours after IL-6 injection in six patients. They suggested that IL-6 activated magnocellular AVP-secreting neurons and that it might be involved in the development of inappropriate AVP secretion. Previously, two small studies on pneumonia showed an inverse relationship between inflammatory markers and serum sodium levels 3, 24 . In our large cohort, we demonstrated that serum sodium levels were inversely associated with the degree of inflammation (as demonstrated by WBC and CRP levels) in children with various respiratory tract infections, and our logistic regression analysis found that those levels independently predicted the development of hyponatremia. CRP is produced in hepatocytes in response to IL-6. Very few reports have considered the factors that influence serum sodium levels in children with respiratory tract infections. No one has previously reported the effect of coinfection on the degree of hyponatremia in children with respiratory tract infections; we newly found that coinfection was more frequent in children with hyponatremia than in those without it. Although one study showed no gender difference in serum sodium levels at admission 25 , in our large cohort, males were more prone than females to develop hyponatremia. Wrotek et al. 24 reported that children aged > 4 years with both pneumonia and hyponatremia had higher WBC counts than those without hyponatremia, and we found that the age at admission was significantly higher in children with hyponatremia. Several studies using small cohorts have suggested that the degree of hyponatremia is inversely associated with the length of hospitalization, and we confirmed that finding in our large cohort. Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate, using multiple logistic regression analyses, that among children hospitalized with various respiratory tract infections, an older age, being male, coinfection, and increased CRP levels are independent risk factors for the development of hyponatremia.",

Recent randomized controlled studies and meta analyses have shown that isotonic intravenous fluids reduce the risk of hyponatremia without causing hypernatremia, compared to hypotonic intravenous fluids 27, 28 . However, no previous studies have specifically investigated the development of hyponatremia after the use of isotonic vs. hypotonic fluids in children with respiratory tract infections; this subject thus requires further study.",

Furthermore, the two prospective prevalence studies by Guppy et al. 4, 33 were on children with moderate to severe pneumonia and no clinical signs of dehydration. Therefore, doctors need to evaluate the clinical status of children with respiratory tract infections, such as oral intake, urine output, and signs of dehydration, before selecting appropriate maintenance intravenous fluids. Nevertheless, because isotonic intravenous fluids are more compatible for correcting dehydration and its related ADH secretion, we recommend the use of isotonic fluids at admission, and the infusion rate can be adjusted according to the status of the patients.",
