            "text": "The archaeal exosome is a phosphorolytic 3 -5 exoribonuclease complex. In a reverse reaction it synthesizes A-rich RNA tails. Its RNA-binding cap comprises the eukaryotic orthologs Rrp4 and Csl4, and an archaea-specific subunit annotated as DnaG. In Sulfolobus solfataricus DnaG and Rrp4 but not Csl4 show preference for poly(rA). Archaeal DnaG contains N-and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of unknown function flanking a TOPRIM domain. We found that the NT and TOPRIM domains have comparable, high conservation in all archaea, while the CTD conservation correlates with the presence of exosome. We show that the NTD is a novel RNA-binding domain with poly(rA)-preference cooperating with the TOPRIM domain in binding of RNA. Consistently, a fusion protein containing full-length Csl4 and NTD of DnaG led to enhanced degradation of A-rich RNA by the exosome. We also found that DnaG strongly binds native and in vitro transcribed rRNA and enables its polynucleotidylation by the exosome. Furthermore, rRNA-derived transcripts with heteropolymeric tails were degraded faster by the exosome than their non-tailed variants. Based on our data, we propose that archaeal DnaG is an RNA-binding protein, which, in the context of the exosome, is involved in targeting of stable RNA for degradation.",

            "text": "The RNA degrading exosome is a protein complex found in eukarya and archaea (1) (2) (3) . It is composed of a structurally conserved nine-subunit core, which also shows similarities to bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), and contains additional subunits (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . The nine-subunit core of the eukaryotic exosome is essential but catalytically inactive and additional eukarya-specific subunits are responsi-ble for the ribonucleolytic activity (9) (10) (11) . In contrast, the archaeal nine-subunit exosome is a 3 -5 -exoribonuclease like PNPase (4, 8) and strongly interacts with a protein annotated as DnaG (3, 8, 12, 13) . The archaeal exosome and bacterial PNPase have not only structural but also functional similarities --they degrade RNA phosphorolytically using inorganic phosphate and producing rNDPs, and in a reverse reaction they synthesize heteropolymeric RNA tails (8, (14) (15) (16) . It was suggested that the heteropolymeric RNA tails found in prokaryotes destabilize RNA enabling efficient binding of 3 -5 exoribonucleases including PNPase or exosome (15, 17) . Such destabilization mechanism is known for short poly(A)-tails synthesized by poly(A)-polymerase in enterobacteria (18, 19) and by non-canonical poly(A)polymerases in eukaryotes, where the polyadenylation of rRNA precursors is a prerequisite for their degradation by the eukaryotic exosome (20, 21) .",

Its annotation is based on its central topoisomerase/primase (TOPRIM) domain (25, 26) and nothing is known about the function of its N-terminal and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD, respectively, Figure 1A) . The archaeal nine-subunit exosome is formed by orthologs of the eukaryotic exosomal subunits Rrp41, Rrp42, Rrp4 and Csl4. The RNase PH-domain containing subunits Rrp41 and Rrp42 are arranged in a catalytically active hexamer, on the top of which a trimeric cap composed of the RNA-binding proteins Rrp4 and Csl4 is bound ( Figure 1B ; 4, 5, [22] [23] [24] . The RNA-binding cap increases the efficiency of degradation of poly(A) and heteropolymeric RNA by the recombinant archaeal exosome (8, (27) (28) (29) (30) . While in vivo the exosome contains both Rrp4 and Csl4 (31) , in vitro complexes with homotrimeric, Rrp4 or Csl4 containing caps (Rrp4 exosome or Csl4 exosome) can be reconstituted ( Figure 1B ; 5, 8) .

On the other hand, DnaG is ubiquitous in all genome-sequenced archaea, while the exosome is missing in Methanococci, Halobacteria and some Methanomicrobia (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S1 ; ref. 2, 15, 34) . The high conservation of DnaG in archaea can be explained by the assumption that it plays an important role in RNA metabolism even in the absence of exosome, and/or by its putative role as a primase, in accordance to its annotation and recent biochemical data (35, 36) . The primase synthesizes de novo short RNA primers during chromosome replication. (37) . Archaea possess a two-subunit primase PriS/PriL of eukaryotic type, which was characterized in vitro (38, 39) . This primase shows strong interactions with components of the archaeal replication network in pulldown assays with Thermococcus kodakarensis cell-free extracts, while the putative bacterial-type primase DnaG interacts with the exosome instead (13) . However, it was published that DnaG of S. solfataricus exhibits primase activity in vitro, and this activity is decreased by mutations of conserved residues in the TOPRIM domain. Furthermore, an interaction was detected between S. solfataricus DnaG and the archaeal minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase in yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro pull-down assays. Based on this, it was suggested that archaeal DnaG may have a dual function in the cell, as a part of the exosome and as a bacterial-type primase (35, 36) .",

Assuming that a primase needs a DNA-binding domain while a protein important for RNA metabolism should possess an RNA-binding domain, we decided to characterize the NTD and CTD of S. solfataricus DnaG. We found that the NTD is a conserved archaeal RNA-binding domain cooperating with the TOPRIM domain in binding of RNA substrates, while the CTD is important for the binding to the exosome. Furthermore, we show that in vitro the exosome needs DnaG for post-transcriptional tailing of native rRNA, and that heteropolymeric tails enhance the degradation of rRNA transcripts. Our data strongly suggest that DnaG is a conserved archaeal RNA-binding protein, which participates in the degradation of stable RNAs in S. solfataricus.",

DnaG-K6AY7A, DnaG-K6A and DnaG-Y7A genes were generated by standard overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (42) and cloned into pET15b vector using NcoI and NdeI restriction sites. Overlap extension PCR was also used for the fusion of DNA encoding the N-terminal 156 amino acid residues of DnaG to the 3 -end of the Csl4 gene. The PCR product was cloned into pET15b vector using NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. Both constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-Goldenplus (DE3). Cells producing DnaG-K6AY7A, DnaG-K6A or DnaG-Y7A were sonicated in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM \u2424-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol. The cell-free extract was heated at 75 \u2022 C for 20 min and the soluble protein was purified through HiTrap HP Q and HiLoad R 26/60 Superdex R 200 PG columns. DnaG-NT was purified using the same lysis buffer, heat treatment and Ni-NTA resin. Cells producing the fusion protein Csl4-DnaG named Csl4-NT were sonicated in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) and 1 M NaCl. After incubation at 75 \u2022 C for 20 min, the soluble protein was purified using Ni-NTA resin.",

To learn more about the evolution of the archaeal DnaG proteins, we created a phylogentic tree based on the sequences of DnaG proteins from 39 representative archaeal species ( Figure 2 ) and compared this tree to the 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic tree of 120 genome-sequenced archaea (Supplementary Figure  S1 ). Both trees are congruent in the delineation of the phyla Euryarchaeota, Crenarchaeota, Nanoarchaota, Korarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota. Interestingly, the absence of exosome leads to major differences in the DnaG subtree of Euryarchaeota, which comprise exosome-containing and exosome-less representatives, when compared to the 16S rRNA tree. An informative example are Methanomicrobia. In the DnaG tree, exosome-less Methanomicrobia form a well-delineated cluster together with the exosome-less Halobacteria, while exosome-containing Methanomicrobia cluster together with Archaeoglobi and other exosomecontaining archaea ( Figure 2 ). This is in contrast to the 16S rRNA tree, where Methanomicrobia and Halobacteria are in a cluster well separated from Archaeoglobi and other Euryarchaeota (Supplementary Figure S1) . Methanococci, which accordingly to the 16S rRNA tree are distantly related to Methanomicrobia and Halobacteria, also do not have an exosome. This may explain other differences between the DnaG-and 16S rRNA-based subtrees of Euryarchaeota (compare Figure 2 to Supplementary Figure S1 ).",

We found that the conservation of the NTD of DnaG is very high and is comparable to that of the TOPRIM domain. The CTD is less conserved and the conservation is even lower in exosome-less archaea. Additional alignments were performed with 14 DnaG sequences from exosome-less archaea only (Supplementary Figure S2 ) and with 16 DnaG sequences from exosome-containing archaea only (Supplementary Figure S3 ). These alignments confirmed the highly conserved nature of the NTD and the TOPRIM domain, and the lower conservation of the CTD, especially in exosome-less archaea. Three invariant residues were found in the CTD of exosome-less archaea, but it should be taken into account that in this case only sequences from Euryarchaeota were compared (Supplementary Figure S2) . These residues are also present in DnaG from the exosomecontaining Euryarchaeota and the Crenarchaeon S. solfataricus shown in Figure 3 . In the last 100 aa of the CTD of exosome-containing archaea belonging to all five archaeal phyla, an invariant aspartate residue (D329 in S. solfataricus) and a cluster of conserved residues (F360 to D367 in S. solfataricus) were detected. This cluster is present in all analyzed exosome-containing species but Nanoarchaeum equitans (Supplementary Figure S3) . The data suggest that in exosome-containing archaea with exception of N. equitans, the CTD of DnaG is involved in the interaction with the exosome.",

Since both truncated DnaG variants have the same length like Rrp41, it was necessary to discriminate them from His 6 -Rrp41 by western blot analysis with DnaG-specific serum. Figure 4B shows that both truncated His 6 -tagged DnaG variants but not His 6 -Rrp41 were detected using the DnaG- specific serum.

            "text": "The results of the phylogenetic analysis and the multiple alignments strongly suggest that the NTD of archaeal DnaG has a highly conserved physiological role. Since DnaG from S. solfataricus binds poly(rA) 30 (33) , we assumed that the NTD may be involved in binding of RNA. This assumption was strengthened by the similarities between the NTD of archaeal DnaG and other proteins interacting with RNA found by Phyre2 (Supplementary Table S2, Figure 3 ). There are several invariant amino acid residues in the NTD of archaeal DnaG, among them are the Lys(K) 6 fore we decided to generate a K6AY7A mutant of DnaG and to test its RNA binding activity by EMSA. The nontagged, mutated protein was purified and analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy in comparison to the recombinant, wild-type DnaG, which carries a His 6 -tag at the Cterminus. No disorder of the secondary structure was detected ( Figure 5A and B), allowing us to conclude that the mutated protein is suitable for our analyses. EMSA assays were performed with the recombinant, wild-type DnaG-His 6 , the K6AY7A mutant and the previously published E175Q mutant of DnaG, which is impaired in the primase activity. As an RNA substrate, poly(rA) 30 , which is easily shifted by DnaG in EMSA was used (33) . For comparison, labeled poly(dA) 30 was used as a DNA substrate. We found that under the applied conditions, poly(dA) 30 was not bound, while as expected, poly(rA) was strongly bound by wild-type DnaG (compare lane 2 to 6 in Figure 5C ). Furthermore, the RNA binding activity of the TOPRIM domain mutant DnaG-E175Q was weaker when compared to wild-type DnaG and RNA binding by the NTD mutant DnaG-K6AY7A was completely abolished (lanes 6 to 8 in Figure 5C ). Single mutants DnaG-K6A and DnaG-Y7A were also prepared. They showed very low RNA binding activities (Supplementary Figure S4A and B) .",

First it was necessary to verify that the DnaG-K6AY7A mutant protein still interacts with the exosome. For this a cell-free lysate of the E. coli strain producing the DnaG-K6AY7A protein was mixed with reconstituted Strep-Csl4 exosome and purification of Strep-Csl4 containing complexes was performed with Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads. Csl4 was detected in the elution fraction together with His 6 -Rrp41, His 6 -Rrp42 and DnaG-K6AY7A ( Figure  7A , lane 11). In the control experiment without addition of exosome DnaG-K6AY7A was not present in the elution fraction ( Figure 7A, lanes 2 to 6) .

Thus we assumed that in exosome-containing archaea rRNA is also a substrate of the exosome. This assumption is supported by the detection of heteropolymeric A-rich tails, which are most probably synthesized by the exosome, at the 3 -end of 16S rRNA and its fragments in S. solfataricus and Methanopyrus kandleri (15, 34) . However, in a previous study a transcript corresponding to the 3 -end of 16S rRNA (3 16S rRNA) was not degraded nor polyadenylated in vitro by the hexameric Rrp41/Rrp42 ring, the Rrp4 exosome and Csl4 exosome of S. solfataricus (30) . To test whether DnaG influences the interaction of the exosome with the 3 16S rRNA transcript, we performed degradation and polyadenylation tests using the Csl4 exosome with or without DnaG. Interestingly, DnaG enabled polyadenylation of this substrate by the exosome. Even after 15 min of incubation in the presence of rADP, the 3 16S rRNA substrate was not polyadenylated by the Csl4 exosome (lanes 1 to 3 in Figure 8A ), while after 10 min of incubation with the DnaG-containing Csl4 exosome, the majority of the substrate was prolonged (lanes 4 to 6 in Figure 8A ). In contrast DnaG did not enable degradation of the 3 16S rRNA transcript by the exosome (Supplementary Figure S6) .",

Less substrate was polyadenylated by the DnaG-E175Q containing exosome (lanes 7 to 9 in Figure 8A ) and the DnaG-K6AY7A containing exosome did not polyadenylate at all (lanes 10 to 12 in Figure 8A ). This suggests that binding of the 3 16S rRNA transcript by DnaG is necessary for its polyadenylation by the exosome. To test directly whether DnaG binds this transcript, EMSA analyses were performed ( Figure 8B ). The transcript was completely shifted by the wild-type DnaG and the exosome containing wild-type DnaG, while no comparable shift was observed when the DnaG-K6AY7A protein was used, alone or in the context of the exosome. When DnaG-E175Q was used, the RNA shift was weaker than with the wild-type DnaG, resembling the results obtained with poly(rA) 30 (compare Figures 5C-8B) .",

In accordance with this, the native 5S rRNA was strongly shifted by DnaG alone or in combination with the Csl4 exosome in EMSA assays, while no shift was observed when the mutant protein DnaG-K6AY7A was used, and a very weak shift was observed with the Csl4 exosome alone ( Figure 8D ).

We noticed that although similar amounts of substrate and enzyme were used in the assays shown in Figure 8C and E, the in vitro transcript was polyadenylated with higher efficiency than the native 5S rRNA.

The sequence of the heteropolymeric tail corresponds to a tail sequence previously detected in S. solfataricus (15) .

Furthermore, considering degradation products shorter than 3 16S rRNA, we found that both tailed transcripts are degraded faster than the non-tailed one and that both tails equally enhance the degradation ( Figure 9A and B) .

However, our analysis also shows that the presence or absence of exosome had an influence on the evolution of DnaG in Archaea. Previously archaeal DnaG sequences were used for phylogenetic analysis of methanogenic consortia leading to very similar results when compared to 16S rRNA-based analysis (49) . Probably this was due to the phylogenetic homogeneity of the studied archaeal group, in which no differences in respect of the exosome content are expected. We found substantial differences in the subtree of Euryarchaeota comprising archaea with and without exosome. Thus, despite its high conservation, archaeal DnaG is not suitable as a phylogenetic marker.",

Not only DnaG-CT but also DnaG-NT is impaired in its interaction with the Csl4-exosome (compare Figures 4D-7A) . Thus, the integrity of DnaG is important for a strong binding to the exosome. Most probably the conformation of the CTD is changed in the truncated DnaG-NT protein preventing efficient binding to the protein complex. Alternatively or in addition, each domain may contribute to the interaction with the exosome. It is known that the TOPRIM domain of the RecR protein from E. coli is responsible for the interaction with other protein partners and with DNA (50) .

The experiments with the chimeric Csl4-NT protein revealed that the NTD of DnaG is a separate RNA bind-ing domain with poly(A)-preference, which can exert this function in the context of different proteins ( Figure 6 ). We also show that the NTD is needed for strong binding of 5S rRNA and rRNA-derived transcripts ( Figure 8B and D) . Thus, despite its poly(A)-preference, this protein domain is a general RNA-binding domain necessary for interaction of archaeal DnaG with heteropolymeric substrates. Interestingly, we found that the TOPRIM domain is also involved in the interaction of DnaG with RNA. Notably, the conserved residue E175 in the TOPRIM domain, which is crucial for the primase activity of the protein (35) , is important for strong RNA binding by DnaG (Figures 5 and 8) . These results strongly suggest that the NTD and TOPRIM domains cooperate in binding of RNA substrates. Cooperation of multiple RNA binding domains, each with a weak affinity for RNA, is known to result in a strong RNA binding by other proteins involved in RNA metabolism like Lin28, a major regulator in mammalian cells, and the eukaryotic mRNA export factor Tip-associated protein; Tip is a tyrosine kinase-interacting protein (TAP) (51) . The TOPRIM domain is characteristic for bacterial type primases, topoisomerases, OLD family nucleases and RecR proteins, altogether proteins involved in interactions with DNA (26) . However, archaeal DnaG is not the only protein with a TOPRIM domain which binds RNA. A prominent exam-ple is ribonuclease (RNase) M5 from Bacillus subtilis, in which a TOPRIM domain contains the active site. Both the TOPRIM and the CTD of RNase M5 are important for binding of RNA (52) .",

Therefore we propose that in archaea harboring exosome DnaG not only participates in the efficient interaction of A-rich RNA with the exosome (33), but is also responsible for the polynucleotidylation of rRNA. It is assumed that the heteropolymeric, A-rich RNA tails in exosome-containing archaea have destabilizing function (15, 17) like the short poly(A) tails in enterobacteria and eukarya (18, 19, 53, 54) . Our data, showing that a heteropolymeric tail leads to faster degradation of rRNA transcripts by the exosome in vitro, are in agreement with this assumption. The destabilizing effect of the heteropolymeric tail was comparable to the effect of a poly(A) tail of the same length ( Figure 9B) . Similarly, both a heteropolymeric tail and a poly(A) tail equally enhanced the degradation of structured RNA by the bacterial degradosome in vitro (54) . Analyses of the nucleotide composition of bacterial and archaeal heteropolymeric RNA tails suggested that the tails do not have potential to form strong secondary structures (32, 55) . Together, these data support the view that prokaryotic, heteropolymeric tails function as single stranded regions enabling fast initial interaction of RNA substrates with 3 -5 exoribonuceases. Although in vivo data demonstrating the destabilizing role of heteropolymeric tails in prokaryotes are still missing (55), we suggest that DnaG plays an important role in degradation of rRNA in exosome-containing archaea. This suggestion is based on the data shown in Figures 8 and 9 . Degradation of rRNA in the course of the quality control during ribosome biogenesis or as adaptation to changing environmental conditions is of pivotal importance for the cell (18, 20, 56) .",

This can be explained by the failure of some in vitro transcripts to adopt the native rRNA structure. Additionally, missing RNA modifications can lead to lower stability RNA structures (57) and this can lead to higher accessibility of the 3 -end of the transcript for tailing by the exosome. Furthermore T7 polymerase adds a non-templated nucleotide at the 3 -end of in vitro transcripts (58) , which may facilitate addition of poly(A) by the DnaG containing exosome. We also observed that the 5S rRNA transcript is polyadenylated much faster by the DnaG/Csl4 exosome than the DnaG/Csl4/Rrp4 exosome (compare Figure 8E , lane 6, to Figure 8F, lane 3) . Most probably this is due to the lower amount of DnaG in the Rrp4 containing exosome ( Figure 1B) ). In vivo exosomal complexes with different stoichiometric amounts of Rrp4 and DnaG/Csl4 are present (31) . Probably archaeal exosomes of different compositions exhibit different functions, and it is possible that the exosomal complexes with higher relative amounts of DnaG are responsible for tailing of stable RNA.",

            "text": "Our results characterizing S. solfataricus DnaG as an RNA binding subunit of the archaeal exosome do not necessarily exclude a function of DnaG as a primase in the cell (35, 36) . It is possible that archaeal DnaG is a moonlighting protein like some other proteins with more than one function in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (59) . However there are several reasons to believe that it is rather involved in RNA metabolism than in replication (60, 61) . The strong in vivo interaction with the exosome in several archaea was already mentioned in the introduction (8, 12, 13, 31) . In vitro this interaction leads to a clear and strong effect of DnaG on the polynucleotidylation of native rRNA and rRNAderived transcripts by the exosome (Figure 8 ). In comparison, the documented interaction between S. solfataricus DnaG and the MCM helicase is weak (36) . Importantly, this interaction does not influence the priming activity of DnaG and specifically inhibits the helicase activity of MCM (36) . This is in contrast to the enhanced helicase activity of DnaB and the priming activity of DnaG upon interaction between bacterial DnaG and DnaB (62) (63) (64) . Additionally, the Phyre2 analysis of the NTD and CTD domains of DnaG from the exosome-containing S. solfataricus and the exosome-less M. jannaschii revealed similarities between archaeal DnaG and bacterial and eukaryotic proteins involved in RNA metabolism (Supplementary Table  S2 ), but no connection to the archaeal replication network was found. Together with the high, exosome-independent conservation of the NTD in archaea, the strong affinity of this NTD for RNA but not DNA, and the involvement of the TOPRIM domain in RNA binding, this implicates that DnaG functions as an RNA binding protein even in archaea lacking an exosome. In exosome-less archaea DnaG may play a role in the process of RNA degradation together with archaeal homologs of the bacterial RNases R and J, or of the eukaryotic cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (34, (65) (66) (67) (68) . According to our data, DnaG is most probably involved in tailing and degradation of stable RNAs in exosome-containing archaea.",
