Here we showed that Oblongifolin M (OM), an active compound isolated from Garcinia oblongifolia , potently inhibited EV71 infection in a dose dependent manner. To identify its potential effectors in the host cells, we successfully identifi ed 18 proteins from 52 differentially expressed spots by comparative proteomics studies. Further studies showed that knockdown of ERp57 inhibited viral replication through downregulating viral IRES (internal ribosome entry site) activities, whereas ectopic expression of ERp57 increased IRES activity and partly rescued the inhibitory effects of OM on viral replication. We demonstrated that OM is an effective antiviral agent; and that ERp57 is one of its cellular effectors against EV71 infection.",

In severe cases, especially those among in infants and children, EV71 infection causes severe neurological complications such as aseptic meningitis, brain stem encephalitis, pulmonary edema, poliomyelitislike paralysis and eventual death. In the last decade, the continuous outbreaks of EV71 in Asia-Pacifi c region have caused considerable deaths [ 3 ] .

As shown in Figure 1A , the RD cells without viral infection were fl at with spindle-like sharps and attached well on the surface of culture dishes. When cells were infected with EV71 at a multiple of infection (MOI) of 1, many cells showed CPE. They became round, detached from the surface of culture dishes and fl oated away 12 hours post-infection (p.i.) ( Figure 1B ). When the cells were pretreated with 15 \u03bcM of OM 4 hours prior to EV71 infection, most cells were healthy with only a few exhibiting CPE ( Figure 1C ), an indication that the infected cells were signifi cantly protected from CPE. Surprisingly, almost all EV71infected cells were healthy when pretreated with 30 \u03bcM of OM ( Figure 1D ). Similar results were also obtained from HEK 293 cells and Hela cells (data not shown). The reduction of EV71-induced CPE by 50% (IC 50 ) was determined byusing GraphPad Prism5. As shown in Table  1 , the IC 50 of OM was 2.38\u00b10.79 \u03bcM. Cell viability was employed to determine the toxicity of OM in RD cells by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-Htetrazolium bromide) assays after treating RD cells with OM for 24h. Compared with untreated cells, cell viability was not obviously affected by OM at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM. The CC 50 (concentration of OM required for 50% cell kill) of the uninfected cells was 83.87\u00b11.12 \u03bcM. The selectivity of OM on RD cells was 35.24 ( Table 1 ) , indicating OM's potential to be an effective antiviral agent against EV71 infection. . E. OM inhibited EV71 reproduction. The virions in the culture supernatant were harvested 12 hours p.i. and the viral titer was determined by TCID 50 assays. F. OM inhibited EV71 replication. 12 hous p.i., the intracellular RNA was isolated, and viral genomic RNA (primers targeting VP1 gene) and cellular mRNA of GAPDH genes were quantitated by qRT-PCR. The viral genomic RNA level was normalized with the copy number of mRNA of GAPHD. The mean value of VP1/GAPDH ratio was set as 1 in control. G. The viral VP1 protein was decreased by OM in a dose dependent manner. The cells were harvested 12 hours p.i. at MOI of 1, and cell lysate was applied for Western blot assays.",

            "text": "Host proteins are ideal targets for antiviral drug development because targeting host proteins would avoid or delay the occurrence of drug resistance due to fast mutagenesis of viruses. ERp57, a chaperon protein involved in catalyzing bisulfate bond exchange for correct protein folding in ER stress, has been shown a crucial role in the entry of DNA virus SV40 [ 28 ] . Besides virus entry, it is possible that ERp57 may exhibit other functions in the life cycle of other viruses. As an RNA virus, EV71 has a life cycle that is completely different from that of SV40. An important question is whether ERp57 exhibits a similar function in the life cycle of EV71. To address this question, we fi rst investigated if the viral entry of EV71 would be affected by knockdown of ERp57. To our surprise, the depletion of ERp57 did not affect virus entry into the host cells ( Figure 4C ). Interestingly, we found that the virus replication was signifi cantly suppressed at 3 to 5 hours p.i. after ERp57 knockdown in the host RD cells ( Figure 4D ) . Accordingly, the secreted virions evidently decreased at 5 to 7 hours p.i. ( Figure 4E ). In our previous study, we have shown that EV71 undergoes the fast replication phase from 3 to 6 hours p.i. in RD cells, and carries out fast package from 6 to 9 hours p.i. (package phase) and secretion initiation [ 30 ] . Our results suggested that ERp57 involves mainly in the early phase of viral life cycle.",

            "text": "The fi rst event of viral activity is IRES-mediated translation in generating proteins required for viral RNA replication after uncoating of virus in the host cells. We hypothesized that ERp57 may affect viral translation through regulating viral IRES activities. Our results showed that knockdown of ERp57 signifi cantly reduced the viral IRES activities ( Figure 5B ). Intriguingly, OM also suppressed the IRES activity in a dose dependent manner ( Figure 5C ), demonstrating a correlation between drug effects and ERp57 functions. To further validate our fi ndings, we conducted gain-of-function studies. ERp57 was ectopically expressed in host cells to test its effects on IRES activity. As expected, results from this study exhibited an increase of IRES activity by ectopic ERp57 expression ( Figure 6A ). This suggests that OM may affect ERp57 functions in an indirect or direct manner. We have noted that ectopic expression of ERp57 partly rescued the inhibition of early replication of EV71 ( Figure 6B ), indicating that in addition to ERp57, there must be other host factors contributing to the inhibitory effects of OM on EV71 reproduction. As shown in Table  II , 10 proteins were down-regulated and 8 proteins were upregulated by OM. Whether these proteins contribute to the viral inhibition of OM should be investigated in future studies. Although several other compounds isolated from Garcinia oblongifolia (e.g., Oblongifolia L or P) share similar structure to OM, it antiviral effects against EV71 was much weaker (data not shown). Further investigating the underling mechanism may help us to develop OM derivatives with more potent anti-EV71 activity.",
