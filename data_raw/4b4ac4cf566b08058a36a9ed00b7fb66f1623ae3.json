            "text": "Since its first report in the Middle East in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has become a global concern due to the high morbidity and mortality of individuals infected with the virus. Although the majority of MERS-CoV cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, the overall risk in areas outside the Middle East remains significant as inside Saudi Arabia. Additional pandemics of MERS-CoV are expected, and thus novel tools and reagents for therapy and diagnosis are urgently needed. Here, we used phage display to develop novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target MERS-CoV. A human Fab phage display library was panned against the S2 subunit of the MERS-CoV spike protein (MERS-S2P), yielding three unique Fabs (S2A3, S2A6, and S2D5). The Fabs had moderate apparent affinities (Half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 = 123-421 nM) for MERS-S2P, showed no cross-reactivity to spike proteins from other CoVs, and were non-aggregating and thermostable (T m = 61.5-80.4 \u2022 C). Reformatting the Fabs into IgGs (Immunoglobulin Gs) greatly increased their apparent affinities (K D = 0.17-1.2 nM), presumably due to the effects of avidity. These apparent affinities were notably higher than that of a previously reported anti-MERS-CoV S2 reference mAb (K D = 8.7 nM). Furthermore, two of the three mAbs (S2A3 and S2D5) bound only MERS-CoV (Erasmus Medical Center (EMC)) and not other CoVs, reflecting their high binding specificity. However, the mAbs lacked MERS-CoV neutralizing activity. Given their high affinity, specificity, and desirable stabilities, we anticipate that these anti-MERS-CoV mAbs would be suitable reagents for developing antibody-based diagnostics in laboratory or hospital settings for point-of-care testing. Antibodies 2019, 8, 42 2 of 16 was initiated in South Korea in 2015 and outbreaks still sporadically occur in various regions, including the Middle East [1,2]",

MERS-CoV is an enveloped RNA virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that encodes structural proteins including the spike (S) protein and the nucleocapsid protein (NP) [4] . Like all coronaviruses, the S protein, present on the surface of the MERS-CoV virion, plays a critical role in the viral entry into host cells [5, 6] . The S protein consists of two non-covalently associated subunits, S1 and S2, and trimerizes to form a prefusion spike [7] [8] [9] . Upon entry of the virus into cells, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit recognizes the host cell receptors dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) or CD26 [10-12], while the S2 subunit has a role in viral fusion with host cell membranes through the interplay of two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) and a transmembrane domain on the S2 subunit [6, 13] .",

Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are rapidly emerging as an alternative approach complementing vaccines against viral infections [14] . Due to its critical role in the interaction with host cell receptors, tremendous efforts have been focused on the discovery of neutralizing mAbs against the RBD of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit [15] [16] [17] [18] . Strategies have included phage or yeast display library selection; immunization of animals, such as humanized mice and dromedary camels; and antibody isolation from human survivors of MERS-CoV infection. However, a drawback of the mAbs is their costly and time-consuming production in mammalian cell lines. Moreover, viruses can easily evolve to generate RBD variants with mutations that avoid immune responses [19, 20] . However, such mutations are less common in the S2 subunit, which makes it an attractive target for therapeutic purposes. Indeed, the first MERS-CoV S2 subunit (MERS-S2P)-targeting antibody, called G4, was generated using mouse immunization and was demonstrated to recognize a variable loop in the S2 connector domain and to neutralize infection by the virus [13, 21] .",

Therefore, the importance of developing reliable diagnostic tests is rapidly becoming clear to manage and control a viral spread. Indeed, various diagnostic tests have been developed since the first description of the virus. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR), accompanied with viral RNA sequencing, is the primary method used to detect viral infection, although there are obvious limitations of this test such as a long turnaround time [1, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Serological tests relying on antibodies specific to viral antigens, such as the NP, can also be used by either capturing viral antigens through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatographic tests (ICTs) [28] [29] [30] or by detecting anti-MERS-CoV antibodies through ELISA, indirect fluorescence antibody assay (IFA), Western blotting, and neutralization assays [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] .",

Briefly describing the MERS-S2P production, MERS-S2P (amino acids 752-1288 amino acids), tagged with C-terminal 6\u00d7 His, was expressed in insect Sf9 cells by using a recombinant baculovirus (AB vector, San Diego, CA, USA) and was purified using HisTrap HP Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) and HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography (GE Healthcare). Briefly, to perform panning, t MERS-S2P was immobilized in immunotubes (Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA) at a concentration of 10 \u00b5g/mL in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) at 4 \u2022 C for 18 h. After rinsing twice with tap water, the immunotubes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature (RT). At the same time, the phage library was incubated in 2% skim milk in PBS for 1 h at RT. Blocked phages were transferred to the immunotubes coated with MERS-S2P and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C before washing three times with PBS-T (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) . Bound phages were eluted from immunotubes with 100 mM triethylamine for 10 min at RT, followed by neutralization with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Neutralized eluted phages were transferred to mid-log-phase Escherichia coli (E. coli) TG1 cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C with gentle rotation (120 rpm). The infected TG1 cells were spread on 2\u00d7 YT agar plates supplemented with 2% glucose and 100 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin, and incubated overnight at 37 \u2022 C. The colonies were collected via scraping with 6 mL of 2\u00d7 YT medium. A total of 50 mL of 2\u00d7 YT supplemented with 2% glucose and 100 \u00b5g/mL ampicillin were inoculated with the scraped cells to yield an OD 600 , the optical density at 600 nm, of 0.05 to 0.1 and incubated at 37 \u2022 C with shaking (220 rpm) until the OD 600 reached 0.5. Then, the culture was infected with VCSM13 helper phage, a derivative of M13KO7 helper phage (provided by Dr. Hong from Kangwon National University, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do, Republic of Korea) at a multiplicity of infection of 20:1. After incubation for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C with gentle rotation (120 rpm), kanamycin was added to a final concentration of 70 \u00b5g/mL and the culture was grown overnight at 30 \u2022 C with shaking (220 rpm). Cells were then centrifuged at 24,793\u00d7 g for 30 min and the supernatant was passed through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter. Phage particles were precipitated using one-fifth of the volume of the precipitation buffer (20% Polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 15% NaCl) for 30 min on ice. The precipitated phages were pelleted using centrifugation at 24,793\u00d7 g for 30 min and resuspended in PBS. The phage suspension was used for the next round of panning. For stringent selections, the number of washing steps was gradually increased and the amount of antigen for immobilization was decreased: first round-10 \u00b5g/mL, second round-5 \u00b5g/mL, and third round-2.5 \u00b5g/mL in PBS (1 mL).",

This suggests that its abnormal retention time on the size-exclusion chromatography seems not due to the degradation of S2A6 (Fab) protein leading to smaller fragments but rather due to its aggregating, sticky nature.

However, S2A6 (Fab) were eluted much later on size-exclusion chromatography compared to the two Fabs (S2A3 and S2D5) ( Figure S2 ), although S2A6 (Fab) showed similar migration behavior as the two Fabs on the SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 2A ). This suggests that its abnormal retention time on the size-exclusion chromatography seems not due to the degradation of S2A6 (Fab) protein leading to smaller fragments but rather due to its aggregating, sticky nature. The melting temperatures (T m , \u2022 C) of the Fab proteins were measured using a protein thermal shift (PTS) assay. The results showed that S2A3 (Fab) was the least stable with a T m of 61.5 \u2022 C, while S2A6 (Fab) and S2D5 (Fab) had higher T m values (80.4 \u2022 C and 78.2 \u2022 C, respectively) ( Figure 2C and Table 1 ). The apparent affinities of the Fabs for MERS-S2P were assessed using ELISA (EC 50 , nM). The Fabs had moderate affinities for the S2 subunit (123 nM, 252 nM, and 421 nM for S2A3 (Fab), S2A6 (Fab), and S2D5 (Fab), respectively) ( Figure 2D and Table 1 ).",

To address this, we performed a \"proof of concept\" study based on a sandwich immunoassay using the ACCEL ELISA\u2122 system, a rapid and sensitive ELISA system developed by Plexense Inc. (Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea). S2A3 (IgG) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-MERS-CoV IgG were used as antigen capture and detection reagents, respectively ( Figure 5A) . First, three different concentrations of S2A3 (IgG) (3 \u03bcg/mL, 5 \u03bcg/mL, and 10 \u03bcg/mL) were employed to determine which one provided the best linearity or \"goodness of fit\" in the sandwich ACCEL ELISA\u2122. As shown in Figure 5B , the best linearity (R 2 = 0.9962) was obtained when S2A3 (IgG) was immobilized at a concentration of 5 \u03bcg/mL ( Figure 5B ). Under this condition, the limit of detection (LOD) of MERS-S2P detectable in the ELISA was calculated to be 0.33 ng/mL (\u22485 fmol/mL) ( Figure 5B ), suggesting that S2A3 (IgG) can be applied to To determine whether S2A3 (IgG) and S2D5 (IgG) were free of aggregates, they were analyzed using size-exclusion chromatography ( Figure 4B ). S2D5 (IgG) did not form any aggregates, while S2A3 (IgG) contained \u22485.7% high molecular weight aggregates ( Figure 4B ). Next, to demonstrate whether the IgG antibodies were produced in an intact form, S2A3 (IgG) and S2D5 (IgG) were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with and without PNGase F treatment. The results confirmed that all of the observed masses were within 15 Da of the theoretical masses of the intact IgGs, indicating that the IgG antibodies were produced with very few modifications ( Figure S3 and Table S2 ). The apparent binding affinities (K D , M) of S2A3 (IgG) and S2D5 (IgG) for MERS-S2P were determined using the Biacore T200.

To address this, we performed a \"proof of concept\" study based on a sandwich immunoassay using the ACCEL ELISA\u2122 system, a rapid and sensitive ELISA system developed by Plexense Inc. (Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea). S2A3 (IgG) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-MERS-CoV IgG were used as antigen capture and detection reagents, respectively ( Figure 5A) . First, three different concentrations of S2A3 (IgG) (3 \u00b5g/mL, 5 \u00b5g/mL, and 10 \u00b5g/mL) were employed to determine which one provided the best linearity or \"goodness of fit\" in the sandwich ACCEL ELISA\u2122. As shown in Figure 5B , the best linearity (R 2 = 0.9962) was obtained when S2A3 (IgG) was immobilized at a concentration of 5 \u00b5g/mL ( Figure 5B ). Under this condition, the limit of detection (LOD) of MERS-S2P detectable in the ELISA was calculated to be 0.33 ng/mL (\u22485 fmol/mL) ( Figure 5B ), suggesting that S2A3 (IgG) can be applied to the ACCEL ELISA\u2122 as a capture reagent to diagnose MERS-CoV infection through the detection of MERS-S2P.

Thus, these antibodies represent valuable additional S2 subunit-targeting mAbs and it should be interesting to reveal where they bind on the S2 subunit through a structural study, which is currently ongoing.",

            "text": "Based on the sub-nM apparent affinity of S2A3 (IgG) and its specificity to MERS-CoV, we tried to develop an anti-MERS-S2P-based antibody capture ELISA for the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. Once again, this is the first ELISA-based assay employing an anti-MERS-S2P mAb. The ELISA was tested using ACCEL ELISA\u2122 (Plexense Inc.), which is a rapid and sensitive ELISA system in which each well of the ELISA plate is stacked with layers such that the surface area of the well is increased. This results in higher ELISA signals because more protein is immobilized on the surface, and also enables faster development (<20 min) with a smaller amount of reagents (\u224815 \u00b5L) due to the effects of stacking. Indeed, our proof of concept study with S2A3 (IgG), MERS-S2P and rabbit polyclonal anti-MERS-CoV IgGs demonstrated a detection limit of 0.33 ng/mL (\u22485 fmol/mL). Previously, we have tested S2D5 (Fab) to determine the feasibility of using this mAb on a paper-based analytical device (PAD) designed to capture MERS-S2P. We observed that the mAb worked effectively on the PAD and the detection limit for MERS-S2P was approximately 10.4 nM (\u2248160 fmol/mL) [41] . Due to the lack of MERS-S2P-based detection assays that are comparable with ours, it is not possible to evaluate our results directly. However, it is still possible to compare our results indirectly with those obtained from detection assays performed using nucleocapsid protein (NP) through an antigen capture ELISA-based method or an immunochromatographic test (ICT) [28, 30] . Similar to SARS-CoV, the NP protein is preferable as a target to the S protein in MERS, simply due to the presence of a higher copy number of the NP protein than the S protein [30] . According to the previous NP-based studies, a recombinant NP capture ELISA-based method showed detection limits of 0.625 ng/mL (\u224813.6 fmol/mL) and of 5 ng/mL (\u2248108.7 fmol/mL) using an ICT [30] , while another capture ELISA yielded a detection limit of 1 ng/mL (\u224821.7 fmol/mL) [28] . This highlights the fact that our MERS-S2P-based ACCEL ELISA\u2122 system performed better than previously developed methods, even though the target protein is different. Studies are currently underway to demonstrate whether the MERS-S2P-based ACCEL ELISA\u2122 can feasibly detect virions in anti-MERS-CoV serum, and if so, to identify the detection limit in TCID 50 /mL (TCID 50 , 50% tissue culture infective dose). This should provide a direct comparison with the NP capture ELISA-based assays. It would also be interesting to perform an ACCEL ELISA\u2122 with anti-NP mAbs to compare their performance in a more quantitative way.",

            "text": "The MERS-S2P-based ACCEL ELISA\u2122 assay also could be applied to detect anti-MERS-S2P IgGs from anti-viral serum samples of MERS-CoV-infected people. A drawback of this strategy is that, in general, antibodies against the virus appear within 10 days of the onset of illness; therefore, antibodies might fall behind the detection of viral genomic material using molecular methods such as RT-PCR [42] . Thus, the MERS-S2P-based ACCEL ELISA\u2122 assay should be performed in combination with molecular methods, thereby detecting the viral genome as the front line of the diagnosis, such that viral infection can be diagnosed by molecular methods using lower respiratory tract samples where the viral load is high. Later, or in case these methods fail to detect viral genomes in the respiratory samples, the MERS-S2P-based ELISA assay, alone or possibly in combination with an NP-based antigen capture assay, can be applied to confirm and diagnose viral infection. Another point to address in this strategy is that since our anti-MERS-S2P mAbs are human antibodies, they should be dehumanized to avoid false positives due to their binding to the secondary anti-human antibodies before they are applied in the assay. Given the high titers of antibodies against MERS-CoV in over 95% of adult dromedaries, the immediate reservoir for the MERS-CoV transmission to humans, namely the Middle East [43] [44] [45] , the present MERS-S2P-based antibody capture ELISA may be potentially useful for detecting MERS-CoV in dromedary animal samples. It may also be useful for screening other animal samples for MERS-CoV as long as secondary antibodies detecting the animal-derived anti-MERS-S2P antibodies are available.",

We characterized the resulting Fabs and IgGs to observe their high affinity to MERS-S2P, high specificity to MERS-CoV, and desirable biophysical properties. These properties warrant further development. We tested S2A3 (IgG), a MERS-S2P mAb, in ACCEL ELISA\u2122 to develop the first MERS-S2P-based antibody capture assay. The detection limit of this assay surpassed that of previously developed NP-based antigen capture assays. Further refinement of the test should warrant the development of a rapid, sensitive detection kit for a point of care test.",
