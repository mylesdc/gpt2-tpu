            "text": "Infant mortality from viral infection remains a major global health concern: viruses causing acute infections in immunologically mature hosts often follow a more severe course in early life, with prolonged or persistent viral replication. Similarly, the WE strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-WE) causes acute self-limiting infection in adult mice but follows a protracted course in infant animals, in which LCMV-specific CD8 + T cells fail to expand and control infection. By disrupting type I IFNs signaling in adult mice or providing IFN-\u03b1 supplementation to infant mice, we show here that the impaired early life T cell responses and viral control result from limited early type I IFN responses. We postulated that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), which have been identified as one major source of immediate-early IFN-I, may not exert adult-like function in vivo in the early life microenvironment. We tested this hypothesis by studying pDC functions in vivo during LCMV infection and identified a coordinated downregulation of infant pDC maturation, activation and function: despite an adult-like in vitro activation capacity of infant pDCs, the expression of the E2-2 pDC master regulator (and of critical downstream antiviral genes such as MyD88, TLR7/ TLR9, NF-\u03baB, IRF7 and IRF8) is downregulated in vivo at baseline and during LCMV infection. A similar pattern was observed in response to ssRNA polyU, a model ligand of the TLR7 viral sensor. This suggests that the limited T cellmediated defense against early life viral infections is largely attributable to / regulated by infant pDC responses and provides incentives for novel strategies to supplement or stimulate immediate-early IFN-\u03b1 responses.",

Indeed, these viral infections run a more severe and prolonged course in infants [1, 2] in whom CD8 + T cells only appear at time of recovery and convalescence [3, 4] . This has long been thought to result from the incapacity of the neonatal immune system to raise protective T cell responses as a result of its programming for neonatal tolerance induction [5] . However, recent work has suggested that innate immune responses are distinctly regulated in early and adult life, the vulnerability to pathogens resulting from the need to avoid eliciting harmful inflammatory, alloreactive and autoimmune responses at a vulnerable period of life [6, 7] . Identifying the molecular and cellular bases of the immune regulation of early life immune responses, and strategies to safely improve defense against pathogens, is thus of considerable interest.",

LCMV is strictly non-cytolytic and runs an acute, chronic or persistent course of infection dependent upon the host immune responses. In immunocompetent adult mice, low doses of the LCMV-WE strain are rapidly cleared. Conditions where T cell responses are impaired (including in utero or within 24h of birth) avoid immunopathological reactions but result in chronic asymptomatic infections [8] . In 2-week-old infant mice, whose stage of immune maturation is no more neonatal nor yet adult-like, LCMV-WE follows a protracted course characterized by several weeks of viral replication eventually terminated by the onset of neutralizing antibodies [9] . We previously documented that the protracted LCMV infection of 2-week-old mice correlates with their failure to mount the adult-like antiviral CD8 + T cell responses required for rapid LCMV clearance [9] .",

            "text": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play pleiotropic roles in viral infections. By producing type I IFNs (IFNs \u03b1 and \u03b2, IFN-I) within hours of TLR-mediated signaling, they promote the apoptosis of infected cells, activate NK cells and protect conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and macrophages -thus rapidly controlling viral loads [10] [11] [12] [13] . IFN-I promote the expansion of CD4 + T cells through direct and indirect (APCmediated) effects [14, 15] and participate in the induction CD8 + T cell responses [16] . They may substitute for CD4 + T cell help [17, 18] by allowing CD8 + T cells to escape from TRAILmediated apoptosis [19, 20] , thus supporting their expansion. We thus postulated that pDCs may not exert adult-like function in vivo in the early life microenvironment despite their in vitro activation [21] [22] [23] . We tested this hypothesis by studying pDC functions in vivo during LCMV infection. We demonstrate here that pDC activation is indeed downregulated in response to LCMV infection and model TLR7 ligands. This prevents the immediate-early burst of IFN-I required for early viral control and subsequent CD8 + T cell expansion, thereby setting the stage for protracted courses of viral infections.",

IFN-I rapidly restrict viral replication and play a critical role in controlling LCMV infection [24] .

In 2-week-old mice, IFN\u03b1 remained significantly lower at 24h, transiently reached adult levels at 48h but returned to baseline levels earlier than in adult mice ( Figure 1 C and D).

On day 10, splenic LCMV titers had already declined to very low levels in adult WT mice. In contrast, they persisted at similarly high titers in adult and infant IFNAR -/-as in WT infant mice. Slightly lower but statistically similar titers were observed in adult and infant IFNAR -/-mice (Figure 2 A), suggesting a main role of IFN-I signaling in the shaping of the infant viral pattern. In accordance with the role of IFN-I on T cell clonal expansion [26] , this viral pattern was mirrored by the frequencies of IFN-\u03b3-producing LCMV-specific CD8 + T cells which were similarly reduced in 2-week-old WT, 2-week-old IFNAR -/-and adult IFNAR -/-mice on day 10 (Figure 2 B) . CD4 + T cell responses showed a comparable deficit (Figure 2 C) . Thus, the limited early life IFN-\u03b1 responses were associated to a similar pattern of impaired viral control / limited T cell responses as in adult (and infant) IFNAR -/-mice.",

The upregulation of IFN-\u03b1 transcription was also lower in infant than in adult cDCs (fold increase 6.9 \u00b1 1.1 and 18.5 \u00b1 2.8 respectively, p = 0.0079) but much less impressive than in infant and adult pDCs (fold increases: 5810 \u00b1 1525 and 19220 \u00b1 3640 respectively; p = 0.0038), indicating that the early life limitation of IFN-\u03b1 expression may involve other cell types.

The E protein E2-2 directly activates multiple transcription factors involved in pDC development and function [34, 35] . Its quantification identified a significantly reduced expression of E2-2 in early life pDCs during LCMV infection (Figure 4 B) . The IRF-8 transcription factor (which is directly activated by E2-2 in pDCs) was only weakly expressed in infant compared to adult pDCs (Figure 4 B) . Thus, the constitutive expression and in vivo activation of critical pDC genes controlled by E2-2 were specifically downregulated in early life pDCs. This likely prevents the generation of an immediateearly burst of IFN-I, impairs the initial control of LCMV and limits T cell expansion, resulting into a protracted infection.",

PolyU effectively activated adult pDCs and induced high levels of serum IFN-\u03b1 as previously described [36] . However, neither IFN-\u03b1 production nor pDC activation was detected in infant mice ( Figure 5 A and B) showing that infant pDC limitations are not specific to LCMV. The observation of a profound limitation of pDC activation, expansion and function in early life was in striking contradiction to the current consensus that neonatal murine pDCs have an adult-like capacity of producing IFN-I [37] . This common notion is based on normal pDC in vitro responses to PolyI:C [21] , CpG-ODN or HSV-1 [22, 23] . This was confirmed here, as PolyU in vitro stimulated infant pDCs expressed even higher IFN-\u03b1 levels than adult pDCs (Figure 5 C) and at least adult levels of E2-2, IRF-7, MyD88, NF-\u03baB, TLR7 and TLR9 mRNAs (Figure 5 D) . Adultlike infant pDC responses were also elicited in vitro by imiquimod (TLR7 ligand, infant pDCs: 150 \u00b1 106 pg/ml of IFN\u03b1; adult pDCs: 139 \u00b1 91 pg/ml) and CpG-A (TLR9 ligand, infant pDCs: 997 \u00b1 6 pg/ml of IFN-\u03b1; adult pDCs: 750 \u00b1 42 pg/ml). These discrepancies between adult-like in vitro and limited in vivo infant pDC responses raise the possibility that specific regulatory networks may be at play in the infant microenvironment.",

            "text": "The need to avoid harmful inflammatory, alloreactive and autoimmune responses at a vulnerable period of life may explain the existence of distinct immune regulatory networks in early life. However, such benefits may be offset by the failure to overcome microbial challenge in early life. To obtain direct evidence of the critical contribution of IFN-I for early life infection control, we asked whether supplementing recombinant IFN-\u03b1 early after infection would restore viral control. In a first series of experiments, 10'000U of recombinant murine IFN-\u03b1, was injected 4h, 8h and 12h after infection. Despite the short half-life (2.1 hours) of murine IFN-\u03b1 this significantly reduced splenic LCMV-WE titers on day 2 ( Figure  6A ). To prolong the availability of recombinant IFN-\u03b1 and assess its influence on T cell responses and viral control, we next added 1\u03bcg of long-acting (estimated half-life of 15h) pegylated human IFN-\u03b1 2a [38] at 6h post-infection. IFN-\u03b1 supplementation significantly increased the frequency of LCMVnp118-126-specific CD8 + T cells (Figure 6 B) and of IFN\u03b3-producing LCMV-specific CD8 + T cells (data not shown), which approached or reached adult frequencies. Multifunctional CD4 + T cell responses were also restored to adult frequencies in IFN-\u03b1-treated 2-week-old infected mice (Figure 6 C) . Accordingly, day 12 LCMV titers were significantly lower in IFN\u03b1-supplemented infant mice (Figure 6 D) . Thus, supplementing IFN-\u03b1 early after LCMV-WE infection significantly improved early (day 2) and late (day 12) viral control and restored CD4 + and CD8 + early life T cell responses. This confirms the critical role of the lack of immediate-early IFN-\u03b1 burst in the shaping of CD8 + and CD4 + T cell responses and in the protracted fate of LCMV-WE infection in early life.",

Last, IFN-\u03b1 supplementation supported early viral control, in accordance with its impact on HSV-1 in neonates [23, 48] . Remarkably, IFN-\u03b1 supplementation also restored the induction/expansion of adult-like CD4 + /CD8 + responses, suggesting that its influence was not only mediated by a direct antiviral effect. Indeed, IFN-\u03b1 injection restores CD8 + T cell responses in IRF7 -/-mice in which the early high viral load is a critical factor impairing CD8 + T cell responses to acute LCMV [49] . All these findings suggest that the limited immediate-early production of IFN-I by infant mice is insufficient to control early viral replication. Remarkably, the viral and immunological impacts of a transient delay in IFN-\u03b1 release in infant mice were as severe as those resulting from the total absence of IFN-\u03b1 signaling (Figure 2 and [50] ). This may reflect the subsequent influence of higher levels of LCMV NP, which inhibit IFN-I production by infected cells [51] and thus terminate IFN-I responses, as serum IFN-I titers declined faster in infant mice. Thus, IFN-\u03b1 is required before the peak of viral replication, a pattern successfully elicited by adult but not by infant LCMV-WE infected mice.",

Next, pDCs were rapidly activated by LCMV-WE infection in adult but not in 2-week-old mice, in which activation markers were undetectable 24h after infection-in accordance with the ageassociated IFN-\u03b1 response patterns.

            "text": "What may affect the in vivo IFN-I responses of infant pDCs? Their bone marrow development is not delayed and neonatal splenic pDCs are even more abundant than cDCs [21, 22, 37] . Flt3L and IFN-\u03b1 supplementation increase their number, indicating the integrity of this developmental axis [23, 48, 55] . Thus, the postnatal maturation of pDCs is controlled by agerelated regulatory mechanisms downstream of their BM production. The uniquely rapid IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 response of adult pDCs has been ascribed to their capacity to retain TLR ligands in their endosome, to detect RNA and DNA viruses through the TLR7 and TLR9 endosomal sensors, i.e. without being infected [53] , and to express high basal levels of IRF-7, the master regulator of MyD88-mediated IFN-I responses (review in [56] ). All these critical molecules were downregulated in infant murine pDCs, both constitutively and during the course of LCMV-WE infection. This dampened early life pDC activation pattern correlated with an E2-2-orchestrated process limiting pDC Function in Early Life Infections PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org both IFN-I and NF-\u03baB-mediated IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 responses. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that the expression of the E2-2 pDC regulator [34, 35, 57] may be modulated by a physiological process (age) -and the factors controlling the expression of E2-2 are yet unknown. The formal demonstration of a causal role for E2-2 would require forcing its expression in early life pDCs. However, the limited expression of E2-2 by infant pDCs appears as an attractive hypothesis for the observed down-regulation of TLR7/9, IRF-7, IRF-8 and IFN-I. Whether E2-2 also regulates the nuclear translocation of IRF-7 is unknown, and additional regulatory factors may contribute to the regulation of infant pDC activation. The TLR7 pathway was recently demonstrated as critical for the immediate-early production of IFN-I by pDCs [31] . We show here that a \"natural\" TLR7 ligand (PolyU) was similarly unable to elicit potent early life pDC responses in vivo. As neonatal murine pDCs do respond with adult-like IFN-I titers when exposed in vitro to TLR7/8 ligands such as Imiquimod or PolyU, immunoregulatory networks likely limit their activation in vivo. Neonatal B cells can produce high levels of IL-10 in response to TLR9 ligation, countering the production of proinflammatory cytokines by neonatal pDCs [58] . However, IL-10 was not secreted by infant B cells harvested up to 20h after LCMV-WE infection (data not shown), suggesting immunoregulatory influences independent of IL-10 producing B cells. Further studies should thus focus on the influence of the microenvironment on pDC activation to possibly identify yet undefined immune regulatory pathways in early life.",

            "text": "Numerous studies have reported the reduced in vitro responses of human cord blood pDCs to TLR7 or TLR9 ligands [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] , suggesting the existence of intrinsic pDC limitations persisting until at least 6-12 months of age [68] . Functionally, an inverse correlation was reported between circulating pDC numbers and the clinical severity of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children [71] . Interestingly, a recent study noted that the blunted in vitro responses of cord blood pDCs had been observed with whole blood or enriched ( < 50% pure) pDC populations and showed that >99% pure cord blood pDCs do raise adult-like IFN-\u03b1 responses to TLR7 or TLR9 stimuli [72] . Thus, neonatal human pDCs are intrinsically able to generate adult-like type-I IFN responses in vitro but are influenced by exogenous factors, as observed in mice. Our observations extend on previous findings by demonstrating that such immunoregulatory factors may be sufficiently potent in vivo to impair viral control and T cell immunity. As pDCs are involved in inflammatory responses which may be detrimental to the neonatal brain and IFN-I contributes to increasing the risks of autoimmunity [73] , it is biologically plausible that the slow onset of pDC activation and IFN-I responses has beneficial effects. The downregulation of early life in vivo pDC responses to TLR7 ligands identified in this report may thus have been evolutionary driven by immunological safety considerations. Although we show here that novel strategies to supplement or stimulate immediateearly IFN-\u03b1 responses, i.e. through adjuvantation, may exert potent protective effects through a sustained impact on CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses, this will thus require a careful d emonstration of their immune safety.",

LCMV infection indeed significantly increased the expression of IRF-7 in both adult and infant pDCs but constitutive and post-infection levels remained significantly lower in infant pDCs (Figure 3 C, lower panel). Furthermore, IRF-7 was less efficiently translocated into the nucleus of infant pDCs (Figure 3 D and E). Thus, the lack of an immediate-early burst of IFN-\u03b1 in LCMV-infected infant mice correlated with limited pDC activation, IRF-7 expression and nuclear translocation.",
