Because the role of swine RNase L (sRNase L) is not fully understood, in this study, we generated a sRNase L knockout PK-15 (KO-PK) cell line through the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to evaluate the function of sRNase L. After transfection with CRISPR-Cas9 followed by selection using puromycin, sRNase L knockout in PK-15 cells was further validated by agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA sequencing, and Western blotting. The sRNase L KO-PK cells failed to trigger RNA degradation and induced less apoptosis than the parental PK-15 cells after transfected with poly (I: C). Furthermore, the levels of ISGs mRNA in sRNase L KO-PK cells were higher than those in the parental PK-15 cells after treated with poly (I: C). Finally, both wild type and attenuated pseudorabies viruses (PRV) replicated more efficiently in sRNase L KO-PK cells than the parental PK-15 cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that sRNase L has multiple biological functions including cellular single-stranded RNA degradation, induction of apoptosis, downregulation of transcript levels of ISGs, and antiviral activity against PRV. The sRNase L KO-PK cell line will be a valuable tool for studying functions of sRNase L as well as for producing PRV attenuated vaccine.",

The type I IFNs bind to cells expressing IFN-/ receptor (IFNAR) 1 and IFNAR2 and subsequently activate Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2). The signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 heterodimerize upon JAK1/Tyk2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and further recruit IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) in the cytoplasm to form a transcriptional activator complex, interferonstimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3). ISGF3 then translocates into the nucleus and sequence-specifically binds to an IFNstimulated response element (ISRE), which boosts the transcription of a number of type I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to initiate the antiviral state. These ISGs include myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1), double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), 2' ,5'oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), and so on [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

The presence of double strand RNA (dsRNA) activates OAS, which in return initiates the synthesis of short oligonucleotides, 2' ,5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5A) that act as second messengers to activate the latent cellular RNase L [10] . RNase L is an endoribonuclease with a ubiquitous expression in all mammalian animals and it contains three major domains: an N-terminal regulatory ankyrin repeat domain (ARD), a protein kinase (PK)-like domain, and a C-terminal ribonuclease domain (RNASE) [6] . Active RNase L destroys both viral and cellular RNAs (mRNA and rRNA) within the cells [7, 8] . The degradation of 28S and 18S rRNA is associated with suppressed viral proteins synthesis [9] . In addition, activation of RNase L induces apoptosis in virus-infected cells through the mitochondrial pathway to limit viral spread [11] . Antiviral effects of RNase L have been extensively illustrated in RNA viruses, while its roles in counteracting DNA viruses have been rarely studied.",

Moreover, this cell line has been extensively employed to develop and prepare swine vaccines, such as CSFV C strain and chimeric PCV2 vaccine [17] [18] [19] . To study the antiviral role of RNase L, in this study, we engineered and constructed a sRNase L knockout-(KO-) PK cell line by taking the advantage of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system. sRNase L KO-PK cells attenuated cellular RNA degradation and inhibited poly (I: C)-induced apoptosis. In addition, the mRNA expression of ISGs in sRNase L KO-PK cells was higher than the wild type. Finally, sRNase L KO-PK cells were more susceptible to PRV in comparison with the parental PK-15 cells. Taken together, our results demonstrated the antiviral activities of sRNase L against PRV infection and suggested the potential benefits of using sRNase L KO-PK cells for vaccine development.",

Relative PRV DNA levels were also analyzed by real-time PCR ( Figures  5(b) and 5(d)). PRV SD1404 or Bartha-K61 vaccine strain replicated more efficiently in sRNase L KO-PK cells than parental PK-15 cells (P < 0.05).

The titers of PRV SD1404 or Bartha-K61 vaccine strain in sRNase L KO-PK cells were significantly higher than those in PK-15 cells at 36 h and 48 h after infection (P < 0.05).

The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system facilitates the studies on the biological function of cellular proteins due to its convenience to construct gene knockout cell lines. In this study, we developed a sRNase L KO-PK cell line by deleting sRNase L gene using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system, and determined antiviral role of sRNase L. We used poly (I: C) to induce the activation of sRNase L through OAS/RNase L pathway [27] . Active sRNase L manipulates virus replication through cleaving cellular and viral RNA [28] and inducing cell apoptosis [29] . In this study, rRNA was degraded in parental PK-15 cells but not in sRNase L KO-PK cells ( Figure 2 ). Since the host cellular organelles such as ribosomes are indispensable for the synthesis of viral protein and thereafter the viral replication, it is plausible that sRNase L-induced rRNA degradation suppresses virus replication. In addition, sRNase L expression had been associated with the activation of apoptosis signaling which led to cellular damage and as a result inhibited viral replication. Being consistent with previous reports [29] , we also showed significantly increased number of apoptotic PK-15 cells compared to sRNase L KO-PK cells following poly (I: C) stimulation ( Figure 3) .",

Recent studies have indicated several mechanisms of RNase L-mediated antiviral activity. For instance, RNase L cleaves hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome into 200-500 bp fragments at UU and UA dinucleotides [41] . Filamin A, a multifunctional actinbinding protein, interacts and cooperates with RNase L to block virus entry [42] . The current study demonstrated that sRNase L expression inhibited PRV replication in PK-15 cells ( Figure 5 ). Attenuated PRV vaccines, in particular the PRV Bartha-K61 strain, have been widely used by swine industry to control pseudorabies [14] . In this study, sRNase L KO-PK cells showed increased replication of PRV Bartha-K61 vaccine strain than parental PK-15 cells (Figures 5(c) , and 5(d) and Table 2 ). Hence, the attenuated antiviral activity in sRNase L KO-PK cells makes it a useful cell line to grow viruses.
