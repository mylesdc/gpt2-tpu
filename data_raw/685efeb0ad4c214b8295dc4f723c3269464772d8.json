Complete sequences of the ten dsRNA genome segments of the virus, tentatively named Mahlapitsi virus (MAHLV), were determined. Phylogenetic analysis places this virus into a distinct clade with Baboon orthoreovirus, Bush viper reovirus and the bat-associated Broome virus. All genome segments of MAHLV contain a 5' terminal sequence (5'-GGUCA) that is unique to all currently described viruses of the genus. The smallest genome segment is bicistronic encoding for a 14 kDa protein similar to p14 membrane fusion protein of Bush viper reovirus and an 18 kDa protein similar to p16 non-structural protein of Baboon orthoreovirus. This is the first report on isolation of an orthoreovirus from an arthropod host associated with bats, and phylogenetic and sequence data suggests that MAHLV constitutes a new species within the Orthoreovirus genus.",

The likelihood of possible transmission of these pathogens to humans is ever increasing as a result of human encroachment on animal habitats, climate change and change of human behaviour. Pathogens of particular public health importance are filoviruses [1, 2] , coronaviruses [3, 4] , paramyxoviruses [5, 6] and lyssaviruses [7, 8] . Other viruses, without a known human disease link, have also been detected recently [9] [10] [11] . Some human pathogens, such as Rift Valley fever virus, that have been detected in bats were likely a result of coincidental infection and do not constitute proof that bats play a role as reservoirs [12] .",

A second and third blind passage was performed for all samples by inoculating and incubating monolayers as described above with 200 \u00b5L of undiluted supernatant from the preceding passage. Supernatants were collected from all wells displaying CPE after three blind passages, a 1/10 dilution prepared in EMEM, and 1 mL of this used to inoculate a 25 cm 2 tissue culture flask. If the same CPE was noted in the sub-cultured 25 cm 2 flask, a 1/100 dilution of this supernatant was prepared and used to inoculate a 75 cm 2 tissue culture flask for preparation of stock virus.",

An unbiased next-generation sequencing approach using SISPA amplification confirmed the presence of a novel Orthoreovirus. Initial sequencing results of both isolates yielded enough sequence coverage to identify all 10 segments. A polyetheleneglycol (PEG) precipitated preparation of isolate 06-24 yielded the most viral specific reads and formed 11 contigs aligning to Othoreoviruses using BLASTn and BLASTx. Both the 5' and 3' ends were missing for all the segments, so to obtain complete genomes for each isolate, rRNA depletion and a combination of SISPA and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (SISPA-RACE) was done. Read numbers were also increased by running samples on an Illumina Nextseq 500. Both an increase in the percentage of viral reads aligning to the genome segments and an increase in coverage of the ends were observed. Presence of MAHLV in the original homogenates from which the isolates were obtained was confirmed by SISPA amplification and NGS directly from the homogenates. Expectedly, only a low number of reads from both homogenates mapped to the MAHLV sequence due to the high amount of host sequence obscuring viral specific sequences combined with likely low viral load in the homogenates and the relatively low sensitivity of the SISPA method.",

The deduced Sigma A protein of MAHLV (segment S1) contains the fusogenic orthoreovirus-wide conserved arginine amino acid at position 273. The S4 segment is bicistronic and encodes for a 14 kDa protein similar to p14 membrane fusion protein of Bush viper reovirus and a non-overlapping 18 kDa protein similar to p16 non-structural protein of Baboon orthoreovirus without a known function ( Table 4 ).

The most notable viruses in which natural transmission from bats have been implicated include filoviruses, coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, herpesviruses, lyssaviruses and bunyaviruses. The implication of bats in transmission or maintenance of some of these viruses is very circumstantial and often based only on serological evidence. More convincing evidence for others is based on detection of viral nucleic acid and isolation of live virus, although this does not conclusively prove that a vertebrate host is a reservoir. Finding pathogens in bats leads to the questions of how they are transmitted between bats, and from bats to incidental hosts such as humans. One possible transmission mechanism could be bat-associated hematophagous arthropods, such as the bat flies, but migration of parasites between bats is not well understood and would require further entomological investigation to better understand [13] .",

The two isolates are not identical but similar enough to suggest that they are merely two isolates of the same virus. This suggests that there are multiple variants of the virus present in the host population. Members of a species within the Orthoreovirus genus are usually identified by a number of characteristics: amino acid and nucleotide sequence identity, organization of the polycistronic genome segment and host species [19] . For conserved core proteins, an amino acid identity >85% for homologous proteins indicates that two viruses belong to the same species, while identity <65% indicates a possible new species. When comparing the amino acid sequence of more divergent outer capsid proteins, >55% identity indicates one species and <35% indicates different species. Nucleic acid sequence identity of homologous segments of >75% indicates the same species and <60% a new species. The nature of conserved genome segment termini sequences of orthoreoviruses is also useful for virus classification [45] . The divergence of MAHLV sequence from other known orthoreoviruses combined with a unique conserved 5' genome segment end and a unique host species, suggests that this is a new virus species in this genus. Along with Broome virus and Baboon orthoreovirus, MAHLV is the third orthoreovirus that lacks an identified cell attachment protein in the S4 segment. This unique characteristic further strengthens the phylogenetic classification which places these viruses in a separate clade and suggests that entry of these viruses into cells is mediated differently than for other orthoreoviruses.",

It is important to note, also, that this was after blind passage and cell culture adaptation (CPE noted after two-three blind passages). Any risk of human infection for now, however, is only likely in individuals who come into close contact with wild Egyptian fruit bats and their ectoparasites. Although highly host-dependent, the bat flies have been noted to leave their bat hosts and crawl on bat researchers (personal observation). Respiratory disease has been noted in humans infected with Melaka, Kampar and Nelson bay orthoreovirus, including limited human-to-human transmission [22, 23, 32, 33] .
