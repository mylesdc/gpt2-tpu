Although the search for the natural reservoirs of the ebolaviruses has largely involved serosurveillance of the bat population, there are no validated serological assays to screen bat sera for ebolavirus-specific IgG antibodies. Here, we generate filovirus-specific antisera by prime-boost immunization of groups of captive ERBs with all seven known culturable filoviruses. After validating a system of filovirus-specific indirect ELISAs utilizing infectious-based virus antigens for detection of virus-specific IgG antibodies from bat sera, we assess the level of serological crossreactivity between the virus-specific antisera and heterologous filovirus antigens. This data is then used to generate a filovirus antibody fingerprint that can predict which of the filovirus species in the system is most antigenically similar to the species responsible for past infection. Our filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system will be a critical tool for identifying bat species with high ebolavirus seroprevalence rates to target for longitudinal studies aimed at establishing natural reservoir host-ebolavirus relationships.",

Furthermore, the evidence linking ebolavirus spillover to a particular species of bat is largely circumstantial. For example, the 1976 and 1979 index cases of Sudan virus disease both worked in a cotton factory in Sudan, where a retrospective investigation eight to nine months after the initial outbreak identified a large roof colony of Trevor's free-tailed bats (Mops trevori) directly over the working area of the index case 19 . The putative index case of the 2007 Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Kasa\u00ef-Occidental province of the DRC was said to have purchased bats for consumption following a reported annual migration of hammer-headed bats (Hypsignathus monstrosus) and Franquet's epauletted fruit bats (Epomops franquetti) 20 . Lastly, the presumed index case of the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak that started in Guinea was reported to have played in a tree hollow, where DNA traces of Mops condylurus were later identified 21 .",

            "text": "The majority of research directed towards the identification of the natural reservoir hosts of the ebolaviruses has consisted of cross-sectional surveillance of the sub-Saharan African and Asian bat population for evidence of active and past ebolavirus infection. The predominance of cross-sectional studies can be attributed to the large number of bat species residing within the geographic range of ebolavirus circulation that require investigation, as well as the challenges associated with obtaining diagnostic specimens from a mammal that is difficult to capture due to its elusive nocturnal nature and ability to fly. Collectively, Ebola virus RNA has been detected in three bat species captured in the Republic of the Congo and Gabon (Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franquetti and Myonycteris torquata) 22 and Reston virus RNA has been reportedly detected in four bat species captured in the Philippines (Chaerephon plicatus, Cynopterus brachyotis, Miniopterus australis and Miniopterus schreibersii) 23 . Yet, infectious virus was not isolated from any of these species 22, 23 , indicating that they are either dead-end virus hosts, had cleared virus infection prior to sampling, or that current filovirus isolation techniques lack the sensitivity to recover infectious virus from specimens with low viral loads. Serological reactivity of bat sera with ebolavirus antigens using indirect ELISAs, indirect fluorescent tests, bead-based multiplex assays and/or western blots has been reported in 375 bats representing at least 21 species throughout sub-Saharan Africa and Asia [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . However, interpretation of this data has been exceedingly difficult due to multiple reasons that include: (1) the absence of a panel of positive and negative bat sera for initial serological assay validation and continuing quality control, (2) the use of various uncharacterized recombinant filovirus antigens, and (3) the application of different statistical methods for establishing cutoff values for seropositivity. Nonetheless, ebolavirus serosurveillance offers several distinct advantages compared to surveillance for active virus infection including a longer diagnostic window (i.e., length of time a diagnostic test can detect evidence of infection), no knowledge of virus-tissue tropism and no requirement for destructive sampling.",

Following a 1 hr incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the plates were washed with PBS-T and 100 \u00b5L of a 1:20,000 dilution of goat anti-bat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA, Cat#: A140-118P, Lot#: A140-118P-13) in serum diluent was added to the plates. The manufacturer notes that this antibody reacts specifically with bat IgG and with light chains common to other immunoglobulins. After incubation for 1 hr at 37 \u00b0C, the plates were washed with PBS-T, 100 \u00b5L of the Two-Component ABTS Peroxidase System (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was added, and the plates were allowed to incubate for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. The plates were then read on a microplate spectrophotometer set at 410 nm. The optical density (OD) values of each four-fold serial dilution were visually inspected to ensure linearity. To negate non-specific background reactivity, adjusted OD values were calculated by subtracting the ODs at each four-fold dilution of wells coated with uninfected control antigen lysate from ODs at corresponding wells coated with filovirus antigen lysate. The adjusted sum OD value was determined by summing the adjusted OD values at each four-fold serial dilution. The average adjusted sum OD of duplicate runs was reported. Notably, performing each indirect ELISA (seven filovirus antigen lysates and two dilutions of uninfected control antigen lysate) in duplicate required only 25 \u00b5L of serum.",

Although significant levels of serological IgG cross-reactivity were observed between the prime-boost filovirus-specific antisera and some of the filovirus antigens, when the overall covariance of the seven-individual indirect ELISAs in the system were considered, we were able to predict the filovirus species responsible for past infection 100% of the time using as little as 25 \u03bcL of sera (each serum was tested against each antigen in duplicate). Further evaluation of the performance and predictive ability of our system using seven Marburg virus convalescent serum or whole blood samples collected after primary experimental infection with Marburg virus (or primary experimental infection with Marburg virus plus a \"natural\" boost) confirmed that the system was able to predict the filovirus species most likely responsible for past infection. As expected, the filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system was not able to correctly predict whether past infection was due to Marburg virus or Ravn virus 100% of the time. This finding supports the current classification of Marburg and Ravn viruses into a single virus species, Marburg marburgvirus 2 .",

            "text": "The robustness and discriminatory power of our system results from its underlying components and various control points. We employed infectious-based filovirus antigens, rather than recombinant virus protein antigens, as a strategy to increase both the sensitivity (i.e., ability of the filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system to correctly identify those with past exposure to a filovirus as filovirus IgG antibody positive) and specificity (i.e., ability of the filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system to correctly identify those with no past exposure to a filovirus as filovirus IgG antibody negative) of the system. Although recombinant filovirus antigens can be generated in large quantities and do not require a BSL-4 laboratory for production, the use of single recombinant virus proteins for antibody detection can lead to false negative results if an individual's antibody repertoire is not directed against the particular recombinant virus protein that was employed 23, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Alternatively, false positive serological results can occur when recombinant virus antigens unknowingly share similar epitopes with other virus antigens for which the study population possesses antibodies against 45, 46 . False positive results can also arise from failing to account for non-specific serological reactivity resulting from the presence of non-virus contaminants in an antigen preparation. Here, we negated non-specific serological reactivity to Vero E6 cell components by subtracting the reactivity of wells coated with uninfected antigen lysate from the reactivity of corresponding wells coated with filovirus antigen lysate. While the majority of previously published ebolavirus serosurveys of bats used recombinant filovirus antigens generated in bacterial expression systems, not all of the studies implemented procedures to negate non-specific reactivity between residual bacterial epitopes in the antigen preparation and antibacterial antibodies in bat sera 27, 29 . Like the majority of published ebolavirus serosurveys of bats, we performed serial serum dilutions to assess for linearity and specificity 22, 24, 25, [27] [28] [29] [30] . Most importantly, we included pooled filovirus-specific bat antisera as a positive control and pooled filovirus-na\u00efve bat sera as a negative control in every run to ensure that our filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system continually performed as expected.",

Four out of the 11 previously published ebolavirus serosurveys of bats used Ebola virus antigen only to detect ebolavirus IgG antibodies 22, [24] [25] [26] and another four of these serosurveys used Ebola and Reston antigens only to detect ebolavirus IgG antibodies 23, [27] [28] [29] . Based on the low serological cross-reactivity between Ebola virus antigen and Sudan virus antisera (68.4%) and Reston virus antigen and Sudan virus antisera (57.7%) observed in our study, we predict that the serosurveys using Ebola virus antigen or Ebola and Reston virus antigens only would have missed the opportunity to detect bats previously infected with Sudan virus. Likewise, due to the high level of serological cross reactivity between ebolavirus-specific antisera and heterologous ebolavirus antigen that we observed in our study, it is possible that the serological reactivity of bat sera with Ebola or Reston virus antigens in the previous serosurveys was due to past infection with one of the other known ebolaviruses or an undescribed ebolavirus. Although we successfully used quadratic discriminant analysis to predict which of the filovirus species in the system was most antigenically similar to the species responsible for past infection, only nucleotide sequence data can be used to ascertain infection with a particular filovirus. Furthermore, incrimination of an ebolavirus-natural reservoir host relationship requires consistent detection of both active (RNA and virus isolation from tissues/bodily fluids suggestive of a transmission mechanism) and past infection with a particular ebolavirus through space and time. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ While our filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system enables the robust detection of virus-specific IgG antibodies from bats and was able to predict the filovirus species most likely responsible for past infection, it does have some limitations. First, this system was validated using virus-specific antisera from prime-boosted bats and sera from Table 5 for statistics on the cross-reactivity between each filovirus-specific bat antisera and heterologous filovirus antigen.",

Although all seven of the Marburg virus convalescent whole blood and serum samples collected from ERBs after primary experimental Marburg virus inoculation or following a \"natural\" boost were marburgvirus IgG antibody positive, these samples had markedly lower marburgvirus-specific IgG antibody levels compared to samples collected from the bats in this study that were prime-boosted with one of seven filoviruses. This suggests that the sensitivity of the individual filovirus IgG indirect ELISAs may be lower than what was reported here (90-100%) using filovirus-specific antisera from prime-boosted bats and filovirus na\u00efve bat sera. However, statistical determination of seropositivity cutoff values for the indirect ELISAs were largely driven by the variance surrounding the mean reactivity of the filovirus-na\u00efve sera with each of the virus antigens. It is likely that circulation and long-term maintenance of the ebolaviruses in their natural reservoir hosts leads to multiple virus exposures throughout the lifetime of an individual, resulting in boosting of virus-specific IgG antibody levels. \"Natural\" boosting of virus-specific IgG antibody levels in ERBs that had been previously infected with Marburg virus was observed during a recent experimental transmission study shortly after documenting virus infection and seroconversion in na\u00efve contact bats 36 . Others have reported periodic boosting of rabies virus neutralizing antibody titers in a wild colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) 47 . Second, we used a goat anti-bat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as the secondary antibody in our system. This antibody was generated using www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ sera from ERBs, as well as sera from nine other bat species comprising four chiropteran families (manufacturer product datasheet). While this antibody has been confirmed to react with sera from these 10 chiropteran species and has been used with success to detect IgG antibodies in sera from >27 bat species comprising seven chiropteran families [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] , it is possible that its reactivity with IgG antibodies from divergent bat species might diminish. If this is the case, the concentration of secondary antibody may need to be optimized prior to testing a new species of bat or an alternative secondary antibody may need to be used. Third, our filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system includes seven virus antigens that represent all of the reported culturable filoviruses. Given the recent discoveries of filovirus RNA from divergent bat families in geographically distant locations ( 60 ), we expect that there are a number of undiscovered ebolaviruses that continue to circulate in nature. However, we believe that the genetic diversity of ebolavirus antigens (up to 61.6%) included in our system will allow for the detection of past infection with a novel ebolavirus, and prediction of the ebolavirus species that is most antigenically similar to the species responsible for past infection.",
