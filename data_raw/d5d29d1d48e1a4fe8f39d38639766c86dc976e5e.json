            "text": "Advocates for a One Health approach recognize that global health challenges require multidisciplinary collaborative efforts. While past publications have looked at interdisciplinary competency training for collaboration, few have identified the factors and conditions that enable operational One Health. Through a scoping review of the literature, a multidisciplinary team of researchers analyzed peer-reviewed publications describing multisectoral collaborations around infectious disease-related health events. The review identified 12 factors that support successful One Health collaborations and a coordinated response to health events across three levels: two individual factors (education & training and prior experience & existing relationships), four organizational factors (organizational structures, culture, human resources and, communication), and six network factors (network structures, relationships, leadership, management, available & accessible resources, political environment). The researchers also identified the stage of collaboration during which these factors were most critical, further organizing into starting condition or process-based factors. The research found that publications on multisectoral collaboration for health events do not uniformly report on successes or challenges of collaboration and rarely identify outputs or outcomes of the collaborative process. This paper proposes a common language and framework to enable more uniform reporting, implementation, and evaluation of future One Health collaborations.",

Though loosely defined, a broadly accepted definition of One Health describes it as \"the integrative effort of multiple disciplines working to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment [1] [2] [3] [4] World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE), n.d.; World Health Organization, n.d). A One Health approach recognizes that complex health challenges are beyond the purview of any one sector or discipline working in isolation [5] and that a resilient health workforce must be capable of effective and collaborative prevention and detection of, as well as response to emerging health challenges. A One Health approach, therefore, calls for collaboration across disciplines, sectors, organizations, and national borders in support of increasingly complex health challenges [1] [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

The search included peer-reviewed articles available todate in the U.S. National Library of Medicine's PubMed database that were searched using specified MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms. Although the multidisciplinary research team has extensive experience in One Health, they were not trained in sensitive search strategies [26] . The research team thus elected to work with a University of Minnesota research librarian to develop MeSH terms for this study. Table 1 provides a list of the key terms used to identify articles discussing multisectoral health events and collaborations. To avoid tautology, it was a deliberate decision to not use \"One Health\" as a search term. Instead, drawing upon the researchers' extensive experience in One Health, various terms were used to describe One Health and similar multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral health collaborations. The underlying assumption was that any articles explicitly addressing One Health would be captured using these key terms. This initial MeSH search identified 2,630 non-duplicated articles. This scoping review was an inductive study of the literature and was conducted in order to support more hypothesis driven research for One Health. By design, the authors elected to limit this literature review to the PubMed database at the outset of the study. PubMed is peer-reviewed and peer-led database. Articles are selected and included based on scholarly and quality criteria by literature review committees and are tagged by keyword and by article structure, contributing to more accurate retrieval than other databases (e.g. Google Scholar); accurate retrieval supports the search results are reproducible and reportable, which is critically important for a scoping review of the literature in which it is important for other researchers, no matter their location, to repeat the study. The decision to use one database reflects the exploratory nature of this study and the Author's intent to propose further hypothesis-driven research that may include additional databases. This methodological choice is in line with Arksey and O'Malley (2005) who attest that decisions must be made at the outset of a study to clarify reasons for the coverage of the review in terms of time span and language [26] [p. [23] [24] .",

In the second phase of screening, two further criteria were included to better achieve scoping review objectives. The research team divided into transdisciplinary pairs which included a reviewer from the health sciences and one from the social sciences. Each of the articles that met the initial inclusion criteria were divided among the team members and then independently reviewed according to the modified screening criteria. Articles were included if both reviewers agreed that they met all initial requirements. In instances where the transdisciplinary reviewers did not agree, the articles were brought to a full research team meeting and reviewed jointly until consensus among all researchers was achieved. This same method of collaborative review was used for the second round of screening and resulted in 50 articles for the final analysis.

During the data analysis, certain themes within each category of individual, organizational and network factors emerged as relevant to \"setting the stage\" for effective collaborative processes, while other factors were essential to maintaining the process of collaboration itself. The researchers found that this distinction was critical in our understanding of how successful collaborative processes are initiated. The starting conditions presented in this paper represent the collaborative preparedness and planning necessary to support effective One Health processes. In addition, the process of collaboration allows for the emergence of new ways of collaborating. This symbiotic relationship between starting conditions and process, allows us to view the entire system of collaboration. In this system, starting conditions influence the process of collaboration, and the process itself can lead to improvement of structures and processes that will now inform improved starting conditions. This cyclical and emergent process is inherent in collaboration and must be accounted for when considering evaluation and systems-based improvements. Individual factors. Relevant success factors at the onset of a One Health event include an individual's education and training, as well as prior experience and existing relationships. Many authors identified existing or previous education and training as enabling factors for collaborative success [37, [40] [41] [42] 44, 47, 49, 51] . Formal technical education and training of individual workers prior to a health event was critical to prepare the necessary human resources for response efforts. Authors noted that foundational technical training during an event was often not possible [41, 42] , but that preemptive and collaborative planning did support the development of key relationships, and in some cases, the development of shared protocols used in the response. The absence of formalized training opportunities before an event, both individual technical training and collaborative, were frequently reported as a gap and a challenge to effective One Health response [40] [41] [42] 49] . Shared competencies were suggested as a strategy for standardizing protocols and performance across multiple individuals and organizations [49] . Multiple sources also reported the importance of prior experience in collaborative response efforts and how this established existing relationships to support the work, both formal (i.e. required communication through standard operating procedures) and informal (i.e. loosely structured and based on personal relationships and ongoing professional engagement) [34, 45, 52, 53, 56, 57] . When instituted before a health event occurs, these starting conditions were reported to support a more effective collaboration processes.",

Examples reported include the use of shared training across organizations to additionally support institutional alignment and partnership with community-level organizations to provide training [39, 42, 49] . Many of these trainings were reported to be rigorous and responsive with continuous follow-up to support compliance [31, 45, 58] . Williams et al [45] discussed how ongoing multisectoral disease specific training supported workers to operate within new and existing systems while simultaneously sharpening their technical competence. These training and capacity-building opportunities were reported to provide a platform for better collaboration for outbreak response [49] . However, ad hoc trainings do not replace or diminish the need for foundational technical training, as formalized education and training were reported as a critical starting condition to facilitate quick mobilization in the case of a health event. Our literature review uncovered the role for both strong university-based education and training, and the role that ad hoc or \"just-in-time\" training can play to meet immediate operational needs during process-based response.",

Research suggests that workers need to be trained at an individual level, have defined roles and responsibilities at an organizational level, and need to be able to mobilize their efforts at a network level. At an organizational level, Human resources are made up of individual contributors and also function as collective entities that reflect employees' prior experiences, existing relationships, and the collective institutional knowledge of its members [31, 34, 45, 49] serve to benefit the organizations in which they work. Clear roles and responsibilities were consistently reported [34, 42, 45] , as well as awareness of systems in place to support ongoing engagement, operations and information sharing [31, 45] . Additionally, several authors highlighted the importance of a reflexive workforce, i.e. human resources that were readily available and could be mobilized quickly and efficiently to respond to health event in a rapidly changing context [31, 42, 45, 57] .",

Starting condition factors reported to enable collaboration at the network level included network structures, existing relationships, available resources in the face of a health event, and the political environment in place to support these efforts. Pre-existing network structures were reported to provide a foundation for effective collaborative efforts to occur across participating organizations. Established Multisectoral Coordinating Mechanisms (MCMs), also referred to as One Health platforms or joint task forces, were often reported as key to assisting with collaboration across a network [34, 41, 42, 45, 48, 52, 60, 72] . Organizational and network structures provided operational standards that crossed relational and organizational boundaries at all levels of the system-individual, organizational and network-which supported the development of formal relationships at each level. Analysis suggested that these systems and relationships need to be in place before the health event. MCMs provide a formalized operating foundation in which organizations and individuals could contribute, and formalized roles and responsibilities supported effective human resource mobilization in both organizations and networks [34, 42, 45, 72] . These structures were often supported by formal policies or agreements such as bilateral agreements or Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) [41, 45, 72] . In addition, operating procedures such as the Incident Command System (ICS) also supported effective mobilization of multiple organizations within the MCM [60] . Finally, the importance of formal structures were repeatedly emphasized as a response to \"lessons learned\" during challenging responses. On the contrary, lack of existing structures was reported to prevent efficient multisectoral engagement in the preparedness and response to health events [37, 42, 71] . Several sources indicated that reporting structures and policies at local, regional, national and international levels support continuity of response and effective implementation in response to health events [45, 48, 49, 58, 60, 62, 65, 72, 73] . These reporting structures and policies allowed for information flow between stakeholders, and the coordination of response efforts across a diversity of individuals and organizations participating in preparedness or response efforts [31, 49, 58, 65, 74] .",

Development of formal and informal relationships prior to a health event allowed individuals, organizations and networks to more effectively respond once an emergency arose. The existence of structural agreements in any form such as MCMs, MOUs, shared Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) or bilateral agreements were reported to support the further development of existing relationships to promote ongoing engagement prior to and throughout a health event [55, 74] . Preemptive planning for potential disease threats was reported to strengthen connections and relationships and support multisectoral disease training, sometimes leading to shared protocols [45] . Additionally, the creation of common goals [34, 47] and clearly defined, previously established, roles and responsibilities for individual actors and network partners were reported as necessary in network operations [34, 40, 42, 45, 49, 54] . Cultural awareness and the inclusion of diverse stakeholders from government, nonprofit, and private sectors from the national to community level, was consistently reported as a success factor for collaborative efforts if included from the start [33, 34, 37, 42, 51, 52, 56, 59, 61, 75] .",

Leadership engagement during a health event allowed for the mobilization and needed support for management processes. By utilizing existing structures and decision-making power, leaders and lead agencies can support managers and the process of management across organizations and networks. Emergency response protocols, such as the ICS, were frequently reported as mechanisms to this end, by concretely providing a leadership and management structure to support ongoing multi-organizational response. It was particularly useful for identifying a lead agency and establishing structures for regular meetings and communications. In the process of collaboration, relevant network factors included network leadership, management, and the effective and efficient mobilization of resources for response. For example, strong and engaged network leadership was noted as an important success factor for collaboration. When established prior to a health event, factors reported to support network collaborations included identifying a lead agency [41, 52] , promoting information sharing and joint decision-making across a network [49, 60, 65] , and convening regular multisectoral meetings [53, 58, 60] . In addition, strong leadership was integral for strategic risk communication across the network [45] .",

The MCMs, or the use of ICS, were often cited as important organizing structures for ongoing communication during a health event, supporting meetings, data collection and information sharing [43, 48, 58, 60] , underscoring the importance of starting conditions to support communications. Multiple methods of communication were reported including electronic communications, list-servs, contact lists and regular meetings; in many cases these were supported through existing MCMs [48, 58] Monthly meetings [53, 58, 60] and establishing clear lines of communication [31, 44, 51, 77, 78] were reported as critical. These methods were supported by the use of a variety of methods and platforms such as press briefings, websites, television, newspaper, teleconferencing, listserv, available contact lists, local/ regional/ cross-border meetings and periodic reporting [44, 45, 49, 53, 58, 62, 77] . Additionally, leadership and management processes played a key role in supporting or challenging communication; high-level support, resource allocation, and use of good practices across an organization are foundational for good internal and external communication.",

Awareness included information sharing, education campaigns, jointly coordinated communications and public release of reports with all members of the network and with the public [31, 38, 44, 45, 52, 54, 55, 61, 70] . Engagement of diverse stakeholders before, during, and after the response was reported as essential; these stakeholders included community and local actors, national governments, intergovernmental organizations, and operating partners [45, 49, [51] [52] [53] 75] . To facilitate communication across stakeholder groups, Adams et al. [60] and Butler et al. [70] underscored the importance of transparent joint communications specifically between responders and community leaders for efficient and effective response. Butler et al. [70] further reported the success of joint interviews held with stakeholders to support shared understanding of response needs. Diverse partners, including foreign militaries, were reported to support foundational infrastructure that allowed other international partners to stay involved when supporting a response effort when they would not have been able to serve effectively on their own [39, 71, 79] . Common goals, common interests, and perspective sharing amongst stakeholders were reported to support an effective response to a health event [38, 49, 53] .",

The research team had to negotiate and re-negotiate ways of working, integrate differing points of view and assign roles in ways to leverage expertise but not reinforce bias. Additionally, the researchers had to establish and meet internal standards while also achieving the outward facing objective of finishing the analysis and writing of this article. Finally, as with any transdisciplinary work, language was consistently a problem. The inherent challenge of interdisciplinary work is in how we talk about collaboration and the terminology we use to describe both theory and practice. For the research team, creating clear definitions supported the development of a common language. Differing approaches can be a significant barrier when active collaboration is not structurally supported, valued, and continuously monitored for health and effectiveness. Our efforts reinforce the need for training for those skill sets that fall beyond technical sector-specific training. When grappling with the question of which skills were most important in our collaborative process, we determined that the shared objective of collaboration was the foundation for our ability to integrate the differing expertise that each team member brought to the process. Simply, we took continual action to achieve our combined goal including reading new literature, considering new frameworks, learning new things, and asking many questions. The subsequent challenge is, of course, that there are very few formal opportunities to gain access to training around these competencies and mindsets in One Health teams. Most often, as in our case, it is an ad hoc process that rests on the motivations, shared values, and time available within a team to develop in this way. Our review suggests that, while this approach worked for us, it would not be a time or resource-effective approach within the context of a health emergency. Thus, One Health approaches need to be evaluated to help practitioners decide when and how to most effectively collaborate for their intended purposes.",

Of that subset of articles, only 50 discussed the successes, challenges and lessons learned from operational One Health response to a health event. A majority of the articles focused broadly on the need for collaboration between multiple sectors or disciplines with little attention to what factors enable an effective One Health response effort. The low number of included articles reflects a broader challenge for the One Health community, suggesting the necessity that One Health researchers move beyond discussing the inherent need for One Health, to actually reporting on the processes, outputs and outcomes of their collaborative efforts. As such, no consistent framework or language was found to report on the process, outputs or the outcomes of One Health work in the articles reviewed. In the analysis, the research uncovered 12 factors that supported successful health event response. The researchers were able to make important advances by characterizing these factors as important at the start of collaboration or relevant to the process of collaboration. Using these 12 factors, the researchers propose a One Health reporting framework which when used to report on One Health collaborations, can support the further refinement and identification of success factors for One Health. These factors may serve as the basis for developing evaluation metrics and the iterative improvement of One Health processes around the globe.",
