            "text": "Two key features of recombinant inbred panels are well-characterized genomes and reproducibility. Here we report on the sequenced genomes of six additional Collaborative Cross (CC) strains and on inbreeding progress of 72 CC strains. We have previously reported on the sequences of 69 CC strains that were publicly available, bringing the total of CC strains with whole genome sequence up to 75. The sequencing of these six CC strains updates the efforts toward inbreeding undertaken by the UNC Systems Genetics Core. The timing reflects our competing mandates to release to the public as many CC strains as possible while achieving an acceptable level of inbreeding. The new six strains have a higher than average founder contribution from non-domesticus strains than the previously released CC strains. Five of the six strains also have high residual heterozygosity (.14%), which may be related to non-domesticus founder contributions. Finally, we report on updated estimates on residual heterozygosity across the entire CC population using a novel, simple and cost effective genotyping platform on three mice from each strain. We observe a reduction in residual heterozygosity across all previously released CC strains. We discuss the optimal use of different genetic resources available for the CC population.",

We previously reported on the genome sequence of 69 CC strains (Srivastava et al. 2017 ). We identified a significant reduction in overall genomic contribution from the two strains with non-domesticus subspecific origin, CAST/ EiJ and PWK/PhJ. These observations are consistent with the expectation that genetic incompatibilities between the three mouse subspecies contribute to the large-scale extinction of the CC lines during inbreeding (Shorter et al. 2017) . We also reported on the overrepresentation of the wild-derived strains in regions of residual heterozygosity present within individual CC strains. Residual (i.e., segregating) heterozygosity in the CC refers to regions where more than one founder haplotype at a locus can be found within a single strain.",

In MPPs, sequencing helps to resolve recombination breakpoints between consecutive haplotypes, assign the most likely founder haplotype in identical by descent (IBD) regions, and identify strain specific variants (Srivastava et al. 2017) . However, the sequence of a single individual may provide an incomplete and biased view of an inbred strain, especially when residual heterozygosity remains at relatively high levels. Multiple individuals from a strain need to be analyzed in order to accurately determine the level of residual heterozygosity. The Most Recent Common Ancestors (MRCA/MRCAs) are the best description of residual heterozygosity at the time when a CC strain is released to the public . In most cases, the MRCAs are the complete set of obligate ancestors. In a few cases, the ancestors were not available and additional individuals were added to better capture patterns of residual heterozygosity. As inbreeding has continued during the maintenance and distribution of the CC, residual heterozygosity is expected to decrease. The time elapsed between the MRCAs and the present should be proportional to the reduction in residual heterozygosity.",

The msBWT reports the number of reads containing each 45-base substring in both forward and reverse-complement orientations.

Once missing 45-mer intervals were identified the msBWT was used to extract the flanking non-zero reads at the interval boundaries, and a consensus sequence was constructed for 45 to 60 bases inside of the missing interval.

Importantly, two of the overrepresented founders (CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ) are of non-domesticus origin (Table 1 & 2) .

            "text": "The six new CC strains contribute at least one CAST/EiJ or PWK/PhJ haplotype to 62% and 54% of the genome, respectively. This partially relieves the deficit of these underrepresented haplotypes in the CC population. For example, chromosome 5 contains a locus between 127Mb and 137Mb where currently only one CC strain has a CAST/ EiJ founder haplotype (Figure 1) Figure 1 ). These areas have a decreased non-domesticus haplotype frequency on the periphery of the n highlighted area, suggesting selection is acting against those particular haplotypes in the CC. The eight founder strains of the CC have been sequenced at high depth, their variants annotated, and their genome recently de novo assembled (Keane et al. 2011; Doran et al. 2016; Lilue et al. 2018) . Previous genetic variation analyses have used sequence from these founders to infer haplotype specific genetic variation in the CC (Durrant et al. 2011; Ferris et al. 2013; Gralinski et al. 2015; Oreper et al. 2017) . By directly sequencing CC strains, we can define founder specific variants across multiple CC strains sharing a founder haplotype at each locus, and identify strain specific variation unique to a CC strain. We first compared the sequenced samples' GigaMUGA genotypes and confirmed that they are consistent with the corresponding MRCA. Next, we queried variation within identical founder haplotype regions at any given locus across the CC to identify de novo mutations. We identified four unique de novo deletions larger than 500bp in the newly sequenced mice that are not present in the assembled reference genome of the CC founders or in the previous cohort of 69 sequenced CC mice (Table 3 ). Figure 2 shows a 19.8kb deletion in CC079/TauUnc that is predicted to delete the Gm14515 gene. The breakpoints were resolved using msBWTs to locally assemble sequence flanking the deletion. A PCR assay was designed to discriminate between the presence or absence of this deletion, and the deletion was fixed in both the MRCA and the three CC079/ TauUnc mice tested. We conclude that this mutation arose before or during the early CC inbreeding stages. Mutation and genetic drift may cause distinct variation to arise and become fixed in individual CC strains leading to genetic differences between founder strains and their haplotypes in the CC population.",

We selected this sex ratio to sample the Y chromosome in each colony and to increase the X chromosome representation in the analysis. First, we confirmed that all sampled mice had consistent Y and mitochondria with their respective MRCA and sequenced sample. Next, we confirmed that all sampled mice had autosomal genotypes that matched with their respective sequenced sample using 3,295 markers common to MiniMUGA and GigaMUGA ( Figure S1 , Table S2, Table S3 ). We observe that each of the 216 samples most closely match their respective sequenced sample. This set of markers is sufficient to distinguish two closely related CC strains (CC051/TauUnc and CC059/TauUnc) ( Figure S1 ). The colony survey also allows us to estimate current levels of corresponding MRCA ( Figure 3A ). The four clear outliers that have both a high level of current heterozygosity and a small decrease in residual heterozygosity are four of the six new CC strains. We hypothesize that the overrepresentation of non-domesticus haplotypes combined with high initial residual heterozygosity and small number of generations between MRCAs and genotyped samples contributes to the low change in residual heterozygosity.",

The genotypes of these strains are available at https://www.med.unc.edu/ mmrrc/genotypes. Using a subset of 3,295 markers that overlap between MiniMUGA and GigaMUGA, we verified that genotypes of these mice were consistent with the sequenced samples and can be used as a comparison resource ( Figure S1 , Table S2, Table S3 ). We recommend that users of the CC preserve tissue samples from all CC mice (and derivatives) used in an experiment. Genetic mapping using genotypes from parental mice (i.e., breeders) would provide the most accurate estimation of current segregating haplotypes for that population. This will also facilitate the correction of potential errors in mouse identity, and serve as a validation of key resources. Our colony sampling of the CC at the SGCF highlights that residual heterozygosity is decreasing, but still present. For experiments where residual heterozygosity could disrupt analysis (i.e. vQTL mapping studies, F 2 mapping studies, recombinant inbred crosses), accurate analyses and interpretation of experimental results will likely benefit from genotyping individual experimental animals to ensure accurate haplotype assignment. Residual heterozygosity may also influence genetic mapping and the presence of QTL, if only one of the two haplotypes at a locus influences a trait (Rogala et al. 2014) . QTL that have residual heterozygosity may be a double-edged sword. Fixation of a haplotype (or population subsampling) may impede experimental replication in later studies. Alternately, residual heterozygosity can allow for QTL validation studies utilizing a segregating locus within a strain.",
