            "text": "Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), recently renamed to human orthopneumovirus, is a very important viral respiratory pathogen in infants, children and adult patients with immunodeficiency or cardiopulmonary disease and it is recognized as a major threat for the elderly population [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . An RSV infection starts with typical common-cold like symptoms but may progress to serious lower respiratory tract infections associated with a high rate of hospitalization of infants, children and elderly [7] . No vaccines or therapeutics are available except for Synagis \u00ae\u00ae , also known as the humanized antibody palivizumab. Palivizumab, which is solely used for passive immunization of high-risk infants, targets a specific, highly conserved epitope on the fusion protein [8, 9] , resulting in fusion inhibition. Currently, treatment of severe lower respiratory tract infections as a result of RSV infection consists of supportive care only, such as oxygen administration and nutrition. RSV is classified in the family Pneumoviridae, genus Orthopneumovirus and can be divided into two subtypes, RSV-A and RSV-B. It has a non-segmented, negative, single-stranded RNA genome that consists of ten genes, encoding 11 proteins. The viral envelope contains three proteins: the attachment protein (G), the fusion protein (F) and the small hydrophobic protein (SH). The G protein interacts with cellular receptors on the host cell membrane to attach the virus particle to the cell surface. The protein consists of a central conserved domain, two glycosylated mucin-like regions and an N-terminal region containing a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain [10, 11] . Sequencing of the G gene indicated that the two mucin-like regions flanking the central domain only have a 67% similarity at the nucleotide level between RSV-A and RSV-B and only 53% similarity at the deduced amino acid levels [12] . Consequently, the two mucin-like regions serve as excellent targets for RSV evolution studies. Both subtypes are further divided into genotypes based on those genetic variations. For RSV-A, the genotypes GA1-7, SAA1-2, NA1-4 and ON1 [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] have been defined, while for RSV-B, the GB1-5, SAB1-4, URU1-2, BA1-12 and THB [13, 14, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] genotypes are reported. The F protein is responsible for the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. An important side effect is the fusion of the cell membranes of an infected cell with adjacent cells, resulting in a giant cell with multiple nuclei, better known as a syncytium [26] . The formation of syncytia is recognized as a means to efficiently spread the infection along epithelial surfaces, while minimizing contact with the immune system [27] .",

Mucus is a gel-like substance that consists of different mucins (MUC), which are high molecular mass, highly glycosylated glycoproteins [28] . Airway mucus protects the epithelial surface from injury through mucociliary clearance, facilitating the removal of foreign particles and chemicals that enter the lung. Twenty-one MUC proteins have been described in humans and are divided in two families: secreted mucins and cell-tethered mucins. The major mucins produced in the airways are MUC5AC and MUC5B as secreted mucins and MUC1, MUC4, MUC16 and MUC20 as membrane-bound mucins [29] .",

Not only have these viruses not circulated in the public for many years, they have been serially passaged in cell culture, which may have resulted in an accumulation of mutations that benefit the virus to grow in cell culture but may also affect virus-host interactions. Low-passage, characterized clinical strains are hard to come by and consequently less used in research. Therefore, we have isolated virus from mucosal secretions of 12 patients in the winter seasons of 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 in Belgium, resulting in eight RSV-A subtypes and four RSV-B subtypes. We have grown these viruses to passage 3 and used them to assess their viral replication kinetics and infectious virus production in HEp-2, A549 and BEAS-2B cells, thermal stability at 37 \u2022 C, 32 \u2022 C and 4 \u2022 C, syncytium formation and neutralization by palivizumab.

Nasal secretions were collected from children showing symptoms of an RSV-related bronchiolitis during the winter seasons of 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 after written parental consent was given. The secretions were extracted by a nasal swab and/or a nasopharyngeal aspirate, which were stored at 4 \u2022 C for less than 10 h. One day prior to mucosal extraction, HEp-2 cells were seeded at a concentration of 17,500 cells/well in a clear 96 well plate (Falcon, Corning, NY, USA). Samples were vortexed for one minute with glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, Mo, USA) before inoculating HEp-2 cells with 50 \u00b5L of a 1 4 dilution series of the sample, made in DMEM-0. After 2 h of incubation with the inoculum at 37 \u2022 C, 50 \u00b5L of DMEM containing iFBS, antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fischer Scientific), moxifloxacin (Sigma-Aldrich)) and anti-fungals (Fungizone)(Sigma-Aldrich) was added to obtain a final concentration of DMEM with 2% FBS. Plates were incubated for seven days at 37 \u2022 C (5% CO 2 ). After seven days, the plates were checked for syncytium formation and 50 \u00b5L of the well with the lowest concentration of original sample but still presenting CPE, was transferred to a newly seeded plate, following the previously described protocol. After an additional seven days, the wells were rechecked for syncytium formation. A total of 250 \u00b5L from wells presenting with syncytia was transferred to a freshly seeded T25, which was incubated until CPE was visible throughout the culture. Supernatant was collected, centrifuged for ten minutes at 1000\u00d7 g, aliquoted, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen (passage 0). Virus obtained from these clinical samples was propagated until passage 3 on HEp-2 cells to obtain a plaque forming unit (PFU) count high enough to perform the following experiments. One sample did not propagate efficiently on HEp-2 cells and was propagated for three passages on Vero cells until a high PFU was reached. Passage 3 cultures were tested for the following contaminants by qPCR: hMPV, Rhinovirus 1 and 3, PIV 1, 2, 3 and 4, adenovirus, Coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, Paraechovirus, Enterovirus 68 and Bocavirus and found negative for all. Several virus cultures tested negative on mycoplasma presence and no signs of bacterial or fungal presence was observed when the cultures were test grown in absence of antibiotics and anti-fungals.",

BE/ANT-B15/17) and one strain grown on Vero cells (BE/ANT-B20/17) that resulted in significantly more infected cells at 72 h than the reference RSV B1, whereas just one strain (BE/ANT-B2/17) seemed to result in comparable infection as the RSV B1. Infectious virus production of RSV-B strains shows that even though the BE/ANT-B20/17 and BE/ANT-B15/17 reach a very high percentage of infected cells, less infectious particles are produced compared to BE/ANT-B13/17, suggesting either that the particles may not be efficiently released in the supernatant and remain more cell-associated or that the particles may efficiently attach but replicate at lower levels. The same experiment was repeated in the A549 (Figure 3 ) cell line in which for the RSV-A isolates ( Figure 3A ), the RSV A2 shows the highest percentage of infected cells, followed closely by the BE/ANT-A11/17, reaching only slightly lower percentages of infected cells than in the HEp-2 cells after 72 h. This strain also produced the highest amounts of infectious virus in A549 cells ( Figure 3C ). In HEp-2 cells both the RSV-B subtype isolates BE/ANT-B13/17 and BE/ANT-B20/17 reach a higher percentage of infected cells than the RSV B1, whereas results of A549 replication kinetics suggest that the BE/ANT-B13/17 and BE/ANT-B2/17 strains reach similar infection rates ( Figure 3B ). The BE/ANT-B20/17 reached about 50% infection after 48 h but the infection then seemed to flatten out towards 72 h, resulting in a significant difference with infection rates of the RSV B1. Interestingly, the isolate BE/ANT-B2/17, which did not efficiently infect HEp-2 cells now reached a near 100% infected number in A549 cells in 72 h. Unsurprisingly, the BE/ANT-B15/17 achieved again the lowest number of infected cells and levels of virus production in A549 cells ( Figure 3D ). As the BEAS-2B cell line is also a highly permissive cell line for RSV infection and widely used as well, we assessed viral growth and production kinetics in this cell line (Figure 4 ). For all RSV-A clinical isolates, no major differences were observed after 48 h and 72 h of infection in percentage of infected cells ( Figure 4A ). After 72h of infection, the amount of infectious virus released by the cells was the highest for RSV A2 and clinical isolate BE/ANT-A11/17. Larger differences were observed between the clinical isolates of the RSV-B subtype ( Figure 4B ). BE/ANT-B13/17 reached percentages and infectious virus production that were comparable to RSV B1 ( Figure 4B,D) . Isolates BE/ANT-B2/17 and BE/ANT-B15/17 had the lowest infection rates and infectious virus production in both this cell line as well as in the HEp-2 cells (Figure 4B,D) . ",

Afterwards, cells were fixed, fluorescently stained and analysed with fluorescence microscopy. Mean syncytium size was determined by calculating the mean of the number of nuclei in the syncytia formed per sample, (Figure 6A ,B) as well as mean syncytium frequency ( Figure 6C ,D) by counting the number of nuclei belonging to syncytia relative to the total number of nuclei of infected cells. Mean syncytium size of all RSV-A clinical isolates ( Figure 6A ) lies between four and seven nuclei per cell, with BE/ANT-A1/16, BE/ANT-A8/17 and BE/ANT-A10/17 having the largest syncytia. The smallest syncytia were produced by BE/ANT-A12/17. Mean syncytium frequencies lie between 16% and 21%, with the lowest frequency found for BE/ANT-A10/17, which suggested that it promotes the formation of larger syncytia rather than many small syncytia ( Figure 6C ).

According to the phylogenetic trees, the clinical isolates can be divided into three groups for the RSV-A isolates and two groups for the RSV-B isolates. However, differences can even be observed between clinical isolates that belong to the same group within the genotype. For example BE/ANT-A11/17, which, in comparison with BE/ANT-A8/17 and other clinical isolates from the same season, infects a higher number of cells in viral replication kinetics experiments, produced a higher amount of infectious virus and retained its stability in thermal stability assays. It is only slightly less neutralized by palivizumab compared to other RSV-A clinical isolates that have been isolated from the same season. Secondly, BE/ANT-B2/17 and BE/ANT-B15/17 are generally poor infectors and also have a lower thermal stability than other RSV-B clinical isolates from the same season. Generally, differences can be observed between the different clinical isolates in viral replication kinetics, but all clinical isolates have the ability to infect all cell lines tested. These differences could be due to underlying genetic differences that could affect antiviral responses in the cells, or due to differences that could be accounted to changes in the way the virus replicates in the cells, such as the presence of defective interfering virus particles. Our results suggest that the thermal stability of the clinical isolates is in general lower than the reference strains. The reason for this is unknown but it may be that repeated infection of the reference strains has resulted in the selection of variants with replicative fitness advantage at these temperatures. Remarkably, RSV B1 remains rather stable at 4 \u2022 C compared to the RSV A2 and other clinical strains.",

Mean syncytium size and mean syncytium frequency were determined after 48h of infection with a 0.6% Avicel \u00ae\u00ae overlay to minimize free particle movement. The presence of Avicel \u00ae\u00ae would promote the formation of syncytia rather than spread and the formation of new syncytia during the incubation period. Even with minimal free particle movement, different sizes of syncytia containing 2-180 nuclei per cell are formed by the clinical isolates. For example, BE/ANT-B20/17 clearly forms large syncytia without infected satellite cells, which suggests that the produced particles remain more cell associated, and virus spread in HEp-2 cells may be facilitated through syncytia formation rather than particle release. This could also be observed from the replication kinetics and infectious virus production: the number of infected cells rapidly increases, and about 80% of the culture is infected after 48h, whereas the amount of infectious virus in the supernatant is lower compared to most other clinical isolates. This suggests that the production of infectious virus particles is either limited or faulty in HEp-2 cells for this isolate.

Furthermore, a comparison of the clinical isolates to the reference strains RSV A2 and RSV B1 reveal overall no major differences.

Viral replication kinetics in HEp-2 cells for RSV-A (Figure 2A) strains yielded one strain (BE/ANT-A11/17) that resulted in significantly higher percentages of RSV-infected cells after 48 h compared to RSV A2. The BE/ANT-A11/17 also produced more infectious virus particles after 24 h post inoculation (p.i.) compared to all other strains (Figure 2C). Three strains (BE/ANT-A21/17, BE/ANT-A7/17, BE/ANT-A8/17) replicated more slowly than the RSV A2 at 48 h but a fully infected culture was observed after 72 h of infection. Infection with a MOI of 0.01 of the RSV-B strains resulted in infection values between 0.5% and 1% infected cells after 24 h. The RSV-B strains (Figure 2B,D) showed two strains grown on HEp-2 cells (BE/ANT-B13/17,",
