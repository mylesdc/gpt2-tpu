Adaptation is often a key factor for successfully establishing sustained human-tohuman transmission. Here we use simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios with particular reference to spatial heterogeneity within the human population. We present analytical expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction, as well as the waiting time to a successful emergence event. Furthermore, we derive general analytical results for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the probability distribution of outbreak sizes. We compare our analytical results with a stochastic model, which has previously been studied computationally. Our results suggest that, for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has only a weak effect on outbreak size distributions, and on the risk of emergence per introduction. For example, if R 0~1 :4 or larger, any village connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day is, effectively, just a part of the city when considering the chances of emergence and the outbreak size distribution. We present empirical data on commuting patterns and show that the vast majority of communities for which such data are available are at least this well interconnected. For plausible parameter ranges, the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. We conclude by discussing implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections.",

These make the natural, simplifying assumption that the host population is homogeneous, so that changes in infection parameters entirely reflect adaptations in the biology of host infection. In reality, however, factors such as human contact patterns [12] and other host heterogeneity [13, 14] may also shape the risk and speed of emergence events. We concentrate here on the heterogeneity in the spatial structure of the human host population, an area which has hitherto received little attention in the context of adapting pathogens. We model spatially separated communities with varying types and strengths of interconnections, for example between a village and a city. Our aim is to study under what regimes such 'ecological' structure could have a strong effect on emergence, in comparison with 'evolutionary' factors governing the biology of infection.",

We use these expressions to provide useful answers to important questions: if we knew how a zoonotic pathogen would adapt to human physiology, could we anticipate its emergence? How reliable would such predictions be? Furthermore, can we predict which zoonoses will cause outbreaks which do not turn into epidemics? Next, we ask: how large does a single, finite host population have to be, for population size to have a negligible effect? We then incorporate spatial heterogeneity by separating the human host population into communities. We present a model in which a small village is connected, by human travel, with a large city as an example of the general case of two interconnected communities. We use this model to ask: how strong do community interconnections have to be for us to safely ignore the separation of a population into spatially structured communities, such as cities and villages? We review available commuting data to ask how these thresholds compare with typical human mobility patterns? We close with a discussion of implications for public health.",

Occasionally, during such zoonotic infections, the pathogen acquires genetic changes that increase its ability to pass to other humans. During any chain of transmission the pathogen might adapt sufficiently that it achieves such ease of human-to-human transmission that R 0 w1 and an epidemic becomes possible. Such a process can be characterised by a vector of reproductive numbers (a i with i~1, . . . , n), and a vector of mutation probabilities (m i with i~1, . . . , n) where n{1 denotes the number of adaptive steps necessary to reach the fully adapted strain n.",

This intermediate transmissibility is not enough to sustain the novel pathogen within the human host population, but secondary infections by humans are possible. Thus we have a 1 va 2 v1.

Here, we extend this work to incorporate what is often an important host ecological feature, the spatial distribution of the host population. Many zoonoses occur away from large population centres. For example, HIV is thought to have entered the human population through bushmeat hunters in the sparsely populated jungles of Central Africa. We ask: when a pathogen is evolving to adapt for human transmission, under what circumstances does the spatial structure underlying the human population become important?

As an example of the general case of spatially structured communities, we focus on a simple village -city model to approximate the spatial host heterogeneity in rural areas connected, by human mobility, to bigger cities. There are many different types of human mobility between communities such as villages and cities, including short-term commuting and long-term labour migration. Particularly in developing countries, however, information on dominant patterns is sparse. Nonetheless, anecdotal evidence from Vietnam [17] , for example, suggests that short term commuting plays an important role: here, a subset of the village residents collects agricultural produce for trading in local markets in the city, and travels to the city on a daily to weekly basis. Accordingly we present a model in which the residence time of villagers in the city is typically less than the infectious period. However, in the supplementary information we also present a model incorporating migration on longer timescales (see Text S1, A.2). These two different models illustrate that our results appear qualitatively robust to different types of human movement.",

We explore the influence of spatial host contact structure, and validate our result with stochastic simulations of simple village-city models as an example of interconnected communities within a spatially structured population. Our study reveals that for plausible parameter ranges, spatial heterogeneity only has very limited impact on the probability of emergence, as well as the outbreak size distribution. Neither a change in strength of spatial heterogeneity (e.g. number of commuters), nor in its quality (e.g. short term versus long term commuting) shows a significant influence. Our results suggest that only the most remote rural communities would be subject to epidemiological isolation. In particular, the available empirical data suggests that communities tend to be highly interconnected with relatively high connection strengths. Of course, it is the most remote communities of the world for whom we have the least relevant data. More empirical research on spatial heterogeneity is needed to form a better understanding of its effect, and this need is greatest in developing parts of the world.",

Only a small number of infectious hosts are actually involved in the emergence process, which relates to the small reservoir of susceptibles needed for a successful emergence. Moreover, biological processes such as the speed of evolution and the adaptive route show a strong influence on the overall emergence process. We show that epidemiological parameters such as the outbreak size group according to the evolutionary route. Previous research has shown the effect of the pathogen's route of evolutionary adaptation and mutation rate on the probability of emergence per introduction [10, 11] . Our theoretical derivation of the probability of emergence extends this and offers the benefit of being analytically solvable for any possible route of adaptation and any mutation probabilities. We note here that previous work has highlighted the role of other, significant types of heterogeneity in emergence of a novel infection. For example, [29] describe the effect of the pathogens life history, such as the length of infection, on the emergence of a novel pathogen. Further, heterogeneity in human-to-human transmission within a population may have an influence on the course and probability of emergence and outbreaks [13, 14] , usually lowering the probability of emergence. While we have concentrated here on simple types of spatial heterogeneity, a significant question for future research is the role of mixed heterogeneities, for example spatially structured populations with additional heterogeneity in the human-to-human transmission.",

            "text": "We also find that the waiting time for an outcome of a novel pathogen's introduction is highly unpredictable, even if the probability for such an event is known. Conversely, this means that an estimate of the underlying epidemiological parameters from observed data will be highly uncertain. Unfortunately, a large number of observations will be necessary to achieve confidence in the parameters, and even a large number of introductions gone extinct do not rule out the possibility of emergence for a pathogen. We came to a similar result [11] using a measurement on the upper bound of the probability of emergence. Moreover, the probability of emergence given a certain number of infectious hosts can be surprisingly low. Even a comparatively large number of infectious hosts can end in extinction, especially for low mutation rates and intermediate-stage average reproductive numbers just below one. Figure 5 . Data of commuting patterns in different parts of the world. Shown is the cumulative fraction of all communities with equal or less than the specified number of commuters. The data was mostly collected by the National Statistical Offices of the respective countries. The gold line represents commuting data from Brazil [21] , the red line data from the USA [22], the blue line data from the UK [23] , the brown line data from Japan [25], the cyan line data from Hong Kong [24] , and the green line data from two independent sources. The green line has orange [27] and pink data points [26] , corresponding to its data sources. Our data represents the commuting flows between administrative units. The definition of administrative units varies highly between countries. For example, the US data is on a granularity of 3,141 counties, while the data from Japan is based on its 47 prefectures. However, heterogeneity can also be found within countries datasets. The Brazilian data is on a level of 5,507 municipalities with resident sizes ranging from 1,166 to 10, 435, 548. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000947.g005 Figure 6 . Deviation between simulated and analytical predicted probability of emergence. The deviation is a function of the average number of commuters vcw. The deviation is defined as Dp (ana) em {p (sim) em D=p (ana) em . The analytical probability of emergence p (ana) em is for an infinite ulation without spatial structure. The simulated probability of emergence p (sim) em is for short-term commuting with the blue data points representing the gradual route (II) of adaptation, and the orange data points representing the punctuated route (I). The solid black line is 1{H spatial (1=a 3 ) vcwf , as defined in equation 12 in the main text. It is the analytical expected deviation for spatial heterogeneity as a function of the spatial homogeneity coefficient. The simulations agree very well with the analytical expected deviation. The gradual route (II) is slightly more off from the theoretical prediction as a result of the small but significant number of infected with the intermediate strain. Effectively, it lowers the number of commuters infected with the fully adapted strain and therefore the probability of transmission from the village to the city. Nevertheless, the analytical prediction as well as the simulations show no significant impact of spatial heterogeneity from a critical commuter threshold of vcw~10. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000947.g006 Figure 7 . Impact of spatial heterogeneity on disease transmission between communities (I). The impact is measured with the spatial homogeneity coefficient with 0\u0192H spatial \u01921. Given H spatial~1 every emergence in the village automatically leads to an emergence in the city, and H spatial~0 represents no chance of successfully transmitting the pathogen into the city. The figure reveals that spatial structure becomes especially important for small average reproductive numbers. In addition, the average number of commuters needed to show an effect of spatial heterogeneity is surprisingly small. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000947.g007",

To all intents and purposes isolation would have to be absolute to be effective. In most circumstances such extreme intervention would not be acceptable. Second, given typical mobility patterns, it is likely that once there is a detectable number of cases in the village, there may already be a significant number of cases outside of it. Therefore quarantining interventions are likely to come too late.",

For a population size, N, of 50, 200 and 500, an emergence event is defined as having at least 10% of the population size infected with the fully adapted strain, while the number was fixed at 100 infected with the fully adapted strain for N~1000. While host populations with Nv500 clearly show finite size effects, even small host populations with N&500 can be effectively treated as infinite as the outbreak size is small compared to the population size. The figure reveals the effect of the pathogen's evolution on the outbreak size distribution as the distributions group according to the route of adaptation.
