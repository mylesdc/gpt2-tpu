According to the results, the incidence growth curves differed moderately compared with that of \u2206t = 1 day (main text, Figure 3 ); the daily ARs were less severe for scenarios with \u2206t = 0.5 day. However, there were only slight differences for the impacts of interventions on the baseline scenario between two kinds of time-step settings. For ",

Restrictions on a single mode of transport had less apparent impact due to moderate deviations. The range of peak times from imposing 99% restriction on all modes of transports was wider. However, the central tendency of the intervention effects were quite stable. The impacts of interventions on the baseline scenario did not differ much compared with the study main findings. For example, when a 99% restriction of all transports was imposed, the peak was averagely deferred to the ninth month and the eleventh month respectively in absences and presences of the uses of antiviral and hospitalization.

Each country will develop its own infected cases by generating from the discretized-time SEIR model based on the estimated reproduction number. At the same time, the countries will send their infected cases to Hong Kong and the local epidemic evolution will be initiated by the successive imported cases via air, sea, and land traffic. The first passage times (FPT), first one hundred passages times (FHPT), and the peak time are calculated for different restriction strategies.Baseline scenarioSince the Hong Kong Government confirmed the first imported case of H1N1pdm on May 1, 2009[17], the parameters E i (0) and I i (0) are roughly assumed the same for all countries and are iteratively estimated, thereby minimizing the difference between the reported date and the simulated first passage time (FPT). Allowing for stochastic variability, the baseline transmission rate (\u03b2) is fitted using the local surveillance data for the first two months following the day of the first local import, in the absence of travel restrictions and intervention. Local daily surveillance of confirmed infected cases(Figure 2) was available from press releases on human swine flu, published by the Department of Health, Hong Kong[18]. Optimum parameter is chosen which had average minimum relative mean square error between empirical and estimated cumulative incidence by Monte Carlo simulation. The reproduction number is the product of the transmission rate and the average infectious period. We adapt the range of parameter space for the reproduction numbers according to previous influenza A (H1N1) studies[8] [11] [19][20].Result of baseline estimationThe estimated parameters E i (0) and I i (0) are equal to 90 individuals which obtain May 4 as a mean FPT with a 95% confidence interval [Apr 14,May 16]. The local estimated R 0 is about 1.4 during the first two months after the reported FPT. The fitted cumulative incidence curve from data was showed inFigure 2.",

The confirmed cumulative cases (the grey bar in the figure) is from the press releases on human swine flu, published by the Department of Health, Hong Kong. The median cumulative cases (the dash line) were simulated by 100 realizations from the best fitted model 2 Impact of other variations Variations of R 0 from non-local countries We varied the R 0 s from 44 foreign countries by 20%, in order to test these effects on our results. The increased and decreased R 0 s ranged from 1.3 to 2.2 (median 1.7), and from 0.8 to 1.5 (median 1.1), respectively. Although five countries did not occur any outbreak i.e. R 0 < 1, it made small impact on the size of infected cases exportation among all countries. Showed in Figure 3, the external travel restrictions performed slightly better in deferring the FPTs and the FHPTs when the R 0 s from non-local countries decreased. Given the R 0 s increased by 20%, the medians of FPT and the FHPT were day 44-th and day 74-th respectively with no travel restriction; the medians of FPT and the FHPT were day 63-th and day 112-th respectively when the R 0 s decreased 20%. Amongst all situations for the changes of the R 0 s, either 90% or 99% of air travel rescaling could have about 1",

Similar to the baseline scenario, the travel restriction made greater impacts on slowing down the ARs increase with the use of antiviral and hospitalization (AH); a 99% rescaling of means of all transport controlled the final AR at about 20% in addition to the use of AH (Figure 4B). When the R 0 s decreased by 20%, the travel restrictions performed better in slowing down the disease transmission. Even if only the air travel was either 90% or 99% restricted, the seven months' cumulative ARs would have reduced about 15% compared to that of no intervention (Figure 4C). A 99% restriction of all means of transport would have halted the local spread i.e. cumulative ARs < 0.1% in seven months' time whether or not the AH had been used (Figure 4C and 4D). However, the final cumulative ARs would not be affected by the changes of the R 0 s from non-local countries.",
