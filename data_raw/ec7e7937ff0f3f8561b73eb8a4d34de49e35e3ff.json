In this study we addressed whether inactivated HHV-6B can also induce IFN lambda responses and to what extent interferons alpha and lambda affect Th1/Th2 polarization. We show that inactivated HHV-6B induced IFN-lambda1 (IL-29) but not IFN-lambda2 (IL-28A) responses in plasmacytoid DC and that this induction was mediated through TLR9. We have previously shown that HHV-6B promotes Th1 responses and blocks Th2 responses in both humans and mice. We now show that neutralization of IFN-alpha but not IFN-lambda1 blocked the HHV-6B-induced enhancement of Th1 responses in MLR, but did not affect the HHV-6-induced dampening of Th2 responses. Similarly, blockage of TLR9 counteracted HHV-6Bs effects on the Th1/Th2 balance. In addition, IFN-alpha but not IFN-lambda1 promoted IFN-gamma production and blocked IL-5 and IL-13 production in purified CD4+ T-cells. The lack of effect of IFN-lambda1 correlated with the absence of the IFN-lambda receptor IL-28Ralfa chain on the cell surface of both resting and activated CD4+ T-cells. We conclude that inactivated HHV-6B is a strong inducer of IFN-lambda1 in plasmacytoid DC and that this induction is TLR9dependent. However, human CD4+ T-cells do not express the IFN-lambda receptor and are refractory to IFN-lambda1 treatment. The HHV-6B-induced alterations in the Th1/Th2 balance are instead mediated mainly through TLR9 and IFNalpha.",

The family consists of three members, IFN-lambda1 (IL-29), IFN-lambda2 (IL-28A), and IFN-lambda3 (IL-28B) and are commonly referred to as the IFNlambda family [1, 2] . All three IFN-lambdas utilize a common distinct receptor, the IFN-lambdaR, which is composed of the IL-10R2 chain and the unique IL-28Ralpha chain [2, 3] . The IFN-lambdaR is expressed at high densities on epithelial cells [3] but IL-28Ralpha transcripts might also be found in other cells including blood lymphocytes [2] . Binding of IFN-lambda to its receptor induces a signaling response similar to that obtained by type I IFNs [1] , even though the intensity of the IFN-lambda response is generally weaker [1, 4] . The anti-viral effects obtained by IFN-lambda protects against some but not all viral infections, and preferentially those that occur at mucosal surfaces [5, 6] .",

IFN-alpha not only promotes IFN-gamma production by CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells [7, 8] but can also re-direct an already established Th2 response into a more Th1-like response [9] . IFN-lambda share some of the immune-modulatory functions of IFN-alpha. Signaling through the IFN-lambdaR induces the phosphorylation of both STAT 1 and STAT 4 [1, 4] , i.e. transcription factors involved in the development of IFN-gamma/Th1 responses [7, 10] . The main T-cell immune-modulatory function of IFN-lambda1 that has been reported is in dampening Th2 responses, in particular IL-13 [11] [12] [13] . It is however not conclusively proven that IFN-lambda has direct effects on CD4+ T-cell polarization rather than operating through accessory cells such as dendritic cells and monocytes [14] .",

This means that we have not been able to detect potential low IFN-lambda2 responses.

Since anti-CD3 activation alone did not give rise to any measurable IL-13 responses (not shown), we added soluble anti-CD28 to these cultures.

Even though IFN-lambda1 genes are considered to be early response genes whereas IFN-lambda2 is expressed with delayed kinetics [14] , there were no apparent IFN-lambda2 responses even at 72 h post activation. IFN-lambda2 depends on the inducible IRF7 pathway whereas IFN-lambda1 is also regulated by the constitutively expressed IRF3 [17] . Since IRF7 is constitutively expressed in pDC [18] , our data clearly show that pDC produce higher amounts of IFN-lambda1 compared to IFN-lambda2 in response to HHV-6B exposure. We have previously shown that inactivated HHV-6B can induce high levels of IFN-alpha by cord pDC [15] and the data from this study show that both the IFN-alpha and the IFN-lambda1 responses induced by HHV-6B are mediated through TLR9.

That IFN-alpha has T-cell immune-modulatory functions is well established [7] [8] [9] and reflects the almost universal expression of the IFN-alpha/beta receptor on nucleated cells. However, when we neutralized IFNalpha in HHV-6B-exposed mixed lymphocyte reactions we only managed to influence the Th1 responses. Thus, addition of neutralizing antibodies to IFN-alpha blocked the virus-induced enhancement in IFN-gamma production without affecting the virus-induced reduction in Th2 cytokines. In contrast, addition of recombinant IFN-alpha to activated cord CD4+ T-cells affected both the Th1 and the Th2 responses. In this setting, IFN-alpha enhanced the production of IFN-gamma and reduced the production of IL-5 and IL-13. This implies that IFN-alpha indeed has the capacity to influence both Th1 and Th2 responses. The lack-of-effect of anti-IFN-alpha in enhancing the Th2 responses in the HHV-6B-exposed cord MLR could imply that other factors than IFN-alpha also has a Th2-dampening effect. In relation to this, we recently showed that enveloped viruses (in this case coronavirus, CMV, HSV-1, influenza virus and morbillivirus), but not naked virus, blocked IL-13 responses in vitro, and that this inhibition occurred independently of IFN-alpha responses [22] . This would argue for an IFN-alpha-independent modulation of IL-13 responses by virus such as HHV-6B.",

We therefore decided to check for the expression of the IFN-lambda receptor on CD4+ T-cells. Resting CD4+ T-cells did not show any expression of the IL-28Ralpha chain, nor did CD4+ T-cells that had been activated with anti-CD3 or exposed to IFN-alpha. Previous studies have identified IL-28Ralpha transcripts in human T-cells [13, 23] but our data clearly show that there is no IL-28Ralpha protein expression on the cell surface on neither resting nor activated CD4+ cells. We thus conclude that IFN-lambda1 does not have direct effects on CD4+ T-cells due to the lack-of-expression of the cognate cytokine receptor. This is in line with a recent report by Arasteh et al [24] showing that IFN-lambda2 has no effect on CD25 expression or proliferation of cord CD4+ T-cells. There is however one report showing a direct effect of IFN-lambda1 on purified human CD4+ T-cells [13] . In this study it was shown that IFN-lambda not only suppressed GATA-3induced Th2 responses but also indirectly enhanced IFN-gamma responses [13] . However, the authors used negative selection for the CD4+ purification. Given that the purified cells used were not completely pure (.95%) indicates that there might have been some accessory cells left among the CD4+ T-cells [13] . If so, the effect of IFN-lambda1 could well be mediated indirectly via some other cell subset.",

The transcript for the IL-28Ralpha has also been found in pDC [26] and we now show that pDC express low levels of IL28Ralpha on the cell surface. This indicates to us that IFN-lambda acts preferentially on certain subsets of antigen-presenting cells and that the observed effects of IFN-lambda on CD4+ T-cell differentiation [11] [12] [13] are indirect. The most plausible mode of action of IFN-lambda is through its interaction with myeloid cells [27] . This assumption is substantiated by in vitro studies showing that IFN-lambda blocks IL-13 responses and promotes IFNgamma responses through its effects on dendritic cells [11, 12] . Furthermore, IFN-lambda promotes Th1 responses and blocks Th2 and Th17 responses in vivo in mice through its modulation of the IL-12 production by lung myeloid dendritic cells [28] . The Th2 dampening and Th1 promoting effects could be adoptively transferred by IL-28A-treated CD11c + cells [28] .",

Experimentally, we strengthened this hypothesis by showing that HHV-6B exposure blocks Th2 responses and allergy development in a mouse model of allergic disease [16] . In vitro we showed that HHV-6B can promote Th1 responses (IFN-gamma) and reduce Th2 responses (IL-5 and IL-13) [15] . The results from the present study indicate that these effects are mediated in part through IFN-alpha. We initially hypothesized that IFN-lambda is implicated in dampening the Th2 responses [11] [12] [13] , but this was not the case in our in vitro system. However, IFN-lambda might well play a role in reducing Th2 responses in vivo, as shown by Koltsida et al [28] .",
