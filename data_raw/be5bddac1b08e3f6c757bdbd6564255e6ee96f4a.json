In the current study, we investigate the ability of WIV1-CoV to infect Rousettus aegyptiacus bats. No clinical signs were observed throughout the experiment. Furthermore, only four oropharyngeal swabs and two respiratory tissues, isolated on day 3 post inoculation, were found positive for viral RNA. Two out of twelve bats showed a modest increase in coronavirus specific antibodies post challenge. In conclusion, WIV1-CoV was unable to cause a robust infection in Rousettus aegyptiacus bats.",

The natural history of viruses in animal reservoirs and their ability to infect the human host is important to predict the risk of spillover events and subsequent epidemics. The World Health Organization has identified a list of top emerging diseases likely to cause major epidemics. The list includes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused a pandemic in 2002-2003 [1] . SARS-CoV is hypothesized to originate from Rhinolophus sinicus bats since several SARS-like viruses have been detected in this host [2, 3] . However, most SARS-like viruses from bats do not bind the human receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). For example, a recombinant virus based on a consensus sequence of SARS-like viruses from bats could not be cultured unless a part of the spike protein was exchanged with SARS-CoV spike protein [4] . This suggests that a substantial portion of the SARS-like viruses circulating in bats cannot infect humans directly.",

This suggests WIV1-CoV may be able to directly transmit from bats to humans. In order to understand the relationship between coronaviruses and their bat hosts, experimental animal models are needed.

No clinical signs were observed, but viral RNA was detected in both fecal samples and intestinal tissue [7] . Likewise, no clinical signs were observed following intranasal and intraperitoneal inoculation of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. However, shedding of viral RNA was detected in oral and rectal swabs, and a variety of different tissues tested positive for viral RNA [8] . Together, these studies suggest that bats might show limited clinical signs when infected with coronaviruses but will continue to shed the virus.",

This matches closely to what has been reported on proteolytic activation of MERS S and SARS S glycoprotein and further supports the validity of the use of pseudotypes. Whereas MERS S glycoprotein is processed by host proprotein convertases in virus-producing cells before virus-cell entry [18] , SARS S glycoprotein processing by these convertases is absent or inefficient [19] .
