The objective of this study was to search for new genes involved in mouse palate formation. Gene expression of murine embryonic palatal tissue was analyzed at various developmental stages before, during, and after palate fusion using GeneChipH microarrays. Ceacam1 was one of the highly up-regulated genes during palate formation, and this was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Immunohistochemical staining showed that CEACAM1 was present in prefusion palatal epithelium and was degraded during fusion. To investigate the developmental role of CEACAM1, function-blocking antibody was added to embryonic mouse palate in organ culture. Palatal fusion was inhibited by this function-blocking antibody. To investigate the subsequent developmental role of CEACAM1, we characterized Ceacam1-deficient (Ceacam1 2/ 2 ) mice. Epithelial cells persisted abnormally at the midline of the embryonic palate even on day E16.0, and palatal fusion was delayed in Ceacam1 2/2 mice. TGFb3 expression, apoptosis, and cell proliferation in palatal epithelium were not affected in the palate of Ceacam1 2/2 mice. However, CEACAM1 expression was retained in the remaining MEE of TGFb-deficient mice. These results suggest that CEACAM1 has roles in the initiation of palatal fusion via epithelial cell adhesion.",

The formation of the mammalian secondary palate requires several developmental steps, including growth, elevation, and midline fusion of the palatal shelves [2] . Two palatal shelves grow from the internal surfaces of the maxillary primordia once development of the secondary palate is initiated, and at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) in the mouse, they appear vertically on each side of the tongue. They subsequent elevate to a horizontal position above the tongue at E14.0 [2] . From E14.0 to E14.5, the palatal shelves make contact and start the fusion necessary for correct morphogenesis [3] , and by E14.5 they are fused with one another from the middle region to the anterior and posterior regions to transform the medial edge epithelium (MEE) into the midline edge epithelial seam (MES) [4] . Ultimately, by E15.5, the MES is absent from the fused palate.",

In Tgfb2-deficient (Tgfb2 2/2 ) mice, some of the newborns (23%) exhibit cleft palate [16] . Tgfb3 2/2 mice show complete phenotype penetrance of cleft palate (100%) [17] . The failure of palatal shelf fusion in Tgfb3 2/2 mice can be rescued by exogenous TGFb3 in an in vitro organ culture system [14] . Subsequent studies indicate that TGFb3 is required for the disappearance of the MEE by inducing programmed cell death [18] . Concerning its receptor, epithelial-specific conditional knockout of Tgfbr2 also resulted in partial cleft palate [19] . These two mouse models are useful to examine the mechanism of palatal fusion.",

CEACAM1 is displayed on epithelial cells of reproductive tissues such as the uterus, the breast, and the prostate [20] . In these tissues, CEACAM1 acts as a cell adhesion molecule, an angiogenic factor, a tumor suppressor, and a signal regulatory protein [21] .

At E15.0, the MES was disrupted, and epithelial islands were observed, which a complete disappearance at E15.5 after fusion. Here we showed that histological changes of palatal formation with suspension cultured were shown in Figure 1A -F. The prefused each palatal shelves became to be close easily due to absence of tongue ( Figure 1A , B). After attached the each palatal shelves, fusing process started. The MES was detected during fusion as well as normal pathogenesis at E14.5 ( Figure 1C, D) . It was taken for 60 h to completely disappear of MEE in the midline of palate ( Figure 1E , F). Our suspension culture methods were clearly demonstrated the process of palatogenesis in ex vivo situation. In order to identify candidate molecules of palatal fusion, palatal tissues were dissected for microarray analysis as shown in the boxes areas of Figure 1B , D, F. Microarray analysis was performed to detect the gene expression of palatal tissues at various stages, including before, during, and after palatal fusion. The number of genes up-regulated and down-regulated more than 2-fold were 3663 and 2947, respectively. Large changes were seen in the expression of Krt13 (keratin 13), Ceacam1, Car3 (carbonic anhydrase 3), Fmo2 (flavin containing monooxygenase 2), Hdc (histidine decarboxylase), and Armc3 (armadillo repeat containing 3) ( Table 1) . One of the highly up-regulated genes was Ceacam1. CEACAM1 is known as an adhesion and angiogenic molecule. We chose to study this molecule further because epithelial cell adhesion is an extremely important process for the initiation of palatal fusion.",

After fusion, there were no epithelial components nor any CEACAM1 expression observed in the center of the palatal shelves. Thereafter, CEACAM1 was only expressed in the nasal and oral epithelium in the midline ( Figure 3D ). We further investigated the functional significance of CEACAM1 expression during palate formation using a suspension culture system. In this organ culture system, the function-blocking antibody mAb CC1 [25, 26] was added to the medium, and the palatal tissues were cultured for 60 h. Initial palatal adhesion and fusion were inhibited by antibody blocking of CEACAM1. Control (nonspecific IgG) showed a normal high score of palatal fusion (79.865.6%), whereas palatal fusion was significantly inhibited by mAb CC1 (48.366.7%) ( Figure 3E ).

Conditional inactivation of Tgfbr2 in palatal epithelium using K14-Cre;Tgfbr2 fl/fl mice revealed incomplete disappearance of the MEE and submucous cleft in palate formation [19] . Tgfb3 2/2 mice also show the failure of palatal shelf fusion with 100 percent penetrance [17] . Subsequent studies indicated that TGFb3 is required for the disappearance of MEE by inducing programmed cell death [18] . Additionally, it has been reported that TGFb3 in palatal epithelium regulates cell-cell adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin during fusion of palatal shelves [28, 29] . Therefore, we investigated that whether CEA-CAM1 expression was changed in TGFb-deficient mice, which have defects in the disappearance of MEE. We compared wildtype mice at E14.5 to K14-Cre;Tgfbr2 fl/fl mice at E15.5 and Tgfb3 2/ 2 mice at E14.5. CEACAM1 expression was weakly observed in the MEE of anterior and posterior regions of palatal shelves in wild-type embryos ( Figure 6A, B) . Residual MES palatal epithelium was seen in K14-Cre;Tgfbr2 fl/fl mutant embryos ( Figure 6C, D) . Interestingly, CEACAM1 was clearly expressed in the remaining palatal epithelium in K14-Cre;Tgfbr2 fl/fl embryos. In Tgfb3 2/2 mice, the opposing palatal shelves were just attached at the midline of the developing palate ( Figure 6F ). CEACAM1 expression was also retained in the palatal epithelium and mesenchyme of palatal shelves ( Figure 6E , F). To investigate the effect of TGFb3 on CEACAM1 expression, exogenous TGFb3 beads were placed in the organ culture undergoing palatal fusion. TGFb3 did not directly affect the expression of CEACAM1 (data not shown).",

Fusion of the palate occurs in three distinct steps: 1. the MEE of each palatal shelf adhere; 2. the MEE of each palatal shelf forms the MES; 3. the MES disappears. Most recent studies have focused on the mechanism of the disappearance of the MES, which is known to involve apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and/or cell migration. Little is known about the adhesion molecules that are critical players for attachment of opposing palatal shelves and MEE adhesion.",

To elucidate the mechanism of palate formation, especially epithelial adhesion in craniofacial development, we performed microarray analysis to detect genes expressed in palatal tissues at various developmental stages including before, during, and after palatal fusion. We identified more than three thousand genes that are up-regulated during and after palatal fusion. We hypothesized that these up-regulated genes play important developmental roles, and started searching for functional genes that have not been previously reported. During palatal fusion, Ceacam1, Armc3, Car3, Fmo2, Hdc, and Ker13 are predominately up-regulated. Ceacam1 was identified as a candidate gene that may be important for embryonic palatal fusion.",

CEACAM1 also functions as an epithelial tumor suppressor and as an angiogenic growth factor [22, 32] . These studies suggest that CEACAM1 regulates epithelial adhesion and morphogenesis. CEACAM1 expression is induced by VEGF. CEACAM1 contributes to endothelial cell tube formation (angiogenesis) as an additional effect of VEGF [33] . CEACAM1 is expressed in adherence junctions, and it supports cell adhesion and polarity [34] . CEACAM1 displays both homophilic adhesion (CEACAM1-CEACAM1) and heterophilic adhesion (CEACAM1-CEA) [35] . One hypothesis is that CEACAM1 contributes to cell adhesion and morphogenesis of the palate.

Interestingly, Ceacam1 mRNA expression was increased during and after palatal fusion, even though epithelial cells of the MES had disappeared. Because CEACAM1 is expressed in nasal and oral epithelium after palatal fusion, this discrepancy is likely due to Ceacam1 mRNA contributed by the nasal and oral epithelium. We also performed functional inhibition studies using antibody and analyzed the palatal tissues of the Ceacam1 2/2 mouse. The antifunctional CEACAM1 antibody inhibited palatal adhesion between opposing palatal shelves. These experiments demonstrated that CEACAM1 is very important for adhesion of palatal shelves at the initiation of palatal fusion.",

At E15.5, the palate fusion process was completed, and most of the wild-type MEE cells had disappeared. Ceacam1 2/2 MEE cells still maintained the ability to proliferate and were positive for Ki67 staining throughout the entire palate.
