There were more than 29,000 cases of infections, and 3,000 human deaths attributed to the 2009 global H1N1 influenza pandemic [2] . Because of the high mutation rates of the viral genome, vaccines and drugs initially directed against the virus often become ineffective [3, 4] . Therefore, measures are urgently needed to prevent and treat influenza virus infections, especially for high-risk groups and in the event of another pandemic. Certain host cell factors involved in the viral infection cycle have attracted interest as therapeutic targets because these are crucial for viral infections. Targeting these factors might inhibit infection, and there is the added advantage that they are less prone to mutations [5] [6] [7] .",

The HAs of human IAVs preferentially bind to \u03b1-2,6 linked SA, which is abundantly expressed in the human respiratory tract. The HA proteins of avian IAVs prefer \u03b1-2,3 linked SA as a receptor, as it is predominant in the avian enteric tract [9] . The binding of HA to its appropriate receptor is crucial for the initiation of infection and therefore serves as a potential therapeutic target. The novel sialidase fusion protein, DAS181 (Fludase), enzymatically removes SAs from the respiratory epithelium and exhibits potent antiviral activity against influenza A and B viruses [10] . Sialyltransferases are key enzymes that regulate the biosynthesis of sialylated oligosaccharide sequences [11] . Weinstein et al. concluded that one enzyme, \u03b2galactoside \u03b12,6sialyltransferase I (ST6Gal I), encoded by ST6GAL1, was responsible for the addition of \u03b1-2,6 SAs to the Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc disaccharide found on the glycans of N-linked and some O-linked glycoproteins [12] . Lin et al. found that antisense-oligodeoxynucleotides targeting ST6GAL1 mRNAs could inhibit the enzymatic activity of ST6Gal I, and reduced 2,6-sialylation at the cell surface [13, 14] .",

We designed siRNAs targeting ST6GAL1, in an attempt to inhibit pdmH1N1 and H3N2 virus infection in HEp-2, HBE, and A549 cells, which are representative of the upper, middle and lower respiratory tract epithelial cells, respectively, without inducing an interferon response.",

We demonstrated that the effective dose (10 nM) of siRNAs, under the conditions tested, was not toxic to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. However, we did notice that expression levels of receptors were substantially diminished as a result of siRNA targeting. Influenza viruses naturally infect epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract and the lungs of humans. Thus, siRNAs can be administered by inhalation. This would result in much higher local siRNA concentrations than could be achieved by parenteral injection, without adversely affecting epithelial cells [23] . Studies focusing on these aspects are currently underway in our laboratories. In other studies, investigators found that human influenza viruses can still infect ST6GAL1 knock-out mice, achieving similar titers in the lung and trachea as compared with wild-type animals [25] . A possible explanation for this is that there was greater efficiency of infection as a result of a deficient systemic influenza-specific humoral response in these ST6GAL1 knock-out mice [26] . There are two major types of SA\u03b12,3Gal, which differ in their penultimate bond (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3Gal-NAc or Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc) and these are synthesized by different enzymes [27] [28] [29] . Some human influenza virus strains propagated in allantoic cavities are able to bind to both SA\u03b12,6Gal and SA\u03b12,3Gal [9, 25, 30] . When recombinant rat \u03b12,3-sialyltransferase was used to reconstitute sialic acids, only one type of galactose was linked to other glycans through \u03b2-1,3 but not \u03b2-1,4 linkages [31] [32] [33] ; however, it is possible that other strains maintain the ability to bind to Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc. Thus, SA\u03b12,3Gal (Neu5Ac\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc) present in these mice can compensate for the loss of SA\u03b12,6Gal [34] . Monteerarat et al. [35] reported that suppression of SA\u03b12,3Gal expression by siRNAs against another sialyltransferase, \u03b2-galactoside \u03b1-2,3sialyltransferase 4 (ST3GAL4) could inhibit H5N1 avian influenza virus infection. The findings from our current study support the conclusions of Monteerarat et al., and we have further extended these to airway epithelial targets of human IAV infection. A combination of these two types of siRNAs might result in broader spectrum synergistic activities, depending upon their targets.",

Expression of the ST6Gal I protein was determined by western blotting. Respiratory epithelial cells (A549, HBE, and HEp-2) were transfected with control or ST6GAL1 siR-NAs (2.5-50 nmol). At 48 h post-transfection we used an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) for RNA extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracted total RNA (500 ng/sample) was then used for cDNA synthesis. The resulting cDNA was amplified in a 20-\u03bcL reaction containing ST6GAL1-specific forward (0.25 \u03bcmol) and reverse (0.25 \u03bcmol) primers (Additional file 1: Table S2 ), and 1\u00d7 Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Reactions were subjected to thermal cycling with an IQ5 System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) involving an initial 10-min denaturation step at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 60 s. Fluorescence signals from these reactions were captured at the end of the 60\u00b0C extension step for each cycle. To determine the specificity of the assay, amplicons were subject to melting curve analysis after the 40th cycle (65-95\u00b0C, 0.1\u00b0C/s). Our data were analyzed using the 2 -\u0394\u0394CT method, according to the manufacturer's instructions, with ST6GAL1 expression levels normalized to \u03b2-actin mRNA levels. ",
