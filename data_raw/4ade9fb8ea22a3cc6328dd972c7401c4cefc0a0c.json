            "text": "The use of Internet-based systems for infectious disease surveillance has been increasingly explored in recent years. However, few studies have used Internet search query or social media data to monitor spatial and temporal trends of avian influenza in China. This study investigated the potential of using search query and social media data in detecting and monitoring avian influenza A (H7N9) cases in humans in China. We collected weekly data on laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases in humans, as well as H7N9-related Baidu Search Index (BSI) and Weibo Posting Index (WPI) data in China from 2013 to 2017, to explore the spatial and temporal trends of H7N9 cases and H7N9-related Internet search queries. Our findings showed a positive relationship of H7N9 cases with BSI and WPI search queries spatially and temporally. The outbreak threshold time and peak time of H7N9-related BSI and WPI searches preceded H7N9 cases in most years. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models with BSI (\u03b2 = 0.008, p < 0.001) and WPI (\u03b2 = 0.002, p = 0.036) were used to predict the number of H7N9 cases. Regression tree model analysis showed that the average H7N9 cases increased by over 2.4-fold (26.8/11) when BSI for H7N9 was > = 11524. Both BSI and WPI data could be used as indicators to develop an early warning system for H7N9 outbreaks in the future.",

Human cases of H7N9 have had a winter-spring peak with high mortality rates (range: 34-47%) in the past five annual epidemics 2 . After the first H7H9 epidemic began in March 2013, the number of cases gradually decreased during the next three epidemics cycles. However, the epidemic in 2016-2017 was worse with 766 laboratory-confirmed cases observed, which accounted for 49.1% (766/1560) of total H7N9 cases reported from 2013-2017. The median incubation period of H7N9 cases (from exposure to disease onset) was six days 3 and the time from onset to disease confirmation was seven days 4 . After confirmation, the national health system receives the report from the hospital and then carries out measures to control epidemics. Therefore, traditional surveillance systems have a time lag of about two weeks. To prepare for the next epidemic and to provide a timely and effective response, a new approach for achieving near real-time detection of H7N9 cases and even prediction of emerging and spreading infectious outbreaks should be developed. Internet-based surveillance has the potential to achieve these goals.",

Internet-based disease surveillance has been widely suggested as a potential means to improve infectious disease surveillance 6 . Several infectious disease surveillance systems have been developed using internet search metrics to estimate incidence, including for influenza 7,8 (Google Flu Trends) and dengue 9 (Google Dengue Trends) 10 . Internet search metrics have also been applied in the monitoring and forecasting of emerging and re-emerging infections, including pandemic Ebola 11 and Zika 12 , etc.",

From March 2013 to December 2017, a total of 1,560 laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases were reported in China, with H7N9 cases being reported in 11 provinces in the wave 1 and 29 provinces in wave 5. The mean values of weekly BSI for search terms \"H7N9\", \"avian influenza\" and \"live poultry\" were 5,758.5, 7,429.2, and 5,497.8, respectively. The mean values of weekly WPI for the three keywords \"H7N9\", \"avian influenza\" and \"live poultry\" were 9601.9, 561.1, and 6017.4, respectively. Temporal trends of BSI and WPI for search term \"H7N9\" and H7N9 cases number are illustrated in Fig. 1 , panel A and panel B. H7N9 case number, BSI, and WPI all peaked between December to February and troughed from April to October (Fig. 1, panel C) . Figure 2 shows that H7N9 cases and BSI for search term \"H7N9\" during wave 1 were mainly concentrated in the Yangtze River Delta area. For waves 2 to 4, H7N9 cases and BSI for \"H7N9\" spread to include eastern China and southern China (Pearl River Delta area). For wave 5, H7N9 cases and BSI for \"H7N9\" spread across almost the whole country except the far west and north east. The Poisson log-linear regression model shows the H7N9 case and BSI spatial dispersion (change in longitude and latitude) in each of the epidemic waves (Table S1 ). The positive coefficients for longitude (eastward movement) and the negative coefficients for latitude www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (southward movement) indicate general consistency but some differences in the extent and direction of cases and BSI special dispersion in each of the five epidemic waves. BSI and WPI from two type platforms. The temporal and spatial trends in searching and posting of the term \"H7N9\" using personal computers (PC) and mobile devices are shown in Fig. S1 . Figure S1A shows that the temporal trends in the proportion of \"H7N9\" term searching and posting using mobile devices increased year by year, especially for Weibo. Figure S1B displays the provinces sorted by mobile usage ratio of BSI for H7N9 from high to low over the 5 year period. A linear regression model was then built by the sequence of mobile usage ratio and GDP ranking of provinces (Fig. S1C) 17 . The negative coefficient indicates that the lower GDP regions had a higher proportion of mobile device usage.",

We've also observed that the duration of the outbreak and the peak time of BSI and WPI for H7N9-related search terms preceded the occurrence of H7N9 cases in most epidemic waves, suggesting that BSI and WPI are potential indicators for the magnitude and duration of H7N9 epidemics. The reason why the beginning of the outbreak as indicated in BSI and WPI data during the fifth wave (2016-2017) did not occur before that H7N9 cases might be due to the over-reporting by the media or the fear-based search for the cases outbreak 21 .

The AUC of the ROC curve indicated that the sensitivity and specificity of BSI were higher than that of WPI. This may possibly be because compared with posting an opinion or discussion on the internet, more people may search for related information about the disease, which may enhance the sensitivity of the BSI. Other studies have used search engine data rather than social media data. However, our study also showed that data from social media, like Weibo, can improve the ability to predict H7N9 human infection. The regression tree model identified that the 0-week lagged BSI for H7N9 was a key predictor of the occurrence of H7N9 in China. A possible reason is that search engines are more popular and indispensable with the relatively unbiased user groups 23 . When the BSI volume is less than around 2000 searches per week, it can be defined as a non-epidemic, baseline period for H7N9 infection, more than 3000 is a warning period, and more than 10000 can be regarded as an outbreak period. This threshold provides an index reference to assess the potential risk of an outbreak based on to peoples' behaviour on the Internet and to predict the number of possible H7N9 cases.",

Second, the national geographical distribution of the WPI is not yet available, and it has not been included in this study. This study only describes the temporal and spatial consistency between H7N9 cases and the Internet search query results and explores their predictability.
