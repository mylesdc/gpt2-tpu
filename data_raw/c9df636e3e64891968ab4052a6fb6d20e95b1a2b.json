Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is a cellular protein participating in the splicing of pre-mRNA in the nucleus and translation regulation in the cytoplasm. According to our previous proteomic study about PEDV infection in vivo, hnRNP A1 was thought to be a cellular factor influencing PEDV replication. In this report, PEDV N protein was discovered to colocalize with cellular hnRNP A1 in perinuclear region of PEDV infected cells. Co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) results clearly demonstrated that PEDV N protein could bind to human hnRNP A1. Replication of PEDV was inhibited by silencing the expression of hnRNP A1 in CCL-81 cells, suggesting the positive effect of hnRNP A1 on PEDV infection.

Furthermore, N protein plays an important role in PEDV RNA synthesis and enhancing the PEDV transcription and virion assembly [8] [9] [10] . However, the effects of N protein on PEDV infection usually depend on its interaction with some host factors. For example, PEDV N protein binds with phosphoprotein nucleophosmin (NPM1) and then protects it from proteolytic degradation by caspase-3, enhancing cell survival and PEDV growth [11] . In addition, it has been proved that interaction between PEDV N protein and TBK1 could inhibit IRF3 activation and type I IFN production, further to causing the circumvention of the host's antiviral immunity [12] .",

This protein contains two RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and a glycine-rich domain responsible for protein-protein interaction [16, 17] . It has been reported that hnRNP A1 selectively interacts with different RNA-binding proteins through its glycine-rich domain [18] . Previous studies have demonstrated hnRNP A1 could interact with N proteins of SARS Coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [14, 19] .

Overexpression of hnRNPA1 facilitates MHV replication while inhibition of hnRNP A1 expression results in the reduction of MHV replication [26] . Since PEDV is also a member of coronavirus, hnRNP A1 may be involved in the process of PEDV infection. In order to test this hypothesis, we silenced the hnRNP A1 and then studied its effect on PEDV infection. Similar to the result of MHV following silencing hnRNP A1, replication of three PEDV strains were all inhibited, suggesting a positive effect of hnRNP A1 on PEDV infection. Replication of coronavirus depend on the generation of nested subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) with a common capped 5 leader sequence [28] . Optical transcription of sgmRNAs requires the interaction between its 5 leader sequence and the intergenic (IG) sequences of each ORF. It has been reported that hnRNP A1 can bind to both the 5 terminal leader sequences and IG sequences [29] . So, inhibition of PEDV by silencing hnRNP A1 is likely due to the break of the interaction between 5 terminal leader sequences and IG sequences. However, till now we have not got evidence to support it. In addition, silencing of hnRNP A1 might also be able to reduce its interaction with PEDV N protein. The function of their interaction on PEDV infection is under the investigation of our laboratory.",
