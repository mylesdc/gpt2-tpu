            "text": "Coronaviruses cause respiratory disease in humans that can range from mild to severe. However, the pathogenesis of pulmonary coronavirus infections is poorly understood. Mouse hepatitis virus type 1 (MHV-1) is a group 2 coronavirus capable of causing severe morbidity and mortality in highly susceptible C3H/HeJ mice. We have previously shown that both CD4 and CD8 T cells play a critical role in mediating MHV-1-induced disease. Here we evaluated the role of alveolar macrophages (AM) in modulating the adaptive immune response and subsequent disease. Depletion of AM using clodronate liposomes administered prior to MHV-1 infection was associated with a significant amelioration of MHV-1induced morbidity and mortality. AM depletion resulted in a decreased number of virus-specific CD4 T cells in the lung airways. In addition, a significant increase in the frequency and total number of Tregs in the lung tissue and lung airways was observed following MHV-1 infection in mice depleted of AM. Our results indicate that AM play a critical role in modulating MHV-1-induced morbidity and mortality.

We have previously identified six MHV-1-derived CD4 T cell epitopes in C3H mice [21] . Because the frequency of the responding CD4 T cells to any one of these epitopes is relatively low, we used a pool of all six epitopes to stimulate the CD4 T cells ex vivo. We observed a significant (p,0.05) decrease in the total number of MHV-1-specific IFN-c-producing CD4 T cells in the BAL of CL-treated mice as compared to PBS controls ( Figure 4C ).

Therefore, we questioned if an increase in Foxp3 + Tregs would account for this apparent discrepancy. We observed significant increases in the both frequency and total number of Foxp3 + CD4 T cells in the BAL (p,0.01) and the lungs (p,0.05) of the CLtreated mice at day 6 p.i. as compared to that of the PBS control mice ( Figure 6A, B) .

We have previously shown that C3H/HeJ mice are more susceptible than either BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice to an intranasal MHV-1 infection [17] . Our results indicate that MHV-1-induced morbidity and mortality is reduced in mice administered CL prior to infection as compared to PBS control mice. It is known that some strains of MHV can replicate within macrophages [25] . Therefore, it is possible that the protection we observe following AM depletion is due to the elimination of a population of potential viral target cells. This may explain why we observe a significant reduction in peak viral titers in CL-treated mice as compared to PBS controls. In contrast to our results, work by Luker et al. has shown that during a vaccinia virus infection, depletion of AM results in increased weight loss and viral replication [26] . Although vaccinia virus may also infect AM [26] , in the study by Luker et al. CL were administered intratracheally (i.t.) 2 days prior to infection [26] as compared to i.n. administration 6 hr prior to infection as we have done here, which may account for the differences in outcomes.",

Similar to our findings, SARS-CoV-infected mice quickly regain body weight. We demonstrate that depletion of AM prior to infection also results in reduced total numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the BAL of CL-treated mice as compared to PBS control mice. We also observe reduction in the total number of antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in CL-treated mice as compared to PBS control mice. However, in contrast to our results, AM depletion resulted in an increase in the total and SARS-CoV-specific T cell response in the lung tissue [29] . The differences between our results and those detailed above could be explained by the timing of CL administration.

In addition, morbidity and mortality of these mice were also unaffected. An increase in viral titers at the peak of infection was noted, but no significant differences were observed in viral clearance. Thus, it is clear that the timing of AM depletion and the viral system examined both contribute to the impact of AM depletion on a pulmonary viral infection.",

CD11c + F4/80 + macrophages were found to promote the generation of Foxp3 + iTregs through the expression of TGF-b and retinoic acid under steady state conditions [31] . Following allergen exposure, the AM lost their capacity to promote iTreg generation and converted to an inflammatory phenotype [31] . Work by Savage et al. also showed that Treg induction could be regulated by the activation state of AM. CD4 T cells exhibit a more functional suppressor phenotype after encounter with anti-inflammatory type 2 macrophages whereas pro-inflammatory type 1 macrophages promote proliferation in the presence of antigen [32] . These studies demonstrate the importance of AM and their role in controlling lung inflammation and influencing the generation of Tregs.",
