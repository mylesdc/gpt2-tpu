            "text": "Background: Synthetic virology is an important multidisciplinary scientific field, with emerging applications in biotechnology and medicine, aiming at developing methods to generate and engineer synthetic viruses. In particular, many of the RNA viruses, including among others the Dengue and Zika, are widespread pathogens of significant importance to human health. The ability to design and synthesize such viruses may contribute to exploring novel approaches for developing vaccines and virus based therapies. Results: Here we develop a full multidisciplinary pipeline for generation and analysis of synthetic RNA viruses and specifically apply it to Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2). The major steps of the pipeline include comparative genomics of endogenous and synthetic viral strains. Specifically, we show that although the synthetic DENV-2 viruses were found to have lower nucleotide variability, their phenotype, as reflected in the study of the AG129 mouse model morbidity, RNA levels, and neutralization antibodies, is similar or even more pathogenic in comparison to the wildtype master strain. Additionally, the highly variable positions, identified in the analyzed DENV-2 population, were found to overlap with less conserved homologous positions in Zika virus and other Dengue serotypes. These results may suggest that synthetic DENV-2 could enhance virulence if the correct sequence is selected. Conclusions: The approach reported in this study can be used to generate and analyze synthetic RNA viruses both on genotypic and on phenotypic level. It could be applied for understanding the functionality and the fitness effects of any set of mutations in viral RNA and for editing RNA viruses for various target applications.",

Its genome is a positive polarity, single stranded RNA of approximately 11 kb composed of three parts: the unique coding sequence (CDS) that produces 10 mature viral proteins via a single precursor polyprotein, and two flanking untranslated regions (UTRs) that contain important structural and functional elements [15] [16] [17] . Since dengue is an important human pathogen, widely recognized as a major public health concern [18] , new insights into its biological and evolutionary properties including its wildtype and synthetically generated strains may have significant influence on the development of new antiviral vaccines and therapies. The Zika virus (ZIKV), also of the flavivirus genus, is closely related to DENV and was recently classified as a public health emergency of international concern due to recent outbreaks [19, 20] . The DENV and ZIKV genomes encode three structural proteins (capsid, precursor membrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [21, 22] .",

The resulting sequence was used as a master sequence to generate synthetic variants. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the reported results two different approaches were examined: (1) in-cellulo construction of subgenomic infectious amplicons ( Fig. 1 III) , and (2) PCR assembly of full-length infectious DNA ( Fig.  1 IV) . After three passages of the wildtype and synthetic DENV-2 viruses in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1 V) , viral RNA was extracted and next generation sequencing was performed (NGS; Fig. 1 VI) . The resulting sequences were verified and analysis of genomic variants was performed, with respect to single nucleotide variations (SNV) and inserts (Variants Calling; Fig. 1 VII) . The results were compared to a population sample of 2004 available DENV-1/2/3/4 and ZIKV genomes (see details in Methods; Fig. 1 VIII-IV) with respect to several genomic features: nucleotide variability, secondary structure, codon and codon pair bias, CpG and GC contents. In addition, the wildtype and synthetic viruses (generated by the assembly method) were compared in vivo in the AG129 mouse model ( Fig. 1 X) ; the comparison included: weight change, survival rates, RNA levels, and neutralizing antibodies (Ab).

As expected, the majority of the variations were found to be synonymous (72%). SNVs at positions 3708 and 5061 are substitutions (VAF = 1), the others (VAF < 1) may indicate polymorphisms within the population (panels \"SNVs\" and \"VAF\"). These polymorphisms may be related either to errors in viral replication [23] or to sequencing errors (for very low VAF), and may play a role in improving the fitness of the WT virus [23] [24] [25] . Seven significant SNVs (VAF \u2265 15% that also passed PB and SB filters) were marked by red asterisks. Further, the positions of the CDS SNVs were compared to the population sample consisting of 618 available DENV-2 genomes (see Methods for additional details). In particular relations to regions with significantly strong / weak RNA structures ( [16] and Methods) and to position-wise nucleotide variability (\"variability\" panel) were analyzed. Specifically: 14 out of 32 (44%) of SNVs in CDS were found to overlap with regions that undergo a conserved selection for strong or weak mRNA folding, although this overlap is not statistically significant with respect to random (p-value = 0.14, see Methods); this result suggests that only some of the SNVs are related to secondary structures and may influence the viral fitness via the effect on the RNA folding. Moreover, no accord between the SNVs and the nucleotide variability at the corresponding positions in the alignment of the population sample (quantified by normalized entropy, see Methods) was found (i.e. SNV's do not tend to appear in more or less conserved positions). Also, Spearman correlation between variant frequencies derived from the NGS data and the frequencies of these variants observed in the population sample at SNV positions was found to be low/insignificant (rho = 0.16, p-value = 0.38). These results may demonstrate that the variability at the population level is a dynamic trait and may differ both at different stages of the replication cycle within the same host and across different hosts.",

The nucleotide variability at SNV positions is based on a set of 618 aligned DENV2 genomes, represented by the corresponding sequence logo in the \"variability\" panel. The coordinates of SNVs are specified in the x-axis; corresponding genes are specified in the bottom row. The variability at each position is represented by a stack of letters. The relative sizes of the letters indicate their frequency in the alignment at specific position, where the total height of the letters depicts the information content of the position in bits. The SNVs at each position are depicted in the \"SNVs\" panel in the following format: reference codon (reference AA) \u2192 variant codon (variant AA). The altered nucleotides are marked in red. The variant allele frequencies (VAF) at each position were specified in the \"VAF\" panel. Non-synonymous SNVs (18%) were marked by \"N\". Positions that overlap with regions that undergo a conserved selection for strong or weak mRNA folding (based on [16] ) were marked by \"s\" or \"w\" respectively. Seven CDS SNVs with VAF of at least 0.15 that also passed Position Bias and Strand Bias filters were marked by red asterisks Codons), Codon Pairs Bias (CPB), CpG Content (CpG), and GC Content (GC) (see Methods). Various studies relate these features to different genomic mechanisms, which take part in the viral replication cycle and are related to the viral fitness. For example, it was suggested that viral codons may be under selection to improve the translation efficiency, among others, via adaptation to the host tRNA pool (or other translation resources; e.g., [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] ). It was also suggested that translation efficiency is affected not only by single codons, but also by distribution of codon pairs (although it is debated whether this feature is under a direct selection or can be a consequence of distribution of dinucleotides [39] [40] [41] [42] . In refs [43] [44] [45] it was shown that CpG pairs are underrepresented in many RNA and most small human DNA viruses, in correspondence to dinucleotide frequencies of their hosts. This phenomenon can be related, for example, to the contribution of the CpG stacking basepairs to RNA folding [46] and/or to the enhanced innate immune responses to viruses with elevated CpG [47] . The stability of the RNA secondary structures can also be affected by the genomic GC content [48] . By analyzing local genomic regions of 100 codons we found that regions surrounding the positions of SNVs were characterized by a significantly lower CpG content (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p-value = 0.004) compared to regions of the same size that didn't contain any SNV (Fig. 5) . As was explained above, the higher mutation rates in the CpG suppressed regions may be associated with a stronger evolutionary pressure, possibly related to RNA folding or to the interaction with the immune system. However, we did not find any significant differences between the SNV and non-SNV regions with respect to the rest of the analyzed features (see Additional file 1, section 1).",

Second, the synthetic variants can be analyzed based on comparative genomics tools; this includes the comparisons of the variants to each other and to WT genomes. Among others, this study demonstrates the interactions between comparative genomics and other research tools in synthetic virology. Specifically, we report here for the first time a set of SNVs that appear in a master wildtype DENV-2 virus in comparison to its synthetic constructs. In general, the wildtype virus was found to have a higher genomic variability (i.e. more nucleotide variations) than its synthetic strains. It is known that the population of viral variants is important for its fitness [24, 25] ; thus, this analysis demonstrates an approach for connecting viral fitness to the structure of its population.",

Also, infection with the synthetic virus resulted in higher serum viral RNA titers (as measured 3 dpi) and more consistent and high levels of neutralizing Ab (as measured 14 dpi) as compared to infection with the wildtype DENV-2. These findings may be related to the already mentioned fact that the synthetic virus includes lower levels of genomic sequence variability. RNA viruses are often defined as quasispecies [50] , collections of closely related mutant spectra or mutant clouds. The fact that a virus exists as a 'cloud' of closely related genomes constitutes an evolutionary advantage, among others by enabling the virus to efficiently adjust to different hosts or cells. Therefore, higher level of variability in the wildtype virus may improve its replication rate in hosts such as Vero cells (the origin of the investigated wildtype virus) and/or humans/A. aegypti, but on the other hand, decrease its fitness/ replication rate in mice. It is also possible that the wildtype virus undergoes a direct selection for reduced virulence (among others this may be related to its variability) which actually increases its transmissibility and fitness [51] .",

Coordinates of the different genomic features (ORFs/UTRs) were obtained from DENV2 reference strain NC_001474.2 and aligned to the genomes used in this study. Multiple alignments of 618 DENV2 coding regions (i.e. DENVs population sample), and regions with conserved selection for strong or weak mRNA folding were computed as in [16] . In addition, we performed multiple alignments of all the 4 dengue serotypes combined with the Zika (population samples of 1672 and 332, respectively). Briefly, the translated amino acid sequences corresponding to the coding regions were aligned using the Clustal Omega package (version 1.2.0) with default parameters [56] and then mapped backed to the nucleotide sequences basing on the original nucleotide composition of each coding region. Multiple alignment conservation scores were defined as an average sum-of-pair score (SP; see Additional file 1, section 2). The accession numbers of the analyzed genomes can be found in Additional file 2.",

These profiles were compared to folding profiles of corresponding randomized variants preserving different genomic features of the wildtype sequences which are not necessarily directly related to mRNA folding: amino acid order and content, (\"vertical\") distribution of synonymous codons at each position in the alignment, frequency of di-nucleotides. As a result, regions with positions that undergo a significantly conserved (across different genomes) selection at the synonymous/silent level for weak/strong mRNA folding (MFE-selected regions) were identified. More details, including the coordinates of the identified regions with significant folding signals, can be found in ref. [16] and in Additional file 1 (section 7).",

On the other hand, in our case, 14 out of 32 SNV positions overlap with some MFE-selected region. In order to compare this number with what is expected in random under a Uniform distribution hypothesis we calculate the Hyper-geometric p-value: Let N (Population size) = 10,176 (total DENV2 CDS length); Successes in population (K) = 3368 (The total length of MFE -selected regions); Sample Size (n) = 32 (number of CDS SNV positions); Successes in Sample (k) = 14 (number of SNV positions that overlap with MFE-selected regions).
