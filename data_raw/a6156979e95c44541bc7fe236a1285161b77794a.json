Well-characterized multiplexed serologic assays are needed to aid in rapid detection and surveillance of hCoVs. the present study describes development and evaluation of a multiplexed magnetic microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) to simultaneously detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies specific for recombinant nucleocapsid proteins (recN) from hCoVs 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. We used paired human sera to screen for IgG with reactivity against six hCoVs to determine assay sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility. We found no signal interference between monoplex and multiplex assay formats (R 2 range = 0.87-0.97). Screening of paired human sera using MMIA, resulted in 92 of 106 (sensitivity: 86%) as positive and 68 of 80 (specificity: 84%) as negative. This study serves as a proof of concept that it is feasible to develop and use a multiplexed microsphere immunoassay as a next generation screening tool for use in large scale seroprevalence studies of hCoVs.",

Following this outbreak, hCoV-NL63 (Alphacoronavirus) and hCoV-HKU1 (Betacoronavirus) 6 were identified as sources of upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections in hospitalized patients 7 .

However, traditional plate ELISAs are limited to detecting IgG antibodies to a single hCoV recN antigen per well. In contrast, a magnetic bead-based multiplexed immunoassay (MMIA) would allow for the simultaneous detection of IgG antibodies to all six hCoV recN in a single test well, reducing sample consumption. In addition, multiplexing would allow higher sample throughput at lower reagent, labor, and material costs, without losing sensitivity and specificity of traditional ELISAs.

            "text": "A perfect test has an AUC of 1 and a useless test has an area of 0.5, the equivalent of a coin toss. Based on arbitrary criteria, the following guidelines have been suggested for interpretation of AUC values in context of test accuracy: low (0.5 < AUC \u2264 0.7), moderate (0.7 < AUC \u2264 0.9), and high (0.9 < AUC \u2264 1) 15 . Based on our assay test results, the calculated AUC ranged from 0.87 to 0.94, suggesting a high to high-moderate levels of accuracy and overall assay performance. The cross reactivity experiment results showed positive control of SARS-CoV reacting with group 1 hCoVs 229E and NL63 recN. A major limitation of these assays is that we are unable to distinguish the difference between cross reactivity and evidence of previous infections. SARS-CoV recN has been shown to react with polyclonal antisera of group 1 coronaviruses in a western blot analysis 16 . However, this cross reactivity was one-way from SARS-CoV to other hCoV recN in this study which has also been previously confirmed by Che et al., in a separate study 17 . The multiple sequence identity matrix of all hCoV nucleocapsid protein sequences show amino acid homology ranging from 20% to 63% (data not shown). In contrast, group 1 hCoVs showed only 20% to 22% sequence homology with group 2 hCoVs which explains the lack of detectable cross-reactivity between these two antigenic groups. However, sequence homology was high between nucleocapsid sequences of OC43 and HKU1 (%) and that of HKU1 and MERS-CoV (%). Higher percentage of nucleocapsid protein sequence homology may indicate the shared epitopes in the conserved and/or overlapping regions between hCoVs of the same antigenic groups. Since the previous hCoV infection history of patients enrolled in the study was unavailable, dual infection with OC43 and HKU1 could also have contributed to the cross-reactivity, though that is unlikely for HKU1 and MERS-CoV. Our hCoV MMIA offers high throughput testing at reduced cost; the assay can be completed in less time with less labor using less clinical specimen and assay reagents. Moreover, MMIA allows the flexibility of mixing and matching the bead sets depending upon the analysis requirements. Overall, the results of our study showed that development of a bead-based multiplex immunoassay for screening human sera for IgG antibodies against hCoV recN proteins is feasible and may serve as an effective tool for large scale seroprevalence studies such as examining prevalence of hCoVs in young children of different ages.

Paired acute and convalescent phase human sera collected from individuals whose respiratory specimens were tested positive for hCoV-229E (n = 4), hCoV-NL63 (N = 9), hCoV-OC43 (n = 21), and hCoV-HKU1 (n = 14), by rRT-PCR, were included in a positive control panel for the study. Human sera from patients with confirmed SARS-CoV (n = 5) and MERS-CoV infections (n = 7), tested during outbreak investigation by our laboratory, were also included to the positive control panel. Acute sera were collected upon hospital admission, and convalescent phase sera were obtained 3-7 weeks later. From this panel of positive sera, convalescent phase sera exhibiting \u2265 4 fold increase in IgG titers, were pooled together to create a positive control for each hCoV recN. Similarly, acute and convalescent phase human sera, collected from individuals with acute respiratory illness whose respiratory specimens tested negative for all six hCoVs by real-time RT-PCR and exhibited no IgG reactivity when screened by in-house hCoV recN enzyme immunoassays, were included to create a negative control panel.",

To prepare a working dilution, each bead set was diluted in PBS (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 50 beads/region/\u00b5l of PBS (pH7.4). All diluted bead sets were then mixed into a single 15 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube in equal quantities. The 15 ml centrifuge tube was vortexed and sonicated as described above to create homogeneous mixture of all conjugated bead sets. All the test sera were diluted to an optimal dilution and tested in duplicate. To perform multiplexed bead immunoassay, 50 \u00b5l of homogeneous mixture of conjugated beads, 50 \u00b5l of diluted test serum sample and 50 \u00b5l of PBS (pH 7.4), were added to each of the well of the plate.

Recombinant antigens were expressed by IPTG induction in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells, and were purified by metal affinity chromatography (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blots. eLIsA. The positive and negative control human sera panels were first tested by in-house hCoV recN ELISAs to determine titers of IgG antibodies against individual hCoV recN. All human sera were initially tested in duplicate at 1:200 followed by titration at a 4-fold dilution range of 1:100 to 1:6400. In house indirect ELISAs for recN have been developed and standardized for screening of serum samples for IgG reactivity against hCoV-229E recN, hCoV-NL63 recN, hCoV-HKU1 recN and MERS-CoV recN, using modified version of previously described indirect ELISAs for SARS-CoV recN and hCoV-OC43 recN3 (Haynes et al.,18 ; Blanchard et al.,19 ). Briefly, 96-well transparent flat bottom Immulon 2HB microtiter plates (Thermo Scientific, Rochester, NY) were coated with purified hCoV-229E recN (6.75 ng/well), hCoV-NL63 recN (5 ng/well), hCoV-OC43 recN3(25 ng/well), hCoV-HKU1 recN (40 ng/well), MERS-CoV recN (40 ng/well) or SARS-CoV recN (12.5 ng/well) and negative control antigens pET E. coli (5.0-40 ng/well) or His-BoNT (12.5 ng/well), diluted in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and incubated overnight at 2-8 \u00b0C. The next day, plates were washed three times with 150 \u00b5l of PBS-T (PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20), and incubated with serum dilutions prepared in PBS-T-M (PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 5% skim milk) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Following incubations, the plates were washed three times in PBS-T and incubated with 1:4000 dilution of HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H + L, KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) prepared in PBS-T-M for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Following incubation, plates were washed three times with 150 \u00b5l of PBS-T, and incubated with ABTS \u00ae peroxidase substrate (2,2-azino-di-(3-et hylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate)) (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding ABTS \u00ae peroxidase stop solution (5% sodium dodecyl sulfate) and the optical density (OD) measured at 405/490 nm using a TECAN Infinity microplate reader (Mannedof, Switzerland).

For 1X scale conjugation reaction, 1.25 \u00d7 10 6 of monodispersed beads from each bead set were washed in PBS (pH 7.4). The washed beads were activated by incubation in 100 \u03bcl of activation buffer (provided with the kit) containing freshly prepared 10 \u00b5l of 50 mg/ml N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt (sulfo-NHS) (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) and 10 \u03bcl of 50 mg/ml 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethlyaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (Pierce) for 20 min at room temperature in the dark with continuous shaking. The activated beads were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4). Coupling was performed by suspending the activated beads in 500 \u03bcl of PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1.0 \u00b5g, 2.5 \u00b5g, or 5.0 \u00b5g of hCoV recN or its corresponding negative control antigen and incubation for 2 h at room temperature in dark with continuous shaking. The covalently linked beads were washed once with 500 \u03bcl PBS (pH 7.4), resuspended in 250 \u00b5lStabiliGuard02 (SG02) \u00ae (Surmodics Inc., Minneapolis, MN), and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h in the dark with continuous shaking. Finally, the beads were magnetically separated and resuspended in 150 \u00b5l of SG02, enumerated using a hemocytometer and stored at 2-8 \u00b0C in the dark until use. recN Monoplex Immunoassay. All recN conjugated bead sets, 229E recN #78), NL63 recN (#20), OC43 recN3(#65), HKU1 recN(#44), MERS-CoV recN (#72,) SARS-CoV recN (#26), pET E. coli Neg ctrl (#12 and His-BoNT Neg ctrl (#12) were brought to room temperature prior to performing the monoplex immunoassay. Beads were vortexed for 30 sec and then sonicated in a water bath sonicator (Branson ultrasonic cleaner, VWR International, West Chester, PA) for 20 sec. Each bead set was diluted in PBS (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 100 beads/region/\u00b5l of PBS (pH7.4). A series of 2-fold dilutions (1:100-1:800) of positive and negative control sera were prepared in SurModics \u00ae Assay Diluent (cat#SM01-1000; SurModics, MN). In a black, 96 well, non-binding microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Germany), 50 \u00b5l of diluted beads (100 beads/region/\u00b5l) and 50 \u00b5l of diluted control serum, were mixed using microtiter pipette. An additional 50 \u00b5l of PBS (pH 7.4) was added to each of the well of the plate. The plate was covered with aluminum foil and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with continuous shaking at speed 7 on titer plate shaker (Lab-Line Instruments, USA). Following incubation, the beads were separated using magnetic plate separator (Luminex \u00ae ) for 60 sec and washed twice with 150 \u00b5l PBS (pH 7.4) using multichannel pipette. The washed beads were resuspended in 50 \u00b5L of PBS (pH 7.4) plus 50 \u00b5L of R-Phycoerythrin (R-PE) conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H + L) F (ab\u2032) 2 (cat#109-116-088; JacksonImmuno, USA) antibody. The detection antibody was prepared by diluting R-PE to 1:120 (v/v) in PBS. The plate was covered with aluminum foil and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with continuous shaking at speed 7 on titer plate shaker (Lab-Line Instruments, USA). Beads were separated and washed twice with 100 \u00b5L of PBS (pH 7.4) and finally resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of PBS (pH 7.4). The plate was read on Luminex \u00ae MAGPIX \u00ae system. The Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) values of negative control antigen conjugated beads were subtracted from MFI values of their corresponding hCoV recN antigens. The results were expressed as MFI of 200 beads/region/well.",
