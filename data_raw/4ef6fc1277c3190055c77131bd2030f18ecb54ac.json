It emerged in 2002 and its aetiological agent, the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), crossed the species barrier to infect humans, showing high morbidity and mortality rates. No vaccines are currently licensed for SARS-CoV and important efforts have been performed during the first outbreak to develop diagnostic tools. Here we demonstrate the transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana of two important antigenic determinants of the SARS-CoV, the nucleocapsid protein (N) and the membrane protein (M) using a virus-derived vector or agro-infiltration, respectively. For the M protein, this is the first description of production in plants, while for plantderived N protein we demonstrate that it is recognized by sera of patients from the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003. The availability of recombinant N and M proteins from plants opens the way to further evaluation of their potential utility for the development of diagnostic and protection/therapy tools to be quickly manufactured, at low cost and with minimal risk, to face potential new highly infectious SARS-CoV outbreaks.",

Transient expression of target proteins can be easily achieved by plant viruses or by agroinfiltration (Gleba et al., 2007) , saving the time spent in the generation of transgenic plants, often allowing higher protein yield due to the absence of chromosomal integration and consequently of position effects (Komarova et al., 2010) . Transient expression can also be used as a means for preliminary evaluation of correct expression before starting the generation of transgenic plants, or related platforms, such as plant cell cultures or microalgae (Franconi et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "Antigen preparation plays a crucial role in the development of a diagnostic test, and plants represent an ideal biofactory system. The approach could be extended to other cases when a pathogen cannot be grown in the lab or is highly virulent and needs a methodology for fast and affordable production. Indeed, virus-specific and 'orphan' vaccine candidates and therapeutics represent one of the most interesting applications of the plant-based technology, especially when it is necessary to produce 'rapid response' vaccines such as those directed against bioterrorism agents and diseases with pandemic potential, like influenza. The capacity for such a response has already been demonstrated by the (four) companies involved in the US in the production of 100 million doses of influenza vaccine a month (Rybicki, 2014) . This opens the way for the use of this technology for other diseases such as, to name a few, Ebola (Henao-Restrepo et al., 2015; Heymann et al., 2015) , avian flu (Su et al., 2015) , MERS (Al-Tawfiq and Memish, 2015; Keener, 2015) and other viruses where the principles of the so-called \"One Health Initiative\" (strategies to control diseases across species) are important (http://www.onehealthinitiative.com/). The fact that the epidemiology of these diseases is associated to sudden and sometimes unforeseen contagious burst, results in an on/off attention about, in terms of research, prevention and pharma industry efforts (Barber, 2014; LaMattina, 2014) . For this reason, tools for a quick and relatively easy scale-up may provide a solution to such emergencies (Streatfield et al., 2015) .",

The epidemic spread to 29 countries over 5 continents, leading to more than 8000 infected patients globally (World Health Organization [WHO] , 2006) with a fatality rate of 9.6% (Suresh et al., 2008) . The aetiological agent of the syndrome, the coronavirus SARS-CoV, was rapidly identified (Drosten et al., 2003; Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . The end of the SARS outbreak was declared by World Health Organization [WHO] (2003) in July, thanks to strong containment measures. However, several local outbreaks were subsequently reported in China, as a consequence of accidental laboratory contaminations or infections after contact with animals infected with SARS-CoV strains significantly different from those predominating in the 2002-2003 outbreak (Peiris et al., 2004) . While no effective therapy is currently available, considerable efforts have been made to develop vaccines and drugs to prevent SARS-CoV infection, since a SARS epidemic may recur at any time in the future (Gimenez et al., 2009; Chan and Chan, 2013) . Moreover, because of the highly contagious nature of the disease, and since SARS-CoV has been defined a potential biological weapon (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] , 2012), it is still important to develop effective SARS-CoV sensitive diagnostic tools (Suresh et al., 2008) .",

It is a highly basic protein of 422 amino acids (46 kDa) of the helical nucleocapsid, playing an important role in viral pathogenesis, replication, RNA binding, cell cytokinesis and proliferation (Surjit and Lal, 2008) . N protein has been recognized as the preferred target for detection of SARS-CoV infection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; Suresh et al., 2008) . In addition, the WHO guidelines for SARS diagnosis, developed during the outbreak in 2003, suggested the use of N-based ELISA for specific IgG detection as confirmatory test of SARS-CoV infection (World Health Organization [WHO] , 2003 SARS: Laboratory diagnostic tests) due to the ability of the host to mount an early antibody response against the N protein (Che et al., 2004) . Furthermore, since the N protein is able to induce a long-term cell-mediated immune response in animal models, it represents a potential vaccine candidate as well (Roper and Rehm, 2009) . To date, the production of recombinant N protein has been achieved in a variety of heterologous expression systems, including plants, (Zheng et al., 2009) , providing proofs of concept for its use in vaccine formulations (Roper and Rehm, 2009 ). However, the immune response in animal models (both natural and nonnatural SARS-CoV hosts) might be not useful to predict the human immune response.",

It consists of 221 amino acids (25 kDa), with a short glycosylated N-terminal domain, three membrane-spanning domains and a long immunogenic C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. It has been reported that rabbit antiserum raised against recombinant M protein produced in yeast has a potent neutralizing activity in vitro (Pang et al., 2004) . Antibodies to the M protein were detectable in convalescent SARS patients and B-cell epitopes of the M protein have been identified (He et al., 2005) . It has also been shown that M acts as a dominant immunogen for CTL response in humans (Liu et al., 2010) . Moreover, it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV M-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were persistent in the peripheral blood of recovered SARS patients more than 1 year after infection . In a study, where different DNA vaccines were used, M generated the strongest T-cell response in an animal model, and recovered SARS patients had a long-lasting CD4+ and CD8+ memory for the M antigen (Roper and Rehm, 2009) . These data suggest that further research should be directed toward evaluating the potential efficacy of the M antigen for vaccine and diagnostic tools development.",

Here, to evaluate SARS-positive sera reactivity with N plant expressed protein, we used a 'multi-strip' western blot assay.

N. benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with A. tumefaciens suspensions (strains C58 and GV3101) harboring the pBI binary vector containing the M gene (pBI-M vector, Figure 6A ). With this simple technology, and without the use of any post-transcriptional gene silencing suppressors, we were able to detect SARS-CoV M protein production in plant. The time course experiment revealed that the M protein is expressed mainly at 4 and 5 dpi (data not shown). For immunoblotting analysis, the M protein was extracted with an appropriate buffer (GB buffer) and, since it was previously reported that boiling causes M protein aggregation and precipitation (Lee et al., 2005) , samples boiling was avoided. Interestingly, the M protein accumulated almost totally in the soluble fraction of the plant extract ( Figure 6B ). As described in the previous paragraph for the N protein, to better characterize the plant-derived M protein we worked, at the same time, on M protein expression in bacteria and mammalian cells. Due to toxic properties of M protein for E. coli (Carattoli et al., 2005) , we performed colony selection and M protein expression under sub-optimal growth conditions (30 \u2022 C). In this way, the M protein, with a mass of about 25 kDa was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography in denaturing conditions, obtaining yields of about 100 \u00b5g/l culture (data not shown). DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence in the M gene of three spontaneous point mutations: R 13 > K in the N-terminal domain, L 36 > F in the first transmembrane domain and V 160 > I in the cytoplasmic domain (M RLV ). As the plant-derived recombinant M protein, the M RLV was also specifically recognized by the mouse anti-M pAb ( Figure 6C ) that had previously validated by Immunofluorescence Antibody Assay (IFA) in SARS CoV infected Vero cells (Carattoli et al., 2005) . Although we were not able to express the M protein with its original aa sequence in bacteria, the M RLV protein was useful as standard for the plant-produced M protein characterization. Immunoblotting revealed that, contrary to prokaryotic cells, the plant system allowed the expression of the full-length M protein, especially by the use of the Agrobacterium C58C1 strain ( Figure 6B) . The M protein yield, calculated by immunoblotting using the quantified M RLV protein purified from E. coli as standard, was estimated to be 0.1-0.15% TSP. The mobility of the plant-derived M protein in SDS-PAGE was reduced compared to the mutated bacterial form (Figure 6C) , suggesting a higher molecular mass of plant-expressed compared to the E. coliexpressed M protein.",

A synthetic gene with optimized codons has been expressed in E. coli at high yield (Das and Suresh, 2006) but it was demonstrated that bacterially expressed N protein produces false seropositivity owing to interference of bacterially derived antigens (Leung et al., 2006; Yip et al., 2007; Surjit and Lal, 2008) or cross-reacts with antisera of human coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E)-infected patients (Woo et al., 2004 ). An interesting study correlated the phosphorylation state of the N protein with its antigenicity and specificity of antibodies recognition (Shin et al., 2007) . These data underline the importance of producing the recombinant protein in eukaryotic platforms such as insect cells, yeast, or plants to set up more efficient and specific diagnostic tests. To date, it was demonstrated that the N protein produced in insect cells may be useful for the development of highly sensitive and specific assays to determine SARS infection (Shin et al., 2007) . Later, the N protein was transiently expressed in plant by agroinfiltration, and its antigenicity was demonstrated in mice (Zheng et al., 2009 ) giving a proof of concept of its use in vaccine formulations. Previously, the S1 domain of SARS-CoV S protein had been stably expressed in tomato and low-nicotine tobacco plants obtaining about 0.1% TSP (Pogrebnyak et al., 2005) . The plant-derived antigen was able to induce systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice.",

In addition to the knowledge that the M protein elicits a strong humoral responses, and that a specific humoral and cellular immune response can be obtained by co-expressing S, M and E (Lu et al., 2007) , it has been demonstrated that the M protein also contains T cell epitopes (Liu et al., 2010) .

These results demonstrate the stability of the construct, a condition not easily obtained especially when large sequences are inserted in the pPVX-derived expression cassette (the N gene is about 1300 bp). In fact, several studies report that the use of 'first generation' plant viral vectors (like the pPVX series) for the expression of proteins in plants can lead to insert elimination by natural selection over replication cycles as early as the first infection passage with a positive correlation between insert length and elimination rate (Avesani et al., 2007) .",
