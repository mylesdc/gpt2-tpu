As most (re-)emerging viral infections originate from animal sources, it is important to obtain insight into viral pathogens present in the wildlife reservoir from a public health perspective. When monitoring living, free-ranging wildlife for viruses, sample collection can be challenging and availability of nucleic acids isolated from samples is often limited. The development of viral metagenomics platforms allows a more comprehensive inventory of viruses present in wildlife. We report a metagenomic viral survey of the Western Arctic herd of barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) in Alaska, USA. The presence of mammalian viruses in eye and nose swabs of 39 free-ranging caribou was investigated by random amplification combined with a metagenomic analysis approach that applied exhaustive iterative assembly of sequencing results to define taxonomic units of each metagenome. Through homology search methods we identified the presence of several mammalian viruses, including different papillomaviruses, a novel parvovirus, polyomavirus, and a virus that potentially represents a member of a novel genus in the family Coronaviridae.",

            "text": "Barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) is a wildliving subspecies of reindeer in Alaska and Canada. The Western Arctic caribou herd (WACH) in Alaska is the largest caribou herd in North America, occupying the northwestern part of the state. The size of the WACH reached a population apex of ,490,000 individuals in 2003, but has declined to ,325,000 animals in 2011, which was likely due to varying climate conditions, population density, predation, and disease outbreaks, or a combination of these factors. The WACH follows general movement patterns for each season of the year ranging over a 140,000 square mile area bounded by the Arctic Ocean, lower Yukon River, and the trans-Alaska pipeline. In spring, mature cows travel north to the calving grounds, and bulls and immature cows move north-west to the summer range. After calving, cows and calves travel west to join the remainder of the herd. By fall the herd is most dispersed and starts migrating southwest to the winter grounds. The caribou are an integral part of the ecology and sociology of the circumpolar North and since 2000, an estimated 10,000-15,000 Western Arctic caribou have been killed each year for subsistence within the range of the herd (Alaska state department). Caribou represent a wildlife reservoir for viruses that can be transmitted to semi-domesticated reindeer (R. t. tarandus), and in some cases possibly also to other wild ruminants [1] . Since 1996, the WACH expanded their seasonal migratory routes, embracing the eastern half of Seward Peninsula and westwards, where caribou had been absent for more than 150 years [2] . This has increased the contact with herded reindeer, which to a large extent have out-migrated with the caribou. Both the caribou and the reindeer herds are free-ranging. Interaction and interbreeding between wild and semi-domesticated reindeer species is common and has also occurred in Alaska (Hunderdtmark and Groves, unpublished data).",

This baseline knowledge is relevant, especially if diseased animals are identified or if epizootics appear. Knowledge on virus infections in caribou, and especially the WACH with its contact to reindeer herding on the Seward Peninsula, is crucial, because diseases may play a role in the declining population, and also because some viruses are expected to be transmitted between reindeer/caribou and other ruminant species. Few studies have been conducted to try to identify viruses in caribou through isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or metagenomic surveys [4] . Random amplification of nucleic acids and next-generation sequencing with metagenomics analyses has been successful in recent years in identifying new viruses from wild animals [5] [6] [7] . However, the availability and volume of samples obtained from living wild animals is often limited and viral loads in samples may be low, allowing only few virus characterization steps beyond the metagenomic assay. By optimally assembling sequences in metagenomic studies, the likelihood of identifying and characterizing viral genomes could potentially be increased.",

Whether two reads originate from the same gene as an entity is depending on many factors; abundance of the organism in the sample, size and copy number of the gene in the original sample [8, 9] , effectiveness of enrichment strategies [10] , amplification biases introduced during random amplification [11] [12] [13] , biases inherent to next-generation sequencing protocols [14] , and depth of sequencing and read lengths [15] . In theory, two reads of the same taxonomic unit should be assembled into a single contig if they have sufficient overlap. Most assemblers are designed for single genome assemblies and therefore identify highly covered regions as possible repeats rather than highly abundant organisms within a metagenomic sample [16] or regions with a highly uneven coverage across the genome [12] . In addition, sequence diversity as present in a population of pathogens might hamper successful assembly, and some reports recommend that metagenomic datasets should not be assembled at all [17] .",

To obtain insight in the performance of different assembly strategies, the percentage of reads that was assembled into contigs (as opposed to ''singletons'') was compared for each of the samples with different assembly algorithms ( Figure 2 ). Between 664 and 43 702 trimmed reads per sample were obtained from the caribou nose and eye swabs (Table S1 ). All reads were trimmed with Newbler and subjected to either a single de novo assembly with Newbler, CAP3, Mira, or a de Bruijn graph algorithm (CLC Genomic workbench assembler). The fifth method was composed of an initial assembly with Newbler, after which contigs and singletons were pooled and subjected to exhaustive iterative assembly with CAP3 until convergence of the assembly (''Iterative'') ( Figure 2 and Figure S1 ). Finally, exhaustive iterative assembly was combined with mapping of the trimmed reads with GSMapper to the contigs and singletons that were the result of the converged iterative assembly (Figure 2 and Figure S1 ). While the exhaustive iterative assembly approach with mapping had significantly more reads assembled than Newbler alone (Mann-Whitney test, one-tailed, paired, p = 2.512 e-14) and Mira (p = 1.256 e-14), this is not the case for assembly with CLC Genomics Workbench, CAP3, or for exhaustive iterative assembly without mapping ( Figure 2) . Thus, the exhaustive iterative assembly approach with or without mapping and CLC Genomics Workbench seems to give the best results in terms of compression of the output for homology searches. In other words, the amount of taxonomic units that needed analyses through homology searches was reduced significantly (Figure 2 ).",

However, taxonomic units from 10 samples that were identified as a fragment of putative L1 proteins were used to estimate the closest relative within the family Papillomaviridae (Table 1) by determining their closest homolog. Putative L1 taxonomic units from five nose swabs, but none from eye swabs, had a closest relative with human papillomaviruses with a nucleotide similarity between 75%-100% (not included in Table 1 ). The remaining five samples (three eye swabs and two nose swabs) from four different animals had in total seven putative L1 sequences (Table 1) . Five were most closely related to members of genus Xipapillomavirus from cattle (BPV12, BPV10, and BPV11) with 71%-76% nucleotide identity and to Rangifer tarandus papillomavirus 2 (RtPv2) with 68%-73% and another with 70% nucleotide identity to Capra hircus papillomavirus type 1 (ChPV1) from goat ( Table 1 ). The L1 sequence of animal 26, as described above, was most closely related to members of genus Deltaand Epsilonpapillomavirus. Of interest, the nasal swab from animal 27 contained at least two different papillomaviruses types (Table 1 ). In contrast, sequences yielded from nose and eye of animal 19 had both a closest homology with BPV10, suggesting the same infection in nose and eyes. Parvoviridae Erythrovirus is a genus in the family Parvoviridae which consists of small, icosahedral, non-enveloped viruses. So far, four species (Human parvovirus B19, pig-tailed macaque parvovirus, Rhesus macaque parvovirus and Simian parvovirus) and two tentative members have been identified. In eye and nose swabs of animal 2 (adult female), evidence was found for the presence of a parvovirus of the family Parvoviridae. A total of 11 taxonomic units, composed of 23 reads, showed either on nucleotide or amino acid level homology to bovine parvovirus 3 (accession number AAL09674), a species in the genus Erythrovirus [30] . The contigs were mainly covering the putative capsid protein genes with a nucleotide identity of 70%-75% to the corresponding genome regions of bovine parvovirus 3. A phylogenetic tree of a fragment of the capsid protein (amino acids 737 to 914 in Bovine parvovirus 3 VP2 (AF406967)) showed that the caribou parvovirus clustered closely with bovine parvovirus type 3 and other members of the genus Erythrovirus ( Figure 5A) . A similar clustering was observed upon phylogenetic analysis of a fragment of the NS1 protein ( Figure 5B ).",

The obtained metagenomes were subjected to different assembly algorithms prior to homology search to optimize the chance of identifying viral species in the metagenome dataset. The assembly strategy and parameters should ideally be selected based on the focus and conditions of a study, as a study for comparison of different assemblers for viral metagenomes recently showed [33] and the choice might be different even for similar projects. The comparison of different assembly strategies applied here involved a limited number of assemblers with single parameter sets. In our hands, the exhaustive iterative assembly approach seemed optimal and was added to an automated virus discovery pipeline. Iterative assembly is also used by PRICE [34] , an assembler for components of metagenomes in which an input target sequence is required. Our approach is completely de novo and unsupervised. It ensures optimal assembly in our comparative analysis with Newbler, CAP3, Mira, and CLC Genomics Workbench, either in terms of reliability and/or compression of the output data. This approach therefore facilitates subsequent homology searches, as longer, more reliable queries are more likely to yield functional or taxonomic assignments by exhibiting homology to a previously characterized and deposited sequence. The strategy of iterative assembly applied in this study is easily transferable to different kinds of algorithms, assemblers, and parameters, or a mix thereof, depending on the nature of the data.",

In the caribou cohort, consisting of presumably healthy animals sampled on their way south during their seasonal migration, up to 6.6% of the sequence reads were of viral origin in each sample, of which most were derived from bacteriophages. Members of the family Papillomaviridae were the most prevalent identified mammalian viruses in the caribou samples. L1 is the most conserved region among papillomaviruses and according to the current genus classification and its equidistance from Deltaand Epsilonpapillomaviruses, RtPV4 from an eye swab of animal 26 could be designated as a new papillomavirus genus of the family Papillomaviridae. Interestingly, RtPV4 from Rangifer tarandus granti in Alaska is more closely related to bovine papillomaviruses 1 and 2 in the L1 gene sequence, as compared to RtPV1 from Swedish reindeer (Rangifer t. tarandus) and a papillomavirus from American white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). In humans, papillomaviruses display high genetic diversity, with over 140 recognized types. For animals, however, more than ten papillomavirus types per host species have so far only been discovered in well studied vertebrates, such as cattle, dogs and macaques [35] . In reindeer, two types are described and so far genomically characterized in the genera Deltaand Xipapillomavirus [5, 36] . This study revealed the presence of at least three different papillomavirus types in caribou. This suggests that members of the family Papillomaviridae in reindeer are more diverse than currently acknowledged. Also human papillomaviruses were identified in this study, mainly in nose swabs, and they are likely to originate from contact with human skin. In this case, they assumingly originate from the sampling team. Although papillomaviruses have been identified a few times in reindeer [4, 37] , not much knowledge exists on the etiology of papillomatosis in reindeer. The disease is observed from time to time, both in wild reindeer and semi-domesticated reindeer, although it is not considered as a common disease. Generalized papillomatosis may contribute to severe conditions and mortality of affected individuals, and the clinical impact on the population or herd level is expected to be restricted, but the impact of papillomavirus infections on reindeer in general should be further addressed.",

The WACH population has declined since its recorded peak in 2003. Many different conditions, such as predators, weather and climatic conditions and diseases, may partly explain such fluctuations. Caribou individuals reaching the Kobuk River on their way south to their winter range may be considered as ''winners'', being healthy and able to conduct such a strenuous seasonal migration. It is thus possible that individuals of the same population, that do not make it to the winter ranges, may suffer from similar infections and that they are also affected clinically. To search for associations between the virus infections detected during this work and potential disease and impact on individuals and the population, samples should be obtained from animals found dead or from individuals that, for some reason, do not migrate with the main herd to the winter pastures. The caribou monitored in this study appeared healthy and the disease potential of the newly identified viruses therefore remains to be determined.
