We conducted a prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study of adults and children with febrile upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid CRP/MxA immunoassay to identify clinically significant bacterial infection with host response and acute pathogenic viral infection. The reference standard for classifying URI etiology was an algorithm that included throat bacterial culture, upper respiratory PCR for viral and atypical pathogens, procalcitonin, white blood cell count, and bandemia. The algorithm also allowed for physician override. Among 205 patients, 25 (12.2%) were classified as bacterial, 53 (25.9%) as viral, and 127 (62.0%) negative by the reference standard. For bacterial detection, agreement between FebriDx and the reference standard was 91.7%, with FebriDx having a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI: 59-93%), specificity of 93% (89-97%), positive predictive value (PPV) of 63% (45-79%), and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 97% (94-99%). For viral detection, agreement was 84%, with a sensitivity of 87% (75-95%), specificity of 83% (76-89%), PPV of 64% (63-75%), and NPV of 95% (90-98%). FebriDx may help to identify clinically significant immune responses associated with bacterial and viral URIs that are more likely to require clinical management or therapeutic intervention, and has potential to assist with antibiotic stewardship.",

Recent data suggest that approximately 30% of antibiotics used in the outpatient setting are inappropriate, largely driven by misuse of antibiotics for viral upper respiratory tract (URI) infections [2] . Overuse of antibiotics has been linked to several negative outcomes, including development of antibiotic resistance, antibiotic-associated infections, increased costs, and drug toxicities [3] . Antibiotic stewardship programs focus on guiding clinicians to use antibiotics for URIs only when adequate evidence for bacterial infection exists [4] . However, rapid diagnostic tests to assist clinicians in the identification of bacterial respiratory infections are lacking, which has hampered antibiotic stewardship efforts [5] .",

FebriDx requires 5 mcL of whole blood obtained by a capillary (\"finger\") stick. It provides qualitative results for elevated levels of CRP (\u226520 mg/L) and MxA (\u226540 ng/mL). There is no current universal MxA ELISA standard and the MxA ELISA was used to determine the medical decision point for the FebriDx MxA result line. The standard material in the BioVender MxA ELISA (BioVender; Brno, Czech Republic) uses a truncated recombinant MxA construct, which is less prone to aggregation. The assay conditions also contain a high salt content to ensure monomeric MxA. Taken together, these factors tend to dramatically enhance the accuracy and more importantly the reproducibility of an assay and explain why the FebriDx MxA medical decision points are near 40 ng/mL versus 235 ng/mL as seen on other MxA ELISA tests [10] . FebriDx results indicating an elevated CRP without an associated elevated MxA were interpreted as bacterial infection. FebriDx results indicating elevated MxA, regardless of CRP level, were interpreted as viral infection. Valid tests showing no elevated CRP or MxA were interpreted as negative.",

Stolz et al., examined PCT cutoffs for a variety of respiratory infections and demonstrated that a PCT of 0.1 ng/mL has 94% sensitivity for bacterial infection and 72% specificity while at 0.25 ng/mL cutoff, the sensitivity for bacterial infection decreased to 84% while the specificity increased to 98% [24] . When specifically looking at URI conditions, such as pharyngitis, both Elsammak and Christiansen et al., showed that PCT levels ranged between 0.1 ng/mL to 6 ng/mL with the median values found between 0.1 ng/mL and 0.3 ng/mL [25, 26] . In the context of a negative FilmArray \u00ae Respiratory Panel test for the most common viral and atypical bacterial pathogens and an associated elevated WBC or the presence of bands, an elevated PCT level of 0.1 ng/mL is more likely to be a bacterial infection than when it is measured across the entire patient population.",

Asymptomatic control participants did not undergo reference testing and were assumed to have a \"negative\" etiology for the reference standard. These patients were tested with an MxA protein ELISA and high sensitivity c-reactive protein enzyme immunoassay. This asymptomatic control population was analyzed separately from the primary URI study population. Specificity (true negative rate) and the false positive rate for FebriDx were calculated.",

The physician panel agreed with classification assigned by the algorithm for 203 (99.0%) patients. Two patients were reclassified by the physician panel as more likely bacterial infections. The first patient had a throat culture positive for heavy growth of Group A beta hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) and a PCT value of 0.09 ng/mL that was thought to more likely represent a bacterial infection in the presence of GABHS culture and a negative viral PCR panel, this was deemed more likely to be a bacterial infection.

            "text": "This manuscript describes a multi-center evaluation of FebriDx, a new point-of-care diagnostic test designed to rapidly provide clinicians with actionable, bedside data on the likely etiology of URIs. Using a small sample of capillary whole blood, FebriDx provides measurements of CRP and MxA, biomarkers that are associated with bacterial and viral infections, respectively [8, 9] . In this prospective, multicenter study of 205 outpatients with febrile URIs and 163 asymptomatic controls, FebriDx was sensitive and specific for detection of bacteria with a host immune response and pathogenic viruses, with overall sensitivities and specificities in the 80-93% range. A limited number of patients less than 18 years old were enrolled with a bacterial infection making it challenging to compare sensitivity and specificity values to the other age groups. However, viral infections were more equally distributed among the age groups. Comparatively, the sensitivity of the FebriDx test was found to be higher in children with a lower specificity compared to the other age groups. This suggests that children have some unknown factor that leads to elevated MxA or a cross-reactivity with the anti-MxA antibody, or more likely, is partially related to the active exclusion of rhinovirus and coronavirus as shown above and based on the limitation of the FilmArray \u00ae Respiratory Panel for detecting other viral pathogens such as parechoviruses, human bocavirus, and specifically, enterovirus-68 which produced a U.S. epidemic during the dates of the trial [16] . While the clinical utility of this promising technology will be further defined with additional study, FebriDx may serve as an important tool for future efforts at antibiotic stewardship, which have historically been hampered by a lack of rapid and accurate diagnostic tests to help clinicians distinguish between viral and bacterial infection [1, 2, 4, 5] . Particular strengths of the study included: (1) the prospective, multicenter design; (2) standardized procedures and definitions used across all sites; (3) appropriate blinding of FebriDx and reference standard results to personnel who made FebriDx and reference testing measurements; and (4) inclusion of an asymptomatic control population to confirm high specificity of FebriDx in an asymptomatic population. Furthermore, in the current study, FebriDx correctly identified 86% of patients with GABHS pharyngitis as bacterial and 90% if inclusive of GCBHS, as well as 88% of patients with acute influenza as viral. This accuracy compares favorably with rapid antigen detection tests for GABHS [29, 30] and influenza [31] [32] [33] which clinicians routinely use to assist with decisions about prescribing antibiotics and antiviral agents.",

CRP is an acute phase protein that has been linked to the presence and severity of bacterial infection in numerous studies during the past 2 decades [9, 34, 35] . CRP concentrations >20 mg/L trigger a positive CRP reading on the FebriDx device. Previous studies suggest that patients with infectious respiratory symptoms and a CRP below this 20 mg/L threshold are likely to have non-bacterial, or self-limited infections [9, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . CRP levels above this threshold identify a clinically significant immune response but cannot reliably differentiate between viral and bacterial etiology [8] ; therefore, FebriDx also includes MxA as a marker of viral infection. MxA is a derivative of interferon-\u03b1 and -\u03b2 (type I interferons), and, like interferons, is upregulated in the presence of viral infection [8, 39] . MxA has broad antiviral activity against RNA and DNA viruses [40] . The long serum half-life of MxA, with elevated levels detectable up to 10 days after viral infection, provides a distinct advantage for use as a biomarker compared to interferons, which have more variable and transient elevations in response to viral infection [39, 41] . MxA concentrations \u226540 ng/mL trigger a positive reading on FebriDx, a level that has been identified as a sensitive threshold for identifying viral infections [8, 36, 42] . By combining CRP and MxA into a single test, FebriDx includes sensitive markers of both bacterial and viral infection.",

Therefore, we developed a reference standard algorithm that incorporated multiple individual tests with the aim of identifying bacterial infections with a host response and pathogenic viral infections (Figure 1 ). Recognizing that all clinically-important bacterial URIs were unlikely to be detected by throat culture and NP/OP PCR, we classified cultureand PCR-negative patients as bacterial when elevated PCT and WBC levels suggested bacterial infection [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Given the strong association between NP/OP PCR detection of influenza, adenovirus, parainfluenza, RSV, human metapneumovirus and symptomatic disease, [12] [13] [14] identification of any of these viruses was considered a pathogenic infection in our algorithm. Detection of other viruses that are more likely to represent asymptomatic detection (colonization/carriage), such as rhinovirus or coronavirus, were not considered pathogenic in the algorithm [12] [13] [14] .",

We acknowledge our algorithm-based reference standard for identifying clinically-significant viral and bacterial URIs was imperfect and additional testing could be incorporated.

Differentiation of infection from colonization or a clinically insignificant local infection requires the demonstration of a systemic antibody response although this immune response is clinically impractical because it is both time-delaying and may lead to false-negative results following appropriate antibiotic therapy [48] . Other studies have shown that only 40-50% of the children with GABHS isolated from the upper respiratory tract, who presented with symptoms of tonsillitis or pharyngitis, demonstrated an immune response [49] [50] [51] . Ivaska et al., showed that in 83 patients presenting with pharyngitis, GABHS alone was found in 8 (9.6%), GABHS together with virus in 11 (13.3%), group C or G b-hemolytic streptococci (GCBHS, GGBHS) alone in two (2.4%), GCBHS or GGBHS together with virus in three (3.6%), and one or more viruses alone in 49 (59.0%) cases. Only 5 patients showed a 2-fold anti-streptolysin-O antibody increase in paired serum samples and of the 5 patients with an antibody response, three of them were GABHS positive, one of them was GCBHS positive, and one was negative for streptococci by throat culture.

While a co-infection cannot be ruled out when both MxA and CRP are elevated, this condition was not seen in the current clinical trial. We defined a true co-infection as requiring the presence of a confirmed virus by PCR and the presence of bacterial cell culture growth or PCR positivity for an atypical bacterial pathogen, in association with a PCT elevation greater than \u22650.25 ng/mL and/or elevated WBC \u2265 12,000. Using this definition, no co-infections were confirmed. This low association of bacterial co-infection in patients with URI is consistent with the low 2% co-infection rate found by M\u00e4kel\u00e4 et al., in a study of 200 young adults [53] . Another study of 506 patients suggests a higher co-infection rate of 8% based on the detection of rising CRP levels at subsequent office visits; however, this is likely an overestimate since CRP measurements were made independent of microbiological confirmation [54] and it is well known that viral infections, such as influenza, parainfluenza, Epstein-Barr, herpes zoster, herpes simplex, and adenovirus may lead to substantial increases in CRP, often approaching 100 mg/mL [55] [56] [57] [58] . Even though FebriDx cannot differentiate a rare co-infection, the 97% NPV suggests that the FebriDx test may supports a watchful waiting antibiotic strategy wherein if the patient were to clinically worsen over the subsequent 72 h after the initial testing, additional reflex microbiological testing or empiric antibiotic therapy could be considered.",

In this study, FebriDx revealed a PPV of 63% for bacterial infection, which is largely related to the lower prevalence of bacterial infection compared to viral infection but is significantly higher than PPV's reported in PCT studies evaluating ARI in primary care patients [59, 60] . This suggests that approximately 30% of the FebriDx bacterial positive patients, which represents about 4% of the total ARI patients based on the prevalence, could receive an unnecessary antibiotic which is less than the current over prescription rate of 30% which is largely driven by over treating viral infections [2] . None of the FebriDx bacterial false positives occurred in patients with microbiologically confirmed viral infection. In this study, 38% of patients with microbiologically confirmed viral infection had an elevated CRP \u2265 20 mg/L and 17% had an elevated PCT \u2265 0.1 ng/ml which could contribute to overtreatment. Most URIs do not require antibiotic treatment but often receive unnecessary antibiotic treatment based on parent or patient pressure and physician fears of missing a serious bacterial infection. Davidson et al., showed that FebriDx altered clinical management decisions in 48% of patients with an ARI and reduced unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions by 80% [7] . The strength of the FebriDx test rests in its high NPV that reduces the likelihood of missing a clinically significant bacterial infection.",

Treatment of GABHS may only be necessary when it is associated with a host response since it is very rare to have cases of rheumatic fever occur in patients without a systemic antibody response [47] . When GABHS is cultured from the oropharynx and is associated with an antibody response suggesting a true infection, CRP will elevate 80-90% of the time [46, 61] . Patients with a URI and negative initial CRP test seldom show a rise in antibody titer [62] . Ninety-six percent of uninfected children have CRP < 10 mg/mL [63] . Putto et al., found that in examining 62 children with positive bacterial cultures, 89% showed a CRP elevated over 20 mg/L [37] . In a recent study of 621 adult patients with acute cough or fever, 20.5% of whom had radiographically confirmed pneumonia, Steurer et al., concluded that pneumonia could safely be excluded in patients with CRP values below 10 mg/L and in patients without dyspnea or daily fever with values between 11 and 50 mg/L [64] . Valkenburg et al., has shown that an anti-streptococcal antibody titer is more accurate than a throat culture in predicting therapeutic outcome [65] . Both CRP and PCT have been shown to elevate in URI [24, 25] . In Europe, CRP > 20 mg/L is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Pneumonia guidelines as a trigger for prescribing antibiotics [66] . Randomized controlled studies using CRP [67] [68] [69] and PCT [70] to guide antibiotic decisions have been shown to reduce antibiotic prescriptions without increased morbidity for both URI and lower respiratory tract infection (LRI). This inability to differentiate a local infection without an associated systemic host response from a clinically significant infection with an associated host response may result in unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.",

Since a confirmation of fever was only found in 13% (26/205), it is possible that some of these MURI patients were never febrile and were experiencing reactive airway disease or were presenting prior to, or significantly after, development of a clinically significant infection. The rate of MURI in the small confirmed febrile subset was 28% versus 62% for the complete trial and demonstrated 100% (4/4) bacterial sensitivity, 95% (21/22) specificity, 82% (9/11) viral sensitivity, and 87% (13/15) viral specificity.

Second, we sought to enroll consecutive eligible patients, but due to practical constraints of shipping biological samples and availability of research staff, our population is best described as a convenience sample. Third, we did not include blood or sputum cultures in our testing for bacterial pathogens due to low anticipated yield for these tests in outpatients with URIs; we acknowledge that including a broader range of culture testing may have resulted in more bacterial identification. Fourth, we only captured information during a patient's index visit; including follow-up information from later visits may have provided additional data useful for classifying URIs as viral or bacterial. Fifth, despite extensive testing, 62% of our URI patients were classified as having negative etiology by the reference standard; this is similar to prior studies demonstrating a large proportion of patients with acute respiratory infections do not have pathogens identifiable with currently-available tests [34, 35] .
