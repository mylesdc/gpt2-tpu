            "text": "Guinea fowl coronavirus (GfCoV) causes fulminating enteritis that can result in a daily death rate of 20% in guinea fowl flocks. Here, we studied GfCoV diversity and evaluated its phenotypic consequences. Over the period of 2014 to 2016, affected guinea fowl flocks were sampled in France, and avian coronavirus presence was confirmed by PCR on intestinal content and immunohistochemistry of intestinal tissue. Sequencing revealed 89% amino acid identity between the viral attachment protein S1 of GfCoV/2014 and that of the previously identified GfCoV/2011. To study the receptor interactions as a determinant for tropism and pathogenicity, recombinant S1 proteins were produced and analyzed by glycan and tissue arrays. Glycan array analysis revealed that, in addition to the previously elucidated biantennary di-N-acetyllactosamine (diLacNAc) receptor, viral attachment S1 proteins from GfCoV/ 2014 and GfCoV/2011 can bind to glycans capped with alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids. Interestingly, recombinant GfCoV/2014 S1 has an increased affinity for these glycans compared to that of GfCoV/2011 S1, which was in agreement with the increased avidity of GfCoV/2014 S1 for gastrointestinal tract tissues. Enzymatic removal of receptors from tissues before application of spike proteins confirmed the specificity of S1 tissue binding. Overall, we demonstrate that diversity in GfCoV S1 proteins results in differences in glycan and tissue binding properties. IMPORTANCE Avian coronaviruses cause major global problems in the poultry industry. As causative agents of huge economic losses, the detection and understanding of the molecular determinants of viral tropism are of ultimate importance. Here, we set out to study those parameters and obtained in-depth insight into the virushost interactions of guinea fowl coronavirus (GfCoV). Our data indicate that diversity in GfCoV viral attachment proteins results in differences in degrees of affinity for glycan receptors, as well as altered avidity for intestinal tract tissues, which might have consequences for GfCoV tissue tropism and pathogenesis in guinea fowls.",

Studies using recombinant IBV S1 and/or RBD proteins have demonstrated that the viral tropism is reflected by tissue binding of such proteins (11) . Mutations in the spike proteins of IBV might result in either decreased (10) or increased (12) avidity for its receptor present on epithelial cells of the chicken trachea. In contrast to IBV, GfCoV and TCoV target the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract (4, 6) , and recombinant protein binding of their S1 proteins reflects this viral tropism, with predominant staining of epithelial cells of the small intestine (4) . Glycan array analysis identified elongated biantennary N-acetyllactosamine (di-LacNAc) molecules on N-glycans as the host receptor for enteric AvCoVs, which are abundantly expressed on intestinal tissues (4) .",

Gastrointestinal content collected from 20 affected animals between February 2014 and November 2016 was analyzed for the presence of gammacoronavirus genetic material by one-step real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using pan-gammacoronavirus primers (13) . For all samples, threshold cycle (C T ) values obtained were below 35 (data not shown), confirming the presence of coronaviral RNA in all tested samples (Table 1) . Next, overlapping conventional PCRs were performed with primers based on the spike gene of the GfCoV/2011 virus (sequences available upon request). Partial S1 sequences could be obtained from 10 of 20 RT-PCR-positive samples (893 to 1,841 nucleotides [nt]; 3,624 nt in the complete S sequence) ( Table 1 ); the quality and/or quantity of the remaining 10 samples was too low to generate PCR products. Sanger sequencing of the obtained fragments confirmed the presence of GfCoV in the intestinal content of all 10 birds, confirming continuous GfCoV circulation in France. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the genetic diversity of the obtained partial S1 sequences using maximum likelihood analyses (Fig. 2) . The results showed that the 2014 -2016 sequences clearly clustered with the S1 reference gene from GfCoV/2011 (GenBank accession number HF544506) supported by a bootstrap value of 100, while they were genetically more distantly related to TCoV. Each of the GfCoV 2014 -2016 partial S1 sequences shared 85% to 88% nucleotide identity with the GfCoV/2011 S1 sequence, and between the 2014 and 2016 partial S1 sequences, the variation was 0.1 to 8.0%.",

Next, we investigated whether the mutations in S1 resulted in recognition of additional N-linked glycans. To this end, both S1 proteins were applied to a novel glycan array containing N-glycan structures with their linear counterparts, either with terminal galactose or two differently linked sialic acid moieties (F. Broszeit and R. P. de Vries, submitted for publication). Schematic representations of each of the glycans are given in Fig. 4A . The data revealed that both GfCoV S1 proteins bind to longer biantennary LacNAc structures (Fig. 4B , structures 3 and 4), including the diLacNAc structure used in the ELISA (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, both GfCoV S1 proteins bound to longer linear LacNAc repeats (Fig. 4B , structure 1), which were not included in the previous array (4). Finally, both GfCoV S1 proteins bound longer linear and biantennary LacNAc repeats with terminal alpha-2,6 sialic acid (Fig. 4B , structures 9 to 12) but not those capped with alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids (Fig. 4B , structures 5 to 8). Erythrina crista-galli lectin (ECA), Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA), and Maackia Amurensis lectin I (MAL1) were used as controls. We observed, as expected, specific binding to galactose and alpha-2,6-linked and alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid terminal glycans, respectively (Fig. 4C ). In conclusion, both GfCoV S1 proteins show specificity for the same glycans, ending with either galactose or alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids on the glycan array. However, the relative fluorescence observed for GfCoV/2014 S1 was consistently higher than that for GfCoV/2011 S1, which is suggestive of differences in their affinities for glycan receptors, as observed for diLacNAcs in the data shown in Fig. 3 .",

Both proteins stained the epithelial cells of almost the entire gastrointestinal tract (duodenum and colon in Fig. 6 , first column; results are summarized in Table 2 ), indicating that receptors present on the tissues allow binding of S1. Interestingly, staining intensities of the lower intestinal tract (ileum, cecum, and colon) were much more apparent for GfCoV/2014 S1 than for GfCoV/2011 S1. This prompted us to analyze avidity and specificity of GfCoV S1 proteins to glycan receptors in the guinea fowl gastrointestinal tissues. We therefore pretreated tissue slides with Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase (AUNA) and/or galactosidase to cleave off terminal sialic acids and/or galactose residues from host glycans, respectively. Treatment of the tissues with Glycan binding specificity of guinea fowl S1 proteins.

(B and C) Glycan receptor specificity of GfCoV S1 proteins and lectins ECA, MAL1, and SNA in glycan array assay (Broszeit and de Vries, submitted). RFU, relative fluorescent units. AUNA had only a minor effect on the binding of both GfCoV S1 proteins, with a slight decrease in binding intensity to the duodenum for GfCoV/2014 S1 (Fig. 6A , second column; Table 2 ). SNA lectin binding was completely abolished after pretreatment with AUNA, confirming that the treatment did effectively cleave off all sialic acids from the host glycans (Table 2) .",

(A and B) Spike histochemistry was performed on uninfected, healthy duodenum and colon tissues without and with pretreatment of enzymes (AUNA and/or galactosidase) before application of GfCoV/2014 S1 and GfCoV/2011 S1. Binding of proteins was visualized by red staining. rate was 5 \u03eb 10 \u03ea2 substitutions/site/year with a ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) of 0.45. Similar mutation rates of the spike have been reported for IBV (18) and are believed to be driven by selective pressure after vaccination (19, 20) . However, no vaccine is available against GfCoV or against the closely related turkey coronavirus, TCoV. Another driver for genetic diversity is the population size (21) ; however, this is unlikely to explain the observed high mutation rate of GfCoV since flocks are considerably smaller than chicken flocks. It might well be that circulating antibodies against field strains of GfCoV are the main drivers of the observed sequence diversity. Unfortunately, retrospective studies to further elucidate the contribution of virus evolution, the circulation of other virus populations in the last years, or the introduction of novel strains via, for example, trade of birds between farms are impossible due to the lack of archived material.",
