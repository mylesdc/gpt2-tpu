However, existing RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms cannot predict the pseudoknot structure efficiently. Although random matching can improve the number of base pairs, these non-consecutive base pairs cannot make contributions to reduce the free energy. Result: In order to improve the efficiency of searching procedure, our algorithm take consecutive base pairs as the basic components. Firstly, our algorithm calculates and archive all the consecutive base pairs in triplet data structure, if the number of consecutive base pairs is greater than given minimum stem length. Secondly, the annealing schedule is adapted to select the optimal solution that has minimum free energy. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated with the real instances in PseudoBase.",

These non-nested base pairs make the presence of pseudoknots in RNA sequences more difficult to be predicted by dynamic programming, which use a recursive scoring system to identify paired stems. The general problem of predicting minimum free energy (MFE) structures with pseudoknots is NP-complete problem [4] . In general, researchers apply the principle of MFE to evaluate RNA secondary structure. When the RNA sequence is freely folded in space to form the secondary structure of MFE under fixed experimental conditions, the change is stopped, meanwhile, the stable state of the RNA sequence is formed. For the calculation of the free energy of RNA secondary structure, the stem energy is defined as a negative, the energy of loop is defined as a positive, and the free single strand does not participate. Deng found that the molecular free energy is related to a single complementary base pair, but adjacent base pairs also affect the free energy calculation of the molecule [5] . In the secondary structure prediction, if the free energy calculation of each part does not affect each other, the free energy of the entire structure is accumulated form the energy of each part, and the calculation principle is shown in Eq. (1) .",

The first category is dynamic programming (DP) based approaches. DP is the initial computational approach used to predict RNA structure [6] . The idea of dynamic programming is to divide a complex problem into many simple subproblems to facilitate their treatment [7] . Combining the DP idea with the principle of MFE, researchers have proposed many RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms. Rivas and Eddy [8] proposed pknots-RE algorithm that can predict RNA sequence with pseudoknot structure. Dirks and Pierce [9] proposed NUPACK algorithm which calculate a series of recursion probabilities that can be used to compute base-pairing probabilities with or without pseudoknots. However, these algorithms are very time-consuming to predict long-chain sequence, and its maximum predictive sequence length cannot exceed 150.",

[11] proposed HotKnots to build up candidate secondary structures by adding substructures one by one to partially formed structures. Zuker et al. [12] and Turner et al. [13] integrate thermodynamic model into their algorithms to search for secondary structure with minimal free energy. SARNA-predict-pk [14] algorithm is an extended version of SARNA-Predict [10] which predicts RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots. This algorithm employs a new thermodynamic model that was described by Rastegari and Condon [15] and implemented in the HotKnots software. The model can be used to evaluate RNA sequences with pseudoknots. IPknot [16] algorithm proposed a computational method for predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots based on maximizing the expected accuracy of a predicted structure. Iterative HFold [17] takes as input a pseudoknot-free structure, and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any (density-2) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure. It leverages strengths of earlier methods, namely the fast running time of HFold, a method that is based on the hierarchical folding hypothesis and the energy parameters of HotKnots V2.0. Fatmi et al. [18] proposed a new algorithm that combines between the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) principle. This method repeats a process consisting of two phases: the construction phase and the local search phase. During the construction phase, a list of feasible solutions is iteratively constructed. The local search phase comes with the wake of the construction step; it aims to improve the solution obtained from the first phase by launching a local search to find the local optimum solution.",

The algorithm sets the MinStem and MinLoop parameters to determine the pseudoknot structure formed by the base pair crosscombination, and optimizes the pool of candidate solutions, thereby reducing the time cost of the algorithm. The custom evaluation function is used to improve the efficiency of RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms. Moreover, the performance of the PRSA algorithm is compared with state of art algorithms including eighteen PseudoBase benchmark instances, and the comparison results show that the PRSA algorithm is more accurate and competitive with higher sensitivity and specificity values.",

The reason for the analysis may be that the algorithm for evaluating individuals is based on the average base pairs length rather than the standard thermodynamic model. As the length of the RNA molecule increases, the number of groups of complementary bases M(X) will become larger, so that the effect of average basepairs on prediction results becomes weaker, the accuracy of the PRSA algorithm will be reduced. Besides, the parameter settings of the PRSA algorithm will also affect the prediction results, which will be studied further in the future. ",
