We examined whether polymorphisms in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus were related to the risk of developing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) among Chinese populations. In the first stage, 26 tag SNPs were genotyped in a Guangxi population (855 patients and 1036 controls). In the second stage, the SNPs, which showed significant association, were further genotyped in a Guangdong population (997 patients and 972 controls). Functional analyses were conducted to verify the biological relevance of the associated polymorphism. In the 1st stage, four SNPs (rs2736098, rs2735845, rs402710, and rs401681) were significantly associated with the risk of developing NPC. After the 2nd stage validation, rs2735845 and rs401681 were independently associated with the risk of developing NPC in the additive model (rs2735845, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.04-1.37, P = 0.011; rs401681, OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.74-0.99, P = 0.034). Furthermore, we observed higher CLPTM1L messenger RNA levels in fetal mesenchymal stem cells from the rs2735845 G allele carriers compared with that from non-carriers. In addition, using an immunohistochemistry assay, we observed higher TERT and CLPTM1L levels in NPC tissues compared with that in non-cancerous nasopharyngeal tissues. Our findings suggest that polymorphisms in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus may play a role in mediating the susceptibility to NPC in Chinese populations.",

The incidence of NPC is higher in Southeast Asia and Africa but lower among Caucasians in North America and Europe. In southern China, the incidence rate is approximately 15-50 per 100,000 person-years, which is 100-fold higher than that in the Western world [1] . NPC is a complex disease caused by an interaction among Epstein-Barr virus infection, environmental risk factors and host genes in a multistep process of carcinogenesis [2] . The identification of susceptibility genes contributing to NPC may help clarify the pathogenesis of carcinogenesis and improve the prevention and treatment of this malignancy.",

            "text": "The human 5p15.33 locus contains two wellknown genes, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and the cleft lip and palate transmembrane 1-like (CLPTM1L) genes, which have been implicated in carcinogenesis. TERT, as the rate-limiting catalytic subunit of the telomerase enzyme, plays an essential role in the maintenance of telomere DNA length, chromosomal stability, and cellular immortality [3] . TERT is expressed in the vast majority of human malignant celllines and tumors but not in the corresponding benign tissues [4] . With regard to NPC, elevated telomerase activity and TERT expression levels were detected in tumor tissues compared with normal nasopharyngeal epithelium and tissues [5, 6] . Furthermore, for the clinicopathological features in NPC patients, the telomerase activity was observed more frequently in advanced clinical stage and lymph node metastasis [7, 8] . The other gene in this region, CLPTM1L, which is named for its similarity to a gene implicated in the susceptibility to cleft lip palate, was identified through screening for cisplatin-resistancerelated genes. Although the function of this gene is less known, it was found to be upregulated in cisplatinresistant ovarian tumor cell lines and to induce apoptosis in cisplatin-sensitive cells [9] . On the basis of the above functional relevance of the TERT and CLPTM1L genes in the pathogenesis of cancers, we hypothesize that TERT and CLPTM1L may be excellent biological candidate susceptibility genes for cancers.",

The observed genotype frequencies for the four polymorphisms conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the Guangdong population (all P > 0.05, data not shown). There was no association between the rs2736098 and rs402710 polymorphisms and the risk of NPC in the Guangdong population (data not shown). However, the rs2735845 and rs401681 polymorphisms were significantly associated with risk of NPC in the Guangdong population (Table 2) . For the 2735845 polymorphism, the G allele presented significant association with increased risk of NPC in the additive model (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.04-1.37, P = 0.011). For the rs401681 polymorphism, the T allele presented significant association with decreased risk of NPC in the additive model (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.74-0.99, P = 0.034). When the Guangxi and Guangdong populations were combined, stronger associations were observed between both the rs2735845 and rs401681 polymorphisms and NPC risk in the additive model (for rs2735845: adjusted OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.12-1.35, P = 4.64 \u00d7 10 \u22125 ; for rs401681: adjusted OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.74-0.90, P = 1.00 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) ( Table 2 ). The effects of rs2735845 and rs401681 were maintained when corrected for each other by logistic regression (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.03-1.29, P = 0.012 and OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.78-0.99, P = 0.03, respectively). No association more significant than that of rs2735845 and rs401681 was identified through imputation of other polymorphisms in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus based on HapMap CHB data (data not shown). Furthermore, the correlation between rs2735845 and rs401681 is not strong (D' = 0.91, r 2 = 0.24 in HapMap CHB samples, D' = 0.89, r 2 = 0.24 in our control data; Figure 1 ). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that rs2735845 and rs401681 are independently associated with NPC.",

There are two genes within the 5p15.33 TERT-CLPTM1L locus through which the association might plausibly be mediated: TERT and CLPTM1L. TERT translates the catalytic protein subunit of the telomerase complex, which elongates the telomere in cells. Telomere-driven genome instability is a widespread cause of genome instability in cancer and is thought to be the crucial event in the development of tumorigenesis [3] . It has been shown that small hairpin RNA can direct against TERT to inhibit cell viability by regulating telomerase activity and its related protein expression in NPC cells [21] . Moreover, overexpression of TERT has been detected in a variety of cancer cells, including NPC [6] . In this study, we also found that the expression of TERT was higher in the NPC tissues compared to the non-cancer nasopharyngeal tissues. Our results, together with those of the earlier studies, suggest that TERT plays an important role in NPC carcinogenesis. CLPTM1L encodes a predicted transmembrane protein, which plays an important role in carcinogenesis. CLPTM1L is upregulated in a cisplatin-resistant ovary cancer cell line and might be involved in the apoptotic response of cells under genotoxic stress caused by cisplatin [9] . CLPTM1L has been reported in the cellular response to genotoxic stress and cisplatin resistance [9] . In addition, over-expression of CLPTM1L has been observed in lung tumors [22] . In this study, we found that the expression of CLPTM1L was higher in the NPC tissues compared to the non-cancer nasopharyngeal tissues, suggesting that the CLPTM1Lhas been implicated in NPC carcinogenesis.",

Both GWAS and candidate gene association studies have identified common variants in 5p15.33 that reproducibly associate with several types of cancer. In 2008, McKay et al. carried out a GWAS of lung cancer, and two independent polymorphisms, rs402710 and rs2736100, were detected [12] . Another GWAS of lung cancer identified another associated polymorphism: rs401681 [11] . Subsequently, Rafnar et al. found that the rs401681 polymorphism was associated with the risk of basal cell, lung, urinary bladder, prostate and cervical cancers and cutaneous melanoma, and rs2736098, a synonymous coding SNP in exon 2 of the TERT gene, was associated with the risk of basal cell, lung, urinary bladder, and prostate cancers [10, 24] . Additionally, a meta-analysis of two GWAS of glioma demonstrated that the rs2736100 polymorphism was associated with the risk of glioma [16] . Petersen et al. conducted a GWAS of pancreatic cancer, and rs401681 was one of the most significantly associated polymorphisms [14] . GWAS of a testicular germ cell tumor identified two independently associated polymorphisms in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus, rs4635969 and rs2736100 [15] . Association studies of candidate gene strategies also reported that SNPs in TERT were associated with serous ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancers [25] [26] [27] . With regard to NPC, Fachiroh et al. and Ko et al. have reported that certain polymorphisms in the TERT gene were associated with NPC risk in Thailand [28, 29] . In this study, we found that two independent SNPs, rs2735845 and rs401681, were significantly associated with the risk of NPC.

The rs2735845 polymorphism, which resides in the intergenic region, was never reported before. The rs401681 polymorphism, which resides in an LD block that contains the CLPTM1L gene and the 5\u2032 end of the TERT gene, is one of the most extensively studied polymorphisms in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus. Rafnar et al. reported that the rs401681 polymorphism may lead to an increase in the gradual shortening of telomeres over time, but the effect may only become apparent after a certain age [10] . In this study, we did not find any association between rs401681 genotypes and TERT and CLPTM1L mRNA levels. We found that the CLPTM1L mRNA levels transcribed by the rs2735845 G allele were higher than those transcribed by the CC genotype in fMSCs. However, the difference in the induction of the reporter gene expression between the rs2735845 two alleles is not statistically significant (data not shown). Further studies are warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanism of these two polymorphisms.",

However, through further adjustment and stratification in the data analyses, the potential confounding effect might have been minimized. Second, a tag SNP approach has been shown to improve the power of the study for common genetic variants; however, the modest effects from rare genetic variants may remain undetected. Deep re-sequencing of the TERT-CLPTM1L locus may provide further help to uncover additional associated variants and to facilitate selection of potential causal variants for further functional studies.",

The Guangxi population, which was used for the 1st stage scanning analysis, consisted of 855 patients with NPC and 1036 controls. All subjects were unrelated ethnic Han Chinese and residents in Nanning city and the surrounding regions. The diagnosis of patients, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients and controls, and the definition of smokers and drinkers were described in detail in our previous studies [30] . Briefly, the patients with NPC were newly diagnosed and pathologically confirmed, and they were consecutively recruited at the Guangxi Cancer Hospital (Nanning, China) between September 2003 and January 2008. The response rate for case patients was 95%. Patients who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy before surgery or had another type of cancer were excluded from this study. The controls were randomly selected from a community cancer screening program for early detection of cancer conducted in the same regions during the same time period in which the NPC patients were collected. The response rate for control subjects was 91%. The selection criteria for the controls included no individual history of cancer. The Guangdong population, which was used for the 2nd stage replication analysis, consisted of 997 patients and 972 controls. The diagnosis of patients and the inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients and controls were described in detail previously [31] . Briefly, the patients with NPC were newly diagnosed and pathologically confirmed, and they were consecutively recruited from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC, Guangzhou, China) between October 2005 and October 2007. Only the patients who were self-reported as Guangdong Chinese and who lived in Guangdong province were recruited. During the same period, healthy controls were recruited from physical examination centers of several large comprehensive hospitals in the local communities of Guangdong. The selection criteria for the controls included no individual history of cancer. The response rate for cases and control was 90%. For both populations, tumor staging was performed according to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification of the 1997 American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system. All TNM classifications were determined by senior pathologists of the hospital on the basis of the postoperative histopathologic examination.",

The cells were cultured in DMEM/ F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, China) in 5% CO 2 in a 37\u00b0C incubator for 3-4 days to allow cells to adhere. The adherent cells formed colonies and grew rapidly, exhibiting spindle-shaped morphology. The medium was replaced every three days. When the cells reached to 60-80% confluence, they were harvested with trypsin-EDTA solution (Neuronbc, China) and subcultured at a density of 3-6\u00d710 3 cells/cm 2 [38] . Amplification of pluripotent stem cell markers, such as Oct-4 and Rex-1, was used to demonstrate primitive properties of the cultured cells, as described previously [39] .",

The IHC assay was performed as previously described [42] . Briefly, two slides of each biopsy were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for routine histological evaluation. The slides were washed in xylene to remove the paraffin and then rehydrated through serial dilutions of alcohol, followed by washings with a solution of PBS (pH 7.2). All subsequent washes were buffered via the same protocol. The slides were then incubated with 3% H 2 O 2 for 10 min to reduce non-specific staining. The treated sections were then placed in a citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and heated in a pressure cooker for two minutes. The samples were then incubated with a polyclonal anti-human CLPTM1L antibody (Sigma Aldrich, HPA014791) or a monoclonal rabbit anti-human TERT antibody (Lifespan, LS-C49516) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The conventional streptavidin peroxidase method (MaxVision \u2122 HRP-Polymer IHC Kit; Maxim Co., China) was performed for signal development, and the cells were counter-stained with hematoxylin. Negative controls and positive controls were prepared at the same time. The slides were mounted with gum for examination and capture by the Olympus BX51 microscopic/Digital Camera System for study comparison. IHC signals were scored as previously described [42] .

To correct for multiple testing, we used spectral decomposition (SpD) of matrices of LD between SNPs, which adjusts for multiple testing while taking into account LD among the tested SNPs [43] . This method showed that P values of 0.0029 and below can be considered statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. These analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

The value within each diamond represents the pairwise correlation between tag SNPs (measured as D') defined by the upper left and the upper right sides of the diamond.
