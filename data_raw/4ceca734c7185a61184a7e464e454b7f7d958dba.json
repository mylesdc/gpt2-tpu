Direct percutaneous aspiration from the site of lung infection, rarely done despite its good safety record, yields the highest-quality clinical specimen, but even then bacterial culture identifies a pathogen in no more than half of cases [3] .",

A study of the etiology of severe childhood pneumonia was undertaken in the coastal area of The Gambia (Supplementary Appendix 1). At the time of the study (2007-2009), there was high coverage with conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine but no routine usage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), which is the case currently in many African countries. Cases were children aged 2-59 months with severe pneumonia defined clinically by modified World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (cough or difficulty in breathing, plus any of the following: lower chest wall indrawing, nasal flaring, or an oxygen saturation of <90% on pulse oximetry). Participants were recruited from the Medical Research Council (MRC) hospital in Fajara; the Royal Victoria Teaching Hospital in Banjul; and the major health centers at Fajikunda, Serekunda, and Brikama. Children with a cough of \u22652 weeks, or severe anemia (hemoglobin level <6 g/dL) or confirmed wheeze were excluded. Radiological pneumonia was defined using WHO criteria (ie, endpoint consolidation or pleural effusion). HIV testing was done if informed consent was given after standard counseling. A standard WHO guideline-based antibiotic regimen was used. Written informed consent was obtained for participation in the study from parents or guardians. The study was approved by the Gambian government/MRC Joint Ethics Committee (SCC/EC1062).",

The predominance of S. pneumoniae along with its serotype distribution is supported by a high level of concordance between independent laboratories [19] .
