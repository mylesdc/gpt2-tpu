The isolated compounds were broussochalcone B (1), broussochalcone A (2), 4-hydroxyisolonchocarpin (3), papyriflavonol A (4), 3 0 -(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-3 0 ,4,7-trihydroxyflavane (5), kazinol A (6), kazinol B (7), broussoflavan A (8), kazinol F (9), and kazinol J (10). All polyphenols were more potent against papain-like protease (PL pro ) than against 3-chymotripsin-like protease (3CL pro ); therefore, we investigated their structural features that were responsible for this selectivity. Compound 4 was the most potent inhibitor of PL pro with an IC 50 value of 3.7 lM. The active compounds displayed kinetic behaviors, and the binding constants of their interaction with PL pro were determined from surface plasmon resonance analysis. Our results suggest B. papyrifera constituents as promising candidates for development into potential anti-coronaviral agents.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a contagious and often fatal respiratory illness, was first reported in the Guangdong province in China in November 2002. The disease quickly spread to other Asian countries, North America, and Europe, infecting more than 8000 individuals and causing approximately 800 deaths 1 . Recently, just as SARS began to fade from public memory, a new coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012. Pathogenic human CoVs, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, killed approximately 36% of infected patients in Saudi Arabia and South Korea [2] [3] [4] . It is alarming the new and deadly CoVs can emerge at any time with the potential to become pandemics. Unfortunately, neither a protective vaccine nor an effective antiviral agent for the prevention and treatment of SARS is available. Therefore, continued development of therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures against potentially deadly CoVs is warranted. The SARS-CoV is a crown-like enveloped virus that contains a positive-strand RNA whose genome sequence exhibits only moderate homology to other known CoVs 5 . Since SARS-CoV proteases (3-chymotrypsin-like protease [3CL pro ] and papain-like protease [PL pro ]) are synthesized as large precursor proteins that are cleaved to generate mature active proteins and their structures are conserved across the CoV genera, targeting these proteins is an effective antiviral strategy in suppressing viral genome replication to cure CoV infection 1, 6 .",

            "text": "As a continuation of our interest in natural product-derived anti-CoV candidates, we report in this study, the inhibitory actions of polyphenols from Broussonetia papyrifera against CoV proteases. We have previously reported that the a-glucosidase inhibitory activity of polyphenols from this genus depends on the number of prenyl groups in the molecule 7 . Many natural inhibitors of various glucosidases have been explored for potential application as medicines for carbohydrate-mediated diseases such as cancer 8 , diabetes 9 , and infectious diseases. Endoplasmic reticulum a-glucosidases are responsible for the stepwise removal of terminal glucose residues from N-glycan chains attached to nascent glycoproteins. These reactions are the first steps in N-linked glycan processing and are essential for the proper folding and function of many glycoproteins 10 . Because most viral envelope glycoproteins contain N-linked glycans, a-glucosidase inhibitors such as 1-deoxynojirimycin and castanospermine have been proposed as potentially useful broad-spectrum antiviral agents based on their activity on a variety of enveloped viruses 11,12 . We were encouraged by these preliminary findings and focused our attention on investigating the antiviral activities of polyphenols on CoV cysteine proteases. Here, we characterized and evaluated the anti-SARS/MERS activity of the following B. papyrifera root-derived glucosidase inhibitor: broussochalcone B 1 , broussochalcone A 2 , 4-hydroxyisolonchocarpin 3 , papyriflavonol A 4 , 3 0 -(3methylbut-2-enyl)-3 0 ,4 0 ,7-trihydroxyflavane 5 , kazinol A 6 , kazinol B 7 , broussoflavan A 8 , kazinol F 9 and kazinol J ,7,10,13 . Preliminary biochemical screening of 14 naturally derived compounds (comprising authentic and in-house compounds, as well as isoliquiritigenin, kaempferol, quercetin, and quercetin-b-galactoside 14 ) were performed to assess their potential as novel CoV cysteine protease inhibitors in vitro. The present results indicate that some of these compounds may serve as lead compounds for the development of CoV protease inhibitors and can be used to elucidate the structure-function relationships of varied polyphenols.",

The constructed plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) HIT competent cells (Real Biotech Co., Taipei, Taiwan) that were streaked on a LB agar plate containing 50 lg/mL kanamycin at 37 C. For large-scale protein expression, cultures were grown in 0.5 L of LB medium at 37 C to an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm, induced by overnight incubation with 0.5 mM isopropyl b-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16 C. After centrifuging at 6000 g at 4 C for 20 min, the cell pellets were suspended in buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) and then lysed by sonication. The crude extracts were then centrifuged at 12, 000 rpm for 30 min to remove the insoluble pellet. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A and the protein sample was eluted with 100-300 mM imidazole.

We also examined the a-glucosidase inhibitory capacity of the isolated compounds 7 . These compounds showed dosedependent inhibitory effects on both a-glucosidase and cysteine proteases. Results of the CoV cysteine protease inhibition assays are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. All tested polyphenols (1-10) showed dose-dependent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV PL pro ( Figure 3 ). As shown in Table 1 , the compounds were more potent against SARS-CoV PL pro compared with the other cysteine proteases. The IC 50 values of compounds 1-10 against trans-cleavage activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro ranged from 30.2 to 233.3 lM. Among the isolated polyphenols, the C5-alkyl group (prenyl)-substituted flavan 5 exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV 3CL pro and was more effective than quercetin (IC 50 \u00bc 52.7 lM). General structural-activity relationships can be deduced from these data, for example, molecules with a C4-OH group and a saturated chromenone with a dihydroxy group at ring C showed higher inhibitory activity than those with a closed prenyl group (7, IC 50 \u00bc 233.3 lM). Chalcones (1-3, IC 50 : 57.8-202.7 lM) and biphenyl propanoids (9 and 10, IC 50 : 43.3-64.2 lM) moderately inhibited SARS-CoV 3CL pro activity.

The SARS-CoV PL pro inhibitory potency of the prenyl flavone was considerably higher than that of flavone derivatives, including keampferol (IC 50 \u00bc 16.3 lM), quercetin (IC 50 \u00bc 8.6 lM), and quercetin-b-galactoside (IC 50 \u00bc 51.9 lM). It is probable that the presence of a prenyl group within the resorcinol group allows for the formation of strong hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme. Additionally, an increase in the number of hydroxyl groups in the flavone backbone resulted in higher inhibitory activity, which can be noted from the lower IC 50 value of quercetin (8.6 lM) compared to that of kaempferol (IC 50 \u00bc 16.3 lM).

In contrast, the number of prenyl groups and the degree of saturation did not have any effect on the prenylated flavans. As shown in Table 1 6 exhibited moderate inhibitory activity (IC 50 values ranging from 30.4 to 35.8 lM). Additionally, compound 10, which contains a methoxy group that is also present in the corresponding biphenyl propanoids, was two-fold more effective (IC 50 \u00bc 15.2 lM) than the unmethylated 9.",

In this study, SARS-CoV PL pro was immobilized on a sensor chip and the most potent PL pro inhibitor, compound 4, was passed over the sensor's surface. As shown in Figure 5 , the interaction of compound 4 with SARS-CoV PL pro was due to a specific binding event. The SPR sensorgram was recorded at different concentrations of the compound and was used to determine the kinetic-binding parameters, the association rate constant (k a lM \u00c0 1 s \u00c0 1 ), and the dissociation rate constant (k d , s \u00c0 1 ). For SARS-CoV PL pro , compound 4 increased the SPR sensorgram in a significant and dose-dependent manner. The K D (k d /k a ) for the interaction between compound 4 and SARS-CoV PL pro indicated a classical interaction, with k a \u00bc 21.0 lM \u00c0 1 s \u00c0 1 , k d \u00bc 0.004448 s \u00c01 , and K D \u00bc 212 lM.

            "text": "In recent year, PL pro has been the focus of numerous studies on the development of chemotherapeutic drugs against CoVinduced diseases. It is part of the nsp3 protein, and cleaves at the nsp1/2, nsp2/3 and nsp3/4 boundaries by recognizing the LXGG consensus motif. In addition, PL pro exhibits deubiquitinating (DUB) activity and antagonizes the induction of type-1 interferon (IFN). Interferon-stimulated gene 15 is one of the most upregulated genes upon type I IFN stimulation and is involved in tagging newly synthesized proteins during an antiviral response. Both ubiquitin and ISG15 may have important implications in viral replication and pathogenesis. SARS-CoV PL pro can cleave ubiquitin and ISG15 from cellular conjugates. Similarly, MERS-CoV PL pro has also been shown to possess DUB and deISG15ylating activities. Thus, an effective anti-CoV drug is one that inhibits viral protease activity as well as DUB and deISG15ylating activities. Since 4 inhibits SARS-CoV PL pro , we postulated that its efficacy would be higher by having DUB and deISG15ylating activities. Compound 4 strongly inhibited the cleavage of both ubiquitin and ISG15 (IC 50 values of 7.6 and 8.5 lM, respectively). Complete substitution of prenyl groups (4 vs. quercetin, IC 50 values of 20.7 and 34.4 lM, respectively) and introduction of hydroxyl groups strongly affected activity (quercetin vs. kaempferol, IC 50 values of 61.7 and 71.7 lM, respectively). All of the tested compounds display moderate inhibition of in vitro cleavage of ubiquitin (IC 50 \u00bc 7.6-136.9 lM) and ISG15 (IC 50 \u00bc 8.5-71.7 lM) ( Table 1) . To date, the function of the DUB activity of PL pro in vivo is unknown, as is the identity of its in vivo cellular substrate. Thus, further investigation is necessary to determine the specificity of its inhibition by measuring the cleavage of ubiquitin-like protein ISG15, which could reveal whether deISGylation by PL pro is a mechanism by which SARS-CoV inactivates IFN-a/b-induced innate immune response.",

The IC 50 values of these compounds, though higher than those of peptide-derived inhibitors, were still in the low micromolar range.

The prenylated quercetin derivative 4, showed the most potent PL pro inhibitory activity (IC 50 \u00bc 3.7 lM). Additionally, we performed detailed protein-inhibitor SPR-binding analyses of compound 4 with SARS-CoV PL pro .
