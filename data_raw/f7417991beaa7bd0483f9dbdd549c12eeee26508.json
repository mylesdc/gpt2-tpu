As such, prolonged glial activation, as is thought to occur during a persistent viral infection of the CNS, may contribute to both neurodegeneration and demyelination. However, the effects of virus-induced glial activation on oligodendrocytes are not fully understood. Method: To determine the effects of glial activation on oligodendrocyte viability we treated primary glial cultures isolated from neonatal rats or mice with the RNA viral mimic poly(I:C) and in some cases other TLR ligands. TLR3 expression was determined by western blot. Cytokine levels were measured by RT-PCR, ELISA, and intracellular cytokine staining. Oligodendrocyte precursor (preOL) viability was determined by Alamar blue assays and immunocytochemistry.",

            "text": "Result: Stimulation of mixed glial cultures with poly(I:C) resulted in microglia activation, TNF\u03b1 production and preOL toxicity. This toxic effect of poly(I:C) was indirect as it failed to affect preOL viability in pure cultures despite the fact that preOLs express TLR3. Poly(I:C)-induced loss of preOLs was abolished in TNF\u03b1 or TNFR1 deficient mixed glial cultures, suggesting that TNF\u03b1/TNFR1 signaling is required for poly(I:C) toxicity. Furthermore, although both microglia and astrocytes express functional TLR3, only microglia produced TNF\u03b1 in culture. Consistent with these findings, other TLR agonists similarly triggered TNF\u03b1 production and preOL toxicity in mixed glial cultures. Conclusion: Activation of microglia by poly(I:C) promotes TNF\u03b1/TNFR1-dependent oligodendroglial cell death. These data indicate that during an ongoing viral infection of the CNS, microglial TNF\u03b1 may be detrimental to oligodendrocytes.",

Specifically, no organized lymphoid tissues or professional antigen presenting cells are thought to exist in the healthy CNS parenchyma. However, both resident microglia and astrocytes have been shown to possess immune surveillance properties and are thought to contribute to the chemoattraction and stimulation of antigen primed T-cells [2, 3] . An innate ability to distinguish self from non-self is imperative for the limitation of pathogen spread, the stimulation of adaptive immune responses and the induction of tissue repair [4, 5] . Toll-like receptors (TLR), nucleotide-oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, and intracellular retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors all play an integral role in this process through the upregulation of cytokines, chemokines, and costimulatory molecules following ligation of specific pathogen associated molecular patterns [6] .",

The stimulation of mixed glial cultures with LPS provides a relevant model with which to study certain CNS white matter pathology brought on by gram-negative bacteria, which are thought to contribute to periventricular leukomalacia, a major cause of cerebral palsy. However, the use of LPS in vitro may not accurately reflect inflammatory responses of glial cells during a viral infection; particularly since the pattern recognition receptors that recognize LPS and poly(I:C) are distinct and unequally distributed in parenchymal cells [15] . Direct viral infection of glial cultures provides a relevant tool to model CNS viral-induced pathogenesis and/or tropism.

Following filtration through a sterile 70 \u03bcm filter to remove excess debris, the cells were counted and plated onto poly-d-lysine coated 75 cm 2 flasks or directly into 24-well plates for experiments using mixed glia. For mixed glial culture experiments, the medium was changed every other day and cells were treated after 7-8 days in vitro (DIV) in serum-free Basal Defined Medium (BDM: DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 50 \u03bcg/ml human apo-transferrin, 50 \u03bcg/ ml insulin, 30 nM sodium selenite, 10 nM D-biotin, and 10 nM hydrocortisone). For experiments involving mono and co-cultures, microglia were isolated by shaking the mixed glia-containing flasks for 1 h at 200 rpm. After removing microglia, the flasks were shaken overnight to separate preOLs from the astrocyte layer. Single cell suspensions from rat spleens [29] were used as a positive control for TLR3 western blot analysis. Briefly, the external capsule of the spleen was broken and cells passed through sterile 70 \u03bcm nylon mesh twice in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 \u00d7 g for 5 min and the red blood cells were lysed with ammonium chloride (0.01 M) in PBS for 3 min at 24\u00b0C.

In contrast, this cytotoxic effect was abolished in TNF\u03b1 deficient mixed glial cultures ( Figure  4C ). Deletion of the TNF\u03b1 receptor tnfr1 also abrogated the poly(I:C)-triggered TNF-mediated toxicity to preOLs ( Figure 4F ) despite a comparable level of TNF\u03b1 production in WT and TNFR1 -/cultures (Figure 4D) . These results demonstrate that TNF\u03b1 is required for oligodendroglial cell death in mixed cultures challenged with poly(I:C) or LPS and that the signal needed to induce cell death is dependent on TNFR1.",

To determine the cellular source of TNF\u03b1 secretion in our cultures, purified microglia, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes were treated with PBS or poly(I:C) for 24 h and TNF\u03b1 levels were determined by ELISA. We found that microglia, but neither astrocytes nor oligodendrocytes, produced TNF\u03b1 following poly(I:C) stimulation ( Figure 5A ). To confirm this finding, we then conducted RT-PCR analysis on RNA isolated from microglia and astrocyte monocultures stimulated with or without poly(I:C) for 24 h. Both microglia and astrocytes expressed TLR3. TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 transcripts were induced by poly(I:C) in microglia, but undetectable in astrocytes. Moreover, transcription of IL-6 was evident in stimulated microglia and in poly(I:C) stimulated astrocytes ( Figure 5B ). The expression of the macrophage/microglia marker Iba-1 and astrocyte marker GFAP from the same samples indicated that there was virtually no microglia contamination of astrocyte cultures, but some astrocyte contamination in microglia cultures ( Figure 5B ). Additionally, microglia but not astrocytes responded to poly(I:C) by producing TNF\u03b1 in a dose-and time-dependent fashion ( Figure 5C ). These results strongly indicate that microglia are the producers of TNF\u03b1 in mixed glial cultures.",

Again, while stimulation of astrocytes with poly(I:C) resulted in negligible TNF\u03b1 transcription we observed marked up-regulation of both CCL2 and CCL5 in a time-and dose-dependent fashion (Figure 5F ), which was further confirmed by qRT-PCR analyses ( Figure 5G-J) .

Similar to what we have shown previously after LPS challenge [24, 25] , the toxicity triggered by poly(I:C) is also dependent on the TNF\u03b1/TNFR1 pathway. Because ligation of other TLRs on microglia can also induce TNF\u03b1 production [31] , we questioned whether stimulation of mixed glia with additional TLR ligands could also result in reduced preOL viability. Indeed, stimulation of mixed cultures with TLR1/2 agonist Pam3CSK4 or TLR7/8 agonist R848 triggered TNF\u03b1 production (Table 1) with LPS stimulation causing significantly more TNF\u03b1 production than any other TLR agonists tested. All tested TLR agonists resulted in a significant reduction in O4 + cell viability that was most pronounced following treatment with LPS and R848 ( Figure 6 ). Together, these data support a role for aberrant TNF\u03b1 production in mediating preOL death.",

TNF\u03b1 was derived exclusively from activated microglia as astrocytes neither secreted TNF\u03b1 nor expressed intracellular TNF\u03b1 following poly(I:C) stimulation. This was surprising as astrocytes clearly express TLR3 [7, 15, [32] [33] [34] , RIG-I [10, 35] and MDA-5 [11] and have been shown to produce TNF\u03b1 in vivo [36] [37] [38] [39] . As these receptors are predominantly intracellular, a plausible explanation for these results could be the exogenous manner of the treatment. However, the fact that astrocytes up-regulated chemokines CCL2 and CCL5, but failed to induce TNF\u03b1 indicates that exogenous poly(I: C) is capable of activating astrocytes thereby excluding the above possibility. In line with this finding, several recent studies have demonstrated that astrocytes stimulated with exogenous poly(I:C) dramatically increase cytokines IL-6, IFN-\u03b2, IL-8 and chemokine CCL2 and CCL5, but produce only negligible amounts of TNF\u03b1 [11, 27] . Moreover, flow cytometric analysis by Zhou et al. convincingly demonstrates that while astrocytes express CCL2 following Pam3CSK4, poly(I:C) or LPS stimulation or LCMV infection, they do not express TNF\u03b1 [40] . Together, these results strongly indicate either that, microglia are far superior at TNF\u03b1 production when compared to astrocytes in vitro or that TNF\u03b1 production in astrocyte cultures is attributable to residual microglia.",

As with other studies, the current set of experiments implicates aberrant TNF\u03b1 production in the demise of oligodendrocytes [17, 24, 41, 42] , but the exact role of TNF\u03b1 in the pathogenesis of demyelination in vivo are not yet fully understood. For instance, stimulation of mixed glial cultures with LPS results in TNF\u03b1 production, which is toxic to oligodendrocytes in vitro [17, 24, 43] . TNF\u03b1 has also been shown to be directly toxic to oligodendrocytes in vitro [44] . Moreover, in transgenic mice in which astrocytes express transmembrane TNF\u03b1 demonstrate oligodendrocyte death and develop demyelination [42] . In agreement with this observation, we have shown that both astrocytes and oligodendroglial TNFR1 are required for TNF\u03b1-mediated oligodendrocyte toxicity in vitro [25] . Furthermore, direct cell-cell contact between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes mediates the TNF\u03b1 toxicity. Therefore, accumulating data suggest that microglia as well as astrocytes are required for TLR agonist induced preOL toxicity. It is important to note that the mixed glial cultures used in this study did not contain neurons. As functional neurons constitutively express several immunoregulatory molecules such as CD200 [45] and CX3CL1 [46] that are capable of modulating microglia activation and cytokine production, it is possible that stimulation of mixed neuronal cultures with poly(I:C) might mitigate the toxic effect on preOL. Thus, future experiments are needed to examine the effect of neurons on microglia inflammatory responses and preOL viability. However, several lines of evidence indicate that TLR ligation can contribute to tissue destruction within the CNS. For instance, stereotaxic injection of zymosan, a TLR2 ligand, into either the corpus callosum [20] or spinal cord [21] causes microglia activation and demyelination. Likewise, stereotaxic injection of LPS into the spinal cord induces demyelination [19] . Moreover, poly(I:C) injection into the substantia nigra pars compacta was shown to trigger microglia activation and neurodegeneration at high doses or susceptibility to neurodegeneration at subtoxic levels [18] . While these studies suggest that acute microglia activation subsequent to TLR ligation is detrimental to the surrounding tissues, certainly not all microglial responses result in neurodegeneration. Some can in fact promote tissue repair [4] . For instance, intravitreal injection of zymosan is associated with an increase in TGF\u03b21 and IL-1\u03b2 production and induces myelination of retina [47] ; and LPS treatment concurrent to detergent ethidium bromide-induced demyelination promotes repair, possibly through the recruitment of oligodendrocyte progenitors to the lesion [48] .",

            "text": "Likewise, not all studies have assigned a detrimental role to TNF\u03b1 in the CNS. For example, while injection of recombinant TNF\u03b1 into the optic nerve resulted in demyelination [49] , repeated intracerebral injection of TNF\u03b1 resulted in hemorrhage, reactive gliosis and infiltration of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells but appeared to have no cytolytic effects [50] . Moreover, in the cuprizone model of toxic demyelination, which is characterized by extensive reactive gliosis, TNF\u03b1 -/mice exhibit delayed demyelination but also impaired remyelination [36] . In addition, it has recently been shown that the resolution of pathology following virus-induced encephalitis requires TNF\u03b1 for repair in the striatum and the hippocampus through TNFR1 and TNFR2 respectively [51] . On the other hand, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of TNFR1 -/were found to exhibit up to 80% fewer seizures during virusinduced encephalitis when compared to control mice [52] . Ambiguous effects of TNF\u03b1 have also been demonstrated in multiple sclerosis. Elevated TNF\u03b1 levels in the cerebral spinal fluid of MS patients precede exacerbation and correlate with disease progression [39] . TNF\u03b1 immunoreactivity has been localized to astrocytes on the lesion edge but not in the lesion center of MS patients [37] . Furthermore, increased expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in oligodendrocytes at the edge of chronic active lesions was reported [53, 54] . While these findings suggest an involvement for TNF\u03b1 in the pathogenesis of MS, treatment with monoclonal neutralizing anti-TNF\u03b1 antibodies as well as neutralizing soluble receptors has, paradoxically, resulted in MS disease exacerbation [55, 56] . Even more alarming, anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients has been associated with the onset of monophasic demyelination including optic neuritis that subsided after treatment withdrawal [57] [58] [59] [60] and with the onset of MS [57, 61] . As the capacity for TNF\u03b1 therapy to neutralize CNS TNF\u03b1 was not directly examined, these data may imply that peripheral TNF\u03b1 is somehow required for maintaining demyelinating disease quiescence. Although the underlying mechanism remains unknown the recent finding that increased susceptibility to MS is associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism within the sixth intron of the tnfr1 gene calls upon further investigation as to the role the TNF\u03b1/TNFR1 pathway in this disease [62, 63] .",

            "text": "Toll-like receptor expression is not equally represented across different populations of resident CNS cells. Since TLR3, a recognition receptor for double-stranded RNA viruses, is present in all glia, the current study tested the hypothesis that stimulation of mixed glia with the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) would exhibit different outcomes than those following LPS stimulation. Utilizing poly(I:C) to model the bystander effects of glial activation on preOL viability following RNA viral infection, we found that over-activation of glia, specifically microglia, reduced preOL viability in mixed glial cultures. Mechanistically, this toxicity was dependent on TNF\u03b1/TNFR1 signaling. Extending on these findings we observed that activation of TLR1/2 and TLR7/8 had similar effects on preOLs. Thus, our data indicate that uncontrolled production of TNF\u03b1 in the CNS upon viral infection may consequentially contribute to oligodendrocyte death and demyelination.",
