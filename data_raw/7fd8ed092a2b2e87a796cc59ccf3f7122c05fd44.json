            "text": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated autophagy plays significant roles in replication and pathogenesis of many animal viruses. However, the relationship between ER stress, autophagy, and viral replication during in vivo and in vitro infection of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) remains unclear. In this study, we established a pig model for CSFV infection and found that viral loads of CSFV differed in 10 kinds of infected organs, and that the degree of tissue lesions was to some extent positively correlated with CSFV replication in vivo. Next, we found that CSFV infection not only induced ER stress and subsequently activated three unfolded protein responses (UPR) pathways including protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6) pathways, but also triggered complete autophagy in main immune organs and partial nonimmune organs exhibiting severer pathological injuries and higher viral loads. However, only the IRE1 pathway and no autophagy were activated in some other nonimmune organs with slighter pathologies and lower viral loads. These results indicate a potential link between CSFV-induced ER stress and autophagy, both of which are associated with the CSFV replication in vivo. We further performed in vitro experiments and found that CSFV infection activates the PERK and IRE1 pathways and autophagy in cultured porcine kidney cell lines (PK-15) and macrophage cell lines (3D4/2), and pharmacological regulation of ER stress remarkably changed autophagic activities induced by CSFV, suggesting that CSFV-induced autophagy can be mediated by ER stress possibly via the PERK and IRE1 pathway. Furthermore, treatment with ER stress regulators significantly altered copy numbers of NS5B genes, expression of Npro proteins, and viral titers in CSFVinfected cells or in cells treated with autophagy regulators prior to CSFV infection, suggesting the requirement of ER stress-mediated autophagy for CSFV replication in vitro. Collectively, our data demonstrate that CSFV induces ER stress-mediated autophagy to sustain its replication in vivo and in vitro, which may be one of the potential strategies exploited by CSFV for immune evasion. This finding will provide new insights into mechanisms of replication and pathogenesis of CSFV, and development of new strategies for controlling CSF.",

As a member of the Pestivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family, CSFV contains an approximate 12.3-kb single-stranded sense RNA (ss(+)RNA) genome, encoding four structural proteins (C, Erns, E1, and E2) and eight non-structural proteins (Npro, P7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) (Tautz et al., 1999; Lefkowitz et al., 2018) . Acute infection of CSFV causes persistent high fever, hemorrhages in multiple organs, and neurological, respiratory, and gastrointestinal symptoms in pigs with a very high mortality rate, leading to huge economic losses to the pig industry worldwide (Moennig, 1992; Lohse et al., 2012) . Although clinical vaccinations can effectively prevent the outbreaks of CSF, there are no therapeutic drugs currently available on the market. CSFV replicates in leukocytes, especially in mononuclear macrophages, causing structural injuries and functional disorders in immune organs and subsequent immunosuppression in the diseased pigs (Floegel-Niesmann et al., 2003; Ji et al., 2015) . Many viruses have evolutionarily developed specific or nonspecific strategies to evade host immune responses, during which many biological processes mediating the interplay between virus and host can be used for maintaining effective replication, infection, and pathogenesis of viruses (Pei et al., 2014; Peacock et al., 2017; Ying et al., 2018) . However, mechanisms involved in CSFV replication and pathogenesis still need further investigations.",

            "text": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important membranous organelle in eukaryotic cells. Homeostasis of the ER is a guarantee of maintaining normal cell activities. When the cells are exposed to stimuli including hypoxia, calcium overload, and free radical attack, dysfunctions of the ER occur and lead to accumulation of the misfolded/unfolded proteins in the lumen of ER and the imbalance of calcium homeostasis, resulting in ER stress (To Sing et al., 2015; Cybulsky, 2017) . The ER responds to the burden of ER stress by activating a set of intracellular signaling pathways, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), to restore normal function of the ER. There are three branches of the UPR: protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6), which are not independent and together constitute a complex signaling network (Ron and Walter, 2007; Cybulsky, 2017) . Under normal physiological conditions, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) binds to the three sensor proteins and inhibits their activities. Upon ER stress, GRP78 dissociates from the sensors and binds to the unfolded/ misfolded proteins, and the released sensors are activated and initiate the following signaling pathways to alleviate ER stress through increasing protein-folding capacity of the ER, inhibiting global protein synthesis, and enhancing the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) of misfolded/ unfolded proteins (Cybulsky, 2017) . All these reactions aim to relieve the burden of ER and if they fail, they can trigger cellular dysfunction and eventually lead to cell death (Forman et al., 2003) . In the past few years, the essential roles of the UPR have been implicated in many mammalian diseases, especially in viral diseases. Induction of ER stress and activation of the UPR signaling are general host responses to flavivirus and coronavirus infection, because replication of these viruses is closely associated with ER-derived membranes, and large amounts of viral proteins inevitably disturb the ER homeostasis and cause ER stress (Lin et al., 2002; Ambrose and Mackenzie, 2011; Pe\u00f1a and Harris, 2011; Fung and Liu, 2014) . Our previous studies have revealed that CSFV infection induces the ER stress in the cultured porcine kidney PK-15 cells, benefiting its replication by activating the IRE1 pathway (He et al., 2017) . However, the relationship between CSFV infection in vivo and ER stressdriven UPR, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.",

            "text": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular degradation and recycling process in eukaryotic cells, which contains three major types: microautophagy, macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as \"autophagy\"), and chaperone-mediated autophagy. Of these three types, autophagy is the best studied autophagic process (Deretic and Klionsky, 2018) . During autophagic process, cytoplasmic components are sequestered into de novo-synthesized double-membrane vesicles termed autophagosomes, and then the formed autophagosomes fuse with the lysosomes for degradation and eventual recycling of the endocytosed macromolecules (Parzych and Klionsky, 2013; Deretic and Klionsky, 2018) . Generally, basic autophagy occurs in normal cells at a low level, nevertheless, when the cells undergo adverse conditions, such as stress, infection, and cancer, autophagy can be further enhanced to degrade cytoplasmic macromolecules into metabolites for the recycling process in these cells, allowing for cell survival (Yorimitsu and Klionsky, 2005) . Although autophagy functions as a pro-survival process in most cases by relieving the cells from various stress conditions (Gao et al., 2017) , it also can be exploited as an potential immune escape strategy by some viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV), and CSFV (Pei et al., 2014; Dash et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016) . Furthermore, excessive or uncontrolled autophagy even can trigger a form of non-apoptotic cell death, termed \"autosis, \" which is dependent on the activity of Na + / K + -ATPase and has unique morphological features (Liu et al., 2013; Liu and Levine, 2015) . Accordingly, dysregulated autophagy has been implicated in numerous human pathologies, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging (Levine, 2007; Sayak et al., 2014; Onorati et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "Autophagy is tightly regulated by several cellular signaling pathways, two typical pathways involved in nutrient starvationinduced autophagy are negatively regulated by the cAMPdependent protein kinase A (PKA) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, respectively (Stephan et al., 2010) . Besides, the ER stress-mediated autophagy has been studied extensively for years, and the complicated crosstalk between ER stress and autophagy has been proposed (Ron and Walter, 2007; Senft and Ronai, 2015) . Evidences have revealed that many stimuli-induced ER stress can trigger autophagy either through the Ca 2+ -mediated AMPK signaling or through the UPR signaling (Yoshiyasu et al., 2013; Zaouali et al., 2013; Rashid et al., 2015) . All the three UPR pathways of PERK, ATF-6, and IRE1 have been demonstrated to participate in autophagy induction, however, which UPR pathway is activated to mediate the induction of autophagy, and whether the cytoprotective autophagy or the autophagic cell death is induced in response to the ER stress, probably depend on the extent and type of stress, as well as the type of cells (Xing et al., 2007; He and Klionsky, 2009) . Therefore, the molecular mechanisms involved in ER stress-mediated autophagy and the relationship between ER stress-mediated autophagy and diseases, still need further investigations. Our previous studies have demonstrated that CSFV-induced autophagy is beneficial to its replication, which is probably mediated by the suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent apoptosis in the cultured cell lines (Pei et al., 2014 (Pei et al., , 2016 . However, the relationship between ER stress, autophagy, and viral replication during in vivo and in vitro infection of CSFV still needs to be clarified.",

About 1 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 /ml viral stock was intramuscularly injected into bilateral neck of pigs for CSFV infection (Luo et al., 2017; Gou et al., 2017a) , and the mock-infected pigs were only injected with the same volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Anal temperature of pigs from each group was measured everyday till 7 days postinfection (dpi) by a mercury thermometer. Clinical symptoms of the experimental pigs were observed and recorded daily, and clinical score (CS) values were calculated as described by Mittelholzer et al. (2000) to evaluate the situation of CSFV infection. Briefly, the calculation of CS values was obtained by evaluating 10 CSF clinical signs, including liveliness, body tension, body shape, breathing, walking, skin, eyes/conjunctiva, appetite, defecation, and leftovers in feeding trough. Each parameter was judged as either normal (score 0), slightly altered (score 1), distinct clinical sign (score 2), or severe CSF symptom (score 3). Scores from these parameters were assessed and totalized daily (maximum score: 30). This system for judging virulence based on the CS (CS > 15 and fever>41\u00b0C as a highly virulent strain; 15 \u2265 CS >5 and 41\u00b0C \u2265 fever \u2265 40\u00b0C as a moderately virulent strain; CS \u2264 2 and fever<40\u00b0C as a low or avirulent strain) has been used by many laboratories (Mittelholzer et al., 2000; Floegel-Niesmann et al., 2003;  Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 4 November 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 2545 Everett et al., 2010; Luo et al., 2017) . Pigs were sacrificed at 7 dpi, and pathological changes of immune organs (tonsil, thymus, spleen, and inguinal lymph node) and non-immune organs (heart, lung, liver, kidney, brain, and intestine) were observed and analyzed. To confirm the infection of CSFV, E2 structural genes and E2 proteins in the collected immune organs (tonsil, thymus, spleen, and inguinal lymph node) were detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays, respectively. In our study, three pigs randomly selected from each group were sacrificed according to animal welfare and then subject to the following tests and analyses, at the meantime, these pigs and the rest pigs were altogether used in other omics studies performed by our team.",

To clarify the relationship between CSFV infection in vivo and ER stress, we investigated the effect of CSFV infection on the expression of UPR-related molecules in the immune and non-immune organs collected from the experimental pigs by Western blot analyses. The status of CSFV infection has been demonstrated by real-time RT-PCR and IHC assays (Figures 1D, 3B-D) . Here we found that CSFV infection caused a significant increase in GRP78 expression in all of the collected organs, suggesting the occurrence of ER stress. However, the degree of ER stress differs in infected organs. Specifically, all of the three UPR pathways (PERK, IRE1, and ATF-6) were activated in the immune organs (tonsil, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes) and partial non-immune organs (lung, kidney, and intestine), as demonstrated by increasing protein expressions in phosphorylated (p)-IRE1, cleaved ATF-6, and p-PERK, as well as their downstream targets including GRP78, p-eIF2\u03b1, ATF-4, and CHOP (Figures 4A-G) , suggesting the induction of a serious ER stress in these organs. However, only the IRE1 pathway was activated in the heart, liver, and brain (Figures 4H-J) . Of note, the PERK pathways in these organs were significantly suppressed, demonstrated by the decreasing protein expression in downstream targets of PERK, including p-eIF2\u03b1, ATF-4, and CHOP. Besides, no obvious activation of ATF-6 pathway was obtained in these organs. Taken into account the above results, our results suggested that CSFV-induced ER stress appeared to be more serious in the organs with severer pathological changes and higher viral titers, while relatively mild ER stress was detectable in organs with slighter pathological changes and lower viral titers, which implied that ER stress-mediated UPR pathways are associated with CSFV replication in vivo.",

Many viruses have developed specific strategies to regulate autophagy for effective infection (Pei et al., 2014; Dash et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016) . Our previous study has revealed that CSFV-induced autophagy is beneficial to its replication in vitro (Pei et al., 2014) , while the details in vivo and the underlying mechanism need to be further investigated. ER stress-driven UPR is one of the important pathways to regulate autophagy. To determine the relationship between CSFV-induced autophagy and ER stress during in vivo infection of CSFV, we further investigated the effect of CSFV infection on the expression of autophagic proteins in immune and non-immune organs from the experimental pigs by Western blot analyses. The results showed that CSFV infection caused significantly increase in ATG5, Beclin1 and LC3-II accumulations, with the concomitant decrease in autophagy substrate p62 in immune organs including spleen, inguinal lymph nodes, tonsils and thymus (Figures 5A-D) , as well as in non-immune organs of lung, kidney and intestine (Figures 5E-G) from the CSFV-infected pigs, indicating the induction of complete autophagy in these organs. In contrast, no significant changes in ATG5, Beclin1 and LC3-II expression were detectable in the non-immune organs, including heart, liver and brain from CSFV-infected pigs (Figures 5H-J) , indicating that no autophagy is induced in these organs, and that CSFV-induced activation of autophagy in pigs is to some extent tissue-specific. Taken into consideration the results of pathological changes and viral loads, as well as activation of UPRs, our results showed that CSFV infection in vivo induces serious ER stress and autophagy in the organs with severer pathological changes and higher viral titers, while relatively mild ER stress and no autophagy was detectable in organs with slighter pathological changes and lower viral titers, suggesting that CSFVinduced ER stress and autophagy are associated with the replication of CSFV in infected organs, and that CSFV-induced ER stress may be linked to autophagy, which needs to be further confirmed.",

However, no cytopathogenic effect is detectable in cultured cells infected with CSFV (Ruggli et al., 2005) , making it difficult to fully understand the replication and pathogenesis of CSFV. Apart from apoptosis, several biological processes mediating the interplay between virus and host, such as ER stress and autophagy, have attracted numerous researchers' focuses and have been implicated in the replication and pathogenesis of viruses (Lin et al., 2002; Dash et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; He et al., 2017) . Our previous studies have revealed that CSFV infection induces ER stress and autophagy to facilitate viral replication in vitro (Pei et al., 2014; He et al., 2017) , however, the details in vivo and the underlying mechanism remain to be further investigated. In the present study, we found that CSFV infection in pigs differentially induced ER stress and autophagy in several organs, which were to some extent tissuespecific and associated with the replication of CSFV. In vitro experiments further confirmed the ER stress-mediated autophagy as a potential strategy used by CSFV to sustain its replication, which suggests a possible immune escape mechanism of CSFV and will provide new insight into the mechanisms involved in replication and pathogenesis of CSFV.",

Histopathology analysis of the organs from the CSFV-infected pigs showed that CSFV infection caused varying degrees of hemorrhagic necrotizing inflammation and dramatic lymphocytes depletion in several organs, and that the severities of tissue injury in immune organs, kidney, lung and intestine were higher than those in other organs, which are similar with previous several studies associated with tissue tropism of CSFV (Liu et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2011) . Tissue injuries of immune organs and massive reduction of lymphocytes caused by CSFV infection may be the main reason of immunosuppression in the diseased pigs. We further found the severities of tissue injury are positively correlated with tissue viral loads of CSFV. Although the differential tissue tropism and replication of CSFV in pigs have also been detected in some other studies (Liu et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2011) , the underlying mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are seldom investigated, which encourages us to explore potential factors responsible for differential replication of CSFV in vivo. Based on our previous studies, ER stress-mediated autophagy becomes our preference.",

            "text": "Perturbation of the ER homeostasis by various stimuli can trigger ER stress in eukaryotic cells. Then the cells evoke a highly conserved mechanism to alleviate ER stress and re-establish ER homeostasis by activating three UPR pathways: PERK, IRE1 and ATF-6 ( Ron and Walter, 2007; Cybulsky, 2017) . The activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 and results in global translational attenuation to alleviate the immediate pressure on the ER. However, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 allows for preferential translation of ATF-4 to up-regulate the genes involved in restoring ER homeostasis (Renata and Reed, 2013) . Upon activation, the phosphorylated IRE1 cleaves a 26-nucleotide intron from the X box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA to generate an active transcription factor XBP1(s), which up-regulates UPR genes encoding ER chaperones and components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery to restore ER homeostasis (Renata and Reed, 2013; Li et al., 2015) . Activated ATF-6 translocates to the Golgi apparatus for cleavation, and then the cleaved ATF-6 fragment translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of ER chaperones for promoting protein folding, transport, and ER expansion (Renata and Reed, 2013) . Emerging evidences indicate that a great number of viruses can induce ER stress and differentially activate the three UPR pathways during their infection (Lin et al., 2002; Pe\u00f1a and Harris, 2011; Dash et al., 2016) . To explore the potential factors responsible for different tissue viral titers during CSFV infection in vivo, we further studied the effect of CSFV infection on ER stress in pigs and found that CSFV infection induced ER stress and subsequently activated the PERK, IRE1 and ATF-6 pathways in main immune organs and partial nonimmune organs exhibiting severer pathological injuries and higher viral loads. The increasing expression in the activated sensor proteins (p-PERK, p-IRE1, and cleaved ATF-6) and their downstream targets (p-eIF2\u03b1, ATF-4, CHOP, and GRP78) probably alleviate CSFV-induced serious ER stress in pigs, attempting to provide a suitable condition for efficient virus replication. The UPR can adapt to changing severity and duration of ER stress and trigger apoptosis when the stress cannot be overcome. CHOP, an important targets driven by ATF-4, is involved in the apoptotic cell death under prolonged or strong ER stress (Renata and Reed, 2013; To Sing et al., 2015) . Of note, the increasing expression in CHOP induced by CSFV may be associated with the elevated caspase-3 and PARP cleavation, together contributing to apoptotic cell death in organs suffering severe ER stress (data not shown). The remarkable lymphocyte reduction is very likely attributed to the ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Nevertheless, whether ER stress-mediated apoptosis is induced and its underlying mechanisms during CSFV infection need further confirmation. Unlike the organs mentioned above, only the IRE1 pathway was activated in partial nonimmune organs with slighter pathological changes and lower viral loads, and the ATF-6 and PERK pathways were inactive or even suppressed, suggesting a mild ER stress in these organs. Therefore, it is suggested that CSFV-induced ER stress and activation of UPR are probably associated with CSFV replication in vivo.",

            "text": "As an evolutionarily conserved cellular degradation and recycling process in eukaryotic cells, autophagy functions as a pro-survival mechanism in most cases by relieving the cells from adverse conditions, such as nutrient deprivation and pathogen infection (Lum et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2013) , however, dysfunctional autophagy can trigger autophagic cell death (Liu and Levine, 2015) . Autophagy has been implicated in numerous viral diseases and is to some degree virusspecific. Some viruses (herpes simplex virus type 1 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1) can inhibit autophagic activities to enhance viral replication (Orvedahl et al., 2007; Kyei et al., 2009) , while some viruses (DENV, influenza A virus, HCV and Muscovy duck reovirus) induce autophagy as a strategy to facilitate replication (Ray et al., 2008; Marl\u00e8ne et al., 2009; Zhi et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2017) . Basing on our previous finding that autophagy enhances the replication of CSFV in cultured cells (Pei et al., 2014) , here we found that CSFV infection significantly increased the expression of autophagic markers in main immune organs and partial nonimmune organs exhibiting severer pathological injuries and higher viral loads, including LC3-II, Beclin1 and ATG5, which are involved in the nucleation, elongation and maturation of the autophagosome and are commonly used indicators for assessing autophagic activities (Hurley and Young, 2017; Lee et al., 2018) , suggesting induction of autophagy in these organs. In addition, a remarkable decrease in autophagy substrate p62, a prevalent marker for monitoring autophagic flux (Zhou et al., 2012) , suggested CSFV-induced complete autophagy in infected organs exhibiting severer pathological injuries and higher viral loads. By contrast, no obvious autophagy was detectable in the infected organs with slighter pathological changes and lower viral loads, which implies that induction of autophagy during CSFV infection in vivo is to some extent tissue-specific and may be associated with CSFV replication in vivo. Taking into account the results obtained from ER stress detection, we suggest that CSFV infection differentially induces ER stress and autophagy in infected organs of pigs, which are probably associated with tissue injuries and tissue viral titers in these organs, and that there exists a potential link between CSFV-induced ER stress and autophagy.",

            "text": "ER stress-mediated autophagy has been well studied in the past several years (Ron and Walter, 2007; Song et al., 2018) . Accumulating evidences have revealed that many viruses can trigger autophagy through the UPR signaling pathways (Yoshiyasu et al., 2013; Rashid et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2018) , however, which UPR pathway is activated to mediate autophagic activities, and whether a cytoprotective autophagy or an autophagic cell death is induced upon ER stress, probably depend on the types of viruses and cells (Zhang and Wang, 2012; Parzych and Klionsky, 2013) . As mentioned above, we have suggested a potential link between CSFV-induced ER stress and autophagy. To further confirm this relationship, we performed in vitro experiments and found that CSFV infection not only caused ER stress and activated UPR pathways, but also induced complete autophagy in cultured PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells, which were in line with our previous findings in vitro (Pei et al., 2014; He et al., 2017) . However, there exist differences between the results obtained from the in vivo and in vitro experiments. Specifically, CSFV infection activated all three UPR pathways in infected organs with severe injury and only activated the IRE1 pathway in slightly injured organs, while cultured cells invoked the PERK and IRE1 pathways in response to CSFV infection at middle-late stage (24 hpi), which also can be evidenced by our previous study (He et al., 2017) . After invading the body, the viruses face an integrated system which can not be simulated by any other cell models in vitro. This may help explain the reason for these discrepancies. Evidences also reveal that some viruses including DENV and HCV, can differentially regulate the UPR at different infection stages through a mechanism associated with differential expression of viral proteins, thus contributing to effective replication of viruses (Merquiol et al., 2011; Pe\u00f1a and Harris, 2011) . Maybe, CSFV also activates UPR in a temporal manner, and the ATF-6 UPR pathway is probably suppressed to normal level by viral proteins at middle-late stage of CSFV infection for maintaining persist infection, which need further investigations. Anyway, our results showed that CSFV infection induces ER stress and autophagy in vivo and in vitro. We further found that pharmacological regulation of ER stress by ER stress agonists (TG) and inhibitors (4-PBA and TUDCA) remarkably changed the autophagic activities in CSFV-infected cells, suggesting that ER stress is required for CSFV-induced autophagy. Both 4-PBA and TUDCA are chemical chaperones that have been proven to mitigate ER stress through inhibition of PERK and IRE1 pathway (Uppala et al., 2017) . In our study, TG treatment remarkably increased p-PERK, p-IRE1 and GRP78 expression as well as autophagic indicators in CSFV-infected cells, while the use of both 4-PBA and TUDCA effectively alleviate CSFV-induced ER stress and autophagy in cells through inhibiting PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF-4/CHOP and IRE1/GRP78 axis, suggesting the requirement of PERK and IRE1 signalings for CSFV-induced autophagy. We also found another BIP inducer X (Bix) robustly increased protein expression of GRP78 and autophagy markers (data not shown), further confirming the involvement of GRP78 in ER stress-mediated autophagy during CSFV infection. Taken together, our data suggested that CSFV infection induces ER stress-mediated autophagy in vivo and in vitro, probably via activation of the PERK and IRE1 pathways.",

            "text": "The roles of ER stress-mediated autophagy played in response to viruses belonging to the same Flaviviridae can be different. ER stress-mediated autophagy is exploited as a replicationfavoring strategy by DENV and HCV (Dash et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2018) , rather than by Japanese encephalitis virus, which induces autophagy through ER stress to negatively influence viral replication (Sharma et al., 2017) . Considering this inconformity, we further investigated the effect of ER stressmediated autophagy on CSFV replication in vitro, and found that treatment with ER stress agonists (TG) or autophagy inducer (RAPA) remarkably increased CSFV replication in cultured cells, however the replication of CSFV was significantly reduced in the cells incubated in the presence of ER stress inhibitors (4-PBA and TUDCA) or autophagy inhibitor (3-MA), indicating that CSFV-induced ER stress and autophagy are beneficial to its replication, which is consistent with our pervious findings (Pei et al., 2014; He et al., 2017) . Since we have demonstrated that CSFV-induced autophagy is dependent on the ER stress (Figures 6-8) , ER stress-mediated autophagy can be a potential mechanism for sustaining CSFV replication. To further confirm this relationship, we analyzed the effect of combination of ER stress and autophagy regulators on CSFV replication in cultured cells, and found that treatment with ER stress regulators significantly altered autophagy-regulated viral replication in CSFV-infected cells, suggesting that the replication of CSFV can be regulated by ER stress-induced autophagy in cultured cells. Similar results have been obtained in other studies, while the underlying mechanisms involved in ER stress-mediated autophagy are different. HCV activates autophagy through three UPR pathways, including PERK, IRE1 and ATF-6, to sustain viral replication in the infected hepatocytes (Dash et al., 2016) . DENV-induced ER stress enhances autophagic activity and viral replication through the PERK and IRE1 signaling pathways both in vitro and in vivo (Lee et al., 2018) . ER stress-mediated autophagy contributes to bluetongue virus infection via the PERK signaling pathway (Lv et al., 2015) . From these findings, it can be seen that although cells can initiate the UPRs to relieve ER stress in response to virus infection, many viruses have evolved specific strategies to modulate the UPRs to sustain viral infection in host cells. Our preliminary findings also suggest the implication of the IRE1 and PERK signaling pathways in CSFV-induced autophagy and viral replication, but further confirmation is needed.",

Bar: 100 \u03bcm. In each panel, the upper left and upper left respectively show gross and microscopic lesions from mock-infected pigs, in which no pathological changes were observed; the lower left and lower right respectively show gross and microscopic lesions from pigs infected with CSFV, and varying degrees of hemorrhagic necrotizing inflammation could be seen in several organs. Histopathological changes as indicated by black arrows with different lengths can be seen in the panels. (A) Spleen, (B) inguinal lymph node, (D) thymus: short arrows indicate hemorrhage, and long arrows show lymphocyte necrosis and disintegration, accompanied with infiltration of inflammatory cells. (C) Tonsil: short arrows indicate flaky necrosis of lymphocytes, and long arrows show inflammatory cell infiltration around the necrotic foci. (E) Kidney: short arrows indicate severe hemorrhage in the superficial cortex, and long arrows show a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration in the mesenchyma. Alveolar atrophy and alveolar wall thickening (short arrow) as well as inflammatory cell infiltration (long arrow) can be seen in infected lung (F). Hepatocyte steatosis (short arrow) and interstitial cell hyperplasia with concomitant inflammatory cell infiltration (long arrow) in the portal area were observed in infected liver (G). No obvious histopathological changes were obtained in infected heart, except for slight swelling of cardiomyocytes (H).
