Keywords inTrODUcTiOn Dietary recommendation for the management of chronic gastroenteropathy in cats has included the use of both veterinary therapeutic elimination and veterinary therapeutic gastrointestinal formulas (1) (2) (3) . Veterinary elimination diets are designed to limit dietary antigens by incorporating uncommon or hydrolyzed protein ingredients and are utilized to diagnose and manage gastrointestinal and/or dermatologic conditions with an underlying food intolerance or food allergy. Veterinary gastrointestinal formulas differ in that they do not necessarily utilize unique or hydrolyzed protein sources but are designed with highly digestible ingredients to facilitate digestion and absorption of nutrients within a compromised gastrointestinal tract. Veterinary gastrointestinal formulas may also incorporate other dietary modifications such as adjustment of macronutrient distribution, fatty acid composition, and inclusion of dietary fibers and prebiotics. While nutritional intervention is commonly utilized to manage chronic gastroenteropathy in cats, there have only been a handful of reported studies evaluating the efficacy of nutritional intervention in naturally occurring disease (4-7). Guilford et al. showed that 49% of 55 cats with chronic gastrointestinal disease were responsive to dietary change, and 29% of the 55 demonstrated a food allergy or sensitivity with recrudescence of clinical signs upon diet re-challenge (4). In another study, eight cats with chronic diarrhea and/or vomiting responded to dietary therapy with a hydrolyzed diet after other medical and dietary interventions were unsuccessful (5) . Laflamme et al. demonstrated improvement in fecal score in 78.2% of 55 cats with chronic diarrhea fed either a low-fat (23% ME) or high-fat (45.1% ME) dry diet containing common ingredients (6) . Additionally, two canned therapeutic gastrointestinal formulas containing common ingredients were evaluated for the management of naturally occurring chronic diarrhea, demonstrating resolution to a normal fecal score in up to 46.7% of 15 cats (7).",

Vomiting is the primary clinical sign recognized in feline patients with chronic gastroenteropathy (4, 8, 9) . In the Guilford's study, vomiting was present in 51.4% of the cats, diarrhea in 31.4%, and vomiting and diarrhea in 17.1% (4) . Of patient visits to Banfield Pet Hospital \u00ae between 2008 and 2012, 1.4% of total feline visits per annum presented with chronic vomiting alone, 0.4% with chronic diarrhea alone, and 0.1% with both chronic vomiting and chronic diarrhea (8) . An evaluation of 100 feline cases of chronic small bowel disease suggested that diagnostic evaluation and implementation of dietary management is indicated in cats with vomiting as infrequently as two times per month (9) . While the use of elimination diets containing novel and hydrolyzed protein sources has been evaluated (4, 5) , to the authors' knowledge, no studies to date have evaluated the efficacy of feeding a nonspecific gastrointestinal therapeutic diet to cats with chronic gastroenteropathy with vomiting included as one of the primary clinical signs.",

Fixed effects in the model were week, diet, and the interaction between. The random effects were animal nested within clinic. For vomiting, the change from week 0 to weeks 1-4 for each diet and between diets was tested. For diarrhea, the change from week 1 to weeks 2-4 for each diet and between diets was tested. The negative binomial models were also used to test for an effect of positive fecal testing for FCoV, C. perfringens enterotoxin gene, and FCoV antibody on vomiting and diarrhea occurrences by changing the fixed effects to week and positive/negative and retaining the same contrasts. This same model was altered to have a response of the total vomiting occurrences over the 4 weeks and fixed effects of diet and age. Vomiting was also modeled against the initial Spec fPL values using a negative binomial model, as before, however with the change in vomiting from baseline as the interaction between. Random effects were animal nested within clinic. The same hypothesis tests were also performed comparing the change between weeks within and between diets.",

Total dietary fiber and the soluble and insoluble fractions were not analyzed in this study. These data would have helped to better characterize the dietary fiber composition of the diets; however, ingredient composition provides some insight as to how these two diets differ. Diet A utilized dried beet pulp, fructooligosaccharides, and mannanoligosaccharides, while Diet B utilized powdered cellulose followed by dried beet pulp. Based on the ingredient composition, Diet A would be expected to provide more fermentable fibers and prebiotics that may have promoted an increased production of total intraluminal short-chain fatty acids and positively influenced microbial populations (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . While dietary fiber and prebiotics are generally considered to provide benefits primarily within the large intestine and aid in the management of diarrhea, recent studies have demonstrated immune modulating benefits that could have broader benefits, particularly in conditions with an inflammatory nature (31, 32) . The time required to see potential clinical benefits is unclear, and clinical improvement related to immunomodulation may require more than 1-2 weeks of dietary intervention. Additional studies are needed to better understand the role of the microbiota in inflammatory gastrointestinal disease and the potential benefits of dietary fibers and prebiotics in animals with chronic gastroenteropathies.",

Additional numbers may have been required to demonstrate a significant difference in Diet B and between the two dietary interventions. This study also relied on a comparison to baseline versus a comparison to a non-therapeutic control formula. A non-therapeutic control would have been ideal for establishing effectiveness of the therapeutic diets; however, due to ethical considerations, all study participants were provided with a therapeutic dietary intervention. Additionally, this study relied on the owner's recall to establish the baseline weekly vomiting frequency. A recorded baseline would have been preferred; however, it was decided that it was not in the cats' best interest to delay dietary intervention. Finally, the lack of significance may have been influenced by the variability of clinical disease within individual cats. It was appreciated in this study that while most cats had a progressive decline of vomiting occurrences, some cats had episodic occurrences of vomiting that varied from week to week (Figure 1 ). The 4-week feeding period was chosen to approximate a reasonable duration for a dietary trial with a gastrointestinal therapeutic formula before additional diagnostic procedures and/or medical treatments would be employed to better characterize and manage the underlying disease. While this study did not follow the cats beyond the 4-week period, it would have been optimal to evaluate this cohort for 4-6 months to identify whether there were recrudescence of clinical signs and any differences between the two diet groups long term.",
