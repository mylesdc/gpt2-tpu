            "text": "Machupo virus (MACV) is a highly pathogenic New World arenavirus that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans. MACV, as well as other pathogenic New World arenaviruses, enter cells after their GP1 attachment glycoprotein binds to their cellular receptor, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). TfR1 residues essential for this interaction have been described, and a co-crystal of MACV GP1 bound to TfR1 suggests GP1 residues important for this association. We created MACV GP1 variants and tested their effect on TfR1 binding and virus entry to evaluate the functional significance of some of these and additional residues in human and simian cells. We found residues R111, D123, Y122, and F226 to be essential, D155, and P160 important, and D114, S116, D140, and K169 expendable for the GP1-TfR1 interaction and MACV entry. Several MACV GP1 residues that are critical for the interaction with TfR1 are conserved among other New World arenaviruses, indicating a common basis of receptor interaction. Our findings also open avenues for the rational development of viral entry inhibitors.",

The Large segment encodes a matrix protein (Z) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L); the Small segment encodes a nucleoprotein (NP) and the glycoprotein precursor GPC [2] . GPC is cleaved by a cellular protease to a stable signal peptide (SSP), and two subunits, GP1 and GP2. The three cleavage products form a stable complex and mediate virus attachment to host cells and fusion of the arenavirion envelope with that of the cell [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] . GP1 mediates the binding of the virion to a cell-surface receptor, whereas the class I fusion protein GP2 mediates membrane fusion after internalization of the virion into an acidified endosome [16, 17] . Interrupting the interaction of GP1 with its cell-surface receptor is a current focus of antiviral development since it would prevent the first and pivotal step of arenavirus host-cell infection.",

Conversely, until recently the TfR1-binding site on arenavirus GP1 has been poorly characterized. One study showed that the 20 N-terminal amino acids of MACV GP1 are dispensable for TfR1-binding as a MACV GP1 variant lacking these residues (MACV GP1D, residues 79-258) binds hTfR1 even more efficiently than wild-type GP1 [17] . A second study demonstrated that the central region of GTOV GP1 (residues 85-221) interacts with hTfR1 and that residues 159-221 are essential for this interaction [23] . A recently published crystal structure of a truncated MACV GP1 (region 87-239) [24] , as well as a co-crystal structure of the MACV GP1:TfR1 complex [25] provided structural insight of GP1 residues that contact TfR1. The latter study identified five interaction motifs in the interface between MACV GP1 and the apical domain of TfR1 involving some relatively conserved GP1 residues, such as D114 (motif 2), D123 (motif 4), and F226 (motif 3) (colored red, Fig. 1 ), some less conserved residues, such as Y122 (motif 4) and K169 (motif 4) (colored blue, Fig. 1 ), as well as some nonconserved residues, such as R111 (motif 1),and S116 (motif 2) (colored green, Fig. 1 ) [25] . To evaluate experimentally the functional significance of these residues and other conserved solvent-accessible MACV GP1 residues in TfR1-mediated entry, we created a panel of MACV GP1 variants replacing the mentioned amino acids with alanine, and tested the variants' ability to bind hTfR1 and mediate MACV entry in simian and human cells experimental systems.",

Briefly, we designed codon-optimized open reading frames (ORFs) of MACV GP1D in which one or more of the chosen residues were mutated to alanine, and generated them by gene synthesis (DNA2.0). These ORFs were cloned into a pCDM8-like expression vector [17, 26] with the signal sequence of human CD5 upstream and the Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 downstream of the ORF. Fc alone and wild-type MACV GP1D-Fc, which was described previously [17] , served as controls. Proteins were purified as described [17, 26] : the individual plasmids were transfected into HEK 293T/17 cells (ATCC) using the calcium-phosphate method and grown in 293 SFM II medium (GIBCO-Invitrogen). Media were harvested and clarified, and Fc fusion proteins precipitated with protein A-sepharose Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare). Fc fusion proteins were eluted with 3 M MgCl 2 , dialyzed in PBS, and concentrated. Purified proteins were assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by Bio-Safe Coomassie staining (BIO-RAD), and measured using the Quant-iT Protein Assay kit (Invitrogen). All mutant plasmids expressed proteins ( Fig. 2A) . We evaluated the ability of the individual mutants to bind to hTfR1 using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays as described [17, 22, 26] . Briefly, HEK 293T/17 cells were transfected with plasmid encoding hTfR1 [17, 22] and lysed 48 h post transfection with RIPA Lysis and Extraction buffer (Thermo Scientific Pierce). Cleared lysates were added to equimolar amounts (200 nM) of Fc, MACV GP1D, or variants thereof, and bound proteins were immunoprecipitated with protein A-sepharose Fast Flow beads. hTfR1 in the cell lysate immunoprecipitates was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot using the WesternBreeze Chromogenic kit (Invitrogen) and a murine monoclonal anti-TfR1 antibody (Invitrogen).",

We performed cell-binding assays as described [17, 26] to determine the ability of these mutants to bind to the surface of MACV-permissive cells. Briefly, Fc constructs were added to 5610 5 Vero cells (ATCC) to a final concentration of 200 nM. Cells with bound proteins were incubated with a 1:40 dilution of FITC-conjugated anti-human Fc antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell-surface binding of constructs was detected by flow cytometry. Baseline fluorescence was determined by measuring cells treated only with the secondary antibody, which was then subtracted from binding values of the tested constructs and control proteins. Overall, cell-binding of mutants supported the co-IP results as mutants that precipitated hTfR1 exhibited high cell-surface binding and vice versa (Fig. 2C) . Exceptions were Y122, S116A and D114A/S116A (motif 2), which bound the cell-surface of Vero cells as or almost as efficiently as wt MACV GP1D, yet exhibited lower hTfR1 levels in the co-IP assays.

However, as the cell-entry assay results are in agreement with our results using purified proteins (Fig. 2B and 2C) , we suggest that the observed phenotype is not due to decreased incorporation levels but due to the mutations themselves. MACV GPC mutants N178A and D159A were not incorporated into MoMLV pseudotypes and therefore were unable to transduce either cell line. MACV GPC mutant W147A behaved unexpectedly in that it had no effect on MoMLV transduction efficiency, despite its decreased precipitation of hTfR1 and attachment to the cell surface of MACVpermissive cells (Fig. 2) . We hypothesize that W147A might be misfolded in the context of MACV GP1D but folded correctly in the context of full-length GPC. The two mutants with the most significant effect on cell entry were the R111A mutant and the triple mutant Y122A/D123A/K169A, exhibiting more than 70% reduction in MoMLV transduction efficiency when compared to wt GPC. Finally, the Y122A mutant, while minimally affecting entry into Vero cells, decreased MoMLV entry into HeLa cells. This is in agreement with our assays using purified proteins (Fig. 2) , in which the Y122A mutant bound efficiently to the cell surface of Vero cells (Fig. 2C) yet was unable to immunoprecipitate hTfR1.",

These results are in accordance with a recent study demonstrating that the central region of GTOV GP1 (residues 85-221) interacts with hTfR1 and that residues 159-221 are essential for this interaction [17] . These results are also in agreement with the recently published structure of MACV GP1 bound to hTfR1 [25] . MACV GP1 R111, which is not conserved in any of the other New World arenaviruses, is part of interaction motif 1 and makes prominent contacts with hTfR1 bII-2 strand, namely V210 (Fig. 1, top panel, and Fig. 4) . F226, unique to MACV (W in other New World arenaviruses), is part of interaction motif 3 and has a hydrophobic interaction with hTfR1 V210, as well as a van der Waals contact with hTfR1 I201 and L212 (Fig. 1, top panel, and Fig. 4 ). D123 and Y122 are part of interaction motif 4 and are conserved between MACV, JUNV, and SABV. D123 forms a hydrogen bond with hTfR1 K344, whereas Y122 forms one with hTfR1 E343 and in addition contacts hTfR1 residues A293, E294, and A340 (Fig. 1, top into HeLa cells (Fig. 3) . In accordance, this mutant bound efficiently to the cell surface of Vero cells (Fig. 2C ) yet was unable to immunoprecipitate hTfR1 (Fig. 2B) . These results suggest that Y122 might be important for binding hTfR1 but dispensable for binding simian TfR1, or that additional receptors/attachment factors are facilitating binding and entry of MACV into Vero cells. Whereas TfR1 residues E343, A293, and A340 are conserved among human and simian TfR1, glutamate 294 is an aspartate in simian TfR1 and the proximal asparagine 292 is a lysine.",

In the context of purified GP1D, mutation of these amino acids did not affect overall folding (Fig. 2D) , but in the context of GPC these mutants failed to be incorporated into MoMLV pseudotypes. These results suggest that mutagenesis of N178 and D159 might lead to small changes in folding of GP1 (not being detected by CD) that might affect accessibility of hTfR1-binding residues in their vicinity. Alternatively, trafficking, folding, or binding of GP1 to SSP or GP2 might be defective only in the context of full-length GPC. The MACV GP1-hTfR1 crystal structure revealed seven Nlinked glycans on Asn178 [25] . It is plausible that these glycans play an important role in MACV glycoprotein folding, trafficking, GP complex formation, or entry. N178 and D159 (with the exception of CHPV) are conserved among all Clade B New World arenaviruses (Fig. 1, top panel) , which use TfR1 as a receptor [1, 21] .",

Therefore, we believe this surrogate system to be valuable for initial studies of viral cell binding and entry. However, it is important that the system is simplistic and uses only a few viral proteins in the absence of other viral-encoded proteins or genomic elements. Therefore, any results obtained with this system should be verified with infectious virus.
