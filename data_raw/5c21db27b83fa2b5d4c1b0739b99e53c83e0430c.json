The course of viral infections in patients with acute bronchitis, asthma and COPD can be improved by oral application of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract; however, the mechanism is not well understood. This study investigated the in vitro effect of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract (EPs 7630) on the expression of virus binding cell membrane and host defence supporting proteins on primary human bronchial epithelial cells (hBEC). Cells were isolated from patients with severe asthma (n = 6), moderate COPD (n = 6) and non-diseased controls (n = 6). Protein expression was determined by Western-blot and immunofluorescence. Rhinovirus infection was determined by immunofluorescence as well as by polymerase chain reaction. Cell survival was determined by manual cell count after live/death immunofluorescence staining. All parameters were determined over a period of 3 days. The results show that EPs 7630 concentration-dependently and significantly increased hBEC survival after rhinovirus infection. This effect was paralleled by decreased expression of the inducible co-stimulator (ICOS), its ligand ICOSL and cell surface calreticulin (C1qR). In contrast, EPs 7630 up-regulated the expression of the host defence supporting proteins \u03b2-defensin-1 and SOCS-1, both in rhinovirus infected and un-infected hBEC. The expression of other virus interacting cell membrane proteins such as MyD88, TRL2/4 or ICAM-1 was not altered by EPs 7630. The results indicate that EPs 7630 may reduce rhinovirus infection of human primary BEC by down-regulating cell membrane docking proteins and up-regulating host defence proteins.",

Exacerbations are the main cause of disease severity and progression [1, 2] infection correlates with the seasonal frequency of exacerbations in asthma and COPD patients and it was suggested that preventive measures reducing viral infection would benefit these patients [4, 5] . EPs 7630, a proprietary aqueous-ethanolic extract from Pelargonium sidoides roots, has been shown to shorten viral infections. It is widely used in the treatment of acute airway infections and has been investigated as an add-on therapy for asthma and COPD patients. However, the mechanism of the protective effect of EPs 7630 is not completely understood. EPs 7630 significantly reduced bacterial and viral infection by immunomodulatory actions [6, 7] . In childhood asthma, a 5 day application of EPs 7630 significantly improved symptoms of a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract [8, 9] . In acute bronchitis, a 7-day course with EPs 7630 improved symptoms and significantly increased the proportion of patients able to attend kindergarten, school or work on day 7 compared to placebo [10, 11] . EPs 7630 has demonstrated antiviral effects against a broad panel of respiratory viruses [12] .",

In other lung epithelial cell types ICOS expression was linked to ICAM-1 and major histocompatibility protein-1 mediating antigen presentation [19, 20] . Concerning asthma, ICOSL stimulated airway smooth muscle cell proliferation and thus may contribute to hyperplasia in asthma [21] . In the epithelial cell membrane several proteins, summarized as collectins, are expressed and modify the immune response to infections [22] . These proteins have to form complexes, which signal through C1qR (cell surface calreticulin, ecto-calreticulin, calregulin). Interestingly, cell surface C1qR has been reported to bind enteroviruses and to induce phagocytosis, thereby increasing anti-viral cell response in other cell types than epithelial cells [23, 24] . In human bronchial epithelial cells bacterial cell extracts up-regulated C1qR expression by activation of extracellular mitogen activated protein kinases 1/2 [25] . In human immune cells, EPs 7630, reduced the expression of virus stimulated secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10, while it up-regulated IL-6 (interferon \u03b22) through p38 mitogen activated protein kinases [26] . However, a link of EPs 7630 treatment and virus binding proteins has not been investigated for rhinovirus in the context of asthma and COPD.",

Immunomodulating bacterial lysates up-regulated the expression of \u03b2-defensin-2 in the mucosa of human volunteers, but the consequence for viral infections was not determined [28] . However, the observation that \u03b2-defensin-1 was highly expressed by COPD patients, puts the potential protective role of \u03b2-defensins into question [29] , as COPD patients frequently suffer from exacerbations due to viral infection including rhinovirus [2] . In childhood asthma the use of bacterial extracts increased the expression of \u03b2-defensin which correlated with reduced exacerbation/infection rates [30] .",

In asthma, SOCS1 expression negatively correlated with RV16 or RV1 induced cytokine secretion by BEC [32] . Thus, the results of the latter study also indicate that different strains of rhinovirus may have distinct effects on this host defence mechanism. In monocytes, rhinovirus up-regulated SOCS1 expression on the mRNA level, which correlated with reduced secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as CXCL10 and IFN-\u03b1 [33] . Therefore, the role of SOCS1 in response to rhinovirus infection may be cell type specific and should be further investigated.",

RV16 infection at 48 hours is depicted as representative phase-contrast microscopy photographs in Fig 2A. Before infection or drug treatment epithelial cells showed characteristic knobble-stone phenotype (Fig A in S1 File, t = 0 ). EPs 7630 alone (Fig A in S1 File, second row) did not alter the phenotype over 72 hours, while RV16 infection significantly reduced cell numbers (Fig A in S1 File, 3 rd row, 1 st photograph) . When pre-incubated for 24 hours with EPs 7630, cell survival was increased after RV16 infection. RV16 infection was concentrationdependently reduced by EPs 7630 (Fig A in S1 File, 3 rd & 4 th row).",

In this study we observed that EPs 7630 down-regulated C1qR over three days in the same cell type. These results may be opposing, but both may lead to reduced virus infection.

Furthermore, ICOSL stimulated proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells and its inhibition may reduce airway wall remodelling in asthma [21] . Thus, the down-regulated expression of ICOS and ICOSL on hBEC by EPs 7630 may have two beneficial effects in chronic inflammatory lung diseases: (i) it reduces the ability of rhinovirus to bind to the host epithelial cell surface and prevent infection, and (ii) it reduces immune cell mediated inflammation. Which of these two effects are responsible for the clinically reported reduced viral infections by EPs 7630 has to be investigated in future studies. However, direct evidence for pro-infectious effect of ICOS and ICOSL in virus infection is missing.",

Further contribution to the beneficial effect of EPs 7630 on host defence against rhinovirus infection is the observation that \u03b2-defensin-1 and SOCS1 were up-regulated after 24 hours. These findings suggest that the host cells may be stimulated to execute intracellular killing of rhinovirus more effectively.
