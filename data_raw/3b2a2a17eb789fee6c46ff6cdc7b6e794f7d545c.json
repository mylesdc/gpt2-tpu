This cycle was then repeated with the injection shifted to each week of the evaluation year. We computed: a) the time from injection to the first statistical alarm uniquely found in the combined dataset (Detection Delay); b) how often alarms originated in the background-only dataset (false-alarm rate, or FAR); and c) the number of cases found within these false alarms (Caseload).

We found that computerized free-text analyses aimed at uncovering ARI symptoms documented in outpatient clinical notes could complement diagnostic codes and other structured data to improve case detection. In this report, we asked if those EMR-enabled gains in case-detection could accelerate the discovery of ARI outbreaks. Using software to reconstitute a surveillance system operating prospectively on historical data sets, we compared alternative casedetection approaches for their ability to reduce the delay in detecting a modeled community outbreak of influenza.

The study was granted a waiver of consent as risks were limited to information confidentiality and the work would not have otherwise been feasible, given the large number of EMR records screened for possible ARI. All EMR information was anonymized and de-identified prior to simulations and analyses, which used only daily case counts. Background: authentic counts of patients with possible ARI. Outpatients with possible ARI were identified by applying previously developed ARI case-detection algorithms (CDAs) [19] to institutional databases derived from real historical EMR entries. ARI was defined as: positive respiratory virus culture/antigen OR any two of the following symptom, of no more than 7 days duration: a) cough; b) fever or chills or night sweats; c) pleuritic chest pain; d) myalgia; e) sore throat; f) headache AND illness not attributable to a non-infectious etiology. The components and single-case detection performance of the eight (8) ARI CDAs selected for the current studies are summarized in Table 1 . CDA components included: a) provider-assigned ARI-related diagnostic codes (International Disease Classification, 9 th Revision, Clinical Modification, ICD-9) either used by the original Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ''BioSense'' surveillance system [20] (the ''CDC ICD-9 Codes'' component in Table 1 ) or a code set previously adapted to the VA (''VA ICD-9 Codes'') [19] ; b) prescription for cough suppressants (''Cough Remedies''); c) documented body temperature of $38uC; d) computerized analysis identifying at least two symptoms from the ARI case definition in the free text of the clinical note [19] . Time series of daily ARI counts were created for each CDA (those datasets are provided as Datafiles S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, and S8), and served as the backgrounds into which synthetic influenza epidemics were injected.",

To create a plausible ARI outbreak to be discovered by the surveillance system, we developed an epidemic model of influenza (Matlab R2008a, the Mathworks, Inc., Natick MA). The model included 30 contiguous ZIP codes centered on Baltimore, Maryland, and consisted of a coupled series of differential equations to describe the overall epidemic [21] . The susceptible population has the size and age structure described for Baltimore in the 2000 Census [22] . Agespecific death rates for each of the 20 demographic age-classes (age-class 1 = 0-4 years, age-class 2 = 5-9 years and so on) were derived from the United States Life Table Functions for the 1994 calendar year [23] . The birth rate for each age-class was obtained from Guyer et al. [24] . Model parameters were adjusted to mimic the estimated transmission and severity characteristics of the 1918 pandemic influenza in a non-immune population [25] . The proportion of cases that would be present for medical evaluation at the VA Maryland Health Care system was adjusted to reflect the age, gender, and population estimates of Baltimore veterans, over half of whom are older than 60 years old and more than 90% are male [26] . The same model-generated outbreak that was used as a common signal for all of our surveillance simulations is shown in Fig. 1 (upper panel, blue circles). Assuming that the synthetic epidemic cases would be discovered at the same rate as authentic cases, simulated cases from the epidemic model were first discounted by the sensitivity of the ARI CDA before being injected into CDA-specific background time series.",

Replacing the FAR by its corresponding caseload upheld the utility of adjusting the diagnostic code sets (Fig. 2 , lower panel, compare grey stars (CDA 2) to black circles (CDA 1)) and did not support the addition of structured EMR information about cough suppressants or fever (Fig. 2 , lower panel, compare red triangles (CDA 3) to black circles (CDA 2); teal diamonds (CDA 6) to blue ''x'' signs (CDA 5); and yellow boxes (CDA 8) to purple triangles (CDA 7)).

The CDAs evaluated in this study were developed against a validated manual reference standard and only included EMR data elements found to contribute to ARI detection [19] . The CDAs were implemented against authentic EMR entries and thus produced backgrounds expected to mimic the noisy surveillance conditions found in the real world. In keeping with our goal to create a realistic evaluation platform, we also used an epidemic model to simulate the cases expected to present to our particular health system during an outbreak of severe influenza. Modelgenerated cases were sporadic at first but soon attained numbers large enough to be discovered by just about any surveillance method.

Our data bolster the argument for providers to assign ICD-9 codes to summarize outpatient encounters, as it is done in VA medical centers, so that this coded information can quickly be made available for surveillance purposes. Our results further argue that diagnostic codes sets used for case-detection should routinely optimized during surveillance system development or expansion. In contrast, prescriptions for cough suppressants, the only structured EMR data found to contribute to ARI case detection aside from ICD-9 codes [19] , did not benefit outbreak detection. While these data suggest how to streamline CDAs for this particular use-case, structured EMR data other than diagnostic codes may very well prove useful in discovering diseases that typically cause abnormal vital signs or prompt predictable diagnostic or therapeutic interventions.",

            "text": "Information potentially useful to public health surveillance has long been extracted from the free text narrative of chief complaints [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , laboratory or imaging reports [37, 38, [41] [42] [43] [44] , hospital discharge summaries [45, 46] or outpatient clinical notes [19, 47, 48] . To date however, little is known about how information extracted from free text EMR fields should be combined with structured data to accelerate outbreak detection. We had previously found that text analyses aimed at abstracting ARI symptoms typed in clinical notes [49] could improve the performance of ARI CDAs [19] . Our simulations suggest that when these text analyses were combined with structured data so as to improve case-detection accuracy, timelier outbreak discovery ensued. In contrast, when text analyses were directed toward maximizing the area under the ROC for single-case detection, outbreak detection performance deteriorated despite near-perfect case-detection sensitivity. These results seem counter-intuitive until we consider that outbreak detection depends upon a statistical rendering of the size of the epidemic signal relative to that of a baseline. With sensitivities in the 69-75% range, the highspecificity CDAs did not recognize the largest possible number of epidemic cases. Yet, with PPVs in the 50% range, they disproportionately reduced the number of false-positive background cases and improved the system's signal-to-noise ratio. Our results therefore suggest that CDA performance measures that attribute equal weight to sensitivity and specificity, such as the area under the ROC curve, may not anticipate how well a CDA will discover epidemics. Because of the complex interplay between epidemic signals, background noises and statistical processes, promising CDAs should be evaluated in a whole-system context before they are incorporated into an operational surveillance system.",
