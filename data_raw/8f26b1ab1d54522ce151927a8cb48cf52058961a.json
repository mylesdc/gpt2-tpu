In the present study, we found that without any stimulation, CD4 + T cells in pleural fluid cells (PFCs) from patients with TBP expressed significantly higher levels of CD69 than PBMCs from patients with tuberculosis (TB) or healthy donors. CD4 + CD69 + T cells expressed T-bet and IL-12Rb2. After stimulation with MTB-specific antigens, CD4 + CD69 + T cells expressed significantly higher levels of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a than CD4 + CD69 2 T cells, demonstrating that CD4 + CD69 + T cells were MTB-specific Th1 cells. In addition, CD4 + CD69 + T cells were mostly polyfunctional Th1 cells that simultaneously produced IFN-c, IL-2, TNF-a and displayed an effector or effector memory phenotype (CD45RA 2 CCR7 2 CD62L 2 CD27 2 ). Moreover, the percentages of CD4 + CD69 + T cells were significantly and positively correlated with polyfunctional T cells. Interestingly, sorted CD4 + CD69 + but not CD4 + CD69 2 fractions by flow cytometry produced IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a that were significantly regulated by CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells. Taken together, based on the expression of CD69, we found a direct quantitative and qualitative method to detect and evaluate the in vivo generated MTB-specific polyfunctional CD4 + T cells in PFCs from patients with TBP. This method can be used for the potential diagnosis and enrichment or isolation of MTB-specific Th1 cells in the investigations. Citation: Li L, Qiao D, Fu X, Lao S, Zhang X, et al.

However, TBP remains difficult to identify despite numerous diagnostic tools [3] . Currently, the definite diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) pleural effusions depends on the demonstration of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum, pleural fluid, or pleural biopsy specimens [4] . Moreover, high levels of IFN-c are detected in tuberculosis pleural fluid [5, 6] . Therefore, measurement of IFN-c in the pleural fluid has also gained wide acceptance in the diagnosis of TB pleural effusions [7] . However, these assays did not provide information regarding antigen-responsive cells. An abundance of immunocompetent cells in the pleural effusion provides investigators with a good model to study the correlates of a protective immune response at the site of infection. The enrichment of Th1 cells in pleural fluid has been previously documented [8] . However, detailed phenotypic and functional characterizations for these cells are still unknown.",

Previous data have demonstrated that almost all of the CCR5 + and CCR3 + CD4 + T cells recruited to the lungs of patients with active TB express the memory T-cell phenotype and that the majority may have been recently activated [21] . CD69 is a membrane molecule transiently expressed on activated lymphocytes, and its selective expression in inflammatory infiltrates probably suggests that it plays a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases [22] . Previous studies have also demonstrated the usefulness of the determination of CD69 on CD4 + T cells after in vitro stimulation with tuberculin as a rapid indicator of immune sensitization against MTB [23, 24] .

No significant difference in CD69 expression was observed on PBMCs from PTB and from HD ( Fig 1B, P = ns) . In addition, we also demonstrated that CD4 + CD69 + T cells expressed significantly higher levels of HLA-DR than CD4 + CD69 2 T cells, a molecule which is usually induced on CD4 + T cells after activation (Fig 1C and D , P,0.001). Unexpectedly, no significant difference was observed in the expression of CD25, another activation marker, which is usually temporally expressed on activated T cells or constitutively expressed on regulatory T cells (Fig 1C and D , P = ns).",

Our initial experiments indicated that stimulation of PFCs with ESAT-6 and CFP-10 peptides resulted in increased surface CD69 expression that is difficult to elucidate (Data not shown). Short-term stimulation of these cells includes incubation with secretion inhibitory brefeldin A (BFA), which can block the transport of newly synthesized CD69 molecules to the cell surface and thus allows for the direct assessment of the relationship between in vivo CD69 expression and cytokine production. After culturing PFCs with ESAT-6/ CFP-10 peptides and BFA, we analyzed the production of Th1 cytokines by intracellular cytokine staining and polychromatic flow cytometry. As shown in Fig 3A and B , CD4 + CD69 + T cells produced greater amounts of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a than did CD4 + CD69 2 T cells. Statistical results demonstrated that the percentages of IFN-c, IL-2 or TNF-a-producing CD4 + CD69 + T cells were significantly higher than those for CD4 + CD69 2 T cells (P,0.001, Fig 3C) . In order to further confirm that the responses of T cells were specific for MTB, we also stimulated PFCs from tuberculous pleurisy patients with other irrelevant antigens such as SARS-CoV S peptides (STFFSTFKCYGVSATKL) and (NFSQILPDPLKPTK RSFI) as well as hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). We found that these irrelevant antigens could not induce the production of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a by neither CD4 + CD69 + nor CD4 + CD69 2 T cells. However, following stimulation with MTB-specific peptides of ESAT-6/CFP-10, CD4 + CD69 + T cells from the same patients expressed high levels of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a (data not shown).",

We therefore compared the expression of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a in CD4 + CD69 + , CD4 + CD69 2 and total CD4 + T cells after short-term in vitro stimulation with ESAT-6/ CFP-10 peptides. We showed that CD4 + CD69 + and CD4 + CD69 2 T cells concurrently and individually produced IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a (Fig 4A, B ). This assay also identified cells that expressed CD69 but lacked expression of any cytokine measured (as evidenced by a subset of CD4 + CD69 + IFN-c 2 IL-2 2 TNF-a 2 cells). These cells probably contained other effector functions, for example, the secretion of MIP-1b or other cytokines. The total antigen-specific responses were defined as the percentages of T cells expressing any combination of IFN-c, IL-2 or TNF-a, and thus, seven distinct functional populations could be delineated (IFN-c/IL-2/TNF-a triple expressers; IFN-c/IL-2, IFN-c/TNF-a or TNF-a/IL-2 double expressers; or IFN-c, IL-2 or TNF-a single expressers). Interestingly, polyfunctional T cells (IFN-c/IL-2/ TNF-a triple expressers) dominated the CD4 + CD69 + T cell response. However, frequencies of T cells producing only TNF-a were the highest when analyzing the distribution of the seven subsets within either the CD4 + CD69 2 population or all CD4 + T cells (Fig 4C, D) . The percentages of double expressers were similar within CD4 + CD69 + , CD4 + CD69 2 and total CD4 + T cells. Our results demonstrated that total MTB-specific CD4 + T cells were not dominated by polyfunctional T cells. However, polyfunctional T cells were primarily enriched within CD4 + CD69 + T cells. We further analyzed the correlation between the percentages of CD69-expressing CD4 + T cells and polyfunctional T cells. Interestingly, significant positive correlation between CD4 + CD69 + T cells and polyfunctional T cells was observed ( Fig 4E, CD4 + CD69 + T cells were mostly effector memory T cells We next investigated the phenotype of CD4 + CD69 + T cells relating to na\u00efve/memory markers. As shown in Fig 5A, CD4 + CD69 + T cells were predominantly CD45RO + CD45RA 2 , thereby exhibiting a memory cell phenotype. In contrast, CD4 + CD69 2 T cells contained significantly higher percentages of CD45RA + and lower percentages of CD45RO + cells than did CD4 + CD69 + T cells. Moreover, we also examined the expression of CD127 and CD27 and found that CD4 + CD69 + T cells had significantly lower expression of both markers ( Fig 5B) . To further validate whether MTB-specific CD4 + CD69 + T cells were memory cells, we tested the phenotype of IFN-c-secreting CD4 + CD69 + T cells by assessing typical memory T cell markers. As expected, the majority of CD4 + CD69 + IFN-c + T cells displayed a CD45RA 2 CCR7 2 CD62L 2 CD27 2 effector memory cell phenotype (Fig 5C) , suggesting that these cells were capable of producing multiple cytokines quickly at local sites.

We then cocultured CD4 + CD69 + or CD4 + CD69 2 T cells with CD14 + cells (as antigen-presenting cells) in the presence of ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides (P1-P6) and measured the production of Th1 cytokines. Notably, considerable levels of IFN-c and IL-2 were produced by CD4 + CD69 + T cells, whereas little was observed from the CD4 + CD69 2 fractions. However, TNF-a production was readily detected in unstimulated cells, and significantly higher TNF-a was measured following stimulation of the CD4 + CD69 + fractions ( Fig 6B) . Moreover, significantly higher levels of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a were produced by CD4 + CD69 + cells than by CD4 + CD69 2 T cells (P,0.001, Fig 6B) .

CD4 + T cell responses are commonly determined by the expression of various cytokines, such as IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a for Th1 cells, after short-term stimulation with specific antigens. The development of IFN-c release assays (IGRAs) has emerged as an attractive alternative to the tuberculin skin test for detection of latent TB infections and might also contribute to assisting in the diagnosis of TBP [31] . IGRAs are based on the principle that T cells of individuals sensitized with TB antigens produce IFN-c when they re-encounter highly MTB-specific antigens such as ESAT-6 and CFP-10. However, this assay precludes further analysis because it is lethal to cells. Moreover, the IGRAs are not recommended on either the blood or the pleural fluid for the diagnosis of TBP [31] .",

(C, D) After stimulation for 8 hours, CD4 + T cells were gated and the expression of Th1 cytokines by CD4 + CD69 + and CD4 + CD69 2 cells was analyzed.

We noted that stimulation of PFCs resulted in increased surface CD69 expression. We overcame this limitation by incubation with BFA during short-term stimulation. Using this method, we were able to directly assess the relationship between in vivo CD69 expression and cytokine production. Using polychromatic flow cytometry, we demonstrated for the first time that the majority of MTB specific Th1 cytokine-producing cells were enriched within the CD4 + CD69 + subset, whereas CD4 + CD69 2 cells scarcely produced cytokines. In addition, PFCs from tuberculous pleurisy patients were stimulated with SARS-CoV S peptides (STFFSTFKCYGVSATKL) and (NFSQILPDPLKPTKRSFI) as well as hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). These irrelevant antigens could not induce the production of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNFa by neither CD4 + CD69 + nor CD4 + CD69 2 T cells. However, following stimulation with MTB-specific peptides of ESAT-6/ CFP-10, CD4 + CD69 + T cells from the same patients with tuberculous pleurisy expressed high levels of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a, indicating that the response was MTB-specific. Most importantly, the detection of CD69 is useful for the direct identification of MTB-specific Th1 cells in vivo without further stimulation.",

In the present study, analysis of total CD4 + Th1 subpopulations indicated that the majority of Th1 cells produced only one cytokine. However, polyfunctional CD4 + T cells simultaneously producing IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a dominated the CD4 + CD69 + T cell population, but the percentage of TNF-a single expressers was higher in both the CD4 + CD69 2 and the total CD4 + T cell subsets compared with CD4 + CD69 2 cells. Our results indicated that detection or isolation of CD69 + T cells is a good method for the identification or enrichment of polyfunctional T cells. Interestingly, significant positive correlation was observed between the percentages of CD69-expressing CD4 + T cells and polyfunctional T cells. Our results demonstrated for the first time that the expression of CD69 may be a useful marker for the definition of MTB-specific polyfunctional T cells in vivo. A number of studies in humans suggested that polyfunctional T cells may indeed be involved in mediating protection in TB [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . However, it has also been indicated in the recent studies that polyfunctional CD4 + T cells may be a useful biomarker of active TB and that polyfunctional responses are not associated with protection against TB [40] . In the present study, we hypothesized that the highly increased frequencies of CD69-expressing CD4 + T cells (polyfunctional T cells) in pleural fluid may be associated with protection against TB and thus lead to the self-resolution tendency of TBP.",

In our study, however, CD4 + CD69 + T cells represented effector or effector memory cells and quickly produced large amounts of cytokines following short-term stimulation. Moreover, we also assessed other markers (Foxp3 and CTLA-4) essential for the suppressive function of regulatory T cells and found that these molecules were not differentially expressed by CD4 + CD69 + and CD4 + CD69 2 T cells, further confirming that CD4 + CD69 + T cells were not regulatory T cells (data not shown).

For the detection of T-bet, surface markers were first stained and cells were then fixed in 2% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 90% methanol and labeled with anti T-bet mAb. The expression of IL-12Rb2 was detected by indirect immunofluorescence analysis. Briefly, cells were incubated with mAb for IL-12Rb2, followed by biotin-SP-conjugated anti-rat IgG F(ab') 2 fragments, and were finally incubated with streptavidin-PE. All incubations were performed at 4uC and cells were washed twice between incubations. Flow cytometry was performed using BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) or FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar, San Carlos, CA).",
