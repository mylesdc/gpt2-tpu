Women infected during their second and third trimesters are at increased risk for severe cardiopulmonary complications, premature delivery, and death. Here, we establish a murine model of aerosolized influenza infection during pregnancy. We find significantly altered innate antiviral responses in pregnant mice, including decreased levels of IFN-b, IL-1a, and IFN-c at early time points of infection. We also find reduced cytotoxic T cell activity and delayed viral clearance. We further demonstrate that pregnancy levels of the estrogen 17-b-estradiol are able to induce key anti-inflammatory phenotypes in immune responses to the virus independently of other hormones or pregnancy-related stressors. We conclude that elevated estrogen levels result in an attenuated anti-viral immune response, and that pregnancy-associated morbidities occur in the context of this antiinflammatory phenotype.",

Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain how rejection of an antigenically foreign fetus is prevented, from the absence of classical MHC class I molecules [2] , to regulatory T cell expansion [3] and specific suppression of paternally-derived antigens [4, 5] . Pregnancy is also associated with reduced pathology and alleviation of symptoms in inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis [6] and rheumatoid arthritis [7] . The profound immunological changes in these disease states during pregnancy suggests that there exists a broad impact on immune regulation that is not specific to fetal antigens.",

Of these, the increased risk of severe influenza infection is of particular public health concern. Pregnancy has been an acknowledged risk factor for severe complications from influenza virus infection for nearly a century [15] , and has been observed during every major influenza pandemic including the pandemics of 1918 [15] , 1957 [16] , 1968 [17] , and 2009 [18] [19] [20] . Implications of a severe influenza infection during pregnancy are life threatening for mother and child. Significantly increased risks of cardiopulmonary events have been reported [14] , and mortality for the mother can be as high as 45% [21] . Moreover, consequences to the fetus range from behavioral alterations and low birthweight, to preterm birth and spontaneous abortion [21] [22] [23] [24] . Significant effort has been put into determining the safety and efficacy of vaccination during pregnancy [25, 26] , as well as the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors [20, 27] , but a deeper understanding of the changes in maternal immunity during pregnancy are needed in order to devise adequate therapeutic strategies.",

Moreover, using implantable hormone pellets, we have determined that estrogen alone is able to recapitulate many key alterations observed in pregnancy. Estrogen treatment leads to early reductions in cytokine production, in particular type-I interferon (IFN), impacting downstream activation of adaptive immunity. Additionally, estrogen treatment compromises effective antigen-specific cytotoxicity. Ultimately these deficiencies result in significantly delayed viral clearance in pregnant animals, highlighting the presence of an anti-inflammatory mechanism in the context of enhanced morbidity.",

This weight loss was delayed by approximately 2 days when compared to the weight loss of non-pregnant controls, suggesting that immuneassociated morbidities were delayed in pregnant animals ( Figure 1B ). Significant morbidity was readily evident in measures of gestational health. The number of fetuses per mother were not effected by infection in our model ( Figure 1C ), but fetuses from influenza-infected mice failed to achieve the weight of their counterparts from mock-infected mothers. By E18.5 they were nearly 35% below the weight of controls ( Figure 1D ). The length of gestation was also significantly impacted by infection with influenza virus. Infected pregnant mice undergo labor much earlier than their mock-infected controls ( Figure 1E ). All mock infected pregnant mice continued gestation beyond the bounds of our experiments, while infected mice universally delivered by E19. Pups delivered by influenza-infected mothers were therefore not only premature, but additionally underweight for their gestational age. These results reinforce the evidence that the viability of the pregnancy is negatively impacted by infection with influenza virus, with a significant burden borne by the fetus, as is seen in clinical situations [23, 37] .",

In this assay, animals are infected with PN-1, an influenza virus bearing the model antigen SIINFEKL. Cytotoxic T cells are endogenously generated towards this peptide during infection. At 8dpi, two populations of target splenocytes are adoptively transferred. Each differentially labeled with a fluorescent dye and incubated with either SIINFEKL or an irrelevant peptide. Specific lysis of the antigen-bearing population is then calculated by comparing the relative proportion of the two target populations 16-18h after adoptive transfer ( Figure 6A ). We observed significant reductions in antigen-specific cytotoxicity in both pregnant ( Figure 6B ) and estrogen-treated ( Figure 6C ) animals. These differences represent delays in the ability of pregnant and E2-treated mice to clear antigen specific targets.",

Indeed, we saw a strong trend towards elevated levels of the chemokine KC in the steady state of pregnancy, followed by significant deficit in KC expression upon infection. This complex regulation highlights the elaborate mechanisms involved in estrogen signaling [62] . Pregnancy presents additional layers of complexity in cytokine regulation. Several hormones circulating in pregnancy are immunologically active, including progesterone and prolactin [39, 63] . We did not observe identical regulation of all cytokines in pregnancy and estrogen-treatment, and some of these other hormones may account for some of this variation.

The ability of estrogen to suppress cytokine expression has been proposed as protective in influenza virus pathogenesis [48] . Indeed, it may be that estrogen plays a protective role during pregnancy by muting early cytokine responses that would otherwise threaten fetal development [22, 54] . Enhanced morbidities experienced during pregnancy may rely on the failure to clear virus following an impaired immune response. Prolonged infection may result in a late cytokine response triggering premature delivery and significant morbidity. Delayed weight loss in pregnant animals supports the hypothesis of a late development inducing pathology. Alternatively, prolonged infection may lead to significant lung damage. Others have reported that delayed lung repair during pregnancy leads significant cardiopulmonary demands during pregnancy, and may contribute to morbidity [31] .",

We did not find any evidence that estrogen treatment interfered with downstream signaling pathways, suggesting that this effect is mediated by reduced type-I interferon expression. ISG levels were reduced not only in the lung, but additionally in the periphery. This is an important observation, as interferon signaling in the periphery is necessary for efficient antiviral immunity [42] .

Cytotoxicity was decreased in an in vivo cytotoxicity assay, and granzyme B levels were strongly reduced in the lungs of infected mice. Interestingly, IFN-c expression in CD8 T cells was unchanged, suggesting that these cells that reach the lung were at least partially activated, even while functionally compromised. A single dose of estrogen administered immediately prior to encountering target cells was sufficient to impair cytotoxic function, suggesting that this effect is not entirely mediated by inefficient dendritic cell stimulation. Estrogen signaling pathways have been associated with lysosome biogenesis in cytotoxic T cells, and may represent a relevant mechanism [69] .",

The first involves delayed proliferation in the draining lymph nodes and can account for delayed migration to the lung. This mechanism is likely the product of weak early interferon signaling events and impaired antigen presentation. Those cells that do proliferate and are activated are additionally functionally compromised. This second mechanism is independent of antigen presentation and is at least partially responsible for a deficiencies in cytotoxic function. This mechanism has a rapid onset and can be observed within hours of estrogen treatment. This mechanism likely accounts for the observed decreases in granzyme B production that do not effect IFN-c levels in the same T cells.",

            "text": "Although pregnancy is a complex immunological state, it is clear that estrogen plays a key role. Initially, estrogen reduces early cytokine responses and may function to protect from cytokineassociated morbidities. Early recruitment of leukocytes is equivalent and early viral titers are controlled equally well in pregnant and wild type mice. The key deficit appears to be in priming of dendritic cells that migrate from the lungs to lymph nodes to initiate T cell expansion. This disruption in interferon signaling leads to suboptimal CD8 T cell activation and delayed viral clearance. Estrogen also appears to impair CD8 T cell cytotoxicity independently of dendritic cell activity. It is not currently clear how these anti-inflammatory effects impact the viability of pregnancy, particularly fetal development and premature delivery, but evidence suggests it may play a protective role. Deficits in viral clearance and prolonged exposure to infection may be act as stressors that trigger delayed morbidities despite the anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen. It is also not clear whether prolonged infection is of significant impact on morbidity absent pregnancy, as would be the case in hormone treatment. These are key questions that require further study and the establishment of novel models.",

Animal models, such as those described in this report, allow for controlled infection conditions and detailed observation of early events during infection. Understanding the mechanisms and immunological outcomes of pregnancy, particularly the role of steroid hormones, may lead to the development of therapeutic options for protection of women, their children, and patients receiving hormone replacement therapy. Establishing the tenets of hormone mediated immune modulation may provide testable hypotheses for treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Mice C57BL/6 wild type, transgenic OT-I and syngeneic pregnant mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, MA). Timed pregnant mice were delivered at E8.5 and allowed two days to rest before commencing the experiment. Nonpregnant mice were age matched to timed pregnant mice. Wildtype mice were implanted with placebo or estrogen pellets purchased from Innovative Research of America. Estrogen pellets contained 35mg of 17-b-estradiol and were designed for 21-day release. Surgery was performed 4-5 days prior to infection. Mice were anesthetized with Avertin (Tribromoethanol, Acros Organics) and shaved behind the right ear. The pellet was implanted via small incision between the shoulder and ear and secured with a surgical clip. Mice were monitored for signs of infection. For experiments using a single dose of estradiol, mice received a single 100mg subcutaneous injection of water soluble 17-b-estradiol (Sigma) six hours prior to receiving target cells for in vivo cytotoxicity assay. The animals were housed in specific pathogenfree conditions.",
