Infections by human-pathogenic coronaviruses result in diverse clinical outcomes, ranging from self-limiting flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia with extrapulmonary manifestations. Understanding how cellular lipids may modulate the pathogenicity of human-pathogenic coronaviruses remains poor. To this end, we utilized the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) as a model coronavirus to comprehensively characterize the host cell lipid response upon coronavirus infection with an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS)-based lipidomics approach. Our results revealed that glycerophospholipids and fatty acids (FAs) were significantly elevated in the HCoV-229E-infected cells and the linoleic acid (LA) to arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism axis was markedly perturbed upon HCoV-229E infection. Interestingly, exogenous supplement of LA or AA in HCoV-229E-infected cells significantly suppressed HCoV-229E virus replication. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of LA and AA on virus replication was also conserved for the highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Taken together, our study demonstrated that host lipid metabolic remodeling was significantly associated with human-pathogenic coronavirus propagation. Our data further suggested that lipid metabolism regulation would be a common and druggable target for coronavirus infections.",

Coronaviruses confiscate intracellular membranes of the host cells to generate new compartments known as double membrane vesicles (DMVs) for the amplification of the viral genome. DMVs are membranous structures that not only harbor viral proteins but also contain a specific array of hijacked host factors, which collectively orchestrate a unique lipid micro-environment optimal for coronavirus replication [15] . A recent study indicated that a key lipid processing enzyme, cytosolic phospholipase A2\u03b1 enzyme (cPLA2\u03b1) that belongs to the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) superfamily, was closely associated with DMVs' formation and coronaviruses' replication [16] . The viral protein and RNA accumulation, as well as the production of infectious virus progeny, were significantly diminished in the presence of cPLA2\u03b1 inhibitor [16] . At the same time, phospholipase A2 group IID (PLA2G2D), an enzyme that predominantly contributes to anti-inflammatory/pro-resolving lipid mediator expression, contributed to worsened outcomes in mice infected with SARS-CoV by modulating the immune response [17] . However, to date, the change and modulating effects of the specific lipids involved in lipid rearrangement upon coronavirus infection remains largely unexplored.",

Specific lipids including glycerophospholipids and fatty acids (FAs) upon virus infection were identified, which represented the lipid species that were rearranged by HCoV-229E infection. Further pathway analysis revealed that the linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism axis was the most perturbed pathway upon HCoV-229E infection. Importantly, supplement of additional LA and AA to coronavirus-infected cells significantly inhibited virus replication of both HCoV-229E and the highly virulent MERS-CoV, suggesting that the LA-AA metabolism axis is a common and essential pathway that could modulate coronavirus replication.

These ion features were significantly discriminative between HCoV-229E-infected and mock-infected cells. To observe the discrimination trend in more detail, a hierarchical clustering analysis was performed based on the degree of similarity of lipid abundance profiles to show the overview trend of all significant ion features. As indicated in Figure 1 , most of the significant features from both negative mode ( Figure 1A ) and positive mode ( Figure 1B ) expressed an up-regulation trend after HCoV-229E infection compared with the mock infection controls. Furthermore, to identify lipids specific to HCoV-229E infection, these significant features were grouped and annotated using the CAMERA software, and the potential precursor ions were used to perform further MS/MS experiments for obtaining their fragmentation patterns. Finally, a total of 24 lipids were identified, which could be classified into three lipid classes, including lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysoPE) and fatty acid (FA). The chromatogram peak heights of these identified lipids were generated by LC-MS raw data and the ratio between infected and mock-infected cells was determined. As demonstrated in Figure 2 , we found a consistent up-regulation trend of the identified lipids in HCoV-229E-infected cells. In particular, lysoPC was the predominant lipid class of all identified, accounting for approximately 60% of all identified lipids with significant elevation (Figure 2A ). At the same time, arachidonic acid (AA), which belongs to the FA class, showed the highest increase in fold-change among all identified lipids with a maximum of 7.1-fold increase ( Figure 2B ). In addition, the level of lysoPEs ( Figure 2C ) was also up-regulated with a maximum fold change of 2.93, which was comparatively less than that of the lysoPCs and FAs. The identities of lysoPC (16:0/0:0), platelet-activating factor C-16 (PAF C-16), lysoPE (16:0/0:0), AA, LA, PA and OA were confirmed by matching the retention time (RT) and MS/MS fragmentation patterns of the authentic chemical standards that distinguish between HCoV-229E-infected cases and non-infected controls ( Figure 3 ).

In addition, lysoPC was a potent inhibitor and could reversely arrest pore expansion during syncytium formation mediated by diverse viral fusogens [40] . Another lysophospholipid, lysoPE, is present at low concentrations in vivo but they induce various cellular responses such as activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and neuronal differentiation when applied to cells in vitro [41] . Among the identified FAs, the LA and AA both belong to polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid and are essential fatty acids.

However, when we evaluate this hypothesis by exogenously supplementing additional LA and AA to HCoV-229E-or MERS-CoV-infected cells, we noticed a significant reduction in virus replication. Taken together, our data suggested that coronavirus infection did not randomly perturb the cellular lipid compositions. Instead, we speculate that coronaviruses precisely modulate and rearrange the host lipid profile to reach an intricate homeostasis optimized for its replication. Any exogenous manipulation that disrupts the equilibrium may interfere with the optimal replication of the viruses. Alternatively, supplementing LA and AA might disturb the LA-AA metabolism axis and result in feedback reversion of lysophospholipids into phospholipids through Land's cycle [44] , thus limiting virus replication.",
