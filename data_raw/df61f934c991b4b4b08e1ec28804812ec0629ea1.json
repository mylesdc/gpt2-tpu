            "text": "HepG2.2.15 cells by activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway X Zhu 1,2,3,5 , C Xie 1,2,3,5 , Y-m Li 4 , Z-l Huang 1,2,3 , Q-y Zhao 1,2,3 , Z-x Hu 1,2,3 , P-p Wang 1,2,3 , Y-r Gu 1,2,3 , Z-l Gao* ,1,2,3,5 and L Peng* ,1,2,3, 5 We have previously observed the downregulation of TMEM2 in the liver tissue of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and in HepG2.2.15 cells with HBV genomic DNA. In the present study, we investigated the role and mechanism of TMEM2 in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 during HBV infection HepG2 and HepG2.2.15. HepG2 shTMEM2 cells with stable TMEM2 knockdown and HepG2 TMEM2 and HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells with stable TMEM2 overexpression were established using lentivirus vectors. We observed reduced expression of TMEM2 in HBV-infected liver tissues and HepG2.2.15 cells. HBsAg, HBcAg, HBV DNA, and HBV cccDNA levels were significantly increased in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells but decreased in HepG2 TMEM2 and HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells compared with naive HepG2 cells. On the basis of the western blotting results, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway was inhibited in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells but activated in HepG2 TMEM2 and HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells. In addition, reduced and increased expression of the antiviral proteins MxA and OAS1 was observed in TMEM2-silenced cells (HepG2 shTMEM2 cells) and TMEM2-overexpressing cells (HepG2 TMEM2 and HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells), respectively. The expression of Interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) was not affected by TMEM2. However, we found that overexpression and knockdown of TMEM2, respectively, promoted and inhibited importation of IRF9 into nuclei. The luciferase reporter assay showed that IRF9 nuclear translocation affected interferon-stimulated response element activities. In addition, the inhibitory effects of TMEM2 on HBV infection in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells was significantly enhanced by pre-treatment with interferon but significantly inhibited in HepG2. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global public health challenge. It has been estimated that two billion people worldwide are infected with HBV 1 and that~350 million people have chronic HBV infection, which is associated with cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Up to one million deaths annually are caused by HBV-related diseases. 2 However, the mechanism by which HBV infects HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells is not fully understood. Our previous study investigating susceptibility to HBV revealed significant differences in the expression of the p.Ser1254Asn gene between healthy individuals and patients with HBV infection. Expression of the transmembrane protein TMEM2 encoded by p.Ser1254Asn in normal liver tissues and HepG2 cells was significantly higher than that in liver tissues of patients with chronic HBV infection and in HepG2.2.15 cells with HBV genomic DNA, respectively, 3 suggesting that TMEM2 has an important role in inhibiting HBV infection in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. TMEM2 belongs to the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein superfamily. The biological functions of TMEM2 remain largely unknown. It has been reported that other members of the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein superfamily exhibit interferon-mediated antiviral functions. 4, 5 The JAK-STAT signaling pathway regulates cell growth, survival, and differentiation, and is involved in pathogen resistance. Interestingly, Li et al. 6 reported that inhibition of STAT1 methylation led to the resistance of HBV to interferon alpha treatments. On the basis of previous findings, we hypothesized that the JAK-STAT signaling pathway is involved in the anti-HBV activity of TMEM2. In the present study, we investigated the interactions between TMEM2 and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway during HBV infection in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. First, we performed gain-and loss-of-function assays in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells by stable TMEM2 overexpression or silencing. Second, the expression of a number of key components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway was evaluated, and the effects of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway on TMEM2-mediated anti-HBV activities were investigated.",

IHC demonstrated strong expression of TMEM2 in the cytoplasm in normal liver tissue and significantly reduced expression of TMEM2 in liver tissues from patients with chronic HBV infection (Figure 1a) . The western blot analysis also showed a significant reduction of TMEM2 expression in liver tissues from patients with chronic HBV infection and HepG2.2.15 cells with HBV genomic DNA compared with normal liver tissues and HepG2 cells without HBV genomic DNA, respectively (Figure 1b ). In addition, the mRNA level of TMEM2 in liver tissues from patients with chronic HBV infection and HepG2.2.15 cells with HBV genomic DNA was significantly lower than that in normal liver tissues and HepG2 cells without HBV genomic DNA, respectively (Figure 1c ; *Po0.05, **Po0.01). Effects of TMEM2 on the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in HBV-infected HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effects of TMEM2 on HBV infection in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells, western blot was used to evaluate the expression of a number of key components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in HBV-infected HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. We found that the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in all HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells were reduced by HBV infection. No significant difference in the expression of Tyk2, JAK1, STAT1, and STAT2 was detected among any of the HBV-infected cells (Figure 4a ). After HBV infection, the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells were lower than those in HepG2 cells, and the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in HepG2 TMEM2 cells were higher than those in HepG2 cells ( Figure 4a ). In addition, the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells were higher than those in HepG2.2.15 cells following HBV infection ( Figure 4a ). After TMEM2 overexpression or knockdown, there were no significant differences in the cellular level of total interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells (Figure 4a ).",

We found that HBV infection significantly reduced the expression of MxA in all cells ( Figure 4b ). However, in the two groups of cells without HBV infection, the expression of MxA in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells was significantly lower than that in HepG2 cells (Figure 4b , *Po0.01). The expression of MxA in HepG2 TMEM2 cells was significantly higher than that in HepG2 cells (Figures 4b, Po0 .01). In addition, overexpression of TMEM2 increased MxA expression in HepG2.2.15 cells irrespective of the presence of HBV infection. A similar expression profile was also obtained for OAS1. HBV infection significantly reduced the expression of OAS1 in HepG2 and HepG2 TMEM2 cells (Figure 4b ). The expression of OAS1 in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells was significantly lower than that in HepG2 cells (Figure 4b, Po0 .01).

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that multiple signaling pathways, such as NF-\u03baB, Smad7-TGF-\u03b2, REB/PKA, and JAK-STAT, are involved in the pathogenesis of HBV infection. 6,10-12 Among these signaling pathways, the JAK-STAT pathway is involved in the anti-HBV activity of IFN. In addition, HBV and HBV antigens can regulate the expression of JAK-STAT signaling pathway molecules and antiviral proteins in hepatocellular models in vitro. Furthermore, the reduced STAT1 methylation and subsequent increased STAT1-PIAS1 interaction contributed to the antagonistic activity of IFN-alpha against HBV. 6 Therefore, we examined whether the JAK-STAT signaling pathway was involved in the inhibitory effect of TMEM2 on HBV infection. First, we investigated whether TMEM2 could regulate the expression of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Our results showed that TMEM2 overexpression activated the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and TMEM2 knockdown decreased the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells, suggesting that TMEM2 regulates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This finding was further supported by the expression levels of MxA and OAS1, two downstream molecules in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. IFN has been shown to activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. We observed that IFN treatment increased the expression of MxA and OAS1 in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells, and this effect was compromised by reduced TMEM2 expression, leading to attenuated inhibitory effects of IFN on HBV production. Furthermore, we explored whether blocking the JAK-STAT signaling pathway could abolish the anti-HBV effects of TMEM2. Our data revealed that pre-treatment with JAK1 inhibitor resulted in elevated levels of HBsAg, HBcAg, HBV DNA, and HBV cccDNA in TMEM2-overexpressing HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 8 , TMEM2 caused an increase in the translocation of IRF9 into nuclei, but no effect on IRF9 expression was detected. The increased levels of nuclear IRF9 enhanced the expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of ISRE motifs. Given that TMEM2 increased the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, and promoted the translocation of IRF9 into nuclei, it would be interesting to determine whether TMEM2 is involved in the formation of the ISGF3 complex, a key player in type 1 interferon signaling. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are a family of transcription factors that mediate the transcriptional regulation of interferon genes and IFN-inducible genes. 13 IRF9 is an immunomodulatory transcription factor that is important for the response to IFN-\u03b1 downstream of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. 14, 15 Taken together, our results suggest that TMEM2 inhibits HBV infection in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 by activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.",

            "text": "Current studies investigating HBV receptors have mainly focused on the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), which is the receptor of both HBV and HDV. [18] [19] [20] [21] The interaction between the HBV preS1 domain and NTCP mediates the entry of HBV into cells. Our previous in vivo TMEM2 inhibits HBV infection X Zhu et al study confirmed that NTCP is the receptor of HBV and demonstrated that the NTCP mutation (p.Ser267Phe) was associated with a reduced prevalence of acute and chronic liver failure. 22 In particular, we identified five cases of the p. Ser267Phe homozygous mutation among 1899 patients with chronic HBV infection. Given that five homozygous patients were infected with HBV, we speculate that there is more than one route of HBV cellular entry. Characterization of the biological functions of TMEM2 is useful to understand the mechanism of HBV infection. It is not clear whether TMEM2 is a HBV receptor involved in HBV infection through the G8 and GG domains. In addition, the role of TMEM2 in HBV infection should be investigated in vivo. Whether the structure of TMEM2 is altered during HBV infection and whether TMEM2 interacts with NTCP should be investigated in future investigations. 23 Liver tissues were obtained by liver biopsy. Healthy and CHB liver tissues were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and sectioned for immunohistochemistry assays, or immediately frozen for western blot and RT-qPCR assays. Establishment of stable TMEM2-overexpressing or silenced cell lines. Establishment of stable TMEM2-overexpressing or silenced cell lines was performed according to a previous study with slight modifications. 24 To obtain lentiviral expression of TMEM2, TMEM2 cDNA with an in-frame stop codon was amplified by PCR and inserted into vector LV-003 with the CMV promoter (Forevergen Biosciences, Guangzhou, China). Vector LV-008 (Forevergen Biosciences, Guangzhou, China) with the U6 promoter was used to generate small hairpin RNAs. The following oligonucleotides were sub-cloned into the HpaI/XhoI sites: the small hairpin RNA of TMEM2 (shTMEM2) and the TMEM2 shRNA sequences: sense 5\u2032-CACCGCTTGCCCTTTGGGTCCTATACGAATATAGGACCCAA AGGGCAAGC-3\u2032; and antisense 5\u2032-AAAAGCTTGCCCTTTGGGTCCTATATTCGTAT AGGACCCAAAGGGCAAGC-3\u2032. Lentiviral production was performed as previously described. 8 Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with LV-003-TMEM2 (or LV-008-shTMEM2) and packaging vectors, and the supernatant was collected after 48 and 72 h of incubation. Lentiviruses were recovered after centrifugation at 25 000 r.p.m. for 1.5 h in a Beckman Instrument (Fullerton, CA, USA) and resuspended in PBS. The virus was then used to infect cells in the presence of polybrene (6 mg/ml). After 48 h, the cells were cultured in medium containing puromycin (2 \u03bcg/ml) for 10-15 days to generate stable cell lines. Stable TMEM2overexpressing or silenced cell lines were confirmed by western blot, RT-qPCR and the MTT assay.",

Similar results were observed in HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells. Whereas no significant decrease in the expression of IRF9 was observed in TMEM2 cells compared with the control cells based on IFA, a lower level of luciferase activity was observed in shTMEM2 cells(Figures 5a and b).IFN promoted the inhibitory effects of TMEM2 on HBV infection. To confirm the effects of TMEM2 on the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, HepG2 and HepG2 shTMEM2 cells were infected with HBV after pre-treatment with interferon (IFN), and the expression of a number of key components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway was evaluated by western blot and RT-qPCR analyses. The western blot results demonstrated that the levels of p-JAK1 and p-STAT1 were significantly increased in HepG2 and HepG2 shTMEM2 cells in response to IFN pre-treatment(Figure 6a). The RT-qPCR assay results showed that IFN pretreatment significantly increased the expression of MxA and OAS1 in HepG2 and HepG2 shTMEM2 cells(Figure 6b, Po0.01). However, the levels of MxA and OAS1 in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells were significantly lower than those in HepG2 cells(Figure 6b, Po0.01).

Similar results were observed in HepG2.2.15 cells, which overexpressed TMEM2; nuclear translocation is represented by column shown on the right side ofFigure 5a.(b) Using a plasmid that expresses a reporter gene (firefly luciferase) under the control of a promoter containing ISRE motifs, we showed that transfection of this plasmid into HepG2 TMEM2 cells, either with HBV infection or without, significantly increased luciferase activity compared with HepG2 GFP and HepG2 shTMEM2 cells (*Po0.05 compared with HepG2 GFP cells without HBV infection; # Po0.05 compared with HepG2 GFP cells with HBV infection). Similar results were observed in TMEM2-overexpressing HepG2.2.15 cells ( $ Po0.05 compared with HepG2.2.15 GFP cells without HBV infection,^Po0.05 compared with HepG2.2.15 GFP cells with HBV infection). When TMEM2 was silenced in HepG2 cells, the luciferase activity was markedly reduced. Error bars are presented as S.D.

Lentiviral vectors were used to establish stable TMEM2-overexpressing (HepG2 TMEM2 and HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells) or silenced (HepG2 shTMEM2 cells) cell lines (Figure 2a). Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results demonstrated significantly increased expression of TMEM2 in HepG2 TMEM2 and HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells compared with HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells (Po0.01), respectively, and significantly reduced expression of TMEM2 in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells compared with HepG2 cells (Figures 2b and c; Po0.05). The effect of TMEM2 silencing or overexpression on the kinetics of cell growth/cell death was determined using the MTT assay, as shown in Figure 2d. Overexpression of TMEM2 promoted a slight increase in the proliferation of HepG2 and HepG2.2.15, whereas TMEM2 silencing slightly repressed the proliferation of HepG2 cells. TMEM2 inhibited HBV infection in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells were cultured in L-DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) medium containing 10% serum from patients with chronic HBV infection for 48 h.
