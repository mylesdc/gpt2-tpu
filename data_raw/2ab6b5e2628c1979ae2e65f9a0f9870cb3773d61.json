            "text": "Background: A broad spectrum of pathogens is causative for respiratory tract infections, but symptoms are mostly similar. Therefore, the identification of the causative viruses and bacteria is only feasible using multiplex PCR or several monoplex PCR tests in parallel. Methods: The analytical sensitivity of three multiplex PCR assays, RespiFinder-19, RespiFinder-SMART-22 and xTAG-Respiratory-Virus-Panel-Fast-Assay (RVP), were compared to monoplex real-time PCR with quantified standardized control material. All assays include the most common respiratory pathogens. Results: To compare the analytical sensitivity of the multiplex assays, samples were inoculated with 13 different quantified viruses in the range of 10 1 to 10 5 copies/ml. Concordant results were received for rhinovirus, whereas the RVP detected influenzavirus, RSV and hMPV more frequently in low concentrations. The RespiFinder-19 and the RespiFinder-SMART-22 showed a higher analytical sensitivity for adenoviruses and coronaviruses, whereas the RVP was incapable to detect adenovirus and coronavirus in concentrations of 10 4 copies/ml. The RespiFinder-19 and RespiFinder-SMART-22A did not detect influenzaviruses (10 4 copies/ml) and RSV (10 3 copies/ml). The detection of all 13 viruses in one sample was only achieved using monoplex PCR. To analyze possible competitive amplification reactions between the different viruses, samples were further inoculated with only 4 different viruses in one sample. Compared to the detection of 13 viruses in parallel, only a few differences were found. The incidence of respiratory viruses was compared in tracheal secretion (TS) samples (n = 100) of mechanically ventilated patients in winter (n = 50) and summer (n = 50). In winter, respiratory viruses were detected in 32 TS samples (64%) by RespiFinder-19, whereas the detection rate with RVP was only 22%. The most frequent viruses were adenovirus (32%) and PIV-2 (20%). Multiple infections were detected in 16 TS samples (32%) by RespiFinder-19. Fewer infections were found in summer (RespiFinder-19: 20%; RVP: 6%). All positive results were verified using monoplex PCR. Conclusions: Multiplex PCR tests have a broad spectrum of pathogens to test at a time. Analysis of multiple inoculated samples revealed a different focus of the detected virus types by the three assays. Analysis of clinical samples showed a high concordance of detected viruses by the RespiFinder-19 compared to monoplex tests.",

A high rate of respiratory tract infections is caused by viruses (approximately 80%) [1, 2] . Within the last ten years, diagnosis of respiratory viruses has become more important, because of the unexpected emer- However, an efficient pathogen-based prophylaxis or therapy has a significant effect on the disease progress in patients [7, 8] . To overcome limitations concerning the use of several monoplex tests in parallel and the resulting shortage of sample volume, the development of multiplex tests for a fast and exact identification is necessary. Today, several multiplex tests are commercially available [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . A number of studies have already compared the detection frequencies of multiplex assays with conventional monoplexPCR assays in clinical samples [12, [17] [18] [19] , but a comparison of the analytical sensitivity of these multiplex assays with quantified standardized control material does not exist.",

The RespiFinder-19 assay, which is based on the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analyzed by capillary electrophoresis, detects 15 respiratory viruses and 4 bacteria in one reaction [20] . A further development of the RespiFinder-19 assay is the RespiFinder-SMART-22 assay, which is also based on the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. This assay differentiates 18 respiratory viruses and 4 bacteria in one reaction by melt curve analysis. The xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel Fast Assay (RVP) is a bead array-based system for the detection of 19 different respiratory viruses [9, 10] . Previous studies with clinical samples showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the RVP assay was 78.8% and 99.6%, respectively, compared to real-time PCR-methods, that are currently declared as the gold standard [21] . Another study performed a comparison with clinical samples of the RespiFinder-19 with the precursor assay of the RVP [7] . Both assays in this study have an excellent specificity and the sensitivity was 33% and 78% for the RVP and the RespiFinder-19 assay, respectively.",

This highly artificial experiment emphasizes the general methodological limitation of multiplex PCR assay, because nearly all multiplex assays performed terribly analyzing samples with a high number of parallel pathogens. Therefore, these results have to be interpreted with attention. In the routine clinical setting, a parallel infection with this high number of different viruses is uncommon up to impossible, and the clinical relevance of these results is initially arguable.

Surprisingly, only a few differences were found compared to the highly artificial experiment with 13 viruses. Potential competitive reactions were found for the detection of RSV and AdV (RespiFinder) or INF-A, AdV and PIV-2 (RVP). However, some viruses were still not detected (e.g. RVP: CoV 229E, RespiFinder: INF-A). But we observed an influence of the elution volumes for the detection with the RespiFinder-19 and the RespiFinder-SMART-22. An elution volume of 100 \u03bcl showed the tendency of a higher analytical sensitivity. However, the elution volume seems to have differing influences depending on the contained viruses. For example, INF-A was detected more frequent in an elution volume of 100 \u03bcl, whereas RSV showed a higher detection frequency using an elution volume of 55 \u03bcl. No differences were found in the detection with the RVP assay, although we expected that the dilution of the DNA/RNA extract may result in a reduced analytical sensitivity. For routine testing using this different multiplex assays in parallel, we suggest an elution volume of 100 \u03bcl, because the remaining extract is available for retesting or analysis for non-included pathogens. If only one multiplex assay will be implemented, elution should be performed according to the specifications of the manufacturer.",

At that time, the RespiFinder-SMART-22 was not commercially available and later on, no residual extracted material was available for additional testing. For a comparison of the three multiplex assays with clinical samples further studies have to be done. This study indicated a higher clinical sensitivity of the RespiFinder-19 in the detection of virus infections in clinical samples with low concentrations in contrast to the RVP. Respiratory tract infections were found in 64% of the TS samples by RespiFinder-19. The RVP detected only 22% in the same samples, respectively. Gadsby et al. [21] also described problems in the detection of low virus concentrations with RVP; either the pathogens were not detected or they produced a false-positive for adenovirus. Raymaekers et al. [7] investigated clinical samples for a comparison of the RespiFinder-19 with the precursor assay of the RVP (xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Assay, Abbott Molecular, Wiesbaden, Germany). The precursor assay of the RVP included a target specific primer extension (TSPE) in contrast to the new assay, therefore these results are not directly comparable to the present study. In Raymaekers' study, respiratory viruses were detected by RVP in 31 of 95 clinical samples and by RespiFinder-19 in 75 of 95. These results are comparable to our results and verified our results in present study. A comparison of the precursor assay of the RVP with the newer RVP assay was made by Pabbaraju et al. [9] . They showed that the older assay was more sensitive than the newer RVP Fast assay (88.6% and 77.5% sensitivities, respectively) for all the viral targets combined. This corresponds to our observations concerning the RespiFinder-19. However, the higher sensitivity of the RespiFinder-19 assay may also be due to the detection of incidental but non-causal viruses. In 32% of the February TS samples the RespiFinder-19 assay detected multiple infections, corresponding to results of Fox [10] , whereas the RVP assay detected no multiple infections. Raymaekers et al. also described problems in the detection of co-infections Table 4 Patient samples with positive pathogen detection from winter and summer with the RVP. Samples which include adenovirus and coronavirus were false-negative with the RVP. We observed these problems in samples, which were positive for CMV and adenovirus. The importance of viral coinfections remains uncertain [11] [12] [13] . In summary, we detected multiple infections in 36% of the TS samples analyzed and the detection of multiple infections was only possible using the RespiFinder-19 assay. However, other studies also demonstrated the detection of multiple infections using the RVP assay [9, 21] . In this context, the question arises, whether all detected viruses in multiple infections are clinically relevant or not. In some cases the pathogens of the co-infections cause more serious illnesses, e.g. coronavirus, RSV or hMPV, than the pathogens of the primary infection, e.g. rhinovirus. With this study approach, none of the three assays can differentiate between pathogens of the primary infection and the co-infecting virus. Therefore, the clinical relevance of additionally detected viruses has to be correlated in further studies.",
