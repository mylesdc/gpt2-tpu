The PEDV isolate was 28,033 nucleotides (nt) in length without the polyadenylated sequences. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genome sequence of JSCZ1601 grouped it with the pandemic variants determined post-2010 into group 2 (G2). However, the S gene of JSCZ1601 formed a new subgroup separated from the subgroups containing the other G2 strains. Comparative analysis of the amino acids encoded by the S genes revealed the N-terminal of the deduced JSCZ1601 S protein had a novel two-amino-acid deletion (N58 and S59) compared with all identified genogroups. Further, compared with the reference strains, a 'G' insertion was detected in the 5\u2032 terminal of the 5\u2032UTR of the JSCZ1601. The animal experiment revealed that this strain was high pathogenic to neonatal pigs. Taken together, a PEDV strain with the new molecular characterizations and phylogenies was found in mainland China. It is necessary to strengthen the monitoring of PEDV variations.",

The disease is caused by the PED virus (PEDV), which belongs to family Coronaviridae, genus Alphacoronavirus, and has an envelope surrounding a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome 1,2 . The PEDV genome is approximately 28 kb nucleotides (nt) long and contains a 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR), a 3\u2032 UTR with a polyadenylated tail, and at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) arranged in the following order: ORF1a, ORF1b, spike (S) glycoprotein gene, ORF3 hypothetical protein gene, envelope (E) gene, membrane (M) gene and nucleocapsid (N) gene 3,4 . The 5\u2032 UTR is about 291-296 nt long and the 3\u2032 UTR is about 334 nt long. Two long ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, occupy two-thirds of the genome and encode two nonstructural polyproteins (pp1a and pp1b) that direct genome replication and transcription 5 . PED was first reported in feeding and fattening pigs in England in 1971 2 . In China, PED was identified as a sporadic viral enteric disease in pig herds before 2010 6-8 . However, outbreaks of PED with increased severity of diarrhoea, vomiting, and dehydration have occurred in China since 2010. The disease approached a mobility rate as high as 100% and a mortality rate of 80-100% in piglets less than 10 days old, and has been recognised as a devastating illness causing death in neonatal piglets 9,10 . New outbreaks associated with a novel PEDV strain that is genetically distant from the prototype PEDV strain, CV777, have been reported in China 8,11,12 . Since then, PED outbreaks have increased markedly and have spread rapidly across countries. In late April 2013, PED was first confirmed in the United States and subsequently spread quickly across the country 13-15 .",

Thus, the S protein is a primary target for the development of a vaccine against PED 19, 20 . Moreover, the S protein is considered to be the most antigenic of the encoded proteins, and several investigators have reported a high degree of genetic diversity in the S glycoprotein gene 12, 21, 22 . According to the phylogenetic analyses of the spike S gene, the PEDV strains were divided into two distinct clusters designated genogroup 1 (G1; classical) and genogroup 2 (G2; field epidemic or pandemic) 21, 23 . Concurrently, several variant PEDV strains, characterised by insertions and deletions (INDELs) in the S gene and designated S-INDEL PEDV, were found to be circulating in United States swine farms 24, 25 . Several strains with different deletions in the S gene were also reported in previous studies 22, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Thus, the S gene may be important for understanding the genetic relatedness of PEDV field isolates, the epidemiological status of the virus, and for vaccine development.",

The amino acid identity between the deduced S proteins of JSCZ1601 and PEDV-LYG was only 97.6%.

As shown in Fig. 2 , compared with the S protein sequence of G1 strain CV777, the deduced S protein of JSCZ1601 had two insertions (55TGENV58 and 136 N) and one deletion (157NI158), which is the same as the S proteins of the G2 strains AH2012, GD-A, and PEDV-LYG. Notably, the N-terminal of the JSCZ1601 S protein had an additional two-amino-acid deletion (N58 and S59) compared with the S protein of the representative strain CV777. And this deletion was also existed in JSCZ1601 compared with G2 strains, such as AH2012 and GD-A. Further, the two-amino-acid deletion in the JSCZ1601 S protein eliminated a potential N-glycosylation site that was located at positions 62-64 and 57-59 in the amino acid sequences of the S proteins in AH2012 and CV777, respectively. An additional 16 unique amino acid substitutions were detected in the S protein of JSCZ1601 compared with the S proteins of all the reference strains (Fig. 2 ). In addition, five unique substitutions (500 L/S, 520 H/P, 521 S/G, 590 D/N, and 600 G/V) occurred in one neutralizing epitope (amino acids 499-638) of the JSCZ1601 receptor-binding subunit S1 protein compared with all the reference strains. Moreover, the deduced S proteins of three S-INDEL strains, OH851, USA/IL20697/2014, and US/Iowa106/2013, had the same amino acid deletions and insertion as the G1 strains CV777 and JS2008. Nucleotide sequence comparison of 5\u2032-RNA termini. The 5\u2032 UTR of JSCZ1601 was 293 nt long, which is 3-nt shorter than the 5\u2032 UTR of CV777. As shown in Fig. 3 , 1-nt deletion, 4-nt deletions, and 1-nt insertion were detected in the proximal regions of the 5\u2032 UTRs of the CV777 and LZC strains compared with the other strains. Conversely, the 5\u2032 UTRs were relatively conserved between G2 members. Interestingly, a 'G' insertion was observed in the 5\u2032 terminal of the 5\u2032 UTR of JSCZ1601. And two another nucleotide substitutions, 137 C/T and 225 C/T were existed in the 5\u2032 UTR of JSCZ1601, when compared with the reference strains. Besides, the core sequence (5\u2032 -CUAAAC-3\u2032 ) of the PEDV leader transcription-regulating sequence was well conserved with no nucleotide substitutions detected in any of the PEDV strains.",

The death toll from the disease was over one million piglets in South China, with devastating damage to the pig industry. Our genetic analyses showed that the PEDV strains fell into two genogroups, G1 (classical) and G2 (variant) 21, 23 . The prevalent strains that caused the outbreak in Asia in late 2010 and the recent outbreaks in North America belonged to the G2 genogroup 13, 31 . In this study, we found a PEDV strain JSC1601 with new genetic characteristics while elucidating the molecular characteristics and phylogeny of PEDV field Previous studies have demonstrated that the 5\u2032 UTR of PEDV strains were highly conserved 7,13,32 . In general, strict conservation of these regions is essential for the PEDV life cycle. It is known that the 5\u2032 UTRs of coronaviruses form conserved RNA structural elements that are critical for viral replication, subgenomic mRNA transcription, and translation 33 . In this study, we found a 'G' insertion in the 5\u2032 terminal of the 5\u2032 UTR compared with the other PEDV strains. Studies on the beta-coronavirus indicated that stem-loop 4 (SL4) in the 5\u2032 UTRs was conserved among group 2 coronaviruses and may have a homolog in groups 1 and 3, and that SL4 may act as a cis-acting element for defective interfering RNA replication through interactions with cellular proteins 34 . In this study, the 223 T/C mutation was located in the SL4, which was identified in the 168-297nt region 34 . How these insertion and mutations affect the efficiency of virus replication needs to be addressed in future studies. The core sequence (5\u2032 -CUAAAC-3\u2032 ) in the transcription-regulating sequence of PEDV, which was also present in JSCZ1601, was reported to be a determinant factor in transcriptional regulation in coronavirus because the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA requires the appropriate tertiary structure of the core sequence 35 .",

Significant genetic variations in the S gene have been revealed between the newly determined PEDV field strains and early isolates 21, 38 . In this study, the amino acid sequence of the JSCZ1601 S protein shared only 97.6-98.1% identities with the S proteins of the reference strains. Besides, the phylogenetic analyses showed that the S gene of JSCZ1601 formed a separated subgroup in G2. All these data implied that the S gene of JSCZ1601 had undergoing significant genetic changes. The spike ectodomain consists of a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membrane-fusion subunit S2. S1 contains two domains, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain, both of which can potentially function as receptor-binding domains 39, 40 . Several neutralizing epitopes (499-638, 748-755, 764-771, and 1,368-1,374 amino acids) have also been identified 17, 36, 41 . In this study, the deduced JSCZ1601 S protein had a two-amino-acid deletion (N58 and S59) in the S1 N-terminal domain. And this deletion completely eliminated a potential N-glycosylation site that was present in the S proteins of the other strains. Moreover, five unique amino acid substitutions were identified in one neutralizing epitope of the S1 C-terminal domain of the JSCZ1601 S protein compared with the S proteins of all the PEDV reference strains. Whether these amino acids substitutions and the N-glycosylation site deletion influence the antigenicity and pathogenicity of PEDV remains to be investigated.",

This finding suggested that positions in subunit S1 and 711-914 in subunit S2 of the spike ectodomain may be non-essential regions in PEDV infection. The pathogenicity of the Tottori2-JPN-2014 strain has been reported to be mild 26 . Further, the novel PEDV strains with new amino acid deletions in their S genes have been found in fields in China. The S proteins of strains FJAX1 and FJAX2 were found to have a 66-67 amino acid deletion 28 and the S protein of HLJ2015/DP1-1 had a 377-380 amino acid deletion 29 compared with the CV777 S protein. However, the pathogenicity of these three strains has not been reported so far. A Chinese variant strain FL2013, which had a seven amino acid deletion (FEKVHVQ) in the C-terminus of the deduced S protein compared with the S proteins of the other G2 PEDV sequences, had reduced virulence in newborn piglets 30 . Together, these findings revealed that the genetic evolution of PEDV strains was variant, and the S gene of PEDV might be an important virulence gene. It is important to monitor the genetic variations in this virus, and virulent genes and regions of the PEDV genomes should be identified using the reverse genetic technologies. In addition, we also have investigated 35 samples from different pig farms in different cities and provinces (data not shown), and only one pig farm was found to have the epidemic of this strain JSCZ1601.

A severe diarrhoea epidemic broke out on this farm in January 2016 and caused the death of hundreds suckling piglets less than one week old. Several important pathogens, such as TGEV, RV, PRRSV, PCV, CSFV, and PRV, were confirmed to be negative in these samples (data not shown). We also checked several intestinal samples obtained from different piglets from different sows. The S gene sequences of these samples had the same characteristics as the JSCZ1601 S gene, which confirmed the severe diarrhoea epidemic was caused by the PEDV strain JSCZ1601. In order to measure the pathogenesis of JSCZ1601 in newborn piglets further, we used the virus inocula prepared from the intestine tissue sample and found that the JSCZ1601 strain could cause severe watery diarrhoea in piglets. And the low challenge dose (3 ml 1.42\u00d7 10 4 copies/ml inocula each piglet) might be one reason for the delayed time of diarrhea and the longer duration of disease. These results also revealed that the two-amino-acid deletion in the S protein did not attenuate the pathogenicity of the JSCZ1601 strain. We tried to isolate this strain in vitro using different Vero cell lines with trypsin, but failed. We will make attempts to obtain the virus isolate further.",

Meanwhile, the virulence of the new mutants may be changed, and Complete Genome sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from the tissue homogenate using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and suspended in nuclease-free water immediately before use. The first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocols. The entire PEDV genome was amplified by 14 pairs of primer designed with Primer 5.0 software based on the conserved regions determined by a multiple alignment analysis of the reference strains and CV777, and the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the genomic sequence were synthesized by using the rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE) kit (Clontech, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the primers used for the whole genome and the RACE procedure are provided in Table 2 . The overlapping fragments were amplified by PCR using the Phanta Super Fidelity DNA polymerase (Vazyme, China) , and the thermal cycling was performed at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 52 \u00b0C to 56 \u00b0C for 15 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 2 min, with a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 3 min.

Phylogenetic trees of the full-length genomic, ORF1a, ORF1b, S, ORF3, E, M and N nucleotide sequences were generated using the distance-based neighbor-joining method in the MEGA, version 5.05, software. The bootstrap values were calculated based on 1000 replicates, and the evolutionary distances were computed using the Jukes-Cantor method. The deduced amino acid sequence comparisons were obtained using the BioEdit software. Experimental design of infection. For the preparation of inocula for piglets, the intestine tissue sample was homogenized, diluted 1:4 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and centrifuged. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-\u03bc m-pore-size syringe filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and collected as the inocula. The RNA titers of the inocula was 1.42 log10 genomic copies/mL by using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) as reported 43 . Eight 3-day-old piglets, selected from one sow that was PEDV RNA and antibody negative, were divided into two groups (four piglets each) and housed in separate rooms. Pigs were fed a mixture of liquid milk replacer and yogurt and had free access to water. Groups A was challenged orally with 3 ml inocula. The four control piglets (Group B) were inoculated with PBS. All animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease, including diarrhea and vomiting. Rectal swabs were collected for scoring fecal denseness (scores: 0 normal; 1 pasty stool; 2 semiliquid diarrhea; and 3 liquid diarrhea) and for enumerating fecal viral RNA shedding by RT-qPCR. At necropsy, intestinal tissues and contents were grossly evaluated. Additionally, a portion of the jejunum and ileum were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathology. The villous atrophy is a typical histopathological change of the infection of a highly virulent PEDV [44] [45] [46] [47] . And the villous height and crypt depth (VH:CD) ratios would be calculated using a computerized image system with as previous described 44 . All of the animal experiments were performed with the approval of the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences Experimental Animal Ethics Committee (NKYVET 2015-0127) and were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.",

The whole-genome phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that JSCZ1601 along with the strains determined post-2010 clustered into genogroup G2. However, the S gene of JSCZ1601 formed a new subgroup that was separated from the other G2 strains. Further, comparative analysis of the amino acid sequence of the S protein revealed that the N-terminal of the JSCZ1601 S protein had a two-amino-acid deletion (N58 and S59) compared with the other G2 members. Compared with the other classical and variant strains, a 'G' insertion was also observed in the 5\u2032 terminal of the JSCZ1601 5\u2032 UTR. These data revealed that a PEDV strain with the new molecular characterizations and phylogenies was found in mainland China.",
