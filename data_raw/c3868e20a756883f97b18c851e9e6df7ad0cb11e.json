Infections with common respiratory viruses were determined by PCR or RT-PCR. HAdV positive samples were further typed by PCR and sequencing. Results: Among 3356 patients with ALRTIs, 194 (5.8 %) were found to have HAdV infection. HAdV infection was primarily confined to children (88.35 %) less than 5 years of age. A total of 11 different types of HAdV were detected throughout the study period, with HAdV-B7 (49.0 %) and HAdV-B3 (26.3 %) as the most prevalent types, followed by HAdV-C2 (7.7 %) and HAdVC1 (4.6 %). Newly emerging and re-emergent types or variants, HAdV-B55 (n = 5), HAdV-C57 (n = 3), and HAdV-B14p1 (n = 1), were identified. Results also included the reported first case of co-infection with HAdV-C2 and HAdV-C57. Clinical entities of patients with single HAdV infection (n = 49) were similar to those with mixed HAdV/respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections (n = 41). Patients with HAdV-B7 infection had longer duration of fever and higher serum levels of muscle enzymes than HAdV-B3-infected patients.",

In infants and young children, ALRTIs are most frequently caused by respiratory viruses. One such virus, human adenovirus (HAdV), plays a significant role in pediatric respiratory tract infections, accounting for 2-5 % of the overall respiratory illnesses and 4-10 % of the pneumonias [1, 2] . Although most cases are mild and indistinguishable from other viral causes, ALRTIs caused by HAdV can be severe, or even fatal, and are associated with the highest risk of long term respiratory sequelae [3] . Thus, HAdVassociated ALRTIs are of particular interest to both clinicians and researchers.",

Recently, HAdV-B14p1 has been associated with several large outbreaks of acute respiratory infection, which included severe and even fatal cases in the United States and Europe [16, 32] . Additionally, in 2011, an outbreak of febrile respiratory illness that affected 43 students in Gansu Province, China was reported to be caused by HAdV-B14p1 [33] . One HAdV-B14 infected patient who presented with bronchopneumonia and required hospitalization in April 2010 was identified. By further sequencing the fiber gene (data not shown), this strain was confirmed to be HAdV-B14p1 because it contained a unique characteristic 6-nuleotid deletion in fiber knob region as reported by Kajon et al. [32] . Last, this is the first report of detection of HAdV-C57 in respiratory samples collected from pediatric patients with ALRTIs and the first of co-detection of HAdV-C57 with HAdVC-2. HAdV-C57 (formerly designated strain 16700) was first isolated from the feces of a healthy child as part of an acute flaccid paralysis surveillance program. Computational genomic and bioinformatic analysis showed HAdV-C57 to be a recombinant virus with fiber gene nearly identical to HAdV-C6 and a unique hexon distinct from all viruses in species HAdV-C [34, 35] . Out of the three HAdV-C57-infected cases identified here, one was a previously healthy 9month-old male who presented with bronchopneumonia and conjunctivitis requiring hospitalization. Because only a small number of HAdV-C57 positive cases were found here and all were co-infected with other respiratory viruses, the pathogenic role of HAdV-C57 in respiratory infections will require further investigation.",

By nature of its design, this test can only reveal the dominant type. By applying PCR-based identification targeting hexon or fiber genes, co-infections with multiple HAdV types (types from same or different species) have been reported in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients [28, 29, [36] [37] [38] . In current study, results showed that one specimen contained both HAdV-C2 and HAdV-C57 by cloned sequencing the PCR products. These were amplified directly from respiratory samples using universal primers of hexon gene. This co-infected phenomenon was confirmed using the fiber gene sequencing results with type-specific primers (data not shown). The specimen was collected from a previously healthy 2.7-year old boy, presenting with fever, coughing and seizure at emergency department on December 10, 2009. Co-infection of different HAdV types has never been reported in any previous studies of Mainland China. The clinical implications of such co-infection remain unclear, and its role in HAdV pathogenesis and evolution will require further study.",

However, no significant differences in clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were found between patients with single HAdV infection and those co-infected with RSV except that coinfections were more frequently observed in younger children. Similarly, a study from Peru also did found no higher prevalence of any clinical manifestations in coinfected patients than in those infected with HAdV alone [26] . The results of another report from Chile showed the clinical severity to be the same in patients with single HAdV infection and those with mixed RSV-HAdV infections [39] . These data demonstrate that, as more sensitive molecular methods become more frequently used to identify pathogens, co-detection of different viruses in the same specimen may also become more common. However, the clinical role of such coinfections will still require independent investigations.",

Such results may suggest that HAdV-B7 infection tended to cause more extrapulmonary tissue damage (such as liver and heart) and may have more severe clinical consequence. This is a cross-sectional study. Only one respiratory sample was collected from each patient and no viral load analysis was performed. Although HAdV is a pathogen that for long has been known to cause respiratory tract infection, asymptomatic carriage of the virus may persist for weeks [18] .
