            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe acute lower respiratory tract disease. Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) serves as an innate immune sensor and triggers antiviral responses upon recognizing viral infections including RSV. Since tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25)-mediated K63-polyubiquitination is crucial for RIG-I activation, several viruses target initial RIG-I activation through ubiquitination. RSV NS1 and NS2 have been shown to interfere with RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling. In this study, we explored the possibility that NS1 suppresses RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling by targeting TRIM25. Ubiquitination of ectopically expressed RIG-I-2Cards domain was decreased by RSV infection, indicating that RSV possesses ability to inhibit TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. Similarly, ectopic expression of NS1 sufficiently suppressed TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. Furthermore, interaction between NS1 and TRIM25 was detected by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Further biochemical assays showed that the SPRY domain of TRIM25, which is responsible for interaction with RIG-I, interacted sufficiently with NS1. Suppression of RIG-I ubiquitination by NS1 resulted in decreased interaction between RIG-I and its downstream molecule, MAVS. The suppressive effect of NS1 on RIG-I signaling could be abrogated by overexpression of TRIM25. Collectively, this study suggests that RSV NS1 interacts with TRIM25 and interferes with RIG-I ubiquitination to suppress type-I interferon signaling.",

As seen in Figure 2A , ubiquitination of ectopically expressed GST-RIG-IN is decreased by the presence of RSV (multiplicity of infection = 4), suggesting that RSV is capable of suppressing RIG-I ubiquitination to modulate RIG-I signaling. Next, we have tested whether RIG-I ubiquitination is affected by the presence of NS1. As shown in Figure 2B , both NS1 and NS2 suppressed the TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-IN. Increasing amounts of NS1 resulted in an augmented effect on reducing the ubiquitinated form of RIG-IN ( Figure 2C ). The results clearly showed that NS1 is capable of interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination to suppress RIG-I-mediated interferon production. were repeated at least three times.

However, we could not detect any interaction (Data not shown). Therefore, interaction between TRIM25 and NS1 was investigated to determine whether NS1 targets TRIM25 to suppress RIG-I ubiquitination. Obvious interaction between ectopically expressed Viruses 2018, 10, 716 6 of 12 TRIM25 and NS1 was detected by the co-immunoprecipitation assay, whereas interaction between NS2 and TRIM25 was not detected ( Figure 3A) . Furthermore, endogenous TRIM25 was also co-precipitated with NS1, supporting that RSV NS1 targets TRIM25 ( Figure 3B ). Co-localization of NS1 and TRIM25 in the cytoplasm was detected by confocal microscopic observation ( Figure 3C ). To further dissect the interaction between NS1 and TRIM25, we determined the domain of TRIM25 that is responsible for this interaction using truncated TRIM25 domains. FLAG-tagged NS1 was expressed along with the RING domain, B-Box/CCD domain, or SPRY domain of TRIM25 and co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed. As depicted in Figure 3D , the SPRY domain sufficiently interacts with NS1, whereas the RING or B-Box/CCD domains do not show any interaction. In addition, the SPRY deleted TRIM25 mutant failed to interact with NS1, indicating that the SPRY domain is required for interaction with NS1 ( Figure 3E ). Figure 4A , Figure 4A ). To further confirm the effect of NS1 on RIG-I activation, the effect of NS1 ectopic expression on RIG-IN interaction with MAVS was examined. FLAG-tagged MAVS-CARD-PRD and GST-tagged RIG-IN was co-expressed with increasing amounts of V5-tagged NS1 followed by a co-immunoprecipitation assay using an anti-FLAG antibody. As seen in Figure 4B ,C, the clear interaction between RIG-IN and MAVS-CARD-PRD was decreased by NS1 expression in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that RSV NS1 expression diminishes the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. Since TRIM25 oligomerization is crucial for its E3-ligase activity, it has been tested whether NS1 suppresses TRIM25 E3-ligase activity by interfering the oligomerization. As seen in Figure 4D , expression of NS1 did not affect the interaction between Interaction between HA-TRIM25 and V5-TRIM25 was analyzed by co-IP and immunoblotting using indicated antibodies.

Indeed, we could demonstrate that NS1 and NS2 suppressed TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I, which is a crucial step for RIG-I activation. Previously, NS2 has been shown to interact with RIG-I, whereas the interaction between NS1 and RIG-I could not be detected [15] . Thus, suppression of RIG-I ubiquitination by NS2 may be due to its interaction with RIG-I. We also could not detect interaction between NS1 and RIG-I, indicating that NS1 may utilize a separate molecular mechanism to suppress RIG-I ubiquitination. In addition, a previous study showed that NS1 co-localizes with MAVS and inhibits RIG-I interaction with MAVS [16] . Considering that RIG-I ubiquitination is required for its oligomerization and interaction with MAVS, it is conceivable that NS1 suppresses RIG-I interaction with MAVS by interfering with RIG-I ubiquitination, as shown in the current study.",

            "text": "Thus, it was tempting to test the hypothesis that NS1 targets TRIM25, an E3-ubiquitin ligase responsible for RIG-I ubiquitination. Moreover, several viruses utilize their proteins to interfere with TRIM25 activation and subsequent RIG-I activation. For instance, the Influenza NS1 binds to TRIM25 and inhibits TRIM25 multimerization [10] . The SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein binds to TRIM25 SPRY and disrupts RIG-I ubiquitination [23] . In this study, the interaction between NS1 and TRIM25 was demonstrated. Since several studies have shown that TRIM25 migrates to the mitochondria upon viral infection to interact with MAVS [24] , the interaction between MAVS and NS1 might be a result of the interaction between NS1 and TRIM25. As expected, NS1 inhibited the interaction between RIG-I CARD and MAVS. These results clearly indicate that NS1 is capable of suppressing RIG-I activation by targeting TRIM25 and inhibiting RIG-I ubiquitination through TRIM25. We have shown that NS1 could suppress the interferon-\u03b2 promoter activity induced by RIG-IN and MAVS, indicating that NS1 is also capable of suppressing downstream signaling. This can be explained by previous studies showing that NS1 can trigger the degradation of critical downstream molecules such as IRF3. Nonetheless, we have shown that NS1 can suppress TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-IN without affecting its amount and that its effect on RIG-IN-mediated interferon-\u03b2 promoter activity can be reversed by an excessive amount of TRIM25. These results indicate that inhibition of TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination by NS1 contributes to the suppression of RIG-I signaling, at least in part.",

Given that the SPRY domain is responsible for interaction with RIG-I, a possible molecular mechanism is that NS1 binds to TRIM25 and sequesters it to prevent its interaction with RIG-I. However, we could not observe a significant reduction in interaction between RIG-I and TRIM25 by NS1 (Data not shown). Further studies are needed to identify the detailed molecular mechanism of RSV NS1-mediated TRIM25 dysfunction.",

In a previous study, RSV NS1 and NS2 have been shown to exist as homo-or heterodimers in mammalian cells. The RSV NS1-NS2 dimer was detected in mitochondria, suggesting that NS1 and NS2 can cooperate to suppress RIG-I signaling [18] . It is also possible that the dimer of RSV NS1 and NS2 interacts with TRIM25 and RIG-I CARD through each NS protein interacting with TRIM25 or RIG-I CARD. Although we could not observe a significant synergistic effect of NS1 and NS2 co-expression in terms of suppression of RIG-I ubiquitination ( Figure 1C) , the NS1 and NS2 interaction may have additional functions in RIG-I signaling. For instance, it is possible that the NS1/NS2 complex induces RIG-I degradation followed by suppression of RIG-I K63-ubiquitination for complete inhibition of the RIG-I signaling pathway.",
