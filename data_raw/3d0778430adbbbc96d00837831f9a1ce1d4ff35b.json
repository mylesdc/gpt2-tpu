            "text": "Genetic engineering of cytomegalovirus (CMV) currently relies on generating a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) by introducing a bacterial origin of replication into the viral genome using in vivo recombination in virally infected tissue culture cells. However, this process is inefficient, results in adaptive mutations, and involves deletion of viral genes to avoid oversized genomes when inserting the BAC cassette. Moreover, BAC technology does not permit the simultaneous manipulation of multiple genome loci and cannot be used to construct synthetic genomes. To overcome these limitations, we adapted synthetic biology tools to clone CMV genomes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using an early passage of the human CMV isolate Toledo, we first applied transformation-associated recombination (TAR) to clone 16 overlapping fragments covering the entire Toledo genome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Then, we assembled these fragments by TAR in a stepwise process until the entire genome was reconstituted in yeast. Since next-generation sequence analysis revealed that the low-passage-number isolate represented a mixture of parental and fibroblast-adapted genomes, we selectively modified individual DNA fragments of fibroblast-adapted Toledo (Toledo-F) and again used TAR assembly to recreate parental Toledo (Toledo-P). Linear, full-length HCMV genomes were transfected into human fibroblasts to recover virus. Unlike Toledo-F, Toledo-P displayed characteristics of primary isolates, including broad cellular tropism in vitro and the ability to establish latency and reactivation in humanized mice. Our novel strategy thus enables de novo cloning of CMV genomes, more-efficient genome-wide engineering, and the generation of viral genomes that are partially or completely derived from synthetic DNA.",

            "text": "IMPORTANCE The genomes of large DNA viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), are difficult to manipulate using current genetic tools, and at this time, it is not possible to obtain, molecular clones of CMV without extensive tissue culture. To overcome these limitations, we used synthetic biology tools to capture genomic fragments from viral DNA and assemble full-length genomes in yeast. Using an early passage of the HCMV isolate Toledo containing a mixture of wild-type and tissue culture-adapted virus. we directly cloned the majority sequence and recreated the minority sequence by simultaneous modification of multiple genomic regions. Thus, our novel approach provides a paradigm to not only efficiently engineer HCMV and other large DNA viruses on a genome-wide scale but also facilitates the cloning and genetic manipulation of primary isolates and provides a pathway to generating entirely synthetic genomes. KEYWORDS Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cloning, cytomegalovirus, genetic recombination P ersistent infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is widely prevalent in the human population and mostly asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals (1) . However, HCMV can cause disease upon immunosuppression, and HCMV is the most frequent infectious cause of congenital defects such as hearing loss (2) . For this reason, vaccine development against HCMV has been given high priority, and multiple approaches have been and are being tried, so far with limited success (3) . Due to its unique immunogenicity and T cell programming potential, recombinant CMV has also shown great promise as a vaccine vector for chronic infections such as HIV in nonhuman primate models, and clinical development of HCMV-based vectors is under way (4) .",

However, the large size of CMV genomes (\u03fe230 kb) renders genetics challenging. Initially, recombinant CMV was generated by marker rescue (5) or by in vivo recombination of overlapping cosmids (6) . However, both techniques have been superseded by the cloning of CMV as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) which allowed the genetic manipulation of complete CMV genomes in Escherichia coli (7) . BAC clones are generated by replacing a genomic region that is nonessential for growth in tissue culture with a bacterial origin of replication together with a selectable marker using in vivo recombination in infected fibroblasts. Upon transformation of the BAC into E. coli, the deleted region can be reinserted, thus generating a full-length viral genome containing the BAC cassette. Recombinant virus is reconstituted upon transfection of the BAC into healthy diploid fibroblast cells followed by the recombinase-mediated excision of the BAC cassette that leaves a loxP \"scar\" in the genome (8) .",

First and foremost, BAC cloning requires extensive virus passaging in tissue culture, since the insertion of the BAC cassette and subsequent selection of recombinants still use the traditional marker rescue method. This procedure prevents the direct cloning of HCMV genomic DNA isolated from clinical samples and rapidly selects for viral subpopulations and viral mutants adapted to growth in tissue culture (9) . Since recent work revealed an astounding diversity of HCMV genomes in infected individuals (10) , the requirement for tissue culture limits our ability to characterize individual clones within a swarm of genomes. As a result, relatively few HCMV genomes have been cloned as a BAC, and all of the original BAC clones show typical signs of tissue culture adaptation (11, 12) . Furthermore, the restoration of the actual sequence present in the primary isolate often requires multiple sequential cloning steps (9) .",

Several bacterial genomes have been cloned and maintained in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and completely synthetic versions of entire chromosomes of several Mycoplasma species were assembled from DNA fragments (14, 15) . These synthetic biology approaches thus take advantage of the unique ability of S. cerevisiae to capture and reliably join DNA fragments into entire heterologous chromosomes that can be successfully maintained as yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC). Particularly useful for direct cloning of DNA from a given sample is transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning in which linear DNA containing a yeast plasmid flanked by sequences homologous to a target sequence is transformed together with the target sequence (16) . Upon recombination in vivo, the target sequence is then contained within a yeast plasmid.",

As our test case, we used the earliest available passages of the HCMV isolate Toledo, the only low-passage-number isolate that has ever been used in experimental infection of humans. Toledo was isolated from a congenitally infected child, and the fourth passage was initially characterized in seropositive individuals (17) and later used to infect seronegative individuals or individuals who had been previously vaccinated with the serially passaged Towne strain (18) . In both instances, there were clear immunological and clinical signs of infection as well as superinfection consistent with Toledo representing a fully infectious HCMV isolate representative of circulating strains. However, cloning and sequencing of the full-length genome of Toledo as a BAC revealed that, compared to other primary isolates, Toledo displayed genome inversions and deletions consistent with tissue culture adaptations (11) . We now demonstrate that low-passage-number isolates of Toledo represented a mixture of both the fibroblast-adapted version and the parental sequence. Using TAR cloning, we generated both versions of Toledo and demonstrate that only the parental virus has the in vitro and in vivo hallmarks of a primary isolate.",

            "text": "Passage 7 of HCMV Toledo contains both wild-type and mutated ULb' regions. Compared to other primary isolates, BAC-cloned HCMV Toledo displayed an inversion in the so-called ULb' region that is frequently mutated upon multiple passages of HCMV. Specifically, BAC-cloned Toledo displayed an inversion resulting from a recombination event within sequences located between UL128 and UL129 at one end and UL133 and UL148a at the other end ( Fig. 1A) (11) . This recombination event led to a truncation of UL128 (19) , a chemokine-like protein that is a subunit of the pentameric complex gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A (20, 21) . While the pentameric complex promotes infection of endothelial, epithelial, and myeloid cells, mutations in the nonessential subunits UL128, UL130, and UL131A are selected for upon passaging in fibroblasts, presumably due to the fact that pentamer-deficient viruses are less cell associated (12 attenuated in vivo (22) , this fibroblast adaptation was at odds with the clinical observations in volunteers inoculated with the Toledo isolate. Therefore, we determined whether early passages of Toledo already contained this deletion by isolating DNA from supernatants of fibroblasts infected with Toledo passage 7 (P7), the earliest passage still available, and performing diagnostic PCR of genes adjacent to UL128 of UL133 and the native versus inverted configuration. In the HCMV isolate TR, used as a control, UL128 is adjacent to UL127, whereas UL133 is adjacent to UL148 as indicated by the appropriate PCR fragments PCR-1 and PCR-3 (Fig. 1B) . Interestingly, the same fragments were also amplified from P7 Toledo, indicating a noninverted genome orientation similar to that of TR. In addition, P7 Toledo also contained genomes in the inverted configuration in which UL128 is adjacent to UL148 (PCR-4) and UL133 is adjacent to UL127 (PCR-2) (Fig. 1B) . Thus, the early passages of Toledo used in clinical trials consisted of a mixture of wild-type and fibroblast-adapted genome configurations. Next-generation sequence analysis of an early passage of HCMV Toledo. To further examine the genome content of low-passage-number Toledo samples in an unbiased fashion, we employed Illumina HiSeq paired-end sequencing on viral DNA isolated from the supernatant of fibroblasts infected with P7 Toledo. The depth of sequence coverage was sufficient to obtain the full-length sequences of both the majority sequence representing the fibroblast-adapted Toledo strain and the minority, presumably parental, wild-type sequence. We will refer to the fibroblast-adapted Toledo strain and the presumably parental wild-type strain as Toledo-F and Toledo-P, respectively. Toledo-F was mostly identical to the Toledo sequence deposited into GenBank (GenBank accession number GU937742.2). However, a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, most of them synonymous mutations (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). These SNPs are either due to sequencing errors in the GenBank sequence or mutations that occurred during further passaging and cloning of the Toledo isolate. In order to model the sequence of the Toledo-P genome and the Toledo-F genome, we edited the reference genome sequence (GenBank accession number GU937742.2) based on our sequencing results. Individual SNPs were allocated to either one or both Toledo genomes based on the following criteria. If the variation was homogeneous, it was applied to both genomes. If the variation was heterogenous, the major allele was applied to the fibroblast-adapted genome, while the minor allele was applied to the parental genome. Usually, for heterogeneous variations, one of the alleles would match the allele in the reference genome, such that \"applying\" it would be to take no action to the derivative genome at that locus. Alignment of the full-length sequences of Toledo-F and Toledo-P revealed that, in addition to the inversion of the UL128-UL133 fragment which is flanked by two small deletions, Toledo-F had a 279-bp in-frame deletion in the RL13 gene, as previously reported (23), a 59-bp insertion in the intergenic region between UL59 and UL60, as well as several SNPs in the UL region ( Fig. 2A and B) . By comparing the sequence coverage (number of reads) of Toledo-F versus Toledo-P at the SNP loci, we were able to estimate the ratio of the two sequences in the viral DNA preparation. The P7 Toledo-F genomes represented the vast majority of sequences, whereas only 5% of the reads belonged to Toledo-P (Fig. 2C ). Since only these two genome sequences were detected in the P7 sample, it is highly likely that P7 represents an intermediate mixture in which most of the culture has been taken over by a faster-growing, fibroblastadapted variant, with some of the original isolate remaining. Similar observations have been reported upon serial passaging of the primary isolate Merlin where mutations in RL13 occurred within three passages, and mutations in the UL128-to-UL131A (UL128-131A) region upon subsequent passages (12) . Since clinical studies were performed with passage 4 Toledo, these data also suggest that the percentage of non-fibroblastadapted, wild-type, sequence was likely higher, although no passage 4 samples remain, making it impossible to determine the exact composition.",

In the first step, we generated two half genomes by cotransforming overlapping DNA fragments 1 to 8 and fragments 9 to 16 together with the YCpBAC vector into S. cerevisiae (Fig. 4A ). The resulting half genomes were also transferred into E. coli and characterized by PCR analysis (Fig. 4A ). Assembly of the half genomes was very efficient. Positive results were observed in 95% of the clones that were screened. To generate a full-length genome, the half genomes were released from the YCpBAC by I-SceI or PacI restriction digestion and transformed together with linearized YCpBAC containing TAR hooks for the beginning and end of the HCMV genome (Table S1 ). The resulting full-length genomes in S. cerevisiae were analyzed by junction PCR analysis (Fig. 4B) , and positive clones were transformed into E. coli. The success rate for assembling full-length Toledo-F genomes in yeast was approximately 15%, and the transfer of the full-length genomes to E. coli was close to 100% efficient. Next-generation sequence analysis showed that the TAR-assembled HCMV genome was identical to the P7 Toledo-F sequence present in the low-passagenumber sample (Fig. 4C ).",

After 4 passages in MRC-5 cells, purified viral stocks were generated for in vitro and in vivo characterization. At the same time, viral DNA was extracted by the Hirt method and sequenced by NGS. Comparison of the Toledo-P virus with the YCpBAC sequence revealed frameshift mutations in RL13 amino acid residue 193 and in UL128 amino acid residue 154 ( Fig. 5B and C) . The frameshift mutation in RL13 and UL128 were found in approximately 71% and 85% of the genomes, respectively, suggesting that mutations in these gene regions are rapidly selected for even when starting with a molecular clone. However, while the RL13 mutation truncates the protein by 50% and likely inactivates the protein, the frameshift in UL128 eliminates only the final 16 amino acids. Since UL128 is a subunit of the pentameric complex that facilitates entry into nonfibroblast cells, we determined whether the UL128 truncation would affect the anticipated ability of Toledo-P to infect endothelial cells. In a multistep growth curve (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 0.01) in MRC-5 cells, both Toledo-P and Toledo-F generated comparable titers of virus in the supernatant and with comparable kinetics (Fig. 6A ). In contrast, only Toledo-P was able to grow in human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs), whereas Toledo-F did not grow (Fig. 6A) . These data suggest that Toledo-P retained a functional pentameric complex despite the truncation in UL128.",

At 1 week after mobilization, the mice were sacrificed. Total DNA was extracted from the spleens and livers, and HCMV genomes were analyzed using quantitative PCR. When comparing G-CSF-treated to untreated groups, we were able to detect quantitative differences in viral DNA loads in the spleen and liver for both HCMV TR and Toledo-P (Fig. 6B) . In contrast, no increase in viral genome copies were observed for Toledo-F. Moreover, compared to HCMV-TR and Toledo-P, genome copy numbers tended to be lower even in nonmobilized mice infected with Toledo-F.

Thus, this method potentially enables the direct cloning of CMV from clinical samples, e.g., from viral DNA isolated from congenitally infected infants, without the need for tissue culture. The \"TAR hooks\" used to generate the 16 genome fragments were designed to represent highly conserved genome sequences so that most HCMV genomes can be cloned by this method. However, in case of sequence mismatches, TAR hooks can be easily modified according to sequencing results obtained from the same DNA sample. This cloning method can also be applied to new DNA virus isolates for which in vitro culture conditions have not been established (31) . Probably due to the large size of the HCMV genome (\u03fe230 kb) and the presence of terminal repeats at each end of the genome, A total of 80,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate were infected in duplicate at am MOI of 0.5.

Instead, we generated two half genomes of eight fragments each, which were combined into a full-length genome in a second recombination step. In contrast, smaller herpesvirus genomes like herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) can be assembled in one step (43) . TAR cloning is thus the first method that permits direct cloning of herpesviral genomes. In addition, by synthesizing individual TAR fragments, this method can be used to generate partially or fully synthetic HCMV genomes. Synthetic viral genomes have been successfully assembled from individual fragments for smaller viruses, e.g., a 31-kb consensus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus genome from bats (32) . However, to date, this has not been possible for large DNA viruses due to the lack of a suitable technology. As the parallel chemical synthesis of large DNA fragments is becoming feasible and affordable (33) , the assembly of synthetic HCMV genomes from individual fragments in yeast described here will ultimately enable construction of a completely synthetic genome. By modifying the sequence of any of the 16 fragments independently, it is also possible to simultaneously change multiple genomic loci as exemplified here by the reconstruction of the Toledo-P sequence by exchanging three fragments of Toledo-F. Thus, various full-length genomes that are ready to be transfected can be assembled from the fragments in about 3 to 4 weeks under ideal conditions. In contrast, the introduction of multiple mutations by BAC technology requires multiple steps of sequential mutagenesis. Moreover, the final assembled HCMV genome does not contain any heterologous sequences once released by restriction digestion, whereas removal of the BAC cassette by Cre recombinase leaves a loxP site in the viral genome. Due to this versatility, TAR-based cloning will also enable the generation of hybrid genomes, e.g., between different cytomegalovirus (CMV) strains or species to facilitate mapping of strain-or species-specific traits. The fact that native viral DNA that does not contain residual bacterial sequences is excised from the YCpBAC prior to transfection will additionally facilitate the recovery of live virus without the need of further genome manipulations such as Cre-based excision of the BAC cassette.",

However, it is also possible that the inversion of the ULb' fragment affects gene expression within the UL133-138 gene locus which has been implicated in viral latency as well as infection of endothelial cells (29) . Thus, multiple mutations could contribute to the attenuated phenotype of Toledo-F in vivo.",

            "text": "Interestingly, Toledo-P rapidly adapted to tissue culture conditions by mutating RL13 and UL128, two of the gene regions that were mutated in Toledo-F and that were repaired in the Toledo-P YCpBAC. Thus, even when HCMV Toledo-P is recovered from a molecular clone that was intact, mutations in these genes are rapidly selected for in vitro. Thus, it seems likely that the Toledo-F variant was not present within the initial isolate but resulted from random mutation and selection upon passaging in vitro. The rapid selection for mutations in RL13 and the nonessential pentamer subunits UL128, UL130, and UL131A from an intact molecular clone have been very well documented for the low-passage-number isolate Merlin (9) . This work demonstrated that intact RL13, a viral Fc receptor (34, 35) , limits viral propagation in all cell types, and mutants are selected upon very few passages (12) . Thus, unless RL13 is conditionally expressed, RL13 mutants will arise in vitro. In contrast, UL128-131A mutants arise only upon passaging in fibroblasts (36) so the selection of these types of mutants can be avoided by growing virus in nonfibroblast cells such as epithelial cells. To maintain the genetic integrity of the repairs of RL13 and UL128 in Toledo-P, it would thus be required to control RL13 and UL128 expression via a conditional promoter as demonstrated for Merlin (37) . However, despite the accumulation of mutations in both RL13 and UL128 in the majority of the viral genomes at passage 4, there was a clear difference in the ability of Toledo-P to infect endothelial cells and to infect monocyte/macrophages in NSG mice. One possible explanation is that these differences were due to the residual intact virus, similar to the situation in the passage 4 isolate used in clinical trials. Alternatively, the truncation in UL128 of P4 Toledo-P might still retain some pentamer function, a possibility that is supported by mutational studies that demonstrated a limited impact of C-terminal mutations of UL128 on endothelial cell infection (38) . Clonal separation of the intact versus mutated version of Toledo will be required to distinguish between these possibilities.",

            "text": "Taken together, our data thus suggest that due to multiple mutations, Toledo-F is severely limited in its ability to establish and maintain latent infection. Importantly, cosmid clones of Toledo-F were previously used to generate chimeric viruses with the Towne vaccine strain in order to generate a vaccine strain that is less attenuated than the highly passaged Towne strain (25, 26) . However, all four different chimeric viruses were unable to elicit clinical or immunological symptoms in HCMV-seropositive individuals at doses up to 1,000 PFU (26) . Moreover, although CD8 \u03e9 T cell responses were detected in seronegative individuals inoculated with two of the chimeras, the CD8 \u03e9 T cell responses were weak (27) and did not demonstrate the typical expansion of effector memory T cells observed with CMV infection (25) . The finding that Towne/ Toledo-F chimeras were unable to recapitulate the immune response naturally elicited by HCMV correlates with the lack of Toledo-F to reactivate upon monocyte mobilization, suggesting that the chimeric viruses were likely unable to establish the persistent infection required to elicit and maintain effector memory. By modifying individual TAR fragments in Toledo-P, it is now possible to design a new generation of HCMV Toledo-based vaccines and vaccine vectors with the goal of retaining the ability of HCMV to elicit lasting effector memory while introducing safety features that eliminate viral pathogenesis.",

First, half genomes (TAR01 to TAR08 and TAR09 to TAR16) were assembled as follows. Vector DNA was amplified by PCR using pCCIBAC-ura3 as the template and either Con01R (R stands for reverse)and Con08F (F stands for Engineering of HCMV Using Synthetic Biology Tools September/October 2017 Volume 2 Issue 5 e00331-17 msphere.asm.org 13 forward) or CMV_1R and CMV_8F (Table S1 ) as primers for TAR01 to TAR08 or Con09R and Con16F or CMV_9R and CMV_16F (Table S1 ) for TAR09 to TAR16.

The culture was then cooled to 20\u00b0C, and isopropyl-\u2424-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM to induce protein expression. Cas9 protein was induced overnight in a refrigerated incubator at 20\u00b0C under shaking (220 rpm).

One-hour digestions were performed at 37\u00b0C in 50-l volume and contained 500 ng of plasmid DNA, 1 g each gRNA, 10 mM spermidine (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM MgCl 2 (Ambion), 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 3.6 g of Cas9 protein. Following digestion, Cas9 was heat inactivated at 80\u00b0C for 10 min, and digested DNA was extracted with UltraPure phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, vol/vol; pH 8), precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in sterile water. DNA fragments used to generate Toledo-P insert fragments 1 and 7 were obtained from de novo-synthesized gblocks (IDT). The Toledo-P fragment 1 insert encoded a 279-bp insertion not found in the Toledo-F sequence. Conversely, the Toledo-P fragment 7 insert removed a 52-bp insert found only in Toledo-F. Both DNA inserts contained 20-to 100-bp overlap sequences homologous to regions upstream and downstream of the Cas9 digestion sites to facilitate in vitro assembly. Synthesized insert fragments were mixed with corresponding digested products at a 3:1 molar ratio (insert-vector) and covalently joined via standard Gibson Assembly reaction (SGI-DNA). Following assembly, constructs were transformed into E. coli TransforMax EPI300 electrocompetent cells (Epicentre) and plated on selective media. Transformants were verified to contain new inserts using PCR and Sanger sequencing prior to final confirmation of the full Toledo-P genome sequence by nextgeneration sequencing (NGS).",

All animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations of the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (number IS00003498) at the Oregon Health & Science University. NOD-scid IL2R\u2425 c null (NSG) mice were maintained at a pathogen-free facility at Oregon Health & Science University in accordance with procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Both sexes of animals were used. Humanized mice were generated as previously described (30) . The animals (12 to 14 weeks after engraftment) were treated with 25 ng/mouse lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and after 6 h, they were infected via intraperitoneal injection of human dermal fibroblasts previously infected with HCMV TR, Toledo-P, or Toledo-F at approximately 5 \u03eb 10 5 PFU per mouse. A control group of engrafted mice were mock infected using uninfected fibroblasts. At 4 weeks postinfection, the infected mice were split into two groups, and one group was treated with 100 l of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (300 mg/ml; Amgen) using a subcutaneous micro-osmotic pump (1007D; Alzet) and 125 g AMD3100 [1,1=-[1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)]bis-1,4,8,11-tetra-azacyclotetradecane octahydrochloride or plerixafor] administered intraperitoneally to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). The remaining mice serve as a direct comparison for the effects of virus reactivation and dissemination that follow HPC mobilization. One week after HPC mobilization, the mice were sacrificed, their organs were harvested, and samples for PCR were frozen in RNAlater solution and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C for subsequent analysis.",
