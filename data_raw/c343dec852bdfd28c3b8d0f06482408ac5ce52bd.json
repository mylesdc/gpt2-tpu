            "text": "A balanced immune response to infection is essential to prevent the pathology and tissue damage that can occur from an unregulated or hyperactive host defense. Interferons (IFNs) are critical mediators of the innate defense to infection, and in this study we evaluated the contribution of a specific gene coding for IFIT2 induced by type I IFNs in a murine model of disseminated Candida albicans. Invasive candidiasis is a frequent challenge during immunosuppression or surgical medical interventions, and C. albicans is a common culprit that leads to high rates of mortality. When IFIT2 knockout mice were infected systemically with C. albicans, they were found to have improved survival and reduced fungal burden compared to wild-type mice. One of the mechanisms by which IFIT2 increases the pathological effects of invasive C. albicans appears to be suppression of NADPH oxidase activation. Loss of IFIT2 increases production of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes, and we demonstrate that IFIT2 is a binding partner of a critical regulatory subunit of NADPH oxidase, p67 phox . Since the administration of IFN has been used therapeutically to combat viral infections, cancer, and multiple sclerosis, we evaluated administration of IFN-\u2424 to mice prior to C. albicans infection. IFN-\u2424 treatment promoted pathology and death from C. albicans infection. We provide evidence that IFIT2 increases the pathological effects of invasive C. albicans and that administration of IFN-\u2424 has deleterious effects during infection.",

This lifethreatening disease is common in patients with weakened immune systems, either due to disease or as a result of therapies. Type I interferons (IFN) are cytokines of the innate defense response that are used as immune modulators in the treatment of specific cancers, viral infections, and multiple sclerosis. In this study, we show using a murine model that the loss of a specific IFN-stimulated gene coding for IFIT2 improves survival following systemic C. albicans infection. This result infers a harmful effect of IFN during C. albicans infection and is supported by our finding that administration of IFN-\u2424 prior to invasive infection promotes fatal pathology. The findings contribute to our understanding of the innate immune response to C. albicans, and they suggest that IFN therapies present a risk factor for disseminated candidiasis.",

The opportunistic fungus Candida albicans is among the most common causes of infection in health care institutions, and disseminated candidiasis is linked to mortality rates of greater than 40% (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Major risk factors include the use of antibiotics, catheters, chemotherapy, and surgical intervention. The efficacy of existing antifungal drugs is limited, and consequently there is an urgent need to explore the interplay between C. albicans and the host defense response to decipher mechanisms that enable or disable systemic fungal invasion (7) (8) (9) (10) .",

            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are critical mediators of innate immune defense that were originally discovered for their protection against viral infections (11) (12) (13) (14) . Subsequently they were found to elicit various biological responses, including inhibition of cancer malignancies, and so their clinical use was expanded (11, 15) . IFNs are also produced in defense response to bacterial and fungal infections; however, IFNs are reported to have both protective and deleterious effects during infection with these microbes. Type I IFNs (predominantly IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424) bind to the same cell surface receptor composed of two subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Signal transduction by type I IFNs triggers the expression of hundreds of genes known as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that confer varied biological effects in viral defense, differentiation, proliferation, and metabolism (16) (17) (18) (19) . In this report, we evaluated the role in invasive candidiasis of the IFN-induced gene with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2), also known as ISG54 (20) . IFIT2 is a member of a family of ISGs with TPRs, structurally conserved motifs involved in multiple protein-protein interactions (21, 22) . IFIT2 can form homodimers or stable complexes with two of its family members, IFIT1 and IFIT3 (23) (24) (25) . Mice that lack the IFIT2 gene succumb to several negative-strand RNA virus infections, and expression of IFIT2 has been reported to inhibit proliferation and migration of cancer cells as well as promote their apoptosis (24, (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) .",

The murine model of invasive candidiasis recapitulates the severe sepsis that can occur in clinical cases, resulting in a systemic hyperinflammatory response and renal failure (31) . In contrast to the effect that IFIT2 loss has on host susceptibility to viral replication, we found that loss of IFIT2 improved host survival of invasive C. albicans infection. Comparative analyses of wild-type (WT) and IFIT2 knockout (ifit2 \u03ea/\u03ea ) mice revealed that ifit2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice respond with a heightened chemokine profile, a decrease in C. albicans titer, and improved overall survival. The loss of IFIT2 also correlated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in bone marrow cells, potentially contributing to survival of C. albicans infection. This result implied a negative effect of IFIT2 on ROS production, and mechanistic evaluation identified the cytosolic regulator of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase, p67 phox , as a binding partner of IFIT2. These findings indicate induction of IFIT2 during the host response to systemic C. albicans infection contributes to increased disease severity.",

To determine the role of IFIT2 during C. albicans infection, we generated mice that lack expression of the IFIT2 gene with the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) Repository. The gene targeting scheme and expression of IFIT2 in ifit2 \u03e9/\u03e9 (WT), ifit2 \u03e9/\u03ea , or ifit2 \u03ea/\u03ea (knockout [KO]) mice are shown in Fig. S1 in the supplemental material. Previous studies with an independently generated IFIT2 KO strain reported the mice are susceptible to viruses with a negative-sense RNA genome (26) . Likewise our IFIT2 KO strain displayed a decreased survival of infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Fig. S1 ). However, in contrast to their response to VSV, the IFIT2 KO mice had a different response to disseminated C. albicans relative to their WT counterparts (Fig. 1A) . IFIT2 KO mice receiving a bloodstream C. albicans inoculum of 2.5 \u03eb 10 5 CFU were better able to survive the infection. Ten days postinfection (p.i.), 95% of WT animals succumbed to infection, whereas nearly 50% of IFIT2 KO mice were alive. Thirty days postinfection, only 4% of WT mice were alive in contrast to 12% of the IFIT2 KO mice. Because renal insufficiency and kidney fungal burden correlate with lethality in this sepsis model, we evaluated kidneys of WT and IFIT2 KO mice (31, 38) . Measurement of C. albicans titers in mice showed a decreased fungal burden in IFIT2 KO mice in comparison to WT mice at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection (hpi) ( Fig. 1B ; see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material). Reduced kidney fungal burden in the IFIT2 KO mice appears to be predictive of survival. Western blot analyses demonstrated a clear induction of IFIT2 protein expression in WT kidneys during C. albicans infection (Fig. S2B) . Although the average kidney weights in WT and IFIT2 KO mice were similar (Fig. S2C) , fungal growth in IFIT2 KO mice was attenuated. The initial fungal burden was similar, but by 72 hpi, prior to signs of illness, the kidneys from IFIT2 KO mice had significantly reduced C. albicans CFU by 10-fold (Fig. 1B) .",

Professional phagocytes express a number of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) that are stimulated in response to C. albicans, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors, and complement receptors (45, 46) . Engagement of these receptors promotes engulfment of fungal cells and microbicidal action within phagolysosomes, as well as release of antimicrobial proteins. To determine the influence of IFIT2 on C. albicans phagocytosis, we measured the ability of freshly isolated bone marrow (BM) from WT or IFIT2 KO mice to phagocytize either live or heat-killed C. albicans. Phagocytosis of living C. albicans was measured by C. albicans green fluorescent protein (CaGFP) expression (47) . BM cells were labeled with antibodies to CD45 conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC) and incubated with GFP-expressing C. albicans in the presence or absence of IFN-\u2424. Flow cytometry was used to calculate the percentage of CD45-positive cells with CaGFP fluorescence. The percentage of CD45-positive cells with CaGFP appeared significantly higher in BM samples from WT cells compared with IFIT2 KO cells, either with or without IFN-\u2424 treatment (Fig. 3B ). Since this assay did not distinguish between CaGFP-expressing cells engulfed and bound to the surface of cells, we evaluated phagocytosis of heat-killed C. albicans. Heat-killed C. albicans cells were stained with SYBR-Safe green fluorescent dye and incubated with BM cells left untreated or treated with murine IFN-\u2424. Propidium iodide was added to quench extracellular green fluorescence, and flow cytometry was used to quantify green fluores-cence per BM cell. Results indicate WT BM cells phagocytize heat-killed C. albicans more efficiently than IFIT2 KO cells following stimulation with IFN-\u2424 (Fig. 3B ). Together the results indicate the loss of IFIT2 reduces phagocytosis of C. albicans.",

Superoxide is converted into other damaging ROS, including hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid. The importance of NADPH oxidase in fungal killing is evident in chronic granulomatous disease in which NADPH oxidase deficiency leads to susceptibility to recurrent fungal and bacterial infections (51) . To evaluate the influence of IFIT2 on ROS production, we used the cell-permeable probe, 2=,7=-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) (52). Oxida- Propidium iodide was used to quench extracellular fluorescence, and mean fluorescence of phagocytized C. albicans was quantified by flow cytometry.

NADPH oxidases are a family of enzyme complexes, and the phagocytic NADPH oxidase has been designated NOX2, or gp91 phox (49, 50, 53) . NOX2 associates with p22 phox in plasma membranes, phagosomal membranes, and membranes of other intracellular vesicles. It is regulated by recruitment of cytosolic subunits p40 phox , p47 phox , and p67 phox and the Rac GTPase. Since the loss of IFIT2 resulted in increased ROS production, the inference was that IFIT2 may inhibit the activity of NOX2. To determine if IFIT2 interacts with the NOX subunits, we expressed hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged human NOX subunits in cells with V5-tagged human IFIT2 and evaluated their association in immunocomplexes. Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged NOX subunits identified specific association of IFIT2-V5 with p67 phox by Western blots (Fig. 4A) . We also demonstrated physical association of the murine IFIT2 with murine p67 phox in immunocomplexes (Fig. 4B) .

To determine if the neutrophil or macrophage population is influenced by IFIT2, we tested depletion of these phagocytic subsets during infection of WT or IFIT2 KO mice. Anti-Ly6G antibody was administered to mice 24 h prior to infection with C. albicans to deplete the hematopoietic population of neutrophils. Neutrophil-depleted mice displayed accelerated behavioral signs of infection, and for this reason kidney fungal burden was measured at 48 hpi. The C. albicans titer was higher in both infected WT and IFIT2 KO animals treated with Ly6G antibody compared to mice lacking Ly6G treatment (Fig. 5A) . A lower titer was still evident in IFIT2 KO mice compared to WT mice, indicating that although neutrophils were critical for defense against C. albicans infection, they were not responsible for the IFIT2 KO phenotype. The effectiveness of the Ly6G antibody was demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis of blood cells with Gr1 antibodies (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). To evaluate the contribution of monocytes and macrophages to the reduction of fungal burden found in infected IFIT2 KO mice, we depleted these subsets in animals by intravenous administration of clodronate liposomes. WT and IFIT2 KO mice were treated with clodronate 24 h prior to infection with C. albicans. Clodronate liposomes kill monocytes and macrophages but do not affect neutrophils (57, 58) . Both mouse strains showed accelerated behavioral changes indicative of infection as early as 24 h following infection, and for this reason, kidneys were harvested at that time to measure fungal burden. The depletion of monocytes and macrophages not only eliminated the difference in C. albicans titer between WT and IFIT2 KO mice, it resulted in a 2-fold increase of C. albicans CFU in WT mice compared to IFIT2 KO mice ( Fig. 5B; Fig. S2A ). These results indicate the loss of IFIT2 contributes to defense against C. albicans primarily by actions of monocytes and macrophages.",

IFIT2 is one of hundreds of proteins produced in response to type I/III IFNs, and yet loss of this one gene had a significant effect on survival following C. albicans infection. The result suggests that type I IFNs could be detrimental to the fight against this pathogen. To test this hypothesis, we treated WT mice with IFN-\u2424 or control (bovine serum albumin [BSA]) 24 h prior to infection with C. albicans and measured survival. Animals treated with IFN-\u2424 had significantly increased mortality (Fig. 6A) . All WT mice treated with IFN-\u2424 ",

The NADPH oxidase that is prevalent in phagocytic cells is designated gp91 phox , or NOX2, and is associated in plasma and phagocyte membranes with p22 phox (50, 53) . Activation of NOX2 occurs following the translocation and association with a cytoplasmic complex of phosphorylated p47 phox , p67 phox , p40 phox , and Rac-GTP. Since the C. albicans-infected BM cells from the IFIT2 KO mice elicited higher ROS levels than WT cells, we postulated a potential IFIT2 mechanism of action that includes binding of IFIT2 with one of the subunits of the NADPH oxidase. This was demonstrated by specific coimmunoprecipitation of IFIT2 with p67 phox , a key regulatory protein that binds Rac-GTP and NOX2 (Fig. 4) (72) . This finding suggests the possibility that IFIT2 binds to p67 phox and inhibits its ability to stimulate or associate with other subunits of the oxidase. Since NOX enzyme activity is regulated by heat shock proteins (54, 55) , we evaluated the association of heat shock proteins with IFIT2. We found IFIT2 to be a binding partner of hsc70, a constitutively expressed heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) family member with TPR motifs (73) . In addition, we demonstrated hsc70 binding to p67 phox , suggesting that IFIT2, hsc70, and p67 phox may cooperate to modulate NOX enzyme activity (54, 55) .",

Since hsc70 is known to bind TOM70, a component of the mitochondrial import machinery (74, 75) , and TOM70 contains TPR motifs, we tested the interaction of IFIT2 and TOM70. Specific coimmunoprecipitation indicated IFIT2 also associates with TOM70 (Fig. S3C ). Therefore, it is possible that IFIT2 influences ROS production by both modulation of NADPH oxidase and mitochondrial protein import, especially since the TPR motifs of IFIT2, hsc70, and TOM70 could influence their association. Invasive C. albicans infections are prevalent in patients with chronic granulomatous disease caused by mutations in phagocyte NADPH oxidase subunits and the consequent reduced ROS. The improved survival and reduced fungal burden in IFIT2 KO mice systemically infected with C. albicans may reflect protective effects of enhanced ROS production.",

In addition, although IFN-\u2424 treatment of infected mice increased pathology, in vitro, IFN-\u2424 promoted antifungal activity of BM cells. These results indicate that the complexity of immune defense in vivo during invasive C. albicans infection cannot be reproduced in vitro under the conditions described. The ROS produced in vivo may serve to destroy pathogens, but may also serve as critical signaling molecules in the activation or recruitment of cells and mediators of defense. Differential chemokine/cytokine profiles affect responses of various recruited inflammatory cells and kidney cells in the animal that are not reflected in the in vitro assay.",

To determine whether a specific phagocyte lineage is responsible for improved survival of IFIT2 KO mice, we depleted mice of either neutrophils or monocytes and macrophages prior to infection. Neutrophil depletion resulted in increased fungal burden and pathogenesis in both WT and IFIT2 KO mice, and the IFIT2 KO mice were still better able to limit C. albicans replication in comparison with WT mice (Fig. 5A ). In contrast, depletion of monocytes and macrophages with clodronate eliminated the differential ability of IFIT2 KO mice to reduce fungal burden (Fig. 5B) . The kidney titer of C. albicans in clodronate-treated mice was significantly higher in IFIT2 KO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 5B) .

Since the elimination of just one ISG (IFIT2) led to increased survival of systemic C. albicans in mice, it suggested that type I IFNs could have a generalized detrimental effect. For this reason, we determined the influence of IFN-\u2424 administration during C. albicans infection. The most common approach to investigate the role of type I IFNs in murine models of disease has been to evaluate survival and pathology of mice that lack the gene encoding IFNAR1 (50, 78) . Notably, experiments performed with systemic C. albicans infection of IFNAR1 KO mice have produced conflicting results. Studies reported IFNAR1 KO mice are either more susceptible to C. albicans infection (35, 36) or, alternatively, have increased survival of C. albicans infection (33, 34) . Since type I IFNs are administered therapeutically to patients for the treatment of viral infections, cancer, and multiple sclerosis (11), we administered IFN-\u2424 to mice and determined their response to invasive C. albicans. IFN-\u2424 treatment was found to promote pathology and death from systemic C. albicans infection (Fig. 6) . C. albicans titers in kidneys increased, and macrophage numbers in kidneys decreased with IFN-\u2424 treatment. Moreover, IFN-\u2424 treatment led to a dramatic increase in chemokine and cytokine production correlating with increased fungal burden in both WT and KO mice ( Fig. 6 and 7 ; Tables S3 and S4). However, the fungal burden was consistently lower in IFIT2 KO mice, as it was without IFN-\u2424 treatment. The difference between WT and IFIT2 KO mice did not appear to be due to different IFN levels since both groups displayed similar levels of IFN-\u2424 and IFN-\u2425 in the kidney lysates (Tables S2 and S4 ). While IFIT2 does not directly participate in regulation of IFN production, it is clearly involved in the response to IFN signaling. The moderate increase in chemokine and cytokine levels in infected IFIT2 KO mice without IFN-\u2424 administration correlated with protection; however, the dramatic boost of chemokine and cytokine production following IFN-\u2424 administration was deleterious. Proper regulation of IFN response is essential for development of a balanced immune response that is adequately strong to eliminate the pathogen but not severe enough to cause damage to the host. To our knowledge, this is the first study that directly evaluates the administration of type I IFN on the host response to C. albicans infection in a mouse model, and the results clearly caution the use of IFN therapy in patients at risk for infection.",
