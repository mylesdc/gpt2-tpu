Study objectives were to explore the vaccination status and determinants in T2DM patients in southwestern Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study on a representative sample of T2DM patients in Abha city, southwestern Saudi Arabia, was conducted. Data for sociodemographic characteristics, clinical criteria, vaccination status, vaccination motivators and barriers and seasonal influenza knowledge were collected. Out of 353 T2DM patients included in the study, seasonal influenza vaccination coverage was 61% in year 2017. A significant factors associated with non-vaccination were; poor influenza and its vaccine knowledge (OR = 4.31, 95% CI: 2.73-6.80), illiteracy (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.11-3.37), and more than 10 years disease duration (OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.11-3.87). Presence of family history of DM and ischemic heart comorbidity minimized the possibility of non-vaccination (OR = 0.54 and 0.28 respectively). Healthcare givers' advice was the most reported vaccination motivator (84.7%) while; fear of vaccine side effects was the most stated barrier (73%). In conclusion, influenza vaccination rate among T2DM in the present study is less than the recommended level. Continuous primary health care center-based educational programs should be implemented to aware and encourage influenza vaccination among T2DM patients.",

More than half of the study group, (216 (61.2%)) were currently vaccinated or intended to be vaccinated. Most of the vaccinated group were male (131 (63%)) and vaccinated before (190 (88%)). About one-fifth (75 (21%)) of participants were found previously vaccinated and reject vaccination this year, while 17.6% of participants had never been vaccinated before. No statistically significant difference was found in vaccination status by gender. Motivators and barriers for seasonal influenza vaccination in the study T2DM patients by gender are presented in Table 2 . The most frequently reported motivators of seasonal influenza vaccination among included vaccinated or willing participants were advise from healthcare givers 183 (84.7%) and subject's perception regarding the importance of vaccination (35.6%). Response to healthcare givers' advise was significantly higher among female participants (p = 0.02). As for barriers, fear of vaccine side effects and the misconception that vaccine is not important or the vaccine could cause influenza like illness were the most frequently reported barriers (73%, 50.4%, and 30.7% respectively). Fear of needle shot and misconception that vaccine is not important were more frequently reported barriers in females (p < 0.05). Absence of healthcare givers' recommendations and the difficult access to vaccine were the least reported barriers among unvaccinated group (8.8% and 0.7%). Table 3 presents the univariate analysis for the personal factors potentially associated with seasonal influenza non-vaccination in the study T2DM participants. The risk of non-vaccination was significantly increased among illiterate (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.11-3.37). On the other hand, the other personal factors were not significantly associated with non-vaccination among the study T2DM patients. The univariate analysis for personal factors associated with seasonal influenza non-vaccination in the study of T2DM patients is presented in Table 4 . The risk of non-vaccination was significantly higher among T2DM patients with above 10 years disease duration (OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.11-3.87), and having suffered from renal complications (OR = 4.15, 95% CI: 1.91-9.04). On the other hand, participants with a positive family history of diabetes (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.53-0.85) and having suffered from ischemic heart disease co-morbidity (OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.08-0.98) were more prone to be vaccinated.",
