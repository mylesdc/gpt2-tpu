            "text": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily ancient pathway that has been shown to be important in the innate immune defense against several viruses. However, little is known about the regulatory role of autophagy in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) replication. In this study, we found that TGEV infection increased the number of autophagosome-like double-and single-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of host cells, a phenomenon that is known to be related to autophagy. In addition, virus replication was required for the increased amount of the autophagosome marker protein LC3-II. Autophagic flux occurred in TGEV-infected cells, suggesting that TGEV infection triggered a complete autophagic response. When autophagy was pharmacologically inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002, TGEV replication increased. The increase in virus yield via autophagy inhibition was further confirmed by the use of siRNA duplexes, through which three proteins required for autophagy were depleted. Furthermore, TGEV replication was inhibited when autophagy was activated by rapamycin. The antiviral response of autophagy was confirmed by using siRNA to reduce the expression of gene p300, which otherwise inhibits autophagy. Together, the results indicate that TGEV infection activates autophagy and that autophagy then inhibits further TGEV replication.",

During infection, coronaviruses replicate in the host cytoplasm, where the viral genome becomes available for translation.

DMVs are usually rare in normal cells, but large numbers of double-membrane structures called autophagosomes are usually induced by activation of the cellular autophagy machinery 9 . This suggests that DMVs induced by coronavirus infection are of autophagic origin. Autophagy is not only a cellular physiological pathway for self-degradation, i.e., a pathway for removal of damaged cellular components and for the degradation of unwanted products, but is also a defense mechanism that protects hosts against infection by bacteria 10 .

Therefore, we examined LC3 conversion by western blot assay using an anti-LC3 antibody that recognizes both forms of LC3 during TGEV infection. At the same time, mAb 3D7, which specifically recognizes TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein, was used to estimate the infection progress. The results showed that the expression levels of LC3-II were upregulated in TGEV-infected ST cells relative to mock-treated cells (Fig. 2a) . Because the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I is regarded as an accurate indicator of autophagic activity 23 , we further assessed the densitometric ratios of LC3-II to LC3-I. As shown in Fig. 2b , the LC3-II to LC3-I ratio significantly increased from 24 to 30 h post infection (hpi) in TGEV-infected cells relative to controls; in addition, TGEV N protein was detected at 6 hpi and increased sharply between 24-30 hpi, which was consistent with the increase of LC3-II. By contrast, no obvious changes of the LC3-II to LC3-I ratio were observed in mock-treated cells (Fig. 2a,b) . TGEV infection-induced autophagy was also assessed using PK15 cells. As was the case with ST cells, the relative amount of LC3-II significantly increased as TGEV infection of PK15 cells progressed over time, although the rate of increase in TGEV infection were slower in PK15 cells than in ST cells (Fig. 2c,d) . Taken together, these data suggest that autophagosomes accumulated in TGEV-infected cells.",

The activation of autophagic activity by TGEV infection could be caused either by incoming virons or by viral replication products. To determine whether TGEV replication is required for the induction of autophagy, we challenged cells with either replication-competent or UV-inactivated virus and measured the effect on autophagy by monitoring the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. Before conducting the formal experiments, we used immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to verify that the UV-inactivated virus was replication defective (Fig. 3a) . By using western blot, we found that the levels of both LC3-I and LC3-II were similar in ST cells inoculated with UV-inactivated TGEV at MOI of 10 and in mock-treated ST cells at 24 h post inoculation; in addition, no N protein synthesis was detected in ST cells inoculated with UV-inactivated TGEV. In contrast, ST cells infected with replication-competent TGEV apparently underwent the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II (Fig. 3b,c) . Similar results were obtained with PK15 cells (Fig. 3b,c) , suggesting that TGEV replication is required for the formation of autophagosomes.",

Therefore, we used a western blot assay to measure the changes in p62 protein levels upon virus infection. As shown in Fig. 4a ,b, TGEV infection increased degradation of p62 in ST cells over time. There was no significant alteration of p62 between 0 h and 36 h in the mock-treated control.

RFP-LC3, in contrast, exhibits more stable fluorescence in acidic compartments, which makes the GFP-RFP-LC3 tandem construct useful for assessing autophagosome dynamics 28, 29 . Therefore, ST cells were transfected with GFP-RFP-LC3 plasmid and then were infected with TGEV before live cell imaging was used to examine the dynamics of autophagosome maturation. In TGEV-infected cells, the GFP-LC3 and RFP-LC3 puncta formed a yellow autophagosome by the 10-h frame (Fig. 5a) . Subsequently, the yellow puncta turned red, most likely as a result of the quenching of GFP-LC3 fluorescence in the acidic amphisomes or autolysosomes ( Fig. 5a & movie,",

These three genes were examined to confirm that the effects observed were due to the autophagy pathway rather than to the non-target effects of the siRNA. To deplete the proteins, we treated ST cells with siRNA duplexes for 24 h and then challenged the cells with TGEV. When cells were separately treated with each of the three siRNA duplexes, the levels of LC3, ATG5, and ATG7 mRNA were decreased in each case relative to levels in cells treated with nontargeting control siRNA (Figs 7a, 8a and 9a). Western blot analysis of detergent lysates collected from cells revealed that levels of endogenous LC3, ATG5, or ATG7 protein were significantly lower in cells treated with the siRNA duplexes than in cells treated with nontargeting control siRNA (Figs 7b, 8b and 9b). Because the data indicated that knockdown efficiency was greatest with LC3-specific siRNA duplexes 3#, ATG5-specific siRNA duplexes 1#, and ATG7-specific siRNA duplexes 2#, these specific siRNA duplexes were used in the following experiments. Following the knockdown of each autophagy-related gene with these gene-specific siRNA duplexes, we observed an increase in the percentage of TGEV-infected cells in comparison to the nontargeting control siRNA (Figs 7c, 8c and 9c). We also found that autophagic protein depletion led to increased viral titers (Figs 7d, 8d and 9d) . Together, the data demonstrate that inhibition of autophagy promotes TGEV replication. Induction of autophagy by rapamycin reduces viral replication. To confirm that autophagy inhibits TGEV infection, we treated ST cells with rapamycin, which induces autophagy by blocking the mammalian target of the rapamycin pathway 34, 35 . As shown in Fig. 10a , rapamycin treatment increased the amounts of LC3-II in TGEV-infected ST cells, indicating that autophagy is upregulated by rapamycin in virus-infected cells. Using IFA, we observed that the percentage of TGEV-infected cells was lower in the rapamycin-treated cells than in nontreated cells (Fig. 10b) . Viral yields were also lower in rapamycin-treated cells than in nontreated cells (Fig. 10c) . These observations suggest that autophagy restricts TGEV replication and reduces viral yields, which is consistent with the results of our autophagy inhibition assays.",

To confirm that the results we obtained with rapamycin reflected autophagy induction rather than other processes, we determined whether depletion of endogenous acetyltransferase p300 by siRNA also affects TGEV infection. Previous research demonstrated that acetyltransferase p300 can degrade LC3, ATG5, and ATG7 by post-translational modifications in Hela cells, and that knockdown of p300 can accelerate autophagy 36 . We treated ST cells with p300 siRNA duplexes for 24 h and then infected them with TGEV. As shown in Fig. 11a , p300 siRNA-transfected ST cells had decreased levels of the endogenous acetyltransferase p300 protein and increased levels of LC3-II, ATG5, and ATG7 proteins, suggesting that p300 negatively regulates autophagy in ST cells. In addition, knockdown efficiency was greater for p300 siRNA duplexes 2# than for the other duplexes, (b,e) Immunofluorescence assay to detect TGEV with mAb 3D7. Cells were treated with control or autophagy inhibitors for 4 h indicated, followed by infection with TGEV H165 at MOI of 1. At 24 h after infection, cell monolayer was stained for TGEV N protein expression and nuclei counterstained. The percentage of TGEVinfected cells per view from three independent experiments is expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. (c,f) TGEV titers on ST cells treated with wortmannin, LY294002, or control. The progeny virus titers were calculated and expressed as TCID 50 per 0.1 ml. Results represent the mean \u00b1 SD for three independent experiments. *p < 0.05. The p value is calculated using Student's t-test. Gels were run under the same experimental conditions. For better clarity and conciseness of the presentation, cropped blots are shown. The raw uncropped images can be found in the Supplementary Fig. S4 . and p300 siRNA duplexes 2# was therefore used for further study. Using IFA, we found that the percentage of TGEV-positive cells was lower in cells treated with the p300 siRNA duplexes 2# than in cells treated with nontargeting control siRNA (Fig. 11b) . The reduction in viral replication determined by IFA was verified by measuring the TCID 50 (Fig. 11c) . Overall, these results demonstrate that autophagy plays an antiviral role during TGEV infection.",

Although this virus was identified 30 years ago 43 , the interactions between TGEV replication and host cell responses are incompletely understood. Previous studies revealed that infection by several other coronaviruses, including MHV, SARS-CoV, IBV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, induced the formation of DMVs 6, 18, [44] [45] [46] [47] . In the present study, TEM revealed that the formation of DMVs, which is a hallmark of coronavirus replication, was greatly induced in both ST and PK15 cells during TGEV infection. The presence of DMVs suggested that this virus might induce the accumulation of autophagic vesicles in TGEV-infected cells. Using immunoblotting to evaluate LC3 modification, we then confirmed that the induction of DMVs by TGEV infection was related to the autophagic process. Additionally, we found that viral replication is required in TGEV-induced autophagy. Although DMVs exist in the TGEV-infected cells, we did not know whether this alphacoronavirus species, like betacoronavirus species, hijacks the autophagosome machinery to facilitate virus replication 46 . Further work is needed to conclusively answer this question. Nevertheless, our findings clearly demonstrate that TGEV infection induces the accumulation of autophagosomes in target cells, and that the TGEV replication process is required for the induction of autophagic activity.",

These observations suggest that replication mechanisms may differ among viruses of the same family and even of the same species; these differences may be related to differences in cell-type specificity or in mechanisms of infection. Therefore, to determine whether the induction of autophagy is an anti-TGEV response, we examined the effect of controlled autophagosomal activation on virus replication.

Lee and Finkel found that acetyltransferase p300 is involved in the acetylation of several known components of the autophagy machinery, including ATG5, ATG7, ATG8 (LC3), and ATG12; acetyltransferase p300 degrades these autophagy-dependent proteins and inhibits autophagosome formation under starved conditions 36 . In addition, Huang et al. reported that TGEV infection downregulates acetyltransferase p300 expression and increases cell apoptosis 59 , suggesting that acetyltransferase p300 is regulated upon TGEV infection. When we knocked down the endogenous p300 in ST cells with specific siRNA duplexes, autophagy was induced, which is consistent with previous findings 36 , and TGEV replication was reduced. These data indicate that induction of autophagy restricts viral replication. Based on these results, we conclude that autophagy has an antiviral rather than a proviral role in TGEV infection, although the detailed interplay between the autophagic machinery and TGEV and other viruses remains incompletely understood.",

Here, we demonstrate for the first time that TGEV infection triggers the formation of autophagosomes. Down-regulation of the autophagy signal pathway increases viral replication, and up-regulation of the autophagic process reduces viral replication. In addition, the involvement of acetyltransferase p300 in the regulation of TGEV replication is reported for the first time. The antiviral pathway identified in this study may play a role in the control of other infectious agents. Finally, pharmacological modulation of the autophagic pathway should be explored as a means to inhibit viral replication.",
