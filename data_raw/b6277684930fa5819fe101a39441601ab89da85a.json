            "text": "Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a member of the genus Bocavirus, family Parvoviridae, and subfamily Parvovirus and was first identified in nasopharyngeal aspirates of Swedish children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in 2005. It is the causative agent of nasopharyngeal aspirate disease and death in children. The HboV genomic structure is a linear single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Its clinical pathogenic characteristics have been extensively studied, however, at present the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of HBoV infection is not completely clear. In this study, a total of 293 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between ARTI cases and healthy plasma samples were characterized using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-coupled bioinformatics analysis, among which 148 were up-regulated and 135 were down-regulated. Gene Ontology (GO) and Cluster of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) annotated an enrichment of DEPs in complement activation and biological processes like immunity, inflammation, signal transduction, substance synthesis, and metabolism. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis enriched DEPs mainly in the Wnt signaling pathway (ko04310), PPAR signaling pathway (ko03320), intestinal immune network for IgA production (ko04672), complement and coagulation cascades (ko04610), Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (ko04620) and B cell receptor signaling pathway (ko04662). Further, expression levels of three candidate proteins (upregulated PPP2R1A and CUL1, and downregulated CETP) were validated using western blotting. Our investigation is the first analysis of the proteomic profile of HBoV-infected ARTI cases using the iTRAQ approach, providing a foundation for a better molecular understanding of the pathogenesis of ARTI in children.

Since HBoV was first detected in 2005 in children with respiratory infections [1], four different subtypes have been identified (HBoV 1, 2, 3, and 4) [6-8]. HBoV-1 was predominantly detected in the respiratory tract, whereas the three other types (HBoV-2, HBoV-3, and HBoV-4) were mainly identified in stool and associated with gastroenteritis [8]. However, HBoV can also found in asymptomatic people [9] . A genomic study of HBoV suggested a rearrangement of the HBoV group into two classes: human bocaparvovirus 1 (including the previous HBoV-1 and HBoV-3) and human bocaparvovirus 2 (including the previous HBoV-2 and HBoV-4) [10] .",

HBoV is transmitted around the year but infections are enriched during winter and spring [12] . The prevalence of HBoV-1 ranged from 1.5 to 19% in children diagnosed with acute respiratory diseases [13] , whereas the prevalence of the three other types ranged from 1% to 26%, 0.4% to 5%, and 0% to 2% in fecal samples from subjects with gastrointestinal illnesses, respectively [14, 15] . Clinical symptoms in HBoV-infected patients include rhinitis, pharyngitis, cough, dyspnea, wheezing, pneumonia, acute otitis media, fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea [9]. The coinfection rates of cases with respiratory infections and HBoV-positivity ranges from 8.3% to 100%, and the coinfection ratio is 46.7% relative to gastrointestinal manifestations [16] .

(2018) reported that in 810 nasal swabs and 317 fecal specimens from up to 5-year old children with influenza-like illness or diarrhea in Gabon, 32 (4.4%) and 7 (2.2%) were positive for HBoV [17] . Further, coinfections ratio with at least one other respiratory virus, or intestinal viruses were 84.4% and 42.8%, respectively.",

Therefore, the development of diagnostic markers for infectious diseases will facilitate more rapid diagnosis and the distinction between infection and non-infectious diseases, leading to improved management, better treatment course and outcomes, and a reduction in the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Proteomics provides for a comprehensive global analysis and is widely used to investigate complex biological functions [18] for identification and characterization of proteins related to pathogenesis and virus-host interactions, contributing to new knowledge of the pathogenesis of various diseases. Twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-timeof-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) are widely applied to study the proteomic expression profiles of host cells responding to viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome [19], H1N1 influenza virus [20], and spleen and kidney necrosis virus [21] . However, 2DE has certain distinct disadvantages, including the ability to identify only a limited number of proteins within a sample and its insensitivity to small and low-abundance proteins. Isobaric tags for the relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) along with nano liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (NanoLC-MS/MS) has emerged as a more powerful quantitative proteomic method because of its high sensitivity and reproducibility, particularly for quantifying low-abundance proteins in the examined samples [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

A deep knowledge of pathogenesis of HBoV is essential for the prevention and treatment of HBoV. Currently, iTRAQbased proteomics have been widely applied to study differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of virus-host interactions for understanding the host response to viral infection [22, 24, 25] . In the present study, iTRAQ coupled with LC-MS/MS was used to detect and characterize differentially expressed proteins in the plasma of the respiratory tract in patients infected with HBoV and healthy controls.

            "text": "From the standpoint of host cell proteins, interactions between a virus and its host are highly complicated processes, frequently resulting in abundant alterations in the expression of signaling pathway proteins [26] . A set of proteomic approaches have been widely used to investigate viral-host interactions [22, 24, 25, 27, 28] for a better understanding of pathogenesis. In the present study, we performed iTRAQ combined with LC-MS/MS analysis in the plasma of respiratory tract patients infected with HBoV. In total, 1048 proteins were determined, of which 148 DEPs were significantly upregulated and 135 downregulated. We then validated three candidate proteins by western blotting analysis, which supported our iTRAQ results. These DEPs were associated with a lot of biological processes such as complement activation and biological processes including immunity, inflammation, signal transduction and regulation, substance synthesis, metabolism metabolic pathways, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum and protein turnover mediated by the proteasome. They were enriched the in Wnt signaling pathway (ko04310), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway (ko03320), intestinal immune network for IgA production (ko04672), complement and coagulation cascades (ko04610), Toll-like receptor(TLR) signaling pathway (ko04620), and B cell receptor signaling pathway (ko04662) (S1 File). The profiles of the present study provide a foundation for the development of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic schemes, and the identified DEPs provide novel insight into the potential pathological mechanism elucidating HBoV infection. PPP2R1A (Protein Phosphatase 2, Regulatory Subunit A Alpha), belonging to the PPP family of phosphatases, is participated in negative regulation of a variety of vital cellular processes such as cell growth and division. Cullin 1 (CUL1) is a human protein from cullin family, and acts an important role in protein degradation and protein ubiquitination. Both PPP2R1A and CUL1 belong to immune response genes [29] , and play a crucial role in various cellular activities during HBoV infection as a host restriction factor to suppress transcription in astrocytes. In the present study, viral-related proteins PPP2R1A and CUL1 were unregulated to modulate the Wnt signaling pathway (ko04310) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway(ko04350) (S1 File), consistent with previous results [29] [30] [31] . Wysocki et al. (2012) discovered upregulated PPP2R1A during PRRSV infection [29] . CUL1 was upregulated to modulate cell multiplication, migration, invasion and metastasis [30, 31] . Wnt signaling pathway is a critical pathway in cell cycle control, whereas TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway plays a critical role in cell signaling regulation of multiple vital processes including multiplication, discrimination, apoptosis, EMT, and migration. TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway was demonstrated to being a doubtful advantage in normal and pathogenic development, especially in organ fibrosis, vascular disorders, and carcinoma. Previous studies reported the dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway during pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection [24] and the enhanced influenza virus mRNA and virus production by triggering Wnt pathway [32] . The reaction to EBOV infection was regulated by TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway [33] , and the improved secretion of TGF-\u03b21 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in EBOV-infected cells were improved by temporally upregulating TGF-\u03b2-modulated signaling responses. TGF-\u03b2 that is secreted from host cells is a latent and non-acting complex, and triggered by the neuraminidase (NA) of influenza A virus to modulate its signaling function [34] . The quantity of active TGF-\u03b2 was increased in the culture medium, and partial cells with high quantity of the integrin subunit \u03b15 and fibronectin infected by influenza A [35] . Particularly compared with binding to mannose the adhesion of bacteria to fibronectin was also improved [35] . TGF-\u03b2 signaling was interfered with viruses in many ways, such as adjustment of TGF-\u03b2 protein expression and TGF-\u03b2 receptors or SMADs factors. Further study is needed to elucidate TGF-\u03b2-regulated mechanism in interfering with HBoV infection.",

Cellular growth control was affected by mass protein degradation with proteasome to cause aberrant cell cycle progression, transcription, DNA repair, apoptosis, and angiogenesis [37] . Proteasome is functioned as a crucial element in the reproduction of many viruses, and in antiviral immune defenses [38] . Proteasome-dependent, ubiquitin-independent degradation is highly observed during viral infections. In the present study, 18 DEPs were enriched in proteasome function catergory. Interestingly, all of the 18 proteins were upregulated. Among them, CUL1 was involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (ko04120) (S1 File). Ubiquitin molecules altered covalently substrates targeted by that proteasome [16] . As a 76 amino acid protein ubiquitin covalently linked to substrates at N-terminal or lysine residues through its C-terminal amino acid and then added ubiquitin molecules to one of seven lysine residues for assembling ubiquitin chains. Polyubiquitin chains were affixed the targeted substrates to the proteasome by direct interplay between Rpn13 and Rpn10 subunits of the 19S RP [39] in leading covalently marked proteins for proteasomal degradation. Further study is needed to elucidate potential functions of these upregulated DEPs during HBoV infection. Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) is a glycoprotein connecting to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in blood and engaging in the movement of neutral lipids such as cholesteryl ester and triglyceride amongst lipoprotein particles. Biological function of CETP is not fully understood, however, CETP is involved in regulation of PPARs signaling pathway (ko03320) and TLRs signaling pathway (ko04620), thus playing key anti-inflammatory roles for protein family including bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI). Germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) regulates the host intrinsic immune system for intrinsically defensing pathogen attacks PRRs were demonstrated to distinguish host segments from pathogens through identification of conserved regions within a group of pathogens to activate signaling cascades for terminating the expression of antimicrobial products, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines [40] . Among three families of PPRs (TLRs, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and nucleotide binding-oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) [41] , TLRs act as essential molecules of the host intrinsic immune system to sense the conserved molecular signatures within a group of pathogens and trigger intrinsic immune responses to pathogen attacks. Numerous TLRs were proven to involve in the early interaction between host cells and attacking pathogens in coordination with viral reproduction and/or host responses to finally affect viral pathogenesis. Pathogens have developed approaches for escaping or defecting signaling through the TLR pathways for survival and replication. PPARs belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily including PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 and PPAR\u03b3, and critically regulate cellular differentiation and development, metabolism, and tumorigenesis [42] . The expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, maintenance of metabolic homeostasis, and inflammation was modulated by heterodimers of PPARs-retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers to induce anticancer impacts in various tumors. PPAR activity was transcriptionally regulated by nongenomic cross-talking with phosphatases and kinases such as ERK1/2, p38-MAPK, protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3). In the present study, CETP was downregulated during HBoV infection, potentially representing a novel pharmacological target for HBoV treatment.",

ER was poisoned by a protracted enormous increasing of free calcium levels in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, leading to the severe form of stress on traget cells. Therefore, ER dysfunction was mainly caused by toxic accident that generated in the pathogenic development to block vital ER responses or ER calcium pool has been confirmed being one of the principal targets of toxic metabolites or intermediates such as oxygen free radicals produced during the pathogenesis of acute disorders and degenerative diseases. ER dysfunction was mainly caused by toxic intermediates generated in pathogenic development to block vital ER reactions or fully activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). The entire UPR plays an essential role in regulation of x-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) function as a transcription factor during ER stress. However, the reaction to ER stress is blocked when XBP1 protein synthesis is interrupted to certain level. ER stress is further aggravated by triggering ER-(ERAD) to deteriorate unfolded proteins through the ubiquitin/proteasomal pathway that is defective in acute disorders and degenerative diseases. In the present study, 10 DEPs participated in protein processing in the ER, consistent with the results of previous studies [45, 46] , which revealed facilitation of viral replication by ER alternations and activation of the unfolded protein response with viral infections. Interestingly, all of the 10 proteins were upregulated, including the heat shock proteins 71 kDa, 105 kDa (hsph1), and hsp90-alpha and beta-1(S1 File). Heat-shock response activation was thought to play a virus-specific function assuring appropriate protein synthesis by facilitating protein folding. Previous studies confirmed the involvement of Hsp90 in the assembly and nuclear transfer of viral RNA polymerase subunits and facilitation of viral replication in various virus including HIV-1 [47] , ebola virus [48] and rotavirus [49] . Therefore, Hsp90 might be a potential target inhibitor for preventing viral infections [50] . Other upregulated ER-stress proteins including calreticulin and calnexin important for calcium storage and protein folding [51] were shown to act crucial role in viral infections [52, 53] . Further study is needed to elucidate the functions of these proteins in preventing HBoV infection.",

In total, 293 proteins were significantly altered, among which 148 were upregulated and 135 were downregulated. These preliminarily proteomic results are needed for further validation to confirm the functional roles of these proteins in the pathogenesis of HBoV, thereby enabling novel antiviral therapeutic targets of HBoV infection.
