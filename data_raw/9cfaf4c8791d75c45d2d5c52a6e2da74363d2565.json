Viral CRI with HSV, CMV, or both occurred in 28 patients (33.3%). Fungal (16.7%) and other CRIs (7.1%) were less common. Many patients required mechanical ventilation (54%) and vasopressor support (36%). Overall in-hospital mortality was high (23.2%) and readmissions were common with several patients re-hospitalized within 30 (21.1%) and 90 days (36.7%) of discharge. Predictors of in-hospital mortality on multivariate regression included severity of illness factors, stem-cell transplant, and identification of multiple respiratory viruses. In conclusion, hospital mortality is high among adult patients with viral pneumonia and patients with multiple respiratory viruses identified may be at a higher risk.

The long history of bacterial infections occurring concurrently or shortly after influenza illness dates back to the 1918 influenza pandemic in which most of the fatal cases were found to be due to co-infection based on autopsy findings. 5 More recently the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was complicated by bacterial pneumonia in 4% to 33% of hospitalized or critically ill patients. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Most commonly isolated co-infecting bacterial organisms with influenza are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. pyogenes, and Haemophilus influenzae. Influenza seasons are not equal as some are associated with lower mortality potentially related to differences in virulence factors or other unknown reasons. [12] [13] [14] [15] Bacterial co-infection is not limited to influenza and has been described with numerous other respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), rhinovirus, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Advanced technologies have allowed for increased recognition of viral pathogens and diagnoses of viral respiratory infections including pneumonia. 26 Several mechanisms by which viral respiratory infections may predispose patients to bacterial co-infections have been investigated including virus-induced alterations in epithelial cells, impaired immune response, and enhanced bacterial colonization. 27 Utilizing new diagnostic technologies, it may be possible to better describe the clinical aspects of viral pneumonia and interactions with other infecting organisms. The purpose of this study was to describe hospitalized adult patients with viral pneumonia including possible co-infections and clinical outcomes. ",

Candida spp. isolated from respiratory specimens were excluded from RCI consideration. Immunocompromised status was defined as a diagnosis of HIV, active malignancy (stem cell transplant or receiving chemotherapy), solid organ transplant, or currently receiving immunosuppressive therapy (prednisone 20 mg/day for at least 30 days or equivalent). Determination of APACHE II scores was based on physical and laboratory findings on the day the index RVP was obtained.

In our study, severity of illness characteristics were identified as being the primary factors associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with viral pneumonia. Interestingly, identification of multiple respiratory viruses was also associated with increased mortality. A potential explanation for this finding is that host characteristics enabling infection of multiple respiratory viruses may lead to worse outcomes. This finding may be a surrogate marker for immunocompromise or debilitation status of such patients and thus, their increased risk of death. However, it is also possible that coinfection with multiple viruses leads to a more pathogenic or detrimental respiratory process. Bacterial co-infection was not found to be associated with in-hospital mortality in this study. Choi et al previously found no difference in 28-day mortality between ICU patients with severe bacterial or viral pneumonia at 25.5% and 26.5%, respectively. 30 There was no pure bacterial pneumonia comparator group in our study and so no direct comparison in outcomes can be made between viral and bacterial pneumonia. Our results do suggest that clinical outcomes of viral pneumonia may not be substantially impacted by the presence of coinfecting bacteria. However, antibacterial therapy in this population was not thoroughly evaluated for appropriateness which would likely impact clinical outcomes of patients with a bacterial RCI.",

Our study was not limited to community-acquired infections which may account for this disparity; however, other studies have also reported lower rates of bacterial co-infection. 29, 30 Additionally, it is unlikely that a higher incidence of healthcare-related infections would explain the lower rates of bacterial co-infection observed.",

Furthermore, antibacterial administration before respiratory culture obtainment was not evaluated and could have impacted rates of bacterial RCI seen. Second, patients transferred from an outside hospital may have had additional infectious processes identified by cultures taken outside of our hospital system. In such cases, co-infections may have been missed and falsely decreased the rates observed. Third, viral shedding may occur for several days to weeks after initial respiratory virus infection especially among immunocompromised patients. Our study classified viral pneumonia based on the index RVP report date and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. It is possible that for some patients the initial viral infection had occurred days before identification by RVP and that a concomitant process was detected on imaging. In this case, more bacterial RCIs would be classified as subsequent infections. Fourth, all cases in this study occurred in a 20-month period at a single institution. Viral epidemiology at this site and during this timeframe may not be representative of all seasons and locations. Finally, due to the constraints of the RVP used, we may have not identified all possible viral infections such as bocavirus.",

This study describes hospitalized adult patients with viral pneumonia and factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Identification of multiple respiratory viruses and several factors describing severity of illness were associated with in-hospital mortality in a multivariate model. Recognition of multiple viruses as a poor prognostic indicator is of interest. With increased ability to recognize viral pathogens, this finding could simply be the result of improved diagnostics. However, it may also be indicative of host factors allowing for simultaneous infection by multiple respiratory viruses. In this study, only 16.9% of patients with viral pneumonia had a bacterial RCI. Use of antibacterials in this setting was not evaluated, but future research should focus on the role of empiric antibacterial use in patients with only viral infection identified. Additionally, procalcitonin has been shown to be useful in differentiating viral infections from bacterial and could prove useful in conjunction with identification of a respiratory virus in this population. 4, 31, 32 In conclusion, this study adds to the growing body of literature regarding the epidemiology of viral pneumonia in adult patients and illustrates the high morbidity and mortality associated with viral pneumonia in adult patients. Additionally, this study suggests that identification of multiple infecting respiratory viruses is a negative prognostic indicator as illustrated by its association with in-hospital mortality. Continued advances in diagnostic technology have enabled more thorough evaluation of respiratory infections. Further investigation into the role viruses play in pneumonia may unclose more answers regarding patient risk factors for and outcomes of viral pneumonia.",

The study protocol was approved by the Barnes-Jewish Hospital, Washington University and St. Louis College of Pharmacy Institutional Review Boards. Adult patients (!19 years of age) admitted to the hospital for >24 h were identified through a query of an internal database, which tracks respiratory viruses and evaluated for study inclusion. Patients were excluded if no virus was identified by RVP, rhinovirus or enterovirus was identified by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab only, or if a respiratory virus had been identified within the 90 days before the index RVP. The FilmArray 1 respiratory panel assay (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT) is a multiplex nucleic acid test capable of simultaneous qualitative detection and identification of multiple respiratory viral and bacterial nucleic acids. This panel became the primary diagnostic RVP used at BJH in March of 2013 and is capable of detecting 20 total respiratory pathogens (17 viral and 3 bacterial): Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophilapneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Adenovirus, Coronavirus HKU1, Coronavirus NL63, Coronavirus 229E, Coronavirus OC43, Influenza A, Influenza A subtype H1, Influenza A subtype H3, Influenza A subtype 2009 H1, Influenza B, hMPV, PIV 1, PIV 2, PIV 3, PIV 4, RSV, and rhinovirus/ enterovirus.
