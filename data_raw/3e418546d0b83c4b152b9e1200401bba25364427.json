            "text": "To replicate, viruses must gain access to the host cell's resources. Interferon (IFN) regulates the actions of a large complement of interferon effector genes (IEGs) that prevent viral replication. The interferon inducible transmembrane protein family members, IFITM1, 2 and 3, are IEGs required for inhibition of influenza A virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus replication in vitro. Here we report that IFN prevents emergence of viral genomes from the endosomal pathway, and that IFITM3 is both necessary and sufficient for this function. Notably, viral pseudoparticles were inhibited from transferring their contents into the host cell cytosol by IFN, and IFITM3 was required and sufficient for this action. We further demonstrate that IFN expands Rab7 and LAMP1-containing structures, and that IFITM3 overexpression is sufficient for this phenotype. Moreover, IFITM3 partially resides in late endosomal and lysosomal structures, placing it in the path of invading viruses. Collectively our data are consistent with the prediction that viruses that fuse in the late endosomes or lysosomes are vulnerable to IFITM3's actions, while viruses that enter at the cell surface or in the early endosomes may avoid inhibition. Multiple viruses enter host cells through the late endocytic pathway, and many of these invaders are attenuated by IFN. Therefore these findings are likely to have significance for the intrinsic immune system's neutralization of a diverse array of threats.",

The most effective means of protection against influenza is the seasonal vaccine. However, if the vaccine does not match the viral strains, its effectiveness can be reduced to 50% or less [1, 2] . Among small molecules, only two approved influenza drugs remain effective, zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Although resistance to zanamivir is rare, there has been an increase in oseltamivir-resistant flu strains [3] . Of concern, both drugs target viral neuraminidase (NA), precluding combinatorial therapy to minimize resistance [4, 5] . Thus, research to identify new anti-influenza strategies would be useful.",

Influenza A virus infection initiates with the cleavage and activation of the viral hemaglutinnin (HA) envelope receptor by host proteases [6, 7, 8, 9] . HA then binds to sialylated proteins on the cell surface, eliciting endocytosis of the viral particle. Endocytosed viruses are transported through the early and late endosomes, with late endosomal acidification triggering a conformational change in HA which results in viral-host membrane fusion [6, 10] . Fusion transitions from a hemifusion intermediate into a fusion pore through which the virus' eight viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) enter the cytosol. The vRNPs are subsequently guided by the host cell's karyopherins into the nucleus [11, 12, 13] , wherein the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase synthesizes viral genomes (vRNA) and mRNAs, both of which are exported to the cytosol, culminating in the production of viral progeny.",

Using such a genetic screen, we identified the IFITM protein family members IFITM1, 2 and 3 as antiviral factors capable of blocking influenza A viruses [14] . We further tested the antiviral activity of IFITM3 protein using the seasonal influenza A strains, A/Uruguay/716/07 (H3N2) and A/Brisbane/59/07 (H1N1), and found similar levels of IFITM3mediated viral inhibition [14] . IFITM3 accounts for a significant portion (50-80%) of IFN's (type I or II) ability to decrease influenza A virus infection in vitro, and IFITM3 resides in vesicular compartments that are IFN-inducible [14] . In addition, the IFITM family inhibits infection by the flaviviruses, dengue virus and West Nile virus [14, 18] , as well as the filoviruses, Ebola and Marburg, and the SARS coronavirus [19] . The IFITM proteins also block vesicular stomatitis virus-G protein (VSV-G)-mediated entry, but do not substantially alter the replication of Moloney leukemia virus (MLV), several arena viruses, or hepatitis C virus (HCV, [14, 20] ).",

The IFITM1, 2, 3 and 5 genes are clustered on chromosome 11, and all encode for proteins containing two transmembrane domains (TM1 and 2), separated by a conserved intracellular loop (CIL, [22] ), with both termini extra-cellular or intra-vesicular [24, 25] . TM1 and the CIL are well conserved between the IFITM proteins and a large group of proteins representing the CD225 protein family. CD225 family members exist from bacteria (125 members) to man (13 members, with 156 members in chordata), with no in depth functional data available for any member other than the IFITM proteins. IFITM1, 2 and 3 are present across a wide range of species including amphibians, fish, fowl and mammals. The IFITM proteins have been described to have roles in immune cell signaling and adhesion, cancer, germ cell physiology, and bone mineralization [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30] . IFITM3 expression can inhibit the growth of some IFN-responsive cancer cells [31] . Genetic evidence also points to IFITM5/Bril being required for early bone mineralization [30, 32] . IfitmDel mice, which are null for all five of the murine Ifitm genes, display a 30% perinatal mortality among null pups, but thereafter grow and develop normally in a controlled setting [26] . However, cells derived from these IfitmDel mice are more susceptible to influenza A virus infection in vitro [14] . IFITM3 inhibited infection by all influenza A virus strains tested including a 1968 pandemic isolate and two contemporary seasonal vaccine viruses [14] . We have found IFITM3 to be the most potent of the IFITM protein family members in decreasing influenza A virus replication [14] .",

In support of this notion, recent work demonstrated that IFITM protein overexpression did not prevent influenza A virions from accessing acidified compartments [19] . Consistent with its acting on endocytosed viruses, a portion of IFITM3 resides in structures that contain host cell endosomal and lysosomal proteins [19] .

Consistent with previous studies, we find that IFITM3 inhibits influenza A viral infection after viral-host binding and endocytosis, but prior to primary viral transcription [19, 20] . Moreover, using a combination of assays, we find that either IFN or high levels of IFITM3 impede influenza A viruses from transferring their contents into the host cell cytosol, and that IFITM3 is necessary for this IFN-mediated action. Therefore, we conclude that IFN is acting predominantly through IFITM3 to block viral fusion. We also find that IFN expands the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments, and that IFITM3 overexpression is sufficient for this phenotype. This study also presents data showing that IFITM3 overexpression leads to the expansion of enlarged acidified compartments consisting of lysosomes and autolysosomes. Interestingly, we observe that viruses trapped in the endocytic pathway of IFITM3-overexpressing cells are trafficked to these expanded acidified compartments. Based on these results and those of others [19, 20] , we present a model whereby IFN acts via IFITM3 to prevent viral fusion, thereby directing endocytosed viruses to lysosomes and autolysosomes, for subsequent destruction. Collectively this study expands our understanding of how IFITM3 restricts a growing number of viruses by exploiting a shared viral vulnerability arising from their use of the host's endocytic pathway.",

We found that interferon prevents influenza A virus from entering our cells by blocking the virus' fusion with the cellular membrane. Furthermore, we learned that IFITM3 is required for this antiviral action of interferon, and that high levels of IFITM3 alone can produce a similar viral inhibition.

            "text": "In contrast, we observed decreased nuclear and increased cytosolic NP staining in the IFITM3 cells (Fig. 2, S2C) . Moreover, in the IFITM3 cells greater than 60% of the cytosolic NP colocalized with Lysotracker Red (LTRed), a dye which marks acidic cellular compartments (late endosomes, lysosomes, pH#5.5), and which was added to the warm media at time zero (Fig. S2A, D) . The increased NP in the cytosol of the IFITM3 cells likely arises in part from an increase in the local concentration of viruses because a-NP Western blots (after trypsinizing the cells to remove adherent NP) did not show substantial differences in internalized NP levels between cell lines for up to 90 min post infection (p.i., data not shown). Because IFITM3 is required for the anti-viral actions of IFN in vitro [14] , we performed a companion experiment with the WI-38 cells treated with IFN-a ( Fig. 2B ). IFN-a treatment also decreased NP nuclear staining in the WI-38-Vector cells, however this block was not as complete nor was it associated with similar levels of cytosolic NP staining as those seen with high levels of IFITM3. Consistent with the gain-offunction data, the depletion of IFITM3 decreased IFN's ability to block vRNP trafficking to the nucleus ( Fig. 2A and B , compare top and bottom rows).",

It is important to note that the levels of IFITM3 protein in the A549-IFITM3 cells are higher than those seen after treatment with IFN-a or -c (Fig. S3C) . However, we have not observed that other overexpressed proteins have either protected against viral infection or expanded the lysosome/autolysosome compartment (data not shown), arguing that this is a specific effect. To better assess the expanded LTRed compartments observed with IFITM3 overexpression, we created MDCK cells stably expressing the lysosomal protein, LAMP1, fused to a red fluorescence protein (LAMP1-RFP) and IFITM3. As compared . IFN prevents vRNP nuclear entry, and IFITM3 is necessary and sufficient for this action.

Similar levels of retained cytosolic vRNPs were observed in experiments without LTRed (data not shown). Interestingly, we observed the loss of the vRNA signal in the acidic inclusions of the MDCK-IFITM3 cells between 80 and 240 min. p.i. (Fig. 3B ).

            "text": "We next evaluated vRNP translocation in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from animals that have had all five Ifitm genes deleted (IfitmDel2/2, [14, 26] ). Compared to wild-type (WT) matched litter mate controls, the IfitmDel2/2 MEFs displayed 5-10 fold more nuclear NP staining, with or without IFN-c treatment (Fig. 4, S6C) . IFN-mediated viral restriction was restored when we transduced the null MEFs with a retrovirus expressing Ifitm3 (IfitmDel2/2 Ifitm3, Fig. S6 ). Similar to what was observed with the IFITM3 overexpressing cell lines, the majority of the vRNP signal in the IFN-c-treated WT and Ifitm3rescued cells localized to acidic compartments (red, Fig. S6B ). An increase in acidic compartments occurred after IFN-c treatment with either the WT or the IfitmDel2/2Ifitm3 MEFs, but not in the IfitmDel2/2 cells, suggesting that Ifitm3 is required for this event (Fig. 4, S6) . Similar results were obtained with IFN-a (data not shown). We conclude from these experiments using orthologous reagents (cell lines and influenza A viruses) and methods, that IFN impedes vRNP nuclear entry, and IFITM3 is necessary and sufficient for this activity. Viral pseudoparticle fusion mediated by either HA or VSV-G envelope proteins is decreased by IFN, and IFITM3 is necessary and sufficient for this activity To further characterize the mechanism of IFITM3-mediated restriction, we used an established viral fusion assay [37, 38] . Lentiviral pseudoparticles containing the b-lactamase protein fused to the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr (BLAM-Vpr) and expressing either HA and NA (H1N1, WSN/33), or VSV-G envelope proteins, were incubated for 2 h with cells, which were then loaded with the b-lactamase flourogenic substrate, CCF2. Upon viral pseudoparticle fusion, BLAM-Vpr enters the cytosol and cleaves CCF2, producing a wave length shift in emitted light (from green to blue) when analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5A , [37] ). In MDCK-IFITM3 cells we observed a decrease in both HA-and VSV-G-directed fusion, which was comparable to the block produced by poisoning of the host vacuolar ATPase (vATPases) with a low dose of bafilomycin A1 (Baf, Fig. 5B ). The inhibition of vATPases prevents the low-pH activation required by these two viral envelope proteins to produce membrane fusion. A block to fusion of pseudoparticles expressing H1 (PR8), H3 (A/Udorn/72), H5 (A/Thai/74) or H7 (A/FPV/ Rostock/34) subtypes of HA was also detected with MDCK cells MEFs, either A) wild type (WT) or B) IfitmDel2/2, which are missing all five of the mouse Ifitm proteins, were either left untreated (left panels, Buffer), or treated (right panels) with IFN-c. The following day cells were incubated with PR8 on ice. Cells were next incubated in warm media containing LTRed. Cells were then fixed at the indicated times and immunostained with anti-NP antibodies (green), stained for DNA (blue), and imaged by confocal microscopy. Image analysis software was used to define the nuclear boundaries (blue lines). Images are representative of three independent experiments.

The H1N1pps were incubated for 2 h with cells, which were subsequently loaded with the b-lactamase flourogenic substrate, CCF2. Upon viral fusion, BLAM-Vpr enters the cytosol and can cleave CCF2, producing a wavelength shift from green to blue in emitted light when analyzed by flow cytometry ( [37] ). B) MDCK cells stably overexpressing IFITM3 (MDCK-IFITM3) or empty vector control cells (MDCK-Vector) were exposed for 2 h to viral pseudoparticles containing a BLAM-Vpr and expressing either the HA and NA envelope proteins of Influenza A virus (WSN/33, H1N1pp) or the VSV-G envelope protein (VSV-Gpp), then loaded with CCF2. After incubation with the indicated pseudoparticles, the cells were fixed and assayed for cleavage of CCF2 by determining the conversion of the fluorescence emission from 520 nm (uncleaved CCF2) to 447 nm (cleaved CCF2) using flow cytometry. Fusion of the pseudoparticles was inhibited by bafilomycin A1 (Baf). These results are representative of six independent experiments. C) IFITM3 inhibits fusion of H1N1pps in normal diploid fibroblasts. WI-38 fibroblasts stably transduced with IFITM3 (WI-38 M3) or the empty vector (WI-38 V) were exposed for 2 h to serial dilutions of H1N1pps containing BLAM-Vpr, with or without Baf. These results are representative of four independent experiments. D) Fusion of H1N1pps increases after IFITM3 knockdown. WI-38 fibroblasts stably transduced with a shRNA against IFITM3 (WI-38 shM3), a shRNA control with a scrambled sequence (WI-38 shScr), or the IFITM3 cDNA (WI-38 M3) were exposed to either no virus, H1N1pps or VSV-Gpps containing BLAM-Vpr. These results are representative of two independent experiments. E) Fusion of H1N1pps is inhibited by IFN-c. WI-38 fibroblasts were treated with IFN-c for 24 h or buffer alone prior to incubation with H1N1pps containing BLAM-Vpr. These results are representative of three independent experiments. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002337.g005 or with chicken embryonic fibroblasts (ChEFs), in which IFITM3 strongly inhibited viral replication (Fig. S7A , B, C). In the case of the MDCK cells, the block to fusion closely paralleled the level of inhibition seen when the pseudoparticles were tested for productive infection using HIV-1 p24 expression as a readout (Fig. S7E) . Consistent with earlier findings, pseudoparticles expressing an amphotropic MLV envelope protein were insensitive to IFITM3, showing the specificity of these results (Fig. S7D) . Similarly to its effect on H5-expressing pseudoparticles, IFITM3 inhibited replication of infectious avian H5N1 influenza A virus, A/Vietnam/1203/04 (VN/04), isolated from a fatal human infection (Fig. S7F-H) .",

A strong block to fusion in WI-38-IFITM3 cells, similar to that of the Baf and uninfected control samples, was seen at a range of serial dilutions of pseudoparticles, as well as an increase in fusion with IFITM3 depletion (shIFITM3, Fig. 5C, D) . IFN treatment inhibited fusion of the H1N1 pseudoparticles, albeit to a lesser extent than IFITM3 overexpression (Fig. 5E) , and this effect was largely absent when IFITM3 was stably depleted in HeLa cells (Fig. S8 ). Similar results were obtained with IFN-a (data not shown). Based on these experiments using multiple cell lines and HA, VSV-G, and MLV envelope-expressing pseudoparticles, we conclude that IFITM3 is required and sufficient for an IFN-mediated block of viral pseudoparticle fusion. Importantly, the increase in pseudoparticle fusion seen when endogenous IFITM3 was depleted in either the HeLa or WI-38 shIFITM3 cell lines argues that fusion inhibition underlies the first line defense provided by endogenous, as well as overexpressed, IFITM3.",

A549 cells express MxA and have been used extensively in influenza A viral replication studies [40] . Therefore to clarify the antiviral roles of IFITM3 and MxA, we tested the levels of viral replication in A549 cells stably expressing one of three shRNAs targeting IFITM3 (shIFITM3-1, -2, or -3). All three shIFITM3 cell lines showed increased infection (WSN/33 strain) and strong IFITM3 knockdown, when compared to the negative control cell line expressing a shRNA against firefly luciferase (shLuc), with or without IFN treatment (Fig. S9A, B) . The majority of the protective effect of either IFN-a or c was lost in the shIFITM3 cell lines. We next confirmed both the baseline levels, as well as the IFN-inducibility of MxA in the A549 cells (Fig. S9C) . We also determined that MxA was both present and IFN-inducible in WI-38 normal fibroblasts, another cell line used in loss-of-function experiments in this work (Fig. S9D) . Furthermore, IF studies of WI-38 cells showed that MxA is expressed in an IFN-inducible vesicular pattern and that these structures did not appreciably colocalize with vesicles containing IFITM3 (Fig. S9E , [39] ). We conclude that MxA is expressed in the A549 and WI-38 cell lines, but cannot fully compensate for loss of the antiviral actions of IFITM3.",

            "text": "IFITM3 is present in endosomes and lysosomes and these compartments are expanded with IFITM3 overexpression or IFN treatment Our data demonstrate that IFN or IFITM3 inhibit viral fusion. Influenza A virus fuses with the host membrane in late endosomes when the pH decreases to 5 [6, 7, 41] . Rab7 is a late endosomal/lysosomal small GTPase that is required for the fusion of many pH-dependent viruses, including influenza A virus [6, 41] . Previous reports have shown that IFITM3 colocalizes with LAMP1 and CD63, components of lysosomes and multivesicular bodies, respectively [19] . However, the relationship of IFITM3 and Rab7 within the host cell infrastructure remains unknown. Therefore we investigated the location of IFITM3, by undertaking immunoflourescence (IF) studies using antibodies that recognize IFITM3, Rab7, or LAMP1 [42] . Although the baseline level of IFITM3 in the A549-Vector cells was low, there was partial colocalization observed with either Rab7 or LAMP1 (Fig. 6A-D, 7A,) . IFITM3 also partially colocalized with LAMP1 and LTRed-containing structures seen with IFITM3 overexpression (Fig. 6A, B, 7A) . Interestingly, either IFITM3 overexpression or IFN increased the staining intensity of Rab7 and LAMP1 (Fig. 7A, B, S10A ). Partial colocalization of IFITM3 was also seen with either endogenous LAMP1, or an exogenously expressed Rab7-yellow fluorescence fusion protein (Rab7-YFP) in MDCK cells (Fig. 6E-I) . However, in all cases, co-localization was not complete because cells contained areas that uniquely labeled for each of the proteins. Western blots indicated that IFITM3 overexpression led to modest increases in both LAMP1 and Rab7 proteins in the A549-IFITM3 cells (Fig. 7C) . However, these blots also showed that while IFN treatment of the A549-Vector cells increased IFITM3 protein levels as expected, the amount of Rab7 and LAMP1 remained unchanged. We conclude that IFITM3 partially resides in the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments along with Rab7 and LAMP1, and that IFITM3 overexpression or IFN treatment expands these compartments through a mechanism that cannot be fully explained by increased protein expression alone.",

Therefore, we extended our investigation of these compartments. An increase in acidic structures was seen in MDCK and A549 cells overexpressing IFITM3 as compared to control cell lines, using either the vital acidophilic stain, acridine orange (AO), LTRed, or a cathepsin-L substrate that fluoresces only after it is proteolyzed, when compared to the corresponding vector control cells (Fig. 8A, B, a, b) . Cathepsins are a family of lysosomal zymogens active in acidic environments (pH#5.5) which are required for both the degradation of endocytic substrates and for the entry of several IFITM3-susceptible viruses [19] . Flow cytometry revealed an increase in the total LTRed fluorescent signal in both the MDCK and A549 IFITM3 cell lines when compared to controls (Fig. 8C ). This expanded compartment represents a heterogeneous population of lysosomes and autolysosomes, based on confocal imaging showing the colocalization of the autophagosome marker, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), with either LTRed or with CD63, with the latter being a resident of multivesicular bodies, amphisomes and autolysosomes (Fig. 8D, E) . Furthermore, MDCK-IFITM3 cells stably transduced with an LC3 protein fused to both a red fluorescent protein (mCherry) and an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) showed a predominantly red signal, which occurs when the mCherry-EGFP-LC3 protein resides inside the acidified interior of an autolysosome (Fig. 8F, [43] ). In keeping with previous reports that IFN-c induces autophagy [44, 45] , we detected enhanced LTRed staining in either IFN-c treated MEFs or A549 cells (Fig. 4A, S10A) . We conclude that increases in IFITM3 levels expand the lysosomal/autolysosomal compartment. ",

Second, either endogenous or overexpressed IFITM3, as well as IFN treatment, block the fusion of viral pseudoparticles expressing various influenza A virus envelope proteins (H1, H3, H5 and H7 subtypes of HA), or the VSV-G envelope protein; this block is specific because the fusion of pseudoparticles expressing MLV envelope is not inhibited by IFITM3. Third, our work reveals that IFITM3 partially resides with Rab7 in late endosomes, thus placing it in position to block influenza A virus' cytosolic access. Fourth, IFITM3 overexpression or IFN induce the expansion of late endosomal and lysosomal compartments containing Rab7 and LAMP1. Fifth, we show that similar to IFN-c treatment, IFITM3 overexpression expands the number and size of autolysosomes, and it is into these compartments that trapped viruses are trafficked and subsequently degraded. Consistent with previous reports, our data show that high levels of IFITM3 do not prevent viral access to acidified compartments and that IFITM3 colocalizes with CD63 and LAMP1 [19] . This is in contrast to a report noting the exclusion of overexpressed IFITM3 from LAMP1-containing structures [33] . Therefore, this work adds substantially to our interpretation of previous reports by demonstrating that key downstream events in the viral lifecycle, fusion and vRNP nuclear translocation, are prevented by either IFN or IFITM3. IFITM3 thus represents a previously unappreciated class of anti-viral effector that permits viral entry into the endosomal compartment, but prevents egress into the cytosol. These studies also raise new questions including i) how do IFN and IFITM3 prevent viral fusion? ii) how do IFN and IFITM3 alter the endosomal and autolysosomal compartments? and iii) is the latter action required for viral restriction, or alternatively does it arise as an outcome of IFITM3's potential cellular role?",

            "text": "Based on the substantial loss in IFN's potency observed when IFITM3 is depleted (50-80% loss of viral inhibition, Fig. S9A , B, [14] ) we conclude that inhibition of viral emergence from the endosomal pathway is a prominent component of IFN's antagonism of influenza A virus replication in vitro. Our data also show that MxA cannot fully compensate for the loss of IFITM3 in IFN-treated cells challenged with influenza A virus. Recent work by Dittmann et al. [46] and Zimmermann et al. [47] reveal that human influenza A viral strains have evolved a means to evade MxA, suggesting a possible explanation for the cellular reliance on IFITM3 for protection in vitro. Similarly the IEG, IFIT1, prevents viral replication by targeting viral 59 triphosphate-RNAs (PPP-RNA) for destruction [48, 49] . Given that IFITM3 is necessary for the majority of IFN-mediated restriction of influenza A virus in vitro, it may be that the virus has also evolved a means to at least partially nullify IFIT1, perhaps via the massive production of short ''decoy'' PPP-RNAs, as previously postulated [49, 50] .",

In the MEF and A549 experiments, IFN produced increased Rab7 and LAMP1 immunostaining, in addition to an increase in acidic structures. At present, we cannot explain the increased Rab7 and LAMP1 signals seen after IFN stimulation or IFITM3 overexpression solely on the slight elevations in the abundance of these proteins detected by immunoblotting. Two possible explanations for the increased immunostaining observed, are that IFN stimulation induced these proteins to cluster together or alternatively unmasked sequestered epitopes; we find the latter possibility less likely since LAMP1 and Rab7 flourescent fusion proteins also showed larger and more intense signals under similar conditions. We envision that IFITM3-mediated clustering of organelles and their protein cargoes might contribute to the host cell's antiviral state. Earlier work reported no correlation between the size of the IFITM3-induced acidified compartments and the level of viral restriction [19] , however, we observe that increasing levels of IFITM3 result in both an expansion of lysosomes/ autolysosomes and increased viral inhibition. These observations might be explained by a common mechanism underlying the increase in these structures and viral inhibition, in addition to raising the possibility that they play a role in IFITM-mediated viral restriction.",

The late endosomal-and lysosomal-associated small GTPase, Rab7, is required for influenza A virus infection [7, 41] . The IFITM3-resistant viruses previously tested (MLV, the arena viruses and the hepacivirus, HCV) are all Rab7-independent, while the entry of the IFITM3-susceptible viruses (influenza A, dengue, Ebola, Marburg, and SARS) relies on Rab7 [14, 19, 41, 52, 53, 54] . Standing against this hypothesis, is the lack of effect on VSV-G-mediated entry with expression of a dominant negative Rab7 [41, 55, 56] ). However, additional studies have shown that VSV-G-directed entry is dependent on transport to the late endosomes [57, 58] ; these latter results, together with those of Huang et al. and Weidner et al. [19, 20] , are consistent with the prediction that viruses that fuse in late endosomes or lysosomes are vulnerable to IFITM3's actions, while viruses whose genomes enter at the cell surface or in the early endosomes may avoid IFITM3's full effect. Of note, we have been unable to demonstrate that IFITM3 blocks HIV-1 replication using TZM-bl HeLa cells and are working to address these differences with a published study ( [59] , data not shown).",

Therefore several possibilities could explain the containment and neutralization of viruses within the endosomal pathway, including alterations in endosomal trafficking, acidification, or the host membrane's fusion characteristics (bending modulus, elasticity). While additional work is required to further define the mechanism, the lack of toxicity seen with cells stably overexpressing high levels of IFITM3 suggests that gross alterations in endogenous trafficking or pH control are unlikely (data not shown).

Such actions might confer an advantage to the host because if IFITM3 simply decreased viral attachment and/or entry, the repulsed viruses would be free to attack neighboring cells. Of course while there are considerable differences between this simple scenario and the directed phagocytosis of pathogens by specialized immune cells, i.e. macrophages, the similarities none-the-less suggest an early prototype for a more evolved defense mechanism.",

For the H5N1, H3N1, and H7N1 pseudoparticles, pCAGGS-HA5 (A/Thailand2(SP-33)/2004) pCAGGS-HA3 (A/Udorn/72), and pCAGGS-HA7 (A/FPV/Rostock/34) expression plasmids were co-transfected with the pCAGGS-NA WSN/33, pMM310, and the pBR43IeG-nef+ lentiviral backbone. Cultures for pseudoparticle fusion assays, including stably transduced MDCK cells and WI-38 fibroblasts, were plated in 24-well dishes with 90,000 cells per well at the beginning of each assay. At the time of assay, 0.5 mL of virus stock was added to cells and incubated for 2-3 h (depending on cell type) at 37uC. In experiments using bafilomycin A1 (Sigma), the inhibitor was added at 0.1 nM final concentration (low dose) at 37uC for 1 h prior to incubation with virus. After infection, viral media was then aspirated and replaced with complete DMEM containing CCF2-AM (Invitrogen) along with 1.7 mg/mL probenecid (Sigma). Cells were incubated in the dark for 1 h, followed by dissociation from the dish using Enzyme Free PBS-based Dissociation Buffer, and fixation in 2% PFA. Flow cytometry was conducted on a Becton Dickinson LSRII using 405 nm excitation from the violet laser, and measuring 450 nm emission in the Pacific Blue channel and 520 nm emission in the Pacific Orange channel. Data was analyzed using FACSDiva and FlowJo8.8.7.",
