Outbreaks are associated with high morbidity and create a public health challenge for countries affected. Recent outbreaks have occurred in both Europe and the Americas, suggesting CHIKV may continue to spread. Despite the sustained threat of the virus, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapy against CHIKV. Therefore, it is critical to develop a vaccine that is both well tolerated and highly protective.",

In particular, BALB/c mice were completely protected against viremia upon challenge with CHIKV after two doses of MVA-CHIK. Additionally, A129 mice (deficient in IFNa/b) were protected from viremia, footpad swelling, and mortality. While high anti-virus antibodies were elicited, low or undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies were produced in both mouse models. However, passive transfer of MVA-CHIK immune serum to na\u00efve mice did not protect against mortality, suggesting that antibodies may not be the main effectors of protection afforded by MVA-CHIK. Furthermore, depletion of CD4 + , but not CD8 + T-cells from vaccinated mice resulted in 100% mortality, implicating the indispensable role of CD4 + T-cells in the protection afforded by MVA-CHIK.",

Large outbreaks have occurred on La R\u00e9union island (an overseas department of France), Mauritius, Sri Lanka, and India, among others [4] . In addition, autochthonous transmission has been seen in Europe, with outbreaks occurring in both Italy and mainland France [5] , suggesting temperate climates can support virus transmission. Furthermore, as of January 2014, the European Centre for Disease Control has confirmed 70 cases of CHIKV on the Caribbean islands of St. Martin, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Saint Barthelemy, with many more suspected, indicating spread to continental America is possible. CHIKV is transmitted to humans by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, the latter of which has been an important vector in many of the recent outbreaks due to mutations in the envelope genes of the virus that allow for more efficient transmission [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

            "text": "An alternative approach for developing CHIKV vaccines is the use of viral vectors. A complex adenovirus expressing the complete CHIKV structural poly-protein has been described and was shown to be immunogenic and protective in mice [19] . However, safety concerns regarding adenovirus based-vectors may limit this approach [20] . In contrast, Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) has been tested in over 120,000 humans and was proven to be highly safe and effective in protecting against smallpox [21, 22] . MVA was attenuated by over 500 passages of Vaccinia virus (VACV) in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs), which resulted in large deletions of its genome that restricted its host-range [23, 24] . During passaging, MVA lost the ability to productively infect mammalian cells, leading to abortive replication [25] . VACV, which is far more reactogenic than MVA [26, 27] , has been used previously against other alphaviruses, namely Sindbis and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV) viruses, providing robust immunity against the latter, suggesting poxviruses as suitable vectors against alphaviruses [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Despite the presence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies elicited by most of the VACV vectored VEEV vaccine candidates, they were ineffective in providing protection against airborne infection, suggesting they were unable to elicit a sufficient T cell mediated immune response, which has been shown to be critical for protection against lethal VEEV encephalitis [34, 35] . MVA, like its parent virus VACV, has been extensively tested as a vaccine vector, expressing viral, bacterial or parasite antigens and has been shown to induce both humoral and cell-mediated protective immune responses [25, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Furthermore, MVA can be delivered effectively by different routes and has much greater stability than most other live virus based vaccine approaches [43] . Additionally, because MVA undergoes only abortive replication in mammalian cells, vector stability is not a problem as only one infection cycle occurs [25] .Therefore, an MVA vectored CHIKV vaccine would be an attractive option for resource-limited countries, where the majority of CHIKV infections occur. Additionally, Volz and Sutter (2013) have targeted MVA as an ideal vector for safe next generation vaccines, with CHIKV being mentioned specifically as an attractive candidate pathogen [44] . Furthermore, Garcia-Arriaza et al. (2014) successfully used MVA for expression of the entire CHIKV structural protein as a vaccine candidate, indicating MVA can provide effective immunity against this virus [45] .",

The vaccine was tested in two mouse modelsone immunocompetent and the other lacking a/b interferon signaling (A129)-and was uniformly protective. Mice deficient in a/b interferon signaling have been used for many viruses and have been shown repeatedly to be a good model for CHIKV, providing many similarities to human infection [46] [47] [48] . Complete protection against mortality was provided when MVA-CHIK was administered in a prime-boost regimen. In addition, it provided 80% protection against mortality in this highly immunocompromised mouse model after only 11 days post-vaccination. Surprisingly, while playing a role, neutralizing antibodies did not appear to be necessary for protection against CHIKV, contrary to other recent reports [49, 50] . Most importantly, depletion of CD4 + T cells in vaccinated mice resulted in loss of protection, with 100% succumbing to infection upon challenge with wild-type CHIKV, indicating an indispensable role of MVA-CHIK immune CD4+ T cells in protection.",

Chikungunya virus strain La Reunion (CHIKV-LR; GenBank: DQ443544.2) was used for both the construction of recombinant poxviruses and challenge experiments. The virus was kindly provided by Dr. Scott Weaver (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas). The CHIK-IRES vaccine candidate has been previously described [51] and was used in this study as a positive control. Briefly, the vaccine was constructed by replacing the subgenomic promoter in a cDNA CHIKV clone with an internal ribosome entry site from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV-IRES) and has shown to be effective and safe in mice [51] and non-human primates [52] . The MVA virus used in these studies was obtained through BEI Resources (NIAID, NIH,ref # NR-727).

E2 was chosen because it has been previously demonstrated that most neutralizing antibodies mapped to epitopes in this region [49, 54, 55] . E3 has not been strongly associated with protection; however, it was included to allow proper folding of the E2 protein [56] . The expression of p62 was controlled by a synthetic early/late Vaccinia virus promoter and used the Vaccinia virus transcription terminator, which have been previously described [57] .

The virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and causes a disease that is characterized by high fever and incapacitating joint pain that can cause great personal and economic loss. At present, no approved vaccine or antivirals are approved against CHIKV. In this study, we developed a novel CHIKV vaccine that is vectored by Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), an attenuated vaccine vector which has been shown to be safe in humans and induce a strong immune response. The vaccine expresses the E3 and E2 proteins of CHIKV, the latter of which is thought to be the main mediator of protection. The vaccine was effective in two mouse models and protected against all markers of disease tested despite the absence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies, the gold standard of protection. Depletion of CD4+ T cells from vaccinated mice resulted in loss of protection, implicating these cells in the protection induced by the vaccine.",

Cells were then washed with 16 PBS and transfected with appropriate transfer vectors using FuGENE HD (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) following manufacturer's protocol. Cells were monitored for the presence of red fluorescence 24 hours after transfection. At 48-72 h post-transfection, monolayers were harvested, centrifuged at 5006g for 5 min at 4uC and cells disrupted by freeze-thaw (3 times) followed by sonication (2 times for 15 s using a cup sonicator). The disrupted cell extracts containing recombinant viruses expressing DsRed were plated onto fresh CEF cells and overlaid with 0.8% agarose. After 48-72 h, recombinant virus-generated plaques were detected by observing fluorescence and picked into 300 mL media with a sterile filter pipette tip. The cell/virus samples were subjected to freeze thaw and sonication (as described above) and plated to continue passaging. Plaques were passaged until no wild-type (GFP expressing) virus was observed at which point PCR was performed to confirm the presence of only recombinant virus [61] . High titer virus stocks were prepared from PCR positive cultures and recombinant MVA-CHIK viruses were further characterized. PCR analysis was performed on final virus stocks to ensure genetic homogeneity and stability. DNA was extracted using the quick-gDNA Miniprep kit from Zymo Research per manufacturer's instructions (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). PCR was then performed using Phusion polymerase with deletion III specific primers (Forward 59-atgcggcacctctcttaa-39, Reverse 59-tgggctccttataccaagca-39).",

MVA-CHIK was created by transfecting the plasmid containing CHIKV p62 under control of a se/l promoter which also expressed dsRed2 under control of a p11 promoter. This plasmid contains flanking regions to deletion III (DelIII) which is where the recombinant gene was inserted into the genome with a fluorescent marker (A). PCR analysis of the DelIII region. Viral DNA was extracted from purified, final virus stocks of MVA-CHIK, MVA-GFP and MVA-WT. PCR was performed using primers specific for the DelIII flanking regions. A DNA ladder is included for comparison of size (B). Monolayers of CEF cells were infected with recombinant MVA-CHIK viruses at MOI of 5 or 10 PFU/cell for Western Blot or Immunostaining, respectively. After 24 h post infection, cells were harvested and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by western blot analysis (C) or fixed with 2% PFA as described in the methods. Both the cellular pellet and supernatant were analyzed for expression of CHIKV E3/E2. The order is the same for both and is as follows, wild-type CHIKV (1), MVA-CHIK (2), MVA-GFP (3), and mock infected cells (4) . Following fixation, cells for immunostaining were either allowed to remain intact or permeabilized with triton X-100 (D). Anti-CHIKV polyclonal rabbit was used for primary staining for both assays.

Negative control groups were immunized with MVA-GFP at the same dose. As a positive control, mice were vaccinated with experimental control vaccine virus CHIK-IRES [17] at a dose of 10 4 TCID 50 units.

Mice were bled prior to boost and prior to challenge following vaccination to monitor levels of neutralizing and anti-virus antibodies. Passive transfer studies were performed using A129 mice as previously described [37] . Briefly, serum was collected from vaccinated BALB/c or A129 mice and equal volumes from each sample were used to create a pool of sera for each mouse strain separately. 100 mL (BALB/c) or 200 mL (A129) of this inoculum were then injected into naive mice intraperitoneally (i.p.). Serum from CHIK-IRES vaccinated A129 mice (100 mL) was used as a positive control. 24 hours after passive transfer, mice were challenged in the same manner as described above.

This mouse strain is more sensitive to CHIKV infection and experience high viremia, footpad swelling and succumb to infection [51] compared to immunocompetent strains of mice. Mice were vaccinated as described previously and then challenged with wt-CHIKV. MVA-CHIK or MVA-GFP vaccinated mice had background levels of neutralizing antibodies, whereas all CHIK-IRES vaccinated mice seroconverted (Fig. 2a) . Serum collected from these mice post-prime and post-boost was tested for total anti-virus Ig(G+M) antibodies by ELISA. A clear booster effect was seen in MVA-CHIK vaccinated mice, as the differences between post-prime and post-boost samples were highly significant (p,0.001) (Fig. 2b) . This difference was not as profound with CHIK-IRES vaccinated mice as they had high levels of anti-virus antibodies even prior to boost. MVA-CHIK and CHIK-IRES groups were protected 100% from lethal challenge after prime and boost (Fig. 2c ). In addition, MVA-CHIK mice were completely protected against both viremia and footpad swelling (Figs. 2d-e) .",

Several groups have recently employed varying strategies to construct effective vaccines against CHIKV. Live-attenuated, inactivated, adenovirus vectored, DNA, and VLP based strategies all have been tested and have been shown to be effective in providing protection against CHIKV [12, 13, 68, 69] . Despite promising results, these vaccine candidates all have some drawbacks. Safety, stability, and production of a broad long-lived immune response are necessary for any effective vaccine. Safety concerns remain for both live-attenuated and adenovirus based approaches. Inactivated and VLP based approaches require adjuvants and normally elicit weak T cell responses. In contrast, MVA has been shown to be safe in thousands of human patients micro-neutralization assay (A) and ELISA (B), respectively. Prime only MVA-GFP data is not shown because it does not differ with the prime & boost groups. Mice were monitored for 14 days following challenge for survival (C) and footpad swelling (D).

BALB/c mice, which are immunocompetent, were 100% protected from viremia upon challenge. A129 mice, which are deficient in a/b interferon signaling, and therefore highly susceptible to CHIKV infection, were also completely protected against challenge with wtCHIKV after prime and boost vaccinations. In addition, 80% of mice were protected from lethal challenge following prime only vaccination with MVA-CHIK. Despite the robust protection observed, mice did not produce a strong neutralizing antibody response following vaccination. Although vaccinated A129 mice developed undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies, they did produce a significant amount of anti-virus antibodies, which for other alphaviruses have been shown to be protective [71] [72] [73] . A129 mice passively transferred MVA-CHIK immune serum from either BALB/c or A129 mice were not protected against mortality, or footpad swelling following challenge, despite a slight reduction in viremia 2 days postinfection in mice transferred A129 MVA-CHIK immune serum (p = 0.11). This suggests antibodies induced by vaccination were not sufficient to provide protection in this manner. This could be due to the fact that passively administered immune serum is significantly diluted in the circulation of na\u00efve mice. Further evidence that antibodies are not sufficient for protection alone was provided by depletion studies conducted in MVA-CHIK vaccinated mice. When immune CD4 + T-cells were depleted, despite the presence of full levels of circulating anti-virus antibodies, mice were 100% susceptible to lethal infection. If anti-virus antibodies were essential for protection a reduction in mortality or viremia would be expected in the CD4+ depleted mice, which was not observed.

Immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis suggested CHIKV p62 protein was being maintained inside of the cell and that furin cleavage was not occurring to separate E3 from E2, respectively. P62 was chosen due the presence of immunodominant epitopes and the fact that previous reports have shown that it could be an effective immunogen against other alphaviruses [71, 74] . In addition, it has been previously observed that when expressed by a plasmid, the presence of E1 is not a requirement to allow E2 to be placed on the outside of the plasma membrane [75, 76] . Barth et al. (1997) also demonstrated that in the context of an E1 deleted Semliki Forest virus, p62 is not transported efficiently to the plasma membrane while E2 alone is [77] . Therefore, absence of E2 on the surface of infected cells is not completely unexpected and may have proven to be serendipitous in allowing the production of a more robust CD4 + immune response. This could provide an explanation for the lack of a strong humoral immune response, as antibodies would have limited access to this intracellular protein.",

            "text": "Recent studies based on another vaccine candidate, CHIK-IRES, have shown that a correlate of protection based on antibodies can be established for CHIKV [50] . Herein, we present data that suggest that this is specific to the vaccine being used and that there may be more than one way to provide protection against CHIKV. MVA-CHIK selectively expresses E2-E3 proteins. It could be argued that the processing of this virus is substantially different than the live attenuated CHIK-IRES vaccine or wildtype CHIKV. As a result, during infection a different set of epitopes are generated that may well be protective via alternative mechanisms. In another report, using mice deficient in either Bcells or CD4 + T cells, data were presented that suggested that antibodies are essential in controlling CHIKV infection and that CD4 + T cells may exacerbate disease [49, 80] . Hawman et al. (2013) found similarly, that mice deficient in both B and T-cells had less severe tissue pathology early after CHIKV infection when compared to wild-type controls [81] . However, in the same report it was demonstrated that virus was inefficiently cleared in the absence of lymphocytes, suggesting a possible dual role for these cells during early CHIKV infection where some tissue damage is allowed in order to control viral dissemination. While we observe very little evidence of tissue damage in vaccinated mice, it is possible that MVA-CHIK induced specific CD4 + T-cells which are able to effectively control viral replication while minimizing collateral tissue injury. It remains possible that CD4 T-cells are required for recall responses to produce antibodies following challenge, although this is unlikely as mice would be expected to have early viremia, which we did not observe in vaccinated mice (Fig. 2E) . Currently, we are conducting studies to determine the role of CD4 + T cells in protection. Our data are also contrary to the previous report by Teo et al. (2013) , where no footpad swelling was observed upon antibody depletion of CD4 + T cells during CHIKV infection [80] . However, their studies were performed in na\u00efve mice with a functional interferon system, in contrast, our studies used vaccinated mice without proper IFN a/b signaling, and thus might account for the differences observed. Additionally, recent studies in humans show that there is a strong CD4+ IFNc positive T-cell response directed against the E2 protein, suggesting it might be playing a role in the protective immune response against the virus [82] . Therefore, the data presented here may be relevant to human infection, and suggest that antibodies may not be the only mediator of protection against alphaviruses.",

They report that the E2 protein can be found in both the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm, in contrast to our results which clearly showed E2 is not on the surface of the cell (Figure 1 ). This could explain why the immune responses are so drastically different between the two vaccine candidates. While depletion studies indicated CD4+ T cells are indispensable for protection for MVA-CHIK in this report, the mechanism of protection is unclear in their report, although high levels of neutralizing antibodies Prior to challenge, BALB/c mice were bled and serum was monitored for neutralizing activity by TCID 50 microneutralization assay (A). Mice were bled two days following challenge and viremia levels were measured via TCID 50 (B). For passive immunization, prime and boost vaccinated BALB/c and A129 mice were bled and serum taken from each mouse was pooled with equal volumes into separate pools from each strain. Pools of serum (100 mL for BALB/c and 200 mL for A129) were then injected i.p. into A129 mice which were challenged 24 hrs later with 10 2 TCID 50 units of wild-type CHIKV. Viremia was measured 2 d.p.i (C) and survival was monitored for two weeks post-challenge (D). The dotted line indicates the limit of detection of the assay. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002970.g004 Figure 5 . MVA-CHIK elicited a CHIK-E2-specific CD4 + T cell response in A129 mice. Two weeks following boost, splenocytes from MVA-GFP or MVA-CHIK immunized mice were stimulated with CHIKV NSP2, E2 or E3 peptide pools (1 mg/well). T-cells were then stained for intracellular IFNc (A and C) or CD40L (B and D). Representative dot plots (for only one mouse per group) are shown for both cytokines with MVA-CHIK and MVA-GFP stimulated with E2 peptide pools or background media control (A and B). For stimulation with E2, E3 and NSP2 peptide pools data are presented as the mean+SD of the percentages cytokine-positive cells among gated CD4 + T cells (3 mice/group) with background subtracted (C and D). Stimulation was significantly higher for IFNc and CD40L in the MVA-CHIK immune group, as compared to MVA-GFP control (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01, respectively). No cytokine production in CD8 + T cells was observed (data not shown). doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002970.g005 induced by their vaccine are likely protective [50] . Additionally, the vaccine constructed by Garcia-Arriaza et al. (2014) uses the entire structural protein consisting of Capsid-E3-E2-6K-E1. In contrast, our vaccine contains only the E3-E2 portion. Recent reports have shown that the capsid protein contains immunodominant epitopes for both B and T cells [55, 82] , and was therefore excluded from our vaccine construct in favor of E2 with its accessory protein E3. Furthermore, we used a footpad injection which more closely mimics intradermal vaccination a human might be expected to receive. Garcia-Arriaza et al. (2014) used intraperitoneal vaccinations, which are not given to humans and therefore could potentially induce a vastly different immune response delivered by another route.",

The MVA construct expressing CHIKV p62 protein was effective in several mouse models and provided protection against two critical markers of disease, viremia and joint swelling. The vaccine was protective despite low levels of neutralizing antibodies which are normally considered to be the golden standard for protection against alphaviruses. Therefore the results reported here challenge the assumption that only these antibodies are effective in providing protection against CHIKV or other alphaviruses. Future studies combining a T-cell targeted vaccine, like the one presented here, along with a more traditional vaccine which induces strong neutralizing antibodies could provide a more robust and comprehensive immune response in a safe and easy to deliver vaccine regimen. However, further work is required to characterize the protective mechanisms it provides.",
