Local residents were forced to evacuated without pets and the left behind animals were rescued from the restricted zone one month later. Unplanned animal rescue and unregulated sheltering caused secondary damage to animals such as disease epidemics at impounded animal shelter. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the incidence of upper respiratory infection (URI) and diarrhea in cats at the first response animal shelter in Fukushima, and investigate factors affecting the duration of disease and determinants of treatments performed. Eighty percent and 59% of impounded cats developed URI, 71% and 54% of cats developed diarrhea, and 91% and 83% of cats had at least one disease in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Uses of multiple drug administration (more than five drugs) was associated with prolonged URI and diarrhea. Multiple antibiotics, antihistamines, interferon, and steroids were associated with relapse of and prolonged URI. Developing a standardized treatment protocol for commonly observed diseases at Japanese animal shelters to prevent and control diseases, to promote animal welfare, and protect public health in the face of future disasters is overdue. did not allow animals, so dogs and cats accompanying owners were either brought to the Ihno shelter or transferred to neighboring animal hospitals. The animal rescue operation originally focused on searching for companion animals in the restricted zone, and was incepted based upon pressure from pet owners forced to abandon their pets. The consequences of abandonment included: animal starvation, emaciation, and death; illegal entry to feed or reclaim animals with resultant exposure to unsafe radiation levels; uncontrolled animal reproduction; and harm to the area's ecosystem.",

The Ihno shelter was initially established at a warehouse and was unsuitable for sheltering dogs and cats for a prolonged time; therefore, a second shelter was built in Miharu, Fukushima, and all animals were transferred there in January 2013. Because the animal rescue operation time was lengthy, it evolved through two phases. The initial chaotic phase suffered from lack of infrastructure, resources, and competent staff, exaggerating an already stressful situation. In the first seven months of the initial phase, there were no guidelines or protocols for managing animals at the shelter, different volunteer veterinarians engaged in the care of animals each day, and infectious diseases were extremely common. The second phase was far more stable: most of the animals were tamed, socialized, and experienced a low incidence of disease.",

The inherent properties of animal shelters, which include a constant influx of animals without medical backgrounds or vaccination histories, overcrowding, lack of quarantine or isolation facilities, poor hygiene, loud noise, housing with dogs, confinement to cages, and extremely stressful environments, act as risk factors for endemic infectious diseases [1, [4] [5] [6] . Although the prevalence of causative agents is shelter-specific[7-9], the majority of URI is caused by feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), Bordetella bronchiseptica, Chlamydophila felis, and Mycoplasma species [4, 10, 11] . Apparently healthy cats can be carriers for all of these agents; this and the risk that shelters pose make control of URI extremely difficult in the absence of standardized protocols for disease prevention and management.",

Incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Interactions between variables were assessed for improvement in model fit by performing likelihood ratio tests contrasting nested models. Multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression models were used to assess the association between the potential risk factors and the count of temporally independent URI events (each event was counted individually when the complete resolution of the previous symptoms and development of new URI symptoms was two or more weeks apart); results are reported as IRR and 95% CI. Logistic regression was used to determine whether relapse of URI was related to the same potential risk factors; results are reported as odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI. Variables with p<0.20 will initially be included in a multivariable model, and Cox proportional hazards regression, multilevel mixed-effects Poisson regression models, and logistic regression with backward elimination will be performed to identify a model containing variables whose coefficients significantly differ from 0.

Even after controlling for year, antihistamine use remained associated with more frequent disease incidence. The use of antihistamines in cats at the shelter to treat URI is not typically considered to be an appropriate treatment. Known risk factors for URI at shelters include stress, overcrowding, cats being housed close to dogs, cats being moved from cage to cage, poor hygiene, and housing styles [3, 8, [13] [14] [15] .

Cats at shelters are already under the stress of relocation, cage confinement, crowding, and possible immunosuppression, so administration of corticosteroids could exacerbate stress and suppress immune response at the very time that cats are exposed to communicable diseases [18] . Evidence shows that corticosteroid administration induces FHV-1 activation [14] , and both contributing to initiation and complication of the clinical signs and disease course [19] . In the present study, the dosage of corticosteroid was unknown; however, any administration was associated with URI incidence, recurrence, and relapse of the upper respiratory infection syndrome. Although evidence supports the efficacy of corticosteroids for chronic stomatitis in cats [20, 21] , it is still advisable to avoid using corticosteroids in cats that are highly stressed and possibly immunocompromised at shelters. Interferon was administered to approximately 66% of cats with URI in this study. Although interferon has shown anti-FHV-1 activity in vitro [19] , there is no evidence to date supporting its effectiveness for treatment of clinical signs of URI. In this study interferon administration was associated with more frequent URI incidence and longer duration of the disease. Interferon was effective for treatment of chronic gingivostomatitis in one report [22] , and has been anecdotally reported to lead to clinical improvement for virulent systemic FCV disease [23] . The cats in the present study did not show severe symptoms applicable to these diseases, and virulent systemic FCV disease has not been reported in Japan to date. Interferon is an expensive drug (approximately $100 per one dose) and requires multiple injections, so is unlikely to be recommended to use when its efficacy has not been fully proven for typical URI for shelter cats.",

Studies indicate that doxycycline, pradofloxacin, and amoxicillin were effective for clinical resolution of URI [24, 25] , and doxycycline and amoxicillin were more effective than cefovecin in treating clinical signs [26] . The most common first choices of antibiotic used in United States shelters are doxycycline (52%), amocixillin/clavulanic acid (33%), and azithromycin (7%) [27] . Multiple agents are involved in URI, and each causative agent has different susceptibility to the antibiotics. Bordetella. bronchiseptica isolates are susceptible to doxycycline and amoxicillin, but resistant to cefovecin, cephalosporin, and ampicillin [26, 28] . Mycoplasma species, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Chlamydophila felis are resistant to \u03b2-lactams [29] . Enrofloxacin and doxycycline were effective in improving clinical signs of Chlamydophila felis infection [30] . In this study, enrofloxacin and cefovecin were associated with relapse of clinical disease. Performing cultures and determining antibiotic susceptibilities before treating URI in shelters is impractical, and even identifying the causative agent(s) in each patient is infeasible in shelter settings. However, inconsistent choice of antibiotic is medically contraindicated and potentially ineffective within individuals, and using two or more antibiotics was associated with prolonged clinical signs and frequent recurrence of the disease in this study.",

Twelve different antibiotics were used, including nitroimidazole (metronidazole), sulfonamides (sulfadimethoxine, sufamonomethoxine), penicillins (penicillin, amoxicillin), \u03b2-lactams (ampicillin, cephalosporin, and cefalexin), fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin, orbifloxacin), doxycycline, and cefavecin. Diarrhea in cats has multifactorial causes, include change of diet, stress, and infections with enteropathonegic viruses, parasites, protozoa, and bacteria [5, 12] . Not all the diarrheic cats were examined for enteropathogens in this study, but those known to be causal in cats include Cryptosporidium spp, Cystoisospora spp, Giardia spp, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella spp, Campylobacter jejuni, ascarids, hookworms, astovirus, feline corona virus, Toxoplasma gondii, feline panleukopenia virus, FCV, and Spirometra spp [12, 31, 32] . Salmonella, Campylobacter, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, hookworms, and ascarids are pathogens with zoonotic potential; however, these enteropathogens can also be identified in normal feces [12, 31, 33] . The majority of bacterial enteropathogens are associated with self-limiting disease, and injudicious administration of antibiotics could be more harmful than beneficial [33] .",

Antibiotic therapy can potentially alter microbiota, cause gut bacterial overgrowth [34] , and deregulate defense against viruses. One study revealed that fecal bacteria isolated from sheltered cats were more frequently resistant than owned cats [35] . Multidrug-resistant salmonellosis to humans from cats has been reported in the U.S., where one of the foci of transmission was an animal shelter [36] . In that study's shelter, diarrheic cats were constantly treated with antibiotics, and Salmonella isolates were found to be resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethozole, and tetracycline [36] . The Ihno shelter was a prime candidate for harboring antibiotic resistant pathogens considering the amount of antibiotics used for treating cats with both diarrhea and URI.",

Administration of corticosteroids to cats at shelters is arguably contradicted not only because they are already stressed, but also because they tend to asymptomatically harbor FHV-1 and other viral pathogens. Interferon and antihistamines are ineffective in treating URI. Overall, indiscriminately treating the cats was ineffective, and reducing environmental stress in addition to development of and adherence to a standardized treatment protocol is by far a more important management strategy for controlling disease outbreaks. The mean number of days the cats had been symptomatic for both URI and diarrhea, and the incidence of both, was lower in 2012 compared to 2011. This may be related to the stationing of a full-time veterinarian in the later year, and treatment protocols were applied consistently (although not specifically standardized for a shelter setting). Although the vaccination and hygiene practices were sub-optimal, it was fortunate that there was no outbreak of feline panleukopenia infection at the Ihno shelter.",

High prevalences of diarrhea and URI were also common at other shelters due to stress, dietary changes and immunodeficiency [12, 37] [4, 7, 38, 39] . However, there is no evidence to date that shows that the diseases in this shelter were associated with radiation from the nuclear accident in Fukushima. The incidence of both diseases declined from 2011 to 2012. The possible reasons for this included: infrastructures were restored, environmental conditions in the affected area improved, there was less stress for both shelter staff and cats, there were more trained personnel for better care of cats, and housing conditions improved at the shelter. Although the high incidence of diarrhea and URI underscored the high stress levels of cats at this shelter, it was unfortunate that specific stress markers such as hormone levels, appetite, or body weight changes were unrecorded.",
