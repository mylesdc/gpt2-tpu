            "text": "Influenza A Virus (IAV) belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family, being segmented, single stranded, negative sense RNA viruses [1] . IAV caused at least three large-scale influenza outbreaks in the twentieth century, the most serious of which was the Spanish influenza outbreak in 1918, which caused more than 40 million deaths [2, 3] . More recently, the emergence and global spread of H1N1 influenza from the 2009 pandemic and recent lethal cases of H5N1 and H7N9 influenza demonstrate the limitations of currently available strategies to control influenza infection [4] . Currently, there are three main types of anti-IAV drugs approved for clinical use: (1) M2 ion channel inhibitors such as amantadine and rimantadine; (2) Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir [5, 6] ; (3) Polymerase inhibitors such as baloxavir. However, the emergence of drugresistant influenza variants such as amantadine and oseltamivir resistant IAV strains has led to a decline in the efficacy of these drugs. In addition, most of these anti-IAV drugs also have some side effects such as nervous system damage [7] [8] [9] . Therefore, new influenza therapeutics with novel mechanisms of action are urgently required to combat the persistent threat of influenza viruses.",

Briefly, 293FT cells were transfected with four expression plasmids encoding PR8 virus PB2, PB1, PA, and NP proteins, and the luciferase-containing plasmid vNS1luc/pHH21, which encodes a viral-like genome in the absence or presence of PA (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 \u03bcg/ml). The effect of vRNA transcription was then evaluated by measuring luciferase activity at 48 h p.i. The results showed that the positive drug nucleozin caused a notable reduction in luciferase activity at 10 \u03bcM as compared with control (DMSO) treatment (Fig. 2e) . By contrast, treatment with PA (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 \u03bcg/ml) did not significantly inhibit luciferase activity, suggesting that NP protein may be not the direct target of PA. In summary, virus HA, NA and NP proteins may not be the main targets of PA in vitro.",

Firstly, Vir09 virus (MOI = 1.0) infected A549 cells were added with 10 or 20 \u03bcg/mL of PA after virus adsorption and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. After that, viral NP protein expression was detected by immunofluorescence assay. As shown in Fig. 3a , in virus-infected cells without drug treatment, the fluorescence of viral NP proteins could be obviously found in both the cell nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 3a) , while nearly non fluorescence could be found in the noninfected cells (Fig. 3a) . However, after treatment with PA for 2 h, the number of virus antigen-expressing cells was drastically reduced, and only very few fluorescence could be found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3a) . Quantitation of data of the fluorescence intensity in IAV infected cells showed that PA treatment (5, 10 \u03bcg/mL) significantly reduced the fluorescence intensity of NP in A549 cells, suggesting that PA may block some steps of IAV life cycle after adsorption to interfering with nuclear import and expression of NP protein (Fig. 3b) . Moreover, the inhibition effect of PA on virus mRNA expression was then evaluated by Real-time RT-PCR assay. IAV (MOI = 1.0) infected cells were added with PA (10, 20, 40 \u03bcg/mL) after virus adsorption and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 8 h. After that, total RNA was extracted for real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3c , after treatment with PA (20, 40 \u03bcg/mL) for 8 h, the IAV NP mRNA levels decreased to about 36.6 and 14.2% of that of untreated cells after PA treatment, respectively, consistent to the results of immunofluorescence assay.",

The cellular PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was reported to be required for virus endocytosis and replication, and the inhibitors of PI3K/Akt signaling could inhibit both entry and replication of virus [21, 22] . In this study, after IAV infection for 2 h, the levels of phosphorylated PI3K proteins were significantly increased to about 1.3 fold higher than normal control group in IAV infected cells (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4a and e) .

Moreover, the activation of PI3K can induce the activation of some downstream signals such as Akt, and the level of phosphorylated Akt was truly significantly increased in virus-control group to about 4.5 fold higher than normal control group at 2 h p.i.

In this study, ERK1/2 protein was significantly activated in virus-control group to approximately 9.2 fold higher than normal control group at 2 h p.i. (P < 0.01) ( Fig. 4c and g). However, after treatment with PA (6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 \u03bcg/ml) for 2 h, the expression level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein significantly decreased from about 9.2 to about 6.0, 6.3, 5.9, and 5.3-fold of normal control group, respectively (P < 0.01) ( Fig. 4c and g) . However, treatment with PA (6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 \u03bcg/ml) for 2 h could not significantly reduce the expression level of phosphorylated NF-\u03baB protein as compared to the virus control group (Fig. 4d and h) . Thus, PA may inhibit ERK/MAPK rather than NF-\u03baB pathway to interfere with IAV replication. Moreover, the PI3K/Akt pathway was reported to be associated with host antiviral response [26, 27] , so we further explored the influence of PA on immune response by using western blot and ELISA assay. We first evaluate the direct actions of PA on cellular PI3K/Akt pathway in non-infected A549 cells using western blotting. The results showed that PA treatment (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 \u03bcg/ml) could not significantly influence the activation of PI3K and Akt proteins in the non-infected A549 cells ( Fig. 5a and b) , suggesting that the inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway by PA may be related to its inhibition of IAV infection. Treatment of PA for different time intervals within 24 h showed no significant cytotoxicity to noninfected A549 cells (Fig. 5c ). In addition, IAV infection significantly increased the production of cellular interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) in Vir09 virus infected A549 cells, however, PA treatment (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 \u03bcg/ml) could not significantly influence the production of IFN-\u03b2 as compared to the virus control group (Fig. 5d) , suggesting that PA had no direct action on cellular antiviral response. Furthermore, we also evaluated the influence of PA on the production of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) in mice with or without PR8 virus infection. As shown in Fig. 5e , intranasal treatment of PA (20 or 40 \u03bcg/day) for four days had no significant influence on the production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in non-infected mice.",

Subsequently, the pulmonary viral titers were determined by plaque assay [22] .

            "text": "Natural products from Chinese medicine have been attracting more and more attention of pharmacists. Patchouli alcohol (PA), a tricyclic sesquiterpene extracted from Pogostemonis Herba, was reported to possess anti-viral activities against different viruses especially influenza virus [14] [15] [16] . In the current study, we found that PA could inhibit different influenza A virus replication in vitro, and the pandemic H1N1 virus (Vir09) was most susceptible to PA treatment (IC 50 < 6.5 \u03bcg/ml). Intranasal administration of PA significantly promoted the survival rate of mice and attenuated pneumonia symptoms in IAV infected mice, comparable to the positive control drug Oseltamivir. Thus, Patchouli alcohol merits further investigation as a novel anti-IAV agent in the future. The time-of-addition assay indicated that pretreatment of IAV with PA before infection or addition of PA during adsorption markedly reduced virus multiplication (Fig. 2) , suggesting that PA may have direct inactivation effects on IAV particles. PA was reported to inhibit H2N2 virus replication mainly through inhibition of the functions of virus neuraminidase [16] . However, in contrast to the previous studies, we found that PA could not significantly inhibit the NA activity of H1N1 virus, and did not significantly block HA mediated aggregation of chicken red blood cells. Thus, PA may be not able to directly bind to virus surface proteins but may interfere with the interaction between IAV and cell receptors. Interestingly, post-treatment of cells with PA after adsorption also dramatically inhibited virus multiplication, suggesting that PA may also block some stages after virus adsorption.",

Some inhibitors of PI3K or its downstream signal Akt could significantly block virus entry and replication [20] [21] [22] . Herein, Patchouli alcohol was found to be able to significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt proteins in IAV-infected cells (Fig. 5) , suggesting that PA may inhibit the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to block virus infection and replication. However, PA could not influence the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway in non-infected A549 cells and could not directly enhance the interferon system in vitro, suggesting that the inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway by PA may be related to its inhibition of IAV infection rather than direct actions on host antiviral response. Moreover, the MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways were reported to be required for efficient vRNP export from nucleus and virus RNA synthesis, and the inhibitors of MAPK pathway could reduce both IAV replication and inflammatory symptoms [23] [24] [25] . In this study, PA significantly reduced the activation of ERK1/2 rather than NF-\u03baB in IAV infected cells, suggesting that ERK/MAPK rather than NF-\u03baB pathway may be involved in the anti-IAV actions of PA. Considered that PA could significantly inhibit virus mRNA and protein expression in IAV infected cells, we posit that PA may interfere with the activation of PI3K/Akt and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways, thus inhibiting the invasion and subsequent replication of IAV.",
