In virus-producing cells, IFITMs coalesce with forming virions and are incorporated into viral particles. Expression of IFITMs during virion assembly leads to the production of virion particles of decreased infectivity that are mostly affected during entry in target cells. This mechanism of inhibition is exerted against different retroviruses and does not seem to be dependent on the type of Envelope present on retroviral particles.",

These results raise the possibility that IFITMs could similarly affect distinct steps of the life cycle of a number of other viruses.",

Of these, IFITM1, \u22122 and \u22123 have emerged as broadacting restriction factors capable of interfering with the replication of a number of viruses including Filoviruses, Coronaviruses, Influenza virus, Dengue virus and the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . To stress the importance that IFITMs play in the control of viral infection, IFITM3 knockout mice display increased mortality and viral burden following influenza A virus challenge [8, 13] and a specific polymorphism in the IFITM3 allele has been associated to increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection in humans [13, 14] .",

Interestingly, this mechanism of inhibition seems to be active against both pH-dependent and -independent viruses that require or not the low pH of endosomes to trigger viral-to-cell membrane fusion [22, 23] .

Therefore, we explored the role that IFITMs may play in HIV-1 producing cells. The results we have obtained indicate that IFITMs coalesce with the structural protein Gag and are incorporated into HIV-1 viral particles both in established cell lines, as well as in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Virions incorporating IFITMs display decreased infectivity when compared to HIV-1 wild type particles in single round infection assays and a similar inhibition is observed for different retroviruses and Envelope (Env) pseudotypes. Virions incorporating IFITMs display a defect at the step of viral entry into target cells that well correlates with the infectivity defect measured here.",

This dual mechanism of inhibition may be similarly exerted against other viruses. Figure 1 Expression of IFITMs in virus producing cells affects the production of infectious HIV-1 viral particles. A) Representation of the experimental scheme used here. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with DNAs coding for single round infection-competent HIV-1 expressing GFP along with DNAs coding Flag-IFITMs. Virions were purified by ultracentrifugation through a 25% sucrose cushion, normalized by exogenous-RT (exo-RT) and used to challenge HeLaP4 or HEK293T cells bearing the appropriate HIV-1 receptors. Viral infectivity was measured 3 days later by flow cytometry in the case of GFP-coding viruses or 24 hours later by \u03b2-gal assay in the case of a complete NL4-3 proviral DNA (thanks to the HIV-1 LTR-\u03b2-gal reporter integrated in HeLaP4 cells). B) Typical FACS profiles obtained after this procedure. C) Normalized infectivity of viral particles obtained after flow cytometry analysis (left graph) or MAGI assay (right graph).

E) As above, except that distinct retroviral vectors pseudotyped with VSVg and coding GFP were analyzed. F) As above, except that HIV-1 vectors bearing the indicated envelope were used to challenge the indicated target cells prior to flow cytometry analysis 3 days after infection.

The transfected DNAs coded the HIV-1 Gag-Pol plus non-structural viral proteins, the indicated envelope, as well as a miniviral genome bearing a GFP expression cassette, except where a complete provirus was used, as indicated. Two days after transfection, supernatants were pre-cleared by centrifugation at low speed, then by filtration through a 0,45 \u03bcm syringe filter and were lastly purified by ultracentrifugation through a 25% sucrose cushion. Under these conditions, expression of IFITMs induced only a minor defect of virus production, as quantified by exogenous-RT activity (exo-RT, Additional file 1: Figure S1A ). To focus solely on the infectivity defect of retrieved viral particles, virions were normalized by exo-RT and then used to challenge either HeLaP4 cells stably expressing the HIV receptor/co-receptor CD4/CXCR4, prior to flow cytometry 3 days afterwards (a typical FACS profile is presented in Figure 1B ). Virions produced in the presence of the different IFITMs displayed reduced infectivity over wild type ones (70% to 75% reduction over a single round infection assay, Figure 1C , left graph). To determine whether this defect could be observed using a WT HIV-1 clone (NL4-3, a widely used proviral clone), the same experimental system was used on viruses produced by transfection of HEK293T cells with NL4-3 and IFITMs. Upon exo-RT normalization, virions were used to challenge HeLaP4 cells and viral infectivity was measured by \u03b2-galactosidase assay (MAGI) 24 hours afterwards, taking advantage of the HIV-1-LTR-\u03b2-Gal reporter stably integrated in these cells ( Figure 1C , right graph).

This assay takes advantage of a technique developed by the Ott lab that is based on the fact that CD45 is incorporated in exosomes, but is excluded from retroviral particles [31] . Given that CD45 is a T cell marker, we first obtained stable cell lines expressing each IFITM in SupT1 cells and then infected these cells with high MOIs of HIV-1 to obtain a large number of virion producing cells. Virion particles were then retrieved 6 days after and were then treated with CD45magnetic beads or not prior to WB analysis ( Figure 2E ).

            "text": "To determine how IFITMs could be embarked into HIV-1 viral particles, we analyzed the degree of intracellular co-localization existing between IFITMs and Gag, the main structural element of retroviral particles. To this end, cells were transfected as above in the presence of a small amount of Gag-GFP, prior to confocal microscopy analysis ( Figure 3A and B). As previously reported, all IFITMs were found at the plasma membrane, although more specific patterns could be observed for individual IFITMs (more prominent intracellular localization of IFITM2 and higher cell membrane distribution of IFITM1). HIV-1 Gag displayed an heterogeneous and mostly punctuate intracellular localization pattern, as extensively reported by others [32] and not surprisingly the two signals overlapped at least partially ( Figure 3B , depicts a two-dimensional graph presenting pixel intensities for the cells presented above). The degree of reciprocal colocalization between Gag and IFITMs was more carefully quantified by measuring the Manders overlap coefficient ( Figure 3C ). From 50 to 65% of IFITMs was found to co-localize with Gag and about 70% of Gag co-localized with IFITMs, which is overall not surprising in light of the natural intracellular distribution of these proteins. No major relocalization of either IFITMs or Gag was noted upon co-expression, indicating that these proteins are unlikely to influence the trafficking of each other. So, overall this analysis indicates that in light of their natural membrane distribution, IFITMs can find themselves at sites in which HIV-1 virion particles assembly takes place, providing a reason for their incorporation in HIV-1 virions.",

This analysis indicated a certain level of cross-recognition between antibodies (particularly with the anti-IFITM2 and \u22123 antibodies). For this reason, we decided to detect the endogenous expression of IFITMs using a pool of the 3 antibodies. We first determined the pattern of expression of IFITMs in different established cell lines and primary cells ( Figure 4A ). Given that IFITMs are interferon-stimulated genes, these cells were also stimulated for 24 hours with 1000 U/mL of IFN\u03b1. The basal expression of IFITMs varied among cell types and was undetectable in HEK293T cells, unless IFN\u03b1 was provided. HeLa cells expressed instead robust levels of IFITMs even in the absence of IFN\u03b1, although this stimulus further increased their expression. Similarly, the primary human cells examined here expressed undetectable/ low amounts of IFITMs under standard conditions, but expression of IFITMs was robustly induced by IFN\u03b1 stimulation. This trend was reproducibly observed in four distinct donors, although the basal levels of expression of IFITMs displayed clear donor-to donor variations.",

As expected, when virion particles produced at different days after infection were examined, IFITMs were incorporated into HIV-1 particles proportionally to their intracellular levels of expression. Of note, only a limited virus production was observed at day 3 post infection, as expected from the low levels of replication ongoing at this early time point. Virus production was however more robust at later time points, so that the intrinsic infectivity of virions produced from MDM at day 6 and 9 could be assessed after a MAGI assay on HeLaP5 cells. Under these conditions, virions obtained at day 6 displayed higher infectivity than viruses obtained at day 9, in agreement with the higher incorporation of IFITMs in the latter.",

Given that the antibodies in our hands did not distinguish between IFITM members anti-IFITM1, \u22122 and \u22123 antibodies were used together, so that all three forms are recognized. B) HEK293T and HeLaP4 cells were transfected with DNAs coding HIV-1-gfp and twenty-four hours later cells were stimulated with 1000U/mL of IFN\u03b1 for further two days.

C) Primary macrophages obtained upon differentiation of monocytes in M-CSF for 4 days were challenged with an MOI of 0,1 of the R5-tropic HIV-1 strain ADA.

Cells and virion particles were harvested at the indicated time points after infection. Virion particles obtained from day 6 and 9 were normalized by exo-RT activity, while the amount of virus obtained at day 3 was too low to be quantified further. Exo-RT normalized virions obtained at day 6 and 9 were used to challenge HeLaP5 cells for a MAGI assay. The graph presents a typical replication curve obtained upon infection of ADA in primary MDM and the dotted line represents the limit of detection of the assay. All WB panels present representative results obtained out of 3 to 5 independent experiments and donors, while the graphs present averages and SEM of 3 independent experiments. competent ADA at an MOI of 1 prior to extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment. Viral particles produced by knockdown cells were then harvested 4 to 6 days after and upon exo-RT normalization, viruses were used on HeLaP5 cells (expressing the CCR5 co-receptor) for a MAGI assay ( Figure 5B ). Under these conditions, viruses produced in MDM silenced for IFITMs displayed a remarkable increase in their infectivity over a single round infection assay, confirming the positive effect that the removal of IFITMs plays on the infectivity of viral particles. Of note, the basal expression of IFITMs was higher in miR30-shRNA transduced MDM, irrespectively of the target sequence, when compared to untreated cells (for example, compare the basal levels of expression observed here with the one of Figure 4A ). We believe this is due to the detection of the HIV vectors used for silencing, or to the detection of its end products, ie double stranded RNAs, as described in [40] [41] [42] . However, since equal conditions were used for control and specific knockdowns, we believe this not to be a confounding factor in the analysis of the results.",

Silenced cells were challenged with replication competent NL4-3 and viral replication was monitored through the accumulation of exo-RT in the culture supernatants at different days post infection. Under these conditions, viral replication was increased by IFITMs silencing in both IFN-stimulated and unstimulated conditions over control silenced cells, indicating that IFITMs may provide already a basal level of resistance even in non stimulated Jurkat T cells. Given that in addition to the direct decrease in viral particles infectivity that we describe here, IFITMs have been previously described to affect the entry of HIV-1 when expressed in target cells [9] and given that the assay of spreading infection does not allow the distinction between these two effects, viral particles retrieved at the end of the culture were normalized by exo-RT activity and used to challenge HeLaP4 cells to determine their intrinsic infectivity in a single round infection assay ( Figure 5D ). Under these conditions, the infectivity of viral particles produced in IFITM-knockdown cells was higher than the one of viruses produced in control cells and this increase was of 1,6 fold in unstimulated Jurkat cells, but reached 5 fold in IFN-stimulated cells, suggesting again that IFITMs do play an antiviral role in Jurkat cells that is exacerbated upon IFN stimulation. Of note, we have already determined that IFN\u03b1 does not influence the early phases of infection in HeLa cells [43] , so that its presence is unlikely to be a confounding factor in the determination of the infectivity of viral particles in this cell type. Overall, these results further strengthen the notion that IFITMs negatively interfere with the infectivity of HIV-1 viral particles and do so in different cell types in which they are naturally expressed.",

After 2 hours, cells were treated with trypsin to remove extracellular virus and the amount of intracellular p24 was determined by ELISA. Under these conditions, all IFITMs-HIV-1 particles presented an entry defect, indicating that IFITMs interfered with the ability of virion particles to enter target cells (from 40% to 70% Figure 6B ). To further support this argument, viruses were produced in the presence of Vpr-Blam. This protein is incorporated into virion particles and is released in the cytoplasm of target cells after viral-to-cell membrane fusion where it can cleave a fluorescent dye [44] . When viral particles incorporating Vpr-Blam were analyzed a similar decrease in entry was measured for virions incorporating IFITMs as compared to WT ( Figure 6C , from 50 to 70%). Although this defect appeared more pronounced in the case of IFITM2 than of IFITM1/3, this difference did not reach statistical significance.",

So far, IFITMs have been essentially studied in the context of target cells, where their overexpression induces a strong antiviral phenotype by trapping incoming viral particles in endosomes. This antiviral activity is broad and targets, albeit with different efficiency, a large panel of viruses including HIV-1 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Here, we report that the presence of IFITMs in virus producing cells leads to the production of virions of decreased infectivity. In light of the largely membrane distribution of the different IFITMs their incorporation into retroviral particles is not surprising. The diverse spectrum of envelopes and of retroviruses on which IFITMs exert similar effects leads us the hypothesize that this mechanism of inhibition does not target a specific viral domain, but rather takes advantage of the manner in which HIV and more generally retroviruses assemble. In this respect, the membrane distribution of IFITMs strongly suggests that passive incorporation is the most plausible explanation for their packaging in retroviral particles. This incorporation does not seem to occur to the detriment of the one of Env, as IFITMs do not modify the Env to Gag ratio of virion particles (data not shown).",

Media was replaced 12 hours after transfection and viral supernatants were collected 48 hours after. Supernatants were first centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 minutes, then filtered through a 0,45 \u03bcm syringe-filter, prior to purification by ultracentrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 2 hours through a 25% (w/v) sucrose cushion. After ultracentrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in DMEM and normalized by either exogenous-RT activity or by an in-house anti-p24 ELISA, as described [39] . Viral infectivity was determined 3 days after cell challenge by flow cytometry analysis (in the case of GFP-coding vectors) or 24 hours PI by \u03b2-gal assay in HeLaP4 cells (stably expressing the CD4/CXCR4 receptors plus an HIV-1-LTR-\u03b2-gal reporter cassette, obtained through the CelluloNet facility of the UMS3444 Biosciences Gerland) with replicationcompetent HIV-1.

Briefly, selfinactivating (SIN) lentivectors were produced by cotransfection of HEK293T cells using a viral genome bearing a miR30-shRNAs-Puromycin cassette (a mixture of two target sequences per gene was used). Virions were then purified and normalized by exo-RT, so that an identical viral input was used to challenge target cells with control or with the overall pool of IFITM1,2,3 specific miR30-shRNAs. The silencing procedure was then adapted experimentally for each cell type to reach the best possible compromise between high silencing efficiency and optimal cell survival. In the case of HeLaP4 cells, after a short Puromycin selection (4 days), cells were seeded and used as virus producing cells. To this end, cells were challenged with an MOI of 1 of replication competent HIV-1 (NL4-3) to obtain a substantial fraction of virus-producing cells. After extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment to remove non-internalized virus, cells were seeded and newly produced viruses were harvested 2 to 3 days afterwards from the supernatant of knockdown cells. Virions were normalized by exo-RT and used to challenge na\u00efve HeLaP4 cells. The amount of infectious viral particles present in the different preparations was then assessed 24 hours later following a MAGI assay on these cells. For silencing experiments in primary macrophages, cells were similarly transduced in the presence of virion-like particles containing Vpx (VLPs-Vpx provided at an MOIequivalent of 0,5) that increase the overall transduction efficiency of lentiviruses in human myeloid cells by removing a restriction at reverse transcription, according to a well-established protocol [39] . In this case, silenced cells were used in the absence of Puromycin selection and were challenged with an MOI of 1 of the R5 tropic replicationcompetent ADA. After extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment, virions were harvested 4 to 6 days afterwards and similarly normalized by exo-RT prior to challenge of HeLaP5 cells (expressing the CCR5 co-receptor) and MAGI assay. In the case of Jurkat cells, silenced cells were kept in Puromycin selection and used in replicative infections using the NL4-3 virus. Aliquots of the cell supernatant were harvested at different time points and the extent of viral spread was assessed by exo-RT activity. To determine the intrinsic infectivity of viral particles produced in Jurkat cells treated as mentioned in the text, viral particles were retrieved at day 9 post infection to obtain sufficient amount of virus for our analysis, then viral preparations were normalized by exo-RT activity and used to challenge na\u00efve HeLaP4 reporter cells. The infectivity of normalized viral particles was then determined by a MAGI assay 24 hours later.",

A) To determine the intracellular distribution of IFITMs and Gag, HEK293T cells were transfected as mentioned above with the addition of a small amount of an HIV-1 Gag-GFP fusion protein (1/10 of WT Gag-Pol). Cells were then fixed 24 hours after and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Representative panels of more than 100 cells per condition are shown here. Scale bars: 10 \u03bcm. B) Co-localization corresponding to the yellow lines of (A) was performed using the Plot Profile tool in Image-J. C) The extent of reciprocal co-localization of IFITMs and Gag was quantified using the Manders overlap coefficient (Fuji image software). D) HEK293T cells co-transfected with IFITM3 and HIV-1 were analyzed by immuno-gold labeling with anti-p24 and anti-Flag antibodies (5 and 10 nm beads, respectively, as indicated). Negative controls consisted of cells transfected with control DNA. Scale bars: 200 nm. All panels present typical results obtained out of 2 to 3 independent experiments.",

HIV-1 vectors coding for control (Luciferase) or IFITMs specific target sequences were obtained by DNA transfection of HEK293T cells, normalized and used on target cells. A) HeLaP4 were shortly selected with Puromycin (present in the vector) and then challenged with an MOI of 1 of replication competent HIV-1 virus (NL4-3) to obtain a large proportion of virus producing cells. After cell washing and trypsin treatment, newly produced viruses were recovered 2-3 days afterwards and virions and cell lysates were examined by WB at this time. The infectivity of exo-RT normalized virions was determined on HeLaP4 cells by MAGI assay. B) To improve silencing efficiency in MDM, vectors were used along with an MOI-equivalent of 0,5 of VLPs-Vpx. Three days after, MDM were challenged with an MOI of 1 of replication competent ADA virus, prior to extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment. Newly produced viral particles were retrieved 4 to 6 days after and their infectivity determined after exo-RT normalization on HeLaP5 cells. C) Knockdown Jurkat cells were obtained as in A. Cells were then challenged with an MOI of 0,1 of replication competent NL4-3 and spreading infections were analyzed by harvesting aliquots of the culture supernatant at different times post infection. Viral spread was determined by exo-RT activity. D) The intrinsic infectivity of viral particles was determined as above on the supernatants of cells obtained 9 days post infection. WB panels present knockdowns obtained for the different cell types and the graph presents averages and SEM obtained in 3 to 4 independent experiments and donors. *; statistically significant difference after a Student t test: p \u2264 0,05.
