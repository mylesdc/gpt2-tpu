In this study, we identified a fully human H1N1 neutralizing antibody (32D6) via an Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cell-based technology. 32D6 specifically neutralizes the clinically isolated H1N1 strains after the 2009 pandemic but not the earlier strains. The epitope was identified through X-ray crystallographic analysis of the 32D6-Fab/HA1 complex structure, which revealed a unique loop conformation located on the top surface of HA. The major region is composed of two peptide segments (residues 172-177 and 206-213), which form an abreast loop conformation. The residue T262 between the two loops forms a conformational epitope for recognition by 32D6. Three water molecules were observed at the interface of HA and the heavy chain, and they may constitute a stabilizing element for the 32D6-HA association. In addition, each 32D6-Fab is likely capable of blocking one HA trimer. This study provides important information on the strain specificity of 32D6 for the therapeutic treatment and detection of viral infection.",

            "text": "Influenza is a contagious acute respiratory disease caused by the influenza virus infection. It causes mild to severe illness, and it can, at times, lead to death 1, 2 . Most people who contract influenza will recover in several days to less than two weeks, but some people will develop complications. Annual epidemics result in a high number of hospitalizations, with an estimated 3-5 million severe cases and 250,000-500,000 deaths globally. Young children, adults aged 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain chronic diseases are among those who are at high risk of serious flu complications, which possibly require hospitalization and sometimes result in death 1, 2 . Influenza A infection accounts for the majority of hospitalizations, and it is the only type that causes global pandemic outbreaks (https://www.who.int/). Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the viral surface: the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA). There are 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes (H1-H18) and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes (N1-N11) 3 . The HA molecule initiates infection by binding to receptors on specific host cells. The NA possesses receptor destroying activity, cleaving terminal sialic acid residues from cell-surface glycoproteins and gangliosides to release progeny virus from the host cell. Both are important targets for influenza virus therapeutic treatment and diagnostic detection. Influenza viruses are constantly changing in two different ways: antigenic drift and antigenic shift. Antigenic drift is a mechanism for viruses that accumulate mutations within the genes that occur continually over time as the virus replicates. These changes of HA protein allows the virus to escape the pre-existing immunity in the hosts 1 . Antigenic shift is a sudden change in the antigenicity of influenza A virus. Antigenic shift can be the result of a direct jump from an unknown animal strain to humans or a reassortment of two or more influenza viruses within the same cell. It results in a new virus with the HA or the HA-NA combination that has emerged from an animal population so different from the same subtype in humans that most people do not have immunity to the new virus. Such new viruses may cause pandemics 4 . Antigenic drift occurs in all types of influenza viruses. Antigenic shift, however, occurs only in flu A because it infects more than just human. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza infection. It has moderate efficacy, good safety, and acceptable tolerability. However, vaccines lack cross-protection and exhibit unsatisfactory efficacy in some high-risk populations, including older people, young children and immunocompromised patients. In addition to vaccines, the general treatment and prophylaxis of influenza is limited to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) 5, 6 . The confirmed cases of influenza infection can be treated with both zanamivir and oseltamivir, and if administered within 36 to 48 h of the onset of clinical symptoms, both drugs reduce the duration of illness by 1-1.5 days in patients of all ages. Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) is a novel selective inhibitor against influenza cap-dependent endonuclease of influenza A and B viruses and has been approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in people 12 years of age and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48 hours 7 . However, influenza A virus rapidly acquired resistance against drugs by mutating these viral components. During the 2008-2009 season, over 99% of the H1N1 isolates were resistant to oseltamivir in the United States, Japan, and South Africa 8 . In addition, two influenza A (H3N2) viruses carrying an I38T substitution in the polymerase acidic subunit (PA) show the reduced susceptibility to baloxavir 9 . Patients infected with baloxavir-resistant viruses exhibited prolonged virus shedding, and the median time to symptom alleviation was longer in baloxavir recipients infected with viruses bearing these substitutions than in those infected with viruses that lacked these substitutions 7, 10 . Because of the emergence of drug resistance, short treatment windows for antiviral drugs, and the unsatisfactory efficacy of currently available vaccines, there is an unmet medical need for influenza therapy.",

Recently, several studies have shown that influenza-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved epitopes of influenza virus might offer an alternative treatment. Passive immunotherapy using anti-influenza antibodies has the potential to prevent and treat influenza. Ideally, neutralizing antibodies exhibit a potent effect in direct viral neutralization and induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and complement-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro or in vivo. In this study, we identified a human anti-H1N1 (influenza A virus A/ California/7/2009 NYMCX-179A) neutralizing antibody via an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized B cell-based technology. It interacts specifically with the HA head portion of H1N1 after 2009. We further characterized the mode of binding by analyzing the complex crystal structure of the fragment for antigen-binding (Fab) and the antigen.",

As shown in Fig. 1c , 32D6 showed strong neutralization ability against the H1N1 virus. The profile of 32D6 neutralization activity against H1N1 also turned out to be hyperbolic, from which a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.036 \u03bcg/mL was calculated (Fig. 1d) .

The complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are well defined 11 ; the light-chain CDR loops are composed of residues 23-34 (CDR-L1), 47-53 (CDR-L2) and 93-100 (CDR-L3), and the CDRs of the heavy chain are composed of residues 26-37 (CDR-H1), 52-60 (CDR-H2) and 100-113 (CDR-H3) (Fig. 3b ).",

The paratope on 32D6 consists of all three heavy-chain CDRs and two light-chain CDRs (L-CDR1 and L-CDR3). L-CDR2 shows no interaction with the antigen. The heavy chain and the light chain have surface areas of 590 \u00c5 2 buried upon the complex formation. Figure 3b shows the interface interactions between 32D6-Fab and the influenza virus HA. The side-chain hydroxyl groups from three tyrosine residues (Y35, Y102 and Y109) and the side-chain oxygen atom from T58 in the heavy-chain CDRs provide strong hydrogen bonds to interact with the residues N211, D213 and T262 on the HA molecule.

In this study, we isolated the human antibody 32D6, which is specific to the H1N1 influenza virus A/California/7/2009, and showed that 32D6 is effective in neutralizing several different isolates after the 2009 pandemic (also known as swine flu). By combining the biochemical and biophysical data with the X-ray crystallographic analysis, a good structural basis is laid down for the strain specificity of 32D6. It turned out that some mutations on the epitope surface do not affect the 32D6 binding. The finding that these mutations cannot escape the antibody binding and the elucidation of the specific epitope-CDR interactions should be useful for the detection and treatment of influenza virus infection.",

The antibody clone 32D6 was chosen as the lead clone based on its potency. (b) 32D6 recognized H1N1, but not H5N1 and H7N9. Inactivated H1N1 (NYMC XA), H5N1 (NIBRG-14M6) and H7N9 (NIBRG-268) viruses were coated on 96-well plates. The binding intensity of serial diluted 32D6 mAbs were examined via ELISA. (c) The neutralizing activity of the 32D6 antibody against H1N1 (A/Taiwan/80813/2013), H3N2 (A/ Victoria/361/2011), H5N1 (NIBRG-14M6) and H7N9 (NIBRG-268) were examined via a neutralization assay based on a high-content image system. (d) The neutralization EC50 value of 32D6 against H1N1 (A/ Taiwan/80813/2013) is 0.036 \u03bcg/ml. (e) The binding kinetics of 32D6 toward HA of H1N1 was measured using the Biacore systems.
