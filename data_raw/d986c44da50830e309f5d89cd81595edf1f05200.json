This disease presents additional challenges to human and veterinary health authorities given the zoonotic nature of the pathogens responsible for the disease across species. One of the main public health challenges regarding zoonotic TB (ZTB) caused by Mycobacterium bovis is that the true incidence of this type of TB in humans is not known and is likely to be underestimated. To effectively address challenges posed by ZTB, an integrated One Health approach is needed. In this manuscript, we describe the rationale, major steps, timeline, stakeholders, and important events that led to the assembling of a true integrated multi-institutional and interdisciplinary team that accomplished the ambitious goal of developing a ZTB roadmap, published in October, 2017. It outlines key activities to address the global challenges regarding the prevention, surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment of ZTB. We discuss and emphasize the importance of integrated approaches to be able to accomplish the short (year 2020) and medium term (year 2025) goals outlined in the ZTB roadmap.",

Recent outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging zoonoses [i.e., Zika, Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Avian and Swine Influenza] (1) have heightened the public's awareness about the close and complex interrelationship between the health of humans, wildlife species, and domestic animals. Tuberculosis (TB), is one such disease that continues to have devastating consequences for not only humans, but also cattle and several wildlife species (2) (3) (4) (5) . Caused by bacteria belonging to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), TB presents additional challenges to human and veterinary health authorities given the zoonotic nature of the pathogens responsible for the disease and the ability of MTBC agents to be shared across species (4, 5) . TB in humans is caused primarily by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb); worldwide, it is the leading cause of death in humans by an infectious disease (2) . Bovine TB caused by Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) is widely distributed around the world (3, 6) and continues to cause considerable economic losses to farmers and countries due to the reduced production of affected animals, culling of animals from herds (or entire herd depopulation in some cases), and the elimination of affected (or all) parts of animal carcasses at slaughter (7) .",

The Union's ZTB sub-section is a global network of physicians, veterinarians, researchers, economists and social anthropologists that works to understand the dynamics of ZTB, create global awareness, and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration to address the challenges posed by it. Efforts conducted by the ZTB sub-section has led to a continuous and stable increase in the number of activities, attention, and attendees to ZTB-related activities at the annual Union World Conference on Lung Health. For example, at the 2010 conference in Berlin, Germany, there was only one ZTB session (symposium) attended by less than 10 people. Over the last seven years, the ZTB activities at the annual conference have increased to two scientific symposia, one poster session, one meet the expert session, press releases, and a keynote talk on ZTB at the plenary session in South Africa during the 2015 conference. During the last conference in Guadalajara, Mexico in October 2017, an audience of approximately 75 professionals from different disciplines attended each of the two ZTB scientific symposia.",

Sharing of human resources, equipment and transport across sectors can reduce operational costs. This increased cost-effectiveness is especially relevant given the public funding constraints that often exist in settings where people are most at risk of zoonotic TB. For example, outreach childhood immunization campaigns or other existing livestock vaccination or testing programmes conducted in rural communities could be used to concurrently deliver educational and behavior change messages about food safety, to test livestock for bovine TB or, potentially in the future, to implement livestock vaccination campaigns against bovine TB. Interventions must be tailored to the cultural and socioeconomic characteristics of each setting.

Table 1 is an excerpt from the ZTB Roadmap in which the short (year 2020) and medium term (year 2025) milestones to be accomplished are outlined under the three core themes of the roadmap. One of the key elements toward accomplishing these goals is that the unique cultural and socioeconomic factors that shape the relationship between people, livestock, and wildlife species in different ecosystems must be taken into account, while including the at-risk communities in future efforts to reduce the risk of zoonotic transmission of M. bovis across species. These efforts not only need to focus on preventing transmission from livestock (mostly cattle) to humans, but also, and in parallel, to reduce the prevalence of the disease in both domestic and wildlife species. The availability of improved diagnostic tools for ZTB in different species, as well as the implementation of disease monitoring, surveillance, and prevention strategies in livestock and wildlife species will be a crucial and much needed component to be able to implement comprehensive programs that will account for the complexities ZTB poses due to its zoonotic nature. Finally, including vaccination of wildlife (where feasible), not only has the potential for reducing the burden of disease, but also could play an important role in conservation efforts, especially among endangered and protected species.",
