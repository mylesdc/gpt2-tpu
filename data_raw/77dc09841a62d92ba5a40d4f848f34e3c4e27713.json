We showed that the estimates of agespecific infection attack rates were similar when different contact matrices from the POLYMOD study were used. To investigate whether the IAR estimates are sensitive to the difference between Hong Kong contact data and European contact data, we replicated the study with Hong Kong contact data from this study.",
