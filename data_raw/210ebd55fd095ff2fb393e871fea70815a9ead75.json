            "text": "Background: Goatpox is an economically important disease in goat and sheep-producing areas of the world. Many vaccine strategies developed to control the disease are not yet completely successful. Hairpin expression vectors have been used to induce gene silencing in a large number of studies on viruses. However, none of these studies has been attempted to study GTPV. In the interest of exploiting improved methods to control goat pox, it is participated that RNAi may provide effective protection against GTPV. In this study we show the suppression of Goatpox virus (GTPV) replication via knockdown of virion core protein using RNA interference. Results: Four short interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences (siRNA-61, siRNA-70, siRNA-165 and siRNA-296) against a region of GTPV ORF095 were selected. Sense and antisense siRNA-encoding sequences separated by a hairpin loop sequence were designed as short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassettes under the control of a human U6 promoter. ORF095 amplicon was generated using PCR, and then cloned into pEGFP-N1 vector, named as p095/ EGFP. p095/EGFP and each of the siRNA expression cassettes (p61, p70, p165 and p296) were co-transfected into BHK-21 cells. Fluorescence detection, flow cytometric analysis, retro transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and real time PCR were used to check the efficiency of RNAi. The results showed that the ORF095-specific siRNA-70 effectively downregulated the expression of ORF095. When Vero cells were transfected with shRNA expression vectors (p61/GFP, p70/GFP, p165/GFP and p296/GFP) and then infected with GTPV, GTPV-ORF095-70 was found to be the most effective inhibition site in decreasing cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by GTPV. The results presented here indicated that DNA-based siRNA could effectively inhibit the replication of GTPV (approximately 463. 5-fold reduction of viral titers) on Vero cells. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that vector-based shRNA methodology can effectively inhibit GTPV replication on Vero cells. Simultaneously, this work represents a strategy for controlling goatpox, potentially facilitating new experimental approaches in the analysis of both viral and cellular gene functions during of GTPV infection.",

Both sheeppox and goatpox are endemic in Africa, the Middle East and many countries in Asia, and the diseases caused by these viruses have a significant economic impact on the livestock industry in Africa and Asia [2] . GTPV genome is approximately 150 kbp double-stranded DNA, which composes at least 147 putative genes, including conserved replicative and structural genes and genes likely involved in virulence and host range [3] . ORF095 encodes the virion protein which constitutes a great part of the total protein content of the virion and is essential during the assembly and disassembly of virion. It is similar to myxoma virus (MYXV) M093L (accession no.AF170726) [4, 5] and vaccinia virus (VACV) A4L (accession no.M35027) that encodes a 39 kDa acidic protein, a part of the viral core, and is synthesized at late stages after infection [6, 7] .",

Additionally, expression of the housekeeping gene \u03b2-actin was also analyzed by RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR, and no significant difference in the expression of \u03b2-actin was observed between the siRNAs treatment groups and pC treatment groups. Different siRNA sequences display widely different efficacies with regard to suppression of gene expression, requiring screening of multiple sequences [37] . In this research, we have selected four target sequences for RNA interference by the software applications, \"siRNA Target Finder and Design Tool\" available at http://www.ambion. com/. As the ORF095 gene is well conserved in GTPV and ORF095 protein is a virion core protein and assembly protein in GTPV, we selected ORF095 as a target gene. In order to generate shRNA expression cassettes quickly and accurately, we employed a PCR-based strategy to clone siRNA sequences. In this strategy, siRNA sequences were designed as a single primer sequence of which 19 bp complementary to the human U6 promoter were added. The resulting PCR products are shRNA expression cassettes including the human U6 promoter. shRNAs that have been generated from this expression system are efficiently processed by dicer into siRNAs. In addition, in this study, we selected pEGFP-N1 vector that contains an EGFP gene as report gene and can be transfected into mammalian cells using any standard transfection method.",
