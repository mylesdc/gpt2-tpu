Surveillance of Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) represent an important tool for tracking trends of virus spread and changes in globally circulating influenza viruses [5] . The first pandemic of the 21 st century caused by influenza virus A/H1N1pdm09 demonstrated the importance of influenza surveillance worldwide. The monitoring of changes in seasonal influenza viruses plays a critical role in defining influenza vaccine composition [6, 7] . Moreover, data obtained from surveillance systems enables healthcare authorities to better understand timings of influenza activity and consequent mobilization of resources (e.g. vaccines, antivirals), notably prioritized vaccination of risk groups among other measures. However, limited data are available on influenza morbidity and mortality in Georgia [8] [9] [10] and none of these publications describe antigenic and genetic characteristics of seasonal influenza viruses circulating in the country. Georgia is located in the Caucasus region and covers a territory of 69700 km 2 with a population of around 3.7 million people. Prior to 2006, a nationwide population-based surveillance system for influenza and upper respiratory tract infection provided influenza data based only on clinical diagnosis without laboratory confirmation. In 2007, in collaboration with US CDC and other international stakeholders, sentinel surveillance of ILI and SARI was initiated. The National Influenza Center (NIC) at the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health, Georgia (NCDC&PH) now screens specimens collected at ILI/SARI surveillance sites all year round to monitor activity of influenza viruses.",

The Children's Central Hospital, the largest children's clinic of the country also in Tbilisi, and four hospitals in Kutaisi (the biggest city in Western Georgia) were selected as SARI surveillance sites (S1 Fig). Medical staff and epidemiologists at each site were trained on case definitions, specimen collection, storage and transportation, completion of individual patient questionnaires and ILI/SARI aggregated forms. and influenza viruses from various countries, were downloaded from the EpiFlu database of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (http://www.gisaid.org). Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were aligned and analyzed using BioEdit (http://www. mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html) and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were estimated using RaxML v8.2X with a GTRGAMMA substitution model (https://sco.h-its.org/ exelixis/software.html), followed by annotation with amino acid substitutions defining nodes and individual virus gene products using treesub (https://github.com/tamuri/treesub/blob/ master/README.md). Phylogenies were based on full-length open-reading-frames with the signal peptide component being removed from HA genes and stop codons removed from all genes: H1-HA 1647, H3-HA 1650, N1-NA 1407, N2-NA 1407, B/Vic-HA 1710, B/Yam-HA 1707, B/Vic-Na 1398 and B/Yam-NA 1398 nucleotides, respectively. Trees were visualized using FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) and highlighted using Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.3 (http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator/features.html). Sequence accession numbers for all reference and test viruses are given in S1 Table. Ethical considerations Written informed consent was not required for this study.

During influenza activity periods weekly outpatient visits for ILI rose in parallel with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus detection (Fig 2) . Based on our data seasonal threshold was determined as an ILI referral of 231/100,000. The 2014-2015 influenza season had an unusually high referral of ILI cases which was considerably earlier than laboratory-confirmed influenza virus detection, presumably due to circulation of other respiratory viruses. Only 18 of 1248 swabbed ILI participants had been vaccinated during the three seasons; of these, eight persons became ill with influenza A/H3N2 and two with A/H1N1pdm09.",

False negative laboratory results may have been obtained due to the late referral of patients to clinics. Individual questionnaires were filled out during sampling and subsequent data regarding course of disease were not collected so we were unable to assess disease severity characteristics (developing pneumonia, need for ICU, etc.). For the same reason, we did not evaluate chronic conditions among non-fatal ILI/SARI cases to determine risk factors associated with any severe courses of disease.",

Influenza virus activity in the country was mainly observed from December through March each season with varying peak weeks and predominant viruses. On average one third of patients with ILI/SARI screened in each season had influenza virus infection. Among ILI cases influenza detection was highest in patients aged 5-14 years while the highest proportions of influenza-confirmed SARI cases were among adults. Persons aged 30-64 years had a higher risk of a fatal outcome. The observed circulation of antigenically and genetically variable viruses in Georgia and selection of A/Georgia/532/ 2015 as a reference virus by WHO CC, London illustrates the need for routine surveillance to contribute to the work of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System.

All four 2014-2015 season viruses belonged to the 6B genetic group characterized by encoding the amino acid substitutions P83S, D97N, K163Q, S185T, S203T, A256T, K283E and I321V in HA1 and E47K, S124N and E172K in HA2 compared to A/California/7/2009 and clustered with the reference virus A/South Africa/3626/2013. The NA of these four viruses differed from A/California/7/2009 by thirteen amino acid substitutions: I34V, L40I, N44S (gain of a glycosylation site), I117M, N200S, V241I, N248D, I321V, Y351F, I365T, N369K, N386K (loss of a glycosylation site) and K432E. HA genes of nine viruses circulating early in the 2015-2016 season belonged to group 6B and encoded two additional amino acid substitutions K311T in HA1 and L37Q in HA2. The NA sequences of these viruses also fell in genetic group 6B and carried additional substitutions: T289I and I396M. The HA genes of six viruses from later in the 2015-2016 season fell into genetic subgroup 6B.1 characterized by encoding the substitutions S84N, S162N (introducing a new potential glycosylation site) and I216T in HA1 and clustered with reference virus A/Slovenia/2903/2015.

However, A/Georgia/ 532/2015 was recognized well by antisera raised against cell culture-propagated A/Victoria/ 361/2011(3C.1) and both cell culture-propagated and egg-propagated cultivars of A/Stockholm/6/2014 (3C.3a). Five of ten viruses from the 2015-2016 season were recovered, based on detection of sialidase activity, but only three had HA activity.

Vaccine viruses are indicated in red, viruses from Georgia for 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 seasons are shown in blue and pink viruses poorly, but they were recognized by antiserum raised against the 2016-2017 season vaccine virus, egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (3C.2a), at titers only 4-fold lower than the homologous titer of the antiserum. Twelve viruses were isolated from 14 samples of the 2016-2017 season, but 11 were unable to agglutinate RBCs and only one virus (A/Georgia/1819/2016) was analyzed by HI assay. It was recognized by an antiserum raised against the recommended 2017-2018 season vaccine virus, egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014, at a titer within 4-fold of the homologous titer of the antiserum. In total, 27 A/H3N2 viruses were sequenced (Fig 5, S3 Fig). Analysis of HA and NA genes of four viruses from the 2014-2015 season revealed that one virus belonged to genetic subgroup 3C.3b, encoding HA amino acid substitutions compared to the 3C.3 group: E62K, K83R, N122D (losing a glycosylation site), L157S, R261Q in HA1 and V18K in HA2, with this virus (A/Georgia/342/2015) carrying HA1 Q197H, as did some other viruses of the 3C.3b genetic subgroup. The NA gene of A/Georgia/342/2015 carried mutations encoding amino acid substitutions I26T, M51V, V143G, E221D, V263I and T434N. The HA gene of the other three viruses clustered in subgroup 3C.2a, characterized by amino acid substitutions L3I, N144S (resulting in the loss of a potential glycosylation motif), F159Y, K160T (resulting in the gain of a potential glycosylation site), N225D and Q311H in HA1. A/Georgia/532/2015 (3C.2a) carried HA1 amino acid substitutions R142K and Q197R and showed polymorphism at the 158-160 glycosylation motif which, when glycosylated in typical 3C.2a viruses, prevents the agglutination of RBCs. The NA genes of the 3C.2a viruses clustered together and encoded amino acid substitutions T267K and I380V in the NA glycoprotein. HA gene sequence analysis of 2015-2016 season viruses showed that four of the five fell in subclade 3C.2a1 and one in clade 3C.3a, the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 clade. The HA gene of the 3C.3a virus encoded HA1 amino acid substitution Y94H, commonly seen in 3C.3a viruses collected during the 2015-2016 season. The NA gene of this virus clustered with other 3C.3a subclade viruses. 3C.2a1 viruses from Georgia had, in addition to the clade defining substitutions (N171K in HA1 and I77V and G155E in HA2), the HA1 amino acid substitution S46Y. The NA genes of these four viruses clustered with other 3C.2a1 subclade viruses and differed from the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 vaccine virus by encoding the substitutions S245N (resulting in the gain of a new glycosylation motif), S247T (a substitution that maintained a glycosylation motif at residues 245-247), T267K, D339N, I380V, T392I and P468H. All 18 sequenced viruses of the 2016-2017 season from Georgia belonged to subclade 3C.2a1. Two viruses showed mixed sequences encoding the glycosylation motif at residues 158-160 in HA1 following culture; one of them, A/Georgia/1819/2016, was able to agglutinate RBCs. The HA genes of viruses from Georgia clustered in two subgroups: the first encoding an HA1 R142G substitution (12 viruses) and the second with HA1 amino acid changes K92R, N121K and H311Q (6 viruses). The NA genes of viruses from Georgia had the same clustering pattern as the HA genes and the NAs of all differed from that of the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 vaccine virus by 7 amino acid substitutions: S245N (resulting in the gain of a new glycosylation site), S247T (maintaining the glycosylation motif), I231V, T267K, I380V, T392I and P468H. The NAs of 12 viruses also carried the amino acid substitutions L140I, V143M, S315R and D339N. Influenza B. respectively.

Vaccine viruses are indicated in red; 2014-2015, 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 viruses from Georgia in blue, pink and brown respectively. Reference B/Yamagata lineage Eleven (92%) of twelve viruses of the 2014-2015 season were successfully recovered. In HI analyses all but two viruses showed reduced recognition by antiserum raised against the eggpropagated B/Massachusetts/02/2012 vaccine virus (clade 2) used in the 2014-2015 season; however, all test viruses were recognized very well by antisera raised against egg-propagated viruses from clade 3 (including B/Phuket/3073/2013, the recommended influenza B component for 2015-2016 trivalent vaccines). Sequence analysis of eight viruses showed that HA and NA genes belonged to clade 3, the B/Wisconsin/1/2010 -B/Phuket/3073/2013 clade (S4 and S5 Figs). All viruses differed from the 2014-2015 season vaccine virus, B/Massachusetts/2/2012, by 11 HA1 amino acid substitutions (K48R, A108P, N116K, S150I, N165Y, L172Q, A181T, N202S, G229D, K298E and E312K) and by 13 NA amino acid substitutions (I45V, H65R, A68T, L73P, I106T, T125K, K186R, V248I, R295S, E320K, K343E, D463N and A465T). The HA and NA genes of 7 viruses formed a tight cluster with the NAs being defined by Q42R amino acid substitution (S5 Fig). B/Victoria lineage Seven (54%) of 13 viruses from the 2015-2016 season were recovered and analyzed by HI. Two viruses reacted well with post-infection ferret antiserum raised against egg-propagated B/ Brisbane/60/2008, the recommended influenza B component in northern hemisphere quadrivalent vaccines. The other five were recognized poorly by the same antiserum, but were recognized well by antisera raised against two cell culture-propagated viruses (B/Ireland/3154/2016 and B/Nordrhein-Westfalen/1/2016) genetically closely related to, and serving as surrogates for, cell-propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008. Eleven (92%) of 12 viruses from the 2016-2017 season were recovered. All but two were poorly recognized by antiserum raised against the vaccine virus egg-propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008 but recognized well by antisera raised against cell culture-propagated reference viruses (B/Hong Kong/514/2009, B/Ireland/3154/2016 and B/Nordrhein-Westfalen/1/ 2016) at titers generally similar to the respective homologous titers of the antisera, all of which were low.

B/Yamagata viruses from Georgia in the 2014-2015 season were antigenically similar to B/ Phuket/3073/2013-like viruses (clade 3), as approximately 70% of the influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses circulating in the European region [17], and differed from the B/Massachusetts/02/2012 vaccine virus (clade 2). HA genes of all clade 3 viruses encoded single amino acid substitutions in each antigenic site: the 120-loop, the 150-loop, the 160-loop and the 190-helix compared to viruses falling in clade 2. Amino acid substitutions in the 120-loop are known to alter virus antigenicity [36], so this might explain poor recognition of clade 3 viruses by antiserum raised against the B/Massachusetts/02/2012 (clade 2) egg-propagated vaccine virus. Influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses circulating in Georgia during 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 seasons belonged to clade 1A, the B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade. Trivalent influenza vaccines for 2015-2016 contained a virus of the B/Yamagata lineage (a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus) while the vast majority of influenza B viruses detected in the European region were B/Victoria lineage [15]. Despite such lineage mismatch, immune responses to the vaccine can provide some cross-protection against infection by viruses of the other influenza B lineage",

Thirteen(48%) of 27 deaths occurred during the 2015-2016 season when the dominant virus was A/ H1N1pdm09 and, despite the dominance of influenza B viruses in 2014-2015, there were still seven deaths associated with A/H1N1pdm09 that season. Patients infected with A/ H1N1pdm09 had a higher risk of fatal outcome compared to A/H3N2 and influenza B infection (OR 4.31, CI 1.75-10.35, p = 0.001). The age of patients who died ranged from 1 to 84 years (median 55 years, IQR 52-64), with 18 (67%) of 27 fatal cases being in the 30-64 years age group, yielding a high odds of fatal outcome (OR 10.18, CI 4.43-23.36 <0.001).A/ H1N1pdm09 influenza confirmed cases aged 30-64 years had statistically significant higher risk for a fatal outcome compared to those in other age groups (OR 11.41, CI 3.94-33.04, p<0.001,).
