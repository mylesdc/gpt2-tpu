Here, we investigated the temporal transcriptional changes that occur in the cat intestine during T. gondii infection. Methods: Cats were infected with 100 T. gondii cysts and their intestines were collected at 6, 12, 18, 24, 72 and 96 hours post-infection (hpi). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) Illumina technology was used to gain insight into the spectrum of genes that are differentially expressed due to infection. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was also used to validate the level of expression of a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by sequencing.",

RNA-Seq results were confirmed by qRT-PCR. DEGs were mainly enriched in catalytic activity and metabolic process based on gene ontology enrichment analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that transcriptional changes in the intestine of infected cats evolve over the course of infection, and the largest difference in the enriched pathways was observed at 96 hpi. The anti-T. gondii defense response of the feline host was mediated by Major Histocompatibility Complex class I, proteasomes, heat-shock proteins and fatty acid binding proteins.",

Toxoplasma gondii has been reported in nearly all warm-blooded animals [1] . However, its only definitive host is the cat, including members of the family Felidae, where the sexual cycle occurs in the enterocytes of the small intestine. Cat infection occurs via the ingestion of bradyzoite-containing tissue cysts, and following excystation of bradyzoites in the gut, the parasites infect the epithelium and progress from the asexual merozoite stage into sexual stages called gametes (micro-and macrogametocytes). Male and female gametes fuse to form microscopic zygotes/oocysts, which are excreted in cat feces into the environment where they mature into sporulated oocysts [2] . Infected cats can produce millions of oocysts through a single infection [3] . These environmentally resistant oocysts can remain infectious for long periods of time in the environment [4, 5] . When ingested by intermediate hosts, infectious sporozoites are liberated from the oocysts and differentiate into tachyzoites in order to complete the life-cycle.",

Toxoplasma gondii PRU strain was maintained by passage through Kunming mice [20] . We used a low passage PRU strain to preserve the biological attributes and fidelity to the original strain. Brain cysts of T. gondii were examined microscopically and their number was adjusted to 100 cysts/ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Cats (n = 21) were randomly allocated to 7 groups (i.e. 3 cats per group). Six groups were subjected to infection, where each cat was infected by intragastric inoculation with 100 cysts in 1 ml sterile PBS. One group of cats (remained uninfected as a control group) received 1 ml of sterile PBS only. Cat intestinal tissue was collected at different time points [6, 12, 18, 24, 72 and 96 hours post-infection (hpi)] from cats infected with T. gondii. Intestinal tissue was also collected from three cats in the uninfected group. The collected tissues were rinsed trice in PBS and kept frozen in liquid nitrogen until further processing.",

We used RNA sequencing analysis to determine any temporal changes in the transcriptional response of the intestine of cats infected with T. gondii at 6, 12, 18, 24, 72 and 96 hpi. Our results showed that 2363 genes were differentially expressed in the intestine of infected cats compared to uninfected control cats. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses showed that DEGs involved in the metabolic process and catalytic activity were the most enriched at all time points post-infection. A previous study has reported the upregulation of cell growth/maintenance (Translation and Transcription GO categories) and metabolism (Glycolysis and TCA Cycle GO categories)-related genes in the T. gondii merozoite stage during intestinal infection of mice [26] . This intraepithelial intestinal stage of T. gondii proliferates asexually using endopolygeny, whereby multiple daughters are generated from a single parental organism [27] . The results of the present and previous studies underscore the high bioenergetic demands of the growing parasite, in order to adapt to the low oxygen tension in the cat's intestine, and sustain its proliferation [28] .",

MHC I is composed of the polymorphic heavy chain, \u03b22-microglobulin, and antigenic peptides. The latter can be derived from endogenous proteins and from proteins of this intracellular parasite. These proteins are degraded by the proteolytic proteasome complex, then transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they associate with the class I molecule to form MHC I. One of the physiological functions of MHC I is recognition by the peptide-specific T-cell receptors of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs). These [29] [30] [31] . CTLs eliminate infected cells by recognition of foreign antigens that are processed in a proteasome-dependent pathway and presented by MHC I [32] . Therefore, the downregulation of MHC I genes during the first 12 hours after infection can reduce the antigen-specific CTL cell-mediated killing of T. gondii-infected cells [33] . Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) plays a critical role in innate immunity during acute T. gondii infection [34] . PA28, a proteasome activator induced by IFN-\u03b3, has been implicated in MHC I antigen processing. The upregulation of the PA28 gene, observed at 24 hpi, indicates that levels of this IFN-\u03b3-inducible activator protein, PA28, had increased to enhance the cat's defense response. PA28 promotes antigen processing and presentation, through recruiting more immunoproteasomes to proteasomes, and processing more parasite antigens during acute infection [35, 36] . Antigenic peptides resulting from proteasomal degradation are translocated into the ER lumen via transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP1/2) [37] . Therefore, the upregulation of the TAP1/2 gene, observed at 24 hpi, may have also enhanced the cats' intestinal immune response to T. gondii infection.",

After HSP70 binds to the surface of antigen presenting cells, MHC I presentation of the HSP-bound cytosolic antigen occurs, mediated by a transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) [39] . We did not find any significant changes in the regulation of MHC I gene expression at 18 and 24 hpi; however, hsp70 and hsp90 genes were upregulated at both time points, in addition to PA28 and TAP1/2 genes at 24 hpi. HSP70 and HSP90 are peptide-binding proteins, and are associated with antigenic epitopes [40] . The upregulation of the HSP70/ HSP90 complex may support the immune response, through enhancing antigen processing and presentation via proteasome and enhancing cell viability. hsp70 is expressed in response to a variety of pathological stimuli, and allows the cell to survive lethal insults [41] . The interplay between HSP70 and HSP90 is of crucial importance for cell viability [42] . Toxoplasma gondii may benefit from the upregulation of hsp70, by maintaining the integrity of surrogate host cells, in order to complete its own growth, and to evade immunological detection. A connection between the upregulation of HSP genes and the division of schizont nucleoli has been suggested as nuclear division was not detected after 24 hpi in cat intestine [43] .",

Host cells, via increasing the expression of HSP70/ 90, PA28, TAP, and TAP1/2 genes, deploy chaperones, immunoproteasomes and transporters to limit infection, through promoting antigen processing and presentation. In the present study, as infection progressed, the expression of MHC I genes was elevated at 72 and 96 hpi, indicating that the cats may have mounted a CTL response, mediated by MHC I, to limit replication of the parasite. Infecting cultured rat-intestinal epithelial cells with mature sporozoites, induced an elevated expression of genes associated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) signaling, via NF-\u03baB [44] . This transcriptomic change was not observed in our study, suggesting that anti-T. gondii intestinal immunity can vary between different hosts and different parasite stages, and based on whether the infection was established under in vitro or in vivo conditions. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are released from the cytoplasm following the loss of enterocyte membrane integrity. Toxoplasma gondii can damage cell integrity, leading to the release of FABPs into the circulatory system. Ileal FABP (Il-FABP), which is located at the distal part of the small intestine, can mediate the uptake of fatty-acids. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. Il-FABP was upregulated in the intestine of cats from 12 to 96 hpi, but was downregulated at 6 hpi. This suggests a correlation between infection-induced alterations in the expression of FABP, and its potential lipid-metabolizing capacity [45] on the activation of PPARs, and the subsequent influence on key biological processes, such as the regulation of glucose, lipid homeostasis, cell survival, inflammation, proliferation and differentiation.",

In this study, the expression of the CYP1A1 gene was downregulated from 6 to 96 hpi, except at 72 hpi, and the GSTA2 gene was upregulated from 18 to 96 hpi. While downregulated CYP1A1 can reduce the production of ROMs, thus minimizing DNA and protein damage, the upregulation of GSTA2 may allow cytotoxic xenobiotics to accumulate, possibly triggering tumor development.

The UGT1A1 enzyme can detoxify many endogenous and exogenous compounds [48] . For example, irinotecan is widely used for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and is metabolized by esterase to form a SN-38, which is further conjugated to UGT1A1. Patients with the UGT1A1 variant have poor metabolism of SN-38 and are thus prone to irinotecan toxicity because of the difficulty of SN-38 excretion from body in the non-toxic SN-38G form [49] . It is possible to hypothesize that cancer patients concurrently infected with T. gondii, if administered irinotecan, A link between T. gondii infection and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has also been previously suggested [50] [51] [52] . We were intrigued by the observation that the neutral endopeptidase (NEP), amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) and APOE genes were significantly downregulated at 24, 72 and 96 hpi, respectively. The altered expression of the NEP, APP and APOE genes may impact the metabolism of endogenous amyloid-\u03b2, putatively a main contributor to AD [53] [54] [55] . Here, the downregulation of NEP, APP and APOE genes at 24, 72 and 96 hpi suggests diverse means by which early T. gondii may contribute to the development of AD. In this study, we have not quantified the extent of T. gondii infection in each cat, nor considered the impact of parasite burden on the hosts' response. Therefore, the differences in host transcript abundance, observed over the course of infection, might have been influenced by changes in parasite burden or changes in parasite life stage development. Quantification of parasite burden, either through qPCR or analyzing parasite reads in RNA-Seq data, should be used to address this issue in future investigations. In addition, looking at differences in host transcript abundance during parasite life stage transitions throughout the course of infection, may provide critical insights in to how the feline host supports sexual reproduction.",

            "text": "Whole-transcriptome profiling, using RNA-Seq technology, of the cat's intestine following infection with T. gondii improved our understanding of the signaling pathways that mediate the response of cat intestine to early infection. Comparing the infection groups to the PBS-treated control group, 56, 184, 404, 508, 400 and 811 significantly DEGs were identified at 6, 12, 18, 24, 72 and 96 hpi, respectively. Our data suggest that T. gondii can modulate immune response and metabolic pathway to facilitate its development and survival in cat intestine. At 6 and 12 hpi, downregulation of MHC I genes may contribute to the establishment of infection in cat intestine during this early stage of host-parasite interaction. To counter the infection, the cat leverages chaperones, immunoproteasomes and transporters, through the upregulation of HSP70/90, PA28, TAP, and Fig. 8 Scatter plots of the enriched KEGG pathways statistics. The q-value is the corrected P-value (range from 0 to 1). The colour and size of the dots represent the range of the q-value (level of significance) and the number of DEGs mapped to the indicated pathways, respectively. The X-axis shows the enrichment factor; the Y-axis corresponds to the KEGG Pathway. The top 20 enriched KEGG pathways of the indicated groups are shown. Rich factor is the ratio of the DEG number to the total gene number in a certain pathway ",
