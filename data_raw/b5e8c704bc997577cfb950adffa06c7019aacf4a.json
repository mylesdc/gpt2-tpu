            "text": "The arterivirus family (order Nidovirales) of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses includes porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus and equine arteritis virus (EAV). Their replicative enzymes are translated from their genomic RNA, while their seven structural proteins are encoded by a set of small, partially overlapping genes in the genomic 39-proximal region. The latter are expressed via synthesis of a set of subgenomic mRNAs that, in general, are functionally monocistronic (except for a bicistronic mRNA encoding the E and GP2 proteins). ORF5, which encodes the major glycoprotein GP5, has been used extensively for phylogenetic analyses. However, an in-depth computational analysis now reveals the arterivirus-wide conservation of an additional AUG-initiated ORF, here termed ORF5a, that overlaps the 59 end of ORF5. The pattern of substitutions across sequence alignments indicated that ORF5a is subject to functional constraints at the amino acid level, while an analysis of substitutions at synonymous sites in ORF5 revealed a greatly reduced frequency of substitution in the portion of ORF5 that is overlapped by ORF5a. The 43-64 aa ORF5a protein and GP5 are probably expressed from the same subgenomic mRNA, via a translation initiation mechanism involving leaky ribosomal scanning. Inactivation of ORF5a expression by reverse genetics yielded a severely crippled EAV mutant, which displayed lower titres and a tiny plaque phenotype. These defects, which could be partially complemented in ORF5a-expressing cells, indicate that the novel protein, which may be the eighth structural protein of arteriviruses, is expressed and important for arterivirus infection.",

Since then, the virus has been causing worldwide epidemics of a previously unknown reproductive and respiratory disease and has become one of the most economically important swine diseases. Recently, a large outbreak of highly virulent PRRSV affected the Asian swine industry, causing considerable economic losses (Zhou & Yang, 2010) . analysis of their genomes, which also revealed an intriguing relationship with coronaviruses. Despite striking differences in genome size and virion structure, the genome organization and expression strategy of the two groups were found to be comparable and their key replicative enzymes were postulated to share common ancestry (den Boon et al., 1991) . A specific feature of their genome expression strategy is the generation of a nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs to express a variety of genes from the 39-proximal region of the genome (Pasternak et al., 2006; Sawicki et al., 2007) . Arteriviruses and coronaviruses were united in the order Nidovirales, which was subsequently expanded by the addition of the roniviruses, toroviruses and bafiniviruses (Gorbalenya et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "The polycistronic arterivirus genome contains at least nine known ORFs (Fig. 1a) . The replicative enzymes are encoded by the 59-proximal replicase ORFs 1a and 1b, yielding two long non-structural polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, with the synthesis of the latter depending on a ribosomal frameshift near the 39 end of ORF1a. The pp1a and pp1ab precursors are processed into at least 13 mature non-structural proteins (nsps) by three or four viral proteinases encoded by ORF1a (Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Fang & Snijder, 2010) . In EAV, PRRSV and LDV, seven relatively small genes have been identified in the 39proximal domain of the genome, positioned in the same relative order downstream of ORF1b (Fig. 1a) . In SHFV, this region of the genome appears to contain three additional ORFs, which may have arisen from the duplication of ORFs 2-4 (Godeny et al., 1998) but have not been characterized in any detail. In the other arteriviruses, ORFs 2a-7 encode seven structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein and six envelope proteins, the glycoproteins (GP) GP2, GP3, GP4 and GP5, and the nonglycosylated envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins (Snijder & Meulenberg, 1998; . By using reverse genetics to engineer gene knockouts, in both EAV and PRRSV the expression of each of these seven proteins was found to be critical for the production of infectious progeny (Molenkamp et al., 2000; Wissink et al., 2005) . These experiments also revealed that cells transfected with mutants lacking expression of E, GP2, GP3 or GP4 release virus-like particles (VLPs) consisting of RNA and the GP5, M and N proteins (Wieringa et al., 2004; Zevenhoven-Dobbe et al., 2004) . Together with the earlier characterization of arterivirus particles (de Vries et al., 1992; Faaberg & Plagemann, 1995; Meulenberg et al., 1995; Snijder et al., 1999 Snijder et al., , 2003 Wieringa et al., 2004) , these data indicate that the N protein and the disulphide-linked GP5-M heterodimer form the structural core of the virion. The E protein and a GP2-GP3-GP4 heterotrimer are minor virus constituents that may play a role in receptor binding and/or virus entry (Van Breedam et al., 2010) . Still, many details of arterivirus assembly, maturation and structural protein function remain to be elucidated.",

We have been using a number of complementary comparative computational approaches to systematically identify novel overlapping genes in RNA virus genomes (Firth & Brown, 2006; Chung et al., 2008; Firth et al., 2008; Firth & Atkins, 2009) . When applied to arteriviruses, these methods detected a novel short ORF, hereafter termed ORF5a, overlapping the 59 end of the GP5 CDS in the +2 reading frame. Here, we present bioinformatic evidence and experimental verification for the functional importance of ORF5a in arteriviruses.",

MLOGD uses nucleotide and amino acid substitution matrices to model sequence evolution in dual-coding, single-coding and non-coding regions. It can be used to predict whether query ORFs are likely to be coding sequences via an approximate likelihood-ratio test, where the null model comprises any known CDSs and the alternative model comprises the known CDSs and the query ORF. When applied to the PRRSV-NA alignment, MLOGD detected a positive coding signature for the previously defined arterivirus CDSs and also for ORF5a (Fig. 1b) . In the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) PRRSV-NA reference sequence, NC_001961 (15 428 nt), ORF5a covers nucleotides 13 778-13 930 (51 codons) and therefore overlaps the 59 end of the GP5 CDS (nucleotides 13 788-14 390) by 48 codons (~24 % of the GP5 gene) in the +2 reading frame.

            "text": "A similar ORF5a was identified in PRRSV-EU and the other arteriviruses, EAV (Fig. 2a) , LDV and SHFV, and again MLOGD detected a positive coding signature for ORF5a using sequence alignments of PRRSV-EU, EAV and LDV. Incidentally, the presence of this ORF in EAV, though not its bioinformatic coding signature, had Fig. 2b for GenBank accession numbers). For EAV and the two PRRSV genotypes, plots are shown for several coding-potential statistics in a 15-codon sliding window. The top and middle panels illustrate the degree of conservation at synonymous sites within the GP5 CDS: the top panel depicts the probability that the degree of conservation within a given window could be obtained under a null model of neutral evolution at synonymous sites, while the middle panel depicts the absolute amount of conservation as represented by the ratio of the observed number of substitutions within a given window to the number expected under the null model. Scores below the dashed line correspond to more conserved regions and are indicative of overlapping functional elements, either coding or non-coding. Owing to the huge quantity of GP5 sequence data (8344 sequences) available for the PRRSV-NA plot, the formal P values for this analysis are extremely small for the conserved 59 region. The bottom panel depicts the MLOGD coding potential score in the +2 frame (relative to the GP5 CDS). For illustrative purposes the M CDS, and the GP4 CDS in PRRSV-NA, were not included in the null-model CDS annotations so that these CDSs, like ORF5a, register positive coding potential (i.e. scores above the dashed line) in the MLOGD analysis. Note that, regardless of sign (positive or negative), the MLOGD signal tends to be weaker within regions of high conservation (e.g. within ORF5a) due to there being fewer substitutions with which to discriminate between the null model and the alternative model. Discovery and function of a novel arterivirus gene previously been noted by Pasternak et al. (2000) . Since there is only a single SHFV sequence available, MLOGD could not be used to test the coding potential of ORF5a in that virus. Although this analysis was based on the application of MLOGD to specific ORFs, for illustrative purposes the MLOGD score in a 15-codon sliding window in the +2 reading frame (with respect to ORF5) is shown in Fig. 1 (b) for alignments of 127 EAV, 232 PRRSV-NA and 34 PRRSV-EU sequences (i.e. the available sequences with coverage of both ORF5 and at least 150 nt of its 59 and 39 flanking sequences). Positive coding signatures are apparent for ORF5a (and also for the M and GP4 CDSs in cases where they fall in the +2 reading frame with respect to the GP5 CDS). Additional alignments were generated for 224 EAV, 8344 PRRSV-NA and 587 PRRSV-EU sequences that have full coverage of the GP5 CDS, and were analysed for conservation at synonymous sites as described in Firth & Atkins (2009) [see also Simmonds et al. (2008) ; see Shi et al. (2010) and Zhang et al. (2010) for recent PRRSV and EAV phylogenies]. Enhanced conservation at synonymous sites is indicative of overlapping functional elements -either coding or non-coding. In all three alignments, greatly enhanced conservation was apparent in the region where ORF5a overlaps the GP5 CDS (Fig. 1b) .",

When the context of the first AUG codon on a transcript is suboptimal, efficient leaky scanning to alternative downstream AUG codons can occur (Kozak, 2002) . Here, neither the ORF5 nor ORF5a initiation codons have a guanine at the +4 position, but all five arterivirus ORF5 initiation codons have an adenine at the 23 position. In contrast, the ORF5a initiation codons have either a pyrimidine (EAV, PRRSV-NA and SHFV) or a guanine (PRRSV-EU and LDV) at the 23 position. Thus, in PRRSV-NA and EAV, where the ORF5a AUG codon is 59, there is the potential for efficient leaky scanning to the ORF5 initiation codon. In contrast, in PRRSV-EU, LDV and SHFV, where the ORF5a AUG is 39, conventional leaky scanning for ORF5a translation may be expected to be less efficient. However, in these sequences, the ORF5 and ORF5a AUG codons are very closely spaced (separated by just 2 or 5 nt) and it has been demonstrated that, if two AUG codons are separated by less than~10 nt, efficient initiation may occur at the downstream AUG codon, even when the upstream AUG codon is in a strong context (Matsuda & Dreher, 2006) .",

Some 10 800 sequences with full or partial coverage of the ORF5a/ORF5 region were analysed. In contrast to the above comparative phylogenetic analyses, simply counting sequences ignores potential phylogenetic bias (some clades may be greatly over-represented relative to others; indeed; clustering the sequences with BLASTCLUST or CLUSTAL X shows this to be the case). Thus, the following analysis is more meaningful with respect to the range of features present rather than to the relative abundances of those features. Many sequences (including~90 % of th\u1ebd 9600 available PRRSV-NA sequences) cover ORF5 entirely but have no 59 flanking sequence. Therefore they do not allow analysis of the upstream ORF5a initiation codon or its context, but still allow analysis of the presence or absence of premature termination codons within the part of ORF5a that overlaps ORF5. Nonetheless 136 EAV, 445 PRRSV-NA, 622 PRRSV-EU, 1 SHFV and 5 LDV sequences have coverage of the ORF5a initiation site, and the above-mentioned initiation sites and contexts are very highly conserved (except that~63 % of PRRSV-EU and 9 % of PRRSV-NA sequences have a guanine instead of an adenine as the nucleotide at the 23 position of the ORF5 initiation codon context). Similarly, the above-mentioned ORF5a lengths are highly conserved in those sequences with full or partial coverage of the ORF5a region, with the notable exception that PRRSV-NA exhibits two main forms of differing lengths: a 51 codon version (~26 % of sequences) and a 39-truncated 46-codon version (~74 % of sequences). A very small fraction of sequences were found to be ORF5a-defective as a result of either premature ORF5a-frame termination codons or substitutions within the ORF5a initiation codon. However, these do not necessarily represent sequences from viable viruses, but might instead be due to sequencing errors, sequencing of defective virus sequences or curation errors (e.g. five sequence records in which non-contiguous GP3 and GP5 sequences appear to have been fused in silico). Indeed, similar numbers of GP5-defective sequences were found during the analysis.",

Viral RNA synthesis in transfected cells was also analysed by Northern blot hybridization (not shown).

Another striking similarity with the E-GP2 gene pair is the fact that the ORF5a initiation codon precedes the GP5 gene in some arteriviruses (EAV and PRRSV-NA), but is just downstream of the ORF5 initiation codon in the others. This observation raises interesting questions about the evolution of this part of the arterivirus genome, in particular when evolving optimal sg mRNA synthesis and the expression levels of each of the viral structural proteins are taken into account. In EAV, a 10 nt segment starting with the ORF5 initiation codon can now be assumed to encode amino acids for three different proteins, GP4, the ORF5a protein and GP5, in three different reading frames, which again illustrates the pressure on RNA viruses to compress maximal coding information into a minimal sequence.",

Similarly, after passaging in cell culture 70 times, a spontaneous insertion of 12 nt into ORF5a (Ala-Arg-Ser-Leu inserted after the amino-terminal Met-Phe) of PRRSV-NA was tolerated (Han et al., 2009) . In contrast, derivatives of the EAV-based vector in which the 24 nt-sequence served to insert additional foreign sequences, encoding e.g. GFP (de Vries et al., 2001) or ectodomains of other arterivirus GP5 proteins (Dobbe et al., 2001) , must have suffered because of the disruption of ORF5a. In fact, the instability and crippled or non-viable phenotypes reported for some of these constructs could (in part) be explained by a lack of expression of a functional ORF5a protein.",

We used the SINV replicon system to express ORF5a proteins with epitope tags (haemagglutinin-or myc-tags at either the amino or carboxy terminus), but the D5a-2 mutant virus was no longer complemented by these fusion proteins. Finally, we were unable to demonstrate the presence of the ORF5a protein in virions by mass spectrometric analysis of purified EAV. However, a recent proteomics analysis of purified PRRSV-NA did identify several peptides from the ORF5a protein of the porcine arterivirus, and follow-up studies confirmed both the expression of the novel protein in infected cells and the production of antibodies recognizing the PRRSV ORF5a protein in infected swine (Johnson et al., 2011) . Thus, the combined data now obtained for PRRSV-NA and EAV strongly suggest that the ORF5a protein is the eighth structural protein of the arterivirus particle, although more extensive studies will be required to gain detailed insight into its function in arterivirus biology.",

In total one SHFV, five LDV, 435 EAV and 10 359 PRRSV sequences with full or partial coverage of ORF5 were retrieved. PRRSV sequences were separated into PRRSV-NA and PRRSV-EU genotypes (with respect to GP5), based on the TBLASTN results. Using a 76 % cut-off threshold on the TBLASTN 'maximum identity' score, all but eight of the 10 359 sequences were cleanly separated between the two genotypes. Within each group, ORF5 sequences were translated, aligned and back-translated to nucleotide sequence alignments using EMBOSS and CLUSTAL (Rice et al., 2000; Larkin et al., 2007) . Flanking nucleotide sequences, where available, were similarly extracted, aligned and combined into the alignments. Patent sequences and constructs were removed prior to analysis, and sequences annotated as defective (found by using the search terms 'non-functional', 'truncated' and 'defective' in GenBank records) were inspected and removed from the analyses where appropriate. MLOGD statistics were calculated as described by Firth & Brown (2006) . The synonymous site conservation statistic was calculated as described by Firth & Atkins (2009) . Prior to these latter two analyses: (i) sequences with premature termination codons in ORF5 or ORF5a were also removed as being presumed-defective sequences (these amount to ,1 % of sequences and are not obviously clustered phylogenetically), (ii) one EAV sequence with nine ambiguous nucleotide codes -indicative of poor sequence quality -was removed and (iii) since there was no shortage of PRRSV-NA sequences, PRRSV-NA sequences with any ambiguous nucleotide codes (~10 % of sequences) were removed.",
