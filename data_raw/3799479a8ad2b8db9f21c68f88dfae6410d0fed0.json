They are cleaved off upon the passenger protein reaching its destination. The explosive growth in sequencing technologies has led to the deposition of vast numbers of protein sequences necessitating rapid functional annotation techniques, with subcellular localization being a key feature.

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells utilize these short peptides to mediate the targeting and translocation of the passenger protein domains across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes or the inner and outer membranes in prokaryotes. SPs are cleaved off from their passenger protein by the endoprotease SPase I [2] upon reaching their targeted destination. In sequence databases such as UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot [3] or EMBL [4] , an important annotation task involves the identification of these SPs and the correct identification of their cleavage sites and the start of the mature protein sequences. However, the staggering rate at which unprocessed sequences are being deposited into the sequence databases easily outpaces the results from experimental methods. This has catalyzed the development of faster and more accurate computational methods to automate the task of SP prediction.",

Most importantly, the systematic functional annotation of biological sequences using Gene Ontology (GO) [10] requires a precise knowledge of the subcellular localization, where SP prediction has a fundamental input. Some of these prediction tools have been applied with varying degrees of success in genome-wide studies for the discovery of novel secretory proteins or large-scale analyses. Examples include the application in the largescale Secreted Protein Discovery Initiative (SPDI) which sought to discover novel human secretory and transmembrane proteins in human [11] ; identification of secreted proteins in 225 bacterial proteomes [12] and parasitic nematodes [13, 14] and genomic analysis of the SARS-associated Tor2 isolate coronavirus [15] . Likewise, tools such as SignalP [16] are employed in the annotation of database sequence entries in which experimental evidence is lacking. SP prediction tools can be useful for locating homologous sequences or predicting the correct start codon since SPs are situated at the N-terminal of proteins [17] .",

Earlier reviews [18] and [19] on SP prediction have focussed on comparisons of the machine learning techniques used, rather than evaluating the results of these methods. Except for the two benchmark studies by Meene et al. [9] in 2000 and Zhang and Henzel [20] in 2004, which were carried out solely to benchmark the various SP prediction tools available at that time, the majority of the comparison studies were conducted during the development of their respective prediction tool [5, 16, 17, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Often, such assessments involved only a subset of the prediction tools that are available or they were tested on a subset of sequences. For instance, the evaluation by Klee and Ellis [31] involved only a subset of the eukaryotic sequences and compared mainly four of the available programs, while Bagos et al. [32] evaluated a mix of putative and experimentally verified archaeal SPs. Furthermore, different datasets were used in the evaluation of some of these prediction tools, thus making it extremely difficult to engage in a fair comparison. In some cases, the performance indicators reported actually differ in the aspects that they were investigating (e.g. discrimination of SP or non-SP proteins OR/AND identification of the cleavage site) [28] .",

Table 1 : Description of the three datasets developed for benchmarking the thirteen SP prediction tools. Only the first 70aa of the sequence are retained as input. All the negative dataset are subjected to redundancy reduction. T denotes the sequence identity threshold set for redundancy reduction. 1 From a first-pass-filtered set of 9,851 reduced to 4,989 upon redundancy reduction (T = 40%) and atypical/spurious sequences removed; 2 From a first-pass-filtered set of 427 reduced to 230 (T = 40%); 3 From a first-pass-filtered set of 370 reduced to 307 (T = 65%); 4 From a first-pass-filtered set of 8,930 reduced to 4,445 (T = 40%); 5 From a first-pass-filtered set of 110 reduced to 61 (T = 40%); 6 Based on the results from this experiment ( Figure 2 and Table 2 ), Signal-BLAST predicts the highest number of correct positive instances (i.e. best sensitivity) (0.978). This is dramatically reversed when it scores 0.815 in specificity upon tested with negative instances where it is tasked to distinguish between secretory and non-secretory proteins. This contrasting result is expected since Signal-BLAST which uses a pairwise alignment algorithm (BLAST tool [35] ) at its core, needs to find a delicate balance between the two types of datasets in order to achieve a good discrimination. SignalP scores the second best accuracy with the artificial neural network ( Signal-CF [27] and Signal3L [29] which adopt the \"subsite-coupled model\" achieve accuracies of 0.774 and 0.813 respectively. The results are lower than those reported in the authors' publications using the same dataset. Manual inspection of Signal-3L revealed that there was a mistake quoted by the authors in their publication [29] . For the entry [Swiss-Prot: Q6UXL0], the authors reported the cleavage site as 28aa instead of the correct 29aa that the authors indicated in their supplied supplementary data (\"Online Supporting Information B: Signal-CF dataset -supp-B.txt\"). Thus, the tools that were evaluated may have been wrongly penalized (SignalP (version 3.0) and PrediSi [22] ). From our examination, Signal-CF and Signal-3L identify the cleavage site at 63aa and 28aa respectively based on the input sequence of length 70aa. When we reduced its evaluation length to LENGTH(SP)+LENGTH(30aa of the mature peptide) which is 59aa in length (the sequence being: MQTF TM VLEE IW TS LFM WFFYALIPCLLTDEVAIL-PAPQNLSVLSTNMKHLLMWSPVIA) as reported in their publication, Signal-CF and Signal-3L reported SPs of 29aa and 28aa. Comparing the two tools, we noted that selecting the correct \"species\" option in Signal-3L is critical; otherwise a markedly different length of SP is reported. Signal-CF, on the other hand, is extremely sensitive to the different lengths. Additionally, it is unclear whether the additional classification of sequences into more specific groups (e.g. plant, human, animal etc.) adopted by Signal-3L is able to generate greater advantage over Signal-CF as we shall see in the other experiments.",

This is evident from the high specificity achieved even with the new dataset provided in Experiment 3.

The consistency we observe in SignalP (both ANN and HMM versions) may be attributed to its more complex models and robustness of its method where various scoring schemes are devised to tackle different aspects (including SP-likeness, the probability of a segment containing the cleavage site and so on). Also, the sequence window employed by SignalP are also relatively wider (Euk: [-11,+2] representing eleven residues prior to the cleavage site and two residues after the cleavage site, Gneg: [-21,+2], Gpos: [-15,+2]) compared to other methods, which are usually localized to a few residues flanking the SP cleavage location. The majority of the tools clearly require 'active learning' or regular update to their underlying models to reflect the latest data distribution.

Most of these tools are able to distinguish secretory and non-secretory proteins with little difficulty, although identifying the correct SP cleavage site remains a challenge. Indeed, some tools are more susceptible to changes in the databases, and they are likely to require regular update to their underlying models to reflect the latest observations for a given set of new sequences. This is particular so for alignmentbased and matrix-based methods, where the updates will allow proper tuning of their model parameters.

Often, due to bias data (e.g. overrepresentation of certain classes of data which were not subjected to redundancy reduction; omission of certain data points, e.g. due to atypical length), the models constructed may not be sufficiently capable of generalizing to new, unseen data. In other cases, inadvertent use of erroneous data to train the predictive models can lead to poor results when tested with new dataset due to the 'noise' found in the training data. To develop the test sets for this work, we have incorporated several good practices proposed in previous works [7, 9, 17, 24, 29, 36] with our own [33] to generate the following three datasets:",
