            "text": "Pharyngitis is usually caused by a viral infection for which antibiotics are often unnecessarily prescribed, adding to the burden of antimicrobial resistance. Identifying who needs antibiotics is challenging; microbiological confirmation and clinical scores are used but have limitations. In a cross-sectional study nested within a randomized controlled trial, we estimated the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of group A Streptococcus (GAS) in patients presenting to primary care with a sore throat and fever in northern Thailand. We then evaluated the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) and clinical scores (Centor and FeverPAIN) to identify the presence of GAS. One hundred sixty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 35 (20.7%) had \u03b2-hemolytic Streptococci (BHS) isolated from throat swab culture, and 11 (6.5%) had GAS. All GAS isolates were sensitive to penicillin G. The median CRP of those without BHS isolation was 10 mg/L (interquartile range [IQR] \u00a3 8-18), compared with 18 mg/L (IQR 9-71, P = 0.0302) for those with GAS and 14 mg/L (IQR \u00a3 8-38, P = 0.0516) for those with any BHS isolated. However, there were no significant relationships between CRP > 8 mg/L (P = 0.112), Centor \u00b3 3 (P = 0.212), and FeverPAIN \u00b3 4 (P = 1.000), and the diagnosis of GAS compared with no BHS isolation. Identifying who requires antibiotics for pharyngitis remains challenging and necessitates further larger studies. C-reactive protein testing alone, although imperfect, can reduce prescribing compared with routine care. Targeted CRP testing through clinical scoring may be the most cost-effective approach to ruling out GAS infection.",

            "text": "Sore throat is a common presentation to primary care internationally, including Thailand. Approximately 40-80% of throat infections are caused by viruses, most commonly influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, and enteroviruses, and antibiotics are ineffective for these infections. Bacterial pathogens are identified in 5-40% of cases, and group A Streptococcus (GAS) is the most common. 1,2 A study of 290 Thai adults presenting to ambulatory care with acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) found the presence of the following bacteria: 7.9% GAS, 9.2% non-group A \u03b2-hemolytic Streptococcus (BHS), 9.6% Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.7% Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.4% coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 0.7% Staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% Hemophilus influenzae, 0.3% Enterobacter spp., and 0.3% Proteus mirabilis. 3 In Chiang Rai, northern Thailand, pharyngitis or tonsillitis makes up over 30% of the respiratory tract infections presenting to government primary care units. 4 National guidelines recommend the use of the Centor score to determine the need for antibiotics. When required, penicillin V and amoxicillin are recommended, or macrolides in the case of penicillin allergy. 5 Antibiotics, typically amoxicillin, were prescribed to 88.4% of cases (14,621/16,539 ) from 2015 to 2016. 4 Antibiotic resistance is an important problem in both the developed and developing world. In Thailand, an estimated 19,122 deaths were thought to be caused by multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired infections in 2010. 6 Given that antibiotic use, even with narrow-spectrum agents, drives antimicrobial resistance (AMR), interventions that achieve safe reductions in antibiotic use are needed.",

            "text": "A 2016 Cochrane review compared antibiotic treatment against placebo for sore throats and found some reduction in symptom severity. However, average symptom duration was reduced by only 16 hours. 7 Reducing the risk of complications is often used as a justification for antibiotic treatment, but a large cohort study from 2006 to 2009, albeit from a highincome setting (UK), found the risk of suppurative complications (otitis media, sinusitis, quinsy, and cellulitis) to be around 1% with or without antibiotic treatment. There were no cases of acute rheumatic fever or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. 8 Nonetheless, these findings may not be applicable in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) where prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is higher. The 2015 global burden of disease study found a high burden of rheumatic heart disease in Oceania, South Asia, and central sub-Saharan Africa. The burden is lower in Southeast Asia, and Thailand is considered non-endemic for rheumatic heart disease. 9 Current guidelines recommend antibiotics for pharyngitis caused by GAS and that narrow-spectrum penicillins are most suitable. 10, 11 Concern is growing about increasing levels of GAS resistance to macrolide antibiotics. 12, 13 It is important to identify those most likely to benefit from antibiotic use and to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use to limit AMR; to achieve this, a variety of methods have been used, but with limited success. The best current reference standard for diagnosis of GAS is culture, although the length of time required to generate results limits its use to affect management decisions in primary care. Alternatives for use in primary care include rapid antigen testing, clinical scores such as Centor and FeverPAIN, and biomarkers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP). Studies assessing CRP's performance in identifying the presence of GAS in patients presenting to primary care with sore throats or pharyngitis have produced mixed results, with some studies finding CRP predictive, [14] [15] [16] whereas others have not. 2, [17] [18] [19] [20] Rapid molecular tests for GAS are also being developed and have proved valuable in settings such as northern Australia, where a high burden of GAS, acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and acute rheumatic fever is evident. 21 Our main objective was to evaluate the performance of CRP in identifying the presence of GAS among people consulting with sore throat and fever in Chiang Rai's government-run primary care units. The secondary objectives were to estimate the prevalence of GAS and other key pathogens, study the antibiotic susceptibility of GAS isolates, and compare the performance of CRP against the Centor and FeverPAIN clinical scores.",

This is lower than estimates from a metaanalysis of more than 495,000 patients presenting to primary care or emergency departments, where 24.1% of those presenting with symptoms of pharyngitis or URTI were found to have GAS on culture. 29 They found higher prevalence in high-income countries than LMICs, at 24.3% and 17.6%, respectively. 30 Our findings were similar to other studies from Thailand, which found GAS in 3.8-7.9% of patients presenting with URTI, 3,31 and a study of influenza-like illnesses in Lao PDR (8.6%). 32 Antibiotic susceptibility. Reported antibiotic resistance levels vary across the globe and over time. In our study, we found that all of our isolates were sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone, despite reports of ceftriaxone resistance emerging from Iran, which needs further exploration and confirmation, as historically GAS has been fully susceptible to penicillins and cephalosporins. [33] [34] [35] Erythromycin resistance was found in 2/11 (18.2%) GAS isolates, an important antibiotic for the treatment of pharyngitis in those with penicillin allergies. The national AMR surveillance center reported lower levels (7.2%) of erythromycin resistance in isolates from 85 hospitals across Thailand in 2018. 36 The resistance levels in our study are lower than those reported from India (46%), 37 Iran (33.9%), 33 and South Korea (25.7%), 38 similar to those from Greece (18.8%) 12 but higher than those from the United States (6.8%). 13 Reports of macrolide resistance are causing concern and limiting their use as empirical treatment for sore throats. 12, 13, 35 Cross-resistance between macrolides and lincosamides (e.g., clindamycin) can occur because of erm genes. 34 Clindamycin and erythromycin resistance was found in 2/11 (18.2%) of our isolates; this is higher than reported clindamycin resistance in the United States (0.5%), 13 Greece (1.4%), 12 the Thai national data (6.4%), 36 India (9.5%), 37 Iran (13.5%), 33 and South Korea (15.8%). 38 Resistance levels of 18.2% to chloramphenicol are much higher than the 0.8% reported in Greece 12 and the 7.1% in Thai national data. 34 These results from our limited number of GAS isolates indicate that narrow-spectrum penicillin should remain the mainstay of treatment for GAS pharyngitis in Thailand, as elsewhere. 11, 39 It is thus a concern that none of the 53 patients with sore throat and fever who received antibiotics had received penicillin (almost all received amoxicillin). This finding is not limited to this study but was also seen in all primary care units in the same district of Chiang Rai in a previous review of antibiotic use in primary care and is consistent with the Thai antibiotic guidelines, which give the option of treatment with penicillin V or amoxicillin for GAS pharyngitis. 4, 5 Given the current concern about the development of AMR, largely fueled by overuse of antibiotics, 40, 41 where possible it is intuitive to use narrow-spectrum (i.e., penicillin V) rather than broad-spectrum (i.e., amoxicillin) antibiotics. Caution is also required with the use of erythromycin, and surveillance of AMR should be conducted and used to update treatment guidelines.",

Depending on the guidance followed, prescription rates would vary greatly within this cohort of patients. Using isolation of GAS from a throat swab as the indicator for antibiotic treatment in accordance with current guidance, 11/169 (6.5%) cases would require antibiotics, and this would increase to 29/169 (17.2%) if group C and G Streptococci were also treated. If a CRP threshold of more than 8 mg/L had been used, 93/168 (55.4%) patients would have been prescribed an antibiotic, missing 2/ 11 (18.2%) patients with the presence of GAS. This may seem like a low CRP cutoff clinically, but the medium CRP level for those presenting with a sore throat and fever was 9 mg/L. In primary care, diagnostic tests are mostly used to rule out rather than rule in serious infections, and increasing the CRP cutoff would reduce its sensitivity. With a Centor score of 3 or 4, 4/169 (2.4%) patients would require an antibiotic compared with 18/169 (10.7%) patients with a FeverPAIN score of 4 or 5, with a further 120 (71.0%) potentially being prescribed antibiotics because of a FeverPAIN score of 2 or 3. All of these interventions would reduce antibiotic prescription compared with routine care, where 88.4% of patients diagnosed with tonsillitis or pharyngitis in this setting are prescribed an antibiotic (almost exclusively amoxicillin). 4 Of these strategies, use of throat swabs for all patients is impractical in the Thai primary care setting. Clinical scores are feasible, although whether they reliably identify GAS infection is questionable as indicated by our data and previous studies. 25, 42 Current high prescription rates in routine care also indicate that healthcare workers have limited confidence in withholding antibiotics based on clinical scores alone. 4 Point-of-care CRP tests give results within minutes, making their use in primary care a feasible option. However, although patients with GAS had significantly higher median CRP levels, the association between a CRP > 8 mg/L, Centor scores of \u00b3 3, and FeverPAIN scores of \u00b3 4 and GAS detection was poor.",

Both patients had a Centor score of 1 and Fever-PAIN score of 2; neither had antibiotics prescribed at the index consultation, yet both had symptom resolution by day 14. The specificity of CRP testing to identify pharyngitis caused by GAS is poor as CRP can be raised in other infections and inflammatory processes. 45 Limitations. The major limitations of our study are the small numbers of GAS isolates and the retrospective calculation of the Centor and FeverPAIN clinical scores. Cervical lymph node examination was not recorded, limiting the possible Centor score to 3 rather than 4. This could lead to the underestimation of Centor scores and may have affected the ability of the scores to identify pharyngitis caused by GAS. The FeverPAIN scores may also be imprecise as the presence of tonsillar exudate and inflamed tonsils were collected from descriptions of abnormal throat examination. However, we may have overestimated the number of patients with fever in the last 24 hours as 73.4% of patients had a history of fever lasting more than one day.",

Penicillin is the most appropriate empirical antibiotic for those needing treatment. Surveillance of macrolide resistance is required, and susceptibility testing may be warranted for those with penicillin allergies. Identifying which patients with pharyngitis require antibiotic prescription remains challenging and requires further data from larger studies. However, despite our small sample size, CRP levels were higher in patients from whom GAS was isolated than in those without BHS isolation. Relying on CRP testing alone would result in high levels of antibiotic prescription for sore throats (49.7%), but in some settings, including Chiang Rai, this would still represent an important reduction in antibiotic prescription compared with routine care. Targeted CRP testing through the use of clinical scores is likely to be the most cost-effective approach to ruling out GAS infection.
