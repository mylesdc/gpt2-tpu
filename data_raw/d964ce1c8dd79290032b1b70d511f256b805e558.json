            "text": "The majority of recently emerging infectious diseases in humans is due to cross-species pathogen transmissions from animals. To establish a productive infection in new host species, viruses must overcome barriers to replication mediated by diverse and rapidly evolving host restriction factors such as protein kinase R (PKR). Many viral antagonists of these restriction factors are species specific. For example, the rhesus cytomegalovirus PKR antagonist, RhTRS1, inhibits PKR in some African green monkey (AGM) cells, but does not inhibit human or rhesus macaque PKR. To model the evolutionary changes necessary for cross-species transmission, we generated a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses RhTRS1 in a strain that lacks PKR inhibitors E3L and K3L (VVDEDK+RhTRS1). Serially passaging VVDEDK+RhTRS1 in minimally-permissive AGM cells increased viral replication 10-to 100-fold. Notably, adaptation in these AGM cells also improved virus replication 1000-to 10,000-fold in human and rhesus cells. Genetic analyses including deep sequencing revealed amplification of the rhtrs1 locus in the adapted viruses. Supplying additional rhtrs1 in trans confirmed that amplification alone was sufficient to improve VVDEDK+RhTRS1 replication. Viruses with amplified rhtrs1 completely blocked AGM PKR, but only partially blocked human PKR, consistent with the replication properties of these viruses in AGM and human cells. Finally, in contrast to AGMadapted viruses, which could be serially propagated in human cells, VVDEDK+RhTRS1 yielded no progeny virus after only three passages in human cells. Thus, rhtrs1 amplification in a minimally permissive intermediate host was a necessary step, enabling expansion of the virus range to previously nonpermissive hosts. These data support the hypothesis that amplification of a weak viral antagonist may be a general evolutionary mechanism to permit replication in otherwise resistant host species, providing a molecular foothold that could enable further adaptations necessary for efficient replication in the new host.",

            "text": "There are at least 868 described zoonotic microbial pathogens, 33% of which are capable of human to human transmission [1] . Recent viral zoonoses have led to some of the most devastating and medically relevant outbreaks in modern history, including SARS coronavirus, pandemic influenza, and HIV/AIDS, highlighting the urgent need to understand how viruses adapt to infect new species. At a population level, factors influencing the transmission of zoonotic pathogens to humans include increasing population density, greater contact with wildlife, increased travel, and poor public health infrastructure [2, 3] . However, these factors only allow the microbe increased access to new hosts; they do not directly enable it to adapt to and replicate in the new species. Intermediate hosts, animals that are not the natural host of a virus but are still permissive or semi-permissive for viral replication, play a critical role in cross-species transmission. These hosts can facilitate increased contact between a virus and a new host, and drive adaptive changes that may improve virus replication (Reviewed in [4] ). For example, spill-over of Nipah virus from fruit bats into pigs, the intermediate host, increased human exposure to the virus and resulted in eventual human outbreaks in Malaysia [5, 6] . In another example, lentiviral adaptation through intermediate chimpanzee hosts led to both increased contact with humans, and adaptive genetic changes permitting the virus to inhibit the human versions of several host restriction factors (Reviewed in [7] ).",

A subset of these proteins inhibits specific virus families, such as the restriction of retroviruses mediated by TRIM5a [8] . However, other restriction factors, including protein kinase R (PKR), block the replication of multiple virus families. PKR is activated by binding to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a common byproduct of both RNA and DNA virus replication, followed by dimerization and autophosphorylation. Activated PKR then phosphorylates the a-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2a), ultimately arresting translation initiation [9] . In response to the broad and potent barrier to viral infection imposed by PKR, most virus families have evolved at least one mechanism to inhibit the PKR pathway [10] .",

            "text": "This conflict between host restriction factors and their viral antagonists results in an ''arms race'' leading to rapid evolution of both sets of genes [11] . The extraordinarily high rate of positive selection (dN/dS) among primate PKR genes reflects the evolutionary pressure on PKR to evade virus antagonists [12, 13] . To productively infect new host species, virus antagonists must rapidly adapt to escape these differences in PKR. In the current study, we modeled the process of viral adaptation through an intermediate, minimally permissive host. We experimentally evolved a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the rhesus cytomegalovirus PKR antagonist rhtrs1 in African green monkey cells expressing RhTRS1-resistant PKR. We demonstrate that amplification of the exogenous rhtrs1 locus was an early adaption that is sufficient to rescue virus replication in minimally-permissive AGM cells. This amplification of the rhtrs1 locus was also sufficient to expand the species tropism of these viruses, enabling them to infect both human and rhesus cells substantially better than the initial virus. Importantly, rhtrs1 amplification did not occur when the initial virus was passaged through human fibroblasts, suggesting that amplification in AGM cells was a necessary intermediate step to expand the virus host range. Gene amplification is a universal mechanism of rapid adaptation occurring in eukaryotes [14, 15] , prokaryotes [16] , and viruses [17, 18] , enabling diverse adaptations including evasion of host restriction factors (Reviewed in [19] ). Our results suggest that gene amplification in an intermediate host may be a risk factor for broad cross-species transmission independent of other adaptive events.",

However, we discovered that a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing RhTRS1 and lacking both of the known vaccinia PKR antagonists, E3L and K3L, (VVDEDK+RhTRS1) produced 100 to 1000-fold less virus in AGM-derived PRO1190 cells relative to VV-bg (which contains both E3L and K3L) although it replicated almost as efficiently as VV-bg in AGM-derived BSC40 cells (Fig. 1A) .

            "text": "The spread of microbes from animals to humans has been responsible for most recently emerging human infectious diseases, including AIDS, bird flu, and SARS. Therefore, understanding the evolutionary and molecular mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission is of critical importance for public health. After entering a new host cell, the success of a virus depends on its ability to overcome antiviral factors in the cell, such as protein kinase R (PKR). To investigate the process of virus transmission between species, we employed a recombinant vaccinia virus (VVDEDK+RhTRS1) expressing the rhesus cytomegalovirus PKR antagonist RhTRS1. This protein inhibits some African green monkey (AGM) PKRs; however, it does not inhibit human or rhesus variants of PKR. Serial passaging VVDEDK+RhTRS1 in RhTRS1-resistant AGM cells resulted in rhtrs1 duplication in the viral genome, which improved VVDEDK+RhTRS1 replication in AGM cells. Remarkably, rhtrs1 duplication also enhanced virus replication in human and rhesus cells. In contrast, passage of VVDEDK+RhTRS1 in human cells, without prior adaptation in AGM cells, did not improve VVDEDK+RhTRS1 replication. These results support the hypothesis that amplification of a weak viral antagonist of a host defense protein in one species may enable cross-species transmission into new hosts that are nonpermissive to the initial virus. This VVDEDK+RhTRS1 replication defect in PRO1190 cells may be due to incomplete inhibition of PKR in these cells by RhTRS1. To test this hypothesis, we generated PRO1190 cells stably expressing either a PKR-specific shRNA (PRO1190-PKR kd), which resulted in a 56% reduction of PKR expression, or a scrambled control shRNA (PRO1190-ctrl kd) (Fig. 1B) . Similarly, PKR-specific RT-qPCR demonstrated a 60% reduction in PKR mRNA from PRO1190-PKR kd cells relative to PRO1190-ctrl kd cells (2578 copies or 6503 copies PKR/ng total RNA respectively) but little difference between PRO1190 and PRO1190-ctrl kd cell PKR levels (Fig. S1 ). In PRO1190-PKR kd cells, VVDEDK+RhTRS1 replication was almost completely rescued to VV-bg levels (Fig. 1C) . We detected a similar increase in VVDEDK+RhTRS1 replication after transiently transfecting PRO1190 cells with a siRNA specific for PKR, but not a control siRNA (data not shown). Sequence analysis of PRO1190 PKR identified three non-synonymous mutations relative to a previously reported AGM PKR (GenBank # EU733254) that is sensitive to RhTRS1 (Fig. S2 , [20] ). Interestingly, one of these single nucleotide variants is heterozygous in PRO1190 cells, and changes a residue (T577M) that is evolving under positive selection in primates [12] . Although additional studies will be needed to determine whether one or more of these PRO1190 PKR polymorphisms is responsible for increased resistance to RhTRS1, the results shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the block to VVDEDK+RhTRS1 replication in PRO1190 cells is mediated by PKR.",

We infected PRO1190 cells with VVDEDK+RhTRS1 at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI = 0.1). 48 hours post infection (hpi) we lysed the infected cells, titered the resulting virus, and infected new PRO1190 cells, repeating this cycle multiple times. After four passages we observed a 10-to 100-fold increase in viral replication that remained stable for at least three subsequent passages in each of three independent lineages (Fig. 2) . We next performed a competition assay to assess the relative fitness of the passaged virus in comparison to the initial VVDEDK+RhTRS1 virus. We coinfected PRO1190 cells with either VVDEDK+RhTRS1 or VV-A, both of which express eGFP, and the same competitor, VVDE3L +RhTRS1, which expresses b-gal (MOI = 0.1 for each virus). Virus produced 48 hpi was titered on permissive BSC40 cells and the specific progeny viruses were enumerated by detecting b-gal (VVDE3L+RhTRS1) and eGFP (VVDEDK+RhTRS1 and VV-A) expression in the plaques (Fig. S3 ). VVDEDK+RhTRS1 replicated ,3-fold better than VVDE3L+RhTRS1, whereas VV-A replicated 290-fold better than VVDE3L+RhTRS1, confirming that serial passage through PRO1190 cells increased the fitness of passaged viruses approximately 100-fold relative to the initial VVDEDK +RhTRS1.",

We have shown that RhTRS1 does not inhibit human or rhesus PKR in the context of VVDE3L [20] . To determine whether the adaptations that evolved during serial passage in PRO1190 cells affected the virus species tropism, we infected primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) or primary rhesus fibroblasts (RF) with VVDEDK+RhTRS1, each of the three passaged virus pools or VV-bg at an MOI of 0.1 (Fig. 3 ). As expected, VVDEDK+RhTRS1 replicated poorly and VV-bg replicated efficiently in each cell type. Remarkably, all three passaged pools replicated between 1000-to 10,000-fold better than VVDEDK+RhTRS1 in both HFF (Fig. 3 , center) and RF (Fig. 3 , right). For each pfu of VV-A, VV-B and VV-C used to infect the cells, 5.2, 1.9, and 6.3 pfu of progeny emerged from HFF and 40.8, 7.3, and 3.7 emerged from RF, respectively, suggesting that these viruses were sufficiently well adapted to enable continuous propagation in these cells (see below). However, these virus pools still replicated 10-to 100-fold better in PRO1190 than in either human or rhesus cells (Fig. 3, left) . Thus, adaptation of VVDEDK+RhTRS1 in minimally permissive AGM fibroblasts also provides a substantial replication benefit in human and rhesus cells expressing distantly related PKR proteins. To elucidate the underlying mechanism for this gain of fitness, we harvested DNA from passage 7 viruses for genetic analyses and then passaged the viruses once more in PRO1190 to generate viral stocks for biochemical and infectivity analyses.",

To determine whether gene amplification could account for the broadly improved replication of passaged VVDEDK+RhTRS1 we performed paired-end Illumina based deep sequencing (Short Read Archive #SRP033208). Based on read depth, we detected duplication of the rhtrs1 locus in all three passage 7 virus pools but not in VVDEDK+RhTRS1 (Fig. 4A) . Each of the passaged pools contained between 1.4 and 1.9 copies of rhtrs1 per genome, although these numbers reflect averages of a heterogeneous population of viral genomes. Confirming this estimate of rhtrs1 copy number, the frequency of reads in which we detected a recombination site near the rhtrs1 locus increased as a percentage of total reads in viruses predicted to have more copies of rhtrs1 (Fig. 4B) .",

We detected 3 kb products in all three virus pools, and 2.3 kb and 1.8 kb products only in the VV-A virus pool (Fig. S4B ). We were unable to obtain enough of the 2.3 kb band for further analysis, but we did characterize the 3 kb and 1.8 kb products by Sanger sequencing. The larger product was identical in all three passaged virus pools, and represents a recombination between the vaccinia virus gene L5R upstream of rhtrs1 with J2R downstream of rhtrs1. In the smaller product J2R recombined with the neoR gene, which was introduced as a selection marker during construction of VVDEDK+RhTRS1 (Fig. S3C ). These two sites represented the predominant recombination sites (85.5% and 2.8% respectively) identified by Illumina deep sequencing. However, we found additional minor recombination sites by Illumina deep sequencing, including a 15 kb duplication in VV-B. The presence of an identical recombination site in all three passaged virus pools suggests that duplication may have been present at a very low frequency in the initial virus population even though we did not detect it in the Illumina sequencing data. Regardless, taken together these data demonstrate that the copy number of rhtrs1 in the viral genome was substantially increased by passage through PRO1190 cells.",

All three passaged pools had one or more of four different single nucleotide deletions within the A35R gene at frequencies ranging from 12 to 42%. Transition mutations affecting the A24R and A37R genes were present at .50% frequencies in VV-A and VV-B respectively, but were rare or absent in the other viral pools. None of the other mutations were detected in all three pools or occurred at .50% frequency in any pool, so are unlikely to account for the improved replication of the passaged viruses.

PKR phosphorylation was elevated in all virus infected cells except VV-bg, consistent with our previous report [20] that even when RhTRS1 blocks the PKR pathway, it does not block PKR autophosphorylation (Fig. 6, lanes 3-5) . Phospho-eIF2a levels in VVDEDK+RhTRS1 infected cells were intermediate between mock and VVDE3L infected PRO1190 cells, suggesting that a single RhTRS1 gene weakly inhibits the PKR pathway (Fig. 6, lane 4) . Infection with VV-A resulted in low levels of eIF2a phosphorylation, similar to that detected in VV-bg infected PRO1190 cells (Fig. 6 , compare lanes 2 and 5), indicating that RhTRS1 amplification is sufficient to completely inhibit PKR-mediated translational shutdown at a stage after PKR phosphorylation. Together, these data suggest that PKR-mediated pressure in PRO1190 cells selected for rapid amplification of the rhtrs1 locus, and that this amplification was sufficient to enable the virus to block PKR-mediated defenses in PRO1190 cells without altering the mechanism of RhTRS1-mediated PKR inhibition.",

To test this hypothesis and determine whether the mechanism of PKR inhibition was the same in HFF as it is in PRO1190, we infected HFF (MOI = 3) and prepared cell lysates 24 hpi. In contrast to infection of PRO1190 cells, infection of HFF with VVDEDK+RhTRS1 resulted in nearly complete shut off of protein synthesis by 24 hpi (Fig. 6 , top right panel) and produced only trace amounts of RhTRS1. Compared to VVDEDK+RhTRS1, VV-A infection of HFF resulted in detectable, though still low overall levels of 35 S labeled proteins, and much more RhTRS1 (Fig. 6, lanes 9 and 10) . PKR phosphorylation and eIF2a phosphorylation were elevated after infection with both VVDEDK+RhTRS1 and VV-A compared to mock or VV-bg controls (Fig. 6 , compare lane 9 to lanes 6 and 7). These data suggest that a single copy of rhtrs1 was insufficient to inhibit the translational shutoff mediated by human PKR, but amplification of this weak antagonist resulted in partial inhibition of human PKR allowing enough protein synthesis to support a modest level of virus replication.",

We therefore serially infected HFF with VV-A, VV-B and VV-C at low multiplicity of infection (MOI = 0.1 at each passage). We were able to propagate these viruses in HFF for at least four passages. Moreover, replication increased between 5-to 14-fold after only two passages, suggesting further adaptation occurred in HFF cells (Fig. 7B) . To define mutations that may have evolved during serial passage in HFF, we performed paired-end Illumina based deep sequencing on viral DNA isolated after the fourth round of passage in HFF. Again, we did not find any mutations in rhtrs1; however, we detected an average rhtrs1 copy number of 1.7, 2.8, and 2.7 for the virus pools derived from VV-A, VV-B and VV-C, respectively, representing an average expansion of the rhtrs1 locus by approximately one additional copy relative to the PRO1190-adapted viruses. In addition, two VV gene mutations (in F7L [indel] and J6R) that arose during PRO1190 adaptation were lost after HFF adaptation, and two new mutations (in F7L [missense] and H4L) of uncertain significance appeared during HFF adaptation (Table S3) . Taken together, our study suggests the hypothesis that gene amplification acts broadly to increase replication in a variety of hosts, and may provide a molecular foothold that allows for continued speciesspecific adaptation of the virus in more resistant hosts.",

Human immunodeficiency viruses, avian influenza viruses, and the recently described Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus exemplify the ongoing threat and potential of animal viruses to spread to and among humans, highlighting the urgent need to understand the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission and adaptation to new hosts. One such mechanism, genetic locus amplification in response to selective pressure, has been observed in both viruses and bacteria [16] [17] [18] 21] . Here we demonstrate that amplification of the exogenous gene rhtrs1 is sufficient to block potent PKR-mediated inhibition and improve VVDEDK+RhTRS1 replication in AGMderived PRO1190 cells. This adaptation also expanded the species tropism of the virus, enabling markedly improved replication in otherwise resistant human and rhesus monkey cells. Importantly, VVDEDK+RhTRS1 failed to replicate in HFF to a level sufficient to sustain transmission upon serial passage, demonstrating that adaptation in PRO1190 was a critical intermediate step to expand the viral species tropism. Thus, the process of adaptation in one host may increase the likelihood of virus transmission to a variety of divergent species.",

It is not clear whether the initial duplication(s) occurred during preparation of the VVDEDK+RhTRS1 stock in BSC40 cells or during the first few passages in the PRO1190 cells. The observation of a faint PCR product from the starting virus, VVDEDK+RhTRS1 using outward directed rhtrs1 primers in one of three experiments (Fig.  S4) , and the detection of an identical recombination break point in all 3 independently passaged virus pools suggest the amplification may have been present at a very low level in the starting virus. However, amplification of the locus in VVDEDK+RhTRS1 occurred below the level of Illumina deep sequencing detection (Fig. 4) , supporting the idea that if rhtrs1 duplications are present they are rare in the initial VVDEDK+RhTRS1 stock. Additionally, we detected recombination between J2R and neoR (Fig. S4 ) only in the VV-A pool, suggesting that recombination events did arise during serial passage. Regardless of when they arose, amplifications of the rhtrs1 locus were substantially enriched during virus passage under selective pressure (Figs. 2 and 4) . A previous study demonstrated amplification of K3L as an adaptive mechanism against human PKR with strikingly similar kinetics to the current study [17] .

Therefore, we were surprised that no mutations arose in rhtrs1, although it may be that additional rounds of replication would reveal such mutations. We did, however, detect 13 mutations in endogenous vaccinia virus genes that occurred at .5% frequency (Fig. 4) . While our data suggest that none of these mutations are necessary to expand the species tropism of VVDEDK+RhTRS1 (Fig. 5) , we have not ruled out the possibility that they may provide some replication benefit. The presence of mutations in A24R, A35R, and A37R are the most intriguing, as they were either present at .50% frequency in one pool (A24R and A37R) or detectable in all three pools (A35R). None of these genes has been previously implicated as a PKR antagonist. A37R is conserved across multiple poxvirus families (http://www.poxvirus.org), but its function is unknown. A24R is a subunit of RNA polymerase. If the mutation we identified acts like some other reported RNA polymerase mutations to decrease transcription elongation [25, 26] , this mutation might result in less dsRNA production and therefore less PKR activation. A35R is a gene of unknown biochemical function that may be involved in evasion of the adaptive immune response [27, 28] . All three passaged virus pools contained nucleotide deletions in A35R at greater than 10% frequency. A35R orthologs are conserved across most poxviruses but, intriguingly, variola virus contains a truncation in its A35R Consistent with previous studies of RhTRS1 in other AGM cell types [20] , PKR, but not eIF2a, was phosphorylated in PRO1190 cells infected with VV-A. Thus, the improved replication of the passaged virus pools in PRO1190 cells was likely due to enhancement of the basic RhTRS1-mediated inhibition of PKR, and not due to another mechanism, such as dsRNA sequestration or reduction in the abundance of dsRNA. VVDEDK+RhTRS1 infected PRO1190 cells had phospho-eIF2a levels lower than that found in VVDE3L infected cells (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 4) , suggesting that even just a single copy of rhtrs1 is able to inhibit PKR function to a small degree, but amplification of the locus appears to be needed to express enough RhTRS1 to inhibit eIF2a phosphorylation potently and enable efficient viral replication. It is also possible that elevated expression of RhTRS1 is necessary to block another activity of PKR, such as autophagy or inflammasome responses [29] [30] [31] that might aid in replication.",

Although VV-A replicated to much higher titers and expressed more RhTRS1 than VVDEDK+RhTRS1 in HFF, 35 S metabolic labeling revealed relatively low protein synthesis rates and eIF2a phosphorylation was still elevated after VV-A infection compared to VV-bg. A substantial proportion of the block to VV-A replication in HFF is still mediated by PKR despite RhTRS1 overexpression (Fig. 5B) , suggesting that further adaptation in HFF may be necessary to block the PKR pathway in HFF completely. These results indicate that RhTRS1 overexpression blocks human PKR incompletely. Nonetheless, viruses that had adapted by initial passage in PRO1190s replicated in HFF at a level sufficient to enable sustained passage in HFF (Fig.7B) . Furthermore, these PRO1190-adapted viruses acquired additional changes as a result of serial passage in HFF, although the biological relevance of these changes is currently unclear.",

Our study illustrates that gene amplification of a weak viral antagonist of PKR can broaden the host range of vaccinia virus. The presence of gene families in other large DNA viruses, e.g. the cytomegalovirus US22 family, of which rhtrs1 is a member, provides indirect evidence that episodes of locus amplification have also occurred in other viruses. Adaptation of a viral antagonist through non-synonymous mutations has the potential to confer a species-specific advantage for the virus in a specific host. In contrast, gene amplification and subsequent overexpression of the antagonist is more likely to increase protein activity through mass action effects in a variety of hosts. Thus, gene amplification may be a common evolutionary strategy employed by large DNA viruses, permitting modest replication in otherwise resistant host species and providing a molecular foothold that enables further adaptations necessary for more efficient replication and spread in the new host.",

All samples were amplified in triplicate using the GoTaq 1-step RT-qPCR kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega) using PKR specific primers (#1063: 59-CACAGAATTGACGGAAAGAC; #1064: 59-ATCCCAACAGCCATTGTAGT).

Data are represented as the mean +/2 the 95% confidence interval. PKR copy number/ng total RNA was interpolated from this standard curve for PRO1190, PRO1190-ctrl kd, and PRO1190-PKR kd cells (bottom). Relative to PRO1190 cells, PRO1190-ctrl kd cells expressed slightly less PKR (20% decrease), while PRO1190-PKR kd cells had a 69% decrease in PKR expression. Similarly, PRO1190-PKR kd cells expressed 60% less PKR than PKR-ctrl kd cells, consistent with Fig. 1B. (TIF) Figure S2 Amino acid alignment of African green monkey, human, and rhesus PKR.

We identified three non-synonymous amino acid differences (grey or green highlighted residues) between the two AGM alleles. One of these differences is at a site that is evolving under positive selection in primates (green highlighted residue) [12] .
