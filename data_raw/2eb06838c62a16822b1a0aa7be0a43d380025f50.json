We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study at the onset of the influenza season. A total of 76 subjects (30-70 years of age) were recruited from the general population. The subjects were instructed to take one capsule per day of either EAP or a placebo for a period of 8 weeks. The duration of cold and flu symptoms, a primary variable in assessing effectiveness, and serum cytokine levels as well as WBC counts as secondary variables were also evaluated. Results. EAP was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the duration of cold and flu symptoms, a primary variable in assessing effectiveness. Although cold and flu symptom levels were not significantly different at a significance level of 5%, the cold and flu symptom levels of the EAP group were less severe compared to the placebo group. No statistically significant changes of serum cytokine levels as well as WBC counts were observed. Conclusion. The results showed that EAP is a useful pharmaceutical and functional food material for preventing and treating colds and flu.",

Its main immunopharmacological activities [14] [15] [16] are associated with antitumor effects [17] , increased host resistance to viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections [18] , and adjuvant effects [19] . Proximate composition of extracellular polysaccharides of Aureobasidium pullulans is carbohydrate 79.5%, sugar 3.7%, crude protein 4.2%, and moisture 3.2%. Namely, above 80% of the proximate composition is polysaccharides and there is a small amount of protein and fat (personal comm. Dr. Dong-Chan Park). It has been reported that the extracellular polysaccharides isolated from Aureobasidium pullulans are pullulan (poly--1,6-maltotriose-based exopolysaccharide, EPS) [20] , aubasidan ( -1,3-D-glucan with -1,6-branches to -1,4 side chains) [21] , and -glucan ( -1,3/1,6-D-glucan) [22] . However, the physiological activity of polysaccharides produced by Aureobasidium pullulans has been mainly studied for -1,3/1,6-D-glucan [12] . Exopolymers purified from Aureobasidium pullulans SM-2001 (EAP; its solubility is about 10% in water), the test food material used in this study, containing 13% -1,3/1,6-glucan [23] , are used in foods and have shown potent immunomodulatory activities in a mouse model [16] . In addition, EAP showed no adverse events in clinical studies designed to evaluate its effectiveness on bone metabolism improvement [24, 25] and on atopic dermatitis [26] . Therefore, -glucan is considered safe for human ingestion.",

The activation state of principal cells related to immunity can be determined by measuring changes in the serum contents of cytokine IL-1 , IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-, and INF-. To assess the effectiveness of the test food materials, the significance of the mean difference (visits 1-3) was tested for each variable included in the effectiveness test. In other words, a statistical comparison was made between the average variation before and after food ingestions in the EAP and placebo groups. To this end, normality was tested for the evaluation data. The parametric method of a twosample t-test was chosen if normality was satisfied, whereas the nonparametric method of a Wilcoxon's rank-sum test was chosen if normality was not satisfied. In addition, the above significance tests were performed on mean differences between the EAP and placebo groups between each visit after test food ingestions. To analyze the prevalence of cold symptoms, subjects recorded the duration and levels of symptoms when they contracted a cold or the flu prior to ingesting the test food. During visit 3, subjects recorded the duration and total symptom scores of cold and influenza symptoms during the test period. Accordingly, it was not meaningful to compare the mean difference between visits, considering that the rating scales used in visits 1 and 3 were different. In other words, we confirmed homogeneity between the test groups in visit 1 and evaluated the effectiveness by comparing the results between test groups in visit 3.",

The activation state of primary cells related to immunity can be determined by measuring the serum levels of the cytokines IL-1 , IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-, and INF- [1] . According to the \"Guideline for Safety and Efficacy Assessments of Functional Food on Immune Function Improvement\" from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of Korea, changes in cytokine levels, WBC counts, T cell counts, and NK cell activity in the peripheral blood should be measured when determining the functionality of immunity reinforcement in humans [35] .",

            "text": "Although EAP has shown potent immunomodulatory activities in a mouse model [16] , no immunity improvement of EAP on the human was observed in this study. The cytokine is a factor that needs to change suddenly according to the individual health condition and then return to the normal range [1] . On the normal range of blood cytokine concentration, its individual variation is very large. Thus, a large number of subjects are required to measure the normal range of cytokine concentrations [36] . Indeed, in a study of normal Korean cytokine levels, 110 subjects were studied [37] , and in a study of normal American cytokine levels, 144 subjects were examined [38] to estimate the normal range of blood cytokine concentration. Serval studies have shown that no changes in blood cytokine levels have been observed following ingestion of multivitamin and mineral supplement [39] , probiotic supplement [40] , fish oil [41] , and Cordyceps militaris [42] , which are known to help improve immunity. This may be because the cytokine level increased during the test period and then returned to normal, or the number of subjects was small, indicating that the individual deviation range was not statistically significant. In this study, the total number of subjects was 72: 36 in the test group and 36 in the control group, respectively. Therefore, the results of this study may not statistically overcome the individual variation range of the subject's cytokine level due to the small number of subjects. Further research is needed on extensive clinical studies with clear statistical numberings to confirm the effects of EAP on plasma cytokines.",

All these adverse events subsided within just a few days and were determined to have no cause-and-effect relationship with the ingestion of test food materials. Changes in blood test values were also observed in the EAP group with an increase in SGPT, TG, and -GTP values, but this was difficult to determine as being clinically abnormal. In addition, in an aspect of the respiratory morbidity, the subjects who suffered from cold during the test period appeared and then fully cured after the treatment, and no respiratory morbidity was shown in all subjects.
