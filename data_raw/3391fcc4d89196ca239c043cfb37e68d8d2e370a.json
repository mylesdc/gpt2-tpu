In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to explore differences in the intestinal microbiota between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). The results revealed that the small intestinal microbiota of suckling piglets infected with PEDV showed low diversity and was dominated by Proteobacteria (49.1%). Additionally, the composition of the small intestinal microbiota of sucking piglets infected with PEDV showed marked differences from that of the uninfected piglets. Some of the taxa showing differences in abundance between uninfected piglets and piglets infected with PEDV were associated with cellular transport and catabolism, energy metabolism, the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and amino acid metabolism as determined through the prediction of microbial function based on the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Therefore, adjusting the intestinal microbiota might be a promising method for the prevention or treatment of PEDV.",

(Pingliang, China), using three-way crossbred sows and piglets (Duroc-Landrace-Yorkshire). The saliva of sows and piglets was collected in five farrowing houses of the commercial swine farm from the third to the eighth day after the piglets were born. In brief, cotton threads were hung above each sow stall and adjusted to the appropriate height and position to ensure that the sows and piglets could touch different cotton threads. Each day, the saliva on the cotton threads was squeezed into collecting pipes, followed by replacement of the cotton threads with new ones. The presence of pseudorabies virus (PRV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and PEDV in the saliva samples was detected using PRV, CSFV and PRRSV real-time fluorescent RT-PCR kits and a PEDV-transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-porcine rotavirus triple real-time fluorescent RT-PCR kit, respectively. Based on the results from the saliva samples and clinical examination by an experienced veterinarian conducted in four sow stalls of the same farrowing house, 16 subjects were enrolled in the experiment (with one sow and three suckling piglets placed in each sow stall). All of the suckling piglets were of the same age (seven days) and breed. Two sow stalls were used to house the infected group: All of the suckling piglets in these stalls showed early symptoms of PEDV and tested positive for PEDV, and the sows were negative for other contagious diseases. The other two stalls housed the control group: All of the subjects were found negative for PEDV and were in good mental and physical states. All of the suckling piglets were slaughtered at seven days of age, and the contents of their small intestines from the duodenum to the ileum were collected under aseptic conditions and then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Milk was collected from all of the sows and stored at -20\u02daC until analysis. The protocols used in this study comply with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as described by the US National Institutes of Health as well as the protocols including all sampling methods and experimental manipulations used in this study were reviewed and approved by Gansu Chen Yu Ecological Agriculture Development co., LTD and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Lanzhou Institute of Husbandry and Pharmaceutical Science of CAAS (Animal Use Permit: SCXK201548-0710).

The diversity and abundance of microbiota observed in the present study showed that the small intestinal microbiota of uninfected suckling piglets was simple and dominated by Proteobacteria (49.1%) at the phylum level. The finding is agreement with previous studies that showed that aerobes and facultative anaerobes exhibit obvious superiority in the intestine during the first week of piglet development [11] . The variation of the intestinal microflora infected piglets by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus between uninfected piglets and infected piglets in terms of the proportions of microbiota involved in cellular transport and catabolism, energy metabolism, biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites and amino acid metabolism further suggested that the changes in intestinal flora affected their functions. It has been shown that Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria play important roles in carbohydrate fermentation, the catabolism of polysaccharides and the utilization of amino acids and proteins [11, 32, 33] . Under the challenge of PEDV infection, the quantity of Bacteroidetes taxa decreased, which might partially explain the lower relative abundance of microbiota associated with energy metabolism, the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites and amino acid metabolism in the small intestine of infected piglets. In the intestinal microbial ecosystem, many functions of microorganisms, such as carbohydrate fermentation and the catabolism of polysaccharides, are performed in cooperation with bacteria. Therefore, the changes in the relative abundances of Prevotella, Pasteurella, Moraxella, Lactobacillus, Veillonella and Actinobacillus observed under PEDV infection might result in decreases in functions associated with energy metabolism, the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites and amino acid metabolism in the small intestine of infected piglets.",

Under challenge with PEDV infection, the small intestinal microbiota of suckling piglets showed marked changes, including compositional changes in flora that are associated with cellular transport and catabolism, energy metabolism, the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites, and amino acid metabolism. The present findings can help identify new preventive measures for treating and controlling PEDV. The variation of the intestinal microflora infected piglets by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus",
