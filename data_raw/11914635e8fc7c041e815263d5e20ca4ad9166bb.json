In the present study samples were collected from forty broiler farms with respiratory manifestations to characterize IBV and E. coli. Bacteriophages were isolated and enriched from sampled farms to study its efficacy to control single and mixed infections with E. coli and IBV in vivo. Twelve out of forty farms were positive for IBV. Phylogenetic analysis of partial spike protein revealed that all positive cases clustered within the GI-23 genotype. Eight out of forty farms were positive for E. coli serogroups O26, O78, O86, O114, O119, with O125 found on three farms. Bacteriophage treatment delayed the onset and reduced the severity of clinical signs, and prevented the mortality associated with single and mixed infection with IBV and E. coli. Furthermore, in mixed infections, bacteriophage treatment significantly reduced E. coli as well as IBV shedding. Groups treated with bacteriophages showed a significant reduction of E. coli shedding that gradually decreased over time, in contrast to higher and gradually increasing shedding without bacteriophage treatment. In conclusion, bacteriophage treatment significantly reduced the pathogenicity and shedding of IBVand E. coli in mixed infections.",

Laboratory investigations revealed that IBV represents the most common pathogen detected during these outbreaks [8] [9] [10] . IB is a highly contagious disease affecting the respiratory, renal and reproductive tract of chickens. The disease caused by single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus belongs to the genus of Gamma coronavirus [11] . The spike (S) glycoprotein represents the major structural and immunogenic domain, and plays a pivotal role in tissue tropism and carry the receptor-binding site [12] . The S glycoprotein is cleaved post transitionary into S1 (globular head) and S2 (stalk) domain [13] . The S1 domain possesses three hypervariable regions (HVR 1, 2 and 3) responsible for the high genetic and antigenic variability of IBV [14] . Despite massive vaccination strategies used in Egypt, IBV extensively circulates in all over Egypt in vaccinated and non-vaccinated chickens with continuous viral evolution [9, 15, 16] . Complications between APEC and IBV infections are widely observed under field conditions and are reproduced under experimental conditions resulting in enhanced severe colibacillosis [7] and enhanced pathogenicity post IBV infection.",

Then, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter. The presence of bacteriophages was initially tested by the spot test method based on the double layer plaque technique in accordance with [24] . For this, 100 \u00b5l of APEC O78 were cultured on LB agar for 8 h, then 10 \u00b5l of the prepared bacteriophage suspension spotted onto it, and plates incubated at 37\u00baC overnight. The appearance of a clear zone in the plate indicated the presence of the lytic phage. Plaque assay was used for the titration of bacteriophages as previously described [25] .",

The high incidence of IBV in Egyptian poultry flocks suffering from respiratory manifestations (39-75.6%) has been recorded in several previous studies [8, 10, 30, 31] . The range in the incidence rate is apparently due to the differences in the age of birds, with a higher incidence in 20-30 days old birds [8] . Based on partial spike protein gene sequencing, all positive IBV samples were clustered within the Egyptian variant IBV that belongs to the GI-23 genotype [18] . All recent molecular characterization of IBV circulating in Egypt revealed the circulation of two distinct genotypes, the GI-1 vicinal strains genotype and the GI-23 local variant genotype .

These losses in addition to the high prevalence of E.coli in poultry farms' environment necessitate the use of antibiotics. However, the constant unwise use of antimicrobials in Egypt led to the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains that threaten human health and are associated with economic losses in the commercial poultry sector [36, 37] . In the present study, 20% of the collected samples were positive for E.coli. 75% of them showed resistance to three or more antibiotics which were defined as multidrug resistant. This highlights the importance for the development of alternative therapeutic approaches preventing colibacillosis.",

            "text": "In the present study, the efficacy of bacteriophage therapy in single and mixed infections with Egyptian IBV variant and/or APEC O78 has been evaluated. Results obtained revealed a significant higher persistence of APEC and IBV shedding together with higher morbidity and mortality in the mixed infection group comparing to single infected groups. This finding agrees with several previous studies [29, 42, 43] . Mechanisms behind the escalation of pathogenicity after mixed IBV and APEC infections are not yet fully understood. However, alteration of the immune response is most likely the cause not mechanical altering of the mucociliary barrier [29] . Bacteriophage treatment significantly reduced the severity of single APEC O78 challenge as well as a mixed infection with APEC and IBV. In brief, a high dose of bacteriophages administered intratracheally reduced the morbidity, prevented mortalities and significantly decreased APEC shedding compared to non-treated APEC challenge. Local application of bacteriophages at the site of APEC infection that is relatively inaccessible via the circulatory system, i.e. intra air sac administration, enables bacteriophages to eliminate the disease [44] . This explains the success of intrathoracic air sac injections in the reduction or prevention of mortality in several studies [38, 44] . In the present study with a higher bacteriophage dose and intra-tracheal inoculation, APEC was significantly reduced in the bacteriophage treated lung tissue. In the case of mixed infections, bacteriophage treatment did not only reduce bacterial counts but also significantly reduced IBV detected in the lung, and associated with reduction in morbidity and mortality in the mixed infection group but not the single IBV infected group. These results show the efficient inhibition of APEC replication associated with a reduction of IBV severity during mixed infections.",
