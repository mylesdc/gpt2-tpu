            "text": "The biggest challenge for accurate diagnosis of viral infectious disease is the high genetic variability of involved viruses, which affects amplification efficiency and results in low sensitivity and narrow spectrum. Here, we developed a new simple qPCR mediated by high-fidelity (HF) DNA polymerase. The new method utilizes an HFman probe and one primer. Fluorescent signal was generated from the 3\u2032-5\u2032 hydrolysis of HFman probe by HF DNA polymerase before elongation initiation. Mismatches between probe/primer and template have less influence on the amplification efficiency of the new method. The new qPCR exhibited higher sensitivity and better adaptability to sequence variable templates than the conventional TaqMan probe based-qPCR in quantification of HIV-1 viral load. Further comparison with COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test (v2.0) showed a good correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0.79) between both methods in quantification of HIV-1 viral load among 21 clinical samples. The characteristics of tolerance to variable templates and one probe-one primer system imply that the probe/primer design for the new method will be easier and more flexible than the conventional method for highly heterogeneous viruses. Therefore, the HF DNA polymerase-mediated qPCR method is a simple, sensitive and promising approach for the development of diagnostics for viral infectious diseases.",

Although some new methods such as isothermal amplification methods, loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) 6, 7 , rolling circle amplification (RCA) 8, 9 , recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) 10 and specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK) 11 had been developed in recent years, qPCR is still considered to be the most robust technology in clinical diagnostic assays, especially for infectious diseases 12-14 . RT-qPCR is usually accomplished by using either double-stranded DNA-binding dyes (e.g. SYBR green I 15 and SYTO9 16, 17 or fluorescence-based probes 18 . The dsDNA-binding dyes are cheaper than reagents used in the probe-based methods; however, their non-specific binding to dsDNA may result in false positive results, and inaccurate quantification 19 , and thus limits their use in qPCR for qualification of gene expression and molecular diagnosis. There are three main types of fluorescence-based probes in qPCR, including hydrolysis probes (often called as TaqMan probes) 20 , hybridization probes 21, 22 , and molecular beacons 23 . Some other types of probes, such as scorpion primers 24 , light upon extension (LUX) primers 25 and Amplifluor primers 26 were also developed for qPCR. Among these new probe types, the TaqMan probes were the most widely used for the detection and quantification of nucleic acids, and often developed into commercial kits for clinical diagnosis. Molecular beacons were more often used in the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) 27, 28 .",

Currently, emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are a serious threat to global public health. More than 70% of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are caused by viruses, and vast majority of human viruses (especially RNA viruses) have higher mutation rates than bacteria, fungi and other pathogens (e.g. mycoplasma and chlamydia).

            "text": "The principle of the novel real-time RT-PCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Highfidelity DNA polymerase has a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity to remove the mismatched bases from the 3\u2032-end of a newly synthesized DNA strand or primer. Various chemical modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, amination, and dideoxy nucleotide) at 3\u2032-end base or the 3\u2032-OH of the primer do not influence the removing (proof-reading) activity of the HF DNA polymerase 34 . A fluorescent probe (e.g. TaqMan probe) often contains a fluorophore and quencher group at 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of an oligonucleotide, respectively. The fluorophore-or quencher-modified base can be removed from the probe by HF DNA polymerase when the 3\u2032-base forms a mismatch with the template (Fig. 1 ). In fact, some HF DNA polymerase can non-specifically remove the 3\u2032 modified or unmodified base and start extension even though no mismatch occurs 35 . The removal of the fluorophore or quencher group from the probe results in the release of the fluorescent signal. Therefore, a probe can be used directly as a primer to initiate PCR amplification under the HF DNA polymerase and the emitted fluorescence during the amplification can be monitored during a real-time PCR amplification (Fig. 1) . We call the new method as HF DNA polymerase mediated real-time PCR and defined the probe as HFman probe or fluorescent primer (Fig. 1) . Compared with the conventional qPCR that requires a pair of primers and a probe, the new method needs only one HFman probe and one corresponding primer. (a) When the HFman probe fully matches with the template, the high-fidelity DNA polymerase can non-specifically recognize 3\u2032 fluorophore-modified base and remove the 3\u2032-base to initiate primer extension. (b) When the HFman probe forms a mismatch with the template at the 3\u2032-end, the high-fidelity DNA polymerase recognize the 3\u2032 mismatched base and remove the mismatched base to initiate extension. The removal of 3\u2032 fluorophore-labelled base will emit the fluorescent signal.",

For HFman probe, fluorophore group is allowed to be labelled at either 5\u2032 end or 3\u2032end. However, because only bases at the 3'-end of HFman probe can be removed by HF DNA polymerase, a 3\u2032 fluorophore labelling is thought to be more efficient than a 5\u2032 fluorophore labelling. To prove this hypothesis, we designed N9-probe-2 that has a fluorophore group at the 3\u2032 end, and performed a comparison between N9-probe-1 and N9-probe-2. The result showed that the reaction with N9-probe-2 had an earlier amplification curve with stronger fluorescence signal than that with N9-probe-1 (Fig. 2a) , supporting a HFman probe with a 3\u2032-fluorophore group is more efficient than that with 5\u2032-fluorophore group.",

RT-qPCR has a very wide use especially in diagnostics of infectious diseases. About 70% infectious diseases are caused by viruses that have higher mutation rates than bacteria and other non-viral pathogens. Therefore, it is difficult to find absolutely conserved genomic regions of some viruses (e.g. HIV-1) for primer and probe design. The presence of mismatch between primer/probe and template reduces the amplification efficiency and sensitivity of RT-qPCR, although the use of degenerate primers can slightly improve the assay. The principle of the new qPCR method mediated by the HF DNA polymerase requires the presence of mismatch to initiate the 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity of HF enzyme for removing the 3\u2032 fluorophore-or quencher-modified base from the probe.

To further test the effect of various mismatches between HFman probe and template on amplification efficiency, we synthesized four HFman probe with different bases at 3-end (Probe-A, -G, -C, and -T), and constructed four RNA templates that completely match to each of the probes ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ).

For the wild template, although the curve of the new method appeared slightly earlier and had stronger fluorescent signal than that of the conventional method, the amplification curves produced by both methods are close to each other (Ct: 23.56 vs. 27 .58), supporting the idea that both methods are comparable.

As shown above and other previous studies 34, 35 , the PR-PCR mediated only by HF DNA polymerase is unable to efficiently distinguish the wild and mutant template. In order to improve the application of the new RT-qPCR in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection, we reconstructed the new RT-qPCR reaction by adding 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Tiangen, Beijing, China) and 0.1 U Q5 HF DNA polymerase. The concentrations of HFman probe and reverse primer were 100 and 400 nM, respectively. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) oxidizes aldehyde to acetic acid mainly in the mitochondria and is a crucial enzyme in alcohol metabolism. There is a SNP (SNP rs671) with G\u2192A substitution in exon 12 of ALDH2 gene that causes a mutation of Glu487Lys and inactivates the enzyme activity 36 . We designed two allele-specific HFman probes (ALDH-probe-G and ALDH-probe-A) and a reverse primer for the detection of SNP rs671 of ALDH2. ALDH-probe-G and ALDH-probe-A were labelled by FAM (red) and CY5 (green), and completely match to homozygous wild (GG) and mutant (AA) alleles, respectively. According to the principle, the RT-qPCR with ALDH-probe-G can amplify the mutant type (AA), but not or inefficiently amplify the wild type of ALDH2 (GG). In contrast, the reaction with ALDH-probe-A can amplify the wild type (GG), but not or inefficiently amplify the mutant type of ALDH2 (AA). Both reactions can amplify the heterozygous type (GA). Comparison of the amplification curves showed that the curve with ALDH-probe-A was obviously earlier than that with ALDH-probe-G for homozygous allele GG, later for homozygous allele AA and similar to each other for heterozygous GA (Fig. 6) . Therefore, the difference in Ct values was recommended to identify gene type. We calculated the difference in Ct value by the formula Ct-FAM minus Ct-CY5. The alleles GG, AA and GA were clearly distinguished by the Ct differences of 12.98, \u22127.72 and 0.72, respectively (Fig. 6) .

To archive highly sensitivity and broad spectrum for highly heterogenetic viruses, the primers and probe should target the most conserved genomic regions of the involved viruses 29 . Furthermore, the TaqMan probe-based qPCR often limits the amplicon length between 50-150 bps to achieve high amplification efficiency 2 . For highly heterogenetic viruses, however, it is very difficult to find three completely conserved regions in a relative short genomic region that satisfy the criteria of primer and probe design. Although degenerate primers and MGB-modified probe were used to reduce the influence of mismatches of primer or probe with target on amplification efficiency, to develop highly accurate, sensitive and board spectrum detection method for highly variable viruses is still a big challenge 29 .",

            "text": "In this study, we developed a novel, simple real-time qPCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Different from the conventional qPCR, the new qPCR only needs one primer and an HFman probe ( Table 1 ). The generation of fluorescent signal was mediated by HF DNA polymerase that separates the fluorophore and quencher by the 3\u2032-5\u2032 hydrolysis of HFman probe. In principle, the HF DNA polymerase only removes the mismatched nucleotide from the primer or probe by its 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity (Table 1) . However, majority of the HF DNA polymerases show non-specific 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity and also remove the completely matched 3\u2032-base of HFman probe possibly due to the modification of fluorophore or quencher activate the 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity of HF DNA polymerase (Fig. 1) 34 . Therefore, regardless of match or mismatch between HFman/ primer and target template, the new qPCR exhibits similar amplification efficiencies (Fig. 3a) , indicating that the new method adapts well to the amplification of various mutation templates. These imply that the new HFman probe-based method is more efficient for the detection of highly variable viruses than the conventional TaqMan probe-based qPCR. Additionally, the new method has similar amplification efficiencies for different sizes (from 55 to 250 bps) of amplicons ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ), and does not require an HFman with 10 \u00b0C higher Tm value than that of primers (Table 1) . These make the primer and probe design easier and more flexible because the new method requires one HFman probe and one primer, whereas the conventional qPCR method requires one TaqMan probe and a pair of primers (Table 1) . One major limitation in the primer and probe selection for the new method is that it does not allow the formation of primer dimers which may result in non-specific result.",

We developed a HIV-1 assay with a limit of detection (LOD) of 23 copies/ml using the new method (Supplementary Table S3 ). To evaluate the compatibility of our HIV-1 assay, we performed a comparison with COBAS \u00ae AmpliPrep /COBAS \u00ae TaqMan \u00ae HIV-1 Test, v2.0, the most widely used kit worldwide with highest detection sensitivity for HIV-1 quantification, using 21 HIV-1 positive clinical samples covering HIV-1 subtypes B, CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, and CRF08_BC. All these samples could be detected by the Roche kit (VL: from 189 to 6010000 copies/ml) and our new method (VL: from 110 to 3781285 copies/ml) (Fig. 5c) , and a good correlation coefficient (R 2 = 0.79) was observed between both methods ( Fig. 5c ). In particular, our method detected 12 sample with higher viral loads than the Roche kit, possibly due to the well adaptation of our method to various variants. These results suggest that the HF DNA polymerase mediated RT-qPCR is comparable to the Roche kit and/or other commercial HIV-1 kits for HIV-1 quantification (Supplementary Table S3 ). In addition, we established assays for H7N9 (N9 gene), and human coronavirus NL63, and obtained well amplification and standard curves ( Supplementary Fig. S6) , indicating that the new method is suitable for the detection of other viruses. HF DNA polymerase can mediate the proof-reading (PR-) PCR for SNP and mutation detection 34 . We previously developed a modified PR-PCR using a ddNTP-blocked primer and a mixture of Taq DNA polymerases and HF DNA polymerase to high-efficient detection of various mutations 35 . Based on the similarity in the principle, we modified the new method by using an enzyme mixture of 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase and 0.1 U Q5 DNA polymerase and extended its application to SNP detection. A good performance was observed when SNP rs671 of ALDH2 was detected (Fig. 6) .",

Comparison was performed with the conventional RT-qPCR with TaqMan probe. The whole blood samples of healthy individuals were obtained from Taizhou Fourth People's Hospital, Jiangsu, China. The mRNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcl whole blood using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction and eluted in 60 \u00b5l nuclease-free water. The RT-qPCR reactions were performed as described above.Application of the novel method in HIV-1 RNA quantification and comparison with conventional RT-qPCR and a commercial HIV-1 kit. To prove the availability of the novel method in virus detection, we designed HFman and TaqMan probes and develop corresponding RT-qPCR methods for HIV-1 RNA quantification. The HFman, TaqMan probes and corresponding primers are located in HIV-1 integrase gene (Supplementary Table S1 ). In order to evaluate the performance of the novel method in HIV-1 quantification, we performed a comparison with a commercial kit COBAS \u00ae AmpliPrep /COBAS \u00ae TaqMan \u00ae HIV-1 Test, v2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) that is most widely used in the world using 21 HIV positive plasma samples. The samples were obtained from Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control & Prevention, China. HIV-1 RNA was extracted from 140 \u00b5l plasma and eluted into 60 \u00b5l AVE buffer using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The viral load by the commercial kit was calculated according to the manufacturer's instruction. The viral load by the novel method was calculated using the formula: Copy number per reaction * (60/3) * (1000/140). A Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess the level of agreement between the commercial kit and novel method. A range of agreement was defined as the mean of difference (bias) \u00b11.96 SD.",
