Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are classified into 7 species (Human mastadenovirus A to G) and at least 69 recognized genotypes based on serology, whole-genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses [1] . The prevalence of different HAdV types varies among different geographical regions [2] . HAdVs have been recognised as pathogens that cause a broad spectrum of diseases [1, 2] , including acute respiratory infection (ARI), gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, and meningoencephalitis. ARI is prevalent in children, and is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in the paediatric population in developing countries [3, 4] . Numerous outbreaks of ARI caused by HAdV have been reported during the last decade in many countries including China [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The HAdV types most commonly found in respiratory samples belong to HAdV-C (HAdV-1, -2, -5, -6) and HAdV-B (HAdV-3, -7) [2, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] ; however, severe or even fatal disease outbreaks are predominantly caused by only a few types (such as HAdV-14, -21 and -55) [2, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The molecular typing by HAdV hexon sequences can help to accelerate the discrimination of types, resulting in timely epidemiological examinations and improved patient care [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Several studies have shown the association between severe respiratory infections in adult and HAdV species [7] [8] [9] ; however, reports among children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in China are limited.",

Rapid detection of these viruses would enhance the outbreak response. We reported the prevalence of multiple HAdV types (HAdV-B, HAdV-C, HAdV-D HAdV-E) in paediatric patients with SARI in China from 2007 to 2010 (overlapping the H1N1 pandemic period). Consistent with previous reports [6, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , the HAdV-B and HAdV-C were the most common serotypes for ARI, and co-infection with other respiratory viruses was frequent (64 from 76, especially co-infection with RSV, HRV, HBoV and PIV3). And 32 from 76 were co-infected by two or more viruses. The previous studies on co-infection with other respiratory viruses of HAdV were limited. Our data showed the higher number of co-infection might be resulted from samples (from the severe paediatric patients) and method (molecular detection for multiple viruses, optimized SOP. . ..). Because of the high co-infection The severity of infection associated with HAdV varies depending on the different HAdV types [10, 15] . In addition, the prevalence of different HAdV serotypes varies among different geographical regions [12] [13] [14] [15] . Our study indicated that HAdV was frequently detected in SARI children from 2008 to 2010 (52/259, 20.1%) in Northern China; this frequency was higher than that of cases in Eastern China (24/293, 8.2% ) and in other studies [10] [11] [12] 19] . The reasons for the marked differences are unknown. We suggest that the cause may be the difference in species of the sample as well as the disease severity in the population studied. However, further investigation is needed. Furthermore, among the 76 HAdV samples, 25 (32.9%) were identified as HAdV-7 (HAdV-B), and 15 (19.7%) as HAdV-3 (HAdV-B) , representing the most common molecular types. Previous studies have found that HAdV-B was the most common species in southern China [26] , and HAdV-3 was the predominant type of HAdV-B. And another study reported HAdV-3 (HAdV-B) outbreak associated with febrile respiratory disease in Eastern China in 2011 [27] . In the present study the most dominant HAdV-C strains were HAdV-1 (11, 14.47%), followed by HAdV-2 (9, 11.84%), and HAdV-5 (8, 10.52%).

We have amplified the full hexon from one of HAdV-2/ 6 recombinants (GenBank accession No. KP696777). Its position on the phylogenetic tree indicated that the intertypic (HAdV-2/6) recombination occurred in the second half of the hexon gene (data not shown).

HAdV was frequently (76/552, 13.77%) detected, and HAdV-B and HAdV-C were the most predominant in Northern and Eastern China, respectively. However, we only amplified relatively conserved partial hexon sequences rather than the hypervariable region (HVR), perhaps resulting in the loss of the recombinant and variant information. More extensive studies will be needed to address the prevalence and geographic distribution of dominant genotypes of HAdV using well-matched control groups and sequential samples collected over a longer time. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, HAdV-37 (KM378014) and HAdV-57 (KM377992) are the first strains of these genotypes to be reported in inpatient children with SARI.",
