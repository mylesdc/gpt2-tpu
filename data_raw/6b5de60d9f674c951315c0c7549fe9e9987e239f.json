We reported an outbreak of 70 cases of severe pneumonia with one death of infants in Shaanxi Province, China. Sampling showed adenovirus 7 (Ad7) as the primary pathogen with some co-infections. Results: Two strains of adenovirus and two strains of enterovirus were isolated, the 21 pharynx swabs showed 14 positive amplifications for adenovirus; three co-infections with respiratory syncytial virus, two positive for rhinovirus, one positive for parainfluenza 3, and four negative. Adenovirus typing showed nine of the nine adenovirus positive samples were HAdV-7, three were HAdV-3 and two were too weak to perform sequencing. The entire hexon gene of adenovirus was sequenced and analyzed for the two adenovirus serotype 7 isolates, showing the nucleic acid homology was 99.8% between the two strains and 99.5% compared to the reference strain HAdV-7 (GenBank accession number AY769946). For the 21 acute phase serum samples from the 21 patients, six samples had positives results for ELISA detection of HAdV IgA, and the neutralization titers of the convalescent-phase samples were four times higher than those of the acute-phase samples in nine pairs.",

Pneumonia caused by adenovirus infection is usually severe especially with adenovirus serotype 7 commonly associated with lower respiratory tract disease outbreaks. During the last global survey, approximately one-fifth of all HAdV infections reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) were attributed to HAdV-7 [1, 2] , the diseases reported include respiratory tract illnesses and conjunctivitis. In infants and immuno-compromised populations, HAdV-7 can cause outbreaks of severe disease; and in a few cases can lead to death [3] . Multiple HAdV-7 genome types have been identified using restriction enzyme analyses [4] . Global prevalence patterns of these HAdV-7 genome types shift over time [1, 5] . Reported cases of adenovirus infection have increased in China recently where most of the outbreaks are caused by adenovirus 3 and one had HAdV-11; and the infected groups were primary and middle school students [6] [7] [8] . Here we report an outbreak that affected in young children of Xixiang County of Shaanxi Province, China. Clinical specimens were collected from the admitted patients and we performed pathogen detection and analysis. This showed adenovirus serotype 7 was the primary viral pathogen with some co-infection responsible for the infant pneumonia mortality. This is the first report in ten years of an outbreak of infant pneumonia caused by HAdV-7 in China, and the first report ever from Shaanxi Province.",

We found climate factors changed such as drought showed little rain and lower temperature in the same season than previous years in this area. Other virus infections, such as human respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and seasonal influenza virus may contribute to the outbreak for the other forty-nine patients whose clinical specimens were unavailable for pathogen detection. In addition, nosocomial infection can not be precluded during the outbreak. This is because six of 21 patients visited the same hospital at almost the same time after the index case. As prolonged shedding of adenovirus and its hardy nature make it an ideal agent for nosocomial transmission, nucleotide sequence comparison strongly suggested that all six patients have the same strain of adenovirus in their pharynx swabs give strong information for the nosocomial transmission of infection. A surveillance network for adenovirus infection has not been established; and adenovirus vaccines are presently unavailable in China. Most of the adenovirus infections especially severe pneumonia in infants was diagnosed clinically without laboratory confirmation, especially in county hospitals. Additionally, no HAdV-7 strains have been isolated and no population immunity survey has been reported from the Hanzhong areas. In the outbreak, there was no close correlation among most of the patients where they presented a diffused distribution and with higher occurrence in Xixiang County of the Hanzhong area. The parents of the infants denied having contact histories with similar patients or any history of travel. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the adenovirus origin for the outbreak.",

Outbreaks of adenovirus serotype 7 infection have not been reported in China during the previous ten years; whereas a sporadic case of HAdV-7 infection has been reported in Beijing recently [14] , and In 2002, Erdman et al. reported two emergent genome types of adenovirus type 7; both genome types were associated with epidemics, severe illness, and deaths outside of the United States [1] .

Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences with other adenovirus 7 genotypes shows strain 0901 HZ lost glutamine at site 253 similar to the Korean strain; and at site 495, arginine took the place of serine [17] . The role of these changes in the adenovirus antigenicity is not known and requires further study. An adenovirus infection surveillance programme is going conducted in five provinces of China, including Shaanxi province, which will be helpful for chasing the transmission origin and more molecular epidemiology baseline data establishment in China.",

These results showed that adenovirus (primarily HAdV-7) was the primary pathogen in the outbreak. This is the first report of an infant pneumonia outbreak caused by adenovirus 7 in Shaanxi Province, China. It is necessary to enhance the surveillance for a quick diagnosis of adenovirus infections for a nation-wide response to this emergency and re-emergent disease.",
