            "text": "Alternative processing of human bocavirus (HBoV) P5 promoter-transcribed RNA is critical for generating the structural and nonstructural proteinencoding mRNA transcripts. The regulatory mechanism by which HBoV RNA transcripts are polyadenylated at proximal [(pA)p] or distal [(pA)d] polyadenylation sites is still unclear. We constructed a recombinant HBoV infectious clone to study the alternative polyadenylation regulation of HBoV. Surprisingly, in addition to the reported distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d, a novel distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d2, which is located in the right-end hairpin (REH), was identified during infectious clone transfection or recombinant virus infection. (pA)d2 does not contain typical hexanucleotide polyadenylation signal, upstream elements (USE), or downstream elements (DSE) according to sequence analysis. Further study showed that HBoV nonstructural protein NS1, REH, and cis elements of (pA)d were necessary and sufficient for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. The distance and sequences between (pA)d and (pA)d2 also played a key role in the regulation of polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Finally, we demonstrated that efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2 resulted in increased HBoV capsid mRNA transcripts and protein translation. Thus, our study revealed that all the bocaviruses have distal poly(A) signals on the right-end palindromic terminus, and alternative polyadenylation at the HBoV 3= end regulates its capsid expression. IMPORTANCE The distal polyadenylation site, (pA)d, of HBoV is located about 400 nucleotides (nt) from the right-end palindromic terminus, which is different from those of bovine parvovirus (BPV) and canine minute virus (MVC) in the same genus whose distal polyadenylation is located in the right-end stem-loop structure. A novel polyadenylation site, (pA)d2, was identified in the right-end hairpin of HBoV during infectious clone transfection or recombinant virus infection. Sequence analysis showed that (pA)d2 does not contain typical polyadenylation signals, and the last 42 nt form a stem-loop structure which is almost identical to that of MVC. Further study showed that NS1, REH, and cis elements of (pA)d are required for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Polyadenylation at (pA)d2 enhances capsid expression. Our study demonstrates alternative polyadenylation at the 3= end of HBoV and suggests an additional mechanism by which capsid expression is regulated.",

            "text": "polyadenylation of BPV and MVC, (pA)d2 is located on the right-end terminus ( Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, the last 42 nt of the right-end stem of HBoV and MVC are almost identical, with only two different nucleotides in the loop ( Fig. 2A) . To confirm our 3= RACE results, total RNA of pHBoV1-WH-transfected HEK293T cells were harvested at different times (12, 24, 36 , and 48 h) and hybridized with oligo(dT) and specific primers upstream of (pA)d. RNA fragments were detected with probes spanning from nt 4745 to nt 5171 after RNase H cleavage. Polyadenylation at (pA)d and (pA)d2 were both detected by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2D) , which is consistent with 3= RACE data and suggests that a portion of VP1/VP2 encoding mRNA transcripts are polyadenylated at (pA)d2. NS1 and REH are required for polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Since (pA)d2 does not contain a typical polyadenylation signal, we determined whether the viral proteins affect polyadenylation at (pA)d2. All of the structural and nonstructural protein open reading frames were disrupted by single-nucleotide mutation, which resulted in early translation termination (Fig. 3A) . Transfection of the NS1 knockout plasmid (pHBoV1-NS1KO) resulted in a 7-fold reduction in polyadenylation at (pA)d2 (Fig. 3B, lane 3 , and C, lane 2). Cotransfection of pHBoV1-NS1KO and NS1 expression plasmid (pcDNA-NS1) restored polyadenylation at (pA)d2 (Fig. 3B , lane 4, and C, lanes 8 and 13), which suggested that NS1 is necessary for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d2. Transfection of the NP1 knockout plasmid (pHBoV1-NP1KO) to HEK293T cells resulted in decreased polyadenylation at both (pA)d and (pA)d2 as measured by using 3= RACE (Fig. 3B , lanes . PCR was performed with specific primers and products were resolved in 1.5% agarose gels.

Total RNA was isolated from HBoV infectious clone-transfected HEK293T cells at the indicated times and hybridized with oligo(dT) and HBoV-specific primers, followed by RNase H cleavage. RNAs were resolved in 1.5% agarose gels, transferred to Hybond-N \u03e9 membranes, and hybridized with probes spanning nt 4745 to nt 5171. 5 ) and Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 9) . However, the ratio of polyadenylation at (pA)d2 to (pA)d was not changed. Cotransfection of pHBoV1-NP1KO and NP1 expression plasmid (pXJ40-NP1) did not change the ratio of polyadenylation at (pA)d2 to (pA)d (Fig. 3B, lane 6 , and C, lane 10). However, the abundance of RNA transcripts polyadenylated at both (pA)d and (pA)d2 (Fig. 3B, lane 6 , and C, lane 10) increased more than 10-fold, which is consistent with the previous report that NP1 facilitates capsid protein expression (33) . These results suggested that NP1 is not required for polyadenylation at (pA)d2.",

Sequence analysis showed that a U-rich stretch is 22 nt downstream of hexanucleotide AAUAAA. Transfecting the U-rich mutation plasmids (pHBoV1mDSE1 and pHBoV1mDSE2) into HEK293T cells resulted in reduced polyadenylation at both (pA)d and (pA)d2, as determined by using Northern blotting (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 4) , suggesting that this motif is a major component of downstream elements for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d and (pA)d2. Mutating the sequences between the U-stretch and AAUAAA resulted in reduced polyadenylation at (pA)d, but polyadenylation at (pA)d2 was not changed (Fig. 6B, lane 5 ). This result shows that polyadenylation at (pA)d is not required for polyadenylation at (pA)d2. There is also a difference in the requirement of cis elements for polyadenylation at the two different sites. The sequences between nt 5159 and nt 5196 are required for efficient polyadenylation at (pA)d. Polyadenylation at (pA)d2 only requires sequences between nt 5178 and nt 5196. Replacing the (pA)d and downstream sequences with a synthetic polyadenylation signal resulted in strong polyadenylation at (pA)d but a loss of polyadenylation at (pA)d2 (Fig. 6B, lane 6) , which further confirmed that a strong polyadenylation at (pA)d inhibited polyadenylation at (pA)d2.",

We next investigated whether the distance between (pA)d and (pA)d2 plays a role in the regulation of alternative polyadenylation at the 3= end of HBoV. pHBoV1Del1 and pHBoV1Del2, in which the sequences from nt 5223 or nt 5197 to nt 5356 were deleted, were transfected into HEK293T cells. 3= RACE and Northern blot analysis showed that neither polyadenylation at (pA)d2 nor the (pA)d2/(pA)d ratio changed (Fig. 7B, lanes 3 and 4, and C, lanes 2 and 3) , which indicates shortening the distance does not affect polyadenylation at (pA)d2. As the distance between the two Polyadenylation at (pA)d2 enhances capsid mRNA and protein expression. The outcome of alternative polyadenylation is to regulate the expression level of encoded proteins. To determine whether polyadenylation at (pA)d2 affects protein expression, we first measured whether (pA)d2 affects green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in the reporter system. GFP expression did not change obviously ( Fig. 8B and C, lanes 3 and 4) when pEGFP-(pA)d was transfected into HEK293T cells in the presence of NS1 cotransfection. However, in the presence of NS1 expression, transfection of pEGFP-(pA)d2 resulted in polyadenylation at both (pA)d and (pA)d2, and the expression of GFP increased as determined using immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis ( Fig. 8B and C, lanes 5 and 6). Transfecting pEGFP-HS resulted in the loss of polyadenylation at (pA)d2 and a decrease in GFP expression ( Fig. 8B and C, lanes 7 and 8) , suggesting that polyadenylation at (pA)d2 regulates mRNA and protein expression levels. To analyze whether polyadenylation affects capsid protein expression, a VP2 expression cassette and the downstream sequence of (pA)d, with or without (pA)d2, were cloned into expression vector pXJ40-FLAG. Cotransfecting pXJ40-VP2(pA)d and an NS1 expression plasmid into HEK293T cells resulted in polyadenylation at (pA)d and the polyadenylation site of pXJ40-FLAG vector (Fig. 9B, lanes 2 and 3) . No polyadenylation at (pA)d2 was detected because of the lack of REH (Fig. 9B , lanes 2 and 3, and C, lanes 1 and 2). Similar levels of VP2 mRNA and protein were observed (Fig. 9C, lanes 1 and  2, and D, lanes 1 and 2) . However, cotransfecting pXJ40-VP2(pA)d2 with NS1 into HEK293T cells resulted in polyadenylation at both (pA)d and (pA)d2 (Fig. 9B, lane 5, and  C, lane 4) . The level of mRNA transcripts increased more than 20-fold when NS1 was cotransfected with pXJ40-VP2 (pA)d2 (Fig. 9C, lanes 3 and 4) . The expression level of VP2 protein increased at least 10-fold (Fig. 9D, lanes 3 and 4) , suggesting that polyadenylation at (pA)d2 increased the mRNA and protein expression level of capsid. Taken together, these data suggest that alternative polyadenylation at the 3= end of HBoV regulates the capsid mRNA transcript levels and results in increased capsid protein expression.",

In contrast to the distal polyadenylation sites of BPV and MVC, which are located in the right-end palindromic terminus, the (pA)d of HBoV is located about 400 nt upstream of the right-end hairpin. VP1/VP2-encoding mRNAs are efficiently polyadenylated downstream of the AAUAAA site. Polyadenylation signals include the hexanucleotide AAUAAA or its variants, the cleavage site CA dinucleotide, downstream U-rich elements, and G/U-rich upstream elements. However, (pA)d2 of HBoV is located in the loop of REH, and no classical hexanucleotide polyadenylation signal was found around (pA)d2. The last 42 nucleotides of the stem-loop structure of HBoV and MVC are almost identical. It is possible that HBoV and MVC use similar mechanisms for polyadenylation at the stem-loop region.

The sequences of this region enhanced polyadenylation at (pA)d2, but the mechanism is currently unknown. Taken together, our study has demonstrated that alternative polyadenylation of HBoV capsid-encoding mRNA transcripts is regulated both by the nonstructural protein NS1 and by multiple cis elements.",

However, cotransfection of pEGFP-(pA)d2 with pcDNA-NS1(Fig. 5C, lane 6)to HEK293T cells resulted in polyadenylation at both (pA)d and (pA)d2, and the level of RNA transcripts increased more than 10-fold(Fig. 5B, lane 6).
