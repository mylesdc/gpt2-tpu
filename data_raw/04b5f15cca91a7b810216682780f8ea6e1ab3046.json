It is likely that there are additional, as yet unidentified viruses in camels with the potential to cause disease in humans. In this study, we performed metagenomic sequencing analysis on nasopharyngeal swab samples from 108 MERS-CoV-positive dromedary camels from a live animal market in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. We obtained a total of 846.72 million high-quality reads from these nasopharyngeal swab samples, of which 2.88 million (0.34%) were related to viral sequences while 512.63 million (60.5%) and 50.87 million (6%) matched bacterial and eukaryotic sequences, respectively. Among the viral reads, sequences related to mammalian viruses from 13 genera in 10 viral families were identified, including Coronaviridae, Nairoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Polyomaviridae, Papillomaviridae, Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae, and Genomoviridae. Some viral sequences belong to known camel or human viruses and others are from potentially novel camel viruses with only limited sequence similarity to virus sequences in GenBank. A total of five potentially novel virus species or strains were identified. Co-infection of at least two recently identified camel coronaviruses was detected in 92.6% of the camels in the study. This study provides a comprehensive survey of viruses in the virome of upper respiratory samples in camels that have extensive contact with the human population.",

Each RNA sample was reverse-transcribed and amplified with a modified random amplification (Round AB) protocol as described previously [32] . PCR amplicons obtained from the pre-amplification were purified with Agencourt AmPure XP (Beckman Coulter) and subsequently fragmented by sonication using a Covaris LE220 focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris) in order to achieve efficient library generation. Library construction for Illumina sequencing was carried out for each sample individually using NEB Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs) with dual index barcoding according to the manufacturer's instructions. Library construction was done either manually or on an automated NGS workstation, Zephyr G3 NGS Workstation (Perki-nElmer). Quality of the libraries generated was evaluated using a 2200 TapeStation Nucleic Acid System (Agilent Technologies) and library DNA concentrations were measured using Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The libraries were then normalized, pooled, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 (2x125) or MiSeq (2x300) instrument, aiming for 5-10 million pair-end reads per sample following the company's standard protocols.",

            "text": "Data was primarily analyzed using the SURPI pipeline with standard parameters [33] . Briefly, Illumina reads were trimmed and classified by read mapping to the NCBI nt database. Unclassified reads were de novo assembled, and the resulting contigs and unassembled reads were classified based on translated nucleotide similarity to the NCBI NR database. Reads were binned by taxonomy, and the viral reads and contigs classified by either method were assigned, per genus per sample, to the most similar available reference in that genus, using BLAST. In cases where there were more than one virus identified per genus, reads from that genus were mapped using BWA-MEM to an index of the candidate references. For positive hits, we used relative read count thresholds based on an empirical overall barcode contamination rate (0.01%) to exclude hits with low viral read counts when other samples with high read counts for that taxon were sequenced on the same HiSeq lane. In addition, positive hits from the SURPI summary report with fewer than 100 reads were aligned to the NCBI nt database using BLASTN and manually reviewed to ensure the accuracy of virus classification before the final calls were made. The positive samples that had low number of viral reads from NGS were further confirmed by PCRs followed by amplicon sequencing (S2 Table) . In addition, all samples were screened for coronaviruses [34] , parvoviruses, orthonairoviruses, paramyxoviruses [35] , polyomaviruses [36] , and astroviruses by PCR for better sensitivity. When possible, BWA-MEM [37] and samtools [38] were used to generate consensus sequences from reads and contigs for phylogenetic analysis and further genomic analysis.",

The sequences of these 27 MERS-CoV genomes shared >99.7% identity with each other, and >99.5% identity compared to other published MERS-CoV sequences. In addition, we detected two other recently identified camel coronaviruses: camel coronavirus HKU23 in 25 camels (23.1%) and camel alpha-CoV in 100 camels (92.6%), named as camel coronavirus HKU23 Abu Dhabi and camel alpha-CoV Abu Dhabi, respectively. Out of 25 camel coronavirus HKU23 Abu Dhabi-positive samples, near full genome sequences (>85% of the length of the reference genome) were recovered from three samples with >99.7% nt identity among themselves. These sequences also shared !99.7% identity with the camel coronavirus HKU23 sequences identified previously in camels from Dubai, UAE [15] and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [17] .

The relationship between the CoVs found in this study and the known camel CoVs is demonstrated by phylogenetic analysis (Fig 2) . Notably, we observed a 92.6% co-detection rate of MERS-CoV and camel alpha-CoV (100 out of 108), and 22.2% of camels harbored all three CoVs (24 out of 108).",

            "text": "Because of the close association of camels with humans and the role played by camels in the emergence and transmission of MERS-CoV, it has become increasingly clear that camels are a critical intermediary in the transmission of viruses to humans. Thus, it is important to understand the repertoire of viruses that camels harbor and their zoonotic potential. Here we report the first study of camel respiratory viromes. Our results demonstrate that camels carry a wide variety of mammalian viruses. Among the different viruses detected in this study, some were similar or nearly identical to previously described camel viruses (96-99.7% nt identity), such as camel MERS-CoV, camel alpha-CoV, camel CoV HKU23, dromedary astrovirus, Camelus dromedarius papillomavirus, Orf virus, and camelpox virus. We also identified viral sequences that were similar or identical (92-100% nt identity) to viruses known to infect humans or animals other than camels, such as AAV, kobuvirus, and caribou feces-associated gemycircularvirus. Some viruses identified in this study, such as camel CCHFV Abu Dhabi, camel PIV3 Abu Dhabi, camel PIV4 Abu Dhabi, and camel bocavirus 3 Abu Dhabi, only shared a moderate similarity to the known viruses (84-89% nt identity), and are potentially novel. Complete genome sequencing of these viruses including camel CCHFV Abu Dhabi and camel PIV4 Abu Dhabi would further ascertain whether they should be considered novel strains or novel species. Finally, we identified sequences of a novel camel polyomavirus, camel polyomavirus Abu Dhabi most closely related to a sheep polyomavirus, with 62-69% nt identity in different gene regions. Camel alpha-CoV has been very recently found to co-circulate with MERS-CoV in camels from Saudi Arabia with a coinfection rate of 56.6% by one study [17] and 3.5% by another [16] . In this study of camels from a single live animal market in UAE, we identified co-infection of camel alpha-CoV and MERS-CoV at a significantly higher rate of 92.6%, and co-infection of camel alpha-CoV, camel CoV HKU23 and MERS-CoV in 22.2% camels. This higher co-infection rate observed could be due to different camel population tested or sampling bias. Previous studies have shown that inter-and intra-coronavirus species recombination events happen frequently and are important for coronavirus evolution [47, 48] . Natural recombination between distantly related African bat coronaviruses resulted in a NL63-like virus, an ancestor of the human pathogen, human CoV NL63, suggesting that inter-species recombination may play an important role in CoV evolution and the emergence of novel CoVs with zoonotic potential [49] . In camels, recombination events between different MERS-CoV lineages in camels have been reported [17, 50] . A more recent study provided evidence for a cross-viral family recombination of a bat coronavirus and a reovirus [51] . The observation that camels are co-infected with different coronaviruses at a high rate further supports that camels may be a rich source for recombination and emergence of novel coronaviruses.",

The close relationships of these camel viruses to viruses of other species suggest that these viruses may have the capacity to infect multiple species or that they have only recently diverged after cross-species transmission, highlighting the potentially important role that camels play in emergence and evolution of these viruses. This phenomenon might also be a reflection of the fact that these camels were sampled from a live animal market, which houses several other species, such as cattle, sheep, and goats routinely, as well as other animals (chickens, dogs, cats) sporadically. As a result, this camel population may have been particularly prone to exposure to viruses from other species. If these viruses are actively replicating in camels, it is possible that they may act as intermediate hosts, or \"staging grounds,\" for these viruses, similar to what has been seen with civets for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [52] . Interestingly, we identified a paramyxovirus genome most closely related to the human virus HPIV4, for the first time in camels. It is possible that camels may be serving as an intermediate host for this and other viruses, and they may eventually facilitate zoonotic infection.",

The seroprevalence of PIV3 in camels varies by country and study [57, [60] [61] [62] , but PIV3 genome sequences in camels were previously not reported. In UAE, antibodies against PIV3 have been detected in 5.6% of apparently healthy racing camels [61] .

As a result, the virome in these camels may or may not be representative of the diversity of viruses in normal camels. As a next step, it will be important to look at samples from MERS-CoV-negative camels from the same market to understand the viral diversity and compare the relative prevalence of these viruses.",

            "text": "It is hypothesized that camels are the intermediate animal host that allowed the ancestral MERS-CoV in bats to cross the species barrier to enter humans. A similar mechanism was proposed for SARS-CoV: the bat ancestor SARS-CoV replicated in palm civets as an intermediate and gained the capacity to infect humans [52] . Anthony et al. reported the identification of a MERS-CoV-like CoV from a bat sampled in Uganda and suggested that this virus is unlikely to pose a zoonotic threat as is; rather, recombination was likely the critical step that allowed MERS-CoV to emerge in humans [73] . Additionally, a recent study suggested possible zoonotic transmission of camelpox virus from camels to humans [74] . Therefore, it is important to consider all the viruses that are present in camels and the risk they may pose to humans in close proximity. The data presented here describes camel viruses that are similar to those that are known or thought to cause disease in humans. Multiple viruses were detected in many of the camels, indicating widespread co-infection. The fact that these types of viruses can and do co-exist in the same animal further suggests that camels serve as hosts for the diversification and evolution of mammalian viruses and are intermediate in the transmission of viruses between animals and humans.",
