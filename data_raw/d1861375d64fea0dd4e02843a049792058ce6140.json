The main aims are to (i) summarize existing approaches to influenza forecasting, (ii) present differences in measures of accuracy and evaluate the degree to which various performance measures are met, (iii) discuss limitations in the data sources, and parameter estimation that impede forecasting during outbreaks. The motivation of this paper is to inform further research on influenza forecasting and provide researchers and public health practitioners with a summary of the accomplishments and limitations in influenza forecasting.",

Similarly, Soebiyanto et al. 12 presented several AR-IMA models and evaluated accuracy based on the rootmean-squared-error (RMSE) of one-step-ahead predictions. They also considered the effects of including environmental variables such as humidity and temperature. The preferred models had RMSE approximately in the range of 0\u00c147-0\u00c161. Alternatively, Polgreen et al. 13 presented a prediction market for influenza forecasting and assessed accuracy based on the proportion of correct predictions of a particular color code representing a level of influenza activity.

A meager understanding of the natural history of the virus hinders the estimation of transmission and severity parameters in real time. Estimating the transmission potential of an emerging infection early on is important as it would help determine whether control measures should be varied and whether more stringent measures are required to control or mitigate an outbreak. 24, 25 In several publications, the transmissibility and natural history of influenza have been estimated at the household, school, or community level using observational data. 26, 27 However, data are typically unavailable or incomplete during the early stages of an outbreak resulting from a novel influenza virus. The disease severity, which is another important measure, is commonly estimated based on case fatality, hospitalization rates, and clinical attack rates. Approximations of case fatality and hospitalization rates could be underestimated due to subclinical and asymptomatic cases. Although clinical attack rates could be estimated at the community level, data on laboratory-diagnosed cases might be delayed. Nevertheless, studies conducted during the 2009 pandemic suggested that estimates of severity and transmissibility improved as the pandemic progressed. 27, 28 Data Traditional systems for monitoring ILI and acute respiratory tract infections rely on reports from general practices, family doctor clinics, diagnostic test laboratories, and public health departments for influenza surveillance. 3, 4, 14 There is typically 1-2 week lag(s) in the publishing of reports, and reported cases are sometimes retrospectively adjusted. Additionally, the exact number of influenza cases is unobtainable due to unreported cases and asymptomatic infections.",

For example, Cook et al. 31 compared H1N1-related search queries on Google Insight to traditional surveillance data for the H1N1 pandemic in Singapore. The outbreak peaked in August 2009; however, search query data suggested an earlier peak and also decreased to about 20% of the search volume around the epidemic's peak time.

However, forecasts must be interpretable to be useful. It is therefore important for studies to clearly define the predicted event, the temporal and spatial applicability of the approach, quantify the likelihood of the event either based on a probabilistic statement or relative to other similar events, and highlight the limitations (see Figure 1 ).
