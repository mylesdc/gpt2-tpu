A retrospective study of the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the cases reported by a primary healthcare sentinel surveillance network for eleven years in Catalonia was conducted. Crude and adjusted diagnostic odds ratios (aDORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the case definitions and symptoms for all weeks and epidemic weeks were estimated. The most predictive case definition for laboratory-confirmed influenza was the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for ILI in all weeks (aDOR 2.69; 95% CI 2.42-2.99) and epidemic weeks (aDOR 2.20; 95% CI 1.90-2.54). The symptoms that were significant positive predictors for confirmed influenza were fever, cough, myalgia, headache, malaise, and sudden onset. Fever had the highest aDOR in all weeks (4.03; 95% CI 3.38-4.80) and epidemic weeks (2.78; 95% CI 2.21-3.50). All of the case definitions assessed performed better in patients with comorbidities than in those without. The performance of symptoms varied by age groups, with fever being of high value in older people, and cough being of high value in children. In patients with comorbidities, the performance of fever was the highest (aDOR 5.45; 95% CI 3.43-8.66). No differences in the performance of the case definition or symptoms in influenza cases according to virus type were found.",

In our opinion, the impact of this limitation may be minimal, as other factors, such as individual and daily variations, the site of measurement, and the natural trend for physicians to round temperatures up or down, can influence the measured temperature [9] . Secondly, age, the influenza type and subtype [5] , or the season [18] might be partially responsible for differences in the performance of the variables studied. However, we adjusted for age and season, and it seems improbable that our results are invalid. Thirdly, during epidemic weeks, when physicians are aware of the onset of epidemic activity, the criteria for the sampling of suspected ILI patients might be less rigorous [28] , but we have analyzed the performance of case definitions and clinical manifestations during both epidemic weeks and in all weeks, and no relevant differences were observed.
