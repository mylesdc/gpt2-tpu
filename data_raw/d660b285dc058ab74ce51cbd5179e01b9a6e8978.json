Given early-warning signals preceding the influenza outbreak, timely intervention such as vaccination and isolation management effectively decrease the morbidity. However, it is usually a difficult task to achieve the real-time prediction of influenza outbreak due to its complexity intertwining both biological systems and social systems. By exploring rich dynamical and high-dimensional information, our dynamic network marker/biomarker (DNM/DNB) method opens a new way to identify the tipping point prior to the catastrophic transition into an influenza pandemics. In order to detect the early-warning signals before the influenza outbreak by applying DNM method, the historical information of clinic hospitalization caused by influenza infection between years 2009 and 2016 were extracted and assembled from public records of Tokyo and Hokkaido, Japan. The early-warning signal, with an average of 4week window lead prior to each seasonal outbreak of influenza, was provided by DNM-based on the hospitalization records, providing an opportunity to apply proactive strategies to prevent or delay the onset of influenza outbreak. Moreover, the study on the dynamical changes of hospitalization in local district networks unveils the influenza transmission dynamics or landscape in network level.",

In addition, surveillance capacity for such detection can be costly, and many countries lack the public health infrastructure to identify outbreaks at their earliest stages.

            "text": "The dynamic network marker/biomarker (DNM/DNB) is our recently proposed method. It is a generalized methodology to identify the tipping point or pre-transition state which is a critical state before the catastrophic event, 9, 10 by mining the dynamical information from both horizontal high-dimensional data and longitudinal historical records. Regarding the influenza outbreak as a tipping point at which the system undergoes a critical transition, then there is a common understanding that the dynamical process of the system can generally be expressed by three states ( Figure 1B) , that is, a normal state with high resilience, a pre-outbreak state (the critical state) with low resilience, and an after-outbreak state with possible high resilience. The normal state is a steady stage, during which there are no many clinic visiting patients. The pre-outbreak state is defined as the limit of the normal state immediately before the tipping point. In this pre-outbreak stage, the process is usually reversible to the normal state if appropriately treated, implying the criticality of the preoutbreak state. Unlike the traditional detection of the after-outbreak state, the DNM enables the identification of the pre-outbreak state or critical state that generally has no clear abnormalities but with future trending of deterioration or critical transition. This method has recently been successfully applied to a variety of biological progresses to detect the early-warning signals to an irreversible catastrophic stage, such as the cell differentiation process, 11 the process of cell fate decision, 12 the critical transition in the immune checkpoint blockade-responsive tumour, 13 the multi-stage deteriorations of T2D, 14 acute lung injury, 15 HCV induced liver cancer, 16 cancer metastasis, 17 and many others. [18] [19] [20] [21] In this study, DNM method was employed to explore the dynamical information based on a combination of city network and the high-dimensional clinic hospitalization records, which are from over 278 clinics distributed in 23 wards in Tokyo, Japan, and 225 clinics distributed in 30 districts in Hokkaido, Japan. The results show that the DNM method successfully identified the critical state just before the outbreak of influenza as a realtime surveillance system. Such a system may enable a rapid response for the preventive care or the implementation of interventions to a health epidemic. In addition, this work unveils the influenza transmission dynamics or landscape in a local district network level, based on the measured data. The advantage and effectiveness of the DNMbased system is also demonstrated by the comparison between DNM and other surveillance systems of flu pandemic.",

B, According to the DNM theory, the process of a time-dependent non-linear system is divided into three states, including a normal state, a pre-outbreak state and an after-outbreak state. The abrupt increase in the DNM score indicates the pre-outbreak state, ie, the tipping point just before the upcoming catastrophic influenza outbreak that results in a boost of clinic-visiting patients. C, Based on the historical and current clinic records, and regional geographic characteristics of a city, the DNM score is able to provide the early-warning signals of the upcoming influenza outbreak as a real-time indicator monitoring both the local and global records as well as the network structure, and the detailed algorithm is provided below.",

A, Based on the geographic distribution of 23 wards and their adjacent relationship, a 23node neighboring network model is constructed.

Shown as in Figure 3, the early-warning signals were detected by DNM method for each seasonal outbreak of influenza. It can be seen that the flu outbreaks around the early January is quite regular from years 2010 to 2015, while that in year 2009 is an exception. The novel H1N1 virus was detected in 2009 pandemic that was reported in Mexico first and then spreading around the world, which caused an early flu outbreak in Tokyo spanning from the 30th to 50th weeks (around October) of year 2009. Therefore, for each flu epidemic later developing into massive outbreak, the DNM score is sensitive and increases significantly at least 3 weeks (leading time) before the boost of hospitalization counts (Figure 3), indicating the emergence of the critical transition into a catastrophic pandemic. To better illustrate how DNM works, we show the local DNM landscape as in Figure 4. It can be seen that the first-found DNM signals are about 3-9 weeks ahead the flu outbreak point defined at the peak of hospitalization counts. The successful prediction of each flu outbreak suggests the robustness and effectiveness of DNM system in detecting the upcoming influenza outbreak based on the observed data. Besides, we presented the dynamical evolution of local DNM scores in respect of ward-network. Figure 5 shows the dynamics of the network of year 2014 in terms of local DNM scores. It can be seen that both the local DNM for each node and the correlation between each pair of adjacent wards are at a low-level at the F I G U R E 3 The prediction of annual seasonal influenza outbreak in Tokyo city between the years 2009 and 2016. Based on the public historical information of flu-caused hospitalization between 1 March 2009 and 31 March 2016 inTokyo, Japan, each seasonal influenza outbreak is predicted by DNM. The DNM score was calculated based on a 5-wk sliding window scheme. In each figure, the y-axis is the average number of patients in each clinic; the x-axis represents a period spanning from the 17th week (the first week in May) to the 60th or 61st week (the last week in March). There are 52 weeks in years 2009 and 2011, and 53 wk in other years. The pink circle points to the peak of average patient counts, ie, the flu outbreak, and the blue star mark indicates the first warning time (tipping point) signalled by the DNM score. Clearly, DNM is able to predict the outbreak before the drastic increase of the patients beginning of the process (the 22nd-34th week). When the system approaches to the outbreak point, the signal arises to indicate the abnormal change in the whole network, that is, both the local DNM and the correlation between adjacent wards increases sharply, which are the necessary conditions of the DNM. Besides, it is seen fromFigure 5Ethat the initial signal (the first red node) appears in Chuo Ward (node 3) in 34th week, which is consistent with the historical records",

In each landscape figure, the local DNM scores for 23 wards in Tokyo are presented annually. The red column points to the first emergence of the warning signal, while the pink column indicates the flu outbreak. The definition and calculation of local DNM score are shown in the Methods section. Clearly, the warning signals are earlier than the outbreaks 4 | DISCUSSION The annual flu outbreak gives substantial impact to public health and the whole economy of Japan. Those outbreaks cause sickness, deaths, and quarantines, which are the three main factors which would result in reduction of human wellness as well as worker productivity. The deterioration in worker productivity would directly lead to a substantial impact in the economy. Additionally, transportation and production industries, for instance, would be heavily affected by the flu pandemics due to reasons such as border closures. According to ABARE, an Australian Research Agency, economy and industries in many countries will be seriously affected, for instance, Japan was predicted to have a decrease of 6.1% in gross domestic product (GDP) due to flu pandemic. From time to time, F I G U R E 5 The dynamical evolution of flu-progression network in Tokyo. Based on the local DNM scores for 23 wards in Tokyo during the year 2014, the dynamical evolution of flu-progression network is presented, i.e., networks respectively in (A) the 22nd wk, (B) the 25th wk, (C) the 28th wk, (D) the 31st wk, (E) the 34th wk, (F) the 37th wk, (G) the 40th wk, (H) the 43rd wk, and (I) the 46th wk. The nodes are coloured by the scaled value of local DNM score, while the thickness of the edges represents the correlation between a pair of adjacent wards in Tokyo. It can be seen that there is no significant changes in the network (eg, the 22nd-34th week) far from the flu outbreak caused by influenza A virus H3N2 in the 43rd week. However, when the system approaches the outbreak point (eg, the 40th week), there are tremendous changes in both nodes and edges, reflecting the obvious early-warning signals of the upcoming outbreak, provided by the DNM system new strains emerge and cause global pandemics. To fight against influenza epidemic, it is of great importance to construct a monitoring system dependent solely on robust information, such as the hospitalization counts. In this study, DNM method shows its potential and power in detecting the early-warning signals to the influenza outbreak, which may lead a new way of public real-time surveillance for epidemic diseases.Specifically, in line with our previous works on the tipping point or critical transition analysis of complex diseases with genomic datasets, we identified a pre-outbreak state of influenza epidemic through mining the longitudinal clinic records. In particular, a major advantage of our method is that DNM can extract the dynamic information from high-dimensional data, ie, simultaneously monitoring hundreds of districts and evaluating the outbreak risk by the landscape/local DNM score, as shown inFigures 4 and 5. It should be noted that the DNM-warning system presented in this work is solely based on counts of hospitalization. Given more clinic information and new discriminant input patterns, DNM-based monitoring system is expected to reliably predict the flu outbreak in terms of sensitivity and accuracy.
