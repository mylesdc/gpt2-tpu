They are also a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly and immunocompromised adults. High levels of neutralizing antibodies, mostly directed against the viral fusion (F) glycoprotein, correlate with protection against either hRSV or hMPV. However, no cross-neutralization is observed in polyclonal antibody responses raised after virus infection or immunization with purified F proteins. Based on crystal structures of hRSV F and hMPV F, we designed chimeric F proteins in which certain residues of well-characterized antigenic sites were swapped between the two antigens. The antigenic changes were monitored by ELISA with virus-specific monoclonal antibodies. Inoculation of mice with these chimeras induced polyclonal cross-neutralizing antibody responses, and mice were protected against challenge with the virus used for grafting of the heterologous antigenic site. These results provide a proof of principle for chimeric fusion proteins as single immunogens that can induce cross-neutralizing antibody and protective responses against more than one human pneumovirus.",

            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is the leading cause worldwide of severe acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI, mainly bronchiolitis and pneumonia) in infants and very young children. The estimated new cases of ALRI each year owing to hRSV infections are more than 33 million in children younger than 5 years, with 10% of these resulting in hospital admissions. hRSV infections also cause 60,000-120,000 deaths each year in young children, with 90% occurring in developing countries (Nair et al, 2010; Shi et al, 2017) . Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is also a virus of clinical significance (van den Hoogen et al, 2001) , second only to hRSV as a cause of ALRI in young children (Edwards et al, 2013; Schuster & Williams, 2013) . Both hRSV and hMPV also have a clinical impact in the elderly and in adults with cardiopulmonary disease or impaired immune systems (Hall et al, 1986; Dowell et al, 1996; Falsey et al, 2005; Panda et al, 2014) . hRSV and hMPV have been recently reclassified in the orthopneumovirus and metapneumovirus genera, respectively, of the newly created Pneumoviridae family, which was detached from the original Paramyxoviridae family (Afonso et al, 2016) . Hence, hRSV and hMPV share clinical and biological features, although they also have important differences, for example, in the number of genes or in the proteolytic processing of their respective fusion (F) glycoproteins (van den Hoogen et al, 2002) .",

Based on knowledge gained about the antigenic structure of these two proteins, we engineered a series of chimeric proteins in which certain epitopes of hRSV F were grafted onto hMPV F and vice versa. When mice were inoculated with the purified chimeras, they elicited antibodies that neutralized both hRSV and hMPV. Furthermore, in cases that were tested, immunization of mice with the chimeric proteins afforded protection against a challenge with the virus used for grafting of the heterologous antigenic site. Passive transfer of the mouse sera also reduced significantly lung virus titer after challenge, demonstrating the prominent role of antibodies in the protection provided by the chimeric F proteins.",

In contrast, the antibodies induced by the F-415 chimera showed substantial binding not only to hMPV F but also to the hRSV postfusion F protein ( Fig 3A) . The level of antibody binding to postfusion hRSV F was even higher with sera from mice inoculated with F-416 and significantly higher (P < 0.001) than sera from mice inoculated with wild-type hMPV F. To assess whether the antibody binding to hRSV F observed with sera from mice inoculated with F-415 or F-416 was reflected in neutralizing activity against this virus, the mouse sera were tested in a microneutralization assay ( Fig 3B) . Again, the sera of mice inoculated with the wild-type hMPV F or hRSV F protein had substantial neutralization titers (IC 50 ) only against the homologous virus. In contrast, the sera of mice inoculated with either F-415 or F-416 had sizeable neutralization titers against hRSV, in addition to neutralizing hMPV. In summary, the antigenic characteristics of the F-415 and F-416 chimeras, reflected in their reactivity with hRSV F site II-specific mAbs (Fig 1C) , correlated with their capacity to induce murine antibodies that bound hRSV F and neutralized hRSV infectivity, which was particularly prominent in the case of F-416. We note, however, that in some sera no quantitative correlation was found between binding and neutralization titers; for example, serum from mouse #5 inoculated with F-415 had low levels of hRSV F-binding antibodies ( Fig 3A) but neutralized hRSV very efficiently ( Fig 3B) .",

Although there was some spread of the hRSV-neutralizing titers of individual mice, those inoculated with F-416 had on average higher neutralization titers than those inoculated with F-415. However, in both groups some individual mouse titers reached values close to those of mice inoculated with postfusion hRSV F. Reduction in hRSV replication in the lungs of inoculated mice clearly correlated with the noted induction of antibodies that neutralized hRSV infectivity ( Fig 4B) . Whereas hRSV reached high titers in the lungs of mice inoculated with either CpG or hMPV F, there was no detectable virus in the lungs of mice inoculated with postfusion hRSV F. Two of the mice inoculated with the F-415 chimera (#6 and #7) had no detectable virus in their lungs. These two mice also had the higher titers of hRSV-neutralizing antibodies in their sera (compare Fig 4A and B) . As a group, mice inoculated with F-415 protein had a substantial reduction in lung virus titers compared with CpG and hMPV F controls. Remarkably, the lungs of all mice inoculated with F-416 were free of detectable virus, demonstrating the efficacy of F-416 vaccination for protection against hRSV infection.",

Partial sequences of the F-410 and F-411 chimeras, color coded to indicate the origin of their antigenic site IV residues. Amino acids shared by hMPV F and hRSV F are shown in purple. The remaining sequences of F-410 and F-411 are derived from prefusion hRSV F. B Surface representation of the hRSV F structure stabilized in the prefusion conformation, as reported (McLellan et al, 2013a) . One of the protomers is shown as a red ribbon. Antigenic site IV is magnified and colored as in (A) for the F-410 and F-411 chimeras. Yellow sticks represent a disulfide bridge between Cys416 and Cys422. C ELISA binding results of mAbs specific for hRSV F (left panels) or hMPV F (right panels) with the proteins indicated on the left. mAbs specific for hRSV F bind to epitopes of antigenic site \u00d8 (D25), antigenic site II (Mz and 47F), or antigenic site IV (101F and 107F). mAs specific for hMPV F bind to epitopes of antigenic site II (MF14), antigenic site IV (MF11, MF16, and MF29), or an epitope shared by hRSV F and hMPV F (MPE8). 101F epitope is also shared by hRSV F and hMPV F. the aim is to develop vaccines that will cross-protect against related viruses from the same family, such as the Flaviviridae Zika and dengue viruses (Barba-Spaeth et al, 2016) . Beyond viruses, universal vaccines are also being designed for Neisseria meningitidis with chimeric variants of the factor H binding protein that incorporate epitopes of highly divergent bacterial strains (Scarselli et al, 2011) . In this study, we have produced chimeric proteins of hRSV F and hMPV F. Together, these two viruses represent the major global burden of ALRI in very young children. Since palivizumab (Pz), a humanized neutralizing murine mAb (The IMpact-RSV Study Group 1998) currently used for prophylactic treatment of infants, recognizes an epitope of hRSV F antigenic site II, this site has received much attention in the hRSV vaccine field. The structure of hRSV F site II is a helix-turn-helix motif (Toiron et al, 1996) conserved in the prefusion and postfusion conformations of the F protein. Thus, hRSV F site II has been grafted onto different protein scaffolds to focus the antibody responses elicited against those unnatural antigens to a site in hRSV F, which is recognized by neutralizing antibodies (McLellan et al, 2011a; Correia et al, 2014; Luo et al, 2015) . The results obtained so far have had limited success, since the antibodies induced in mice were not neutralizing despite being able to bind hRSV F. Only in one case, in which site II was grafted onto an immunoglobulin scaffold, did the resulting immunogen induce antibodies in mice that neutralized hRSV in vitro, although with relatively low efficiency (Luo et al, 2015) . In another case, the site II scaffold induced hRSV-neutralizing antibodies in macaques, but not in mice, after repeated doses (Correia et al, 2014) .",

In addition, by ELISA the chimeras showed the antigenic characteristics of hRSV F site II (Fig 1C) . In fact, F-416 showed an affinity for Mz similar to that of hRSV F although F-416 had a 10-fold reduced affinity for mAb 47F. Nevertheless, both F-415 and F-416 were able to elicit in mice very significant antibody responses against hRSV F (Fig 3) . In addition, all mice immunized with three doses of F-416 were fully protected against a hRSV challenge.

Grafting of other antigenic sites, like those specific to prefusion hRSV F, deserves being tested. The yield of certain chimeric proteins, as shown in Fig EV1, turned out to be extremely low. In that sense, it is worth noting that grafting of hRSV site II yielded proteins that could be expressed and purified while incorporation of hMPV F site II into either postfusion or prefusion hRSV F ablated the expression of the matching chimeric proteins (Fig EV1) . Thus, fine tuning of changes introduced in chimeric proteins may be critical for their expression and immunogenicity. The use of other expression systems or incorporation of chimeric proteins into viral vectors (Liang et al, 2017) or virus particles (McGinnes et al, 2015) are alternatives to improve production and/ or immunogenicity of chimeric F proteins. Nonetheless, the results presented here represent a proof of principle to design chimeric proteins that may be used as single immunogens to induce crossneutralizing and cross-protecting immune responses against the important Pneumoviridae members, hRSV and hMPV.",
