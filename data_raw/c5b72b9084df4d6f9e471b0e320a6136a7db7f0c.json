Exemplified by the common vampire bat, we demonstrate the use of metabarcoding to infer predator population structure alongside diet assessments. Growing populations of common vampire bats impact human, livestock and wildlife health in Latin America through transmission of pathogens, such as lethal rabies viruses. Techniques to determine large-scale variation in vampire bat diet and bat population structure would empower locality-and species-specific projections of disease transmission risks. However, previously used methods are not cost-effective and efficient for large-scale applications. Using bloodmeal and faecal (Chiroptera, Phyllostomidae, Desmodontinae) (Greenhall et al., 1983 ).",

The common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is one of three extant species of vampire bats Before the introduction of domestic animals, common vampire bat populations in Latin America were likely small, as the bats' only source of bloodmeals presumably was large wild animals. However, the proliferation of domestic animals following European colonization created an abundant and reliable food source, which seems to support larger population sizes of vampire bats (Costa & Esb erard, 2011; Delpietro, Marchevsky, & Simonetti, 1992; Fenton et al., 1992; Voigt & Kelm, 2006) .",

            "text": "Large populations of common vampire bats impact both human and animal health. Vampire bats are the primary reservoir of human and livestock rabies in Latin America, a virus which causes a universally lethal encephalitis and has a host range spanning all mammals (Delpietro, Lord, Russo, & Gury-Dhomen, 2009; Salm on-Mulanovich et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2009; Warner et al., 1999) . Vampire bats may also transmit trypanosome parasites to domestic horses and cattle (reviewed by Hoare (1965) ) and act as reservoirs and potential vectors of pathogenic bacteria and viruses (Bai et al., 2012; Brand\u00e3o et al., 2008; Lima et al., 2013; Sabino-Santos et al., 2015; Volokhov et al., 2017) . Although culling of vampire bats is a widespread practice for rabies control, recent work has questioned its efficacy and cost-effectiveness and instead advocated for vaccination of susceptible species and ecological strategies to prevent exposures (Anderson et al., 2014; Blackwood, Streicker, Altizer, & Rohani, 2013) . Appropriate use of either strategy relies critically on knowledge of local vampire bat-prey interactions; however, existing methodologies to study vampire bat diet are limited. Stable isotope analyses of bat tissues have been commonly applied and can distinguish between domestic livestock and wildlife, but are unable to distinguish prey at the species level (Streicker & Allgeier, 2016; Voigt & Kelm, 2006) . Other studies using DNA markers have been more specific, but failed to identify prey in large proportions of samples and used time-consuming approaches that do not easily scale to large data sets (Bobrowiec, Lemes, & Gribel, 2015; Carter, Coen, Stenzler, & Lovette, 2006; Ito, Bernard, & Torres, 2016) . This illustrates that while genetic approaches offer an attractive solution to reconstruct vampire bat diets with high specificity, existing methods",

These complex spatial dynamics challenge prediction of localities at risk of rabies outbreaks; however, recent work has shown that genetic inference of vampire bat population structure can identify the future geographic pathways of ongoing epizootics . Genetic tools for simultaneous inference of vampire bat diet and population structure are therefore desirable to forecast which areas rabies is likely to invade next, and the species that will be at risk of spillover infection. Such information could together guide the timing and species to be targeted for vaccination. Moreover, tools for large-scale analysis of bat diet would help to forecast changes in human rabies risk following deforestation or hunting-driven declines in preferred prey or conversely, how recovery of wildlife due to conservation efforts could reduce human rabies.",

            "text": "One potential solution to the technical limitations of previous studies of vampire bat diet is to draw on recently developed advances in biodiversity assessment linked to environmental DNA (eDNA), where second-generation sequencing is applied to DNA extracted from environmental samples such as soil, water, gut contents and faeces (Bohmann et al., 2014; Taberlet, Coissac, Hajibabaei, & Rieseberg, 2012a) . Ideally, this approach would be applied to samples collected from vampire bat roost environments, enabling analyses to be conducted over larger geographic scales without the need for time-consuming capture and sampling of wild bats. Today, the principal approach for sequencing informative DNA in eDNA mixtures is the so-called DNA metabarcoding approach, in which 5 0 -nucleotide-tagged primers (Binladen et al., 2007) are used to PCR amplify mitochondrial mini-barcodes of taxa within a taxonomic group (Taberlet, Coissac, & Pompanon, 2012b) . The amplicons are subsequently sequenced in parallel on a second-generation sequencing platform. After processing the resulting sequences, taxa can be identified by comparing the obtained \"barcode\" sequences to DNA reference databases . The ability to only sequence informative DNA markers and to process and sequence many samples in parallel make metabarcoding a cost-effective and efficient way to assess biodiversity. Furthermore, if the DNA reference database and chosen barcode marker allow it, assignments can be made for prey down to the species level. Given this, metabarcoding has experienced increasing popularity and is now used in biodiversity assessment (e.g., Chariton, Court, Hartley, Colloff, & Hardy, 2010) and animal diet studies (e.g., Bohmann et al., 2011; Deagle, Kirkwood, & Jarman, 2009; Soininen et al., 2009 ). Metabarcoding has recently been applied to determine hosts of pathogen-transmitting invertebrate blood-feeders, for example, mosquitoes (Logue et al., 2016) and sand flies (Kocher et al., 2017) . Metabarcoding of vampire bat diet, however, represents a distinct methodological challenge, compared to, for example carnivores or generalist predators, as the primers that target mammalian prey will inevitably also amplify bat DNA. In such studies, predator sequences are in excess to a point where they can prevent detection of prey taxa (e.g., Deagle, Eveson, & Jarman, 2006; Shehzad et al., 2012) . To optimize detection of prey taxa, they are often reduced through presequencing measures, such as predator blocking primers (Deagle et al., 2009; Vestheim & Jarman, 2008) . Post-sequencing, remaining predator sequences are used to validate predator species identity after which they are discarded (e.g., Pi\u00f1ol, San Andr es, Clare, Mir, & Symondson, 2014) . Co-amplified predator sequences might, however, offer an overlooked opportunity to get insights into predator population structure simultaneously with the diet analysis.",

For each area and for all areas combined, the expected number of each of these prey was computed using the prey densities in that area and the total number of prey detections. The number of observed prey in each area was calculated as the number of prey detections using metabarcoding. Subsequently, prey preference was calculated using a Pearson's chi-square goodness of fit test, testing for agreement between the observed and the expected numbers of prey individuals from each prey species. Note that the results should be interpreted with care, given the low expected numbers of some prey species. As the number of chicken prey detections was low (two total detections combined across all sites), the prey preference was computed for only mammalian prey species (cow, pig, sheep), using the same method as described above.",

As such, fewer prey sequences could be assigned when using the COI primer set (Figure 2b) , with obvious consequences for prey detection power. For example, while the 16s primer set detected prey in 90.7% of samples, the COI marker only detected prey in 82.2% of samples (Table S1b) . Furthermore, while for the 98 cases in which mammal prey was detected, both markers identified the same taxa, the 16s primers enabled 16 additional mammalian prey detections, while the COI primer set only enabled three additional mammalian prey detections (Figure 2c ). This difference was to some extent outweighed by the ability of the COI primer set to detect birds, arthropods and nematodes (Figure 2b,c) .",

However, this co-amplification allowed us to examine population structure in the common vampire bat alongside identification of diet items. To our knowledge, this is the first time that metabarcoding has been used to simultaneously assess population structure and diet. This has, however, been shown with metagenomics of primate faecal samples (Srivathsan, Ang, Vogler, & Meier, 2016; Srivathsan, Sha, Vogler, & Meier, 2015) . As the metagenomics approach relied on shotgun sequencing of total DNA, apart from information on both expected and unexpected diet taxa it yielded whole primate mitogenomes and data on intestinal parasites and bacteria. In contrast, as metabarcoding is a targeted approach in which only specific markers within taxonomic groups of interest are sequenced, it is more cost-effective than metagenomics. There is therefore a tradeoff between metagenomics and metabarcoding in the amount of data obtained both across and within taxa and the cost of sequencing, and thereby in how many samples can be screened. This trade-T A B L E 1 Number of common vampire bat samples in which vampire bat and vertebrate prey were detected through metabarcoding. Furthermore, the number of identified prey taxa in samples with prey detections Horse Donkey F I G U R E 3 Percentages of common vampire bat vertebrate prey taxa identified within each Peruvian ecoregion and for all samples combined off is important in animal diet studies that require many samples to be processed, for instance, in the case of vampire bats where many samples need to be screened to assess disease transmission risks at large geographic scale. However, in the present study, the use of a taxonomically broad metabarcoding marker allowed us to detect non-target diet taxa such as intestinal parasites and arthropods, while allowing us to discern diet even to the species level and determine vampire bat population structure. This shows that while metabarcoding arguably does not generate as comprehensive data as metagenomics, with thoughtful primer selection it is possible to use its capacity to process many samples while obtaining more data than presence-absence of expected diet taxa. In the following, we discuss our metabarcoding methodology to enable future metabarcoding diet studies to couple information on diet and population structure, we discuss the use of this approach to screen common vampire bat bloodmeal and faecal samples, and we discuss the specific findings regarding the common vampire bat in Peru.",

Predator DNA is generally in excess, even to the point that it swamps the prey DNA (e.g., Deagle et al., 2006; Shehzad et al., 2012) . One approach to reduce PCR amplification of predator DNA is to use predator blocking primers (Deagle et al., 2009; Vestheim & Jarman, 2008) , although coblocking of prey has been reported (Pi\u00f1ol, Mir, Gomez-Polo, & Agust \u0131, 2015) .",

Instead, we optimized amplification of prey DNA in the metabarcoding PCRs. Both low amounts of template and PCR inhibitors (such as co-extracted heme compounds, Akane, Matsubara, Nakamura, T A B L E 2 Arthropod and nematode taxa identified through metabarcoding of common vampire bat faecal extracts using metazoan COI primers Takahashi, & Kimura, 1994) can limit PCR amplification, and thereby sequencing, of taxa that are in low proportions and/or are not well amplified by the primers (Chandler, Fredrickson, & Brockman, 1997; Murray et al., 2015; Polz & Cavanaugh, 1998) . Therefore, we carried out an initial qPCR screening to ensure that we added the maximum template amount to the metabarcoding PCRs without causing PCR inhibition (Murray et al., 2015; Shapiro & Hofreiter, 2012) . Additionally, we used the qPCR to determine the minimum number of PCR cycles to be run in the metabarcoding PCR to minimize PCR stochasticity and bias against poorly amplified taxa (Pi\u00f1ol et al., 2015; Polz & Cavanaugh, 1998) . Furthermore, we used relatively short mitochondrial markers to optimize detection of fragmented prey DNA (Deagle et al., 2006) , and we used two different markers in order for their prey detections to supplement each other. For each marker, three PCR replicates were made per sample to reduce effects of PCR stochasticity and optimize prey detection and error removal during bioinformatic processing (Alberdi et al., 2018; Polz & Cavanaugh, 1998) . These measures enabled us to overcome challenges in using metabarcoding to assess the diet of a blood-feeding predator that is in the same taxonomic group as its prey, without the use of blocking primers and to detect vertebrate prey in 93.2% of samples (Table 1) , which far exceeds previous DNA-based vampire bat diet studies that detected prey in 25%-50% of samples analysed (Bobrowiec et al., 2015; Carter et al., 2006; Ito et al., 2016) .",

In our study, mammal prey by far outweighed chicken detections (Figures 1b and 3) . Furthermore, when comparing detected prey with numbers of available vertebrate prey, we found fewer chicken detections in the prey than what would be expected based on chicken availability, while cows and pigs were overrepresented in the diet compared with availability (Table S1d) , although these analyses do not account for differences in biomass. These findings are in agreement with those of a study in Brazilian Amazonas that found that even though chicken was the most attacked prey, pigs were highly preferred in relation to prey availability, which suggested a preference for mammalian prey (Bobrowiec et al., 2015) . However, when we compared preferences for only cow, pig and sheep, the bats did not have obvious preferences for pigs (Table S1e ). While avian DNA was rare in common vampire bats and restricted to chickens in our study (Figure 3) (Galetti, Pedrosa, Keuroghlian, & Sazima, 2016) . We identified tapir (Tapirus sp.) in bloodmeals from four of 13 analysed bats in the MDD130 site in the Amazon (Figure 1 ). Based on the employed markers, we could not determine which tapir species the bats had fed on, but geographic distributions of tapir species indicate that it can have been lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris). Identifying tapir in about a third of the bats at this site indicates that tapirs might be a reliable and accessible food source for the vampire bats here. Tapirs are commonly hunted by Amazonian communities where they occur and can be rapidly depleted due to their slow reproductive rates (Peres, 2001) . If the bats rely on tapir, this creates a potential conflict between bats and humans for food; if tapir populations are depleted by human hunting, bats might shift to other wild mammals or humans, which would have consequences for disease transmission patterns and risks. As mentioned, we also detected wildlife in two of three additionally analysed bloodmeal samples from hairy-legged vampire bats (Table S2) , which further indicates the bats' dependence on wildlife in this site.",

Detected arthropods are therefore likely ectoparasites ingested during grooming (Aguirre, Herrel, & Van Damme, 2003; Greenhall, 1972) . However, it is also conceivable that ectoparasites might be ingested while the bats feed from vertebrate prey, which if confirmed, would support the hypothesis that blood feeding in vampire bats might have evolved from a previous specialization on ectoparasitic arthropods of larger animals (Arata et al., 1967; Fenton, 1992; Gillette, 1975) .",

First, more than one individual prey can only be detected if they are different species. Second, multiple vampire bats can consume blood from the same prey individual, even on the same night (Greenhall, Schmidt, & Lopez-Forment, 1971) , meaning that detection of, for example, four tapir feeding events does not necessarily indicate that four tapirs were present and fed upon. Finally, prey detected in an individual bat might not be prey that was directly preyed upon by the bat itself as common vampire bats regurgitate and share bloodmeals with roost mates that did not manage to feed (Wilkinson, 1984) . Despite these limitations, our results show that metabarcoding is an efficient tool for high-throughput molecular characterization of variation in the feeding behaviours of vampire bats, and that it can reveal both vertebrate prey, arthropods and gut parasites if a broad taxonomic marker is chosen.",

In contrast to Sanger sequencing that produces one sequence per marker per sample, metabarcoding produces thousands of sequences, of which some carry errors such as those arising during PCR and sequencing (see e.g., Alberdi et al., 2018) . We used filtering approaches and OTU clustering to optimize reliability of the resulting sequences (Alberdi et al., 2018) . But in contrast to OTU clustering with the aim to approximate species equivalents, we clustered at a high similarity to balance detection of intraspecific variation with identifying only real intraspecific variation. This metabarcoding methodology can be extrapolated for simultaneous assessment of diet and predator population structure in metabarcoding diet studies of other predators in which predator DNA is co-amplified with the prey and where the marker has intraspecific variation for the predator.",

            "text": "In our study, both employed markers had clear geographic structure for the common vampire bat (Figure 4) . The mitochondrial markers from all bats from the coastal sites west of the Andes were distinct from bats at other sites. For the 16s haplotype, they differed with 6 bp from the other identified 16s haplotype, and for the COI, they differed with 23 and 25 bp from the two other COI haplotypes ( Figure 4 and S1b). This indicates that the Andes act as a barrier for dispersal, at least for female vampire bats. Mitochondrial geographic structure has been reported in the common vampire bat in the cytochrome b (Ditchfield, 2000 (Clare, 2011; Martins et al., 2009; . The high site-specificity in mtDNA, but not in nuclear markers, can be explained by the social organization of the bat, where female offspring stay in their natal group unless their mothers die or move, while males disperse (Wilkinson, 1985) . studied population structure of the common vampire bat in Peru using a cytochrome b marker and revealed more haplotypes than the two 16s and three COI haplotypes detected in the present study (Figure 4 ). This can be explained by the higher intraspecific variability of the cytochrome b region (Hajibabaei, Singer, Clare, & Hebert, 2007; Tobe, Kitchener, & Linacre, 2011) . If a more fine-scaled haplotype assessment is needed in future studies, a cytochrome b marker should therefore be used. It is important to note that the caveat of using mitochondrial markers is that it limits inference of population structure to females. In the case of the common vampire bat that has male-biased dispersal and where males have been linked to disease spread, this limits the power of mitochondrial markers for prediction of spread of vampire bat-transmitted pathogens . For this purpose, nuclear metabarcoding markers should be used to complement the mitochondrial population structure . However, for other research questions and purposes, the ability to use metabarcoding to simultaneously screen many samples for diet and be able to infer mitochondrial population structure \"free of charge\" can open up novel insights. To achieve this obviously requires choosing a study animal (and populations) with intraspecific mitochondrial diversity within a relatively short marker. Furthermore, it requires careful primer selection to choose metabarcoding markers with the desired level of intraspecific diversity for the predator, while optimizing amplification of diet taxa.",

Future studies could exploit this noninvasive sample collection technique to scale up vampire bat diet and population structure assessments to larger numbers of samples.

Adaptation of this methodology will enable future animal ecology studies to, to some extent, offset the trade-off between metagenomics and metabarcoding by harnessing the ability of metabarcoding to process many samples cost-effectively while extending detections beyond presence-absence of expected diet taxa. When designed carefully, this approach can thereby yield an efficient, scalable and noninvasive assessment of population structure and diet, which can potentially yield novel insights in future animal diet studies.",

This methodology can be used to obtain novel and noninvasive insights into common vampire bat ecology through coupling of dietary findings and population structure and to inform projections of which species are at risk of spillover infection by vampire bat-transmitted pathogens, such as rabies. Thereby, this analytical tool can aid development of strategies for control of vampire bat-transmitted rabies to humans, wildlife and livestock. For instance with regard to vaccination of susceptible prey species, which relies on knowledge of local vampire bat-prey interactions.",

Our results show clear phylogeographic structure of the mitochondrial COI and 16s markers in the common vampire bat in Peru: the 16s and COI haplotype 2 were restricted to the coastal sites, while at the nine southern collection sites in the Andes and Amazon, the 16s and COI haplotype 1 co-occurred in all bats (Figure 4). Bats at the three collection sites in the western slopes of the Andes in northern Peru were the only ones to harbour the third COI haplotype (Figure 4).",

A contingency table of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by samples was created for each primer set, and copy numbers of OTUs were normalized across samples.BLASTN  (Altschul et al., 1997) was used to compare the OTUs against the NCBI GENBANK database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and the output was imported into MEGAN COMMUNITY EDITION version 6.5(Huson, Auch, Qi, & Schuster, 2007). OTUs assigned to ascomycetes were removed from the COI data set. In the contingency table, OTUs were grouped into categories according to assigned taxonomy: common vampire bat, vertebrate prey and for COI, invertebrates.Within each of the categories, the proportion of sequences of each OTU was calculated in each sample. Within OTUs assigned to common vampire bats, vampire bat assignments to samples were made if an OTU had >95% (16s) and >99% (COI) of sequences assigned to vampire bat OTUs in the sample (erroneous OTUs were in lower frequency for the COI marker). For vertebrate prey identifications, a conservative approach for removing erroneous OTUs was used. Initially, OTUs that never had >5% of sequences in any sample within the vertebrate category were removed. Following this, vertebrate prey OTUs were assigned to samples if they had >10% of sequences (bloodmeals and individual faecal samples) and >0.5% of sequences (pooled faecal samples) of sequences within the vertebrate prey category. Only one invertebrate OTU was identified, and all assignments of this OTU were retained.Taxonomic assignments of OTUs assigned to samples were made with either primer set, and the NCBI GENBANK database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and BARCODE OF LIFE DATABASE (BOLD;Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2007), were used for taxonomic assignment of the 16s and COI OTUs, respectively. Species assignments were made if both markers had 100% match to only the same species, and genus assignment if either marker had 100% matches to several species within the same genus. For invertebrates, remaining OTUs generally had poor reference database coverage, and identifications were made to taxonomic family level or higher taxonomic levels against all barcode records in BOLD. For each overall area, vampire bat vertebrate prey was visualized as pie charts on a map made in GGMAP version 2.7.",

For the COI, the reported intraspecific sequence divergence is compared with what we detected. Some have suggested that high mtDNA differentiation indicates the presence of cryptic common vampire bat species(Martins et al., 2007), but less marked geographical structure in nuclear markers suggests that populations are not entirely isolated",
