Common etiology includes respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, or parainfluenza [5, 6] . The economic and social implications of bronchiolitis are substantial. In North America, hospitalizations attributable to bronchiolitis have increased twofold over the past two decades [7, 8] . The disease currently accounts for more than 100 thousand hospital admissions annually at an estimated cost of $1.73 billion [9] . In the United Kingdom, 1 in 3 infants will develop bronchiolitis in the first year of life and 2 to 3% of all infants require hospital admissions. In England alone, there were 30,451 secondary care admissions for bronchiolitis between 2011 and 2012 [10] .",

They comprised 8 randomized controlled trials [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [28] [29] [30] and 3 cohort studies [31] [32] [33] conducted in Asia, enrolling a total of 904 inpatient infants presenting with bronchiolitis. Sample size of the studies varied between 24 and 133 participants, with age ranging from 1 to 24 months. The studies were published between 1997 and 2015 in English (n = 9) [17-21, 28-30, 32] and Chinese (n = 2) [31, 33] language. Four studies were multicenter [17, 18, 28, 30] and seven were single-center [19-21, 29, 31-33] . Study duration ranged from one day to one week. In all studies, bronchiolitis was diagnosed by a physician based on symptoms of acute wheezing or respiratory distress. In seven studies, the infants were diagnosed as first time wheezers [17-19, 21, 28-30] . Another one study recruited a combination of wheezing and non-wheezing patients [20] . No specific information was provided in three studies [31] [32] [33] (Table 1) . Three studies were funded by university or government agencies [18, 28, 30] , whilst the other eight studies had no sponsorship [17, 19-21, 29, 31-33] . The main characteristics and results of included studies were summarized in Tables 2 and 3 . Clinically diagnosed with symptoms of cough, episodic panting and chest oppression, emphysema and in some cases rales, wheeze, and low fever.",

Our review found that two studies reported significant benefit associated with the use of CAM in the primary outcome of length of hospital stay. The first study (n = 66) was a cohort study conducted by Wang et al. and reported that Chinese herbal medicine (Shuang Huang Lian) reduced duration of hospitalization by 1.8 days compared to ribavirin [31] . The second study (n = 89) was a randomized controlled trial undertaken by Saad et al. and demonstrated that vitamin D decreased length of stay by 2.5 days compared to placebo [29] . On the contrary, Nacetylcysteine, zinc, and magnesium had no benefit on the length of hospital stay [17, 19, 21, 28] . Studies of Chinese herbal medicine, vitamin D, N-acetylcysteine, and magnesium showed some benefits with respect to clinical severity scores [17, 21, 28] [30] , oxygen saturation [30, 33] , and symptom resolution [29] [30] [31] 33] . Nonetheless, findings from the primary studies should be interpreted cautiously, given the heterogeneity across trials in the CAM treatment studied, outcome reporting, and other differences in trial design and conduct, as well as insufficient, and in some cases lack of rigorous, evidence for the different interventions (e.g., most of the studies of herbal medicine were cohort studies and there was only single study for many of the CAM interventions, of which most had a small sample size).",

No study identified in this review reported a patient-centered outcome. Instead, a number of studies, especially those which examined herbal decoctions used \"cure rate\" or a global assessment as an outcome. It was uncertain how these criteria were established, but the definitions were not uniform across studies. Furthermore, there is currently no universally validated bronchiolitis scoring system in clinical practice. In our review, Kose et al. [21] used the clinical severity score (CSS) tool developed by Wang et al. [34] , whereas Modaresi et al. [28] used respiratory distress assessment instrument (RDAI) as a measure [35] . Albeit these two studies analogously examined magnesium, the use of different clinical severity scoring tools for predicting the course of illness may affect the treatment outcomes due to the dissimilar parameters being assessed.",

Our findings provide further evidence of inconsistency and problems with outcome reporting that can be a source of bias in this literature. There is a need to assess outcomes across the CAM studies. However, systematic assessment of treatment efficacy is often complicated by the wide range of outcome measures used by investigators. Therefore, it is necessary to agree on a core outcome set to be measured and reported in future studies assessing the impact of CAM on bronchiolitis. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) recommends future studies to ascertain clinically relevant outcomes, particularly rates of hospitalization, need for more intensive services in the hospital, costs of care, parental satisfaction with treatment, and development of longer-term respiratory problems to facilitate clarity in communication about outcomes and increase the value of existing and future data [36] . Also of potential concern, the findings in this review may be subject to publication bias which is often difficult to detect in systematic reviews with few studies. Due to the heterogeneity in the outcomes assessed, the method of reporting, and the various types of CAM used, assessment of publication bias was not performed. Hence, we were unable to rule out the presence of publication bias in this body of literature.",

Although some manufacturers have commenced to standardize herbal products, there is still a general lack of consistency in the market. On the other hand, research on supplements has been encumbered by the absence of reliable assays to detect micronutrient deficiencies. For instance, the emergence of vitamin D assays from the preliminary competitive protein binding assays through to immunoassay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay have shown numerous analytical challenges. Immunoassay is the most popular method in consideration of ease of use, cost, and rapidity, however, the accuracy and specificity remain an issue of discussion [38] .

The study by Deng et al. also compared Chinese herbal medicine with third generation cephalosporins, aminophylline, oxygen, digitalis, or frusemide [33] , suggesting the presence of secondary bacterial infection.

Another limitation was that the review did not search for grey literature, including conference abstracts, contact with experts and trials registries. As such, we may have missed some studies. In relation to this limitation, we recommend a judicious interpretation of the evidence synthesized in this review as there may be unpublished studies with negative results that we did not include, and thus overestimating the effectiveness of CAM interventions based on the studies that were identified and included. In view of the sparsity of evidence in this area, we recommend that negative and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or otherwise made publicly available so that the literature can provide evidence base for clinical decision-making.
