Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective and safe vaccine against the divergent H5N1 influenza viruses. In the present study, we designed a tetra-branched multiple antigenic peptide (MAP)-based vaccine, designated M2e-MAP, which contains the sequence overlapping the highly conserved extracellular domain of matrix protein 2 (M2e) of a HPAI H5N1 virus, and investigated its immune responses and cross-protection against different clades of H5N1 viruses. Results: Our results showed that M2e-MAP vaccine induced strong M2e-specific IgG antibody responses following 3-dose immunization of mice with M2e-MAP in the presence of Freunds' or aluminium (alum) adjuvant. M2e-MAP vaccination limited viral replication and attenuated histopathological damage in the challenged mouse lungs. The M2e-MAP-based vaccine protected immunized mice against both clade1: VN/1194 and clade2.3.4: SZ/406H H5N1 virus challenge, being able to counteract weight lost and elevate survival rate following lethal challenge of H5N1 viruses. Conclusions: These results suggest that M2e-MAP presenting M2e of H5N1 virus has a great potential to be developed into an effective subunit vaccine for the prevention of infection by a broad spectrum of HPAI H5N1 viruses.",

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop safe and effective antiviral strategies for the prevention of any future pandemic of H5N1 HPAI [2, 3] , among which vaccination is still the most effective means to prevent influenza A virus infection. Due to current vaccine technologies facing annual problems with vaccine-strain matching, some conserved antigens of influenza A virus become promising target for the development of influenza vaccines with broad cross-protection.",

The native M2 protein exists as a homotetramer formed by two disulfide linked dimers, with each monomer consisting of 97 amino acids [4, 5] . The 24-amino-acid extracellular domain of M2 protein (M2e) is remarkably conserved across influenza A subtypes [6] . Passively transferred anti-M2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) accelerated lung viral clearance [7] , and mAbs recognizing the N-terminus highly conserved epitope in M2e protected mice from lethal influenza A virus challenge [8] , implying that M2, in particular M2e, may serve as an attractive vaccine target. Currently, the rapid evolution of H5N1 virus and the co-circulation of multiple antigenic variants in multiple regions determine that development of H5N1 vaccine with cross-protection against divergent H5N1 viruses would be inevitable. Although a number of M2e-based vaccines have been reported to provide broad-spectrum protection against ordinary human influenza virus infection [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , the cross-protective effect to divergent H5N1 viruses was undocumented.",

The H5N1 viruses leading to human infections still belong to the avian type [22] . M2e vaccine designed on sequences of human influenza virus H1, H2 or H3 subtype may not provide the same protection against H5N1 virus leading to human infections [11] .
