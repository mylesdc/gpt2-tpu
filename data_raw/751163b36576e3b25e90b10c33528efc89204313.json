Smartphone applications (apps) have the potential to enhance surveillance data transmission. Methods: The Central African Republic (CAR) Ministry of Health and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) conducted a 15-week pilot project to test a disease surveillance app, Argus, for 20 conditions in 21 health centers in Mamb\u00e9r\u00e9 Kad\u00e9i district (MK 2016). Results were compared to the usual paper-based surveillance in MK the year prior (MK 2015) and simultaneously in an adjacent health district, Nana-Mamb\u00e9re (NM 2016). Wilcoxon rank sum and Kaplan-Meier analyses compared report completeness and timeliness; the cost of the app, and users' perceptions of its usability were assessed.",

            "text": "Results: Two hundred seventy-one weekly reports sent by app identified 3403 cases and 63 deaths; 15 alerts identified 28 cases and 4 deaths. Median completeness (IQR) for MK 2016, 81% (81-86%), was significantly higher than in MK 2015 (31% (24-36%)), and NM 2016 (52% (48-57)) (p < 0.01). Median timeliness (IQR) for MK 2016, 50% (39-57%) was also higher than in MK 2015, 19% (19-24%), and NM 2016 29% (24-36%) (p < 0.01). Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis showed a significant progressive reduction in the time taken to transmit reports over the 15-week period (p < 0. 01). Users ranked the app's usability as greater than 4/5 on all dimensions. The total cost of the 15-week pilot project was US$40,575. It is estimated that to maintain the app in the 21 health facilities of MK will cost approximately US$18,800 in communication fees per year. Conclusions: The app-based data transmission system more than doubled the completeness and timeliness of disease surveillance reports. This simple, low-cost intervention may permit the early detection of disease outbreaks in similar low-resource settings elsewhere.",

The Technical Guidelines to support this strategy emphasize the identification of priority diseases using standardized case definitions, reporting mechanisms, epidemiological data analysis and field investigation, outbreak response, communication and feedback [1] . Completeness and timeliness of disease reporting are essential attributes of an effective disease surveillance system [1] [2] [3] . Yet, in low-resource settings it is challenging for health facilities to deliver paper-based surveillance reports to national authorities in a timely manner [4, 5] . Smartphone applications (known as apps) have been developed to support data transmission between health facilities and district offices in a number of low-income countries, including several in sub-Saharan Africa [2, 6, 7] . Apps have the potential to improve surveillance [8, 9] and to hasten control of potential epidemics. To our knowledge, apps have been used to collect and transmit data on a limited number of diseases [3, 5, 7] or in an emergency context [10, 11] but not on a large portfolio of health conditions in a context of post-conflict insecurity. This report describes the implementation and evaluation of an app surveillance system for the notification of Alerts and transmission of Weekly Reports on 20 conditions from 21 health facilities in the southwestern part of Central African Republic (CAR), in a pilot study entitled \"Projet d'Alerte Pr\u00e9coce\" (PAP; Early Warning Project, in French).",

For the purpose of this pilot study, the Ministry of Health (MOH) identified 21 'sentinel' health facilities (3 hospitals, 18 health centers) as these were the principal facilities still functioning within the district and represented all seven sub-districts. Eleven of the health facilities were located in the sub-district of Berberati, two in each of the sub-districts of Gadzi, Gamboula and Amada Gaza, and one in each the sub-districts of Carnot, D\u00e9d\u00e9 Makouba and Sosso Nakombo. The district health office, which includes the office of the Director of Surveillance, is located in the city of Berb\u00e9rati. Travel time by car or motorcycle from the health facilities to the district health office ranges from 25 min for the closest facility to 9 h for the most distant. Communities in the district are connected by earth roads but lack public systems of water, sewer and electricity.

For an Alert, the numbers of cases, hospitalized patients and deaths are submitted in an open text box format. In the Weekly Reports, the number of cases and deaths for each notifiable disease are submitted as a single SMS; hence a complete report requires a total of 20 SMS messages. Data transmission of the SMS messages occurs through a Universal Serial Bus (USB) modem connected to the laptop computer server maintained by the Director of Surveillance of the health district. The modem contains a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card that receives and transfers SMSs into a MySQL database, using Frontline SMS software [15] . After having submitting data to the server, users receive an acknowledgment on their smartphones for each disease notification successfully transmitted. In case of failure in delivery to the server, the app displays an error message on their smartphone screen. In this situation users are required to re-submit the messages.",

The booster-training workshop permitted troubleshooting of technical problems and included an agreement by focal points to begin transmission of Weekly Reports early (48 h before the submission deadline). The Director of Surveillance of the health district received training and supervision on the use of Argus on the laptop server for 3 hours weekly during a period of 3 months (March -May 2016).

If one were to consider timeliness as the receipt of the first SMS transmission of a Weekly Report, the timeliness in MK 2016 would be 74% (IQR 60-80%). Figure 5 shows the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for time to transmit a complete Weekly Report grouped by 3-week time periods during the pilot. There was a significant progressive reduction in transmission time over the 15-week period (p < 0.01). Consistently each week, health centers across the district initiated electronic transmission of the Weekly Reports as required by the study protocol (96% of occasions); notably, sub-districts showed no significant difference in this regard (Table 2 ). Yet, completed transmission and report timeliness was significantly lower in a number of sub-districts in both centrally-located lowrisk security zones, and in more distant medium-risk security zones. The mean scoring of the usability of the app reported by the 21 focal points was 4 . 5-5/5 for all 27 questions on the three dimensions studied: ease of use, usefulness and efficiency (data not shown). The total cost for the 15-week pilot was US$40,575. This was composed of i) US$10,950 in capital costs: 30 smartphones (US$2250), 30 solar chargers (US$2700), and two laptop computers (US$6000)); ii) US$5200 communication fees (US$1800 fleet services, US$3400 SMS charges); iii) US$225 transportation costs in three isolated health facilities iv) US$4100 local personnel, and v) IT consultant services based in Geneva (US$20,100). It is estimated that to maintain the system in the 21 health facilities of MK will cost approximately US$18,800 per year in communication fees; this represents US$17.20 per health facility per week.",

            "text": "Mobile phone-based surveillance systems have been pilot tested in several contexts in the past decade. General syndromic surveillance projects in Papua New Guinea [22] , Cambodia [2] , and Madagascar [23] have produced moderate improvements in the completeness and timeliness of reporting, e.g. an increase in completeness from 40% prior to 70% during the pilot in Papua New Guinea. Targeted surveillance programs for malaria [24] , rabies [3] , and influenza in Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya [7] , respectively, produced considerable improvements in report timeliness, eg. a reduction in the median reporting delay for influenza in Kenya from 21 to 7 days. Mobile The proportion of transmission initiated = Total reports partially or fully received \u00d7 100 / total N reports expected from sub-districts) b The proportion of transmission complete = Total reports fully received \u00d7 100 / total N reports expected from sub-districts) c As the surveillance focal points were absent from their health facilities for the booster-training workshop in Berberati during epidemiological week 14, they did not submit their Weekly Reports until returning the following week. Therefore completeness, but not timeliness of reports, was calculated for week 14 technology appears also to have enhanced surveillance in emergency settings, such as following the earthquakes in Sichuan, China [10] and Haiti [11] . However, larger, comprehensive mobile phone-based surveillance systems have not been assessed in post-conflict settings with ongoing insecurity. This project assesses the impact, feasibility, and cost of using mobile technology for the surveillance of a broad range of notifiable conditions using a simple SMS-based application in a post-conflict setting. Our study shows that, within weeks, the completeness and timeliness of weekly surveillance reports can be considerably improved, and the improvement maintained, despite the remoteness of the healthcare centers and primitive road conditions. Although sub-districts were highly compliant in submitting weekly reports on their mobile devices, the proportion whose transmissions were successfully completed differed significantly ( Table 2) . Of the two distant sub-districts with the medium-level security risk (Gadzi and Amada-Gaza), one managed a high level of completeness (Gadzi 73.3%) relative to the other (Amada-Gaza 43%). Conversely, two sub-districts in areas of low security risk near the capital (Sosso-Nakombo, Dede-Makouba) managed only 66.7% and 56.7% levels of completeness, respectively. The consistently high level of submission of weekly reports from all sub-districts suggests that remoteness and level of insecurity did not constrain the use of the technology in the health centers. Rather, we suspect that the differences seen between sub-districts in report completeness and timeliness may relate more to the quality of the communications network, the aptitude of the participating staff and, in several settings, the need for motorcycle taxi transport to a nearby community to access a telecommunications network. The electronic reporting system in the present project was rated as highly usable by participating staff. This may reflect a readiness of the staff to adopt new technology for digital surveillance, however we do not have baseline information with which to measure changes in perceptions or technical skills. The cost of the pilot was higher than mobile disease surveillance interventions reported in other contexts [6] . This is due to the necessary use of smartphones, the provision of these devices to all health facilities, the purchase of 'fleet' services from multiple cellular network providers, the costs of SMS transmission, the adherence to the 'zero reporting' protocol on a relatively large number of diseases (N = 20), and the need for considerable IT consultant services in the developmental stage. The projection of local operating costs beyond the pilot stage, US$17.20 per health facility per week, includes communication fees, but does not estimate the cost of ongoing technical support and staff training. Although still high, this cost is more comparable to that reported elsewhere [2, 3, 7, [22] [23] [24] .",

This pilot project focused only on electronic transmission of data from health facilities to the district office; there was no extension to the national level, although the app provides such functionality. Surveillance data that were aggregated and analyzed at the health district office were transmitted verbally by mobile phone to the national office. Clearly, smooth electronic integration of the district program with the national surveillance and health information systems will be vital in the future. We have assessed the impact of smartphones on the quality of disease reporting in a district disease surveillance program. No attempt was made to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the technology's effects on the broader dimensions of the IDSR system. According to the national IDSR protocol, cases and deaths of most of the listed conditions are to be notified immediately as Alerts as well as in a summative manner in the Weekly Reports, however, it is apparent from Table 1 that the Alert function is underused. Clearly more intensive training and supervision is required to ensure an immediate reporting of these conditions so as to enable a timely public health response. Comparison was made of the completeness and timeliness of reporting in the district of MK during the pilot period (MK 2016) with that observed in the district during the same time period the previous year (MK 2015). However, the poorer quality of reporting in 2015 may have reflected not only the limitations of a paper-based system, but also the residual effects of civil unrest on the functioning of health facilities in the district at that time. Only a simple cost analysis is presented; a full cost comparison and cost-benefit analysis merits future study. Usability of the system was measured with a short semi-quantitative questionnaire. The responses of the focal points show little variability and the app were ranked highly on all dimensions. It is possible that the instrument used was not adequately sensitive and/or that participants chose to provide a positively biased evaluation of the app to the investigators.",

To be considered 'on time', weekly reports were to be received by the Director of Surveillance of the health district by 17:00 h on the Wednesday following the end of the epidemiological week of the report (24:00 h Sunday), that is, within 65 h. Timeliness was measured only for Weekly reports, not Alerts, in this pilot study. Duration of transmission: calculated as the time interval between the reception of the first SMS of a complete weekly report and the last SMS of the report. Usability of the app was assessed at the end of the 15-week period by the 21 surveillance focal points who completed a custom tool adapted from that described by Schnall et al. [29] and Lewis et al. [30] to assess three aspects: ease of use, usefulness, and efficiency of the app. Responses on the selfadministered 27 item questionnaire were given on a 5 point Likert scale (1-low to 5-high)",
