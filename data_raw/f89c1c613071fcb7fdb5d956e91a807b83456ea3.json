Furthermore, in a preliminary study, we have shown that while nasal challenge with TNF\u03b1 fails to produce acute effects, it produces latephase plasma exudation (i.e., extravasation and luminal entry of plasma) [16] , a response characteristic of ongoing inflammation [17] . We have also observed that this response may be associated with increased nasal mucosal output of granulocyte mediators [16] . While our observations suggest a role for TNF\u03b1 in upper airway conditions characterised by inflammation, information on the nature of this response is scarce. Further information in this field is warranted for several reasons: it may be used to determine whether or not anti-TNF measures should be evaluated for upper respiratory tract conditions. Furthermore, studies in allergic rhinitis may elucidate specific roles for TNF\u03b1 in type-1 allergic inflammation, which may not be done in allergic asthma where type-1 features may be blurred by chronic inflammatory features.",

Plasma exudation is a specific feature of inflammation and increased levels of plasma proteins in airway mucosal surface liquids characterize allergic rhinitis and upper respiratory tract infections [19, 20] . Accordingly, and supported by observations on increased levels of TNF\u03b1 in allergic rhinitis [13, 14] as well as common cold [21, 22] , TNF\u03b1 may be a pro-inflammatory factor in inflammatory conditions of the nasal airway.",

We have no specific explanation for the discrepant findings, but a variable eosinophil activity at baseline may be one option: Thomas et al. observed that inhalation of TNF\u03b1 to mild asthmatics increased eosinophil infiltration [9] whereas this was not the case in healthy subjects [10] .

The only difference in TNF\u03b1 induced effects between the groups Nasal lavage fluid levels of ECP prior to and 24 hours post TNF\u03b1 and sham challenge was that the nasal mucosal numbers of neutrophils were increased in healthy subjects following TNF\u03b1 challenge but not in patients with allergic rhinitis. However, TNF\u03b1 did produce a numerical increase in neutrophils also in allergic rhinitis, which did not reach statistical significance (possibly due to a somewhat higher baseline). Furthermore, MPO, as marker of neutrophil activity, was significantly increased in both study groups. Taken together, no marked differences emerged between healthy subjects and patients with allergic rhinitis regarding TNF\u03b1-induced effects. However, further studies may be warranted in order to elucidate whether TNF\u03b1 has a specific role in allergic airway conditions: such studies are warranted based on observations that patients with allergic rhinitis feature increased tissue expression of TNF\u03b1 mRNA and TNF\u03b1 protein [13] [14] [15] . Moreover, a basis for further exploration may be the recent observation that mice sensitized to ovalbumin and subjected to gene ther-apy (soluble TNF\u03b1 receptor IgGFc fusion gene) present decreased symptoms and attenuated aggregation of mast cells, eosinophils, and IL-5 positive cells following nasal ovalbumin challenge [25] .

A similar use of anti-TNF\u03b1 drugs in allergic rhinitis is in our opinion not likely, in part reflecting that existing treatment options are very good and in part inherited difficulties with current anti-TNF\u03b1 approaches. However, the human nasal airway and allergic rhinitis can be used to monitor effects of TNF\u03b1 (this study) and anti-TNF\u03b1 drugs. This may be particularly valid since there are key similarities between inflammatory processes of the upper and lower airways, since observations made in upper airway conditions frequently can",
