We showed that IGF-1R mRNA was up-regulated in Huh7 and Hep3B cells and human HCC tissues, and that IGF-1R knockdown by RNAi led to decreased proliferation, apoptosis induction, and decreased migration and invasion of Huh7 and Hep3B cells. Further, the in vivo study indicated that IGF-1R knockdown markedly diminished the tumorigenesis and metastasis of Huh7 xenograft. Moreover,",

The result revealed that IGF-1R mRNA was significantly upregulated in Huh7 and Hep3B cells ( Figure 1A ) and the HCC tissues ( Figure 1B ) compared with HL-7702 cells (a human normal liver cell line), and MANT and NALT, respectively, and that the expression of IGF-1R mRNA was also higher in MANT than that in NALT ( Figure 1B ). The mean of the relative IGF-1R mRNA level was 17.38 for all the HCC tissues studied. We arbitrarily considered samples with the relative IGF-1R expression equal to or above 17.38 as high IGF-1R expressers and samples with the relative IGF-1R expression less than 17.38 were considered as low expressers. The HCC patients with high IGF-1R mRNA expression were more often associated with poor tumour differentiation (Edmondson grade III-IV) and tumour embolus of portal vein (TEPV) compared with the patients with low IGF-1R mRNA expression, whereas there were no differences between the high and low IGF-1R mRNA expression groups regarding age, sex, tumor size, and AFP level ( Table 1) . The above results suggest that IGF-1R overexpression is involved in HCC development and is closely correlated to poor tumour differentiation and TEPV in patients with HCC.",

As a negative control, protein profile in Huh7 cells expressing negative control was examined in parallel. The cytokine proteins of two-fold change between Huh7 cells with IGF-1R inhibition and negative control were statistically analyzed. We found that, of the 440 human cytokines tested, which are broadly defined as secreted cell-cell signaling proteins and involved in innate immunity, apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell growth, and differentiation, a total of 79 differentially expressed cytokine proteins exhibited a more than or equal to 2-fold change. Of these, 35 were down-regulated and 44 were up-regulated. The top 5 cytokines that were downregulated or up-regulated were shown in Figure 8A -8C. Among the above 10 deregulated cytokines, midkine, a 13-kDa small heparin-binding growth factor, has been shown to be involved in the development of multiple cancers [16, 17] . Thus, midkine was selected for the further study. We first analyzed midkine expression at both mRNA and protein level in vitro and in vivo, and the results showed that reduced midkine expression was observed in Huh7 cells with IGF-1R inhibition and in tumor tissues of nude mice inoculated intratumorally with lentivirus-IGF-1R siRNA compared with their negative controls or blank controls ( Figure 9A -9C). We then explored the role of midkine in inhibition of HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion mediated by IGF-1R knockdown. Our results revealed that ectopic overexpression of midkine by transfecting midkine expression vector pcDNA3.1(+)-midkine into Huh7 cells with IGF-1R inhibition markedly rescued inhibition of HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion ( Figure 10A-10E ). In conclusion, these data imply that inhibition of IGF-1R suppresses HCC growth and invasion via down-regulating midkine expression.",

In vitro function study showed that knockdown of IGF-1R expression led to decreased proliferation, apoptosis induction, and decreased migration and invasion capability of Huh7 and Hep3B cells. Similarly, Wang et al. demonstrated that lentivirusmediated RNAi targeting IGF-1R could led to the remarkable proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and reduction of invasion activity in osteosarcoma cells [35] . The animal experiment indicated that knockdown of IGF-1R significantly suppressed Huh7 xenograft tumorigenesis, and could reduce metastatic capability invasion, metastasis [36, 37] . As far as we know, this is the first study that demonstrates the therapeutic value of IGF-1R inhibition by lentivirus-mediated RNAi in vivo for HCC treatment. Taken together, these in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that IGF-1R may play a significant role in the development, progression, and metastasis of HCC, and that IGF-1R inhibition may possess the therapeutic value for HCC. Similar to our results, Tovar et al. showed that A12, a monoclonal antibody against IGF-1R, delayed tumor growth and improved survival in an HCC xenograft model [23] ; Lin et al. indicated that suppressing IGF-IR expression by antisense oligonucleotides resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth, relapse, and metastasis of orthotopic implantation model of human HCC in nude mice [25] . Finally, we explored the possible mechanism involved in inhibition of HCC growth and invasion induced by IGF-1R suppression. We conducted a protein array analysis to determine proteins related to IGF-1R inhibition, and found that midkine was the most remarkably down-regulated protein in Huh7 cells with IGF-1R silencing, which was further confirmed through quantitative RT-PCR and western blot (Figure 9 ). To explore the role of midkine in suppression of HCC growth and invasion by IGF-1R inhibition, we transfected midkine expression vector pcDNA3.1(+)-midkine into Huh7 cells with IGF-1R inhibition. We demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of midkine remarkably remedied inhibition of Huh7 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion caused by IGF-1R suppression, suggesting that the reduced midkine expression may contribute, at least in part, to significantly reduced HCC proliferation, migration, and invasion capability induced by IGF-1R suppression. It has been shown that midkine overexpression is observed in a variety of human cancers such as gastrointestinal cancer [17] , colorectal cancer [38] , lung cancer [39] , breast cancer [40] , pancreatic cancer [41] , and HCC [42, 43] . Concordant with our findings, Rawnaq et al. indicated that the expression of midkine promoted the proliferation and migration in pancreatic cancer cells, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of midkine was associated with decreased proliferation and migration in pancreatic cancer cells [41] .",

The cell lysates were analyzed with Quantibody \u00ae Human Cytokine Antibody Array 440 (RayBiotech Inc., Norcross, GA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the glass slides were blocked for 30 min and then incubated with 100 \u00b5l of the standard cytokines or the cell lysates (500 \u03bcg/ml of protein) at room temperature for 1-2 hour. Then, the glass slides were washed and 80 \u00b5l of the detection antibody cocktail was added to each well, incubating at room temperature for 1-2 hour. Finally, 80 \u00b5l of Cy3 equivalent dyeconjugated streptavidin was added and incubated for 1 hour. The signals (wavelength of 532 nm) were scanned using InnoScan 300 Microarray Scanner (Innopsys Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).",
