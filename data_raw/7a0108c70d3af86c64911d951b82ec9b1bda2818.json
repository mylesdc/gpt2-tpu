Their heterogeneity was investigated by analysis of the ORF3 gene because of its potential function as a representation of virulence. According to the results, six Fujian strains in Group 1 showed a different genotype with unique point mutations, which might be used in differentiation between PEDV groups and brought potential antigenic variation. P55 and five reference strains in Group 2 had a long length deletion, showing another genotype and might be involved in the variation of virulence. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the collected Fujian strains were very distant from the vaccine development strain CV777, which might be the reason why the vaccine was inefficient to control the disease. The results can help to reconsider the strategy of PEDV vaccine management and prevent outbreaks of PEDV-induced diarrhea more efficiently.",

Its genome contains six ORFs, including pplab (pol), spike (S), membrane (M), ORF3, small membrane (sM), and nucleocapsid (N) [12, 13] . The ORF3 encodes an ion channel protein and regulates virus production [14] , and its loss might result in attenuation of the virus in the natural host [11] . The differentiation of ORF3 could be a marker of adaptation to cell culture and attenuation of virus [15] , which could be a valuable tool to study the molecular epidemiology of PEDV [16] . The variation of field isolates of PEDV might change the genotypes and may be one of the possible reasons for the outbreaks in immunized pigs in Hebei, China [17] . Similar results were demonstrated in our primary study on field samples from 3 different swine farms in Fujian [18] . Thereby it is necessary to analyze the genetic heterogeneity of PEDV to find out which genotype prevails in Fujian. In this study, the ORF3 gene of PEDV field samples from different farms in Fujian province were cloned and sequenced for genetic diversity analysis.",

Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that all the samples were separated into two groups (Figure 1 ).

Six of them (F422, P1, P4, P9, P14, and P15), together with three reference strains had eight unique point mutations and formed a subgroup in Group 1.

In this study, 27 PEDV Fujian samples were identified, whose ORF3 gene sequence analysis indicated that they could be separated into two general groups. P55 with five reference strains were clustered into Group 2, which had a long length deletion in both of the nucleotide and amino acid peptide sequences. It indicated that this genotype might have prevailed in China as four strains in this group were collected from China but from different provinces (Table 1 ). In addition, the virulence of the virus was reduced in cell culture adaptation through the deletion mutant [15] , but those five strains with the region deletion were virulent field samples, which revealed that there might be other mutations related to the virulence.",

It was noteworthy that these samples were collected from four different geography regions, including South Korea (DX), Hubei in North China (AJ1102), Guangdong in South China (GD-A), and Fujian in South China (F422, P1, P4, P9, P14, and P15), respectively. Whether any recombination occurred among the field strains in these areas needs further study, but those mutations might be used in differentiation between PEDV groups or new DNA markers in the PEDV field strains. The ORF3 protein of reference strain CV777 had nine high antigenic indexes based on DNAMAN program analysis, which were located at amino acid 4-39, 41-64, 70-114, 118-124, 134-148, 158-174, 179-190, 192-207 , and 211-221 plots, respectively. The strains in Subgroup 1 had amino acid changes at 25, 80 and 107 (Figure 2 ), located at the antigenic regions 4-39 and 70-114, respectively, which might alter their antigenicities and can be used as a label to remark this subgroup. No difference was found in the other regions. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that all the strains were divided into 2 relevant groups (Group 1 and Group 2, Figure 3 ), and Group 1 was formed by three subgroups. None of the Fujian strains were observed to be close to vaccine development strain, CV777 [22] . That might explain why the vaccine was not efficient enough to prevent PED prevalence. In addition, as the samples were taken from farms that covered all the district of Fujian, the phylogenetic tree demonstrated that there might be three genotypes of PEDV prevailing in Fujian.",

The presence of another two field isolates, which shared high sequence identity with the attenuated strain DR13 from South Korean, was similar to P55 in the classification of Group 2 in this study (Figures 1 and 2) .
