            "text": "The high mutation rates of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) pose economic threats to the poultry industry. In order to track the genetic evolutionary of IBV isolates circulating in yellow chickens, we continued to conduct the genetic analyses of the structural genes S1, E, M, and N from 64 IBV isolates in southern China during 2009-2017. The results showed that the dominant genotypes based on the four genes had changed when compared with those during 1985-2008. Based on the S1 gene phylogenetic tree, LX4-type (GI-19) was the most dominant genotype, which was different from that during 1985-2008. The second most dominant genotype was LDT3-A-type, but this genotype disappeared after 2012. New-type 1 (GVI-1) isolates showed increasing tendency and there were four aa (QKEP) located in the hypervariable region (HVR) III and one aa (S) insertion in all the New-type 1 isolates. Both the analyses of amino acid entropy and molecular evolutionary rate revealed that the variations from large to small were S1, E, M, and N. Purifying selection was detected in the S1, E, M, and N gene proteins, which was different from the positive selection during 1985-2008. Six isolates were confirmed to be recombinants, possibly generated from a vaccine virus of the 4/91-type or LDT3-A-type and a circulating virus. The estimated times for the most recent common ancestors based on the S1, E, M, and N genes were the years of 1744, 1893, 1940, and 1945, respectively. Bayesian skyline analysis revealed a sharp decrease in genetic diversity of all the four structural genes after 2010 and since late 2015, the viral population rapidly rose. In conclusion, the IBVs circulating in southern China over the past decade have experienced a remarkable change in genetic diversity, dominant genotypes, and selection pressure, indicating the importance of permanent monitoring of circulating strains and the urgency for developing new vaccines to counteract the emerging LX4-type and New-type IBVs.",

The S protein is cleaved into subunits S1 and S2 by proteases [10, 11] . The function of the four structural proteins has been extensively reviewed by others [12] [13] [14] . The genetic analysis based on the S1 gene has become the primary method of classifying IBV strains because of variability and functional importance [15] . However, those previous IBV molecular characterizations that were merely focused on the analysis of the S1 gene or partial S1 gene sequence could not explain the changes in the serotypes and pathotypes of IBV variants [16] . Sometimes, single gene analysis even is misleading. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze all the structural protein-coding genes S1, E, M, and N simultaneously in order to obtain comprehensive genetic information and molecular mechanism of variation of circulating IBV isolates.",

So far, a total of seven genotypes comprising 35 distinct viral lineages have been defined worldwide based on the complete S1 gene sequences [17] . IBV strains within a certain country or region are unique even though many countries share some common antigenic types. For example, two distinct lineages that fall in two different genotypes-GI-21 and GII-1-were identified as unique to Europe. GI-9, GI-27, and GIV-1-genotypes have been implicated in widespread disease disseminations and persistent virus infections in north American [16, 18, 19] . GI-1, GI-11, and GI-16 are currently circulating in South American flocks [20] . LX4-type (QX-type or which was firstly isolated in China in 1996 spread westward invading Russia, Middle East, and Europe, and then becoming the most prevalent genotype in many countries, such as Korea, Russia, Iran, Italy, UK, Malaysia, Sudan, and so on [7, 8, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Nowadays, LX4-type and CK/CH/LSC/99I-type (GI-22) appear to be the dominant viruses based on the S1 gene in China [18] . Because of differences in breeding variabilities and feeding patterns of chickens in China, the characteristics of circulating IBVs at different times and in different regions are variable. Hence, it is necessary to conduct long-term tracking of the IBV circulating isolates in specific geographic regions or countries for the effective control of IB [4, 18, 26] .",

However, IBV evolution is not driven by genetic drift alone. Evolution involves two fundamental steps-i.e., generation of genetic diversity and selection [27] . The selection process was affected by multiple factors, such as immune responses, the microenvironment of infected hosts, physical and biosafety conditions [16, 27] . Vaccines not only give rise to new variants through recombination, but also impose selection pressure on the evolution of field strains [28] [29] [30] .

Guangxi province, located in southwest of China, has the biggest production of local breeds of chickens (0.75 billion birds in 2018) [31] , and most of the birds are free-range and raised for a longer time (about 120-day-old) at a rather high density, and the chicks are raised in relatively closed environment and lack of ventilation during brooding [32, 33] . Also, flocks of various companies, with different chicken breeds and differing ages and vaccination programs located in the same areas are common [32] . These situations surely increase the odds of multiple-infection of several IBV strains including the vaccine strains or/and field strains in flocks of birds [34] . Despite the widespread use of Mass-type (Massachusetts genotype) (H120, H52, Ma5, M41, and W93), 4/91, LTD3-A live vaccines and inactivated vaccines, IB has been a continuing problem in vaccinated flocks in these regions [35] . Our previous studies found the serotype and genotype diversity of Guangxi IBVs from 1985 to 2008 and the important role of vaccine strains in the emerging of new IBV strains via recombination [1, 2, 4] . However, the comprehensive genetic information of circulating IBV strains in this region was unavailable over the past decade. Hence, we continued to carry out the genetic analysis of 64 IBV isolates during 2009-2017. The aim was to track the genetic evolutionary trends of IBV field strains circulating over the past decade and their possible causes through relatively new and comprehensive analyses of virus genes, and then provide valuable reference and countermeasure against IBV field breakouts in southern China.",

Sequences of 43 reference IBV strains (with the exception of 42 strains for E gene) retrieved from the GenBank database were used (Supplementary Table S1 ). The 27 IBVs isolated during 1985-2008 in Guangxi [4] were also analyzed together in order to get a general profile of IBV evolution. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of the S1, E, M, and N genes obtained from the IBV isolates were aligned using the Editseq program in the Lasergene package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA) and compared to those of IBV reference strains representing the main well-established lineages and genotypes using the MegAlign program in the same package. To ensure the scientificity and reliability of the results, we extracted the S1, E, M, and N genes from the complete genome sequences of reference strains. Phylogenetic trees based on the aa sequences of S1, E, M, and N genes were constructed using MEGA version 6.06 according to previous description with nodal support values obtained by posterior probabilities and 1000 bootstrap replicates [37] .",

In the present study, 64 strains of IBV were isolated from diseased chicken flocks in southern China during 2009-2017 and the genetic properties of the entire S1, E, M, and N genes analyzed. To increase our insight into the comprehensive epidemiological situation and evolutionary trend of IBV in southern China, 27 IBV isolates from 1985 to 2008 in southern China were also used to analyze together. The 43 representative reference strains included the live vaccine strains commonly used and the prevalent strains in China and other countries worldwide, which represented the main well-established lineages and genotypes in recent years in China [17] . Our results indicated that there was a remarkable change in genetic diversity, dominant genotypes, and selection pressure of IBV strains in southern China over the past decade compared with the previous period of 1985-2007.",

In our study, multiple IBV genotypes were also identified in Guangxi over the past decade. A total of eight, six, four, and six genotypes were identified based on the S1, E, M, and N genes, respectively. Therefore, there is still ongoing genetic diversity of IBVs in southern China, which is the same as previous epidemics in this region and other parts of China [4, 15, 35] . Interestingly, the predominant genotype changed from CK/CH/LSC/99I-type LX4-type was the most dominant genotype in our study, which agreed with many previous descriptions [15, 30, 35, 41] . Surprisingly, the second most dominant genotype of IBV circulating in southern China was LDT3-A-type, which was a pandemic type and frequently isolated from chicken flocks in China [15, 42, 43] . LDT3-A commercial live vaccine has been issued by the official authority in China since 2011 [6] . The re-isolation of vaccine strain is possible when LDT3-A live vaccine strain is extensively used. We noticed that among the 14 LDT3-A type isolates during 2009-2017, four, eight and two strains were isolated in 2010, 2011, and 2012 respectively. However, only one LDT3-A type strain was isolated during 1985-2008. We are not sure whether or not the 10 strains of LDT3-A type isolated between 2011 and 2012 are re-isolation of vaccine strains, but it seems that the LDT3-A type vaccine could provide sufficient protection against the circulating homologous field strains in southern China because none of LDT3-A genotype strains were isolated after 2012. At the same time, we found the E genes of most LDT3-A type isolates belonged to the CK/CH/LSC/99I-type, and the M and N genes of most LDT3-A type isolates belonged to LX4 (QX)-type. These results implied that LDT3-A-type might isolate the recombinants from LDT3-A vaccine strain and other circulating IBV strains. Considering that the LDT3-A types were occasionally isolated in other regions of China recently [43] , the LDT3-A type isolates in southern China still need to be further monitored.",

Surprisingly, majorities of the New-type 1 strains from other studies were isolated from south China [2, 5, 15, 55] . Recently, another novel genotype VII (GVII-1) was reported [17] . Both these two New-type viruses were identified in our study and the total number of their strains showed New-type was the third most dominant genotype. We found that there was a four aa (QKEP) insertion located in the HVR III and one aa (S) insertion in all the New-type 1 isolates. Interestingly, the four aa (QKEP) were predicted B cell epitopes by the BepiPred /IEDB tool and half of the New-type viruses' serotype were different from that of 4/91 or other vaccine strains [56] . The aa mutation in the HVR of the S1 gene maybe lead to the occurrence of new serotype and immunity escape. The origin of New-type 1 viruses in China remains unknown. Interestingly, the \"novel\" isolates were shown to undergo recombination in our study. The New-type 1 isolate GX-NN120089 was a major parent to the recombinant LDT3-A-type isolate GX-NN120091. To the best of our knowledge, this first report of a recombination event needs to be further investigated. Analyzing the complete-genome and identifying the antigenicity and pathogenicity of New-type 1 isolates will be further studied. It is uncertain whether the New-type 1 would become the predominant type in China in further, but it continues circulating in the field suggests that the New-type 1 IBVs are still endemic in China and more attention should be paid to them.",

            "text": "High rates of recombination result in IBV variability. Many recombinants were confirmed. Some recombination occurred between field and vaccine viruses [5, 14, 15, 26] , some occurred between field isolates [26, 35, 43] . Six recombinants were identified in this study and three had a major parent of the LX4-type, and two with minor parents of 4/91-type genotype. Our previous studies confirmed five recombinants, which were between the vaccine strain 4/91 and the CK/CH/LSC/99I-type field strain GX-YL2 during 2006-2007 [4] . Therefore, we have identified 11 recombinants so far and 7 recombinants were derived from the 4/91-type strain during 1985-2017. High frequencies of recombination between vaccine and field strains have been reported frequently worldwide [4, 5, 15, 22, 57, 58] . The 4/91 vaccine strain has been commonly used in China for a long time, so it is not surprising that 4/91-type recombinants were found in the field. However, there were more recombinants involved in the 4/91-type vaccine strain when compared to the Mass-type vaccine strains' recombinants according to our and other previous reports [4, 14, 15, 18, 59] , although both Mass-type and 4/91-type vaccine strains were widely used in China. The phenomenon may have the following three explanations. Firstly, incomplete protection of 4/91-type vaccine strain against heterologous strains might result in co-infection of vaccine and heterologous strains in the same birds and eventually led to recombination. Secondly, the 4/91-type vaccine strain recombinants may be more likely to escape vaccine immunization than Mass-type vaccine strain recombinants. Thirdly, the 4/91-type vaccine strain persisted longer in the immunized birds than the Mass-type vaccine strain, increasing the likelihood of co-infection with the latter infected strain/strains, as a previous report showed that 4/91 vaccine could persist in birds for 40 days [60] . The complete genome, pathogenicity, and immunogenicity of 4/91-derived recombinants should be assessed in further studies. The isolation ratio of 4/91 (GI-13) genotype strains was relatively stable recently. Therefore, in order to reduce the recombination occurred between field and vaccine viruses, the multi-valent live vaccine combined with 4/91 strain or other new vaccines (such as LDT3-A strain, LX4 strain, and so on) should be used with caution and thoughtful consideration.",

The results showed that mean substitution rates were between 3.7 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 4.6 \u00d7 10 \u22123 substitutions per site per year in different genes, which is comparable with previous description [58] . Both the average entropy and mean substitution rates sorted from large to small as follows: S1, E, M, and N genes, and the dN/dS ratios of S1, E, M, and N genes were 0.283, 0.266, 0.146, and 0.147, respectively. The dN/dS ratios of S1, E, M, and N genes were less than 1, meaning that the analyzed region were under purifying selection. Therefore, our results indicated that the degree of variation sorted from large to small as follows: S1, E, M, and N genes and there was a positive correlation between selection pressure and gene variation. It is known that S1 genes had the largest variation, but the mutation of E gene has not been paid enough attention. A recent study reported that the E gene evolved at the fastest rate among four structural protein-coding genes [30] . The E gene mutation needs to be focused on in the future. To our knowledge, it is the first report to analyze systematically the variation degree of the four structural genes of IBVs and correlation between gene variation and selection pressure.",

In addition, all of the positively selected sites in S1, E, M, and N genes had high entropy values of bigger than 0.6.

However, positive selection was detected in the S1, M, and N proteins of IBV isolates in southern China during 1985-2008 according to our previous investigation [4] . Therefore, positive selection in the S1, M, and N proteins in different periods in southern China was changeable. This phenomenon was also seen in some other previous reports [61] [62] [63] . The change in selection pressures may be due to immune responses induced by multiple types of vaccines, the microenvironment of infected hosts, or physical and biosafety conditions [16] .",

According our previous investigation [1] , the first IBV strain was isolated in 1985, demonstrating that the IBV was already present at that time. This study further backdated the IBVs emergence of more than 30 years (during 1985-2017) and indicated that the most recent ancestor of Guangxi IBV isolates based on the genes S1, E, M, and N existed in the early 1744, 1893, 1940, and 1945, respectively. Different structural protein genes of the IBVs had different time of the most recent ancestor. This phenomenon was also reported in other viruses [51, 66, 67] . The data of tMRCA estimated from our study suggested IBV has been already circulating in field for a period before its first outbreak. Interestingly, the evolution rates sorted from large to small as follows: S1, E, M, and N genes; the similarity plot data showed high genetic divergence and recombination was found in the S1 gene of IBV isolates, which agreed with the dates of most recent ancestor. Although IBV was discovered in 1930s, it is thought that it may have a long history as a species. The similar results were reported in other viruses [66, 67] . In our early study, maybe unavailability of advanced diagnostic and sequencing technologies, the backyard poultry farming, inefficient surveillance systems, and limited financial resources resulted in the non-detection of IBV isolates for such a long time in Guangxi.",

Analysis of S1 showed a more obvious decrease between 1990s and 2000s. The live vaccine H120 has been used in China for many years and the 4/91-like live vaccine was also commonly used in China since 1990s even without official authorization. Therefore, the 4/91-like vaccine was effective between 1990s and 2000s. Surprisingly, a sudden and sharp decrease in genetic diversity base on the S1, E, M, and N genes was observed after 2010, mirroring the implementation with a newly registered LDT3-A-based vaccine. In our study, the LDT3-A-type disappeared after 2012. LDT3-A-like strains were also rarely isolated in other recent studies [30, 43] . It was reported that the change of viral population size had a strong association with the vaccine administration/withdrawal [68, 69] . Therefore, it can be speculated that the LDT3-A vaccine could provide a better protection against the circulating strains in China. However, since late 2015, a sharp increase was observed in viral population size, which may suggest the implementation of current vaccines could not provide higher protection against the circulating strains. The LX4-type isolates had become the predominant IBVs since 2011 in our study. The proportion of LX4-like genotype strains increased over time in China [30] . Increasing of LX4 genotype viruses over time agreed with the rapid rise in the viral population since late 2015. Our previous study showed that the H120, 4/91, or LDT3-A vaccines could not provide complete protection against the prevalent local strains of IBV (such as LX4 genotype isolates) in southern China [6] . Therefore, it is predicted that the epidemic trend of LX4 type strain will not decline in the next few years and will become more and more intense. Therefore, new LX4 type vaccine was urgently needed. LX4 live vaccine was officially authorized in China last year, but has not yet come into the market. LX4 commercial vaccine urgently needs to go to the market in China.",

            "text": "Taken together, our results of genetic analyses of the four structural protein genes S1, E, M, and N clearly demonstrated that there has been a remarkable genetic change of IBV in southern China over the past decade. The coexistence of multiple genotypes of IBV, the changes of dominant genotypes in different periods, the emergence of new genotypes, the recombination of vaccine strains with the field strains, the rapid evolving rate of IBV, the ever-changing of viral population size, and the presence of multiple positively selected sites in the structural proteins suggest a complexity of IBV epidemic strains in southern China. This epidemiological complexity may be caused by multiple factors: simultaneous vaccination of multiple live vaccines, illegal use of live vaccines, large number of avian varieties, raising of chickens at a rather high densities and the patterns of raising (free-range style and lack of biosecurity), etc. The complexity also suggests the importance of molecular epidemiological investigation and permanent monitoring of circulating strains as well as more serious challenges for IB prevention and control. Based on the present results, it is predicted that LX4-type will remain to be dominant genotype in near future and New-type IBV isolates will be more and more prevalent in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to choose and/or develop new vaccines to counteract the IBVs of these two genotypes. In addition, multivalent new vaccines should be developed and rational modified vaccination strategies and the strict biosafety should be observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing the changes of genetic diversity, dominant genotypes, and selection pressure of IBV strains. The present study extends our knowledge about past and present IBV variability in southern China, providing valuable reference and countermeasures against IBV field breakouts in China, also emphasizing the importance of constant dynamic surveillance of the circulating isolates.",
