Indeed, great effort seems to be required to avoid tangling a heap of cords. Figure S5a shows a common pseudoknot known as an H-type pseudoknot. This is also known as an ABAB pseudoknot. The structure is notated below with the standard parenthesis notation for the basic secondary structure (here shown in blue) and square brackets for the pseudoknot linkage (here shown in red).

There is no reason why such a structure cannot form. Indeed, knots are known to form in some rare proteins [2, 3] . However, it is not a pseudoknot and the current approach is not designed to estimate its existence or the likelihood of its formation. One important feature of a pseudoknot is, therefore, that the linkage stem (here shown in red) must be shorter than 10 contiguous bps. Figure S5e shows two stem-hairpins-loops (blue and purple) that are joined by a linkage stem (red). The stems are all short as in Fig. S5a . This is a pseudoknot, sometimes referred to as a kissing loop. It is also known as an ABACBC pseudoknot. It is also observed in a number of places, although less frequently than H-type pseudoknots. The corresponding bracket notation for this structure is shown below (Fig. S5f) . Belvedere knot secondary structure Supplement Figure S6 . A special type of knot (right hand side) that becomes entangled due to the way the structure folds up. The two dimensional nature of the RNA schematics tends to hide curious possibilities as this. The knot is seen in equilibrium between the unknotted structure (left hand side) and the \"Belvedere knot\" (right hand side).",

An example of a multibranch loop is shown inFig. S4.The stem, H-loop, I-loop and M-loop are the four fundamental motifs that make up secondary structure. The fundamental feature of RNA secondary structure is that base indices i and j ( ) are allowed to base pair with each other if they satisfy the following properties with all other base pairs ( ' and , with )",

The most common deviations from these base pairing rules is a class of structures called pseudoknots (PKs). A pseudoknot permits violation of the above three pairing relationship rules.",

            "text": "S5g shows a structure intermediate between Figs. S5a and c. This structure is also an H-type pseudoknot. Here we see a necessary condition for defining a segment as a linkage stem and the most important distinction between a knot and a pseudoknot: a linkage stem cannot contain more than 9 contiguous bps. When an internal loop breaks the continuity, this rule may not necessarily apply. Therefore, longer overall structure could form, but only if the stem is not contiguous. Moreover, this would have to be considered on a case by case basis.As a final curiosity, inFig. S6, a secondary structure (left hand side) and its corresponding knot (right hand side) are shown in equilibrium. The knot renders a peculiar 2D illusion perhaps reminiscent of artist M.C. Escher's \"Belvedere\" (1958). The knotted structure could conceivably exist in chemical equilibrium with a standard secondary structure, though electrostatic effects may render it less favorable thermodynamically. It could result from a simple misfolding.",
