Specially, establishing whether invasive species operate within the constraint of conservative ecological niches, or if niche shifts occur at all commonly as part of the invasion process, is indispensable to identifying and anticipating potential areas of invasion. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) has been used to address such questions, but improvements and debate in study design, model evaluation, and methods are still needed to mature this field. We reanalyze data for Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), native to North America, but invasive in Europe. Our main finding was that, when the analysis extent is established carefully based on analogous sets of environmental conditions, all evidence of niche shifts disappears, suggesting that previous reports of niche shifts for this species are artifacts of methods and interpretation, rather than biological reality. Niche conservatism should be tested only within appropriate, similar, environmental spaces that are accessible to both species or populations being compared, thus avoiding model extrapolation related to model transfers. Testing for environmental similarity between native and invaded areas is critical to identifying niche shifts during species invasion robustly, but also in applications of ENM to understanding temporal dimensions of niche dynamics.",

An emerging hypothesis that may solve this debate is that niche conservatism dominates over short-to-moderate time spans and at lower taxonomic ranks (genus and species), but less over longer time spans and at higher taxonomic ranks 3 . Many studies have sought to test this hypothesis quantitatively, such as via longitudinal tests examining distributional shifts from the Pleistocene to present (e.g., refs 4-6) , cross-sectional tests comparing sister taxon pairs 7 , and comparisons of invasive species between native and invaded areas 8 . Ecological niche models (ENMs) have been the principal tool used to estimate niche dimensions and potential distributions of species, but have often been used uncarefully [9] [10] [11] . In recent evaluations, indices of niche similarity have been used in tandem with randomization tests and species-specific hypotheses of accessible areas to assess whether niches have been conserved or not 12 .",

This interpretation confounds the idea of fundamental niche (an evolved feature of the phenotype) with aspects of availability of conditions across real-world landscapes. On the other hand, ecological and evolutionary theory suggests that niche conservatism ought to be more common than niche shifts 25 . Hence, apparent niche shifts over short periods of time (e.g., during species invasions) should be analyzed carefully to assure that they are not consequences of analytical artifacts or incorrect assumptions or interpretations 3, 23, 26 . We note that this debate is not just a technical detail: if niches indeed shift easily during species' invasions, predicting the geographic potential of invasive species will be much more difficult.",

That is, more formally, the existing fundamental niche N F * is the intersection of the true fundamental niche N F with \u03b7(M), such that N F * will always be a subset of N F , and any attempt to extrapolate N F * into an estimate of N F is perilous 28 . Based on this reasoning, changes in M will generate changes in the observable niche, even when the fundamental niche remains unchanged 27 . However, the question is whether the fundamental niches of two species or populations are equivalent (i.e., whether N F1 = N F2 ), if only N F * \u2286 N F is observable, any part of N F not represented within N F * is in some sense extrapolative, and generally unreliable for inference 28 . Hence, a revised question is whether the two niches are equivalent given the set of environments available or accessible to each, or whether N F1 \u2502\u03b7(M 1 ) = N F2 \u2502\u03b7(M 2 ). Any tests for niche similarity or difference lacking the conditional will run the risk of interpreting differences in environmental representation across accessible areas as niche difference 3 -we reiterate that a hypothetical change in the fundamental niche has important implications for the environmental and geographic potential of the species, whereas change in the existing niche is expected with any and every change in geographic (and environmental) setting.",

Should we call the simple expansion of the realized niche across a broader and more environmentally diverse M area (i.e., during species invasion) a niche shift? We believe not, as the fundamental niche remains unchanged, and the distributional potential of the species similarly. Rather, in light of recent demonstrations of dramatic, biologically unrealistic extrapolation that occurs in transferring niche models from M to broader areas 28 , we propose that quantification and testing of niche shifts should be done only within the set of environments overlapping between the populations in native and invaded areas (Fig. 1 ). Genuine niche shifts occur when the two species or populations use different environments within these doubly accessible sets of conditions. When environments in the accessible areas of the two populations do not overlap, a null hypothesis of niche similarity cannot be rejected, and differences in realized niches must be considered as explainable as simple distributional expansion within the constraints of the same niche (Fig. 1) .",

Differentiating between these two scenarios is crucial to understanding the invasion process and in turn to designing effective strategies for invasive species control. A genuine shift in the fundamental niche would reflect evolutionary adaptation of a species to novel environmental conditions, whereas occupying new portions of the same fundamental niche does not change the environmental or geographic potential of the species. We used a species and approaches from a recent article reporting niche shifts in Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), a mammal native to North America that is invasive in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe 20 . The original article tested whether Gray Squirrels introduced into Europe maintained the same niche as in its native range, and developed a global model using data from the native and invaded ranges to identify areas of potential expansion by this species. The authors reported niche shifts in the areas of introduction. Our reanalysis may provide a key consideration for further assessments of niche conservatism and niche shift of invasive species.",

We came to opposite conclusions as regards to niche shifts during this invasion: analysis of environmental data across the entire native area generates \"noise\" in comparisons with the relatively narrow set of environments manifested in the invaded areas 34 . As a result, Di Febbraro et al. 20 concluded that niche shifts had occurred between native versus invasive populations, but their result appears to be an artifact of the different environments manifested in the two areas more generally. In fact, no genuinely novel environments were involved at all in the invasion: the misinterpretation was perhaps caused by comparison of a very rich environmental universe from a broad geographic extent (the native area) against a much more restricted climatic range in the invaded areas (see Fig. 4 in Di Febbraro et al. 20 ). We found that, when models from both populations were compared across broad and diverse environmental backgrounds (i.e., the two distributional areas), the D index was consistent; however, when evaluations were restricted to analogous environments only, the same metric yielded mixed signals. This result illustrates how sensitive these metrics are to differences in environmental representativeness of available occurrences and distributional areas. Di Febbraro et al. 20 supported the niche shift conclusion based on identity tests and visualization of different positions of the clustered occurrences in the environmental space (see Fig. 4 in their manuscript). However, the first approach is highly subject to Type I error 3 , and the second lacks statistical support and is influenced by sampling bias and M hypotheses (see Supplementary Material S1). Our study aimed to replicate the experiments of Di Febbraro et al. 20 ; however, when assessing the potential of species to invade a region, the entire species' range including native and invasive populations should be considered in model calibration 24 . For example, Gray Squirrels are reported to be invasive in regions of Canada, Ireland, Italy, Pitcairn, South Africa, and the United Kingdom 36 , so more informed forecasts could be obtained considering all the established populations. Additionally, we caution on the use of Broennimann et al. 29 method to assess niche similarity in environmental space as it may be impacted by the sampling bias and the background available for comparisons.",

Hence, in this contribution, we have explored means of testing niche similarity or difference without need for model transfers, which too-frequently extend to extrapolative situations. While the background similarity test is a two-way test of niche similarity 14 , test of niche similarity for invasive species should be more relevant in one direction: to assess if the invasive population has a niche more similar to the native niche than expected by chance. We note that our approach is presently implemented in three dimensions only, whereas niche differentiation can be manifested in any of the dimensions that make up the full dimensionality of the environmental space; we also note that our use of principal components analysis to simplify environmental space could be replaced by any number of alternative approaches that may be more appropriate under certain circumstances 44, 45 .",

If environmental spaces in the two accessible areas are non-overlapping, tests of niche similarity will be (and should be) inconclusive, because the two species are observable only against distinct environmental backgrounds. Without this precaution, tests are, in effect, interpretations of patterns of model extrapolation, which is known to be unpredictable and not realistic in terms of physiological responses of organisms 28 . Restricting areas of analysis as we recommend certainly involves lower statistical power owing to reduced sample sizes, but should be far less prone to spurious conclusions of niche shift. Indeed, evaluation of non-analogous environmental conditions should be crucial not only in invasion ecology but also in studies of climate change impacts on the distribution of species; ecological niche modeling applications to assessing distributional responses of species to warming climates, lacking evaluation of novel climates, should be considered with caution. This balance between appropriateness of conclusion and statistical power constitutes an important next step in development of mature methodologies for these tests.",

We removed duplicates and included 1754 occurrences falling within the native geographic range 46 Considering that our aim was to compare two modeling approaches, as environmental information we used the same data layers as in the original article 20 : WorldClim climate data at 2.5\u2032 resolution 47 , including mean temperature of the wettest quarter, mean temperature of the coldest quarter, precipitation of the wettest quarter, and precipitation of the coldest quarter. These data were checked for nonlinear relationships and converted to principal components 27 , and environments on each continent were extracted to establish overlap with respect to the first three components (Supplementary material S1), which jointly explained 97% of the variance in the data. Components 1, 2, and 3 were displayed and analyzed using NicheA version 3.0, an open-access software platform that allows design, exploration, and analysis of geographic and environmental spaces simultaneously 48 . We also identified areas with non-analogous environmental conditions using three methods. First, we used NicheA to identify environmental combinations shared between the two continents. NicheA generates two convex-polyhedrons each around the range of climatic conditions in the native and invaded range respectively, and then determines the similar environments in the form of conditions overlapping between both polyhedrons; overlapping environments were projected from environmental space to geographic space to determine the study area and subsets of occurrences to be used to establish presence or absence of niche shifts. Secondly, we used the Mobility-Oriented Parity (MOP) metric that measures environmental similarity between native and invaded areas 28 . MOP estimates Euclidean distances between the native and invaded ranges in multivariate environmental spaces; MOP then identifies and excludes the values outside of the environmental range of the calibration region. The similarity values of MOP are comparable to the distances estimated by the multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS), but the latter measures distances to the centroid, rather than the near edge, of the reference environmental background 49 . Finally, we employed ExDet to identify similar or novel environments between native and invaded area 50 . ExDet measures Mahalanobis distances between environmental conditions in the native and invaded areas and identifies areas presenting conditions outside the univariate range of values in the other area (i.e., novelty Type 1). ExDet also identifies the most influential environmental variables leading to non-analogous environments between the areas compared 50 .",
