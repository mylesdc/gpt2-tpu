Inducing a patient's own immune system to have an anti-tumor response is an attractive approach to cancer therapy. In this safety study, autologous tumor vaccines produced specifically for each canine patient were combined with Advax\u2122, a novel non-inflammatory immunomodulator and vaccine adjuvant and were tested for safety in a diverse range of patient presentations alone or in combination with other treatments. Canine patients had their tumor biopsied, debulked or resected and the tumor antigens were processed into an autologous vaccine formulated with Advax\u2122 adjuvant with or without rhizavidin as an additional immune stimulant. Patients treated early in the trial received two intramuscular (IM) doses, 2 weeks apart. As the study progressed and no issues of safety were observed, the protocol was changed to weekly vaccinations for 4 weeks followed by monthly booster shots. Over the 150 I.M injections delivered to date, the vaccine was found to be very safe and no significant adverse reactions were observed. These results justify ongoing development and future controlled studies of this autologous vaccine approach.",

            "text": "Canine malignancy rates are similar to those of humans, however, canine cancer patients can have limited therapeutic options due to financial access or safety barriers. Cancer immunotherapy is a rapidly growing area of human oncology [1] , which may also have benefits for canine cancer patients. Furthermore, recent One Health initiatives have highlighted the use of pet dogs with spontaneous cancer as translational models for the development of human cancer therapies [2] [3] [4] . While rodent models provide a rapid and relatively inexpensive approach to studying cancer progression and new therapies, they have significant limitations [2, 4] . Rodent oncology models are typically induced with the potential to create significant divergence in the immune profile of the tumor microenvironment from the spontaneous cancers seen in dogs and humans. Further, human and canine cancers are polygenic, but rodent models are usually driven by select causal genetic mutations [2] . Using canine patients for testing of potential immunotherapies has other key advantages such as accessibility, shared environmental exposure of humans, phenotypic diversity, similar patient size and closer genetic similarity to humans [5] . Spontaneous canine cancers reflect the phenotypic and genetic diversity of the approximately 400 breeds, thereby having similarities to an outbred human population [6] . The strong breed association of certain cancers makes diagnosis and prediction of the clinical course of canine cancer easier in these cases, with extensive published data on expected survival times relative to the grading and staging of various cancers [7] Like humans, dogs tend to develop cancer from middle age, with the majority of dogs presenting at >6 years of age, equivalent of 60-95 human years, which is when most malignancies present in humans [8] . Further, greater than 50% of dogs over 10 years of age will develop cancer [2] . Therefore, with large populations in developed countries, pet dogs represent a substantial translational resource for cancer therapy development [2] . Differences lie in canine patients generally presenting with more advanced disease than human cancers, and minimal current access to antibody-based immunotherapies due to species differences. Depending on the owner's wishes and budget, treatment options include palliation, surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination. Overall, canine patients tend not to be treated as aggressively or consistently as humans, and euthanasia of patients is used extensively in veterinary medicine, leading to shorter survival times. As canine cancer progression tends to be more rapid than in people, this can lead to significantly shorter duration of canine cancer trials. This combined with the strong parallels between humans and dog cancers is a major advantage as it allows for new cancer therapies to be assessed rapidly in dogs and then translated to the clinic for the benefit of both humans and dogs. Stimulating a patient's own immune system to target and attack the neoplastic cells has become a new weapon in the fight against cancer, as with humans, canine cancers contain a unique set of mutated tumor proteins enabling a patient's own cancer-derived proteins to be used to produce a vaccine [9] . The advantage of an autologous vaccine is that MHC molecules as well as tumor-associated antigens are patient specific [10] . However, depending on the cancer type, tumor-specific antigens may have a low level of immunogenicity, or the tumor may have a low percentage of unique mutated proteins [11] . Bacterial products can be used to increase the level of immunogenicity to tumor antigens, for example, immune stimulants such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) have been used with irradiated autologous tumor cells in bladder cancer and other tumor types [12, 13] .",

            "text": "Several autologous cancer vaccines that showed promise in early phase studies have failed to deliver survival benefits for patients with advanced disease, showing benefits only for early stage disease [14, 15] . With the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) which overcome tumor immune suppression in certain cancer types [16] , the concept of combining CPI with autologous tumor vaccines to improve efficacy is now being explored using a variety of vaccine preparations [17, 18] . One downside to the use of bacterial immune stimulants such as BCG or Freund's adjuvant in cancer therapy is their inflammation-associated side effects, with inflammation in turn upregulating immune checkpoint receptors such as PD-1 on T cells, resulting in immune suppression [19] . Hence, we hypothesized that the use of a non-inflammatory adjuvant may provide an enhanced safety profile but also avoid induction of regulatory T cells that suppress anti-tumor responses. Advax\u2122 is a unique non-inflammatory adjuvant produced from delta isoform of inulin, a natural plant polysaccharide. Delta inulin adjuvants have been shown to induce balanced immune responses encompassing both humoral and cellular immunity [20] . This has been shown to translate to enhanced vaccine protection against a broad range of pathogens including Japanese encephalitis virus [21, 22] , West Nile virus [23] , hepatitis B virus [24] , influenza [25] , HIV [26] , SARS [27] , coronavirus [27] , Listeria monocytogenes [28] and Bacillus anthracis [29] , as well as non-infectious diseases such as Alzheimer's disease [30] . Advax\u2122 induces minimal inflammation even when compared to alum adjuvant formulations [31] and has been shown to be safe and effective in human trials of vaccines against influenza [32] hepatitis B [31] and allergy [33] . Therefore, we sought to conduct a Phase 1 safety trial in canine cancer patients of our autologous cancer vaccine containing Advax\u2122 adjuvant with or without an additional bacterial protein immune stimulant rhizavidin [34] to generate safety and proof of concept data for this novel oncology approach. We hypothesized based on our own previous cancer vaccine development work [35] , that using streptavidin as an immune stimulant with the addition of a similar foreign bacterial protein such as rhizavidin may improve the immune response to vaccination.",

A minimum of 0.1 g sample was required and each sample was processed into the vaccine which produces four doses via the following method. For each 0.1 g of tumor, 1 mL of tumor buffer (50 mM Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01% SDS pH 7.2) was added. The Tumor sample was then homogenized (Ultraturrax) to obtain a uniform suspension with no fragments of tumour remaining and then spun at 15,000 rpm for 5 min and the soluble lysate was collected. Soluble lysate contained between 5 to 30 mg of material per mL depending on the tumour type and origin. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM and 10 mg Advax\u2122 was added per dose. Each final vaccine dose contained 0.2 mL Advax\u2122 at 50 mg/mL with 0.2 mL of tumour lysate with or without 25 \u00b5g of rhizavidin and 0.01 mg/mL Thiomersal as a preservative. Prepared vaccine was stored at 4 \u00b0C until use. Murine studies later demonstrated no additional efficacy from the addition of the immune stimulant rhizavidin. To test if this was also the case for spontaneous canine tumors, approximately 50% of dogs received rhizavidin in their vaccine to compare safety and preliminary clinical outcomes. The rhizavidin used in this study was donated by Dr George Anderson (Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC, USA) and had an endotoxin level of less than 0.1 EU/mg.",

Biopsied, resected or debulked tumor samples obtained from each individual patient were processed fresh or stored frozen at \u221220 \u2022 C until processed at laboratories at the University of Queensland or the University of Sydney. A minimum of 0.1 g sample was required and each sample was processed into the vaccine which produces four doses via the following method. For each 0.1 g of tumor, 1 mL of tumor buffer (50 mM Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01% SDS pH 7.2) was added. The Tumor sample was then homogenized (Ultraturrax) to obtain a uniform suspension with no fragments of tumour remaining and then spun at 15,000 rpm for 5 min and the soluble lysate was collected. Soluble lysate contained between 5 to 30 mg of material per mL depending on the tumour type and origin. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM and 10 mg Advax\u2122 was added per dose. Each final vaccine dose contained 0.2 mL Advax\u2122 at 50 mg/mL with 0.2 mL of tumour lysate with or without 25 \u00b5g of rhizavidin and 0.01 mg/mL Thiomersal as a preservative. Prepared vaccine was stored at 4 \u2022 C until use. Murine studies later demonstrated no additional efficacy from the addition of the immune stimulant rhizavidin. To test if this was also the case for spontaneous canine tumors, approximately 50% of dogs received rhizavidin in their vaccine to compare safety and preliminary clinical outcomes. The rhizavidin used in this study was donated by Dr George Anderson (Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC, USA) and had an endotoxin level of less than 0.1 EU/mg.",

Vaccinated dogs with residual or metastatic disease often survived longer than published predicted survival times, suggesting the vaccine had a positive clinical benefit, but more patients are needed to allow for assessment of statistical significance. Vaccination also appeared anecdotally to stop or at least slow the reoccurrence of tumors after resection, especially in patients with mast cell tumors. At the time of writing, one dog with non-epitheliotrophic T-cell lymphoma was in complete remission, with the disappearance of all lesions recorded pre-vaccination. This dog received no other treatments in conjunction to the autologous vaccine, and at the census date had no visible lesions. Although the efficacy data provided is preliminary, the autologous vaccine produced positive clinical benefits including remissions, static disease and amelioration of cancer-associated symptoms, with some animals exceeding the predicted survival times for their tumor and stage.",

Likewise, many owners are very concerned about cytotoxic urine and faeces near or around their home associated with chemotherapy, and dog owners with young families often cite this as a reason for declining chemotherapy.

The results indicate complete resection or debulking of tumor likely improves outcome as less residual disease will be present and this gives more time for vaccinations to stimulate the immune system. Further, with complete resection, surgical cure may have been achieved by the surgery alone. While biopsied subjects had a reduced response rate, this is most likely due to higher residual disease burden; although some longer term survivors (n = 3) with stable disease indicate biopsy samples and vaccination as an approach still demonstrated a positive clinical benefit.",

Interestingly, 4/5 subjects with B cell lymphomas that survived less than 3 months were all treated with a vaccine containing rhizavidin, whereas the other case with the stable disease at 9 months received only tumor lysate and Advax\u2122.
