            "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis is an acute and highly contagious disease in pigs, mainly affecting piglets within 3 weeks of age, causing vomiting and wasting disease, as well as obvious neurological symptoms. The disease has not yet effective prevention and treatment measures currently. (Chen et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2011; Li Z. et al., 2016) . The mortality rate ranges from 20 to 100% (Lan et al., 2012 (Lan et al., , 2013 . This disease is caused by a member of the Coronaviridae family, which be known as porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) (Dong et al., 2014) ; it is an enveloped virus containing a non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kb. Pigs are the natural host of PHEV, but have been adapted to replicate in mouse and mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells (Chen et al., 2011) . PHEV is a highly neurovirulent virus that spreads to the central nervous system via peripheral nerves (Dong et al., 2015) , but the mechanism of induction of nerve injury is unclear. It is of great scientific interest to study the pathogenesis of PHEV from the point of view of virus infection and host protein interaction for the development of new antiviral drugs and treatment programs. microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding ssRNAs that are 19-25 nt in length and post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of multiple genes by combining with the 3 -untranslated region (UTR) of their target messenger RNAs and thus become crucial regulators in complex gene regulatory networks (He and Hannon, 2004; Varnholt, 2008; Chi et al., 2009; Mallick et al., 2009) . Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs play a important role in the infection of coronavirus and the neurovirulent virus (Hasan et al., 2014; Lai et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2015; Piedade and Azevedo-Pereira, 2016) . For example, during SARS coronavirus infection process, miR-17 * , mir-574-5p, and miR-214, were up-regulated, and miR-98 and miR-223 were down regulated. Among these miRNAs, miR-17 * , mir-574-5p inhibited the replication of SARS coronavirus, whereas miR-214 contribute to immune escape of the bronchial alveolar stem cells (BASC) (Mallick et al., 2009) . miR-15b modulates the inflammatory response during JEV infection by negatively regulating RNF125 expression (Zhu et al., 2015) . Our previous research revealed that miR-21a-5p, which is highly homologous with miR-21, was significantly increased in the process of PHEV infection by a DNA microarray analysis (Data are not published).",

The regulatory role of miR-21 in process of viral infection was confirmed by a number of studies and can be used as a target for the treatment of viral diseases. For example, in the murine coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis model, the expression of miR-21 was significantly reduced. The recovery of miR-21 expression significantly relieved CVB3-induced myocarditis as shown by an increased body weight, a reduced myocardial injury, a lowered myocarditis score and an increased survival rate. Further study showed that miR-21 protects against myocardial apoptosis by specifically inhibiting the expression of its target programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4). These data proved miR-21 might be a novel target for the treatment of CVB3 infection and other apoptosis-mediated cardiovascular diseases (He et al., 2013) .",

The concentration of RNA was detected by spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by using the reverse transcription kit (Takara, Japan). The quantification of miRNAs was performed using the Bulge-Loop TM miRNA qRT-PCR Primer Set (RiboBio, China). miR-21a-5p and Caskin1 expressions were determined by RT-PCR using SYBR Green Master Mix kit as described previously (Shen et al., 2016) . The relative expression was analyzed using the 2 \u2212 CT method. U6 and GAPDH were used for normalization of miR-21a-5p and Caskin1 expression, respectively (Shen et al., 2016) .

We detected miR-21a-5p expression in the brain tissue of the different groups of mice. In the miR-21a-5p antagomir group, the miR-21a-5p expression levels were significantly down-regulated 24 h after injection compared with the control (Figure 4A) . The result indicated that the miR-21a-5p antagomir efficiently entered into the mouse brain tissue, resulting in the deletion of miR-21a-5p in the mouse brain tissue. On day 5 post-infection, the control group, the PBS group, and the NC group mice exhibited typical symptoms of PHE that included generalized muscle tremors and hyperesthesia. However, the antagomir group did not have these typical symptoms. At 7 dpi, the antagomir group appeared to have FIGURE 4 | miR-21a-5p antagomir treatment reduces symptoms in PHEV-infected mice.

Unfortunately, all of the mice in those groups eventually died. In contrast, the antagomir group of mice survived more than 2 days. In addition, compared with other groups, the antagomir group of mice did not have an obvious weight loss (Figure 4B) . At 5 dpi, the mice were sacrificed, and the brain samples were collected and processed for subsequent experiments. The results were similar to those in vitro, it has a negative relationship between the expression patterns of miR-21a-5p and its target Caskin1 in the brain tissues from the PHEV-infected mice, and the higher expression of miR-21a-5p was associated with a low-level of Caskin1 (Figures 4C-E) . In the PHEV-infected mice, the treatment with the miR-21a-5p antagomir caused a significant reduction in the miR-21a-5p expression and rescued the alterations in the Caskin1 levels (Figures 4C-E) .",

The host cell's endogenous miRNA inhibits the replication of the virus, and there could also be a virus that facilitates viral replication or regulates cellular immune function and so on (Sarkies et al., 2013) . For example, the host cell miR-145 negatively regulates replication of the oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 by targeting AP27i145 (Li et al., 2013) , and in influenza virus infection, multiple proteases play a key role in the host cell miRNA regulation of these proteases, which permits convenient influenza virus replication (O'Connor et al., 2014) . In addition, miR-29b in the JEV-infected mouse microglial cell line was upregulated during JEV-induced microglial activation, and miR-29b plays a role of the pro-inflammatory response. The mechanisms of its action is mediated by inhibiting the anti-inflammatory protein, TNFAIP3, resulting in the continuous activation of NF-\u03baB and followed by pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (Li et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Multiple miRNAs modulate the virus infection process, but the roles of the miRNAs in the PHEV infection process are not fully understood. Neurotropic viruses such as JEV, human immunodeficiency virus 1, herpes simplex virus 1, and vesicular stomatitis virus could cause host cell miRNA expression changes during infection. The expression of miRNAs, which normally regulates viral replication, was upregulated by 1.5-4-fold (Ashraf et al., 2016) . The previous research from our lab demonstrated that the change in the miR-21a-5p expression was obvious in the PHEV infection process, suggesting that miR-21a-5p might play a very important role in the process of virus infection. PHEV mainly causes obvious nerve injury, whereas miR-21 also plays an important role in nerve injury. For example, in traumatic brain injury, the expression of miR-21 was up-regulated 1.5fold in the brain cortex and hippocampus and might affect the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury (Redell et al., 2011) . In this study, we found that miR-21a-5p expression in N2a cells was up-regulated after PHEV infection and increased up to 2.5-fold at 60 h. The expression of miR-21a-5p was also up-regulated in PHEV-infected mice and increased to 3.35-fold at 5 days. This indicates that the expression level of miR-21a-5p is significantly increased during PHEV-infected host, suggesting that miR-21a-5p may play a role in PHEV-induced neurotoxicity. In addition, the up-regulation of miR-21a-5p expression promotes viral proliferation, and the knock-down of the expression of miR-21a-5p reduces viral proliferation, suggesting that miR-21a-5p affects PHEV proliferation. Unlike other cells, nerve cells are very sensitive to injury, especially to some neurotropic virus infections, such as PHEV. Small changes in the amount of the viruses in the host neurons may cause significant changes in the course of disease. In spite of siRNA inhibition of Caskin1 showed a very modest inhibition of PHEV replication (twofold) in neuronal cell cultures and even less of an effect in mice, its impact on viral nerve injury may be very large. Therefore, we speculated that miR-21a-5p might play an important role in PHEV pathogenesis. Whether there are other targets of miR-21a-5p affect viral replication is unclear during PHEV infection. miRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of multiple genes by binding to the 3 -UTR of their target messenger RNAs to play biological functions (Chi et al., 2009) . To determine the mechanism of miR-21a-5p affecting virus proliferation, we predicted its target genes. There were many target genes of miR-21, such as PTEN, PDCD4, RECK, TPM1, TIMP-3, Maspin, and Sprouty (Spry-2, Spry-1) (Buscaglia and Li, 2011) . These target genes were involved in the process of cell proliferation and apoptosis and so on. In this study, we choose Caskin1 as the target gene to be detected. Caskin1 is a brain-specific multi-domain scaffold protein that binds Lar and Dock through its different structural domains. In addition, Caskin1 plays a key role in motor axon targeting through interaction with the Lar-dependent signaling pathway (Weng et al., 2011) . In the CNS, Caskin1 and dock have overlapping roles in axon outgrowth. Overall, these studies indicate Caskin1 is required for neuronal axon growth and guidance in the CNS. Together, these studies identify Caskin1 as a neuronal adaptor protein required for axon growth and guidance (Weng et al., 2011) . Time dynamics research to the expression of miR-21a-5p and its target gene Caskin1 showed that an inverse relationship with respect to each other's expression until the 24 h time point. The up-regulation of miR21a-5p after PHEV infection showed a sustained changes at 24, 48, and 60 h; however, Caskin1 mRNA and protein levels decreased 60 h post-infection compared to the 24 and 48 h time points. It is possible that miR-21a-5p reduces the expression of its target mRNA and protein (Caskin1). These results were consistent with the above in vivo experiment. However, further studies are required to resolve this issue of the differential kinetics of miR-21a-5p and its target. In this study, we used a luciferase reporter assay to evaluate the interaction of miR-21a-5p with the 3 -UTR of Caskin1. It was evident from the luciferase reporter assay that miR-21a-5p binds to this region of Caskin1 and suppresses its expression. The knock-down of the expression of Caskin1 in the N2a cells promotes virus proliferation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that miR-21a-5p positively regulates PHEV replication by targeting Caskin1.",
