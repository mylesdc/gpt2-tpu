            "text": "Background: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection is a highly contagious infectious disease causing watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality rate in newborn piglets. PEDV infection can cause high economic losses in pig industry. In Japan, a PEDV outbreak occurred with high mortality from 2013 to 2015. Even though until now, PEDV infection occurs sporadically. For the control and monitoring of PEDV infection, not only symptomatic pigs, but also asymptomatic pigs should be identified. The objective of this study is to develop and optimize novel indirect ELISA as a simple, rapid, sensitive and specific method for the detection of anti-PEDV antibodies and evaluate the efficacy of the assay as a diagnostic method for PED. Results: One hundred sixty-two serum samples, consisting of 81 neutralization test (NT) positive and 81 NT negative sera, were applied to the assay. Indirect ELISA test based on whole virus antigen (NK94P6 strain) derived from Vero cell culture was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with neutralization test (NT) as a reference method, and cut-off value was determined as 0.320 with sensitivity and specificity of 92.6 and 90.1%, respectively. The area under curve (AUC) was 0.949, indicating excellent accuracy of indirect ELISA test. There was significant positive correlation between indirect ELISA and neutralization test (R = 0.815, P < 0.05). Furthermore, the kappa statics showed the excellent agreement between these two tests (kappa value = 0.815). In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of preserved plates with different periods (1 day, 2 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months) after drying antigen coated plates were 100% and 80-100%, respectively. Conclusions: The developed indirect ELISA test in our study would be useful as a reliable test for serological survey and disease control of PEDV infection, and our pre-antigen coated ELISA plates can be preserved at 4\u00b0C until at least 6 months.",

However, this test is laborious and, time-consuming, requiring manual result reading, interpretation of virus induced cytopathic effect endpoints and reduction of NT titer due to virus mutation [12, 13] , while ELISA test is simple, easy, rapid and accurate and can screen large number of serum samples [9, 11] .

On the other hand, whole virus coated ELISA can produce high background, cross-reactivity with other viral antibodies and low specificity [11, 18] . However, the purified whole virus antigen involves all virally expressed proteins that increases sensitivity [24] . Moreover, whole viral antigen coated indirect ELISA is more sensitive than the PEDV structural protein based ELISA in the detection of heterogeneous strain [25] . Based on these advantages, whole viral antigen was used as an ELISA antigen in this study in order to improve the detection sensitivity for field serum samples.

Moreover, no cross-reactivity with antibodies against TGEV, PRRSV and PCV2 indicated that the developed PEDV indirect ELISA is effective and specific serological method for PEDV specific antibodies detection. However, only one PRRSV seropositive sample cross-reacted with ELISA antigen (PEDV) but the OD value was near to the cut off value. This would be due to non-specific binding of antibodies in this ELISA. Non-specific binding of antibodies in indirect ELISA is a common problem because specific or non-specific antibodies bound in the well [23, 26] .",

The virus titer was 1 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 /ml and 2.8 \u00d7 10 7 copies of PEDV per 1 \u03bcl volume, determined by real time RT-PCR [28] . The protein concentration was 4.48 mg/ml, which was measured by Nano drop (Thermo Scientific, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA).",

All analyses were performed by computer programming language R (version 3.4.3; R development core team, Vienna, Australia) [29] . The interpretation of Kappa value was determined by ranges from 1 (complete agreement) to 0 (agreement is equal to that expected by chance).

Evaluation for working antigen concentration of PEDV. For optimization of working PEDV antigen concentration, 3 NT positive sera (1: 128, 1:64, 1:8 of NT titer) and 3 NT negative sera (1:< 2 of NT titer) were tested at 1:100, 1:200, 1:400 and 1:800 dilutions of PEDV antigen coated ELISA plate. The serum samples were diluted at 1:1000 in this experiment. The highest OD value in NT positive sera and the lowest OD value in NT negative sera were observed for 1:100 dilution of PEDV antigen. Therefore, the working PEDV antigen concentration for the indirect ELISA was set as 1:100 dilution in this study.Additional file 2: Figure S2 . Evaluation for working serum samples dilution. Three NT positive (1: 128, 1:64, 1:8 of NT titer) and 3 NT negative sera (1:< 2 of NT titer) were diluted to 1:62.5, 1: 125, 1: 250, 1:500, 1:1000 and, 1:2000 and tested using 1:100 diluted PEDV antigen coated plates. All NT negative sera diluted more than 1:1000 gave OD value less than 0.3, and NT positive sample with NT titer (1: 8) showed OD value higher Authors' contributions OM carried out the experiments, data analysis, and wrote the manuscript draft. RY designed the study, revised the manuscript and supervised the study. AY designed the experimental procedures, performed data analysis and revised the manuscript. SS not only provided the serum samples but also performed NT. TH contributed to PRRS seropositive serum samples collection, the study design and revised the manuscript.
