In phase 2, intervention will be implemented and evaluated using a randomized controlled trial, including: (a) behavior initiation only, (b) behavior initiation + behavior maintenance, and (c) control group. Both the initiation and maintenance components will comprise weekly-delivered telephone-based individual intervention sessions in 3 months. In phase 3, outcome evaluation of behavioral and psychological variables and process evaluation will be conducted. The effectiveness of the intervention will be analyzed using a series of linear mixed models on each behavioral and psychological outcome variable. Structural equation modelling will be used to test the hypothesized theoretical sequence in the HAPA model. Discussion: The proposed project is expected to design theory-based intervention materials to promote the influenza prevention behaviors in Hong Kong elderly people and provide information on its effectiveness and the potential changing mechanism of behavior initiation and maintenance.",

            "text": "Seasonal influenza can cause mild to severe illness, or even death. Each year, approximately 1 million deaths worldwide are estimated to be related to influenza [1] . According to the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention [2] , certain groups of people, such as children under five, elderly people aged over 65, pregnant women, and people with certain chronic medical conditions, are at high risk of seasonal flu-related complications. It has been reported that Hong Kong elderly people (age above 65) are 14 times more likely than midlife adults (age between 40 and 65) to die from influenza [1] . Based on an assessment of weekly hospitalization counts in Hong Kong during 1996 to 2000, influenza was revealed to be significantly associated with hospitalization for acute respiratory disease, with large and noticeable rates of excess hospitalization for elderly people aged above 65 [3] . In peak influenza season, these individuals are more vulnerable to influenza. As such, elderly people are an 'at risk' population, given the fact that the population is, in general, aging and is going to increase massively in the future. This leads to the prevention of illness in this population a priority for governments, otherwise it's going to cost health services a massive amount. To prevent infection with seasonal flu, people are advised to maintain some key prevention behaviors, such as wearing facemasks in enclosed public spaces, hand washing, using antibacterial sanitizers, or to consider having an influenza vaccination [4] .",

            "text": "According to the concept of bounded rationality [5] , individuals in influenza pandemic make decisions on health care and medication using heuristics, or rules based on past experiences and information instead of using rational decisions. Therefore, it is necessary to provide individuals a theory and evidence-based intervention to guide them form rational decisions when facing an influenza pandemic. Research adopting social psychological theories in influenza prevention has generally focused on influenza vaccination behaviors examining perceived severity, perceived barriers, perceived susceptibility, and perceived benefits, as well as social norms, intentions, worries and regrets towards vaccinations [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . There are several theoretical models to explain the decisions and behaviors on influenza vaccination. For example, the health belief model [12] examines individuals' perceptions and attitudes towards illnesses or health compromising behaviors in terms of three facets: individual perceptions (i.e., perceived susceptibility and perceived severity), modifying factors (i.e., perceived threat, environmental factors, and cues to action), and likelihood of action (i.e., perceived benefits and perceived barriers). Previous studies have provided initial support for the predictive value of these facets on individuals' acceptance of influenza vaccination [6, 10] . Yet, the risk perception alone cannot fully explain preventive behaviors without considering the influence of outcome expectations and social norms, namely, social pressure of a normative status. The theory of planned behavior [13] , on the other hand, explains the influences of individuals' attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control on the intentions and behaviors of influenza prevention. Intention is viewed as the most proximal determinant of individuals' volitional behaviors. Research has preliminarily demonstrated significant associations between these beliefs and intentions to receive the influenza vaccine, which in turn predicted vaccination behaviors [9] ; while non-intention to vaccination is significantly related to disbelief in the efficacy of, and negative attitudes toward vaccination as well as lack of perceived threat [7] .",

In addition, everyday preventive actions, such as washing hands, avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth, and facemask wearing also play a very important role in prevention. Moreover, the relationship between vaccination and other influenza preventive behaviors (e.g., personal hygiene practices) is still unknown. Regarding as one of the main factors contributing to the transmission of influenza within the community, low behavioral compliance to these recommended health actions are frequently reported [14] and this might be explained as acceptance of vaccination accidently warrant people a false information/belief of free of being infected, which further causing them to lower their behavioral compliance. Nonetheless, researchers have begun to investigate the psychological factors associated with the lack of behavioral compliance toward influenza prevention [6, 15] . For example, consistent with the health belief model, the reason people fail to, or refrain from, wearing facemasks might be due to a lack of perceived susceptibility, cues to action, and perceived benefits, rather than lack of perceived severity and perceived barriers [15] .",

Although the motivational paths to intentions have been well-established with large effect sizes, the prediction from intention to health behaviors always fail, a phenomenon called \"the intention-behavior gap\" [16] . Based on the model of action phases [17] and social-cognitive theory [18] , the health action process approach (HAPA) [16] was developed by integrating these two theoretical approaches. The HAPA stipulates a two-phase approach to action, a motivational phase and an implemental or 'planning' phase. Motivation is considered a necessary but not sufficient condition for action initiation and persistence; people also need to identify effective plans to enact their intentions or motives. Interventions should, therefore, target both motivational and implemental phases [19] . In other words, it suggests a distinction between (a) pre-intentional motivational processes that lead to a behavioral intention, and (b) post-intentional process that lead to actual health-related behavior. The HAPA is, therefore, an appropriate approach to explain the processes that lead to motivated behavior and its enactment in health contexts, including the influenza vaccination behaviors [20] . It has also been demonstrated applicable in the local context of Hong Kong for other health-related behaviors such as the condom use for men who have sex with men [21] .",

In order to promote the initiation and maintenance of influenza prevention behaviors, it will comprise intervention components targeting both motivation and planning. In the behavior initiation stage, three key psychological variables have been associated with increased motivation toward influenza prevention: risk perception, action self-efficacy, and outcome expectancy. The intervention components that have been shown to target and effect change in each of these variables are information provision (risk perception, action self-efficacy, and positive outcome expectancy), goal setting (action self-efficacy), and mental simulations (positive outcome expectancy). In the behavior maintenance stage, different strategies will be used which include the maintenance/relapse prevention self-efficacy, coping planning, and maintaining the satisfaction and enjoyment of the behavior change. The components targeting increased planning are action plans or implementation intentions [19] . Comparing to the behavior initiation stage which focuses on approaching a more favorable health stage, the maintenance stage help participants avoid reverting to a less favorable non-intending status [22] .",

According to the HAPA theory, motivation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for action initiation and persistence; people also need to identify effective plans to enact their intentions or motives. The protocol will therefore include intervention components that promote motivation (action self-efficacy, risk perception, and outcome expectancy) and planning (action and coping planning, maintenance and recovery self-efficacy). Aims of the first phase are: (i) develop the content of the HAPA-based intervention to promote the influenza prevention behaviors of Hong Kong older adults building on our previous projects on influenza and influenza prevention; (ii) design an intervention training manual so that the intervention can be administered consistently across groups and replicated by others; (iii) develop the intervention delivery protocol consistent with the design of randomized controlled trial; (iv) develop measures of key outcome variables to be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention; and (v) confirm participation of elderly centers (i.e., government-established elderly care facilities) to be involved in the intervention and secure ethical clearance for the study. Prior to the start of the project upon funded, the study protocol has been registered in CCRB Clinical Trials Registry of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, a Partner Registry of a WHO Primary Registry (Ref: CUHK_CCRB00567).

Although vaccination is the most effective way of preventing influenza and much existing research focuses on the influence of psychosocial variables for vaccination rather than daily protective measures, effective daily preventive measures are also important [4] .
