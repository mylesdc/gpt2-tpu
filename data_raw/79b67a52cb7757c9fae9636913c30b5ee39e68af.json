In infected cells, the genome is translated into non-structural polyprotein P1234, an inactive precursor of the viral replicase, which is activated by cleavages carried out by the non-structural protease, nsP2. We have characterized CHIKV nsP2 using both cell-free and cell-based assays. First, we show that Cys478 residue in the active site of CHIKV nsP2 is indispensable for P1234 processing. Second, the substrate requirements of CHIKV nsP2 are quite similar to those of nsP2 of related Semliki Forest virus (SFV). Third, substitution of Ser482 residue, recently reported to contribute to the protease activity of nsP2, with Ala has almost no negative effect on the protease activity of CHIKV nsP2. Fourth, Cys478 to Ala as well as Trp479 to Ala mutations in nsP2 completely abolished RNA replication in CHIKV and SFV trans-replication systems. In contrast, trans-replicases with Ser482 to Ala mutation were similar to wild type counterparts. Fifth, Cys478 to Ala as well as Trp479 to Ala mutations in nsP2 abolished the rescue of infectious virus from CHIKV RNA transcripts while Ser482 to Ala mutation had no effect. Thus, CHIKV nsP2 is a cysteine protease.",

The catalytic dyad of Sindbis virus (SINV) nsP2 is represented by Cys481 and His558 residues 8,17,18 ; these correspond to Cys478 and His548 in CHIKV and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) nsP2. Mutation of these residues results in the complete loss of protease activity 19 and abolishes the infectivity of SINV genomes 18 . Different cleavage sites in P1234 are recognized in different ways. Specifically, SFV nsP2 cannot cleave short substrates representing the cleavage site between nsP2 and nsP3 (2/3 site).

Subsequent molecular modelling revealed the features of the catalytic site and the S1\u2032 -S4 subsites 22 . A peptidomimetic inhibitor of nsP2 protease binds at the interface of the protease and MTL domains resulting in conformational change that most probably assists in leaving group departure of either the amine or Cys thiolate during the catalytic cycle 23 ; the binding mode of natural substrates is most likely similar. In addition to the catalytic Cys, Asn475 and Lys480 residues (correspond to residues 476 and 481 of CHIKV nsP2) have been shown to be important for the protease activity of VEEV nsP2 23 .

On one hand, studies performed using the purified protease part of nsP2 31 or full length nsP2 with a native N-terminus 16 have demonstrated that CHIKV nsP2 is functionally similar to SFV nsP2. On the other hand, Saisawang and co-authors observed that CHIKV nsP2, derived from East/Central/South African (ECSA) isolate from Thailand, differs from other alphavirus nsP2 proteases in the recognition of small peptide substrates 32 . Recently the same team also reported that the catalytic dyad Cys478 of CHIKV nsP2 could be interchangeable with a proximal Ser482 residue that also contributes to the protease activity of nsP2 33 . Thus, CHIKV nsP2 was reported to have properties very different from those revealed for the ns proteases of other alphaviruses. Indeed, functions of the same ns protein originating from different alphaviruses can be substantially different 34, 35 . However, in this case the data was obtained using only a single short peptide substrate based assay and the conclusion was not directly confirmed by comparing the enzymes from different alphaviruses in the same experiment. Furthermore, this finding has not been verified using cell-based experiments.",

Consistent with the requirement of nsP3 macro-domain for 2/3 site cleavage, the longer substrate GFP-10:170 was efficiently cleaved (Fig. 1a) . Another critical determinant for 2/3 site cleavage, revealed in studies of SFV nsP2, is a requirement for the intact native N-terminus of nsP2 12 . It was found that the removal of just two amino acid residues from the N-terminus of CHIKV nsP2 almost completely abolished the processing of GFP-10:170.

It has been demonstrated that residues P6 to P1 have a clear impact on the cleavage in the context of protein-based substrates and, most importantly, in the context of infectious virus 11, 15 . Accordingly, peptide substrates used previously have been sub-optimal, as they contained only three or four P-side residues [31] [32] [33] . Based on the above considerations, peptide substrates representing the P6-P2\u2032 regions of 1/2 and 3/4 sites were designed. However, due to problems in peptide synthesis, we could not obtain a peptide representing the 1/2 site with required (> 90%) purity. Therefore only the substrate with the sequence LDRAGG\u2193 YI (designated as Short), representing the 3/4 site, was used in subsequent experiments. This substrate was processed by CHIKV nsP2, but the reaction velocity could not be saturated (Fig. 1b) . This indicated that the Short substrate was still sub-optimal. Previously, we observed that SFV nsP2 cleaves a substrate having 10 amino acid residues from the P-side more efficiently than substrates having only 6 P-side residues (our unpublished data). Therefore a longer substrate, spanning positions P10 to P5\u2032 (DELRLDRAGG\u2193 YIFSS; designated as Long), was used 36 . This substrate was processed more efficiently than Short (compare Fig. 1b,c) . Importantly, the reaction velocity reached a plateau (Fig. 1d) indicating that Long peptide represents a preferred tool for functional studies.",

            "text": "The protease domain of SFV nsP2 is capable of hydrolysing a 400-fold molar excess of a protein-based substrate in 5 min indicating a cleavage rate of \u2265 1.3 s \u22121 or \u2265 78 min \u22121 10 . This is largely comparable with data observed for many virus-encoded proteases 37 . In contrast, Saisawang and colleagues determined a k cat for CHIKV nsP2 as 0.0016 s \u22121 or 0.096 min \u22121 33 . Using a previously described assay 10 it was found that in 3 min CHIKV nsP2 was able to process approximately 1.8-fold molar excess of a substrate corresponding to the 1/2 site and approximately 14.5-fold molar excess of a substrate representing the 3/4 site (Fig. 1e) . Thus, similar to SFV nsP2, the CHIKV enzyme prefers the 3/4 substrate for cleavage in trans. However, in CHIKV the difference in cleavage efficiencies for these two substrates was considerably smaller than previously observed for SFV 10 , probably because both 1/2 and 3/4 sites of CHIKV have preferred P4 Arg residues 15 . The cleavage rate for 3/4 substrate was \u2248 0.08 s \u22121 or 4.8 min \u22121 . This activity is very similar to that observed for VEEV protease domain using similar substrates 23 and approximately 50-fold higher than reported by Saisawang and colleagues using peptide substrates 33 . Reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min and reaction products were resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE. Substrates contained either short (10:5) peptides originating from 1/2, 2/3 and 3/4 sites (left side of the panel) or a longer (10:170) region representing 2/3 site and macro domain of nsP3 (right side of the panel). Enzymes used to perform cleavage are shown above the panel. (b) Processing of Short peptide substrate. The concentration of nsP2 was kept constant (78 nM) while concentration of the substrate ranged from 1 to 50 \u03bc M (shown above graphs); in the control reaction 15 \u03bc M of substrate was incubated without the enzyme. The fluorescence resulting from cleavage is shown as the function of time. (c) Processing of Long peptide substrate. The experiment was performed as in panel b. (d) Enzyme kinetic constant K m was derived by plotting the initial reaction velocity on vertical axis against increasing Long peptide substrate concentration (0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 50 \u03bc M) on horizontal axis. Inset: representative plot of EDANS fluorescence generated by treating increasing concentrations of Long peptide substrate with proteinase K (50 \u03bc g per reaction). (e) Processing kinetics of wt nsP2 revealed using recombinant protein based substrates. Wt nsP2 was mixed with substrates corresponding to 1/2 (left panel) and 3/4 (right panel) sites using molar ratio 1:100. Reactions were carried out at 30 \u00b0C; aliquots were collected at 0 (before adding enzyme), 1, 3, 6, 15, 30, 60 and 90 min, and analysed using 10% SDS-PAGE. ImageJ program (NIH, USA) was used to quantify substrate band intensities. The values were further analysed using MS Excel software and expressed as pmol of processed substrate per pmol of nsP2 as indicated at the bottom of the figure. All experiments were repeated at least twice; data from one of reproducible experiment is shown. Finally, we performed estimation of K m and k cat using Long substrate and CHIKV nsP2 with a native N-terminus. By carrying out a protease assay with increasing concentration of Long substrate, the apparent K m was found to be 2.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bc M (Fig. 1d) . In order to estimate k cat for this reaction an approach used for SARS coronavirus 3C protease 38 taking into account secondary quenching of EDANS (5-[(2\u2032 -aminoethyl)-amino] naphthalenesulfonic acid) fluorescence, was used. The treatment of Long peptide substrate with 20, 30 or 50 \u03bcg of proteinase K reproducibly generated comparable intensity of fluorescence indicating that the substrate was cleaved close to 100% and that proteinase K itself doesn't affect the fluorescence (Fig. 1d) . Using this calibration, the k cat of CHIKV nsP2 for cleavage of Long substrate was found to be \u2248 2.5 min \u22121 , similar to that observed using recombinant protein substrates. Taken together this data also indicates that unlike sub-optimal peptides, a properly designed one (such as Long) does represent a suitable substrate for CHIKV nsP2 protease.",

We mutated the proposed catalytic Cys478 residue of CHIKV nsP2 to Ala (C478A), the Ser482 residue, reported to be able to substitute for Cys478 residue 33 to Ala (S482A), and combined these mutations (C478A + S482A). We also mutated the Trp479 residue, adjacent to catalytic Cys478, to Ala (W479A). To obtain purified mutant nsP2 proteins, we first took advantage of the ability of CHIKV nsP2 to tolerate N-terminal tags. Using this approach recombinant wild type (wt) His-nsP2, His-nsP2 C478A , His-nsP2 S482A and His-nsP2 C478A+S482A were all obtained at high purity (Fig. 2a) . The identities of all of recombinant proteins were confirmed using mass-spectrometry. The purification of His-nsP2 W479A turned out to be difficult; the protein contained a substantial amount of a faster migrating contaminating protein (Fig. 2a) . No major E. coli derived protein was revealed by mass-spectrometry in His-nsP2 W479A indicating that the faster migrating protein represents truncated form(s) of His-nsP2 W479A . Next, the CD-spectra of all purified recombinant proteins were obtained and compared to each other. This analysis revealed that all these proteins were folded similarly with no detectable structural deformity from nsP2 or His-nsP2 (Fig. 2b,c) . However, His-nsP2 W479A exhibited a CD spectrum with abnormally high ellipticity (Fig. 2c ). Together with altered size-exclusion chromatography profiles (not shown) this indicates that His-nsP2 W479A most probably forms high molecular weight aggregates.",

Unlike positive-strand RNA, synthesis of negative-strand RNA cannot be revealed using reporter proteins 41 . Therefore the activity of CHIKV replicases harbouring nsP2 mutations was also analysed using Northern blotting. SFV replicase, harbouring the same set of mutations, was used for comparison. For unknown reasons, CHIKV replicase was rather inefficient in using template RNA derived from T7-Rluc-Tom vector (Fig. 6a) ; in contrast SFV replicase efficiently utilized template RNA derived from Tmed 42 . Nevertheless, it was clearly and consistently detected that in addition to wt replicases, only replicases harbouring S482A substitution were capable of negative-strand RNA synthesis (Fig. 6b) . In fact, the synthesis of negative strands was slightly but reproducibly increased by this mutation, most likely due to slight reduction of protease activity of nsP2 (Fig. 3e) leading to increased half-life of early replicase complex.",

Together with data obtained for negative-stand RNA synthesis, this confirms that only these replicases are active. This data complements our previous findings and clearly indicates that replicases harbouring C478A, W479A or C478A + S482A substitutions are incapable of both negative-and positive-strand RNA synthesis. Importantly, the activities of SFV replicase were affected by all protease active site mutations in the same way as those of CHIKV replicase (Fig. 6b,c) . This is consistent with our data highlighting that the properties of CHIKV nsP2 protease are very similar to those previously revealed for SFV nsP2 10,12,14,15 . C478A and W479A but not S482A substitutions block the rescue of infectious CHIKV. We verified the effects of the protease mutations also in the context of CHIKV RNAs obtained by transcription of infectious cDNA clones (Fig. 7a) . Infectious centre assay (ICA) performed after RNA transfection revealed that the rescue efficiencies of wt CHIKV and CHIKV S482A were similar (Fig. 7a) . No plaques were detected for cells transfected with the three other mutants. Next, cells were transfected with 10 \u03bc g RNA transcripts (corresponding to \u2248 10 6 plaque forming units (PFU) for wt CHIKV). Cells transfected with wt CHIKV and CHIKV S482A transcripts displayed strong cytotoxic effects by 18 h p.t. In contrast, no cytotoxicity was observed for the other transcripts even at 144 h p.t. To study the presence of replicating virus genomes in the cells, all the transfected cultures were analysed for the presence of capsid protein (expression of which is completely dependent on viral RNA replication). High amounts of mature capsid protein (as well as some amounts of its precursors) were detected in cells transfected with transcripts of pSP6-CHIKV and pSP6-CHIKV S482A . In contrast, no capsid protein could be detected in cells transfected with pSP6-CHIKV C478A , pSP6-CHIKV W479A or pSP6-CHIKV C478A+S482A transcripts (Fig. 7b) . Furthermore, while wt CHIKV and CHIKV S482A reached comparable high titers (7.5 \u00d7 10 8 and 6.5 \u00d7 10 8 PFU/mL, respectively) and formed plaques of similar size (not shown) no infectious virus was detected in the other three samples. Taken together, this data unequivocally demonstrates that mutations C478A and W479A not only abolish ns polyprotein processing but are also lethal for CHIKV.",

At the same time the protease activity of CHIKV nsP2 was considerably lower than that previously reported for the protease domain of SFV nsP2 10 . Most likely this reflects differences in the basic enzymatic activities of the proteases from different alphaviruses. CHIKV nsP2 harbours a Glu residue in position 515 that is predicted to be part of the S4 subsite of the enzyme 22 . In contrast, the SFV protease has Val515 that was shown to increase the ability of nsP2 to process P34 polyprotein in infected cells 43 . Thus, it is possible that in order to compensate for the presence of preferred P4 Arg residue in the 1/2 site of P1234 polyprotein, CHIKV nsP2 must have lower basal protease activity; the same has previously been observed for the avirulent A7(74) strain of SFV 43 .",

We found no evidence that the enzyme harbouring C478A mutation is capable of cleaving any versions of substrates corresponding to 1/2 and 3/4 sites. Furthermore, this mutation blocked all the essential biological activities of the corresponding replicases and virus. Expectedly, no detectable cleavage of short 2/3 substrate by any recombinant enzyme was observed. However, with the exception of His-nsP2 W479A that likely forms enzymatically inactive aggregates, all the used enzymes were capable of inducing the cleavage of 2/3 long substrate. Again, Cys478 but not Ser482 residue was crucial for full efficiency of that cleavage reaction; however, when Cys478 was substituted with Ala, low level processing was still observed. The mechanism responsible for this process remains enigmatic though it certainly was not due to the proposed compensatory effect of Ser482 residue (Fig. 3a) . Biophysical or perhaps even structural experiments are required to clarify mechanism(s) responsible for this cleavage. Interestingly, it has been previously observed that processing of 2/3 long substrate is also insensitive to the effect of Pro718 to Gly mutation in nsP2 that severely reduces processing of other substrates 16 . This indicates that due to its unique macromolecular assembly dependent mode of cleavage, the processing of 2/3 site is greatly enhanced by, but not totally dependent on, the Cys478 residue. It should, however, be emphasized that the unusual processing of 2/3 site was not detected upon more natural conditions, such as processing of P1234 in the test tube or in cells and that Cys478 to Ala mutation was irreparably lethal. Thus, it is possible that this residual cleavage activity may represent an artefact of cell-free assays.",

Interestingly, the significance of residues 475 and 480 of nsP2 of VEEV (corresponding to Asn476 and Lys481 in CHIKV nsP2) for protease activity has been recently demonstrated. The substitution of Asn residue with Ala led to 25-fold reduction in k cat /K m of the enzyme. Mutation of Lys residue to Ala led to a 9-fold decrease in k cat and k cat /K m 23 . Thus, together with the data presented in this study, the importance of most residues in the active site motif of alphavirus nsP2 protease has been demonstrated. Two conserved residues (Cys478 and Trp479) are critically important for protease activity; residues N476 and K481 modulate the activity of the enzyme while substitution of Ser482 to Ala, a residue naturally occurring in the analogous position of VEEV and many other alphaviruses, has little to no effect.

Contrary to the recent report, the Ser482 residue from the active site motif of CHIKV nsP2 cannot to any extent compensate for the loss of the catalytic Cys478 residue. The conserved nature of CHIKV nsP2 with its counterparts from different alphaviruses indicates that similar approaches can be used to study these enzymes and their roles in virus infection as well as develop and select for inhibitors of different alphavirus proteases.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectrum measurements for recombinant wt nsP2, nsP2 S482A , His-nsP2, His-nsP2 C478A , His-nsP2 W479A , His-nsP2 S482A and His-nsP2 C478A+S482A were carried out as previously described 16 . Briefly, CD spectra were recorded on a Chirascan plus CD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) three consecutive times in the far-UV region from 185 to 260 nm at a protein concentration of 0.8 \u03bc M (with the exception of His-nsP2 W479A which was at 0.5 \u03bc M) in CD buffer (10 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.2 and 100 mM NaF). The final spectra were obtained after deducting the mean spectra of buffer from the mean spectra of protein samples. nsP2 protease assays. A protease assay using recombinant proteins as substrates was performed as previously described 16 . Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 60 min, followed by the addition of 2xSDS loading buffer. Samples were boiled and resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE. To analyse processing kinetics, wt nsP2 was mixed with recombinant proteins containing cleavage sequences (10:5) from 1/2 and 3/4 sites using molar ratio 1:100. The reaction was carried out in 150 \u03bc L volume using previously described 16 conditions; 15 \u03bc L aliquots were collected at 0 (before adding enzyme), 1, 3, 6, 15, 30, 60 and 90 min and analysed using 10% SDS-PAGE.",
