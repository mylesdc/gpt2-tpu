            "text": "Efficient antiviral immunity requires interference with virus replication at multiple layers targeting diverse steps in the viral life cycle. We describe here a novel flavivirus inhibition mechanism that results in interferon-mediated obstruction of tick-borne encephalitis virus particle assembly and involves release of malfunctioning membrane-associated capsid (C) particles. This mechanism is controlled by the activity of the interferon-induced protein viperin, a broad-spectrum antiviral interferon-stimulated gene. Through analysis of the viperin-interactome, we identified the Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) as the cellular protein targeted by viperin. Viperin-induced antiviral activity, as well as C-particle release, was stimulated by GBF1 inhibition and knockdown and reduced by elevated levels of GBF1. Our results suggest that viperin targets flavivirus virulence by inducing the secretion of unproductive noninfectious virus particles via a GBF1-dependent mechanism. This as-yet-undescribed antiviral mechanism allows potential therapeutic intervention.",

            "text": "IMPORTANCE The interferon response can target viral infection on almost every level; however, very little is known about the interference of flavivirus assembly. We show here that interferon, through the action of viperin, can disturb the assembly of tick-borne encephalitis virus. The viperin protein is highly induced after viral infection and exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity. However, the mechanism of action is still elusive and appears to vary between the different viruses, indicating that cellular targets utilized by several viruses might be involved. In this study, we show that viperin induces capsid particle release by interacting and inhibiting the function of the cellular protein Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1). GBF1 is a key protein in the cellular secretory pathway and is essential in the life cycle of many viruses, also targeted by viperin, implicating GBF1 as a novel putative drug target. KEYWORDS COPI, COPII, GBF1, assembly, capsid, flavivirus, interferon, tick-borne encephalitis virus, viperin T he type I interferon (IFN) system is the first line of antiviral defense and an important part of the intrinsic innate immune response that controls virus dissemination and protects against serious disease. Binding of IFN to the IFN receptor activates a signaling cascade that leads to the transcriptional activation of hundreds of IFNstimulated genes (ISGs), which encode proteins with diverse biological function where some are potent antiviral proteins and part of the response against mammalian viruses (1) . The antiviral function of ISGs is only partially understood. However, it is well accepted that ISGs target different steps in the virus life cycle ranging from cell entry, virus protein translation, genome replication, and exit of virus particles (reviewed in reference 2).",

            "text": "The genus Flavivirus, within the family of Flaviviridae, comprises important human pathogens transmitted by mosquitos and ticks, such as yellow fever virus, dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus, Zika virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). These are small (\u03f350-nm), spherical, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses. It is well known that the type I IFN response is crucial for restricting different flaviviruses, and several ISGs have been identified to restrict flavivirus growth. However, very little is known about how specific ISGs target the assembly and release of virions. Prior to the assembly of virions, a single polyprotein is translated from the viral RNA genome. The polyprotein is cleaved into seven nonstructural proteins and three structural proteins. Although the nonstructural proteins promote genomic replication and assembly, the three structural proteins-capsid (C), prM/M (membrane and its precursor), and envelope (E)-form the viral particles (3) . The C proteins of all flaviviruses are highly basic, which gives them the ability to bind the viral genomic RNA to form a nucleocapsid, which buds into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), acquiring a host-derived lipid bilayer coated by the membrane-bound glycoproteins prM and E (4) (5) (6) . From the ER, the virion is transported along the secretory pathway toward the Golgi compartment, where the maturation of carbohydrate groups on prM and E, as well as the cleavage of prM to M, occurs (7) . Finally, the mature virion is released by exocytosis (reviewed in reference 3).",

            "text": "Two major ISGs, tetherin and viperin (virus inhibitory protein, ER associated, IFN inducible), have been shown to affect assembly and release of viruses (reviewed in reference 2). Tetherin is encoded by the ISG BST2 and is localized within lipid rafts on the cell surface, in the trans-Golgi compartment, and/or within recycling endosomes (8, 9) . It inhibits release of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral particles by anchoring the virion to the plasma membrane (10), leading to internalization and degradation (11, 12) . Viperin, encoded by the ISG RSAD2, is highly induced in an IFN-dependent or -independent manner (as reviewed previously [13] ). Viperin is located to the cytoplasmic side of the ER (14) and has a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against many different enveloped viruses, e.g., DENV, West Nile virus, TBEV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV-1, influenza A virus, Sindbis virus, Chikungunya virus, and human cytomegalovirus (13, (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . Viperin interferes with HIV-1 and influenza A virus budding from the plasma membrane. It binds and inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS), an enzyme involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis, leading to altered fluidity of lipid rafts, thereby interfering with virus budding (21, 22) . Viperin also inhibits genome replication of DENV and HCV by interacting with viral nonstructural proteins (15, 16, 23) . The antiviral mechanism(s) of action are poorly understood for most viruses and seem to be dependent on the virus. However, viral or cellular proteins important in the viral life cycle are often sequestered by viperin (21, 23, 25) .",

However, very little is known about the effect of IFN on particle assembly and egress of flaviviruses. To study viral particle release, we established an expression system that allows the generation of virus-like particles (VLPs) composed of the structural proteins C, prM, and E ( Fig. 1A) (26) . This system enabled us to study the secretion of VLPs into the supernatant of transfected A549 cells (Fig. 1B) . To test the influence of IFN-\u2423, we compared intracellular and extracellular abundance of flavivirus protein and particles in presence or absence of recombinant IFN-\u2423B/D (Fig. 1B) . The effect of IFN treatment on particle assembly was measured by quantifying the ratio between secreted E and C proteins (VLP) and E and C proteins in the cell lysate (Lysate). Surprisingly, compared to control treatment, IFN-\u2423B/D treatment led to a strong increase in C protein release, while the secretion of E protein remained unaltered (Fig. 1B ). Flavivirus C protein has not previously been described to be secreted separately from the other structural proteins. To test this, only TBEV C protein was expressed in A549 cells and found to be sufficient for protein release (Fig. 1C) . Again, treatment of transfected cells with IFN-\u2423B/D led to an increase of C protein secreted to the supernatant (Fig. 1C) . Collectively, this suggested that type I IFN affect the viral structural proteins differently, indicating that C and E proteins are secreted by different mechanisms.",

To characterize the nature of the secreted C protein, a flotation assay was performed. C protein floated up and behaved ( Fig. 2A , first row) in the same manner as Langat virus (LGTV; a low-virulence member of the TBEV serogroup, which has been used extensively as a nonpathogenic models for TBEV) and VLPs containing prM and E ( Fig. 2A ). This showed that the C protein released from cells was membrane associated. After the addition of detergent, the C protein was mainly found in the pellet ( Fig. 2A , second row, fraction 6), confirming the membrane association. Analysis of the enriched C-particle fraction using electron microscopy revealed particles with a round morphology similar to LGTV and VLPs containing C, prM, and E (Fig. 2B) .",

However, to gain further information on the exact localization of TBEV C protein, we performed confocal analysis of cells transfected with plasmid encoding C-FLAG. The C protein was found in the nucleus and colocalized with E and the ER marker calnexin (ER) but not with GM130 (Golgi matrix protein) and was only in some cells associated with lipid droplets ( Fig. 3A and B). To specifically block COPII-mediated transport from the ER toward the ERGIC (ER-Golgi intermediate compartment) and Golgi compartment, a dominant-active mutant of the small GTPase Sar1 (Sar1-H79G) was overexpressed, together with prME or C, and progeny particles were monitored. The Sar1 mutant binds to the ER and initiate the COPII coat protein recruitment but is not able to detach from the ER, thereby blocking ER-to-Golgicompartment transport (29) . The overexpression of Sar1-H79G blocked both prMEparticle and C-particle release ( Fig. 3C and D) , suggesting that COPII-mediated antero-FIG 2 C protein is released as membrane-associated particles. (A) A flotation assay was used to determine the membrane association of C protein, prME VLPs, or LGTV. Supernatant from HeLa cells, which were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing C-FLAG or prM and E, and VeroB4 cells infected with LGTV were concentrated by ultracentrifugation, followed by a flotation assay.

The colocalization between GBF1 and the N-terminal 1 to 50 amino acids of viperin in such structures was even more pronounced (Fig. 7B) , confirming the coimmunoprecipitation results and suggesting a critical role of the viperin N terminus in these assays. The steady-state distribution of GBF1, together with the Golgi marker GM130, was not altered in the presence of viperin (Fig. 7C) . To clarify whether the function of GBF1 is involved in C-particle secretion, we used a specific GBF1 inhibitor, Golgicide. Cells transfected with plasmids expressing C-FLAG and/or viperin were treated with Golgicide, and the effect on C protein release was evaluated by immunoblotting as described before. Notably, the inhibition of GBF1 by Golgicide strongly induced secretion of C particles, especially in the presence of viperin (Fig. 7D) . Importantly, no effect of Golgicide was detected on prME secretion (Fig. 7E) , confirming a selective function of GBF1 in flavivirus protein release. To test the functional relationship between viperin and GBF1, the production of C particles was analyzed during modulated cellular levels of GBF1 and in the presence of viperin (Fig.  7F) . Viperin-induced increase of C-particle release could be inhibited by overexpression of YFP-GBF1, and transient knockdown of GBF1 with CRISPR Cas9 induced the C-particle release (Fig. 7F) , confirming a functional interaction between viperin and GBF1 and, in addition, the importance of GBF1 in the assembly of TBEV.",

GBF1 has previously been shown to play a central role in the life cycle of many RNA viruses, which utilize vesicular trafficking for targeting of viral proteins, and cellular membranes in their replication cycle and assembly process (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) .

            "text": "Particle assembly of flavivirus virions occurs by nucleocapsid budding into the ER acquiring the E and prM envelope near the replication complex (6, 40, 41) . Secretion of both C particles and prME VLPs were found to be dependent on the conventional COPII secretory pathway, whereas only prME VLPs appeared be released via the Golgi compartment through conventional secretion, in a way similar to that described for other flaviviruses (7) . C particles, however, are released from the cell via a different mechanism, which is induced by BFA, Golgicide treatment, and viperin expression. Both viperin and GBF1 are able to peripherally attach to membranes of the ER, and viperin seems to affect protein secretion when membrane associated. Viperin has been shown to target the ER membrane via its N-terminal amphipathic helical domain (14, 19) . This domain has also been found to induce crystalloid ER and thereby rearranging the smooth ER membranes into a lattice-like pattern (14) . We demonstrate here that the enhanced secretion of C protein by viperin was dependent on its N terminus and binding to GBF1. Interestingly, the N-terminal domain of viperin seems to be very important for viperin function since the numbers of cellular proteins interacting with the mutant lacking the amphipathic helix were very low (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). This indicates that the intracellular localization of viperin to the ER membrane or the N-terminal itself is important for protein-protein interaction. This domain in viperin is also important for the inhibition of Chikungunya virus (18) , TBEV (19) , and HCV (16) and directly mediates the binding to GBF1. GBF1 normally regulates membrane dynamics in the secretory pathway, and most RNA viruses rely on cellular vesicular trafficking for proper intracellular localization of viral proteins. GBF1 is important in the life cycles of several different viruses: GBF1 is necessary for RNA replication of DENV, HCV, and SARS coronavirus (35-37), for particle assembly of Ebola virus and influenza A virus (38, 39) , and for targeting of DENV C protein to lipid droplets, which is important for DENV infection (36, 42 ). An interaction between DENV C protein and the N-terminal of viperin has been shown (15). This interaction occurred at the interface of lipid droplets (15), a hub for DENV assembly (28) . Interestingly, a physical interaction between viperin and TBEV C protein could not be detected and thus might not be necessary for the induced secretion of C particles. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the N-terminal region of viperin localized to vesicular structures, together with GBF1 in agreement that this region is sufficient to target GBF1. It can be envisaged that modulation of GBF1 by viperin would potentially modulate all of the abovementioned functions both in the presence and in the absence of interaction between viperin and viral proteins and therefore constitute a widely used mechanism to impair virus spread.",

Interestingly, naked capsid-like HCV particles have been reported in vivo (48) (49) (50) , raising the possibility that viperin might be involved in inducing secretion of such capsid-like HCV particles. We found that the membrane association of the TBEV capsid particles was quite sensitive to mechanical stress; therefore, it could be that the HCV C particles are also secreted with a membrane that is lost shortly after cellular release. HCV C particles are taken up by clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human hepatoma cells (48, 51) and can induce an immune response by modifying specific phenotypic and functional markers in T cells (52) . TBEV C particles may have a similar immune modular capacity. A potential antiviral purpose of C-particle secretion could be multifarious ranging from being a side product of disturbed viral assembly, thereby reducing the overall infectivity, to having paracrine or endocrine functions, as reported for HCV (48, 52) .",

The mCherry-viperin was constructed by lifting viperin from pI.18 into a mCherry backbone. Transfection was performed with Nanofectin (PAA) or GeneJuice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol; the transfection efficiency ranged between 40 and 80%.",
