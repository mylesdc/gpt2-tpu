Kirinyaga (3.8) is combined with Murang'a (3.8); 2. Embu (4.7) is combined with Tharaka (4.7) and Mandera (1.0); 3. Laikipia (7.0) is combined with Nyandarua (3.8); 4. Nairobi (9.0) is combined with Machakos (4.7) and Kiambu (3.8); 5. Trans Nzoia (7.0) is combined with Bungoma (5.1) and Marakwet (7.0); 6. Busia is combined (5.1) with Uasin Gishu (7.0) and Vihiga (5.1); 7. Marsabit (4.7) is combined with Garissa (1.0) and Isiolo (4.7); 8. Narok (7.0) is combined with Baringo (7.0); 9. West Pokot (9.0) is combined with Turkana (7.0); 10. Taita Taveta (7.9) is combined with Kajiado (7.0); 11. Nakuru (7.0) is combined with Meru (4.7); 12. Mombasa (4.7) is combined with Kwale (4.7); 13. Kisumu (15.3) is combined with Nandi (7.0), Kericho (7.0), Bomet (7.0) and Nyamira (15.3); 14. Lamu (7.9) combined with Tana River (7.9); 15. Siaya(15.3) combined with Kakamega (5.1), 16. Wajir (1.0); 17. Kitui (4.7) is combined with Makueni (4.7); 18. Homa Bay is combined with Kisii (15.5) and Migori (15.3); 19. Nyeri (3.8) is combined with Samburu (7.8); 20. Kilifi (7.9). The number in the parentheses represents the HIV prevalence of the county [5]. (b) Represents the population sum of the region i, following the combinations of regions in (a) above [1, 2]. (c) Represents the adult populations. The conversions are made by taking the percentage of adult population to be 54.77 for all region [4]. (d) Represents the total number of infected individuals in a region. The infections is contributed by the HIV prevalences of each count constituting the named region. (e) Represents the susceptible individuals of each region.",
