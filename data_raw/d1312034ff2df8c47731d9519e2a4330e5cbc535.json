Although vaccines have provided some immunity, many populations, including infants and pregnant women, remain at risk for serious illness. Through the use of the novel \"Identify, Isolate, Inform\" (3I) tool, emergency department (ED) providers can readily recognize key symptoms of the disease and risk factors for exposure, thus curbing its transmission through early initiation of antimicrobial therapy and post-exposure prophylaxis. The three classic stages of pertussis include an initial catarrhal stage, characterized by nonspecific upper respiratory infection symptoms, which may advance to the paroxysmal stage, revealing the distinctive \"whooping cough.\" This cough can persist for weeks to months leading into the convalescent stage. Household contacts of patients with suspected pertussis or other asymptomatic, high-risk populations (infants, pregnant women in their third trimester, and childcare workers) may benefit from post-exposure prophylactic therapy. The Pertussis 3I tool can also alert healthcare professionals to the proper respiratory droplet precautions during contact with a symptomatic patient, as well as isolation practices until antimicrobial treatment is in progress. ED personnel should then inform local public health departments of any suspected cases. All of these actions will ultimately aid public health in controlling the incidence of pertussis cases, thus ensuring the protection of the general public from this re-emerging respiratory illness.

            "text": "The presentation of pertussis varies widely, and can be affected by factors such as vaccination status and age. It is classically described as having three stages. [11] [12] [13] [14] After an initial incubation period of 7-10 days, the disease begins with the catarrhal stage, which has a duration of one to two weeks. This manifests as a mild cough with lacrimation and rhinorrhea. There may also be a low-grade fever. After the catarrhal stage, the patient may advance to the paroxysmal stage, which lasts two to four weeks. This is where the characteristic paroxysmal or \"whooping cough\" may occur, described as a grouping of multiple short coughs followed by a single, forceful inspiratory \"whoop.\" An audio example of this signature cough is available here: http://www.pkids.org/diseases/pertussis.html. This cough may be associated with emesis, cyanosis or even apnea. 15 The third or convalescent stage is characterized by a persistent cough that can last from four weeks up to several months. This is why pertussis is known as the \"100-day cough\" in China. 16 Older children, adolescents, and adults may report a nonproductive cough that is worse at night or feelings of a choking sensation. They likely will be asymptomatic between coughing episodes. 11 Presenting symptoms may be nonspecific in both infants and older patients. Young infants may initially be afebrile with mild symptoms that rapidly progress to respiratory distress/apnea, hypoxia or seizures. 12",

Adults presenting with cough may have non-infectious causes for their symptoms such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, or gastroesophageal reflux disease. 22 Foreign body aspiration is also possible in patients presenting with cough and is sometimes associated with cyanosis or apnea.",

With the former, the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend children with pertussis refrain from attending school until they have completed five days of antibiotic treatment. 25 However, since pertussis is often not definitively diagnosed, it's unclear as to the true benefit of this exclusion, leading some public health authorities to adopt a more liberal policy of allowing children who have started, but perhaps have not yet completed, their antibiotic course to attend school. 25 Consultation with one's local health department may assist with this decision.

The novel Pertussis Identify, Isolate, Inform (3I) tool can aid emergency department staff in readily recognizing key symptoms of the disease and risk factors for exposure. The Pertussis 3I tool can also alert the healthcare workforce to the appropriate isolation protocols for use during contact with a symptomatic patient. With this added knowledge, healthcare workers can protect both themselves and others (especially infants and pregnant women) from contracting disease. Further, they can educate patients, in addition to exposed individuals, on the importance of early Pertussis: The 3I Tool Applied to a Re-emerging Respiratory Illness Koenig et al.",
