However, the expense and time required for sequencing using high throughput methods such as 454 (Roche), Solexa (Illumina), or SOLiD (Life Technologies) can make these methods prohibitive for routine use, especially when the resources required for data processing and analysis are taken into account. Viruses at low concentration may be missed if coverage is insufficient, and host sequence may make up 90% or more of the reads [1] . At the other end of the cost spectrum, PCR assays are very fast and sensitive, but have limited capacity for multiplexing (to test for the presence of several organisms simultaneously). They are also intolerant of primer-target mismatches; this is an advantage for detecting a microbe whose sequence is precisely known, but a great disadvantage for discovery of novel species, or for detecting variant strains of a known species.",

Arrays can be designed with a combination of detection and discovery probes, which respectively target speciesspecific regions (for precise characterization of known pathogens), or more conserved regions (to enable detection of novel organisms with some homology to previously sequenced organisms). Compared to sequencing, microarray analysis has the disadvantage that probes designed from known sequences are unlikely to detect truly novel organisms lacking homology to those sequences. However, microbial genomes are difficult and time-consuming to characterize when they have no similarity to known sequences, so the ability of sequencing to identify novel genomes has limited practical benefit in a rapid diagnostic context. Microbial detection arrays provide an assessment of known pathogens complementary to that provided by a functional gene array, such as the array to detect virulence and antibiotic resistance gene families described in [2] . Detection arrays can tell what organisms are present, while functional arrays can tell what capabilities those organisms might possess. Together these tools may be applied to detect antibiotic resistant or virulent pathogen variants, natural chimeras, or genetically engineered organisms with unusual gene content.",

They may thus be used to guide the selection of a subset of samples for further analysis by sequencing. Arrays can also be applied to study clinical samples for which PCR diagnostics have been uninformative. Often, the cause of a clinically severe infection is unknown, complicating the decision of whether to treat with antibiotics, antivirals, or other therapies. With optimization, and sufficiently high pathogen titers, we have successfully generated array results in as little as 2 hours (unpublished data). Moreover, arrays can assist in uncovering co-infections with more than one organism. Microbial detection arrays can also be used to check isolate stocks and vaccines for adventitious contaminants [9] . Finally, arrays can be used to assess the complexity of a metagenomic sample to determine the desired depth for sequencing, potentially saving costs on low complexity samples. Microarrays may reveal greater diversity in complex environmental samples than sequencing of a typical sized clone library [10] . Until the processing time and cost of high throughput sequencing (including data analysis) decreases enough to be feasible for large numbers of samples at sufficient depth, microarrays will continue to be a valuable tool.",

Viral probes were designed to target a minimum of three genomic regions for each family or genus, including at least one highly conserved region coding for polymerase or structural proteins, and two or more variable regions. Bacterial, fungal and protozoan probes were exclusively designed against variable segments of rRNA genes (16S for bacteria, 18S for eukaryotes), flanked by highly conserved regions, so that the target regions could be amplified with a small number of specific PCR primers. Other groups have followed similar strategies for bacterial array design [10, [15] [16] [17] . The lack of any similar genes universally conserved among viruses precludes using this approach for viral target amplification. Similar arrays designed by the same group include the GreeneChipVr [3] (targeting viruses only) and the GreeneChipResp [18] (targeting respiratory pathogens). The GreeneChipPm array successfully identified viruses at the species level, and was used to implicate Plasmodium falciparum for an unexplained death. It performed less well with bacterial samples, because probes against the 16S rRNA variable regions frequently crosshybridized across taxa, so that some bacteria could only be identified at family or class resolution.",

The outcome variables in the likelihood model are the positive signal probabilities for each probe, given the presence of a particular combination of targets in the sample.

Log 2 intensities for target-specific probes either cluster with the control and nonspecific probes (when they have low BLAST scores, usually), or approach the maximum possible value (16) .

We observed that this nonspecific hybridization occurs more often with probes having low sequence complexity, i.e. long homopolymers and tandem repeats. One measure of the complexity of a probe sequence is the entropy of its trimer frequency distribution, which we compute as described in Methods could be used as a predictor of nonspecific hybridization, we selected data from nine MDA v2 arrays for which all sample components had known genome sequences. We selected probes with no BLAST hits to any of the known targets, grouped them by entropy into equal sized bins, computed the positive signal frequency (the fraction of probes with positive signals), converted the frequency to a log-odds value, and plotted the logodds against the trimer entropy, as shown in Figure 3 . We also fit a logistic regression model for the probe signal as a function of entropy; a dashed line with the resulting slope and intercept is shown in the plot. The figure shows that the trimer entropy is an excellent predictor of the non-specific positive signal probability, and that probes with low entropy are more likely to give positive signals regardless of the target sequence. While the nonspecific probe signal probability depends on the probe sequence only, the target-specific signal probability was assumed to be a function of both the probe sequence and probe-target sequence similarity. To determine an appropriate set of predictors for the specific signal probability, given the presence of a specific target, we BLASTed the probe sequences against our database of target genomes, obtaining the best alignment (if any) for each probe-target pair. We then derived various covariates from the probe-target alignment, including the alignment length, number of mismatches, bit score, E-value, predicted melting temperature, and alignment start and end positions. We tested all combinations of up to three covariates, using logistic regression to fit models to data from samples containing known targets, and performed leave-one-out validation to find the combination with the strongest predictive value. The best combination included three covariates: (1) The predicted melting temperature, computed as described in Methods; (2) the BLAST bit score and (3) the alignment start position relative to the 5' end of the probe. We expected the alignment start position to have a significant effect, because we observed in our previous work [2] that probe-target mismatches had a weaker effect on hybridization if the mismatch was closer to the 3' end of the probe (nearer to the array surface).",

Genome comparisons indicate that M. ferrooxydans, TM7b, and marine gamma proteobacterium HTCC2143 share 70%, 55%, and 61%, respectively, of their sequence with other bacteria and viruses, based on simply considering every oligo of size at least 18 nt also present in other sequenced viruses or bacteria, so many of the probes designed for other organisms may also hybridize to these targets.",

We confirmed the results using specific PCR for these two viruses (Additional file 1). The results were also confirmed by the DeRisi lab using the ViroChip. The MDA results indicated small log-odds scores for influenza A, leek yellow stripe potyvirus, and HIV-1, although these low scores are a result of just a few probes and are likely due to nonspecific binding rather than true positives. Other samples tested using MDA v.1 also had low scoring predictions for Influenza A and Leek yellow stripe potyvirus (see Table 1 ), which we suspect were due to non-specific binding. Closer examination of probes giving high signal intensities that were not consistent with the \"detected\" organisms showed that there were some \"sticky\" probes that seemed to bind non-specifically. On the MDA v.2 array, we noted that 141 probes were detected in a majority (31 out of 60) of arrays hybridized to a wide variety of sample types. A small number of these probes were found to have significant BLAST hits to the human genome. Since most of the samples tested on the array were either human clinical samples or were grown in Vero cells (an African green monkey cell line), the frequent high signals for these few probes can be explained by the presence of primate DNA in the sample. The vast majority of sticky probes, however, were not explained by cross-hybridization to host DNA. We did note significant differences between sticky and nonsticky probes in the distributions of trimer entropy and hybridization free energy; sticky probes had smaller entropies (mean 4.6 vs 4.8 bits, p = 7.5 \u00d7 10 -14 ) and more negative free energies (mean -70.5 vs -66.8 kcal/ mol, p = 3.8 \u00d7 10 -13 ) compared to 1755 non-sticky probes detected in 11 or fewer samples.

The source (e.g. fecal or serum) was blinded during our analyses, but was provided later: sample 1_5 from serum (Figure 7) , and the rest from fecal sources (Figures 8, 9 , 10, and 11). No patient history was provided. A strong signal indicating the presence of hepatitis B virus was detected in sample 1_5 (Figure 7) . In all the remaining samples, signals were detected for a mixture of both viruses and bacteria, many of which are known to be associated with gastrointestinal distress. All of the organisms detected by the array were confirmed by PCR except Serratia proteamaculans in sample 2_3 and the E. coli pAPEC O2-ColV plasmid in sample 2_4 (Additional file 1) In some cases, multiple species in a genus have similarly high log-odds ratios, suggesting that a member of that genus is likely to be present, but the MDA cannot make a definitive call as to which species. For example, signals for multiple Streptococcus species were detected in sample 2_1 (Figure 8 ). We expect that this pattern could arise in cases where a novel unsequenced isolate from the genus is present, in cases where conservation at the genus level is sufficiently high that the conserved probes do not provide species discrimination, or when multiple related organisms are present. Since the probes were selected from conserved regions within a family, the array was not designed for stringent species or strain discrimination. In sample 2_3 (Figure 10 ) we saw a strong signal for the presence of chicken anemia virus which was confirmed by PCR. This circovirus infects chickens, pointing to a dietary influence on the components of this human fecal sample. It is similar to the recently discovered and widespread human TT virus and TTV-like mini virus (TLMV) [21] . Other studies have also found viruses from food in fecal samples [22] . Phage are also commonly detected in feces, particularly when sample preparation enriches for phage, for example, by purification in a cesium chloride gradient [23] . We did not do any gradient purification for phage enrichment, and although we detected more signals from bacteria than from the bacteriophage that infect those bacteria, we did detect signals for Staphylococcus aureus phage as the viral component of sample 2_4, as well as signals that its host bacteria was present ( Figure 11 ).",

Results from clinical samples were validated using PCR. The MDA v.2 has higher probe density and larger phylogenetic representation of viral and bacterial sequenced genomes than other published array designs. It can be applied to problems in viral and bacterial detection from pure or complex environmental or clinical samples. It may be particularly useful to widen the scope of search for microbial identification when specific PCR fails, as well as to identify co-infecting organisms. The analysis method described here differs in several key ways from previous statistical approaches to analyze microbial detection arrays, such as E-Predict [24] and GreeneLAMP [12] . E-Predict compares a probe intensity vector for each array against a theoretical hybridization free energy vector for each sequence in a target database, both normalized to unit length, using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Significance values are assigned to the correlation scores by comparing them against an empirical distribution derived from over 1,000 array experiments. To handle samples that may contain a mixture of organisms, there is an iterative version of E-Predict, which, after identifying the most likely target on an array, sets the intensities of the probes matching the target to zero, computes new correlation coefficients, and repeats the identification process. Since it requires a corpus of data from previous experiments with the same array design, E-Predict cannot be applied to new, prototype array designs. E-Predict also has limited applicability to complex samples, in which several closely related strains of the same species may be present.",

Intensities are first background-corrected, using data from a matched control array when available, or random control probes on the same array otherwise. The parameters of the distribution are inferred from the intensities of all probes on the array, under the assumption (usually justified) that only a small fraction of probes will hybridize to the target on the array. Probes are categorized as positive or negative by comparing their p-values against a fixed threshold. The p-values for the positive probes associated with each taxon are then multiplied, and an aggregate p-value computed for the product, using the method of Bailey [25] . Finally, candidate taxa are ranked by the aggregate p-value. The GreeneLAMP method depends heavily on the assumption that probe intensities are independent measurements of target genome abundances, which is not always justified. An iterative version of the method has not been reported to date; this makes it inappropriate for identifying mixtures of organisms in a sample, since the output of the algorithm is a single ranked list of taxa",

In cases where a sample contains an organism that has not been sequenced (or whose sequence is not in our analysis database), but is sufficiently similar to other sequenced microbes, the analysis will identify multiple related organisms most similar to the one in the sample. Similar results will be seen when the sample DNA is degraded or low in concentration, so the analysis cannot determine that a novel or unsequenced organism is present. Therefore, users of the MDA will need to interpret the data in the context of what else is known about the sample, to determine whether the predicted organisms are exact matches to known species or are novel but with some similarity to other sequenced microbes. Highly novel targets with no similarity to genomes in the database or probes on the array will not be detected. The failure of the MDA to detect VSV NJ in pure culture illustrates this well, and highlights a shortcoming of our approach to use only complete genomes to design the array. Future versions of the array will include all available sequence data, including partial sequences and gene fragments, for species lacking complete genomes. Modified statistical algorithms will then be required to deal with sequence length bias when partial genomes are included in the database. Most importantly, as new sequence data becomes available from newly discovered or newly sequenced organisms, the MDA must be updated with probes to detect them. We are currently designing Version 3 of the MDA to address these issues, probing both partial and complete bacterial and viral sequences, as well as fungi and some protozoa.",

[2] This is similar to results from a systematic study of viral probe hybridization characteristics by [7] . Therefore, for each target family we eliminated regions with perfect matches to sequences outside the target family. Using the suffix array software Vmatch [26] , perfect match subsequences of at least 17 nt long present in non-target viral families or 25 nt long present in the human genome or nontarget bacterial families were eliminated from consideration as possible probe subsequences. Sequence similarity of probes to non-target sequences below this threshold was allowed, but could be accounted for using the statistical algorithm described below.",

Candidate probes with unsuitable \u0394G's or T m 's were excluded as described in [2] . Desirable range for these parameters was 50 \u2264 length \u2264 66, T m \u226580\u00b0C, 25% \u2264 GC% \u2264 75%, \u0394G homodimer = \u0394G of homodimer formation > 15 kcal/mol, \u0394G hairpin = \u0394G of hairpin formation > -11 kcal/mol, and \u0394G adjusted = \u0394G complement -1.45 \u0394G hairpin -0.33 \u0394G homodimer \u2264 -52 kcal/mol. For the v2 array design, which includes bacterial probes, an additional minimum sequence complexity constraint was enforced, requiring a trimer frequency entropy of at least 4.5 (calculation described below). If fewer than a minimum number of candidate probes per target sequence passed all the criteria, then those criteria were relaxed to allow a sufficient number of probes per target. To relax the criteria, first candidates that passed the Primer3 criteria but failed the Unafold filters were allowed. If no candidates passed the Primer3 criteria, then regions passing the target-specificity (e.g. family specific) and minimum length constraints were allowed. From these candidates, we selected probes in decreasing order of the number of targets represented by that probe (i.e. probes detecting more targets in the family were chosen preferentially over those that detected fewer targets in the family), where a target was considered to be represented if a probe matched it with at least 85% sequence similarity over the total probe length, and a perfectly matching subsequence of at least 29 contiguous bases spanned the middle of the probe. For probes that tied in the number of targets represented, a secondary ranking was used to favor probes most dispersed across the target from those probes which had already been selected to represent that target. The probe with the same conservation rank that occurred at the farthest distance from any probe already selected from the target sequence was the next probe to be chosen to represent that target.",
