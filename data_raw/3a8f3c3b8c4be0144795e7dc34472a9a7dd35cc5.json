            "text": "Background: Campylobacter jejuni is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of many food-animals including sheep without causing visible clinical symptoms of disease. However, C. jejuni has been implicated in ovine abortion cases worldwide. Specifically, in the USA, the C. jejuni sheep abortion (SA) clone has been increasingly associated with sheep abortion. In vivo studies in sheep (the natural host) are needed to better characterize the virulence potential and pathogenesis of this clone. Results: Pregnant ewes intravenously (IV) or orally inoculated with ovine or bovine abortion-associated C. jejuni SA clones exhibited partial or complete uterine prolapse with retained placenta, and abortion or stillbirth, whereas delivery of healthy lambs occurred in pregnant ewes inoculated with C. jejuni 81-176 or in the uninfected group. In sheep inoculated with the SA clone, histopathological lesions including suppurative necrotizing placentitis and/or endometritis coincided with: 1) increased apoptotic death of trophoblasts, 2) increased expression of the host genes (e.g. genes encoding interleukin IL-6 and IL-15) related to cellular necrosis and pro-inflammatory responses in uterus, and 3) decreased expression of the genes encoding GATA binding protein 6, chordin, and insulin-like 3 (INSL3) that account for embryonic development in uterus. Immunohistochemistry revealed localization of bacterial antigens in trophoblasts lining the chorioallantoic membrane of ewes inoculated with the C. jejuni SA clone. Conclusions: The results showed that C. jejuni SA clones are capable of causing abortion or stillbirth in experimentally infected sheep. Furthermore, down-or up-regulation of specific genes in the uterus of infected pregnant ewes might implicate host genes in facilitating the disease progression. Since the C. jejuni SA strains share genotypic similarities with clones that have been isolated from human clinical cases of gastroenteritis, these strains might represent a potential public health risk.",

C. jejuni is commonly found in the intestinal tract of many food-producing animals, such as poultry, cattle, and sheep [1] . In these hosts, C. jejuni generally persists without causing visible clinical symptoms of disease. Although it has been historically known that C. fetus subsp fetus (vibriosis) is the main cause of ovine abortion, recently C. jejuni has been increasingly implicated in ovine abortion cases worldwide [2] [3] [4] [5] . Campylobacter-induced ovine abortion rates usually range from 5% to 50% in infected flocks [4, 6] . C. jejuni has been identified in aborted lambs during multiple lambing seasons on different farms in Iowa, Idaho, South Dakota, and California [5] . A specific tetracycline-resistant C. jejuni clone (SA) has emerged as the major cause of C. jejuniassociated sheep abortion in the USA [5] . In addition, clone SA has been also detected in abortion cases in cows and goats [7] .",

Furthermore, infection can occasionally result in the retention of dead fetus in the uterus which may cause death of pregnant ewes due to septicemia and uterine sepsis; however, no clinical signs can be seen at the beginning of infection [4] . The mechanisms by which the gut commensal C. jejuni is able to establish systemic infection and lead to an acute abortion in sheep are still not completely defined. Furthermore, in a recent study, PFGE analysis of C. jejuni SA isolates revealed a high similarity to human gastroenteritis-associated C. jejuni isolates [7] . This suggested a potential relevance of these ovine abortion isolates to human health. Therefore, there is a critical need for understanding the pathogenesis of C. jejuni induced abortion.",

By necessity, microbial pathogenesis studies are heavily focused on the use of in vivo models, because the host immune responses interplay with pathogen evasion constitute a complex response that cannot yet be accurately replicated in vitro. Experiments were designed to use the minimal number of animals (4 ewes per group) necessary to generate interpretable data. Specifically, based on the C. jejuni associated abortion rates reported in the literature (50%) and preliminary studies, using 4 animals per group yielded a power of 0.85 (\u03b1 =0.05).

The microarray generated transcripts were further mapped to available gene annotation in IPA. The number of IPA mapped genes was further compared across different treatment groups. Despite the poor annotation of the Ovis aries genome, BLAST searches against IPA knowledge database using human, rat, and mouse reference species allowed identification of a total of 51 mapped probes displaying expression changes greater or lesser than 2 folds between non-inoculated controls and 81-176, bovine, or ovine C. jejuni clone SA infected ewes from the complete set of differentially expressed genes ( Table 2) . IPA was used for gene ontology (GO) analysis. Datasets from a total of 6 groups were analyzed for GO; (control) cont-vs-G1 (81-176 strain), cont-vs-G2 (bovine strain), and cont-vs-G3 (ovine strain), G1-vs-G2, G1 vs G3 and G2 vs G3. Of the 51 genes analyzed, 14 (~27%) of upand/or -down regulated genes were common among different datasets (Table 2) only, and 14 (~27%) were down-regulated across all groups compared. The genes encoding extracellular marker proteins and other proteins involved in immune responses, cellular apoptosis and necrosis, embryonic development, cellular growth, proliferation and differentiation, and organismal injury and abnormalities were also differentially expressed among the different comparisons (Table 2) . Of particular interest, several genes evidently showed down shift expression in animals from G2 and G3 compared to either G1 (infected with 81-176 C. jejuni) or the control non-inoculated group ( Table 2) . For example, the gene encoding GATA binding protein 6 (GATA6) was down-regulated by approximately 2 folds in G2 and G3 as compared to the control non-inoculated group. Similarly, gene encoding insulin-like 3 (Leydig cell; INSL3) was downregulated by approximately 2 and 3 folds in G2 and G3, respectively, compared to the negative control group. The gene encoding chordin (CHRD) was down-regulated by approximately 2 and 2.4 folds in G2 and G3, respectively. However, several genes were upregulated particularly in aborted ewes from G2 and G3 compared to either G1 or the control non-inoculated group. For example, the gene encoding matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) was up-regulated by around 2.1 and 2.4 folds in G2 and G3, respectively. The gene encoding tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) was up-regulated by around 2 folds in both G2 and G3 as compared to G1. The gene encoding gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) was up-regulated by 2.4 and 3.5 in G2 and G3, respectively ( Table 2) .",

Recently, it was shown that the C. jejuni clone SA can effectively induce abortion in pregnant guinea pigs [9] . However, no studies have characterized the virulence of these strains in a natural host (sheep). In this study, under experimental conditions, abortion-associated C. jejuni belonging to clone SA seemed to effectively induce abortion or stillbirth in pregnant sheep when high doses of inoculum (10 9 CFU in 1.5 ml of SS for i/v) were used. This corroborated a previous study [8] and was further confirmed in our preliminary trials where no abortion was observed in pregnant ewes infected with lower doses of C. jejuni (10 6 CFU in 1.5 ml of SS for i/v), although several significant clinical signs such as uterine prolapse and retained placenta were noted (data not shown). Additionally, based on our preliminary trials, the differences in the pregnancy stages of ewes might result in disparity in the induction of abortion. However, when using the higher dose of C. jejuni and ewes with synchronized pregnancies, typical abortion occurred in one (G3-O-2) of the ewes that were orally inoculated with the ovine isolate from G3 at PID 15 ( Figure 1A ). Stillbirths were also observed in 2 cases (G2-V-1 and G2-V-2) from G2 and one case (G3-O-1) from G3, which were inoculated i/v and orally with bovine and ovine isolates, respectively (Table 1) . Furthermore, one ewe (G3-V-1) infected i/v, died 20 h postinoculation and in the other ewe (G3-V-2) no C. jejuni was isolated from any tissues. However, at postmortem G3-V-2 was found to be heavily infested with tapeworm, which might have affected C. jejuni colonization. The cause of sudden death might be due to acute septicemia and uterine sepsis or due to the septic shock which can be caused by the systemic inflammatory response to the bacteremia of Gram negative bacteria [4, 15] . Macroscopic observations in aborted ewes or fetuses in this study were mostly in agreement with previous findings [5, 8] . Gross lesions that mostly consisted of hemorrhagic fibrinosuppurative placentitis and endometritis were evident in the majority of ewes infected with the abortion-associated C. jejuni ( Figure 1B ). In addition, petechial hemorrhages were seen on the liver and spleen of i/v inoculated ewes from both groups (G2 and G3). In the guinea pig model, rather than hemorrhagic lesions, multiple round and white foci of variable sizes were identified on liver in 90% of pregnant guinea pigs infected with ovine abortion inducing C. jejuni strain [9] .",

Based on this observation, it is presumed that these strains might employ bacteremia to establish their infection in the reproductive organs. Using IHC, bacterial antigens were mainly detected in trophoblasts lining the chorioallontoic membrane, usually undergoing necrosis ( Figure 2E and F). Placentomes also exhibited severe suppurative inflammatory and necrotic lesions possibly caused by C. jejuni, which was frequently observed within the lesions ( Figure 2C and D). Similar necrotic lesions with numerous large C. jejuni aggregates (colonies) in the placental villi and adjacent stroma were previously identified in inoculated ewes [8] . These data indicate a possible cellular tropism of abortion-associated C. jejuni in the placental epithelial cells possibly transported via the bloodstream. Consistent with suppurative inflammatory lesions in other major organs, such as uterus, liver, spleen, and lymph node, the bacteriological examination revealed C. jejuni in multiple tissues, including liver, spleen, uterus, placenta, blood, small intestine of infected ewes, as well as from offspring's feces, fetuses' meconium, small intestine and blood as shown in Table 1 . Based on the data, the abortionassociated C. jejuni might be able to induce systemic infection, usually accompanied by intestinal and reproductive infection. In the pregnant guinea pig model, large numbers of C. jejuni were mainly retrieved from placental and uterine tissues, while small to moderate numbers of bacteria were recovered from feces and blood as well as from fetal liver and lung samples [9] . Similarly, high counts of C. jejuni were detected in uterine and placental tissues and from stomach content, bile, and feces of ewes infected with ovine abortion C. jejuni as well as from aborted fetuses [8] .",

The genes encoding GATA binding protein 6 (GATA6) and chordin (CHRD) that account for embryonic development [22, 23] and dorsalization of early vertebrate embryonic tissues [24] , respectively, were down-regulated in G2 and G3 vs. the control non-inoculated group or the G1 infected with 81-176 (Table 2 ). In addition, insulin-like 3 (Leydig cell; INSL3) that is essential for the embryonic development [25] was down-regulated in G2 and G3 vs. the control group. These data suggest that the impairment of embryonic development caused by abortion-associated C. jejuni infection might be in part responsible for abortion of fetuses identified in the G3.",

            "text": "In the G3 infected with ovine C. jejuni, the gene encoding EGR1 which stimulates apoptosis and inflammatory response [26] was up-regulated compared to G1 and G2. Concomitantly, there was an increase in the gene expression of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, in G3 compared to G1 and G2 (Table 2) . Elevated levels of IL-6 in the placenta, amniotic cells, and endometrium have been demonstrated in pregnancies complicated by preterm premature rupture of the membranes, intrauterine infection, and prematurity [27, 28] . Consistent with the increased levels of prostaglandin receptor EP4 (Ptger4) in uterine tissue of IL6-/-mice compared with wild type mice [29] , down-regulation of Ptger4 gene was significantly observed in the G3 showing increased IL-6. In addition to increased expression of IL-6 gene, up-regulation in the gene expression of TNF receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF3) was detected in the G3 vs. G1 and G2. The TRAF3 plays a role in the activation of the immune response [30] . Increased pro-inflammatory responses detected in the lesions in this study might be in part implicated in increased apoptotic death of infected placental cells. The IL-15 plays a regulatory role in mediating the inflammatory environment [31, 32] . Of interest, this cytokine might be associated with abortion [33, 34] . Previous studies showed that up-regulation of IL-15 gene in trophoblasts contributed to recurrent abortions, suggesting that this cytokine can be a marker for pregnancy failure [33, 34] . Similar to increased expression of IL-6 gene stated earlier, up-regulation of IL-15 gene expression was detected in the G3 and G2 vs. the negative control. The activated immunological status during pregnancy after inoculation with the abortion-associated C. jejuni might be implicated in the related abortive pathogenesis. The increased apoptotic cell death in placental tissues particularly from aborted ewes in G2 and G3 vs. the G1 or control group (Figure 4 ) might be related to the increased responses of pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, and IL-15 as described previously [35] [36] [37] .",

ST-8 has been previously recorded in different hosts, including humans [5, 13] , thus the abortion isolates may have zoonotic potential warranting further investigation of their implications to public health. Although there are no reports on associating clone SA to human abortions, the highly abortificient nature and the presence of large number of bacteria in aborted materials as well as in fetal tissues [9] may pose a potential environmental risk for zoonotic infections. The latter is also indicated by existing evidence that suggest that the clone SA is associated with human gastroenteritis [5, 7] . Both ovine and bovine abortion associated C. jejuni in this study were capable of invading the human intestinal epithelial cells (INT407). Specifically, ovine abortion-II was as invasive in INT407 as the hyper-invasive strain C. jejuni 81-176 (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ) and showed significantly higher intracellular survival than that of the NCTC11168 (P < 0.05), a poorly invasive strain [38] . These findings further highlight the potential public health impact of the abortion associated C. jejuni strains.",

The distinct genomic contents and transcriptome responses of clone SA may facilitate its systemic spread and subsequent localization in the sheep uterus leading to abortion. However, further studies are needed to define the bacterial factors contributing to clone SA's unique virulence and pathogenesis in sheep.
