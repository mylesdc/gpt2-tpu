These mAbs demonstrated potent neutralizing activities against both pseudo and live Ebola virus independent of complement. Biochemical, single particle EM, and mutagenesis analysis suggested Q206 and Q411 recognized novel epitopes in the head while Q314 targeted the glycan cap in the GP1 subunit. Q206 and Q411 appeared to influence GP binding to its receptor NPC1. Treatment with these mAbs provided partial but significant protection against disease in a mouse model of Ebola virus infection. These novel mAbs could serve as promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against Ebola virus infection.",

Since its discovery in 1976, Ebolavirus has caused frequent outbreaks across Central Africa with exceedingly high mortality rate up to 90% 1,2 . While the natural host is currently unknown, Ebolavirus has been exploring more species as hosts across broader geographic frontiers 3-5 . Most notable was the unprecedented outbreak in West Africa in 2014 where the number of affected people has surpassed all the previously recorded cases combined 1 , raising the concerns about its pandemic potential and posing a serious threat to global health. Genetically, Ebolavirus isolated so far represents a divergent and evolving cluster and can be broadly classified into 5 species: Zaire (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), Bundibugyo (BDBV), Reston (RESTV), and Tai Forest (TAFV) viruses 6 . Multiple lineages of EBOV were identified with increasing phylogenetic and genetic diversity in the 2014 outbreak in West Africa 7-12 . While it is uncertain whether the observed genetic diversity is the cause or the consequence of the current epidemic, the high mortality rate associated with rapid human to human transmission strongly argue for more effective therapeutics and vaccines against EBOV infection.",

GP2 wraps around GP1 to forms the base of the chalice containing the fusion loop as well as N-and C-terminal heptad repeat regions critical for viral fusion 14 . During viral entry, GP undergoes proteolytic cleavage by endosomal cathepsin proteases to generate cleaved GP (GPcl) devoid of the glycan cap and MLD and exposes additional surface residues required for NPC1 binding 15 . In addition, the unedited GP gene encodes for soluble GP (sGP) which includes the glycan cap but lacks the MLD and GP2 13 . It has been shown that sGP is produced in larger quantity than GP during replication and may therefore act as a decoy by binding to neutralizing antibodies 13 . Such complexity in GP structure and insidious tactics to evade and distract immune recognition may partially explain why majority of infected individuals succumbed to diseases and failed to generate strong neutralizing antibody during natural infection 16, 17 .",

            "text": "Recently, significant progress has been made in antibody therapy and vaccines against EBOV although no product has yet to receive regulatory approval [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . In particular, monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktails instead of single mAb conferred protection to nonhuman primates when passively administered after otherwise lethal viral challenge 21, 22, [24] [25] [26] [27] . The most potent and successful cocktails include MB-003 consisting of human or human-mouse chimeric mAbs c13C6, h13F6 and c6D8 22, 25 , ZMAb consisting of murine mAbs m1H3, m2G4 and m4G7 23 , and ZMapp consisting of human-mouse chimeric mAbs c13C6, c2G4 and c4G7 24 . Most strikingly, ZMapp demonstrated protection effect in nonhuman primates when administered as late as 5 days post infection and used on a compassionate basis in humans during the 2014 outbreak 24, 28 . Epitope mapping of these mAbs as well as those published elsewhere has revealed convergence to the three major sites on the surface of GP including the glycan cap, mucin-like domain and the base of GP where the GP1 and GP2 subunits interact 29 . Unexpectedly, all the neutralizing mAbs target to the overlapping epitopes in the base of GP while those that do not neutralize or do not neutralize in the absence of complement bind to the glycan cap and mucin-like domains [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Most recent studies have identified several novel and cross-reactive mAbs with potent neutralizing activity and conferred protection in mouse, guinea pig or monkey models 33, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . It needs to be noted, however, that neutralizing activities of mAb is not necessarily the predictor of protection in vivo 26, 33, 34 and other mechanisms such as preventing budding of nascent viral particles from infected cells and Fc-mediated functions have to be taken into account 42 .",

Through sequential immunization of Chinese rhesus macaques and antigen-specific single B cell sorting, we have successfully identified three mAbs (Q206, Q314 and Q411) with potent neutralizing activities against pseudo and live EBOV. Epitope mapping through competitive binding, single-particle EM reconstructions and site-directed mutagenesis have revealed that Q206 and Q411 bind to novel and overlapping epitopes spanning the glycan cap and the head subdomain, approaching to the RBD of GP1 subunit. Q314, on the other hand, binds to an epitope that is partially overlapping with that of c13C6 in the glycan cap but is orientated towards the upper surface of the chalice. In distinct contrast to c13C6 and other mAbs binding to the similar or adjacent epitopes, the newly isolated mAbs are completely or partially independent of complement in live EBOV neutralization. In particular, all these novel mAbs are able to achieve close to 100% inhibition of live EBOV in the presence of complement while c13C6 plateaued just above 50% inhibition. Furthermore, treatment with these mAbs individualy provided partial but significant protection against disease progression in a mouse model of EBOV infection. Collectively, these results suggest that Q206 and Q411 recognize novel epitopes in the GP1 subunit with potent neutralizing activity and could serve as promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against Ebola virus infection.",

We used recombinant GPdM with the deletion of mucin-like domain (MLD) and transmembrane domains to immunize two rhesus macaques (Rh091730 and Rh100888) largely due to the earlier studies indicating the bulky MLD is highly variable and able to shield the critical receptor binding domain (RBD) of Ebola virus glycoprotein 13, 14, 29, 43, 44 . To enhance and promote the maturation of the antibody response, eight consecutive immunizations were performed through intramuscular route at 4-week intervals before the blood samples were collected and evaluated for antibody binding and neutralization activities. Both animals mounted a strong antibody binding activity measured by ELISA as well as neutralizing activity using pseudovirus bearing the glycoprotein of EBOV Mayinga strain (supplementary Fig. 1 ). In particular, Rh100888 appeared to have 3-fold higher neutralizing activities than that of Rh091730 (527 vs. 156 in ID 50 values) (supplementary Fig. 1b) . We have therefore chosen the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Rh100888 to isolate GPdM-specific single memory B cells (CD3 \u2212 , CD16 \u2212 , CD235a \u2212 , CD19 + , CD27 + , CD38 \u2212 , and IgG + ) by FACS (supplementary Fig. 1c ) and to amplify the variable regions of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes (VH and VL) by an optimized nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 27 paired VH and VL sequences from the sorted single B cells were obtained and fused with the constant region fragment of human IgG1 to generate bivalent full-length chimeric mAbs. Once confirmed by sequencing, the full-length heavy and light chain plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells for the production, purification and characterization of mAbs.",

            "text": "Binding and neutralizing activity against pseudo and live Ebola virus infection. We first analyzed the binding activity of isolated mAbs to four different forms of EBOV GP including the recombinant GPdM, sGP, and GPcl as well as GP with deletion of MLD (GPdMuc) expressed on the surface of 293T cells. Among the total of 27 mAbs successfully isolated and produced, 5 (Q203, Q206, Q314, Q411 and Q703) had detectable binding to GPdM measured by ELISA. Q206, Q314 and Q411 demonstrated strong binding affinity comparable to that of the control mAbs c13C6 and KZ52 while Q203 or Q703 was merely above the detection threshold (Fig. 1a ). Similar differences were also found in the binding to GPdMuc expressed on the surface of 293T cells, suggesting that binding of these mAbs is independent of MLD. Like c13C6, Q206, Q314 and Q411 bound strongly to sGP indicating their epitopes are located in the N-terminus of GP1 subunit where GPdM and sGP share amino acid residues between 31-295 29 . Interestingly, Q206 and Q411 maintained strong binding to the glycan cap missing GPcl while Q314 and c13C6 failed, suggesting that Q206 and Q411 recognized epitopes distinct from that by Q314 and c13C6. Genetically, each of the 5 mAbs had unique VH and VL sequences although Q206 and Q411 shared homologous sequence throughout except for the CDR3 sequence in VH ( Table 1 ). The gene families of the 5 mAbs were quite divergent for both VH (1 V H 1, 1 V H 2, 2 V H 3, and 1 V H 4) and VL (3 V \u03bb 1, and 2 V \u03bb 2) with variable degree of divergence (90.1-95.3%) from the rhesus macaque germline sequences ( Table 1 ). The degree of humanness of these recombinant full-length mAbs ranged from 97.3-99.7% by analyzing the amino acid sequence compared with human immunoglobulin gene using germline index 45 .",

Consistent with binding activity, Q206, Q314 and Q411 demonstrated potent neutralization against EBOV (Mayinga strain) with IC 50 values ranging from 0.36 to 0.78 \u03bc g/ml while Q203 and Q703 showed negligible effect ( Fig. 1b and Table 2 ). Like KZ52, Q206, Q314 and Q411 were able to reach IC 90 but c13C6 plateaued prematurely around 70% inhibition despite increases in concentration (Fig. 1b) , consistent with earlier report 46 . Furthermore, differences in slope and AUC were also found among and between isolated and control mAbs, suggesting different mAbs demonstrated different potency and may exert their neutralizing activity through different mechanisms ( Table 2) 47 . None of the isolated mAbs demonstrated any cross-neutralizing activity against the remaining species of Ebolaviruses (SUDV, BDBV, RESTV, or TAFV) or the pseudovirus bearing the envelope glycoprotein from MARV, HIV-1 or VSV. Only c13C6 displayed some level of cross-activity against SUDV strain as previously reported 32 . No cross-binding was found against GPdM from SUDV, BDBV and MARV (supplementary (Fig. 1b) . Furthermore, Q206, Q314 and Q411 also showed potent neutralization against live EBOV virus ( Fig. 1c and Table 2 ). In particular, Q206 and Q411 had similar IC 50 concentrations in the presence or absence of complement suggesting their neutralizing activity is largely independent of complement. In contrast, Q314, like the mAb c13C6 control, required the presence of complement for optimal neutralization although significantly higher neutralization activity was found (Fig. 1c ).",

            "text": "Kinetics and competitive binding of isolated mAbs measured by SPR. The observed differences in neutralizing activity against pseudo and live Ebola virus could be due to their differences in binding affinity and epitopes recognized. To test this hypothesis, we measured the binding kinetics of Q206, Q314, and Q411 antigen-binding fragment (Fab) to the recombinant GPdM, sGP, or GPcl by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). As shown in Fig. 2 , the differential binding to these recombinant proteins is consistent with those analyzed by ELISA (Fig. 1a) . Furthermore, the estimated binding affinity to GPdM appeared to correlate with their neutralizing activity (Table 3 ). Q206 demonstrated the strongest binding affinity (K d = 16.1 nM) while Q411 was intermediate (K d = 24.0 nM) and Q314 was the weakest (K d = 44.8 nM). Consistent with earlier report 49 , KZ52 demonstrated a higher binding affinity (K d = 3.4 nM) than the 3 mAbs we isolated, hence also showing stronger neutralizing activity. However, c13C6 was an outlier perhaps due to its unique and unusual neutralization curve in that its inhibitory activity appeared early at the relatively lower concentration and then plateaued prematurely about 70% despite increases in concentration (Fig. 1b) . In contrast, binding affinity to sGP didn't seem to follow their trend in neutralization. Q314, the weakest neutralizing mAb isolated, showed the highest affinity (K d = 6.3 nM) to sGP while Q206 demonstrated the intermediate (K d = 7.1 nM) and Q411 was the weakest (K d = 13.5 nM). Interestingly, removal of the glycan cap from GPdM by thermolysin (GPcl) dramatically increased the binding of Q206 (from K d = 16.1 to 7.1 nM) while having no effect on Q411 (from K d = 24.0 to 24.0 nM) ( Table 3) . These results highlight the binding affinity to membrane associated (GPdM and GPcl) but not secreted (sGP) form of GP may contribute to the differential neutralizing activity among the isolated mAbs. In particular, as EBOV entry requires cleavage of envelope glycoprotein in the endosome 13, 15 , more favorable binding of Q206 to GPcl over GPdM suggests a possible enhanced inhibitory effect by this mAb during the process of viral entry.",

To further determine the epitopes in a more precise manner, negative stain single-particle EM reconstructions were performed with GPdM in complex with Fab of Q206, Q314 or Q411. Each Fab was added in excess to GPdM, purified by size-exclusion chromatography and then subjected to staining and EM analyses (Fig. 4 , supplementary Fig. 3 and supplementary Table 1 ). The structures of Q206-and Q411-GPdM complexes showed that the antibodies bound to novel epitopes within the center of the GPdM chalice, perpendicularly to the expected plane of the membrane and making contacts with a region spanning the glycan cap (cyan) and the head (blue) subdomains of GP1 subunit ( Fig. 4a and supplementary Fig. 3 ). Q314, on the other hand, bound in the vicinity of the glycan cap with an angle of approach much less steep than that of Q206 and Q411 ( Fig. 4a and supplementary  Fig. 3) . To compare the binding sites of Q206, Q314 and Q411 to those of c13C6 and KZ52, we generated a hybrid map based on the structure information obtained here and previously published elsewhere 29 . As shown in Fig 4b, the binding sites for Q206 and Q411 are located next to that of c13C6 but closer to the inner chalice of the GP1 subunit. On the contrary, the Q314 binding sites are located to the opposite side of c13C6 in the glycan cap orientated towards the upper surface of the chalice (Fig. 4b) . As shown previously, the control KZ52 bound the base of GPdM 14, 29 . These results are consistent with those from the epitope mapping studies conducted above and provided a clear three dimensional understanding of the location and distribution of epitopes recognized by Q206, Q314 and Q411 on the GP1 subunit.",

Next, we studied whether reduction in binding could confer resistance to mAb neutralization in the context of pseudovirus. To this end, the pseudoviruses bearing the representative mutations were generated and subjected to standard neutralization test (Fig. 5) . Consistent with the binding analysis, T144A and F225A mutations in the head resulted in complete resistance to Q206 and Q411 neutralization with at least 100-fold increase in IC 50 compared to the wild type. Similarly, W275A mutation in the glycan cap and Q508A, N550A and D552A in GP2 subunit also rendered pseudovirus completely resistant to Q314 and c13C6 as well as KZ52, respectively. It needs to be noted that the same set of mutations had some noticeable cross-effect on neutralization activity of other mAbs, but all limited within the 10-fold differences from the wild type and most likely due to the indirect consequences (Fig. 5b) . But nevertheless, these results confirm that Q206 and Q411 bind to a novel epitope located between the glycan cap and the head subdomain approaching to RBD in the inner chalice of GP1. Q314, on the other hand, binds to an overlapping epitope with c13C6 in the glycan cap but more towards the upper surface of the chalice.",

To determine potential steps of inhibition, we applied the testing mAbs to pseudoviruses and target Vero-E6 cells in two separate time scales. One was to incubate with pseudoviruses first at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h before virus attachment to Vero-E6 cells. The other was allow virus attachment to Vero-E6 cells first at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h before adding the testing mAbs and elevating temperature to 37 \u00b0C to initiate the virus entry. We reasoned that if the testing mAb inhibited virus attachment to the cell surface, the reduction in luciferase activity would only be detectable in the former experiment. On the other hand, if the testing mAb inhibited the steps after virus attachment, the reduction in luciferase activity would be detectable in both cases. As shown in Fig. 6a , Q206, Q314 and Q411 were all able to reduce luciferase activity more than 90% in both cases, suggesting they inhibited steps after virus attachment. Consistent with earlier reports, the positive control KZ52 also inhibited post-attachment steps while the negative control VRC01 failed in both cases (Fig. 6a) .",

Domain C of NPC1 (NPC1-C) was then injected to compare the binding kinetics with or without the testing mAbs. As shown in Fig 6b, Protective efficacy in mouse model of EBOV infection. To determine the protective efficacy of isolated mAbs in vivo, we infected mice through intraperitoneal injection (IP) with a dose of 1000 \u00d7 LD 50 mouse-adapted EBOV and administered Q206, Q314 or Q411 at either 1 or 2 days post infection. All control animals, which received only PBS, succumbed to the virus with an average time of death of 7.4 \u00b1 3.1 days.

            "text": "This study aimed to identify neutralizing mAbs targeting additional sites on the GP of Ebola virus identified in 2014 1 . Through sequential immunization of Chinese rhesus macaques with recombinant GPdM and antigen-specific single B cell sorting, we have successfully isolated and characterized three mAbs (Q206, Q314 and Q411) with potent neutralizing activities against pseudo and live EBOV. Epitope mapping through differential binding, single-particle EM reconstructions and site-directed mutagenesis have revealed that Q206 and Q411 bind to novel and overlapping epitopes spanning the glycan cap and the head subdomain approaching to the RBD in the inner chalice of GP1. Q314, on the other hand, binds to an overlapping epitope with c13C6 in the glycan cap but orientated towards the upper surface of the chalice. In distinct contrast to c13C6 and other mAbs binding to the similar or adjacent epitopes, the newly isolated mAbs are completely or partially independent of complement in live EBOV neutralization. In particular, all these novel mAbs are able to achieve close to 100% inhibition of live EBOV in the presence of complement while c13C6 plateaued just above 50% inhibition. Furthermore, treatment with these mAbs provided partial but significant protection against disease progression in a mouse model of EBOV infection. Collectively, these results suggest that Q206 and Q411 recognize novel epitopes in the Table 4 . Impact of mutant residues on mAb binding to surface expressed GPdMuc. * \"+ \" indicates at least 50% reduction in fluorescent intensity compared to the wild type and \"\u2212 \" indicates complete abolish of antibody binding. GP1 with potent neutralizing activity and could serve as promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against Ebola virus infection. We believe that the neutralizing mAbs identified here represent a new arsenal against EBOV infection. The most potent and protective mAbs, Q206 and Q411, recognize overlapping epitopes within the core of GP1, a region that encompasses the RBD and the base of GP1 14, 29, 32 . While previous studies suggested that this region may be concealed before proteolysis by endosomal cathepsins and receptor binding 15, 29, 53 , the binding as well as neutralizing profile of Q206 and Q411 indicated this region contains opening spots for antibody binding and neutralization at the early steps during viral entry. While the exact underlying mechanism requires further investigation, it appeared that Q206 and Q411 exert their neutralization activity through interfering with GP binding to its receptor NPC-1 which may lead to affecting the subsequent fusion between viral and cellular membrane. This hypothesis is further supported by the mutagenesis study where mutant virus with T144, a residue located at the edge of RBD critical for NPC-1 binding 54 , became resistant to Q206 and Q411 (Fig. 5 and Table 4 ). For Q314, however, the mechanism of action is far less clear. Despite of its overlapping epitope with c13C6, Q314 protective activity in the mouse model is much less effective 31 , perhaps due to the differences in exact epitope, the The testing mAb were applied to pseudovirus and Vero-E6 cells before or after attachment and (b) Competitive binding of the testing mAbs with NPC1-C to immobilized GPcl on a chip. The blocking efficacy was determined as 12.9% for Q206, 3.9% for Q314, 14.9% for Q411, and 72.7% for control mAb 114, respectively. affinity, the approaching angle or the Fc-mediated functions of the antibody to the GP. Of note, it is important to recognize that neutralizing activity does not always translate into protective activity in mouse model and mouse model can't always predict the monkey model. The ultimate test will have to be conducted in human before any meaningful protective activity could be evaluated and determined. In any case, it would be interesting to study whether the combination of our newly isolated mAbs could have any synergistic effect to provide stronger and broader neutralizing and protective activities against wild-type and mutant EBOV 14, [22] [23] [24] [25] [33] [34] [35] [36] 49 . Although the current dataset for EBOV shows a limited degree of sequence variation, this is by no means to suggest the virus will remain unchanged in the long run given their wide spread in several animal species, continuing zoonotic introductions into and rapid transmission within human population 7, 8, 12, 50, [55] [56] [57] . With the potent neutralizing mAbs identified here and their novel epitope specificities, we are at more advantageous position to generate and optimize next-generation of therapeutic antibody cocktail against EBOV infection.",

After blocking with 1% BSA, serial dilutions of purified antibodies were added and the bound antibodies were detected by anti-human immunoglobulin G (IgG)-horseradish peroxidase (Promega) and TMB (3, 3\u2032, 5\u2032, 5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine) substrate (CWBio). Absorbance was measured at 450 nm with background blank measured at 620 nm. For cell surface binding analysis, the expressing vector pcDNA3.1 encoding the gene of EBOV GPdMuc with the deletion of MLD (Mayinga strain) was transfected into 293T cells. Approximately forty hours later, the transfected cells were harvested, trypsinized, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with a serial dilution of testing and control mAbs, detected by the anti-human IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).",

Once confirmed by sequencing, the expressing vectors encoding the wild type and mutant clones were transfected into 293T cells and analyzed for the binding of Q206, Q314 and Q411 as well as c13C6 and KZ52 by FACS. Nine out of the 23 clones had profound impact on the binding activity of the mAbs. T144A and F225A mutations in the head, for instance, either completely abolished or significantly reduced the binding of Q206 and Q411. Mutant T144A also demonstrated significant reduction to Q314 binding. In addition, mutations in the glycan cap (E231A, T270A and W275A) had biased effect towards Q314 and c13C6. For example, both E231A and W275 mutants either abolished or significantly reduced the binding by Q314 and c13C6 while E231A also demonstrated negative effect on binding by Q206, Q411 and KZ52. T270A mutant, previously shown to affect c13C6 binding, resulted in the similar effect in our assay32 . Lastly, consistent with previous reports",
