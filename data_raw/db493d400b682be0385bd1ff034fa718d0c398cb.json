Among 4,326 live births between 1 June 2004 and 30 September 2006, maternal influenza vaccine information was available for 4,168 (96.3%). The primary intervention evaluated in this study was receipt of influenza vaccine during any trimester of pregnancy. The main outcome measures were prematurity (gestational age at birth ,37 wk) and SGA (birth weight ,10th percentile for gestational age). Infants who were born during the putative influenza season (1 October-31 May) and whose mothers were vaccinated against influenza during pregnancy were less likely to be premature compared to infants of unvaccinated mothers born in the same period (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38-0.94). The magnitude of association between maternal influenza vaccine receipt and reduced likelihood of prematurity increased during the period of at least local influenza activity (adjusted OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.73) and was greatest during the widespread influenza activity period (adjusted OR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11-0.74). Compared with newborns of unvaccinated women, newborns of vaccinated mothers had 69% lower odds of being SGA (adjusted OR = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13-0.75) during the period of widespread influenza activity. The adjusted and unadjusted ORs were not significant for the pre-influenza activity period.",

Since there is evidence of adverse fetal/newborn outcomes after infection during pregnancy [5, 6] , including influenza infection [2] , it is plausible that influenza vaccination in pregnancy could mitigate adverse birth outcomes such as prematurity and small for gestational age (SGA) births. The potential impact of maternal influenza immunization on birth outcomes could have important public health implications for developed as well as developing countries and may be of particular interest during influenza pandemics.",

CSTE reports assess the spread of influenza within each state for each week based on lab-confirmed and syndromic data [10] . The influenza activity is considered local if there are influenza outbreaks or an increase in cases of influenza-like illness in a single region of the state along with recent identification of laboratory-confirmed influenza from that region. In the case of influenza outbreaks or increases in influenza-like illness with recent laboratory-confirmed influenza in at least two but fewer than half the regions of the state, the influenza activity level is considered to be regional. If the influenza outbreaks or increased numbers of influenza-like illness cases (plus laboratory-confirmed cases) are reported in at least half of the regions of the state, the influenza activity is considered to be widespread ( Figure 1 ). We defined the pre-influenza period as the period between the start of the putative influenza season (October 1) and the beginning of local influenza activity (per CSTE reports). The pre-influenza period is characterized by the availability of the vaccine and the absence of influenza activity ( Figure 1 ). The definition for the pre-influenza period was similar to the one used by other authors [11, 12] .",

One approach to account for confounding is to choose a period when the vaccine was available but the influenza virus was not circulating as the ''control'' pre-influenza period [11, 12] . In the pre-influenza period, there should be no vaccine effect, and observed effects during this period are assumed to be due to confounding. Therefore, as our primary strategy for confounder adjustment, we identified a group of covariates that would move the odds ratios (ORs) of association between maternal influenza immunization and birth outcomes during the pre-influenza period to 1.0 (i.e., no effect), hence arriving at a set of covariates that could effectively control for confounding due to the differences between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated women in analyses of all influenza activity periods. We selected covariates for the separate multivariate models for each of the birth outcomes (i.e., prematurity and SGA) using a modified version of the approach described by Jackson et al. [11] and Nelson et al. [12] . Briefly, variables for each birth outcome were evaluated for potential confounding by selecting the covariates that, in bivariate models, modified the association between maternal influenza vaccine and the birth outcome and moved the OR towards 1. From this initial group of variables, we arrived at a parsimonious model by sequentially dropping each covariate and observing a change in OR of the association between maternal immunization and the birth outcome. We excluded the variable whose removal moved the OR the most towards 1. If dropping a covariate resulted in moving ORs away from 1 and a change in magnitude of less than 1%, we removed the covariate that caused the least change and then repeated the process. If the change was more than 1%, we considered the current set of covariates as the smallest group of variables required to account for confounding.",

However, most observational studies where significant confounding has been documented were conducted in the elderly and included a relatively nonspecific end point of all-cause mortality. It is reasonable to assume that, compared to older individuals, women of reproductive age may be less likely to have significant functional limitation even in the presence of co-morbidities. Therefore, influenza vaccine studies in this age group may be less likely to suffer from bias due to the healthy user effect. Moreover, we found no statistically significant difference between the vaccinated women and the unvaccinated women in terms of gestational age at which they sought antenatal care. On the other hand, the possibility of other confounders cannot be discounted in studies involving pregnant women. In order to address confounding, we used the pre-influenza period (i.e., the season where vaccine was available but there was minimal circulation of influenza virus) as the ''control'' period. The use of the pre-influenza period for selecting confounders from a broad set of covariates is an approach suggested by Nelson et al. [12] and Jackson et al. [11] that takes advantage of the seasonality of influenza circulation. The associations observed in our study were robust to adjustment for confounders identified using this approach (and the more traditional approach)-supporting the validity of our findings. Influenza virus, particularly seasonal influenza virus, rarely crosses the placenta [3, 17, 18] . However, the effect of infection on prematurity is thought be at least partially mediated through inflammatory pathways [5, 6] . Increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a) and reduction in antiinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10) have been linked to preterm labor [6, 19, 20] . IL-1 stimulates the amnion and the decidua to produce prostaglandins and can stimulate myometrial contractions [20] . Prostaglandins are known to play an important role in the initiation and progression of labor [21] . Moreover, in animal models, administration of IL-1 results in preterm birth [20] . Similarly, TNF-a induces the amnion, the decidua, and the myometrium to produce prostaglandins, and administration of TNF-a to pregnant animals can induce preterm labor [19, 22] . Recent studies have shown that influenza virus infection induces gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, interferon (IFN)-b, IFN-a, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) [19] .",

Moreover, in the vaccinated group, the birth weight distribution in the pre-influenza period was different from the distribution in the period of widespread activity (see Text S1). However, the difference in mean birth weights (in the vaccinated group) between these two periods was not statistically significant (p = 0.74). Since the ostensible increase in birth weight in the widespread activity period compared to the pre-influenza period in the vaccinated group cannot easily be explained by vaccine action, this difference-although non-significant-may suggest confounding vis-\u00e0-vis the birth weight outcome.",

Maternal infections during pregnancy can have harmful effects on both mother and baby. For example, influenza is associated with increased morbidity and mortality among pregnant women compared to women who are not pregnant or who acquire influenza infection after delivery. And some respiratory infections, especially those that can cause maternal pneumonia such as influenza virus, are known to be associated with the baby being small-below the 10th percentile-for gestational age and with an increased risk of preterm birth-birth before 37 weeks of gestation. Previous studies have shown that inactivated influenza vaccination during pregnancy provides protection against influenza virus for both mother and baby. As there has been an increase in the rate of preterm birth the United States from 9.5% in 1981 to 12.8% in 2006, the impact of maternal influenza immunization on birth outcomes has important public health implications and is of particular interest during influenza pandemics.",

The researchers conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of a large surveillance dataset (the Georgia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System) to analyze the relationship between receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine during any trimester of pregnancy by mothers of infants born between June 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006 , and their baby being premature or small for gestational age. The study period encompassed the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 influenza seasons-the two most recent seasons for which the data were available. The researchers did a stratified analysis for the overall study period, and various periods during it, and also weighted their analysis to adjust for possible oversampling. They used logistic regression to evaluate the association of maternal influenza vaccine and (a) prematurity and (b) small for gestational age, and also used linear regression to evaluate the statistical significance of differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated women for mean gestational age at first antenatal visit and mean birth weight. During the study period, 4,168 mother-baby pairs were included in the analysis. Local influenza activity was detected during 27 weeks (22.1%), and 578 women (14.9% [weighted]) had received the influenza vaccine during pregnancy, giving a vaccination coverage of 19.2% (weighted) among mothers of infants born during the assumed influenza season. In the study sample, 1,547 babies (10.6% [weighted]) were born premature, and 1,186 babies (11.2% [weighted]) were small for gestational age. Infants who were born during the assumed influenza season (October-May) and whose mothers were vaccinated against influenza during pregnancy were less likely to be premature than infants of unvaccinated mothers born in the same period, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.60. The effect of maternal influenza vaccine on reducing prematurity was the highest for infants born during the period of widespread influenza activity, with 72% lower odds of prematurity in infants of vaccinated mothers than infants of unvaccinated mothers. Compared with newborns of unvaccinated women, babies of vaccinated mothers also had 69% lower odds of being small for gestational age during the period of widespread influenza activity, but the adjusted and unadjusted odd ratios were not significant for the pre-influenza activity period.",

These results show that there was an association between maternal immunization with the inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy and reduced likelihood of prematurity during local, regional, and widespread influenza activity periods. In addition, during the period of widespread influenza activity there was an negative association between maternal receipt of influenza vaccine and small for gestational age birth. ",
