Inhibition of ACE has been shown to improve pathology in cardiovascular disease, whilst ACE2 is cardioprotective in the failing heart. However, the mechanisms by which ACE2 mediates its cardioprotective functions have yet to be fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that both ACE and ACE2 bind integrin subunits, in an RGD-independent manner, and that they can act as cell adhesion substrates. We show that cellular expression of ACE2 enhanced cell adhesion. Furthermore, we present evidence that soluble ACE2 (sACE2) is capable of suppressing integrin signalling mediated by FAK. In addition, sACE2 increases the expression of Akt, thereby lowering the proportion of the signalling molecule phosphorylated Akt. These results suggest that ACE2 plays a role in cellcell interactions, possibly acting to fine-tune integrin signalling. Hence the expression and cleavage of ACE2 at the plasma membrane may influence cell-extracellular matrix interactions and the signalling that mediates cell survival and proliferation. As such, ectodomain shedding of ACE2 may play a role in the process of pathological cardiac remodelling.",

            "text": "Heart failure is characterised as a decline in cardiac contractility, which is associated with structural changes, collectively termed cardiac remodelling. Cardiac myofibroblasts are key mediators of cardiac remodelling via their proliferation, invasion and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins. Angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulates cardiac myofibroblast transdifferentiation leading to fibrosis. Ang II also stimulates proliferation [1] , NADPH oxidase activation [2] (and thereby reactive oxygen species production), the production of proinflammatory cytokines [3] and the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [4] . As a result, Ang II is a major contributor to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases. Ang II is generated from the biologically inert peptide, Ang I, by the catalytic action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), a key proteolytic step in the renin angiotensin system (RAS). Aberrant functioning of the RAS is a feature of a variety of cardiovascular, renal and other pathologies and ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor 1 (AT1R) antagonists are widely used in the clinic. Accordingly, ACE inhibition has been shown to prevent cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction (MI) and preserves cardiac function [5, 6] . A combination of ACE inhibitors and AT1R blockers has been shown to be more effective than either alone [7] . A decade ago a new member of this system was identified, termed angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [8, 9] . ACE2 acts to hydrolyse Ang II into the vasodilator Ang-(1-7), thereby contributing to reductions in blood pressure. Current models of the RAS are based on the concept that the two enzymes counterbalance each other.",

Mortality was associated with enhanced adverse ventricular remodelling following MI [10] , a state which was reversed by the use of an AT1R blocker and as such the pathology of ACE2 deletion was attributed to the increased levels of Ang II [10] . A mounting body of evidence is forming in support of a cardioprotective role for ACE2, through the metabolism of Ang II [10, 11] , but also through the direct action of Ang-(1-7) via its own receptor, Mas [12] . Like Ang II the actions of Ang-(1-7) extend beyond vasopressor control, and for the most part appear to counteract the effects of Ang II and therefore mediate cardioprotection [13] . Ang-(1-7) reduces interstitial fibrosis [14] , myocyte hypertrophy [15] and inhibits myocyte cell growth [16] . The reduction in myocyte hypertrophy resulting from expression of Ang-(1-7) was associated with a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and IL-6) and also a reduction in exogenous ACE transcript [17] .",

Hence, the ectodomain of ACE2 may have a role in cardiac remodelling independent of its catalytic activity. Here we show that both angiotensin converting enzymes bind ITGB1 and integrin a5 (ITGA5) in vitro. The data presented provide evidence that the enzymes provide a substrate for cellular adhesion and that the interaction between ACE2 and an integrin increases cellular adhesion when both are present on the cell membrane.

Using primary cardiac myofibroblasts we have demonstrated that the actions of ACE and ACE2 exerted on cell models are physiologically relevant to the diseased human heart.",

            "text": "Both ACE and ACE2 are increased in the failing heart [18] [19] [20] . ACE2 expression has consistently been seen to be up-regulated in the peri-infarct area after MI [10, 20, 33] and in end stage heart failure [34] indicative of a role in injury. Knockout of the ace2 gene increases MMP2 and MMP9 levels in the peri-infarct region of mice, resulting in disruption of the extracellular matrix and enhanced adverse remodelling [10] . ACE2 over-expression has been shown to inhibit collagen production in response to hypoxic injury [35] . Moreover, activation of remodelling pathways has been demonstrated in ace2 knockout animals in the absence of an increase in Ang II [36] . Cardiac remodelling is a key pathological process in the development of heart failure. Integrins play a key role in this process by mediating cell-ECM interactions and cellular signalling. ITGB1 has also been implicated in myocardial dysfunction [28] . An association between ITGB1 and ACE2 has previously been reported in the failing heart and attributed to the presence of an RGD motif in ACE2 [25] . We have established that both ACE and ACE2 binds ITGB1 and also its common cardiac binding partner, ITGA5 [37] , as well as the RGD-independent and liver rich ITGA2 [38] . However, in contrast to the study of Lin et al. [25] our data clearly suggest that these interactions occur independently of an RGD motif. 3-dimensional modelling has demonstrated that the RGD motif present in the ectodomain of ACE2 is inaccessible, which explains its redundancy in integrin binding. The aspartate residue is positioned facing the active site cleft of the protein and as such is not available to bind into the integrin binding pocket [39] . Given the structural homology between the two proteins, it is not surprising that ACE is also capable of binding integrins as the interaction appears to be independent of the RGD sequence, which is lacking in ACE.",

The ability of prothrombin to bind integrin avb3 is key to its biological activity in the fibrotic cascade [40] . As in ACE2, the carboxylate group of the Asp of the RGD motif is directed towards the specificity pocket of the enzyme [41] . In its native state prothrombin does not exert strong adhesive properties. However, proteolytic maturation exposes the RGD motif and thereby enhances the adhesive properties of thrombin [42] . This mechanism is unlikely to occur in ACE2 which, when present on the cell membrane, is in its mature form (unlike thrombin it does not occur in an inactive proenzyme form during biosynthesis). What is more, any rearrangement of the active site of ACE2 is likely to inhibit its catalytic activity; sACE2 is catalytically active.",

What is more, the presence of ACE2 on the cell surface partially removed the requirement of RGDinteractions for cellular adhesion. Fibroblast motility is a key process in the development of scar tissue and thus cellular adhesion is an important homeostatic mechanism. In order to study the role of ACE and ACE2 in the remodelling response, primary cardiac myofibroblasts were used as a disease model. These cells play a key role in the maintenance of cardiac architecture under conditions of injury, by forming scar tissue through their ability to proliferate and adhere [47] . We demonstrate that both ACE and ACE2 exert comparable effects over myofibroblast adhesion, but that again this effect is not mediated through an RGD motif. Recent clinical investigations have highlighted that elevated levels of sACE2 in patient plasma correlated with increased myocardial dysfunction [29] and vascular compliactions in type 1 diabetes [48] . We have shown that both ACE and ACE2 interact with the cell surface in adhesion assays and, furthermore, ACE2, in particular, enhances cell adhesion and may modulate integrin signalling. Cellular retention of ACE2 is therefore required for its role as a cellular anchor and, as such, the cleavage of ACE2 by ADAM17 [49] may be a pathological step in the development of heart failure. The Figure 2 . Both angiotensin converting enzymes bind integrins independent of an RGD motif. A) Immunoprecipitation of ITGB1 with tACE in HEK-tACE cells. HEK cell lysates were incubated with ITGB1 antibody and eluted using protein G. Immunoblotting for ACE was performed with anti-ACE mC5 antibody. This interaction was similar to that between ACE2 and ITGB1 in ACE2 over-expressing cells. B) Immunoprecipitation of ITGB1 and ITGA5 with tACE in SHSY5Y cells over-expressing the testicular form of ACE. Immunoprecipitation was performed as before. C) Immunoprecipitation of ACE2 with ITGB1 in the presence of a RGD peptide. Huh7 cells were pre-incubated and crosslinked using DTBP, in the presence or absence of RGD peptide before lysis and immunoprecipitation as before.

Cell monolayers were cross-linked using DTBP before lysis and immunoprecipitation as before. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034747.g002 retention of ACE2 on the cell membrane is known to be regulated by cell signalling [24] and viral infection [50] .

            "text": "FAK is a critical signalling component associated with areas of substratum adhesion; signalling via FAK is mediated through autophosphorylation of Tyr 397 [51] . We demonstrate that sACE2, at levels comparable to those reported in human plasma, significantly reduces FAK phosphorylation levels. Furthermore, we show that treatment with sACE2 increases the levels of Akt expression, a pro-survival, pro-proliferative protein. Changes in the level of phosphorylated Akt were also seen in response to sACE2; however, these were accounted for by the increase in the amount of total Akt. As such, signalling by Akt was not transmitted to its downstream effector NF-kB. sACE2 has no known function. We do not dismiss the possibility that this circulating ACE2 may bind integrins, when released from the plasma membrane, and elicit autocrine or paracrine signalling. In fact, one of the shed forms of the amyloid precursor protein, sAPPa, binds to ITGB1 and signals to enhance axon outgrowth [52] . What is more, cellular expression of full length APP inhibits axonal outgrowth and an excess of the shed form overcomes this inhibition [52] . We therefore propose some of the anti-proliferative actions of ACE2 may in part be mediated through a non-catalytic interaction with integrins, rather than by metabolism of Ang II per se. These data suggest that ACE2, through its integrin binding abilities, may have regulatory roles in cellular attachment and support a novel mechanism of integrin activation upon ACE2 shedding.",

The investigation conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, 1997. Primary cultures of cardiac fibroblasts were harvested, characterized as myofibroblasts co-expression of smooth muscle a-actin and vimentin and cultured as described previously [58] . Experiments were performed on cells from different patients at passages 2-5 [59] . Cell images were taken on a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope using a Nikon COOLPIX 4500 4.0 megapixel camera. Recombinant ACE2 purification HEK cells stably expressing a FLAG-tagged ACE2 ectodomain (sACE2) were created. HEK cells were transfected with plasmid DNA (pCl-neo containing nucleotides 104-2323 of ACE2 cDNA with the FLAG peptide conjugated to the C-terminus). Successfully transfected cells were selected by passage in media containing G418 (1 mg/ml). sACE2 was collected from the conditioned media of these cells and purified by affinity chromatography using an anti-FLAG M2-agarose column and eluted into tubes containing 25 ml 1M Tris pH 8.0 by addition of 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.5. Eluted fractions were analysed for ACE2 activity by fluorometric assay [24] and purity was checked by silver stain, using SilverXpress (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's instructions, and then immunoblotted for ACE2.",
