We designed a longitudinal study to examine influenza-(flu-) specific immune responses and the association between pre-existing flu responses, symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI), impact of pandemic flu infection, and pandemic flu vaccination in a cohort of 2,040 individuals in Sweden in 2009-2010.",

In contrast, individuals with pandemic flu infection (PCR positive) exhibited increased flu-specific T-cell responses shortly after onset of ILI symptoms but the immune response decreased after the flu season (spring 2010). We identified non-pandemic-flu vaccinated participants without ILI symptoms who showed an IFN-\u03b3 production profile similar to pandemic-flu infected participants, suggesting exposure without experiencing clinical symptoms.",

As the virus spread globally, it became evident that the infection was of moderate severity with a broad clinical spectrum of symptoms [2] . Early data from Mexico suggested that pdmH1N1 may cause severe respiratory illness in otherwise healthy young and middle-aged people [3] . It is now estimated that in the United States pdmH1N1 caused higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths in children and adults 18-64 years of age than the flu of the previous season, but lower rates of clinical events in adults over 65 years of age [4] . This finding supports the notion that previous exposures to H1N1 in older individuals provides higher cross-protective immune responses than in younger individuals [5] . In the autumn of 2009, pdmH1N1 vaccines (pdm vaccines) were available across the globe, it was estimated that pdmH1N1 vaccination prevented 4,000-10,000 hospitalizations and 200-500 deaths in the US [6] .",

            "text": "There are several unanswered questions concerning H1N1 flu infection and vaccination. Firstly, the impact of previous immune responses induced by flu vaccinations or by flu exposures on the ability to mount new anti-flu immune responses [7] [8] [9] . It is therefore of interest to map the adaptive humoral and cellular immune response prior to vaccination and prior to the onset of flu symptoms. Secondly, the differential quality and quantity of humoral and cellular immune responses directed against flu targets, induced either by flu vaccination or by flu infection, has not been well defined. Thirdly, several reports have discussed a 'silent infection' with H1N1 (in non-vaccinated participants), yet the real extent of such a silent infection is difficult to determinein part due to cross-reacting antibodies (Abs) (from previous exposures or vaccines) [10] . Antibodies, as well as CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell immune responses, play a critical role in the host defense against flu [11, 12] . Increased cellular reactivity to flu, defined by IFN-\u03b3 production-a key cytokine in the pro-inflammatory response to flu-in participants who have not experienced influenza-like (ILI) symptoms, has not been determined up to now, this may help to identify silent flu infection.",

Participants contacted the LG centres at the onset of ILI symptoms, filled out a questionnaire and mailed the (viral) swab for PCR analysis as described in detail in the supplementary data sets. If swabs tested positive for flu or coronavirus RNA, a home visit was payed during which an additional nasal swab and a blood sample from the index study participant and the household members was obtained. (The mean time between the first swab and the home visit was 2.5 weeks). The study was approved by the Ethics committee Stockholm south review board (DN 2009/1183-31) and each study participant provided informed consent.

The whole-blood antigen (WBA) stimulation assay measures the 'net' IFN-\u03b3 production elaborated by CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in whole blood and reflects the activity of memory T-cell responses. We tested several flu antigens from previous monovalent flu vaccines, composed of haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (N) from flu A or B strains, for the capacity to elicit IFN-\u03b3 responses in They were used at a final concentration of 2.5 \u03bcg/mL HA. We also tested the flu matrix antigens M1 and M2 present as peptides, and used at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/mL. As control, we used the CFP-10 antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We could not include the A/H1N1/California/ 7/2009 antigens in the cellular assays, since the test plates had to be prepared in advance due to quality control issues to ensure batch-to-batch consistency; the pdmH1N1 antigen preparation was not yet available in the summer of 2009 and the assay worked only with freshly obtained heparinised blood.

This step was taken to link ILI symptoms with the detection of defined viral pathogens.

We tested M1 and M2 as targets for cellular immune responses in the current study. The M2 protein is a proton-selective ion channel protein, integral in the viral envelope of the influenza A virus. M2 brings protons into the virion core. Acidification of virus interior, leads to weakening of electrostatic interaction and leads to dissociation between M1 (matrix protein) and viral rib nucleoprotein (RNP) complexes [17] . Traces of M1 in the split vaccine may be responsible for the strong anti-M1 directed responses defined by IFN-\u03b3 production, which has not been reported until now. Flu vaccines are produced and standardised based on their haemagglutinin and neuraminidase content, and traces of the M1 proteins, contained in the current standard vaccines, may in part be responsible for conferring protective immune responses between flu A strains, since the M1 protein is quite conserved [18] . The M1-directed cellular immune responses, along with traces of M1 proteins in split vaccines may in part responsible for the cross-reactive immune responses against H5N1 associated with the pdm flu vaccine, since CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses directed against H5N1 have preferentially reported to focus on M1 or NP (nucleoproteins) [19] . The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was used to calculate the p-values (difference between time point A and B).

The report by Skowronski and co-workers also suggested an association between the previous 2008-2009 flu vaccination and pandemic H1N1 illness in Canada [23] ; the mechanisms underlying this finding are ill-defined and warrant further research to better understand the impact of seasonal flu vaccination, i.e. the potential 'negative imprint' of previous vaccinations on cellular immune memory responses.",

One of the arguments is that flu vaccination may not protect against ILI symptoms during flu the season. This notion was corroborated in our study. A number of study participants, after pdm flu vaccination, experienced more ILI symptoms, perhaps due to the observed increase in prevalence of rhinovirus infection in pdm flu vaccinated participants as compared to nonpdm flu vaccinated participants. Other reasons may account for these observations, one of them being the low predictive value of the ILI case definition [26] . Future prospective studies may address the question whether certain flu vaccines are able to increase cellular immune responses in the respiratory system, particularly after encounter with the wildtype flu. Increased 'influenza-like' symptoms may occur upon exposure to additional pathogens, such as rhino-or coronavirus, that stimulate 'flu-primed' innate or adaptive immune responses. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that infection with rhinovirus may have delayed the circulation of H1N1, most likely via activation of non-specific innate immune responses in the respiratory system [27] .",

This immune status could not be observed in participants who reported no ILI symptoms, irrespective of whether or not they received the pmd flu vaccination. This suggests that some pmd flu vaccinated participants who reported ILI symptoms may have been exposed to the H3N2 seasonal flu supporting previous observations that pmd flu vaccination did not affect the rate of H3N2 infections [28] . The pdmH1N1 strain dominated the flu season in Sweden in 2009-2010, but flu H3N2 and flu B were also present in 1.7% and 1.4% of the samples analysed by the Swedish National Influenza Centre [29] .",

This notion was indeed corroborated: we showed that shortly after a positive pdmH1N1 PCR, IFN-\u03b3 production to most of the flu antigens was significantly increased, yet declined by the end of the study (May 2010). In contrast, we could detect significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 production in response to M1 (which is not a designated vaccine component) at the end of the study in pdm flu vaccinated participants; this was not the case for study participants who tested positive for pdmH1N1 by PCR (Table 6) .",

M1 responses are currently discussed to be crucial in mediating protective anti-flu directed immune responses [30] and may therefore become an important component of future vaccines. The prospective study layout of the LifeGene ILI cohort also demonstrates the value of a time point zero sample to gauge the immune response prior to a vaccination or exposure: pre-existing humoral and cellular immune responses shape the nature of the immune response associated with immune protection or immune pathology.",
