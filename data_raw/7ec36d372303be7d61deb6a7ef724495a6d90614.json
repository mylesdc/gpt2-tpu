However, little is known about host factors at the interface between replicase complexes and the host cytoplasm. We engineered a biotin ligase into a coronaviral replication/transcription complex (RTC) and identified >500 host proteins constituting the RTC microenvironment. siRNA-silencing of each RTC-proximal host factor demonstrated importance of vesicular trafficking pathways, ubiquitin-dependent and autophagyrelated processes, and translation initiation factors. Notably, detection of translation initiation factors at the RTC was instrumental to visualize and demonstrate active translation proximal to replication complexes of several coronaviruses. Collectively, we establish a spatial link between viral RNA synthesis and diverse host factors of unprecedented breadth. Our data may serve as a paradigm for other positive-strand RNA viruses and provide a starting point for a comprehensive analysis of critical virus-host interactions that represent targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Rewiring host endomembranes is hypothesized to provide a privileged microenvironment physically separated from the cytosol, thereby ensuring adequate concentrations of macromolecules for viral RNA synthesis, preventing recognition of replication intermediates such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by cytosolic innate immune receptors (Overby et al., 2010; Pfefferle et al., 2011) . Likewise, genome-wide CRISPR-based screens have been applied to other positive-stranded RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses, and identified critical host proteins required for replication (Marceau et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) . Some of these proteins were described in the context of distinct ER processes, such as N-linked glycosylation, ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), and signal peptide insertion and processing. Although individual proteins identified by these screens may interact with viral replication complexes, they likely constitute only a small fraction of the global replicase microenvironment.",

BirA R118G biotinylates proximal (<10 nm) proteins in live cells without disrupting intracellular membranes or protein complexes, and hence, does not rely on high-affinity protein-protein interactions but is also able to permanently tag transient interactions (Roux et al., 2012) . Covalent protein biotinylation allows stringent lysis and washing conditions during affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometric identification of captured factors. By engineering a recombinant MHV harboring BirA R118G as an integral component of the RTC, we identified >500 host proteins reflecting the molecular microenvironment of MHV replication structures. siRNA-mediated silencing of each of these factors highlighted, amongst others, the functional importance of vesicular ER-Golgi apparatus trafficking pathways, ubiquitin-dependent and autophagy-related catabolic processes, and translation initiation factors. Importantly, the detection of active translation in close proximity to the viral RTC highlighted the critical involvement of translation initiation factors during coronavirus replication. Collectively, the determination of the coronavirus RTC-associated microenvironment provides a functional and spatial link between conserved host cell processes and viral RNA synthesis, and highlights potential targets for the development of novel antiviral agents.",

MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2 retained the cleavage site between nsp1 and BirA R118G , while a deleted cleavage site between BirA R118G and nsp2 ensured the expression of a BirA R118G -nsp2 fusion protein ( Figure 1a ). This strategy was chosen because it was recently employed by Freeman et al. for a fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) with nsp2 and represents the only known site tolerating large insertions within the MHV replicase polyprotein (Freeman et al., 2014) . MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2 replicated to comparable peak titers and replication kinetics as the parental wild-type MHV-A59 ( Figure 1b) . MHV-GFP-nsp2, which was constructed in parallel and contained the coding sequence of EGFP (Freeman et al., 2014) instead of BirA R118G , was used as a control and also reached wild-type virus peak titers, with slightly reduced viral titers at 9 hr post-infection (h.p.i.) compared to MHV-A59 and MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2 ( Figure 1b) .",

To further confirm the accommodation of BirA R118G within the viral RTC, MHV-A59-, MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2-, and mock-infected L929 fibroblasts were visualized using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. BirA R118G -nsp2 remained strongly associated with the MHV RTC throughout the entire replication cycle, as indicated by the co-localization of BirA R118G -nsp2 with established markers of the MHV replicase, such as nsp2/3 and nsp8 ( Figure 1c , Figure 1 -figure supplement 2, Figure 1-figure supplement 3 ). This observation corroborates previous studies demonstrating that nsp2, although not required for viral RNA synthesis, co-localizes with other nsps of the coronaviral RTC (Schiller et al., 1998; Hagemeijer et al., 2010; Graham et al., 2005) . Importantly, by supplementing the culture medium with biotin, we could readily detect biotinylated proteins with fluorophore-coupled streptavidin that appeared close to the MHV RTC throughout the entire replication cycle in MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2-infected cells, ",

A characteristic pattern of endogenously biotinylated proteins was observed under all conditions where no exogenous biotin was added to the culture medium ( Figure 2b ). The same pattern was detectable in non-infected and wild-type MHV-A59-infected cells when the culture medium was supplemented with biotin, suggesting that the addition of biotin in the absence of the BirA R118G biotin ligase does not recognizably change the fraction of endogenously biotinylated proteins. In contrast, we observed a greatly increased fraction of biotinylated proteins in lysates derived from MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2-infected cells treated with biotin. This result demonstrates that virusmediated expression of the BirA R118G biotin ligase results in efficient biotinylation when biotin is added to the culture medium. Moreover, we could readily affinity purify, enrich, and recover the fraction of biotinylated proteins under stringent denaturing lysis and washing conditions by using streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads (Figure 2b) .",

Thirty-four factors, that are mainly involved in fatty acid b-oxidation biological processes in the mitochondrion, displayed significant enrichment in MHV-WT compared to MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2 infections ( Figure 2c ). Since the biotinylation of these factors is not caused by the BirA R118G biotin ligase, these factors were not considered for further investigation in the context of our RTC-proximal biotinylation proteomic screen. Importantly, besides the 513 host proteins that were enriched in MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2-infected cells, we noted that viral replicase gene products nsp2-10 and nsp12-16, and the nucleocapsid protein were also significantly enriched in fractions derived from MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2-infected cells, suggesting that they are all in close proximity to the BirA R118G -nsp2 fusion protein (Figure 2c , Figure 2d ). This is in agreement with studies demonstrating co-localization and interactions amongst individual nsps, and with studies showing association of the nucleocapsid protein with the coronavirus RTC Denison et al., 1999; Sims et al., 2000; van der Meer et al., 1999; Bost et al., 2001) . It also highlights the specificity and effectiveness of the labeling approach in live cells and is the first experimental evidence showing that collectively these viral nsps and the nucleocapsid (N) protein are subunits of the coronavirus RTC. Furthermore, these results corroborate previous reports that nsp1 is likely not an integral component of the coronavirus RTC (Huang et al., 2011; Z\u00fcst et al., 2007; Lokugamage et al., 2015; Denison et al., 1992) . Amongst the 'not detected' or 'not enriched' viral proteins are (i) nsp11, which is a short peptide of only 14 amino acids at the carboxyterminus of polyprotein 1a with a yet unassigned role or function in coronavirus replication, (ii) the structural proteins spike (S) protein, envelope (E) protein, and membrane (M) protein, which mainly localize to sites of viral assembly before being incorporated into newly-formed viral particles, and (iii) all accessory proteins (NS2a, HE, ORF4, ORF5a). Altogether, these results validate the proximity-dependent biotinylation approach and demonstrate the specific and exclusive labeling of MHV-RTC-associated proteins ( Figure 2d) .",

Therefore, the identified RTC-proximal host proteins, recorded over the entire duration of the MHV replication cycle, likely include proteins that display a prolonged co-localization with the MHV RTC, proteins that may locate only transiently in close proximity to the RTC, and proteins of which only a minor fraction of the cellular pool may associate with the RTC. To this end, we assessed the localization of a limited number of host proteins from our candidate list in MHV-infected cells. Accordingly, we identified RTC-proximal host proteins displaying a pronounced co-localization with the MHV RTC, such as the ER protein reticulon 4 (RTN4; Figure 2e ), and host proteins where co-localization by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was not readily detectable, such as the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3E (eIF3E; Figure 2e ).

To examine these categories further, identify important cellular pathways within them, and extract known functional associations among RTC-proximal host proteins, we performed STRING network analysis on the RTCproximal proteins in each category ( Despite 'cell-cell adhesion' scoring high, it likely represents a typical limitation of gene annotation databases, where many genes play multiple roles in numerous pathways and processes.

Cell viability after siRNA knockdown was also assessed and genes resulting in cytotoxicity following silencing were discarded from further analysis. Importantly, we included internal controls of known relevance for MHV entry (MHV receptor Ceacam1a) and replication (Gbf1, Arf1) on each plate and found in each case that siRNA silencing of these factors significantly reduced MHV replication, which underscores the robustness and effectiveness of our approach (Figure 4-figure supplement 1a ) (Verheije et al., 2008) . We found that siRNA-mediated silencing of 53 RTC-proximal host factors significantly reduced MHV replication compared to non-targeting siRNA controls. These factors can therefore be considered proviral and required for efficient replication (Figure 4b ; Supplementary file 3). In contrast, we did not find antiviral factors that resulted in significant enhancement of viral replication upon siRNA knockdown. While this work was performed in a murine fibroblast cell line, the identification of antiviral proteins may be anticipated in a similar siRNA-mediated knockdown screen using primary target cells such as macrophages, that are better equipped in eliciting antiviral responses upon virus infection.",

For this, we selected all host factors assigned to the category 'translation' (Figure 3a) and assessed virus replication following siRNAmediated silencing of each factor. Measurement of luciferase activity after MHV-Gluc infection confirmed initial findings obtained by screening the entire siRNA library of MHV RTC-proximal factors ( Figure 4c) . Specifically for Rpl13a, and eIFs 3i, 3 f, and 3e viral replication was reduced to levels Upon 48 hr siRNA-silencing, L929 fibroblasts were pulsed with 3 mM puromycin for 60 min. Control cells were treated, prior to puromycin incubation, with 355 mM cycloheximide and 208 mM Emetin for 30 min to block protein synthesis. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blots were probed using anti-puromycin antibodies to assess puromycin incorporation into polypeptides and normalized to actin levels. Error bars represent the mean \u00b1 standard deviation, where * is p 0.05, ** is p 0.005, *** is p 0.0005 and **** is p < 0.0001. Figure 4 continued on next page comparable to our controls Ceacam1a (MHV receptor) and Gbf1 (Verheije et al., 2008) . Consistently, cell-associated viral mRNA levels ( Figure 4d ) and viral titers ( . This data demonstrates that the reduced viral replication observed after siRNA knockdown is not due to a general impairment of host translation. To confirm the knockdown of host translation factors on the protein level we employed antibodies that were available for eIF3e, eIF3f, and eIF3i, and as shown in Figure 5 , murine L929 fibroblasts that were treated individually with four target-specific siRNAs displayed significantly reduced expression of eIF3e, eIF3f, and eIF3i proteins (Figure 5a, Figure 5b ). Importantly, under conditions of eIF3e, eIF3f, and eIF3i knockdown, viral replication was also significantly restricted, confirming the importance of these translation initiation factors for MHV replication (Figure 5c ). Subsequently, we aimed to visualize the localization of active translation during virus infection by puromycin incorporation into nascent polypeptides on immobilized ribosomes (ribopuromycylation) followed by fluorescence imaging using antibodies directed against puromycin (David et al., 2012) . In non-infected L929 cells, ribopuromycylation resulted in an expected diffuse, mainly cytosolic, staining pattern interspersed with punctate structures indicative of translation localized to dedicated subcellular cytosolic locations ( Figure 6 ). In striking contrast, MHV-infected L929 cells displayed a pronounced enrichment of actively translating ribosomes near the viral RTC as indicated by the strong overlap between the viral replicase and the ribopuromycylation stain. Interestingly, active translation in vicinity of the RTC was strongest during the early phase of infection at 6 h.p.i., and was observed until 8 h.p.i., before gradually decreasing as the infection advanced along with the appearance of typical syncytia formation indicative of cytopathic effect (CPE).",

The HCoV-229E RTC, which was detected with an antiserum directed against nsp8, appeared as small and dispersed perinuclear puncta during early infection and eventually converged into larger perinuclear structures later in infection. Consistent with findings obtained for MHV, we observed a striking co-localization of the HCoV-229E RTC with sites of active translation during the early phase of the infection (Figure 7, Figure 7-figure supplement 1) . The co-localization gradually decreased as the infection reached the late phase with upcoming signs of CPE. Finally, we further demonstrated that active translation is localized to the site of MERS-CoV RNA synthesis as dsRNA puncta highly overlapped with the ribopuromycylation stain in MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells (Figure 7) . Collectively, these results not only confirm the spatial link between individual components of the host cell translation machinery and coronavirus replication compartments as identified by proximity-dependent biotinylation using MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2, but they also demonstrate that active translation is taking place in close proximity to the viral RTC.",

By engineering a promiscuous biotin ligase (Bir-A R118G ) as an integral component of the coronavirus replication complex, we provide a novel approach to define the molecular mircoenvironment of viral replication complexes that is applicable to many other RNA and DNA viruses. We show that nsp2 fusion proteins encoded by recombinant MHV-APEX2-nsp2 and MHV-Bir-A R118G -nsp2, are indeed part of the RTC and localize to characteristic coronavirus replicative structures. On the ultrastrurctural level, APEX2-catalized DAB polymer depositions were detected at DMVs and CMs, and we observed co-localization of BirA R118G with established coronavirus RTC markers, such as nsp2/3 and nsp8, by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy.

This extends previous immunofluorescence and electron microscopic studies that were limited by the availability of nsp-specific antibodies and could only show localization of individual nsps to coronavirus replicative structures (Knoops et al., 2008; Ulasli et al., 2010; Schiller et al., 1998; Hagemeijer et al., 2010; Graham et al., 2005) . Moreover, the close proximity of BirA R118G -nsp2 to MHV replicative enzymes, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the NTPase/helicase (nsp13), the 5'-cap methyltransferases (nsp14, nsp16), the proof-reading exonuclease (nsp14), in MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2-infected cells further suggests close proximity of nsp2 to the site of viral RNA synthesis. We thus propose that nsp2-16 and the nucleocapsid protein collectively constitute a functional coronavirus replication and transcription complex in infected cells. The analysis of the host proteome enriched at MHV replication sites revealed a comprehensive list of host proteins that constitute the coronavirus RTC microenvironment. This included several individual factors and host cell pathways, especially transport mechanisms involving vesicle-mediated trafficking, which have been shown to assist coronavirus replication. Indeed, previous findings have reported the importance of the early secretory pathway, as well as key proteins for these processes such as Gbf1 and Arf1, for efficient coronavirus replication (Verheije et al., 2008; de Wilde et al., 2015; Oostra et al., 2007; Knoops et al., 2010; Vogels et al., 2011; Hsu et al., 2010) . Other markers such as Sec61a have also been detected in proximity of viral RTCs in SARS-CoV-infected cells (Knoops et al., 2010) . Correspondingly, the implications of proteins involved in catabolic processes such as autophagy have also been linked to coronavirus replication and other positive-strand RNA viruses Sharma et al., 2014; Monastyrska et al., 2013) . Of note, the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been studied in more details during MHV infection and has also been highlighted in a genetic screen using infectious bronchitis coronavirus (Wong et al., 2015; Raaben et al., 2010a; Raaben et al., 2010b) .",

            "text": "Importantly proteins have not been described before. These likely include proteins with defined temporal roles during particular phases of the viral life cycle and proteins that did not yet attract our attention in previous screens because of functional redundancies. We therefore expect that this approach will find wide application in the field of virus-host interaction, target identification for virus inhibition, and provides a starting point to reveal similarities and differences between replication strategies of a broad range of viruses. One novel finding that arose immediately from our RTC-proximity screen is the demonstration of a close spatial association of host cell translation with the coronavirus RTC. Indeed, the biotin ligasebased proteomic screen identified a number of translation initiation factors, most prominently several eIF3 subunits that were found to have functional importance for viral replication, and numerous ribosome-and translation-associated proteins within the coronavirus RTC microenvironment (Figure 3, Figure 4) . These results are in line with a recent genome-wide siRNA screen where translation factors were suggested to play a role in the replication of avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) (Wong et al., 2015) . The implication of this finding has, to our knowledge, not been further investigated. In addition, we noted the presence of subunits of the signal recognition particle in proximity to the coronavirus RTC and their functional relevance for viral replication, which is indicative of an importance for the translation of membrane proteins. Notably, the coronavirus RTC is translated as two polyproteins that contain nsp3, 4 and 6 with multiple trans-membrane domains that are believed to anchor the RTC at ER-derived membranes (Knoops et al., 2008; Oostra et al., 2007) . It is thus tempting to speculate that the coronavirus RTC is either attracting, or deliberately forming in proximity to, the ER-localized host translation machinery in order to facilitate replicase translation and insertion into ER membranes. This idea is also applicable to many other positivestranded RNA viruses that express viral polyproteins with embedded trans-membrane domains to anchor the viral replication complex in host endomembranes. Recent experimental evidence for Dengue virus supports this hypothesis. By using cell fractionation and ribosomal profiling, it has been shown that translation of the Dengue virus (family Flaviviridae) genome is associated with the ERassociated translation machinery accompanied by ER-compartment-specific remodeling of translation (Reid et al., 2018) . Moreover, several recent genome-wide CRISPR screens demonstrated the functional importance of proteins involved in biosynthesis of membrane and secretory proteins, further supporting a pivotal role of the ER-associated translation machinery for virus replication (Zhang et al., 2016) .",

The data presented here indicate that coronaviruses have evolved a similar strategy by compartmentalizing and directing viral RNA synthesis to sites of ER-associated translation. Likewise, this strategy has a number of advantages. Coronaviruses would not require sophisticated transport mechanisms that direct viral mRNA to distantly located ribosomes. A close spatial association of viral RNA synthesis and translation during early post-entry events would rather allow for remodeling the ER-associated translation machinery to ensure translation of viral mRNA in a protected microenvironment. Viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to facilitate translation of their mRNAs including highly diverse internal ribosomal entry sites, recruitment of translation-associated host factors to viral RNAs, and even transcript-specific translation (Hashem et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013) . Accordingly, by remodeling defined sites for viral mRNA translation, the repertoire and concentration of translation factors can be restricted to factors needed for translation of these viral mRNAs. A microenvironment that is tailored towards the translational needs of viral mRNAs in proximity to the viral replicase complex would also make virus replication tolerant to host-or virus-induced shut down of translation at distal sites within the cytosol (Raaben et al., 2007) . Notably, host translational shut down is well known for coronaviruses (Raaben et al., 2007) and specifically nsp1 has been implicated to play a role in this context by mediating host mRNA degradation Kamitani et al., 2006) . Coronaviruses may thus have evolved a two-pronged strategy to ensure efficient translation of viral proteins by establishing viral RNA synthesis in close proximity to actively translating ribosomes and by employing nsp1-mediated host cell mRNA degradation at RTC-distal sites. The strategy to assemble the viral RTC in close proximity to translation would also favor the coupling between genome translation and replication that has been proposed for picornaviruses and other positive-strand RNA viruses (de Groot et al., 1992; Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994) .",

Indeed, the ability of BirA R118G to label viral and host factors independently of high affinity and prolonged molecular interactions enables the establishment of a comprehensive repertoire reflecting the history of protein association with the viral RTC, recorded during the entire course of infection. In future studies it will be important to provide an 'RTC-association map' with temporal resolution. Like we have seen for translation initiation factors in this study, association of host cell proteins with the viral RTC might not persist throughout the entire replication cycle but might be of importance only transiently or during specific phases of the replication cycle. Given its short labeling time, APEX2 indeed offers this possibility to dissect protein recruitment to the viral RTC in a timeresolved manner, that is to detect RTC-associated host proteins at specific time points post infection. This will ultimately result in a dynamic, high resolution molecular landscape of virus-host interactions at the RTC and provide an additional impetus to elucidate critical virus-host interactions that take place at the site of viral RNA synthesis. These interactions should be exploited in the development of novel strategies to combat virus infection, based on conserved mechanisms of interactions at replication complexes of a broad range of positive-stranded RNA viruses.

In short, a pGPT-1 plasmid encoding an Escherichia coli guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (GPT) flanked by MHV-A59 nt 447-950 and 1315-1774 was used for targeted homologous recombination with a vaccinia virus (VV) containing a full-length cDNA copy of the MHV-A59 genome (Coley et al., 2005) . The resulting GPT-positive VV was further used for recombination with a plasmid containing the EGFP coding sequence flanked by MHV-A59 nt 477-956 and 951-1774 for the generation of MHV-GFP-nsp2, based on the strategy employed by Freeman et al. (Freeman et al., 2014) . Alternatively, a plasmid containing the BirA R118G coding sequence (Roux et al., 2012) or the APEX2 coding sequence (Lam et al., 2015) , with a N-terminal myc-tag or V5-tag, respectively, and a C-terminal (SGG) 3 flexible linker flanked by MHV-A59 nt 477-956 and 951-1774 was used for the generation of MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2 and MHV-APEX2-nsp2. The resulting VV were used to generate full-length cDNA genomic fragments by restriction digestion of the VV backbone. Rescue of MHV-GFP-nsp2, MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2 and MHV-APEX2-nsp2 was performed by electroporation of capped in vitro transcribed recombinant genomes into a BHK-21-derived cell line stably expressing the nucleocapsid (N) protein layered on permissive 17Cl1 mouse fibroblasts. Recombinant MHV viruses were plaque-purified three times and purified viruses were passaged three times for stock preparations. All plasmid sequences, VV sequences and recombinant MHV sequences were confirmed by PCR or RT-PCR sequencing. Viruses were propagated on 17Cl1 cells and virus stocks were titrated by plaque assay on L929 cells.",

Proteins on gel samples were reduced, alkylated and digested with Trypsin (Gunasekera et al., 2012) . Digests were loaded onto a pre-column (C18 PepMap 100, 5 mm, 100 A, 300 mm i.d. x 5 mm length) at a flow rate of 20 mL/min with solvent C (0.05% TFA in water/ acetonitrile 98:2). After loading, peptides were eluted in back flush mode onto the analytical Nanocolumn (C18, 3 mm, 100 \u00c5 , 75 mm x 150 mm, Nikkyo Technos C. Ltd., Japan) using an acetonitrile gradient of 5% to 40% solvent B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water/acetonitrile 4,9:95) in 40 min at a flow rate of 400 nL/min. The column effluent was directly coupled to a Fusion LUMOS mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer, Bremen; Germany) via a nano-spray ESI source. Data acquisition was made in data-dependent mode with precursor ion scans recorded in the orbitrap with resolution of 120'000 (at m/z = 250) parallel to top speed fragment spectra of the most intense precursor ions in the Linear trap for a cycle time of 3 s maximum. Spectra interpretation was performed with Easyprot on a local, server run under Ubuntu against a forward + reverse Mus musculus 2016_04) and MHV 2016_07) database, using fixed modifications of carboamidomethylated on Cysteine, and variable modification of oxidation on Methionine, biotinylation on Lysine and on protein N-term, and deamidation of Glutamine and Asparagine. Parent and fragment mass tolerances were set to 10 ppm and 0.4 Da, respectively. Matches on the reversed sequence database were used to set a Z-score threshold, where 1% false discoveries (FDR) on the peptide spectrum match level had to be expected. Protein identifications were only accepted, when two unique peptides fulfilling the 1% FDR criterion were identified. MS identification of biotinylated proteins was performed in three independent biological replicates. For label-free protein quantification, LC-MS/MS data was interpreted with Max-Quant (version 1.5.4.1) using the same protein sequence databases and search parameters as for EasyProt. Match between runs was activated, however samples from different treatments were given non-consecutive fraction numbers in order to avoid over-interpretation of data. The summed and median normalized top3 peptide intensities extracted from the evidence table as a surrogate of protein abundance (Braga-Lagache et al., 2016) and LFQ values were used for statistical testing. The protein groups were first cleared from all identifications, which did not have at least two valid LFQ values. Protein LFQ levels derived from MaxQuant were log-transformed. Missing values were imputed by assuming a normal distribution between sample replicates. A two-tailed t-test was used to determine significant differences in protein expression levels between sample groups and p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR) test. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD009975.",

The following incubations were performed on ice in ice-cold buffers unless stated otherwise. Cells were washed 3x with sodium cacodylate buffer, quenched with 20 mM glycine in cacodylate buffer for 5 min. before three additional washes with cacodylate buffer. Cells were stained in cacodylate buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml DAB and 10 mM H2O2 for 20 min until DAB precipitates were visible by light microscopy. Cells were washed 3x with cacodylate buffer to stop the staining reaction. Processing of samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed as described previously (Sch\u00e4tz et al., 2013) . Briefly, cells were washed once with PBS prewarmed to 37\u02daC and subsequently fixed with 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (Merck, Hohenbrunn, Germany) pH 7.4 for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4\u02daC. After three washes in cacodylate buffer for 10 min each, cells were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 (Chemie Brunschwig, Basel, Switzerland) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 hr at 4\u02daC and again washed three times with cacodylate buffer. Thereafter, cells were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series (70%, 80%, 90%, 94%, 100% (v/v) for 20 min each) and embedded in Epon resin, a mixture of Epoxy embedding medium, dodecenyl succinic anhydride (DDSA) and methyl nadic anhydride (MNA) (Sigma Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland).

ORF1a and ORF1b encode the viral replication and transcription complex (nsp1-16). myc-BirA R118G was inserted as an N-terminal fusion with nsp2 within ORF1a. The cleavage site between nsp1 and myc-BirA R118G was retained (black arrow) while a deleted cleavage site between BirA R118G and nsp2 ensured the release of a BirA R118G -nsp2 fusion protein from the pp1a polyprotein.
