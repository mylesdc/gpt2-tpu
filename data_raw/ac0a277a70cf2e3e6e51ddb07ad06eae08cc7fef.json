All isoxazolidine cycloadducts were screened for antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of DNA and RNA viruses. Several isoxazolidines inhibited the replication of both thymidine kinase wild-type and deficient (TK + and TK \u2212 ) varicella-zoster virus strains at EC 50 in the 5.4-13.6 \u00b5M range, as well as human cytomegalovirus (EC 50 = 8.9-12.5 \u00b5M). Isoxazolidines trans-11b, trans-11c, trans-11e, trans-11f/cis-11f, trans-11g, trans-11h, and trans-11i/cis-11i exhibited moderate cytostatic activity towards the human lymphocyte cell line CEM (IC 50 = 9.6-17 \u00b5M).",

Another analogue, i.e., 2-methyl-3-(substituted-benzalamino)-4(3H)-quinazolinone 3, was found to exhibit antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in vivo. Compound 3 showed curative effects of 54%, which was slightly higher than that of a reference drug, Ningnanmycin [21] . Very recently quinazolin-4(3H)-ones 4-6 were synthesized and evaluated for inhibitory action on the replication of influenza A virus (H 5 N 1 ), as well as to test toxicity on in vitro cell lines. In general, quinazolin-4(3H)-ones containing a chalcone skeleton 4, thiosemicarbazone 5, and hydrazide 6 showed moderate antiviral activity against H 5 N 1 (inhibition rate: 38%, 47%, 25%, respectively, for 4, 5, 6) compared to a reference drug, Zanamivir [22] . In addition, compounds 7 and 8 possessing a nitro group at C6 were reported as potent inhibitors of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) (EC 50 = 0.8 \u00b5M, CC 50 = 50 \u00b5M) [23] . Quinazolinone (aS)-9 displayed high selectivity for PI4KIII\u03b1 and appeared to be potent inhibitors of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in vitro. Moreover, compound (aS)-9 exhibited higher potency for PI4KIII\u03b1 than its atropisomer aR (pIC 50 of 8.3 vs. 6.9) and an improved selectivity range (2.7-3.2 vs. 1.4-2.1) against the other lipid kinases [24] .

For example, 5-bromo-2-(6-bromo-4-oxo-2-phenyl-4H-quinazolin-3-yl)-benzoic acid 1 was reported to possess distinct antiviral activity against both herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and vaccinia virus (VACV) (EC50 = 12 \u03bcg/mL) [19] , whereas compound 2 exhibited activity against vaccinia virus in E6SM cell cultures (MIC of 1.92 \u03bcg/mL) [20] . Another analogue, i.e., 2-methyl-3-(substituted-benzalamino)-4(3H)-quinazolinone 3, was found to exhibit antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in vivo. Compound 3 showed curative effects of 54%, which was slightly higher than that of a reference drug, Ningnanmycin [21] . Very recently quinazolin-4(3H)-ones 4-6 were synthesized and evaluated for inhibitory action on the replication of influenza A virus (H5N1), as well as to test toxicity on in vitro cell lines. In general, quinazolin-4(3H)-ones containing a chalcone skeleton 4, thiosemicarbazone 5, and hydrazide 6 showed moderate antiviral activity against H5N1 (inhibition rate: 38%, 47%, 25%, respectively, for 4, 5, 6) compared to a reference drug, Zanamivir [22] . In addition, compounds 7 and 8 possessing a nitro group at C6 were reported as potent inhibitors of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) (EC50 = 0.8 \u03bcM, CC50 = 50 \u03bcM) [23] . Quinazolinone (aS)-9 displayed high selectivity for PI4KIII\u03b1 and appeared to be potent inhibitors of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in vitro. Moreover, compound (aS)-9 exhibited higher potency for PI4KIII\u03b1 than its atropisomer aR (pIC50 of 8.3 vs. 6.9) and an improved selectivity range (2.7-3.2 vs. 1.4-2.1) against the other lipid kinases [24] . Recently, we have succeeded in synthesis of a series of quinazolinones substituted at C3 with a (diethoxyphosphoryl)isoxazolidine moiety 10. Several of the synthesized analogues exhibited moderate activity against varicella zoster virus (VZV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [25] .

Since the introduction of the bromine atom at C6 of the quinazolin-4-one framework has no influence on the stereochemical outcome of the reaction of nitrone 12 with N3-susbstituted 2-vinyl-3H-quinazolin-4-ones, the trans and cis configurations of the major trans-11a-k and minor cis-11a-k isomers were assigned taking advantage of our previous observations.",

In general, the inhibitory activity of the tested compounds toward TK \u2212 VZV 07-1 strain was better than that of the reference drugs acyclovir and brivudin (EC 50 = 39.2 \u00b5M and EC 50 = 31.9 \u00b5M, respectively), which require activation by the viral enzyme. On the other hand, the activity of these compounds against the TK + VZV OKA strain was five to nine-fold and 360 to 587-fold lower than that of the reference drugs acyclovir and brivudin, respectively. While exhibiting significant activity toward both TK + and TK \u2212 VZV stains, compounds trans-11b, trans-11d, trans-11g, and trans-11h exhibited the lowest cytotoxicity (CC 50 = 33-42 \u00b5M). It is worth mentioning that incorporation of the bromine atom at C6 in the quinazolinone skeleton resulted in a significant increase in potency of isoxazolidine-conjugates 11b-11i against VZV (up to five-fold higher) when compared with previously described analogous conjugates 10b-10i having an unsubstituted quinazoline skeleton [25] . The synthesized isoxazolidine phosphonates also showed marked activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) ( Table 3 ) and, among them, trans-11d, trans-11g, trans-11h, and trans-11i/cis-11i (92:8) were the most potent ones.

The trans-isoxazolidine cycloadducts (trans-11a, trans-11b, trans-11c, trans-11d, trans-11e, trans-11g, trans-11h, trans-11j, trans-11k) and isoxazolidine cis-11a, or the respective mixtures of isoxazolidines (trans-11f/cis-11f (95:5) and trans-11i/cis-11i (92:8)) were evaluated for their antiviral activity toward variety of DNA and RNA viruses. Almost all compounds were active against VZV and among them trans-11b, trans-11d, trans-11g, and trans-11h were the most potent (EC 50 = 5.8-11.6 \u00b5M) and, at the same time, exhibited lower cytotoxicity toward uninfected cell lines (CC 50 = 33-42 \u00b5M). Furthermore, (isoxazolidine)phosphonates trans-11d, trans-11g, trans-11h, and trans-11i/cis-11i (92:8) showed the highest activity against HCMV (EC 50 = 8.9-12.5 \u00b5M). On the other hand, several compounds exhibited moderate cytostatic effect toward the CEM cell line (IC 50 = 9.6-17 \u00b5M), however, slightly higher than that of 5-fluorouracil used as the reference drug.",

IR spectra were measured on an Infinity MI-60 FT-IR spectrometer (ATI Instruments North America-Mattson, Madison, WI, USA). Melting points were determined on a Boetius apparatus (VEB Kombinat NAGEMA, Dresden, DDR-currently Germany) and are uncorrected.
