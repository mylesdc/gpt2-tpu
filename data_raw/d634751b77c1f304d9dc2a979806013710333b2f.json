In general, these substrates are short peptides containing a reporter chromogenic, fluorogenic or luminogenic group 2 . Specific peptide sequences are usually based on compounds naturally interacting with proteases and are further refined using enzyme crystal structure analysis as well as in silico studies 3 . Alternatively, high throughput screening of libraries composed of peptides or peptidomimetics yields optimized substrate recognition sequences 4 . This method has been routinely applied for the determination of protease specificity and the development of peptide-based protease probes 5 . A major limitation of this approach is the overlapping specificities of different proteases 6 . Closely related proteases with similar substrate recognition patterns are able to cleave similar peptide sequences at equivalent rates. In order to enhance the selectivity of such peptides, their original sequences are usually modified by replacing some of the proteinogenic amino acid residues with structural synthetic analogs 7 . Recently, Kasperkiewicz et al. 8 described the development of a substrate library composed of non-proteinogenic amino acid residues. This library was validated against human neutrophil elastase and yielded a very potent fluorogenic substrate which was further converted into a specific activity-based probe.",

In each position, the chemical groups differed by side chain character specificity including amino, guanidino, carboxy, methoxy, hydroxy and carbobenzyloxy groups (basic, acidic, neutral, hydrophilic, hydrophobic) which was provided via the variety of functionalized PEG derivatives. Simultaneously, the effect of side chain length was investigated since three possibilities of length for each side chain were available: first, simple amino acid chain or its stable protected form; second, side chain extended by single ethylene unit form of all components; third, replication of chemical entities with two polyethylene unit extension. Importantly, the introduction of PEG residues made the prepared libraries highly soluble in water.",

Diversifying the library by inserting 18 different compounds at every X 2 -X 4 position led to the generation of almost 6000 compounds covering a broad range of chemical space. The library was synthesized using manual solid-phase synthesis applying Fmoc chemistry and was screened using an iterative approach in solution. The release of ANB-NH 2 quencher resulted in an increase of free ABZ-peptide fluorescence that allowed us to determine the optimal residue at each examined position. Incorporation of polyethylene glycol residue to the protein or peptide (selective PEGylation) resulted in improved water solubility and higher proteolytic stability of modified molecules; while increasing the molecular weight prolonged the half-life of conjugates 9, 10 . Selective PEGylation has been successfully used for cross-linking of molecules 11 , synthesis of peptide-like polymers modified with different chemical entities 12 , generation of self-assembling nanostructures 13 , cell delivery of molecules, and many other applications (described in ref. 14) .",

            "text": "Our target enzyme in this study was human neutrophil serine protease 4 (NSP4), recently discovered by Jenne et al. 15, 16 . The amino acid sequence of NSP4 shares almost 39% identity with the sequences of human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and proteinase 3 (PR3). NSP4, together with HNE, cathepsin G (CatG), and PR3, is released into the pericellular environment as a result of neutrophil activation. Similar to other neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs), NSP4 is synthesized as an inactive precursor (preproNSP4) which, after the removal of signal peptide, is activated by cathepsin C. In contrast to other NSPs, NSP4 displays a strong preference towards an arginine residue at the P1 position of the substrate (according to Schechter-Berger nomenclature 17 ), but its primary sequence forecasts a very different elastase-like active site with a preference for small aliphatic amino acids. This complication was recently unraveled by Lin et al. who solved the crystal structure of NSP4 complexed with d-Phe-l-Phe-l-Arg chloromethyl ketone 18 . Based on the provided data, the Arg residue is in a non-canonical \"up\" form stabilized by Figure 1 .

The library was synthesized using the mix and split method via Fmoc chemistry. The formation of Dap-PEG conjugates was performed on resin via a submonomeric method (one example of DAPEG-based molecule synthesis is presented in Fig. 2 ). Our goal was to investigate P2, P3, and P4 subsite preferences with a fixed P1 position occupied by an Arg residue. Each peptide in the library was flanked by a C-terminal amide of 5-amino-2-nitrobenozic acid (acceptor of fluorescence) and an N-terminal 2-amino benzoic acid (fluorescence donor) pair which allowed for simultaneous UV and fluorescence monitoring. Screening process was performed using an iterative mode of deconvolution in solution. The 18 sublibraries with fixed X 4 positions were incubated with NSP4. The highest hydrolysis rate of the Arg-ANB-NH 2 bond was observed for diaminopropionic acid modified by carbobenzyloxy-protected amino polyethylene glycols Dap(O2(Cbz)) and Dap(O1(Cbz) (Fig. 3A ) followed by the remaining amino acid residues -Dap and the Cbz-protected analog (Dap(Cbz)) and methyl ether of Ser. A relatively high rate of proteolysis was also observed of methyl ether derived PEG chains with supremacy of the longer Dap(MO2) chain -Insignificant output was observed for acidic residues despite side chain length. Considering the above findings, in next our step deconvolution of Dap(O2(Cbz)) was included yielding the ABZ-Dap(O2(Cbz))-X 3 -X 2 -Arg-ANB-NH 2 library.",

The arginine residue in the X 1 position is located in the Ser214 binding pocket and is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds with Ser216 and the backbone of Gly217. Additionally, it can form a cation -\u03c0 interaction with the Phe190 residue. According to experimental data, the preferred residue in the X 2 position is Dap(GO1). Our model shows that this residue is located in the cavity normally occupied by the substrate backbone. The guanidinium group of Dap(GO1) is located in the nest created by the side chains of His99, Trp172, His175 and Phe215 (S 4 pocket), thus creating strong cation -\u03c0 interactions. Additionally, we have found a hydrogen bond with the backbone of Trp172. The peptide bond between arginine (X 1 ) and ANB-NH 2 is located in the proximity of the Ser195 found within the catalytic triad in an orientation which allows for a nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon. The most preferred residue in the X 3 position is Dap(Cbz). It is located near the His57 residue of the catalytic triad and in this case we found backbone-backbone interactions. Additionally, we have found a cation -\u03c0 interaction with Arg62. The most preferred residue in the X 4 position is Dap(O2(Cbz)). The chain Dap(O2(Cbz)) is located in the vicinity of His61, however the phenyl ring of the carbobenzyloxy moiety is located in the nest created by Phe59, Leu88 and Thr90.

Chasing a single proteolytic enzyme in complex biological systems is a demanding challenge. In this work, the synthetic method used for the development of the library represents novel atypical peptidomimetics based on a submonomeric approach. The presence of a fluorogenic ABZ (2-amino benzoic acid) moiety and ANB-NH 2 (amide of 5-amino-2-nitrobenzoic acid) fluorescence quencher pair facilitates in-solution fluorescence screening. The introduction of novel pseudo amino acid side chains such as those functionalized by different chemical entities of polyethylene glycol moieties covers a broad range of interactions between the enzyme studied and the selected substrate. The sequence revealed upon deconvolution of such DAPEG (Dap modified by PEG moiety) library supplement by typical amino acid residues is a novel approach, lacking any similarity to any work reported recently by our group. It has been constructed with two DAPEG units with different functional group on the side chains. Such diversified functional groups together with their glycol side chains offer multiple contacts between the enzyme and the selected substrate. As indicated, in position X 4 a long polyethylene glycol side chain terminated by an aromatic group is preferred over other chemical entities at this position. In general, this result is in agreement with data provided by Perera et al. 15 since NSP4 prefers an aromatic amino acid in this position. However, the side chain length is an important factor that makes a significant difference between Phe/Tyr and Dap(O2(Cbz)). In the light of data summarized in Table 1 that provides published up to date NSP4 substrate sequences, position P4 is dominated by hydrophobic amino acid residues (hCha, Phe).",

This result is consisted with the proposed model of binding. The arginine residue in the P1 position is long enough to create a hydrogen bond with Ser216 and the backbone of Gly217. A small residue such as ANB is able to create more hydrogen bonds (with His41 and Arg62) in comparison to serine in discussed position (P1\u2032 ). Our results indicate that the most preferred residue in the P2 position is Dap(GO1) while Perera et al. 16 suggest arginine residue in this position. With the proposed mode of binding Dap(GO1) is located in the cavity normally occupied by the substrate backbone. This cavity is highly hydrophobic, created by the following residues: His99, Trp172, His175 and Phe215 (S4 pocket). None of the investigated residues fits better to the described cavity than Dap(GO1). Dap(MO1) and Dap(MO2) can create a set of hydrophobic interactions, however those residues are not able to create any hydrogen bonds. Dap(O1), Dap(O2), Dap(HO1) and Dap(HO1) are able to create hydrogen bonds, however, due to their high conformational flexibility, they are not able to maintain stable and strong interactions. The side chain of the residue in the P2 position cannot be too long, since we did not observe significant activity with Dap(GO2). According to the proposed model of binding, the most preferred residue in the P3 position should be Dap(GO1) and Dap(GO2) since both residues are able to form a salt bridge with Arg62. However, our experimental results showed the opposite effect indicating that Dap(Cbz) was the most preferred residue at the P3 position. The residue at the P3 position is located adjacent to the catalytic triad (especially H57). It might be suspected that the role of the P3 residue is also to protect the catalytic triad from external influence. The most interesting result was obtained in regards to the P4 position which seems to be occupied by an aromatic residue. Moreover, the chain length seems to be important in the activation process: the short chain (Dap(Cbz)) would interact with His61 and/or Pro96 while its elongation would weaken this interaction as a slight decrease in the NSP4 activity with Dap(O1(Cbz)) was observed. When the side chain was long enough to reach the protein surface we observed a major increase in NSP4 activity. Hence, the proposed binding place of the P4 residue is located beyond the ligand binding site; thus position P4 could be considered as a target for the design of specific and highly selective ligands for the NSP4.",

The resin was washed twice in N methylmorpholine. Next, 2 equiv. of ANB was dissolved in DMF and 2 equiv. of TBTU was added, followed by 1 equiv. of DMAP. The obtained solution was added to the resin, and after 30 s, 4 equiv. of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) was added. The whole mixture was stirred for 3 h. The solution was filtered off, and the resin was washed with DMF. The procedure was repeated three times. Next, the first amino acid residue was coupled with a method described in ref. 22 . A ninefold excess was applied to the active resin sites as follows: the amino acid was dissolved in pyridine (10 ml pyridine to 1 g peptidyl-resin). The whole solution was mixed until the temperature of \u2212 15 \u00b0C was reached and then 9 equiv. of POCl 3 was added. The mixture was successively stirred for 20 min at \u2212 15 \u00b0C, 20 min at room temperature, and 6 h in an oil bath. After deprotection with 20% piperidine in DMF, the peptide chain was elongated as follows: resin was divided into 18 equal parts, and in six positions, the amino acid derivatives such as Fmoc-Asp(tBu), Fmoc-Ser(OtBu), Fmoc-Ser(OMe), Fmoc-Dap(Cbz), Fmoc-Agp(Boc) 2 , Fmoc-Dap(Boc) were introduced-where Dap is (S) 2,3-diaminopropionic acid and Agp ((S)2-amino-3-guanidino-propionic acid)-using a standard Fmoc synthesis protocol. To each of remaining 12 portions, Fmoc-Dap(Mtt) was introduced and 4-methyltrityl (Mtt) was removed using procedure described in ref. 23 (2% TFA in DCM with addition of 1% triisopropylsilane). Such mixture was added to every 12 portions and stirred for 15 min. Completeness of Mtt removal was verified by adding pure TFA and yellow color development was monitored to indicate the presence of free Mtt groups. The whole procedure was repeated until no absorbency increase monitored at 410 nm was recorded. Next, DIPEA/DMF solution was added to each system for 15 min, resulting in 12 portions of Fmoc-Dap-Arg-ANB-polymer. To each of the above resin aliquots, the monoprotected heterobifunctional polyethylene glycol moieties (PEG) were coupled using equimolar amounts of PEG/DIPCI/HOBt in DMF/NMP (1:1, v/v) solution. The following protected PEG derivatives were used: 5-(t-butyloxycarbonyl-amino)-3-oxapentanoic acid (further abbreviated as O1), 8-(t-butyloxycarbonyl-amino)-3, 6-dioxaoctanoic acid (O2), 5-[N-t-butyloxycarbonyl-N\u2032 -(2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydro benzofuran-5-sulfonyl)] amidino-3-oxapentanoic acid (GO1), 8-[N-t-butyloxycarbonyl-N\u2032 -(2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzof uran-5-sulfonyl)]amidino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (GO2), 5-(benzyloxycarbonyl-amino)-3-oxa-pentanoic acid (O1(Cbz)), 8-(benzyloxycarbonyl-amino)-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid dicyclohexylamine (O2(Cbz)), 2-(2-tert-butoxyethoxy) acetic acid (HO1), 2-(2-(2-tert-butoxyethoxy)ethoxy) acetic acid (HO2), 3,6-dioxaoctanedioic acid 1-tert-butyl ester (C01), 3,6,9-Trioxaundecandioic acid 1-tert-butyl ester (CO2), 5-methoxy-3-oxapentanoic acid (MO1), 8-methoxy-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (MO2). Completeness of the coupling was monitored using a Kaiser test. Lack of free amino groups allowed us to move to the next step of library synthesis in which all resin portions were mixed and again divided into 18 parts. The whole procedure was repeated twice. Finally, the tert-butyloxycarbonyl derivative of 2-amino benzoic acid (Boc-ABZ-OH) was attached to the N-terminal amino group using the standard coupling method described above.",
