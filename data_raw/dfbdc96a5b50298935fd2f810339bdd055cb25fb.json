Regional bodies make decisions about health challenges in the region, for example, the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and the World Health Organisation South East Asia Regional Office (WHO-SEARO). The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has a limited health presence as a regional organisation and diplomatic partner in health governance. This article identifies how SADC facilitates and coordinates health policy, arguing that SADC has the potential to promote regional health diplomacy and governance through engagement with regional social policy. The article identifies the role of global health diplomacy and niche diplomacy in health governance. The role of SADC as a regional organisation and the way it functions is then explained, focusing on how SADC engages with health issues in the region. Recommendations are made as to how SADC can play a more decisive role as a regional organisation to implement South-South management of the regional social policy, health governance and health diplomacy agenda.",

The gaps identified in current literature include a lack of information on what SADC does specifically to advance regional health governance and Southern regional health diplomacy. We argue that SADC can play a more significant role in health diplomacy and governance in the Global South, through engagement with regional social and health policies. The article shows this possibility by first describing the global principles of health diplomacy and niche diplomacy. It further describes what role SADC plays in health governance in the region and finally shows how SADC can play a stronger role in facilitating and coordinating health governance and diplomacy through social policy, based on the potential capacity it has as a regional organisation.",

Brazil also formally recognised the right to health in the Brazilian constitution and made health a central foreign policy theme. When antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for HIV/AIDS treatment became available in 1996, the Brazilian government pushed for access to ARV drugs for all HIV-positive people in the country. Brazil worked closely with other countries in the Global South, including the Treatment Action Campaign, to grant licences for local generic production of ARV drugs, despite being in breach of the Agreement on Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Brazil also participated in the FCTC, providing leadership and support for the initiative (Alcazar, 2008; Fourie, 2013) .",

The 'sectoral responsibility approach' resulted in decentralisation of the structure and the creation of the secretariat in Gaborone, Botswana (Ostergaard, 1990; Schoeman, 2002) . The SADCC was viewed as a 'service organisation' rather than a regional leadership body. This structure made sense politically, however, as each state was enabled to contribute equally to development across the region. SADC (1992) grew out of the SADCC in 1992 and was restructured again in 2001. The SADC Secretariat was established in 2001 to centralise the governance processes of each member state, whereas previously each member state had been responsible for a sector, as noted above. The restructuring process created complications in trying to assign responsibility for sectors to specific programmes housed at the Secretariat (SADC, 2014; Schoeman, 2002) .",

Millennium Development Goal 8 (MDG8) to develop a global partnership for development in the SADC region identifies this decline. ODA has decreased despite the high debt burden in the SADC region. Aid dependence in the region was at the same level in 1999 as it was in 1980. Figure 1 shows the levels of ODA, public expenditure on health and total bilateral flows from donors in Southern Africa (African Development Bank, 2014) The graph indicates a slight increase in public expenditure, with fairly significant decreases in ODA.

External funding in the SADC region in 2013 amounted to US$67,600,000 for a total of 58 projects (Gray, 2013 ). The Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) is said to emulate EU policies of integration and development and is determined by the material dependence of SADC on the EU (Lenz, 2012) . As such, donors and governments work together to develop SADC-specific policies and protocols, identified in the next section, which are the foundation for regional health governance in Southern Africa. Perhaps this support is still what SADC requires as a regional organisation.

If SADC were to partner strongly with civil society to regulate the introduction and sale of harmful commodities, the distribution of goods and awareness of potential dangers could be better monitored and regulated (Gods\u00e4ter, 2015; Labont\u00e9 and Gagnon, 2010) .",

Health development requires careful consideration of the relationship between state and society. The 1978 Alma Ata Declaration represents one of the most significant developments in public health, particularly regarding recognition of citizen participation in health systems as a central tenet to primary healthcare, recognising the role of organised social action for securing health gains. White and Banda provide an exemplary explanation on the role of central civil society organizations (CSOs) in health governance, suggesting that CSOs have a better picture of human and technical needs and capabilities. Partnering with communities has the potential to increase returns on health and agriculture. CSOs can also play a role in disease surveillance. The example provided refers to the monitoring of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak since the Chinese government was not willing to disclose the magnitude of the outbreak, leaving the WHO reliant on non-governmental organisation (NGO) and CSO reporting on epidemiological information (White and Banda, 2006) . The UN High Level Panel on Civil Society also advocates for increased cooperation between government and civil society. SADC would do very well in taking this engagement to heart to further engage on issues of access to healthcare and medicines. SADC has the capacity to act as civil society champion in the region. SADC could assist in coordinating civil society platforms by potentially creating a civil society advisory desk, in this case for health organisations. Civil society agendas can be promoted by a specific SADC civil society advisory body to ensure that concerns are addressed at a ministerial level and also to include civil society matters on government agendas. South Africa, as the most powerful SADC state, could lead a civil society initiative to ensure that civil society agendas are addressed at inter-ministerial and government levels. There could alternatively be rotating custody of this responsibility.",

Despite these efforts, national macroeconomic policies have increased inequalities in the region, particularly regarding income, employment and access to education, water and nonhealth sector inputs into health-related issues. Additional inequalities stem from unequal land ownership, distribution and access to resources. Historical structural adjustment policies and market reforms have also influenced public expenditure, creating high levels of healthcare inequalities.

This is also emphasised in policy recommendations by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) with regard to emergency responses to disease control. The CDC suggests countries need to increase the presence of health personnel and systems infrastructure on the ground to mitigate against the threat of rapid disease transmission, as occurred with Ebola (Centre for Disease Control, 2014) . This is also suggested by the Institute for Security Studies, who recommend the need for allocated funding in developing countries (Institute for Security Studies, 2014) . This pertains specifically to the SADC region and the SADC Secretariat should heed these recommendations. In order to do this, the SADC Secretariat should consider integrating with a regional economic and trade regime and generating further support for states to maintain health systems. This takes into account the tripartite free trade discussions which occurred between SADC, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the East African Community (EAC) in 2012 and the final communiqu\u00e9 between the first COMESA-EAC-SADC Tripartite Summit in 2008 (SADC, 2012c). Health-promoting trade must facilitate equitable outcomes of private and public health services. This will become imminently more possible when SADC strengthens its negotiating power and capacity in trade frameworks, challenge global trade regimes which exclude Southern interests, build non-economic and trade regimes within the region that drive internal growth, and strengthen global integration terms for the Southern African region. This is not a very easy process to facilitate, considering the dominance of South Africa in the region. The lack of balance in the region is a cause of concern, considering the tariff advantages for South Africa, cross-border informal trade and limited benefits of intra-regional trade. Other SADC countries actively use NTBs to block trade, as these countries vie for markets. Certain countries fear that their economies will be undermined by cheaper goods in the region and have failed to eliminate NTBs (Keane et al., 2010) . The SADC region has been cited as being unprepared for trade liberalisation. The result of applied NTBs is low regional trade and resultant poverty in the trading bloc. NTBs restrict product standards and rules of origin. Borders are still a major obstacle to regional trade (Gillson, 2010) .",

This is pertinent, considering the mobility of populations in the region, the rapid spread of diseases across mobile corridors and country borders and the lack of coordinated healthcare responses, resulting in disparities in treatment and access to care and medicines.
