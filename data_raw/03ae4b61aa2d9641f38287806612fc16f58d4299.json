Such differences in epidemiology may lead to misdiagnosis and ineffective empirical treatment. Here, we investigated the current spectrum of pathogens causing febrile diseases leading to pediatric hospitalization in Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, Gabon. From August 2015 to March 2016, we conducted a prospective, cross-sectional, hospital-based study in a provincial hospital. Patients were children \u2264 15 years with fever \u2265 38 \u00b0C and required hospitalization. A total of 600 febrile patients were enrolled. Malaria was the main diagnosis found in 52% (311/600) patients. Blood cultures revealed septicemia in 3% (17/593), among them four cases of typhoid fever. The other causes of fever were heterogeneously distributed between both bacteria and viruses. Severe infections identified by Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS) were also most often caused by malaria, but children with danger signs did not have more coinfections than others. In 6% (35/600) of patients, no pathogen was isolated. In Gabon, malaria is still the major cause of fever in children, followed by a bacterial and viral disease. Guidelines for both diagnosis and management should be tailored to the spectrum of pathogens and resources available locally.",

A landmark study conducted in Tanzania showed that due to a change in epidemiology, a broad spectrum of pathogens replaced P. falciparum malaria as the most common cause of disease in children in this area 1 . However, a few years later, P. falciparum malaria, is still seen to be the main cause of febrile illnesses in Ghana, West Africa 2 . When unaware, these differences in epidemiology might lead to misdiagnosis as well as inefficient treatment by the medical personnel. The process of medical diagnosis includes the joint interpretation of symptoms, clinical signs and laboratory findings. Careful selection and prioritization of a diagnostic setup are informed by a priori knowledge of the seasonal, local and worldwide frequency and distribution of a given disease 3,4 .",

On admission, 29% (21/72) patients had a body temperature equal or greater than 39.5 \u00b0C, and the most common associated clinical signs were vomiting and convulsions in 53% (38/72) and 42% (30/71, NA = 1), respectively. Severe anemia -hemoglobin <5 g/dL and/or hematocrit <15% -was found in 12% (7/60, NA = 12) patients. Regarding the main diagnoses; severe malaria was found in 47% (34/67, NA = 5) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in 26% (19/72) patients; the two cases of meningitis and one case of encephalitis were among them. In two patients the cause of fever remained undetermined.

Consequently, in Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, infections were most often caused by parasites (62%) (Plasmodium species and one Schistosoma haematobium infection), followed by bacteria (21%) and viruses (18%). Malaria cases were significantly associated with fever grade 3 (body temperature between 39.4 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C), lethargy, unconsciousness, and convulsions as described in neighboring Congo 8 , and with anemia, malnutrition, and thrombocytopenia. Malnutrition can be an important factor related to malaria as described in hospitalized Mozambican children 9 and is also pre-disposing to bacteremia 10 . Interestingly, we observed an association of malaria and malnutrition despite the generally low prevalence of malnutrition in Gabon. Anemia is particularly important in malaria-endemic areas because it is the most frequent complication in severe malaria 11, 12 .",
