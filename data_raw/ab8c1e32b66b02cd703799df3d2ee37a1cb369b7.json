            "text": "The persistent public health threat of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) highlights the need for an effective and safe MERS-CoV vaccine. In this study, we prepared and vaccinated mice with either a Spike (S) protein or inactivated whole MERS-CoV (IV) with a combined adjuvant (alum+CpG) as a vaccine formulation. Similar levels of the anti-S protein IgG response and neutralizing activity were induced by both the S protein and IV vaccines. In addition, immune responses against three other structural proteins, the envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, were also detected in sera of mice that received IV. No antigen-specific T-cell immunity was detected after vaccination based on the interferon-\u03b3 ELISpot assay. Mice were transduced with Ad5-hDPP4 after the final immunization and were then challenged with MERS-CoV (1 \u00d7 10 5 plaque-forming units). Compared with the control group (adjuvant alone), mice immunized with the S protein or IV showed slightly lower pathological damage in the lung, as well as reduced antigen expression and lung virus titers. Mice that received IV formulations also showed increased protective immunity (almost no live virus was isolated from the lung). In conclusion, our data indicate that immunization with our IV formulation induced enhanced protection in mice compared to immunization with the S protein against MERS-CoV, which should be further tested in camels and clinical trials.",

Similar to Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV emerged as a result of zoonotic introduction to the human population 2, 3 . Considering the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak, it is crucial to develop intervention measures, including vaccines 4 . Currently, no licensed therapeutic treatment or vaccine is available, which highlights the urgent need for the development of an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV infection 4, 5 .",

            "text": "The MERS-CoV genome encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) and four structural proteins 2 , the spike (S), small envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The viral structural proteins, S and N, show the highest immunogenicity [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The S protein mediates coronavirus entry into host cells by first binding to a receptor on the host-cell surface via its receptor-binding domain (RBD) 12 . Although both the S and N proteins can induce T-cell responses, neutralizing antibodies are almost solely directed against the S protein, which is the major immunodominant factor. Thus, current MERS-CoV vaccine candidates primarily use the S protein or (parts of) the gene coding for this glycoprotein 4, 5 . Vaccines against MERS-CoV infection have been developed using purified coronavirus S protein, as well as DNA or viral vector-based vaccines expressing the fulllength MERS-CoV S protein or part of the S protein [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . These vaccines have been tested for their ability to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies in mice or large animals, such as monkeys or camels 7, 17 . Several MERS vaccines have been developed among vaccine platforms but have been shown to confer variable degrees of immunogenicity, which necessitates the adjustment of the dose, adjuvant, and site of administration to induce optimal protective responses 4, 5, 19 . Furthermore, ongoing efforts to develop MERS-CoV vaccines should consider their immunity profiles against different antigens and correlates of protection.",

However, preclinical evaluations of a subunit or inactivated whole-virus vaccine and Th1-type adjuvant for SARS-CoV have shown induction of serum neutralizing antibodies and protection against infection in mice challenged with an infectious virus 21 .

The current study determined the effects of a inactivated whole MERS-CoV(IV) or S protein vaccine with a combined (alum+CpG) adjuvant on protection against MERS-CoV and the risk of lung immunopathology in mice. Furthermore, vaccination with a IV formulation containing other structural proteins (N, M, and E) than the S protein enhanced protection against MERS-CoV, as well as led to reduced viral antigen expression and pathological damage and almost no virus isolation from the lungs of mice postchallenge.",

Therefore, inactivated MERS-CoV vaccines may present a risk of a hypersensitive-type lung pathology following a MERS-CoV infection, similar to SARS-CoV 21, 24 . Our work differs from that of Tseng et al. in several respects, including the preparation of IV (inactivated with 0.4% formaldehyde vs. gamma [\u03b3] irradiation), adjuvant formulation (Al+CpG vs. Al or MF59), and animal model (Ad5-hDPP4 transduced mice vs. hCD26/DPP4 transgenic mice).

As is known, S protein or IV vaccines with alum adjuvant induce a Th2-biased response. Our data demonstrated the advantages of the combination of the two adjuvants, namely, CpG and alum, for the induction of robust antibody responses, as the S proteinspecific IgG titers reached 10 5 and a >60% neutralizing activity, which were achieved in sera at a 1:1000 dilution in both vaccine groups after the second immunization. In addition, vaccines formulated with CpG/alum combinations generated a balanced ([IgG2a+IgG2b]\u00f7IgG1=1) or Th1-biased ([IgG2a+IgG2b]\u00f7IgG1>1) response against the S protein in mice vaccinated with the S protein or IV, respectively. A Th1/Th2 balanced or Th1-biased immune response is generally associated with more effective control of viral infections. In Fig. 2a , mice immunized with IV produced more anti-S antibodies than those immunized with a recombinant spike protein in the 2-week post immunization group. We believe that this difference might be caused by the particle-like conformation of the S protein preserved in the immunogen of IV compared to the recombinant S protein as a soluble subunit.",

The M and E proteins are structural proteins that are anchored in the envelope of MERS-CoV particles 2 . The E protein is a small integral membrane polypeptide that forms an ion channel 38, 39 . The M protein is a typical transmembrane glycoprotein and the most abundant structural protein in CoV virions 40 . Buchholz et al. 37 reported that the M and E proteins expressed in BHPIV3 vectors did not induce detectable resistance to a SARS-CoV challenge in hamsters. However, other reports suggest that M plays a significant role in the virus-specific humoral response and induces production of neutralizing antibodies in SARS patients 36 . In addition, the N, M, and E proteins may be antigens for antiviral cytotoxic T cells, which induce short-term resistance against a virus challenge in the absence of monoclonal antibodies in mice, as has been shown to be the case with several coronaviruses 40, 41 . In our study, the S protein and IV vaccines induced almost identical S protein antigen-specific IgG antibody responses and neutralizing activity after the last immunization. However, the antigen-specific humoral immune response against structural proteins (N, M, and E) other than the S protein was only detected in mice with IV. In addition, the level of S protein or N protein expression in the lungs of mice receiving IV was slightly lower than that in mice that received the S protein vaccine. Furthermore, a more mild pathology and lower virus titers were detected in the lungs of mice that received IV (Fig. 5) , indicating that the IV formulation induced a greater protective effect in mice than the S protein formulation. Therefore, our findings indicate that this enhanced protective effect might be derived from antibodies against the N, M, and E structural proteins contained in IV.",
