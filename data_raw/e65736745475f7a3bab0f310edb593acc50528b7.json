The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus nsp16 protein is a S-adenosylmethionine-dependent (nucleoside-29-O)methyltransferase only active in the presence of its activating partner nsp10. We report the nsp10/nsp16 complex structure at 2.0 \u00c5 resolution, which shows nsp10 bound to nsp16 through a ,930 \u00c5 2 surface area in nsp10. Functional assays identify key residues involved in nsp10/nsp16 association, and in RNA binding or catalysis, the latter likely through a SN2-like mechanism. We present two other crystal structures, the inhibitor Sinefungin bound in the S-adenosylmethionine binding pocket and the tighter complex nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16, providing the first structural insight into the regulation of RNA capping enzymes in (+)RNA viruses.

            "text": "Most eukaryotic cellular and viral mRNAs are modified by the addition of a polyadenine tail at the 39-terminal and a cap structure at the 59-terminal. The RNA cap protects mRNA from degradation by 59 exoribonucleases, ensures efficient mRNA translation, and prevents recognition of viral RNA via innate immunity mechanisms [1, 2, 3, 4] . The RNA cap is made of an N7methylated guanine nucleotide connected through a 59-59 triphosphate bridge to the first transcribed nucleotide, generally an adenine. Through 29-O methylation of the latter, this cap-0 structure ( 7Me GpppA\u2026) may be converted into a cap-1 structure ( 7Me GpppA 29-O-Me \u2026). In the eukaryotic cell, the cap is added cotranscriptionally in the nucleus by three sequential enzymatic reactions [1, 5] : (i) an RNA triphosphatase (RTPase) removes the 59 c-phosphate group of the nascent mRNA; (ii) a guanylyltransferase (GTase), dubbed capping enzyme, catalyses the attachment of GMP to the 59-diphosphate mRNA; and (iii) an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase (N7MTase) methylates the cap onto the N7-guanine, releasing S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). In general, a SAM-dependent (nucleoside-29-O-)-methyltransferase (29-O-MTase) further intervenes, in higher eukaryotes, to yield a cap-1 structure.",

For example, alphaviruses methylate GTP onto the N7-guanine before the presumed attachment of 7Me GMP to the nascent viral 59diphosphate mRNA [6] . In the case of single-stranded negativesense (-)RNA viruses, such as the vesicular stomatitis virus, the L polymerase attaches GDP rather than GMP to a nascent viral 59monophosphate mRNA, covalently linked to the viral capping enzyme [7] . Other viruses, such as influenza virus capture a short capped RNA oligonucleotide from host cell mRNAs and use it as an RNA synthesis primer.

            "text": "In 2003, a novel coronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV [9] ) was responsible for the first viral pandemic of the new millennium with ,8000 cases globally and a 10 % case-fatality rate. Coronaviruses encode an unusually large membrane-associated RNA replication/transcription machinery comprising at least sixteen proteins (nsp1-to-16) [10] . For SARS-CoV, the RNA cap structure likely corresponds to a cap-1 type [11, 12, 13] . As in many other (+)RNA viruses, the RTPase activity is presumably embedded in the RNA helicase nsp13, whereas the GTase remains elusive. RNA cap 29-O-MTase activity was first discovered in the feline coronavirus (FCoV) nsp16 [14] . Shortly after, SARS-CoV nsp14 was shown to methylate RNA caps in their N7-guanine position [15] . Curiously, although closely homologous to that of FCoV, recombinant SARS-CoV nsp16 alone was devoid of enzymatic activity. It was demonstrated [16, 17, 18, 19 ] that nsp10 interacts with nsp16, conferring 29-O-MTase activity to nsp16 on N7-methyl guanine RNA caps selectively [16] . The latter selectivity implies that RNA cap methylation obeys an ordered sequence of events during which nsp14-mediated N7-guanine methylation precedes nsp10/nsp16 RNA 29-O methylation. Nsp10 is a double zinc finger protein of 148 residues whose crystal structure is known [20, 21] . Together with nsp4, nsp5, nsp12, nsp14, and nsp16, nsp10 has been found to be essential in the assembly of a functional replication/transcription complex [22] . Drawing on these observations, nsp10 has been proposed to play pleiotropic roles in viral RNA synthesis [23] and polyprotein processing through interaction with the main protease nsp5 [24] .",

Although SAM-dependent MTases share little sequence identity, 29O-MTases exhibit a KDKE catalytic tetrad and a very conserved folding made of a seven-stranded b-sheet surrounded by one to three helices on each side [25] , always similar to the paradigmatic catechol-O-MTase [26] .

Crystal structures of viral RNA cap MTases exist for only three viral families, namely Poxviridae, Reoviridae, and Flaviviridae. The Vaccinia virus VP39 crystal structure was the first to be elucidated in 1996 [27] . The structure of this DNA virus RNA 29-O-MTase revealed a conserved MTase fold similar to that of RrmJ (also named FtsJ), the canonical reference folding for RNA cap MTases [26] . More recently, the crystal structure of a second Vaccinia virus N7guanine RNA cap MTase domain (D1) was determined in complex with its activator protein D12 [28] . The study revealed that D12 also bears an MTase fold, but has lost catalytic capability due to truncation of its SAM binding site. In turn, Reoviridae provided the first RNA cap MTase structures at 3.6 \u00c5 resolution as forming part of the reovirus core [29] . Another RNA cap machinery was more recently described for the non-turreted orbivirus Bluetongue virus VP4 protein at 2.5 \u00c5 resolution [30] , which revealed a three-domain protein, with a ''head'' guanylyltransferase domain, a central N7-guanine MTase, and a ''bottom'' 29-O-MTase domain. This architecture illustrates the sequence of three out of the four chemical reactions involved in RNA capping described above.",

In this paper, we report the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV 29-O-MTase nsp16 in complex with its activator, the zinc finger protein nsp10, at 2.0 \u00c5 resolution, in conjunction with mutagenesis experiments, binding and activity assays. These results lay down the structural basis for the nsp10 function as an activator of nsp16-mediated 29-O-MTase. We identify residues playing key roles in the nsp10/nsp16 interaction, as well as other residues involved in 29-O-MTase catalysis and RNA binding. We also report the crystal structure of the nsp10/ nsp16 complex bound to the inhibitor Sinefungin.

Nsp16 was well defined by its electron density except for two flexible loops (residues 19-35 and 135-137) with high B factors and weak or missing electron density. These loops are solvent-exposed at each side of the putative RNAbinding groove (see below). Structure determination data and refinement statistics are reported in Table 1 .",

The nsp10 overall structure in the complex remains essentially unchanged relative to published structures of nsp10 alone, with its N-terminus comprising two ahelices, a central b-sheet domain, and a C-terminus domain containing various loops and helices (see [20, 21] , Fig. 1B ). Comparison with existing crystal structures of nsp10 using DaliLite [41] rendered nsp10 atomic coordinates very similar to those of nsp10 in our nsp10/nsp16 complex. The average RMSD is about 0.77 \u00c5 in 118 residues (PDB codes 2FYG, 2G9T and 2GA6 [20, 21] ). This indicates that neither significant conformational change nor surface modification occurs in nsp10 when binding to nsp16.

The SAH molecule is found with its adenine in an anti conformation and the ribose pucker in a southern (29-endo/39-exo) conformation. All the residues involved in SAM/SAH binding are absolutely conserved in coronavirus np16s (Fig. S1 ). Binding specificity for SAM/SAH is achieved by holding distal SAM/SAH carboxylic and amino groups through five hydrogen bonds (G81, N43, Y47, G71, and D130) ( Fig. 3A and Fig. S2A ). The ribose moiety is held by three hydrogen bonds involving Y132, G73, and D99. As in the case of other MTases [25] , the SAH binding cleft is globally positively charged. However, an aspartic acid (D99) acts as the ribose-sensing residue with its side chain carboxyl making strong hydrogen bonds with both ribose hydroxyls (Fig. S2A) . Binding of the adenine base involves few contacts. The nucleobase occupies a loose hydrophobic pocket engaging two hydrogen bonds of moderate strength with side chain and main chain atoms of conserved residues D114 and C115, respectively.",

One metal ion (blue sphere) is found in nsp16 on the opposite face from the active site to which a SAH molecule is found (red sticks). B) Ribbon representation of nsp16, rainbow colors from N-to C-terminus. Top: Each secondary structure element is labeled according to [25] (see also Fig. S3) . The SAH molecule shown in sticks colored following atom type.

In these cases, the methylated base specificity is achieved through increased binding energy resulting from the stacking of the N7-methyl guanine between parallel aromatic residues of the cap binding protein. The presence of the methyl group greatly enhances p-p stacking, providing a dominant effect over unmethylated guanine [46] . Despite numerous attempts, cap analogues (m7GpppA, GpppA, m7GpppG, GpppG) and short capped RNA substrates (m7GpppA(C) n ) could neither be co-crystallized with nsp10/nsp16 nor soaked and bound onto preformed nsp10/nsp16 crystals. However, the atomic coordinates of the N7-methyl guanine RNA oligomer in complex with VP39 [47] provided data from which a model of RNA binding to the nsp16 protein was derived. SAM molecules identified in both structures were superimposed, and the VP39-bound RNA was positioned onto the nsp16 structure. After minimal manual adjustments not exceeding 5 \u00c5 , the VP39 RNA was a reasonably good fit into an nsp16 hydrophobic groove radiating from the catalytic site (Fig. 5) , establishing very few contacts with nsp10. We note that the protein side diametrically opposite to the proposed hydrophobic RNA binding groove is highly positively charged (not shown), an observation that may account for the difficulty of achieving experimental RNA binding in the proposed RNA binding site. In the absence of robust data to guide docking of the guanine cap, the m7Gpp cap structure was not positioned in the structure but two possible N7-methylated cap guanine binding areas are indicated by arrows (Fig. 5 ). The first transcribed nucleotide together with its ribose receiving the methyl group fit well in the active site (Fig. 5, panel B) as predicted in the proposed mechanism. The same holds for the immediately preceding three nucleotides. The base of the first transcribed nucleotide may be held by contact with P134 and Y132, bending the extending RNA cap structure. Accordingly, the substitution of Y132 greatly depresses MTase activity ( Table 2 ). We also note that Y132 is located in the vicinity of a highly mobile loop (residues 135-138) not always visible in our crystal structures suggesting that this loop may move in order to wrap the triphosphate moiety of the RNA cap and/or the RNA cap itself. The solvent exposed side chain of Y30 may also participate in RNA binding. In the model, the highly mobile side chain of Y30 was flipped out in an alternative conformation in order to open the groove. In that position, Y30 should specifically contact the third transcribed nucleotide. Our mutagenesis data confirms the importance of Y30 since its replacement with either Ala or Phe severely impairs MTase activity without affecting the interaction with nsp10 ( Table 2 ).",

Whereas T58A, G69A and H80A showed limited effect on nsp16 binding, N40A reduced it to 64% of wild type affinity, and L45A almost abrogated it.

            "text": "The Y96 position is of particular interest. Alanine substitution (Y96A) abrogates interaction whereas a phenylalanine (Y96F) increases both interaction and MTase activity [18] . In order to understand how residue 96 plays such a pivotal role, we determined at 2.0 \u00c5 resolution the crystal structure of this nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16 complex (Table 1) . Strikingly, the absence of the hydroxyl group does not alter the topology of the interface. Wild-type and Y96F residues superimpose without significant difference at all atomic positions (not shown). Either Y96 or F96 is in direct contact with nsp16 helix aZ, which carries the catalytic residue K46. Detailed surface analysis using PISA indicates that the position of K46 in Y96F nsp10 is identical to that of K46 in wild-type nsp10, ruling out a better alignment of catalytic residues of the Y96F mutant. The nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16 differs from wildtype nsp10/nsp16 in the SAH binding site, though. When compared to that of wild-type, the SAH occupancy is much lower (,0.3 versus ,1), leading to poor density definition. SAH is known to be a fairly good inhibitor of the methylation reaction. Therefore, a lower binding affinity might translate into less endproduct inhibition, and account for the observed increased activity. We measured the affinity of nsp16 for SAH using fluorescence spectroscopy, but no significant differences were found (not shown). Likewise, the MTase inhibition pattern by SAH was identical for wild-type and nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16 (not shown). We therefore infer that the previously observed ,10-fold increased stability of the heterodimer [18] may be responsible for the increased activity. A more hydrophobic character of the interaction may appear upon the loss of the tyrosine hydroxyl which, in the wild-type protein, was not engaged in any polar contact. We thus attribute the increased activity of the nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16 complex relative to wild-type to a stronger equilibrium association of nsp10(Y96F) with nsp16 than that of wild-type nsp10 with nsp16.",

When bound to nsp10, nsp16 is active as a type-0 RNA cap-dependent 29-O-MTase, ie., active only when the cap guanine is methylated at its N7 position [16] . The nsp10/nsp16 crystal structure shows that nsp16 adopts a typical fold of the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase family as defined initially for the catechol O-MTase [25] . A good alignment (170u) is found between the SAH sulfur atom, a water molecule present in both SAH-and sinefunginbound nsp16 structures, and the K46 e-amino group (Fig. 3A and  B) . This geometry provides interesting hints for a catalytic mechanism, as the positions of the catalytic residues (K46, D130, K170, E203) match spatially those of the vaccinia virus VP39 29-O-MTase [47] . At the initial stage of the reaction the 29-hydroxyl of the capped RNA substrate would occupy the position of the water molecule. In turn, E203 and K170 decrease the pKa of the K46 eamino group that becomes a deprotonated general base (-NH 2 ) able to activate the RNA 29-hydroxyl at neutral pH. In VP39, K175 has been identified as the general base catalyst [47] with a pKa depressed by , 2 pH units by the neighbouring D138 and R209 residues [48] . These findings indeed suggest a related mechanism: once K46 has activated the 29-hydroxyl group, the 29-oxygen would produce an in line attack through a SN2-like mechanism onto the electrophilic SAM methyl group. The methyl group would pass through a pentavalent intermediate with the 29-O and sulfur at apical positions. D130 is positioned to stabilize the transient positive charge on the donated methyl atom of SAM before the sulfur recovers a neutral electric charge during SAH generation (Fig. 3B) .",

Instead, the cation is coordinated through water molecules by three residues located on three distinct structural elements. It is thus possible that one divalent cation, presumably Mg 2+ , present in the host cell at millimolar levels, plays a structural role in holding these three nsp16 structural elements together and so regulate the enzyme activity. It is intriguing that T58A is more active than T58N or T58E that can still bind the water that chelates to the metal. Alternatively, it is possible that divalent cations such as Mg 2+ or Ca 2+ act as a phosphodiester charge shield to allow RNA binding in the hydrophobic binding groove [49] .",

            "text": "The main regulation mechanism of nsp16 is through its physical association with nsp10. Nsp16 is unstable in solution, and nsp10 acts as a scaffold for nsp16, yielding a stable dimer active as an RNA cap-dependent (nucleoside-29-O)-MTase. The complex is assembled through a ,890 \u00c5 2 contact surface in nsp16, an area typically in the intermediate zone differentiating strongly from weakly associated dimers [50] . This finding is consistent with a Kd estimated at ,0.8 mM [18] that qualifies the nsp10/nsp16 complex as a rather weak heterodimer. The nsp10 interaction surface identified in the crystal structure was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and overlaps that previously identified by indirect methods [18] . Remarkably, the nsp10 surface in the nsp10/nsp16 complex is essentially identical to that of uncomplexed nsp10 crystallized alone by others [20, 21] (Fig. S4) . It is therefore reasonable to see this heterodimer as a non-permanent species which would tolerate nsp10 or nsp16 engaging in interactions with other partners. This notion is actually in line with the involvement of nsp10 in a network of protein-protein interactions that we and others have proposed [17, 19] . Donaldson et al. [23] have engineered mutations in nsp10 using reverse genetics. Out of eight mutations that turned out to be in the nsp10/nsp16 interface (this work), five, two and one rendered lethal, debilitated, and viable phenotypes, respectively [23] . Interestingly, the nsp10(Q65E) mutant providing a temperature-sensitive phenotype [22, 23] does not map in the nsp10/nsp16 interface, confirming that nsp10 has a ple\u00efotropic role.",

We note that most interface mutants exhibit a severe loss of their 29-O-MTase activity, whereas the apparent association affinity is often only modestly affected. That minor changes in the interface translate into potent effects is also dramatically illustrated by the Y96F mutation, where the loss of a single hydroxyl provokes a significant change in affinity [18] . Remarkably, it is not the most active complex that was selected in nature, since the nsp10(Y96F)/nsp16 complex is both more stable and more active than the wild-type heterodimer (this work and [18] ). This is yet another observation hinting at the involvement of nsp10 in protein-protein interaction networks including other partners than nsp16, such as nsp5 and nsp14 [17, 19] . In most other coronaviruses, the nsp10 residue at position 96 is a phenylalanine. It would be interesting to determine whether this polymorphism is relevant to the SARS-CoV pathogenicity at any (direct or indirect) level, or if compensating polymorphisms in other coronaviral nsp10 (or nsp16) restore a weaker nsp10/nsp16 association equivalent to that of the SARS-CoV pair. Since a bona fide viral RNA cap is key in evading the host cell innate immunity [4, 51] , a minimal level of 29-O-MTase activity would be expected to be critical to virus survival.",

In the absence of data regarding the RNA substrate, we built a model of RNA binding based on that of the vaccinia virus VP39 ternary complex structure. Interestingly, our model proposes that the RNA interacts only with nsp16 residues, in keeping with what was recently suggested based on RNA binding assays [14] . Although the position of the cap structure on the nsp16 surface remains to be determined, our model suggests a well-defined position for the ribose of the first transcribed nucleotide in the active site. In agreement with mutagenesis analysis, the model also suggests that the transcribed RNA 59-end stacks between Y132 and Y30. Furthermore, this model is consistent with the observation that coronavirus MTase requires RNA substrates of at least 3 transcribed nucleotides in length [14] . It is also worth to know that a comparison of nsp16 and VP39 electrostatic surfaces reveals that the putative RNA-binding groove of nsp16 is mostly hydrophobic, whereas the VP39 RNA-binding groove is positively charged. This variation would imply a change in the nature of the RNA/protein interaction.",

Preliminary examination of eukaryotic non-viral MTase structures from main classes as defined in Martin and McMillan [25] indicates that the SAH adenine is bound tighter in any of the latter enzymes than in the nsp16 SAM-binding site, indicating a possible breach to achieve anti-coronavirus selectivity with a small molecule inhibitor of nsp16.",

The two structures are manually aligned using COOT [58] based on the position of SAH binding sites, as well as SAH, and Sinefungin (SFG) molecules. The RNA binding site of VP39 is only partly overlapping that of nsp16 whilst the shape of the cavity is similar; thus local adjustments necessary to accommodate the RNA molecule in its binding groove were done manually using COOT. The side chain of tyrosine 30 of nsp16initially pointed to the putative RNA binding site, preventing any bona fide modeling. In order to fit the RNA molecule in the cavity, an alternative conformation was sought for this side chain. The second most common conformation for the tyrosine side chain was selected. Due to the biochemistry data and surface electrostatic analysis, it is not possible to describe with certainty the final position of the cap, thus the cap was removed and replaced by arrows symbolizing possible positions. No other modification was performed on the RNA, the Sinefungin molecule or the nsp16 structure.",

Below dark red colored dots indicate residues involved in the interaction between nsp10 and nsp16 while green and orange dots indicate residues involved in the homomultimer in the dodecamer complex. (TIF) Table S1 Effect of alanine mutations in nsp10 interface residues. Residues were identified using PISA (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ msd-srv/prot_int/pi_link.html). Bold on grey background: strictly conserved residues amongst coronaviruses; Bold on white background: conserved a.a. (.70%) amongst coronaviruses (see Fig. S1 ). The % of Bioluminescence Resonance energy Transfer (BRET) signal was previously reported [18] . The interaction of each nsp10 or nsp16 mutant was determined using strep-tactin pull-down experiments of strep-tagged nsp10 co-expressed with nsp16 followed by SDS-PAGE analysis, and quantitation (see Methods). The interaction of wild-type nsp10 with wild-type nsp16 was normalized to 100%. The % of MTase activity was determined using filter binding assays (see Methods) relative to wild-type. (DOC)",
