Mutation in EMR2 causes complicated disorders like polycystic kidney disease (PKD). The structure of EMR2 shows that the fifth domain is comprised of EGF-TM7 helices. Functional assignment of EMR2 by support vector machine (SVM) revealed that along with transporter activity, several novel functions are predicted. A twenty amino acid sequence \"MGGRVFLVFLAFCVWLTLPG\" acts as the signal peptide responsible for posttranslational transport. Eight amino acids are involved in N-glycosylation sites and two cleavage sites are Leu517 and Ser518 in EMR2. The residue Arg241 is responsible for interaction with glycosaminoglycan and chondroitin sulfate. On the basis of structure, function and ligand binding sites, competitive EMR2 inhibitors designed may decrease the rate of human diseases like Usher's syndrome, bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria and PKD.",

GPCRs represent the largest family of cell-surface receptor molecules that are involved in signal transmission, accounting for >2% of the cellular proteins encoded by the human genome and they are the targets for 50% of all recently launched drugs [3, 4] . GPCRs are characterized by the presence of highly conserved molecular architecture encoding seven transmembrane (TM) hydrophobic regions linked by three extracellular loops that alternate with three intracellular loops as confirmed by analysis of the crystal structure of rhodopsin [5] . The extracellular N-terminus is glycosylated, and the cytoplasmic C-terminus is generally phosphorylated. The GPCR family comprises the largest family of cell-surface receptors, which can sense information encoded by diverse external stimuli and translate the encoded information into readable signals for the cell [6] .",

These receptors are characterized by an unique hybrid structure consisting of tandem repeats of EGF-like modules. It is coupled to the N-terminal family B (secretin receptor) GPCR related to the seven-transmembrane (TM7) receptor domains by a glycosylated stalk region [8, 9] . EGF-like module EMR2 receptors is predominately expressed in cells of the immune system and binds to ligands such as CD312. The EMR2 genes are predominantly expressed on dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages. The EGF-TM7 molecules belong to a large protein family known as the long N-terminal of group B transmemberane 7 (LNB-TM7) or B2 subgroup of class B GPCRs with large extracellular N-terminal domains [8] [9] . All LNB-TM7 receptors that possess large extracellular domains consisting of various protein modules are implicated in protein-protein interactions. Along with adhesion and signaling function, these molecules also participate in the interaction of the extracellular region with other cell surfaces or extracellular matrix proteins through the transmembrane domain [10] . LNB-TM7 receptors have different extracellular structural domains that are separated from the TM7 region by an extended spacer region. A subgroup of the LNB-TM7 receptors is the EGF-TM7 family [11] . Genomic mapping analysis has suggested a possible EGF-TM7 gene family on the human chromosome 19p13.1 region and possesses similar exon-intron organizations [11] or the LNB-TM7 receptors [8] that contain a large N-terminal cell adhesion-like extracellular domain coupled to a secretin receptor-like TM7 domain.",

The EGF domains of EGF-TM7 receptors have been shown to mediate binding to cellular ligands. The domain 4 of EMR2 interacts with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and chondroitin sulfate [7] . Ligand specificity for chondroitin sulfate is shared by EMR2, whose EGF domain region is highly similar to that of CD97. Only 6 out of 236 amino acids differ within the five EGF domains [9] . To date, four isoforms have been reported for EMR2, containing two (EGF1, 2), three (EGF1, 2, 5), four (EGF1, 2, 3, 5), or five (EGF1, 2, 3, 4, 5) EGF domains. Antibody-blocking studies subsequently revealed that the fourth domain of EGF-like module constitutes the major ligand-binding site [7] . The ligand for the largest isoform of EMR2 has recently been identified as chrondroitin sulphate, which binds to the EGF-like module of EMR2. It has been shown to interact with chondroitin sulfate and GAG in an isoform-specific manner [10] .",

The EGF-like domains of the full-length EMR2 protein share 97.5% sequence identity with CD97. Similar to CD97, distinct EMR2 protein isoforms consisting of different numbers of the EGF-like domains have been documented [9] . Tissue specificity of EMR2 expression is highest in peripheral blood leukocytes, followed by spleen and lymph nodes, with intermediate to low levels in the thymus, bone marrow, fetal liver, placenta and lung. The extracellular domain of EGF-TM7 receptor consists of tandem repeats of EGF-like modules followed by a Ser/Thr-rich stalk and a GPS motif [8] . The GPS motif is primarily found in members of class B2 GPCRs. These include the human polycystic kidney disease protein (PKD)-1 [12] [13] , suREJ3, a channel-like 11-span transmembrane protein [14] and hPKDREJ, the human homologue of suREJ3 [15] , suggesting that the GPS motif and its associated proteolytic cleavage activity are widely used by cell surface receptors. Although the functional significance of the GPS motif-associated proteolysis remains elusive, the presence of the highly conserved GPS motif in such a diverse array of receptors is suggestive of a common role in receptor function or regulation.",

B: A surface representation of EMR2 protein showing how the molecule is divided into a positively-charged region rich in basic residues (blue) and a negatively charged region that has negatively-charged acidic groups (Asp and Glu). The negatively charged C4-S hexasaccharide (green color) is electrostatically attracted to the positively charged region of EMR2 from the active site.",

Similarly, the 571 st -591 st and 600 th -626 th amino acids of the fifth domain participate in formation of the second and third transmembrane regions, respectively. Other amino acids 646-649, 688-710, 730-756 and 758-782 are involved in constructing the 4 th , 5 th , 6 th , and 7 th transmembrane helices of EMR2, respectively. The disulfide bond formation in different domains of EMR2 (Dipro/ SCRATCH protein predictor program) is shown in supplementary Table 1. The amino acids of the first domain are found to be involved in formation of disulfide bond at three different sites, 29-39, 33-45 and 47-65, respectively. The amino acids of the second domain of EMR2 are also involved in three disulfide bonds in regions 71-85, 79-94 and 96-117, respectively. Seven disulfide bond formation sites are found in the third domain of EMR2 and are found in residues 123-136, 130-145, 147-161, 167-180, 174-189, 191-210 and 216-229. Only one disulfide bond on residues 240-259 is present in the 4 th domain of EMR2. The last domain of EMR2 has five disulfide bonds i.e. 482-500, 492-514, 561-599, 676-693 and 743-746, respectively.",

C: Domain 3 consists of 2 antiparallel \u03b2-strands, and 3 small helices. D: Domain 4 consists of only 2 \u03b1-helices. E: Domain 5 consists of 7 transmembrane helices and 3 parallel \u03b2-strands and 11 small \u03b1-helices. fifth domain, APCC-binding destruction motifs are present. The BRCT domain of the fourth domain is associated with DNA damage response and recognizes and binds to specific phosphorylated serine sequences. PCSK cleavage site motif is present in the fifth domain of EMR2. A cyclin recognition motif that interacts with cyclin has also been detected in domain 5. FHA phosphopeptide ligand motif 1 is present in domain 5, and motif 2 is present in domain 1, 4 and 5. The FHA domain is a signal transduction module, which recognizes phosphothreonine-containing peptides on the ligand proteins. In domain 1, 4 and 5, ww ligand motifs are predicted that are implicated in protein-protein interactions mediated by WW domains. Casein kinase (CK1) phosphorylation motifs (recognized by CK1 and CK2 for Ser/Thr phosphorylation) are present in domain 1, 4 and 5. In domain 1, 4 and 5, GSK3 phosphorylation site is present and in domain 5, and 16 different patterns of this motif are present and shown inFig. 3. GSK3 comprised of two highly related proteins (GSK3-\u03b1 and GSK3-\u03b2) phosphorylates a wide variety of target proteins. N-glycosylation, a posttranslational process involving the transfer of an oligosaccharide chain to asparagine residue in the protein, is found in domain 1, 4 and 5. MAPK phosphorylation, which pro-directs kinases such as P38 MAP kinase to phosphorylate Ser/Thr in various sig-nal transduction pathways. Domain 4 and 5 contain the phosphorylation motifs of phosphoinositide-3-OHkinase related kinases (PI3KKs), which are atypical protein kinases exclusive to eukaryotes.",
