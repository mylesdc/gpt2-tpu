The simple negative staining technique of DEM was applied widely to smallpox diagnosis until the world-wide eradication of the human-specific pathogen in 1980. Since then, the threat of smallpox re-emerging through laboratory escape, molecular manipulation, synthetic biology or bioterrorism has not totally disappeared and would be a major problem in an unvaccinated population. Other animal poxviruses may also emerge as human pathogens. With its rapid results (only a few minutes after arrival of the specimen), no requirement for specific reagents and its \"open view,\" DEM remains an important component of virus diagnosis, particularly because it can easily and reliably distinguish smallpox virus or any other member of the orthopoxvirus (OPV) genus from parapoxviruses (PPV) and the far more common and less serious herpesviruses (herpes simplex and varicella zoster). Preparation, enrichment, examination, internal standards and suitable organisations are discussed to make clear its continuing value as a diagnostic technique.",

That it could be of practical use is illustrated by the following episode. In the 1960s, before smallpox had been eradicated from the world, an adult male was found in the busy out-patient department (OPD) of a major London hospital late on a Friday where he had been all afternoon. He said he had just returned from East Africa where smallpox was still endemic and claimed that he had had chickenpox as a child and that he had not been vaccinated. The staff of the OPD were faced with a man with a widespread vesicular skin rash and a slight fever and a dilemma-was this a case of smallpox? Should they alert the media to warn everyone who had been in the OPD to contact their own doctor over the weekend, or was there a way to defuse the situation quickly? One of us (DM), as an electron microscopist at a different London hospital, was telephoned to ask if a quick diagnosis could be made. After advice about collecting specimens, a taxi arrived soon afterwards and a doctor from the other hospital got out, carrying a small syringe containing fluid aspirated from the patient's vesicles as if it was an unexploded bomb.",

Smallpox, caused by the variola virus, has been eradicated as an endemic pathogen from the world's population since 1980 [1] but stocks of the virus remain under WHO supervision under high-security at the CDC (Centers for Disease Control & Prevention), Atlanta, USA, and at VECTOR (State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology), Koltsovo-Novosibirsk, Russia, for further research. Nevertheless, some variola virus may yet remain elsewhere, forgotten in a deep-freeze [9] or as dried crusts, and escape, or a virulent variant may be generated through laboratory molecular manipulation. Other viruses also cause vesicular lesions which may mimic smallpox. In addition, other micro-organisms (including several virus families) or some non-infective conditions may cause similar skin lesions as listed in Tables 1 and 2.

Two virus species of the order Herpesvirales-varicella zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae-frequently cause infections in man. VZV is the cause of the common, and usually mild, chickenpox in children ( Figure 10 ). During the primary infection, VZV enters the sensory root ganglia of the central nervous system where it remains dormant and may emerge again later as shingles (herpes zoster), as shown in Figure 11 . This is usually limited to the distribution of one or two sensory nerves, as a painful vesicular eruption with, occasionally, a viral encephalitis. In contrast, there are two types of HSV-Type 1 causes small numbers of vesicles, often on the lips, as Cold Sores (Figure 12 ), while type 2 is a genital infection. Generally, type 1 occurs above the waist and type 2 below (genital infection, sexually transmitted) but either may be found anywhere on the body. Both infections are normally benign, though irritating to the patient, and often recur. The virions of the two types are indistinguishable by EM. In the immunocompromised, however, both VZV and HSV may cause serious life-threatening infections ( Figure 13 ). Herpesvirus particles contain an icosahedral capsid core, 110 nm in diameter, which contains the DNA genome. This capsid is readily identifiable by its size and shape (Figure 6b The Herpesviruses. Two virus species of the order Herpesvirales-varicella zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae-frequently cause infections in man.

In the immunocompromised, however, both VZV and HSV may cause serious life-threatening infections ( Figure 13 ). Herpesvirus particles contain an icosahedral capsid core, 110 nm in diameter, which contains the DNA genome. This capsid is readily identifiable by its size and shape (Figures 6b, 10-12 , 14e,f and 13b,c) and is surrounded by an amorphous protein coat called the \"tegument\" and a loosely fitting envelope, 150-180 nm in diameter. The electron-dense stain used in DEM preparation often penetrates the capsid, giving a dark, \"empty\" appearance. The clinical appearances of chickenpox, shingles and cold sores, with their associated viruses, are shown in Figures 10-13 . The envelope is studded with fuzzy surface projections. Underneath the lipid bilayer the ill-defined tegument and the slightly angular cores are seen. The latter contains the electron-dense viral genome. A hydrophilic EM support grid is placed on a droplet of the diagnostic suspension (left) and after 30 s of adsorption is transferred quickly onto a series of droplets of distilled water to remove interfering salts, and then onto a droplet of \"stain\". The \"stains\" used are electron-dense solutions: 0.5 to 2.0 percent of a heavy metal salt, such as PTA, routinely buffered to pH 7.2 (may be used between pH 5 to pH 9), UAc, unbuffered at a pH around 4.2, or other stains can be used. During a short, 5-10 s staining step, the stain does not react with the chemical moieties of the biologicals on the grid, i.e., there is no \"positive staining\" effect as there is in thin section-TEM. This rapid process results in \"negative contrast\", as the transparent biological structures of the sample, after drying, are closely surrounded by the electron-dense stain.

If a smallpox-like disease occurred, there would be a need to establish a safe and certain diagnosis without delay-either it is variola (or a close relative), or another skin infection unlikely to cause an epidemic. The chance of variola virus being the cause may now be very small but is not non-existent [5, 11] . A rapid diagnosis will be required and virologists must be able to provide it. This paper explains why electron microscopy should remain an indispensable constituent of diagnostic virology.",

With the development of more advanced and easy to use electron microscopes and the negative contrast technique by Brenner & Horne in 1959, DEM was subsequently applied widely and successfully to smallpox diagnosis [1, 48, [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . Although poxviruses were first visualized 80 years ago [59] , the principle of DEM, the rapid visualization of known and unknown agents using simple and rapid preparation techniques, is still valid. Automated pattern recognition techniques are being developed and, supported by telemicroscopy, they could help to spread the global availability of DEM [60] [61] [62] [63] . The relative lack of sensitivity by DEM can be partially corrected by using immune EM; broadly reactive hyper-immune sera as well as monospecific antibodies are available and can be used to advantage [64] [65] [66] .",

The practical limits of resolution of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) on biological material is 2 nm, allowing the fine structures of any virus particles to be clearly visible. With this level of resolution, DEM is a catch-all method, able to detect unexpected viruses and other agents including bacteria and some parasites. DEM offers both speed and diagnostic certainty [46, 64, [68] [69] [70] 73, 75, 76, [84] [85] [86] , while also allowing some of the other possible causes to be confidently discarded.",

However, in contrast to these point-of-care systems, dedicated high tech methods like DEM will only be found in a small number of sites, mostly in universities and in centralized national facilities for cost and organisational reasons, but the \"open view\" of DEM is a valuable defence against the unexpected and, occasionally, double infections.

TS-TEM can also be used in DEM, but preparing thin sections is more complex and more time-consuming (for details see [65, 74, [89] [90] [91] ), making the simple NS the preferable method for DEM.

Open the surface of a vesicle using a sterile (injection) needle. Collect fluid into a fine glass tube by capillary attraction and close the tube at both ends with dental wax. The wax is removed later in a Laminar Flow Safety Cabinet and the fluid is carefully expelled onto a sheet of Parafilm TM using a small rubber bulb on the \"clean\" end of the capillary. 3. Open the vesicle as in 2 above. Press the middle of a sterile glass light microscopic slide onto the fluid, remove the slide, let it dry, and mark it on the reverse where the droplet has dried to make finding the sample easier. Place the slide in a Petri dish for transport. To protect the dried fluid during transport, two matchsticks are placed as spacers at the ends of the sample slide which is then covered with another plain slide. Both slides are then bound together using an elastic band at each end. 4 .

The washing steps are helpful in getting an even distribution of stain on the grid. However, each washing step will appreciably reduce the number of particles on the grid. 3. Before staining with UAc, the grid with adherent specimen material must be washed on 3-5 droplets of distilled water to remove interfering phosphate ions. Successful NS with PTA does not require extensive washing; washing on a single droplet will suffice. 4. While checking the first grid in the TEM, the remaining specimen, the washing and stain droplets are left on the Parafilm TM , protected from dust and drying in the wet chamber. This helps to shorten preparation time in case further preparations, possibly stained differently, are needed. 5. Viruses and other biologicals will concentrate at the interface between the air and the sample fluid [103] . Letting the sample droplet remain untouched for a few minutes (or even longer, e.g., overnight at 4 \u2022 C in the refrigerator, if found necessary) before the grid is placed onto it for adsorption can help with low-concentration samples. 6. With sample volumes below 5 \u00b5L the sample may be placed directly onto the grid\u00b4s surface for adsorption. 7. While PTA staining tends to make biological structures more labile and porous, UAc is both a stain and a fixative [104] .

Today, emergencies demanding DEM are uncommon and a full-time commitment may not be necessary; it can be part-time and can be run in parallel with other activities, e.g., academic structural research and education or with other types of routine DEM, e.g., Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) control of production processes. Likewise, Centralized Imaging Facilities at Universities can also take on DEM when, in an emergency, a rapid catch-all diagnosis is required. In addition, DEM will help to shorten cell culture investigations in novel situations, as happened in 2003 during the SARS outbreak. DEM must be part of frontline defences and success is guaranteed only with good collaboration, such as in the Laboratory Response Network in the US and quality control measures in Germany [97, 109, 110] .",
