Multiple common viral respiratory diseases (CVRDs) cause huge economic losses in the poultry industry. The prevalence of CVRDs in many countries, including Pakistan, is not clearly understood. Results: Incidences of 5 chicken respiratory viruses: avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV/AAVV-1), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) and infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) were assessed on commercial Pakistani farms with respiratory problems from 2014 through to 2016. While AIV and AAVV-1 were frequently detected (16 to 17% of farms), IBV and aMPV were rarely detected (in 3 to 5% of farms) and ILTV was not detected. We characterized H9 AIV of the G1 lineage, genotype VII AAVV-1, GI-13 IBV, and type B aMPV strains with very little genetic variability in the 2-year study period. Co-infections with AIV and AAVV-1 were common and wild type AAVV-1 was detected despite the use of vaccines. Control measures to limit the virus burden in chicken flocks are discussed.",

Further studies are necessary to assess circulating strains, economic losses caused by infections and coinfections of these pathogens, and the costs and benefits of countermeasures. Furthermore, veterinarians and farmers should be informed of the pathogens circulating in the field and hence advised on the use of vaccines.",

            "text": "Commercial poultry in Pakistan was established in the early 1960s, representing one of the largest agriculturebased segments of Pakistan's economy with a significant contribution to national gross domestic product (1.3%) [1] . There are over 25,000 poultry farms spread across the country's rural areas and the Pakistan poultry industry produces around 1220 million kg of chicken meat and 10,000 million eggs a year [2] . In the past, regional studies on poultry disease surveillance and clinical surveys have been conducted to better understand the disease distribution pattern in different regions of Pakistan [3] [4] [5] . Recently, outbreaks of viral diseases with high morbidity and mortality were being reported consistently [6] [7] [8] and are possibly due to the intensification of commercial poultry production and lack of biosecurity measures. Pakistan's poultry industry has indeed been growing continuously, facilitating the spread of multiple common viral respiratory diseases (CVRDs) such as Newcastle disease (ND), infectious bronchitis (IB), swollen head syndrome (SHS), infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) infections, which are caused by Avian Avulavirus 1 (AAVV-1), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) and avian influenza virus (AIV), respectively. These are highly contagious diseases of poultry, with worldwide distribution and they have serious economic impacts on the poultry industry. The causative agents of these diseases affect chickens of all ages except ILTV, which normally does not affect chickens before 3 weeks of age. These pathogens may interact with bacterial agents resulting in high morbidity and mortality in the infected chickens [9] . The continuous emergence of new virulent genotypes from global epidemics and the frequent changes observed in the genomic sequence of these viruses lead to ineffective diagnostics and control measures. Outbreaks of CVRDs such as IB and SHS are not reported to the country's ministry in charge of livestock and poultry production. Consequently, the distribution patterns of such chicken diseases are unclear in Pakistan [3] . Moreover, CVRDs, such as LPAI (H9N2), are of great significance to public health due to their zoonotic potential [10] [11] [12] . Therefore, it is important to investigate the distribution pattern of CVRDs in different regions and different chicken production types to develop scientific and riskbased prevention measures of these poultry diseases.",

This work focused on the prevalence and molecular AIV has been frequently reported in Pakistan since 1994. LPAI H9N2, LPAI and HPAI H7N3 and HPAI H5N1 viruses have been regularly identified. Two LPAI H4N6 viruses from 2010 and 2011 have been isolated and sequenced. LPAI H9N2 and HPAI H7N3 were isolated from the same flock in 2003 [13] and since then frequent reassortment events between H7N3, H5N1 and H9N2 have been reported [10, 14] . Recently, H9N2 virus was isolated in 5.7% of 905 tested flocks of commercial and backyard poultry in Pakistan. Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase-gene-based phylogenetic analysis of commercial and backyard poultry isolates showed 100% homology within sub-lineage B2 of Pakistan [11] . The G1-like viruses detected here were closely related to previously characterized strains from Libya, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Considering the geographic proximity of these countries and the commercial exchanges, it is not surprising that these strains were detected in Pakistan.",

It would be interesting to conduct further molecular characterization to confirm that only H9 is present, link clinical signs to genes constellations, and to better understand the role of molecular determinants of field pathogenicity of currently circulating H9 viruses in unvaccinated flocks. Unfortunately, the method used to collect samples did not allow the isolation of the viruses. This resulted in limited nucleic acid quantities that did not allow for the amplification of more than the HA2 part of the genome. Similarly, only partial gene sequences were obtained for AAVV-1, IBV, and aMPV. Regardless, the circulating subtypes/genotypes of chicken viruses in Pakistan were as follows: genotype VII AAVV-1 (VIIi), GI-13 (793B) IBV and genotype B aMPV, with no difference from the summer of 2014 through to January 2016.",

The AAVV-1 species include multiple strains of avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1) virus. APMV-1 is of particular importance to poultry due to virulent strains which cause Newcastle disease, often referred to as Newcastle disease viruses (AAVV-1 s). At least two classes and 18 genotypes of AAVV-1 have been described. Despite the use of imported vaccines, AAVV-1 still remains the main poultry disease in both commercial and rural chickens flocks of Pakistan [15] . Recently, AAVV-1 s of genotype VI, VII and XIII were detected in Pakistani poultry [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] and genotype VII is predominant across the country. Similarly, Miller et al. [24] reported that viruses of sub-genotype VIIi have replaced AAVV-1 isolates of genotype XIII in Pakistan, The viruses of genotype VII had a high genetic diversity as compared to isolates from genotypes VI and XIII and, therefore, have more potential to evolve over a period of time [25] . Partial sequences for the F gene were used for construction of phylogeny tree, which is a clear limitation of this study. Full F gene sequences would allow for a more detailed phylogeny of circulating strains of AAVV-1 in Pakistan.",

Massachusetts strains (such as M41) are mainly used as vaccines in the field in Pakistan but we cannot totally rule out the use of 4-91 vaccines due to the limited control of imported vaccines. Similarly, high prevalence of IBV in backyard poultry (74%) and commercial poultry of Bangladesh (57%) were reported [26] . Sumi et al. [27] classified Indian IBV isolates based on phylogenetic analysis within the Mass genotype (India/LKW/56/IVRI/08, now called GI-1) and the 793/B genotype (or 4-91 genotype, India/NMK/72/IVRI/10, now called GI-13). Moreover, IBV viruses of genotype 793/B-like (GI-13) and QX-like (GI-19) have been reported recently in poultry of Iran and Iraq [28, 29] . Considering the geographic proximity of the 5 countries and the commercial exchanges, it is not surprising that 793/B (GI-13) strains were detected in Pakistan.",

The AAVV-1 vaccines used in Pakistan are the LaSota (genotype II) and R2B (mesogenic Mukteswar strain, genotype III) strains. Field AAVV-1 detected in the present study (genotype VII) were therefore not vaccine viruses. The LaSota vaccine is formulated from a lentogenic (low virulence) clone of the LaSota strain and is manufactured in different countries around the world. The vaccine is imported to Pakistan and administered to commercial poultry flocks. In contrast, the R2B strain is manufactured by local vaccine companies and administered to backyard poultry. It is still unknown whether these vaccine strains (genotypes II and III viruses) can elicit a protective immune response against the prevailing field strains, especially genotype VII viruses: the protection should be evaluated in experimental and field conditions. Furthermore, the inability of live vaccines to elicit a protective immune response might be due to an inadequate cold chain supply system, inappropriate route of vaccination, or incorrect vaccination schedules. It has been reported that the currently applied AAVV-1 vaccines give better protection against the velogenic AAVV-1 s isolated from the 1930s through to the 1970s (Herts33/56, California 71) than those more recently isolated [38] . Hence parameters for selection of vaccine strains need to be reconsidered. Likewise, the optimization of vaccination schedules according to local climate and environmental conditions should be investigated.",

In total, 161 samples were collected. Sampling areas were chosen based on poultry population size: the selected sampling area is Pakistan's main poultry producing region (with more than 50% of the country's poultry farms, [42, 43] , (Dr. Umar and Bin Aslam, personal communications). Farms were selected based on reports of clinical respiratory signs from the farmers to their veterinarians. The reported clinical signs were as follows (at least 2 signs needed to be included in the study): mortality, and/or drop in egg production, and/or drop in feed and water consumption, and/or nasal/eye discharge, and/or labored breathing, and/or gasping. Birds were sampled by trained personnel (a veterinarian with the help of the farmers who were trained on this occasion on how to swab birds) and flocks were excluded when the onset of clinical signs was observed more than 4 days prior to the visit. Farms were sampled once only (no repeated sampling). Oropharyngeal swabs or tissue impression smears (trachea, lungs) from birds showing respiratory signs were blotted onto Finders Technology Associates (FTA\u00ae) sampling cards (Whatman, Inc., Clifton, NJ). The FTA cards were allowed to air dry and were stored at 4\u00b0C until further processing. Age, flock size and health status are summarized in Table 1 . For each flock, 1 or 2 FTA cards were used, and 10 swabs were blotted on each FTA card at the farm (one sample number refers to a pool of 10 swabs from symptomatic birds in a given flock, Table 1 ) to detect a prevalence of \u22650.14 to \u22650.28% for each virus per flock (for flocks of 2500 to 10,000 birds with a 95% confidence level). According to the farmers' information, some of the farms had been vaccinated against ND, infectious bursal disease and/ or IB, but none of the farms visited had been vaccinated against aMPV or ILTV (Table 1) .",

Real-time (RT-)PCRs were then carried out to compare the extracted material and the results were as follows: (i) extracting ILTV DNA with the QIAamp viral RNA isolation kit resulted in a loss of 1 Ct value (a twofold difference in viral DNA copies), as compared to the DNA isolated with the DNA extraction kit; (ii) extracting IBDV RNA with the Qiagen DNA extraction kit resulted in a loss of 3 Ct values (a tenfold difference in viral RNA copies), as compared to the RNA isolated with the RNA extraction kit. We therefore considered that the loss of sensitivity in detecting the DNA virus was negligible and that we could use the QIAamp Viral RNA isolation kit to extract both RNA and DNA. Viral RNA and DNA from FTA cards were therefore extracted using the QIAamp\u00ae viral RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA/DNA was eluted in 50 \u03bcL elution buffer and stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C until further use.",

Briefly, 5 \u03bcL of total RNA was mixed with random hexamer primers (0.3 \u03bcg/\u03bcL) and incubated for 5 min at 65\u00b0C. Then, 4 \u03bcL of 5x reaction buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA), 0.5 \u03bcL of RNase Out (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), 2 \u03bcL of 10 mmol/L deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) solution (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), and 1 \u03bcL of RevertAid reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA) were added. Water was added to reach a final reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL. The RT reaction was completed following 10 min at 25\u00b0C then 60 min at 42\u00b0C, and finally 10 min at 70\u00b0C. cDNA was used as the template for PCR amplification. The primers and PCR conditions used for the detection of AAVV-1, IBV, aMPV (types A and B), ILTV, and AIV are listed in Table 2 . Two different Taq DNA Polymerases were used in this study (Qiagen Taq DNA polymerase, Germany, for the 2014 samples; and Kapa biosystems, Inc. MA, for the 2015-2016 samples). All PCR programs were performed with a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA). PCR amplicons were analysed using 1.5% agarose gels (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium), containing nucleic acid stain (SYBR\u00ae Safe DNA gel stain, ThermoFisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA) and using 1 \u00d7 TBE as electrophoresis running buffer. Bands sizes were compared to a commercially available 100 bp ladder (Bioline HyperLadder\u2122 100 bp). Attenuated live vaccine viruses: Newcastle Disease Vaccine B1 Type LaSota Strain (Merial) for AAVV-1, MassH120 (Bioral H120) for IBV, Nobilis TRT (MSD) for aMPV, and A/turkey/Italy/977/99(H7N1) for AIV were used as positive controls.
