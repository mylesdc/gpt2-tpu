However, the mechanisms involved in neutrophil transmigration, location and accumulation in the ischemic brain are not fully elucidated. Neutrophils can reach the perivascular spaces of brain vessels after crossing the endothelial cell layer and endothelial basal lamina of post-capillary venules, or migrating from the leptomeninges following pial vessel extravasation and/or a suggested translocation from the skull bone marrow. Based on previous observations of microglia phagocytosing neutrophils recruited to the ischemic brain lesion, we hypothesized that microglial cells might control neutrophil accumulation in the injured brain. We studied a model of permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in mice, including microglia-and neutrophil-reporter mice. Using various in vitro and in vivo strategies to impair microglial function or to eliminate microglia by targeting colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), this study demonstrates that microglial phagocytosis of neutrophils has fundamental consequences for the ischemic tissue. We found that reactive microglia engulf neutrophils at the periphery of the ischemic lesion, whereas local microglial cell loss and dystrophy occurring in the ischemic core are associated with the accumulation of neutrophils first in perivascular spaces and later in the parenchyma. Accordingly, microglia depletion by long-term treatment with a CSF1R inhibitor increased the numbers of neutrophils and enlarged the ischemic lesion. Hence, microglial phagocytic function sets a critical line of defense against the vascular and tissue damaging capacity of neutrophils in brain ischemia.",

            "text": "Neutrophil infiltration under conditions of sterile inflammation can contribute to tissue injury. Neutrophils are transiently detected in the brain after stroke since they are rapidly attracted to the injured brain peaking between 1 and 3 days post-ischemia [10, 23, 24, 51] . Compelling evidence suggests that neutrophils are contributors to tissue damage after ischemic stroke [35, 44, 51, 61, 64] , in spite of the fact that diverse experimental strategies inhibiting neutrophil activation or depleting neutrophils provided conflicting results [16, 61] . Likely, the differences between experimental studies depend on the efficacy and potential side effects of the diverse neutrophil depleting or inhibiting strategies, status of capillary reperfusion, lesion severity, and integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Moreover, several aspects of neutrophil infiltration after acute ischemic brain damage remain controversial. Neutrophils accumulate in perivascular spaces in murine and human strokes [17, 55] . The presence of neutrophils in the brain parenchyma has been reported in rodent models of permanent ischemia [23, 51, 55] , but it is more controversial in experimental models of transient ischemia [17, 64] . Several studies reported the presence of neutrophils in the brain parenchyma in postmortem samples of patients deceased between day 1 and 5 [55] , or 3 days after stroke onset but not at other time points [56, 76] . In other studies, neutrophils were not detected in the brain parenchyma of stroke patients [17] . Therefore, the molecular determinants underlying perivascular neutrophil accumulation and the conditions facilitating the potential access of neutrophils to the brain parenchyma need further clarification.",

            "text": "The observation that microglia phagocytose neutrophils in the ischemic brain [50] [51] [52] led us to hypothesize that microglia function may be critical to explain neutrophil accumulation in the injured brain tissue. Microglial cells react to brain ischemia in different ways depending on the regional location and temporal course of the lesion. Microglial cells are vulnerable to ischemia and previous reports showed death of microglia after oxygen and glucose deprivation in tissue slices [18] and cell cultures [41, 73] . In addition, microglial reduction has been reported after transient MCAo [43] , and microglial dysfunction and loss was detected in classical neuropathological studies of brain ischemia in rodents and primates [3, 4] . Classical histopathological studies have shown long-lasting microgliosis surrounding the infarction several days after ischemic stroke onset. However, the progression of this reaction from the very acute phase of stroke is less precisely determined mainly due to the fact that microglia and infiltrating macrophages show many common features and markers leading to the frequent terminology of microglia/macrophages to describe the mononuclear myeloid cell reaction that follows stroke. Microglia have a unique transcriptomic signature distinguishable from that of macrophages or monocytes [7, 32] . Therefore, reactive microglia and infiltrating macrophages likely play different functions in the injured brain tissue. Current developments allow the distinction between these cells with antibodies against more specific microglia markers [1, 7] , availability of fluorescent reporter mice [74] , or transfer of fluorescent reporter leukocytes [46] . By exploiting some of these novel experimental possibilities, we investigated the neutrophil-microglia crosstalk after brain ischemia. The results show that microglial cells effectively remove brain-infiltrating neutrophils, hence microglia dysfunction or death is associated with neutrophil accumulation into the injured brain tissue.",

Next, we analysed microglia morphology (Online Resource 4) in the contralateral hemisphere, and in different zones of the ipsilateral hemisphere, i.e. periphery and infarcted core, 4 days after MCAo (Fig. 2c-h) . Shape descriptors showed increased circularity and reduced area of microglia in the ipsilateral hemisphere that was more marked in cells located in the core region (Fig. 2c, d) . A Sholl analysis showed that ischemia reduced the number of ramifications, and maximal intersections per microglial cell, and again the changes were greater in the core (Fig. 2e, f) . Analysis of 3D-reconstructions of the cells showed a reduced volume and higher sphericity index after ischemia, particularly in the core (Fig. 2g, h) . Furthermore, the quantification of cells per area showed that while microglial cell density increased in the periphery, it was reduced in the core of the lesion (Fig. 2i) . This result was confirmed by flow cytometry after excising the core and periphery of the ipsilateral hemisphere and mirror regions of the contralateral hemisphere 1 and 4 days after MCAo. Microglia cell number was severely reduced in the core of the lesion at 1 and 4 days post-ischemia (Fig. 2j) . Altogether, these findings show that microglial cells are sensitive to persistent ischemic conditions and are lost in the infarcted core.

By cell counting, we calculated that 26.8 \u00b1 8.8% (mean \u00b1 SD, n = 3 mice) of the microglial cells at the periphery of infarction incorporated BrdU suggesting microglial proliferation, in agreement with previous reports [14, 40] . In contrast, microglial cells were BrdU \u2212 in the contralateral non-ischemic hemisphere. Notably, BrdU was found in ramified microglial cells suggesting that microglia could undergo cell division without regression of their differentiation status. We extended the results to the human brain by showing an increased number of microglial cells and proliferating Ki67 + microglia at the periphery of infarction in post-mortem human brain tissue of stroke patients (Fig. 3d-g) . We also found reduced microglial cell numbers in the lesion core of stroked human brains (Fig. 3d) thus supporting that the findings in mice might be relevant to human stroke.",

Furthermore, we detected microglial processes surrounding DsRed + cells suggestive of engulfment of leukocytes (Fig. 4a-c; Online Resource 6). 3D-reconstructions of confocal images showed phagosomes completely wrapping DsRed + leukocytes (Fig. 4b, c) . The CSF1R signaling pathway is critical for survival of microglia and maintenance of their functions [2] , including endocytic processes [60] . Consequently, by interfering with microglial function after oral administration of the CSF1R inhibitor GW2580 [12] for 4 days, we found more DsRed + cells at the periphery of infarction not surrounded by microglia or in apparent contact with microglia, suggesting that microglia dysfunction impaired the process of phagocytosis of leukocytes (Fig. 4d) .",

We isolated microglia from adult mouse brains, cultured the cells in vitro for 7 days, and exposed them to freshly isolated bone marrow neutrophils (stained with CMFDA) to study phagocytosis. Microglial cells phagocytosed neutrophils in vitro (Fig. 6a, b , and timelapse microscopy movie in Online Resource 8). By following neutrophil trajectories along time (time-lapse microscopy movie in Online Resource 9), we counted the number of neutrophils phagocytosed by microglia. We validated that allogenicity in the phagocytosis experimental design was not interfering with the assay by comparing phagocytosis of neutrophils obtained from different mice with the phagocytosis of neutrophils from the same mouse. We found no differences, ruling out prime effects of allogenicity in the Fig. 4 Microglia cells phagocytose infiltrating DsRed leukocytes. a-c Chimeric mice were generated by bone marrow transfer from donor DsRed mice to recipient wild type mice and were subjected to ischemia (n = 5).

Magnified details of engulfed DsRed cells are shown on the right hand side. f DsRed chimeric mice received oral administration of either the CSF1R inhibitor GW2580 or the vehicle (n = 5 per group) starting 2 h prior to MCAo and then daily for 3 days. The brain was studied 4 days post-ischemia by immunofluorescence using anti-P2RY12 antibody to label microglia (green), DsRed for infiltrating leukocytes, and To-Pro-3 for staining the cell nuclei (blue). The image shows a microglial cell at the periphery of infarction engulfing DsRed leukocytes. Schematic representation of this cell illustrating: (A) a DsRed cell completely surrounded by a microglial process; (B) a microglial process making apparent contact with a DsRed leukocyte (touching); and (C) a Dsred leukocyte separated from microglia (free). Counting the number of DsRed cells in the above status (A-C) in relation to microglia showed that the CSF1R inhibitor increased (***p < 0.001) the number of free DsRed cells. Two-way ANOVA by treatment and condition followed by the Bonferroni test. Scale bar corresponds to a, b 5 \u00b5m; c 10 \u00b5m for left image and 5 \u00b5m for the magnifications on the right; d 10 \u00b5m \u25c2 phagocytosis of neutrophils by microglia (Online Resource 10). Given that we observed signs of impaired phagocytosis of neutrophils in vivo after ischemia in mice after shortterm treatment with a CSF1R inhibitor (Fig. 4d) , we investigated in vitro the role of CSF1R in this process. To this end, we obtained microglia from adult mice with heterozygous CSF1R +/\u2212 microglia (obtained by crossing CX3CR1 cre/ ERT2 with CSF1R flox/+ mice). Less neutrophils were phagocytosed by CSF1R +/\u2212 microglia compared to CSF1R +/+ microglia, as assessed by time-lapse microscopy where we counted the neutrophils phagocytosed by microglia during the 14-h duration of the experiment (Fig. 6c ). In addition, CSF1R +/\u2212 microglia showed reduced phagocytic activity in a phagocytosis assay with fluorescent beads (Fig. 6d-f ). We then studied the potential relevance of these findings for human cells by obtaining human microglia from the post-mortem brain of an ischemic stroke patient deceased 5 days after stroke onset. After maintaining the human cells in culture for 7 days, we exposed the cells to neutrophils obtained from blood of a donor control subject. We observed very active phagocytosis of neutrophils (Fig. 6g, h and timelapse microscopy movie in Online Resource 11). By immunofluorescence after the ex vivo assay, we detected P2RY12 expression in the cells and observed that they contained material from neutrophils (Fig. 6i) .",

PLX5622 diet caused a strong reduction (90%) of the microglia population (Fig. 8a ) but did not affect blood leukocyte counts (Online Resource 12 shows the gating strategy and cell quantifications are shown in Online Resource 13), in agreement with previous reports [20, 70] . However, we detected a reduction of a minor subset of blood Ly6C \u2212 monocytes (Online Resource 13), which is dependent on CSF1R [39] . In brain tissue, PLX5622 diet reduced the numbers of infiltrating monocytes (40%) and F4/80 + macrophages (60%) versus the control diet 4 days post-ischemia (Online Resource 14), in agreement with previous findings suggesting a role for microglia in the recruitment of monocytes into the brain [20] . In contrast, the PLX5622 diet increased the numbers of neutrophils in the brain tissue after ischemia, as assessed by flow cytometry at day 4 (Fig. 8b) . Immunofluorescence in CX3CR1 cre/ERT2 :R26-tdT mice showed extravasated neutrophils that seemed more abundant in the absence of microglia (Fig. 8c, d) . By counting the number of neutrophils located either in the parenchyma or associated with blood vessels (hence not crossing the parenchymal basal lamina) we found an increase in the percentage of parenchymal neutrophils in the absence of microglia 1 and 4 days post-ischemia (Fig. 8e) .

            "text": "This study supports the concept that microglia phagocytose and remove neutrophils after brain ischemia [14, [50] [51] [52] and demonstrates that neutrophil accumulation in the brain parenchyma is associated with reduced microglial phagocytic activity, attributable to ischemia-induced microglial cell dysfunction due to loss or dystrophy. Morphometric analysis of microglia showed changes in the periphery of the lesion compatible with microglial reactivity and similar to those reported [27] . Overall, morphological changes of microglia within the lesion core were larger than in the periphery, for instance regarding the notable loss of ramifications and reduced cell size. Such profound morphological changes of microglia in the lesion core might indicate a further process of transformation from reactive microglia to dystrophic microglia, potentially associated with cell dysfunction. Furthermore, we found reduced microglial cell numbers in the core of infarction. While our results support microglial degeneration in the infarcted core, microglial cells proliferated and accumulated at the periphery of infarction in mouse and human brain, in agreement with previous findings in the mouse brain [14, 40] . These reactive microglial cells at the periphery of infarction phagocytosed neutrophils, suggesting that the phagocytic activity of microglia prevented neutrophil accumulation in this region. Accordingly, the numbers of neutrophils were higher in the core than the periphery of the lesion. Microglial activity and survival are critically dependent on CSF1R [12] . Consequently, drug-induced inhibition of CSF1R or genetic reduction of CSF1R expression in microglia impaired their phagocytic capacity in vivo and in vitro. Previous studies reported that CSF-1 promotes phagocytosis of Ab1-42 peptide by primary human microglia in vitro [62] , and it regulates cell motility in macrophages [58] . CSF1R is a tyrosine kinase that upon activation shows phosphorylation of several intracellular tyrosine residues [77] . Upon activation, CSF1R associates with several signaling molecules, notably phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) [58] . CSF1R also activates Akt [11] , and it induces ERK1/2-mediated signaling in microglia [9] . Akt [22, 67] and ERK1/2 [19] are involved in the phagocytic process. However, the specific signaling molecules downstream of CSF1R participating in phagocytosis in microglia after brain ischemia, and the precise step(s) of the phagocytic process affected by CSFR1 remain to be identified. Microglia depletion induced by long-term inhibition of CSF1R in vivo [15, 33, 65, 69] increased the numbers of neutrophils in the ischemic brain tissue, further supporting the view that microglial cells contribute to neutrophil removal.",

            "text": "Neutrophils are attracted to the injured brain after acute stroke [10, 23, 30, 31, 50, 51] . Thereby, neutrophils adhere to venules and migrate through the vessel wall to reach perivascular spaces [17] . In addition, neutrophils access perivascular spaces of penetrating cortical vessels from the leptomeninges [55] . Accumulation of neutrophils in the leptomeninges might be due to extravasation from pial vessels. In addition, neutrophil migration from the skull bone marrow through direct anatomic connections [29] might explain the presence of neutrophils in the subarachnoid space, although migration of neutrophils from there to perivascular spaces of cortical vessels still needs further investigation. Subpial neutrophils are separated from the brain parenchyma by the basement membrane and glia limitans. Likewise, the parenchymal basal lamina and surrounding astrocyte end-feet separate perivascular cells from the brain parenchyma. Interestingly, we observed ramifications of microglial cells apparently crossing the basal lamina suggesting the possibility that reactive microglia might sample the perivascular space and also the subpial space after brain ischemia. Using intravital Fig. 6 Microglia phagocytose neutrophils in vitro under the control of microglial CSF1R expression. Microglial cells were obtained from adult mice (a-f) or a human stroke patient deceased 5 days after ischemic stroke (g-i). After 7 days in culture, the cells were exposed to corresponding control mouse or human neutrophils and studied by time-lapse confocal microscopy for 14 h. a, b Microglia were obtained from DsRed mice (red) and neutrophils were stained with CMFDA (green). 3D-reconstructions of image sequences (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) of the time-lapse video (see supplementary video 3 and 4) illustrating the phagocytosis of neutrophils by mouse microglia (a). The time point of each image is indicated (hours:minutes). An original confocal image is shown b for illustrative purposes. c Microglia cultures were obtained from CSF1R +/+ (WT) and CSF1R +/\u2212 littermate mice (n = 5 mice per genotype) and the cell cultures were exposed to neutrophils and studied by time-lapse microscopy, where microglial cells were seen by phase contrast and neutrophils were stained with CMFDA and detected by green fluorescence. We studied four wells per mouse in each independent experiment (n = 5), recorded 3-4 videos of different fields per well, and analysed 180-210 frames per time-lapse video. Quantification of the number of neutrophils phagocytosed by microglia (normalized by the number of microglia in each well) shows that heterozygous CSF1R +/\u2212 microglia phagocytose less neutrophils than WT microglia. Two-way ANOVA by genotype and experiment, with an experiment-matched design, show a genotype effect ***p < 0.0001. d-f Cultures of WT and CSF1R +/\u2212 microglia were exposed to green fluorescent zymosan beads (n = 3 independent experiments). At the end of the experiment cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-P2RY12 antibodies (red) and the number of cells containing fluorescent beads was counted. Compared to WT microglia (d), CSF1R +/\u2212 microglia (e) also shows a reduced capacity to phagocytose zymosan beads (green) (f). Two-way ANOVA by genotype and experiment, as above, shows a significant genotype effect **p < 0.01. g Sequential snapshot images (1-6) of human microglia obtained during the 12 h time-lapse microscopy study in which 720 frames were studied. The images illustrate neutrophil phagocytosis by human microglia at the indicated times (hours:minutes). h Magnification of the indicated part of sequence 6 in g is shown to illustrate the engulfment of a neutrophil by a human microglial cell. i After the time lapse-experiment, human cells were fixed and stained with anti-P2RY12 antibodies (red). Nuclei are shown in blue (DAPI). The microglial cells contain material (green fluorescence) derived from digested neutrophils. Scale bar 20 \u03bcm \u25c2 1 3 microscopy, we previously found evidence that microglia phagocytosed neutrophils before they extravasated to the brain parenchyma [50, 51] . However, further studies are required to demonstrate whether microglia can really cross the external cortical basement membrane after brain ischemia. Although we detected engulfment of complete cells by microglia, some of the images suggest that microglia may take portions of the neutrophils while they are located in the perivascular or subpial spaces, potentially through a process of trogocytosis [71] .",

            "text": "The blood vessel glycocalyx and basement membrane composition varies between organs and inflammatory conditions suggesting that leukocytes may have to use diverse strategies to access different inflamed tissues [53] . In the brain, neutrophils cross the endothelial cell layer and the endothelial basal lamina of venules to reach the perivascular spaces after ischemia [17] . Then, they accumulate in the perivascular spaces because they do not seem to readily cross the parenchymal basal lamina [17] , at least not at the same pace as they transmigrate through the former layers. However, the precise molecular determinants of this process remain to be identified. The different molecular composition of the two layers of basal lamina surrounding the perivascular spaces, local molecular diversity, and the finding that certain basal lamina components inhibit leukocyte transmigration [63] , might explain why neutrophils have more difficulty to cross the parenchymal than the endothelial basal lamina after brain ischemia. In a model of transient ischemia, there is evidence suggesting that neutrophils are kept in the perivascular spaces without infiltrating the brain parenchyma [17] , whereas other studies suggested that neutrophils reach the brain parenchyma [64] . It is plausible that stroke severity, status of microglia function, and time point of the study are critical determinants of the presence of neutrophils in the brain parenchyma. Neutrophils located in the perivascular spaces might damage the basement membrane by releasing proteolytic enzymes and/or undergoing NETosis [55] . However, at this stage we cannot exclude the possibility that neutrophils gained access to the brain parenchyma in a passive fashion after loss of vessel integrity in the ischemic core. Several lines of evidence support that after brain ischemia neutrophils release proteolytic enzymes, promote matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation, and cause BBB breakdown [25, 35, 36, 57, 66, 72] . Accordingly, blocking neutrophils or neutrophil-derived MMP-9 is markedly protective in models of systemic inflammation and stroke, e.g. [35, 44] . Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of neutrophil elastase or genetic deficiency of this enzyme reduced BBB disruption and vasogenic edema after transient MCAo [64] suggesting that neutrophils contributed to vascular damage following stroke.",

            "text": "In this study we showed that, after permanent ischemia, neutrophils gained access to the brain parenchyma of the lesion core when it was already severely damaged and microglia was lost due to persistent ischemia. Under these conditions, parenchymal neutrophils might be bystanders of severe tissue damage. Therefore, it is likely that preventing the access of neutrophils to the brain parenchyma in this model would not have a major impact on the size of the brain lesion since the damage is already established by the time the cells reach the parenchyma and the core of infarction will not recover. This possibility agrees with the finding that inhibition or deficiency of neutrophil elastase was not protective in models of permanent MCAo [64] . In contrast, inhibiting microglial phagocytic activity in this model might bear negative effects by favoring neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic periphery. Accordingly, detrimental effects of neutrophils became apparent in our study after microglia depletion causing an abnormal increase in neutrophils and larger ischemic lesions. A limitation of our study is that we did not assess stroke outcome in the long term. Future work should investigate how microglia depletion affects the progression of the ischemic brain lesion and the neurological deficits. The results highlight an aspect of microglia phagocytic function that may be beneficial for the ischemic tissue. Nonetheless, several mechanisms can contribute to the detrimental effect of microglia depletion and CSF1R deficiency. For instance, pioneer studies demonstrated increased ischemic lesions related to reduced production of neurotrophic factors after depleting proliferating microglia [38] , and neuroprotective functions mediated by CSF1R [47] . Moreover, we previously identified that absence of microglia significantly augmented infarct size in a model of transient ischemia, in part mediated by dysregulation of Fig. 7 The presence of neutrophils in the brain parenchyma is associated with dystrophy and loss of microglia. a Flow cytometry analysis of CD11b + Ly6G + neutrophils in the core and periphery of infarction and in mirror regions of the contralateral hemisphere 1 and 4 days after MCAo (n = 5 mice per time point) shows that ischemia increases the number of neutrophils in the core of infarction more than the periphery (two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni test, ***p < 0.001). b-d Brain confocal images 1 day after MCAo (n = 8) show Ly6G + neutrophils (green) in the perivascular space of a venule (b) and the parenchymal side of capillaries (c, d). The basal lamina is stained with Pan-laminin (red) and nuclei are stained with To-Pro3 (blue). e Neutrophil (Ly6G + , green) accumulation is higher at the border (dotted line) of the infarcted core than the periphery, whereas microglia (red cells, CX3CR1 cre/ert2 :Rosa26-tdT mice) accumulate in the infarct periphery and are scarce in the core. The vascular basal lamina is shown in blue (pan-laminin). f-h Images obtained from Catchup mice crossed with CX3CR1 gfp/gfp mice at day 1 (f, g) and day 4 (h) postischemia. Extravasated neutrophils (red) away from the vascular basal lamina (pan-laminin, blue) are seen in the core of the lesion where microglia (green) is absent or dystrophic, whereas neutrophils are surrounded by reactive microglial cells in the periphery (f). g Examples (1-5) of microglial cells sending prolongations towards neutrophils 1 day after pMCAo. Neutrophils located in perivascular spaces extend protuberances crossing the basal lamina (1). Extravasated neutrophils are seen near vessels with discontinuous basal lamina (2). They are surrounded by reactive microglia at the border of the lesion (2-4), but dystrophic microglia seem to be unable to fully reach the extravasated neutrophils (5) . h At day 4, microglial cells sending prolongations towards neutrophils are seen at the border of the lesion (1). Extravasated neutrophils are seen in zones where microglia is dystrophic (1-2) or absent (3) (4) (5) . The vascular basal lamina is hardly detected at places where the neutrophils are located (3) . Arrowheads indicate neutrophils, whereas arrows indicate microglia. The cell nuclei (DAPI, white) are shown in g (4) (5) and h (1-3). Scale bar 10 \u03bcm \u25c2 neuronal activity [65] . The latter model caused moderate leukocyte infiltration and we failed to observe a significant impact of microglia depletion on BBB injury and leukocyte recruitment, at least at the times examined [65] . In contrast to the findings suggesting beneficial effects of microglia in brain ischemia, several lines of evidence support that the phagocytic activity of microglia could exert negative effects by removing viable neurons through phagoptosis [5, 6, 48, 49] . It is possible that any negative consequences of phagoptosis of neurons might predominate under mild ischemic conditions where the inflammatory response is low, vascular integrity is preserved, and neutrophil attraction to the brain is negligible.",

            "text": "Collectively, our results support a model where microglia removes neutrophils from the parenchyma and perivascular and subpial spaces after brain ischemia. Severe ischemic conditions induce local microglia loss/dystrophy facilitating the presence of neutrophils in perivascular spaces first and in the brain parenchyma later. Overall, this study shows that reactive microglial cells phagocytose and remove neutrophils, whereas microglial loss or dysfunction enhances neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic lesion. Our results, hence, suggest that microglia function is critical to prevent neutrophil infiltration to the brain parenchyma and to minimize the negative impact of neutrophils in the vascular bed after ischemic stroke. Fig. 8 Microglia depletion increases the number of neutrophils in the brain parenchyma. a Schematic representation of the experimental design. Eight-week old mice received a control or PLX5622-containing diet for 21 days. Then MCAo was induced and the animals continued with the corresponding diet one or four more days until the end of the study. b Flow cytometry (n = 7 mice per group) showed the microglia (CD45 low CD11b + cells) depleting effect of the PLX5622 diet, and an increased number of neutrophils (CD11b + Ly6G + ) in the ipsilateral hemisphere of mice with depleted microglia. Two-way ANOVA by treatment and brain hemisphere, and Bonferroni posthoc test, **p < 0.01. c Control or PLX5622-containing diet was given to CX3CR1 cre/ert2 :Rosa26-tdT mice with the same dosing regimen. Microglia is shown in red, neutrophils in green (Ly6G + ), the vascular basal lamina is stained with Pan-laminin (blue), and nuclei (DAPI) are shown in white. The absence of microglia is associated with an increased presence of extravasated neutrophils (arrowheads). d Is a magnified image showing extravasated neutrophils after a PLX5622containing diet. e, f Distribution of neutrophils in parenchymal versus perivascular or intravascular locations, as assessed by cell counting in brain sections immunostained with Ly6G, pan-laminin and To-Pro3. Mice treated with the PLX5622 diet show a higher (Mann-Whitney test) percentage of parenchymal neutrophils 1 day (**p = 0.004) and 4 days (**p = 0.006) post-ischemia (n = 5-7 mice per group). f Illustrates the previous staining after PLX5622 diet. g Brain lesion volume was measured with T2w MRI 24 h post-ischemia in both diet groups (n = 9 per group).
