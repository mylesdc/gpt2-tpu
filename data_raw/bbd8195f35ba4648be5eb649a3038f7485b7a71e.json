We aimed to assess HCWs concerns and anxiety, perceived sufficiency of information, and intended behavior during the recent A/H1N1 influenza pandemic and their associations with psychological distress. Method: Between September 1 st and 30 th , 2009, 469 health-care workers (HCWs) of a tertiary teaching hospital completed a 20-item questionnaire regarding concerns and worries about the new A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, along with Cassileth's Information Styles Questionnaire (part-I) and the GHQ-28.",

The most frequent concern was infection of family and friends and the health consequences of the disease (54.9%). The perceived risk of being infected was considered moderately high (median 6/9). Few HCWs (6.6%) had restricted their social contacts and fewer (3.8%) felt isolated by their family members and friends because of their hospital work, while a low percentage (4.3%) indented to take a leave to avoid infection. However, worry and degree of worry were significantly associated with intended absenteeism (p < 0.0005), restriction of social contacts (p < 0.0005), and psychological distress (p = 0.036). Perceived sufficiency of information about several aspects of the A/H1N1 influenza was moderately high, and the overall information about the A/H1N1 influenza was considered clear (median 7.4/9). Also, perceived sufficiency of information for the prognosis of the infection was significantly independently associated with the degree of worry about the pandemic (p = 0.008).",

HCWs worries and psychological distress over the previous SARS outbreak have been associated with higher job stress, social isolation and health fears [5, 6] . Also, among the factors that have been found to be associated with HCWs' psychological distress in previous infectious disease outbreaks were physical and emotional exhaustion because of an overburdened healthcare system [11] , rapidly changing medical information and procedures [5, 12] , media scrutiny [5, 12] , being a nurse [13] , perception of risk to themselves [6] , lifestyle affected by the disease outbreak [13] , and personal vulnerability [8, 9] . Ithas been also reported that when facing a possibility of an influenza pandemic, a remarkable proportion of HCWs did not go to work, despite a strong sense of duty [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

In a scheduled meeting with each department's staff, an estimated number of 1000 potential participants were informed about the aims of the study and that participation was voluntary. Blank questionnaires with sealed boxes for collection of responses were placed at various designated work areas in each participating unit. Four hundred sixty-nine subjects (response rate: 46.9%) returned the survey after an informed consent was obtained.

Summary statistics for all variables were calculated. Normality was tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [22] . Chi-square analyses and one-way Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) were performed to assess differences in concerns, worries, degree of worry and perceived sufficiency of information among the groups of the hospital staff. To assess the relationship of worries and degree of worry with intended behaviour, chi-square analyses for categorical data (e.g. worries [Y/N], or intended behaviour [Y/N]) and two-tailed t-tests for continuous data (e.g. degree of worry) were carried out [22] . Univariate comparisons were conducted next to assess variables associated with the degree of worry about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic and the HCWs' psychological distress. Chisquare analyses for categorical data (e.g. for testing the relationship of \"psychiatric caseness\" [GHQ < 5/GHQ > 5] with gender [M/F]), two-tailed t-tests for continuous data (e.g. for testing the relationship of degree of worry with gender [M/F]) and Pearson correlations for testing the relationship between continuous variables (e.g. between degree of worry and age) were carried out [22] . To assess the factors most closely associated with HCWs' degree of worry, a multiple regression analysis was carried out with dependent variable the degree of worry and independent variables the major demographic variables and the statistically significant variables of the previous univariate analyses. Missing data of independent variables were treated by mean substitution. Colinearity between independent variables was tested based on variance inflation factors (VIF) and tolerances for individual variables [23] . Finally, a binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the multivariate associations of HCW's psychological distress adjusting for demographic variables. The dichotomous dependent variable was \"total GHQ score\" and the cut-off point was \"5\", as found by receiver-operating characteristics analysis for the GHQ-28 in the Greek population [20] . Selection of independent variables was based on the results of the previous univariate analyses. and medical staff (6.7%) who presented \"severe psychological distress\" was also higher, in comparison to allied (1.7%) and auxiliary (3.7%) personnel (p = 0.033).",

On the other hand, our findings also showed that 20.7% of HCWs presented scores indicating mild to moderate psychological distress, rates similar to those found in a previous study, at times when there was no infectious exposure, when 18.1% of HCWs presented scores indicating mild to moderate psychological distress [25] . In another study of 275 HCWs in the same hospital one year before the infectious outbreak, we found that 21.8% presented scores indicative of mild or moderate psychological distress (unpublished data). These findings indicate that psychological distress is a common experience in HCWs, as also has been suggested by studies in the UK, which have shown that among doctors and nurses, between 28 and 32% scored above the threshold for \"emotional distress\" in GHQ-12 [26] [27] [28] .

The cross-sectional design of our study prevent us from answering questions about causality, since it is plausible, for instance, that people who are already distressed for reasons not measured in this study are more likely to worry about A/ H1N1 influenza pandemic. Work satisfaction was also associated with psychological distress (Table 6 ) but it was not correlated to the degree of worry about the pandemic ( Table 5 ), indicating that the association of work dissatisfaction with psychological distress could be attributed to the chronic stress and burnout that are common in hospital settings and leading contributors to work dissatisfaction [29] rather than the HCW's concerns about the pandemic. Consistent with the results of previous studies in SARS-affected hospitals [17, 30, 31] , nurses and medical staff presented high rates of psychological distress. Although by definition, both medical staff and nurses have greater contact with patients, medical staff expressed the lower degree of worry (Table 1) , possibly because they mostly regarded themselves as sufficiently informed (Table 2) . A greater proportion of nurses and auxiliary staff also worried about the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic compared to medical staff, and their degree of worry was also greater than that of doctors (Table 1) . Auxiliary staff expressed the highest level of worry, while being a nurse and/or auxiliary staff was significantly associated with psychological distress. In addition, auxiliary staff considered the consequences of the infection for their health to be greater (Table 1) . These findings indicate that assessing and intervening for the psychological impact of the infectious outbreak on HCWs, especially on nurses and auxiliary staff, is of particular importance in planning for the current and future outbreaks of infectious diseases.

Nurses constitute the largest hospital occupational group and are directly and intensively involved in patient care, experiencing a greater risk of contagion in cases of infectious diseases. It is therefore not surprising that nurses reported the higher percentages when asked whether, for a disease that they might contract, they would prefer as much information as possible, while they also felt their department was less well prepared for the A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, compared to the other staff groups (Table 1) . Other studies have also found that in a pandemic of influenza, medical and nursing staff were significantly less likely than ancillary and support staff to consider their ward/department sufficiently prepared for the pandemic [32] . Our results and the results of the aforementioned studies indicate that hospital and department managers and directors should consider the opinions of nurses and medical staff with respect to the proper ward/department preparation for a pandemic, if they are to offer the most favourable working conditions possible for HCWs in times of extreme distress, such as the current and future infection pandemics.",

In addition, although fear of stigmatization, in the form of being avoided by family and friends, was observed to be a prominent aspect of many HCWs' experience during SARS [5, 7, 16, 17] , this was not the case in the present study, where only 3.8% felt that family and friends avoided them because of their hospital work, and only 6.6% had restricted their social contacts themselves. This is not surprising, since the stigmatization reactions of the public to SARS was founded on the fact that the infection was limited to hospitals, whereas the A/H1N1 infection is a community spread infection for which the risk of infection is fairly evenly distributed across the population. Nevertheless, studies in other countries have shown variable rates of intentional absenteeism due to contagious diseases [12] [13] [14] 32] , depending on the kind of the infection, the different time periods the studies took place, the different survey questions, and the cultural differences or religious beliefs. Our results indicated that most HCWs surveyed considered that it was not possible to avoid their duties in an emergency situation due to the pandemic and they would continue working despite the potential risks (Table 3) , a finding consistent with the view that HCWs consider it unethical to abandon their professional responsibilities in order to protect themselves or their families [32, 34, 35] .",

An accurate estimation of the response rate was difficult, because the number of staff who could have been contacted during the 4week period the study took place is difficult to estimate, given that in September many Greek employees are on vacation. However, the response rate of this study (46.9%) is comparable to other studies investigating HCWs' concerns and distress about infectious outbreaks (for example, 47% in the study of Nickell et al [17] , 41.1% in the study of Styra et al [6] , or 23.3% in the study of Maunder et al [5] ). In addition, comparison of the characteristics of the study sample with the total hospital employees suggested that the study sample is representative of HCWs in our hospital. For example, nurses comprise 46.4% of the hospital staff and 44.6% of the study sample. Despite this, however, we cannot refute the criticism that an underlying response style might have led to our results. We also cannot exclude the possibility that particularly concerned or distressed HCWs were under-represented, as such subjects might be on leave because of their worries about the pandemic and thus unable to join the study. Further methodological limitations are the potential for bias caused by socially acceptable answering resulting in possible underestimated intentional absenteeism rates. Gathering information regarding psychological distress by selfreport is a further limitation. Finally, as mentioned earlier, questions about causality cannot be resolved by cross-sectional surveys, and therefore future prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings and to investigate the causal paths of the associations reported regarding HCWs concerns and worries about A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, psychological distress, perceived information and intended behaviour.",
