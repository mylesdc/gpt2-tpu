            "text": "Analysis of codon usage data has both practical and theoretical applications in understanding the basics of molecular biology. Differences in codon usage patterns among genes reflect variations in local base compositional biases and the intensity of natural selection. Recently, there have been several reports related to codon usage in fungi, but little is known about codon usage bias in Epichlo\u00eb endophytes. The present study aimed to assess codon usage patterns and biases in 4870 sequences from Epichlo\u00eb festucae, which may be helpful in revealing the constraint factors such as mutation or selection pressure and improving the bioreactor on the cloning, expression, and characterization of some special genes. The GC content with 56.41% is higher than the AT content (43.59%) in E. festucae. The results of neutrality and effective number of codons plot analyses showed that both mutational bias and natural selection play roles in shaping codon usage in this species. We found that gene length is strongly correlated with codon usage and may contribute to the codon usage patterns observed in genes. Nucleotide composition and gene expression levels also shape codon usage bias in E. festucae. E. festucae exhibits codon usage bias based on the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values of 61 sense codons, with 25 codons showing an RSCU larger than 1. In addition, we identified 27 optimal codons that end in a G or C.",

However, little is known about codon usage bias in Epichlo\u00eb endophytes, a group of clavicipitaceous fungi (Clavicipitaceae, Ascomycota) that live in systemic symbioses with cool-season grasses of the subfamily Pooideae [15, 16] . This mutualistic symbiotic association confers on the host a number of bioprotective benefits by producing secondary fungal metabolites that alter host metabolism [17] . While Epichlo\u00eb endophytes provide many benefits for their hosts, including both abiotic and biotic factors [18, 19] , as well as enhanced growth [20, 21] , the alkaloids produced by the symbiosis can cause health problems for grazing livestock [22] . E. festucae is a biotrophic fungus that systemically colonizes the aerial tissues of the cool-season grasses Festuca, Lolium, and Koeleria spp. to form a highly structured symbiotic hyphal network [23] [24] [25] [26] . E. festucae has been adopted as the model experimental system for the study of the cellular mechanisms underlying endophyte-grass symbiotic interactions [24, 26] . Recently, the genome sequences of two E. festucae strains were released [27] . In this study, we analyzed the codon usage bias of E. festucae and its relationship with other genome features. Our results lay the groundwork for analyses of genetic evolution in E. festucae.",

The genetic code comprises 64 codons encoding 20 amino acids. Therefore, some amino acids are encoded by more than one codon. Different codons that encode the same amino acid are termed synonymous codons. Although their corresponding tRNAs may differ in speed due to their relative abundances, all codons are recognized by the ribosome. The most amino acids can be encoded by more than one codons. Synonymous codons do not appear randomly throughout the genome, however, a phenomenon that is referred to as codon usage bias [1, 2] . Differences in codon usage can modulate the efficiency and accuracy of protein production while maintaining the same protein sequence.",

Analysis of codon usage patterns sheds light on the molecular biology of gene regulation, gene expression, secondary protein structure, selective transcription, and the external environment. Among these, the major factors that are responsible for codon usage variation among different organisms are compositional constraints under mutational pressure and natural selection [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

Two theories-neutral evolution and natural selection-have been used to explain the origin of codon usage bias [3, 28, 29] . If a synonymous mutation occurs at the third codon position, it should result in a random codon choice, with GC and AT being substituted proportionally among the degenerate codons in a gene [30, 31] . In contrast, if translational selection pressure influences codon usage, the bias should be significantly positively correlated with expression levels, with some translation-preferred codons appearing more frequently than others. Previous studies have demonstrated that genes within a species often share similar codon usage patterns, though a few species, such as Bacillus subtilis, appear to refute this [32] .",

The neutrality plot shows that E. festucae genes exhibit a wide range of GC3 values, ranging from 21.82% to 91.67%. There was a significant positive correlation between GC12 and GC3 (r = 0.121, p < 0.01). The slope of the regression line for all coding sequences was 0.0486. The results reveal that the effect of mutation pressure is only 4.86%, it means the codon bias was affected a little by neutral evolution, while the influence from other factors, for example natural selection, is 95.14%. In the genome of E. festucae, there was a significant correlation (p < 0.01) and the regression coefficient was 0.121. This significantly positive correlation in neutrality plots indicated that the effect on the GC contents by the intra genomic GC mutation bias was similar at all three codon positions [33] . Accordingly, mutation pressure (nucleotide bias) only plays a minor role in shaping the codon bias, whereas natural selection probably dominates the codon bias. These results suggest that an effect of natural selection is present at all codon positions. ",

CDS (Coding DNA sequences) were downloaded from GenBank [46] . To improve the quality of sequences and minimize sampling errors, CDS were filtered based on the following considerations: (i) the presence of a start codon at the beginning and a stop codon at the end of each CDS was required; (ii) each CDS had to be greater than 300 nucleotides in length; and (iii) duplicated sequences (exact matches) were detected and excluded from the dataset. As a result, 4870 CDS were used for further analysis.",
