However, because of the nature of public health physicians, it was difficult to select physicians who specialized in infectious diseases, and EIS officers could function in that capacity for a limited time of only 2 years or so after training and assignment. After working in that capacity, most public health physicians who served as EIS officers went to work in their own field of specialty and the private sector, unrelated to public health, as soon as they were relieved of their duties as EIS officers. These physicians were assigned to EIS officer position for their 3 years mandatory military service.",

This is counterevidence to the point that K-FETP operated by KCDC, as the only program in Korea for developing EIS officers, is a very important training program for enhancing the ability to respond to infectious diseases on a national level [8] . Moreover, the fact that the significantly increased number of EIS officers after the MERS epidemic included professional government workers and not existing public health physicians also heightened the need for EIS officer educational training reform. Survey results on need for educational training to strengthen epidemiological investigation competency with 83% of KCDC employees and 95% of local health department officials demonstrate a high demand for reform by those who participate in such educational training. It is determined that these results reflect the fact that KCDC and health department workers who were assigned to the 2015 MERS epidemic recognized on their own a need to grow the ability to perform epidemiological investigation, which was a vital process in responding to infectious diseases. Educational training for strengthening epidemiological investigation competency, targeting KCDC and local health department workers, has the goal of cultivating practical epidemiological investigation competency in local health department officials and healthcare professionals in charge of epidemiological investigation, except EIS officers. Be-cause educational training for strengthening epidemiological investigation competency still lacks the details for its purpose, participants in such training, core competencies, educational goals, educational topics, methods, and materials, it would be necessary to reference K-FETP when considering expected problems and operational issues that may arise when such training program is implemented. It is also anticipated that the survey results from the present study on various categories about educational training on epidemiological investigation will serve as important data in selecting the areas of focus in the process of future educational training program reform.",
