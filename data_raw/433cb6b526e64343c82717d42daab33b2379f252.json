            "text": "The recent outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa has highlighted the clear shortage of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for emerging viruses. There are numerous FDA approved drugs and other small molecules described in the literature that could be further evaluated for their potential as antiviral compounds. These molecules are in addition to the few new antivirals that have been tested in Ebola patients but were not originally developed against the Ebola virus, and may play an important role as we await an effective vaccine. The balance between using FDA approved drugs versus novel antivirals with minimal safety and no efficacy data in humans should be considered. We have evaluated 55 molecules from the perspective of an experienced medicinal chemist as well as using simple molecular properties and have highlighted 16 compounds that have desirable qualities as well as those that may be less desirable. In addition we propose that a collaborative database for sharing such published and novel information on small molecules is needed for the research community studying the Ebola virus.

Thus, when viruses emerge that cause life-threatening infections, such as the recent Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, there are no treatment options.

            "text": "A large array of drug discovery efforts have proven that despite their small size, viral genomes represent suitable targets for drugs. Direct-acting antivirals, which target viral proteins rather than the host's, have been the subject of extensive investigation 3 . Targets in this class fall into multiple categories: virus adsorption inhibitors, inhibitors of viral DNA or RNA synthesis, viral protease inhibitors required for virus maturation, and viral neuraminidase inhibitors required for virus elution 7 . In addition, cellular targets exist that are required for viral replication, including inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase, which is required to supply the pool of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) that serves as a substrate for RNA and DNA, and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase, which is required for the methylation and hence maturation of viral DNA. While finding specific inhibitors to target each viral threat individually may be ideal, the cost-savings and feasibility of finding drugs that act as broad-spectrum antivirals, or those that target specific viral genus or family, is an important goal given the expense associated with developing any one drug for one disease 3 . There are important individual aspects of each virus, and viral family to consider, but nonetheless, many mechanisms of the viral life cycle are mirrored across families, and thus represent opportunities to learn from the many experimental studies that have already been performed.",

Follow-up docking studies suggested that these compounds may have favorable inhibitory interactions with this receptor. VP35 is a cofactor in the RNA polymerase transcription complex, and helps the virus evade the immune response by blocking activation of the interferon regulatory factor 3, which is required for the induction of interferons alpha and beta. Thus, blocking VP35 should allow for an enhancement of the host immune response to the Ebola virus. It is proposed that similar compounds may be acting via a closely related mechanism, though there has been no experimental evidence to directly prove this yet.",

The chemist's (C.A.L.) decisions on compound quality are summarized in Supplemental Table 1 . In contrast to the previous work in scoring compounds as chemical probes, the current aim is very specific -to treat a very serious viral disease for which there is a phenotypic readout. All the known drugs in clinical use were rejected as the chemist looked for compounds that looked more interesting in his opinion. Only 16 out of 55 were selected as desirable in this analysis with no potential problems based on medicinal chemistry experience. In addition to this manual approach, we applied computational filters such as Pan Assay INterference compoundS (PAINS) to identify potentially problematic compounds from structures 28,29 (Supplemental Table 1 ). PAINS analysis was enabled using the MMDS mobile app 30 . Based on this approach we have identified several molecules that appear problematic and agreed with the medicinal chemistry analysis. For example 4 molecules appear to fail the PAINS filters, including the rhodanine compound LJ-001 which was found to be active against numerous enveloped viruses and was found through a screen of inhibitors of Nipah virus entry (IC 50 1\u03bcM) 31 . In vivo a steady state plasma concentration could not be maintained at a therapeutic level. Rhodanines are known to be problematic PAINS compounds 28, 29 . Interestingly amodiaquine was not scored favorably by PAINS or the medicinal chemist, yet this is a successful antimalarial drug.",

The mean calculated molecular property values for compounds were compared using the t-test and ANOVA with JMP v. 8.0.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Significant differences were noted in LogP and Lipinski Rule of 5 violations between desirable and undesirable compounds although one molecule SARA-133 skewed the data with a molecular weight over 3000 ( Table 1) . Removal of this compound leads to significant differences for molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond Table 1 . Mean \u00b1 SD molecular properties calculated in CDD Vault using ChemAxon software for the 55 molecules with activity against the Ebola virus. * statistically significant p < 0.05 using the t-test and ANOVA. ** statistically significant p < 0.0001 using the t-test and ANOVA. Note data are skewed by SARA-133. When this molecule is removed the mean values and significance data are shown in parentheses. Collaboration for the Ebola virus drug discovery The research described for small molecule inhibitors against the Ebola virus has occurred in a disconnected manner and there have been few efforts to summarize the total medicinal chemistry efforts to date. We think this research can learn from other areas in which there are currently efforts to improve collaboration and screening. In the area of Tuberculosis research, funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and The European Commission have enabled the TB Drug Accelerator and the More Medicines For Tuberculosis, as large-scale collaborations between academia, research institutes and industry. These collaborations have promoted the selective sharing of related data in a secure environment between collaborators using the CDD Vault 32 (Figure 1 ). The centralized availability of publicly available data on compounds screened for activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis enables researchers to leverage the existing literature alongside their private data. This knowledge can be used for building of validated computational models that can help in selecting additional compounds or lead optimization 33,34 , saving time and effort. By organizing the data on small molecules tested against the Ebola virus similarly in a central database and using machine learning models based on public data may help identify additional compounds for testing. Such an effort may also prevent duplication of efforts as we have seen with the screening of multiple libraries of FDA approved compounds against the Ebola Virus 14- 16 . In order to catalyze this we have made the 55 compounds (Supplemental Table 1 ) freely available as a dataset in CDD Public (https://app.collaborativedrug. com/register). The compound representation in CDD Vault can be accessed via the text compound descriptors (as in the Supplemental Table 1 ) or in a batch connection table format as an MDL format structure data file (*.sdf) that is universally read by all chemistry aware software. Being able to easily retrieve the chemical structures in machine retrievable form has considerable value. Identifying compounds by name or company code number does not per se allow direct access to chemical structure and often fails entirely to link compound identifier with the chemistry structure of the compound. InChIKey has the great advantage of being searchable on the web (e.g. via Google) but requires a lookup table (e.g. EMBL's Unichem) to get back to the chemical structure. SMILES and InChi representations allow direct access to chemical structure and are compatible with structure searching in most public chemistry databases as well as the proprietary chemistry ACS CAS SciFinder database. The IUPAC name is universally used in naming chemical compounds in patents and software exists for going from IUPAC name to chemical structure.",

However they may not be ideal in the opinion of a medicinal chemist. By bringing together all 55 compounds described in the literature with activity against the Ebola virus, this body of evidence may be more convincing than each study in isolation. In addition it allows us to consider structural features and molecular properties, which may provide insights into the target or mechanism of action. It is unclear whether any of the 55 compounds might also have activity when used as combination therapy as is the current standard of care for HIV, in order to overcome drug resistance, and this needs experimental evaluation. Clearly, we are a considerable distance from having an FDA approved drug for the Ebola virus, but this analysis illustrates that there are already drugs on the shelf that can be potentially repurposed in a shorter time period and at a lower cost and yet they do not appear to have been tested in patients with the Ebola virus. In addition there are at least 16 molecules which in the opinion of an experienced medicinal chemist are possibilities for further optimization. While novel compounds are likely more commercially viable they also will require considerable effort to assess safety. Resources will need to be allocated to this effort and administrators and scientists should perhaps consider some of the medicinal chemistry insights we have provided as well as using a collaborative database to share molecules that are active amongst all scientists. It is hoped these efforts could inspire further drug discovery efforts around small molecules.",
