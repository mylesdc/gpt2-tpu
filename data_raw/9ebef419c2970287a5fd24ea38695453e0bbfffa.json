There was no significant change in LRTI, UTI and BSI infection rates during the 5 years. However, GI rate was significantly decreased from 5.5% in 2003 to 0.4% in 2007. In addition, A. baumannii, C. albicans and S. epidermidis were the most frequent pathogens isolated in patients with LRTIs, UTIs and BSIs, respectively. The rates of isolates resistant to commonly used antibiotics ranged from 24.0% to 93.1%.",

Nosocomial infections have become an important public health issue worldwide. Nosocomial infections may result in an excess length of stay in hospital for up to 10 days and an increase in the costs of hospitalization. [2, 3] Nosocomial infections pose a critical threat to patients, especially in the high-risk departments, such as the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). [4, 5] In industrialized countries, nosocomial infections occurs in 2-12% of hospitalized patients, with the rates being up to 21% in ICU, while the rates are 3-18% in hospitalized patients with the rates being up to 54% in ICU. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] In China, there are more than 10,000 hospitals with significant differences among each other in the size, facilities, administration, teaching, research and academic levels. A few studies reported nosocomial infections in China, but these studies were limited in small sample sizes and short period of time, publication in Chinese journals, with or without English abstracts. [11] [12] [13] Recently, we carried out a retrospective study to determine the current status of nosocomial infections in a tertiary hospital in East China. All data on nosocomial infections between year 2003 and 2007 were retrieved and reviewed. The overall patient nosocomial infection rate, the incidence density rate of nosocomial infections, the excess length of stay, and distribution of nosocomial infection sites were determined. Then, pathogen and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were further investigated.",

Therefore, to effectively reduce nosocomial infections, the use of invasive device should be minimized and specific disinfection precautions taken during the device application.",

Similar to the US report, Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 53.2% of the LRTIs in the present study, but the most frequently pathogens were A. baumannii and K. pneurnoniae in the present study whereas P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were the most common pathogens in the US report. [14] Consistent with the US report, fungi was the most frequently pathogen for nosocomial UTIs; Candida accounted for 54.7% of UTIs in the present study, suggesting a relatively narrow profile of pathogens in nosocomial UTIs. S. epidermidis was the most common pathogen for BSIs in both the present study and the US report; however, E. coli, instead of enterococci, was the second common pathogen in the present study. [14] E. coli was the most common bacterial cause of nosocomial UTIs, and also frequently found in BSIs and LRTIs. It has been shown that the activity of beta-lactam antibiotics against E. coli is greatly reduced as a result of beta-lactamase production, but is restored by the addition of clavulanic acid. [24] In the present study, only 22.2% of E. coli isolates were sensitive to the formula amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid, while 78.8% of E. coli isolates exhibited susceptibility to the combination in an UK study. [25] A high rate of resistance to TMP/SMX (79.3%) was observed in these E. coli isolates, in contrast to the rate of 40% reported in UK [26] . In addition, there was a high proportion (80.0%) of E. coli isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin, whereas the rate was less than 10% in UK and the United States. [26, 27] These findings indicate that treatment with these antimicrobial agents for nosocomial infections caused by E. coli in China is likely to result in clinical failure in a substantial proportion of patients. We also found that a considerable number of P. aeruginosa isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones, from 41.3% to ciprofloxacin to 66.9% to levofloxacin, which is comparable with the fluoroquinolone-resistant rates (49% to 64%) reported for patients in 55 ICUs of eight developing countries, [9] but much higher than that (30%) reported in the United States. [28] All S. aureus isolates in the present study were sensitive to vancomycin, which was similar to the observation by Tsuji et al in Japan. [29] In addition, we observed relatively low resistant rates to nitrofurantoin (24.0%) and TMP/SMX (37.9%), which renders these antimicrobial agents suitable for empirical treatment for S. aureus infections.",

Therefore, it is believed that the nosocomial infection rates must be higher in some rural hospitals or even nontertiary hospitals.

Moreover, Zhejiang is one of richest provinces in China where medical and healthcare systems are relatively well established and antiinfectious therapies are not a big problems. Finally, it should be emphasized that our hospital is an tertiary infectious hospital with experience, methodologies and facilities to combat against various infections including nosocomial infections.",

Second, the data on the identification and isolation of the pathogens and their susceptibility were available only for half of the nosocomial infections. It would produce more accurate data if these numbers were increased. Finally, the data on the clinical consequences were not available for most cases, making it impossible to compare the clinical outcomes between patients with and those without nosocomial infections.
