For instance, skew analysis of the nucleotide bias of several viral RNA genomes indicated that it is enriched in the unpaired, single-stranded genome regions, thus creating an even more striking virusspecific signature. e comparison of skew graphs for many virus isolates or families is difficult, time-consuming, and nonquantitative. Here, we present a procedure for a more simple identification of similarities and dissimilarities between nucleotide skew data of coronavirus, flavivirus, picornavirus, and HIV-1 RNA genomes. Window and step sizes were normalized to correct for differences in length of the viral genome. Cumulative skew data are converted into pairwise Euclidean distance matrices, which can be presented as neighbor-joining trees. We present skew value trees for the four virus families and show that closely related viruses are placed in small clusters. Importantly, the skew value trees are similar to the trees constructed by a \"classical\" model of evolutionary nucleotide substitution. us, we conclude that the simple calculation of Euclidean distances between nucleotide skew data allows an easy and quantitative comparison of characteristic sequence signatures of virus genomes. ese results indicate that the Euclidean distance analysis of nucleotide skew data forms a nice addition to the virology toolbox.",

            "text": "Nucleotide skew analysis [1] provides a powerful tool to visualize compositional aspects of a DNA/RNA sequence. For instance, the minimum and maximum of a G vs C skew can be used to predict the origin of replication and the location of the terminus, respectively, in prokaryotic genomes [2] [3] [4] . e GenSkew algorithm [1] calculates ratio values of the six nucleotide combinations (C vs G, G vs A, U vs G, U vs A, C vs A, and U vs C) in predefined windows and steps along a sequence. Ratio values are calculated according to (N1-N2)/(N1+N2), and hence, a positive value indicates that N1 wins over N2. Skew graphs are generally created by plotting the subsequent windows as numbers on the X-axis against the corresponding cumulative skew values on the Y-axis. In this way, we demonstrated for a representative collection of RNA viruses that the skew plots can be interpreted as \"nucleotide compositional signatures\" of the viral genomes and that these characteristic signatures are more prominently observed in the single-stranded regions than that in the basepaired, double-stranded regions of a viral RNA genome [5] . Likewise, we demonstrated that purine enrichment in the Zika virus RNA genome [6] is a general property of most but not all Flaviviridae and, surprisingly, prominently observed at the first position of the codons and not the silent 3 rd codon position (unpublished results). It is, however, difficult, time-consuming, and nonquantitative to compare different skew graphs with respect to similarities and dissimilarities. We therefore developed a simple mathematical addition to GenSkew analysis that converts skew data into a pairwise Euclidean distance matrix, which can be formatted by means of clustering into a neighbourjoining tree, facilitating the identification of putative relationships, e.g., between viral sequences. e key result of this study is that this Euclidean algorithm offers an easy and quantitative interpretation of nucleotide skew data of virus genomes. e construction of Euclidean distance trees based on skewed nucleotide compositions does not require a prior alignment of the sequences. In contrast, \"classical\" phylogenetic trees are modelled after accurate nucleotide alignment of the sequences. As an additional result, we demonstrate that skew distance trees and phylogenetic trees are surprisingly similar but not identical.",

Flaviviridae were selected and classified according to [9, 10] (Berkhout and van Hemert, unpublished results). GenBank IDs are provided in the figures. Nucleotide skew analysis was done by means of the GenSkew algorithm [1] , of which Dr. T. Rattei (Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen) kindly provided a version that is not restricted by the length of a sequence. For normalization purposes, the overlapping window size was set 1% of the sequence length with a step size of 20% of the window size. e skew between two nucleotides N1 and N2 is defined by the ratio (N1 \u2212 N2)/(N1 + N2), and hence, a positive value of this ratio indicates that N1 proportionally exceeds N2. If the N1 versus N2 comparison results in a negative skew value, the same but positive skew value is true for these nucleotides in the reverse order (N2 versus N1). Algorithms converting skew data into a pairwise Euclidean distance matrix are provided as Additional File S1. e multiple sequence alignment of coronaviral, flaviviral, picornaviral, and HIV genomes was obtained by means of MAFFT [11] . Other alignments and Neighbor Joining (NJ) skew distance trees were built in MEGA v7 [12] . Phylogenetic histories were inferred by using the maximum-likelihood method based on the general time reversible model of nucleotide substitution in the viral genomes [12] . A discrete gamma distribution (5 categories) was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites. e tree with the highest log likelihood is shown. Randomization of the rubella virus RNA genome (10 consecutive cycles to ensure complete nucleotide randomization) was performed by means of the BioWeb server (http://www.cellbiol.com/ scripts/randomizer/dna_protein_sequence_randomizer. php).

It should be noted that, in skew language, CG does not represent a CG base pair but a comparison of the C with the G nucleotide proportions. We adopted the notation C versus G (C vs G) in the text and the figures. e nucleotides C and G win over A (steep positive slope), and the U-nucleotide loses from C and G (steep negative slope) by approximately the same proportion. C is slightly more prominent than G, and the proportions of U and A are close to equality. Importantly, the skew profiles are straight lines, which indicates that the virus-specific nucleotide bias is quite constant along the sequence of the RNA genome. erefore, skew values at the ultimate 3\u2032 end of the genome (position 489) represent a reliable measure of the pairwise nucleotide compositional bias of the rubella virus genome. For instance, the skew endpoint values of C vs A (216.24) and U vs C (\u2212213.37) are very similar but with the opposite sign. e same is true for G vs A (169.79) and U vs G (\u2212168.02), and the skew endpoint values for C vs G and U vs A are 56.39 and 2.31, respectively. For the rubella virus genome, these values can be considered a characteristic signature of the nucleotide composition and presented as a vector in a sixdimensional Euclidean space (C vs G, G vs A, U vs G, U vs A, C vs A, U vs C) \ufffd (56.39, 169.79, \u2212168.02, 2.31, 216.24, \u2212213.37). e skew lines (N1 \u2212 N2)/(N1 + N2) are shown of the rubella virus genome sequence (Figure 1 (a)) and the same sequence after 10 consecutive cycles of nucleotide randomization ( Figure 1(b) ).

Notably, HIV-1 genomes share A enrichment as the common feature of their nucleotide composition [13] , coronavirus genomes typically tend to accumulate the U-nucleotide [14] , and the Flaviviridae displays enhanced purine proportions in the first codon positions (unpublished results). e genomes of picornavirus species do not display such a prominent compositional feature. Apparently, the skew algorithm is able to discern viral families by giving credit to unique compositional features that are typical of a virus family. Viral genomes with a nucleotide composition that is more relaxed like picornavirus RNA are resolved poorly by the skew algorithm. A \"classically\" constructed phylogeny of the viruses shows a similar grouping (Figure 2(b) ). HIV (red), coronavirus (black), and flavivirus species (blue) are clustered in separated clades, whereas representatives of picornavirus are found scattered among the flavi-and coronaviruses. With respect to salivirus, aichivirus, footand-mouth disease virus, and hepatitis A virus, both trees show similar topological positions, but in general, this is not the case. In addition, construction of \"classical\" phylogenetic trees relies a great deal on the accurate alignment of the sequences involved, which becomes less reliable as the evolutionary distance of the taxa increases. For that reason, we separately analyzed the four virus families.",

For instance, the evolutionary tree indicates a close relationship of F1 and F2 strains and between both HIV-1-CRF isolates, which is not observed in the skew-based tree. e dominant A-pressure in HIV may drive the compositional signatures of different HIV sequences towards similar skew values, by which the resolving power of the Euclidean skew algorithm becomes insufficient for a proper discrimination among HIV-1 subtypes. In addition, different sequences may have similar skew profiles. For example, randomization of a sequence does not alter the skew profile of the nucleotides (Figure 1 ). Finally, unclassified HIV-1 subtypes were not found in the ViralZone database.",

Within a family of viral genomes, the topology based on Euclidean skew distances is surprisingly similar (but not identical) to the topology based on regular evolutionary analysis (coronavirus, flavivirus, and picornavirus). is is remarkable because branch nodes in skewbased trees predict equal skew values of both sequences, and, in contrast, branch nodes in evolutionary trees mark nucleotide sequence equality of the two taxa. e resolving power of skew value analysis is diminished at high sequence similarity as shown for HIV-1 subtypes. is is due to the prominent A-pressure in all HIV genomes [15] .",

In addition, we demonstrated similarity of skew data-based cluster trees with \"classical\" maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees constructed via a general time reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution during evolution. Confidence of ancestral nodes in \"classical\" trees is usually attained by means of bootstrap analysis, which requires repetitive resampling of sites in the original sequence alignment. Each bootstrap replicate generates a tree, and a consensus tree is constructed based on the collection of replicates. Each node in this consensus tree is decorated with the frequency number (%) that reflects the level of bootstrap support. It is evident that a skew-based pairwise distance matrix cannot be used for bootstrap analysis simply due to the absence of a sequence alignment. Also, resampling of sites in a sequence prior to skew analysis does not affect the skew data vector (Figure 1 ). Future investigation may reveal whether the Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine building of skew-based trees may serve as a valuable addition to many sequence-independent methods of evolutionary tree reconstruction.",
