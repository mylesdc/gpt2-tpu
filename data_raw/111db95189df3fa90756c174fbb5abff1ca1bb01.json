These interactions range from the initial binding of viral coat proteins to host membrane receptor to the hijacking the host transcription machinery by viral proteins. Therefore, identifying PPIs between virus and its host helps understand the mechanism of viral infections and design antiviral drugs. Many computational methods have been developed to predict PPIs, but most of them are intended for PPIs within a species rather than PPIs across different species such as PPIs between virus and host. Results: In this study, we developed a prediction model of virus-host PPIs, which is applicable to new viruses and hosts. We tested the prediction model on independent datasets of virus-host PPIs, which were not used in training the model. Despite a low sequence similarity between proteins in training datasets and target proteins in test datasets, the prediction model showed a high performance comparable to the best performance of other methods for single virus-host PPIs. Conclusions: Our method will be particularly useful to find PPIs between host and new viruses for which little information is available. The program and support data are available at http://bclab.inha.ac.kr/VirusHostPPI. to the hijacking the host transcription machinery by viral proteins. Therefore, identifying PPIs between virus and its host helps understand the mechanism of viral infections and design antiviral drugs.",

Methods for predicting intra-species PPIs do not distinguish interactions between proteins of the same species from those of different species, and thus are not appropriate for predicting inter-species PPIs. Motivated by a recent increase in data of virus-host PPIs, a few computational methods have been developed to predict virushost PPIs using machine learning methods. For instance, a homology-based method [3] and domain-based method [4] were proposed to predict PPIs between H. sapiens and M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Cui et al. [5] developed a support",

            "text": "There are many types of viruses that cause a wide variety of viral infections or viral diseases. For example, more than 11,000 deaths were reported in Africa during the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in 2014 and 2015 [1] . More recently, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2] , which began with a patient in an emergency room, occurred in South Korea. So far, there is no specific vaccine or effective treatment for Ebola virus and MERS-CoV [1, 2] . Viral infection involves a large number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between virus and its host. These interactions range from the initial binding of viral coat proteins to host membrane receptor vector machine (SVM) model to predict PPIs between human and two types of viruses (hepatitis C virus and human papillomavirus). However, these prediction methods cannot be applied to new viruses or new hosts that have no known PPIs to the methods. Inter-species PPIs predicted by these methods are for PPIs between virus of a single type and host of a single type. A recent SVM model called DeNovo is perhaps the only one that can predict PPIs of new viruses with a shared host [6] . Amino acid sequence similarity between different types of viruses or hosts is relatively low, so sequence-based prediction of virus-host PPIs for new viruses or hosts is quite challenging. In this study, we developed a new prediction method of virus-host PPIs which is applicable to new viruses or hosts. The rest of this paper discusses the details of the method and its experimental results.",

In particular, one of the challenges in sequence-based prediction of virus-host PPIs is to represent two types of proteins of variable lengths into a feature vector of a fixed length. Several encoding schemes have been used to represent protein sequences for predicting PPIs. For instance, Shen et al. [9] clustered 20 amino acids into seven groups, and represented the relative frequency of three consecutive amino acids (referred to 'amino acid triplet') in a protein sequence using the classification. In our previous work [5] , we redefined the relative frequency of an amino acid triplet using six groups of amino acids. However, both Shen's representation and ours generate a feature vector with many zero-valued elements, which lower the prediction performance. [9] and others [10] .

Among the single features, RFAT was better than the others (i.e., FDAT, AC, composition, transition, and distribution) in all performance measures. With RFAT alone, the SVM model achieved an accuracy above 83% and an MCC above 0.668, which indicates that RFAT is a very powerful feature in predicting virus-host PPIs. Although RFAT is a powerful feature, performance gain was obtained with it was used with combination of other features. For example, using three features of RFAT, FDAT and AC showed a better performance than using RFAT alone. The best performance of the SVM model was observed when all six features were used. Table 5 shows the results of testing the prediction model on 2 independent datasets of PPIs of H1N1 and Ebola virus, which were not used in training the models. As discussed earlier, proteins of H1N1 virus have a sequence similarity of 9.6% to those of other viruses, and proteins of Ebola virus have a sequence similarity of 10.9% to other viruses on average. Despite such a low sequence similarity of proteins in test datasets to those in training datasets, all prediction models trained with TR1-TR4 showed a relatively high performance in independent testing. Prediction models trained with host-virus PPIs (TR2 and TR4) showed a slightly better performance than those trained with human-virus PPIs (TR1 and TR3) in both H1N1 and Ebola viruses.

Thus, the difference in the average number of PPIs of the two types of test datasets is not large. However, there is a big difference in the number of target proteins in the test datasets and in the number of proteins common to training and test datasets. The average number of virus proteins in a test dataset for new viruses is only (11+3)/2 = 7, whereas the average number of host proteins in the test datasets for new hosts is (368 + 13 + 106)/3 = 162. Thus, virus-host PPIs in the test datasets for new viruses share many host proteins in the training datasets (248 host proteins common to TR1 and TS1, 129 host proteins common to TR2 and TS2, 248 host proteins common to TR3 and TS1, and 129 host proteins common to TR4 and TS2) even though no virus proteins are shared by the test and the training datasets. In contrast, virus-host PPIs in the test datasets for new hosts share a much smaller number of virus proteins in the training datasets (85 virus proteins common to TR5 and TS5.1, 0 common to TR5 and TS5.2, 2 virus This is a known problem with pair-input methods, which was first reported by Park and Marcotte [13] , but not widely known to researchers. According to their study [13] , prediction methods that operate on pairs of objects such as PPIs perform much better for test pairs that share components with a training set than for those that do not. Thus, our prediction model showed a better performance in testing for new viruses which share more partner proteins (i.e., host proteins) with training datasets than in testing for new hosts which share fewer partner proteins (i.e., virus proteins) with training datasets.",

While DeNovo's SVM model showed an accuracy of 81.90%, sensitivity of 80.71%, specificity of 83.06%, our SVM model achieved an accuracy of 84.47%, sensitivity of 80.00%, and specificity of 88.94% (Table 7) . Our model showed a slightly lower sensitivity, but showed a higher specificity and accuracy. The dataset used for comparison of our SVM model with DeNovo is available at http://bclab.inha.ac.kr/VirusHostPPI. In Barman's study [14] three machine learning methods (SVM, Na\u00efve Bayes, and Random Forest) were used to predict virus-host PPIs using several features such as domain-domain association in interacting protein pairs and composition of methionine, serine, and valine in viral proteins. In a 5-fold cross validation with virus-host PPIs from VirusMINT [15] , their SVM showed higher sensitivity and F1 score than Na\u00efve Bayes and Random Forest.
