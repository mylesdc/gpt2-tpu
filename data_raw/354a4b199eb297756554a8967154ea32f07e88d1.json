(S13), the behavior of the information threshold can be classified into two classes. For \u03b2 B \u2264 \u03b2 Bu , the disease transmission on layer B has little impact on the information threshold, as we have \u03b2 Ac \u2248 \u03b2 Au = \u27e8k A \u27e9/(\u27e8k 2 A \u27e9 \u2212 \u27e8k A \u27e9); while \u03b2 Ac = 0.0 for \u03b2 B > \u03b2 Bu . We here focus on the information threshold for \u03b2 B \u2264 \u03b2 Bu . From Figs. S1(a) and (c), we see that the theoretical predictions are basically accordant with the simulated thresholds for different network sizes. With the growth of network size, the information threshold decreases as \u27e8k 2 \u27e9 of layer A increases [12] . According to Eq. (S25), the theoretical epidemic threshold can be predicted. For SF-ER double-layer networks, Figs. S1(b) and (d) shows that the simulated epidemic thresholds deviate slightly from the theoretical predictions. However, the larger deviations occur for the larger values of the vaccination rate p, e.g., p = 0.9 in Fig. S2 , because the basic assumption of competing percolation theory is not strictly correct for the finite-size networks. As pointed out by Karrer and Newman [7] , in the limit of large network size N , the vaccination and epidemic processes can be treated successively and separately. On the double-layer networks with finite network size, the effect of information spreading is somewhat over-emphasized. From Figs. S1 and S2, we also see that the discrepancy between the simulated and theoretical thresholds decreases with network size N .",

The information thresholds for the different exponents of layer A are compared in Fig. S3(a) , and the stronger heterogeneity of layer A (i.e., smaller \u03b3 A ) can more easily make the information outbreak. Fig. S3(b) shows that increasing the heterogeneity of layer A can slightly raise the epidemic threshold \u03b2 Bc at a small information-transmission rate \u03b2 A , while making for the epidemic outbreak at a large \u03b2 A . This phenomenon results from the different effects of the heterogeneity on the information spreading under different transmission rates.
