Here, we supplement traditional surveillance through sampling among healthy individuals who are tested weekly for multiple respiratory viruses irrespective of whether they are experiencing respiratory symptoms. We use this information to quantify the prevalence of common respiratory viruses within the general population, characterize the seasonality of these viruses, and assess the risk factors (age, habits, and health conditions) that increase susceptibility among hosts.",

This association was likely due to the non-mixed nature of our population, as nearly all of the participants self-identifying as Alaskan native or American Indian were children or parents from one of the day care settings. Children were also associated with a higher risk for co-infection than adults and teenagers, as has also been shown in earlier studies. 14 A larger variety of viruses was found in children and their close contacts; however, rhinovirus and coronaviruses were the most frequently identified viral respiratory pathogens in all age groups.",

The presence of multiple subsequent infections with the same virus in many individuals suggests short-lasting immunity or potential low cross-immunity among multiple co-circulating serotypes of the same pathogen. Previous studies on HRV report up to 20 different rhinovirus types (among more than one hundred known) circulating in a community during one season. Further, the prevailing strains can differ widely between locations, across seasons, and switch almost completely from year to year. 15 Our estimates of incidence rates differ markedly from those built on syndromic surveillance data. 16, 17 Among patients seeking care, some viruses like influenza are overrepresented and others, like coronaviruses, profoundly underrepresented. This asymmetry is likely due to the different pathogenicity of the viruses causing respiratory infections and underscores the importance of using of nonsyndromic surveillance data to capture the true overall prevalence of respiratory virus infection within the general population.",

B, Time series highlighting the distinction between viruses with and without a seasonal pattern. Weekly positive results for each virus are normalized on the total number of tests collected within the week. Fewer samples were collected in late spring and summer. The spikes in prevalence of coronavirus in May and July are likely artifacts due to the lower numbers of samples collected (A) (B) exception of influenza) and absence of long-lasting immunity favors the continued recurrence of outbreaks of these pathogens. Despite this ubiquitous circulation, very little is known about the prevalence of these infections among the global population, as the available estimates are based on syndromic surveillance (eg, in the United States, the CDC-based National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) and FLUVIEW 1,2 ) and prospective studies are usually restricted to groups at risk. Most of the existing literature focuses on young children because acute respiratory infections are a leading cause of childhood hospitalization and mortality worldwide. 6,7 Early life respiratory viral infections, principally due to rhinovirus and RSV, have been shown to be associated with the development of recurrent wheezing and asthma in infants and children. 8-10 Conversely, the impact of these infectious agents on healthy adults and the role of asymptomatic infections on transmission dynamics have not been properly investigated.

Here, we have shown that respiratory virus infections are present among all age groups, with almost all participants presenting with at least one viral infection per year and an overall rate of 17.5% of positivity among all collected samples. Infection appeared to be strongly connected with age, with young children presenting more than double the number of infections of other age groups. Adults with daily contact with children (parents and pediatric doctors) also had a higher number of infections than their counterparts without daily contact with children. Moreover, the distribution of respiratory virus infections for parents and pediatric doctors was very similar to the distribution observed in the children.",
