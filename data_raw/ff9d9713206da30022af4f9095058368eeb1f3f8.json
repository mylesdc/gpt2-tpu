Diversity is not only a key strength of veterinary science but also a challenge. Veterinary research in the next decade must strengthen the scientific impact of its core mission in animal health while firmly reinforcing its societal and global relevance. Key research challenges include water-and food-borne pathogens and drug residues, zoonotic pathogens and infectious diseases, and evidence-based companion animal medicine and its translational applications to human health. Meeting these challenges will require crossdisciplinary global collaborations, significant national research investment, and innovative online publishing tools to facilitate networking and open scientific exchange.",

Veterinary research publications in the past 5 years provide a snapshot of recent accomplishments and serve as a pivot point for identifying future challenges. A Web of Science search (2010-2014) was done to identify top-cited articles, group authors, and funding agencies in the veterinary science research area (1). The search was conducted on all databases to identify veterinary research within a broad context, and then on the Web of Science Core Collection for a more specific veterinary focus. Citations are only one metric of scientific impact, but were used here to identify research areas receiving relatively high attention from other researchers; they were calculated per year so recent articles were not disadvantaged.",

Threats to environmental quality by pharmaceutical and pesticide contamination of food and water, and evolving bacterial drug resistance, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), jeopardize human and animal health and will continue to present a major research challenge for veterinary scientists in the next decade (4). Potential health risks for people who work closely with animals are a top priority. Research also is needed to identify sources of animal and veterinary drugs; assess the role of animals as reservoirs of resistant pathogens; establish interspecies transmission routes (including human to animal); determine risk factors and epidemiology; monitor and adapt agricultural practices; standardize laboratory testing of food pathogens and drug residues; and develop new and effective treatments. Aquaculture-related environmental residues and impact are also a priority (5) . Environmental threats require a global collaborative approach by veterinarians, physicians, microbiologists, pharmacologists, toxicologists, analytical chemists, and environmental scientists, as well as a focus on rapidly developing and highly populated countries such as China and India to address agricultural practices, environmental degradation, and their links with animal and human health (6).",

Infectious and zoonotic diseases intersect with the realities of porous borders, regional conflicts, and a range of agricultural, economic, and political systems that affect veterinary and public health. Outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease and mutations in avian influenza virus in Egypt exemplify the difficulty many countries face in disease surveillance and vaccine compliance. Consortia such as Partners for Rabies Prevention, Cysticercosis Working Group of Peru, and Emerging Babesioses and One Health are important strategies for galvanizing global research support, expertise, and resources.

Challenges include coordination of clinical trials and multi-institutional studies, improved database quality, and implementation of reporting guidelines (12) . Technological advances in diagnostic imaging, laboratory testing, surgical techniques, epidemiologic modeling, and drug therapy of companion animals are accelerating and globalizing. The past 5 years have seen a surge in evidence-based practice guidelines ranging from dental care for dogs and cats (13) to quality assurance in clinical laboratories (Table 1) to advanced life support and CPR (14) . These guidelines promote evidence-based medicine, raise the level of veterinary care, and stimulate discussion within the profession.",
