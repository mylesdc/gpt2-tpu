The gene order of hPIV-2 is 3'-(leader)-NP-V/P-M-F-HN-L-(trailer)-5'. All genes of hPIV-2 were sequenced by our group [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were made by Tsurudome, and antigenic diversity of clinical isolates was investigated [8] . The infectious hPIV-2 from cDNA clone was constructed by Kawano, and it was shown that its growth property was the same as that of hPIV-2 [9] .",

Plant lectins have been shown to inhibit the infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [13] [14] [15] and cytomegalovirus [13, 14] . Plant lectins were reported to inhibit HIV by the prevention of virus adsorption to the cells [16] . However, they also prevent fusion of HIV with their target cells [13, 14] . Against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, the mannose binding lectins are the most effective [17] . Recently, Change et al. reported that recombinant chimeric lectins consisting of mannose-binding lectins and L-ficolin are potent inhibitors of influenza A virus [18] .",

Virus RNA was prepared and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Virus protein expression was observed by indirect immunofluorescence study using mAbs against NP, F and HN proteins of hPIV-2 [8] . The inhibitory effect of lectins on hPIV-2 entry into the cells and replication in the cells was analyzed using a recombinant green fluorescence protein-expressing hPIV-2 without matrix (M) protein (rghPIV-2\u0394M) [9] . The number of viruses released from infected cells cultured with the lectins was determined. The binding of lectins to the cells was observed using rhodamine-labeled lectins. The effects of the lectins on actin microfilaments and microtubules were analyzed using rhodamine phalloidin and anti-tubulin \u03b1 mAb, respectively. The three lectins were added to the cells and they were infected with hPIV-2, and cell fusion was observed at four days post infection.

            "text": "Plant lectins are known to bind to the cell surface sugar moieties, and inhibit virus adsorption to the cells [17] . Mannose-and N-acetylglucosamine-specific agglutinins on HIV replication have been reported [13, 14] . In addition, it was reported that these lectins were effective on cytomegalovirus [13, 14] and that recombinant chimeric lectins inhibited influenza A virus [18] . These plant lectins inhibited virus replication by preventing virus adsorption to the cells. For SARS-coronavirus, the mannose-specific lectins are highly effective, but the inhibitory mechanism is different from that for other viruses. SARS-coronavirus has high-mannose type glycans and the mannose-specific plant lectins can bind to the glycans and prevent the attachment of the virus to the cells [17] . In the present investigation, we analyzed the effect of three legume lectins that have different sugar-binding specificities on the growth of hPIV-2, whose receptor consists of sialic acids [1] . The three lectins bind to each cell receptor, but not to the sialic acids which are the receptor for hPIV-2, so the prevention of hPIV-2 adsorption to the cells must be non-specific. The lectins that bound to the sugar moieties of cell surface might prevent the binding of hPIV-2 by steric hindrance, not by competition. The cytoskeletons were important for virus entry and replication in cells. Actin is necessary for murine leukemia virus entry into cells [21] and for transcription/replication of measles virus [22] and hPIV-3 [10] . Tubulin is also a factor necessary for the synthesis of Sendai virus and vesicular stomatitis virus RNAs [11] . In the present experiment, Con A and LCA induced a slight morphology change in both actin microfilaments and microtubules, indicating that these may be one possibility of reduction of the numbers of the virus released from the infected cells. Taken together, the lectins mainly act on virus entry by considerable prevention of virus binding to the cells. ",
