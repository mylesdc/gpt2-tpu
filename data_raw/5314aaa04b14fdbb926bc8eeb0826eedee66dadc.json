            "text": "Background: In many parts of the world, livestock production is undergoing a process of rapid intensification. The health implications of this development are uncertain. Intensification creates cheaper products, allowing more people to access animal-based foods. However, some practices associated with intensification may contribute to zoonotic disease emergence and spread: for example, the sustained use of antibiotics, concentration of animals in confined units, and long distances and frequent movement of livestock. oBjectives: Here we present the diverse range of ecological, biological, and socioeconomic factors likely to enhance or reduce zoonotic risk, and identify ways in which a comprehensive risk analysis may be conducted by using an interdisciplinary approach. We also offer a conceptual framework to guide systematic research on this problem. discussion: We recommend that interdisciplinary work on zoonotic risk should take into account the complexity of risk environments, rather than limiting studies to simple linear causal relations between risk drivers and disease emergence and/or spread. In addition, interdisciplinary integration is needed at different levels of analysis, from the study of risk environments to the identification of policy options for risk management. conclusion: Given rapid changes in livestock production systems and their potential health implications at the local and global level, the problem we analyze here is of great importance for environmental health and development. Although we offer a systematic inter disciplinary approach to understand and address these implications, we recog nize that further research is needed to clarify methodological and practical questions arising from the integration of the natural and social sciences. key words: emerging diseases, integrated ecology and human health, livestock production, risk characterization, risk management, zoonoses.

            "text": "Recent studies indicate that more than threefourths of communicable human diseases are zoonotic in origin (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005) , including diseases associated with significant mortality and morbidity such as avian influenza (H5N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola virus, and Nipah virus. Some of these zoonotic diseases originate in wildlife and others in domestic livestock species; many have the potential to affect humans through a livestock-human interface (Cleaveland et al. 2001) in which domestic livestock can act as \"amplifier hosts\" (Keesing et al. 2010) for diseases that they contract from wildlife and then pass to humans through frequent and close contact. In light of this, there is growing interest in promoting cooperation between medical and veterinary sectors, as captured in the concept of \"one health\" (Zinsstag et al. 2011 ). Scientific research is now focusing on the inter actions between humans, domestic animals, and wild animals to better understand the mechanisms of disease emergence and transmission, thus informing more effective policies for communicable disease prevention and control.",

Given our understanding of the links between livestock species and emerging zoonoses, it is relevant to ask whether changes in production systems might increase or decrease the risk of disease emergence in human populations. What husbandry practices are most likely to facilitate or prevent the emergence of new pathogens and their transmission to humans? What can be done to reduce risks? What balance is to be struck between these risks and the health gains from improved nutrition and the economic gains associated with livestock intensification? In this commentary, we provide a brief overview of the diverse range of factors likely to influence zoonotic disease risk, and identify ways in which a comprehensive risk analysis may be conducted by using an inter disciplinary approach. We also present a conceptual framework for inter disciplinary research on this problem, from the identification and analysis of risk drivers to the development of policy options for risk manage ment.",

            "text": "Over time, growth in demand and production has extended grazing and farming into natural eco systems, illustrated by the recent transformation of portions of the Amazon forest into grassland for beef production (Fearnside 2005) . In many regions, however, expansion of extensive production has approached its limits because of land degradation and lack of available rangelands (Bruinsma 2003) . In attempting to meet demand, livestock production has evolved and diversified, with a global trend toward intensification. This trend is charac terized by concentration of large numbers of animals in housing units, use of concentrate feed, reduced genetic diversity, vertical integration, and industrial management practices. This \"landless\" mode of production emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 1930s (Woods 2012) and is now increasingly common in many LMICs, where it is associated with large capital investment, particularly for poultry and pig production (Goss and Burch 2001) . While \"backyard\" and semi-intensive production systems are still widespread, particularly in LMICs, industrial enterprises have been estimated to account for 74% of the world's poultry production, 40% of pork, and 68% of egg production (Bruinsma 2003) . The health implications of these developments are uncertain. Large-scale intensive units may be good at biosecurity because they are usually more isolated from the external environment and better protected from infection through sustained veterinary control and manage ment procedures. On the other hand, large numbers of susceptible animals in confined spaces increase the risk of disease transmission Leibler et al. 2009 ) and may encourage evolution of pathogens (Mennerat et al. 2010) . In Thailand, for example, broiler houses with advanced ventilation systems allow confinement of up to 1 million birds per farm (NaRanong 2008). In such conditions, pathogens are likely to have higher chances of survival, transmission, and rapid evolution (Otte et al. 2007 ). This can pose serious challenges for biosecurity because complete isolation is unlikely. Pathogens may enter through ventilation units, feed and water systems, or livestock and leave through ventilation, animal products, and production waste (Leibler et al. 2009 ). Industrial units can produce up to two tons of animal waste every day, which may contain large quantities of pathogens (Hutchison et al. 2005) . Much of this waste is often held in large, exposed lagoons, posing an infection risk for wild mammals and birds (Otte et al. 2007 ).",

The index case for these outbreaks, a 30,000-unit intensive pig farm in Malaysia, was established in a deforested area with resident fruit bat popu lations that frequented fruit trees associated with the farm.

Such distrust can itself result from zoonotic disease events, as happened in the United Kingdom following the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).

In East and Southeast Asia, govern ment subsidies and protective measures have been progressively removed, and producers must compete in an environment increasingly driven by global market forces. In some places, lack of support for producers has been counter acted by the increase in private standards and farm assurance schemes.

Withdrawal of state subsidies may also affect smallholders (family farmers) who are tied to large agribusiness companies through contract farming (Catelo and Costales 2008) . Large companies often provide contractors with technical support and veterinary assistance; however, some may not source supply from smallholders if they can find larger producers who are able to make the necessary investments to operate profitably (Costales et al. 2006) . Under these circumstances, the burden is on the smallholders to make the investments. If they do not, they may be taken out of the market chain and potentially turn to illegal trade. Indeed, illegal movement of animals and derived products represents one of the most important sources of spread of infectious diseases. One example is the significance of illegal trade in poultry between countries in Southeast Asia in the continued spread of avian influenza H5N1 across that region (Pfeiffer et al. 2011) .",

            "text": "The brief overview of risk factors that we have presented here highlights the multidimensional nature of the links between changing livestock production practices and the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases. Given this complexity, understanding the conditions that create zoonotic risk requires a research approach that links both animal and public health sectors and natural and social sciences. Other researchers have stressed the need for integration in this area (Brownlie et al. 2006; Dry and Leach 2010; Parkes et al. 2005; Scoones 2010; Wilcox and Kueffer 2008) . However, few efforts have been made to translate the research agenda into novel methods and concepts that can sustain and guide empirically informed scien tific work (Waltner-Toews et al. 2008; Wilcox and Gubler 2005; Wood et al. 2012) . In contributing to these efforts, we suggest that inter disciplinary research on zoonotic risk should be able to account for the complexity of \"risk environments\" (Barnett and Blaikie 1992) , rather than simple linear causal relations between risk drivers and disease emergence and/or spread. From this perspective, the key scientific challenges are a) to correctly define and understand the risk environment as part of a larger system that creates risk; and b) to deploy a method that combines insights along the full extent of the chain of evidence from viral genome sequencing to animal keeping and on to animal market economics and the politics of food industry regulation. To address such complex inter actions and develop effective policy, we need integrated research that operates at different levels of analysis, from the study of risk environments to the development of risk scenarios and identification of policy options for risk management. These linked levels constitute a conceptual model illustrated in Figure 1 .",

The contribution of social scien tists enhances understanding of both the political economy and the actual practice of livestock production and, above all, the relations between these. In studies to date, analysis of livestock industries is often limited to an aggregate of statistical values, framed within broad categories such as \"industrial,\" \"semiintensive,\" \"backyard,\" or \"mixed farming\" production systems (Robinson et al. 2011) . Although such classifications are useful for organizing the collection and comparison of data for analysis, they inevitably obscure the complexity of an economic sector that is becoming increasingly differentiated. In turn, improved knowledge of the structure and practices of livestock production can provide a framework for strategic pathogen sampling, allowing the linkage of production systemswith their microbial and genetic profiles-to identify vulnerabilities and drivers of pathogen diversity and evolution at each stage of the production process.",

Recent advances in molecular epidemiology can also provide powerful tools for testing predictions of how pathogens spread and evolve, through the capacity to characterize pathogen genomes for similarities and differences across animal and human populations (Parkhill and Wren 2011). Finally, a third level of analysis is required to estimate the health and economic burden for given risk scenarios and identify policy options for risk management. This complex issue also requires integration of disciplinary perspectives and diverse empirical material, including a) epidemiological models at the population level, b) health systems indicators, c) inward and outward trade indices, d) information on existing health and agricultural policy and regulations, e) cultural attitudes toward specific interventions, f ) political constraints and opportunities, and g) economic data on livestock production systems. After the epidemiological models have been completed, macro economic modeling has the potential to embed such hetero geneous data sets into a comprehensive framework for assessments of specific interventions in terms of cost benefits and cost effectiveness (Beutels et al. 2008) . For example, the computable general equili brium (CGE) approach, a member of the \"whole economy\" class of economic models, can be used to account for differential effects of policy options on categories of social actors (e.g., consumers, producers, households, governments) (Smith et al. 2005 ). In addition, combined with outputs from epidemiological models, the CGE approach can accommodate the fact that zoonotic disease and associated control initiatives will affect the economy and population health over time, and that the time profiles of costs and benefits will be sensitive to the sequence of events and interventions (Smith et al. 2009 ). However, such models must be sufficiently flexible and open to account for the variety of qualitative insights on cultural attitudes and governance constraints, in addition to quantitative data on macro economic trends and health indicators . The advice and experience of agricultural experts and other stake holders must also be included as an active element of the risk management strategy.",

There are major potential consequences of this change, not only with respect to emerging zoonotic diseases but also to agricultural sustainability, food security, and climate change effects (Friel et al. 2009 ). It is not at all clear that intensification will lead to a greater frequency of zoonotic disease emergence, although some important risk factors are present. What is needed is an approach to understanding where and how risk can be generated. This requires an inter sectoral and inter disciplinary approach and a stepwise process leading from improved knowledge and specification of risk drivers to policy options for risk management. However, integrated research like this has particular methodological challenges. For instance, the development of modeling tools able to account for the combination of potential risk factors, as well as their health and economic effects, requires the translation of a diverse range of socio economic, biological, cultural, and epidemiological information into a common language for data collation, comparability, and analysis. This process is likely to be difficult because different disciplines may rely on different bases for causal inference, notions of impact, measurement systems, and theoretical frameworks. Thus, continued disciplinary inter actions, mediated by boundary-spanning concepts such as risk environment, are crucial to refine research questions and methods toward a common goal. Fruitful relation ships of this sort have led to novel insights on the dynamics of epidemics-for example, the role of concurrent sexual relationships in the context of HIV transmission (Morris et al. 2009 ).",
