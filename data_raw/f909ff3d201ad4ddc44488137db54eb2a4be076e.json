            "text": "Griffithsin is a marine algal lectin that exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity by binding oligomannose glycans on viral envelope glycoproteins, including those found in HIV-1, HSV-2, SARS, HCV and other enveloped viruses. An efficient, scalable and cost-effective manufacturing process for Griffithsin is essential for the adoption of this drug in human antiviral prophylaxis and therapy, particularly in cost-sensitive indications such as topical microbicides for HIV-1 prevention. The production of certain classes of recombinant biologics in plants can offer scalability, cost and environmental impact advantages over traditional biomanufacturing platforms. Previously, we showed the technical viability of producing recombinant Griffithsin in plants. In this study, we conducted a technoeconomic analysis (TEA) of plant-produced Griffithsin manufactured at commercial launch volumes for use in HIV microbicides. Data derived from multiple non-sequential manufacturing batches conducted at pilot scale and existing facility designs were used to build a technoeconomic model using SuperPro Designer modeling software. With an assumed commercial launch volume of 20 kg Griffithsin/year for 6.7 million doses of Griffithsin microbicide at 3 mg/dose, a transient vector expression yield of 0.52 g Griffithsin/kg leaf biomass, recovery efficiency of 70%, and purity of >99%, we calculated a manufacturing cost for the drug substance of $0.32/dose and estimated a bulk product cost of $0.38/dose assuming a 20% net fee for a contract manufacturing organization (CMO). This is the first report modeling the manufacturing economics of Griffithsin. The process analyzed is readily scalable and subject to efficiency improvements and could provide the needed market volumes of the lectin within an acceptable range of costs, even for cost-constrained products such as microbicides. The manufacturing process was also assessed for environmental, health and safety impact and found to have a highly favorable environmental output index with negligible risks to health and safety. The results of this study help validate the plant-based manufacturing platform and should assist in selecting preferred indications for Griffithsin as a novel drug.",

            "text": "Griffithsin is a high-mannose binding lectin found natively in the marine red alga Griffithsia (Mori et al., 2005) . The protein is composed of 121 amino acids and its monomer has a mass of approximately 13 kDa. Griffithsin forms a homodimer with six binding pockets with high affinity for mannose, a common sugar found at the terminal end of oligosaccharides on the surface of many enveloped viruses. The protein is thought to inhibit the entry of enveloped viruses into host cells as well as viral maturation and transmission events by binding to oligosaccharides on the viral envelope surface. Native Griffithsin and its analogs are the most potent HIV-1 entry inhibitors yet described, with EC50 values in the picomolar range (Mori et al., 2005; O'Keefe et al., 2009) . Griffithsin also effectively inhibits transmission of HSV-2 (Nixon et al., 2013) , HCV (Meuleman et al., 2011) , SARS-CoV (O'Keefe et al., 2010) , Ebola (Barton et al., 2014) , and possibly other viruses yet to be studied. Importantly, Griffithsin appears devoid of cellular toxicity that is associated with other lectins. O'Keefe et al. conducted studies with explants of macaque and rabbit vaginal tissues ex vivo and showed that Griffithsin did not induce changes in the levels of cytokines or chemokines, nor did it alter lymphocyte levels in human cervical tissue nor elicit inflammatory responses in rabbit tissue (O'Keefe et al., 2009) . The combination of extremely wide viral target range and demonstrated preclinical safety makes Griffithsin potentially useful as a prophylactic and/or therapeutic in multiple and diverse antiviral indications.",

In spite of the value shown by pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) drugs to prevent HIV transmission, issues of cost, side effects, the potential for development of viral resistance through chronic use of antiretrovirals (ARV) as prevention modalities, and access to PrEP drugs by underresourced populations remain. These unmet needs could be met by the availability of affordable, safe and effective \"on demand\" antivirals, especially with Griffithsin as the API and its potential to control co-transmitted viruses such as HIV-1, HSV-2 and HCV during intercourse. Adoption of Griffithsin as a new biologic drug, especially in cost-constrained products such as microbicides, is predicated on the feasibility of a scalable manufacturing process that can supply market-relevant volumes of the API at an acceptable cost of goods sold (COGS).",

In this study, we developed a technoeconomic model for Griffithsin manufacturing using a plant-based system with the goal of estimating API manufacturing cost and determined the factors that have the greatest impact on COGS. The output of our study should serve as a basis for additional process improvements, selection of a commercial-scale manufacturer, and should assist in the identification of future product targets for cost-sensitive markets such as prophylactic microbicides as well as those for less cost-constrained therapeutic indications.",

Modeling costs based on existing resources of a contract manufacturing organization (CMO) instead of a \"greenfield\" build of a new facility was seen as the most likely scenario for launch of a new product. Our reasoning was that dedicated infrastructure could be built subsequently depending on market demand for the drug. As a result, we did not estimate capital equipment or total capital investment costs, and neglected depreciation, insurance, local taxes and factory expenses in the manufacturing operating cost analysis as these investments would have been made by the CMO. Our analysis assumed a 20% net profit margin/fee (Sood et al., 2017) assessed by the CMO and this figure was added to the production cost of the product to arrive at the final total product cost.",

This software has been used to estimate cost of goods in a variety of process industries including pharmaceuticals produced by fermentation (Ernst et al., 1997) and plant-made pharmaceuticals (Evangelista et al., 1998; Zapalac and McDonald, 2007; Tus\u00e9 et al., 2014; Nandi et al., 2016) . It is particularly useful at the early, conceptual plant design stage where detailed engineering designs are not available or warranted. SuperPro was chosen because it has built-in process models and an equipment cost database for typical unit operations used in the biotechnology industry, such as bioreactors, tangential flow ultrafiltration and diafiltration, chromatography, grinding or homogenization, and centrifugation. There are some specific unit operations and processes used in this study that are currently not included in SuperPro, such as indoor plant cultivation, transplantation, plant harvesting and screw press/disintegrator. Such unit operations were addressed through the \"Generic Box\" feature of the application. Unless otherwise noted, the maintenance costs of major equipment, unit operation-specific labor requirements and costs (e.g., operators, supervisors), pure components, stock mixtures, heat transfer agents, power and consumables (e.g., filter membranes, chromatography resins) used in the analysis were determined using the SuperPro built-in equipment cost model and default databanks. Additional case study specific design parameters were selected based on experimental data from journal articles, patent literature, the authors' laboratories, interviews with scientists and technologists conducting the work cited, technical specification sheets or correlations, heuristics, or assumptions commonly used in the biotechnology and/or agricultural industry.",

Simultaneously, a subgenomic promoter (TMV U1) also drives expression of the Griffithsin gene, which is translated into Griffithsin protein. Plants at this stage are therefore induced to synthesize the API. Using this expression method, Griffithsin concentration in planta reaches a maximum without further increase typically 14 days post inoculation (optimized internally based on the amount of inoculum used).

Briefly, the aerial parts of the plants (i.e., leaves, stems) containing accumulated Griffithsin are mechanically inverted and cut with a mechanical cutter. The harvested biomass is collected in baskets for transport to the extraction suite, to initiate downstream processing. The harvested biomass fresh weight (FW) is determined to calculate the volume of extraction buffer to be added, typically at a rate of 1 kg biomass FW:1 L buffer mix (100 mM sodium acetate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM ascorbic acid, 10 mM sodium metabisulfite). The pH is adjusted to 4.0 and the mixture is heated to 55 \u2022 C for 15 min to help precipitate major host plant proteins. The heated mixture is passively cooled and filtered (0.3 \u00b5m cellulose filter) to yield a crude extract. The crude extract is stirred overnight at 4 \u2022 C in the presence of bentonite and MgCl 2 . This procedure helps remove TMV coat protein (CP), which at this step represents the largest protein impurity in the extract. The suspension is filtered (0.3 \u00b5m cellulose filter) to remove aggregated TMV CP, yielding a clarified and partially purified API-containing solution and is then sterilefiltered (0.2 \u00b5m polyethersulfone filter). In-process controls are applied throughout downstream processing unit operations to determine reagent volumes and assess yield and quality at key steps.",

Overall, the process uses chemicals that are not harmful to people or the environment, as can be seen by the low magnitude of input and output Environmental Factor values (typically less than 0.325 on a 0-1 scale) in Supplementary Table 4 . The biggest causes for concern (based on the environmental indices) are TMV in the residual biomass, and sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid used in clean-in-place operations, if released to the environment; however we included costs for a thermal or chemical deactivation step for the TMV-contaminated biomass and pH neutralization for the acid and base cleaning agents which would eliminate the environmental impact of these components. It should also be noted that the upstream nutrient compounds can be more efficiently recycled to increase nutrient utilization by the plants and reduce water/soil impact. Waste compounds in the downstream process are disposed of through wastewater and biowaste treatment. An aggregate disposal cost of $0.01 per liter of non-TMV-contaminated aqueous streams and $0.1 per kg of biowaste is assigned in SuperPro for expenses related to wastewater disposal and thermal/chemical deactivation of biowaste streams. Compounds introduced during or after the post-inoculation step in the upstream facility are considered as biowaste since they may contain TMV. This includes spent nutrient solution in the post-inoculation step and retentate streams from plate-andframe and dead-end sterilizing filtration skids. Disposal of TMV-contaminated materials poses low environmental risk. There is extensive industrial experience in disposing of TMVcontaminated materials, which can be rendered non-infective by treatment with bleach, heat or detergents, diluted and disposed of as municipal waste (Pogue et al., 2002) .",

We cannot define the target retail price of a Griffithsin microbicide; there is no market reference price for microbicides since no commercial microbicides yet exist. For perspective, the user cost of a Griffithsin microbicide can be benchmarked against pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with traditional male condoms and PrEP with microbicides containing antiretroviral (ARV) drugs as a newer alternative. Analyses have been conducted on the cost of prevention modalities and the cost savings to the healthcare system enabled by preventing HIV transmission, with prevention being far more cost effective than treatment in most scenarios (e.g., Pretorius et al., 2010) . Walensky et al. (2012) conducted an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of a Tenofovirbased PrEP microbicide in South African women. In their cost modeling of a vaginal gel, they multiplied the product cost of $0.32/dose times 2 (product must be applied twice, pre-and postintercourse) and by 7.2 (average sex acts per woman-month) to arrive at a product use cost of approximately $5/womanmonth. However, the price of the microbicide gel used in the study was assumed and region-adjusted and hence pricing in other countries may be different. Terris-Prestholt et al. (2014) estimated Tenofovir gel prices of $0.25-0.33 per dose, provided that the gel was used in combination with a condom ($0.20-2.00 each; Planned Parenthood, 2018), from which an additive cost of use (single-use condom plus double-dose microbicide gel) of $7-$12/person-month can be derived. Assuming the same average use rate (7.2 applications/month) of a Griffithsincontaining microbicide applied singly without a condom and priced at $1.00-$2.00 per dose, the cost of use would be $7-<$15/person-month.",

A market study by Darroch and Frost (1999) of the Alan Guttmacher Institute consisted of detailed interviews of a cross-section of 1,000 sexually active women aged 18-44 in the continental United States. Their statistically rigorous survey identified levels and predictors of women's concerns about STDs (including HIV transmission) and interest in microbicides, as well as their preferences regarding method characteristics and likelihood of usage versus price of product, with survey sample results extrapolated to the national level. The results showed that of the estimated 12.6 million women aged 18-44 interested in microbicides and concerned about STDs, including HIV, 11.5 million (91%) would still be interested in the method even if it were not 100% effective, and 11.0 million (87%) would remain interested even if the microbicide did not protect against STDs other than HIV. The same study found that women's predicted use of a microbicide was affected by price, but interest was still high at $2 per application, or roughly up to 5-times the average price of a male condom. The survey concluded that more than seven million sexually active women in the USA would be interested in a vaginal microbicide even if the product only protected against HIV, was only 70-80% effective and cost them $2 per application (Darroch and Frost, 1999) . That conclusion was arrived at in 1999; the $2 per application cost back then would be $3.05 in 2018. One can conclude from these results that there is interest in effective yet inexpensive, self-administered HIV and STD prevention modalities even if such products might cost more than conventional prevention methods.",

An average pilot-scale expression rate of 0.52 g/kg was used in our model (Fuqua et al., 2015b) . Although this expression level is quite good for TMV, higher Griffithsin expression levels can be achieved with different technology. For example, Nomad Bioscience GmbH (Halle, Germany) has achieved Griffithsin expression in N. benthamiana exceeding 2.5 g Griffithsin/kg FW biomass using Nomadic TM agrobacterial vectors applied to plants either through vacuum infiltration or agrospray (Hahn et al., 2015) , albeit these results were obtained in small-scale studies. The utilization of such an induction process instead of TMV virions could further improve process economics. For example, even with the same recovery efficiency of 70% assumed in the current model, the output of Griffithsin at the higher expression level would be 1.75 g API/kg plant material, instead of the current 0.37 g/kg; this represents more than 4.7times the modeled output of protein per kg biomass. Under such conditions, the costliest parts of the current process, namely biomass production and upstream procedures, would be lowered by the reduced biomass needs to produce the required 20 kg/year of API. Although a full analysis of the cost of agrobacterial inoculation for Griffithsin production needs to be conducted, we know from similar analyses (e.g., Nandi et al., 2016 ) that economics can be favorably impacted by higher expression efficiencies. We can therefore envision that by using a more efficient induction process the per-dose production cost could be less than the current $0.32. Still other gene expression methods can be considered, including using transgenic plants expressing Griffithsin either in constitutive or inducible systems (Werner et al., 2011; Gleba et al., 2014) , which could also lead to higher API accumulation in host plant biomass and potentially lower COGS . Increasing expression yield upstream might shift costs to downstream operations to handle process streams with higher concentrations of API. Definition of the comparative cost benefits of these improvements relative to the current process modeled awaits a subsequent evaluation.",
