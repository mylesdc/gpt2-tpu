            "text": "Danhong injection (DHI) is a widely used Chinese Materia Medica standardized product for the clinical treatment of ischemic encephalopathy and coronary heart disease. The bindings of eight natural components in DHI between bovine serum albumin (BSA) were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy technology and molecular docking. According to the results, the quenching process of salvianolic acid B and hydroxysafflor yellow A was a static quenching procedure through the analysis of quenching data by the Stern-Volmer equation, the modified Stern-Volmer equation, and the modified Scatchard equation. Meanwhile, syringin (Syr) enhanced the fluorescence of BSA, and the data were analyzed using the Lineweaver-Burk equation. Molecular docking suggested that all of these natural components bind to serum albumin at the site I location. Further competitive experiments of SaB confirmed the result of molecular docking studies duo to the displacement of warfarin by SaB. Base on these studies, we selected SaB as a research target because it presented the strongest binding ability to BSA and investigated the influence of the multi-components coexisting in DHI on the interaction between the components of the SaB-BSA binding system. The participation of these natural components in DHI affected the interaction between the components of the SaB-BSA system. Therefore, when DHI is used in mammals, SaB is released from serum albumin more quickly than it is used alone. This work would provide a new experiment basis for revealing the scientific principle of compatibility for Traditional Chinese Medicine.",

The test solutions were incubated at 310 K for 40 min and then transferred into 96-well black fluoromicroplates (CORNING, USA); the fluorescence spectroscopy tests were carried out at the same temperature to simulate the body temperature. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 500 nm. The maximum emission intensities were used to calculate binding parameters.

The initial three-dimensional structures were optimized using the MMFF94 force field with default parameters.

A molecular docking simulation of those compounds was performed with the AutoDock Vina program. Each computation was performed using the default parameters as described in the AutoDock Vina manual except for grid dimensions. Considering the differences of molecule size, each grid computation was performed as large as possible with a grid box of 30\u00d730\u00d730 \u00c5, with 1 \u00c5 spacing, to ensure that there were enough box dimensions to cover all the active site residues and to allow for the flexible rotations of all molecules.

The effect of these components on the BSA fluorescence spectra is as shown in Fig 3. As shown in Fig 3, when the excitation wavelength was fixed at 280 nm, BSA had a strong fluorescence emission band at 355 nm. The decrease of the fluorescence intensity value of BSA at 355 nm followed with the successive addition of SaB and HSYA indicated that these two components could quench the fluorescence of BSA. Meanwhile, the increase of the fluorescence intensity value of BSA at 355 nm followed with the successive addition of Syr indicated that Syr could enhance the fluorescence of BSA. All these results suggested that SaB, HSYA, and Syr could bind to BSA and induce the microenvironment transformations around the BSA protein.",

In addition, the occurrence of an isoactinic point at 445 nm was considered as direct evidence of the existence of SaB-BSA complex, which suggested that there to be a static quenching process in the SaB-BSA binding system. Beyond these three components, there was no obvious change in the fluorescence spectra of BSA with the successive addition of the other five components, possibly due to the very low binding of these five components with BSA leading to very little changes in the microenvironment around the chromophore of tryptophan.",

According to fluorescence spectrometry studies, SaB and HSYA can quench the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA, and the quantum yield of fluorescence decreased with the increasing quencher molecule concentration. Fluorescence quenching can be divided into static quenching procedure and dynamic quenching procedure. The static quenching is usually resulted from the formation of a stable complex between the protein and quencher, while, the dynamic quenching is usually resulted from collisional encounters between the protein and quencher [33] . Both the static and dynamic quenching procedure can be described using the linear Stern-Volmer equation [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] as follows: As shown in Fig 4, the curves of F 0 /F versus [Q] had a good linearity when the ratio of C SaB / C BSA ranged from 0.5 to 6 and when the ratio of C HYSA /C BSA ranged from 5 to 20, which were plotted according to Eq (1). When the ratio of C SaB /C BSA was larger than 6, the Stern-Volmer plot of the SaB-BSA system changed to an upward curvature, indicating a combined quenching procedure at a higher concentration ratio of C SaB /C BSA .",

These two calculated K q values were all far higher than the maximum scatter collision quenching constant (2\u00d710 10 M -1 s -1 ). It is indicated that both of the quenching processes of SaB and HSYA to BSA were initiated by static quenching mechanism. This result confirmed the above analysis of fluorescence emission spectrometry. The binding parameters K a that were obtained from the Eq (2) for SaB and HSYA were 8. . The value of n for SaB and HSYA was 1.10and 1.11, respectively. Therefore, it has been proved that there was only one class of binding site for SaB and HSYA on BSA. All of the parameters for SaB were consistent with previous studies [16] . Based on the above data, we concluded that SaB-BSA binding was stronger than the binding of HSYA-BSA due to the much higher values of K SV , K q , and K b [42] .

First, BSA was mixed with the coexisting components in a 1:1 ratio. Test solutions containing different concentrations of SaB (from 0 M to 40\u00d710 -6 M) were prepared with fixed BSA and coexisting components at a concentration of 5\u00d710 -6 M. As shown in Fig 9 and Table 3 , SaB also caused the intrinsic fluorescence quenching of BSA in the presence of HYSA, Syr, Phe, Uri, Cyt, and Ade. In the presence of these natural components, there were still upward curvatures when the concentration was larger than 30\u00d710 -6 M, and within the linear concentration (from 0 M to 30\u00d710 -6 M), the values of K q for the SaB-BSA system were still larger than 2\u00d710 10 M -1 s -1 . These results suggested that the coexistence did not change the quenching mechanism of the SaB-BSA binding system. As shown in Table 3 , HYSA, Syr, Uri, Cyt, and Ade decreased the binding parameters K b of the SaB-BSA system by 21-58%, while Phe enhanced the binding parameter K b of the SaB-BSA system. The changes in the other binding parameters, such as K q, K sv , and K a , were similar to those of K b .

As shown in Fig 10 and Table 4 , the fluorescence emission spectra of BSA with different concentrations of SaB in the presence of SFDHI are very similar to those in the absence of SFDHI. At the same concentrations (from 0 M to 30\u00d710 -6 M), the curve of F 0 /F versus [Q] was linear. When the concentration was greater than 30\u00d710 -6 M, the Stern-Volmer plot changed to an upward curvature, indicating a combined quenching at a higher concentration ratio of C SaB /C BSA . The value of K q for SaB was still greater than 2\u00d710 10 M -1 s -1 , indicating that the quenching also corresponded to a static quenching mechanism. The other parameters were also calculated within the linear concentration and are summarized in Table 5 . Compared with the binding parameter K b of \"pure\" SaB-BSA system, SFDHI decreased the binding parameter K b of the SaB-BSA system by 32%, and the changes in the other binding parameters, such as K q, K sv , and K a , agreed with those of K b .

The aim of this study was to evaluate the binding affinities of these components in DHI on plasma protein and to determine the most optimum binding site. Two crystallographic structures of HSA, which co-crystallized with warfarin (entry code 1H9Z) [29] and with ibuprofen (entry code 2BXG) [30] , in Protein Data Bank (PDB) was selected for docking studies. It's because that warfarin and ibuprofen has been demonstrated to be the site marker of site I and site II. The conformation of the protein with site marker is a good starting model for further docking studies. On the other hand, the structural information of BSA with a proper site marker ligand (warfarin nor ibuprofen) was not provided in the Protein Data Bank. We chose the crystallographic structure encoded 4JK4 [28] for docking studies towards BSA. Because 4JK4 is the only crystallographic structure which can provide informations of the amio acid residues lying in site I binding pocket in the presence of a ligand. Moreover, the co-crystallized ligand of 4JK4 is located in both site I and site II binding pocket. It can also used to simulate the amio acid residues lying in site II binding pocket. The docking scores are presented in Table 5 . From the molecular docking data, we could confer that Ade, Phe, DSS, Uri, and Cyt bound very weakly to BSA and HSA, while HSYA and Syr had much higher binding ability to BSA and HSA, SaB represented the highest binding ability to both BSA and HSA. Meanwhile, the binding site of SaB, HSYA, and Syr was within Sudlow's site I. All of the docking results offered a rational molecular explanation for the previous experimental findings.",

Molecular docking studies between these components and BSA/HSA were carried out to provide a molecular explanation for the binding system. According to the results, SaB exhibited a very strong ability to quench the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA through a static quenching procedure. The binding constant (K b ) was 18.6\u00d710 4 M -1 at 310 K. HYSA showed a much lower binding ability with binding constant (K b ) of 1.48\u00d710 4 M -1 at 310 K. Syr could enhance the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA, and the binding constant (K) was 2.7\u00d710 4 at 310 K. Base on these studies, we chose SaB as a research target to investigated the influence of the multi-components coexisting in DHI on serum albumin binding. The results showed that the participation of these natural components in DHI could affect the interaction of the SaB-BSA system. Therefore, we concluded that when DHI is used in mammals, SaB would be released from serum albumin more quickly, which may increase the concentrations of unbound SaB in plasma and improve the pharmacological effects of SaB. This work provides some research basis for the rational clinical use of DHI. And also provide a new perspective to reveal the compatibility principle of DHI.",
