This enabled us to rapidly gain insights into this emerging pathogen population. We found that the PST population across the United Kingdom (UK) underwent a major shift in recent years. Population genetic structure analyses revealed four distinct lineages that correlated to the phenotypic groups determined through traditional pathology-based virulence assays. Furthermore, the genetic diversity between members of a single population cluster for all 2013 PST field samples was much higher than that displayed by historical UK isolates, revealing a more diverse population of PST. Conclusions: Our field pathogenomics approach uncovered a dramatic shift in the PST population in the UK, likely due to a recent introduction of a diverse set of exotic PST lineages. The methodology described herein accelerates genetic analysis of pathogen populations and circumvents the difficulties associated with obligate plant pathogens. In principle, this strategy can be widely applied to a variety of plant pathogens.",

These threats can arise from newly discovered pathogens, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus in humans [1] , or novel host adaptation, as in zoonotic influenza [2] . Recent disease outbreaks in plants have been associated with expansions of pathogen geographic distribution and increased virulence of known pathogens, such as in the European outbreak of ash dieback [3] and wheat stem rust across Africa and the Middle East [4] . Independent of the host organism, the scale and frequency of emerging diseases have increased with the globalization and industrialization of food production systems [5] . Improved surveillance mechanisms and diagnostic tools are needed to rapidly respond to these emerging threats. With recent advances in DNA and RNA sequencing, bacteriologists and virologists are capitalizing on these technological advances by integrating high-resolution genotypic data into pathogen surveillance activities [6] . However, the application of genomics to emerging filamentous plant pathogens has lagged. Filamentous plant pathogens tend to have large genomes and are often obligate parasites that cannot be axenically cultured in the laboratory. The time-consuming and tedious protocols required to maintain these pathogens on their hosts have impeded the translation of genomic technologies into surveillance and diagnostics methods.",

These methods detect only known pathogenic agents, can introduce bias, and can fail to recognize novel variants or races due to their narrow scope [8] . However, next-generation sequencing technologies can circumvent these limitations to provide a rich source of data for the development of surveillance and diagnostic tools. The high resolution of these approaches also enables exploration of the genetic determinants underpinning pathogenicity. Whole-genome sequencing has emerged as a preferred technology, especially for viruses with relatively small genomes (approximately 50 kb on average) [9] , although this methodology is less tractable in pathogens with large genomes such as filamentous plant pathogens, which have genomes that range from 19 to 280 Mb [10] . Alternatively, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which focuses solely on the expressed fraction of the genome, reduces the sequence space of the sample and provides relevant transcriptome data for both the pathogen and host in situ [11] .",

Among these crops, wheat is a critical staple providing 20% of the calories and over 25% of the protein consumed by humans [13] . One of the major fungal diseases of wheat is yellow (stripe) rust caused by the obligate fungus Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Eriks (PST) [14] . This disease is widespread across the major wheat-producing areas of the world and can cause significant reductions in both grain quality and yield in susceptible cultivars [15] . In the past decade, new PST races have emerged that are capable of adapting to warmer temperatures, have expanded virulence profiles, and are more aggressive than previously characterized races [16] . More recently, a series of PST races have arisen in Europe and overcome many of the major resistance genes in European germplasm [17] . For instance, in 2011 a race group collectively called 'Warrior' (based on the virulence of one of the initial variants of this group to the UK wheat variety Warrior) emerged as a serious threat to wheat production. However, the origin of this new race and its relationship with previously characterized races remain unclear.",

[18] published a first draft sequence of PST isolate 130 (PST-130) with 22,185 annotated proteincoding sequences across the 64.8 Mb assembly. More recently, Zheng et al. [19] published a 110 Mb draft sequence of Chinese PST isolate CYR32 using a 'fosmidto-fosmid' approach and annotated 25,288 proteincoding sequences. These genomic resources can be used to identify pathogenicity determinants, such as secreted effector proteins [20] that are recognized in certain host genotypes, where they induce an immune response that prevents disease progression. Avirulence effector proteins are under strong selective pressure to adapt in order to evade detection by the host plant immune system [21] . The signatures of adaptation and gene expression patterns of pathogen isolates with distinct virulence profiles can provide a powerful means of identifying specific avirulence/virulence proteins that can be used to track pathotypes at a national and international level. Furthermore, publication of these draft reference genomes also provides an opportunity to characterize pathogen populations at a considerably higher resolution and on a much wider scale through re-sequencing of PST isolates.",

From these, we selected 35 PST-infected wheat samples from wheat varieties that spanned the resistance spectrum, and 4 PST-infected triticale samples (Table S1 in Additional file 1). Total RNA was extracted from each sample and subjected to RNA-seq analysis ( Figure 1a ). After filtering, an average of 37% (standard deviation 12.7%) reads aligned to the PST-130 reference genome [18] , indicating that fungal transcripts account for a high percentage of the transcripts in PST-infected plant tissue (Table S2 in Additional file 1). To address whether each sample comprised a single PST genotype without considerable bias in allelespecific expression, we calculated the distribution of read counts for biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), determined from alignment to the PST-130 genome. As a dikaryon, the PST mean of read counts at heterokaryotic positions is expected to have a single mode at 0.5, with two alternative alleles each representing one of the two haploid nuclei (Additional file 2) [22] . Based on the presence of only two alleles and the shape of the distribution being comparable to purified isolates when heterokaryotic SNPs were considered, we concluded that all samples likely represent a predominantly single genotype with little bias in allele expression (Additional files 3 and 4).",

Nine of the PST-infected wheat samples were collected from wheat varieties with identified SNPs (Donal O'Sullivan (University of Reading) and James Cockram (NIAB), personal communication) and for each of these samples, reads were independently aligned against the wheat sequences extracted above. Each of the 18,162 SNP positions with \u226510\u00d7 coverage was then assessed for correlation against the available sequence data for seven wheat varieties. This analysis confirmed the wheat variety recorded at the point of sample collection as the most likely variety for all nine PST-infected wheat samples ( Figure 2 ). Furthermore, for samples taken from the wheat variety Oakley, the second highest matching variety was KWS Santiago, whose parents are Sherbourne and Oakley. Oakley has been used widely in the parentage of various wheat varieties as reflected by the level of similarity between PST-infected Oakley samples and all other varieties ( Figure 2 ). This analysis demonstrates that the transcriptomic data from PST-infected field samples can be used successfully to determine the host wheat variety. Transcriptome sequencing was carried out on 39 samples to generate transcript data from both the pathogen and host. For the pathogen, the data were used to assess the pathogen population diversity and differential gene expression. For the host, the data were used to confirm the host variety within a particular sample. SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.

After filtering, reads were aligned to the PST-130 reference genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two PST isolates from 2011 (PST-11/128 and PST-11/13) were more closely related to the older UK population, whereas the remaining 2012 isolates clustered within the 'Warrior' type lineage ( Figure 1b) . To further support the topology of the phylogenetic tree, we extracted RNA from a susceptible wheat variety infected independently with six PST isolates (PST-78/66, PST-12/86, PST-12/83, PST-11/13, PST-11/128 and PST-11/08) that were also subjected to genome sequencing. The distribution of biallelic SNPs, from alignment to the PST-130 genome, confirmed that each sample comprised predominantly a single PST genotype without considerable bias in allelespecific expression (Additional file 5). When SNP sites with sufficient depth of coverage in both the genomic and RNA-seq samples were compared, an average of 99.78% were identical between the genomic and RNAseq datasets (Table S5 in Additional file 1). This indicates that allele-specific gene expression had a negligible effect on the topology of the phylogenetic tree. This analysis further supports the recent emergence of a diverse PST population that may have now displaced the previous PST population in the UK.",

We used multivariate discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) with the 34,764 biallelic SNP sites to define the population structure and identify groups of genetically related PST isolates. The Bayesian information criterion supported the division of PST isolates into four population clusters, which were clearly distinct in a scatterplot of the five principal components of the DAPC (Figure 3a ,b). In addition, Bayesian-based clustering of the full set of 34,806 synonymous SNP sites using the program STRUCTURE classified the PST isolates into four population clusters (Figure 3c ,d) that differed only in the partitioning of two isolates (PST-13/ 120 and PST-13/27) compared with the DAPC assignment (Additional file 6).

With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, it is now possible to integrate high-resolution DNA and RNA sequencing into pathogen surveillance programs. However, many pathogens cannot be axenically cultured, limiting access to pure DNA and RNA preparations. Furthermore, large-scale population analysis of fungal pathogens by whole-genome sequencing remains limited by the lengthy processes associated with purification and multiplication of isolates for high molecular weight DNA extraction and the cost of sequencing large genomes. We have developed an approach for pathogen population surveillance based on high-resolution transcriptome data acquired directly from field samples of pathogen-infected wheat and triticale. Even though the analyzed samples consist of a mixture of pathogen and host RNA, we recovered enough pathogen sequences for analysis. Also, the RNA-seq data were deep enough for reliable genotypic characterization. Similar approaches using shotgun genome sequencing could have been problematic due to the large size of the genome of wheat (approximately 17 GB) compared with that of PST (approximately 110 Mb) [19, 25] . Our approach also captures the PST population directly from the field and negates any biases that might be caused by purification and multiplication of the pathogen in the laboratory, a lengthy process that can impose artificial selection on the pathogen.",

The five carboxy-terminal amino acids were not defined due to poor coverage. availability of high-throughput SNP chips for wheat [23] and SNP marker information for the majority of wheat varieties in the UK [28] (and elsewhere) provides an unprecedented opportunity to exploit sequence data to confirm outbreaks on particular wheat varieties and look for associations between pathogen genotypes and host pedigrees. In this study, we developed an accurate system to associate samples from known wheat varieties with their corresponding SNP markers. In the future, this will provide a rapid means of confirming whether previously resistant wheat varieties have indeed been broken by virulent races of the pathogen, using samples submitted directly to national pathology surveys. This would reduce delays associated with current protocols, which include pathogen propagation, subsequent virulence profiling and confirmation of a specific wheat variety using protein gels from harvested grains or similar distinctness, uniformity and stability assessments [29] .",

Our field pathogenomics approach enables the integration of high-resolution genotypic data into pathogen surveillance activities. For instance, more than 2 million nucleotide positions were used to assess PST population diversity in this study. These highresolution genotypic data are vital to improve our understanding of the genetic substructure within a population, which provides essential information on the evolutionary forces that drive pathogen evolution within an agroecosystem. This study uncovered four genetically distinct lineages within the UK PST population, and each of these lineages had unique virulence profiles revealing a direct link between genotype and pathotype. Although such a correlation has been reported for rust fungi [32, 33] , our findings contrast to distantly related filamentous plant pathogens such as Magnaporthe oryzae [34] and Colletotrichum lindemuthianum [35] where a relationship between genotype and pathotype has not been detected.",

For instance, in the UK, a target number of 25 PST-infected wheat samples are tested each year, specifically focusing on wheat varieties with a previous record of good resistance in the field. With new PST pathotypes/genotypes arising on susceptible varieties by mutation, recombination or through exotic incursions, it is unlikely that a new pathotype would be detected in a timely fashion by the current surveillance system. Furthermore, an exotic isolate that displays similar phenotypic characteristics to a subset of the existing population would not be recognized as such. In this study, we uncovered a group of PST isolates (population cluster III) that displayed identical phenotypic characteristics to a subset of the old UK population, but in fact belonged to a new emergent lineage that appears to be new to the UK. None of these isolates would have been identified as belonging to an emergent lineage based on phenotypic data alone. However, such population shifts may bear significance on disease incidence as the new population may carry important epidemiological traits other than pathogen virulence. Rapid and systematic application of field pathogenomics should transform current disease surveillance systems by generating high-resolution genotypic information (Additional file 10) that inform disease incidence models, agronomic practices, and the selection of PST isolates for subsequent labor-intensive phenotypic characterization.",

Whilst there have been widespread reports of recent changes in the PST population based on phenotypic characteristics [17] , we report a comprehensive genetic analysis of this emergent PST population. Plant-pathogenic fungi rely predominantly on recombination and mutation as the evolutionary forces that drive the emergence of new races and pathotypes [36] . However, within a pathogen population, gene and genotype flow can shape the population substructure as propagules are exchanged between geographically separated epidemiological areas [36] . Given the clonal population structure of PST in northwestern Europe, mutation and genotype flow are the primary inducers of diversity [32] . The fact that none of the 2013 PST field isolates showed genetic similarity to the great majority of the older UK population (collected between 1978 and 2011; excluding PST-11/08) indicates that the 2013 population is likely an exotic PST population that appears to have displaced the previous population. Furthermore, the highest level of genetic diversity between the four emergent PST lineages (F ST ranging from 0.1492 to 0.5673) was similar to that detected using simple sequence repeat markers and comparing PST isolates from different continents [37] . This is indicative of distant ancestry or relatively low levels of gene flow between these emergent UK PST lineages. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that the change in PST population structure may have arisen from exotic incursions from multiple sources over recent years. Future studies will focus on defining the origin(s) of this PST population.",

With anthropogenic activities having a marked influence on the size of genetic neighborhoods [38] , pathogen genotype flow is no longer dependent on life history traits and natural dispersal alone. The next step will be to define the boundaries of these ever-expanding genetic neighborhoods to inform surveillance strategies and breeding programs that need to take into account the full pathogen population within an isolated genetic neighborhood to breed for durable resistance.",

This reflects an increase in PST evolutionary potential in the UK pathogen population that could enhance their ability to overcome genetic resistance in the host. Given that the highest levels of PST genotypic diversity have been reported in the Himalayas and neighboring regions, it is possible that the emerging PST population is derived from one or more migration events from a geographic area with high sexual reproduction rates and a recombinant population structure [37] . This is further supported by similarity in pathotypes between one lineage (cluster I) of the emergent UK population and those previously reported for exotic PST isolates [39] . For instance, three Chinese isolates that were collected in 2004 and a Nepalese isolate from 2008 were shown to be virulent on the wheat variety Spaldings Prolific [40] , which is a key determinant for the cluster I ('Warrior') pathotype [17] . Furthermore, Ali et al. [40] previously classified two Chinese isolates collected in 2001 as belonging to the Northern French genotypic group (G1). Future studies will focus on comparative sequence analysis between the PST isolates reported herein and global isolates of PST to determine the specific geographic origin(s) for this diverse PST population in the UK.",

            "text": "The agronomic consequences of long-distance pathogen migration are currently unpredictable. Although a pathogen population may not pose a significant threat to crop production in the country of origin, it can have devastating consequences in a new environment. For instance, in 2013 a severe stem rust epidemic in Ethiopia was caused by a race similar to those detected in Egypt, Germany and Turkey between 2007 and 2013. However, despite the widespread devastation reported in Ethiopia, other countries reported no negative effect of this race on wheat production. This episode illustrates the importance of global pathogen surveillance networks, to enable early warning systems that assess the threat of pathotypes to all crop genotypes planted within a single genetic neighborhood. Field pathogenomics provides the means to generate enough markers to comprehensively genotype the PST population. High-resolution SNP marker arrays would allow tracking pathogen dispersal on a global scale and clear definition of the pathogen population genetic structure. The approach reported herein uses attenuated PST-infected field samples, thereby negating the limitations associated with movement of live samples. Whilst genotyping is undertaken in state-of-the-art molecular laboratories, the complementary virulence profiling can be carried out in national centers, thereby preventing any threat posed by transportation of live samples between countries. Once genotypic information is generated, subsequent phenotypic characterization can focus on the most notable and representative samples ensuring the best possible use of limited national resources.",

Field pathogenomics should be applicable to surveillance of many pathogens besides wheat rust pathogens, and could contribute to addressing human, animal, and plant health issues. Our approach enabled us to discover a dramatic shift in the UK PST population in 2013 essentially months after collecting the field samples. The emergent PST population has high levels of genetic diversity compared with historical UK isolates and appeared to be unrelated to the older population. This led us to conclude that the 2013 PST population was most probably derived from the recent introduction into the UK of diverse assemblage of exotic PST lineages, and that these introduced lineages may have rapidly displaced the previous PST population. Such detailed knowledge of population shifts and dynamics is important for our understanding of emerging plant diseases and has consequences for the management of such diseases.",

The single lesion consisted of a 2 to 3 cm leaf section taken from a single infection site. Total RNA was extracted from 39 of these samples using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Manchester, UK). In addition, we extracted RNA in a similar manner from infected leaves of susceptible wheat variety Vuka inoculated independently with six PST isolates (PST-78/66, PST-12/86, PST-12/83, PST-11/ 13, PST-11/128 and PST-11/08). The quantity and quality of RNA extracted were assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Edinburgh, UK). cDNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample preparation Kit (Illumina, Cambridge, UK). Library quality was confirmed before sequencing using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Edinburgh, UK). Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx at The Sainsbury Laboratory (for RB1 and RB2) or the Illumina HiSeq machine at The Genome Analysis Centre, UK. Adapter and barcode trimming and quality filtering were carried out using the FASTX-Toolkit. The 76-bp (GAIIx) or 101-bp (HiSeq) paired-end reads were aligned to the PST-130 assembly [18] using the TopHat package (version 1.3.2) and Bowtie alignment program (version 0.12.7) with default parameters [41, 42] . A similar approach was used for whole genome sequencing of PST isolates, except that gDNA was extracted for each isolate from dried urediniospores using the CTAB method as described by Chen et al. [43] and DNA quantity was confirmed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer. DNA libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq DNA Sample preparation Kit (Illumina, Cambridge, UK). Sequencing of all gDNA samples was carried out on an Illumina HiSeq machine at The Genome Analysis Centre, UK, generating 101-bp paired-end reads which were aligned to the PST-130 assembly [18] using BWA with default parameters [44] .

Each of the 18,162 SNP positions with \u226510\u00d7 coverage was then assessed for correlation against the available sequence data for the seven wheat varieties. For each SNP position, if the PST-infected field sample matched the sequence at a SNP site for a particular variety (for example, variety = AA; field sample = AA) the position was scored 1, if the site only partially matched (for example, variety = AA; field sample = AC) then the position was scored 0.5, and if the site had no match (for example, variety = AA; field sample = CC) then the position was given a score of 0.

Tests were carried out on seedlings under controlled environment conditions [57] , with infection types being assessed on the first seedling leaf using a 0 to 4 scale. Infection types 3 and 4 were considered to represent a compatible interaction between host genotype and pathogen isolate, indicating the absence of Avr alleles (that is, virulence) at the corresponding locus in the pathogen. The host resistance genes covered by the differential set were Yr1, Yr2, Yr3, Yr4, Yr5, Yr6, Yr7, Yr8, Yr9, Yr10, Yr15, Yr17, Yr24, Yr25, Yr32 and the resistance in Spaldings Prolific. Other discriminating differentials included the cultivars Robigus, Solstice, Timber, Warrior, Ambition, and Rendezvous. To distinguish the internal structure and variance within the pathology data, the scores associated with the reactions of each isolate on the differential wheat cultivars were used for principal component analysis in R [58] .",

Next, the Fisher's exact test, implemented as part of the edgeR package [60] , was used to identify genes that were significantly differentially regulated between the four population clusters (false discovery rate <0.05; P-value <0.05). All isolates within each population cluster were used as replicates in the analysis to (1) limit the influence of environmental factors on the expression profiles, as samples were collected at various sites throughout the season, and (2) to link gene expression profiles to the virulence profiles that were unique to these genotypic groups. To identify potential effector proteins with signatures of adaptation such as mutation and variation in gene expression profiles, we focused on accessing those that were ranked the highest in our previous effector mining study [20] . Previously, we clustered protein sequences based on sequence similarity and ordered the resulting protein families based on the association of known effector features and PSTspecific annotation [20] . This resulted in overall scores for each family that reflected their likelihood of containing potential effector proteins [20] . Those within the top 100 protein families were considered herein.",

(a) The population substructure illustrated by phylogenetic analysis of 12 PST isolates using a maximum likelihood model (6,479 genes; 2,792,462 sites) correlated with the virulence profiles of the isolates. Virulence profiles for each population cluster were largely conserved between members of the same population cluster, but differed from those of members of other population clusters. Four PST isolates from each of the three population clusters derived from PST-infected wheat samples were inoculated on a series of 39 different wheat varieties and the six discriminative results are shown: Yr7, AvocetS-Yr7 near isogenic line; Sp, Spaldings Prolific; War, Warrior; Amb, Ambition; Tim, Timber; Ren, Rendezvous. Disease severity was recorded 16 to 20 days post-inoculation: 0 (green) to 4 (red) scale with 0 to 2 resistant and 2 to 4 susceptible. Roman numerals represent population clusters. (b) Principal component analysis of the virulence profiles of the 12 PST isolates supports the separation of isolates into three distinct groups based on their phenotypes, which correlates with their genetic partitioning. (c) The degree of genetic diversity between members of a single population cluster for all 2013 PST field samples was much greater than that displayed by older UK isolates collected between 1978 and 2011. Circle size represents the degree of nucleotide diversity enclosed; standard deviation is given in parentheses. Branch lengths represent F ST values stated alongside.",

Distribution of biallelic single nucleotide polymorphism read frequencies for all 39 2013 PST field samples (RNA-seq). The mode for each distribution is given in parentheses. Additional file 9: Differential expression analysis reveals population cluster-specific expression profiles. (a) There were 49 to 254 genes significantly down-regulated and 122 to 240 genes significantly up-regulated for all isolates within a particular population cluster. Differential expression analysis was undertaken using Fisher's exact test from the edgeR package to identify genes that were significantly differentially regulated between the four population clusters (false discovery rate <0.05; P-value <0.05). (b) Of the significantly up-or down-regulated genes, between 8.5 and 45.9% could be annotated with potential structural or enzymatic functions based on sequence similarity searches. (c) The effector candidate PST130_08031 was significantly down-regulated by isolates of cluster III.Additional file 10: SNP markers developed from the field pathogenomics data could differentiate the four emergent PST lineages. Of the fifteen KASP assays developed, 11 could be used to differentiate particular lineages within the emergent PST population in the UK.
