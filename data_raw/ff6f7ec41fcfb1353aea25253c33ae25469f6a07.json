            "text": "In 2003 the UK National Blood Service introduced a policy of 'male donor preference' which involved women's plasma being discarded following blood collection. The policy was based on the view that data relating to the incidence of Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) was linked to transfusion with women's plasma. While appearing to treat female donors as equal to male donors, exclusion criteria operate after donation at the stage of processing blood, thus perpetuating myths of universality even though only certain 'extractions' from women are retained for use in transfusion. Many women in the UK receive a plasmaderived product called Anti-D immunoglobulin which is manufactured from pooled male plasma. This article examines ways in which gender has significance for understanding blood relations, and how the blood economy is gendered. In our study of relations between blood donors and recipients, we explore how gendered bodies are produced through the discursive and material practices within blood services. We examine both how donation policies and the manufacturing and use of blood products produces gendered blood relations.",

It has previously been recognised that the wider bioeconomy is gendered through practices which mobilise women's reproductive tissues, for example, oocytes, fetal tissue, embryos and cord blood for use as sources of stem cells (Kent, 2012; Waldby, 2008; Waldby and Cooper, 2010) . Ova exchange for therapeutic treatment of infertility has been framed as enabling women to assist others to have children, but also as reproducing racialised, national ideals (Konrad, 1998; Nahman, 2006) . Although data on organ transplantation have identified women as comprising the majority of donors, it also reveals that men are much more likely to become organ recipients (Jindal et al., 2005) . What these and other studies have shown is that bodies have become more plastic and flexible, with exchanges of biological materials becoming increasingly associated with new forms of biological citizenship and capital accumulation (Rose and Novas, 2005) . In our study of relations between blood donors and recipients we explore how gendered bodies are produced through the discursive and material practices within national blood services.",

Titmuss (1970) claimed that the ethical imperative in whole blood donation through national blood services should be conceptualised using the notion of the gift relationship which involved the altruistic donation of blood without financial reward. This was to be seen as a preferred moral choice underpinned by the social contract that bound communities together. Titmuss's conception of the gift relationship was underpinned by appeals to universality: it was seen as an important act of social (or biological) citizenship, promoted on the part of national blood services to provide both a moral and institutional basis for encouraging blood donation in an organised manner (Healy, 2006) .",

            "text": "A more critical understanding of blood donation and its association with concepts of citizenship, solidarity and altruism has since been developed. Blood donation has been demonstrated to be a highly politicised issue, especially where tensions have arisen due to some social groups being excluded as donors. Policies of 'donor deferral', commonly justified by policy makers on the grounds of ensuring blood safety, have been controversial and increasingly subject to critical scrutiny. In practice, the public health objective of ensuring a safe blood supply and underlying 'safety logics' (Hoeyer, 2010) has meant that any claim to universality in blood donation is contingent. Donor deferrals and exclusions have been instituted by national blood services for a range of scientific, social and institutional reasons which deserve analysis. Some potential donors are refused permission to donate for reasons that may vary across state boundaries, regulatory regimes or cultural mores. Yet such exclusions are frequently obscured by a discourse of universality of blood donation and under-explored notions of citizenship, as Valentine (2005: 119) points out: 'The universality of blood is implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, equated with a universal possibility of donating it', even though exclusions create categories of 'not quite citizens'. The gendering of bodies has traditionally rendered women as 'not quite citizens' or at least different kinds of citizens. While the deferral of men who have sex with men (MSM) from becoming donors has foregrounded links between sexual identity and blood donation (Martucci, 2010; Valentine, 2005) , the connections with gender have been less well elaborated. Rather, it is commonly assumed, that (heterosexual) men and women are equally valued as blood donors, especially in western blood economies. We argue here that this is far from the case.",

It analyses international blood donation policies, clinical and scientific literature, draws on a public tour of a major blood processing facility, a field visit to a plasma products manufacturer and interviews with transfusion specialists, representatives of patient groups and the plasma industry as part of a larger project on consent, risk and safety in UK blood services. 1 Such research raised questions about contemporary practices within blood services and the plasma industry. Why are all women presumed to represent a threat to the safety of plasma transfusions when not all will become, or will have been, pregnant? How is gender identity mapped onto discourses of risk, safety and understandings of pathological bodies, in this context? Why are men (unless previously transfused), presumed to have low (normal) antibody levels? Given the uncertainties of the causes of a particular complication of plasma transfusion, known as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), what political conditions contributed to a strategy of excluding women as plasma donors for transfusion in the UK and elsewhere? To what extent have the potential risks of TRALI, associated with transfusion by female plasma, been prioritised over potential benefits, such as the claims that cardiac patients transfused with female plasma had better outcomes?",

            "text": "Feminist analyses have drawn attention to the ways in which gender inequalities are obscured through the universalising narratives of the liberal humanist subject and modernist science. From the 1970s onwards, studies explored aspects of women's health and elaborated ways in which contemporary biomedicine perpetuated masculinist notions of healthy bodies, neglected the specificities of women's experience of illness and health, and pathologised pregnancy and childbirth (see, for example, Martin, 1993) . Health services have been shown to institutionalise discriminatory practices perpetuating health and social inequalities. Through a focus on embodiment and lived experience, the gendered aspects of health and illness were described. Essentialist readings of the gendered body increasingly became problematised, and understandings of the body as a naturalised, biological given were seen as unsatisfactory. Instead, accounts of the multiple, socio-historical and cultural processes which produce bodies and bodily difference highlighted the contingent and uncertain, leaky boundaries of bodies (Shildrick, 1997) . The regulation, disciplining and production of bodies through the biomedical sciences became more clearly recognised as a political project, part of a new kind of 'vital politics' or biopolitics (Rose, 2007) . Biopower is seen as productive. Following Haraway and others, the entanglement of biology and politics becomes evident, including theories of the immune system (Martin, 1994) , transplantation science (Shildrick, 2008) , regenerative medicine (Kent, 2012 ) and, we argue, transfusion science. In short, contemporary theorising of gender raises a number of questions about how gender difference is enacted in blood services through material and discursive practices.",

The typical blood donor in western blood economies is most commonly male, white and educated, aged in their 30s, with above average occupational level and income (Piliavin and Callero, 1991) , and more likely to be involved in civic engagement activities (Alessandrini, 2007) .",

However, risk is an unstable concept and has been defined in varying ways. Risk assessment has been viewed as the domain of scientific experts and risk management as a matter for political leadership but the role of science and politics in risk governance has been much debated: 'In simple terms, there are those who view risk as an objective and knowable phenomenon which can be measured, whereas for others it is socially constructed and influenced by cultural, institutional and political contexts' (Farrell, 2012: 9) . We take the view that risk is indeed a socio-cultural construct shaped by political and wider institutional processes. So the use of 'classificatory technologies' to identify potential risks to the blood supply must be viewed as one of the ways in which this dynamic operates.",

We suggest that similar processes are operating within transfusion science and that valuations of bodily materials are variable and gendered. As we will highlight, women's bodies are constructed as more 'risky' in a number of ways by national blood services, such as in relation to the use of female plasma for transfusion and in the manufacture of the blood product, known as Anti-D Ig. In both cases, male bodies are more highly valued in terms of the source material they provide for such blood components and products.",

            "text": "The collection and supply of blood for use in the production of a range of components and plasma products has now become a complex undertaking for national blood services (see Figure 1 ). On the one hand, it is characterised by enduring socio-cultural and political concerns about preferred methods of collection in line with national preferences, which most often crystallises as support for the gift relationship in western bioeconomies. On the other hand, such concerns must be managed in the context of interconnectedness both within and across national boundaries, in relation to collection and supply (Waldby and Mitchell, 2006) . This shifts over time and space in the face of emerging risks to blood safety, as well as in relation to changing market demands for blood components and plasma products. Further layers of complexity are added to the mix because collection and manufacturing practices differ between blood components or plasma products, and both for-profit and not-for-profit organisations are involved in such practices: Figure 1 . Fresh blood components and plasma-derived and recombinant products. Source: www.blood.gov.au/about-blood when we talk about blood products and plasma products, they're very different. When you talk about a labile blood product that's going to be mainly used for transfusion purposes and when you talk about a plasma product which is basically a product which is a finished pharmaceutical, it's a product that has undergone a manufacturing cycle, it's a stable product. So it'll have much longer shelf-life and they are products that circulate on the international level, whereas labile blood products tend to be products that have much shorter shelf-life that are used on a national scale. So that's one of the key differences. Another difference, I would say lies with collection practices, for both blood and plasma products. Blood products, obviously they come from blood donations made by blood donors. Plasma products, most of the plasma products used on a global scale come from plasmapharesis donors. So these are people who actually donate the plasma but not the whole blood. They go to specialised plasmapharesis centres [ . . . this] accounts for approximately 70 percent of the plasma that is used for therapeutic purposes on a global scale. And then the 30 percent of the remaining plasma comes from plasma that has been recovered from blood donation. (Int. 16, Executive of an international patient organisation)",

Therefore, governing risk in blood services and the plasma industry poses technical challenges but also raises ethical and political concerns.

(2011: 337) Interestingly, while attending to the exclusion of migrant peoples and their citizenship status, Polonsky et al. fail to recognise the gendered notion of citizenship operating here. For example, in societies where marriage is the key source of status and security for women, those who are carriers of thalassemia are marginalised and socially excluded (Chattopadhyay, 2006) . In these contexts, women's reproductive role continues to be associated with social exclusion and marginalisation, rendering them as 'not quite citizens'. Other studies have highlighted the gendering of blood donation. In Brazil, only a third of donors are women and donation is understood as a form of 'bloodletting' for those who use hormone contraceptives to suppress menstruation (Sanabria, 2009 ). In Pakistan, women's blood is regarded as 'impure' and they are not expected to donate blood except when no men are available (Mumtaz et al., 2012) . Experiences of blood donation are gendered too. Blood may be seen both as self and as alienable and rendered 'non-self' following manipulation and transfusion. The notion that blood becomes anonymised and 'just a product': was a distinctly masculine idea among the regular blood donors. Eight out of nine male blood donors used some version of this model to understand what they were doing when they gave blood, whereas the female donors, with the exception of the nurse, were more inclined to think of their blood as forming a relationship with the recipient, either as a kind of loan or as a shared substance (Waldby et al., 2004 (Waldby et al., : 1468 Our evidence indicates that women are constructed as different kinds of donors and patient-recipients in relation to the assessment of risk within this blood economy. As we describe below, the gender identity of blood travels with it to the processing centre, and the maternal body represents a threat to blood and plasma product safety.",

While historically women's plasma has been valued where they carry high titres of RhD antibodies which can be used in the manufacture of Anti-D Ig, the industry has shown a long standing preference for male plasma, targeting prisoners, inmates in mental institutions and gay men for antibodies needed to manufacture particular products, such as gamma globulin and the hepatitis B vaccine (Starr, 1998) . Donor compliance and reducing 'risky behaviour' is at the heart of plasma procurement practices today. There are industry standards which apply to the procurement, processing and manufacturing of plasma which are intended to reduce the risk of transmissible infections and viral disease, and improve the quality and safety of the product (Farrell, 2012) . Voluntary standards have been developed through the International Quality Plasma Programme and, in Europe, the sourcing of plasma must comply with the European Blood Directive. 3 There has also been more stringent oversight at national and supranational level to ensure compliance with manufacturing standards within the scope of international pharmaceutical (medicinal products) regulation (Farrell, 2012) .",

The continuing debate about the risks attributed to MSM, and their exclusion as blood (and tissue) donors since the HIV crisis, has drawn attention to the contingent and discriminatory practices associated with the risk calculus involving blood safety (Galarneau, 2010; Hoeyer, 2010) . Within transfusion science, blood relations and exchanges are seen by Strong as creating 'vital publics' which are 'embodied associations elicited through the generalized exchange of body -in this case blood. Participation in the vital public might therefore be seen as a unique duty associated with the biological citizen' (Strong, 2009: 173) . He argues that exclusions of MSM as donors relied on technologies which first sought to measure risk, then model it mathematically. Yet the assessment of the risk of transfusing transmitted viral infection is problematic, and socially relative, serving the political ends of sustaining the blood supply and protecting public health. As a consequence, we suggest that policies which mobilise particular understandings of the potential risks of using plasma from women must also be viewed in this light. Although women are recruited as whole blood donors, their donations have different exchange value to those of men.",

This potentially fatal 'syndrome' has only been characterised and named over the past 20 years and definitions of it have been the subject of international debate and discussion.

In 1999, SHOT introduced a set of four categories of TRALI cases indicating the level of uncertainty about the diagnosis: highly likely, probable, possible and unlikely. Each year, therefore, a high proportion of reported TRALI cases are categorised as possible or unlikely to be TRALI. A 'consensus conference' in Canada in 2004 described the clinical criteria of 'TRALI' and 'possible TRALI'. It is the presence of antibodies in female plasma which was believed to be 'implicated' in the cause of TRALI. HLA antibody production is in turn associated with pregnancy in women. 4 Despite the clinical and technical uncertainties surrounding the definition and diagnosis of TRALI, the association with HLA antibody-positive female donors led to this new policy and operational strategy in the following way:",

As a result of the option appraisal, the NBS introduced in October 2003 a policy to use male plasma for manufacture of FFP as far as was operationally possible. This policy did not involve any additional donor questioning or loss of any donors from either whole blood or apheresis collections, since plasma is not collected by the latter method. Fractionation of UK plasma was discontinued in 1999 because of vCJD, so all plasma from non-FFP donations is discarded. (Chapman et al., 2009: 443) Being female was therefore defined as a risk factor, in a similar way to potential prion transmission from donors. All women, whether they had a history of pregnancy or not, were, as a result of this new policy, deemed unfit (or at least undesirable) for plasma donation. From this time onwards, whole blood donations were labelled 'M' or 'F' at the donor session for easy identification at the processing centre. Since 2010, 100 percent of FFP has been produced from recovered male plasma in the UK (NHS Blood and Transplant, 2012). At its largest national blood processing centre, female plasma, once it is separated from the red blood cells at the first stage of processing, is redirected to the 'discard' section to be sent for incineration. Risk factors are associated, not with reproductive history per se, but with reproductive potential, materialising female bodies as inherently 'risky' sources of plasma.",

In short, it serves to perpetuate the myth of universality even though in reality only certain 'extractions' from women are retained for use in transfusion.

The production of HLA antibodies by the woman, known as sensitisation, may have particularly serious consequences for subsequent pregnancies, and therefore the administration of a plasma product, Anti-D Ig, is designed to prevent sensitisation and antibody production. Anti-D Ig can be administered prophylactically antenatally or postnatally or following any sensitising event which may have caused fetal maternal haemorrhage (this might include miscarriage, abortion, or intrauterine testing and trauma). Although Anti-D Ig has been used as a prophylactic treatment for over 40 years in many western countries (Kumpel, 2001 (Kumpel, , 2002 Kumpel and Elson, 2001) , the mechanism of this passive immunisation is poorly understood and the efficacy of different treatments has not been well studied (Pilgrim et al., 2009) . Nevertheless, it is considered to have been highly successful in reducing the incidence of HDFN. Paternal blood group testing may assist in identifying those women at risk of becoming sensitised. A new technology for antenatal testing involving cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA), which circulates in the maternal blood (genotyping), has the potential to identify the blood group of the fetus and therefore determine whether there is a need for prophylactic administration (Brojer et al., 2005; NICE, 2008) . To date, this test has not become widely available for 'at risk' women. However, there are risks for women associated with the use of Anti-D Ig and its incorrect administration, and many women receive this product unnecessarily (Bolton-Maggs et al., 2013; Finning et al., 2008; Kent et al., 2014) .",

More recently, scientific and cultural understandings see the immune system as a complex networked system (Martin, 1994) . Within this framework, maternal bodies, in particular, are often represented as paradoxical and explanations about why the genetically distinct fetus is not rejected by the mother have provoked considerable debate and stimulated a long history of investigation. In pregnancy the fetal and maternal circulations have increasingly been understood as closely interconnected. Maternal fetal microchimerism refers to the mixing of cells from the maternal and fetal body (Kelly, 2012; Martin, 2010) and placental 'border crossings' which may provoke an immunological response. Kelly's (2012) account of the emergence of gestational cell transfer science and understandings of maternal-fetal microchimerism reveals the extent of scientific uncertainty about the significance and meaning of these exchanges.

Immunology theory supported and reinforced a set of political values about normal and pathological states, subjectivity and identity. The fetus was thought of as a hostile 'invader' or 'intruder' and the placenta as a barrier between two separate selves (Martin, 1994) . The dominant view was that the immune system 'defends the self' and the pure body is the normal body (Kelly, 2012) . With recognition that cells routinely cross the placental interface, a relational model of the immune system begins to emerge, as a complex, dynamic network (Haraway, 1995) . Instead of a barrier, the placenta may be viewed as a permeable interface where exchanges between mother and fetus occur in both directions -'bidirectional cell trafficking' (Martin, 2010) . The discovery of the intermingling of maternal and fetal circulations and blood type incompatibility as a cause of HDFN in the 1960s was important in developing Anti-D Ig therapy. The implications of a revised model of the immune system -as relational and networked -are much wider. First, the notion that all bodies are chimeric undermines notions of the modern political subject as a distinct individual (Kelly, 2012) ; second, it implies a different way of thinking about antibodies, and their significance for transfusion practices starts to seem far more complex than a blanket exclusion of women as plasma donors in the UK suggests. Yet, in the context of transfusion science, it is presumed that the immune status of (all) women is compromised because of their potential exposure to a fetal body, thereby affecting their suitability to become plasma donors. In contrast, the commercial production of Anti-D Ig by injecting male RhD negative plasma donors' with RhD positive cells to produce antibodies, is an accepted and valued practice.",

It constructs all women as risky plasma donors regardless of their age, reproductive history or antibody status. Implemented with no public consultation or discussion, there is a continuing lack of public information or explanation of this policy. This in turn raises questions about the ethics of donation -the information given to women about becoming blood donors. While retaining women donors in the donor pool may be an important policy objective, the different ways in which their donations are processed is information which should be made available. The myths of universality, citizenship and solidarity should be publicly elaborated upon to explain and justify the ways in which women are treated as different kinds of donors from men. As we have shown, women are unable to donate blood as frequently as men; all women's plasma is likely to be discarded in the UK; and elsewhere its use is limited to processing for fractionation.",

Women of reproductive age are usually excluded from becoming donors for the product or having access to additional payments for such donations. Moreover, many women receive Anti-D Ig when it is unnecessary (Kent et al., 2014) . In short, the institutional arrangements for plasma collection and processing favour 'Donor 1' men. Practices around procurement and distribution render gender differences both invisible and visible. Patient information describes Anti-D Ig as produced from 'specially selected donors' (NHS Blood and Transplant, 2010) and women are often unaware that they may not need Anti-D Ig if they are carrying an RhD negative fetus. Plasma products are not simply homogeneous, neutral, universal technologies -rather gender is inscribed upon them. Gender difference is produced within the industry and blood services.",

The calculation of risk associated with FFP plasma transfusion rests on limited understandings of the causes or characterisation of TRALI and an evidence base which includes a wide-ranging categorisation of 'highly likely, probably, possible, unlikely' cases. Transfusion science, as a discourse of truth and power, is tied to technological change and emergent forms of knowledge and expertise. In creating categories of donors, donor deferral policies, screening, testing and matching policies, it 'governs life' through the exercise of biopower. Women's position is tied to their reproductive work and their reproductive potential within an increasingly globalised and commercial blood economy (Busby et al., 2013) , in circumstances where the policy rationale for such positioning remains unclear and lacks transparency.",
