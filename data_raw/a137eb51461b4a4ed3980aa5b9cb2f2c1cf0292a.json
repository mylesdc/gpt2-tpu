While many viruses are known to employ anti-immune strategies to facilitate their replication, highly pathogenic virus infections can also cause an excessive immune response that exacerbates, rather than reduces pathogenicity. To investigate this dichotomy in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we developed a transcriptional network model of SARS-CoV infection in mice and used the model to prioritize candidate regulatory targets for further investigation.",

We also found that receptors for the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) promote pathogenesis, presumably through excessive inflammation. Conclusions: The current study provides validation of network modeling approaches for identifying important players in virus infection pathogenesis, and a step forward in understanding the host response to an important infectious disease. The results presented here suggest the role of Kepi in the host response to SARS-CoV, as well as inflammatory activity driving pathogenesis through TNF\u03b1 signaling in SARS-CoV infections. Though we have reported the utility of this approach in bacterial and cell culture studies previously, this is the first comprehensive study to confirm that network topology can be used to predict phenotypes in mice with experimental validation.",

SARS-CoV is a positive stranded RNA virus that emerged in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong Province, China likely from a pool of closely related coronaviruses that circulate in horseshoe bats [4] . Infected patients typically presented with fever and evidence of respiratory illness, general malaise and lower respiratory tract symptoms including cough and shortness of breath, and had an overall fatality rate of approximately 10 % [5] . Despite this threat we are poorly prepared to develop rapid strategies to ameliorate coronavirus disease severity in an outbreak setting. Viral pathogenesis has been extensively studied for decades, yet the root causes remain poorly understood. Furthermore, high mutation rates of RNA viruses allow them to quickly adapt to changes in their host environment resulting in a complex system of virus and host restriction factor evolution [6] . While several endpoints of viral infection can be measured in animal models of disease (e.g., viral replication, immune cell infiltration, body weight loss, time to death), the molecular and cellular mechanisms that determine the severity of these effects are not well-resolved. However, high throughput molecular approaches offer a way to discover novel host response genes, proteins, and pathways that contribute to the systems-level development of pathogenesis.",

            "text": "A key tool of systems biology, network-based strategies can provide contextual information about broad spectrum, druggable targets, such as host regulatory proteins that drive the critical functional responses comprising the pathobiology of these viruses [7] . Network-based methods have been used to identify critical regulatory nodes within signaling networks and produce mathematical models of disease processes [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Analysis of coexpression-type networks has been used previously to identify genes and proteins of increased importance to controlling system-wide host responses [10, [12] [13] [14] [15] . The topological locations of genes in these networks can be used to identify hubs, genes that are connected to many other genes and therefore may be exerting a regulatory influence, and topological bottlenecks, genes that bridge disparate sub-networks and may serve as mediators of transitions between system states [16] [17] [18] . Recently, a node's participation in network motifs in directional networks was shown to be an effective predictor of importance [19] . However, directional interaction networks are not always available for a given system, making methods for studying non-directional networks of interest. While topology-based approaches have been validated for in vitro systems, it is not clear that topology of co-expression networks derived from complex tissues with multiple cell types will be effective in prediction of whole-organism phenotypes. Additionally, little if any systematic experimental validation of network-based predictions made from whole organism studies has been undertaken.",

We analyzed these data to identify critical targets using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), an approach which groups similarly behaving genes into modules, then identifies genes with the most representative expression behavior within each module [20] . Here we select additional targets using the previous dataset and determine their role in SARS-CoV infection in mice. Weight loss phenotypes from infections in selected null mice were examined in new experiments reported here as well as from previously published studies. We identified a novel player in the immune response to virus infection, Kepi, an inhibitory subunit of the PP1 complex, which protects against SARS-CoV pathogenesis. We also found that receptors for the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF\u03b1, promote pathogenesis, presumably through excessive inflammation. Our results reveal new insight into the critical balance between over-and under-stimulating the innate immune response to infection. We validated several network-based approaches systematically using multiple KO mouse strains from this and previous studies, and found that ranking genes based on their network topology makes even better predictions of effect on pathogenesis than does WGCNA or simple differential expression. This study represents a critical step toward the validation of computational modeling approaches which can explain the mechanisms underlying changes in pathogenesis and predict regulators critical to this process. This is the first instance of confirmation that network topology can be used to predict phenotypes in mice with experimental validation. Also, the confirmed role of TNF\u03b1 receptors and the new role of Kepi are novel contributions to SARS-CoV literature.",

In the previous study 20-week-old C57BL/6 J mice were mock-infected or infected with SARS-CoV at 10 2 , 10 3 , 10 4 , and 10 5 plaque forming units (PFU). Lung tissues were collected at 1, 2, 4, and 7 days post-infection (DPI) for microarray analysis. Mice infected with the highest dose experienced severe weight loss and either succumbed to infection or required humane euthanasia [20, 21] . Mice infected with all other doses experienced transient weight loss and recovered from infection. We used the transcriptomic data from this experiment to generate modules using the weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), which establishes groups or modules of genes representing the main expression patterns in the process being studied [20] . WGCNA identifies genes that are highly central to modules (groups of similarly expressed genes), thus having high module centrality scores (K ME ); these genes are postulated to play an important role in overall function such as pathogenesis. We used this approach in the previous study to identify Serpine1 as important for SARS-CoV pathogenesis.",

To address this we generated an association network to identify topological bottlenecks, which are genes whose expression patterns are similar to those of two groups of coexpressed genes, and thus form a link between these modules in the network. We first constructed a network of genes related by mutual information in expression patterns over time using the context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) method [22] , as we have done previously to identify regulatory relationships, functional associations, or simply coordinated behavior [13, 23, 24] . Similar to protein-protein interaction networks, we have found that topological bottlenecks within transcriptional networks are significantly enriched in genes that have particular importance to the systems-level phenotypes being studied in the experiments [12, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . In the current study, genes identified as topological hubs and bottlenecks are predicted to play important roles in regulating the host response to viral infection, and may affect virus-induced disease severity.",

Stat1, Ifnar, and IL28ra assessed in Frieman et al. 2010 [29] . Serpine1 and Plat assessed in Gralinski etal. 2013 [20] . All others assessed in the current study. For Stat1 and Ifnar, background strain used was 129. For Il28ra, background strain used was Balb/c. **Ranked by absolute differential expression versus mock at day 1 post-infection unique properties. For the current study, we selected KO target genes based on various criteria. Tnfrsf1b and Kepi had high (96.9) and moderately high (85.8) percentile scores for network degree centrality, respectively. In addition, given the fact that Tnfrsf1b and Tnfrsf1a constitute the primary receptor for TNF\u03b1 as a heterocomplex, we included the Tnfrsf1a/1b \u2212/\u2212 double KO as well. Cxcr3, Ido1, and Ptgs2 were also selected based on prior interest in identifying critical mediators of the immune/inflammatory response not previously known to influence SARS-CoV infection. Importantly, all choices were heavily influenced by KO mouse availability. We reasoned that allowing KO availability to influence target selection (instead of choosing candidates at the absolute top of network rankings) was a reasonable approach, since network-based scores are not expected to rank genes in the precise order of their level of impact on biological processes, but are rather likely to position genes in approximate rankings of importance. Additional file 1 shows the network degree centrality scores for the selected genes, which fall across a range of values due to the various criteria used to select them. Groups of mice were infected with SARS-CoV and assessed for weight loss over a seven-day period along with appropriate wild type control infected mice, similar to previously published studies [20, 29, 30] . Titer and weight loss for these mutants are provided in Additional file 2. For each experiment we determined whether the null mouse had a significantly altered phenotype relative to wild type as assessed by weight loss. Though this may be an imperfect measure of pathogenesis it is an accepted method that has been utilized broadly [20, 29, 30] , and importantly in the studies we used to validate our network method. Because the combined previous and current experiments provided data for genes occupying a wide range of network score values, we assessed the effectiveness of network betweenness, network degree centrality, and WGCNA analysis in identifying genes relevant to SARS-CoV infection. Thus our assessment considers whether network topology can discriminate between presence/absence of phenotype (Table 1) .",

The ability of each method to correctly classify genes as having a significant effect on pathogenesis as determined by weight loss different than wild-type mice infected with SARS-CoV (see Table 1 ) was assessed using a receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC). The area under the curve (AUC) is shown in the legend. The differential expression (DE) category indicates the range of AUC values obtained when genes were ranked by DE from all viral dose and day post-infection combinations muscle contraction, neuronal activities, splicing of RNA, cell division, apoptosis, protein synthesis, and regulation of membrane receptors and channels [31, 32] . From our weight loss data we found that at 4 through 7 DPI the Kepi \u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly more weight loss than the wild type animals, indicating that Kepi may play a protective role against severe SARS-CoV-induced disease (Fig. 2) .

TNF\u03b1 has two main receptors Tnfrsf1a and Tnfrsf1b, and is a primary mediator of inflammation that has been implicated as important in response to upper respiratory virus infection [33] [34] [35] .

If our network model reflects the true structure of the underlying regulatory machinery, albeit at a lower resolution, then deletion of a target gene in an experimental system should disrupt the expression of genes adjacent to the target in the predicted network, or network \"neighbors\". In order to test this hypothesis, we identified network neighbors of Kepi and Tnfrsf1b from the wild type infection studies, as well as genes co-occupying the same WGCNA modules of these genes. We then analyzed the transcriptomes of the KO mouse strains during SARS-CoV infection (see Methods) and compared the genes predicted to be altered in the KO strain (the network neighbors) with those that were actually altered by transcriptome analysis. Because our network models do not predict activation or repression effects, we can only predict that deletion of a target will have a significant effect on the expression of its direct neighbors, as compared to all other genes in the network. Figure 3 shows the expression changes in the target gene's modules and network neighborhoods in infected KO mice. Deletion of the target genes caused predicted neighborhood genes to be significantly differentially regulated relative to infection of wild type mice (p values < 0.001) for all cases examined. Not only were the gene expression values of neighborhood genes significantly different from other network genes, the overlap between neighborhood genes and differentially expressed genes was significant as well (p < .05 by permutation test). These results support the predictions from our network models that deletion of a target gene would affect expression of those genes predicted to be downstream.",

Gene expression in the KO mice was examined after SARS-CoV infection and differentially expressed genes between infected wild type and KO mice were clustered based on their expression profiles and associated with functional gene ontology (GO) categories arising from enrichment analysis ( Fig. 4a ; average fold changes for each cluster are provided in Additional file 3). A heatmap of gene fold change values for the indicated clusters is provided in Additional file 4. The marked increase in pathogenesis we observed in the Kepi \u2212/\u2212 mice was accompanied by modest increases (relative to infection of wild type mice) across most immune response-related clusters (only clusters with discernible functionality are shown). The Tnfrsf1a/1b deletion showed a somewhat opposite decrease for most clusters at day 4, with this trend resolving or partially reversing at day 7. Previous studies with various influenza strains found that increases in pro-inflammatory processes were correlated with increased levels of pathogenesis [36] . Our results for Tnfrsf1a/1b seem to agree with this finding, since day 4 data reveals that the inflammation-related cluster is significantly downregulated. Although day 7 shows a partial reversal of this effect, the infection is largely resolved at this point and therefore this reversal is unrelated to pathogenicity. Interestingly, the Kepi \u2212/\u2212 demonstrated an increase in expression for genes in the same cluster. It could therefore be surmised that the increased pathogenicity in the Kepi \u2212/\u2212 is a direct result of increased inflammatory activity due to absence of the gene. However, this is unlikely because of Kepi's function as an inhibitor of the protein phosphatase PP1, which is known to regulate diverse cellular functions. PP1 opposes the following pro-inflammatory processes: TNF\u03b1 activation, NF-kB activation [37] , prostaglandin synthesis [38] , neutrophil activation through inhibition of ROS generation, and promotes downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes. Thus the observed increase in genes related to inflammatory processes may be a compensatory response caused by chronic absence of PP1 inhibition (see Discussion). PP1 has also been shown to contribute to apoptosis signaling in neutrophils [39, 40] . Accordingly, we saw a gene expression increase in the cluster associated with leukocyte apoptosis in the Kepi \u2212/\u2212 mice at both 4 and 7 DPI, suggesting that the removal of the block on PP1 causes an increase in apoptotic mechanisms. These findings were borne out by examining expression of all genes associated with the GO terms \"inflammatory response\", \"apoptosis\", and \"neutrophil apoptosis\" (Fig. 4b) . Interestingly, an effect on apoptosis could only be observed when the more specific \"neutrophil apoptosis\" term was used. Fold changes and significance measures for genes in all clusters are provided in Additional file 5.",

Figure 5 depicts possible mechanisms for the effects of removing TNF\u03b1 or Kepi during SARS-CoV infection. As shown in Fig. 5a , Kepi is known to inhibit PP1, which drives apoptosis in neutrophils. In general PP1 exerts an antiinflammatory effect on innate immune machinery, such that Kepi-mediated PP1 inhibition promotes inflammatory processes. Removing Kepi (Fig. 5b) releases the restraint on PP1, likely resulting in a general downregulation of innate immunity and decreased capacity to resist the effects of infection and increased pathogenicity. TNF\u03b1 is a potent driver of leukocyte-mediated inflammation which in the case of normal SARS-CoV infection likely causes significant tissue damage. Removal of TNFRs (Fig. 5c ) may disable a component of the inflammatory response, such that tissue damage is diminished. However, non-TNF\u03b1-related mechanisms (e.g. through IL1\u03b2, TLR4 etc.) could still be able to control progress of the infection, and the net result is decreased pathogenicity. Thus our studies appear to have highlighted the role of a critical balance between too little and too much inflammation in pathogenesis during murine SARS-CoV infection. Interestingly, we found that the expression of Kepi doubles in Tnfrsf1a/1b \u2212/\u2212 mice during infection (not shown), suggesting the presence of a negative feedback loop between Kepi and TNF\u03b1 signaling. While Kepi and TNF\u03b1 signaling do not directly oppose each other and they are clearly not the only two important components of inflammatory regulation, study of both null mice reveals that simultaneously promoting Kepimediated repression of PP1 signaling and limiting TNF\u03b1driven inflammation may lessen the pathogenic effects of SARS-CoV infection.",

Targeting inflammation during SARS through TNF\u03b1 inhibition has been previously recommended based on bioinformatics analysis and expert opinion; however the current study provides the first experimental evidence for this hypothesis. In addition, since loss of Kepi results in increased pathogenesis, PP1 inhibition represents a second possibility for follow-up studies on SARS-CoV pharmaceutical treatment. Since removal of the innate PP1 inhibitor likely has the effect of crippling the immune response, exogenous inhibitor may have the desired effect of enhancing innate immunity to an optimal degree, although careful titration of therapeutic doses may be necessary to avoid an overactive immune response, and toxicity may be an issue. Inhibition of TNF\u03b1 receptor signaling may represent a more promising potential therapy, since total deletion of TNFRs led to a favorable outcome. The presence of semi-redundant innate immune signaling remaining in TNFR-null mice is apparently sufficient to control SARS-CoV infection, so that signaling through these receptors can be aggressively targeted. Future studies will investigate the effects of these pharmaceutical therapies using the mouse model.",

            "text": "One seemingly contradictory result was the elevated expression of inflammation-related genes in Kepi \u2212/\u2212 mice. This appears surprising given the antagonistic nature of PP1 signaling toward innate immune processes. Removal of the PP1 inhibitor results in unregulated PP1 activity, which shuts down innate immune response cascades and promotes neutrophil apoptosis, although one report documented PP1 opposing apoptosis in these cells [42] . Since transcriptomics studies can only monitor mRNA transcript levels, data from protein phosphorylation states (where much of the critical signaling events may be manifested) were not collected in this study. Induction of these genes is likely an attempt to augment immune response signaling in the face of unchecked PP1. The slight increases in neutrophil-and monocyte-specific genes in the Kepi \u2212/\u2212 mice may suggest that rather than decreasing levels of neutrophils through apoptosis, PP1 is shutting down inflammatory pathways within these cells in mutant mice. Thus while gene Interestingly, removal of several other components of the immune response in previous work also resulted in susceptible phenotypes. Deletion of chemokines and receptors important for neutrophil and monocyte recruitment and chemotaxis (Ccr1, Ccr2, and Ccr5) all increased pathogenesis (Table 1 ) [30] and lung pathology, indicating that these genes play an essential role in protecting the host from SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Deletion of Ifnar, which plays an important role in antiviral effects, did not have a significant effect on pathogenesis of SARS-CoV [29] , likely due to the number of interferon antagonists encoded in the SARS-CoV genome. This was also true of the cytokine receptor Il1r1, which is a mediator of inflammation, and Cxcr3, a chemokine receptor implicated in neutrophil involvement in ARDS [43] . Given these observations and the somewhat modest effects on weight loss exhibited in our study, the effects of Kepi and Tnfrsf1a/1b on pathogenesis are likely to be part of a larger picture involving inflammation and their roles will require further investigation.",

The results presented here suggest the role of Kepi in the host response to SARS-CoV, as well as inflammatory activity driving pathogenesis through TNF\u03b1 signaling in SARS-CoV infections. These results will be further investigated in future studies, which will include testing of pharmaceutical compounds. Though we have reported the utility of the approach in bacterial and cell culture studies previously, this is the first comprehensive study to confirm that network topology can be used to predict phenotypes in mice with experimental validation. We envision that our approach could be used to complement traditional approaches and provide more resolution between cause and effect from large, costly systems biology studies.",

Network neighborhoods for each of the target gene deletions tested were assessed for their expression difference from the rest of the network using a Student's t test. Neighborhoods are defined in terms of the WGCNA module that contains the target gene (blue bars) or the first-order network of the target gene from the CLR-inferred network (red bars). All comparisons shown have p values less than 0.001. Standard error is shown for each data point as error bars. Negative mean expression indicates that deletion of the target gene is reducing the expression of its neighborhood compared to response in a wild type mouse A BFig. 4Fold changes in mut/WT for cluster categories and GO terms. a Expression data of mutant and WT mice from infection with SARS-CoV were analyzed using hierarchical clustering; the functional content of these clusters was determined using functional enrichment analysis. The average direction of fold change elicited by the mutant for the cluster are shown coupled with p-values for the significance of the change. Pvalues were calculated using permutation tests of random gene groups having identical sizes to the gene group under test. For (b), values were calculated as in (a), except genes were grouped for fold change analysis using selected GO terms instead of gene expression clusters.
