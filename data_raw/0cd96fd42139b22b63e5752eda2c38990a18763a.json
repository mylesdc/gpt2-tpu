Herein we report the isolation of CD133-positive cells (LC-CD133 + ) and CD133-negative cells (LC-CD133 2 ) from tissue samples of ten patients with non-small cell lung cancer (LC) and five LC cell lines. LC-CD133 + displayed higher Oct-4 expressions with the ability to self-renew and may represent a reservoir with proliferative potential for generating lung cancer cells. Furthermore, LC-CD133 + , unlike LC-CD133 2 , highly coexpressed the multiple drug-resistant marker ABCG2 and showed significant resistance to chemotherapy agents (i.e., cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel) and radiotherapy. The treatment of Oct-4 siRNA with lentiviral vector can specifically block the capability of LC-CD133 + to form spheres and can further facilitate LC-CD133 + to differentiate into LC-CD133 2 . In addition, knock-down of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133 + can significantly inhibit the abilities of tumor invasion and colony formation, and increase apoptotic activities of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Finally, in vitro and in vivo studies further confirm that the treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy for LC-CD133 + can be improved by the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA. In conclusion, we demonstrated that Oct-4 expression plays a crucial role in maintaining the self-renewing, cancer stem-like, and chemoradioresistant properties of LC-CD133 + . Future research is warranted regarding the up-regulated expression of Oct-4 in LC-CD133 + and malignant lung cancer.",

            "text": "Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in industrialized countries [1, 2] . Radiotherapy and chemotherapy play significant and crucial roles in clinical antilung cancer treatment to achieve prolonged patient survival [3, 4] . However, a high failure rate and low median survival rate are observed in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy with recurrent, intractable lung cancer [5] . To improve the patient survival rate, investigation to elucidate the mechanism of tumorigenesis of lung cancer is needed [5] . Recent data have demonstrated that tumors contain a small subpopulation of cells, i.e., cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) or cancer-initiating cells (CICs), which exhibit a selfrenewing capacity and are responsible for tumor maintenance and metastasis [6] . Stem cells have been isolated by their ability to efflux Hoechst 33342 dye and are referred to as the ''side population (SP)'' [7] . Ho and colleagues isolated and characterized SP cells from six human lung cancer cell lines and showed that an elevated expression of ABCG2 as well as other ATP-binding cassette transporters were positively correlated with resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs [8] . In addition, Gutova and colleagues have purified uPAR-positive CSCs from three lung cancer cell lines. These uPAR-positive cells co-expressed with CD44 and MDR1, and had the ability to promote advanced malignancy and chemoresistance [9] .",

Based on immunohistochemical findings, Hilbe and colleagues suggested that CD133-positive (CD133 + ) progenitor cells play a role in the development of tumor vasculature in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [20] . More recently, a well-designed study by Eramo and colleagues showed that lung cancer contains a population of CD133 + CSCs able to self-renew and generate an unlimited progeny of non-tumorigenic cells. These CD133 + cells are also resistant to conventional chemotherapy [21] . However, the gene regulation mechanisms in maintaining the self-renewal and drugresistant properties in putative cancer stem-like cells of lung tumors are still unclear.",

Oct-4 mRNA is normally found in totipotent and pluripotent stem cells of pregastrulation embryos [24] . Knocking out the Oct-4 gene in mice causes early lethality due to the lack of ICM formation, indicating that Oct-4 has a critical function for self-renewal of ES cells [25] . Oct-4 activates transcription via octamer motifs, and Oct-4 binding sites have been found in various genes, including fgf 4 (fibroblast growth factor 4) and pdgfar (platelet-derived growth factor a receptor) [26, 27] . This suggests that Oct-4 functions as a master switch during differentiation by regulating the pluripotent potentials of the stem cell, and Oct-4 plays a pivotal role in mammalian development [24, 25] .",

Four weeks after 10 4 cells were injected into the tail veins of SCID mice, a significant increase in the multiple nodules of tumor formation on lung surface was noted in the LC-CD133 + -injected group (Figs. 3A4 & 3A7) but not in the LC-CD133 2 group (Fig. 3A1) .

            "text": "Enhanced Chemo-and Radiation-resistance in LC-CD133 + We evaluated the multidrug (chemotherapy)-resistant abilities of LC-CD133 + and LC-CD133 2 . We further tested four common chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin, VP16 (etoposide), doxorubicin, paclitaxel. Compared with LC-CD133 2, LC-CD133 + are significantly resistant to the four tested chemotherapeutic agents (p,0.01; Fig. 4A ). To further determine the radiation effect on the rate of tumor growth, we used an ionizing radiation (IR) dose from 0 to 10 Gy to treat both LC-CD133 + and LC-CD133 2 . As shown in Fig. 3B , after IR treatment, the survival rate and number of LC-CD133 + were significantly higher than those of LC-CD133 2 (p,0.01). We further found that the LC-CD133 + cells possess a higher degree of radioresistance (p,0.01; Fig. 4B ). Moreover, we investigated the combined treatment effect of radiochemotherapy in LC-CD133 + . Experiments were conducted with cisplatin (10 mM) alone, VP-16 (10 mM) alone, or combined cisplatin and VP-16 on IR (2 Gy)-treated LC-CD133 + . As shown in Figure 3C , the data revealed that the cell survival rate in IR-treated LC-CD133 + was not significantly decreased by the IR treatment combined with cisplatin, with or without VP-16 (p.0.05). On the contrary, cell survival significantly declined after chemotherapy with cisplatin combined with VP-16 in IR-treated LC-CD133 2 (p,0.01; Fig. 4C ). These results suggest that LC-CD133 + may play a vital role in the tumor's ability to resist radiation and chemotherapies. To investigate whether Oct-4 expression plays a role in maintaining self-renewal or cancer stem-like properties in LC-CD133 + , we used the siRNA method with lentiviral vector for knockdown of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133 + . We found it important that the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA in LC-CD133 + can significantly interfere with the capabilities of spheroid-like bodies (SB) formation (p,0.001; Fig. 5C ). After 7 days of the Oct-4 siRNA treatment, the SB of LC-CD133 + could not maintain floating spheres but differentiated into attached epithelial-like cells (Fig. 5C ). In contrast, the treatment of scramble control siRNA did not influence the SB formation capability in LC-CD133 + (Fig. 5C) . The SB of LC-CD133 + endogenously expressed strong positive signals for Oct-4 and CD133 (Fig. 5D) . Furthermore, the immunofluorescent results demonstrated that both the CD133 and Oct-4 expressions in LC-CD133 + were significantly blocked after 7 days of Oct-4 siRNA treatment (Fig. 5D) . FASC assay confirmed that the amount of CD133 was dramatically decreased in Oct-4 siRNA-treated LC-CD133 + and the percentages of LC-CD133 2 were significantly increased in LC-CD133 + after 7 days of Oct-4 siRNA treatment (p,0.001; Fig. 5E ). These data suggested that Oct-4 may maintain the properties of primitive stem cells and inhibit the tendency for differentiation in LC-CD133 + .",

Furthermore, the treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy for the LC-CD133 + group can be significantly improved by the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA compared with nontreated LC-CD133 + or LC-CD133 + treated by scramble-siRNA ( Fig. 6B; p,0.001 ). In addition, we found that the apoptotic activities of annexin V (Fig. 6C) and caspase 3 (Fig. 6D; upper part) were quickly and effectively induced in LC-CD133 + treated by Oct-4 siRNA after 72 hours. In accordance with the result of cell survival and treatment effects in Oct-4 siRNA-treated LC-CD133 + (Fig. 6B) , the western blot data further demonstrated that the amounts of activated (cleaved) form of PARP were consistently elevated in LC-CD133 + treated by Oct-4 siRNA with IR alone or combined with chemotherapy ( Fig. 6D; lower part) . Thus, knockdown of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133 + can effectively enhance chemoradiosensitivities and apoptotic activities in response to IR and chemotherapy, suggesting that Oct-4 could be a key factor enables LC-CD133 + to resist radiochemotherapeutic stress.",

We first injected 10 4 LC-CD133 + -GFP cells into the subcutaneous sites of nude mice with different treatment protocols.

Oct-4 has been suggested as one of four major factors that render the reprogramming capability of adult cells into germline-competent-induced pluripotent stem cells [31] [32] [33] . Previous studies also showed that mouse pulmonary stem cells endogenously express Oct-4 [34] . Recently, Oct-4 transcript can be consistently detected in human embryonal carcinomas, testicular germ cell tumors, seminomas, and bladder carcinomas [35] [36] [37] [38] . The expression of Oct-4 has further been shown in human breast cancer stem-like cells, suggesting that its expression may be implicated in self-renewal and tumorigenesis via activating its downstream target genes [39] . Herein we reported the isolation of CD133-positive cells (LC-CD133 + ) from clinical tissue samples and lung cancer cell lines. LC-CD133 + showed strong proliferative and invasive capabilities in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 1, 2, and 3) . LC-CD133 + also displayed significant resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (Fig. 4) . We also demonstrated that Oct-4 expression was transcriptionally and translationally up-regulated in LC-CD133 + (Fig. 5) . Indeed, Oct-4 functions as a master switch during differentiation by regulating the pluripotent potential in stem cells [31] [32] [33] . Using the siRNA method with lentiviral vector for knockdown of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133 + , our data showed that the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA can block the sphere formation of LC-CD133 + and further facilitate LC-CD133 + to differentiate into LC-CD133 2 (Fig. 5) . Furthermore, in vivo animal studies demonstrated the IHC of Oct-4 in the lung tumors of LC-CD133 + -injected SCID mice were prominently up-regulated, and the total lung tumor volume as well as Oct-4 IHC levels can be significantly decreased in LC-CD133 + -injected mice by the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA with or without chemoradiotherapy (Fig. 7) . In addition, we showed that increased incidence of Oct-4 expression correlated positively with the advanced stage of 78 lung cancers (Figs. S1A-C). To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that Oct-4 expression plays a crucial role in maintaining selfrenewal and cancer stem-like properties in LC-CD133 + .",

            "text": "The property of resistance to chemotherapy and irradiation treatment is the major clinical criterion to characterize ''cancer stem-like cells (CSCs)'' [6] . The existence of cancer stem-like cells may explain why conventional anti-cancer therapies are able only to suppress or shrink a tumor but often cannot completely eradicate it, resulting in eventual recurrence [6, 40, 41] . Consistent with these hypotheses, LC-CD133 + were significantly resistant to cisplatin, VP16 (eptoposide), doxorubicin, and paclitaxel than LC-CD133 2 (p,0.001; Fig. 4 ). Even IR alone or a single chemodrug can effectively inhibit cell growth of LC-CD133 2 (Fig. 4) ; however, IR treatment combined with cisplatin and VP-16 still failed to cause cell death in treated LC-CD133 + (Fig. 4D) . To overcome resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in LC-CD133 + , treatment of Oct-4 siRNA was used and results showed that the knockdown Oct-4 in LC-CD133 + can significantly improve the anti-cancer effect in single-or combination-treated LC-CD133 + in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 6 and 7) . Moreover, the mean survival rate of the LC-CD133 + group can be significantly prolonged after the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA with IR and chemotherapy (Fig. 7) . Recently, Oct-4 has been suggested to be a protector for survival of ES cells from apoptosis induced by etoposide, UV, or heat shock through the Stat3/Survivin pathway [42] . Consistent with this important finding, our results suggest that knockdown of Oct-4 expression can effectively enhance the chemoradiosensitivity of LC-CD133 + through activating the apoptotic activities of caspase 3 and PARP (Fig. 6) . Importantly, our in vivo animal study and clinical data provide the evidence that the amount of Oct-4 in LC-CD133 + (Fig. 7C ) and in patients with high-grade lung cancer (Fig. S1 ) is positively correlated with the degree of resistance to chemoradiation therapy. Taken together, these results indicate that the up-regulated expression of Oct-4 in LC-CD133 + may contribute to the development of chemoradioresistance in patients with lung cancer.",

Hirschmann-Jax and colleagues were the first to observe that ''side population'' cancer stem-like cells isolated from cell lines and patients with neuroblastoma expressed high levels of ABCG2 and ABCG3 transporter genes as well as a greater capacity to expel cytotoxic drugs [44] . Monzani and colleagues further showed that cancer stem-like cells derived from the melanoma cell line highly coexpressed CD133 and ABCG2 markers with enhanced tumorigenic potential [45] . In this study, we found that LC-CD133 + are highly co-expressed with ABCG2 transporter and are significantly resistant to conventional treatment methods compared with LC-CD133 2 (Figs. 2 & 4) . Interestingly, a significant down-regulating of ABCG2 expression and an increase in the chemosensitivity of LC-CD133 + were observed when the Oct-4 siRNA treatment was given (Data not shown). Thus, more studies are needed to investigate whether over-expression of Oct-4, CD133, and/or ABCG2 play a role in the development of MDR in LC-CD133 + or surrogate markers of therapeutic response in patients with lung cancer.",
