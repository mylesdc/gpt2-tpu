            "text": "The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins inhibit a wide range of viruses. We previously reported the inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strain BH10 by human IFITM1, 2 and 3. It is unknown whether other HIV-1 strains are similarly inhibited by IFITMs and whether there exists viral countermeasure to overcome IFITM inhibition. We report here that the HIV-1 NL4-3 strain (HIV-1 NL4-3 ) is not restricted by IFITM1 and its viral envelope glycoprotein is partly responsible for this insensitivity. However, HIV-1 NL4-3 is profoundly inhibited by an IFITM1 mutant, known as \u0394(117-125), which is deleted of 9 amino acids at the C-terminus. In contrast to the wild type IFITM1, which does not affect HIV-1 entry, the \u0394(117-125) mutant diminishes HIV-1 NL4-3 entry by 3-fold. This inhibition correlates with the predominant localization of \u0394(117-125) to the plasma membrane where HIV-1 entry occurs. In spite of strong conservation of IFITM1 among most species, mouse IFITM1 is 19 amino acids shorter at its C-terminus as compared to human IFITM1 and, like the human IFITM1 mutant \u0394(117-125), mouse IFITM1 also inhibits HIV-1 entry. This is the first report illustrating the role of viral envelope protein in overcoming IFITM1 restriction. The results also demonstrate the importance of the C-terminal region of IFITM1 in modulating the antiviral function through controlling protein subcellular localization.",

            "text": "Interferon inhibits virus infection by inducing the expression of hundreds of host genes, known as Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), some of which encode antiviral effectors [1] . Among these antiviral proteins are a small protein family called interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins. IFITMs have an average length of 130 amino acids, contain two predicted transmembrane domains and a conserved intracellular domain [2, 3] . Although IFITM1 was shown to modestly inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) more than a decade ago [4, 5] , the antiviral function of IFITM1, 2 and 3 was established only when their potent restriction of influenza A virus, West Nile virus and Dengue virus was reported in a genome-wide functional screen [6] . Subsequent studies revealed that many viruses are susceptible to IFITM restriction. These include flaviviruses (West Nile virus, dengue virus, and yellow fever virus), filoviruses (Marburg virus and Ebola virus), SARS coronavirus, reovirus, Rift Valley fever virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), and others [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] (reviewed in [14, 15] ). The in vivo importance of IFITM proteins in antiviral defense is supported by their protection of mice from influenza A virus infection [16, 17, 18] . In support of this, single nucleotide polymorphisms in ifitm3 gene have been shown to associate with pathogenesis severity of influenza A virus infection in humans [16, 19] .",

            "text": "Humans have five ifitm genes, including ifitm1, ifitm2, ifitm3, ifitm5 and ifitm10. They are clustered within a 26.5kb region on chromosome 11 except for ifitm10 that is located 1.4 Mb downstream [2, 20, 21] . IFITM5 has a calcium-binding domain at its C-terminal region and is involved in bone mineralization and maturation [22] . IFITM5 has thus also been named bone restricted ifitm-like protein (Bril). IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 are expressed in a variety of tissues. Their expression is stimulated by type I and type II interferon due to the presence of the interferon stimulation response element (ISRE) in their promoters [2, 23] . In addition to their roles in antiviral defense, IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 have also been reported to participate in antiproliferative signaling, cell adhesion, and oncogenesis (reviewed in [21] ). For instance, expression of these three IFITM members is significantly upregulated in colorectal tumor cells concurrent with the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway [24] . The function of IFITM10 is unknown except that it is the most conserved among all IFITM proteins across many eukaryotic species [20, 25] . IFITM1, 2 and 3 proteins differ in their abilities to inhibit different viruses. For example, IFITM3 inhibits influenza A virus more potently than inhibits Marburg and Ebola viruses; in contrast, these latter two viruses are strongly inhibited by IFITM1 [11] . Further, IFITM2 and IFITM3, but not IFITM1, inhibit Rift Valley fever virus [7] . This different restriction profile is likely a result of the sequence divergence between IFITM1, 2 and 3. IFITM2 and 3 share higher sequence homology between each other than with IFITM1 [21] . In this study, we report that human IFITM1 differentially affects the replication of two closely related HIV-1 strains BH10 and NL4-3 and that the viral envelope glycoprotein is responsible for this differential sensitivity to IFITM1 restriction. Interestingly, deleting the C-terminal sequence of IFITM1 allows the mutant to potently inhibit both BH10 and NL4-3 viruses, which highlights the important role of this C-terminal domain in regulating the antiviral function of IFITM1.",

Given the resistance of HIV-1 NL4-3 to the wild type human IFITM1, we expected that HIV-1 NL4-3 would also be refractory to the C-terminus truncated IFITM1. Surprisingly, IFITM1 mutants \u0394(117-125), \u0394(112-125) and \u0394(108-125) all strongly inhibited HIV-1 NL4-3 replication ( Fig. 1B and 1C) .

One possibility is that this sequence may serve as a retention signal to sequester IFITM1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi [26] . This hypothesis is refuted by the results showing that blocking endocytosis with the dynamin inhibitor dynasore caused relocation of IFITM1 to the plasma membrane, as opposed to a IFITM1-KDEL variant that had the ER retention signal KDEL inserted at the Cterminus and exhibited ER localization even in the presence of dynasore (Fig. 3B) .

This prompted us to test whether they would act like C-terminal truncations of human IFITM1 and inhibit HIV-1 deletion mutations are indicated. Both the wild type and mutated IFITM1 have a Flag tag attached to the N-terminus. Levels of the wild type and mutated IFITM1 in stably transduced SupT1 cells were examined by western blotting.

The results showed that exchange of the 2.7kb DNA fragment, located between the SalI and BamH1 restriction sites (called SB fragment), allowed BH(SB) resistant to IFITM1 and, reciprocally, NL(SB) sensitive to IFITM1 inhibition (Fig. 5B ). This SB DNA fragment encodes four viral proteins, Tat, Rev, Vpu and Env. To further determine which viral protein plays the countering role, we exchanged between HIV-1 BH10 and HIV-1 NL4-3 only the Env sequence. The results of infection experiments showed that HIV-1 NL4-3 Env enabled HIV-1 BH10 to replicate in IFITM1-expressing cells, whereas inserting the Env of HIV-1 BH10 into HIV-1 NL4-3 dramatically reduced virus replication in the presence of IFITM1 (Fig. 5C) , supporting the role of NL4-3 Env in overcoming IFITM1 inhibition. No significant effect in this regard was observed for the small DNA fragment that is located between the SalI site and the beginning of Env (Fig. 5C ).",

            "text": "HIV-1 NL4-3 is more efficient than HIV-1 BH10 in cell-to-cell transmission One mechanism behind the IFITM1 inhibition of HIV-1 BH10 is the reduction in Gag/p24 levels in the infected cells as well as the diminution in virus production ( Fig. 6A and 6B ) [10] . Similar defects were also observed for HIV-1 NL4-3 infection of IFITM1-expressing SupT1 cells ( Fig. 6C  and 6D ), which indicates that HIV-1 NL4-3 escapes IFITM1 in the spread infection without the need to restore this decrease in Gag/p24 expression. We recently reported that HIV-1 BH10 became resistant to IFITM1 restriction in the spread infection through acquiring mutations in viral Env and Vpu proteins that together enhance the virus transmission between cells [27] . In order to test whether the same mechanism supports the resistance of HIV-1 NL4-3 to IFITM1, we compared the cell-to-cell transmission efficiency of HIV-1 BH10 and HIV-1 NL4-3 . Indeed, HIV-1 NL4-3 was 3-fold more efficient than HIV-1 BH10 in transmitting between SupT1 cells (Fig. 7A ). This phenotype was readily reversed when the Env sequence was exchanged between HIV-1 BH10 and HIV-1 NL4-3 , either by exchanging the SB fragment or the Env sequence alone (Fig. 7A) . Similar observations were made for virus transmission from control SupT1 cells to SupT1 cells expressing IFITM1 (Fig. 7B) . Collectively, these data suggest that the Env protein of HIV-1 NL4-3 mediates greater cell-to-cell transmission, a property that may allow HIV-1 to escape IFITM1 inhibition under the virus spread infection condition.",

This finding allowed us to identify the viral component(s) in NL4-3 that gave rise to IFITM1 resistance. Results of mutagenesis and virus replication studies revealed an essential role of viral Env protein in HIV-1 NL4-3 evasion from IFITM1. Exchanging the Env sequences between BH10 and NL4-3 reversed the susceptibility of the parental strains to IFITM1 inhibition. This role of HIV-1 Env protein in determining viral sensitivity to IFITM1 corroborates our recent report showing that HIV-1 BH10 was able to develop resistance to IFITM1 through mutating Env and Vpu [27] . There are precedents illuminating the function of viral Env in overcoming host restriction. One example is the HIV-2 Env that antagonizes tetherin [28] . In addition, HIV-1 Env has been shown to regulate the establishment of latent infection in resting CD4+ T cells [29] , likely through modulating the functionality of certain cellular pathways [30] . In the case of IFITM1, it remains to determine whether HIV-1 Env serves as the viral target of IFITM1 or Env acts as a viral antagonist to counter IFITM1.",

To our surprise, in spite of being inhibited to similar degrees in the one-round infection assay, only HIV-1 BH10 , but not HIV-1 NL4-3 , is crippled by IFITM1 in the long-term virus replication assay (Fig. 1) . These seemingly conflicting observations could be reconciled by the major difference between the one-round infection and the long-term infection, i.e. the latter infection mode involves virus cell-to-cell transmission that actually dominates HIV-1 transmission over infection by free virus particles [31] . It is thus possible that the superiority of HIV-1 NL4-3 over HIV-1 BH10 in replicating in IFITM1expression SupT1 cells, despite that both viruses are equally impaired by IFITM1 in the oneround infection, might be a result of the greater ability of HIV-1 NL4-3 to transmit between cells. Indeed, we found that HIV-1 NL4-3 was 3-fold more efficient in transmission from cell to cell than HIV-1 BH10 . HIV-1 NL4-3 has therefore utilized its strong cell-to-cell transmission to compensate for the deficiency in virus production caused by IFITM1.",

Inserting the Env sequence of HIV-1 BH10 into HIV-1 NL4-3 diminishes cell-to-cell transmission of the parental virus. Reciprocally, HIV-1 NL4-3 Env protein increases cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1 BH10 by 3-fold. Concurrent with the change in cell-to-cell transmission, this exchange in Env sequences also switches the sensitivity of HIV-1 BH10 and HIV-1 NL4-3 to human IFITM1. One possible scenario is that HIV-1 Env protein may modulate virus sensitivity to human IFITM1 restriction by virtue of its ability to mediate and regulate virus cell-to-cell transmission. The Env sequences of HIV-1 BH10 and HIV-1 NL4-3 differ at 23 amino acid positions. Changing each of these 23 amino acids in HIV-1 BH10 Env to the counterpart in HIV-1 NL4-3 did not increase the resistance of HIV-1 BH10 to human IFITM1 (data not shown). It can be conceived that two or more of these 23 amino acids in Env are required to generate resistance to IFITM1.",

Interestingly, IFITM1 gains the ability to inhibit HIV-1 entry when its C-terminal sequence is truncated (Fig. 2) . In agreement with this observation, C-terminal truncation enhances the ability of IFITM1 to promote the infection of Coronavirus OC43 [32] . This gained function appears to be virus specific, since the truncated IFITM1 does not affect virus entry mediated by VSV G protein (Fig. 2) . One possible explanation of this differential inhibition is that HIV-1 and VSV adopt different pathways for entry. HIV-1 entry is pH-independent and occurs at the plasma membrane, whereas VSV enters cells in the endosomes of low pH [33, 34] . In support of this scenario, removal of the last 9 amino acids from the C-terminus of human IFITM1 relocates this protein from intracellular sites to cell periphery (Fig. 3) . This cellular locationdependent inhibition phenomenon was previously reported for IFITM3. Deleting the endocytic sorting signal 20-YEML-23 in IFITM3 led to redistribution of IFITM3 to the plasma membrane and the consequent loss of inhibition of influenza A virus entry that takes place at late endosomes [35, 36, 37, 38] . In addition to the regulation by their own sequences, subcellular distribution of IFITMs can also be modulated by other factors. For example, compared to its intracellular localization in 293T cells as shown in this study, the exogenous IFITM1 has been observed at the plasma membrane in A549 cells [39] . In addition to the cell type-dependent effect, other factors including expression levels and treatment with interferon may also affect where IFITM proteins are localized in cells.",

Since both HIV-1 BH10 and HIV-1 NL4-3 are strains that have been propagated in cultured human T cell lines, they have adapted to the in vitro culture conditions and as a result, they could have lost the original viral sequences that confer resistance to IFITM1, which may have happened to HIV-1 BH10 .

The virus stocks were named HIV-1 NL4-3 /BlaM-Vpr that has HIV-1 envelope protein, and NLENY1/VSV-G/BlaM-Vpr that has the VSV-G protein as the envelope, respectively. The amount of viruses in each stock was determined by measuring viral p24(CA) in ELISA. The SupT1 cell lines were first treated with doxycyline (0.5 mg/ml) for 16 hours, then infected with either HIV-1NL4-3/BlaM-Vpr (an amount equivalent to 100 ng viral p24(CA)) or NLENY1/ VSV-G/BlaM-Vpr (an amount equivalent to 50 ng viral p24(CA)) by spinnoculation at 1,800 x g for 45 min at room temperature.
