            "text": "To investigate the factors associated with death and describe the gestational outcomes in pregnant women with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, we conducted a case-control study (deaths and recovered) in hospitalized pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo from June 9 to December 1, 2009. All cases were evaluated, and four controls that were matched by the epidemiological week of hospitalization of the case were randomly selected for each case. Cases and controls were selected from the National Disease Notification System-SINAN Influenza-web. The hospital records from 126 hospitals were evaluated, and home interviews were conducted using standardized forms. A total of 48 cases and 185 controls were investigated. Having had a previous health visit to a healthcare provider for an influenza episode before hospital admission was a risk factor for death (adjusted OR (OR adj ) of 7.93, 95% CI 2.19-28.69). Although not significant in the multiple analysis (OR adj of 2.13, 95% CI 0.91-5.00), the 3 rd trimester deserves attention, with an OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.13-4.37 in the univariate analysis. Antiviral treatment was a protective factor when administered within 48 hours of symptom onset (OR adj = 0.16, 95% CI 0.05-0.50) and from 48 to 72 hours (OR adj = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.87). There was a higher proportion of fetal deaths and preterm births among cases (p = 0.001) and live births with low weight (p = 0.019), compared to control subjects who gave birth during hospitalization. After discharge, control subjects had a favorable neonatal outcome. Early antiviral treatment during the presence of a flu-like illness is an important factor in reducing mortality from influenza in pregnant women and unfavorable neonatal outcomes. It is important to monitor pregnant women, particularly in the 3 rd trimester of gestation, with influenza illness for diagnosis and early treatment.",

Most studies evaluate risk factors for increased severity in pregnant women [8, 9, 10, 11] and few studies have analyzed the risk factors for death in pregnant women from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. A systematic review study showed a higher risk of hospitalization in pregnant women with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, with relative risks ranging from 4.3 to 7.2. However, only one study showed a higher risk of death in pregnant women with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (RR 10.2) and seven studies presented no significant risks (0.3 to 1.3) [12] . Meta-analysis also showed no higher risk of death in pregnant women with pandemic influenza, OR 0.99 (95% CI 0.67 to 1.46) [8] . A higher risk of fetal abnormalities in pregnant women with both seasonal influenza virus infection and A(H1N1)pdm09 infection was reported. In addition, women with a diagnosis of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection had a higher risk of placental problems, antepartum haemorrhage, and antepartum complications [13] .",

The controls were matched by epidemiological week of admission date of the case to adjust for possible variations in access to treatment and clinical protocols.

            "text": "The case control design, including all reported deaths of hospitalized patients who presented with laboratory confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with SARI in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, and the random selection of four controls for each case, with the collection of hospital data and home interviews, allowed for the expansion of the analysis of risk factors for death. It was possible to evaluate the gestational and neonatal outcomes, including those of pregnant women who delivered after hospital discharge. The main results suggest that an early search for care, the training of physicians for the proper treatment of pregnant women, and early antiviral administration can be protective factors against death. Another noteworthy result was the presence of unfavorable neonatal outcomes, with a significant proportion of stillbirths and miscarriages, low birth weights and lower Apgar scores among pregnant women who died. After hospital discharge, the patients had a favorable neonatal outcome. Pre-eclampsia was present in six percent of women who evolved to death and in less than one percent of those who survived. Despite the fact that all women who died had the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 infection as the main cause of death in their death certificate, we cannot rule out the possibility that pre-eclampsia may have contributed to their unfavourable outcome. Age distribution and race were not associated with a risk of death in pregnant women, similar to results in other studies [9, 10, 11] . The third trimester of gestation lost its significance as risk factor for death in the multiple analyses, when antivirus treatment was included in the model. A higher proportion of women in the final period of gestation received the treatment after 72 hours of symptoms than those who were at earlier stages of gestation. A meta-analysis study showed that the third trimester of gestation was a risk factor for death (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.48) for pandemic influenza, when compared with those in the first or second trimester [12] . Although the present study did not confirm the association with the third trimester of gestation, its result indicates that it is important to monitor pregnant women with influenza illness, with special attention during this trimester, for diagnosis and early treatment.",

This increased risk could be an indication of difficulties in accessing hospitalization or lack of perception of the severity of the case by doctors or lack of recognition that, even in cases that are not serious, considering that pregnant women are in a high risk group for severity of the disease, early antiviral therapy should have been introduced. The median time between the first symptoms and hospitalization was twice as high among pregnant women who died. Similar results were found when patients in general with influenza during the pandemic were evaluated in S\u00e3o Paulo [17] and in Mexico [18] . These findings also reinforce the need for pregnant women to have access to health services, particularly hospitalization in serious cases. The training of physicians concerning the proper care for pregnant women and the need to start early treatment are as important as the early search for care.",

Although all hospital reports were reviewed, we were not able to establish the roles of other factors, such as secondary infections or obstetric factors, which could have contributed to death in the cases. The results presented in this study indicate that early treatment can prevent unfavorable outcomes in pregnant women and in their offspring and reinforce the need for the proper training of doctors for the clinical management of pregnant women and early administration of antiviral treatment.
