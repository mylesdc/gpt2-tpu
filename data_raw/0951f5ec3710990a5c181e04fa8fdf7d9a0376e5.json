In both mono-and co-infected individuals, intra-hepatic HCV-specific Tcells were poorly functional compared to HIV-specific T-cells.

Among those with persistent HCV infection, HIV co-infection is associated with higher HCV viremia and more rapid progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [3] . A recent meta-analysis showed that HIV co-infection increased the risk of histological hepatic cirrhosis by two-fold and clinically decompensated liver disease by six-fold [4] . In addition, HCV co-infection is associated with increased incidence of HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) related liver injury [5] .",

Ex-vivo HCV-specific CD8 + T-cell responses in peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs) from mono-infected individuals are generally weak [8] . Although, peripheral HCVspecific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses are somewhat weaker in HCV/HIV co-infected individuals [9] , similar frequencies of intra-hepatic HCV-specific responses appear to be obtained in HCV versus HCV/HIV co-infection [10, 11] . However, ex-vivo HIV-specific CD8 + T-cell responses in PBMCs from HIV monoinfected individuals are about one log higher than ex-vivo HCVspecific responses in HCV mono-infection. In addition, impairment in cellular immune responses to HCV compared to HIV has been shown in HCV/HIV co-infection [12] . HIV-specific CD8 + T-cells are easily detectable in blood of untreated HIV infected individuals [13] . Such high frequencies of HIV-specific T-cells circulating in peripheral blood led us to question whether these cells could also migrate to the liver in HCV/HIV co-infection and through bystander responses add to the inflammation induced by HCV-specific T-cells.",

Mapped peptides were then pooled to evaluate hepatic responses.

These pools spanned HIV-Gag and HCV-NS3, HCV-NS4 and HCV-Core protein (2 mg/peptide/ml, from National Institute of Health Reagent Program).

The finding of HIV-specific T-cells within liver of co-infected individuals may not altogether be surprising, given the high frequencies of HIV-specific CD8 + T-cells found in the peripheral blood in untreated HIV infection. Nevertheless, it is surprising to find functional T-cells of such viral specificities to be accumulating in liver. In contrast, we could not detect CMVspecific T-cells in co-infected liver despite their abundance in blood indicating that different viruses target T-cells to the liver. Recent studies have demonstrated that systemic viral infections may recruit viral-specific T-cells to the liver. The significance of non-hepatotropic viral-specific T-cells that are found in liver is unclear. It has been postulated that the liver can non-selectively trap activated T-cells during any infection, and thus act as a 'sink' or 'graveyard' [18] , however it is unclear whether these cells are rendered anergic while traveling in the liver or contribute to inflammation and damage as a result of bystander activation. Of note, is that hepatitis has been observed in measles [19] , SARS [20] and in 20% of individuals with acute HIV infection [21] . Polakos et. al. [22] found that some individuals infected with influenza-A develop transaminitis and showed in a murine influenza model that influenza-specific CD8 + T-cells migrate to Figure 3 . Polychromatic FACS analysis of viral-specific T cells in HCV/HIV co-infection. Shown are representative FACS data of the HIV and HCV specific multi-parameter CD8 + T-cell responses from (a) liver and (b) blood of subject OM 405, a therapy-na\u00efve HCV/HIV co-infected individual, after in vitro stimulation using pool of HIV and HCV peptides. Initial gating on forward scatter area (FSC-A) versus height (FSC-H) was used to remove doublets. The events were further gated on forward scatter (FSC) versus the dead cell marker to remove dead cells. Lymphocytes were gated on the remaining live cells on a FSC versus SSC plot. Gates on CD3 + /CD8 + cells were then generated. All responses are gated on a CD3 + /CD8 + population and presented against TNF-a on the x-axis. Figure (c) shows a comparison of the frequency of HIV and HCV-specific CD8 + T-cells in the liver and blood of therapy-na\u00efve, co-infected individuals. All intra-hepatic HCV-specific responses are significantly stronger than peripheral HCV-specific responses. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0003454.g003 Non-hepatotropic viruses such as HIV, CMV and EBV, in general do not induce chronic hepatitis, thus, it is possible that the coexistence of hepatotropic viruses may alter the hepatic environment to allow recruitment of activated T-cells non-specifically. This could be due to an up-regulation of integrins such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in hepatic sinusoids as previously shown during HCV infection [23] that could enhance T-cell recruitment. In this regard, Spangenberg et. al. [24] demonstrated the presence of influenza-specific T-cells in about 50% of liver biopsies from HCV mono-infected individuals.",

This observation may explain the added contribution of HIV-specific immune responses to the ongoing intrahepatic damage induced by HCV-specific T-cell responses that are inefficient in clearing the virus. Therapy na\u00efve co-infected individuals demonstrated a higher frequency of intra-hepatic CD8 + T-cells that produce TNF-a in response to both HCV and HIV antigen stimulation compared to HCV mono-infected individuals. In addition, we identified CD8 + T-cells specific for an immunodominant HIV epitope in co-infected liver, demonstrating high frequency of TNF-a expression. Intra-hepatic TNF-a has been previously associated with liver fibrosis, and the accumulation of cells expressing this marker may explain in part the faster rate of liver disease progression found in HCV/HIV coinfection. Further comparisons of TNF-a responses between immunodominant HCV and other HIV epitopes in a larger cohort of individuals are warranted. Contrary to our expectation, viral-specific, intra-hepatic levels of IFN-c were also higher in the therapy-na\u00efve co-infected group, which would be against the expected protective role of IFN-c. However, we interpret this observation as a potential effect of the fibrogenic TNF-a to mask IFN-c protection. On the other hand, viral-specific T-cells are composed of several major populations with unique functional patterns. Therefore, measurement of only one or two T-cell functions may not provide a comprehensive picture of the quality of T-cell responses.",

The significance of Tcell populations simultaneously representing 5 different functions has been discussed as a hierarchical functional model in viral infections such as CMV and EBV which are effectively controlled by respective CD8 + T-cells [16] . HCV-specific CD8 + T-cells were not poly-functional which is consistent with the notion that although HCV-specific T-cells are found in hepatic tissue, their loss of poly-functionality may be associated with inefficient control of HCV replication. HIV-specific T-cells in the liver of co-infected individuals however, simultaneously could express 4 and 5 of the measured markers. Recently, T-cell exhaustion has been related to signaling pathways through PD-1 [28, 29] . Our analysis of PD-1 levels of antigen-specific CD8 + T-cells from co-infected liver demonstrates higher expression of PD-1 on HCV-specific T-cells, compared to those specific for HIV, supporting the notion that the former are less functional. The observed poly-functionality of intra-hepatic HIV-specific T-cells, should have little effect on HCV replication but would further enhance the cytokine milieu induced from bystander activation, and contribute to liver damage during co-infection with HCV. In this regard, we found that the degranulation marker CD107a dominates the HIV-specific CD8 + T-cell responses in the liver, with the majority of the responding cells expressing CD107a, a surrogate marker for the cytotoxic function of CD8 + T-cells. Activated HIV-specific CD8 + T-cells with the potential to degranulate could induce bystander damage. In addition, the release of chemokines such as MIP-1b by the same cells could also attract further lymphocytes without HCV specificity to the liver. Bystander function of these non-specific T-cells could expand the tissue damage triggered by HCV infection and ultimately activate fibrogenesis.",

Liver isolated mononuclear cells were stained with pools of HLA-A*0201 and HLA-A*2402-restricted pentamers (Pro5 MHC class I Pentamers, Proimmune), followed by staining for cell surface markers CD3 and CD8. The following pentamers were used for each group: HCV pentamers: NS3-CINGVCWTV and NS3-KLVALGINAV; HIV pentamers: Pol-ILKEPVHGV and Gag p24-TLNAWVKVV; CMV Pentamers: pp65-NLVPMVATV and pp65-QYDPVAALF.

This permits a very low threshold for detection of positive responses from multiple combinations. Consequently, for multi-parameter analysis, the results were thresholded based on a minimum criterion of positivity, as calculated by SPICE software and presented as the 90 th percentile of negative values for each analysis. Each pie chart generated by SPICE software, represents the hierarchy of responses to either HCV or HIV antigen stimulation. For simplicity, responses are grouped by number of functions and matched to the colored bars, with black bars representing the percentage of responding cells to HIV peptides and gray bars representing the percentage of responses to HCV peptide stimulation. In all pie charts, color red represents the 5+ responding population and the colors blue, green, turquoise, and yellow representing the 4+, 3+, 2+, and 1+ populations respectively. Color-coded arcs represent the dominant marker within each pie slice, with color blue representing TNF-a, red for CD107-a, green for IFN-c and black for MIP-1b. Although IL-2 is included in the presentation and demonstrated by bar graphs, the software would not allow for arc colors for more than 4 responses. As a result there is no arc representative for IL-2.
