Sialic acids present on the epithelial surface have long been considered to be determinants of influenza virus tropism. However, mucus which is also rich in sialic acids may serve as the first barrier of selection. It was investigated how influenza virus interacts with the mucus to infect epithelial cells. Two techniques were applied to track SIV H1N1 in porcine mucus. The microscopic diffusion of SIV particles in the mucus was analyzed by single particle tracking (SPT), and the macroscopic penetration of SIV through mucus was studied by a virus in-capsule-mucus penetration system, followed by visualizing the translocation of the virions with time by immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, the effects of neuraminidase on SIV getting through or binding to the mucus were studied by using zanamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI), and Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase. The distribution of the diffusion coefficient shows that 70% of SIV particles were entrapped, while the rest diffused freely in the mucus. Additionally, SIV penetrated the porcine mucus with time, reaching a depth of 65 mm at 30 min post virus addition, 2 fold of that at 2 min. Both the microscopic diffusion and macroscopic penetration were largely diminished by NAI, while were clearly increased by the effect of exogenous neuraminidase. Moreover, the exogenous neuraminidase sufficiently prevented the binding of SIV to mucus which was reversely enhanced by effect of NAI. These findings clearly show that the neuraminidase helps SIV move through the mucus, which is important for the virus to reach and infect epithelial cells and eventually become shed into the lumen of the respiratory tract.",

Swine influenza virus particles are transmitted by direct contact and through the air in large droplets or as aerosols [1, 4, 5] . During the transmission from pig to pig, the virus first encounters mucus, the first barrier of the respiratory tract. After overcoming this barrier, the virus reaches the target cells in the mucosal epithelium. Influenza virus infects host cells by binding to cellular receptors via one of the major viral glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA). HA binds to sialic acids (SA) on the cell surface and mediates the subsequent membrane fusion leading to virus entry [6] . Neuraminidase (NA) catalyzes the removal of terminal sialic acids on the cellular surface to release the progeny virus [7] . It is well documented that the NA functions at the releasing stage of the virus replication [8] [9] [10] , while little is known if NA plays a role during the virus entry into host cells and even less on if it helps the virus overcome the mucus layer.",

            "text": "Mucus is a complex mixture of mucous glycoproteins (mucins), proteins, proteases and protease inhibitors, lipids and water [11, 12] . Mucins, the major component of mucus, are highly oglycosylated with glycans covalently linked via N-acetylgalactosamine (GaNAc) to the hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine residues of the mucin backbone [12, 13] . Most of the sugar chains of mucin monomers are terminated with sialic acid, which is also known to be the cellular receptor of influenza viruses. It is hypothesized that influenza viruses bind to these extracellular receptors, get entrapped in the mucus and then are removed by ciliary clearance [14] [15] [16] . Several studies have shown that interaction of influenza virus with mucus results in competitive inhibition of the virus. Roberts et al. [17] showed that preincubation of human H3N2 virus strain A/Victoria/3/75 with ferret nasal washes containing mucus clearly reduced the virus infectivity, and this inhibition was correlated to competitive binding of the virus with alpha 2,3 and 2,6 linked sialic acids (a2,3-and a2,6-SA) present in the mucus secretions. The protective effect of the mucus barrier was confirmed by a recent study using a transgenic mouse model that overexpressed SA a2-3 Gal rich Muc5AC. Transgenic mice challenged with A/PR8/34 H1N1, which preferentially binds a2,3-SA showed significant less infection than the normal mice [18] . These studies suggest that mucus or mucins block the influenza virus infection by competitively inhibiting HA-mediated cell adsorption.",

It has long been assumed that NA promotes virus access to target cells in the airway by mucus degradation. However, this concept is scarcely supported by experimental data. Cohen et al. [19] incubated A/ PR/8/34 H1N1 and A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2 virus with human salivary mucins which were previously coated on magnetic beads, and after extensive washings, detected the remained Neu5AC on the mucins. They showed that these human influenza viruses had cleaved away 40-60% of Neu5AC content of the mucins by their viral neuraminidase. The effective cleavage may allow the efficient release of virus from the mucus. This contrasts with the findings of Ehre et al. [18] who demonstrated a strong protection of Muc5AC up-regulated mice against A/PR/8/34 H1N1 virus infection. Hence, the purified human salivary mucins may not fully reflect the natural mucus as these mucins had been highly modified after attaching to magnetic beads. Unraveling the mechanism behind the penetration of viruses across the mucosal barriers has potentially significant implications for the development of novel antiviral strategies. Therefore, an in vitro model resembling the in vivo situation is needed and the interactions of influenza virus with natural mucus should be studied in depth. In the present study, we aimed to address the following questions:",

Two days before euthanization, the pigs were treated intramuscularly with ceftiofur (Naxcel, Pfizer-1 ml/20 kg body weight) to clear the respiratory tract from possible bacterial infections. The tracheas were dissected and the mucus was gently scraped with a spoon, collected with a syringe, and the mucus samples were stored separately at 270uC until use.

Tracking experiments were performed in press-to-seal silicone isolators (20 mm diameter, 0.5 mm deep, Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium). Our previous study shows that PRV was highly immobilized while 100 nm PGEylated beads were diffusive in porcine respiratory mucus, hence GFP-PRV was used as a negative control and the latter was used as a positive control [20] . GFP-PRV was semi-purified according to the previous protocol [20] . Three microliters of SIV (10 8.5 TCID 50 / ml) or PRV (10 8.5 TCID 50 /ml) suspension or 100 nm PEGylated beads (0.004%, w/v) were mixed with 100 ml of porcine tracheal respiratory mucus by gentle stirring. To determine if NA would affect SIV diffusion, the virus was added to the mucus with or without the presence of 0.02 mM zanamivir (Sigma) or 10 mU/ml Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase (Roche Applied Science). The mixture was placed in a custom made glass chamber. The samples were incubated at 37uC for 10 min on the microscope using a stage-top incubator (Tokai Hit, Fujinomiya, Japan) before SPT measurement. Movies were captured with the NIS Elements AR software (Nikon) at a temporal resolution of 33 ms for 5 s. The illumination time was 30 ms per frame. Trajectories of n $ 500 particles were analyzed for each experiment and three independent experiments were performed for each condition. Movies were analyzed with the Image Processing Software (IPS, in-house developed software) [23] to extract x, y positional data over time. The apparent diffusion coefficient (Da) was calculated as a function of the time scale (t) for each particle. Analysis of the movies was performed with IPS. The centroids of individual particles were identified in each frame of a movie. Based on the positions of the centroids, the trajectories of the particles can be determined by a nearest neighbor algorithm. The apparent diffusion coefficient Da corresponding to the first time lag Dt was calculated according to the classical formula: Da = MSD/4Dt [24] . Afterwards, the distribution of diffusion coefficient of the particles was obtained by maximum entropy method (MEM) analysis [25] .",

The distribution of diffusion coefficient clearly demonstrated that, compared to one immobile fraction for PRV or a mobile fraction for the 100 nm beads, SIV experienced two diffusion patterns in porcine respiratory mucus, with 70% of viral particles being trapped while the rest of particles moving rapidly (Fig. 4A) .

Incubated at 37uC, the virions spread further in the mucus with time. The distribution of penetration depth shows that the majority of SIV particles travelled 10 mm further in the mucus from 2 until 10 min after virus addition and reached a depth of up to 180 mm at 30 min after addition (Fig. 5A) . Similarly to the microscopic diffusion, the distribution of SIV penetration clearly shows two fractions at 30 min after virus addition (Fig. 5B) . About 65% of the viral particles penetrated at 30 min more than 2-fold further than 2 min post virus addition (Fig. 5B) . The average depth of virus penetration at 30 min was significantly higher than that of earlier time points (Fig. 5C) , suggesting that the SIV virions were able to actively penetrate the mucus layer.",

Approximately 55% of the mobile viral particles (with Da larger than 0.2 mm 2 /s) became stuck by the effect of zanamivir whereas the exogenous neuraminidase increased the mobile particles by approximately 15% (Fig. 6B) . Consistently, the presence of zanamivir in virus suspension almost completely inhibited the SIV macroscopic penetration which contrasts the further penetration by the effect of exogenous neuraminidase (Fig. 6C) . The average penetration of mock treated SIV was significantly higher than that of NAI treated virus, while the rise of average penetration from mock to neuraminidase treated virus was also significant (Fig. 6D) .

The virus in-capsulemucus penetration system allows the visualization of virus penetration in mucus layer thereby mimicking the natural conditions. By the use of these models, we were able to track the diffusion of SIV in natural respiratory mucus. In the SPT assay, there were two fractions based on the virus diffusion coefficient, a mobile and an immobile fraction. The ability of SIV to detach from mucus was attributed to the NA activities, as inhibiting NA by the use of zanamivir significantly suppressed the liberation of the virus from the mucus network (Fig. 6A, 6B ). This is also in line with a previous report by Matrosovich et al [26] , which describes that blocking of the NA activities by oseltamivir efficiently inhibited influenza A viruses from infecting the differentiated human airway epithelium cultures which were probably covered by mucin secretions. Furthermore, exogenous neuraminidase was shown to promote both the microscopic diffusion and macroscopic penetration detected by the SPT and virus in-capsule-mucus penetration system (Fig. 6) . This does not only confirm the beneficial effect of neuraminidase on releasing SIV from respiratory mucus, but also highlights bidirectional synergistic interactions between influenza virus and bacterial infections. The influenza virus predisposition to secondary bacterial infections has been thoroughly studied [27, 28] , however, little information exists regarding the impact of bacterial neuraminidase on influenza virus entry and transmission, and further research is needed.",

            "text": "Neuraminidase was indicated to play a role in the SIV releasing from mucus, however, two fractions of viral motion in the mucus lead to a discussion of the way that the virus binds to the mucus. Mucins are the major constitute of mucus and are highly decorated by glycans terminated by sialic acids, thus they are likely to be attributed to the immobilization of SIV in porcine respiratory mucus. Mucins may play direct and indirect roles in host defense distinct from their ability to form adhesion decoys. In addition to mucins, the aqueous mucus layer consists of a great number of host defense agents including lysozyme, lactoferrin, secretory IgA (sIgA), collectins, defensins, cathelicidins, histatins and surfactant proteins [29] [30] [31] . These molecules may function by binding the virions in a receptor-independent pattern. It has been shown that surfactant protein D (SP-D) binds via a carbohydrate recognition domain in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner to N-linked high-mannose carbohydrates present on the HA and NA of the influenza viruses [32] . In addition, sIgA is retained at high concentrations in mucus where it can efficiently trap the pathogens. Last but not least, defensins are of great interest with respect to respiratory viral infection. Human defensins have been shown to bind several types of viruses and inhibit the entry of the viruses to target cells [33, 34] . These components may be retained in mucus by direct binding with mucins or by the biophysical properties of mucus and thus become part of the gel network and provide an immobilized reservoir of protective effectors. Alternatively, it is possible that the viral particles that were immobilized in the mucus were actually incomplete or defective virions or became inactive while being prepared. The production of defective particles has been reported for influenza A viruses [35, 36] . However, the approach of distinguishing active and inactive virions in an entity has not been readily achieved, and will be further examined. While vaccination remains the primary option for the prevention and control of influenza, anti-influenza virus drugs are considered as a complementary approach, as vaccine production may not be rapidly achieved. Our findings provide experimental evidence for the essential role of NA in influenza virus penetration through the respiratory mucus. Blocking the NA activities clearly suppressed the movement of virus in mucus (Fig. 6) , illustrating that NA played a role in removing the sialic acids on mucins, which may enable the virus to gain access to the cellular receptors. This suggests the usefulness of neuraminidase inhibitors as prophylactic treatment for influenza. On the other hand, preventative treatment with oseltamivir (Tamiflu) failed to protect the lung from virus replication or inflammation in an in vivo influenza infection study in pigs despite reduced clinical symptoms and virus shedding [37] . This highlights the complexity of the in vivo situation and the minimal benefits neuraminidase inhibitors may have.",

Combining the study of Cohen et al.

A balance of binding to and releasing from the mucin sialic acids, which is determined by the functional balance of HA and NA, may influence how efficiently the virus avoids sticking to mucus. Fluorescence lectin staining on mucus cryosection showed that both a2,3and a2,6-SA were present in the porcine respiratory mucus, with distinct predominance for the latter (Fig. 2) . The binding profile of the SIV strain was not investigated in this study, however, it has been well documented that swine influenza virus isolates, especially those with the avian-like H1 and H3 hemagglutinins showed receptor specificity for both a2,3and a2,6-sialylated glycans [40] [41] [42] .",

The binding of SIV via HA to the porcine respiratory mucus was proved in the present study, and the amount of viral or exogenous NA indeed modulated the extent of viral binding to and releasing from the porcine mucus (Fig. 7) . Concerning the releasing effect, NA which mediates the process also has a substrate preference. It was demonstrated that NA of human and swine influenza viruses have a preferential specificity for a2,3-SA although they cleave both linked sialylated glycans [43, 44] . Therefore, we assume that the sialic acids in respiratory mucus secretions may exert an effect on influenza virus transmission.",

            "text": "(1) Production of enzymes that aid the virus movement through the mucus. Influenza virus binds to and uses sialic acid-containing molecules as receptors. It is because of this capability that influenza virus has evolved a second viral surface protein, neuraminidase, as a receptordestroying enzyme that cleaves sialic acid, allowing the virus to be released after binding to sialic acid-containing molecules that do not lead to viral infection. This strategy is utilized as well by many other microbes, such as E. histolytica [46, 47] , Vibrio cholerae [48] , Helicobacter pylori [49] , Reovirus [50] and Coronavirus [51] , to subvert or avoid the mucus barrier. The production of enzymes, including mucinase, sialidase, glycosidase, elastase, and hydrolase, which are capable of degrading mucin core proteins and mucin carbohydrates facilitates microbes to swim through the mucus layer. Furthermore, the enzymes that the microbes produce may also facilitate the invasion of other pathogens. In women with bacterial vaginosis, the overgrowth of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria that produce sialidase, glycosidases and other mucin-degrading enzymes causes a breakdown in the barrier properties of cervicovaginal mucus, thereby destroying the mucus gel and helping other sexually transmitted pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to invade [52] . (2) The use of abundant and ubiquitous molecules as receptors. Although there may be a risk of binding to decoy receptors, the use of abundant and ubiquitous molecules as receptors provides the apparent advantage to the virus for allowing infection of multiple cell types and species. This can result in a low minimal infectious dose for initial infection. Based on the data of diffusion and penetration, the effects of the mucus network that virions encounter are so extreme that only a part of the particles can escape and reach susceptible target cells ultimately. Thus the viruses which require lower minimal infectious doses for the same tissues may gain higher chance to establish an infection. (3) Spreads via aerosol. The slow settle of aerosols in the air can cause prolonged contact of the virus with the respiratory tract which benefits the virus penetration through the mucus layer. Furthermore, aerosol droplets can travel much more efficiently to the lower respiratory tract and the mucociliary apparatus may need a longer time to transport and exclude the virions out of the respiratory tract, which increases the chance of these viruses to penetrate through the mucus layer and reach the target cells eventually.",

However, the ability of the viral neuraminidase to cleave sialic acid from mucus has not been investigated due to technical limitation. The viscous property impedes the separation of the free sialic acids from the mucus even if they would have been cleaved by the viral neuraminidase. Investigating the role of influenza virus neuraminidase in the cleavage of sialic acid from mucus may shed some light on unravelling the mechanism of influenza pneumonia. Hence the effect of influenza virus neuraminidase on mucus needs to be studied.",

Hundred and twenty measurements were performed on three independent mucus samples. (D) Average penetration depth of NAI, AUNA and mock treated SIV through mucus at 30 min post virus addition. Three independent samples were performed, and error bars indicate the standard deviation. The asterisks (** and *) indicate statistical significance (P,0.01, and P,0.05, respectively, by Student's t-test). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0110026.Effects of NA on SIV binding to porcine respiratory mucus shown by confocal microscopy. (A) Virions (green) bound to mucus sections in the presence or absence (Mock) of Zanamivir (NAI) or Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase (AUNA). (B) Quantification of viral particles bound to mucus (per 10 5 mm 2 ). The error bars indicate the standard deviation from 3 independent experiments. The asterisks (** and *) show the significance difference (P,0.01, and P,0.05 by Student's t-test). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0110026.g007",
