            "text": "Many viral pathogens are persistently transmitted by insect vectors and cause agricultural or health problems. Generally, an insect vector can use autophagy as an intrinsic antiviral defense mechanism against viral infection. Whether viruses can evolve to exploit autophagy to promote their transmission by insect vectors is still unknown. Here, we show that the autophagic process is triggered by the persistent replication of a plant reovirus, rice gall dwarf virus (RGDV) in cultured leafhopper vector cells and in intact insects, as demonstrated by the appearance of obvious virus-containing double-membrane autophagosomes, conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II and increased level of autophagic flux. Such virus-containing autophagosomes seem able to mediate nonlytic viral release from cultured cells or facilitate viral spread in the leafhopper intestine. Applying the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or silencing the expression of Atg5 significantly decrease viral spread in vitro and in vivo, whereas applying the autophagy inducer rapamycin or silencing the expression of Torc1 facilitate such viral spread. Furthermore, we find that activation of autophagy facilitates efficient viral transmission, whereas inhibiting autophagy blocks viral transmission by its insect vector. Together, these results indicate a plant virus can induce the formation of autophagosomes for carrying virions, thus facilitating viral spread and transmission by its insect vector. We believe that such a role for virus-induced autophagy is common for vector-borne persistent viruses during their transmission by insect vectors.",

Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process that mediates the clearance of long-lived proteins and damaged organelles via a lysosomal degradative pathway [6, 7] . The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways has been shown to control autophagy [9, 10] . These factors work in coordination to regulate autophagy, including the formation of autophagosomes and their fusion with lysosomes [4] . Under normal conditions, autophagy proceeds at a basal level, but it is significantly activated in response to a variety of stimuli, such as viral infection, nutrient starvation, and energy depletion [4, 11] . Although autophagy commonly serves as a defense mechanism against viral infection, some viruses appear to have evolved to exploit this mechanism to promote their survival and replication in different ways [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .

Previously, by using the model organism Drosophila, autophagy has been proved to play a direct antiviral role against the arbovirus vesicular stomatitis virus [24] . However, little is known about the role of autophagy in the interaction of insect vectors with plant viruses that they transmit. Recently, Wang et al. report that the begomovirus tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) can activate autophagy in whitefly vectors to induce resistance to viral infection [25] . Thus, autophagy could serve as a defense mechanism against viral infection in insect vectors. Whether viruses can evolve to activate and exploit autophagy to promote their transmission by insect vectors is not well known.",

RGDV, which causes substantial yield loss in southern China and Southeast Asia, was first described in 1979 in Thailand [26] . RGDV propagates well and circulates in the body of its insect vector R. dorsali [27, 28] . Previously, we find that RGDV infection can directly remodel and utilize a variety of cellular structures and pathways for efficient propagation in its insect vector [29] [30] [31] . For example, RGDV particles are arrayed in an orderly manner close to the mitochondrial outer membrane during viral replication in vector cells, suggesting that mitochondria might support the energy demands of viral propagation in the insect vector [29] . Furthermore, RGDV particles are associated with microtubules either directly or via intermediate filaments to facilitate intracellular viral spread [30, 31] . By contrast, a conserved small interfering RNA (siRNA) antiviral response is triggered by RGDV infection to control viral propagation, avoiding excessive viral accumulation in insect vectors [32] . During viral infection in insect vector cells, abundant RGDV particles can be sequestered in vesicular compartments [2] . Similar vesicular compartments are involved in a nonlytic release of rice dwarf virus (RDV), also a plant reovirus, after fusion with the plasma membrane in virus-infected cultured leafhopper Nephotettix cincticeps cells [33] [34] [35] [36] . In RGDV-infected leafhopper cells, we show that such compartments contain autophagy protein ATG8, indicating a potential role for a cellular autophagy pathway in nonlytic viral release. The subversion of the autophagic pathway by RGDV for in vivo viral spread also is investigated. Thus, we show that a plant virus can evolve to activate and exploit the autophagy to promote its transmission in insect vectors.",

            "text": "To determine whether the autophagy pathway can be induced upon RGDV infection, we first monitored the expression of 3 autophagy-related genes (Ulk1/Atg1, Atg5 and Atg8) in continuous cultured vector cells in a monolayer (VCM) derived from R. dorsalis using an RT-qPCR assay. Our results showed that after inoculation with RGDV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.4, the expression of 3 autophagy-related genes increased rapidly and significantly (P < 0.05) after 48 hours post inoculation (hpi) (S1 Fig). The autophagy-specific protein marker ATG8 is selectively enclosed within autophagosomes, and its breakdown allows measurement of the autophagic rate [8] . Thus, the conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II is generally considered to be a reliable indicator of autophagy [8, 25] . Here, we used ATG8-specific IgG to detect the autophagy pathway induced by RGDV infection in virus-infected R. dorsalis cells. At 48 hpi, the accumulation level of ATG8-II was increased notably in virus-infected VCMs ( Fig 1A) . We then used two inhibitors of autophagy, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and Brefeldin A (BFA) [37, 38] , to confirm RGDV infection activated the autophagy pathway. 3-MA inhibits autophagy due to the suppression of class III PtdIns 3-kinase [37] , and BFA exerts its disruptive effect at the cis-Golgi, further demarcating a contribution of the Golgi with regard to autophagosome biogenesis [38] . At 48 hpi, we found that ATG8-II was almost lost after the treatment with 3-MA or BFA during viral infection of VCMs (Fig 1A and 1B) , indicating that viral infection can induce the conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II. It seems that RGDV infection can induce the autophagy pathway in its insect vector cells.",

Rapamycin, an autophagy inducer that directly inhibits the action of TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex 1), was used as a positive autophagy indicator [4] . Confocal microscopy also showed that after rapamycin or dsTorc1 treatment the level of autophagic signal was obviously detected in uninfected VCMs (S2 Fig). We further observed that ATG8-specific autophagosomes did not colocalize with the viroplasms of viral nonstructural protein Pns9 (Fig 1E) , the site of viral replication and assembly of progeny virions [29, 30] , suggesting that virus-induced autophagosomes were not the sites for viral replication. At 48 hpi, electron microscopy showed that virus-containing single-or double-membrane vesicular compartments appeared in the cytoplasm of virus-infected VCMs, in which cytosolic components or organelles were sequestered (Fig 1G and 1H ). We observed that the number of double-or single-membrane vesicles increased more than 7-fold in the cytoplasm of virus-infected VCMs but rarely in virus-free VCMs ( Fig 1M) . Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that ATG8-specifc IgG can specifically label such compartments, namely, autophagosomes in virus-infected VCMs, but did not recognize specific compartments in virus-free VCMs ( Fig 1I) . Thus, RGDV particles, assembled at the periphery of the viroplasm [29, 30] , can be engulfed by virus-induced autophagosomes. Usually, these virus-containing autophagosomes were distributed within the cytoplasm (Fig 1J) , at the periphery of cell membrane (Fig 1K) or outside the cells (Fig 1L) . It seemed that virus-containing autophagosomes at the periphery of infected cells, can directly fuse with the plasma membrane to release viral particles ( Fig 1K) . Thus, virus-induced autophagy pathway may be involved in a nonlytic release of RGDV from insect vector cells.",

            "text": "Autophagic flux is a continuous and complete process of autophagy by which lysosomes fuse with autophagosomes [4] . Autophagic adapter SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) is an indicator to assess autophagic flux because SQSTM1 can target specific cargo for autophagy and is specifically degraded by the autophagic-lysosomal pathway [4] . RT-qPCR assay showed that the expression of Sqstm1 gene increased rapidly and significantly (P < 0.05) after inoculation with RGDV at a MOI of 0.4 (S1 Fig) . However, at 48 hpi, western blot assay showed that the accumulation of SQSTM1 was significantly decreased during viral infection of VCMs (Fig 2A) . We further revealed a clear correlation between the increase for the accumulation of ATG8-II and the decrease for the accumulation of SQSTM1 from 12 hpi to 96 hpi (S1 Fig). Thus, a clear autophagic flux occurred after viral infection of VCMs. Bafilomycin A1 (BAF) is a widely used inhibitor of the vacuolar type H + -ATPase (V-ATPase) that disturbs the fusion of autophagosomes with the lysosomes [39] . Next, the VCMs were treated with BAF, then inoculated with RGDV at a MOI of 0.4. At 48 hpi, we detected that the accumulation of SQSTM1 was significantly increased after BAF treatment during viral infection of VCMs (Fig 2A) . Thus, viral infection may further cause the degradation of SQSTM1 by the autophagic-lysosomal pathway. However, BAF treatment would inhibit such virus-induced degradation process. Furthermore, western blot assay showed that the accumulation of viral major outer capsid protein P8 was substantially decreased after BAF treatment in virus-infected VCMs (Fig 2A) . We thus determined that virus-induced autophagic flux was beneficial to viral infection, rather than serving as a defense mechanism for the degradation of viral particles. VCMs treated with (+) and without (-) 3-MA or BFA was detected by western blot assay using ATG8-specifc IgG. Insect ACTB was detected with ACTB-specific IgG as a control. (C-E) Autophagosomes in mock (D) and virus-infected (E) VCMs were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. At 48 hpi, VCMs were immunolabeled for autophagosomes with ATG8-FITC (green), for viral particles with P8-rhodamine (red), and for viroplasms with Pns9-Alexa Fluor 647 (blue), and then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. Viral antigens surrounding the spherical structures composed of Pns9, a component of viroplasms, are indicated by arrowheads. Arrows indicate the colocalization of ATG8-specific autophagosomes and viral particles. The average number of ATG8-specific puncta per R. dorsalis cell and a minimum of 100 cells were counted (C), and data points presented are the averages from six different fields (D, E). *P < 0.05. Bars, 15 \u03bcm. Immunofluorescence microscopy further showed that LysoTracker-stained lysosomes were clearly found in RGDV-infected VCMs at 48 hpi, while uninfected VCMs exhibited almost no positive signs (Fig 2B and 2C) . Furthermore, about 80% of LysoTracker-stained lysosomes were colocalized with viral major outer capsid protein P8 or ATG8-tagged autophagosomes ( Fig 2C) . Together, these results indicated that virus-containing autophagosomes were able to fuse with lysosomes, and insect vector cells underwent an autophagic process following RGDV infection.",

We also silenced the expression of Atg5 or Torc1 genes by RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit or induce autophagy, respectively [4, 9, 40] . VCMs were treated with drugs (3-MA or rapamycin) or dsRNAs targeting to Atg5, Torc1 or GFP genes (dsAtg5, dsTorc1 or dsGFP). At 8 h after treatment, the treated VCMs were inoculated with RGDV at a MOI of 0.1. At this low MOI, the early viral infection rate was low (about 15-30%), and the spread of viruses among VCMs could be easily monitored. By 48 hpi, immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that the treatment with dsTorc1 or rapamycin increased the percentage of infected cells from an average of 65% or 70% to 95% or 90% when compared with dsGFP-or PBS-treated cells, respectively ( Fig 3A) . In contrast, treatment with dsAtg5 or 3-MA decreased the percentage of infected cells from an average of 65% or 70% to 15% or 30% when compared with the dsGFPor PBS-treated cells, respectively ( Fig 3A) . As expected, ATG8-specific autophagosomes were clearly observed in virus-infected regions, but not in virus-free regions ( Fig 3A) . RT-qPCR assay showed that the treatment with dsTorc1 or rapamycin increased viral titers by about 2-17-fold ( Fig 3B) . By contrast, the treatment with dsAtg5 or 3-MA significantly reduced viral titers ( Fig 3B) . Thus, viral infection was positively correlated to autophagosome formation. We confirmed that the transcript levels of Atg8 gene were significantly reduced by treatment with 3-MA or dsAtg5, but was increased after treatment with rapamycin or dsTorc1 ( Fig 3C) . Accordingly, western blot revealed that the treatment with 3-MA or dsAtg5 reduced the accumulation of ATG8-II, but the treatment with rapamycin or dsTorc1 increased the accumulation of ATG8-II in virus-infected VCMs ( Fig 3D) . In addition, there was a clear correlation between the increase for ATG8-II accumulation and the decrease for SQSTM1 accumulation ( Fig 3D) . These observations indicated that the inducing of autophagy would facilitate viral infection, while the blocking of autophagy will inhibit viral infection. Thus, autophagy is beneficial to viral infection in insect vector cells.",

Thus, RGDV may exploit these autophagosomes to move from the intestinal epithelium to the gut lumen through the microvilli.

RT-qPCR assay showed that the mean viral genome copies in dsRNAs-treated viruliferous leafhoppers increased rapidly before 8-10 days padp, and then remained nearly stable ( Fig 5A) . Previously, we have shown that RGDV infection in insect vectors triggered a strong siRNA antiviral response, which can efficiently control viral accumulation below the pathogenic threshold to maintain the persistent infection [32] . Thus, our results were consistent with the persistent infection pattern of RGDV in insect vectors. It was clear that the mean viral genome copies in dsTorc1-treated viruliferous leafhoppers were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those in dsGFP-treated controls (Fig 5A) . By contrast, the mean viral genome copies in dsAtg5-or dsAtg8-treated viruliferous leafhoppers were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than those in dsGFP-treated controls (Fig 5A) . We confirmed that the transcript levels of Atg8 gene were significantly reduced by treatment with dsAtg8 or dsAtg5, but was increased after treatment with dsTorc1 in viruliferous leafhoppers ( Fig 5B) . Furthermore, western blot assay confirmed that dsAtg5 or dsAtg8 treatment reduced ATG8-II accumulation, but increased SQSTM1 accumulation in viruliferous leafhoppers ( Fig 5C) . However, dsTorc1 treatment increased ATG8-II accumulation, but reduced SQSTM1 accumulation in viruliferous leafhoppers (Fig 5C) . Taken together, our results suggested that the activation of autophagy by dsTorc1 treatment facilitated viral accumulation, whereas inhibiting of autophagy by dsAtg5 or dsAtg8 treatment blocked viral accumulation in insect vectors.",

Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that virus-containing vesicular compartments were positive for the autophagy marker ATG8 in RDV-infected VCMs (Fig 6A and 6B ). In contrast to the virus-free cells, it appeared that more than 15-fold ATG8-specific puncta in RDVinfected VCMs, and about 80% of ATG8-specific autophagosomes can colocalize with viral major outer capsid protein P8, but they never were overlapped with viroplasms of viral nonstructural protein Pns12 (Fig 6A-6C ). Previously, we had shown that progeny virions that assembled at the periphery of viroplasm can be sequestered into vesicular compartments, which would mediate nonlytic viral release from insect vector cells [34] [35] [36] . We observed that the number of double-or single-membrane vesicles increased more than 9-fold in the cytoplasm of virus- infected VCMs but rarely in virus-free VCMs (Fig 6D, 6E and 6G) . Furthermore, immunoelectron microscopy further indicated that ATG8-specific IgG can specifically recognize such viruscontaining vesicular compartments, namely, autophagosomes (Fig 6F) . Similar to RGDV, western blot assay also showed that RDV infection activated the appearance of ATG8-II, but reduced SQSTM1 accumulation (Fig 6H) . An autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, strongly inhibited the conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II and the degradation of SQSTM1 during viral infection (Fig 6H) .

Here, we demonstrated that infection by the plant reovirus RGDV significantly triggered an increase in virus-containing single-or doublemembrane autophagosomes, the colocalization of ATG8-II with viral particles, and the conversion of ATG8-I to ATG8-II in virus-infected R. dorsalis cells (Fig 1) , indicating that autophagy pathway was activated by RGDV infection in insect vector cells. We further showed that RGDV infection promoted the degradation of autophagic adapter SQSTM1 and caused the fusion of virus-containing autophagosomes with lysosomes (Figs 2 and S1 ). The treatment of lysosome inhibitor BAF suppressed such degradation of SQSTM1 during viral infection ( Fig  2) . Thus, the autophagic flux was triggered by RGDV infection. By inhibiting or activating autophagy with chemical reagents 3-MA and rapamycin or by RNAi induced by dsRNAs targeting Atg5 or Torc1 genes, we demonstrated a proviral role for virus-induced autophagy pathway in RGDV release from insect vector cells (Fig 3) . In our electron micrographs, progeny RGDV virions assembled at the periphery of viroplasms [29, 30] , were engulfed by virusinduced autophagosomes, which then evidently mediated nonlytic viral release by fusion with the plasma membrane in insect vector cells (Fig 1) . Thus, RGDV infection activated the autophagy pathway, which facilitated viral spread rather than controlling viral infection in insect vector cells.

            "text": "Generally, autophagy is an important antiviral cellular response for degradation of viral proteins or interference with viral replication [46] . On the other hand, as a result of continuous coevolution, many arboviruses have developed sophisticated mechanisms to subvert autophagy pathway and thus promote different stages of viral life cycle in their mammalian hosts [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . However, until the present study, the role of autophagy in natural interactions of arboviruses with their insect vectors has been less studied. In Drosophila, autophagy-induced by arboviruses was considered as an antiviral immunity response [24] . So far, only one study has considered a potential antiviral role for autophagy in plant virus-insect vector system. Wang et al. reported that a single-stranded DNA plant virus TYLCV can activate the whitefly autophagy pathway, which leads to subsequent degradation of the virus in vivo [25] . However, TYLCV-induced autophagosomes do not contain viral particles or capsids [25] . Here, we showed that the persistent infection of RGDV can trigger the accumulation of abundant viruscontaining autophagosomes in the intestine epithelium of leafhopper vector (Fig 4) . However, it is clear that RGDV can escape lysosomal degradation and exploit such autophagosomes to release from intestinal epithelium into the lumen by passing through actin-based microvilli (Fig 4) . Furthermore, such autophagosomes may move along actin-based visceral muscles surrounding the intestinal epithelium (Fig 4) . Thus, we demonstrated that virus-induced autophagy pathway played a critical role in viral spread in vector insects, enabling to accomplish a latent period for the virus, and subsequent ability to transmit the virus to plant hosts. Similarly, in cultured mammalian cells, a potential role for autophagy pathway in nonlytic release of human poliovirus or hepatitis A virus in vitro has been demonstrated [52] [53] [54] . However, little is known about the mechanisms of these human viruses spread via the internal mammalian host tissues such as the intestine, muscle tissue, and peripheral neurons during a natural infection. Our novel model for virus-induced autophagy pathway exploited by a virus to spread in insect intestine may be a common mechanism of spread for other viruses in vivo. We believe antigens of RDV.

            "text": "Plant reoviruses, once ingested by the insects, establish their primary infection in a limited number of intestinal epithelial cells, then the invading viruses can initiate the formation of nascent viroplasms for viral multiplication [1] [2] . Later, the progeny virions directly crossed the basal lamina into the visceral muscles, and spread into the salivary glands to be horizontally transmitted to healthy plants or into the female ovary to be vertically transmitted to offspring [1] [2] . Here, we demonstrated that autophagosomes induced by plant reoviruses assist viral particles pass through the membrane barriers, facilitating viral transmission. However, one key question remains unanswered to understand this model. Why do plant reoviruses such as RGDV and RDV induce the autophagy pathway for viral spread in insect vectors? Our recent study shows that a conserved siRNA antiviral immunity response is triggered by persistent replication of plant reoviruses in their insect vector [32, 55] . We thus deduced that the autophagosomes may be exploited by plant reoviruses to escape the direct defense from virusinduced siRNA antiviral immunity responses. Furthermore, the membrane structure of virusinduced autophagosome is a useful vehicle to carry virions to overcome any membrane or tissue barriers in insect vectors. Previously, we show that plant reoviruses can exploit the tubules constituted by viral nonstructural proteins to pass through the actin-based microvilli of the intestine epithelium either into the lumen or across the basal lamina into the circular visceral muscle of insect vectors [31, 33, 56, 57] . Based on these considerations, we deduce that, in an apparent trade-off between plant reoviruses and insects, the autophagy pathway and other modes of cellular remodeling are induced to facilitate viral accumulation, whereas the insect's innate immune responses, such as the siRNA antiviral pathway, are induced to maintain viral accumulation below the pathogenic threshold [32, 55] . Thus, the two mechanisms for the spread of plant reoviruses in insect vectors not only facilitate rapid viral dissemination but may also promote evasion of immune defenses, guaranteeing that the virus can be transmitted with high efficiency while maintaining a persistent infection that is not lethal.",

Then the VCMs were washed by the fresh culture medium for 3 times to remove the viruses that were not absorbed. Alternatively, to detect whether RDV infection induced autophagy pathway can facilitate viral release, VCMs were treated with 100 nM 3-MA or 20 \u03bcM rapamycin (dissolved in PBS) in the presence of Cellfectin for 8 h, and then inoculated with RDV at a MOI of 10 for 2h. Then the VCMs were washed by the fresh culture medium for 3 times to remove the viruses that were not absorbed. The supernatant of the infected cells was collected at 48 or 72 hpi and sedimented to remove cell debris [60] . Total RNAs were extracted from the supernatant using TRIzol reagent. The number of viral genome copies in the extracellular of VCMs in supernatant was calculated as described above.",
