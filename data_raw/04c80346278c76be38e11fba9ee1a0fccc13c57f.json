The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of oral candidiasis, other mucosal lesions, and xerostomia during interferon (IFN) therapy for HCV infection. Methods: Of 124 patients with HCV-infected liver diseases treated with IFN therapy in our hospital, 14 (mean age 56.00 \u00b1 12.94 years) who attended to receive administration of IFN once a week were identified and examined for Candida infection and other oral lesions and for the measurement of salivary flow. Serological assays also were carried out.",

C. albicans was the most common species isolated. The incidence of Candida during treatment with IFN did not increase above that before treatment. Additional oral mucosal lesions were observed in 50.0% (7/14) of patients: OLP in three (21.4%), angular cheilitis in three (21.4%) and recurrent aphthous stomatitis in one (7.1%). OLP occurred in one patient before treatment with IFN, in one during treatment and in one at the end of treatment. 85.7% of the oral lesions were treated with topical steroids. We compared the characteristics of the 7 patients in whom Candida was detected at least once during IFN therapy (group 1) and the 7 patients in whom Candida was not detected during IFN therapy (group 2). The prevalence of oral mucosal lesions (P=0.0075) and incidence of external use of steroids (P=0.0308) in group 1 were significantly higher than in group 2. The average body weight of group 1 decreased significantly compared to group 2 (P=0.0088). Salivary flow decreased in all subjects throughout the course of IFN treatment and returned at 6 th months after the end of treatment. In group 1, the level of albumin at the beginning of the 6 th month of IFN administration was lower than in group 2 (P=0.0550). According to multivariate analysis, one factor, the presence of oral mucosal lesions, was associated with the detection of Candida. The adjusted odds ratio for the factor was 36.00 (95% confidence interval 2.68-1485.94).",

A significant association between LP and chronic HCV infection has been reported in Japan, Italy, and Spain [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Previously, we reported that HCV was associated closely with extrahepatic manifestations such as oral LP (OLP) [12] and reported the examination of hepatitis C patients for oral lesions before, during and after IFN treatment [17, 18] ; OLP was seen in 11.7 (11/94)-16.7% (4/24) . OLP can occur, become exacerbated and persist during IFN treatment for hepatitis C, even when serum HCV RNA becomes negative. Our study suggested that OLP pathogenesis in hepatitis C may be attributed to host factors induced by HCV infection, rather than direct pathological effects of the virus [17] .",

REFRECARE-H W (EN Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Iwate, Japan) is an oral care gel containing hinokitiol, which can remove stains on the teeth and general oral debris, and is effective in the prevention of breath odor and gum diseases. Hinokitiol has significant antimicrobial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, coronavirus, Trichophyton, and Candida albicans [37] .
