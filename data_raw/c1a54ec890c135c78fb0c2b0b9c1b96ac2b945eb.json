Despite clinical evidence for anti-tumor activity, its efficacy as a stand-alone therapy remains to be improved. The success of future trials can be greatly influenced by the identification and the regulation of the cellular pathways that are important for reovirus replication and oncolysis. Here, we demonstrate that reovirus induces autophagy in several cell lines, evident from the formation of Atg5-Atg12 complexes, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation, p62 degradation, the appearance of acidic vesicular organelles, and LC3 puncta. Furthermore, in electron microscopic images of reovirus-infected cells, autophagosomes were observed without evident association with viral factories. Using UV-inactivated reovirus, we demonstrate that a productive reovirus infection facilitates the induction of autophagy. Importantly, knock-out cell lines for specific autophagy-related genes revealed that the expression of Atg3 and Atg5 but not Atg13 facilitates reovirus replication. These findings highlight a central and Atg13-independent role for the autophagy machinery in facilitating reovirus infection and contribute to a better understanding of reovirus-host interactions. ), and were previously described in literature [18] . All MEFs were cultured in DMEM plus pen-strep and 10% FBS. The Atg3wt, Atg3\u2212/\u2212, and Atg3+/+ MEFs were cultured at 32 \u2022 C, and all other MEFs at 37 \u2022 C.

It has the natural preference to replicate in and lyze tumor cells, while an antiviral response in normal cells hinders virus replication and cytolysis. The name \"reovirus\" is an acronym for Respiratory and Enteric Orphan virus, as it infects the respiratory and enteric tract and has not been associated with serious disease in humans. Reovirus is one of the first viruses for which a molecular mechanism has been suggested to explain its tumor cell preference [2] . This mechanism contributed to its clinical evaluation as viral oncolytic agent. To date a variety of clinical trials have been completed in several cancer types, but while the virus administration has been found safe, its efficacy in stand-alone treatments remains to be improved. A better understanding of what intracellular factors and pathways are important to reovirus replication and oncolysis would facilitate the improved design of clinical studies.",

            "text": "Various viruses have been shown to induce a host-cell adaptive response called macroautophagy, hereafter referred to as autophagy [3] . During autophagy, the cytoplasmic cellular contents are sequestered within double-membraned vesicles termed autophagosomes, which ultimately fuse to endosomes or lysosomes to form amphisomes or autolysosomes, respectively. This process facilitates the degradation of the cellular contents, even whole organelles, upon which the degradation products can be shuttled back into the cytosol for recycling. This highly conserved homeostatic process allows the cell to survive stressful conditions such as a nutrient-poor environment. Autophagy can also be exploited to combat viral infections. For instance, it can promote the intracytoplasmic degradation of viruses such as Sindbis virus and HIV-1 [4, 5] . Alternatively, it can activate an antiviral immune response through the delivery of viral genomic components to endosomal Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) or through the facilitation of viral antigen presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules [3, 6] . On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that viruses have evolved ways to either suppress or induce the autophagy machinery to facilitate their replication and/or survival [3] . For example, autophagy facilitates cancer cell death induction by human adenovirus type 5, presumably through the triggering of caspase activity [7] . Autophagy has also been shown to facilitate the infection of several dsRNA virus family members. Rotavirus induces microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation and inhibition of this process decreases virus replication [8] . Interestingly, Rotavirus does not induce the formation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, the non-structural avian reovirus protein p17 triggers autophagy, which enhances virus replication [9] . For Bluetongue virus, a similar correlation has been found, as inhibition of autophagy decreases viral protein production and virus titer, and the stimulation of autophagy conversely resulted in increased viral protein synthesis and virus yields [10] . It has been suggested that mammalian reovirus induces autophagy as well, though the precise function during reovirus infection remained unclear [11, 12] .",

To determine whether reovirus induces autophagy, the localization of LC3 was examined. To this end, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were stably transduced with the GFP-LC3 lentivirus and infected with R124 or jin-3 reovirus. R124 is our wildtype type 3 Dearing (T3D) strain, and jin-3 was obtained through serial passaging of the T3D reovirus on glioblastoma cells that lack the expression of the reovirus receptor junction adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) [19] . As a positive control, cells were treated with Rapamycin (Rapa) and Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). Rapa is an mTOR inhibitor and a known autophagy inducer [21] . BafA1 blocks the acidification of lysosomes or the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, and thereby arrests the autophagic flux through blocking the degradation of autophagosomes and their content. If autophagy is induced, the localization of the GFP-LC3 fusion protein shifts from a diffuse cytoplasmic appearance to a punctuate pattern. Immunofluorescent images revealed the induction of clear LC3 puncta upon reovirus infection and upon treatment with Rapa and BafA1 ( Figure 1 ). Notably, LC3 puncta appeared to be present in cells that showed reovirus protein expression as well, as shown by a co-staining for reovirus protein \u00b51C. These findings suggest that reovirus induces autophagy. ",

We infected the MEFs with R124 or jin-3 and examined the cell viability, reovirus \u03c33 protein expression, and virus titer in the cells. For the different knock-outs, minor effects were seen on reovirus-induced cytolysis [23] . However, \u03c33 protein expression and virus titers were markedly decreased in MEFs lacking Atg3 or Atg5 compared to the corresponding wildtype and rescued cells (Figures 3 and 4) . A knock-out for Atg13 affected neither the reovirus \u03c33 expression nor the titer ( Figure 5 ).

The absence of infectious virus in the UV-inactivated R124 batch was confirmed by plaque assay on 911 cells (\u226410 pfu/mL).

Bluetongue virus stimulates autophagy through the down-regulation of the autophagy-inhibiting Akt-TSC2-mTOR pathway and the up-regulation of the autophagy-stimulating AMPK-TSC2-mTOR pathway [25] . Autophagy was shown to enhance Bluetongue virus replication, as the pharmacological or siRNA-mediated inhibition of autophagy resulted in decreased virus replication, whereas inducing autophagy with Rapamycin (Rapa) led to an increase in viral yields [10] . Similarly, avian reovirus p17 non-structural protein has been shown to trigger autophagy through the activation of PTEN, AMPK, and PKR/eIF2\u03b1 signaling pathways [9] . As in the study on Bluetongue virus, treatment with Rapa increased avian reovirus progeny, whereas inhibiting the autophagy pathway decreased virus replication. Studies on rotavirus have revealed that its viroporin NSP4 activates autophagy by stimulating the release of calcium from the ER into the cytoplasm, which leads to a CaMKK-\u03b2-and AMPK-dependent initiation of autophagy [26] . This process relies on the activity of PI3K, Atg3, and Atg5. As for Bluetongue virus and avian reovirus, inhibition of autophagy reduced the amount of infectious virus. Interestingly, a recently accepted manuscript showed contradictory findings that rotavirus activity can be reduced by blocking the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway and thus stimulating autophagy [27] . Further research is warranted to gain more insight on this complex rotavirus-host interaction. For the interactions between mammalian reovirus and the autophagy machinery, not much is known. There are indications that mammalian reovirus induces autophagy in multiple myeloma cell lines, but the role of autophagy in mammalian reovirus infection remains unclear [11, 12] .",

LC3-II is localized to autophagosomes and therefore generally seen as a marker for autophagosome formation [21] . However, an increase in LC3-II can also be the consequence of a delay or a block in autolysosomal degradation. It is crucial to assess whether reovirus induces the full autophagic flux, including lysosomal degradation. For example, Influenza A virus blocks the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes with its matrix protein 2 [31] . The conventional method to study autophagic flux is through the use of BafA1. This compound blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion or lysosomal acidification, and therefore should lead to a block in the degradation of autophagic proteins thus an increase in LC3-II and p62 [21] . It should be mentioned that BafA1 treatment can inhibit the entry steps of reovirus infection [32, 33] . An effect of BafA1 on the reovirus-induced autophagy markers could thus potentially be attributed to an inhibition of viral entry. Therefore, we did not study the effect of adding BafA1 to reovirus-infected cells in our experiments. Nevertheless, it seems likely that reovirus induces the full autophagic flux, as we demonstrated that p62 is degraded upon reovirus infection.",

Recent publications revealed that genes considered to have a specific role in autophagy can exert additional functions as well [34] [35] [36] . This underlines the importance of testing knock-out cell lines for multiple autophagy-related genes before drawing firm conclusions about whether autophagy is involved in the studied process. Our results indicate that the autophagic process is not strictly involved in the replication of reovirus, but that some functions of autophagy-related proteins are important for a productive virus infection. We show that a subset of autophagy-related proteins seems to facilitate reovirus replication: specifically, Atg3 and Atg5, which both are essential for the lipidation of LC3. This raises the question as to whether the formation of LC3-II rather than the process of autophagy facilitates the replication of reovirus. As LC3 lipidation does not strictly rely on the expression of Atg13, this would explain the contrasting result for that knock-out. Correspondingly, we noted that the cellular presence of LC3 puncta correlates with the presence of virus protein in the same cell, suggesting that they co-evolve. It remains to be determined whether the LC3 puncta consist of LC3-II or LC3-I. For Coronavirus, it has been demonstrated that virus infection in cell culture induces the formation of double-membraned vesicles coated with LC3-I [37] . However, we found that the levels of LC3-I decrease during reovirus infection, and the levels of LC3-II conversely increase. Therefore, it seems unlikely that LC3-I rather than LC3-II is detected as puncta.",

This conjugate has previously been demonstrated to be involved in basal autophagic flux, mitophagy, and late endosome function [39] [40] [41] . It is widely known that reovirus entry relies on the maturation of endosomes, raising the possibility that in the absence of Atg3, entry of the virus is hindered [42, 43] . Future studies are needed to investigate this possibility. Research on non-canonical roles of Atg5 has demonstrated that the Atg5-Atg12 conjugate can alternatively function to inhibit type I IFN production by directly interacting with RIG-I and IPS-1 [44] . Type I IFN is considered a general anti-viral response and is known to inhibit a productive reovirus infection [45] . Therefore, an Atg5-mediated decrease in type I IFN could explain the observed importance for reovirus replication.",

It has been shown that the apoptosis induction capacity of reovirus relies on \u03c31 attachment to cell surface molecules [46] . Contrastingly, for necroptosis induction by reovirus, both genomic RNA within incoming virus particles needs to be sensed as well as dsRNA must be formed [47] . Interestingly, for other members of the Reoviridae virus family, non-structural proteins were found to be associated with autophagy induction [27] . Our data indicate that this is not the case for reovirus. Though our results indicate that a productive reovirus infection facilitates the induction of autophagy, the replication process itself seems dispensable as we find that exposure of cells to a much higher MOI* (200 or 1000) of UV-inactivated virus is able to induce autophagic features. In this respect, it could be speculated that a specific reovirus capsid protein, or a set of proteins, is involved in the induction of autophagy.",
