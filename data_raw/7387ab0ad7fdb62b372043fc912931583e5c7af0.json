The levels of transcription of the V-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (ABL) and zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ)-previously referred as best-performing housekeeping genes in feline blood due to their stable transcription [31] -were employed for normalization. Briefly, to assess the transcription levels of cytokines and reference genes in the samples from this study, a standard curve was acquired using a serial 10-fold dilution of synthetic standards. Afterwards, the transcription levels of the cytokines were normalized to the geometric means of the housekeeping genes, as described elsewhere [32] .",

The balance between the antiinflammatory IL-10 and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, seems to be a key factor for an adequate inflammation in fungal infection, since IL-10 might be required for limiting high levels of inflammation and the consequent host damage [43] . In experimental murine sporotrichosis, IL-10 is involved with impairment of fungicidal activity of macrophage, as well as with unresponsiveness of T-cells [44] . In humans, high levels of IL-10 production in response to some viral infections plays a role in viral persistence, by suppressing immune functions [45] [46] [47] . The high levels of IL-10 in FIV-positive cats in this study may be related to a high percentage of regulatory T (Treg) cells, since these cells can be directly activated by FIV and are normally increased in infected animals [48] .

Although the role of Th17 arm is still unknown in feline sporotrichosis, the levels of IL-6, a cytokine which induces the development of Th17 cells, did not differ among the cats from this study. This suggests that the retrovirus co-infection and the upregulation of IL-10, with a potential polarization to a Treg cell profile, did not impair Th17 immunity. This is relevant because despite having opposite functions, Th17 and Treg cells develop from CD4+ cell precursors through the same pathway, but depending upon the presence of different cytokines [50] . Despite the very low levels of IL-6 detected in the cats from this study, it is not possible to suggest that Th17 profile is depressed in favor of Tregs increase in retrovirus co-infection, due to the small number of FIV-positive cats. Another limitation of this study was the absence of a control group of healthy cats, so that it cannot be confirmed whether IL-6 levels are altered in cats with sporotrichosis, co-infected with retrovirus infections or not, in comparison to healthy cats.",

Interestingly, FIV co-infected cats from this study presented higher levels of IL-10 (P MWU = 0.05). In addition, it has been shown that PD-1, the programmed cell death protein 1, is upregulated in FIV-infected lymphocytes and may correlate with dysfunction or exhaustion of T cells and with immunosuppression in infected cats [55] . It could be speculated that the cytokine changes in cats with sporotrichosis coinfected with FIV may be at some level linked to the large number of yeast commonly found in cutaneous lesions of feline sporotrichosis.

In humans, the decrease in CD4+ cell counts also correlated with disseminated sporotrichosis [57] . The poor general condition and the disseminated lesions with high fungal burden in cats with sporotrichosis were related to higher CD8 low + cells percentage, which is suggested to be elicited by a Th2 immunity background [58] . In coronavirus infection, cats that did not develop Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), a fatal granulomatous disease, had higher tissue levels of IL-10, which probably prevented excessive macrophage activation and the development of FIP [59] . Although further studies are still necessary to determine the mechanisms driving ineffective granulomas in feline sporotrichosis, it could be considered that, as described in coronavirus-infected cats, the retrovirus coinfection with upregulation of IL-10 is possibly involved with the impairment of granuloma formation and increasing fungal load in lesions of feline sporotrichosis.",

An experimental study in rats with sporotrichosis showed that different profiles of cytokines are driven depending on the coinfection with Taenia taeniaeformis [65] . The authors demonstrated that IL-10 was increased in rats co-infected with the worm. These animals showed a less organized inflammatory infiltrate, and a higher fungal burden. As previously speculated for FIV, the Sporothrix/helminths co-infection could lead to the imbalance of cytokines, resulting in impaired response to Sporothrix and in the lack of control over the fungal infection in cats.",

Still, the combination of ITZ and KI in the treatment of cats decreased the median treatment length in cats in this study. Even though this reduction was not statistically significant, it is important to state that the combination of these drugs had previously shown promising results in the treatment of feline sporotrichosis [11] . While the effectiveness of KI is not proved to be due to the direct action on fungi [66] , the mechanism through which its use is successful remains obscure. Although this issue still needs to be addressed, a potential immunomodulation is suggested [67] [68] [69] and could have contributed to the shorter treatment length in cats treated with KI in this study, especially on FeLV co-infection. However, this study had a retrospective design, with retrospective evaluation of medical records. Prospective double blinded controlled studies should be performed to properly assess effectiveness of the different therapeutic regimes.",

Retrovirus/Sporothrix co-infection in cats from this study led to important changes in immunological balance, leaning towards an immunosuppressive profile with higher levels of IL-10, which could prevent the activation of a Th1 response that would be favourable against sporotrichosis. The consequent imbalance in host-pathogen interactions may potentially result in higher availability of Sporothrix in skin lesions and increased transmission from cats to humans. Indeed, all cats that had the most severe clinical presentation and poor general condition were co-infected with FeLV or FIV. Therefore, these results encourage the development of prospective longitudinal studies that address the impact of immunological changes in the outcome of cats with sporotrichosis. This would be the key to better understand prognostic determinants of feline sporotrichosis and to developing new therapy strategies to control disease spread. ",
