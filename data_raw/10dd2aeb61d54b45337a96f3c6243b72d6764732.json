HIV-1 risk behaviors (using computer assisted self-interviews), blood viral load (Amplicor, Roche) and CD4 count (flow cytometry) were obtained at baseline and every 12 weeks throughout follow-up. All participants were assessed for baseline HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance via bulk sequencing of the partial HIV-1 pol coding region (GeneSeq HIV-1; Monogram Biosciences, Inc., South San Francisco, CA or Viroseq v.2.0; Celera Diagnostics, Alameda, CA). The sequenced region included the protease gene and between 305 and 335 59 aminoacids of the reverse transcriptase gene. Repeated HIV-1 pol sequences were generated in a subset of participants. The GenBank accession numbers for the 648 baseline pol sequences included in this analysis are KJ722809-KJ723456.

After quality control procedures to remove potential contaminant sequences [15] , the partial transmission network was inferred based on the nucleotide genetic distances between bulk HIV-1 pol sequences from each participant ( Figure 1 ) [16, 17] . In accordance with previous analyses [11, 18, 19] , we linked two individuals (nodes) in the networks whenever their pol sequences were less than 1.5% distant (TN93 distance measure, see Figure S1 in File). The degree (connectivity) [20] of each individual was defined as the number of links (edges in the transmission network) to other individuals. Clusters were defined as connected components of the network comprising two or more nodes (Figure 1 ). Epidemiologic contact information was not a requirement for clustering in the molecular network, since the presence of a link does not imply direct transmission (but rather two recently related viruses). Whenever possible, we assigned a direction to the network edge (i.e., an arrow to indicate the likely transmission direction), if the EDI of the secondary partner (i.e., putative ''recipient'') node was at least 30 days past the date at which the initial partner (i.e., putative ''source'') sequence was isolated ( Figure S2 in File S1). We conservatively assumed that chronically infected subjects had an EDI of at least 180 days from enrollment (based on the reliability of available detuned HIV assays to estimate the duration of recent infection [21] [22] [23] ). Since multiple bulk HIV-1 pol sequences generated from participants with longitudinal follow-up were available and could boost our power to detect transmissions originating from chronically infected individuals, we used all available sequences to define links.",

Using only baseline data, we characterized the risk of HIV-1 transmission within the first year after study entry, for participants entering the study between 2005-2010. At least one year of network followup was available for all participants (i.e., network sampling ended in 2011), beginning in 2005 when network sampling was sufficiently dense for these analyses ( Figure S3 in File S1). We defined TNS as the function of the total degree (d) of the node at baseline (d = 0 if no connections are inferred), conditioned on the network inferred at the time of each subject's baseline sequence (N). Specifically, TNS(d|N) = Prob (degree of a node in N,d), with the probability computed using the best-fitting parametric density for the network N. In other words, TNS of a node with degree d is the proportion of all network nodes with degrees less than d, estimated from the histogram smoothed by the fitted parametric distribution ( Figure S3 in File S1). TNS could range between 0 and 1, with higher values representing nodes with unusually high connectivity [see Supplemental Methods]).",

The association between high TNS and patient characteristics, transmission risks, and clinical and epidemiological factors was tested using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for continuous characteristics, and Fisher's exact test for binary and categorical characteristics. Behavioral characteristics were examined independently. To ensure a linear relationship between each independent variable and the logit of the outcome, we log-transformed the viral load and the number of sex partners in the past year. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare participants with a new out-edge network connection (i.e. a putative transmission) to those without a new connection for continuous and categorical variables. A multiple logistic regression model was developed by considering variables that were statistically important (p,0.10) at the univariate level and then removing them using backward elimination (though the same results were obtained using forward and stepwise elimination). Benefits from adding covariates to the model were assessed with the likelihood ratio test. Only clustered individuals (nodes) within the network are shown (52.3%). Despite the likely presence of unsampled (i.e., missing) nodes, a partial HIV-1 transmission network is color coded; the intensity of coloring of nodes determined by their TNS score, while that for directed edges corresponds to the viral load of the putative initial partner at the timepoint closest to the transmission event. Absence of blue shading indicates that no VL was available for the sampled individual at any timepoint or that the direction of the edge could not be ascertained using EDI (see text). Absence of red shading indicates a TNS = 0 (i.e. nodes that were unconnected at the time of enrollment). Nodes are connected with an edge (i.e., a line to indicate potential transmission) if the minimum distance between the respective pol sequences (i.e., possible transmission pairs) is less than 1.5%. A direction is assigned to an edge if the EDI for the secondary partner (i.e., putative ''recipient'') is at least 30 days after the sampling date of the putative transmitting partner (i.e., putative ''source'').

Overall, the mean genetic distance between pairs of randomly selected baseline sequences was 5.83% (s.d. 1.46%), and pairwise distances below the threshold of 1.5% used to define a link between individuals, were rare overall (0.25%, Figure S1 in File S1). Using this 1.5% threshold, 339 individuals (52.3%, 95% CI: 333-392) were connected to at least one other study participant. Individuals were then divided into connected (i.e., clustered) and disconnected (i.e., singletons) nodes. Connected nodes ( Figure 1 ) were arranged in 90 clusters (95% CI: 68-90), ranging in size from 2 to 62 individuals. It was possible to discern the direction of the putative HIV-1 transmission in 332 of the 540 connections (61.5%) by comparing the sampling date of the secondary partner and the EDI for the putative initial (i.e., transmitting) partner ( Figure S2 in File S1). Overall, 18.5% (n = 29) of clustered participants had a new outbound connection within one year of enrollment. A total of 208 connections (38.5%) remained undirected because neither individual had an EDI (n = 29) or neither direction could be ruled out by examining EDI and sampling date information (n = 179). Interestingly, participants enrolled during acute and early infection were not significantly more likely to develop a new outbound edge within the first year of follow up than persons with established (i.e., chronic) infection (75.5% vs. 67.2%, p = 0.52). However, similar to previously described HIV-1 networks derived mostly from populations of men who have sex with men [6, 25] , our network was best described by a preferential attachment model, indicating that new connections (i.e., putative transmissions) are more likely Figure 2 . Simulations of ART provided either to those with the highest TNS or to a random subset of clustered individuals. Black nodes are those that are being treated (the assumption is that ART is 100% effective at stopping all secondary transmissions). Other nodes are colored according to how likely they are to be prevented from becoming infected assuming that we have removed the treated nodes from the infectious pool; they are also labeled by the rate at which they are expected to be effectively protected (dark red = very high probability of preventing transmission). These values are derived from simulating treatment where the randomness comes from the fact that should a node have N possible infectious connections, K of which are treated/removed due to treatment of other nodes, the node itself will NOT become infected with probability K/ N. Targeting high TNS in panel A shows (i) The removal of an entire large cluster, where many nodes have high TNS (ii) prevented chains of transmission (i.e. even nodes that are not directly connected to the treatment subset have a high probability from being protected). Targeting the same number of random nodes in panel B shows: largely a very local effect and almost no chains being disrupted (with the exception of a cluster that is randomly chosen). Both panel A and panel B networks have the same topology, though the appearance is slightly different to allow labeling of specific nodes. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0098443.g002 to form (or ''attach'') to nodes that are already more highly connected ( Figure S6 in File S1) [6] .",

Retrospective analysis using a network statistic developed by Wertheim et al.

We also evaluated if the network could possibly inform targeting of prevention interventions, and found through simulation that ART given to the 11 individuals with the highest TNS ($0.90) and assumed to be 100% effective at preventing transmission, showed a greater probability of reducing HIV-1 transmissions compared to ART provided to the same number of randomly selected individuals in the network ( Figure 2 and Table 3 ). This observation remained in 91% of simulated treatment scenarios to those with TNS $0.90. We also investigated whether selecting a subset for immediate treatment based on baseline demographics and reported risk behaviors would yield prevention improvements comparable to those achieved by TNS. Such simulations suggested that targeting ART for individuals based on the number of sex partners in the last month, whether or not they reported always having UAI in the last month or whether or not they had another sexually transmitted infection (STI), did not provide a measurable improvement over a randomly selected subset of nodes (probability of improving on a random treatment .0.5 in all cases).",

This objective score identified a subset of participants (TNS .0.75) who had a significantly greater predicted risk of HIV transmission within their first year of infection than those with lower TNS. As evidence that TNS reflected a biologic correlate of transmission risk, a positive and correlation was observed between baseline VL (and TNS) and likelihood of acquiring an outbound edge within the first year [29] [30] [31] . When TNS was incorporated into a multivariate model with VL, the prediction of transmission risk significantly improved, suggesting that VL and TNS are informed by independent transmission risk factors (e.g., per contact transmission risk and number of high risk contacts). Taken together, TNS provides a new method to estimating transmission risk within a network, and this method could likely be extended to infer regional transmission networks from the extensive archives of HIV sequence data stored in commercial databases. Since the TNS is derived only from information available at the time of enrollment, the score could be readily utilized in clinical practice (Figure 3) , as patient level TNS results could be integrated into routine baseline genotype test reports providing a general transmission risk interpretation to the patient's healthcare provider and the patient.",

First, we retrospectively observed that selfselected early initiation of ART was associated with a cumulative decrease in putative transmission in our network, as compared to delaying ART. We then used data from our local network to inform simulations, that demonstrated that targeting individuals with highest TNS ($0.90) with highly effective prevention interventions (e.g., fully suppressive ART), we would expect to reduce local network transmissions more efficiently than with the same prevention intervention targeting individuals with the greatest number of recent sexual partners or STI (Table 3) . While encouraging, one still must prove that such interventions can disrupt the entire network if they are to appreciably reduce the incidence rate in the at risk community. Based on these robust HIV-1 network transmission observations, we therefore propose a method to use the connectivity of individuals to guide targeted prevention interventions, like early ART.",

The inferred transmission network is incomplete and inaccurate, and the presence of a directed link between two individuals does not guarantee an HIV transmission event occurred; it simply reflects recent relatedness of the virus, possibly through a series of unobserved intermediaries. While the inferred network only proposes ''putative'' transmissions, a limitation of the convenience-based sampling methods used for these analyses is that they are inadequate to discern with certainty true transmission chains from clusters of epidemiologically unlinked persons infected by a common or intermediate source. In addition, individuals who were infected by partners outside the well-sampled area (e.g. infected in a different city) will likely be assigned a low TNS score even if they pose a high risk of onward transmission. Similarly, nodes characterized by high TNS values may also represent lower risk individuals who are genetically linked to unobserved (i.e., unsampled) high risk intermediaries. Our recent work [32] on large-scale network reconstruction, where hundreds of thousand sequences can be included in the analysis of local transmission networks suggests a possible solution to by conditioning the local network in the context of a global network. In addition, by conditioning on the network structure, using robust statistics, and using community level measures these unobserved connections can be mitigated [24] . Further, more sophisticated methods [19] are being developed to help better associate molecular and epidemiological links. Also, these results may not be generalizable to other networks. The efficiency of HIV-1 transmission per contact (influenced by sexual behavior, VL, STI, etc. [33] ) may vary by geographic region, thus optimal prevention interventions strategies may depend upon a thorough understanding of local transmission dynamics. Finally, there remains concerns about the potential loss of privacy related to disclosure of putative transmission between two or more individuals [34] , even though there are significant limitations in proving direct HIV transmission links [35, 36] . Nevertheless, with appropriate privacy protection protocols, it is reasonable to consider using HIV transmission network data to develop prevention intervention strategies ( Figure 3) .",
