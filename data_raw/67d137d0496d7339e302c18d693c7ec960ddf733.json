There is limited research on how public health policies have been implemented or what has influenced their implementation. This paper explores policy implementation in two exemplar public health programs -chronic disease prevention and sexually-transmitted infection prevention -in Ontario, Canada. It examines public health service providers' , managers' and senior managements' perspectives on the process of implementation of the Ontario Public Health Standards 2008 and factors influencing implementation. Methods: Public health staff from six health units representing rural, remote, large and small urban settings were included. We conducted 21 focus groups and 18 interviews between 2010 (manager and staff focus groups) and 2011 (senior management interviews) involving 133 participants. Research assistants coded transcripts and researchers reviewed these; the research team discussed and resolved discrepancies. To facilitate a breadth of perspectives, several team members helped interpret the findings. An integrated knowledge translation approach was used, reflected by the inclusion of academics as well as decision-makers on the team and as co-authors. Results: Front line service providers often were unaware of the new policies but managers and senior management incorporated them in operational and program planning. Some participants were involved in policy development or provided feedback prior to their launch. Implementation was influenced by many factors that aligned with Greenhalgh and colleagues' empirically-based Diffusion of Innovations in Service Organizations Framework. Factors and related components that were most clearly linked to the OPHS policy implementation were: attributes of the innovation itself; adoption by individuals; diffusion and dissemination; the outer contextinterorganizational networks and collaboration; the inner settingimplementation processes and routinization; and, linkage at the design and implementation stage.",

Two exemplar programschronic disease prevention (CDP) and sexually-transmitted infection prevention (STIP)are being used to explore these topics. These programs were chosen based on having a similar focus in both provinces allowing for provincial comparisons, the likelihood of primary care and public health collaboration on the topic (a secondary research interest) and expressed interest by our knowledge user partners. This paper reports on results from the first two years of data collection (baseline) in 2010-11 in ON. Baseline results from BC are reported in a parallel paper [6] .",

Additional file 1 provides a detailed history of the process of initiation, development, and roll out of the policies up to 2010 when this program of research was initiated. In short, following the 2003 SARS outbreak [7, 8] a provincial report -Revitalizing Ontario's Public Health Capacity [9] recommended that the Mandatory Health Programs and Services (MHPSG) [10] policy document be replaced with renewed provincial public health program standards that were to be continually revised, in other words, part of an ever-greening process. The Standards were expected to fit within public health's fiscal envelope or public health funding. In addition, there was to be increased emphasis on accountability, coordination and collaboration across the health system, as well as financial sustainability. Government and a Technical Review Committee deliberated on a number of cross-cutting themes to be included in the new Standards [11] . These included: balancing the need for provincial standardization and being responsive to local contexts; integrating public health functions as part of the overall framework emphasizing population health assessment and surveillance, as well as the delineation of a Foundational Standard; establishing a logic model approach to define causal linkages between requirements, board of health and societal outcomes; and, ensuring that public health roles and contributions to addressing determinants of health and reducing health inequities was prominent within a robust introduction to the standards.",

As a result, attention to how contextual and organizational factors enabled implementation became important [20, 21] . Greenhalgh and colleagues wrote a seminal article and book that reported on a systematic review to address how innovations can be spread and sustained in health services organizations [22, 23] . They used a meta-narrative technique to synthesize findings from empirical and theoretical works in 13 different research traditions, such as evidenced-based medicine and complexity studies. Based on their analysis, the authors put forth a \"unifying conceptual model\" of diffusion in service organizations composed of eight elements: 1) the innovation, 2) adoption by individuals, 3) assimilation by the system, 4) diffusion and dissemination, 5) system antecedents for innovation, 6) system readiness for innovation, 7) the outer context: interorganizational networks and collaboration, 8) implementation and routinization, and 9) linkage (at the design and implementation stage). We used this empirically-based framework [22, 23] , to interpret our data related to the policy implementation. In our analysis we took the authors' advice also to pay attention to implementation adaptations that arose and occurred informally in addition to those that were spread through official, planned mechanisms.",

We drew upon results from focus groups and interviews to obtain perspectives from health unit personnel and senior management in relation to the core program standards. Cases were defined as the STIP and CDP programs that are directed by policy. These programs were chosen because they were offered in both provinces and were likely to involve collaboration with primary care -a cross cutting theme. Six out of 36 health units in the province of Ontario were recruited to provide a diverse sample that matched the general demographic makeup (e.g., population density; ratio of immigrants; urban, rural, remote or mixed) of the health authorities in BC. One health unit dropped out due to reduced capacity to participate in research as a result of multiple staff changes and vacancies; the health unit was replaced by another in 2011. Service providers, managers and senior management (i.e., directors, a Chief Nursing Officer, Medical Officers of Health, and Associate Medical Officers of Health) were recruited to participate (Table 1) . Service providers and managers participated in focus groups separately to avoid the influence of power-over relationships. Focus groups were [1] framework is supported by four pillars which are the principles that underpin the Standards. The foundational Standard and protocol is to be integrated into the 5 program Standards with their relevant accompanying protocols.

To begin, a coding framework was created by having each researcher from the team code two or three selected transcripts followed by a review and discussion in a face-to-face meeting. Agreement was reached on the coding framework and remaining transcripts were coded by trained staff. After a few more transcripts were coded, results were reorganized by identifying codes that could be merged or reorganized into higher level thematic codes by researchers. When all coding was completed, each researcher was assigned a set of transcripts to review as a peer debriefing strategy: in other words, each transcript was reviewed by two researchers to increase the credibility of analysis [24, 25] .",

Sensitizing concepts are central to a grounded theory approach to analysis [26] , but the notion was developed much earlier by Blumer [27] . A sensitizing concept is one that is not clearly specified with respect to its attributes. Thus, it does not allow the researcher to move easily between data identifying the instance and the attributes of the concept. Rather, a sensitizing concept provides the researcher with general suggestions about what to look for in an empirical instance. Definitive concepts, on the other hand, provide very specific directions for what to see [27] p. 7.",

It showed that multiple levels of influence exist that impact the implementation of the public health policies. In addition, complex relationships exist among factors across and between levels. This is illustrated in Fig. 3 by dotted lines between levels. The factors aligned very closely with many of the components in Greenhalgh and colleagues' Model of Diffusion in Service Organizations [23] , which is used to guide the discussion. It is important to note that the Greenhalgh et al model was created as a composite framework based on a meta-narrative systematic review of the diffusion of innovations literature. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that each element in the model is not relevant in every situation nor is it reasonable to expect that it would show up in every instance. Our data did not demonstrate relevance of some aspects of the model (e.g., aspects of the innovation itself such as trialability, capacity to evaluate the innovation), indicating that some influences were more important than others in this situation. Participants identified those that were most relevant and salient to them basing their interpretations of their own experiences. These interpretations might be different from others in similar or different situations. However, in our constant comparative analysis, each concept 'earned' its way into the results by appearing repeatedly in the data. At the same time, the factors influencing diffusion of innovation (which includes an implementation stage) in Greenhalgh's framework were empirically grounded in a large body of literature.",

            "text": "Attributes of the innovation itselfthat is, the OPHS policy -is a component in the model that influences uptake. End users of the innovation need to perceive relative advantage of the innovation for successful implementation [23, 30] . Many staff members identified that the policy was useful to justify programs, especially politically sensitive ones such as harm reduction. The fact that the OPHS are legislatively mandated is an attribute that could be used to leverage local implementation and could be helpful in securing resources that might otherwise be diverted to other municipal programs. Opportunity for reinvention of the innovation is another aspect of an innovation's attributes that can support uptake [23] . Participants had mixed opinions in relation to the prescriptiveness of the new policy. Most participants felt that the policy was less prescriptive compared to the OPHS predecessor (the MHPSG), particularly in relation to the CDP program. The ability to tailor programs to meet local community needs was seen as a great advantage in the new policy -an opportunity for reinvention. On the other hand, staff involved in STIP programs did not see much change of the new policy with respect to prescriptiveness, since they have always had strict guidelines to follow for STI management including contact tracing. Similarly, the Bax, de Jong and Kooppenjan study of implementation of road policy in the Netherlands [31] noted that a policy implementation gap was the absence of precise policy objectives which allowed for discretionary power to deviate from the intended policy directions. They also argued that an implementation strategy needs to match the policy and implementation context. Another important lesson was that \"local knowledge is indispensable to adapt a uniform package of measures to specific conditions\" (p.880). In other words, implementation requires a certain amount of discretionary freedom to permit local tailoring. On the other hand, Bax and colleagues also reported that a lack of precision in their policy had risks characterised as: \"'not knowing how to' (lack of proper information and communication), 'not being able to' (lack of competence and capacity), and 'not wanting to' (resistance)\" ( [31] p.873). This finding mirrors results of our parallel public health policy implementation paper which reported a key theme as, \"you've told me what, now tell me how\" [6] . A balance is needed that allows for tailoring of policies to local contexts along with the provision of resources and supports to facilitate implementation.",

It is likely that staff involvement in policy development as well as active discussions around it during implementation, enhanced the meaning attached to the policy. It also increased its perceived advantage. A longitudinal case study involving two Swedish national evidence-based policies aimed at improving health and social care indicated that active involvement and dialogue of professional organizations (stakeholders) during policy development allowed for a quick implementation start up, and improved the chances for a positive response from the target group [34] . Normalization process theory also highlights the importance of individuals' understanding the meaning of the innovation, known as coherence [32, 33] . The authors argue that this can influence implementation and uptake of practice innovations and was demonstrated in our analysis through participants' critical reflection on the policy's implications for practice and communities.",

Despite this lack of clarity, many were aware that accountability agreements were soon to be released that would clarify expectations related to meeting the standards. This points to a relationship between factors in the outer setting (i.e., accountability and consequences) and adoption by individuals. Similarly, in a Swedish case study of a national public health policy implemented in two municipalities, Jansson, Fosse and Tillgren [36] reported that that the policy lacked relevance to their context, was not targeted to local needs, and lacked specific requirements.

Many providers felt that policy implementation was a management responsibility, while they were charged with service delivery. This meant that the policy held little meaning in their workload for many front line staff, which influenced their degree of interest in learning about it. It is not surprising then that most managers and service providers who were either engaged with Ministry staff in developing the policy or provided feedback during its development felt particularly engaged and positive about their experiences.

In this study, horizontal networks of peers were found to be supportive for program implementation, in particular for tobacco programs, as a positive \"intentional spread strategy\" [23] p. 609. Similarly, Greenhalgh et al. [23] noted that informal interorganizational networks such as homophilous networks or networked provider agencies that share a common management and governance structure can influence implementation. Related to the value of networks, a notable area that was identified in our results was the influence of external community partnerships with other sectors, such as primary care and schools.

Since a single organization cannot solve complex problems alone, working in collaboration is essential for success. They report on a case study of public mental health policy implementation in England involving local implementation teams to deliver the policy. They reported several challenges in working in collaborations including: a lack of common understanding of key definitions (i.e., mental health), funding projects with existing resources, low priority placed by partners on public mental health initiatives, and the presence of a dominant partner that controlled resources and held power which led to competition between stakeholders.",

Although the policy push from the Ministry was felt by those in management, it had less impact on health service providers.

In this study, the role of leaders in policy implementation was critical not only in providing direction for staff, but also in supporting their implementation efforts.

Medical Officers of Health were seen as having great influence on program and services directions. Not surprisingly, a lack of leadership (a vacancy in senior leadership) or local municipal pressures were seen as a barrier to implementation. This tension was seen in some health units more than others. Participants expected more 'top down' direction and support from their leaders in these health units.",

In addition, there was an uneven level of engagement with the policies at the organizational level. Some leaders took an approach that satisfied their obligations for management accountability, e.g., they held staff meetings to discuss the Standards or they retrospectively ensured that their operational plans addressed them. Others, perhaps on account of their personal leadership style, worked in a pro-active manner by incorporating the Standards into organizational strategic plans or by creating a culture where staff felt supported in their implementation of the policies. Langley and Denis [21] suggest that traditional approaches to implementation, as we've presented here using the Greenhalgh et al., model [22] , and perhaps as the Ministry envisioned, can be enhanced with attention to context-specific factors. The authors suggest three focal points: 1) attention to the uneven benefits that might be realized by different stakeholders (\"what's in it for whom\"), 2) attention to values held by different groups, 3) understanding what is essential (in the policy) and what is in the soft periphery that can be adjusted to the context. A change management strategy could be included in a transition/implementation plan in the next set of standards [42] using a lens that positions health units as political systems rather than rational systems [21] .",

Some policies are easier to implement than others as they might differ with respect to the degree of change required, resource requirements, complexity of the policy setting, etc. Sometimes the policy itself might have somewhat conflicting objectives, as was the case in our study, making it difficult to implement as intended. Repeatedly we heard that the policy was intended to be responsive to local community needs. Further, the policy explicitly supported collaboration with community agencies (one of the key principles) to promote health and prevent illness, and respondents noted that their community partners sometimes had particular requests from them. These collaborative directions are in line with traditional public health activity. However, the policy also took a stronger evidence-based approach than the previous MHPSG; in other words, health units were asked to carry out reviews of the literature to understand problems and develop programs with demonstrated effectiveness. This direction is in line with the general trend in the larger health sector and in public health to provide health services that are grounded in evidence [31, 34, 43, 44] . Thus both of these objectiveslocal responsiveness and research-based programmingare reasonable in their own right. Taken together, however, many respondents did indeed speak to a practice tension that arose when trying to implement the overall policy related to conflicting values of different forms of evidence. For example, a local demand or problem was not resolved because there was a lack of research literature (a form of evidence) to support an effective solution, or the literature suggested an alternative solution from what partner agencies demanded (community need, which is another form of evidence). Participants clearly felt uncomfortable when local needs could not be met because of a lack of research evidence. In addition, discomfort was felt when local needs were being met, but initiatives fell outside of the scope of the OPHS. An implication for future policy implementation is to ensure greater policy cohesiveness or mechanisms about how to manage these practice conflicts related to the policy.",

We involved six health units that we identified based on their different contexts; however, they may not be representative of all health units in Ontario. In addition, we were not able to engage all health unit staff members equally. For example epidemiologists and planners were underrepresented and these staff would likely have been quite engaged in policy implementation decisions. We did, however, obtain valuable input from public health staff at all levels of authority from service providers to senior leaders. Further, we did not seek input from members of Boards of Health who could have provided unique perspectives on implementation and the policies themselves. We selected CDP and STIP programs as exemplar programs in order to keep the study manageable, to provide a useful comparator and to enhance our ability to track changes over a five year period within a similar cohort. This decision did result in limited knowledge of the influence of the OPHS in other program areas. Despite these limitations, we have obtained rich input from a wide variety of stakeholders in public health including services providers who typically are not asked for their impressions on policy, and are ultimately the ones who provide the programs and services to meet the OPHS. Another strength of this research is that it reflects an integrated knowledge translation approach, where practitioners and policymakers were co-investigators on the research team. Some of them contributed to the writing of this paper. Their additional insights about the data served to bring credibility to our collective interpretation.",

Although many health unit service providers were unaware of the policy change, engagement in developing the policy or provision of feedback by health unit staff at the front line as well as the management level was positively received. Implementation of the policy was most evident in planning processes that incorporated many internal stakeholders as well as community partners. The policy was also incorporated in operational planning documents such as logic models. Factors influencing implementation were closely aligned to components of Greenhalgh and colleagues' Diffusion of Innovations in Service Organizations framework. Most notably, the nature of the policy itself (e.g., its prescriptiveness), organizational leadership, planning processes, governance, health human resources, local and regional economics, as well as provincial and national factors such as other policies, best practice evidence and networks had an influence on implementation. Our results provide empirical support for components of Greenhalgh et als' framework [23] and suggest that two additional components be consideredthe role of external partnerships with other sectors and the influence of planning processes. The constructsplanning processes and cosmopolitanism (links to external organizations)are identified in the more recent Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research [40] . These influences are important to consider by public health organizations when implementing new or revised provincial public health policies given that they constantly change and evolve over time.
