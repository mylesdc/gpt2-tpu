In 2003, a reassorted H1N2 swine influenza virus (SIV) subtype appeared and became prevalent in Denmark. In the present study, the reassortant H1N2 subtype was characterised genetically and the infection dynamics compared to an \"avian-like\" H1N1 virus by an experimental infection study. Methods: Sequence analyses were performed of the H1N2 virus. Two groups of pigs were inoculated with the reassortant H1N2 virus and an \"avian-like\" H1N1 virus, respectively, followed by inoculation with the opposite subtype four weeks later. Measurements of HI antibodies and acute phase proteins were performed. Nasal virus excretion and virus load in lungs were determined by real-time RT-PCR.",

Sequence analyses of the internal genes revealed that the reassortment probably arose between circulating Danish \"avian-like\" H1N1 and H3N2 SIVs. Infected pigs developed cross-reactive antibodies, and increased levels of acute phase proteins after inoculations. Pigs inoculated with H1N2 exhibited nasal virus excretion for seven days, peaking day 1 after inoculation two days earlier than H1N1 infected pigs and at a six times higher level. The difference, however, was not statistically significant. Pigs euthanized on day 4 after inoculation, had a high virus load in all lung lobes. After the second inoculation, the nasal virus excretion was minimal. There were no clinical sign except elevated body temperature under the experimental conditions.",

            "text": "Influenza A virus is a common cause of respiratory disease in swine. The virus also infects other species including humans and birds. Influenza A viruses are classified into different subtypes based on the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). So far, 17 different HA and 10 different NA subtypes have been described [1] [2] [3] [4] . The predominant swine influenza virus (SIV) subtypes worldwide are H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2, all of which show considerable diversity within each subtype. Until the emergence of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 (H1N1pdm09) virus, which possesses a \"classicalswine\" H1 HA gene, the European H1N1 SIV belonged exclusively to the \"avian-like\" lineage of SIV with all eight gene segments of avian origin [5] or they were reassortants hereof retaining the \"avian-like\" H1 HA. European H3N2 SIV are human-avian reassortants retaining the HA and NA genes from human H3N2 virus, whereas the remaining gene segments originate from \"avian-like\" H1N1 SIV [6] . H1N2, which is the most recently recognized new European SIV subtype, was first reported from Great Britain in 1995 [7] . This virus possessed an HA closely related to that of human A/England/80-like H1N1 viruses, an NA probably derived from a swine H3N2 virus, and internal gene segments of avian origin [8] . Subsequent spread of related \"human-like\" H1N2 viruses has been reported from several European countries (Italy and France [9] , Belgium [10] , Germany [11] and Spain [12] ) including reassortments containing HA from the \"human-like\" H1N2 [13] . \"Human-like\" H1N2 viruses (so-called delta clade viruses) have also been reported from North America [14] but other H1N2 viruses that are circulating in North America and Asia [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] contain HA genes of \"classical-swine\" H1N1 origin descending from the very first SIVs, which were isolated from pigs in USA in 1930 [20] and resemble human viruses responsible for the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. Since the emergence of the H1N1pdm09 virus in swine, several descendant reassortant viruses have been recognized, including H1N2 with all genes from the pandemic virus except the N2 [21] and an H1N2 with HA and NA from the \"human-like\" swine H1N2 and the rest of the genes from H1N1pdm09 virus [22] . H1N2 viruses with \"avian-like\" H1 have earlier been reported from France and Italy [9, 23] , but without having been established in the regional pig populations. In Denmark, the H1N2 subtype was first recognized in a lung tissue sample from a pig with coughing, fever and panting, showing indications of bronchopneumonia. This pig was submitted to the National Veterinary Institute for diagnosis of SIV in 2003. The detected virus (A/swine/ Denmark/12687/2003(H1N2) had an \"avian-like\" H1, and this reassorted H1N2 subtype has since then continuously been detected from lung tissue and nasal swabs from Danish pigs throughout the country, and is now established in Denmark (unpublished data). Prior to 2003, only the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes had been isolated in Denmark [24] . The \"avian-like\" H1N2 has been reported previously from Sweden and Italy [25] [26] [27] . The aim of the present study was to make a genetic characterization of the Danish reassorted \"avian-like\" H1N2 virus and to compare the cross-protection and infection dynamics of the reassorted \"avian-like\" H1N2 with the older endemic \"avian-like\" H1N1 virus.",

The NA gene of the Danish H1N2 viruses clustered phylogenetically with concurrent Danish H3N2 viruses with an identity between 91-99% ( Table 2 ). The nucleotide sequence comparisons of all gene segments are shown in Table 3 and phylogenetic trees for the internal genes are shown in Figure 3 . The nucleotide sequences of the internal genes of two H1N2 isolates were determined and they showed a high degree of identity with those of either the H1N1 and/or H3N2 Danish contemporary SIV isolates (93-99% nucleotide identity). The comparisons also revealed that A/swine/ Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) had more genes with high identity to A/swine/Denmark/14348-9/2003(H3N2) than to A/swine/Denmark/14348-3/2003(H1N1), whereas A/ swine/Denmark/12687/2003(H1N2) was more identical to A/swine/Denmark/14348-3/2003(H1N1).

After the 2 nd inoculation on day 28, the pigs were negative by this assay, except for two pigs in group 2 that were positive on day 29 and 35 and only day 35, respectively. Virus was detected with the screening assay in all nine lung samples from pigs euthanized on day 4 but not from pigs euthanized on day 56. The results of the quantitative real time RT-PCR assay on the positive samples showed virus excretions from PID 1 to PID 6-8 ( Figure 7 ). For the pigs in group 1 (H1N1 inoculated), the virus titre peaked with an average of 5.8 \u00d7 10 6 TCID50 equivalents on PID 3. For the pigs in group 2 (H1N2 inoculated), the peak was approximately 6 times higher reaching 3.6 \u00d7 10 7 TCID50 equivalents PID 1.

Furthermore, the amount of virus in the different areas of the lungs varied between the pigs. The average virus load of the nine lung sections for pigs in groups 1 and 2 were 1.77 \u00d7 10 8 TCID50 equivalents and 2.58 \u00d7 10 7 TCID50 equivalents, respectively.

            "text": "The Danish \"avian-like\" H1N2 subtype variant was shown to harbour an HA gene of \"avian-like\" H1N1 SIV origin, thus differing significantly genetically and antigenic from the prevalent H1N2 viruses circulating in most of Europe which have a human-like HA gene. The phylogenetic analyses showed that the genes of the reassorted H1N2 virus had very high identity to contemporary H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes circulating in Danish pigs in 2003. Based on the sequence analysis, the Danish H1N2 subtypes apparently arose by two independent reassortment events. This is sustained by the full-genome sequencing analysis which revealed a closer relationship of the two analysed H1N2 isolates internal genes to Danish H1N1 and H3N2, respectively, than to each other. It is also interesting that all of the other sequenced Danish H1N2 viruses phylogenetically grouped together with A/swine/Denmark/ 13608/2004(H1N2), and that A/swine/Denmark/12687/ 2003(H1N2) formed a separate cluster. Interestingly, H1N2 viruses with high sequence similarity to the Danish H1N2 in all gene segments were recently reported from Sweden (A/swine/Sweden/1021/2009(H1N2) and A/swine/Sweden/9706/2010(H1N2)) and Italy (A/swine/ Italy/58769/2009(H1N2)) [25] [26] [27] . The viruses from Sweden and Italy had the highest level of similarity to the A/swine/ [28, 29] . At the receptor binding domain of the HA-protein, a different motif at position 225 was seen for the A/swine/Denmark/12687/2003(H1N2) compared to the other H1N2 viruses confirming a difference between the clusters. The H1N2 virus was detected in Denmark for the first time in 2003, approximately 6-7 years before it was found in Sweden. A publication from 2012 regarding Italian H1N2 SIV reports a retrospective finding of the \"avian-like\" H1N2 in samples from 2002 [27] . Before the discovery of the Danish H1N2 subtype, subtyping of SIV in Denmark was performed using HItest. The HI-test only subtypes the HA of influenza A virus and the reassortant H1N2 virus may easily have been missed. Thus, due to the lack of systematic surveillance data in Europe at that time, the exact geographical origin of the new H1N2 subtype cannot be documented. Nevertheless, we speculate that the reassortment event happened between two Danish strains of H1N2 and H3N2 and subsequently spread to other European countries by export of living pigs. This hypothesis is supported by the full genome characterisation of the new reassorted viruses which showed that all gene segments were almost identical to genes of contemporary Danish H1N1 or H3N2 isolates. Furthermore, Denmark has a minimal import of live pigs from other countries which hamper introduction of new isolates. Accordingly, Denmark is free from the \"human-like\" H1N2 SIV which has been prevalent in central Europe for the last decades. The introduction of the virus into Sweden and Italy can be explained by the import of pigs from Denmark since pigs are not routinely tested for SIV in connection to export. Indeed, according to the National Association of Pig Breeders in Italy (ANAS), the import of living swine to Italy from Denmark is substantial. Taken together the Danish \"avian-like\" H1N2 subtype may be the first H1N2 subtype established within a pig population which possesses an HA of avian-like H1N1 origin.",

            "text": "The emergence of reassortant viruses in swine from concurrent circulating swine viruses occasionally occurs. Most European H1N2 viruses are closely related to A/ swine/Scotland/4104/1994(H1N2) having an HA of human origin [9] . As an exception, A/swine/Italy/2064/1999 (H1N2) has an HA gene related to the Danish H1N2 HA gene, and to concurrent Italian H1N1 and other European avian-like H1N1 viruses [9] . However, the NA gene of A/ swine/Italy/2064/1999(H1N2) is closely related to NA genes of European H1N2 viruses, contrary to the Danish subtype which has an NA gene closer related to that of concurrent Danish H3N2 viruses. Thus, A/swine/Italy/ 2064/1999(H1N2) may be a reassortment of avian-like H1N1 and A/swine/Scotland/4104/94(H1N2)-like viruses. There have been no further reports on this virus, so this reassortant virus probably was unsuccessful in becoming established in the local and regional pig population. Recently, reassortments containing genes from the H1N1pdm09 virus have occurred i.e. an H1N2 with all genes from the pandemic virus except the N2 [21] and an H1N2 with HA and NA from the European swine H1N2 and the rest of the genes from the pandemic virus [22] . These findings further sustain the need for continuous SIV monitoring nationally and sharing of SIV surveillance data internationally. Under the experimental conditions of the present study, the \"avian-like\" H1N2 subtype induced more severe macroscopic lung lesions compared to the older \"avian-like\" H1N1 subtype. The virus load in the lungs and the nasal excretions were slightly higher for the H1N2 infected pigs, however, the difference between groups was not statistically significant. In the pigs euthanized PID 4, virus was present in high amounts in most of the lung sections and did not show a predilection for any particular lung lobe, even though the macroscopic changes were more pronounced in the cranial parts. This is in accordance with findings of De Vleeschauwer et al. [30] who also were unable to demonstrate a particular pattern in virus titres in cranial and caudal lung lobes after an H1N1 infection in pigs. Initial reports from the field in 2004 claimed that the severity and duration of clinical signs elicited in response to the H1N2 virus was more severe compared with the H1N1 or H3N2 viruses, respectively (unpublished data). However, the results only provided a non-significant tendency for the H1N2 virus to be more virulent than the H1N1 virus. Apparently, the pigs elicited no clinical signs in response to experimental inoculation. The pigs were specific laboratory raised animals of high sanitary status free from the majority of pathogens known to cause disease in pigs [31] . They were kept in isolation without any contact to other animals eliminating the risk of exposure to new pathogens during the experiment. Furthermore, the pigs were not exposed to the same stress as pigs housed under field conditions and they had plenty of room and grooming material. This is probably the explanation for the lack of clinical signs even though the pigs clearly were infected as revealed by a slight rise in body temperature 1-3 days after challenge, the development of specific SIV antibodies, and the induction of an acute phase protein response following both the primary and the secondary inoculations. These observations further sustain that the clinical consequences of swine influenza virus infections under field conditions are highly dependent on management and the general health status of the herds. Influenza A virus was excreted nasally from the day after inoculation until approximately PID 7 in pigs from both infection groups following the primary inoculation. After the second inoculation at PID 28, no or very low levels of nasal virus excretion was detected and only for one day which firmly indicate that there is a high level of cross-protection between the subtypes. An antibody response was elicited after inoculation of the first virus isolate and the response was boosted when the pigs were re-inoculated with the second virus isolate. Haptoglobin and CRP responses to primary infection with H1N1 and H1N2 were very similar. In contrast, no SSA response to primary infection with H1N2 was seen. Pomorska-M\u00f3l et al. [32] showed data on the induction of pig acute phase proteins CRP, haptoglobin and SAA after single experimental infection with a Polish \"human-like\" H1N2 SIV subtype and found a rapid and substantial increase in CRP, haptoglobin, and SAA. In the present study sampling was not performed at PID 2 and 3, therefore an SAA response to the primary H1N2 infection might have been missed. The results, however, corroborate well the results of Pomorska-M\u00f3l et al. showing pronounced haptogobin and CRP responses at day 4 post infection with H1N2. Taken together, these data indicated that infection with either H1N1 or H1N2 induces a high level of cross-protection against infection with the other virus. This was expected since the HA of the two subtypes is of the same \"avian-like\" origin.",

The duration of virus excretion following the primary H1N1 and H1N2 inoculation was comparable; however, the amount of virus excreted was approximately six-fold higher for pigs infected with H1N2 compared to H1N1 infected pigs. The H1N2 subtype has been very successful in spreading and constitute now 20% of the circulating subtypes in Danish pigs (own unpublished observations). The reason for this is not known but it's interesting that this virus has succeeded in spreading despite existing immunity against the H protein of the H1N1 subtypes that has been circulating in Denmark since the mid-1980s.

The \"avian-like\" H1N2 differs from other H1N2 subtypes in most of Europe and USA. There are two clusters of the Danish H1N2 variant and one of them seems to have spread to countries like Sweden and Italy. The experimental study shows comparable infection dynamic between the \"avian-like\" H1N2 and \"avian-like\" H1N1 with a tendency of the H1N2 to have a slightly larger impact on lungs. There were no clear clinical sign except elevated body temperature under the experimental conditions. Systemic responses to both virus subtypes were recognised by a clear antibody and acute phase response and there were a clear cross-protection between the two subtypes of \"avian-like\" H1N2 and \"avian-like\" H1N1.",

The real time RT-PCR was performed in a Rotor-Gene 3000 machine (Corbett Research, Australia) in a total volume of 25 \u03bcl using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Germany) with 2 \u03bcl of extracted RNA, 0.6 \u03bcM of each primer (Forward Primer MMU39 and Reverse Primer MMU19), and 6.25\u00d7 SYBR green (Invitrogen SYBR\u00ae Green I Nucleic acid stain 10000\u00d7). The amplification temperature profile was 50\u00b0C for 30 min for reverse transcription followed by 95\u00b0C for 15 min and 45 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 20 s, 60\u00b0C for 20 s and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. This was immediately followed by a melting point analysis: 50\u00b0C for 60 s, ramping from 50\u00b0C to 99\u00b0C in increments of 1\u00b0C and holding for 15 s at each step. The fluorescence signal was measured at 72\u00b0C during each PCR cycle and at each temperature increment step during the melting analysis. All fluorescence measurements were analysed with the Rotor-Gene Software Version 6.0. with non template control (NTC) threshold set at 10% and the normalised fluorescence threshold limit set at 0.05 for cycle threshold (Ct values) determination.",

The real time RT-PCR was performed in a Rotor-Gene 3000 machine (Corbett Research, Australia) with a total reaction volume of 25 \u03bcl using the RNA Ultrasense\u2122 One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invitrogen), 5 \u03bcl of extracted RNA, 0.4 \u03bcM of forward primer, 1.0 \u03bcM of FAM-labelled reverse primer, and 1.0 \u03bcM of Cy5-labelled probe. The amplification temperature profile was 50\u00b0C for 30 min for reverse transcription followed by 95\u00b0C for 5 min and 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 20 s and finally by 72\u00b0C for 5 min. This was immediately followed by a melting point analysis: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, ramping from 40\u00b0C to 99\u00b0C in increments of 1\u00b0C and holding for 30 s at each step. The fluorescence signal was measured at 55\u00b0C during each PCR cycle and at each temperature increment step during the melting analysis. Signals were generated by excitation of the donor fluorophor (FAM) followed by collection of emission spectra from the acceptor fluorophor (Cy5). All fluorescence measurements were analysed with the Rotor-Gene Software Version 6.0. In each real time RT-PCR run, RNA purified from cell cultured A/swine/ Denmark/19126/1993 (H1N1) with 10 3.8 TCID50 per ml was used as positive control and RNase free water as negative control. The NTC threshold was set at 10% and the normalised fluorescence threshold limit at 0.02 for cycle threshold (Ct) value determination. A standard curve for the real time RT-PCR assay was obtained using a ten-fold dilution series made from an initial concentration of 10 7.8 TCID50 per ml of the virus A/swine/Denmark/ 19126/1993 (H1N1). Ct-values from samples were calibrated towards the standard curve to obtain a relative quantification of TCID50 equivalents. The efficiency of the PCR was 92% and the range of quantification spanned 6 log 10 dilutions from dilution 10 -1 to 10 -7 .",

In general the internal genes of the Danish reassortant H1N2 viruses clustered phylogenetically with European viruses and separated from American \"classical-swine\" H1 and H1pdm09 virus strains. In all gene segments, A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) had a very high nucleotide identity (HA gene~96%, NA gene~96%) to H1N2 reassortant viruses detected in Sweden and Italy in 2009 and 2010 (Table 2) containing avian-like H1 and N2 from H3N2 SIV, and they group closely together in the phylogenetic trees. At the amino acid level, seven N-glycosylation sites (positions 28, 40, 71, 179, 291, 498, 557) were predicted for A/swine/ Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) in the HA protein, whereas only 4 sites (positions 28, 40, 498, 557) were predicted in A/swine/Denmark/12687/2003(H1N2). The Italian A/swine Italy/58769/2010(H1N2) had conserved glycosylation sites similar to A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004 (H1N2), but had an additional predicted site at position 212. The Swedish viruses showed all the predicted glycosylation sites of the A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004 (H1N2) virus except for 71 or 179 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In the receptor binding domain of the HA protein, all Danish H1 viruses as well as the Swedish and Italian viruses had a D in position 190. In position 225, A/swine/Denmark/13608/2004(H1N2) and the Italian virus had K, whereas the A/swine/Denmark/12687/2003 (H1N2) had an E.
