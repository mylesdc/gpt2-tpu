            "text": "Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a bilateral, chronic sightthreatening ocular disease which usually occurs in patients under 20 years of age. [1, 2] VKC has a wide geographical distribution and is commonly found in warm, dry areas. [3, 4] Patients with VKC usually present with eye irritation, itching, redness, tearing, pain, and blurred vision. [5] The etiology of VKC is still unclear, but a Th2-mediated allergic mechanism thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. [6] VKC can result in permanent decrease or loss of vision if treatment failed. [7, 8] To achieve good treatment outcomes, long duration of drug treatment combined with living habit adjustment is needed. There are numerous topical drugs used in VKC treatment, such as vasoconstrictors, mast-cell stabilizers, antihistamines, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators. [9] These drugs reduce signs and symptoms in the acute phase of VKC, but the therapeutic results are not satisfied. [10, 11] Recently, herbal medicine becomes an alternative therapy for numbers of diseases. Houttuynia, a traditional Chinese herb primarily found in China, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia, has been used for the treatment of various disease for hundreds of years. [12, 13] The main active components of Houttuynia are flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, ionones, and some alkaloids. [14] Houttuynia extracts are proved to have antibacterial, antiallergic, antiinflammatory, and antioxidative effect. [12, [15] [16] [17] It is reported that Houttuynia eye drops (HED) can achieve good effect in the treatment of VKC. [18] However, there is no systemic review and meta-analysis published regarding the clinical efficacy of HED. Here we plan to run a systemic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy of HED for the treatment of VKC.",
