The re-emergence of CHIKV and the continual risk of new epidemics have reignited research in CHIKV pathogenesis. Virus-specific antibodies have been shown to control virus clearance, but antibodies present at sub-neutralizing concentrations can also augment virus infection that exacerbates disease severity. To explore this occurrence, CHIKV infection was investigated in the presence of CHIKV-specific antibodies in both primary human cells and a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7. Enhanced attachment of CHIKV to the primary human monocytes and B cells was observed while increased viral replication was detected in RAW264.7 cells. Blocking of specific Fc receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) led to the abrogation of these observations. Furthermore, experimental infection in adult mice showed that animals had higher viral RNA loads and endured more severe joint inflammation in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of CHIKV-specific antibodies. In addition, CHIKV infection in 11 days old mice under enhancing condition resulted in higher muscles viral RNA load detected and death. These observations provide the first evidence of antibody-mediated enhancement in CHIKV infection and pathogenesis and could also be relevant for other important arboviruses such as Zika virus.",

For the past decade, re-emergence of CHIKV has led to numerous outbreaks in different parts of the world: Asia 5-12 , Europe 4,13,14 and islands in the Indian Ocean 15,16 .

At low antibody concentration, antibody-mediated enhancement was shown to occur at antibody concentrations of 3.6 \u00b1 2.9 \u03bcg/ml ( Table 1 ). The presence of CHIKV antigen was detected by flow cytometry, where detection was increased by ~5 fold in monocytes (Fig. 1a ) and by ~20 fold in B cells (Fig. 1b) . However, active virus replication was not observed (Fig. 1c ,d) in both cell types. Next, a Zs-Green tagged CHIKV variant was used for the infection of human whole blood. With this virus, a successful infection would lead to the production of the Zs-Green protein. Levels of infection can therefore be known through the detection of Zs-Green positive cells. It was observed that infection in the presence of patients' plasma (total IgG concentrations of 1.8 \u00b1 1.45 \u00b5g/ml) led to an increase in the numbers of Zs-Green positive monocytes. However, this was not observed in the B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (Fig. S1a ). Once again, the viral RNA load did not concur with enhanced infection (Fig. S1b ).",

RAW264.7 cells have high levels of Fc\u03b3RII/III (Fig. 3d) . As a result, an increased in CHIKV infection was observed at 6 hpi in the presence of sub-neutralizing levels of CHIKV-specific mouse sera containing ~2 \u03bcg/ml of total IgG antibodies ( Table 1) (Fig. 3e) . The increased in CHIKV infection was further complemented with higher viral RNA load (Fig. 3f) . Given that enhanced CHIKV infection in RAW264.7 cells led to both increased levels of CHIKV antigen detected and viral RNA load, the consequences of this enhancement was further studied via gene expression analyses on the Type-I Interferon (IFN) and pro-inflammatory pathways (Fig. 4a) . Expectedly, high levels of several pro-inflammatory and anti-viral genes such as IL-6, iNOS, IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, IRF3, IRF9, Viperin and ISG15 were detected starting at 6 hpi when CHIKV infection was enhanced (Fig. 4b) .",

Tissue immune-phenotyping (Fig. S4 ) further revealed higher levels of infiltration of neutrophils and possibly CD4+ T cells into the joint footpad at 6 days post-infection (dpi) during enhanced CHIKV infection (Fig. 5c ). Moreover, a much lower number of CD4+ T cells and monocytes were present in the popliteal lymph node (pLN) draining the right footpad (Fig. 5d) , indicating the possible egress of these cells from the pLN into the circulation or infected tissues during enhanced infection. Gene expression studies also revealed higher levels of IFN\u03b3 as well as IL-10 in the inflamed footpad during enhanced infection.

It has been demonstrated that prophylactic administration of human purified polyvalent immunoglobulins G (IgG) containing anti-CHIKV antibodies (CHIKVIGs) protected susceptible IFN\u03b1/\u03b2R\u2212/\u2212 adult animals and wild-type neonates during CHIKV infection 49 . To assess if these antibodies could exacerbate CHIKV disease severity at sub-neutralizing concentrations, different concentrations of CHIKVIGs were administered intra-peritoneally to CHIKV-infected 11 days old C57BL/6 WT mice at the ventral thorax 40 (Fig. 7) . Mortality was observed in mice receiving CHIKVIGs at concentrations of 1-100 \u00b5g/kg (Fig. 7a) , whereas mice receiving either 1000 \u00b5g/kg or 0.1 \u00b5g/kg of CHIKVIGs survived the infection. Unexpectedly, approximately 30% of mice receiving a control non-CHIKV-specific polyvalent IgG also died from infection (Fig. 7a) . Nevertheless, viral RNA load in serum, liver and muscles was determined in CHIKV-infected mice receiving 10 \u00b5g/kg of CHIKVIGs. It was observed that enhanced CHIKV infection led to a more significant viral burden in the muscles at 3 dpi ( Fig. 7b) , but not at 6 dpi (Fig. 7c) . Taken together, these findings highlight that enhanced CHIKV infection is detrimental in young animals.",

            "text": "This study provides the first documentation of antibody-mediated enhancement in CHIKV infection in vitro and in relevant in vivo mouse models. Despite the increased detection of CHIKV antigen in primary human monocytes, B cells and MDMs when infection was performed in the presence of sub-neutralizing levels of CHIKV-specific antibodies, viral replication was not increased. Antibody-mediated enhancement in viral infections has been reported to mostly involve Fc\u03b3Rs 22 . The involvement of Fc\u03b3Rs in enhancing CHIKV infection may lead to two outcomes: the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways (Fig. 8 ). In the extrinsic pathway, virus attachment and possibly entry is facilitated without much significance to viral replication and manipulation of host immune responses 22, 50 . Results obtained with infection in the whole blood, primary human monocytes, B cells and MDMs supported that the extrinsic pathway is at play. The increase detection of Zs-Green signal in MDMs during the later time points is suggestive of viral entry and initiation of viral replication, as the Zs-Green is cloned under a duplicated sub-genomic promoter 42, 51 . However, no further increase in both Zs-Green signal and viral RNA load may suggest that enhanced CHIKV infection do not necessary augments viral replication. This quick shutdown of viral replication may actually indicate a putative mechanism employed by CHIKV for chronic persistence. While it is known that CHIKV could persist chronically using macrophages as possible cellular reservoirs 38, 39 , its exact mechanism is not known. As such, the restricted replication observed in monocytes and MDMs could be a form of immune subversion by the virus to achieve chronic persistency 52 .",

Intriguingly, enhanced CHIKV infection in murine RAW264.7 macrophages was even more prominent when the virus started replicating (6 hpi). Subsequently, this led to the high expression of several pro-inflammatory and anti-viral genes. This observation is enthralling as similar studies in DENV and RRV reported the down-regulation of these pro-inflammatory responses 31, 32, [53] [54] [55] [56] . While the data in this report differs, it opens up another compelling perspective in which enhanced CHIKV infection in susceptible cells can lead to augmented virus entry and replication, resulting in an active pro-inflammatory response from the infected cells (Fig. 8) . While the consequences of the elevated immune response remains to be investigate, it is plausible that CHIKV manipulates this immune outcome to its own advantage to achieve chronicity, as observed for other viral infections 57 .",

Patient plasma and mice serum samples used in this study at a low dilution factor have been previously shown to be strongly neutralizing 44, 46, 61, 62 and recognized epitopes located mainly on the CHIKV E2 glycoprotein 44, 46 . Furthermore, these CHIKV-specific antibodies were of IgG3 isotype 62 , and hence capable of moving across the placenta 63 . It remains to be seen if infants born to mothers infected with CHIKV during their pregnancy may suffer from a more severe disease due to the low levels of maternal-acquired CHIKV-specific antibodies. It was reported that newborn mice infected with DENV in the presence of maternally acquired anti-DENV antibodies had a more severe disease outcome 64 . Three-weeks old, C57BL/6 WT female mice (n = 5 animals per group) were infected via footpad inoculation with 10 6 PFU of CHIKV. Immediately, these mice were administered intraperitoneally with ~2 \u00b5g/ml (total IgG concentration) mice sera from CHIKV-infected mice (enhanced) or PBS (non-enhanced). Daily assessment of (a) viremia and (b) disease score were performed. All Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD by Mann-Whitney U test (*P = 0.0278, *P = 0.0159, *P = 0.0159 and *P = 0.0297 for 2, 3, 4 and 5 dpi viremia respectively; **P = 0.0040, **P = 0.0079, **P = 0.0060, **P = 0.0079, **P = 0.0079, *P = 0.0104, *P = 0.0172, **P = 0.0040, **P = 0.0060, *P = 0.0106 and *P = 0.0106 for 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14 dpi disease score respectively). Immune-phenotyping was performed for (c) footpad and (d) popliteal lymph node on 6 dpi. Results are displayed as number of neutrophils, CD4+ T cells and monocytes per organ from 4 to 10 animals per group. (e) Total RNA was extracted from the joint footpads of infected mice (n = 5 to 10 animals per group) and qRT-PCR was performed to detect for the expression of crucial immune genes. Gene expression data are expressed as fold expression relative to the mock-infected mice. Mice sacrificed for immune-phenotyping and gene expression studies were infected as described for (a,b). All Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD by Mann-Whitney U test (*P = 0.0186, *P = 0.0326 and *P = 0.0185 for neutrophils, monocytes and CD4+ T cells infiltration into respective organs; *P = 0.0276, *P = 0.0376 and *P = 0.0376 for IFN\u03b3, DEF14 and IL-10 expression respectively). Using the joint footpad mouse model of CHIKV infection [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] , disease severity was greatly enhanced in both WT and IFN\u03b1R+/\u2212 mice upon passive administration of low levels of CHIKV-specific antibodies. The exact mechanisms of this phenomenon remains to be fully elucidated. However as presented in this study, the disruption of host immune response could be a crucial driving force behind the augmented disease severity. This brings caution to the phenomenon that sub-neutralizing concentrations of virus-specific antibodies can enhance severity of infection and advocates the need for careful vaccine design and extensive pre-clinical trials. In fact, it was reported that CHIKV severity was increased in vaccinated mice that presented sub-optimal immune responses 65 . Unfortunately, it was also observed that a proportion of mice receiving the na\u00efve human polyvalent antibodies succumbed to CHIKV infection. This was definitely an unexpected observation and could be due to the presence of unknown artifacts present in the control antibodies that resulted in this outcome. These na\u00efve polyvalent antibodies had previously been shown not to exhibit any immuno-reactivity against CHIKV 49 .",

Cells were further incubated at 37 \u00b0C, with atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO 2, , before being harvested at indicated time points. During harvesting, 140 \u03bcl of infected cell suspension was aliquoted for viral RNA extraction. For gene expression studies, an aliquot of cell suspension was spun down and the resultant cell pellet was dried before being stored in \u221280 \u00b0C for downstream total RNA extraction. Remaining cells were collected by centrifugation and fixed with FACS lysing buffer (BD Biosciences) and stored for downstream staining procedures. Mock and non-enhanced control infections were performed by incubating cells with serum-free DMEM (Gibco) and viruses respectively.

For whole blood and human MDMs, CHIKV infection was directly quantified by the detection of Zs-Green signal under the FITC channel. For detection of CHIKV antigen in RAW264.7 cells, staining was performed with rabbit anti-CHIKV nsP2 antibodies followed by secondary staining with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Invitrogen). For primary human cells, an additional staining step was performed. Surface markers Pacific-Blue-conjugated mouse anti-human CD45, Qdot-605-conjugated mouse anti-human CD19, PerCP Cy5.5 mouse anti-human CD14 and PE-Cy7-conjugated mouse anti-human BDCA2 (all antibodies were from eBiosciences) were stained following manufacturer's protocol. Human monocytes, B cells and pDCs are defined by the specific surface expression of CD14, CD19 and BDCA2 respectively. Data was acquired using either BD FACS Calibur or BD FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences). Softwares used include BD CellQuest Pro software (for FACSCalibur) and BD FACSDiva software (for FACSCanto II) (BD Biosciences). Gating strategy is shown in Fig. S5 . A total of 30,000-50,000 cells were acquired and results were analyzed with FlowJo (version 10) (Tree Star).",

Virus-antibody complexes are formed when antibodies are present in sub-neutralizing concentrations and are taken up by cells expressing Fc\u03b3Rs via either extrinsic or intrinsic pathways. Extrinsic pathways result in increased virus attachment and possibly entry with no visible benefits to virus replication. Whereas in intrinsic pathways, it can lead to enhanced antiinflammatory or enhanced pro-inflammatory infection. Enhanced anti-inflammatory infection downplays the inflammatory response associated with normal infection and instead upregulates the anti-inflammatory response leading to heightened infection and viral replication. In enhanced pro-inflammatory infection, it leads to an increased in active infection, without negative suppression of pro-inflammatory immune response.
