Huh7.5 cells (left panel), DPP4-untransfected HEK 293 cells (middle panel), and DPP4-transfected HEK 293 cells (right panel) were stained with goat anti-DPP4 antibody (in blue) and control antibody (in red) and analyzed by flow cytometry. (b) Transduction of DPP4-expressing cells by pseudotyped MERS-CoV England1 virus. Huh7.5 and HEK 293 cells without and with DPP4-transfection (in grey and black bars) were transduced by MERS-CoV pseudotyped virus. Relative expression of luciferase activity was measured (CPS). Untransfected and untransduced cells were used as the background control (open bars). Each bar represents the mean of triplicate assays with standard errors. One representative of two experiments is shown. (c) Transduction of Huh7.5 cells by MERS-CoV pseudovirus was blocked by soluble human DPP4 (sDPP4). MERS-CoV England1 pseudovirus was incubated with soluble human DPP4 before transduction of Huh7.5 cells. Relative luciferase activity (CPS) is shown. (d) Transduction of Huh7.5 cells by MERS-CoV pseudovirus was blocked by anti-DPP4, but not anti-ACE2 antibody.

The final round of screens generated 45 subclones. Supernatant from the subclones culture were subjected to neutralization and binding tests. Percentage of neutralization against pseudoviruses of Eng1 strain from the subclones was determined and is shown highlighted from high (red > 90%) to low (green < 1%). Supernatants from the subclones were assessed for binding to the RBDs, S1 and S-\uf044TM proteins. OD450nm values are indicated for strong binding (red, > 3) to weak binding (green, < 1). Western blot analysis was done to assess whether the subclones can recognize denatured S linear eptitopes. Based on the ELISA binding data, the mAbs were classified into three groups: RBD specific, S1 specific (non-RBD) and S2 specific as indicated. Four of these mAbs (D12, F11, G2 and G4) were selected for additional characterization based on their antigenic specificity and high neutralization potency. Figure 7 . Octet Biosensorgrams of MERS-CoV S1, RBD, S2 molecules binding to vaccine-induced mouse monoclonal IgGs. Mouse monoclonal antibodies were loaded onto AMC probes and association with MERS-CoV antigen was allowed to proceed for 300 s, followed by dissociation for 300 s with the responses measured in nm using an Octet Red 384 machine. The S2 binding to G4 was measured by loading human-Fc-S2 onto AHC probes and measuring association with varying concentrations of G4 Fab. The solid black lines represent the best fit of the kinetic data to a 1:1 binding model. All experiments were carried out, in triplicate, at 30\u00b0C in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1% BSA to minimize non-specific binding. The dotted line indicates the beginning of dissociation and the legend indicates the MERS CoV antigen and G4 Fab concentrations used. Supplementary Figure 11 .

(b) Multiple neutralizing epitopes are accessible on MERS CoV RBD. MERS CoV RBD was loaded onto anti-penta-His probes for 300 s followed by sequential binding of both D12 and F11 mAbs. (c) Soluble DPP4 prevents binding of RBD to D12 and F11 mAbs. MERS CoV RBD was loaded onto anti-penta-His probes for 300 s followed by sequential binding of DPP4 and either D12 or F11 mAbs.
