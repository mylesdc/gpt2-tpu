            "text": "The Tasmanian devil is an endangered carnivorous marsupial threatened by devil facial tumor disease (DFTD). While research on DFTD has been extensive, little is known about viruses in devils and whether any are of potential conservation relevance for this endangered species. Using both metagenomics based on virion enrichment and sequence-independent amplification (virion-enriched metagenomics) and metatranscriptomics based on bulk RNA sequencing, we characterized and compared the fecal viromes of captive and wild devils. A total of 54 fecal samples collected from two captive and four wild populations were processed for virome characterization using both approaches. In total, 24 novel marsupial-related viruses, comprising a sapelovirus, astroviruses, rotaviruses, picobirnaviruses, parvoviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, and a gammaherpesvirus, were identified, as well as known mammalian pathogens such as rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2. Captive devils showed significantly lower viral diversity than wild devils. Comparison of the two virus discovery approaches revealed substantial differences in the number and types of viruses detected, with metatranscriptomics better suited for RNA viruses and virion-enriched metagenomics largely identifying more DNA viruses. Thus, the viral communities revealed by virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were not interchangeable and neither approach was able to detect all viruses present. An integrated approach using both virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics constitutes a powerful tool for obtaining a complete overview of both the taxonomic and functional profiles of viral communities within a sample. IMPORTANCE The Tasmanian devil is an iconic Australian marsupial that has suffered an 80% population decline due to a contagious cancer, devil facial tumor disease, along with other threats. Until now, viral discovery in this species has been confined to one gammaherpesvirus (dasyurid herpesvirus 2 [DaHV-2]), for which captivity was identified as a significant risk factor. Our discovery of 24 novel marsupial-associated RNA and DNA viruses, and that viral diversity is lower in captive than in wild devils, has greatly expanded our knowledge of gut-associated viruses in devils and provides important baseline information that will contribute to the conservation and captive management of this endangered species. Our results also revealed that a combination of virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics may be a more comprehensive approach for virome characterization than either method alone. Our results thus provide a springboard for continuous improvements in the way we study complex viral communities.",

For both approaches, a substantial proportion of reads had no significant similarity to other sequences in the databases in GenBank (10.22 to 29.20%). Overall, virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics differed in the viruses detected as well as the expected counts (transcript abundance) as measured by RSEM analysis (Fig. 2c and d) . Viruses from a wide range of viral groups were detected with metatranscriptomics, of which 49.87 to 97.51% had the closest hits to RNA viruses and 2.49 to 50.13% to DNA viruses. Conversely, for virion-enriched metagenomics, \u03fe95.54% of the virus-related sequences had the closest hits to DNA viruses, and \u03fd5% were identified as RNA viruses (Fig. 2b) . Metatranscriptomics revealed high levels of viral diversity across all libraries, the most abundant viral groups detected being Caudovirales, Luteo-Sobemo, Narna-Levi, Partiti-Picobirna, Picorna-Calici, and Tombus-Noda (Fig. 2c) . Conversely, virionenriched metagenomics revealed relatively lower viral diversity across the same libraries; Caudovirales dominated the viral reads (69.89 to 99.49%), while viral groups identified at much lower abundances included Microviridae, Circoviridae, Genomoviridae, Parvoviridae, Herpesviridae, Polyomaviridae, and Papillomaviridae (Fig. 2c) .",

Detailed information on all vertebrate viruses identified is presented in Table S1 in the supplemental material. (22) . RHDV is used as a biocontrol for rabbits in Australia and causes fatal hepatitis in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and some hare species (22) . Using metatranscriptomics, we detected genomes with high nucleotide and amino acid similarity (\u03fe98%) to RHDV in one of the wild devil metatranscriptomic libraries (Buckbys Road [BR]), with genome coverage of 98.1%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of the major capsid and nonstructural protein genes revealed that the RHDV detected in this study clustered with RHDV variant GI.2 (also called RHDV2) ( Fig. 3a and b) , which was first detected in Australia in May 2015 and has since become the dominant circulating variant nationwide. RHDVspecific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing confirmed the presence of RHDV2 in four of the nine devil fecal samples from the BR metatranscriptomics pool. In addition, no rabbit-associated genes were detected during the initial sequence analysis. Additional PCR targeting a short fragment of rabbit mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (\u03fd300 bp) also did not detect any rabbit DNA in the original fecal samples from BR. Further RT-PCR and sequencing performed on the fecal RNA extractions from the remaining pools confirmed the presence of RHDV in 1 of 10 devils from wukalina/Mt William National Park (wMW), two of nine devils from zoo A, and one of nine from zoo B. One of the four additional RHDV-positive samples, from zoo A, contained rabbit mtDNA as confirmed by PCR.",

In general, virion-enriched metagenomics largely detected DNA viruses, while metatranscriptomics detected both DNA and RNA viruses, although the DNA viruses detected were limited to those with relatively high abundance (Fig. 2d) . A high abundance level is often indicative of an active viral infection, during which DNA viruses are transcribed into RNA intermediates detected readily by RNA sequencing (28) . Conversely, RNA viruses identified in metatranscrip- tomics were rarely detected in virion-enriched metagenomics, even if they were highly abundant based on the RSEM estimated counts. The use of virion enrichment and sequence-independent amplification in our metagenomics approach increased the number of viral reads in each library. However, the viral compositions of all six virion-enriched metagenomes were highly skewed toward DNA viruses, particularly bacteriophage from the order Caudovirales. Similarly, in a previous study comparing various enrichment methods, bacteriophage accounted for \u03fe80% of all reads in all of the enrichment methods tested but \u03fd5% when no enrichment steps were incorporated (29) . Despite being able to substantially increase the total number of viral reads in the metagenomes, sequence-independent amplification is bias prone, resulting in fewer viruses detected and lower genome coverage due to preferential amplification of certain sequences (30) (31) (32) . However, the overrepresentation of bacteriophage here may partly be attributed to the fact that they make up the bulk of the gut virobiota, which is dominated by bacteria (33, 34) . Regardless of its known bias (29, 30) , virion-enriched metagenomics still holds merit for use in virome characterization due to its ability to identify low-abundance DNA viruses, which is especially relevant for dormant or nonactive viruses.",

Since there is no virion enrichment and less sample processing, the likelihood of biased detection is plausibly reduced in metatranscriptomics. In this study, the proportion of viral reads sequenced by metatranscriptomics was \u03fd2% per library, but the numbers of viral groups detected were significantly higher than those detected in virion-enriched metagenomics, which included both RNA and DNA viruses. Importantly, then, our results show that the taxonomic compositions of viral communities as revealed by virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were not interchangeable and neither approach was able to detect all viruses present. However, these two approaches were complementary, and an integrated approach using both virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics will be a powerful tool for obtaining a complete overview of both the taxonomic and functional profiles of viral communities in a sample.",

Both captive populations displayed lower levels of viral diversity than the wild populations. This loss of diversity is consistent with changes previously observed in the gut bacteriome, where captive devils also exhibited lower bacterial diversity compared to wild devils (11) . Changes in lifestyle and diet that occur in captivity likely impact the virome, which is similarly dynamic. Interestingly, Maria Island devils had viromes more similar to those of the captive populations. Maria Island, a 115-km 2 island off the east coast of Tasmania (Fig. 1) , is home to approximately 100 free-ranging devils. Two factors may have contributed to the lower viral diversity observed on Maria Island. First, due to its isolation from mainland Tasmania, animal movements or immigrations are limited to only marine or bird species, and nonendemic species diversity is lower. Thus, there may be limited introduction of viruses to the island. Second, captive-born devils may be more likely to have a \"captive-type\" virome, that is, lower viral diversity than wild devils. Indeed, some devils included in this study are captive-born animals recently translocated to Maria Island. As samples were pooled prior to sequencing, it was not possible to distinguish between viromes of captive-born and wild-born devils.",

It is also important to note that some of these viruses may in fact be dietary viruses, with no active replication in devils, or may occur naturally as part of the normal gut flora of Tasmanian devils. For example, in some areas of Tasmania, rabbits are common and likely ingested by wild devils, which might explain the presence of RHDV2 in wild devils. They are also regularly fed to devils in captivity. Feeding records provided by the two zoos in this study confirmed the feeding of rabbits to some of the sampled devils around the time of fecal collection. While we did not detect rabbit genes by metatranscriptomics, virion-enriched metagenomics, or PCR in any of the wild devil samples that tested positive for RHDV, we did detect rabbit mtDNA in the feces of one captive devil from zoo A that tested positive for RHDV by PCR. Targeted investigations such as PCR of blood or internal tissues (i.e., liver), in situ hybridization, and serological assays are required to determine whether these viruses can actively replicate and cause disease in devils or are simply gut contaminants. Nevertheless, exposure to host-adapted viruses could pose significant health threats, especially for devils that are immunocompromised due to old age, DFTD, or other concurrent diseases (36, 37) . Furthermore, even commensal or latent viral infections can be exacerbated or reactivated in immunocompromised hosts (38, 39) .",

Generally, long-term relationships between viruses and hosts are expected for mammalian viruses (13) . Strong evidence for this lies in the observation that devil viruses are usually clustered with other marsupial viruses, as a marsupial-specific lineage that is distinct from the eutherian viruses, as observed in herpesvirus, papillomavirus (45, 46) , and polyomavirus ( Fig. S1 to S5) . Furthermore, in several cases the branching order of viruses broadly reflects that of their hosts such that a general codivergence can be inferred. For instance, in the phylogenies of Picornaviridae and Astroviridae, the Tasmanian devil-associated (marsupial) viruses formed a sister clade to eutherian viruses, which, in turn, are sister to avian viruses, consistent with the evolutionary history of the host. Although such a relationship is not observed in every virus phylogeny, a deep divergence between eutherian and marsupial viruses is typical of our data set. This observation indicates that the timescale of virus evolution is very likely to reflect that of the hosts (13) .",

Resulting contigs were compared against the nonredundant nucleotide and protein databases on GenBank using BLASTN and BLASTX, respectively, with an E value cutoff at 1E\u03ea5. BLASTX searching was also conducted against a bespoke database containing all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein reference sequences downloaded from GenBank. Taxonomic information at the domain level (i.e., Eukarya, Bacteria, or Archaea), as well as for viruses, was assigned based first on the BLASTN results and then on the BLASTX results. Potential virus-related sequences were further categorized into families and orders based on their genetic similarity to their closest relatives and/or their phylogenetic positions. Similarly, assignment of viruses to the broader groups of their hosts (i.e., Eukarya, Bacteria, or Archaea) was based on their phylogenetic relationship to viruses with reliable host information obtained either using experimental or phylogenetic approaches. The genetic identity cutoff for host assignment was 40% based on the most conserved proteins, such as RdRp or DNA polymerases (50) . The threshold was set based on the intrafamily diversity of most vertebrate-specific virus families/genera (13) . The assignment of vertebrate host was based on phylogenetic analyses, in which a potential devil-associated virus is expected to either cluster within, or form a sister group to, an existing mammalian virus group.",

Statistical significance of differences in alpha diversity was evaluated by the Monte Carlo method (999 permutations), with a null hypothesis that diversity is equal in all libraries with a significance threshold of \u2423 \u03ed 0.05. Levels of viral abundance were also used to produce heatmaps and dendrograms from hierarchical clustering.
