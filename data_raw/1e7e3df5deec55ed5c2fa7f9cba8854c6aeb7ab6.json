All adults aged \u226515 years with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) admitted to a provincial hospital from September 2009 to August 2010 were enrolled in the study. Patients were classified into CAP and non-pneumonic LRTI (NPLRTI) according to the radiological findings. Bacterial pathogens were identified from sputum samples by the conventional culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; 13 respiratory viruses were identified from nasopharyngeal specimens by PCR.",

Older age, the presence of underlying respiratory conditions, and higher index score of smoking were associated with CAP. The one-year estimated incidence of hospitalised adult CAP in our study population was 0.81 per 1,000 person years. The incidence increased considerably with age and was highest among the elderly. The case fatality proportion of hospitalised CAP patients was 9.8%. Among 286 sputum samples tested for bacterial PCR, 79 (28%) were positive for H. influenzae, and 65 (23%) were positive for S. pneumoniae. Among 357 samples tested for viral PCR, 73 (21%) were positive for respiratory viruses; influenza A (n = 32, 9%) was the most common. Conclusions: The current adult CAP incidence in Vietnam was relatively low; this result was mainly attributed to the young age of our study population.",

            "text": "Our study revealed that the one-year estimated incidence of hospitalised CAP among adults aged \u226515 years in Central Vietnam was 0.8 per 1,000 PY. This figure was, in fact, lower than that of similar studies with chest X-ray-confirmed pneumonia in the Western world, such as studies in the USA (patients aged > 45 years: 16 per 1,000 PY vs. 1.8 per 1,000 PY in our study) [24] , in Spain (patients aged \u226515 years: 1.2-1.6 per 1,000 PY vs. 0.8 per 1,000 PY) [4, 6] , in Germany (patients aged \u226518 years: 3.7 per 1,000 PY) [25] , and in Finland (patients aged \u2265 50 years: 6.3 per 1,000 PY vs. 2.1 in our study aged \u2265 50 years) [26] . Several factors explain this difference. First, the definition of pneumonia varies by study [25] . Certain studies used chest X-ray findings to determine pneumonia [4, 6, 26] , whereas others used clinically defined criteria or simply relied on reported cases at the sentinel sites [24, 25] . In our study, we carefully defined pneumonia using stringent criteria based on chest X-ray findings; with these criteria, only 45% of clinically diagnosed LRTIs exhibited consolidation on chest X-rays. Thus, our figures are conservative estimates. Second, our study targeted hospitalised CAP and did not include cases treated at the outpatient department or at neighbouring clinics. Since our hospital is only tertiary hospital in this area, there was a concern that only severe cases were admitted to this hospital. However, the proportions of mild cases with PSI classes I or II and CURB65 score 0 or 1 were similar to those reported by Capelastegui (CURB65 0-1 69.8%, incidence of CRP 3.1 per 1,000PY) [27] and Guti\u00e9rrez (PSI classes I and II 54.2%, incidence of CAP 1.2 per 1,000PY) [6] . We therefore believe that a selective bias towards severe patients is not a major factor explaining the low incidence rate although we need to collect the information about health care seeking behaviour within the community to determine the actual incidence of CAP. Third, the age distribution is substantially different; the proportion of the elderly in Vietnam is lower than those in Western counties. Although the one-year estimated incidence of CAP in Spain was higher than our estimates, their age group-specific incidences were compatible with our estimates: 0.7, 1.1, 2.4, and 5.3 per 1,000 PY for the age groups of 15-44, 45-64, 65-74, and over 75 years, respectively [6] . This finding indicates that the relatively low one-year incidence of CAP was mainly attributable to differences in the population structures. A similar large-scale study conducted in Thailand also showed a slightly higher incidence, but that study included children under 5 years old with a very high incidence rate of pneumonia [12] .",

Whereas S. pneumoniae was detected in 25% of samples, which is comparable with the results of other studies showing positivity of 9 to 48% [11] , the proportion of positivity for H. influenzae (28%) in our study was substantially higher than previously reported: 2.7-6% in Sweden, Spain, and Thailand [14, 28, 29] . This difference may be because we used molecular techniques. There were some discrepancies between bacterial culture and PCR; more positive results were observed in PCR than culture but this tendency was compatible with previously published reports [15, 30] . PCR methods are known to detect pathogens even just a few days after being exposed to antibiotics, which is difficult to detect with conventional bacterial culture [15] . We believe that molecular techniques are more appropriate for pathogen surveys because the results are less affected by preexposure to antibiotics. It is generally difficult to distinguish bacteria colonised in the oral cavity from bacteria as a causative pathogen. Quality assessment of sputum samples is therefore important; Gram staining can provide supplementary information. In this study, we simultaneously performed Gram staining and assessed the quality of sputum samples. Unfortunately, obtaining good quality sputum was found to be difficult. Only 11% turned out to be 4 or 5 in Geckler's category. The proportion of positive samples and the pattern of pathogens did not significantly differ between good quality samples and those with lower quality. Furthermore, preceding antibiotic use might have affected the sensitivity of bacterial culture results. Although the clinical specimens were collected before the administration of antibiotics in the hospital, one-fourth of the patients in our study took antibiotics purchased at a local pharmacy prior to their admission. When all of these factors are considered, careful interpretation of the aetiology results is necessary.",

This value is comparable with the results of other studies from European countries, which showed that 12-32% of hospitalised CAP patients were viral positive [31] [32] [33] . Influenza A and HRV are the leading pathogens of childhood acute respiratory infections, but positivity for these viruses was much lower in adults [12, [32] [33] [34] . Recent evidence indicates that HRV can cause pneumonia in very young children and in severely immunocompromised patients, but the role of HRV in pneumonia among immunocompetent adults remains controversial [32, 34] . Although our finding could not confirm lower respiratory infection with HRV, the high prevalence of HRV detected from nasopharynx samples in adult CAP cases suggests the involvement of HRV as a cause of pneumonia [34] . RSV is also not uncommon in the adult population, as Falsey reported that RSV infection accounted for 11% of pneumonia among elderly and atrisk adults in the winter season in the USA [35] . In our study, RSV positives accounted for 6% of hospitalised CAP patients during the RSV season, July to November in Central Vietnam [16] .",

While some similar studies in other regions excluded immuno-suppressed patients [29] or restricted to previously well patients [18] , others did not exclude these patients [4, 6, 12, 24, 26] . Our concern was that the regional variation in the prevalence of HIV infection could affect the incidence of pneumonia. However, even excluded these patients the incidence of CAP was not changed much (0.81/1,000 population-year, 95%CI 0.71-0.91). The aetiology of pneumonia amongst patients with HIV/AIDS may differ, but because of limited laboratory resource, we couldn't test for additional pathogens like P.jirovecci, cytomegarovirus or criptococcus. In one HIV positive case, co-infection of S. pneumoniae and adenovirus was detected by bacterial culture and viral PCR. One single H. influenzae infection, two single S. pneumoniae infections and one co-infection with S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were detected from bacterial PCR, and no pathogen was detected from the other 3 cases. Thus the aetiology in HIV infected cases was not apparently different from those without HIV infection.",

This situation was mainly due to certain pneumonia patients who were un-diagnosed on admission, and this tendency was particularly observed in elderly patients, who often lacked symptoms of acute respiratory infection on admission. We therefore identified all hospitalised CAP using the admission records and went on to estimate the incidence, adjusting for enrolment. In the current study, we had to make an assumption that the proportion of X-ray confirmed CAP was same in the whole cases of ICD-10 code pneumonia. This assumption may not be true but we could not review chest X-rays amongst Figure 5 The predicted number of adult CAP patients in Vietnam in 2009, 2020, and 2030. The age-group specific number of CAP patients was estimated using the predicted population number [7] and our age group-specific incidence estimates. retrospectively identified ICD-10 coded pneumonia cases, because their chest X-rays were kept by patients, not stored in the hospital. The difficulty still remains in distinguishing nosocomial pneumonia from CAP in ICD-10 coded pneumonia cases. However, the length of hospital stay amongst patients with nosocomial pneumonia is expected to be longer than those with CAP [38] . The similarity of the length in our study groups indicates that the majority of ICD-10 coded pneumonia cases were not nosocomial pneumonia. Another limitation comes from difficulties in collecting good-quality sputum specimens, as was discussed above.",

This observation indicates that the disease burden will rapidly increase as the population gets older. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Vietnamese elderly population (persons aged \u2265 65 years) will reach 11 million (11%) in 2030, which is almost double the 2009 percentage [7] . According to our estimates, the annual number of hospitalised adult CAP patients in all of Vietnam will increase from 2009 to 2030 by 55% in people aged \u226515 years and by 79% in those aged \u2265 65 years ( Figure 5 ). Early intervention, such as vaccination against S. pneumoniae and influenza for the adult population, is warranted to address this foreseeable problem in Vietnam and other countries in SEA.",
