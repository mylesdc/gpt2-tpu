To address this issue, we primed BALB/c mice either intranasally (i.n.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) with varying doses of wild type (WT) human adenovirus subtype 5 (HAd5). Following the development of immunity against HAd5, we immunized animals via the i.n. or i.m. route of inoculation with a HAd vector (HAd-HA-NP) expressing the hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein (NP) of A/Vietnam/1203/ 04 (H5N1) influenza virus. The immunogenicity and protection results suggest that low levels of vector immunity (,520 virus-neutralization titer) induced by priming mice with up to 10 7 plaque forming units (p.f.u.) of HAd-WT did not adversely impact the protective efficacy of the vaccine. Furthermore, high levels of vector immunity (approximately 1500 virusneutralization titer) induced by priming mice with 10 8 p.f.u. of HAd-WT were overcome by either increasing the vaccine dose or using alternate routes of vaccination. A further increase in the priming dose to 10 9 p.f.u. allowed only partial protection. These results suggest possible strategies to overcome the variable levels of human immunity against adenoviruses, leading to better utilization of HAd vector-based vaccines.",

Their ubiquitous nature results in the development of Ad-specific neutralizing antibodies, popularly known as 'preexisting vector immunity' in the majority of the individuals [13] [14] [15] . Adneutralizing antibodies inhibit the vector extracellularly, while Ad-specific CD8+ T cells destroy vector expressing cells [16, 17] thereby adversely impacting the duration and levels of transgene expression. Experimental studies in animal models have shown that in the presence of extremely high levels of Ad-neutralizing antibodies, there is a significant inhibition in the development of immunogen-specific immune responses [18] . A comprehensive analysis of Ad seroprevalence found that HAd5 neutralizing antibody titers in the study's participants varied by geographic location and ranged from 18 to 4690 [19] . According to this study, 26% of the participants had titers below 200, 40% had titers below 1000, and 20% exhibited titers greater than 1000. These studies have underscored the need to further evaluate the role of vector immunity in inhibiting the immunogenicity and efficacy of HAd vector-based vaccines.",

Increasing the vaccine dose by five-fold resulted in further improvement in HI titers in mice immunized either i.n. (52) or i.m. (80) indicating that the i.n.-induced (which mimics the natural route of infection in humans) vector immunity can be partially overcome by increasing the vaccine dose (P#0.05). However, in the 10 9 i.m. HAd-primed groups immunized with HAd-HA-NP, a HI titer of 30 was induced, and there were no significant changes in the titers by either alternating the route of vaccine inoculation or with an increased vaccine dose. These results indicate that the levels of vector immunity induced by i.m. priming with 10 9 p.f.u. of HAd5-WT negatively impact the development of a humoral immune response against a HAd vector-based vaccine.",

It has been suggested that the route of vaccination impacts the magnitude, phenotype and trafficking of antigen-specific CD8 T cells in mice [29, 30] . A HAdbased HIV vaccine also showed some inhibition in eliciting immunogen-specific immune responses in the presence of vector immunity, however, this effect was minimized by increasing the vaccine dose [31] . Nevertheless, in a clinical trial with a HAdbased influenza vaccine, there were no strong correlations between vector immunity levels and a decrease in vaccine efficacy [25] . The inhibitory effect of vector immunity was more pronounced for the humoral immune response compared to the CMI response which is consistent with previous reports [32] [33] [34] . Taken together, our data clearly show that the magnitude of humoral and cellular immune responses to Ad-vectored vaccine antigens depend upon the levels of preexisting antibodies against the vector. However, vector-specific immune responses can be overcome by increasing the antigen dose or by administering antigen by a different route. In conclusion, based on the present study alone, it will be difficult to predict the range of the vector immunity in humans that can be tolerated or overcome by either increasing the dose or changing the route of administration of the HAd5 vector-based vaccines. Nevertheless, the study does highlight the importance of exploring these strategies in humans to improve the outcome of HAd5 vector-based vaccines.",

The polybasic cleavage site QRERRRKKRQG present in the HA gene of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) influenza virus was modified to QRETRQG to reduce the rare possibility of genetic exchange between the HA in HAd-HA-NP vaccine and a circulating strains of influenza A virus. The full-length coding region of NP gene of the A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) virus under control of the murine CMV promoter and the SV40 polyA was similarly inserted into the E1 region of the HAd genome. Both genes in HAd-HA-NP were in the E1-parallel orientation. The recombinant virus was plaque purified, and its genome was analyzed by restriction enzyme digestions to confirm the presence of HA and NP gene cassettes and the absence of any other major deletion or insertion. Na\u00efve or HAd5-primed mice were immunized as described in the Materials and Methods. At four weeks after final immunization, animals were euthanized, and the spleens were collected. Single cell suspensions were prepared by passage through screens, and 1610 6 cells were cultured in the presence of HA-518 or NP-147 peptide on anti-interferon-c antibody-coated 96-well filter plates and developed according to an ELISpot protocol. Splenocytes cultured in presence of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin served as positive controls in each group. The ELISpot plates were read using a Bioreader 5000 ( ",

The serum HI titers in 10 7 HAd-primed groups (i.n. or i.m.) immunized with the vaccine were 1.5-2 fold lower than the na\u00efve immunized groups indicating that HAd-preexisting antibodies affected the induction of humoral immune response following immunization with HAd-HA-NP. In the 10 8 i.n. HAd-primed group, i.n. immunization with HAd-HA-NP induced lower serum HI titers (22) compared to the group immunized i.m. with HAd-HA-NP (80). Interestingly, an increase in the vaccine dose by five-fold resulted in significant (P#0.05) enhancement of serum HI titers in mice immunized either i.n. (91) or i.m. (105).

These groups were referred to as HAdprimed groups. The unprimed (na\u00efve) mice were similarly inoculated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Four weeks after priming, mice were bled by retro-orbital puncture to evaluate the development of HAd-specific neutralizing antibody titers. HAd-primed and na\u00efve (PBS-inoculated) mice were subsequently immunized twice (4 weeks apart) with 1610 8 or 5610 8 p.f.u. of HAd-HA-NP vaccine by either the i.m. or i.n. route. Additional groups of HAd-primed mice were similarly immunized with 5610 8 p.f.u. of HAd-DE1E3 (vector control) to serve as negative controls.Four weeks after final immunization, blood samples were collected through retro-orbital puncture to evaluate the development of HA-specific antibodies. Five animals from each group were euthanized to collect the spleen cells to evaluate the induction of HA-and NP-specific CMI responses. The remaining mice from each group were challenged with 100-fold of 50% mouse infectious dose (MID 50 ) of a reverse genetics derived A/Puerto Rico/8/ 1934(H1N1) [PR8] containing HA and NA gene fragments of A/ Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) [VNH5N1-PR8/CDC-RG] [24] . Since this reassortant virus is not lethal and does not produce clinical disease and weight loss in mice, protection efficacy was monitored by viral clearance in the lungs. Three days post-challenge, mice were euthanized, and the lungs were collected to determine viral titers to evaluate protective efficacy. Briefly, thawed lung tissues were homogenized in 1 ml of sterile PBS. These lung homogenates were then titrated in 10-day-old embryonated eggs in a 10-fold dilution, and positive eggs were identified by hemagglutination of horse red blood cells with allantoic fluid. Values were expressed as log10 EID50/ml 6 SEM. The limit of virus detection was set as 1.5 log10 EID50/ml [39] . The NP genes are fairly conserved between A/Vietnam/1203-04 (in the Ad vector) and A/PR8/34 (the backbone of the challenge virus); there is 93% identity at the amino acid level and 85% identity at the nucleotide level. One of the major CD8 T cell epitopes (NP147) is 100% conserved in between A/Vietnam/1203-04 and A/PR8/34.",
