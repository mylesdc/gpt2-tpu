HRVs are a well established cause of the common cold, an upper respiratory illness characterized by rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough, sore throat and sneezing; more than half of upper respiratory illnesses are caused by HRVs [4] . Recently, several studies have suggested that HRVs may be associated with more severe illness, including hospitalized lower respiratory disease and asthma exacerbations [5, 6] [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] . Also, some studies suggest that infection with HRV-C may result in more severe illness compared to illness with other species [1, 2, 16, 17] .",

The reported prevalence of HRV detection among asymptomatic persons ranges from 12-22% among children and 9% among adults with immunocompromising conditions [19, 20, 21, 22] . Consequently, the clinical relevance of detection of HRV among hospitalized patients can be difficult to interpret and better studies are needed to ascertain the role of HRVs as pathogens to spur efforts to develop treatment and prevention modalities. To that end, we took advantage of a study in rural Thailand that concurrently enrolled hospitalized patients with acute lower respiratory illness, a sample of outpatients with influenza-like illness, and control outpatients without fever or respiratory symptoms from the same hospitals to better define the etiologic role of HRV infection and associated disease burden in this community.",

Enrollment occurred in all 8 hospitals in Sa Kaeo province. A patient was eligible for enrollment if he/she had at least one sign of acute infection (e.g. fever, abnormal white blood cell count) plus signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease (e.g. cough, abnormal breath sounds) and the physician ordered a chest radiograph within 48 hours of admission. Each enrolled patient had a nasopharyngeal swab, acute and convalescent serum, and demographic information collected.

Each outpatient participant had a nasopharyngeal swab and demographic information collected. During the second study year, September 1, 2004-August 31, 2005, we collected nasopharyngeal swabs and demographic information from control outpatients (i.e., patients who did not have a fever, and did not report a fever, cough, sore throat or diarrhea within the previous 3 days) from the outpatient clinics as described above. We sought to enroll the same number of controls from five age groups (#2 yrs, 3-5 yrs, 6-15 yrs, 16-54 yrs, and $55 yrs) during each month of the year, (median number/month for all controls = 25, range .",

All specimens were tested by a laboratory blinded to patient status, e.g., hospitalized, outpatient, or control. Nasopharyngeal specimens were tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) 1, 2, and 3, influenza viruses A and B, adenovirus, Legionella species, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumonia, and rhinovirus/enterovirus (Table S1 ). HRV was detected from respiratory specimens by first testing with RT-PCR primers to detect rhinovirus/enterovirus as described in Roghmann, et al [26] . To discriminate between HRVs and human enteroviruses, PCR positive samples were retrospectively subjected to a second round of semi-nested PCR using HRV-specific primers as described in Miller, et al. [11] . Viral isolation was performed for RSV, HPIV, influenza viruses and adenovirus. Paired sera was tested for RSV, HMPV, HPIV 1,2 and 3, adenovirus, influenza, Legionella sp., Chlamydia penumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae as described [23, 27] . For HRV, a positive RT-PCR result was considered a positive result. For other pathogens, a positive culture, RT-PCR, or four-fold rise in serology was considered a positive test result. Serologic testing and PCR assays for Legionella sp., Chlamydia penumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were only performed on patients enrolled during the first study year, September 2003-August 31, 2004 and interpreted as previously described [27] . In addition, diagnostic testing included urine pneumococcal surface antigen assay among pneumonia patients aged $18 years. HRV positive samples from hospitalized and control patients during September 1, 2004 through August 31, 2005 were further identified to species by RT-PCR and sequencing of partial region of the VP1 (D. Erdman, unpublished, method available on request). Specimens that were VP1 negative were further tested using primers that amplified partial VP4/VP2 or 59NCR regions [28] .",

Our results differ from a recently publicized study of hospitalized children aged ,5 years in Thailand that reported HRV-C as more common than HRV-A among children in all age groups during 2007 [30] .

Hospitalized adults were 4-fold more likely to have HRV detected compared to controls; less than five percent of control adults had HRV detections. In addition, the rates of HRV detection among adults $50 years of age with radiographically-confirmed pneumonia with and without co-detection of another pathogen were similar to rates for detection of influenza viruses and S. pneumonia [23] . Approximately, 8% of radiographically-confirmed pneumonias among adults $20 years of age were associated with HRV detection (without another pathogen detected). Our HRV detection results are similar to those reported from a one year cohort study of hospitalized adults with community-acquired pneumonia in New Zealand [12] . Also, several reports have found an association with HRV detection and asthma exacerbation [5, 14, 22, 31] . Thus, treatment or prevention modalities for HRV might reduce the significant morbidity associated with HRVassociated asthma and adult lower respiratory tract hospitalization.",

However, this age group also had a high frequency of HRV detections among young control children without respiratory symptoms or fever. Thus, our rates may not reflect the actual burden of HRV-associated illness among hospitalized pediatric patients; we cannot differentiate those children who were hospitalized with HRV-associated illness versus those that may not have had symptoms due to HRV despite HRV shedding. Several reports suggest that young children shed HRVs for more than one week [19, 20, 22] . Therefore, it is possible that HRV detection among ill or non-ill children might be from a previous illness. We did not ask controls about illness more than three days previously or follow them to see if they became ill, and no hospitalized patients were asked about prior illness unrelated to the hospitalization. Also, the presence of rhinorrhea was not an exclusion criterion for controls and was not recorded; recording rhinorrhea and previous history of illness would improve the useful of this type of control. Thus, while patients with HRV detections were associated with hospitalized lower respiratory tract illness, it is not possible to determine the actual number or burden of HRVassociated illnesses among pediatric patients. Additional studies, especially those with a longitudinally followed cohort, are needed to better characterize HRV-associated illness among hospitalized children.",

These proportions are similar to other reports [4] . In addition, previously we reported co-detection of human bocavirus and coronaviruses with HRV during the second study year [32, 33] but did not include them in this analysis due to their uncertain association with hospitalized illness. Our results support the identification, and probable exclusion, of infection with other known respiratory pathogens as important for evaluating illness possibly associated with HRV. Our results are limited by some potential biases. We did not enroll hospitalized patients who met the clinical case definition for acute lower respiratory illness but did not have a chest radiograph ordered within 48 hours of admission or who presented with other clinical syndromes, including those with exacerbations of underlying disease. Patients with acute lower respiratory illness who did not get a chest radiograph tended to be younger and possibly less seriously ill (i.e., fewer intubations and fatalities) (HC Baggett, person. comm.). Some patients with acute lower respiratory illness who did not get a chest radiograph may have had illness due to HRV; thus, our incidence estimates for hospitalized HRV-associated illness may be underestimated. Although only 45% of eligible patients were enrolled, we found few differences in clinical characteristics between those who were enrolled compared to those who were not enrolled.",
