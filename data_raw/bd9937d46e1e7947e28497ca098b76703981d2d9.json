Aim: We evaluated the impact of an infectious disease specialist (IDS) on implementing an ASP in a resource-limited setting in Korea. Methods: A retrospective study was performed at a NAC hospital between June 2015 and August 2018. An IDS has led an ASP at the hospital since June 2017. We used an interrupted time series analysis to evaluate longitudinal effects of the IDS-led ASP on the amount of antibiotic use and incidence of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) acquisition. Findings: Total antibiotic use changed from 698.82 \u00b1 74.41 to 602.09 \u00b1 69.94 defined daily dose/1000 patient-days (PDs) after intervention. An immediate reduction in the use of carbapenems, glycopeptides, penicillins, and other antibiotics followed the IDS-led ASP. The 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins and carbapenems prescription rates decreased in slope after the intervention. Incidence of MDRO acquisition changed from 1.38, 0.78, and 0.21/1000 PDs to 1.06, 0.15, and 0.32/1000 PDs in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. The incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii acquisition immediately decreased following intervention. Conclusion: An IDS can implement a successful ASP by reducing antibiotic consumption and MDRO acquisition at resource-limited NAC hospitals.",

This study divided the time series into two segments, preand post-intervention. We used segmented regression analysis to assess the longitudinal effect of the IDS-led ASP. Parameters used in segmented regression analysis were defined as follows. The level was considered the value of a measure at the beginning of a time segment. The trend was considered the rate of change for the measure during the given time interval. The level change after intervention was considered the average value of change after intervention, reflecting the immediate effect of the intervention. The trend change after intervention was considered to be the change in slope during the period after intervention, constituting a gradual change during the segment.

Other studies have also reported that hospital size is not important in predicting the amount of antibiotic use [18, 19] . Given these findings, regardless of bed size or medical school affiliation, all hospitals should be required to implement ASPs. However, the majority of Korean NAC hospitals still do not have these programs because of insufficient human, financial, and information technology resources as compared with large, academic medical centers. For example, a pharmacist should be involved in an ASP; however, most Korean NAC hospitals do not have a staff member with drug expertise as one of the core elements for a successful hospital ASP [20] . In addition, although NAC hospitals do implement ASPs, there are barriers to the success of these programs. First, a large proportion of patients in NAC hospitals come from long-term care facilities; therefore, they are likely to suffer from recurrent aspiration pneumonia or severe decubitus ulcers, which result in an increased chance of antibiotic use [21] . Second, compared to in large academic hospitals, reducing antibiotic use, especially well-reimbursed drugs, may not be financially beneficial in NAC hospitals [12] .

In these studies, ASPs have also been proven to reduce antibiotic use, lower medical costs, and improve antibiotic susceptibilities to specific pathogens [24] [25] [26] [27] . Even though IDSs spent much less time on the ASP than that in our study, they demonstrated successful results after implementation of ASP. However, key differences exist in our study compared to these other studies. First, most of the hospitals had pharmacists who were dedicated to the ASP and facilitated the intervention, but we did not have a pharmacist as a member of the ASP team because of the lack of available pharmacists in Korean NAC hospitals. Second, it takes less time to develop and maintain an ASP in smaller hospitals. Stenehjem et al. [12] reported that the average time spent on the ASP is 5-10 hours per week in hospitals with 70-150 beds. In contrast, in our study the IDS was required to work full time in the hospital, which has 402 beds, and dedicate the most time to ASP activities. In addition, a low volume of patients and staff members means that once IDS-led ASPs are well established in smaller NAC hospitals, we can expect more rapid effects and better compliance than in larger NAC hospitals. Therefore, we think that this study, conducted in moderate-sized, resource-limited NAC hospital, is worthwhile.",

Several studies have shown strong evidence suggesting that an effective ASP can reduce the prevalence of AMR, as well as antibiotic use [10, [28] [29] [30] . Our study also shows that an IDS-led ASP can effect a reduction in AMR. We evaluated the incidence of MRSA, MDRAB, and MDRPA acquisition as indicators of AMR. In Korea, these pathogens are not only isolated frequently in clinical specimens, but also cause relevant infections in clinical practice. About 66% of Staphylococcus aureus has methicillin resistance, and the carbapenem resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are 85% and 35%, respectively [31] . However, we were unable to evaluate the incidence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), because there were few cases of hospital-acquired CRE in the facility studied. Most CRE cases were confirmed in specimens collected prior to 48 h after admission.",

However, this factor is unlikely to affect our results. The IDS spent some time meeting with the infection control team-which had been in existence and was doing well in the hospital before he arrived-to implement infection control activities. There was no significant change in the methods of the infection control program. For example, the main strategy for hand hygiene was education, monitoring, and feedback during the study period, and the performance rate was maintained at 81.3% to 88.4%. Another limitation was the immediate increase in the incidence of MDRPA acquisition despite a significant decrease in carbapenem use. A previous study showed that reduced carbapenem use was associated with a decrease in carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [28] , although we did not observe the same results. However, although there was no statistical significance, incidence of MDRPA acquisition had decreased in slope following the intervention.",
