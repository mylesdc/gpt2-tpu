Unexpectedly, multiple oral fluid samples and one fecal sample were tested positive for PDCoV (the Ct value ranged between 34 and 39) by duplex PEDV and PDCoV real-time RT-PCR (see Technical Appendix). However, no clinical diarrhea or other signs were observed among pigs on the index farm, which prompted us to further investigate the source of positive PCR results. Since the pigs were housed in hoop-style buildings with uncontrolled access for wild bird entry and congregation, fecal samples were also collected from 10 sparrows found inside the pig barn (ISU690-1 to \u221210) and were submitted to our laboratory for testing in January 2017, along with 8 feed samples (ISU690-11 to \u221218). Surprisingly, 9/10 fecal samples were positive using PCR targeting the PDCoV N gene, with a Ct of 26.3-37.3, while all 8 feed samples were negative. Four additional sparrow fecal samples (ISU42824-1 to \u22124) collected in June 2017 from the same farm were tested, and one of the samples (ISU42824-3) was positive by PDCoV N gene-based PCR, with a Ct of 23.6.",

To exclude the possible issue of contamination of sparrow fecal samples with porcine samples, all fecal samples directly collected from swine were tested and were negative for both SDCoV and SpDCoV.

In contrast, the four SpDCoV strains share a significantly lower identity to sparrow CoV HKU17 (58.2-58.6%) than to three PDCoV strains (82.7-87.7%) in their S protein (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S2 ).

These findings were also confirmed by phylogenetic tree analysis of amino-acid sequences in which the four SpDCoV strains clustered together and were closely related to PDCoV and sparrow CoV HKU17 strains in ORF1ab, E, M, and N trees ( Fig. 1c and Supplementary Figure S1 ). However, the four SpDCoV strains were close to PDCoV but distant from sparrow CoV HKU17 in the S tree (Fig. 1d) . In the case of non-structural proteins (NS6, NS7a, and NS7b), the SpDCoV strains share a high amino-acid identity with each other. However, SpDCoV ISU690-4/7 has 76.2% and 79% identity to ISU73347 and ISU42824, respectively, in NS7c, which is much lower than the 97.2% identity shared between ISU73347 and ISU42824 (Supplementary Table S3 ). An 18-nt deletion in the NS7c gene of ISU690-4 and -7 resulted in a protein that was 6 amino acids shorter than that of ISU73347 and ISU42824 in length (Supplementary Figure S2) .

Therefore, PDCoV real-time RT-PCR can cross-react with SpDCoV, which complicates the molecular detection of PDCoV. It is plausible that contamination with sparrow feces containing SpDCoVs caused non-specific positive results for PDCoV when the oral fluid and fecal samples collected from clinical healthy pigs were tested using PEDV/PDCoV duplex RT-PCR. This also raises a concern regarding the specificity of detecting PDCoV from environmental and environmentally contaminated samples. To avoid the cross-reaction issue, further modification of the primers and probe for PDCoV real-time RT-PCR is needed. PDCoV, as a causative agent for pig diarrhea, has been reported in many countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Mainland China, and Laos, indicating that PDCoV is widespread in pig populations. However, all known PDCoVs to date have been relatively conserved and shared 97.1-99.9% nucleotide identity at the whole genome level. In contrast, the SpDCoV strains identified in the present study (ISU690-4/7, ISU42824, and ISU73347) as well as one previously identified sparrow CoV strain, HKU17-6124, exhibited higher genetic diversity (82.1-93.9% nucleotide identity at the whole-genome level). Further studies to understand the genetic diversity of SpDCoV by sequencing more SpDCoV strains are warranted. Another important finding is that, due to the relative conservation between PDCoV and SpDCoV N gene sequences in some regions, the PDCoV N gene-based PCR used in this study can cross-react with SpDCoV. Thus, PDCoV PCR results should be interpreted carefully when pig samples that can be contaminated by bird feces or other excretions are tested. The SpDCoV sequence data reported in this study may help determine the evolutionary relationship of various DCoVs and help to understand the interspecies transmission of DCoVs in future studies.",
