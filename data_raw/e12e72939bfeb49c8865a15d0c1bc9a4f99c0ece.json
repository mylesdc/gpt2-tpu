            "text": "Rotaviruses are the leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in children worldwide. Rotavirus-induced immune responses, especially the T and B cell responses, have been extensively characterized; however, little is known about innate immune mechanisms involved in the control of rotavirus infection. Although increased levels of systemic type I interferon (IFNa and b) correlate with accelerated resolution of rotavirus disease, multiple rotavirus strains, including rhesus rotavirus (RRV), have been demonstrated to antagonize type I IFN production in a variety of epithelial and fibroblast cell types through several mechanisms, including degradation of multiple interferon regulatory factors by a viral nonstructural protein. This report demonstrates that stimulation of highly purified primary human peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with either live or inactivated RRV induces substantial IFNa production by a subset of pDCs in which RRV does not replicate. Characterization of pDC responses to viral stimulus by flow cytometry and Luminex revealed that RRV replicates in a small subset of human primary pDCs and, in this RRV-permissive small subset, IFNa production is diminished. pDC activation and maturation were observed independently of viral replication and were enhanced in cells in which virus replicates. Production of IFNa by pDCs following RRV exposure required viral dsRNA and surface proteins, but neither viral replication nor activation by trypsin cleavage of VP4. These results demonstrate that a minor subset of purified primary human peripheral pDCs are permissive to RRV infection, and that pDCs retain functionality following RRV stimulus. Additionally, this study demonstrates trypsin-independent infection of primary peripheral cells by rotavirus, which may allow for the establishment of extraintestinal viremia and antigenemia. Importantly, these data provide the first evidence of IFNa induction in primary human pDCs by a dsRNA virus, while simultaneously demonstrating impaired IFNa production in primary human cells in which RRV replicates. Rotavirus infection of primary human pDCs provides a powerful experimental system for the study of mechanisms underlying pDC-mediated innate immunity to viral infection and reveals a potentially novel dsRNA-dependent pathway of IFNa induction.",

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs), a highly specialized subset of professional antigen-presenting cells, play a central role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immunity. There are two known major subsets of primary human and murine circulating DCs: myeloid DCs, which function principally in antigen presentation, and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), which secrete the type I interferons (IFN), IFNa and IFNb [1] , as well as a variety of other cytokines and chemokines. Viral induction of type I IFN expression has been well studied in recent years and has been shown to be mediated by multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene (MDA)5, toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR7 and TLR9. PRR expression is restricted in pDCs, with only TLR7 and TLR9 implicated in viral-induced IFNa production through the recognition of single-stranded (ss)RNA or DNA, respectively [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . IFNa production by pDCs is also observed following TLR7/8 stimulus with synthetic resiquimods and imiquimods, or TLR9 antagonism by CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). pDCs are not generally thought to be able to respond to double-stranded (ds)RNA, as stimulation with poly I:C or long (500 base pairs) dsRNA molecules fail to elicit IFNa or upregulate activation or maturation markers, such as CD86 and CD83 [10, 11, 12] . However, low levels of IFNa production have been reported following pDC stimulation with poly A:U [13] or in vitro transcribed viral dsRNA [11] , and a recent report indicates a role for RIG-I-like helicases in recognizing replicating virus in murine pDCs lacking the IFN receptor [14] . Short interfering dsRNAs have also been demonstrated to elicit an IFNa response through TLR7, although this appears dependent on a specific sequence, and not on the dsRNA structure [12] .",

The outer layer of the virion is composed of the VP7 glycoprotein and proteasesensitive VP4 spikes [31] . Although both triple-and doublelayered particles (TLPs and DLPs, respectively) are generated during rotavirus replication, only TLPs are infectious, due to the requirements of VP4 and VP7 for cell binding, and trypsin cleavage of VP4 for viral entry and infectivity [32, 33, 34, 35, 36] . Formation of noninfectious empty TLPs and DLPs, which lack the viral genome, is also observed during infection. The nonstructural proteins (NSP1 through 5) are involved in viral replication, morphogenesis and assembly, but they are not expressed by nonreplicating virus and are not part of the infectious virion [31] .",

Rotavirus structural and nonstructural proteins have been detected in primary DCs from murine mesenteric lymph nodes and spleens [37, 38] , and murine bone marrowderived DCs have been shown to secrete type I IFN and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)a following rhesus (RRV) or bovine rotavirus (RF-81) challenge, respectively [39, 40] . Mature human monocytederived myeloid DCs (moDCs) have been demonstrated to be more susceptible to rotavirus infection than immature moDCs, although infection did not result in substantial cell death [41] . Additionally, infection did not induce moDC maturation, but instead promoted priming of Th1 cells [41] . A recent study of total human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to RRV or human rotavirus indicated that both myeloid DCs and pDCs are susceptible to infection, and that infection results in the secretion of IFNa, presumably from pDCs [42] . While increased levels of IFNa have also been correlated with a positive clinical outcome in infected children [43, 44] , several rotaviruses, including RRV, have recently been demonstrated to antagonize the production of type I IFN through the degradation of interferon regulatory factors (IRF)3, IRF5, and IRF7, and the inhibition of NFkB activation, by a viral nonstructural protein, NSP1 [45, 46, 47, 48] .",

Importantly, we demonstrate that stimulation of pDCs with live or inactivated RRV effects secretion of IFNa and multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This response is dependent on the presence of the viral dsRNA genome. As IFNa production by pDCs is classically triggered in response to ssRNA or DNA, the induction of this response by a replication-incompetent dsRNA virus indicates a potentially novel mechanism of viral sensing by pDCs.",

A potent antiviral, interferon-a (IFNa), is rapidly secreted by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in response to viral single-stranded RNA or DNA genomes. Here, we examined the effects of rotavirus on pDCs purified from human blood. We found that very few pDCs supported rotavirus replication, and that pDCs retained similar functionality in response to live or inactivated rotaviruses. While pDCs produced large quantities of IFNa shortly after rotavirus exposure, this was impaired in cells supporting viral replication. We also found that two viral proteins and the rotavirus double-stranded RNA genome were required for the initiation of the pDC IFNa response to rotavirus. Additionally, we found that cleavage of one of these viral proteins, a traditional prerequisite for rotavirus infection in other cell types, was not required for the infection of pDCs or production of IFNa. This may enable the host to rapidly initiate an immune response to rotavirus that subsequently restricts infection to the intestine and contributes to the resolution of disease. Our study provides novel insight into the interaction between rotavirus and the host innate immune response, and also identifies a unique mechanism for the production of IFNa by pDCs.",

            "text": "Production of IFNa is an important component of the pDCderived antiviral response. To assess this component of the pDC anti-rotaviral response, the frequency of cells expressing IFNa was determined by flow cytometry. Intracellular IFNa was detected within 4hpi of RRV stimulus, peaked at 6hpi and was sustained until at least 12hpi ( Figure 3A and 3B). IFNa was detected intracellularly at similar frequencies in pDCs exposed to iRRV (which was both infectivity and transcriptionally negative) (p = 0.815; Mann-Whitney) ( Figure 3A and data not shown), suggesting that replication or transcription of rotavirus is largely dispensable for IFNa induction in human pDCs. Intracellular IFNa was abrogated by the addition of RRV neutralizing VP7 or VP4 monoclonal antibodies (either mAb 159 or 2G4), indicating that the observed induction was virus-specific and likely dependent on an event occurring after virus binding and entry ( Figure 3C ) [49] . To identify and quantify IFNa secretion, and to detect other cytokines and chemokines secreted in response to RRV exposure, Luminex assays or ELISAs were performed on supernatants collected from inoculated pDCs at various times post infection. Only supernatants from pDC cultures $85% pure (mean: 90.84%60.75; n = 3-18) were analyzed to minimize the contribution of contaminating cells to the cytokine milieu. A significant IFNa response, approaching 10,000 pg IFNa/ml, was detectable 6h following exposure to live or inactivated RRV ( Figure 4A ). In addition, significant quantities of IFNb, TNFa, interleukin (IL)6, IL8, CXCL10 (IP10), CCL3 (MIP1a), CCL4 (MIP1b), CCL5 (RANTES) and TNFb were detected at various times post infection ( Figure 4B -I and data not shown). Together, these data suggest that live or inactivated RRV rapidly induce production of significant levels of IFNa and other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines by pDCs.",

The percent of IFNa + pDCs was significantly increased in the NSP2 dim population compared to that in the NSP2 bright (p = 0.0006; Wilcoxon signed rank test), supporting the hypothesis that increased levels of RRV infection are inversely correlated with IFNa production. More significant was the sustained production of IFNa in uninfected (NSP2 -) pDCs following RRV stimulus. A similar correlation between NSP2 expression and IFNb production was also observed ( Figure 5C ). These data indicate that infection in a minor subset of pDCs results in the local suppression of the IFNa response in these specific cells.",

            "text": "To further investigate the impairment of the IFNa response in pDCs undergoing rotavirus replication, phosphorylation of IRF7, the key transcription factor for the IFNa response in pDCs [50] , was assessed by phosflow ( Figure 5D and 5E). In accordance with the decreased production of IFNa by NSP2 bright cells compared to that of NSP2 dim pDCs, as well as previous findings of IRF7 degradation in rotavirus-infected cells [45, 46] , phosphorylated IRF7 (pIRF7) was substantially decreased in pDCs bright for NSP2 (p = 0.03 versus NSP2 dim pDCs; Wilcoxon signed rank test) ( Figure 5D and 5E), and is similar to that of IFNa -NSP2 -pDCs (p = 0.56; Wilcoxon signed rank test) ( Figure 5E ). To determine whether this decrease in pIRF7 was due to decreased levels of total IRF7 in pDCs, the MFI of total IRF7 was assessed ( Figure 5F ). While the total IRF7 MFI was slightly depressed in NSP2 bright compared to NSP2 dim pDCs, this decrease was not significant (p = 0.44; Wilcoxon signed rank test) and thus does not account for the observed differences in IRF7 phosphorylation. The increased levels of pIRF7 in NSP2 dim pDCs may represent continual, direct stimulus of the IRF7 pathway in virus-positive pDCs, as well as a mechanism by which the IFNa response is directly initiated. Alternately, pIRF7 may be sequestered in a nontraditional cellular compartment prior to degradation, leading to increased protein accumulation. Interestingly, levels of IRF7 phosphorylation in IFNa + NSP2 -pDCs were intermediate to that of NSP2 dim (p = 0.31; Wilcoxon signed rank test) and NSP2 bright or NSP2 -IFNa -pDCs (p = 0.0313; Wilcoxon signed rank test) ( Figure 5E ). The slight depression of pIRF7 in the IFNa + population compared to that observed in NSP2 dim pDCs may be attributable to the enhanced IFNa production in this subpopulation. As pIRF7 is degraded following the initiation of IFNa transcription, cells in which IFNa has been transcribed would be expected to have lower levels of pIRF7 than those negative for IFNa. Notably, inhibition of IFNa secretion, achieved by simultaneous addition of brefeldin A with viral inoculation, decreased the percent of IFNa + pDCs by an average of 63.5% (n = 6, data not shown). This supports the notion that recognition of secreted IFNa is an essential component of the IFNa response following rotavirus exposure, as has been reported with Newcastle disease virus [14] . Importantly, this is the first demonstration of impaired IRF phosphorylation in primary human cells infected with rotavirus.",

To investigate the role of trypsin-mediated cleavage of VP4 in both rotavirus infection of, and IFNa production by, human pDCs, we exposed pDCs to RRV grown in the absence of trypsin (non-trypsinized; NT-RRV). Although subsequent exposure to trypsin (thus cleaving VP4) increased infectivity of the uncleaved NT-RRV preparation 63-fold by plaque titration and intracellular NSP2 staining by 20fold in MA104s (data not shown), examination of NSP2 staining showed that similar proportions of pDCs were infected with either the cleaved or uncleaved NT-RRV preparations (p = 0.625; Wilcoxon signed rank test) ( Figure 6A-C) . Likewise, uncleaved NT-RRV induced IFNa production by a similar (p = 0.375; Wilcoxon signed rank test) percentage of pDCs, compared to cleaved NT-RRV ( Figure 6A , 6B and 6D). Thus, cleavage of VP4 by trypsin is dispensable for both pDC infection and IFNa induction by RRV.",

            "text": "Although the ability of pDCs to mount an IFNa response to viral infection is well described, the only documented viral TLR ligands for pDCs are ssRNA and DNA [2, 3, 7, 8, 9] . As rotavirus is a dsRNA virus and since psoralen-treated, transcriptionallyinactive rotavirus efficiently induced IFNa (Figures 3 and 4A) , we investigated the viral requirements for IFNa induction. pDCs stimulated with equal quantities (see Methods describing particle quantification) of purified TLPs, DLPs, empty particles, or genome-free recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) were stained for intracellular IFNa. As expected, density gradient purified RRV TLPs stimulated similar levels (p = 0.695; Wilcoxon signed rank test; n = 10) of IFNa production compared to pDCs treated with unpurified live or inactivated RRV expressing equivalent amounts of VP4, as measured by hemagglutination titer (Figure 7 ). pDCs exposed to 2/6 genome-containing RRV DLPs expressed neither IFNa nor NSP2, indicating a likely dependence on VP4 or VP7 for viral entry, as previously reported [32] . Alternately, one or both of these viral proteins could be serving as the pathogenassociated molecular pattern (PAMP) responsible for inducing the pDC IFNa response. To address this, pDCs were stimulated with 2/4/6/7 VLPs or 2/6/7 green fluorescent protein (GFP)-VLPs. Both 2/6/7 GFP-VLPs and 2/4/6/7 VLPs were capable of entering pDCs, but failed to induce IFNa (Figure 7 and data not shown). 2/6 VLPs were comparatively defective in the ability to enter pDCs (data not shown), thus supporting the hypothesis that DLPs fail to induce IFNa due to inefficient viral entry. The ability of infectious SA11, the parental virus from which the 2/4/6/7 VLPs were derived, to induce IFNa production ( Figure 7) suggests that the lack of IFNa following inoculation with 2/4/6/7 VLPs was due to the absence of a viral genome, and not to strain variation in surface proteins. Consistent with this hypothesis, IFNa was detected in very few pDCs exposed to empty TLPs, as compared to pDCs exposed to equal quantities of genomecontaining TLPs. Instead, IFNa production by pDCs exposed to empty particles was consistent with that observed in pDCs inoculated with an equal infectious dose of TLPs, suggesting that residual contaminating viral genome was responsible for IFNa production by the empty TLPs. Together, these data indicate that viral entry, mediated by VP4 and/or VP7, and the viral dsRNA genome are likely required for rotavirus-induced IFNa production by pDCs.",

            "text": "Endosomal acidification is required for initiation of the pDC IFNa response to rotavirus To begin to characterize the mechanism by which pDC recognition and subsequent induction of the IFNa response occurs following rotavirus exposure, pDCs were treated with concanamycin A, a potent inhibitor of endosomal acidification, and thus TLR7/9 function [9, 51, 52] , prior to inoculation with either live or inactivated RRV at an moi of 10 ( Figure 8A-8C) . Subsequent examination of intracellular IFNa production revealed significant inhibition in concanamycin-treated pDCs compared to untreated cells (mean 6 SEM, RRV: 83.3%64.6; iRRV: 83.2%64.5; p = 0.01; Mann-Whitney). To determine whether the observed lack of IFNa production was due to a defect in viral entry, concanamycin-treated pDCs were examined for NSP2 expression. Interestingly, NSP2 expression was significantly increased in concanamycin-treated pDCs compared to untreated cells ( Figure 8D and 8E) (mean fold increase: 5.9; p = 0.03; Wilcoxon signed rank test; n = 6). These data indicate that concanamycininduced inhibition of endosomal acidification does not inhibit viral infection of pDCs and hence, presumably, does not restrict viral entry. These data support the conclusion that concanamycin A treatment prevents the pDC IFNa response at the level of ligand recognition, implicating TLR7 or TLR9. Additionally, the data suggest that the observed low levels of viral replication in pDCs ( Figure 1D ) are due, at least in part, to suppression by the pDC IFN response, as NSP2 expression significantly increases following IFNa inhibition ( Figure 8C and 8D) . Notably, these experiments demonstrate that endosomal acidification is required for the pDC IFNa response to rotavirus, and provide indirect evidence for the involvement of an endosomal receptor, such as TLR7 or TLR9, in the induction of this response.",

Traditional receptors for dsRNA, such as RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3, are largely thought to not play a role in the initiation of the IFN response in human pDCs [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . Although Newcastle disease virus normally elicits an IFNa response in murine pDCs through triggering TLR7, RIG-I-like helicases have been recently implicated in IFNa induction by replicating virus in murine pDCs lacking the IFN receptor [14] . Hence, the mechanisms governing efficient IFNa induction in these cells by transcriptionally inactivated, replication-incompetent dsRNA rotavirus are not yet understood. As rotaviruses represent a large burden of human disease, it will be important to better understand the immune mechanisms underlying their recognition and subsequent generation of antiviral immunity.",

(B) Time course of IFNa induction in pDCs after mock or RRV (moi staining for NSP2 was observed in only a small percentage (#5%) of cells following RRV exposure, even at a non-physiologically relevant moi of 100. While productive infection was observed in a subset of donors, this was significantly less than that observed in cells highly permissive for rotavirus infection [53] . As rotavirus is generally a lytic virus [31, 54, 55] , the observed lack of significant death in pDC preparations exposed to live RRV, compared to those receiving mock stimulus or inactivated virus, further indicates that few pDCs are permissive to viral replication. These findings are in agreement with previous reports of low frequencies of pDC infection in virus models such as herpes simplex virus 2 [56] , Dengue [57] , human cytomegalovirus [17] , influenza [58] , HCV [24] and HIV [59] . The inability of the primary human peripheral pDC population to be uniformly infected by rotaviruses may be attributable to multiple factors, including age of the individual pDC, stage of the cell cycle, or cell-surface marker expression. Additionally, functionally-distinct pDC subsets have been recently identified on the basis of CD2 expression [60] ; studies are currently underway to elucidate the role of these subsets in the pDC response to rotavirus.",

Evidence of this functionality was observed primarily in the major NSP2bystander population, although activation and maturation were significantly enhanced in the few NSP2 + pDCs, as well. The induction of this phenotype by inactivated RRV further indicates that the pDCs are responding to the presence of input virus or to secreted factors, and not to viral replication. The upregulation of DC costimulatory and maturation markers suggests antigen presentation to T cells is preserved, in line with previous reports that pDCs are necessary for stimulation of IFNc-secreting memory T cells [42] . The antigen presentation hypothesis is supported by increased expression of CD86 and CD83 on NSP2 + pDCs compared to bystander pDCs, indicating that the presence of virus enhances this phenotype. Conversely, IFNa/b production is impaired in NSP2 + pDCs. Combined with decreased IRF7 phosphorylation in NSP2 bright pDCs, this suggests the direct inhibition of the type I IFN response by rotavirus replication, as has been previously observed in fibroblasts and epithelial cells [45, 46, 47, 48] .",

While it has previously been reported that exposure to rotavirus induces IFNa secretion by murine FLT3 ligand-driven pDCs [39] and total human PBMCs [42] , and that this response required pDCs [42] , it was unclear until now whether pDCs produced IFNa directly in response to virus, or if pDCs amplified IFNa production in response to type I IFN or some other signal from a non-pDC. In a limited number of experiments, Mesa et al [42] observed not only pDCs singly positive for IFNa or rotavirus, but also cells double-positive for rotavirus and IFNa at a greater frequency than that reported here. It is important to note that Mesa et al used NSP4 as a marker for rotavirus infection. Extracellular NSP4 has been identified on uninfected cells [61] . Conversely, NSP2, employed in this report, to date has only been detected intracellularly. As such, the percentage of cells identified as positive for rotavirus on the basis of NSP4 staining could be inflated versus those expressing NSP2, as NSP4 staining may include pDCs not truly supporting viral replication; in turn, the percent of NSP4 + IFNa + pDCs would be artificially increased. This, combined with differences in sample size, may explain the discrepancies in the incidence of NSP4 + IFNa + pDCs (n = 3) observed by Mesa et al and the frequency of NSP2 + IFNa + pDCs (n = 27) reported here.",

Presumably, the constitutive expression of IRF7 in pDCs [63] allows for rapid induction of IFNa following rotavirus exposure, thus effectively suppressing viral replication-and the production of NSPs-in the majority of pDCs through the establishment of a largely paracrineinduced antiviral state. This conclusion is supported by the observed lack of significant increase in the NSP2 + or IFNa + pDC populations when the moi is increased to 25 or 100 (data not shown). Importantly, the decrease in IFNa and pIRF7 in pDCs expressing high levels of NSP2 illustrates that the local suppression of the interferon response by actively replicating virus [45, 46, 47, 48] is conserved in human pDCs at an individual cell level. However, inhibition in this minor population is unlikely to substantially modulate the amount of cytokine produced by the total pDC population. The present study provides the first formal demonstration of type I IFN inhibition in primary human cells in which rotavirus replicates.",

The long-standing understanding of the requirement for VP4 proteolytic cleavage by luminal trypsin to activate viral entry and infection in the gut led to the assumption that efficient rotavirus infection could not occur systemically due to absence of appropriate extracellular proteases. Rotavirus infection was thought to be largely constrained to the intestine because this was the only anatomical location with substantial amounts of active extracellular trypsin available. The apparent dispensability of this proteolytic requirement for pDC infection may represent an alternate mechanism of rotavirus entry. This ''non-trypsin dependent'' mechanism of infectious entry might also account for the low levels of systemic organ infection and spread that normally occurs during rotavirus infection, and the elevated levels seen during rotavirus infection of highly immunocompromised people or animals, where the systemic availability of trypsin to proteolytically activate rotavirus is unlikely. Additionally, this provides a mechanism for the establishment of an antiviral state systemically, where circulating virus would not be expected to be able to infect cells in the traditional, trypsin cleavage-dependent, manner.",

            "text": "Importantly, this finding may represent an alternative mechanism of IFNa induction in primary human pDCs. The ability of a pDC that takes up rotavirus to mount a vigorous type I IFN response independently of rotavirus mRNA or protein expression provides a potential mechanism by which the host could effectively circumvent the anti-IFN effects of NSP1-mediated IRF degradation [62] . At least three possible mechanisms exist for this phenotype: first, input or self nucleic acid released from necrotic or apoptotic cells may serve as PAMPs in neighboring cells, as has been previously described [64] . As RRV exposure, either to replicationcompetent or inactivated virus, does not induce substantial pDC death (Figure 1) , and as the cytokine response occurs rapidly following infection, this scenario seems unlikely. Secondly, input viral dsRNA may be exposed in the cytosol, the traditional cellular location for rotavirus replication, through the process of viral replication and interact with a cytosolic receptor such as RIG-I or protein kinase R (PKR). Rotavirus and reovirus, both members of the Reoviridae family, have been demonstrated to induce IFNb production in epithelial and human embryonic kidney 293T cells, respectively, via RIG-I, but not PKR or TLR3 [65, 66] . The mechanism by which input viral genomic RNA recognition might occur is unclear, however, as viral dsRNA is thought to remain encapsidated in the DLP and not be free in the cytoplasm during viral replication. Finally, rotavirus particles may be taken up by and degraded within the endosome, where dsRNA or its degradation products, including ssRNA fragments or a single strand of the dsRNA [12] , would be able to interact with TLR3, TLR7 or TLR9. As a biological role for known dsRNA receptors, such as RIG-I, PKR or TLR3, has not been demonstrated in human pDCs [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] , it is unlikely that these receptors are responsible for the observed IFNa induction in this system, although RIG-I like helicases have been recently implicated in the generation of a type I IFN response in pDCs from IFN receptor knockout mice [14] .",

Although the precise kinetics of induction are unclear, both TNFa and IFNa are also observed in pDC supernatants following influenza infection [24, 68, 69] . Interestingly, production of IFNa is delayed until 14-20 h following infection with a laboratory strain of H1N1 influenza, at which point ,4 ng/mL per million pDCs is detectable; this production was dependent on viral replication [69] . Conversely, we report that pDCs exposed to either live or inactivated rotavirus secrete approximately 10 ng/mL of IFNa by 6hpi. In agreement with previous findings [14] , the recognition of secreted IFNa is an important component of the amplification of the pDC IFNa response to both live and inactivated rotavirus. As such, the recognition of input viral genome and subsequent induction of an initial IFNa response prior to possible IRF7 inhibition allows for the establishment of an antiviral state by the global pDC population. While inactivated herpes simplex virus also induces IFNa, replication of vesicular stomatitis virus, Sendai virus and human respiratory syncytial virus has been demonstrated to be required for IFNa induction in pDCs [70, 71] . Together, this demonstration of rapid, potent, replication-independent induction of cytokine by a dsRNA virus, largely dependent on endosomal acidification, points to a novel mechanism leading to production of IFNa by human pDCs.",

Increased levels of serum IFNa have been reported in human pediatric patients infected with rotavirus [43, 44] ; levels peaked within two days of symptom onset and disease resolved more quickly in patients with the highest levels of IFNa [43] . Likewise, type I IFN responses were observed in newborn calves infected with bovine rotavirus: animals receiving both high and low doses of viral inoculums generated multiple waves of IFN production, with higher doses correlating with both more rapid IFN responses and a lack of clinical signs [74] . As the ability of type I IFN to activate multiple arms of the innate and adaptive immune response is well documented (reviewed in [75, 76, 77] ), and recent data have shown that type I IFN plays a critical role in restricting systemic rotavirus infection [78] , we predict that pDC-derived type I IFN plays a significant role in confining rotavirus replication to the intestine while initiating the systemic immune response in the periphery.",

            "text": "In summary, these studies show that primary human pDCs are largely resistant to rotavirus replication, but that they remain responsive and functional following viral exposure, as indicated by cellular activation, maturation and production of multiple cytokines, including TNFa and large amounts of IFNa. The pDC response is demonstrated to require both the viral dsRNA genome and acidification of the pDC endosome, implying the likely initiation of the type I IFN response by TLR7 or TLR9. To our knowledge, these data are the first to show that inactivated rotavirus can efficiently induce a type I IFN response, which differs from what has been seen in fibroblasts and epithelial cells exposed to rotavirus [62] . The restricted ability of rotavirus to replicate in pDCs, combined with the ability of the pDC to effect a type I IFN response in the absence of viral replication, likely serves the purposes of enabling the host to mount an innate antiviral response despite the efficient degradation of the IRFs by rotavirus NSP1 in many host cells. Combined with the novel dispensability of trypsin cleavage of VP4 for the initiation of the pDC response, this creates a mechanism for the establishment of an antiviral state in the systemic extraintestinal environment and likely contributes to the substantial restriction of systemic replication compared to that observed in the intestine [38] . These experiments also provide the first indication that rotavirus infection is capable of locally suppressing IFNa production in primary human cells. Importantly, these findings demonstrate that rotavirus infection of primary human pDCs provides a valuable experimental system for the study of cellular processes, receptors and signaling pathways underlying pDC-mediated antiviral immunity while revealing a potentially novel dsRNA-mediated pathway of IFNa induction.",
