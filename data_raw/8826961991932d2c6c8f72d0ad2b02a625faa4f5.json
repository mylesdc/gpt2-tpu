However, there is no current data available for extracellular nucleases derived from M. tuberculosis. Herein, we have identified and characterized Rv0888, an extracellular nuclease in M. tuberculosis. The protein was overexpressed in E. coli, and the purified Rv0888 protein was found to require divalent cations for activity, with an optimal temperature and pH of 41 \u00b0C and 6.5, respectively. Further results demonstrated that Rv0888 nuclease activity could be inhibited by four Chinese medicine monomers. Based on sequence analysis, Rv0888 nuclease exhibited no homology with any known extracellular nucleases, indicating that Rv0888 is a novel nuclease. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that the H353, D387, and D438 residues play catalytic roles in Rv0888. In vivo infection studies confirmed that Rv0888 is required for infection and is related to pathogenicity, as the persistent ability of recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis (rMS) Rv0888NS/MS and Rv0888S/MS is significantly higher than pMV262/MS in the lung tissue, and the Rv0888NS/MS and Rv0888S/MS could produce pathological changes in the mice lung. These results show that Rv0888 is relevant to pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis.",

Extracellular nucleases produced by Shewanella, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus allow these bacteria to degrade extracellular DNA to its basic components: phosphate, carbon, and nitrogen 1-3 . A recent study by Seper et al. demonstrated that wild-type Vibrio cholerae rapidly degraded the DNA component of NETs through the combined activity of two extracellular nucleases, Dns and Xds 4 . In S. aureus, an extracellular nuclease also degraded NETs, triggering caspase-3-mediated death of immune cells 5 . Moreover, nuclease A (Gbs0661), an extracellular nuclease of Streptococcus agalactiae, is required for full virulence of the organism 6 and attacks NETs, which are a component of the host defense response that immobilizes microbes for subsequent clearance by innate immunity machinery, including phagocytosis by macrophages. A Mn 2+ -stimulated deoxyribonuclease (Nuc B) is released by Bacillus subtilis 168 during sporulation in glucose-deficient medium, which degrades structurally important nucleic acids, thereby controlling the development and dispersal of bacterial biofilms 7,8 .",

In 2013, an estimated 9.0 million people contracted TB and a subsequent 1.5 million people died from the disease, of whom 360,000 were HIV-positive 9 . M. tuberculosis is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells after inhalation into the lung. However, M. tuberculosis can proliferate within these immune cells, eventually escaping from the phagosome and migrating to draining lymph nodes to spread the infection 10-12 . Rv0888, a protein that belongs to the large endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase family (Pfam family PF03372) 13 , has sphingomyelinase activity that has been detected in M. tuberculosis culture filtrates 14 . In this study, we identified and characterized Rv0888, the first extracellular nuclease to be reported from M. tuberculosis. We demonstrate that this enzyme is highly active in degrading different types of nucleic acids (chromosomal DNA, double-stranded PCR products, plasmid DNA, and baker's yeast RNA) utilizing divalent metal cations (Ca 2+ and Mn 2+ ). In addition, the nuclease activity of Rv0888 is inhibited by four Chinese medicine monomers (Oleuropein, 6-Gingerol, Corylifolinin, and Acteoside). Finally, we confirmed that Rv0888 is relevant to mycobacterial pathogenicity.",

In order to purify the protein, Rv0888 was expressed as a 6 \u00d7 His-tagged protein in E. coli. Though it was expressed in inclusion body form, Rv0888 was renatured and purified via a Ni 2+ affinity chromatography resin (Fig. 1A) . Then, the eluted Rv0888 protein was loaded onto an anion exchange chromatography column (Fig. 1B) and subsequently passed through a gel filtration chromatography resin, subsequently resulting in greater than 98% protein purity (Fig. 1C ).",

In order to determine the role of Rv0888 in mycobacterial pathogenicity, the persistence ability of M. smegmatis overexpressing Rv0888 in lung tissue was estimated. Three groups of 3 mice were infected intranasally with a dose (2 \u00d7 10 7 colony forming units) of the rMS strains pMV262/MS, Rv0888NS/MS, and Rv0888S/MS, respectively. Bacterial loads in lung tissue were measured at 4 h, 24 h, 4 d, 7 d, and 17 d after infection (Fig. 7) . No significant difference was observed between the bacterial loads of Rv0888NS/MS and Rv0888S/MS groups at all time-points, whereas the bacterial loads of Rv0888NS/MS and Rv0888S/MS groups were remarkably higher, compared with that of pMV262/MS group, at 4 d, 7 d, and 17 d after infection. Importantly, in contrast to the almost total clearance of Histopathological analysis revealed that lungs from mice at 7 d after infection in the pMV262/MS group had no pathological changes, whereas mild hyperplasia was observed in alveolar epithelial cells of the mice in the Rv0888NS/MS group, and partial mild hematopedesis and hyperplasia were observed in alveolar epithelial cells in the Rv0888S/MS group (Fig. 8) . Taken together, it was suggested that nuclease activity is required for mycobacteria to resist defensive clearance of lung tissue and may be related to mycobacterial pathogenicity.",

Mn 2+ and Ca 2+ were found to be optimal for its nuclease activity, although other divalent cations (Mg 2+ , Ba 2+ , Ni 2+ ) could also stimulate Rv0888 activity (Table 1 ). These observations indicated that either the divalent cation diameter was not a factor in accessing the Rv0888 catalytic site or that these cations bind to different amino acids to maintain activity, as previously reported for the E. coli nuclease, Colicin E9 21 . Metal chelation, as assessed by EDTA treatment, had a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of the Rv0888 enzyme, suggesting that metal ions were obligatory for nuclease activity and that they might play vital roles in stabilizing the enzymatic structure. Amino acid substitution studies indicated that the D438 residue may play a key role in Rv0888 nuclease activity, while the H353A and D387A substitutions had a positive influence on Rv0888 activity. The importance of these residues indicate that Rv0888 differs from other bacterial extracellular nucleases which contain the conserved DRGH motif (as in S. pneumoniae EndA) 22 or the degenerate DKGH motif (as in S. agalactiae Gbs0661) 6 . Although the Rv0888 protein showed non-specific nuclease activity, it also shares no homology to any known nucleases, as determined by the primary amino acid sequence ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).

New drugs and more effective vaccines are urgently needed, thus necessitating a better understanding of the genetic basis for M. tuberculosis virulence and pathogenesis 23 . Interestingly, Rv0888 activity was inhibited by four Chinese medicine monomers (Oleuropein, 6-Gingerol, Corylifolinin, and Acteoside). Previous studies have concentrated on small molecule inhibitors, focusing on proteins and factors related to the biosynthesis of pathogens: limiting S. aureus entry into endothelial cells by structural analogs of ML 141 24 ; blocking coronavirus and filovirus entry into host cells by the cysteine protease inhibitor K11777 25 ; blocking phosphatidylglycerol-LtaS binding and inhibiting LTA synthesis in ItaS-expressin S. aureus and in Escherichia coli with compound 1771 26 ; Inhibiting A. baumannii Lipid II (an essential precursor of cell wall biosynthesis) through the use of BAS00127538 27 . Subsequent drug studies then shifted to cell wall proteins and proteases: small molecule inhibitors of sortase that act as an anti-infective therapy against hospital-acquired S. aureus infection without the side effects of standard antibiotics 28 ; tetrahydrolipstatin that inhibits the phospholipase/thioesterase (Rv3802c) of M. tuberculosis 29 ; an inhibitor of mPTPB (a virulence factor of tuberculosis) which was acquired by organocatalysis 30 ; six small molecules that were confirmed to act as novel EndA (surface endonuclease of the S. pneumoniae) inhibitors 31 . Importantly, this manuscript report for the first time that Chinese medicine monomers are effective inhibitors of bacterial nucleases. New drug research is nuclease localizations in bacteria: secreted in the medium (S. pyogenes), membrane-associated (S. pneumoniae) and peptidoglycan-anchored (S. pyogenes, Streptococcus suis) 18, 32, 33 . In M. tuberculosis, Rv0888 contains a signal peptide and is secreted into the medium 14 . This exported product could be more effective for M. tuberculosis pathogenecity than a membrane-associated nuclease like S. pneumoniae EndA, which would have limited access to its substrate 34 . The characterization of Rv0888 nuclease in this study will facilitate the understanding of the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis and might prompt identification of novel drugs to treat TB.",

The verified protein was concentrated again and loaded onto a Resource S 5 mL column (GE Healthcare), which was pre-equilibrated with buffer J. The target protein was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of NaCl concentration from 0 M to 2 M. Fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.",
