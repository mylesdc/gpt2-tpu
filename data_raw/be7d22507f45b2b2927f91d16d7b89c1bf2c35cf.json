In addition to the previously demonstrated pathogenic roles of prions during the development of different mammalian diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, they have recently been shown to represent an important functional component in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and bacteriophages, confirming the previously unexplored important regulatory and functional roles. However, an indepth analysis of these domains in eukaryotic viruses has not been performed. Here, we examined the presence of prion-like proteins in eukaryotic viruses that play a primary role in different ecosystems and that are associated with emerging diseases in humans. We identified relevant functional associations in different viral processes and regularities in their presence at different taxonomic levels. Using the prion-like amino-acid composition computational algorithm, we detected 2679 unique putative prionlike domains within 2,742,160 publicly available viral protein sequences. Our findings indicate that viral prion-like proteins can be found in different viruses of insects, plants, mammals, and humans. The analysis performed here demonstrated common patterns in the distribution of prion-like domains across viral orders and families, and revealed probable functional associations with different steps of viral replication and interaction with host cells. These data allow the identification of the viral prion-like proteins as potential novel regulators of viral infections.",

We used a low LLR cutoff of 0.003, in order to analyze the majority of PrDs and their distribution among different viral orders and families, and 2,681 PrDs have been identified (Supplementary Table 1) .

The functions of proteins with the identified PrDs were classified using the manually-curated GO categories and were based on the major steps of viral replication.

However, there were certain differences, and some PrDs that had high PLAAC score were found to be below the 0.05 cutoff of PAPA algorithm.

Adhesion and entry of viral nucleic acids represent crucial steps in the viral-host interactions and the viral PrD-containing proteins showed to be involved in these processes represented the second largest group. We identified the PrDs in the viral surface proteins that are involved in the direct contact and fusion of viruses with the host cell membrane, indicating that PrDs may be functionally implicated in these processes as well. Moreover, a similar trend was previously noted in the distribution of PrDs in proteins responsible for the bacterial and bacteriophage interactions 39 . Interestingly, most PrDs were found in Baculoviridae, the rod-shaped viruses. We identified PrDs in 56 out of 66 known species belonging this family, indicating that this high prevalence of PrDs in one viral family may not be a coincidence. Therefore, we further showed that one of the PrDs associated with the cell adhesion and entry most frequently found in Baculoviridae is occlusion-derived virus envelope protein 66 (ODV-E66), which was recently the first identified viral chondroitin lyase, an enzyme that degrades chondroitin and is associated with viral entry 65, 66 .",

Only enterovirus B were shown to have the PrDs in both polyprotein and capsid protein VP1. These observations require additional investigations, since they cannot be due to an incomplete analysis, as the UniProt database contains the data on many Picornavirales proteins.

We observed consistent PrD distribution patterns in different viral families and species, and these domains were identified in a variety of proteins. However, since the majority of viruses were shown to lack the PrDs, this shows that the presence of PrDs is beneficial, but not obligatory, which agrees with the results obtained for the PrDs found in bacteria and bacteriophages 32, 34 .
