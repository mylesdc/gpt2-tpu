Type I interferon (IFN) and cytokine production are crucial in the innate immune system. We previously reported that DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) induced low levels of interferon regulatory factor 3 and NF-kB activation, thus leading to reduced production of IFN-b in the early phase of infection. Here, we determined whether DENV infection not only hampers type I IFN activation but also cytokine production triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling.",

Furthermore, DENV-2 infection repressed cytokine production triggered by TLR signaling. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this suppression event, we measured NF-kB activation by p65 nuclear translocation and luciferase reporter assay and found that NF-kB activation triggered by TLR ligands was blocked by DENV-2 infection. As well, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity was suppressed by DENV-2 infection.",

Mosquitoes transmitting DENV in humans has been a major cause of dengue diseases in tropical and subtropical counties; approximately one-third of the world's population is at risk of the infection. People infected with DENV typically show self-limited febrile dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Life-threatening dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is more likely to occur after a second DENV infection [1, 2] . Other than supportive treatments, no specific therapy is available for denguerelated diseases. Several tetravalent DENV vaccine candidates are under development, but an effective, safe and affordable dengue vaccine remains elusive [3] .",

Particularly, the mononuclear phagocyte lineage of macrophages, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) and skin Langerhans cells are the primary cell targets [4, 5, 6] . Similar cellular tropism of macrophages and DCs was observed in the experimental DENV mouse infection model [7] . Macrophages and DCs are the most crucial cell types in innate immunity and rapidly produce type I interferons (IFNs) and cytokines to fight against microbe invasion. Type I IFNs are potent inhibitors of virus replication. Therefore, many pathogenic viruses have developed strategies to escape the IFN-triggered anti-viral effects. More than 170 different virusencoded IFN antagonists from 93 distinct viruses have been described [8] . For example, hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of Flaviviridae, evades innate immunity by cleaving mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, an IFN stimulator, with its protease NS3/4A [9] . The nonstructural proteins NS4B of DENV-2, West Nile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) block the activation of STAT1 in cells stimulated with type I IFN [10, 11] .",

Engagement of TLRs with their ligands triggers signal cascades to activate IRFs and NF-kB, thus leading to production of cytokines and type I IFN [17] .

The TLR3 ligand polyI:C and the TLR9 ligand CpG greatly stimulated the mRNA expression of IFN-b (124-fold induction at 2 h by polyI:C and 531-fold induction at 6 h by CpG), IL-10 (77-fold at 12 h by polyI:C and 74-fold at 36 h by CpG), IL-12p40 (381-fold at 24 h by polyI:C and 1551-fold at 6 h by CpG), and TNFa (64-fold at 2 h by polyI:C and 180-fold at 6 h by CpG) ( Figure 1A -D, left panels). However, levels of IFN-b and these cytokines were much lower in cells with DENV-2 infection (Figure 1 , left and right panels): especially, IL-10 was not induced by DENV-2 infection. The kinetic of DENV-2 replication in BMDCs was measured by qPCR with primers specific for DENV-2 59-UTR ( Figure 1E ) and by immunofluorescence staining with antibody specific against DENV-2 NS3 ( Figure 1F ). DENV-2 replication peaked around 12-24 h post infection, in consistence with cytokine induction peaked around 12-36 h post infection. Therefore, infection with DENV-2 inefficiently triggered type I IFN expression and that of other cytokines. Since DENV-2 infection would produce intracellular viral RNA to turn on RLR and TLR signaling cascades for cytokine production, weak induction of DENV-2 for these cytokine genes ( Figure 1 ) implies that DENV-2 may interfere with a common signaling pathway for inducing type I IFN and other inflammatory cytokines.",

Similar results were noticed in DENV-2-infected BMDCs that polyI:C-activated IFN-b and IL-10 were reduced with DENV-2 infection ( Figure 2C ).

In our infection system, two strains of DENV-2, PL046 and NGC, triggered low degree of NFkB p65 nuclear translocation. Nuclear staining of p65 was noted in 7% and 13% of PL046-and NGCinfected cells, respectively ( Figure S2A panels b and c) ; in contrast, about 80% of the control virus infected cells showed nuclear staining of NF-kB p65 ( Figure S2A, panel d) . Thus, we checked whether DENV-2 could suppress NF-kB activation triggered by TLRs engagement. With use of a NF-kB-dependent luciferase reporter, NF-kB activation stimulated by the TLR ligands LPS and polyI:C was readily blocked in DENV-2-infected cells at 12 and 24 h post stimulation ( Figure 3A ). Immunoblotting result of DENV-2 NS3 indicated that the virus was replicating in A549 cells and was not affected by LPS and polyI:C posttreatment ( Figure 3B ). As well, DENV-2 infection blocked LPS-triggered NF-kB activation in Vero cells as measured by nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 ( Figure 4A) ; similar results were also observed in J774A.1 macrophages ( Figure S2B ). Nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 was slightly increased in A549 cells up to 60 h post DENV-2 infection, but the polyI:C-triggered p65 nuclear translocation was greatly blocked in DENV-2 infected cells ( Figure  S2C ). We also tested the influence of TLR singling in DENV-2 replication, polyI:C pretreatment blocked DENV-2 replication; whereas, the antiviral effect of polyI:C was not seen in cells with established DENV-2 infection ( Figure 4B ). This data is consistent with previous report [30] and suggest that DENV-2 inhibits TLR signaling to benefit its replication. DENV-2 replication in these two cell lines, A549 and Vero, was confirmed by qPCR with viral 59 UTR primers and plaque assay for virion production ( Figure  S3 ). Thus, DENV-2 downregulates TLR-activated NF-kB, which leads to reduced cytokine expression.",

The incidence of DHF/DSS is higher in people with previous exposure to different serotypes of DENV, and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may be a mechanism for DHF/DSS [1] . Enhancing antibodies may increase viral entry and increase the number of infected cells. DENV infection via the ADE route has also been shown to downregulate several genes of the innate immunity system, resulting in suppression of the innate response and increase of DENV replication [35, 36, 37] . In this study, we further demonstrate that DENV per se is a weak cytokine inducer because IL-10, IL-12, and TNFa were induced to a lower extent in DENV-2infected BMDCs. Furthermore, even in the absence of enhancing antibody, DENV could block NF-kB activation and cytokine induction triggered by TLR signaling. Downregulation of the cytokine system may provide a growth advantage for DENV to propagate in host macrophages and DCs.",

IL-10 is critical in suppressing excessive inflammation and immunopathologic conditions caused by the host immune system responding to infections [39, 40] . DHF patients showed high serum levels of IL-10, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of severe dengue disease [41, 42] . In a WNV animal infection model, IL-10 downregulated T cell-mediated immunity and had a negative role in antiviral immunity [43] . Thus, our findings that DENV-2 failed to induce IL-10 expression in BMDCs (Figure 1 ) are unexpected but are consistent with previous reports that IL-10 is not produced from mature human CD1a+ DCs infected with DENV-2 [44, 45] and that microarray data from DENV-1-infected rhesus macaques showed no transcription of IL-10 or other cytokine genes [15] . In addition, we found that DENV-2 could inhibit TLR-triggered IL-10 expression. Therefore, the high IL-10 expression found in patients with dengue-related diseases might not be simply stimulated by the DENV itself. Instead, it may be resulted from uncontrolled DENV replication, which then triggers increased levels of immune activation and increased IL-10 production. DENV infection through the ADE route often induces IL-10 expression, which worsens the host anti-viral system and results in increased DENV production [35, 37, 45] . Thus, DENV infection via ADE or non-ADE routes might have different effects in the immune system.",

NF-kB and MAPKs have been suggested to have critical roles in cytokine induction [47, 48] . A recent study showed that constitutive intestinal NF-kB activation does not lead to destructive inflammation unless accompanied by activation of MAPKs such as p38 and ERK [49] . Our results that DENV-2 blocked activation of NF-kB, as well as ERK1/2, support our findings of cytokine production hampered in DENV-2-infected cells. Because both NFkB and ERK1/2 were affected, DENV may suppress an upstream molecular event such as TLR gene expression, as that has been reported for DENV infection through an ADE route [37] . We also detected TLR genes expression in DENV-2 infected J774A.1 macrophages and found that polyI:Ctriggered TLR4, TLR5 and TLR13 expression was significantly downregulated by DENV-2 ( Figure S4 , panels a-c), but not for that of TRL6, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR2 ( Figure S4 , panels d-g). In contrast, DENV-2 enhanced the gene expression of TLR1 and TLR3 triggered by polyI:C stimulation ( Figure S4 , panels h-i), suggesting that DENV-2 may modulate certain TLR genes expression in macrophage. Other possibilities, such as whether DENV protease, found to block IFN-b promoter activation [13] , may target common molecules involved in type I IFN and cytokine production in TLR signaling, or whether ISG15 that is induced by DENV-2 and functions as an inhibitor of type I IFN production [50] may also contribute to immune evasion, remain to be further studied.",

Other groups have reported that DENV-2 strains MON601 (a laboratory strain of NGC) and 16681 downregulate the activation of NF-kB and production of type I IFN and TNFa in human DC, macrophage, and Huh7 cells [14, 54] . A recent report by Chase A. J. et al.

However, one of the strain ARA6894 did not show such kind of inhibition effect, as ARA6894-infected DCs triggered CD4 + Th1 polarization with high expression of IFNc and TNFa. Interestingly, the polyprotein sequences of strain ARA6894 contain nonsynonymous amino acids that are not present in other DENV-2 strains such as PL046, 16681 and NGC [55] , suggesting that different impacts on DC's function between these DENV-2 strains might be due to viral genome diversity.",

            "text": "Dengue may be the most important arboviral disease potentially affecting 2 to 3 billion people living in tropical and subtropical areas. DENV mainly infects monocytes, macrophages and DCs that are also the most important innate immune cells. The balance between the protective and pathological immune responses likely contributes to the DENV infection outcomes. Our results demonstrating that DENV can modulate the signaling events triggered by several TLRs are of interest and provide an explanation for how DENV may skew the host immune system. Immunofluorescence analysis showed the subcellular localization of NF-kB p65 (red, panels a-d) and the detection of viral proteins DENV-2 NS3 or JEV NS1 (green, panels e-h). (B) J774A.1 macrophages were infected with DENV-2 PL046 for 48 h before stimulation with LPS (1 mg/ml). After 6 h of LPS treatment, the localization of NF-kB p65 was determined by immunostaining with anti-NF-kB p65 antibody (red fluorescence, panels a-d). DENV-2 infection was determined by anti-DENV-2 NS3 antibody (green fluorescence, panels e-h), and the DAPI presents the nuclear counter stain (blue fluorescence, panels i-l). Representative cells from the same field are shown for each experimental group. (C) A549 cells were infected with DENV-2 PL046 (MOI of 5) for the indicated times. For polyI:C stimulation, DENV-2-infected cells at 36 h p.i. were transfected with polyI:C (2 mg) and incubated for another 24 h, meaning DENV-2 infection for a total of 60 h. For the mock control group, polyI:C stimulation was conducted by polyI:C (2 mg) transfection for 24 h. The immunofluorescence staining of NF-kB P65 was performed as described above, and the DENV-2 infected cells with nuclear p65 were counted. Data are mean6SD from 3 determinations. Table S1 . (TIF) ",
