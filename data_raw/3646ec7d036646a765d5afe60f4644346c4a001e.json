Various populations of myeloid cells were observed. Cell 24 types based on morphological features are labelled in the figure. Transfection of poly(I:C) is essential to activation of the TLR3 34 pathway. To determine if poly(I:C) is recognized by a cell surface receptor or an 35 internal receptor, such as TLR3, in bat cells, we quantified IFN\u03b2 transcripts in Efk3 36 cells after transfecting or adding poly(I:C) to culture medium. Adding poly(I:C) to the 37 culture medium did not upregulate IFN\u03b2 transcripts in Efk3 cells, whereas 38 transfecting poly(I:C) induced several thousand folds of IFN\u03b2 transcripts (S3. c-Rel siRNA shuts down expression of HA-tagged c-Rel. To study the 50 knockdown potential of c-Rel siRNA at a protein level, we simultaneously transfected 51 HEK293T cells with siRNA specific to c-Rel, non-specific scrambled siRNA (NC 52 siRNA) or no siRNA and plasmids expressing HA-tagged c-Rel. (a) siRNA specific 53 to c-Rel completely shuts down the expression of HA-c-Rel from the plasmid. In 54 contrast, cells transfected with NC siRNA or no siRNA express HA-c-Rel. (b) There 55 was no change in GAPDH expression between different treatments. Mutations in the c-Rel Rel homology domain (RHD). Zhang et al. show 64 that 4 mutations specific to bat c-Rel exist in the downstream region of the RHD 1 . 65 I\u03baB binding domain is located in the downstream region of the RHD and Zhang et al. 66 propose mutations in this region can affect I\u03baB binding. Differences in amino acids 67 between bat RHD domains and those of other representative mammals are 68 S5. qRT-PCR products from ChIP assay were electrophoresed on 81 separate gels.
