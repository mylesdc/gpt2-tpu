This combination of chimeric mAbs when administered passively, pre or post challenge with 10 MLD50 (50% mouse lethal dose) HPAI H5N1 influenza A viruses could protect 100% of the mice from two different clades of viruses (clades 1 and 2.1). We also tested the efficacy of a single dose of the combination of mAbs versus two doses. Two doses of the combination therapy not only affected early clearance of the virus from the lung but could completely prevent lung pathology of the H5N1 infected mice. No escape variants were detected after therapy.",

Present vaccine strategies have been hindered by antigenic variation of the influenza strains [1] . Vaccine strategies requiring endogenous synthesis of antibodies will not provide the immediate protection needed against H5N1 infections in the event of a pandemic. Antiviral therapy has received much attention during these situations. However, currently available anti-viral treatment options are limited [2] . Isolation of drug-resistant viral strains [3, 4] in the recent past warrants an urgent need for alternative strategies for treatment and prophylaxis. Passive administration of antibodies against neutralizing epitopes of H5N1 may be an attractive alternative to active vaccination of humans, in particular for those individuals who are at high risk from influenza infection, viz. the immuno-compromised patients or the elderly who do not respond well to active immunization [5] .",

Passive administration of polyclonal antibodies against H5N1 has been shown to be protective in several non-primate and human models of infection [6] . Passive immunization by transfusion of human convalescent sera was associated with 50% reduction in mortality during an influenza pandemic and was shown to be effective against H5N1 influenza A viral infection [6, 7] . Equine F (ab') 2 fragments specific for H5N1 have been used for efficacious prophylaxis and therapy in a mouse model [8] . Murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against fusion peptide of hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 influenza have been shown in passive transfer experiments to protect mice from infection by reduction of viral replication [9] . Thus passive administration of mAbs prior to or after influenza infection has the potential advantage of providing high titers of antibodies to susceptible individuals immediately. Murine mAbs were used in initial clinical trials. The efficacy of these mAbs was hampered by several problems including their diminished serum half-life and the development of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) [10] . To counter this problem, several strategies have been devised including the generation of chimeric, humanized and human mAbs.",

Passive immunoprophylaxis and therapy with a single neutralizing humanized or human mAb was efficacious against lethal challenge with specific strains of H5N1 virus [11, 12] . It is important that any mAb product should offer broad protection against all circulating strains of H5N1 influenza and should prevent the selection of neutralization escape mutants in vivo.

These include inclusion of an ideal pair of complementing monoclonal antibodies, optimizing the number of doses, time intervals in between doses and the duration of therapy. The mAbs included in the combination therapy should target distinct regions on the antigen with non overlapping epitopes and should be able to complement each other in a treatment regimen [13, 14] . In the present study, we focus on the selection of a pair of mAbs against two different neutralizing epitopes of H5N1 and their chimerization. We evaluate the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the combination therapy using the chimeric mAbs in a murine model, experimentally challenged with two distinct phylogenetic clades of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. and H7N1 (A/common iora/Indonesia/F89/11/95) were obtained from the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) of Singapore. The H5N1 viruses from different phylogenetic clades/ subclades were rescued by Reverse Genetics [15] . Briefly, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of H5N1 viruses from clades 0, 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4, 7 and 8 (Table 1) were synthesized (GenScript, USA) based on the sequence from the NCBI influenza Database. The synthetic HA and NA genes were cloned into a dual-promoter plasmid for influenza A reverse genetics [15] . The dual-promoter plasmids were obtained from Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA. Reassortant viruses were rescued by transfecting plasmids containing HA and NA along with the remaining six influenza genes derived from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) into co-cultured 293T and MDCK cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Corp.). At 72 h post-transfection the culture medium was inoculated into embryonated eggs or MDCK cells. The HA and NA genes of reassortant viruses from the second passage were sequenced to confirm presence of introduced HA and NA genes and the absence of mutations. Stock viruses were propagated in the allantoic cavity of 11 day-old embryonated eggs [16] , virus containing allantoic fluid was harvested and stored in aliquots at 280uC. Virus content was determined by standard hemagglutination (HA) assay [17] . All experiments with highly pathogenic viruses were conducted in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment facility in compliance with CDC/NIH and WHO recommendations [18, 19] .",

However, whenever immediate protection becomes essential and there is no time to induce an antibody response, the best alternative so far is passive immunization.

A single monoclonal antibody may not be sufficient to protect against all circulating strains [33] . Also, utilizing a single mAb against one epitope can result in selective pressure-induced ''escape'' of the virus through point mutations that can alter antibody binding [14] . The above mentioned studies with H5N1 infections have not looked into this aspect in great detail. In view of the proven efficiency of passive prophylaxis and therapy of H5N1 infection in animal models using single mAbs, we evaluated the prospect of using a combination of monoclonal antibodies to tackle the issues posed by using single mAbs as therapy. As is evident from our studies, the synergistic action of two or more mAbs in combination is required for preventing the generation of escape mutants and also to enhance the therapeutic efficacy against H5N1 infection.",

However, when the combination of mAbs was used under the same conditions of viral challenge, only 5 mg/kg of a single dose or 2.5 mg/kg of the double dose was needed to offer complete protection. Administration of two doses of the combination showed better protection as the viral loads in the lungs were significantly reduced when compared to administration of a single dose.

However, using two monoclonal antibodies in combination also showed the generation of escape mutants whenever sub-neutralizing concentrations of mAbs were used. Using higher concentrations in a single dose (5 mg/kg) reduced this possibility. This may have been dependent on the amount of the complementary circulating mAb present in the system which could effectively neutralize the escape mutants due to any one of the mAb. Based on the evidence from the body weight of the mice, the mice were healthy enough from the single administration for the escape mutants to be cleared by the active immune system of the mice. Given that the half life of the mAbs is limited, it is evident as to why two doses of the mAb combination worked in a much better way and provided better safety against the emergence of escape variants. The high rate of emergence of escape mutants to these viruses are evidence that the antibodies are highly neutralizing and hence forcing the viruses to adapt. But the fact that using both ch-mAbs in combination in two doses did not give rise to any escape mutants is proof that the antibodies are complementary and hence offer complete protection to the mice.",
