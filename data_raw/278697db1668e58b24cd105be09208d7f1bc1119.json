Although there is growing body of literature from low income settings, still information remains inadequate about the contribution of respiratory viruses to severe childhood respiratory illness. Data about the incidence of hospitalization may help health officials explore the potential value of targeting influenza vaccines to specific subpopulations presumed to be at higher risk of severe influenza illness in countries like Bangladesh where there is still no uniform policy guideline for influenza vaccination. In addition these data may help prioritize the development of vaccines for other respiratory viruses including RSV and parainfluenza viruses. Data on incidence of respiratory virus associated pediatric hospitalization are also necessary to estimate the total direct and indirect cost of hospitalization and the burden on the health care delivery system associated with childhood respiratory illness. We combined health utilization survey and hospital based surveillance data to estimate the incidence of respiratory virus infection among children aged <5years hospitalized with respiratory illness in Bangladesh.",

We plotted the randomly generated coordinates on Google\u2122 map to locate each area. Our field team used handheld GPS devices to reach the coordinates. Once the field team reached the location of the GPS coordinates, the household in the immediate vicinity was selected as the first household for enrolment. Our field team then skipped the next two closest households on the right of the first enrolled household and selected the third household for enrolment.

Then we combined the random samples from the 12 months of a year to obtain a nonparametric bootstrap sample and estimated the parameters of interest (e.g. number of children hospitalized with respiratory illness and the number of children hospitalized with RSV-associated respiratory illness on a specific month). We repeated the three steps 10,000 times and took the 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentiles from the estimated values of the parameter to calculate the 95% CI for the parameter [23] . In calculating the 95% CI we assumed that the number of samples collected on the specific sampling day each week would be similar if we collected samples every day of the week and could not account for the potential daily variability. In addition, our equation for analyses was stratified by month assuming that the four days selected for each month were representative of all the other days in a month. We also assumed the proportion of samples testing positive was sufficiently captured by the four monthly days of sampling and were representative for that month when indeed, there may have been greater variability unaccounted for within the month.",

Children were hospitalized a median of 3 days (IQR 2-4 days) after symptoms onset and remained hospitalized for a median of 2 days (IQR 0-4 days). The main clinical symptoms and signs of case-patients as reported by the attending physicians were cough (99%), difficulty breathing (87%), measured fever (84%), runny nose (65%), chest indrawing (65%), crepitation (48%), ronchi (46%) and wheezing (35%). Family members of 25 children (3%) reported that their child had previous history of asthma/recurrent wheeze.

In addition 15% of the enrolled children with respiratory symptoms were also positive for more than one virus and almost 30% (27 of 95) of the respiratory specimens positive for viral co-infection were parainfluenza virus with adenovirus or rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus with adenovirus or rhinovirus. Hospitalized children aged less than six months most commonly had laboratory-confirmed RSV (129 of 459, 28%) (Fig 1) .

Despite the small numbers of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases enrolled in this surveillance project, 35% (20 of 57) of all influenza positive children were aged <6 months. Unlike RSV, influenza is a vaccine preventable disease and maternal immunization against influenza protects children against influenza illness until they are eligible for vaccination at age 6 months [36] [37] [38] . Influenza vaccines are not routinely used in Bangladesh. Studies to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of immunization of pregnant women to prevent influenza among mothers and their infants aged <6 months may help public health officials explore the potential value of vaccinating pregnant women in Bangladesh.",

The detection rate of HMPV, however, was 13% among hospitalized children with respiratory illness in neighboring India [43] and could be higher because of annual variation in viral activity.

            "text": "As the surveillance was conducted only one day per week, the small number of sampled children limited our capacity to estimate precisely the total number of children that may have been hospitalized with respiratory illness. We did, however, account for the sampling fraction in our analyses and in addition the surveillance was conducted for five years which we believe contributed to generating credible estimates. We did not account for children who did not seek care at any hospital and who manifested differently from the surveillance systems' case-definition. Our case definition included any two of the following symptoms: fever, cough and difficulty in breathing and it is likely that we missed children with ARI having high fever and runny nose. However a previous prospective population based study from our group showed that 100% of children with physician diagnosed pneumonia had cough and fever and >80% of the children had difficulty in breathing [13] . As the primary objective of the study was to estimate the burden of severe viral respiratory illness, inclusion of any two of the above mentioned symptoms in the case definition might have captured majority of the children with ALRI requiring admitted care on the sampling days. Our rates were comparable to a populationbased study conducted in rural Bangladesh [44] . We considered the primary catchment areas of the hospitals to be areas where >60% of the patients resided which was an arbitrary cut-off. This cut off was chosen to balance the selection of sufficient cases from a large enough catchment area with the ability to precisely determine the proportion seeking care at the surveillance hospital versus another hospital. Choosing a very small proportion would have meant we had to canvas a very large catchment area to obtain a relatively small proportion of persons seeking care at the sentinel site and choosing a large proportion would have severely restricted the population at risk and the number of respiratory illness events; both extremes could have threatened the precision of our rate estimates. The health utilization survey was only done once in 2013, however we are not aware of any changes in health seeking behavior in Bangladesh and it is unlikely that proportion of children seeking care at the surveillance hospitals would have changed over time. Health care utilization is also limited by the capacity of the health system to provide care to the population. In Bangladesh there are 11 patients admitted for every 10 beds. [45] . We identified from the health utilization survey and surveillance that male children were hospitalized more frequently than female children which may have led to underestimation of the rates of severe respiratory illness among girls in the community. Although health seeking behavior in Bangladesh is skewed towards the male gender [46] , male sex has also been identified as a risk factor for severe respiratory infection [44] . Also the surveillance hospitals were chosen from geographically diverse locations, our estimated rates were based on only four sites and the rate of respiratory viral infections among hospitalized children were likely different in other areas within Bangladesh; especially in the more densely populated urban areas of the country and thus our rates must be interpreted with caution. We used PCR technology to detect viruses which only confirms infection with a virus and does not confirm disease causation. We did not subtype the samples that were positive for rhinovirus. Indeed rhino virus subtype C has been associated with severe illness [47] . This limits our capacity to draw inference regarding the presence of rhinovirus and severity of respiratory illness in children. We also did not test the respiratory specimens for other viruses such as coronavirus, enterovirus or bocavirus which have been associated to respiratory illness. However due to logistical constraints, we were primarily interested in the viruses that were frequently associated with lower respiratory infections in children [48] . In addition we did not follow the asymptomatic children while they were hospitalized to see if they subsequently developed respiratory symptoms due to logistical constraints which may partly explain the high detection rate of rhinovirus and adenovirus among asymptomatic children. Lastly, we do not have the data on how many patients declined to participate, but the number of non-response was probably minimal. The children were already hospitalized and we only collected nasal and throat swabs from them through minimally invasive procedure so we believe unwillingness to participate in the surveillance might have been negligible.",
