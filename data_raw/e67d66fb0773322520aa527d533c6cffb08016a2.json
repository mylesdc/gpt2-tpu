This hypothesis was tested by using KO piglets that were challenged with PEDV. Two single-guide RNAs targeting the CMAH gene and Cas9 mRNA were microinjected into the cytoplasm of newly fertilized eggs. Four live founders generated and proven to be biallelic KO, lacking detectable Nglycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA). The founders were bred, and homozygous offspring were obtained. Two-day-old (in exps. I, n = 6, and III, n = 15) and 3-day-old (in exp. II, n = 9) KO and wild-type (WT, same ages in respective exps.) piglets were inoculated with TCID 50 1x10 3 PEDV and then fed 20 mL of infant formula (in exps. I and II) or sow's colostrum (in exp. III) every 4 hours. In exp. III, the colostrum was offered 6 times and was then replaced with Ringer/5% glucose solution. At 72 hours post-PEDV inoculation (hpi), the animals either deceased or euthanized were necropsied and intestines were sampled. In all 3 experiments, the piglets showed apparent outward clinical manifestations suggesting that infection occurred despite the CMAH KO. In exp. I, all 6 WT piglets and only 1 of 6 KO piglets died at 72 hpi. Histopathology and immunofluorescence staining showed that the villus epithelial cells of WT piglets were severely exfoliated, but only moderate exfoliation and enterocyte PLOS ONE | https://doi., all to CFT) were provided by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, ROC to support the research and salaries for the author of vacuolization was observed in KO piglets. In exp. II, delayed clinical symptoms appeared, yet the immunofluorescence staining/histopathologic inspection (I/H) scores of the two groups differed little. In exp. III, the animals exhibited clinical and pathological signs after inoculation similar to those in exp. II. These results suggest that porcine CMAH KO with nullified NGNA expression are not immune to PEDV but that this KO may lessen the severity of the infection and delay its occurrence.",

Since then, PEDV-associated diarrhoea has been widely detected in Europe. In Asia, it was reported in 1982 [3] , and it has subsequently greatly impacted the Asian pork industry. In China during 2010 and 2011, over one million nursing piglets were lost due to PEDV-associated diarrhoea [4] ; in 2013, PEDV emerged in Korea and the USA [5] [6] [7] as well as in Taiwan [8] , causing great economic losses and continuing to spread as an epidemic.",

The PEDV genome consists of a positive singlestranded RNA approximately 28 kb in length that contains 7 open reading frames (ORF), including ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF2-6 [9] . The viral particles are coated with S-protein, a type I membrane protein. The protein forms spikes on the viral surface that are used to infect host cells and also bears highly antigenic domains and could theoretically be used to develop a high-titre neutralizing PEDV vaccine [6, 10] . However, Sun et al. [11] found that the sequence of this region is highly variable, a characteristic that is likely to reduce the efficiency of conventional commercial vaccines. Furthermore, the S-protein is a glycoprotein that undergoes complicated post-translational modifications that result in antigen diversity and create obstacles to the development of a PEDV vaccine [10] .",

            "text": "The pathway of PEDV infection occurs mainly through the S-protein. PEDV first contacts sialic acids (neuraminic acid, NA) in host intestine [12] and then infects the villi by binding to aminopeptidase N (APN) on epithelial cells [13, 14] . These findings suggest that NA is the first glycoprotein receptor and that APN is the second one for PEDV during infection of the host intestine [15] . A similar process occurs during infection by TGEV [12] ; on the other hand, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) loses its ability to infect the host intestine due to mutation and deletion of the S-protein genomic region occur [16] . Since viral genomic sequences of S-protein are generally variable and unstable, but in mammals, e.g., pigs, the codon sequences of their receptor are more stable and allow to be manipulated specifically by gene editing (GE). As mentioned above, PEDV infects the host via NA and APN, and NA has been shown to play an important role in host immune function and infection by pathogens [17, 18] . Human cells synthesize N-acetyl NA (NANA) but not N-glycolyl NA (NGNA), due to CMP-N-glycolylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) insert an oxygen into the acetyl group of NANA converted to the glycolyl of NGNA [19] and the human CMAH gene has mutated during 2.5-3.0 million years of evolution [17] . We suggest that, analogous to the way in which human evolution has eliminated the NGNA receptor for PEDV, the CMAH gene of domestic pigs might be artificially mutated by gene editing technology to produce resistance to PEDV infection. The APN gene is not proposed as a target because it is essential for dipeptide digestion and amino acid absorption.",

Due to the availability of convenient techniques for constructing and editing vectors and the fact that Cas9 is a universal enzyme that can be constructed separately to guide/target vectors, use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for GE is currently more popular than use of the ZFN and TALEN systems. Furthermore, GE can be simultaneously conducted on multiple sites or genes with the same Cas9 to achieve different targeting purposes or reduce the risks of off-targeting [23] [24] [25] . We have established TALEN [26] and CRISPR/Cas9 [27, 28] systems for direct microinjection of GE vectors to generate \u03b11, 3-galactosyltransferase (GGTA1) mutant pigs. In this study, direct microinjection of two single-guide RNA and Cas9 mRNA vectors into the cytoplasm of pronuclear porcine embryos was used to generate CMAH mutant pigs with null expression of NGNA, and the possibility of obtaining mutant piglets that are resistant to infection by PEDV was examined.",

Almost all of the affected oneweek-old piglets died of watery diarrhoea. The aetiology of the disease was confirmed to be a virulent strain of PEDV (it was thereafter designated the Jimei strain); the sequence of this strain is almost identical to that of the strain that caused the epidemic outbreak of PEDV in the US in 2014 [31] . Although nv-PEDV can replicate in the Vero cell line, the nv-PEDV used in the challenge was prepared by oral inoculation of new born piglets that had not received colostrum to maintain its pathogenicity. The piglets were raised in a warm isolated chamber and were hand-fed fresh milk every six hours. Diarrhoea began to occur at 16-20 h after viral inoculation. The piglets were sacrificed 16-24 h after the observation of diarrhoea symptoms. The small intestinal content was collected by injection of 50 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10x P/S into the lumen followed by massage and extrusion from one end to the other end. The intestinal content was filtered through stainless mesh to clarify the content. Finally, the sample was centrifuged at 3000xg to precipitate all cellular debris, and the supernatant was collected and divided into 5-mL portions in sterile conical tubes. Three small fragments of intestine were subjected to paraffin-embedded tissue sectioning and IHC to confirm the presence of PEDV in intestinal epithelial cells (TGEV and rotavirus detection was also performed, and both tests were negative). A TCID 50 was used according to standard virological methods to determine the viral content of the Jimei PEDV virus preparation used in the challenge study [32] . The virus was maintained at -80\u02daC until the challenge study was performed. Inoculation of the animals with PEDV was conducted as described by Jung et al. [7] . In brief, 10 3 TCID 50 /mL of frozen nv-PEDV stock was thawed at hand temperature, and 10 mL of the thawed stock was mixed with 90 mL of reconstituted commercial baby milk or sow's milk by repeatedly inverting the container. The CMAH mutant and wild-type piglets were inoculated with 10 3 TCID 50 /10 mL PEDV orally by hand using a syringe.",

PEDV mainly infects the epithelial cells that form the mucosa of the small intestine. Each part of the small intestine was evaluated at three different locations and their mean represented one piglet data. In the early stage of PEDV infection, only IF staining allows us to observe whether or not epithelial cells have been infected by PEDV. Therefore, at that stage, the percentage of IF-positive cells was the only criterion used to determine the severity of PEDV infection. However, in the middle to late stages of infection, the severity of PEDV infection is better judged by the degree of villar atrophy because infected cells often defoliate from the mucosa and IF may not reveal the PEDVinfected cells. Therefore, the lesions were scored from 1 to 5 as shown in Fig 2C; the scores combined the results of both IF staining and histopathological inspection in an I/H score that was used in the final statistical analysis.",

Five live piglets and 1 stillborn piglet were delivered by one pregnant sow (Table 2 ). PCR analysis of CMAH KO revealed that 1 male (L667-02) and 3 females (L667-10, -11, and -12) (Fig 3A) carried 161-bp deletion mutations (Fig 3B) . Further analysis by PCR-directive sequencing (PDS) and subcloning of PCR products in T-A cloning vectors and sequencing (PTS) showed that the 4 live piglets and the stillborn piglet were biallelic CMAH mutants; of these, L667-02 was biallelic 161-bp deleted (D/D type) ( Fig  4A) , L667-10, -11 and -12 were mosaic with D/D type and 2 sites mutated (D/D and D/M types) (Fig 4A-4C) , and the stillborn animal (L667-D) had a single base mutation and a 5-bp insertion at site I and a 5-bp deletion at site II (M/M type) (Fig 4B and 4C ). The efficiency of gene editing and KO was 7.5% based on the number of manipulated embryos and 83.3% based on the number of delivered piglets, all of which were biallelic mutants ( Table 2 ). The animals used for PEDV challenge were obtained by breeding the three founders (L667-10, 11 and 12) with the founder boar (L667-02). The mutational status of their offspring (Table 3) was confirmed by PCR, PDS and PTS (S2-S4 Figs). All piglets were rapidly screened by PCR, and D/D piglets were preferentially used in the experiments. In exps. II and III, the D/ D piglets were supplemented with 1 and 3 D/M type piglets, respectively ( Table 4 ) that were confirmed by PTS to have 1-bp insertions or 14-or 2-bp deletions at site I on the mutated chromosome (S2-S4 Figs) . The null expression of the CMAH gene was analysed based on the detection of NGNA/NANA by HPLC; the results showed that all founders (Fig 5) and their Gene-edited CMAH mutant piglets display decreased porcine epidemic diarrhoea susceptibility Gene-edited CMAH mutant piglets display decreased porcine epidemic diarrhoea susceptibility vomiting and diarrhoea at 12 hours post-inoculation (hpi), and their activity also decreased ( Table 5 ). In the WT group, the first piglet's death occurred at 44 hpi; a second animal died at 52 hpi, a third at 68 hpi, and the remaining three animals were moribund and nearly dead at 72 hpi (Fig 6A) . In the CMAH KO group, the first piglet died at 60 hpi, 3 piglets were moribund at 72 hpi, and the other remaining two piglets survived until the end of the trial (Fig 6A  and Table 5 ). After nv-PEDV inoculation, the loss of body weight of WT piglets was 0.69\u00b10.04 kg, significantly (p<0.01) greater than that of CMAH KO piglets (0.45\u00b10.03 kg) (Fig 7A) . Exp.

In the WT group, the first death occurred at 40 hpi ( Fig 6B) ; two piglets were lost at 48 hpi, 4 piglets died at 56 hpi, and the remaining two piglets were alive at the end of the trial. In the CMAH KO group, the first animal was lost at 44 hpi, and 3, 3, 1 and 1 piglets died at 52, 56, 64 and 68 hpi, respectively (Fig 6B) . There was no significant difference (Fig 7B) .",

From 4 to 24 hpi, all piglets were fed their own dams' whole or skim milk; the results show that all piglets displayed decreased activity and diarrhoea without a significant difference between CMAH KO and WT piglets. One moribund CMAH KO piglet was observed at 44 hpi, and one moribund WT piglet was observed at 56 hpi; all of the piglets stopped vomiting after 24 hpi. After the sow's milk was replaced with RLG, all piglets (both CMAH KO and WT) showed sustained activity and viability at least until 56 hpi, with the exception of one CMAH KO piglet that died prior to the end of the trial (Table 6 ).",

Grossly, the small intestine appeared transparent and orange-yellow to flesh pink in colour; it was thin-walled and dilated with fluid content in the live piglets (S6A and S6B Fig). In exp. I, the PEDV induced histopathologic changes, including enterocyte necrosis, degeneration, and exfoliation, and collapsed lamina proprial tissues containing karyorrhectic debris, were noted in all challenged piglets. However, these lesions varied from mild to severe, and the lesions were more severe in the moribund WT piglets than in the CMAH KO piglets (Fig 8) . Immunofluorescence (IF) staining with a monoclonal antibody against PEDV nuclear protein was used to detect PEDV antigens. The results showed that PEDV antigen was presented in the epithelium covering the moderately atrophic tips of villi in the small intestine of WT and CMAH KO piglets (Fig 9) . However, if the epithelial cells were defoliated from the villi after PEDV infection, no positive signals would be expected (Fig 9A) . We further scored the severity of lesions in the intestines of the infected animals (Fig 2) by a combination of IF staining and histopathological inspection (immuno/histopathological, I/H, score). According to I/H scores, results revealed that the severity of the intestinal lesions in KO (Table 7 ). In exp. III, even ruling out the possible effects of feeding the animals with commercial baby cow milk, we also found no significant difference in I/H scores of WT and CMAH KO piglets (Table 8 ). According to the I/H scores obtained at 72 hpi, which ranged from 3.8\u00b10.4 to 3.2\u00b10.5 in CMAH KO piglets and from 2.8 \u00b10.4 to 2.5\u00b10.2 in WT piglets (p>0.05), most piglets seemed to improve compared with those at 24 and 48 hpi when offered sow's milk and supplemental lactated Ringer's solution containing 5% glucose (Table 8 ).

            "text": "Currently, gene editing is widely used in both basic and applied studies, e.g., in studies of the disease resistance of farm animals [33] . One convincing report showed that CD163 geneedited pigs generated by CRISPR/Cas9 exhibited physiological normality and showed little vulnerability to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection either in vitro [34] or in vivo [35] [36] [37] . However, other attempts, including putative receptors of CD169 KO and CD163 KO, failed to produce evident resistance to PRRSV [38] or African swine fever [39] , respectively. These failures may have occurred because the mechanism of viral infection involves other receptors or because it does not involve receptors [38] . The hypothesis that the absence of NGNA expression in CMAH KO piglets disables PEDV infection was partially proven in this study. In exp. I, 2-day-old old piglets were orally inoculated with the local outbreak strain nv-PEDV [31] . Although the final (72 hpi) survival rate differed little in the WT and KO animals, based on the histopathologic examination and considering the 3 deadly moribund WT piglets, the CMAH KO piglets showed greater resistance to nv-PEDV infection than the WT animals. This assumption is supported by the high degree of histopathologic severity found in the WT piglets, which clearly differed from that observed in the CMAH KO piglets. However, when 3-day-old piglets were used, no differences between CMAH KO and WT piglets were observed. It is doubtful that the NGNA present in cow's milk-based formula would enable the virus to infect the CMAH KO piglets. In exp. III, colostrum from the KO or WT sows was given to avoid any possible NGNA inference, yet the final susceptibilities of the two genotypes were similar, due to no or little NGNA (S7 Fig). However, at least 3 of the 11 CMAH KO piglets showed normal activity and no clinical signs (no vomiting or diarrhoea) at 12 hpi, whereas the WT piglets displayed vomiting and/or diarrhoea. Lessened severity was therefore observed.",

            "text": "Considering that transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and other coronaviruses use sialic acid (neuraminic acid, NA) and APN as their first [12, 15] and second receptors [13, 15] , PEDV might act in a similar manner. Recently, the domain VII of APN was suggested to play a critical role for PEDV binding [40] ; yet, when the ANPEP (APN) was null mutated by using CRISPR/Cas9 editing, the KO piglets though not infected by TGEV but still vulnerable to PEDV [41] . We found the major components of porcine mucin in the small intestinal submucosa are two types of NA, N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA) (unpublished data). Using a glycan screening array, Liu et al. [42] showed that Neu5Ac (or NANA) has the highest binding affinity for PEDV S1-NTD-CTD; however, they also found that porcine mucin or bovine mucin could inhibit or block in vitro PEDV and TGEV infection of PK-15 or Huh-7 cells which transfected with porcine APN. The present results show that CMAH KO piglets exhibited delayed infection and minor symptoms after oral PEDV inoculation, suggesting that in CMAH KO piglets that are normally nursed, PEDV [35] [36] [37] and TGEV [12, 15, 41] , but not true for PEDV, might be through a more complicate mechanism other than receptors [43] . It is known that PEDV causes severe enteric disease in suckling piglets [44, 45] and less severe disease in older weaned pigs [46] . Our results suggest that the differentiation might occur as early as in the neonatal period; clinical diarrhoea and/or vomiting and decreased activity were observed in all 2-day-old piglets but improved in 3-day-old piglets. When caesarean-delivered and colostrum-deprived (CDCD) animals were used for oral inoculation of PEDV, the 1-day-old piglets showed clinical signs at 12 hpi [47] ; this was also observed in our study using naturally delivered piglets. Furthermore, in PEDV inoculation studies, 5-day-old CDCD piglets were more sensitive than 21-day-old weaned piglets [32] . Similarly, naturally delivered 9-day-old suckling piglets showed a weaker innate immune response to PEDV than weaned pigs [48] . This study used 2-or 3-day-old piglets that were naturally delivered and nursed with colostrum by CMAH KO or WT sows prior to PEDV oral inoculation in an attempt to realize the protective effects of nursing in animals in which the biallelic CMAH genes were mutated. In exp. III, the clinical symptoms of 2-day-old piglets that were PEDV inoculated and hand fed whole or skim sow's milk for an additional 24 h were similar to those of the 3-day-old piglets in exp. II. Furthermore, when lactated Ringer's solution supplemented with 5% glucose was offered from 24 to 72 hpi, the epithelial cells of the villi showed less damage and/or showed increased recovery of epithelial cells from the crypts according to the I/H scores, which ranged from 4.0 \u00b1 0.0 to 2.5 \u00b1 0.2 in WT piglets and from 5.0 \u00b1 0.0 to 3.2 \u00b1 0.5 in the KO group. This benefit of oral rehydration therapy in acute viral diarrhoea could be attributed to glucose-facilitated sodium absorption [49] and to alleviate Na + -K + -ATPase and Ca 2 + -Mg 2+ -ATPase damage [50] . Currently, the model may be improved by inoculating the piglets and allowed them to be continually nursed by dams of the same genotype to avoid NGNA interference.",

Our unpublished data also revealed that the acellular extracellular matrix derived from the intestine of CMAH KO pigs caused significantly less inflammation than that obtained from WT pigs after intramuscular implantation into CMAH/GGAT1 double KO pigs. Furthermore, NGNA present in red meat has been suggested to be a risk factor for human colorectal cancer and atherosclerosis in persons who habitually consume red meat [52] . Therefore, CMAH mutant pigs generated by GE can be viewed as pigs that offer a source of healthy red meat and of material that is suitable for use in biomedical devices.",
