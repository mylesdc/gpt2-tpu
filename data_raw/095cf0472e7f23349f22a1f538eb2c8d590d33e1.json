This study describes the clinical features and outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in hospitalized patients in Egypt. Methods: SARI surveillance was implemented at Cairo University Hospital (CUH) during the period 2010-2014. All hospitalized patients meeting the WHO case definition for SARI were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/ OP) swabs were collected and samples were tested using RT-PCR for influenza A, B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV 1,2,3,4), adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and atypical bacteria. Data were analyzed to calculate positivity rates for viral pathogens and determine which pathogens related to severe outcomes or resulted in death. Results: Overall, 1,075/3,207 (33.5%) cases had a viral etiology, with a mean age of 5.74 (\u00b113.87) years. The highest rates were reported for RSV (485 cases, 45.2%), PIV (125, 11.6%), and adenovirus (105, 9.8%). Children had a higher viral rate (981, 91.2%) compared to 94 (8.8%) cases in adults. Patients with identified viruses had significantly lower rates for ICU admission, hospital stay, mechanical ventilation, and overall mortality than those without identified viruses. No infections were independently associated with severe outcomes. Conclusions: Viral pathogens were encountered in one-third of hospitalized adult and pediatric Egyptian patients with SARI, while atypical bacteria had a minor role. Highest rates of viral infections were reported for RSV, PIV, and adenovirus. Viral infections had neither negative impacts on clinical features nor outcomes of patients with SARI in our locality.",

Viruses are responsible for 30-70 % of ARI where respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), human Bocavirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus and Coronaviruses account for the majority of these cases [1, 2] . The 2009 influenza pandemic had highlighted the need for more global data on severe influenza disease, so the WHO recommended conducting surveillance for hospitalized severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), as well as influenza-like illness (ILI) in outpatients [3] [4] [5] [6] . SARI surveillances are now conducted in many countries around the world; however, because of limited resources, they are only conducted in limited settings in the Middle East and Egypt [7] [8] [9] . Furthermore, the role of individual viral or atypical bacterial infection in causing ARI is not usually documented [10, 11] .",

Due to an annual review by dedicated investigators and updates to WHO guidelines, the case definition for SARI has evolved over the study period. Before February 2010, as a global-surveillance case definition of SARI did not exist, the definition for SARI was adapted from the WHO protocol on rapid response for persons \u22655 years old [3] . Whereas, for children <5 years old, SARI definition was adapted from the program for Integrated Management of Childhood Illness [4] . After March 2011, the global standards and tools for influenza surveillance developed by the WHO were adopted [5] . As of January 2014, the WHO surveillance case definitions for SARI was implemented [6] as follows, acute respiratory infection with history of fever or measured fever of \u2265 38 C\u00b0; and cough; with onset within the last 10 days; and requiring hospitalization [6] . An enrollment form was used to collect data from enrolled eligible patients including patient demographics, medical history, clinical signs and symptoms, comorbidities, reported influenza vaccine status, recent travel history, treatment, clinical course, and outcome.

Not unexpected, RSV was the most predominant respiratory virus with a prevalence of 45%; emphasizing its role as the major cause of SARI in infants and young children worldwide [7, 8, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Notably, the proportion of SARI cases positive for RSV in children <5 years in our surveillance (90%) was markedly higher than those reported in surveillance data from Kenya, 21% [11] , Southern Arizona, 31% [14] , and even higher than previous studies in Egypt [18] . We observed that, SARI cases <5 years were significantly more likely than older patients to be infected with each of the pathogens examined, particularly for RSV and influenza. As the majority of enrolled patients were children (83%), this is not unexpected since these pathogens have a strong association with this age group. This is inconsistent with data that nearly 80% of children are exposed to RSV by age two, 100% to hMPV by age five and 90% to hPIV by age five [19] . Furthermore, hPIV is a significant etiology of LRTI in children [20] , second only to RSV [21] , and adenoviruses are the second most [7] . Notably, our results showed a very minor role for atypical bacteria in causing SARI in our locality. Only 3 cases were positive for Mycoplasma (co-infected with RSV), while only one case of Chlamydia was co-infected with RSV and hMPV. Clinical presentations differed significantly between those with non-viral infected individuals and viral-infected SARI ones. The later had significant viral prodromal symptoms, as well as tachypnea, wheezes, and convulsions. Furthermore, SARI patients with influenza had significant tachypnea, wheezes, and abnormal breath sounds, than those with non-influenza viral infections. The presence of these signs at presentation could help the clinician predicting the likely pathogen causing SARI [14] .",

This study has many points of strength; it was the first surveillance that addresses the clinical impacts and epidemiological patterns of viral and atypical bacteria causing SARI in both children and adult Egyptian population, with enrolled large numbers of patients and over a relatively long period. Furthermore, analyses of homogenous populations, rather than different ethnic groups [14] , give the results reliable and strong support.

Atypical bacteria had a minor role in SARI in our locality. Highest rates of viral infections were reported for RSV, PIV, and adenovirus. The presence of chronic respiratory, endocrine, hepatic and neuromuscular disorders negatively affects patients with identified viral infections. Viral infections had no negative impacts on clinical features, clinical course, and severe outcomes of SARI in our locality. Further studies are warranted. ",
