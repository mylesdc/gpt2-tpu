Studies with type I interferon (IFN-I) receptor (IFNAR)-deficient mice revealed a key role of the IFN-I axis in the protection against CVB3 infection, whereas the source of IFN-I and cell types that have to be IFNAR triggered in order to promote survival are still unknown. We found that CVB3 infected IFN-\u03b2 reporter mice showed effective reporter induction, especially in hepatocytes and only to a minor extent in liver-resident macrophages. Accordingly, upon in vitro CVB3 infection of primary hepatocytes from murine or human origin abundant IFN-\u03b2 responses were induced. To identify sites of IFNAR-triggering we performed experiments with Mx reporter mice, which upon CVB3 infection showed massive luciferase induction in the liver. Immunohistological studies revealed that during CVB3 infection MX1 expression of hepatocytes was induced primarily by IFNAR-, and not by IFN-III receptor (IFNLR)-triggering.

Interestingly, CVB3 infected mice with a hepatocyte-specific IFNAR ablation showed severe liver cell necrosis and ubiquitous viral dissemination that resulted in lethal disease, as similarly detected in classical IFNAR -/mice. In conclusion, we found that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes are major IFN-I producers and that the liver is also the organ that shows strong IFNAR-triggering. Importantly, hepatocytes need to be IFNAR-triggered in order to prevent virus dissemination and to assure survival. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that during CVB3 infection hepatocytes serve as important IFN-I producers and sensors not only in the murine, but also in the human system.",

Infections with CVB3 are mostly unnoticed or cause flu-like symptoms, however, they can also cause severe disease, such as myocarditis, pancreatitis, and hepatitis. Although CVB3 does not efficiently trigger plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are the main IFN-I producers in many other virus infections, IFNAR signaling plays a crucial role in CVB3 control. Therefore, we investigated which cells are stimulated to produce IFN-I following CVB3 infection and which cell types have to be IFNAR-triggered in order to confer antiviral protection. We found that upon CVB3 infection IFN-\u03b2 was mainly expressed within the liver, especially by hepatocytes and not by liver resident macrophages. This was corroborated by in vitro CVB3 infection experiments with primary murine and human hepatocytes. Interestingly, IFNAR signaling of hepatocytes was required to control the virus. Collectively, our data indicate that hepatocytes, and not immune cells, are the key innate effector cells that are relevant for the control of CVB3 infection.",

CVB3 infections are very common, especially in children and neonates, and mostly cause only mild disease. However, occasionally also severe disease with fatal outcome, such as myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, or hepatitis, can occur. In adults, only few cases of CVB3-induced hepatic necrosis have been reported [2, 3] , whereas in neonates CVB3-induced hepatitis is more frequent [4] . Especially in Taiwan several outbreaks of CVB3 infections with predominant hepatitis and occasionally lethal outcome of up to 30% have been reported [5] [6] [7] . Recently, the analysis of murine neonates revealed that increased susceptibility to CVB3 correlated with high expression of the Coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor in the liver, which decreased with age [8] . Moreover, lower expression of IFN-\u03b1 during the first year of human life might contribute to increased infection susceptibility in infants [9] .",

Already 1 day post infection (dpi) moderate luciferase induction was detected in the abdominal region, which reached a maximum 2 dpi and then declined (Fig 1A  and 1B ).

To more specifically identify tissues showing reporter expression, infected reporter mice were perfused with PBS, organs were dissected, and luciferase expression was analyzed ex vivo in organ homogenates. At 2 dpi, robust bioluminescent imaging signals were detected in liver and pancreas, whereas in secondary lymphatic organs, salivary gland, and heart less abundant signals were observed (Fig 1C) . To investigate the expression of IFN-I and IFN-III, organ homogenates were assessed by ELISA. Reminiscent to the in vivo imaging data, we found moderate amounts of IFN-I in spleen and maximal levels in cervical lymph nodes (cLN) 3 to 4 dpi (S1 Fig). In contrast, lysates of secondary lymphoid organs contained only minimal IFN-III levels (S1 Fig). In the liver, peak levels of IFN-I and IFN-III were detected 3 and 2 dpi, respectively (Fig 1D-1F ). In pancreas, maximal IFN-\u03b2 induction was observed 1 dpi, whereas IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-III peaked on 3 dpi (Fig 1D-1F) .

In line with previous reports [14] , constitutive expression of the reporter was observed in non-infected mice in the liver (Fig 3A) . Upon CVB3 infection, significant reporter gene induction was detected in the upper abdomen ( Fig  3A) . Notably, in CVB3 infected Mx2Luc mice the kinetics of the reporter induction in the upper abdominal region was similar to that detected in IFN-\u03b2 reporter mice (compare Fig 1A  and Fig 3A) . Ex vivo analysis revealed Mx2-dependent reporter induction in all organs analyzed with the highest values detected in the liver (Fig 3B) . To investigate Mx induction on the cellular level, Mx1 mice carrying a functional Mx1 gene were used [15] . In contrast to uninfected controls (S2A Fig) , CVB3-infected Mx1 mice showed MX1 protein induction in hepatocytes and bile duct cells 2 dpi ( Fig 3C) . Interestingly, no MX1 expression was detected in hepatocytes of CVB3-infected Mx1-IFNAR -/mice ( Fig 3C) indicating that in vivo IFNLR triggering of hepatocytes did not play a major role. In contrast, bile duct epithelial cells showed MX1 expression in CVB3-infected Mx1-IFNAR -/mice, which indicated triggering by locally produced IFN-III. MX1 expression in hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells in infected Mx1-IFNLR -/mice was similar to that detected in infected Mx1 mice ( Fig 3C) showing that both hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells responded to IFN-I. As expected, neither hepatocytes nor bile duct epithelial cells showed MX1 protein induction in CVB3-infected Mx1-IF-NAR -/-IFNLR -/mice ( Fig 3C) . Pancreatic acinar cells showed MX1 expression in infected Mx1-IFNLR -/-, but not in Mx1-IFNAR -/mice ( Fig 3C) . Thus, acinar cells responded to IFN-I, but not to IFN-III. In contrast, pancreatic duct epithelial cells showed MX1 protein induction in both Mx1-IFNLR -/and Mx1-IFNAR -/mice indicating that these cells responded to IFN-I and IFN-III ( Fig 3C) . Moreover, liver and pancreas of CVB3 infected as well as uninfected Mx1-WT, Mx1-IFNAR -/-, Mx1-IFNLR -/and Mx1-IFNAR -/-IFNLR -/mice were analyzed for ISG15 expression by immunohistology (S2B and S2C Fig) . These data revealed an overall very similar picture as the analysis of MX1 expression. Since Mx1-IFNLR -/mice were as resistant to CVB3 infection as Mx1 controls, whereas Mx1-IFNAR -/and Mx1-IFNAR -/-IFNLR -/mice succumbed to CVB3 infection (Fig 3D) , IFN-III did not seem to play a major role in the pathogenesis of murine CVB3 infection. Furthermore, histological analysis of the liver of infected Mx1-IFNLR -/mice did not reveal inflammation and necrosis (S3A and S3B Fig) . Taken together, CVB3 induces non-redundant IFNAR signaling in hepatocytes and acinar cells, whereas in bile duct epithelial cells and pancreatic duct epithelial cells concomitant IFNAR and IFNLR signaling was detected.",

Nevertheless, several WT control mice had to be sacrificed due to body weight loss of more than 20% (Fig 4A) . To investigate the impact of IFNAR signaling of myeloid cells within the liver, we generated LysM-Cre +/-IFNAR fl/fl mice with a selective IFNAR deletion in myeloid cells. Upon CVB3 infection, most of these mice appeared overall healthy during the observation period, whereas some mice had to be sacrificed due to body weight loss of more than 20% (Fig 4A) . Thus, IFNAR signaling in myeloid cells did not play a dominant role in the protection against CVB3 infection. Likewise, also Alb-Cre +/-IFNAR fl/fl mice with a hepatocyte-specific IFNAR-deletion were CVB3-infected and interestingly these mice showed a similarly enhanced sensitivity to CVB3 infection as detected in IFNAR -/mice ( Fig 4A) . In infected Alb-Cre +/-IFNAR fl/fl and IFNAR -/mice dramatically enhanced ALT levels were found (Fig 4B) , whereas infected WT controls and LysM-Cre +/-IFNAR fl/fl mice showed moderately increased ALT levels ( Fig 4B) . Thus, CVB3-induced hepatitis correlated with impaired IFNAR signaling of hepatocytes. In contrast, all mice of the different genotypes analyzed showed a similar extent of pancreatitis, as indicated by enhanced lipase levels, although the kinetics of lipase level increase was delayed in LysM-Cre +/-IFNAR fl/fl mice ( Fig 4B) . In conclusion, in WT mice the development of pancreatitis and massive pancreatic viral replication ( Fig 4C) were independent of functional IFNAR signaling.",

Of note, the preparation protocol yielded hepatocytes with a purity of approximately 90%, as determined by FACS analysis (S5A and S5B Fig) . Upon CVB3 infection, primary murine hepatocytes indeed showed Ifn-\u03b2 mRNA upregulation, whereas upregulation of Ifn-\u03b1 or Ifn-\u03bb2/3 mRNA was not detected (Fig 6A) . Moreover, also the expression of Isg15 was upregulated, indicating autocrine IFNAR triggering of the hepatocytes (Fig 6A) . In accordance with these results, IFN-\u03b2 but not IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03bb protein levels were detected in supernatants (Fig 6B) . To study conditions in the human system, primary human hepatocytes were CVB3 infected. Indeed, the virus replicated in these cells, as indicated by increased virus titers detected in the supernatant after 12, 24, and 48 hpi (S5D Fig) . Similar to primary murine hepatocytes, qPCR analysis of primary human hepatocytes 24 hr after CVB3 infection showed upregulation of Ifn\u03b2 and of Isg15 mRNA expression, but not of Ifn-\u03b1 mRNA expression (Fig 6C) . In contrast to murine hepatocytes, human hepatocytes additionally showed upregulated Ifn-\u03bb1 mRNA expression (Fig 6C) . This observation was in accordance with a previous study that showed IFN-\u03bb production of CVB3 infected primary human hepatocytes that conferred ISG induction and mediated antiviral protection [12] . We detected only very low amounts of IFN-\u03b2 protein Hepatocytes are key effector cells in anti-Coxsackievirus immunity in the supernatant of CVB3 infected primary human hepatocytes, while IFN-III levels were very abundant (Fig 6D and S5F Fig) .",

In control experiments human hepatocytes were stimulated with either 1 ng/mL recombinant IFN-\u03b2 or 100 U/mL IFN-\u03b1, or 10 ng/mL IFN-\u03bb1, 10 ng/mL IFN-\u03bb2, or 30 ng/mL IFN-\u03bb3 and treated with recombinant B18R and/or recombinant anti-interferon lambda receptor 1 antibody (\u03b1IFNLR). As expected, B18R and \u03b1IFNLR treatment efficiently inhibited IFN-I and IFN-III mediated Mx and ISG15 induction in hepatocytes, whereas B18R and/or \u03b1IFNLR treatment alone did not have any effect (S5C Fig). Next we CVB3 infected human hepatocytes for 2 hr, washed with PBS, treated with B18R and/or \u03b1IFNLR and then analyzed the RNA induction by qPCR. These experiments revealed that infected human hepatocytes showed abundant Mx induction at 12, 24, and 48 hpi, whereas B18R treatment reduced this induction, while \u03b1IFNLR had only a minor effect (Fig 6E and S5E Fig). To further study the relative effects of IFN-I and IFN-III on human hepatocytes upon CVB3 infection, RNAseq was performed on total RNA samples of two donors 24 hpi. The 5 most abundantly induced ISGs are shown ( Fig 6E) . As observed before, B18R treatment resulted in the reduction of ISG induction, while \u03b1IFNLR treatment had only a modeate effect. Upon combined treatment with B18R and \u03b1IFNLR the ISG induction was almost comparable with uninfected controls ( Fig  6F) . These data further underscored the strong antiviral effect of IFN-I on CVB3 infected primary hepatocytes, both in the murine as well as the human system.",

            "text": "Several studies demonstrated a predominant role of IFN-I and IFNAR signaling in the pathogenesis of CVB3-induced hepatitis [16] . However, the cellular subsets that contribute to these effects are not known. Therefore, in the current study we aimed at identifying cell subsets that mount protective IFN-I responses and show IFNAR triggering upon CVB3 infection. In CVB3-infected mice, we found abundant IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03bb responses in the liver, of which IFN-\u03b2 was produced primarily by hepatocytes. Moreover, hepatocytes showed exclusively IFNAR-and not IFNLR-dependent ISG induction in mice. Interestingly, IFNAR triggering of hepatocytes prevented severe liver cell necrosis and dissemination of the virus to other organs. CVB3 infection of human hepatocytes induced IFN-\u03b2 as well as IFN-\u03bb responses, whereas ISG expression was mainly triggered by IFN-\u03b2. These results indicate that during CVB3 infection similar mechanisms apply in the murine and the human system. Consistent with previous reports that following CVB3 infection of mice Ifn-\u03b2 mRNA expression was detected in the liver [17] , we found early and strong induction of IFN-\u03b2 protein in liver lysates. Because within the liver hepatocytes as well as myeloid cells, such as Kupffer cells or infiltrating pro-inflammatory monocytes, have been reported to be able to mount IFN\u03b2 responses [18, 19] , we addressed which of the two subsets accounted for the IFN-\u03b2 responses upon CVB3 infection. Our studies with BM chimeric mice, in which either hematopoietic or non-hematopoietic cells reported on IFN-\u03b2 expression, as well as experiments with hepatocyte-and myeloid cell-specific conditional IFN-\u03b2 reporter mice, indicated that upon CVB3 infection IFN-\u03b2 induction in the liver was contributed mainly by hepatocytes, and to a minor extent by myeloid cells. In line with that, ex vivo isolated primary murine hepatocytes mounted substantial IFN-\u03b2 responses. Thus, our data indicate that in CVB3 infection hepatocytes are important IFN-\u03b2 producers in the liver. In a recent study, CVB3-infected mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific IFNAR ablation showed enhanced virus replication in the heart [20] . However, in that study it was not addressed whether locally or extra-cardiacally produced IFN-I conferred protective effects in cardiomyocytes. Here, we detected only very minor IFN-\u03b2 induction in the heart, whereas early and strong IFN-I responses were found in the liver, suggesting that hepatic IFN-I responses determined whether peripheral organs, such as the heart, were assaulted or not.",

Since plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) have been reported to be main IFN-\u03b1 producers in the liver [21] , it is possible that hepatic IFN-\u03b1 was derived from local pDC. However, upon in vitro incubation with CVB3, human and murine pDC were unable to mount strong IFN-\u03b1 responses in the absence of opsonizing CVB3 antibodies [22] . Since it is unlikely that CVB3-specific antibodies are present as early as 2 dpi, this raises the question whether pDC could be activated in vivo by other mechanisms. Indeed, for other viruses it was shown that direct virus infection of pDC was not required to trigger IFN-\u03b1 responses [23] . IFN-\u03b1 induction was even stronger when pDC were stimulated by infected cells [24] . Thus, CVB3-infected hepatocytes might be able to trigger IFN-\u03b1 production by pDC, as previously shown for HCVinfected cells [25] . Finally, also extrahepatically produced IFN-\u03b1 can reach the liver via the circulation.",

Liver pathology was characterized by severe necrosis and infection of hepatocytes. IFNAR-triggering of myeloid cells was shown to be crucial for the control of many different virus infections [28] [29] [30] [31] . Nevertheless, mice with a selective IFNAR ablation on myeloid cells showed normal survival of CVB3 infection and only moderate or no hepatitis, as similarly detected in WT mice. In contrast, mice with a hepatocyte-specific IFNAR-deletion showed increased virus titers in the liver and the virus disseminated to other fully IFNAR competent peripheral organs, as similarly observed in IFNAR -/mice that show an ubiquitous IFNAR deletion. Furthermore, it was shown that mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific IFNAR ablation had only increased viral titers in the heart, but not in other peripheral organs tested [20] . These data are compatible with the model that IFNAR signaling of hepatocytes is essential to control CVB3 infection and to prevent its dissemination. Therefore, it is possible that the responsiveness of hepatocytes to CVB3 infection as well as the IFN-I responsiveness of hepatocytes affect the individual risk to develop myocarditis.",

However, in CVB3-infected IFN-\u03b2 -/mice no hepatitis was detected, suggesting that under such conditions IFN-\u03b1 responses modulated hepatitis and thus compensated the IFN-\u03b2 deficiency. Interestingly, in hepatic necrosis of CVB3-infected IFNAR -/and Alb-Cre +/-IFNAR fl/fl mice we observed only very few infiltrating immune cells. This absence of infiltrating immune cells in hepatic necrosis was also detected in fatal cases of CVB3-infected neonates [3, 4] . A similar phenotype was also described for CVB3-infected mice with an ablation either of the cytoplasmic dsRNA sensor melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) or its adaptor MDA-5-transducing mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) [16, 17] . It was speculated that in MAVS -/mice the induction of reduced IFN-I levels was responsible for the development of hepatocyte necrosis [16] , which suggested the need of MAVS-dependent signaling in hepatocytes for the induction of IFN-I responses.",

Liu et al. [32] published earlier that the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) induces degradation of the IFNAR1 chain in VSV and HCV infection, which leads to unresponsiveness to IFN-I upon virus infection. An important role of PERK action was observed in the pancreas. Mice treated with PERK inhibitor showed pancreas injury, which was due to a pathological IFNAR signaling [33] .",

            "text": "In contrast to IFNAR-mediated protection against viral hepatitis, Bhattacharya et al. reported detrimental effect of IFNAR-signaling in LCMV-induced hepatitis [34] . Mice with a selective IFNAR ablation in hepatocytes were protected from LCMV-induced hepatitis, whereas in WT mice hepatitis was induced by oxidative damage. However, hepatitis in LCMV-infected WT mice was moderate and without associated hepatocyte necrosis [34] , whereas in our model CVB3 infection resulted in fulminant hepatitis with hepatocyte necrosis. In mice IFNAR, and not IFNLR, signaling mediated critical ISG induction in hepatocytes, whereas in humans the situation might be different. Recently, it was shown that primary human hepatocytes expressed IFNLR and responded in vitro to IFN-III treatment with ISG induction that inhibited CVB3 replication [12] . We showed that CVB3 infected human hepatocytes expressed IFN-\u03b2 as well as IFN-\u03bb, and showed enhanced ISG expression. Furthermore, we detected low protein levels of IFN-\u03b2 and higher protein concentrations of IFN-III in the supernatant of CVB3 infected human hepatocytes. Despite the higher concentration of IFN-III, B18R treatment of CVB3 infected hepatocytes reduced the ISG induction in CVB3 infected human hepatocytes, whereas the inhibition of the IFN-III axis had only very minor effects. Bolen et al. [35] compared the reactivity of similar amounts of IFN-I and IFN-III proteins on primary human hepatocytes. They found that regarding ISG induction IFN-\u03b2 had the highest potency, followed by IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03bb3, IFN-\u03bb1, and IFN-\u03bb2. This observation offers an explanation for the dominant effects of IFN-I in our experiments. Since we could only detect very minor luciferase induction in the heart of CVB3 infected IFN-\u03b2 wt/\u0394\u03b2-luc reporter mice, it remains elusive whether local IFN-I production would suffice to induce protective effects in cardiomyocytes [20] . Hepatocyte-derived IFN-\u03b2 presumably exhibits biological effects also outside the liver, e.g. in the myocard. However, the relevance of IFN-I vs. IFN-III in the human liver during CVB3 infection needs to be better understood before IFN-I and/or IFN-III can be used for the therapy of CVB3-induced hepatitis or myocarditis.",

In addition to the organ homogenates shown in Fig 1D-1F, cLN and spleen were assessed for (A) IFN-\u03b2, (B) IFN-\u03b1, and (C) IFN-\u03bb protein levels by ELISA methods. Also serum samples were analyzed for (D) IFN-\u03b2 and (E) IFN-\u03b1 protein levels by ELISA methods. Pooled data from two independent experiments are shown. Bars depict median. Mann-Whitney test was used for statistical analysis, \u00c3 P < 0.05; \u00c3\u00c3 P < 0.01. (TIF) S2 Fig. Upon CVB3 infection IFNAR, but not IFNLR, signaling mediates ISG15 induction in hepatocytes. (A) Uninfected Mx1, Mx1-IFNAR -/-, Mx1-IFNLR -/-, and Mx1-IFNAR -/--IFNLR -/mice were perfused with PBS and liver and pancreas were prepared. Immunohistochemical analysis of MX1 expression within sections of liver (line 1) and pancreas (line 2) were performed. Bars = 10 \u03bcm. (B and C) Uninfected Mx1, Mx1-IFNAR -/-, Mx1-IFNLR -/-, and Mx1-IFNAR -/-IFNLR -/mice and mice infected i.p. with 2 \u00d7 10 4 PFU CVB3 were perfused after 2 dpi and (B) immunohistochemical analysis of ISG15 expression within sections of liver (line 1) and pancreas (line 2) were performed. Bars = 10 \u03bcm. Representative sections of one mouse out of four ones are shown. (C) The staining intensity of ISG15 of all infected genotypes was scored using a semiquantitative scoring system. Shown are the scores for the different mice of each group and the median. (TIF) S3 Fig. CVB3-infected mice devoid of IFNLR show similar liver pathology as WT mice. Mx1, Mx1-IFNAR -/-, Mx1-IFNLR -/-, and Mx1-IFNAR -/-IFNLR -/mice were infected i.p. with 2 \u00d7 10 4 PFU CVB3 and sacrificed 2 dpi. (A) H&E staining of liver (line 1) and pancreas (line 2). Arrowheads highlight necrotic hepatocytes (coagulative necrosis). Stars depict widespread necrosis of the exocrine pancreas Bars = 50 \u03bcm. (B) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level were determined from serum 2 dpi (n = 4). Bars depict median. (C) Quantification of area of infected liver tissue in CVB3 immunohistochemistry sections determined by AnalySIS 3.2 software (n = 4). Bars depict median. (TIF) S4 Fig. CVB3-infected mice with an IFNAR deletion in hepatocytes or myeloid cells show necrosis of acinar cells. C57BL/6, IFNAR -/-, Alb-Cre +/-IFNAR fl/fl , and LysM-Cre +/-IFNAR fl/fl mice were CVB3 infected i.p. with 2 \u00d7 10 4 PFU and sacrificed 0, 2, or 3 dpi (n = 3-5). (A) Pancreas sections were stained for H&E (line 1) or subjected to CVB3-specific immunohistochemistry (line 2). Necrosis of exocrine pancreas (stars) and CVB3-virus antigen (brown signal) is detected in all mice. Insert line 1: Endocrine islet cells lack morphological changes. Insert line 2: Pancreatic ducts lack CVB3-virus antigen. Bars = 50 \u03bcm. (B) Quantification of the area of infected pancreas tissue in CVB3 immunohistochemistry sections was performed by AnalySIS 3.2 software (n = 3-5). Bars depict median.
