            "text": "Background: RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) play important roles in a wide variety of cellular processes, ranging from transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression to host defense against pathogens. High throughput experiments to identify RNA-protein interactions are beginning to provide valuable information about the complexity of RNA-protein interaction networks, but are expensive and time consuming. Hence, there is a need for reliable computational methods for predicting RNA-protein interactions. Results: We propose RPISeq, a family of classifiers for predicting RNA-protein interactions using only sequence information. Given the sequences of an RNA and a protein as input, RPIseq predicts whether or not the RNAprotein pair interact. The RNA sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its ribonucleotide 4-mer composition, and the protein sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its 3-mer composition, based on a 7-letter reduced alphabet representation. Two variants of RPISeq are presented: RPISeq-SVM, which uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and RPISeq-RF, which uses a Random Forest classifier. On two non-redundant benchmark datasets extracted from the Protein-RNA Interface Database (PRIDB), RPISeq achieved an AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve) of 0.96 and 0.92. On a third dataset containing only mRNA-protein interactions, the performance of RPISeq was competitive with that of a published method that requires information regarding many different features (e.g., mRNA half-life, GO annotations) of the putative RNA and protein partners. In addition, RPISeq classifiers trained using the PRIDB data correctly predicted the majority (57-99%) of non-coding RNA-protein interactions in NPInter-derived networks from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, M. musculus, and H. sapiens.",

            "text": "Most of the essential molecular functions of cells are governed by interactions of proteins with other proteins, nucleic acids and small ligands. Computational studies of protein interaction data have helped identify protein-protein interaction PPI networks in various organisms [1, 2] . Similarly, studies on DNA-protein interactions have allowed construction of transcription factor-gene regulatory networks [3, 4] . In contrast, although several ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes have been extensively characterized (e.g., the ribosome, the spliceosome), posttranscriptional regulatory networks that are mediated by RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) are much less well studied [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . In addition to their roles in controlling gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, RPIs regulate numerous fundamental biological processes, ranging from DNA replication and transcription, to pathogen resistance, to viral replication [10] [11] [12] [13] . Recently, high-throughput experiments have provided evidence for large numbers of RNA binding proteins in cells, and are beginning to identify and characterize pairs of RNAs and proteins that participate in RPIs [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . At present, however, our understanding of RNA binding proteins lags far behind our knowledge of regulatory DNA binding proteins, such as transcription factors and replication factors.",

Only a few studies to date have focused on the \"partner prediction problem\", i.e., identification of specific RNA interaction partner(s) for a known RNA binding protein, or protein binding partner(s) for non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Although large-scale experimental analyses of RPIs such as RNAcompete [23] , RIP-Chip [24] , HITS-CLIP [25] , PAR-CLIP [8] are now providing valuable data about networks of RNA-protein interactions, these experiments are expensive and time-consuming. Thus, there is a compelling need for computational methods to accurately predict RPIs and to construct RNA-protein interaction networks. Given the limited number of structurally characterized RNA-protein complexes available in the PDB [26] at present (1,092 as of June 13, 2011) and the current availability of only one database of ncRNA-protein interactions (NPInter [27] ), it would be especially valuable to develop sequence-based methods that can be used to identify potential RNA-protein partners in the absence of experimental structural information regarding either partner.",

In developing sequence-based methods to answer this question, we considered several reduced and alternative alphabet representations of the input protein and RNA sequences. Shen et al. [28] used a Conjoint Triad Feature (CTF) representation to successfully predict protein-protein interactions. The CTF representation essentially encodes each protein sequence using the normalized 3-gram frequency distribution extracted from a 7-letter reduced alphabet representation of the protein sequence (See Methods for details). A recent study [29] demonstrated the utility of the CTF representation for predicting whether a given protein is an RNA binding protein. Inspired by these studies, we chose to encode each protein sequence using the normalized k-gram frequency distributions extracted from the 7-letter reduced alphabet representation of the sequence. The choice of k = 3 yielded the best results. We also explored several alternative representations of RNA sequences and settled on encoding each RNA sequence using normalized 4-gram frequencies extracted directly from the 4-letter ribonucleotide alphabet representation of the RNA sequence.",

Table 1 summarizes the prediction results obtained in 10-fold cross-validation experiments. On the RPI2241 dataset, the prediction accuracy was 89.6% (RF) and 87.1% (SVM); precision and recall for both classifiers was greater than 87%. On the RPI369 dataset, performance of both classifiers was considerably lower with an average accuracy of only 76.2% (RF) and 72.8% (SVM). Notably, values of the F-measure (weighted average of precision and recall) were greater than 0.70 for both classifiers on both datasets. Thus, the performance of classifiers estimated using 10-fold cross-validation on the larger RPI2241 dataset, which includes ribosomal data, is considerably better than that estimated using the RPI369 dataset, from which ribosomal data have been excluded. We also performed leave-one-out cross validation for the RF classifier. The results were not significantly different from 10-fold cross-validation experiments. The performance statistics reported in Table 1 were obtained using classifiers designed to provide high prediction accuracy. By varying the classification threshold value, the prediction specificity can be increased at the expense of a decrease in sensitivity. The corresponding trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate can be seen from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shown in Figure 1 . Consistent with the results in Table 1 , ROC AUCs of 0.97 (RF) and 0.92 (SVM) were obtained for predictions on the RPI2241 dataset, with lower values of 0.85 (RF) and 0.81 (SVM) on the RPI369 dataset. For both classifiers, the AUC of ROC is significantly greater than 0.50 (random), indicating the feasibility of predicting RPIs using only sequence information from the RNA and protein as input.",

When we tested our method using all 13,243 pairs for cross-validation, the prediction accuracies increased to 78% for the RF and 65% for SVM classifier.

Further, our results suggest that sequences of mRNAs and proteins carry sufficient information to allow reasonable predictions regarding whether or not a given mRNA and protein interact.

Recently, Nacher and Araki [37] used RPIs from the NPInter database [27] , a database of non-coding RNA-protein interactions, to construct non-coding RNA-protein networks for several different model organisms. Their study revealed significant similarities between ncRNA-protein and transcription factor-gene regulatory networks. To explore whether RPISeq could be useful for constructing networks of ncRNA-protein interactions, we evaluated our method in predicting RPIs in networks derived from NPInter. Because the NPInter RPI pairs do not include any pairs derived from ribosomes, in this experiment, we also compared the performance of models trained on the RPI369 (which lacks ribosomal sequences) versus RPI2241, to evaluate the potential effect of strong ribosomal sequence bias on performance. Tables 2 and 3 show the number of RPI pairs correctly predicted for each organism. When trained on the RPI2241 dataset (Table 2) , the RF classifier correctly pre-dicted~80% (1,349 of 1,681 total interactions). The output probabilities of RPISeq are estimates of interaction propensities for a specific RNA-protein pair. In Tables 2  and 3 , the probability threshold used for \"positive\" interactions was 0.50. Among the 1,349 interactions predicted by the RF classifier, only 119 were predicted with probabilities \u2265 0.80, and another 1,230 interactions were predicted with probabilities in the range 0.50-0.80.

Unlike the \"interface prediction problem,\" for which detailed structural information for more than 1,000 RNA-protein complexes is available in the PDB, mRNA partners for only a handful of RBPs are known [10] . Currently, two basic types of information regarding RNA-protein interaction partners are widely available: i) experimentally-determined structures of RNA-protein complexes, available in primary resources such as the PDB [26] and NDB [41] , and secondary resources such as PRIDB [34] and BIPA [42] ; and ii) experimental data from in vivo or in vitro cross-linking studies focused on individual proteins (e.g., SFRS1 [43] , PUF [44] ) or from high throughput RNAbinding microarrays [23] , stored in repositories such as NPInter [27] , CLIPZ [45] and RBPDB [46] .",

The second dataset is larger, consisting of 13,243 RPIs, and including all 5,166 interactions in the smaller dataset. Pancaldi and B\u00e4hler were not able to evaluate their method on this larger dataset because of missing feature information for RNAs and proteins involved in these interactions. Because RPISeq uses only sequence information, we were able to evaluate our method using all of the available data.",

In this method, the 20 amino acids are Each protein sequence is then encoded using the 7-letter reduced alphabet. Each protein feature represents the normalized frequency of the corresponding conjoint triad, i.e., 3-mer in the 7-letter reduced alphabet representation of the protein sequence. Thus, each protein sequence is represented by a 343 (7 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7) dimensional vector, where each element of the vector corresponds to the normalized frequency of the corresponding 3-mer in the sequence (see [28] for details). Based on results of preliminary tests comparing the normalized k-mer frequency representation of RNA sequences for different values of k, we chose to encode RNA sequences using a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 or 256-dimensional vector, in which each feature represents the normalized frequency of the corresponding 4-mer appearing in the RNA sequence (e.g., AAUG, CGAU, GGCC)",

If the patterns are not separable in the original n-dimensional input space, a suitable non-linear kernel function is used to implicitly map the patterns in the n-dimensional input space into a typically higher (finite or even infinite) dimensional kernel-induced feature space in which the patterns become separable or nearly separable. Given a training set consisting labeled examples of the form (X i , y i ) where X i is an n-dimensional input vector and y i = 0/1 is its label (i.e., the desired output of the SVM classifier for input X i ), the SVM learning algorithm effectively selects the hyperplane that maximizes the margin of separation between the training samples of the two classes from among all separating hyperplanes. If the examples are not perfectly separable in the kernel-induced feature space, a user-chosen parameter C is used to trade off training error (the number of misclassified training examples) against margin for the correctly classified training examples.",
