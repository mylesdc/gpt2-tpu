Clinical tropical medicine research efforts have largely followed suit. A developing trend in clinical research is to look beyond the traditional referral centers and their patient populations, out into the communities and to integrate the \"horizontal\" influences of comorbidities, culture, health delivery systems, social determinants of health, and other contexts, rather than maintain an artificially narrow \"vertical\" focus on single pathophysiological entities. This new approach, using community involvement and practicebased research networks, has the potential to challenge assumptions and uncover new strategies for improving the health of the individual and the community. 1 In our review of clinical research articles in the journal over the past year, we found signs of a similar trend brewing in clinical tropical medicine research.",

For the purposes of this award, clinical research was defined as the branch of health-care science that determines the safety and effectiveness of medications, devices, diagnostic products, and treatment regimens intended for human use. 2 These may be used for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, or relieving symptoms of a disease. The scope also included studies of disease manifestation and progression, clinical epidemiological studies, and case reports of novel presentations or approaches to diagnosis or treatment.

Severe malaria had age peaks at 2-3 years and in those older than 50 years.

As part of their discussion, they observed, \"A more comprehensive approach to case management is needed, rather than focusing on only a single diagnosis and treatment.\" 6 This points to patient-oriented outcomes, rather than mere surrogate markers, as the true indicators of success. Patient-oriented outcomes are difficult to affect and measure because of the many factors in play. Another group included patient-oriented outcomes in the study design but ultimately emphasized a surrogate outcome when no significant effect was seen in the former. 7 Another theme was the importance of incorporation of both ends of the age spectrum. The inclusion of geriatric populations-a group that is often neglected but is increasing in size in tropical clinical research-was refreshing. 8 So, too, was the inclusion of the young. 9,10 Whereas the findings may not have been surprising in terms of both efficacy and tolerability in children compared with young adults, toxicity in older patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis treated with systemic antimony drugs was increased to the point that it is not recommended. 8 It was good to see actual data rather than leaving clinicians to extrapolate based on nonsimilar patient populations when making treatment decisions.",

The perspective reported here does not reflect a systematic review of the literature. It is the observation that those articles which most impressed the committee seemed to share these themes in common. The themes were not a priori selection criteria; they emerged from an ad hoc process affected by the shared biases of the selection committee. Ideally, these are biases which value recognition of a changing culture within clinical research, one that favors a more integrated and comprehensive approach to clinical tropical medicine research. We believe that the future will be shaped by well-designed studies that consider the entire community, including the complexity of interactions, the full span of its ages, and its priorities for health.",
