Since infection or contamination may affect the results of a biological experiment, it is important to test the samples for the presence of ''alien'' proteins. Usually cells are tested only for the most common infections, and most of the existing tests are targeting specific contaminations. Here we describe a three-step procedure for reliable untargeted detection of viral proteins using proteomics data, and recommend this or similar procedure to be applied to every proteomics dataset submitted for publication.",

Ten years ago, the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) found that 18% of 252 submitted cell lines were cross-contaminated with more than half of the contamination sources located within only six laboratories. Subsequent testing performed by DSMZ with extended number of cell lines showed that of 598 leukemia-lymphoma cell lines, 187 (31%) were contaminated with mycoplasma and/or a second cell line, with 38 (6%) of cell lines contaminated with both [5] .",

The vast majority of current microbial or viral infection tests are based on PCR, ELISA and other methods targeting specific organisms. In contrast, untargeted omics techniques (genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics) provide complete or very significant coverage of the respective domain, practically eliminating the risk of missing a contaminant in the dataset provided the genome of the contaminant is known. However, the data analysis methods used today in e.g. shotgun proteomics of cell lines, are often blind to other organisms than the target one. The standard protocol simply discards the data that do not fit into genome of the host organism, thus ignoring, and in some cases misattributing, even significant contamination [17, 18] . In view of the above scary examples of misattribution, such a practice should be discouraged, and a better procedure needs to be found for interpretation of shotgun proteomics data.",

Matching theoretical peptide to experimental spectrum has a probabilistic nature. Removing non-relevant sequences from the sequence database reduces the probability of random match between experimental and theoretical spectra, thus increasing the sensitivity of the method [20] . Thus, if there is no contamination, there is no reason to consider other species in the database search than the target one. However, choosing only one specific organism for matching the shotgun proteomics data amounts to assigning zero probability to the presence of other organisms in the sample. As has been demonstrated above, such an assumption can be dangerous. On the other hand, inclusion of several organisms in the database search amounts to assigning equal a priori probabilities to all proteins of all organisms, which reduces the search sensitivity and may lead to erroneous matches. Thus the simplest way to account for the possibility of viral presence, adding the sequences of all known viral proteins to the protein sequences database, is a faulty approach.",

However, subsequent studies by Foster [22] and Knudsen and Chalkley [23] have proved findings of Bromenshenk et al. wrong, with the misidentification of viral proteins being caused by inappropriate usage of viral-only sequence database for mass-spectrometry data interpretation. In human proteomics, false positive identification of viral peptides is even more likely in the above approach given that up to 8% of human genome has viral origin [24, 25] , and thus some human proteins exhibit high degree of homology to retroviral proteins.",

First, proof of principle is obtained by discovering expected viruses in cell lines known to be producing viral proteins (both cell line established by viral transfection and cell line known to be contaminated by virus). As a control, we analyzed proteomes of 58 NCI-obtained cell lines from the NCI-60 panel. This panel has previously been screened for envelope viral proteins and gene sequences related to xenotropic murine leukemia viruses (X-MLVs) [28] and only one cell line, EKVX, has been found infected by xenotropic murine leukemia virus. Finally, we applied the three-step procedure to other cell line proteomes analyzed by a reputable group [18] and discovered unexpected viral contamination in at least one of the reported 11 lines.",

The first-stage search on HEK293 proteome by Mascot (MatrixScience, UK) attributed 361,736 of the 624,107 MS/MS spectra to human-originated tryptic peptides. The search results were rescored by Percolator and filtered at 1% FDR, yielding 7,970 human protein groups. The remained spectra were searched against the viral subset of the SwissProt database using a Mascot feature ''re-search non-significant spectra''. The results were processed by Percolator as above, yielding three proteins (E1BS, E1BL and E1A) of human adenovirus 5 (Table S1 ). Using intensity-based label-free quantification, we estimated the relative abundance of viral proteins compared to the human cellular proteome (Table S2 ). E1BS and E1BL proteins were found to be among the top 100 most abundant proteins expressed by HEK293 cells. Thus, viral proteins can't be ignored when doing even most ''shallow'' proteomics work. With this example, we established that our procedure successfully detects viral proteins that should be present in the cell ''by design''.",

Using gag RT-PCR, the authors found XMRV in 2003 LNCaP cells from the Cleveland Clinic laboratory and no XMRV in the 2012 LNCaP cells from the UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Here we found that XMRV-infected LNCaP cells were still used in 2011-2012 on a different continent (upon the discovery, the laboratory in question, that did not report the origin of their cells in the cited work, was immediately notified). The widely used German cell line bank DSMZ, according to their web-site information, did not test their LNCaP cells for the XMRV infection.",

The widely adopted in academia practice of sharing cell lines between colleagues (especially popular among young faculty members who are often stretched for funding) facilitates dissemination of contaminated cultures inside the institutes and beyond [9] . To trace cell dissemination and thus control their contamination, it would be helpful to report the cell origin in every published work.",

Thus, detecting viral contamination is more challenging. Direct transfer of convenient data-analysis approaches widely used in single-organism proteomics may result in ''false alarm'' events [22, 23] . It should also be taken into account that some human proteins exhibit high degree of homology to retroviral proteins. In such case standard target-decoy strategy may fail [36] , so the special attention should be paid to the peptide-spectrum matches attributed to retroviral proteins. For instance, additional filtering based on delta score (score difference between the best and next best matches) could help reducing the amount of false positives. We also recommend manual rechecking of the MS/MS spectra and peptide assignments, as well as the uniqueness of the viral peptide sequences.",
