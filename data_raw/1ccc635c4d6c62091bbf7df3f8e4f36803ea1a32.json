These cases were similar to those detected in other European countries, all caused by S-INDEL strains very closely related to each other and to the US Ohio851 strain [9, 10] . A first attempt to isolate PEDV was * Correspondence: davide.lelli@izsler.it \u2020 Equal contributors 1 conducted collecting eleven swine fecal samples at the beginning of the epidemic, between February and March 2015. VERO C1008 cells (ATCC\u00ae CRL-1586) were employed according to a previously published method [11] . CPE was detected after the first cell passage in one sample. The supernatant from cell culture showing cytopathic effect (CPE) was submitted to negative staining Transmission Electron microscopy (nsTEM). The nsTEM examination of CPE positive cell culture revealed icosahedral, non-enveloped virus particles with morphological characteristics referable to Reoviridae. RNA was extracted from cell culture and fecal samples using the Nucleospin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany), and analyzed for the presence of MRV using RT-PCR targeting the L1 and S1 fragments, slightly modified from Lelli et al, 2013 [12] . Fecal samples were analyzed by RT-PCR which evidenced the presence of MRV in one fecal sample and in the respective isolate.",

Porcine MRV3s, placed in lineage IV and frequently associated with other enteric viruses [6] , were also described in pigs suffering diarrhea in South Korea. Interestingly, the Italian and US porcine MRV3 associated to PED outbreaks were characterized by a S1 gene highly related to European bat strains and both fall into lineage III, differently from the South East Asian MRV3 porcine isolates.

Such evidence arises questions on the epidemiological link between pigs and Kuhl's pipistrelle common in anthropized and urban environments. However, the absence of data on the MRVs distribution and genetic characteristics in Europe prevents any hypothesis on the most likely epidemiological links between bats, pigs and humans. The distribution of MRV3 among pigs and bats could probably be widespread in Europe, although it still needs to be further investigated. Pigs harbor a variety of viruses in their gastro-intestinal tract; not all of them cause diseases but many are related to human viruses, including Noroviruses, Rotaviruses and Astroviruses [15] . The findings reported herein highlight the arising potential role of pigs as a reservoir and amplification host of emerging zoonotic viruses.

All of the authors have read and approved the final manuscript.Authors' information DL is a veterinary virologist at the Virology Department of IZSLER. His activity of study and research deals with virological and serological diagnosis of viral diseases of livestock and wildlife species and in the development and validation of diagnostic ELISAs and molecular assays. Emerging and zoonotic viruses, viruses associated with bats and arthropod-borne viruses are currently the major topics of his studies. MSB is a veterinary virologist at the Diagnostic Virology laboratory of IZSVe. She has worked nine years in the field of avian influenza research and control and in the last 3 years she has dedicated her activity in the diagnosis and research of swine viral diseases with particular focus on swine influenza and swine enteric viruses.",
