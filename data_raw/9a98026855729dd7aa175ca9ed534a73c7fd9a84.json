            "text": "Upon recognition of viral components by pattern recognition receptors, such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases, cells are activated to produce type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines. These pathways are tightly regulated by the host to prevent an inappropriate cellular response, but viruses can modulate these pathways to proliferate and spread. In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism in which hepatitis C virus (HCV) evades the immune surveillance system to proliferate by activating microRNA-21 (miR-21). We demonstrated that HCV infection upregulates miR-21, which in turn suppresses HCV-triggered type I IFN production, thus promoting HCV replication. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-21 targets two important factors in the TLR signaling pathway, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), which are involved in HCV-induced type I IFN production. HCV-mediated activation of miR-21 expression requires viral proteins and several signaling components. Moreover, we identified a transcription factor, activating protein-1 (AP-1), which is partly responsible for miR-21 induction in response to HCV infection through PKCe/JNK/c-Jun and PKCa/ERK/c-Fos cascades. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-21 is upregulated during HCV infection and negatively regulates IFN-a signaling through MyD88 and IRAK1 and may be a potential therapeutic target for antiviral intervention.",

Since its discovery in 1989 [3] , HCV has been revealed as a primary cause of chronic hepatitis, end-stage cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Worldwide, an estimated 200 million persons (approximately 3% of the global population) are chronically infected with HCV, and 3 to 4 million persons are newly infected each year [4, 5] . Naturally occurring variants of HCV are classified into six major genotypes. The 9.6-kb HCV genome encodes a large polyprotein that is processed by viral and cellular proteins to produce the virion structural proteins (core protein and glycoproteins E1 and E2) and nonstructural (NS) proteins (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) [3, 4] .",

Upon recognition of viral components, host cells are activated to produce type I interferon (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby upregulating a family of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that exert pleiotropic inhibitory effects on viral replication in neighboring cells [6, 7] . Type I IFN production requires tight control to achieve the appropriate immune response to invading pathogens without triggering an immune disorder [8] . Consequently, viruses have developed strategies to evade and antagonize the host immune response and resist the antiviral actions of IFN therapy. However, the mechanism(s) underlying such immune evasion is not clear.",

Many miRNAs, including miR-146 [15] , miR-155 [16] [17] [18] , miR-98, and let-7 [19] , participate in innate and adaptive immune responses [20] [21] [22] . miR-21 was found to be more strongly expressed in HCC specimens than in non-tumorous tissues [23] , and participates in HCC development by regulating the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) gene [24] . miR-21 is also overexpressed in HCV-positive liver biopsy samples, as assessed by microarray analysis [25] .

Upregulated miR-21 suppressed MyD88 and IRAK1 expression in hepatocytes, which subsequently repressed type I IFN effector gene expression and the type I IFN-mediated antiviral response, thereby promoting viral replication. In addition, miR-21 also enhanced the replication of other viruses such as enterovirus 71 (EV71), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) by repressing type-I IFN production. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to show that miR-21 is upregulated upon RNA virus infection and acts as a negative regulator of type I IFN signaling by targeting MyD88 and IRAK1.",

To determine the relationship between HCV infection and miR-21 activation, we determined the levels of miR-21 in hepatocytes infected with the virus. The results from quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed that miR-21 levels were increased in human Huh7 hepatocytes 1 h after infection HCV strain JFH-1 and reached a peak 6 h after HCV exposure ( Figure 1A) ; this response was dose-dependent ( Figure 1B) . To understand the kinetics of miR-21 induction in HCV infection, we measured the expression of primary miR-21 (pri-miR-21) and miR-21 precursor (pre-miR-21). The induction of pri-miR-21 and pre-miR-21 were coincided with that of mature miR-21 and occurred as early as 2h.p.i. ( Figure S1A ). We cannot rule out the possibility that the increased miR-21 induced by HCV infection was due to nonspecific effects. To assess this possibility, a random non-HCV-related miRNA (miR-93) was analyzed after HCV infection ( Figure S1B ). Moreover, cells inoculated with UVirradiated inactive HCV were also used as another negative control. As the same result of miR-93, the expression level of miR-21 was shown to have no significant changes ( Figure S1C ). These results indicated that HCV activated miR-21 expression in hepatocytes.",

When triggered by viral infection, host cells produce type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines to antagonize the virus. Despite extensive research, the mechanism underlying HCV immune system evasion remains elusive. Our results provided the first direct evidence that microRNA-21 (miR-21) feedback inhibits type I IFN signaling when cells are challenged with HCV, thus promoting the infection. MicroRNA is a kind of endogenous non-coding small RNA that regulates a wide range of biological processes and participate in innate and adaptive immune responses through complementarily pairing with target mRNA, which can regulate its expression or translation. Currently, miRNAs have intrigued many scientists as potent targets or therapeutic agents for diseases. In our study, the targets of miR-21, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), which are important for HCV-induced type I IFN production, have also been found. Moreover, we identified a transcription factor, AP-1, which is partly responsible for miR-21 induction in response to HCV infection. Taken together, our research has provided new insights into understanding the effects of miRNA on host-virus interactions, and revealed a potential therapeutic target for antiviral intervention.",

As NS5A and NS3/4A-activated ERK and JNK were dependent on PKC, we extended our study to identify the specific isozymes of PKC involved in the HCV-regulated activation of miR-21 using an RNA interference (RNAi) approach. Molecules of small interference RNA (siRNA) that specifically knock down genes encoding each PKC isozyme were designed and used to study the function of PKC, based on a previous study [29] . We previously demonstrated that these siRNA molecules were specific and effective [30, 31] . Our results indicated that PKCe-specific and PKCa-specific siRNA (PKCe RNAi and PKCa RNAi, respectively) were able to significantly inhibit the induction of the miR-21 promoter in cells transiently co-transfected with NS5A ( Figure 4B ) or NS3/4A ( Figure 4F ), respectively. Western blot analyses were used to detect the phosphorylation or total protein levels of c-Jun or c-Fos induced by NS5A ( Figure 4C , upper panel) or NS3/4A ( Figure 4G , upper panel), respectively. The miR-21 expression levels stimulated by these two proteins were measured by qPCR ( Figure 4C and 4G, lower panel). These results confirmed the reduction seen in the corresponding luciferase reporter assays. The effects of PKCe and PKCa on the phosphorylation of JNK and ERK were also evaluated using another RNAi approach. The results from the Western blot analysis showed that phosphorylated JNK levels stimulated by the NS5A protein were significantly decreased upon treatment with PKCe-specific siRNA (PKCe RNAi) ( Figure 4D , right panel). Similarly, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 activated by the NS3/4A protein was inhibited by PKCa-specific siRNA (PKCa RNAi) ( Figure 4H , right panel). All of these results suggested that PKCe is the upstream kinase involved in NS5A-induced JNK/c-Jun activation, and PKCa is the upstream kinase in NS3/4A induced ERK/c-Fos activation.",

In addition, we observed that although the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 was downregulated by miR-21, the total STAT protein levels were relatively unaffected, indicating that JAK-STAT signaling activity is negatively regulated by miR-21.

TLR7 is expressed in HCV-infected hepatocytes [41] , therefore, we evaluated proteins in this signaling cascade to identify potential targets of miR-21. As shown in Figure 8 , the mRNA levels of MyD88, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TRAF6 were decreased by miR-21 overexpression and increased by miR-21 inhibition. We also evaluated the gene expression of TLR7 in the same experimental samples using qPCR and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. TLR7 expression did not show any significant changes in hepatocytes in which miR-21 was over-expressed or silenced compared with the control cells transfected with miRNA-control (data not shown). Since miRNA mimics were small chemically modified doublestranded RNAs, and the sequence of miR-21 mimic did not contain the 59-UGUGU-39 internal motif [42] , we deduced that miR-21 mimic could not activate TLR7 signaling as ssRNA. IRF-7 is an ISG that is expressed in HCV-infected hepatocytes, and its expression in the liver is IFN-dependent [43, 44] . IRF-7 promotes the expression of various IFN subtypes, which further amplifies the host response and prolongs IFN production [44] . Here, we investigated the effect of miR-21 on the expression of IRF-7. qPCR ( Figure S5A ) and RT-PCR ( Figure S5B ) results showed that the levels of IRF-7 mRNA were decreased upon treatment with miR-21 and increased upon treatment with miR-21 inhibitor. The results of a Western blot analysis showed that the nuclear translocation of IRF7 was attenuated by miR-21 ( Figure  S5C , left panel) and stimulated by miR-21 inhibitor ( Figure S5C , right panel). These results suggested that miR-21 mediates host antiviral responses by suppressing the expression of genes involved in the TLR signaling cascade.",

We used RNA22 and FINDTAR3 software to predict miR-21 targets and found putative miR-21 binding sites in the 39 UTRs of human MyD88 and IRAK1 ( Figure 9A ). To verify the possibility that MyD88 and IRAK1 were regulated post-transcriptionally by miR-21, we constructed reporter plasmids by cloning these miR-21 binding sites into the 39 UTRs of firefly luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP). A four base pair mutation (mutant type) was introduced into the miR-21 binding site within the 39UTR of IRAK1 or MyD88 cDNA ( Figure S7A ). After co-transfecting the luciferase reporter plasmids into Huh7 cells with vectors express- ing miR-21 mimics or inhibitors, we observed that miR-21 mimics markedly decreased luciferase expression, whereas miR-21 inhibitors increased luciferase expression ( Figure 9B ). miR-21 mimics also downregulated GFP gene expression when the 39-UTR of MyD88 or IRAK1 was cloned into the 39-UTR region of GFP in HEK293 cells, as assessed by flow cytometry ( Figure 9C ). Paralleling the previous results, neither luciferase nor GFP gene expression could be regulated by miR-21 with a mutant-type 39UTR ( Figure S7B and S7C) . Furthermore, transfection of miR-21 mimics decreased MyD88 and IRAK1 expression in Huh7 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner ( Figure 9D ), whereas miR-21 inhibitors increased MyD88 and IRAK1 expression ( Figure 9E ), suggesting that MyD88 and IRAK1 expression could be inhibited by miR-21 via both translational inhibition and mRNA degradation. Taken together, these results show that miR-21 regulates the expression of MyD88 and IRAK1, suggesting the possibility that human MyD88 and IRAK1 are new targets of miR-21.",

Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) effectively inhibited MyD88 and IRAK1 expression in Huh7 cells ( Figure 10A ). Knockdown of MyD88 or IRAK1 significantly decreased the levels of IFN-a mRNA and protein ( Figure 10B) , which produced effects similar to those of miR-21 overexpression. Increased IFN-a expression due to miR-21 inhibition was suppressed by siRNAs against MyD88 or IRAK1 ( Figure 10C ). These results suggest that knockdown of MyD88 or IRAK1 phenocopied the attenuated IFN signaling effect of induced miR-21 and counteracted the effect of miR-21 inhibition. Taken together, these results indicate that virally induced miR-21 regulates IFN signaling through suppression of endogenous MyD88 and IRAK1, thereby inhibiting type I IFN production. It is known that type I IFN production through the Toll-likeinterleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor (TRIF) plays a crucial role in mounting an antiviral response against HCV and the virus has evolved to cripple this pathway [45] . To test whether this pathway also affect the IFN-a meditated by the miR-21 on MyD88 pathway, TRIF or IRF was knocked down in Huh7 cell lines, which were then treated with miR-21 and HCV. The level of IFN-a protein was decreased by miR-21 and this regulation was not affected by treatment with TRIF or IRF3 siRNA compared to the control ( Figure S8) . Thus, the mechanism by which miR-21 uses MyD88 and IRAK1 to counter the type I IFN-associated antiviral response during HCV infection is an independent pathway of the TRIF pathway.",

Next, we assessed the effects of miR-21 on HIV production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A reporter plasmid containing an HIV-1 clone, pNL4-3.luc.R-E-, was introduced into PBMCs together with a control Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid (pRL) as a loading control. Luciferase activity was measured in the presence of cotransfected synthetic miR-21 or negative control, treated with or without IFN, respectively. The results from the luciferase assays showed that HIV-1 transcription was induced in the presence of miR-21( Figure 11B, left panel) , and miR-21 also counteracted the IFN-a anti-HIV activity ( Figure 11B , right panel). VSV is a pathogen that is extremely sensitive to the action of type-I IFNs. Thus, we finally investigated the effect of miR-21 on VSV production.

This host response represents our first line of defense against viral infection, and if successful, results in an abortive infection. However, viruses adopt various strategies to evade host defenses [46] . Molecular mech- anisms by which viruses trigger and regulate these antiviral processes have recently been characterized. The host response launches an innate immune defense against HCV infection [47] , and HCV evades the host response through a multifaceted process that includes signaling interference, effector modulation, and continuous genetic variation. These evasion strategies promote the persistent infection and spread of HCV; therefore, identifying the precise molecular mechanisms by which HCV regulates the host response may reveal novel therapeutic targets. The TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway plays pivotal roles in virus recognition and initiation of the antiviral response in immune cells. Although HCV was previously shown to modulate the TLR-MyD88 antiviral response [48] , the precise mechanism involved remains unclear, and additional negative regulators need to be identified. miR-21 is overexpressed in breast, colon, lung, pancreas, prostate, and stomach tumors, as well as in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, indicating that miR-21 may play a key role in tumor cell behavior and malignant transformation. Inhibition of miR-21 also increases cell growth in other cancer types [49] and exerts antiapoptotic effects in glioblastoma and cholangiocarcinoma [50, 51] . Thus, altering miR-21 expression can produce diverse effects on tumor cells. Here, we revealed that miR-21 expression is stimulated by HCV infection in human hepatocytes, and showed that miR-21 is also activated in cells infected HIV-1 or VSV. Thus, we provided a direct evidence for the association of miR-21 expression with viral infection.",

            "text": "The mechanism involved in the activation of miR-21 mediated by HCV infection was further investigated. Our results showed that AP-1 is at least partially responsible for the upregulation of miR-21. Recently, some researchers have demonstrated that AP-1 activates the miR-21 transcription in conjunction with the switch/ sucrose non fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex, after phorbol 12myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation through the conserved AP-1 and PU.1 binding sites in the promoter. Hence, it is possible that posttranscriptional processing and/or decay of miRNAs may also contribute to the unequal upregulation of miR-21 during HCV infection. AP-1 is a cellular transcription factor complex involved in several cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. It has recently been reported that AP-1 is induced during infections by various viruses, including hepatitis B virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and HIV, and that this induction promotes viral replication. Many viral proteins can induce multiple signaling pathways, which may cross-talk with each other or converge on common downstream effectors. In the present study, we demonstrated that AP-1 is essential for NS5A and NS3/4A protein-induced miR-21 expression, as mutations in AP-1 binding sites eliminated the protein-induced activation of miR-21 promoter activity. Based on our finding that the NS5A and NS3/4A proteins activate c-Jun and c-Fos expression, respectively, we further investigated the roles of different MAP kinases in the activation of miR-21 by the two proteins. The results suggested that ERK, JNK, and PKC were all involved in the HCV-mediated activation of miR-21. Additionally, active PKCa/ERK was required for the binding of c-Fos to the miR-21 promoter in response to NS3/4A protein stimulation; the PKCe/JNK pathway is the important signaling pathway in the regulation of c-Jun by the NS5A protein. According to our confocal immunofluorescence results, NS3/4A and NS5A were distributed in the cytoplasm evenly ( Figure S10 ), and this observation was consistent with the previous results [52, 53] . However, there is also evidence that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of NS5A can be detected in the nucleus, though the fulllength NS5A protein is localized in cytoplasm [54] . This, therefore, suggests that NS5A may have the ability to translocate into the nucleus and function as an activator of transcription when the NLS is exposed.",

We then checked upstream by examining the phosphorylation status of STAT1 and STAT2. miR-21 decreased STAT1/STAT2 phosphorylation, but had little effect on total STAT protein levels ( Figure S4A ). The activation of STAT1 and STAT2 mainly occurs through the IFN-JAK/STAT pathway, so we evaluated the initiation point of this pathway, IFN-associated receptors (IFNARs), and found that miR-21 overexpression reduced IFNARs expression (Figure 7 ). According to these results, the induction of miR-21 can disturb the JAK-STAT pathway, which is a logical reason for its upregulation on HCV upon replication.",

Measles virus and respiratory syncytial virus inhibit TLR7-dependent and TLR9-dependent IFN signaling stimulated by resiquimod and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides in primary human plasmacytoid dendritic cells [65] . Here, we report the novel regulation of TLR-MyD88 signaling by miRNA. First, we found that HCV infection upregulated miR-21 expression in hepatocytes. Second, we demonstrated that miR-21 suppresses HCV-triggered type I IFN production, thereby promoting HCV replication, and thus, demonstrating a novel mechanism for viral immune evasion. Third, we demonstrated that both human MyD88 and IRAK1 are targets of miR-21. In this new model of HCV infection, HCV is first identified by TLRs and retinoic-acid- inducible gene-1 (RIG-1), which in turn initiate type I IFN production against HCV infection. Meanwhile, HCV infections can also upregulated the expression of miR-21, which counteracted the IFN-mediated antiviral response by inhibiting TLR-MyD88 signaling. Consistently, miR-21 overexpression stimulated replication and production of HCV, VSV, HIV and EV71. Intriguingly, unlike the other three viruses, levels of miR-21 were not induced significantly by EV71 ( Figure 11 ). As it has been reported that EV71 fails to stimulate the expression of type I IFN in mammalian cells [66] , the upregulation of miR-21 expression may not be required after EV71 infection. Induction of miR-21 expression may be a new survival strategy of the virus to escape the antiviral immune response of the host.",

HCV evades the host response through a complex combination of virus-host interactions that disrupt intracellular signaling pathways and attenuate the antiviral actions of IFN. Viral regulation of the host response impairs the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity and provides a foundation for HCV replication and spreading. It is generally thought that miRNAs target multiple mRNAs, termed the targetome, to regulate gene expression. A single miRNA might fine-tune the protein synthesis of thousands of genes directly or indirectly [67] . In the present study, human MyD88 and IRAK1 were shown to be novel targets of miR-21, contributing to the negative regulatory feedback function of miR-21 in TLR-MyD88 signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-21 may be a potential therapeutic target for antiviral intervention; however, this needs to be verified in future studies.",

Furthermore, the NS5A protein was shown to inhibit the TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway through a direct interaction with the death domain of MyD88 through the interferon sensitivity-determining region (ISDR) [48] . In this study, we found that the functional mechanism of miR-21 action through MyD88 and IRAK1, which was also modulated by NS3/4A and NS5A protein expression, could be another mechanism independent pathway of the TRIF pathway for impairing the type I IFN-associated antiviral response during HCV infection ( Figure S7 ).",

            "text": "Proposed model for the activation of miR-21 expression upon HCV infection and the role of miR-21 in the regulation of the antiviral activity of type I IFN. During HCV infection, the virus is first recognized by TLRs and RIG-1, which in turn activates MyD88 and IRAK1 to initiate IFN-a synthesis, resulting in the activation of ISGs and the inhibition of HCV replication. In addition, miR-21 expression is activated during HCV infection through two signaling pathways: the PKCe/JNK/c-Jun pathway and the PKCa/ERK/c-Fos pathway. The HCV NS5A protein activates PKCe to enhance the expression of JNK and c-Jun, while the HCV NS3/4A complex stimulates PKCa to promote the production of ERK and c-Fos. The two subunits (c-Jun and c-Fos) of AP-1 join together to recognize the miR-21 promoter and activate the expression of miR-21, which represses the expression of MyD88 and IRAK1 via imperfect base pairing between miR-21 and the 39UTR of MyD88 and IRAK1. The reduction in MyD88 and IRAK1 causes a reduction of type-I IFN production and ISG expression that might contribute to viral pathogenesis and virus propagation. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003248.g012",
