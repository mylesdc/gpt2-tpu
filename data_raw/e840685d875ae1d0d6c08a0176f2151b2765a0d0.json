Although generic protein composition of RJ has been investigated, little is known about how age-dependent changes on HG secretion affect RJ composition and their biological consequences. In this study, we identified differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) during HG development by using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling technique. This proteomic method increases the potential for new protein discovery by improving the identification of low quantity proteins. Results: A total of 1282 proteins were identified from five age groups of worker bees, 284 of which were differentially expressed. 43 (15.1%) of the DEPs were identified for the first time. Comparison of samples at day 6, 9, 12, and 16 of development relative to day 3 led to the unambiguous identification of 112, 117, 127, and 127 DEPs, respectively. The majority of these DEPs were up-regulated in the older worker groups, indicating a substantial change in the pattern of proteins expressed after 3 days. DEPs were identified among all the age groups, suggesting that changes in protein expression during HG ontogeny are concomitant with different states of worker development. A total of 649 proteins were mapped to canonical signaling pathways found in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), which were preferentially associated with metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. More than 10 key high-abundance proteins were involved in signaling pathways related to ribosome function and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. The results were validated by qPCR.",

Hypopharyngeal glands (HGs) are important exocrine glands localized in the anterior part of the head of bees [2] . The HG is constituted by hundreds of acini that are attached to an axial duct that opens onto the suboral plate of the hypopharynx [3, 4] . Morphologically, the acini of the HGs change in size radically with age [5] , with a peak size at approximately 6 days that decreases after day 15 during the summertime [6] . The amount of RJ secreted by the secretory cells is also positively correlated with size of the acini [5] , with undeveloped or hypertrophied cells having less activity than glands of medium size. According to the age polyethism of bees, there are two described phases of the secretory cycle: production of RJ, followed by production of enzymes such as \u03b1-glucosidase, which increases with the age of the worker bee.",

RJ is a yogurt-like milk substance that is produced by nurse bees (typically young workers) used to nourish workers during the first 3 days of larval development and queens throughout their entire life. Irrespective of geographical and climatic conditions, RJ typically contains multiple components, including proteins (12-15%), sugars (10-12%), lipids (3-7%), minerals, vitamins [8] , salts, and amino acids [9, 10] and specific vital factors that act as biocatalysts in cell regeneration processes within the human body [11] . Lipids present in RJ are secreted from the mandibular glands, while most of the proteins contained in the RJ are secreted from the HG [12, 13] . The majority of the proteins in the RJ (82-90%) belong to the major royal jelly protein family (MRJPs 1-9) [12, 14] . MRJP1 is the most abundant of them, representing 48% of the watersoluble proteins [15] . RJ has diverse nutritional and/or pharmacological functions, such as hypotensive activity, antitumor activity, insulin-like action, and disinfectant action [16] [17] [18] . Although RJ protein composition has been described in several studies, potential developmental changes in glandular secretion had not been considered.",

Previous proteomic researches on the honeybee mainly used gel-based 1D/2D gel electrophoresis technique [6, 21] for protein identification and characterization. Though the electrophoretic approach is still widely used, it is laborious and prone to experimental errors [22] . Furthermore, the lack of accuracy of 1D/2D methods for the identification of low-abundance proteins, such as membrane proteins and other hydrophobic proteins, has partly restricted their application [23] [24] [25] . The isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic strategy to assess proteome-wide expression profiling has facilitated the detection of new proteins and enhanced the sensitivity of screening the proteome [26, 27] . iTRAQ combined with multidimensional liquid chromatography (LC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS) analysis [28] is emerging as a powerful method in the search for diseasespecific targets, such as for lung adenocarcinoma [29] , metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma [30] , sepsis prognosis [31] , and colorectal cancer [32] .",

MRJP1 is the most abundant of them, representing 48% of the water-soluble proteins [15] . MRJPs are highly expressed in the HG, although they are also expressed in other tissues including the brain [56] . What is the molecular function of MRJPs? There are three lines of evidence that support that several members of the MRJP family evolved nutritionally related functions. First, MRJP3 contains repetitive pentapeptide regions abundant in nitrogen-rich amino acids that may function as deposits of biologically accessible nitrogen [56, 57] . Second, MRJP1 and MRJP2 composition is especially rich in essential amino acids [58] . Third, MRJP1 is critical during the nutritionally-mediated caste determination process [59] . MRJPs are likely involved in other nutritionally-related functions, besides their traditional role in larvae and queen nutrition. They are likely involved in the transfer of secreted proteins among workers by means of trophalaxis [60] [61] [62] . MRJP2 and MRJP7 are preferentially expressed in heads of sterile workers [63] . Overall, these results suggest that the MRJPs have an important role in the pleiotropic interactions between reproduction and nutrition in the regulation of worker's division of labor. Surprisingly, the expression of most of the MRJPs in our study did not correlate with the period of high HG activity.",

Nitrogen is an essential and limiting component of biogenic polymers, such as nucleic acids and proteins, animals must obtain it from exogenous sources [56] . In the honeybee, it is possible that nanA contributes to amino acid metabolism. Fibrillin-1 (TC12484_2) is encoded by fbn1 and plays an important role in building the connective tissue of the body [65] . We speculate that fibrillin-1 is important in the construction of the cytoskeleton. The dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family (SDR, TC12462_1) of proteins constitutes a large family of NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases that have critical roles in lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate, cofactor, hormone, and xenobiotic metabolism, as well as in redox sensor mechanisms [66] . It is now clear that SDRs represent one of the oldest protein families and contribute to essential functions and interactions in all domains of life, which highlights their versatility and fundamental importance in metabolic processes. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90, TC15215_1) is an abundant and highly conserved molecular chaperone required for the stability and function of a number of conditionally activated and/or expressed signaling proteins, as well as multiple mutated, chimeric, or overexpressed signaling proteins; HSP90 may promote cell growth and/ or survival [67, 68] . Currently identified HSPs in honeybees are induced either at high temperatures [68] or when the bee suffers from pathogenic infections [69] . Ferritin (TC15170_1) is associated with the vacuolar system and functions as an iron transporter in insects [70, 71] . It is found inside the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the ironrich granules of the fat body of the honeybees [72] .",

The characterization of dynamic protein networks through the use of proteomics analyses could help us understand the molecular events that occur during HG development. Thus, we produced a comprehensive view of how HGs differentially and developmentally express genes and secrete proteins and other molecules according to age and stage of development. ",
