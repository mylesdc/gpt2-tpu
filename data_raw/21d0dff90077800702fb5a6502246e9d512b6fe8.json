            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the first highly pathogenic human coronavirus to emerge since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002. Like many coronaviruses, MERS-CoV carries genes that encode multiple accessory proteins that are not required for replication of the genome but are likely involved in pathogenesis. Evasion of host innate immunity through interferon (IFN) antagonism is a critical component of viral pathogenesis. The IFN-inducible oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway activates upon sensing of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Activated RNase L cleaves viral and host single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), which leads to translational arrest and subsequent cell death, preventing viral replication and spread. Here we report that MERS-CoV, a lineage C Betacoronavirus, and related bat CoV NS4b accessory proteins have phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity and antagonize OAS-RNase L by enzymatically degrading 2=,5=-oligoadenylate (2-5A), activators of RNase L. This is a novel function for NS4b, which has previously been reported to antagonize IFN signaling. NS4b proteins are distinct from lineage A Betacoronavirus PDEs and rotavirus gene-encoded PDEs, in having an amino-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) and are localized mostly to the nucleus. However, the expression level of cytoplasmic MERS-CoV NS4b protein is sufficient to prevent activation of RNase L. Finally, this is the first report of an RNase L antagonist expressed by a human or bat coronavirus and provides a specific mechanism by which this occurs. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for evasion of innate immunity by MERS-CoV while also identifying a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",

We found that MERS-CoV NS4b and homologs from related lineage C bat betacoronaviruses BtCoV-SC2013 (SC2013) and BtCoV-HKU5 (HKU5) are members of the 2H-phosphoesterase (2H-PE) enzyme family with phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity. Like murine coronavirus NS2, a previously characterized PDE, MERS NS4b, can antagonize activation of the OAS-RNase L pathway, an interferon-induced potent antiviral activity. Furthermore, MERS-CoV mutants with deletion of genes encoding accessory proteins NS3 to NS5 or NS4b alone or inactivation of the PDE can activate RNase L during infection of Calu-3 cells. Our report may offer a potential target for therapeutic intervention if NS4b proves to be critical to pathogenesis in in vivo models of MERS-CoV infection. SR. 2016 .

            "text": "MERS-CoV, a lineage C Betacoronavirus, has a 30-kb positivesense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome. As with all CoVs, the first 5= two-thirds of the genome consists of the replicase encoded in open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and ORF1b. The remaining 3= one-third encodes the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) as well as accessory proteins (encoded in ORF3 to ORF5 and ORF8b) that are not required for genome replication but likely act as immune antagonists that may be critical for pathogenesis (6) (7) (8) . Indeed, MERS-CoV and other CoVs induce type I interferon (IFN) only weakly and late in infection (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) , suggesting that coronaviruses have evolved mechanisms of immune evasion. Furthermore, there are reports that MERS-CoV accessory protein NS4a (encoded by ORF4a), NS4b (encoded by ORF4b), and NS5 (encoded by ORF5), when overexpressed from plasmids, antagonize type I IFN induction and signaling at various points in the pathways (16) (17) (18) (19) . NS4a is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein (17) . NS4b is detected primarily in the nucleus (16) (17) (18) (19) , making NS4b and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ORF3a-encoded proteins (20, 21) the only known coronavirus proteins thus far to be detected in the nucleus (20, 21) . A MERS-CoV mutant with deletions of ORFs 3 to 5 is attenuated for replication in human airway-derived Calu-3 cells (22) , and a mutant with deletions of ORFs 4a and 4b is attenuated for replication in hepatic carcinoma-derived Huh-7 cells (23) .",

To broaden the search for homologous proteins, we used tertiary structural prediction and homology search by Phyre 2 (31) and I-TASSER (32, 33) . The top scoring structure identified by both servers was the central domain of Rattus norvegicus A kinase anchoring protein 7 isoform gamma or delta (AKAP7\u2425/\u2426) (PDB: 2VFK), a 2H-phosphoesterase (2H-PE) superfamily member with 2=,5=-PDE activity (34) (Fig. 1A) . These enzymes are characterized by two H-\u233d-[ST]-\u233d motifs (where \u233d is a hydrophobic residue) separated by an average of 80 residues (35) . To generate a more accurate predicted structure, the 2H-PE domain of MERS-CoV NS4b was modeled directly on AKAP7 using one-to-one threading on Phyre 2 followed by loop and side chain refinement in Modeller (Fig. 1B) (29, 31) . For comparison, the recently solved structure of lineage A Betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) NS2, a 2H-PE with 2=,5=-PDE activity, is also shown (Fig. 1C) (36) .",

Purified proteins were incubated with various 2-5A substrate concentrations and subsequently used to assess enzyme kinetics via a fluorescence reso-nance energy transfer (FRET)-based RNase L activation assay (29) . Substrate steady-state kinetic studies were performed (see Materials and Methods for details), and the quantity of cleaved 2-5A was determined as a function of time from 180-min progress curves conducted in triplicate. The best-fit parameter estimates are shown in Table 1 . All three proteins were capable of cleaving 2-5A and preventing the activation of RNase L with similar kinetic parameters to MHV NS2. As expected, mutant proteins containing a His-to-Arg mutation in the second catalytic motif were incapable of cleaving 2-5A (Fig. 3A) . Although the activities of all three NS4b proteins were similar to that of MHV NS2 (Fig. 3B) , velocities plateaued at lower concentrations of 2-5A compared with MHV NS2, suggesting that the lineage C proteins become saturated more quickly at higher 2-5A concentrations ( Fig. 3C to E) .",

To investigate OAS-RNase L antagonism in cell culture, using the backbone of catalytically inactive NS2 with the H126R substitution (NS2 H126R ) (MHV Mut ), we constructed chimeric MHVs that express one of the NS4b proteins, and for each chimeric MHV, we constructed a corresponding catalytically inactive mutant, each with a carboxy-terminal Flag tag (18, 34) . In addition, we constructed chimeric MHVs expressing MERS-NS4b with a deletion of the amino-terminal 52 amino acids including the NLS (MHV-MERS\u232c1-52 WT ) as well as its catalytically inactive mutant MHV-MERS\u232c1-52 Mut . Thus, wild-type (WT) or mutant NS4b genes were cloned into the MHV Mut genome in place of MHV ORFs 4a and 4b which encode protein(s) with no known function in MHV replication or pathogenesis (40) (Fig. 4) . To assess expression of NS4b proteins from chimeric viruses, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) derived from mice genetically deficient in RNase L (RNase L \u03ea/\u03ea ) were infected with each of the chimeric viruses in addition to WT MHV and MHV Mut expressing catalytically inactive mutant NS2. (RNase L \u03ea/\u03ea BMM were used rather than B6 BMM because an active PDE is required for robust replication in the latter [29] .) BMM were lysed at 12 h postinfection, and protein lysates were analyzed by Western immunoblotting with antibodies directed against Flag to detect NS4b proteins, antibodies against viral nucleocapsid to assess viral replication, and antibodies against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a loading and transfer control. All NS4b proteins were expressed in RNase L \u03ea/\u03ea BMM but to different extents, and mutant NS4b proteins were expressed at lower levels than WT NS4b proteins were, possibly reflecting reduced protein stability as a result of the mutations (Fig. 5A ).

Thus, immunofluorescence staining was carried out to assess expression and subcellular localization of expression of each NS4b protein. Murine L2 cells were infected with chimeric viruses expressing both MERS-CoV NS4b and corresponding CoV homologs, fixed at 8 h postinfection, and stained with anti-Flag antibodies (NS4b) and antibodies against the MHV nucleocapsid protein, which is expressed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B ). Interest-ingly, MERS-CoV and BtCoV-SC2013 NS4b proteins localized to the nucleus with expression in the cytoplasm as well, while the BtCoV-HKU5 NS4b homolog was almost completely nuclear, similar to reports of overexpressed NS4b in the literature (16) (17) (18) .

NS4b proteins rescue replication of MHV Mut in B6 BMM by antagonizing RNase L. NS2 expression is necessary for robust replication of MHV in BMM derived from B6 BMM (WT) but is not required in RNase L \u03ea/\u03ea BMM (7, 29) . To elucidate the roles of the NS4b proteins in the context of viral infection, we inoculated B6 BMM or RNase L \u03ea/\u03ea BMM with wild-type MHV (MHV WT ) or MHV expressing a catalytically inactive NS2 (MHV Mut ) as well as chimeric MHV Mut expressing either WT or mutant MERS-CoV (both full-length and with amino acids 1 to 52 deleted) and BtCoV-SC2013 NS4b proteins (see Fig. 4 for schematics of the chimeric viruses). All three WT NS4b proteins, but not mutant NS4b proteins, were able to rescue MHV Mut replication in WT BMM ( Fig. 6A to D). Similar results were obtained for the pair of viruses expressing BtCoV HKU5 NS4b proteins (data not shown). MHV expressing MERS-CoV WT NS4b (MHV-MERS WT ) replicated to a titer equivalent to that of WT MHV. Viruses expressing the BtCoV homologs replicated well in B6 BMM but not quite to the same extent as WT MHV or MHV-MERS WT , similar to findings with the chimeric viruses expressing PDE of RVA VP3 CTD and cellular AKAP7 protein (28, 34) ( Fig. 6D and data not shown). As expected, viruses expressing mutant as well as WT NS4b proteins replicated to high titer in RNase L \u03ea/\u03ea BMM. Although localization of NS4b proteins was primarily nuclear, these results demonstrate that the level of expression of NS4b PDE at low levels in the cytoplasm was sufficient to rescue replication in MHV-MERS-and MHV-SC2013-infected B6 BMM.",

NS4b, but not NS4b Mut , rescued MHV Mut replication to MHV WT levels in B6 mice (Fig. 7) .

In fact, NS4a is a dsRNA binding protein that may help sequester viral dsRNA and prevent stimulation of OAS and subsequent activation of RNase L (17, 18) . In addition, since NS4a and NS4b are expressed from the same mRNA by an unknown mechanism of initiation of translation, it is possible that deletion of ORF4b could result in increased expression of the upstream ORF encoding NS4a and increased dsRNA binding and inhibition of RNase L, negating the need for a PDE to antagonize RNase L. Thus, we constructed MERS-NS4b H182R , expressing NS4b with an inactive PDE, and assessed its replication and ability to active RNase L in Calu-3 cells. While MERS-NS4b H182R replicated similarly to WT MERS (data not shown), it did promote RNase L degradation and like the deletion mutants only at late times postinfection (Fig. 8D) .",

The type I IFN response is an essential component of the antiviral innate immune response and is activated when host sensors detect viral dsRNA, leading to production of type I IFN (9, 10, 24) . IFN activates transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), leading to the development of an antiviral state in the infected cells and in neighboring cells, thereby restricting viral spread. Based on overexpression experiments, it was previously reported that MERS-CoV NS4b and HKU5 NS4b proteins antagonize type I IFN signaling by several different methods, including interaction with Tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/IB kinase (IKK), leading to inhibition of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and subsequent beta interferon (IFN-\u2424) transcription (16, 18, 19) . It was recently shown by overexpression of NS4b and an IFN-\u2424 promoter reporter plasmid that MERS-CoV NS4b interacts with as yet unknown nuclear targets inhibiting IRF3-and IRF7-induced IFN-\u2424 transcription (19) . It is important to note that there is little if any information on IFN antagonism during MERS-CoV infection, and none of these reports recognized the enzymatic activity of NS4b proteins. Nevertheless, the previous publications in combination with our current study of the enzymatic activity of NS4b proteins suggest that NS4b proteins are multifunctional with activities in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, consistent with its localization in both cellular compartments.",

            "text": "Searches for sequence homology between MERS-CoV NS4b in protein databases were unsuccessful. However, NS4b was predicted by tertiary structural modeling to be a 2H-PE and the fact that it is conserved in all sequenced lineage C Betacoronavirus genomes suggested that NS4b is an enzymatically active 2=,5=-PDE (29) , as confirmed in this study. Furthermore, NS4b protein antagonizes the OAS-RNase L pathway by cleaving 2-5A and blocking the subsequent activation of RNase L (7, 29) . Additionally, closely related lineage C Betacoronavirus BtCoV-SC2013 and BtCoV-HKU5 NS4b proteins are enzymatically active PDEs with similar activity to MERS-CoV NS4b. We have demonstrated that these lineage C proteins can cleave 2-5A in vitro and that their kinetic parameters are similar to those of NS2. Limitation of RNase L activation can have a profound effect on enhancing virus replication and spread as well as leading to decreased IFN production in myeloid cells (7, 29, 42) . Indeed, we previously found that the 2=,5=-PDE of MHV NS2 is a determinant of myeloid cell tropism and a critical liver virulence factor in mice (29) . Thus, to initially assess the effectiveness of NS4b proteins, we utilized the chimeric MHV NS2 mutant virus system that was previously used to demonstrate activity for RVA and AKAP PDEs (28, 34) . Lineage C PDEs were expressed from chimeric MHV with an NS2 Mut background, encoding an inactive PDE. MERS-CoV NS4b and BtCoV homologs were detected by immunoblotting to different extents, as normalized to the amount of MHV nucleocapsid protein detected, with the mutant proteins less well expressed compared to WT proteins. The different levels of expression of WT proteins and the more efficient expression of the WT PDEs compared to the corresponding mutant proteins was observed in both BMM and murine 17Cl-1 fibroblasts (Fig. 5 and data not shown), suggesting that there may be differences in stability in the WT proteins and that the mutant proteins may be less stable. Nevertheless, we were able to rescue replication in murine BMM with wild-type MHV-MERS, wild-type BtCoV-2013 (Fig. 6) , and wild-type BtCoV-HKU5 (data not shown) but not with viruses expressing corresponding mutant PDEs and in the case of MHV-MERS WT , but not MHV-MERS Mut , in vivo in the mouse liver as well. Since the NS4b catalytic mutants used here are poorly expressed, they do not provide the ideal control and we cannot rule out the possibility that either one or more would rescue at a higher expression level or that factors other than the PDE activity contribute to rescue. This, however, is highly unlikely, as we know from several previous studies (28, 29, 34) that efficient expression of catalytic mutant PDE does not rescue replication of MHV NS2 mutant virus, while supplying with heterologous PDE does (28, 29, 34) .",

Murine AKAP7, which contains an NLS, can rescue only chimeric PDE-deficient MHV in the absence of the NLS (34) . Interestingly, it is unnecessary to remove the NLS from the MERS and SC2013 NS4b proteins to achieve rescue of chimeric MHV, and in fact, removal of the N-terminal 52 amino acids, including the NLS, of MERS-CoV NS4b confers no replication enhancement (Fig. 6) , suggesting that the NLS neither hinders nor improves OAS-RNase L antagonism. Recombinant HKU5 NS4b clearly has 2=,5=-PDE activity (Fig. 3) , and MHV-HKU5 WT (but not MHV-HKU5 Mut ) clearly replicates efficiently in B6 BMM (data not shown), demonstrating that HKU5 NS4b can replace the function of NS2 in the MHV chimeric background. However, there was still detectable RNA cleavage in BMM infected with both MHV-HKU5 WT and MHV-HKU5 Mut (data not shown). The most likely explanation is that BtCoV-HKU5 NS4b does not antagonize RNase L activation as well as MERS-CoV or BtCoV SC2013 NS4b does, because it is more localized to the nucleus, consistent with our findings with the PDE of AKAP7 (34) . It is also possible the rRNA is more susceptible to cleavage than viral RNA; therefore, the less effective BtCoV-HKU5 NS4b cannot antagonize RNase L effectively enough to spare rRNA while still protecting viral and/or cellular mRNA.",

Although all mutants induced rRNA degradation, only MERS-\u232cNS3-5 had a reduction in viral titer by 24 h postinfection. Thus, the lack of effect on replication of MERS-\u232cNS4 or MERS-NS4b H182R correlates with the weak rRNA degradation observed and indicates a lack of biological effect in this cell type of deleting or inactivating the NS4b PDE. This may be due in part to the very late times postinfection (24 to 48 h) that we observe rRNA degradation; virus replication is already quite robust by that time, and it may be too late for restriction of replication to occur.",

The use of Calu-3 epithelial airway cells may explain the lack of restriction of MERS-\u232cNS4b replication and only 10-fold reduction for MERS-\u232cNS3-5, when in murine BMM, abrogation of RNase L antagonism by MHV, which is observed by 9 h postinfection, leads to 100-to 1,000-fold reduction in viral titers. Indeed, RNase L is not readily activated in Calu-3 cells compared to other cell types; the amount of rRNA degradation observed in Sindbis virus-infected A549 cells is clearly more than in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 8A) , and we did not observe robust activation of RNase L Calu-3 cells even when transfected with the dsRNA surrogate poly(I \u00b7 C) (data not shown).

The truncated NS4b cassette and MERS-CoV infectious clone F plasmid were digested with PacI and SanDI, and truncated NS4b was ligated into the MERS-CoV F plasmid. To construct the MERS-NS4b H182R mutant, two PCRs were performed using the F plasmid as the template to synthesize overlapping DNA fragments and introducing an H182R substitution. These two templates were then joined in an overlapping extension PCR. The resultant product was digested with PacI and SanDI and cloned into the MERS F plasmid. Assembly of the infectious clone and recovery of infectious virus were performed as described previously (22) .

Images were acquired using NIS-Elements Basic Research microscope imaging software (Nikon Instruments, Inc.). This was performed at least twice for all viruses.",

Alternatively, Calu-3 cells infected with MERS-CoV, MERS-\u232cNS4b, MERS-\u232cNS3-5, or MERS-NS4b H182R , and at the time points indicated in the figures, RNA was harvested with Trizol (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), extracted with chloroform (Sigma), and precipitated with isopropanol (Sigma). RNA was then separated and analyzed on RNA nanochips with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), and the pseudogels were normalized for concentration (49) . RNA integrity numbers (referred to as RIN values) (50) are measurements of RNA integrity produced by the Agilent Bioanalyzer. RNA from A549 cells infected with Sindbis virus (51) was used as a marker for the pattern of human RNase L-dependent rRNA cleavage products.",
