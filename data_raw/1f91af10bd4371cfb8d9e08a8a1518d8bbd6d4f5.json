Issues can include the low proportion and copy number of viral reads and the high number of contigs (post-assembly), making subsequent viral analysis difficult. Comparison of assembly algorithms with pre-assembly host-mapping subtraction using a short-read mapping tool, a k-mer frequency based filter and a low complexity filter, has been validated for viral discovery with Illumina data derived from naturally infected liver tissue and simulated data. Assembled contig numbers were significantly reduced (up to 99.97%) by the application of these pre-assembly filtering methods. This approach provides a validated method for maximizing viral contig size as well as reducing the total number of assembled contigs that require down-stream analysis as putative viral nucleic acids.",

These approaches use BLAST or optimal alignment algorithms against a range of publicly available data sets to, typically, identify sequence reads to subtract, thereby enriching the experimental data set for non-host (potentially pathogen derived) sequences prior to de novo assembly. However, reported validation/testing studies of this methodology are few or, where they do exist are limited, such as SURPI [9] . This direct comparison of alignment algorithms uses artificially generated human reads and 25,000 viral reads derived randomly from an NCBI 'viridae' search term and 3 NGS samples with known virus. The problem with this approach is firstly the viral database used (~1.2 million entries), which is heavily skewed towards a small number of viral species. Therefore taking a small subset of this is a) unlikely to reflect human viruses, b) unlikely to reflect molecular genetic breadth as defined by Baltimore viral classification and c) may be heavily skewed towards certain virus that are over-represented such as HIV-1. Secondly the human reads in this study are artificially generated and subtracted against a dataset that was the source of the artificial reads themselves resulting in an unrealistic scenario. Additionally, the existing pipelines cited above do not adequately examine potential downstream advantages of host read subtraction on assembly in relation to reduced contig numbers, changes to pathogen contig length and assembly accuracy.",

            "text": "De novo assembly of complete or subtraction-reduced read datasets into contigs can dramatically reduce the number of sequences that need to be put through homology search programs. The increased length of contigs over primary sequence reads allows greater certainty that homology hits are accurate. Additionally, when searching for novel pathogens, the generation of large contigs from sequence reads that do not possess significant similarity to any nucleic acid sequence in the reference databases may also indicate the presence of a novel, highly divergent pathogen. A potential problem with this method is the copy number of the viral pathogen itself. Despite the depth of sequence information from current NGS platforms, optimal coverage may be limited due to the sub-optimal quality of rare clinical samples or naturally low level of viral nucleic acids. For example, high quality total RNA from multiple biopsy sections of liver tissue naturally infected by Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), when Illumina sequenced, revealed only four viral reads per million [11] . The low coverage restricted the use of de novo assembly algorithms, a vital step in novel pathogen discovery. The use of de novo assembly is further complicated by the number of assembly programs available as well as the choice of settings to use within them. Unfortunately, direct comparisons of de novo assembly algorithms in the literature are often sub-optimally validated for these specific requirements or are unreported. More rigorous algorithm comparisons have been focused on bacterial genome characterization, many times larger and less variable than many viral genomes [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . An assembly algorithm that is ideal for transcriptome assembly is often not suitable for genome assembly. Desai et al [21] have highlighted the need for improved testing of assembly algorithms emphasizing both the use of real data rather than a reliance on simulated sets and an increased focus on testing assembly accuracy rather than just contig length and number. A review of novel viral discovery literature and related pipelines [2, 3, 5, [9] [10] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] makes it clear that there is very little agreement between groups on the optimal viral discovery pipeline. More than half of the successful viral discovery papers reviewed used de novo assembly as a first step followed by a BLAST search of existing databases with no subtraction step. Additionally, assembly parameters varied from 100% similarity over 18 nt to 85% similarity over 25 nt and the BLASTn e-value parameter varied from 10 to 10-5. Others use a +ve or-ve subtraction process in the first instance. It is essential for this field to define optimal methodologies in order to circumvent both time and computationally inefficient tests but also to provide the researcher with high certainty that subtraction methodologies do not unnecessarily remove pathogen sequence just for the sake of speed and that available de novo assemblers are compared and optimized. Here we have used NGS data sets derived from naturally virally infected human liver biopsies, an artificial viral pathogen 'metagenomics' dataset modified using a profile based read emulator [41] in the context of a large human liver derived 'host' read dataset and idiopathic hepatitis liver samples, in order to explore and validate filtration, subtraction and assembly methods for novel viral discovery useful to the researcher directly or as an adjunct to existing fast pipelines.",

            "text": "Illumina sequence read host mapping subtraction and k-mer filtering A database of 62 human virus chromatids from 35 distinct viruses were used to generate simulated Illumina read pairs (10x coverage depth) with the use of pIRS (methods). These paired reads (167,004) were combined with 16.7 million Illumina paired sequence reads from a 'clean' healthy liver sample (methods). Using the mapping algorithms CLC, BWA and Bowtie (methods) we investigated the percentage subtraction of host and viral sequence reads following mapping to human reference sequence data sets including the human genome, the human mitochondrial genome and a human rRNA sequence set (see methods) [ Fig 2] . Mapper settings equivalent to 90% homology over 80% of the sequence read length (0.8/0.9) subtracted 95% +/-0.2% of the host-derived Illumina reads without a major loss of viral sequence reads (0.02% +/-0.005) for the algorithms tested [ Fig 2] (Bowtie data not included for clarity). Analysis of the subtracted viral sequence reads at this mapping stringency revealed that they were exclusively homopolymeric tracts and / or repeats with a low % GC content. Consequently, this mapping stringency was used for subsequent validation studies. Mapping of the remaining (un-subtracted) sequences to the viral references revealed no gaps in coverage relative to the non-subtracted original read set. We further characterized the effect of subtracting host sequences using the human genome build/mitochondria and the rRNA reference sets independently, with Illumina (100nt, paired-end) data sets [ Fig 3] derived from Total RNA, randomly primed and amplified, from idiopathic liver samples (n = 10). The greatest number of host sequence reads was subtracted through mapping to the human genome including the mitochondria (87.4 \u00b1 4.3%, arithmetic mean \u00b1 standard deviation) with an average of 2.1 \u00b1 1.3% of the host sequence reads subtracted by mapping to the human rRNA data set alone. The use of both reference data sets was additive, with 89.2% of Illumina reads removed. Additionally we applied hostmapping subtraction to our rRNA references with Illumina paired read sets (n = 10) derived from nuclease treated liver cytosolic samples (an encapsidated virus enrichment protocol) [8] (see enriched, Fig 3) . Mapping to the rRNA set subtracted 17.9% \u00b1 13.6% of the reads showing the potential benefit for rRNA mapping subtraction prior to assembly in this context. We next tested the effect of sequence read subtraction using Kontaminant (methods), a newly developed tool for read filtering developed at the Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC), Norwich, UK [42] . We again used our artificial Illumina paired-end viral read set embedded in healthy liver derived Illumina paired-end reads (as described above). Following k-mer filtering the data set was reduced to 67,432 reads. 99.997% of the human liver reads and 4.7% of the viral reads were removed (not including duplicates) [Fig 4] . The GC % content profile of the viral reads that were filtered mirrored the unfiltered viral reads. Additionally, mapping of the remaining (unfiltered) reads to the reference viral genomes revealed that minimal gaps in coverage were present (0.6 \u00b1 0.6%) at the reference terminal ends only, relative to the unfiltered read set.",

The reads were assembled using four algorithms: Velvet [43] , Meta-Cortex [44] [45] , ABySS [46] and CLC and a range of word sizes. ABySS, Velvet and CLC are genomic assemblers, while MetaCortex is a development of the Cortex assembler aimed at highly diverse metagenomic datasets. The longest viral contigs assembled (as a % of the reference genome length) by each algorithm over a range of word sizes is shown in Fig 5. The CLC algorithm consistently produced the greatest length of reference genome coverage for every sample across the range of depths of viral sequence coverage. Interestingly, the assembly programs Velvet, MetaCortex and Abyss were generally less effective at the 200x deep viral coverage compared to the 20x coverage. The artificial viral sequence dataset was also de novo assembled using CLC v6.5 with extensive testing of the word sizes revealing an optimal word size of 21 (data not shown).",

The range for the single largest viral contig size was -14.3% to +9.7% across the range of assemblers and datasets relative to assembly alone.

We also investigated the effect of using DUST in combination with k-mer filtering and host mapping subtraction using the real Illumina NGS data sets with 0.7-200x depth of viral coverage. Filtering out the low complexity reads had no effect on the assembly of viral contigs, alone or in combination with other filtering/ subtractive processes for the 9x, 20x and 200x deep viral coverage sets [Fig 8] . However for the 0.7x viral coverage set, the use of the low complexity filter alone reduced the total length of the reference genome covered and largest viral contig size by 32% and 52% respectively compared to assembly with no low complexity filtering. A similarly negative effect was seen on the largest viral contig size generated when low complexity filtering was used in combination with host mapping subtraction relative to host mapping subtraction alone. Low complexity filtering together with k-mer filtering resulted in a similar output to k-mer filtering alone. The combination of host mapping subtraction, k-mer filtering and low complexity filtering negatively affected the largest viral contig assembled (a 47% reduction compared to k-mer filtering and hostmapping subtraction without the addition of low complexity filtering). Total reference coverage was comparable to assembly alone, the kmer filtering and host mapping subtraction alone, or in combination. Overall, no advantage of using DUST was apparent. It is important to note that the 0.7x and 9x viral coverage read sets (both from HCV infected liver) did not include sequence reads spanning the 3' proximal homopolymeric T tract of HCV. Thus the contig reduction observed was not due to removal of sequence reads containing this tract. We further investigated the effect of using DUST on the total number of contigs generated [Fig 9] . Overall the use of DUST, on its own or in combination with host-mapping subtraction, resulted in up to 33.8% more contigs assembled (greater than read size).

Application of read subtraction filtering and optimal de novo assembly to idiopathic hepatitis liver samples Two human hepatitis liver samples clinically defined as idiopathic (explanted liver from the transplant setting) and confirmed as negative for hepatitis associated viruses prior to transplant were processed for total RNA and SISPA processed for Illumina NGS as described in materials and methods. Sample 1 (121 million 100nt reads) and sample 2 (105 million reads 100nt reads) were filtered by the application of a short read mapper, with and without the application of the k-mer filter (Kontaminant). Read subtraction following these processes is shown in Fig 12A with subtraction levels comparable to the artificial metagenomics dataset and the control viral sets used previously. Optimal de novo assembly yielded contig numbers again commensurate with the previously tested control samples with an approximate decrease in contigs following the application of the short read mapper subtraction of~100-fold for both idiopathic samples tested. Secondary application of the k-mer filter decreased the contig numbers further for samples 1 and 2 by 90% (620 contigs assembled) and 83% respectively (8027 contigs assembled) and shown in Fig 12B.

Problems include homology of viral sequences to host, the low ratio of virus to host sequence reads, and the low absolute number of viral reads which restricts the use of assembly algorithms to generate larger viral contigs. Perhaps most importantly, this field lacks adequately validated computational methods for subtraction of non-viral (host) sequence reads from NGS data sets whereby the 'filtering cost' (the chance of losing viral sequences following the application of host sequence filtering methods and the effect on assembled contigs) is ascertained and reported and where multiple algorithms are legitimately compared with real as well as synthetic sample sequence sets. Additionally, the large number of contigs generated from de novo assembly of unfiltered data sets restricts downstream analysis. We have explored and validated a range of computational filtration / subtraction methods using a combination of Illumina NGS data sets derived from viral infected liver tissues covering a range of viral coverage depths, together with an Illumina read simulated data set containing a broad range of viral sequence reads embedded with a large dataset of non-synthetic human liver reads. In the context of viral discovery, we have characterized the effects of these pre-assembly methods according to changes in post-assembly viral contig size, viral genome coverage of all contigs and the total numbers of contigs assembled (a potentially important factor with down-stream contig characterization) as well as back to back comparisons of several popular de novo assemblers.",

            "text": "We first characterized NGS read reduction potential using two distinct approaches [Figs 2-4] together with optimal k-mer word size optimization for a range of assembly algorithms [ Fig  5] . Defined host-mapping subtraction, k-mer filtering and de novo assembly settings were then applied to our five data sets [ and two idiopathic hepatitis liver datasets [Fig 12] . Post-assembly analysis of our data suggests host read mapping subtraction using a short read mapping tool did not compromise, in some cases significantly improved, the likelihood of assembling longer viral contigs. Furthermore, we have shown that this subtraction method will dramatically reduce the number of contigs subsequently assembled. Unsurprisingly, given our efforts to standardize the mapping algorithms we compared, we did not see a great difference between them. In terms of bulk reduction of host sequence, the removal of viral reads and the effect on assembled contig numbers, these algorithms are largely similar and ultimately it is up to the user to choose the stringency according to their own cost / benefit assessment. Nevertheless, we have shown that parsing the unmapped reads according to differing percentage read length and similarity mappings will allow the subtraction of the vast majority of host reads with very little likely loss of viral pathogen sequence. However, the point at which viral sequences begin to be removed by these short read aligners still leaves a large number of real host reads unsubtracted from our test dataset. The consequence of this is that the number of contigs assembled by subsequent de novo assembly is still very high and remains computationally expensive and time consuming to screen by homology to a complete nucleotides database particularly at the amino acid level. To attempt to further subtract the host reads with a view to further reducing the number of contigs subsequently assembled we employed the contaminant removal software (Kontaminant). Host read subtraction using Kontaminant was greater than subtraction using the short read mapping tools tested but with the consequence that, postassembly, the maximum viral contig sizes as a percentage of the viral references were generally reduced relative to identical sets that were not filtered using Kontaminant. However, considering all five of our read sets together, the increase/ reduction in largest viral contig size, following the application of Kontaminant (pre-assembly) ranged from a 66.7% reduction up to an increase of 30.4%. The overall mean showed a reduction of 6.53% with an SD of 20.59%. We believe that this negative effect would, in general, not compromise viral characterization particularly when viewed in its proper context, as an initial first-pass approach to viral discovery in short read NGS data derived from eukaryotic tissues. In this context, the primary requisites are confidence that the assembler chosen and the k-mer size choice is appropriate to maximize viral contig size and that the total number of assembled contigs is reduced without removing putative pathogen sequence, facilitating the speed and ease of post-assembly analysis. The use of Kontaminant might therefore be considered as a 2nd step process after the optimized first step use of short read aligners (BWA, BT2 CLC mapper etc). The further reduced (post-assembly) contig set from step 2 can then be used to extract the longer, more complete contigs assembled after step 1 only.",

Comparison with the SURPI pipeline [ Fig 13] indicates that SNAP is a good choice as a human database subtraction aligner with assembled contig numbers following this process broadly equivalent to our 1 st step processes. Viral reads lost at the SURPI pre-processing step may be due to the inclusion of the dust module and may be relatively more important were viral coverage is very low. The poor performance of the de-novo assembly component of the SURPI pipeline again highlights the need for rigorous optimization to increase viral contig size if one is to maximize the potential for identifying highly divergent viral species rather than ultimately relying on high identity with viral sequences in the public domain with short Illumina reads.",

The first step consists of subtraction using standard aligning tools (BWA, BT2, CLC mapper etc.) which can be validated using a broad range of viral sequences modified by an emulator to mirror genuine host read data in which they are embedded. Stringencies defined to maximize the subtraction of host whilst minimizing subtraction of viral sequences can then be applied to the novel sequence datasets to provide a reduced set that significantly improves the subsequent assembly of viral contigs whilst ensuring that the assembled contig number is dramatically reduced for subsequent direct analyses if required.",

The overall dramatically reduced set is small enough to directly use BLASTn and even tBLASTx to a complete NCBInt database due to the contig numbers typically being less than 10 3 (+/-50%) determined by us using over 50x idiopathic liver sample (total RNA) Illumina sequenced with a read depth average of 160 million placing this 'high certainty' viral discovery approach in the hands of the small laboratory with standard desktop equipment.",

K-mer size was varied from 21 to 71 in steps of 10 (unless otherwise stated) in order to determine optimum k-mer size for the 76bp reads. Apart from varying k-mer size (word size), default settings were used for all assemblers from our observation that gap / extension costs and bubble size (branch collapse distances) had a marginal effect and were broadly similar at default (data not shown) with 100nt reads. distance at 327.96nt with an SD of 77.1 with the read lengths universally set at 100nt as with the clean liver reads. Additionally, pIRS was used to generate different depths of viral sequence coverage (0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 100x coverage data sets). The different viral coverage data sets were then separately embedded into~17,200,000 paired-end reads from the healthy liver FASTQ set used to 'train' the pIRS software. Optimal word size assembly was determined with the use of CLC Bio assembler v6.1, (Arhus, Denmark) to assemble contigs across a range of word sizes [13, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 31, 41, 49] . Optimal word size was determined with all coverage sets by mapping the assembled contigs to the original collated viral genome dataset described using CLC Bio Mapper v6.1, (Arhus, Denmark). The largest viral contigs and total reference coverage of all contigs was optimal at a word size of 21 for all the datasets (0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 100x coverage data sets). Assembled contigs covering >90% of each viral reference required 10x read coverage or greater. Consequently, the 10x coverage set was used to subsequently validate the effects of the k-mer frequency filter (Kontaminant) and the hostmapping subtraction processes. The artificial 10x coverage viral data-set included 70,602 viral paired reads combined with 17.2 x 106 human liver paired reads). Additional data sets used to ascertain percentage host-mapping subtraction by individual reference sets (see Host mapping subtraction details below and Fig 3) were derived from ten idiopathic liver biopsies processed for total RNA and separately for cytosolic viral enriched fractions, as with the HBV and HCV sets [11] . Samples were sequenced with the Illumina Hi-Seq 2500 100 nt paired-end protocol. Average total RNA set read sizes were 190 million paired reads.

To use the tool, a k-mer library is first made from a reference-in our case, human reference GRCh37 from the Genome Reference Consortium. The k-mer library is created by sliding a window of size k over the reference, base-by-base, creating k-mers as it moves. Reads are then filtered by scanning FASTQ files through Kontaminant and comparing k-mers in reads with the k-mers in the reference. A read is filtered (discarded) if the number of shared k-mers with the reference is greater than or equal to a threshold value (the default, 1 kmer, was used). A k-mer size of 21 was used. Observations have shown that k-mers of this size tend to be unique amongst different species and should be more than large enough to differentiate between viral and human genomes [50] [51] . Multiple idiopathic hepatitis liver sample (100nt Illumina NGS reads) datasets were used to benchmark the use of Kontaminant at >50 million reads/hour/core using a standard multi-core desktop computer with a modern version of unix installed).",

The blastn program was used with default settings. To ascertain if there were any chimeric contigs, all BLAST hits were examined for each contig. If a contig partially aligned with 75% identity to both the human reference and a viral reference, it was flagged as chimeric. No such contigs were found for any of the assemblers. 3) Non-chimeric contigs matching the viral references were extracted as a FASTA file and mapped to the references. This process allowed common reference contigs to be overlaid on their respective reference sequences to ascertain a) the total reference coverage, b) the coverage of the largest contig, c) to observe the degree of consensus identity to the reference and to discount contig terminal end mismatching from the coverage and contig size estimations. The nucleotide sequences of all the resulting viral contigs deviated from the reference by less than 1%. Standard N25-N90 values used (defined as the smallest contig of a minimal set of contigs required to achieve coverage of the viral reference indicated, expressed as a % of the reference coverage).
