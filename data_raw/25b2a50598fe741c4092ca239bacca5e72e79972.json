Viruses are a major cause of recreationally-associated waterborne diseases linked to pools, lakes, ponds, thermal pools/spas, rivers, and hot springs. They can make their way into waters through the accidental release of fecal matter, body fluids (saliva, mucus), or skin flakes by symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers. We present an updated overview of epidemiological data on viral outbreaks, a project motivated, among other things, by the availability of improved viral detection methodologies. Special attention is paid to outbreak investigations (source of the outbreak, pathways of transmission, chlorination/disinfection). Epidemiological studies on incidents of viral contamination of swimming pools under non-epidemic conditions are also reviewed.",

Quantitative data were also obtained by Real-time PCR. Application of these results in an exponential risk assessment model, assuming a daily ingestion of 30 mL of water during swimming, indicated a daily risk of infection ranging from 1.92 \u00d7 10 \u22123 to 3.69 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . No acceptable microbial risk has thus far been established for swimming pool water. However, pool water quality is generally considered comparable to drinking water quality (absence of fecal indicators and pathogens). For this reason, a maximum of one infection per 10,000 consumers per year has been recommended as an acceptable level of microbial risk for swimming pools. The risk of HAdV infections calculated for the swimming pool water in the study exceeded this acceptable risk.",

Moreover, the study was the first to examine the occurrence of non-enteric viruses in swimming pool waters: human papillomavirus (HPV) and human polyomavirus (HPyV). Interestingly, enteric viruses were not detected, while both HPVs and HPyVs were identified in 9/14 swimming pool water samples, by means of molecular methods. Neither of these viruses had previously been recognized as potential recreational waterborne pathogens, although the WHO Guidelines for safe recreational water environments do include HPVs among non-fecally-derived viruses as viruses associated with plantar warts [3] . A variety of HPVs and HPyVs were found in another study investigating spa/pool waters in Rome [44] .",

Nevertheless, there are likely to have been many other undetected cases and outbreaks. In fact, waterborne diseases are difficult to record because of their wide variety, the difficulty associating symptoms with water use/contact, and the limitations of pathogen detection methods. In the studies described, viruses responsible for reported cases were detected in pool waters only in 21% of the outbreaks, and were found to match with viruses of clinical origin. Currently, better and more rapid methods for the detection of viruses in water samples are available than in the past, resulting in better studies and improved reporting of viral recreational outbreaks worldwide. This allows researchers to identify the causes of outbreaks and possible contributing factors for them. An excellent model to follow is the US-Waterborne Disease and Outbreak Surveillance System (WBDOSS) that has been collecting and reporting data related to occurrences and causes of waterborne disease outbreaks associated with drinking and recreational waters since 1971.",
