            "text": "The newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to infect humans and camels, calling for efficient, cost-effective, and broad-spectrum strategies to control its spread. Nanobodies (Nbs) are single-domain antibodies derived from camelids and sharks and are potentially cost-effective antivirals with small size and great expression yield. In this study, we developed a novel neutralizing Nb (NbMS10) and its human-Fc-fused version (NbMS10-Fc), both of which target the MERS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We further tested their receptor-binding affinity, recognizing epitopes, cross-neutralizing activity, half-life, and efficacy against MERS-CoV infection. Both Nbs can be expressed in yeasts with high yield, bind to MERS-CoV RBD with high affinity, and block the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to the MERS-CoV receptor. The binding site of the Nbs on the RBD was mapped to be around residue Asp539, which is part of a conserved conformational epitope at the receptor-binding interface. NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc maintained strong cross-neutralizing activity against divergent MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans and camels. Particularly, NbMS10-Fc had significantly extended half-life in vivo; a single-dose treatment of NbMS10-Fc exhibited high prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy by completely protecting humanized mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. Overall, this study proves the feasibility of producing cost-effective, potent, and broad-spectrum Nbs against MERS-CoV and has produced Nbs with great potentials as anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Therapeutic development is critical for preventing and treating continual MERS-CoV infections in humans and camels. Because of their small size, nanobodies (Nbs) have advantages as antiviral therapeutics (e.g., high expression yield and robustness for storage and transportation) and also potential limitations (e.g., low antigen-binding affinity and fast renal clearance). Here, we have developed novel Nbs that specifically target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike protein. They bind to a conserved site on MERS-CoV RBD with high affinity, blocking RBD's binding to MERS-CoV receptor. Through engineering a C-terminal human Fc tag, the in vivo half-life of the Nbs is significantly extended. Moreover, the Nbs can potently cross-neutralize the infections of diverse MERS-CoV strains isolated from humans and camels. The Fc-tagged Nb also completely protects humanized mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. Taken together, our study has discovered A novel nanobody targeting Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) receptor-binding domain has potent crossneutralizing activity and protective efficacy against MERS-CoV.

To construct the Nb (i.e., VHH) library, we immunized llama with recombinant MERS-CoV RBD (residues 377 to 588, EMC2012 strain) containing a C-terminal human IgG1 Fc tag (i.e., RBD-Fc) and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the immunized llama. After four rounds of bio-panning and screening using MERS-CoV RBD-Fc, we isolated a positive clone with the highest binding affinity for the RBD. The gene encoding this RBD-specific Nb was subcloned into yeast expression vector to construct NbMS10 (which contains a C-terminal His 6 tag) and NbMS10-Fc (which contains a C-terminal human IgG1 Fc tag) Nbs (Fig. 1) . Both NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc were NbMS10-Fc Nbs. Blood was collected from MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein-immunized alpaca after the last immunization to isolate PBMCs. RNA was then extracted to synthesize cDNA via RT-PCR. This was followed by PCR amplification of the N-terminal IgG heavy-chain fragment (\u03f3700 bp), including the VHH gene, while the latter was used as the template to amplify the VHH gene fragment (\u03f3300 to 450 bp). The VHH DNA sequence was further ligated into phagemid vector pCANTAB5e and transformed into E. coli TG1 competent cells to construct VHH library. VHH phage display was carried out to isolate RBD-specific clones. After four rounds of bio-panning, the RBD-specific VHH coding sequence was confirmed from the selected positive clones. The identified VHH coding gene containing a C-terminal His 6 or human IgG1 Fc was inserted into Pichia pastoris yeast expression vector pPICZ\u2423A to construct NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc, respectively, for further soluble expression and purification. expressed in yeast cells, secreted into the cell culture supernatants, and purified to homogeneity ( Fig. 2A, left) . The estimated molecular weights were about 16 kDa for NbMS10 and 50 kDa for NbMS10-Fc, since the latter formed a dimer. These MERS-CoV RBD-specific Nbs from llama, but not severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RBD-specific MAbs from mice, were recognized by anti-llama antibodies ( Fig. 2A, right) . Thus, the yeast-expressed Nbs maintained their native conformation and antigenicity.",

Second, we determined the binding affinity of the two Nbs for MERS-CoV RBD using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The result showed that the K d between NbMS10 and RBD-Fc was 0.87 nM, The Nbs were subjected to SDS-PAGE (left) or Western blotting (right), followed by detection using anti-llama antibody. The molecular weight marker (in kDa) is indicated on the left. (B) Detection of binding between NbMS10 or NbMS10-Fc and MERS-CoV S1 (MERS-S1) or RBD (MERS-RBD) protein by ELISA.

To investigate the mechanism underlying the neutralizing activities of Nbs, we evaluated the competition between the Nbs and hDPP4 for the binding to MERS-CoV RBD. First, we carried out a flow cytometry assay where recombinant MERS-CoV RBD interacted with cell-surface-expressed DPP4 in the presence or absence of recombinant Nbs. The result showed that both Nbs significantly blocked the binding of RBD to cell-surface DPP4 in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 3A and B) . As a negative control, SARS-CoV-RBDspecific 33G4 MAb did not block the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and cell surface DPP4 ( Fig. 3A and B) . Second, we carried out an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) where recombinant MERS-CoV RBD and recombinant hDPP4 interacted in the presence or absence of recombinant Nbs. The result showed that both Nbs, but not were coated with MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein (2 g/ml), followed by sequential incubation with serial dilutions of Nbs or hDPP4 protein (2 g/ml), goat anti-hDPP4, and HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibodies. The percent inhibition was calculated as the RBD-hDPP4 binding in the presence or absence of Nbs according to the following formula: (1 \u03ea RBD-hDPP4-Nb/RBD-hDPP4) \u03eb 100.

We further investigated the role of Asp539 in Nb binding using the MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry assay. Neither NbMS10 nor NbMS10-Fc could neutralize the cell entry of MERS-CoV pseudovirus bearing the D539A mutation, again confirming that residue Asp539 is critical for Nb binding (Fig. 4B ).

These MERS-CoV strains all contain mutations in their RBDs. The results showed that both Nbs potently neutralized the cell entry of all of the MERS-CoV pseudoviruses, with the ND 50 values ranging from 0.003 to 0.979 g/ml (for NbMS10) and from 0.003 to 0.067 g/ml (for NbMS10-Fc) ( Table 1) .

Because camels likely serve as the transmission hosts for MERS-CoV and also because humans have contact with camels, the constant and continuing transmissions of MERS-CoV from camels to humans make it difficult to eradicate MERS-CoV from the human population. Thus, efficacious, cost-effective, and broad-spectrum anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents are needed to prevent and treat MERS-CoV infections in both humans and camels. Nbs have been gaining acceptance as antiviral agents because of their small size, good tissue permeability, and cost-effective production, storage, and transportation. However, their small size may also lead to relative low antigen-binding affinity and quick clearance from the host body. In this study, we have developed a novel MERS-CoVtargeting Nb, NbMS10, and its Fc-fused version, NbMS10-Fc, both of which demonstrate great promise as anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents.",

First, the Nbs bind to MERS-CoV RBD with high affinities. The K d values for NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc to bind MERS-CoV RBD were 8.71 \u03eb 10 \u03ea10 M and 3.46 \u03eb 10 \u03ea10 M, respectively. The K d values for RBD-targeting conventional IgGs to bind MERS-CoV RBD range from 7.12 \u03eb 10 \u03ea8 M to 4.47 \u03eb 10 \u03ea11 M (29, 35, 36) . Moreover, the ND 50 values for NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc to neutralize MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain) infection in cultured cells were 3.52 and 2.33 g/ml, respectively. The ND 50 values for RBD-specific conventional IgGs to neutralize various MERS-CoV strains ranged from micrograms/ml to nanograms/ml (30, 32, 35, 39, 40) . Thus, the Nbs developed in this study and conventional IgGs reported previously have comparable MERS-CoV RBD-binding affinities and MERS-CoVneutralizing activities. Structural comparisons of conventional IgGs and Nbs have shown that the antigen-binding site of IgGs consists of paired heavy-chain and lightchain variable (VH-VL) domains, whereas Nbs lack the light chain and hence cannot form the paired VH-VL domains (8, 41) . Instead, Nbs have an extended CDR3 region (\u03fe16 amino acid residues), longer than that of the VHs of conventional IgGs (average length 12 amino acid residues) (42) (43) (44) . Moreover, the Nbs developed here contain a 22-amino-acid CDR3; the extended CDR3 enables the Nbs to bind to the antigens with higher affinity (37) . Furthermore, although the single-domain Nb (i.e., NbMS10) is small and can be cleared from the serum relatively quickly, the Fc-fused Nb (i.e., NbMS10-Fc) with relatively increased size demonstrates extended in vivo half-life. Therefore, the potential short half-life of Nbs can be overcome by adding the appropriate tag to the Nbs to increase their half-life. Overall, the present study has shown the feasibility of overcoming the potential limitations of Nbs.",

            "text": "The MERS-CoV RBD-targeting Nbs potently neutralize MERS-CoV entry into host cells. The K d values between the Nbs and MERS-CoV RBD are significantly lower than that between MERS-CoV RBD and hDPP4 receptor. As a result, the Nbs can outcompete hDPP4 for the binding of MERS-CoV RBD, thereby blocking the binding of MERS-CoV to DPP4, as well as MERS-CoV entry into host cells. It is worth noting that the RBD on the MERS-CoV S trimer frequently undergoes conformational changes, switching between a lying down, receptor-inaccessible conformation and a standing-up, receptoraccessible conformation. Hence, in the context of the virus particles where the RBD is part of the S protein, the Nbs would need to bind the RBD when the RBD is in the standing-up conformation (45) . Importantly, the Nbs demonstrate strong crossneutralizing activities against various MERS-CoV strains isolated from different hosts (humans and camels) and from different time points during MERS-CoV circulation in humans (from years 2012 to 2015). NbMS10 had a relatively high ND 50 against the AGV08584/2012 strain containing a V534A mutation, which is consistent with the slightly reduced binding affinity between NbMS10 and MERS-CoV RBD containing the V534A mutation (Fig. 4A) . The broad neutralizing spectrum of the Nbs results from the binding site of the Nbs on MERS-CoV RBD, which is located in the Asp539containing region that plays a critical role in DPP4 binding. Interestingly, several MERS-CoV RBD-specific conventional IgGs also bind to the same epitope (39, 46) , suggesting that this region is a hot spot for immune recognition. Although mutations in this region can eliminate the binding of the Nbs to MERS-CoV RBD and hence lead to viral immune evasion, they also reduce the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to receptor DPP4 and hence decrease the efficiency of viral entry. Thus, viral immune evasion from the inhibition of the Nbs through mutations can be costly to MERS-CoV itself. Indeed, residue Asp539 in S protein RBD is highly conserved in almost all of the natural MERS-CoV strains published to date (Fig. 8) . Therefore, the MERS-CoV-specific Nbs can potentially be developed into broad-spectrum anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents. Despite the above analysis, this study did not examine all possible mutations in the Nb-binding region (since the atomic structures of MERS-CoV RBD complexed with the Nbs are still unknown), and thus it is possible that future escape mutations may occur to residues that this study did not cover. In that case, a combination of the current Nbs and other antibodies targeting other S regions or various RBD epitopes may be helpful in battling the emergence of immune escape MERS-CoV strains.",

            "text": "In sum, the MERS-CoV-specific Nbs developed in the present study possess superior qualities common to all Nbs such as their small size and cost-effective production. They also overcome potential limitations of other Nbs by maintaining a high binding affinity for their target MERS-CoV RBD and an optimized half-life. Moreover, they recognize a functionally important region on MERS-CoV RBD, rendering viral immune evasion costly and at the same time making themselves good candidates as broad-spectrum anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics. We have confirmed the effectiveness of the Nbs by showing that the Fc-fused Nb completely protected animal models from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. Thus, the Nbs can potentially be used in both humans and camels to prevent and treat MERS-CoV infections in either of these hosts and also block the camel-tohuman transmission of MERS-CoV. Overall, our study proves the feasibility of developing highly effective Nbs as anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic agents and points out strategies to preserve the advantages of Nbs, as well as to overcome the potential limitations of Nbs. Construction of VHH library and screening for MERS-CoV-RBD-specific Nbs. Construction of the Nb (i.e., VHH) library and screening of MERS-CoV-RBD-specific Nbs were performed as previously described (47) . Briefly, male and female alpacas (llama pacos, 1 year) were subcutaneously immunized with recombinant RBD-Fc (260 g/alpaca) (48) plus Freund complete adjuvant, and boosted three times with the same immunogen plus Freund incomplete adjuvant (InvivoGen). Blood was collected 10 days after the last immunization, and then PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare). Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using a TransScript cDNA Synthesis SuperMix (TransGen Biotech, China), followed by PCR amplification of the N-terminal IgG heavy-chain fragment (\u03f3700 bp), using the forward primer VHH-L-F (5=-GGTGGTCCTGGCTGC-3=) and the reverse primer CH2-R (5=-GGTACGTGCTGTTGAACT GTTCC-3=). The VHH gene (\u03f3300 to 450 bp) was further amplified using the above DNA fragment as the template and the forward primer VHH-FR1-D-F (5=-TTTCTATTACTAGGCCCAGCCGGCCGAGTCTGGAGGRR GCTTGGTGCA-3=) and the reverse primer VHH-FR4-D-R (5=-AAACCGTTGGCCATAATGGCCTGAGGAGACGR TGACSTSGGTC-3=) (the SfiI restriction site is underlined). The SfiI-digested VHH DNA fragment was then inserted into phagemid vector pCANTAB5e (Bio-View Shine Biotechnology, China) to construct the VHH phage display library (49) . Phage particles were analyzed by ELISA using recombinant MERS-CoV RBD-Fc and Fc of human IgG1 proteins as the positive and negative target proteins, respectively, to screen for RBD-specific Nbs. After four rounds of bio-panning, one of five positive clones, CAb10, with the highest binding to MERS-CoV RBD, was selected for further analyses (Fig. 1) .",

Sera were collected at different time points (30 min, 2 h, 6 h, 1 day, 5 days, and 10 days postinjection). The concentrations of Nbs in the sera were detected by ELISA, as described above. Briefly, MERS-CoV S1-His protein (2 g/ml) was used to coat ELISA plates, and then sera, goat anti-llama antibodies (1:5,000), and HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibodies (1:3,000) were sequentially added for ELISA reactions.",

Briefly, male and female mice (8 to 10 weeks old) were intraperitoneally anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (5 mg/kg of body weight) before being intranasally inoculated with lethal dose of MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain, 10 5.3 TCID 50 ) in 20 l of Dulbecco modified Eagle medium. Either 3 days preinfection or 1 or 3 days postinfection, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with NbMS10-Fc (10 mg/kg). Trastuzumab MAb was used as a control to the Nb. The infected mice were observed daily for 14 days, and their body weights and survivals were recorded.",

To compare the binding of Nbs to MERS-CoV S1 or RBD protein, as well as the RBDs with or without D539A mutation to hDPP4 receptor, a two-tailed Student t test was used. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the inhibition of Nbs to RBD-hDPP4 binding. Statistical significance between survival curves was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with a log-rank test. P values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
