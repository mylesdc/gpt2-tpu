            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a coronavirus that causes severe diarrhea in suckling piglets. TGEV primarily targets and infects porcine intestinal epithelial cells, which play an important role in nutrient absorption. However, the effects of TGEV infection on nutrient absorption in swine have not yet been investigated. In this study, we evaluated the impact of TGEV infection on arginine uptake using the porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line IPEC-J2 as a model system. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses showed that TGEV infection leads to reduced arginine uptake at 48 hours post-infection (hpi). Expression of cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT-1) was attenuated as well. TGEV infection induced activation of phospho-protein kinase C \u03b1 (p-PKC \u03b1), phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR), and enhanced the expression of caveolin-1, all of which appear to be involved in down-regulating arginine uptake and CAT-1 expression. These results illuminate the relationship between TGEV infection and nutrient absorption, and further our understanding of the mechanisms of TGEV infection. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.

HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 \u03bcg of specific expression plasmid per 10 6 cells using the X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche, Switzerland), diluted in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) in T-25 cell culture flasks. Lentiviral particles (MOI = 1) were subsequently added to IPEC-J2 cells and gently mixed. Arginine detection in cell culture medium using HPLC [31] To measure arginine uptake by IPEC-J2 cells, 100 \u03bcL of medium was deproteinated with 200 \u03bcL of trichloroacetate using HPLC. The medium was vortexed and centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. Supernatant was recovered using a pipette and purified by passage through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter. The derivatization procedure was a modification of the method described by Elkin et al. [32] . Next 50 \u03bcL of the derivatizing reagent acetonitrile-TEA-PITC (8:1:1:1 [v/v]) was added, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. A mixture of ddH 2 O-Hexane (1 mL and 0.5 mL) was added and incubated for 10 min. Finally the solvents were removed under a nitrogen stream, and the tube was sealed and stored at 4 \u00b0C pending analysis. Chromatography was carried out using a gradient elution at a constant temperature of 40 \u00b0C. Eluant A was an aqueous buffer prepared by adding 0.1 mol/L sodium acetate solution; Eluant B was acetonitrile. The gradient program is shown in Table 2 . Arginine uptake was calculated as follows: arginine uptake (mg/L per 10 6 cells) = (arginine concentration of the control group \u2212 arginine concentration of the experimental group)/cell number.",

PKC \u03b1 activity is controlled by phosphorylation, and activation of PKC \u03b1 leads to down-regulation of CAT-1 at the cell surface [37] . Treatment with PMA, a PKC stimulant, decreased the uptake of arginine and the expression of CAT-1. Consistent with results reported by Schwartz et al., the modulation of CAT-1 was associated with p-PKC \u03b1 [38] . We therefore conclude that p-PKC \u03b1 influences the transport activity of CAT-1.",

            "text": "EGFR belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family and is activated by many viruses [27, 39] . Activated EGFR triggers numerous downstream signaling pathways, including PKC-mediated cascades, and activates Ras, which affects various MAP kinases [40] . Hu et al. demonstrated that EGFR influences TGEV entry, and plays a synergistic role with APN early in TGEV infection. TGEV acts via the EGFR-PI3 K-Rac1/Cdc42-PAK-LIMK signaling pathway to regulate coflin activity and F-actin arrangement early in infection, and promotes TGEV entry [27] . Further research showed EGFR acts as a co-factor for TGEV entry, and TGEV S1 protein is able to bind to EGFR [28] . Moreover, EGFR is also involve in the regulation of glucose uptake during TGEV infection [41] . Our data provide evidence that EGFR regulates arginine uptake by functioning as a signal molecule in an EGFR-PKC \u03b1-caveolin-1-CAT-1 signaling pathway in TGEV-infected cells ( Figure 6B ). Our model includes a previously unreported signaling pathway that links EGFR with CAT-1. However, it is not yet known how EGFR passes a signal to CAT-1, or if other as yet unidentified signaling molecules regulate CAT-1.",
