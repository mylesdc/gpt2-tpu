Despite the low effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, influenza vaccination is recommended for all individuals aged \u2265 6 months. (2) Antiviral medications, especially oseltamivir, are used as adjunctive measures to vaccination in the control of influenza. (1) The physician should consider that influenza activity is widespread; this diagnosis should always be considered in all cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome. (8) (9) (10) In the present case, the identification of the influenza A virus was made via molecular biology testing of the nasopharynx aspirate, emphasizing that our laboratory identified the presence of influenza A, excluding the presence of influenza virus H1N1. However, subtyping of the H3N2 virus was not performed. According to epidemiological data from the Department of Health of Rio Grande do Sul (11) and the Ministry of Health of Brazil, (12) the virus with the largest circulation in 2015 was influenza A H2N3. Thus, the viral identification of the reported case most likely corresponds to influenza A H3N2, which explains the disease despite adequate patient vaccination coverage.",

            "text": "Evidence for treating severe influenza is limited; therefore, recommendations on route of administration, dosage and time of use follow the general guidelines. The administration of oseltamivir via the nasogastric or nasoenteric route seems to guarantee adequate systemic absorption in the majority of cases of severe influenza. The standard oseltamivir regimen at a dose of 75mg every 12 hours is recommended. However, although there is no definitive evidence, there are recommendations, in which, depending on clinical judgment, treatment time may be prolonged in severe cases and doses may also be doubled (150mg every 12 hours). In the present case, the treatment was initiated early orally at admission and was subsequently maintained by nasoenteric route, but at usual doses and time. (8) Renal involvement in individuals infected with influenza A is uncommon. Acute renal failure has been most commonly reported in critically ill patients with H1N1. (13) Reports of renal failure in cases of influenza A non-H1N1 are rare. The pathogenic mechanisms for the development of renal injury in influenza A virus infection are not fully understood. Potential causes are rhabdomyolysis, direct renal damage by virus, sepsisrelated renal hypoperfusion and disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome. Among them, rhabdomyolysis has been the most frequently reported cause. (14) In the reported case, there was no evidence of rhabdomyolysis (absence of myalgias, urine was not dark, there was no hematuria on the reactant tape and creatine phosphokinase was normal). The most likely mechanism for renal injury was sepsis and renal hypoperfusion.",
