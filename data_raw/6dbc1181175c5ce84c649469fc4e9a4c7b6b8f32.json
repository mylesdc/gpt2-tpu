The desire to control infection in hospitals and at the same time to reduce their carbon footprint motivates the use of unconventional solutions for building design and associated control measures. This paper considers indoor sources and types of infectious aerosols, and pathogen viability and infectivity behaviors in response to environmental conditions. Aerosol dispersion, heat and mass transfer, deposition in the respiratory tract, and infection mechanisms are discussed, with an emphasis on experimental and modeling approaches. Key building design parameters are described that include types of ventilation systems (mixing, displacement, natural and hybrid), air exchange rate, temperature and relative humidity, air flow distribution structure, occupancy, engineered disinfection of air (filtration and UV radiation), and architectural programming (source and activity management) for health care facilities. The paper describes major findings and suggests future research needs in methods for ventilation design of health care facilities to prevent airborne infection risk.",

A direct contact infection could be caused by caregivers not washing hands prior to attending patients [6] . Another common direct contact transmission is due to large infectious aerosols that travel a short distance from the source to the receptor. An important mode of indirect contact is airborne transmission occurring via the spread of fine aerosols, skin flakes, and fungal spores in room air over long distances and time scales. Aerosols can be generated and released by human expiratory actions (speech, coughing, and sneezing), skin shedding, or resuspension from surfaces [7] .",

For airborne transmission, this can mean reducing the generation of pathogens from an infectious person, using disinfection techniques to kill pathogens released to the air, or simply isolating infectious people in special rooms. Controls generally fall into three categories: administrative, personal protection, and environmental and engineering. Administrative controls aim to keep infectious people away from vulnerable people (infection detection, triage, communication, and education) and ensure that technical controls (e.g., engineering and personal protection) are used correctly. For the airborne transmission pathway, personal protection consists of some form of mask or respirator to prevent either the distribution or inhalation of pathogens [5] . Engineering and environmental controls primarily intervene after pathogens leave the breathing zone from one person before they enter the breathing zone of another.",

This would normally decrease pathogen concentrations, which would be expected to reduce infections. However, rooms are not wellmixed, people do not breath in all parts of the room, and pathogen infectivity changes with time and environmental conditions. Furthermore, increased ventilation is not free, because it normally requires larger and more energy intensive equipment. How much should ventilation rates be increased? Which type of system is most helpful in reducing airborne infections? These questions cannot be answered without quantitative estimates of infection risk or at least the relative risk of one engineering system compared to another. Such risk models must include every process during infection from source to receptor. As a result, the entire infection pathway must be considered. Figure 1 shows the airborne infection pathway and the environmental and engineering controls that may influence the steps along the path. In Section 2, we review each step of the infection pathway. As will be indicated therein, each step has been the subject of earlier reviews, but our focus is on factors that can influence the relative risks of different ventilation systems. In Section 3, we discuss the engineering controls that can influence the infection steps. Also discussed are the relative merits of different ventilation systems (with a focus on health care facilities) and whether or not the models of Section 2 may be applied for risk estimation. Section 4 concludes with a discussion of the challenges remaining for methods that can be used for health care facility ventilation design.",

This intermediate behavior depends on particular geometrical settings, airflow patterns in ventilation, and also aerosol response to the surrounding environment [1, 10] .",

They used an OPC and an analytical transmission electron microscope (ATEM). The OPC indicated that the majority of droplets were under 1 \u03bcm. ATEM measurements were conducted by collecting droplets on slides and viewing their size under microscope after evaporation. The original droplet size was corrected with a calculation. They confirmed the existence of larger droplets in exhaled breath as opposed to nose breathing. Yang et al. [17] studied the size distribution of droplets experimentally using the aerodynamic particle spectrometer (APS) and the scanning mobility particle spectrometer (SMPS). Their samples were bagged before analysis; hence, significant evaporation and droplet settling may have occurred. An experimental study by Chao et al.

The peak flow rate in a cough may reach as high as 12 L/s. Piiril\u00e4 and Sovijarvi [21] performed an objective assessment of coughing. They investigated the cough as a primitive reflex typically consisting of an initiating deep inspiration, glottal closure, and an explosive expiration accompanied by a sound. The flow characteristics of a cough were reported to vary from person to person. They reported that the durations of the different phases of the cough reflex can be easily measured on a graph of flow versus time. They suggested that the duration of the glottal closure during the compressive phase of cough varies in the range of 0.09-1.01 s. They also defined a useful parameter in characterizing the cough, the cough peak expiratory flow rate (CPEF). Nishino [22] explains the physiology of coughing and sneezing in detail and points out the similarities and differences between the two. The flow dynamics of a sneeze are similar to the cough in time variation of flow rate. However, the peak velocities are higher, and in addition to mouth exhalation, a small fraction of the exhalation exits the nose. For sneezes, Jennison [13] reported exit velocities as high as 90 m/s with peak velocity time (PVT) of 57 ms. The total sneeze time was reported in the range of 0.07-0.20 s. Zhu et al. [23] performed particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of cough droplet dispersion in a calm background. Experimentally, they found that the initial velocity of coughs varies in the range of 6-22 m/s and the amount of saliva injected is in the range of 6.1-7.7 mg. Chao et al. [18] reported an average expiration air velocity of 11.7 m/s for coughing and 3.9 m/s for speaking.",

In general, small droplets (<20 \u03bcm) evaporate at much faster time scales (milliseconds) than larger droplets (>50 \u03bcm) for which the evaporation time is in the order of seconds. The most important factors in evaporation rate are temperature and relative humidity in the ambient air.",

Depending on the room geometry, transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurs at Re \u223c O(10 3 ), and buoyancy-driven flows (e.g., thermal plumes) become important for Gr/Re 2 > O (10) . The process of airborne infection in a room involves widely differing scales. For example, the flow in the vicinity of a sneeze is highly turbulent and not strongly influenced by gravity or buoyancy. In contrast, over longer times (minutes) and larger length scales (full room), the turbulence intensity is less and the influence of gravity or buoyancy may be larger. The heat and mass transfer to an expiratory droplet is determined by flow conditions in the immediate distance (1-100 \u03bcm) around the droplet, which is always laminar due to the small relevant length scales and the small aerosol-air relative velocity.",

The basic motivation behind this idea is that large eddies are the primary mechanisms transporting aerosols over large distances. This reduces the computation cost substantially, but it still poses challenges for modeling ventilation airflow: (i) the required computation cost is still high, (ii) many realizations of the airflow are necessary for statistically significant results, and (iii) original perturbation fields for the flow are not known or are difficult to generate [29] . A less computationally costly approach in modeling turbulence is Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) modeling. This approach does not resolve any real-time scales of the flow but instead considers time-averaged and fluctuating components of the flow separately. These models report time-averaged parameters of turbulence such as kinetic energy and dissipation rate. Many variations of RANS models are available (k \u2212 , k \u2212 \u03c9, v 2 f , Reynolds stress model (RSM), etc.). Many researchers have used the standard or realizable k\u2212 turbulence model in solving ventilation airflow [30] [31] [32] . Other researchers have predicted ventilation airflow using renormalization group (RNG) k\u2212 turbulence model. Compared to the standard and realizable k \u2212 models, the RNG model has a better ability to model both high and low Re or Gr numbers in the same flow [29, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . Most RANS models are computationally economic and provide useful results, particularly when qualitative results are sought. However, they do not consider the anisotropy of the turbulence and often have difficulty to reach a converged solution. One remedy is to use the Reynolds stress model (RSM) that allows for anisotropy of turbulence and provides better results than other RANS models if the initial solution is guessed properly.",

This visual plaque allows for titer calculation of the pathogen in plaque-forming units (PFUs) per unit space. Sometimes, living cells are dyed such that the color contrast between the plaque and living cells are pronounced [52] [53] [54] . Plaque assay methods reveal information about the ability of the pathogen to attach and infect living cells under favorable conditions. However, it is very difficult to extrapolate true infectivity of a pathogen for the host due to the variability of host factors already listed. Table 3 provides a summary of viability and infectivity measurement techniques for airborne pathogens. The true viability and infectivity of airborne pathogens depend on complex physical and biological mechanisms that affect the survival of pathogens while suspended in air, their deposition onto susceptible sites in the host, and their ability to defeat the defense mechanisms of the host. None of the existing measurement techniques accurately accounts for all of these mechanisms. As a result, it must be understood that any measurement technique, at best, approximates true viability and infectivity focusing on only limited aspects of viability or infectivity. For example, if molecular methods are used, accurate counts of pathogens are possible, but the estimates for their reproducibility and true interaction with the host are compromised. On the other hand, if plaque assay methods are used, some degree of pathogen interaction with the host is accounted for, while an accurate count of pathogens is compromised. Hence, the validity for prediction of airborne infection risk in a given building ventilation setting is limited to the type of viability and infectivity measurement technique used.",

In classical treatments, chemical reactions are assumed to proceed continuously, whereas close examination suggests this is only an approximation, because at the molecular level, individual reactions are not continuous events. The continuum approximation becomes more accurate as the number of molecules becomes large. Loss of viability in a small aerosol has a discontinuous nature, since only a small quantity of microbes are concerned. A microbe is either alive or dead, and the sudden change between these two states is termed catastrophe [57] . The mathematical model of catastrophe theory involves describing the potential energy of the system in terms of control parameters. For some range of values for the control parameters, the potential energy curve has a stable equilibrium, which represents the viable state. If the control parameters are changed, there may result a catastrophic drop in potential energy, which leads to the inactivated or nonequilibrium state [57] .",

In deterministic models, each individual is hypothesized to have an inherent tolerance dose for an infectious agent. When he or she intakes a dose higher than this tolerance, infection occurs. Otherwise, it does not. On the other hand, stochastic models do not determine whether an individual will fall sick under certain dosage conditions. Instead, the model estimates a probability of acquiring the infection under the intake dosage [62, 63] . The distinction between stochastic and deterministic models is more philosophical than practical, because even if an underlying infection process is deterministic, there are always a host of unresolved parameters (ranging from genetic variations of host and pathogen to the turbulent transport from source to receptor) such that all practical models reduce to a probabilistic calculation.",

As it is a time consuming computation to determine exposure levels for every expiratory action (like a cough or a sneeze) and in all locations, one can compute the exposure level for one expiratory action and then multiply the exposure level by the number of expirations during the exposure time interval. By this approach, a stochastic and nonthreshold dose-response model for the airborne infection risk can be formed",

            "text": "Some studies in the literature model airborne infection risk for a population of individuals, as opposed to a single suspect [65, 67, 68] . Such models are termed population or epidemic infection models and simulate dynamics in a total population (N) that consists of the susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) subpopulations [3, 65] . The relationships among these subpopulations are expressed using a series of differential equations that relate physical and biological parameters. The model complexities depend on the number of parameters considered. Various researchers have considered aerosol size, probability of infection by an inhaled pathogen, physical removal of airborne pathogens, infection recovery rate, inactivation rate of airborne pathogens, airborne pathogen generation rate, and many more parameters [3, 4, 65, 67, 68] . For example, the work of Noakes et al. [3] has integrated the Wells-Riley model into a population infection model. Noakes and Sleigh [4] have also developed a population model that finds infection rate for a multizone health care facility. Although these models extend airborne infection risk prediction to a population, they do not resolve infection risk spatially, since they assume well-mixed distribution for airborne pathogens. Inclusion of spatial resolution will result in many mathematical complexities for such models. On the other hand, the Wells-Riley (1) and dose-response models (e.g., (5), (6) , and (7)) predict the infection probability for a single suspect, but they can resolve spatial and temporal components of risk (e.g., (8) and (9)) and hence suffice to guide ventilation design.",

Positive pressure mechanical ventilation systems are fanned on intake and result in exfiltration of space (i.e., air tends to leak out of ventilated space). On the other hand, negative pressure mechanical ventilation systems are fanned on exhaust and result in infiltration of space [5, 69] . Natural ventilation systems rely on natural forces such as wind or a density-generated pressure differences between indoor and outdoor to drive air through building openings. Some purpose-built openings include doors, windows, solar chimneys, and wind towers [5, 69] . Advanced natural ventilation systems with passive cooling or heating have also been developed. In these systems, outdoor air is supplied via stacks fed from below-ground concrete plena providing passive cooling or heating. Air leaves the space through stacks. In Table 7 : Summary of advantages and disadvantages of different types of ventilation systems for hospitals [5] . [69] . Hybrid (mixed-mode) ventilation systems rely on natural driving forces when sufficient and use mechanical ventilation for augmentation as necessary. Usually, exhaust fans are used to assist natural ventilation in a negative pressure arrangement [5] . In some systems, passive down-draught cooling (PDC) encourages air to fall through chilled water pipes at a high level during hot weather. During cool weather some systems use exhaust flows to warm the incoming air. Usually, sensors and control technologies are required for optimum performance of hybrid systems [69] . Table 7 shows major advantages and disadvantages associated with the ventilation systems described above [5] .",

The cool air drops due to negative buoyancy and reaches the floor if air mixing is avoided. This ventilation scheme, if it could be properly designed and operated, would be ideal for removing large droplets [10, 36] .

The volatile fraction of the surrogate fluid was 0.94 that was representative of oral fluid. In their simulations, they used droplets of various size bins in the range of 1.5-1500 \u03bcm with a mode of 12 \u03bcm. For a perfectly mixed system, the decay of aerosols due to removal in a ventilation system is exponential. They found, however, that decay rate is faster in reality due to deposition of droplets and the fact that most mechanical ventilation systems operate in conditions between perfectly mixed and perfectly displaced ventilation. Two distinctive behaviors were observed: small size group aerosols (<45 \u03bcm) exhibited airborne transmittable behavior, while large size group aerosols (>87.5 \u03bcm) settled quickly with gravitational force.

As a result, there is renewed interest in prevention of airborne disease transmission in health care facilities. Research has led to the development of useful methods for the prediction of various aspects of airborne disease transmission. Physical modeling of, and experiments on, aerosol transport have revealed mechanisms for dispersion, heat, and mass transfer of aerosols in different size regimes from submicrometer to millimeter. Many detailed infection models such as Wells-Riley model (1) and dose-response model (e.g., (5) to (9)) have been suggested for prediction of the spread of airborne disease in health care facilities. The current state of research has also shown that important sources for airborne pathogens including human activity (expiratory, resuspension, and shedding) and building microbial ecology (indoor environment and HVAC components). The viability and infectivity response of various airborne pathogens to environmental conditions, such as temperature and relative humidity, have also been understood and quantified in considerable depth. For example, animal tests, culture methods, molecular methods, and plaque assay methods have been used to measure pathogen viability and infectivity decay rates for many different classes of microbes although all these techniques suffer from substantial shortcomings. The effect of different ventilation strategies (mixing, displacement, and natural) on air exchange rates and the spread of aerosols has also been studied. For example, mixing type ventilation can achieve sufficient dilution of contaminated air to reduce the infection rate. A displacement ventilation strategy, if implemented successfully, helps segregate contaminated from noncontaminated air, thus reducing the infection risk. Under ideal conditions, natural ventilation has been shown to exhibit very high air exchange rates (and thus dilution) that reduce the airborne infection risk. In addition, various building codes have implemented preventive measures to reduce the airborne infection risk. For example, high efficiency filtration and high air exchange rates are mandated for critical care units (surgery and protective environment rooms), and exhaust outlets are recommended to be installed close to contaminant sources.",

The direct pathway for infection (e.g., shaking hands, close contact, etc.) does not require a fluid carrier phase (air) to transport pathogens from the source to the receptor over several minutes, and hence, ventilation design has no effect in its mitigation. If the direct contact mode for infection is primary for a certain disease, increasing the air exchange rate will achieve nothing but added energy cost to a building. The airborne infection pathway is considered to be important for some pathogens such as Tuberculosis and influenza. However, there is still uncertainty about the relative importance of different infection pathways for many other diseases. The reason for the uncertainty is the lack of data analysis in actual outbreaks and ethical concerns about running relevant experiments.

Occupancy affects the airflow distribution structure, and therefore, the airborne infection risk significantly. The occupational density of people, and also their location in a room relative to the room's interior decoration, diffuser, and exhaust can either reduce or increase airborne infection risk. People introduce thermal plumes in the ventilation space, and, in general, if thermal plumes in a room increase flow circulation and mixing, it will increase the airborne infection risk. In addition, the motion of people, and associated functions such as opening doors or windows, alters the ventilation flow pattern in a room. Such effects must carefully be considered and modeled to arrive at occupation-specific recommendations in building code.",

Aerosol transport is particularly affected by larger eddies, a feature of the ventilation flow that RANS models cannot predict accurately.

As far as the building code is concerned, the recommendations for temperature and relative humidity in functional spaces of health care facilities are very conservative.

For example, UV radiation targets genomes in pathogens, while pathogens adapt to the environment by genetic mutation, a phenomenon that is less understood.

The airborne infection involves deposition of aerosolized pathogens on infection sites in a host and the ability to multiply and target specific cells until infection symptoms develop. Another difficulty is the lack of experimental data for infection. Most infection outbreaks in history provide limited information, making it difficult to fully analyze and arrive at the desired conclusions. Even empirical quanta estimations in wellmixed rooms using the Wells-Riley model (1) combine various complicated and interconnected factors. Such empirical data cannot be used in more detailed models of infection risk, where spatial distribution of risk, subject immunity variation, and deposition mechanisms are to be resolved. As a result, many such models become probabilistic with simplifying assumptions (e.g., single hit model) to quantify risk. Any experimental infection test is valid only for the particular setup of the experiment and is difficult to generalize to provide a universal infection dosage or mechanism. Future research should set a standard procedure to establish a minimum infection dosage. Even if there are compromises to be made (e.g., minimum dose for animal infections), there are useful merits to such a standardization.",

Current successful models are stochastic in nature (e.g., (5) to (9)) but can still provide useful guidelines for ventilation design, especially when airflow distribution structure is to be accounted for.
