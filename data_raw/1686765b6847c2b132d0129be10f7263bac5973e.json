            "text": "Avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) are frequently isolated from domestic and wild birds throughout the world and are separated into nine serotypes (APMV-1 to -9). Only in the case of APMV-1, the infection of non-avian species has been investigated. The APMVs presently are being considered as human vaccine vectors. In this study, we evaluated the replication and pathogenicity of all nine APMV serotypes in hamsters. The hamsters were inoculated intranasally with each virus and monitored for clinical disease, pathology, histopathology, virus replication, and seroconversion. On the basis of one or more of these criteria, each of the APMV serotypes was found to replicate in hamsters. The APMVs produced mild or inapparent clinical signs in hamsters except for APMV-9, which produced moderate disease. Gross lesions were observed over the pulmonary surface of hamsters infected with APMV-2 & -3, which showed petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages, respectively. Replication of all of the APMVs except APMV-5 was confirmed in the nasal turbinates and lungs, indicating a tropism for the respiratory tract. Histologically, the infection resulted in lung lesions consistent with bronchointerstitial pneumonia of varying severity and nasal turbinates with blunting or loss of cilia of the epithelium lining the nasal septa. The majority of APMV-infected hamsters exhibited transient histological lesions that self resolved by 14 days post infection (dpi). All of the hamsters infected with the APMVs produced serotype-specific HI or neutralizing antibodies, confirming virus replication. Taken together, these results demonstrate that all nine known APMV serotypes are capable of replicating in hamsters with minimal disease and pathology.",

            "text": "Paramyxoviridae is a large and diverse family whose members have been isolated from many species of avian, terrestrial, and aquatic animal species around the world [1] . Paramyxoviruses are pleomorphic, enveloped, cytoplasmic viruses that have a non-segmented, negative-sense RNA genome. The family is divided into two subfamilies, Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae, based on their structure, genome organization, and sequence relatedness [2] . The subfamily Paramyxovirinae contains five genera: Respirovirus, Rubulavirus, Morbillivirus, Henipavirus, and Avulavirus, while the subfamily Pneumovirinae contains two genera, Pneumovirus and Metapneumovirus [3] . All paramyxoviruses that have been isolated to date from avian species can be segregated into two genera based on the taxonomic criteria mentioned above: genus Avulavirus, whose members are called the avian paramyxoviruses (APMV), and genus Metapneumovirus, whose members are called avian metapneumoviruses. The APMV of genus Avulavirus are separated into nine serotypes (APMV-1 through -9) based on Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) and Neuraminidase Inhibition (NI) assays [4] . Various strains of APMV-1, which is also called Newcastle disease virus (NDV), have been analyzed in detail by biochemical analysis, genome sequencing, and pathogenesis studies, and important molecular determinants of virulence have been identified [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . As a first step in characterizing the other APMV serotypes, complete genome sequences of one or more representative strains of APMV serotypes 2 to 9 were recently determined, expanding our knowledge about these viruses [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

            "text": "APMV-1 comprises all strains of NDV and is the best characterized serotype because of the severity of disease caused by virulent NDV strains in chickens. NDV strains vary greatly in their pathogenicity to chickens and are grouped into three pathotypes: highly virulent (velogenic) strains, which cause severe respiratory and neurological disease in chickens; moderately virulent (mesogenic) strains, which cause mild disease; and nonpathogenic (lentogenic) strains, which cause inapparent infections. In contrast, very little is known about the comparative disease potential of APMV-2 to APMV-9 in domestic and wild birds. APMV-2 strains have been isolated from chickens, turkeys and wild birds across the globe [4, [19] [20] [21] [22] . APMV-2 infections in turkeys have been found to cause mild respiratory disease, decreases in egg production, and infertility [23, 24] . APMV-3 strains have been isolated from wild and domestic birds [25] . APMV-3 infections have been associated with encephalitis and high mortality in caged birds [26] [27] [28] . APMV-4 strains have been isolated from chickens, ducks and geese [29] . Experimental infection of chickens with APMV-4 resulted in mild interstitial pneumonia and catarrhal tracheitis [30] . APMV-5 strains have only been isolated from budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) and cause depression, dyspnoea, diarrhea, torticollis, and acute fatal enteritis in immature budgerigars, leading to very high mortality [31] . APMV-6 was first isolated from a domestic duck and was found to cause mild respiratory disease and drop in egg production in turkeys, but was avirulent in chickens [10, 30, 32] . APMV-7 was first isolated from a hunter-killed dove and has also been isolated from a natural outbreak of respiratory disease in turkeys. APMV-7 infection in turkeys caused respiratory disease, mild multifocal nodular lymphocytic airsacculitis, and decreased egg production [33] . APMV-8 was isolated from a goose and a feral pintail duck [34, 35] . APMV-9 strains have been isolated from ducks around the world [36, 37] . APMV types -2, -3, and -7 have been associated with mild respiratory disease and egg production problems in domestic chickens [33] . There are no reports of isolation of APMV-5, -8 and -9 from poultry [32] . But recent serosurveillance of commercial poultry farms in USA indicated the possible prevalence of all APMV serotypes excluding APMV-5 in chickens [38] .",

APMV-1 infections in non-avian species are usually asymptomatic or mild. Clinical signs in human infections commonly involve conjunctivitis, which usually is transient and self-limiting. Presently, APMV-1 is being evaluated as a vaccine vector against human pathogens [45] . When administered to the respiratory tract of non-human primates, NDV is highly restricted in replication, but foreign antigens expressed by recombinant NDV vectors are moderately to highly immunogenic. One of the major advantages of this approach is that most humans do not have pre-existing immunity to APMV-1. Pre-existing immunity is a potential drawback to using vectors derived from common human pathogens, and also can be a concern for any vector if two or more doses are necessary to elicit protective immunity. Therefore, we are investigating APMV types 2 to 9, which are antigenically distinct from APMV-1, as alternative human vaccine vectors. Also, some of these additional APMV types likely will have differences in replication, attenuation, and immunogenicity compared to APMV-1 that may be advantageous. However, the replication and pathogenicity of APMV-2 to -9 in non-avian species has not been studied. As a first step, we have evaluated the replication and pathogenicity of APMV-2 to -9 in hamsters. In this study, groups of hamsters were infected with a prototype strain of each APMV serotype by the intranasal route and monitored for virus replication, clinical symptoms, histopathology, and seroconversion. Our results showed that each of the APMV serotypes replicated in hamsters without causing adverse clinical signs of illness, although histopathologic evidence of disease was observed in some cases, and also induced high neutralizing antibody titers.",

Similar results have been obtained from chickens infected with APMV-2, -3 and -4, where no virus could be isolated at 14 dpi [30] . Using IHC, viral N antigen was detected in the same tissues that were positive by virus isolation. An interesting finding was the presence of large amounts of viral antigens at the epithelial cell linings, suggesting that these cells are highly permissive to APMV replication. In addition, the detection of viral antigens, and in most cases infectious virus, in nasal turbinates and lungs of the hamsters indicate that APMV replication is mostly restricted to the respiratory tract.

But chicken antiserum against NDV cross-reacts in HI tests with several of the other APMV serotypes, thus questioning the specificity of HI test in field cases [55] . Warke et al. [38] indicated that the HI test lacks sensitivity for detecting infection with these APMV serotypes. They also observed that even in the case of a high infectious dose and observed microscopic changes in the infected organs, high HI titers were not observed in the infected birds. On the contrary in our study, most of the APMV serotypes replicated well in hamsters, producing mild respiratory pathology and high neutralizing antibody titers. Our results indicated that the antibody developed in hamsters against these serotypes were very specific and no cross reaction was observed between serotypes except between APMV-1 and -9. Cross-reactivity between these two serotypes is not completely unanticipated, since they share the highest level of genome nucleotide sequence identity (58%) among the APMV serotypes [12] .

            "text": "The replication of APMVs in hamsters produced mild rhinitis and mild pathology that was mainly restricted to the respiratory tract. There was a concern that APMVs may also replicate in the intestine and shed in feces, which might act as a source of infection for the other animals. But our results indicated that none of the APMVs replicate in the intestinal epithelial cells of hamsters. Importantly, our results also suggest that these viruses do not cross the blood-brain barrier and do not induce neurological symptoms. Also, our previous experimental studies of all the APMVs in chickens showed that they were avirulent. Taken together, these results show that the APMVs replicate moderately in hamsters and produce either mild or no clinical signs, and elicit substantial antibody responses. Therefore, it is possible that APMVs might replicate in other mammalian species including humans. In conclusion, this study is the first comparative report on the replication and pathogenicity of prototype strains of all 9 APMV serotypes in hamsters. Our results lay the foundation for a good laboratory animal model for testing the replication and pathogenicity of APMV strains. histopathological slides. PC and SKS, conceived the study, participated in its design and coordination. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.",
