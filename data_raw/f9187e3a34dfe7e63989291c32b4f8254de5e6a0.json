The key to better understanding the mechanisms that control this process is to identify the specific substrates that each protease targets. To address this, we have developed iProt-Sub, a powerful bioinformatics tool for the accurate prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites. Importantly, iProt-Sub represents a significantly advanced version of its successful predecessor, PROSPER. It provides optimized cleavage site prediction models with better prediction performance and coverage for more species-specific proteases (4 major protease families and 38 different proteases). iProt-Sub integrates heterogeneous Jiangning Song received his BEng and DEng degrees from Jiangnan University, China. He is affiliated with the Advisory Professor of several Universities. His research interests are in computational biology and biomedicine, protein structure prediction, low-frequency internal motion of protein/DNA molecules and its biological functions, diffusion-controlled reactions of enzymes, as well as graphic rules in enzyme kinetics and other biological systems. sequence and structural features and uses a two-step feature selection procedure to further remove redundant and irrelevant features in an effort to improve the cleavage site prediction accuracy. Features used by iProt-Sub are encoded by 11 different sequence encoding schemes, including local amino acid sequence profile, secondary structure, solvent accessibility and native disorder, which will allow a more accurate representation of the protease specificity of approximately 38 proteases and training of the prediction models. Benchmarking experiments using cross-validation and independent tests showed that iProt-Sub is able to achieve a better performance than several existing generic tools. We anticipate that iProt-Sub will be a powerful tool for proteome-wide prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites, and will facilitate hypothesis-driven functional interrogation of protease-specific substrate cleavage and proteolytic events.",

            "text": "Proteolytic cleavage is one of the few irreversible posttranslational modifications. It plays a key role in numerous developmental and physiological processes, including digestion, protein degradation, endocrine signaling and cell division [1] . This process is controlled by proteases (also known as peptidases or proteinases) that selectively cleave the peptide bonds between amino acids in specific protein or peptide substrates. Proteases have central roles in 'life or death' processes. Through the highly selective proteolytic processing, proteases can precisely regulate a myriad of biological processes across all living organisms [1] . In addition, these are also many other proteases involved in protein degradation rather than processing, for example cathepsin D and cathepsin B. Pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin also come into this category, even though they have a defined specificity because they degrade so many substrates, most of which are foreign to the body [2] . The malfunction or deregulation of proteases results in many pathological conditions [3] . For example, proteases are often associated with cancer invasion and metastasis because of their ability to degrade the extracellular matrix [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Intriguingly, proteases can function as part of an extensive network of proteolytic interactions through interacting with other important signaling pathways involving other protein substrates and enzymes, termed the 'protease web' [9] .",

The precise understanding of the biological function of a protease requires the identification of the complete repertoire of its natural substrates and corresponding substrate cleavage sites [10, 11] . The specificity of proteases can vary significantly, depending on the protease and the active sites, with the cleavage site selectivity ranging from preferences for limited and specific amino acids at specific positions, to more general preferences with little discrimination. Current experimental methods for proteolytic cleavage characterization include one-dimensional and two-dimensional gel-based methods (used for identifying the substrates) [12] , N-terminal peptide identification methods (for identifying both substrates and cleavage sites), methods using mass spectrometry, as well as quantitation methods of proteolysis to better understand the dynamics and extent of proteolytic events such as the TAILS method [13] . Despite the advances of these experimental methods, they are labor intensive, expensive and time-consuming, and are often limited to the investigation of one protease each time. In this context, it is highly desirable to develop cost-effective computational methods that can be used to identify the target substrates for a specific protease and to facilitate the characterization of substrate specificity and the function of proteases.",

            "text": "The importance and value of the in silico identification of protease target substrates and cleavage sites has led to the development of a variety of computational methods for predicting protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites. A number of computational studies have suggested that substrate cleavage sites (sites surrounding the cleavage P1 sites) targeted by proteases present unique structural and physicochemical properties that vary across different proteases, which can be exploited to predict potential cleavage sites [11, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, the most successful computational methods use a combination of these features with other complementary features [10, [14] [15] [16] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] , achieving overall accuracies of 70-90% for most of the proteases under investigation. A consensus resulting from such computational methods is that machine learning algorithms that take into consideration integrated heterogeneous information can be used to build more accurate predictive models for most of the proteases under investigation. Often a consensus scoring mechanism is performed using scoring function-based techniques or machine learning techniques. The former includes PeptideCutter [32] , PoPS [33] and SitePrediction [34] . The latter has gained significant interest in recent years and includes CASVM [35] , Cascleave [15] , Pripper [36] , Cascleave 2.0 [30] , PROSPER [29, 31] and PROSPERous [37] . For the substrate cleavage site prediction of specific proteases, some ad hoc consensus schemes can also be effective, including GraBCas [38] , CaSPredictor [39] and GPS-CCD [40] .",

It represented the first comprehensive server capable of predicting cleavage sites of multiple proteases within a single substrate sequence using machine learning techniques. To date, the PROSPER server has attracted >25 000 unique users worldwide and has processed >60 000 job submissions since its inception. Here, we build on this previous work to develop a new computational method, termed iProt-Sub to address the problem of identifying the most probable protease-specific substrates and their detailed cleavage sites from the substrate sequence information. According to the well-known Chou's fivestep rule [41] in developing a useful predictor, we need to accomplish the following: (1) benchmark data set construction, (2) protein sample formulation, (3) operating algorithm, (4) evaluating expected accuracy and (5) Web server establishment. In this work, we have considerably improved the design of iProt-Sub package for each of the five procedures.",

The cleavage site prediction models are trained and optimized to achieve best-performing prediction by performing a 5-fold cross-validation test. Benchmarking experiments indicated that the iProt-Sub method compared favorably with recently published methods. Moreover, mapping of the protease-specific cleavage target substrates at the proteomewide scale was highly accurate and selective. iProt-Sub is accessible through a user-friendly Web application available at http://iProt-Sub.erc.monash.edu/. The Web application of iProt-Sub features a powerful and convenient graphic interface that allows the visualization and analysis of the predicted cleavage site within the same protein by different proteases simultaneously. The implemented iProt-Sub server thus represents a centralized Web resource for accurate in silico prediction of protease-specific substrates and their cleavage sites.",

Importantly, the improvement of iProt-Sub over PROSPER is reflected by the following: (1) larger coverage of more proteases. iProt-Sub can be used to predict protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites for 38 different proteases, whereas PROSPER covered 23 proteases; (2) use of a wider range of sequencederived features. iProt-Sub uses 11 diverse types of sequencebased features (4562-dimensional); (3) application of a more effective feature selection technique to filter out irrelevant and noisy features. iProt-Sub uses the mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) [42] algorithm to identify more informative features to enhance the predictive performance: (4) improved predictive performance. Through an effective feature extraction, selection and model learning strategy, iProt-Sub consistently achieves improved predictive performance for predicting the substrate cleavage sites for all tested proteases and (5) completely redesigned interface. The new iProt-Sub Web server now provides a more user-friendly and interactive interface that enhances user experience. The overall flowchart of the iProt-Sub methodology is shown in Figure 1 .",

For this purpose, we used the MEROPS database [46] , which is a comprehensive information resource for proteases, their substrates and inhibitors. Only experimentally verified substrate sequences and cleavage sites were retrieved. The annotations of experimentally verified cleavage sites and the corresponding proteases that cleave the target substrates were extracted from MEROPS, while the annotations of protein identifiers of the substrates and their sequence information were extracted from UniProt [47] . In particular, exopeptidases (aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, etc.) and oligopeptidases were generally not included, which is consistent with our previous study [29] . As we are more interested in predicting cleavages within native proteins, peptidases that work at pH extremes and are likely to degrade only denatured proteins were also excluded [29] .",

This leads to a class imbalance problem. If not addressed, this can result in models that favor negative predictions over positive [29, 51] . To address this data imbalance issue, we used a down-sampling strategy, randomly discarding from the overrepresented negative samples, to impose a ratio of 1 positive to every 3 negatives, as previously suggested [15, 25, 29, 51, 52] .",

With regard to the selection of reliable negative samples, several previous studies have indicated that a few cleavage sites at the P1 position were predicted to be solvent inaccessible [14] [15] [16] .

Accordingly, the sequence-encoding scheme plays a crucial role in determining the predictive performance of the machine learning-based model. In this study, we derived a great variety of features organized into 11 different types. We evaluated the relative predictive performance to identify effective combinations of features that could lead to the overall best predictive performance for a given protease. In addition to sequence-derived features, we also integrated evolutionary, physicochemical properties and predicted structural features. Detailed information on the software or databases we used to extract these different types of features is listed in Table 2 , along with the feature category, annotations, dimension and references. Below we will first describe the different types of sequence encoding schemes in detail, and then describe the SVM learning algorithm that is used to train the prediction models to predict y given x.",

This is because all the existing machine learning algorithms can only handle vectors but not sequences, as elucidated in [65] . However, a vector defined in a discrete model may completely lose all the sequence-pattern information. To avoid this for proteins, the pseudo amino acid composition (AAC) [66] or PseAAC [67] was proposed. Ever since the concept of PseAAC was proposed, it has been widely used in nearly all the areas of computational proteomics (see, e.g., [68] [69] [70] as well as a long list of references cited in [71] ). According to the concept of general PseAAC [41] , a protein sequence can be formulated as:",

Second, the 'mRMR-FS' model achieved the overall best performance, after the two-step feature selection, compared with the other models for the MMP cleavage site prediction. For example, the 'mRMR-FS' model achieved an AUC of 0.968 for MMP-2 cleavage site prediction, while the second best 'ALL-Fea' model achieved an AUC of 0.892. Third, the accuracy of protease-specific cleavage site prediction varies substantially between different proteases and different protease families. The difficult cases include cleavage site prediction of the MMP family and other proteases (e.g. thrombin) whose activities are also regulated by confounding factors such as the presence of exosites (sites that are located outside the active sites) [120] [121] [122] . Compared with the caspases and granzyme B, the performance of cleavage site prediction with the MMP family achieved by a model using the same encoding scheme is much worse in terms of the AUC score. For example, the CKSAAP model only achieved an AUC of 0.502 and 0.581 for the cleavage site predictions of MMP-2 and MMP-3, respectively, compared with that of 0.914 and 0.922 for the cleavage site prediction of caspase-3 and caspase-7, respectively ( Figure 2 ). Future studies should investigate incorporation of other relevant features that might prove useful for improving the predictive performance of cleavage sites for proteases with a requirement for allosteric regulation to cleave their target substrates.",

            "text": "Indeed, the sequence logos in Figure 3 show that there exist conserved sequence motifs or distinctive sequence patterns surrounding protease-specific substrate cleavage sites that may potentially be used to differentiate between different proteases. Notably, it can be seen that a predominant characteristic of substrate cleavage sites of caspases (caspase-3, -6, -7 and -8) is the requirement of Asp residue at the P1 position [125] . For certain caspases (e.g. caspase-3 and -7), there is also a lesser selectivity for Asp residue at the P4 position, thereby constituting the canonical DXXD motif [125] . A commonality of the cleavage selectivity of granzyme B, compared with that of caspases, is that they primarily recognize and cleave after the Asp at the P1 position as well. On a closer look, we can see that there exist subtle differences in the substrate cleavage selectivity between granzyme B (human) and granzyme B (mouse) [126] . Apparently, granzyme B (mouse) has a more complicated preference favoring a number of residue types across different positions surrounding the cleavage sites, including Val, Pro and Gly at the P1 position; Ser at the However, different from caspases, matrix metallopeptidases (e.g. MMP-2 and MMP-3) have distinctive substrate specificities ( Figure 3 ). Specifically, Gly was significantly overrepresented at the P7, P4, P2, P1, P3 0 and P6 0 positions surrounding the cleavage sites (P < 0.05, Figure 3 ). Owing to the intriguing selectivity of multiple residue types across different positions, it is much more difficult to clearly define distinctive sequence motifs for the MMPs. These results highlight the importance and need to improve the substrate cleavage site prediction by developing more accurate machine learning-based predictors, especially for proteases for which canonical sequence motif-based methods fail to perform well.",

After the two-step feature selection based on mRMR and FFS, seven types of features remained in the final optimal feature subset of cleavage site prediction for eight proteases. To evaluate the contribution of these seven different feature types to the classification performance for individual proteases, the performance difference can be measured using the AUC value when a particular feature type is removed from the classifier. This measure thus represents the additional value of such feature type in cleavage site prediction, accounting for both interaction and compensatory effects between features [127] .

This can be observed by comparing the ROC curves and AUC values between the iProt-Sub models and iProt-Sub-ALL-Fea models in Figure 6 .

            "text": "To facilitate high-throughput prediction and analyses of novel protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites, we have implemented an online Web server of iProt-Sub for the wider research community to use. The Web server was designed with a userfriendly interface and modern data visualization functionality and is freely available at http://iProt-Sub.erc.monash.edu/. It was implemented using Java Server Pages running Tomcat7 and configured in the Linux environment on a 16-core server machine with 50 GB memory and a 4 TB hard disk. To submit a prediction job, the server requires protein amino acid sequences (the submission of up to 50 sequences is permitted simultaneously) in FASTA format as the input. Users are also required to provide their e-mail addresses to receive a notification e-mail that contains a link to the prediction output Web page after the submitted job is completed. For a protein sequence with 500 amino acid residues, the prediction task will generally take approximately 3 min to calculate the features and return the final prediction results. A step-by-step guideline of how to use the iProt-Sub Web server can be found at http://iProt-Sub.erc.mon ash.edu.au/help.html. Figure 7 provides an example output of the Web server. As can be seen, there are two main sections of the prediction output involving graphical visualization output ( Figure 7A ) and ranking output ( Figure 7B ) of the predicted cleavage sites in a protease family-specific manner. In terms of the graphical output, all the predicted cleavage sites are indicated by vertical lines with different colors (different colors indicate a different protease family, such as aspartic, cysteine, metallo, and serine). When hovering the mouse cursor over each differentially colored vertical line, a window pops up displaying detailed information associated with the predicted cleavage site/outcome, including the P4-P4 0 sequence segment, cleavage site P1 position and the estimated sizes of N-and C-fragment cleavage products ( Figure 7A ). This graphical visualization function can greatly facilitate the quick identification of the predicted cleavage site(s) of interest by scanning from the N-terminus to C-terminus and visually comparing the cleavage profiling within the same substrate sequence across different proteases. The ranking output provides a tab-style view of the predicted cleavage sites according to the protease family ( Figure 7B ). Each tab contains the residue position of the predicted cleavage P1 site, the sequence ID, P4-P4 0 sequence segment (with the predicted cleavage site indicated by 'j'), the estimated N-and C-fragment sizes and the cleavage probability score.",

The sectorial area for a GO term represents the number of proteins with this term, while the different colors of the sectorial area indicate the statistical significance of the enrichment for the corresponding GO term. In general, substrate proteins targeted by different protease families tend to be associated with different GO terms, but substrate proteins within the same family share similar GO terms. For example, both caspase-3 and caspase-6 substrates were found to be enriched with the GO BP terms 'Cell adhesion' and 'Biological adhesion' and with the GO MF terms 'ATP binding' and 'adenyl ribonucleotide binding'. Similar tendencies can also be observed between the MMP-2 and MMP-3 substrates. With regard to the CC terms, many of the predicted substrates were found to be located in different components, including 'Nuclear lumen', 'Intracellular organelle lumen', 'Organelle lumen' and 'Cytoskeleton', where many apoptotic morphological changes and cellular signaling activities often occur [130] .",

Calpastatin (UniProt ID: P20810) is an endogenous calpain (calcium-dependent cysteine protease) inhibitor, which is encoded by the CAST gene in humans. It consists of an N-terminal domain and four repetitive calpain-inhibitory domains (Inhibitory Domains 1-4). It has been suggested that calpastatin is involved in the control of proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein and also in muscle protein degradation in living tissue [133] . Applying iProt-Sub to perform the substrate sequence scanning to calpastatin, we correctly identified all the three experimentally verified cleavage sites for caspase-3 [131] : ALDDjLIDT, DAIDjALSS and LSSDjFTGG ( Figure 10 ). In terms of MMP-2 cleavage sites, we also identified an additional cleavage site for MMP-2: SVAGjITAI [132] . Note that all these experimentally verified cleavage sites were on the top-ranking list of hits according to the predicted probability score generated by iProt-Sub, and all were above the threshold of 0.95. Moreover, iProt-Sub-based substrate sequence scanning also led to the prediction of several other high-confidence novel potential cleavage sites for both caspase-3 and MMP-2 ( Figure 10) . These predicted cleavage sites may represent novel sites targeted for cleavage under different conditions, and require follow-up experimental validation and hypothesis-driven studies. All the results above highlight the usefulness and value of using iProt-Sub as an in silico tool for identifying novel putative cleavage targets and unraveling the protease-substrate interaction relationship.",

Our experimental evaluations indicate that the proposed iProt-Sub method outperforms those previously developed methods. iProt-Sub's improved performance can be attributed to several important aspects. First, we have compiled a comprehensive experimentally verified cleavage site data set in this work. Second, protease-specific models have been constructed, optimized and validated to achieve a better performance than other available tools using the powerful SVR algorithm coupled with a two-step feature selection procedure. Third, iProt-Sub allows high-throughput prediction of potential substrate cleavage sites for follow-up experimental validation and hypothesis-driven functional studies. A unique feature of iProt-Sub is that, unlike previously developed tools that require users to designate the protease of interest to make the prediction, iProt-Sub for a given substrate sequence will identify which, if any, of its 38 proteases will cleave that substrate. This unique feature makes iProt-Sub an attractive tool for proteomic research, especially in cases where there is insufficient knowledge about the protease(s) responsible for such cleavage to occur. We expect that iProt-Sub will be used as a valuable and powerful tool by the protease community and can deliver vital functional clues regarding the protease-substrate interactivity relationship in a cost-effective manner.",
