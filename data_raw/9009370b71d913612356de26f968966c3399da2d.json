Previous virion proteomic studies have shown that enveloped viruses carry multiple host cellular proteins both internally and externally during their life cycle.

The identified cellular proteins comprised several functional categories, including cytoskeleton proteins, annexins, molecular chaperones, chromatin modifying proteins, enzymes-binding proteins, calcium-binding proteins and signal transduction-associated proteins. Among these, three host proteins have not been previously reported in virions of other virus families, including two signal transduction-associated proteins (syntenin and Ras small GTPase) and one tumor-associated protein (tumor protein D52). The presence of five selected cellular proteins (i.e., \u03b2-actin, tubulin, annexin A2, heat shock protein Hsp90 and ezrin) associated with the purified NDV particles was validated by Western blot or immunogold labeling assays. Conclusions: The current study presented the first standard proteomic profile of NDV. The results demonstrated the incorporation of cellular proteins in NDV particles, which provides valuable information for elucidating viral infection and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Newcastle disease (ND) is a contagious fatal viral disease affecting most species of birds, which was classified as a list A infectious disease by the World Organization for Animal Health. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as the etiological agent for ND is a nonsegmented single-stranded negative sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Avulavirus within the Paramyxoviridae family [1] . NDV is endemic to many countries, most notably in domestic poultry due to their high susceptibility, and has caused tremendous economic consequences to the poultry industry throughout the world. NDV virion contains at least six structural proteins, Haemagglutinin Neuraminidase (HN), Fusion protein (F), Matrix protein (M), Nucleocapsid protein (NP), Phosphate protein (P) and Large protein (L) [2] [3] [4] [5] . HN and F are the two surface glycoproteins of viral envelope membrane, whereas NP\u3001P\u3001L and membraneassociated M are inner components of NDV virions [2] [3] [4] [5] . F protein, which is considered to be the key virulence determinant of the virus, mediates the fusion process between viruses and cell membranes [6] [7] [8] . HN is a multifunctional virion protein, which plays roles in helping membrane fusion, cell tropism determination and viral pathogenicity [9] [10] [11] . M lies beneath the viral membrane and surrounds the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex [12] . The RNP complex consists of the viral RNA coated with NP and bound by the polymerase complex that contains P and L [13] .",

Numerous host proteins have been found that incorporate into the membranes or inside the envelopes of the virions using virion proteomic approaches. Herpes virus, an enveloped DNA virus which is a leading cause of human viral diseases, is currently the best studied virus group.

The most well studied RNA virus is retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Proteomic analysis revealed that HIV virions contain a high number of host cell proteins [31, 32] . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus has also been analyzed by virion proteomics [33, 34] . In addition, 36 host-encoded cellular proteins have been found to incorporate into influenza virus (IV) virions [35] . Other enveloped RNA viruses which have been proteomically analyzed were vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [36] , infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [37] and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) [38] . Virion proteomics have been used extensively to analyze the composition of a variety of virions, leading to a more complete picture of the viral particle.",

The RNP complex of NDV particle contains three inner protein components, the major structural subunit (NP) and two associated proteins (P and L) binding together to RNA genome. Both P and NP protein were successfully obtained due to their comparatively higher expression level and smaller molecular weight; whereas the identification of L protein by MS was a difficult task, possibly due to its low-abundant in the virion and large molecular weight (about 220 kD).",

Considering that these studies were performed independently using different cell types and different mass spectrometry methods, this similarity is probably not an issue of contamination. The most likely explanation is that these viruses all share some fundamental feature and that these host proteins are involved in the processes associated with that common trait. Enveloped viruses enter the cell via a membrane fusion manner and exit by budding. Therefore, one hypothesis would be that these common incorporated host proteins play a role in the entry and release stages of the virus life cycle.",

            "text": "Enveloped viruses acquire their membranes through budding from the host cell, thus cytoskeleton proteins may be integrated inside the virions because of their propinquity to viral assembly and budding sites. Our virion proteomics identified 9 host cytoskeleton system proteins in purified NDV particles, which were the most abundant group of cellular proteins, including Tropomyosin 1 alpha, actin, actin -related protein 3 ARP3, tubulin alpha-1, annexin A2, ezrin, CAP-GLY domain containing linker protein 2, capping protein (Actin filament) muscle Z-line and KIAA0174. Numerous viral proteins interact with cytoskeleton elements. Available evidences indicate that host cytoplasm cytoskeleton components are involved in virus transport in cells, especially in the stages of virus entry and release [45] . Several studies have also indicated that cytoskeleton proteins such as Tubulin and Actin are required for viral gene expression [46, 47] and are involved in several virus budding processes [48] . Interestingly, actin was originally thought as a cellular contaminant, but later demonstrated to be an internal component of the measles virus [49, 50] . In a number of viruses, such as HIV and moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV), actin is important during their budding [51] [52] [53] . For influenza virus, actin plays indispensable roles during the endocytosis of the virus into polarized epithelia [54] . An association of M with cytoskeleton elements has been reported [55] , which indicates an essential function of actin in the replication cycle of coronavirus IBV. As for NDV, early studies have suggested that the cellular cytoskeletal framework actively participated in the structural and functional assembly of NDV transcriptive complex [56] . Therefore, cytoplasm cytoskeleton-associated proteins might take part in the assembly and budding process of newly formed NDV virions, contribute to the transportation of the virus to the correct location of host cell, and also participate in assembling the RNP complex.",

Several viruses require host molecular chaperones for entry, replication, and assembly, as well as other steps in viral production [63, 64] . In this study, we identified two molecular chaperones incorporated into purified NDV particles, HSP70 and HSP90. HSP70 interacts with various viral proteins and may be involved in the assembly of adenovirus [41] , enterovirus [42] , vaccinia virus [43] and hantaan virus [44] . Virion-associated HSP70 might participate in early events of infection, uncoating the viral capsid in a manner similar to its role in the uncoating of clathrin cages [65] . HSP70 and HSP90 have been shown to interact with hepatitis B virus reverse transcriptase and to facilitate the initiation of viral DNA synthesis from hepatitis B virus pregenomic RNA [66, 67] . HSP90, which can cooperate with other proteins such as p23 and HSP70, has 2-4 copies existing internally in a duck liver virus particle, and might be related to interaction between virus polymerase [68] . Besides, it has been proposed that HSP90 is a major host factor for viral replication of many RNA viruses [69] , implying a important role of HSP90 in NDV replication.",

All grids were then blocked with blocking buffer (5% BSA, 5% normal serum, 0.1% cold water skin gelatin, 10 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) for 30 min. After washing with PBS, immobilized virions were incubated for 1.5 h with 50 \u03bcg/ml primary antibody (in 1% BSA), and washed three times for 5 min in PBS/1% BSA. Anti-rabbit or antimouse immunoglobulin G coupled to 10 nm colloidal gold particles was used as the secondary antibody and virions were incubated in it for 40 min at RT. The unbound antibodies were removed, the grids were thoroughly washed and negatively stained with 2% sodium phosphotungstate (pH 6.5) for 1 min. Negatively stained virions were examined on a scan and transmission electron microscope. ",
