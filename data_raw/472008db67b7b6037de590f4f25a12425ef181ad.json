In experiments in vitro, three human APOBEC3 proteins (A3C, A3F and A3H) inhibited HCoV-NL63 infection and limited production of progeny virus, but did not cause hypermutation of the coronaviral genome. APOBEC3-mediated restriction was partially dependent on enzyme activity, and was reduced by the use of enzymatically inactive APOBEC3. Moreover, APOBEC3 proteins bound to the coronaviral nucleoprotein, and this interaction also affected viral replication. Although the precise molecular mechanism of deaminasedependent inhibition of coronavirus replication remains elusive, our results further our understanding of APOBEC-mediated restriction of RNA virus infections.",

APOBEC3 enzymes are considered to be part of the intrinsic defense system in eukaryotic cells, and can inhibit replication of some viruses and restrict mobile genetic elements. All APOBEC3 proteins share a cytidine-deaminase domain, which is identifiable by the primary amino acid motif His-Xaa-Glu-Xaa 23-28 -Pro-Cys-Xaa 2-4 -Cys, in which Zn 2+ is coordinated. Deamination of cytidine results in its conversion to uridine. During this process, the ammonium group on C 4 of cytidine undergoes nucleophilic attack by an activated water molecule and the APOBEC3 glutamate residue.",

Its function as an antiviral factor was discovered in 2002 through cDNA-transfer experiments that were designed to identify a cellular suppressor of an HIV-1 accessory protein, the virion infectivity factor (Vif). The primary antiretroviral activity of A3G requires its encapsidation into HIV-1 particles, and involves cytidine deamination of the reverse-transcribed first viral DNA strand, with mutations becoming fixed as G to A changes upon second-strand synthesis. Mutational frequencies can exceed 10% of all G residues (hypermutation), and may result in inhibition of viral replication. This activity is blocked by Vif protein, which specifically binds to and ubiquitinates A3G, directing it for degradation in the Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 ScIentIFIc REPORts | (2018) 8:5960 |",

The explanations for this bias is not yet known 28, 29 . One possibility is that, over an evolutionary timescale, genomes of coronaviruses might have been shaped by cytidine deamination.

Notably, some infectious progeny were produced in the presence of these proteins, and serial passaging of virus was possible. Surprisingly, if cells overexpressing A3C, A3F or A3H were infected with the progeny virions, no restriction of virus replication occurred.

We were not able to develop a HCoV-NL63 molecular clone containing GC-rich elements, most likely because of low stability of the reverse genetics system for this virus (data not shown). We therefore developed a HCoV-229E clone containing a GC-rich region 35, 36 . Replication of this virus was inhibited in cells expressing A3C, A3F or A3H, but no mutations were observed in the modified region. The lack of observed hypermutation may result from proofreading and repair of the coronavirus RNA genome 37 , and suggests that inhibition of coronaviral replication by APOBEC3 proteins does not result from deamination of viral RNA. It was previously shown that, for some RNA viruses, APOBEC-mediated inhibition is deamination-independent. In our system, catalytically inactive A3C, A3F and A3H proteins only had marginal inhibitory effect on virus replication. We suggest that APOBEC3 proteins may affect coronavirus replication by two mechanisms: first, by deamination of yet unidentified cellular targets or deamination of single sites in the coronaviral genome; and second, by direct, non-catalytic interaction with viral RNA and/or proteins. APOBEC proteins may interact with the coronaviral N protein, which is an essential structural protein for formation of the viral ribonucleocapsid, and which also has a role in virus replication [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Our results demonstrated that all APOBEC3 proteins with inhibitory activity bound to the N protein. The direct, editing-independent mechanism by which APOBEC3 proteins inhibit HCoV-NL63 replication is still to be elucidated, but it is possible that interaction with the N protein interferes with virus replication and progeny production.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results show that three APOBEC3 proteins (A3C, A3F and A3H) inhibit coronaviral replication. The molecular mechanism of deaminase-dependent inhibition of coronavirus replication remains elusive and may depend on deamination of single sites in the coronaviral genome, or in a cellular target or targets. Passage of HCoV-NL63 in cells expressing APOBEC3 proteins results in virus that is resistant to APOBEC-mediated inhibition, possibly indicating the presence of an unidentified factor that counteracts APOBEC3 activity. The deaminase-independent component of viral inhibition may result from interaction between viral N protein and APOBEC3 proteins. Human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures. Human epithelial cells were isolated from conductive airways resected from transplant patients. The study was approved by the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland (approval no: KNW/0022/KB1/17/10 dated on 16.02.2010). A written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Tissues were procured at the Silesian Center for Heart Diseases, Zabrze, Poland. No organs/tissues were procured from prisoners. Cells were dislodged by protease treatment, and later mechanically detached from the connective tissue. Resulting primary cells were first cultured in selective media to proliferate. Further, cells were trypsinised and transferred onto permeable Transwell insert supports (\u03c6 = 6.5). Cell differentiation was stimulated by media additives and removal of media from the apical side. In such a manner cells were cultured for 6-8 weeks to form well-differentiated, pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium 43 . All experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.",

Cells were trypsinised, centrifuged and resuspended in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5) followed by lysis in RIPA buffer for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged (10 min at 12,000 \u00d7 g) and the pelleted cell debris was discarded. Resulting supernatants were mixed with sample buffer (0.5 M Tris pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50 mg/ml DTT), boiled for 5 min, cooled on ice, and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels alongside dual color Page Ruler Pre-stained Protein size markers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland). The separated proteins were then transferred onto a Westran S PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare, Poland) by wet blotting (Bio-Rad, Poland) for 1 h, 100 Volts in transfer buffer: 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol at 4 \u00b0C. The membranes were then blocked by overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C in TBS-Tween (0.1%) buffer supplemented with 5% skimmed milk (BioShop, Canada). A rabbit anti-HA Taq antibody (1 \u03bcg/ml; Antibodies-online, USA) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (0.35 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Poland) were used to detect the HA-tagged APOBEC3 proteins in cell lysates. Mouse anti-HCoV-NL63-N protein antibody (500 ng/ml; Ingenansa, Spain) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (65 ng/ml; Dako, Denmark) were used to detect the HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein. A rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody (1:5000 dilution; Cell Signalling Technology, Poland) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (0.35 \u03bcg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Poland) were used to detect the GAPDH in cell lysates. All antibodies were diluted in 1% skimmed milk/TBS-Tween (0.1%). The signal was developed using the Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, USA) and visualised by exposing the membrane to an X-ray film (Kodak, Poland).",
