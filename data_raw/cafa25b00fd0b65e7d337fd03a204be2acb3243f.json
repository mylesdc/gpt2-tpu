The aim of the present study was to evaluated an antiviral effect of ORNs-D-M against parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3); influenza CA709, PR834; avian influenza virus H5N2 (AIV) in vitro by a TCID 50 ; hemadsorption and neuraminidase activity assays; and clinical efficiency of ORNs-D-M in patients with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) of various etiologies by PCR assay and AmpliSens test systems. It was observed that ORNs-D-M have an antiviral activity against the influenza CA709, PR834, PIV3, and AIV in vitro. The injectable dosage form of ORNs-D-M was shown to have a stronger antiviral effect compared to capsule form. It was also detected that the injectable form of ORNs-D-M significantly reduced the neuraminidase activity of influenza PR834. A complex treatment of patients with ORNs-D-M had a positive effect on the course of the disease, it accelerated patients' recovery. Treatment with ORNs-D-M caused eradication of adeno-and influenza viruses in patients with ARI. This drug contributed to significant decrease in duration of febrile period and cough. Comprehensive treatment with ORNs-D-M improved the disease clinical findings significantly. Collectively, these results suggested that ORNs-D-M may be used at co-infection with influenza and other respiratory viruses as a medical antiviral drug.",

Viral pathogens are the most common etiological agents of ARIs [13, 15, 37] . In the presented study, ORNs-D-M were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the PIV3, pandemic influenza CA709, and influenza virus PR834 in vitro. The study of ORNs-D-M antiviral effect against the PIV3 in vitro proved that the both forms of the drug can inhibit this virus infectivity. The injection form of ORNs-D-M had stronger anti-PIV3 effect than the capsule form. The degree of antiviral effect of both forms depends on the concentration of the drug. Analyses of available avian influenza viruses circulating worldwide suggest that most viruses are susceptible to oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir [38] . However, some evidence of antiviral resistance has been reported in HPAI Asian lineage AIV (cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/prevention.htm). Therefore, it is important to search for the influenza antiviral drugs with a wide spectrum of antiviral action. The results of this research ( Figure 2 ) proved that ORNs-D-M at concentration of 5.0 mg/mL have activity against the AIV, selectivity index >3. The obtained results suggest that ORNs-D-M can probably be used as an antiviral drug against an AIV.

These results suggest greater efficiency of the injection form, as well as different sensitivities of different strains of NA to the inhibiting effect of ORNs-D-M. Our results also suggest antiviral activity in ORNs-D-M against the influenza CA709, PR834, AIV, and PIV3 in vitro.
