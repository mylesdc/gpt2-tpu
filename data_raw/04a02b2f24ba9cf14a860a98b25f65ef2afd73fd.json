In hospitals, control efforts would benefit from accurate estimation of asymptomatic colonization and infection importation rates from the community. However, developing such estimates remains challenging due to limited observation of colonization and complicated transmission dynamics within hospitals and the community. Here, we develop an inference framework that can estimate these key quantities by combining statistical filtering techniques, an agent-based model, and real-world patient-to-patient contact networks, and use this framework to infer nosocomial transmission and infection importation over an outbreak spanning 6 years in 66 Swedish hospitals. In particular, we identify a small number of patients with disproportionately high risk of colonization. In retrospective control experiments, interventions targeted to these individuals yield a substantial improvement over heuristic strategies informed by number of contacts, length of stay and contact tracing.",

Initially confined to healthcare facilities, MRSA has since become increasingly prevalent in the broader population in both the United States and Europe (Chambers, 2001; Naimi et al., 2003; Zetola et al., 2005; Hetem et al., 2012; Kouyos et al., 2013; Tosas Auguet et al., 2016) . This entwined transmission among hospitals and the community has obscured understanding of the dynamics and persistence of MRSA. Further, MRSA can colonize patients without symptoms for years, during which it can be transmitted stealthily (Cooper et al., 2004a) . These epidemiological features have greatly complicated its control and elimination.",

In particular, Sweden remains one of the few countries with a low prevalence of MRSA infection (Stenhem et al., 2006) . A substantial proportion of MRSA cases in Sweden has been imported from abroad due to traveling and healthcare contacts in foreign countries (Stenhem et al., 2010; Larsson et al., 2014) .

            "text": "To facilitate better control of MRSA in hospital settings, several critical questions need to be answered. First, what are the relative roles of nosocomial transmission and infection importation from the community? Public health officials require an accurate assessment of the current force of infection within and into hospitals in order to deploy appropriate containment measures; however, with the increasing prevalence of MRSA in the community, disentangling HAIs from infections imported from the community has become difficult. Second, how many patients are colonized, and who and where are these high-risk individuals? Effective control would benefit from accurate determination of asymptomatic colonization rates in the general population; failure to estimate and account for colonization may result in long-term control issues (Cooper et al., 2004a) . Although colonized patients can be identified using sequencing methods (Harris et al., 2010; Long et al., 2014) , the expense of these assays limits their application, particularly in underdeveloped countries where MRSA has become endemic. In light of this situation, mathematical modeling offers an alternative approach for locating individuals with a high probability of colonization and guiding the targeted deployment of laboratory testing (Grundmann and Hellriegel, 2006; van Kleef et al., 2013; Opatowski et al., 2011) . However, this inference problem is again complicated by the unobserved stealth transmission dynamics that occurs in the highly complex time-varying contact networks of the real world (Donker et al., 2010; Vanhems et al., 2013; Jarynowski and Liljeros, 2015; Obadia et al., 2015a; Obadia et al., 2015b; Rocha et al., 2016; Nekkab et al., 2017; Duval et al., 2018) .",

We use this system to infer the transmission dynamics of the most commonly diagnosed MRSA strain, UK EMRSA-15 Das et al., 2013) , from multiple Swedish hospitals (Materials and methods). Key features estimated include the number of infections acquired in hospital and imported from outside, as well as the locations of individuals with a high colonization probability. Such information is crucial for designing cost-effective control measures (Cooper et al., 2003;  eLife digest Antibiotic-resistant bacteria like the Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can live in people for many years without making them sick. During this time, the bacteria can spread to others who come in contact with the MRSA-infected person. The number of people with stealth MRSA infections living in the community has been increasing. As a result, hospitals may not only be dealing with MRSA infections that originated onsite, but also cases imported from the community. That makes tracking and controlling MRSA infections in hospitals difficult. Now, Pei et al. show that computer modeling can help identify the role MRSA infections from the community play in hospital outbreaks and test ways to control them. In the experiments, data from an MRSA outbreak that occurred at 66 Swedish hospitals over 6 years were analyzed using statistical methods and computer modeling. This helped to identify patients who were likely colonized with MRSA within the hospital and those who had acquired it in the community. Next, Pei et al. used computer modeling to test what would have happened if these high-risk individuals had received interventions to prevent them from spreading MRSA in the hospital. This showed that targeting individuals at high-risk of a MRSA infection could reduce the spread of MRSA in the hospital.",

In this study dataset, however, we observed no clear clustering of infections in certain wards. In Figure 1B , we use a raster plot to display the distribution of infections in 114 infected wards over time.

However, the average number of infections is not observed to increase linearly with patient-days, indicating that patient-days per ward alone cannot explain the observed patterns of infection (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). While these raw features provide a general understanding of MRSA transmission, they cannot be effectively employed to assess infection or colonization risk in a specific ward due to their largely overlapping distributions, which prevent a clear classification of risk. Instead, a quantitative analysis using mathematical modeling is needed.",

For instance, even though we were provided no information about ward type, some of the heterogeneity among wards can be represented by the contact pattern specific to each ward, for example a longer length of stay in long-term healthcare units. Other aspects, however, are simplified; for example, due to the observed absence of infection clusters ( Figure 1B) , we assume a uniform transmission rate across different wards within the model.

Connections between different connected components change over time due to the transfer and readmission of patients. 128,119 patients were transferred from one ward to another during their stay, and another 280,506 patients were readmitted within 1 year of their previous discharge. These patient movements connect healthcare facilities that would otherwise be isolated in the network and facilitate long-range transmission across multiple hospitals. A direct consequence of this patient movement is difficulty tracking the indirect transmission path of MRSA across different hospitals. For instance, a patient located in one hospital can be involved in the transmission occurring in another when he/she moves across multiple facilities. Detailed analyses of the contact network structure and hospitalization traffic can be found in Appendix 1.",

            "text": "Model patients are classified into three categories: susceptible individuals who are free of MRSA (S), colonized individuals who carry the bacteria asymptomatically (C), and confirmed positive patients (P). The model simulates two connected dynamics: nosocomial transmission and importation from the community. Here, the community is broadly defined as all locations outside the study hospitals, and may include households and healthcare facilities not covered in the study. Within hospitals, transitions between states (S, C, P) are governed by parameters that help define either interaction dynamics or the progression of infection. Specifically, a susceptible individual staying in a ward with a colonized person can become MRSA colonized with transmission probability b per day. In our model, we assume that patients within a ward have the same rate of contact with each other, presumably mediated by the shared healthcare workers in a ward. The transmission process is densitydependent, as the force of infection in a ward increases with the number of colonized patients within the ward (Begon et al., 2002) . Upon colonization, asymptomatic persons can return to the susceptible state at a spontaneous decolonization rate a, or they can test positive with an infection progression rate p. We assume infected patients will receive treatment, no longer spread bacteria, and return to state S with a recovery rate . Treatment is assumed to continue until infected patients are clear of MRSA. Given the exponential decay of infection probability, the characteristic treatment period is 1= days. Note that colonization only occurs between individuals connected by a link in the contact network, whereas decolonization, infection and recovery progress spontaneously, independent of the contact network. Outside the study hospitals, the transmission process is not explicitly simulated; instead, two additional parameters are introduced to represent transmission intensity. For Sources for parameter rangesa: (Cooper et al., 2004a; Bootsma et al., 2006; Eveillard et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2013; Macal et al., 2014; Jarynowski and Liljeros, 2015) ; p: (Kajita et al., 2007; Jarynowski and Liljeros, 2015) ; : (D' Agata et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2013) ; b: Prior; I 0 : Prior; C 0 : Prior, (Hidron et al., 2005; Eveillard et al., 2006; Jarvis et al., 2012) . For each individual, the infection progress rate p is drawn after a is specified. patients who appear for the first time in hospital, we assume they belong to states C and P with probability C 0 and I 0 , respectively. As importation rates of colonized and infected patients depend on the time-varying MRSA prevalence outside hospitals, we assume the parameters C 0 and I 0 are time-dependent. Once patients appear in the contact network, the evolution of their states follows the dynamics as defined above. After discharge, we continue tracking the progression of colonized individuals; however, transmission outside the study hospitals is not represented. The flow of individuals between categories is illustrated schematically in Figure 1E . For a realistic scenario, disease-related model parameters may differ from person to person. To account for this variability during implementation, parameters, for example a, p and , for each individual are randomly drawn from uniform ranges obtained from prior literature ( Table 1) . The parameter ranges are enlarged slightly to cover the values reported in these works. Our main objective is to infer the three most important parameters governing transmission dynamics: the transmission rate b, the infection importation rate I 0 and the colonization importation rate C 0 .",

IF can be used to infer the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of parameters in epidemic models and has been successfully applied to infectious diseases such as cholera (King et al., 2008) and measles (He et al., 2010) . Initially developed for ODE models, IF has subsequently been generalized for other model forms (e.g. stochastic models) using the plug-and-play approach (He et al., 2010) . Here, we adapt IF for agentbased models, leveraging an equation-free approach (Kevrekidis et al., 2003) that allows for mapping between the system-level observations (e.g. weekly incidence) used for the IF and the individual-level states evolved in the agent-based model (Appendix 1). In applying the IF, we perform multiple iterations using an efficient Bayesian filtering algorithm -the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) (Anderson, 2001) , which has been widely used in infectious disease forecast and inference (Shaman and Karspeck, 2012; Yang et al., 2015; Pei et al., 2018a; Kandula et al., 2018) . Details of the IF implementation can be found in Materials and methods.",

We ran 20 iterations of the EAKF within the IF framework. In Figure 2A , we display the inference results for the three parameters b, I 0 and C 0 at different iterations in one realization of the IF algorithm. The blue horizontal lines mark the target values used to generate the outbreak. The orange boxes show the distribution of posterior parameters (300 ensemble members) after each iteration. The IF algorithm returns the stabilized ensemble mean as the MLEs of parameters. As a result of the stochastic nature of model dynamics and initialization of the inference algorithm, different runs of the IF algorithm usually return slightly different MLEs. To obtain the credible intervals (CIs) for the MLEs, we repeated the inference for 100 times (see Materials and methods). The inferred mean values and 95% CIs for the parameters b, I 0 and C 0 are 9:00; \u00bd8:07; 9:68 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 , 1:91; \u00bd1:38; 2:54 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 and 7:18; \u00bd5:84; 8:70 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 , with the actual values b \u00bc 9 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 , I 0 \u00bc 2 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 and C 0 \u00bc 7:5 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 . The inference system thus accurately estimates b and I 0 from noisy observations, and slightly underestimates C 0 . In its implementation, the performance of the inference system depends on the sensitivity of the observations to each parameter. In the agent-based model used here, observed incidence is less sensitive to C 0 due to the long period of colonization. As a consequence, estimates of C 0 do not always exactly match the actual target and are here biased low. Nevertheless, this slight underestimation does not significantly affect the inferred dynamics. To demonstrate this insensitivity, we ran 1000 simulations using the inferred mean parameters and obtained distributions of weekly incidence from the stochastic agent-based model. The distributions of weekly incidence (blue boxes) are compared with the observed cases (red crosses) in Figure 2B . We also evaluated the agreement between the observed and simulated incidences in Figure 2B We repeated the above analysis for the colonized population ( Figure 2C ) and found that the numbers of unobserved colonized patients can also be well estimated by the inference system. Moreover, the inference system can distinguish the number of infections transmitted in hospital and imported from outside the study hospitals ( Figure 2D ",

Because the UK EMRSA-15 transmission parameters are unlikely to remain constant over the entire 6-year outbreak cycle, we inferred model parameters year by year (52 weeks). Beginning with the first year, we ran the IF inference sequentially through each year. Between 2 consecutive years, the inferred results from the previous year were used to initialize the inference system in the next (see Figure 3 -figure supplement 1). In Figure 3A , we present the distributions of the key parameters b, I 0 and C 0 for each year, generated from 100 independent realizations of the IF algorithm. The parameter estimates together with the associated 95% CIs are reported in Table 2 . All parameter values increased in the first 3 or 4 years, and then gradually decreased thereafter. The inferred parameters can be plugged back into the model to run simulations and obtain information addressing our questions of interest (see Video 1 for an example). For instance, we performed 1000 model simulations using the inferred mean parameter values, and generated distributions of incidence from the stochastic agent-based model. These distributions are compared to observations in Figure 3B . All observations fall within the whisker range of Tukey boxplots (see more analyses in Figure 3 -figure supplement 2). To further explore whether some of the key observed statistics can be reproduced using the inferred parameters, we display the distribution of the number of infected wards in Figure 3C . The observed number lies at the peak of the simulated distribution (vertical dash line). The spatial distribution of infections among different wards can be characterized by the distribution of wards with a certain number of infections in an outbreak. In Figure 3D , we compare this distribution obtained from 1000 simulations with what we observed in the data (red diamonds): the observed distribution agrees well with the The following source data is available for simulated distributions. This close matching indicates that the model structure and inferred parameters can reliably reproduce the observed outbreak pattern in both space and time (see also Figure 3-figure supplement 2). In addition to generating a good model fit, the inference system also discriminates the burdens of nosocomial transmission and infection importation. Nosocomial and imported infections are distinguished by the location of MRSA colonization: if patients acquire MRSA in hospital, they are classified as nosocomial transmission cases; otherwise they are imported cases. Figure 3E compares the distributions of both types of infections generated from 1000 simulations: a substantial number of infections are inferred as importations. In clinical practice, the number of days between hospital admission and infection is usually used to distinguish hospital-acquired from community-acquired infections, typically with 48 hr used as the threshold. We performed this classification and compared the findings with our inference result. As shown in Figure 3 -figure supplement 3, the number of imported and nosocomial cases obtained from inference generally matches the classification result using days from admission to infection.",

Concurrently, both the infection and colonization importation rates, I 0 and C 0 , also experienced growth. This simultaneous rise may have been caused by household transmission initiated by asymptomatically colonized patients discharged from hospitals. After this growth phase, both transmission and importation rates were suppressed. Finally, the UK EMRSA-15 outbreak appears near eliminated in Swedish hospitals, represented by the inferred low values of all parameters. However, if control measures in hospital were to be relaxed, the colonized patients might spark another outbreak due to the lengthy colonization period, which highlights the need for asymptomatic colonization control in order to effect MRSA elimination (Cooper et al., 2004a) .",

Screening can identify colonized patients and evaluate the general colonization burden; however, it is an inefficient and costly measure that wastes resources that otherwise could be used to solve more urgent problems. As shown above, given the heterogeneity of contact among patients, levels of exposure to the hazard of colonization differ substantially. As a result, more efficient intervention strategies can be designed that leverage this individual-level heterogeneity. In Figure 4A , we display the inferred distribution of colonized patients in the Swedish hospitals over time. Colonized patient numbers peak in the middle of the record and decline thereafter. To determine who and where these high-risk individuals reside within the network, we can use the agent-based model to quantify colonization risk at the individual level. The distribution of individual colonization probability at T = 40 (week 160), generated from 10 4 simulations using inferred parameters, is displayed in Figure 4B . A clear heavy-tailed power-law distribution y / x \u00c02:13 emerges in which the colonization probability spans several orders of magnitude (see Figure 4 -figure supplement 1 and Appendix 1 for a rigorous statistical analysis of this distribution) (Clauset et al., 2009; Muchnik et al., 2013) . The complex spatiotemporal interaction patterns within the network give rise to a small number of patients with a disproportionately high risk of colonization. To examine how these individuals distribute among hospitals, we visualize the colonization probability in Figure 4C . High-risk patients tend to appear in densely connected clusters.",

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions, we performed a retrospective control experiment. Specifically, we used the inferred parameters in Figure 3A to run the model for 6 years to reproduce the outbreak. Every 4 weeks, we used currently available information (as would be available in real time) to estimate patient colonization probabilities (see details in Materials and methods). The colonization probabilities estimated in real time are highly correlated with the results obtained using information from the whole course of the epidemic, shown in Figure 4C . During the model integration, every 4 weeks, we selected patients with an estimated colonization probability higher than a certain threshold for screening. If positive, these inpatients were decolonized. To assess the impact of decolonization success rate on intervention impact, two efficiencies, 100% and 75%, were tested, and we repeated the experiment 1000 times. The findings show that the proposed intervention strategy can avert considerable numbers of colonization and infection ( Figure 5A-B) . Decreasing the decolonization threshold leads to a larger screened population (as shown in the inset of Figure 5B ), and thus reduces colonization and infection further. However, the marginal benefit becomes negligible below a certain threshold value, as the remaining colonized and infected patients are possibly caused by importation, which cannot be directly controlled by inpatient intervention. The decolonization success rate also plays an important role, as indicated by the increased colonization and infection for the lower success rate.",

By varying the fraction of patients selected from the ranking (from 0% to 5%), we can inspect the control results for different numbers of screened patients. For contact tracing, upon each observation of infection, we tracked patients who stayed in the same ward with an infected individual within a certain time window prior to the infection, and screened those possibly colonized patients in hospitals. Tracing time windows ranging from 1 day to 14 days were tested. The number of screened patients does not increase significantly with tracing times longer than 14 days.

Previous studies have developed methods to infer transmission risk factors and reconstruct transmission paths using individual-level infection data for diseases such as H1N1 and MERS-CoV (Cauchemez et al., 2011; Cauchemez and Ferguson, 2012; Cauchemez et al., 2016) .

This simplification is valid for the study Swedish hospitals, as we observed no infection clusters and the model reproduced key statistics of observations well. However, in other settings, clustering analysis and ward information may be necessary before the application of the inference system. Should certain wards suffer a much higher rate of infection, a separate suite of parameters can be defined and inferred for these wards, using priors that better represent this more intense transmission. We also only considered transmission among patients staying in the same ward. In the future, more contact information such as healthcare workers shared by a group of patients could be incorporated into the contact network. In addition, as the community defined in the model may include non-sampled hospitals, inferred community risk may have been overestimated as it also included contributions from those healthcare facilities outside the network.",

Should more data (e.g. surgery or treatment records) become available, this additional information could be incorporated into the agent-based model and used to refine the present results. Our model-inference framework provides a foundational platform for flexible simulation and inference of antibiotic resistant pathogens. In this study, we applied this system to Swedish hospitals with low MRSA prevalence. However, in the future, it could be used to provide actionable information for disease control in less developed settings where MRSA is endemic. In a highly interconnected area, transmission of antibiotic resistant pathogens from endemic regions to epidemic-free hospitals is more likely. This risk calls for containment measures in the general population and collaborative control efforts among multiple healthcare facilities (Smith et al., 2005; D'Agata et al., 2009; Ciccolini et al., 2014; Slayton et al., 2015) .",

The exact dates and ward types are confidential for the protection of patient privacy. In total, 2,041,531 admission records were collected. The hospitalization dataset is quite comprehensive as the patients constitute over one third of the total 2.2 million population of Stockholm County.

Diagnosis was performed on patients with symptomatic infections as well as asymptomatic patients in contact with positive cases. A total of 991 positive cases from 172 different strains were confirmed, and the most prevalent strain was UK EMRSA-15 (289 cases). UK EMRSA-15 is present in 16 countries worldwide Das et al., 2013) . Here, we focus on this specific strain.

The IF framework is designed as follows: an ensemble of system states, which represent the distribution of parameters, are repeatedly adjusted using filtering techniques in a series of iterations, during which the variance of the parameters is gradually tuned down. In the process, the distribution of parameters is iteratively optimized per observations and narrowed down to values that achieve maximum likelihood. This approach is based on an analytical proof that guarantees its convergence under mild assumptions (Ionides et al., 2006) .",

Unlike particle filtering, which requires a large ensemble size (usually of the order O(10 4 ) or higher) (Snyder et al., 2008) , the EAKF can generate results similar in performance using only hundreds of ensemble members (Shaman and Karspeck, 2012) . Originally developed for use in weather prediction, the EAKF assumes a Gaussian distribution of both the prior and likelihood, and adjusts the prior distribution to a posterior using Bayes rule in a deterministic way such that the first two moments (mean and variance) of an observed variable are adjusted while higher moments remain unchanged during the update (Anderson, 2001) . In epidemiological studies, the EAKF has been widely used for parameter inference and forecast of infectious diseases (Shaman and Karspeck, 2012; Yang et al., 2015; 2018a; Kandula et al., 2018) .

Here, for a highly stochastic system, evaluating the Fisher information numerically is challenging. As a result, we took another approach by running multiple realizations of the IF algorithm. In different runs, the MLEs are slightly different due to stochasticity in the agent-based model and in the initialization of the inference algorithm. In this work, we ran 100 independent realizations to generate the average MLEs of inferred parameters and their corresponding 95% CIs.

ABC-based methods employ numerical simulations to approximate the likelihood function, in which the simulated samples are compared with the observed data. In a typical ABC rejection algorithm, large numbers of parameters are sampled from the prior distribution. For each set of parameters, the distance between simulated samples (generated using the parameters) and observed data is calculated. Parameters resulting in a distance larger than a certain tolerance are rejected, and the retained parameters form the posterior distribution. ABC methods can fully explore the likelihood landscape in parameter space. However, it requires large numbers of simulations, which may be prohibitive for the large-scale agent-based models considered here. In addition, a good choice of the tolerance in the rejection algorithm is needed. The IF algorithm, instead, is applicable to computationally expensive agent-based models, but may become trapped in the local optimum of the posterior distribution. In practice, this problem can be alleviated by exploring a larger prior parameter space and setting a slower quenching speed, that is, a smaller discount factor a.",

Figure 2 presents the synthetic situation where nosocomial transmission accounts for the majority of incidence (see Figure 2D -E). To evaluate the goodness of fit for incidence number in Figure 2B , we performed the following statistical analysis. As the agent-based model is a highly stochastic system, the observed incidence in Figure 2B is only one possible outcome of the actual dynamics, whereas in our analysis, the stochasticity of incidence number needs to be considered. To this end, we compared several summary statistics quantifying the goodness of fit in Figure 2B with their distributions calculated from synthetic outbreaks (surrogate data) generated from the inferred dynamics. We first considered the log likelihood of observations. In particular, we generated 1000 synthetic outbreaks using the inferred parameters, and approximated the distribution of incidence number at each week. Then we calculated the log likelihood for the observed incidence in each synthetic outbreak, and estimated its distribution using these 1000 log likelihood values computed from the surrogate data. In Figure 2 -figure supplement 1A, we compared the log likelihood computed from Figure 2B (vertical red line) with this distribution (blue bars) and calculated the 2-sided p-value. The p-value is well above zero, indicating that, in terms of log likelihood, our inferred dynamics span and thus agree well with the observed incidence. In other words, the observed incidence in Figure 2B is a typical outcome from our inferred dynamics. The same analysis was also applied to root-mean-square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and Pearson correlation coefficient (Figure 2figure supplement 1B-D). The RMSE, R 2 and Pearson correlation coefficient were calculated using the incidence time series in each synthetic outbreak and the mean incidence time series averaged over 1000 simulations.",
