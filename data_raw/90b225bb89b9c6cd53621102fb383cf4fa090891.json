This has limited the use of antisense to systems where techniques have been worked out to introduce the molecules into cells, such as embryos and cell cultures. Uncharged antisense bearing a group of guanidinium moieties on either a linear peptide or dendrimer scaffold can enter cells by endocytosis and subsequently escape from endosomes into the cytosol/nuclear compartment of cells. These technologies allow systemic administration of antisense, making gene knockdowns and splice modification feasible in adult animals; this review presents examples of such animal studies. Techniques developed with PPMOs, which are an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide linked to a Morpholino oligo, can also be performed using commercially available Vivo-Morpholinos, which are eight guanidinium groups on a dendrimeric scaffold linked to a Morpholino oligo. Antisense-based techniques such as blocking translation, modifying pre-mRNA splicing, inhibiting miRNA maturation and inhibiting viral replication can be conveniently applied in adult animals by injecting PPMOs or Vivo-Morpholinos.",

Unmodified Morpholinos have been used routinely to block translation, modify splicing, inhibit miRNA activity and inhibit viral replication as well as more exotic RNAblocking applications [5] . The Morpholino antisense structural type has been a revolutionary tool in developmental biology [6] . Success in embryos came by microinjecting Morpholino oligos into eggs or single or few celled zygotes, so that during cell division the Morpholinos were apportioned into daughter cells. This neatly avoided the problem of delivering the antisense separately into each cell of a many-celled organism [7] . In addition to their use to determine gene functions and interactions in embryos, Morpholino antisense oligos have been used for research into a broad range of diseases as well as several clinical trials (AVI BioPharma, Inc.). In most cases, carrying work from research to therapeutic applications of unmodified Morpholino oligos has been limited by difficulties with in vivo delivery [8] . However, delivery of relatively high doses of unmodified Morpholinos into dystrophic muscle in animal models of DMD has induced expression of functional Dystrophin in skeletal muscle [9, 10] and unmodified Morpholinos are currently in clinical trial for treatment of DMD (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00844597).",

The activated subunits are added to a synthesis resin with washing, deprotection and activation steps for each activated base added. Oligos are cleaved from the resin and deprotected with ammonium hydroxide, then purified and quantitated, often followed by lyophilization and sterilization [11] . Substitutions such as peptides or the dendrimer scaffold for guanidinium may be added to the 3' morpholine nitrogen while the oligo is still attached to the synthesis resin.

            "text": "Unmodified Morpholino oligos are endocytosed but have little to no activity against their RNA targets. Uptake by endocytosis does not mean the antisense oligos are reaching the cytoplasm or nucleus of the cell. Fluorescently-labeled Morpholinos can be detected as dim punctuate fluorescence within endosomes, but in most cells too little antisense escapes from the endosomes to the cytosol/nuclear compartment to be biologically active [2] . Morpholinos are not degraded in endosomes [12] but remain trapped. Many biological problems are best studied in adults and so a method that allows entry of antisense into most or all cells in an adult organism is very desirable. Ideally this systemic delivery could be accomplished by routine means such as intravenous or intraperitoneal injections. A technology that allows enough of the endocytosed oligos to escape from endosomes to have biological activity would enable in vivo delivery of oligos administered by systemic injection. Such technologies have now been developed: PPMOs and Vivo-Morpholinos. A PPMO may have an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide linked to either the 3' end or the 5' end of the Morpholino oligo [13] . The arginines have guanidinium moieties as part of their side chains, and the presence of these guanidiniums have been shown to increase cellular uptake of conjugated materials [14] . Studies of the mechanism of PPMO entry have shown that the cell-penetrating peptides offer two advantages over unmodified Morpholinos: enhanced uptake into endosomes and, critically, enhanced ensodomal escape [15] . A Vivo-Morpholino has an octaguanidinium dendrimer constructed on the 3' end of a Morpholino oligo [16] (Figure 1 ).",

            "text": "The first effective chemically-mediated method for systemic delivery of Morpholino antisense was based on covalently linking the oligos to cell-penetrating peptides, using arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides to deliver uncharged antisense molecules [17] . These molecules are called peptide-linked phosphorodiamidate Morpholino oligomers, or PPMO for short. Research to develop more safe and effective peptide sequences for PPMOs has been the focus of Hong Moulton's group at AVI BioPharma Inc. [18, 19] , where preclinical work on PPMOs for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is currently ongoing. Studies on PPMOs have shown that uptake of the oligos is an energy-dependant and temperature-dependant process that can be prevented using endocytosis inhibitors; these characteristics indicate that uptake of the PPMOs is by endocytosis [20] . A fraction of endocytosed PPMOs escape from the endosome, entering the cytosol and nuclear compartment where they can block mRNA translation and modify pre-mRNA splicing [21] . Intravenous injection [22] , intraperitoneal injection or intranasal administration [23] of PPMOs to mice have inhibited viral replication. Injections of PPMOs into transgenic mice carrying engineered splice-reporter genes have triggered expression of green fluorescent protein throughout the tissues [24] . Positively-charged arginine amino acid residues are not electrostatically attracted to uncharged antisense such as Morpholino oligos or peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligos, so the positively charged arginines are free to interact with membranes [25] . At the end of an arginine amino acid's side chain is a guanidinium group, which carries the amino acid's positive charge. This charged guanidinium group is not only attracted to a phosphate because of the phosphate's negative charge, it can also form two hydrogen bonds with the phosphate's oxygens. This makes the attraction of a guanidinium and a phosphate an unusually strong non-covalent interaction [26] . It may be this strong interaction that distorts the endosomal membrane and renders it permeable.",

At the start codon, the large subunit of the ribosome docks to small ribosomal subunit and then the process begins of linking together amino acids to form the new protein. Morpholinos that block the journey of the ribosomal initiation complex from the 5'-cap to the start codon, halting translation of the mRNA before the linking of amino acids can start. These Morpholinos can bind to RNA targets anywhere in the 5'-UTR through the start of the coding region, so long as the oligo binds onto the start codon or upstream (to the 5' direction) of the start codon [34] .",

Usually (but not always [38] ) the target sites for miRNAs are in the 3'-UTR of mRNAs. miRNA is formed when a short stem-loop (hairpin) with the appropriate geometry forms in a newly-transcribed RNA. In the nucleus, the hairpin is recognized and cleaved by the Drosha nuclease, which cleaves both strands of the stem and leaves a few single-stranded overhanging bases. The resulting stem-loop is exported to the cytosol where it is recognized and cleaved by the Dicer nuclease, which removes the loop and also leaves a few single-stranded overhanging bases. The resulting short double-stranded RNA is loaded onto a protein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where a protein in the Argonaute family binds to one strand, called the guide strand, and cleaves the other strand.

A typical strategy is to design a 25-base Morpholino to bind the entire guide strand sequence (around 21 bases) and slightly into the loop sequence, allowing both inhibition of mature miRNA activity on RISC and inhibition of miRNA maturation by blocking Dicer. Another option is protecting a mRNA target. By binding to its complementary miRNA, a Morpholino blocks RISC from accessing the mRNA, thus relieving translation of the mRNA from inhibition by the miRNA and protecting the mRNA from cleavage by miRNA-directed Argonaute activity [42] .

PPMO with Morpholino sequences ranging from 14 to 30 bases were prepared and tested in Vero cells against the virus DENV-2 D2/IC-30PA; PPMOs with Morpholino components of 22-24 bases length most effectively decreased viral titer. When the effect of oligo length on PPMO uptake was tested by flow cytometry of cells treated with PPMOs of 18, 24 or 30 base length bearing fluorescent labels, no effect of length on uptake was shown and PPMOs of all lengths tested entered over 95% of the cells. Toxicology and pharmacokinetic studies on PPMOs were included with this study of antiviral efficacy of Morpholinos and PPMOs against Dengue virus. Dose regimens were tested for toxicity in AG219 mice before being used in separate AG219 mice to assess Dengue inhibition. Pharmacokinetic measurements and additional toxicity tests were done using BALB/c mice [47] . AG219 mice were treated by ip injection with daily doses of 380 \uf06dg of scramble-sequence Morpholino oligo (about 19.1 mg/kg) or 240 \uf06dg of scramble-sequence PPMO (about 12.1 mg/kg) for two days, followed by monitoring over 35 days.

Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution into brain, liver and spleen were determined from measurements at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 8, 12, and 24 hours. Peak plasma concentration was 0.48 mg/L. A distribution half-life of 2.79 h and an elimination half-life of 7.31 h were determined. The liver accumulated the most PPMO-Fl the most rapidly while the brain accumulated the least. Toxicity in Balb/c mice was addressed for a nine dose regimen with daily ip injection of 10 mg/kg fluoresceinated 5'SL 24-mer PPMO. Animals appeared and behaved normally through the nine-day dosing and fiveday washout period. Significant increase in serum cholesterol and decreases in haematocrit, haemoglobin, packed cell volume and red blood cell count were observed during treatment but returned to levels similar to control mice during the washout period. Total bilirubin did not increase during treatment, so treatment likely inhibited red blood cell production instead of increasing red blood cell lysis. The concentrations of fluoresceinated PPMO in liver and spleen did not change significantly over the washout period, demonstrating good retention in tissues after uptake [47] .",

One oligo targeted the start site of viral polymerase subunit PB1 mRNA (PB1-AUG), while another targeted the 3' end of the NP virion RNA (NP-V3'); these were prepared as unmodified Morpholinos and as PPMOs. Intranasal delivery to the lung tissue was shown effective using a scrambled-sequence PPMO conjugated with fluorescein, by which delivery into the lung was shown to be best in the upper lung and closest to the major bronchioles and decreasing through the middle and into the lower lung. Toxicity testing was performed for treatment of up to 7.5 mg/kg administered intranasally once and again 24 hours later. Compared to saline-treated mice, PPMO-treated mice showed no significant weight loss, assessed by daily weighing over the 72 hours following the first dosing, and no observable illness. No significant differences were noted from histopathological examination of lung tissue compared to saline-treated mice. Leukocyte populations in spleen and lungs were followed by flow cytometric analysis; no significant changes in spleen populations were found and lung populations only differed significantly at the highest dose per administration (7.5 mg/kg, with no significant differences at doses of 3.75 mg/kg or less). At 7.5 mg/kg dosing, macrophages increased 2.21 fold and granulocytes increased 3.38 fold. The authors suggest that the arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides may be causing leukocyte infiltration by mimicking a known effect of poly-arginine, which triggers a response similar to major basic protein, a component of the granules of eosinophils [49] .",

Intraperitoneal (ip) injection is the most efficient route to deliver Vivo-Morpholinos to the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles [28] . By intravenous (iv) injection, systemic delivery was achieved in most tissues including liver, small intestine, colon, skeletal muscles, spleen, lung, heart, skin, stomach and kidney but not brain [27, 28] .",

            "text": "The antisense efficacy of Vivo-Morpholinos was demonstrated in several Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) disease animal models [27, 28] . Recent data suggest that the efficacies of Vivo-Morpholinos and PPMOs are similar after local injections in dystrophic dogs (Toshifumi Yokota, personal communication). A Vivo-Morpholino targeting a splice site on the dystrophin mRNA restored Dystrophin protein production in mdx mice [27] . The efficiency of antisense effect was dosage dependent. Vivo-Morpholinos exhibit significantly higher impact on both splice-modified mRNA and protein levels at a dose of 25 mg/kg than at 12.5 mg/kg [27] . A single intravenous injection of 6 mg/kg Vivo-Morpholino spliced out the defect of the dystrophin gene in more than 50% of the skeletal muscle fibers of mdx mice [28] . Repeated injection of 6 mg/kg Vivo-Morpholinos into mdx mice biweekly over 10 weeks restored Dystrophin protein to near normal level in all skeletal muscles tested including biceps, diaphragm, intercostals, tibialis anterior, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and abdominal muscles. Significantly, these injections of Vivo-Morpholinos achieved cardiac delivery and enabled Dystrophin protein production in the heart [28] . Assays of blood markers for liver toxicity (AST,ALT) showed no change of liver function [27] and no significant impact on the body weight or the histology of the liver and kidney [28] . Importantly for potential therapeutic applications, multiple injections of Vivo-Morpholinos did not stimulate an adaptive immune response in mice as determined by ELISA against Vivo-Morpholinos using mouse serum [28] . The potent antisense effect in animals and lack of obvious toxicity at the effective dosage make Vivo-Morpholinos good research reagents for modifying gene expression. The therapeutic index and long term toxicity must be assessed because periodic administration of Vivo-Morpholinos is often required to maintain the antisense effect.",

There have been many attempted but few successful in vivo applications of unmodified Morpholinos in adult animals. Development of Morpholino oligos conjugated to cell-penetrating peptides (PPMO) has made adult animal experiments feasible for Morpholinos. Clinical development of PPMOs on stents to inhibit restenosis after balloon angioplasty is expected to begin imminently and PPMOs are in late preclinical development for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Unlike PPMOs, Vivo-Morpholinos are commercially available as research reagents. Vivo-Morpholinos have been successfully tested in adult animals, providing investigators with convenient access to research-grade delivery-enabled Morpholino antisense.",
