            "text": "Traditional diagnostic assays often lack sensitivity and can be difficult to multiplex across many pathogens. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can overcome some of these problems but has limited application in the detection of low-copynumber pathogens in complex samples. Targeted genome capture (TGC) utilizes oligonucleotide probes to enrich specific nucleic acids in heterogeneous extracts and can therefore increase the proportion of NGS reads for low-abundance targets. While earlier studies have demonstrated the utility of this technology for detection of novel pathogens in human clinical samples, the capacity and practicality of TGC-NGS in a veterinary diagnostic setting have not yet been evaluated. Here we report the use of TGC-NGS assays for the detection and characterization of diverse feline pathogen taxa. We detected 31 pathogens comprising nine pathogen taxa in 28 felid samples analyzed. This included 20 pathogens detected via traditional PCR and 11 additional pathogens that had not been previously detected in the same samples. Most of the pathogens detected were sequenced at sufficient breadth and depth to confidently classify them at the species or subspecies level. Target nucleic acids were enriched from a low of 58-fold to 56 million-fold relative to host nucleic acids. Despite the promising performance of these assays, a number of pathogens detected by conventional PCR or serology were not isolated by TGC-NGS, suggesting that further validation is required before this technology can be used in lieu of quality-controlled standard assays. We conclude that TGC-NGS offers great potential as a broad multiplex pathogen characterization assay in veterinary diagnostic and research settings.",

            "text": "D espite considerable advancements in the characterization of genetic sequence data afforded by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, significant limitations in applying them to the veterinary diagnostic setting remain. NGS can fail to detect low-copy-number pathogens in complex biological samples due to low pathogen/host nucleic acid ratios. For example, if 10% of mammalian cells (approximately 3 \u03eb 10 9 bp per cell) in a blood sample are infected with a pathogen with a 10-kb genome, only 0.000033% of sequences in an NGS output file will be of pathogen origin. Additionally, pathogens isolated from clinical samples often have poor or only partially characterized genomes, can exist as genetically diverse populations within a single individual, or may be present in low abundance due to latency or stage of infection. This combination of small genome size, low relative copy number, and heterogeneous genomic content complicates pathogen detection from complex samples in the context of NGS diagnostic capabilities. For these reasons, virus isolation or culture methods for bacteria and fungi are often required prior to NGS to increase the proportion of on-target reads from clinical samples. These limitations prevent the adoption of NGS as a standard workflow in veterinary diagnostic laboratories.",

Whole DNA extracts (or cDNA converted from RNA) is mixed with predesigned oligonucleotide probes under conditions that maximize hybridization to genetically similar sequences in the extract. Nontarget DNA does not bind to the probes and is subsequently removed, whereas DNA bound to the probes is eluted to achieve a higher concentration of target nucleic acids than was present in the original sample. Targeted genome capture has been used to enrich nucleic acids of interest from complex biological samples. Examples include the concentration of Wolbachia DNA (an intracellular bacteria) from whole-insect DNA extracts (2) and the enrichment of Yersinia pestis DNA from Black Death victims (3) . Additionally, TGC has been recently used by Wylie et al. to demonstrate potential uses in detecting multiple viral taxa from human clinical cases, which represents an important step in adapting TGC technology for diagnostics or pathogen discovery in human samples (4) .",

We screened diverse sample types, including tissue culture fluids, blood, plasma, and swabs previously characterized for multiple pathogens using standard PCR or serological assays. Because some pathogens are common across feline species while others are species specific, we were able to evaluate the performance of these assays across several pathogen-host relationships. We designed two custom probe libraries to evaluate the ability of TGC-NGS to detect DNA and RNA from 10 viral and 1 bacterial taxa. The samples analyzed were derived from in vitro and in vivo sources covering a range of pathogen-to-host genomic ratios, from very low to very high. A bioinformatics pipeline was developed to identify host and pathogen sequences from the NGS output. Assay parameters were varied to assess the impact of probe concentration on enrichment efficiency, and unenriched libraries were analyzed by NGS to qualitatively assess the sensitivity of the NGS pipeline in detecting the presence of pathogens without enrichment.",

Subsequent analysis of tissues from cats with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection documented 5 logs of enrichment that occurred at the TGC processing step. Both DNA and RNA pathogens were detected in this study, although this method was more readily applied to the detection of DNA genomes. We observed poor performance of the assay under the following conditions: (i) samples with low pathogen loads, (ii) poorly preserved samples, or (iii) when pathogens lacked significant homology to probe sequences. We conclude that this approach to detecting and characterizing diverse pathogens from biological samples is a powerful and effective methodology with practical applications in veterinary clinical microbiology.

Here, we have adapted a similar strategy for veterinary clinical and discovery purposes. We have demonstrated the potential for successfully implementing the TGC-NGS approach and have also identified current limitations to widescale application. This is the first application of targeted genome capture and next-generation sequencing as a large multiplex pathogen screening tool for animal pathogens. The custom capture probe libraries we designed include divergent DNA and RNA sequences selected to represent the known diversity of each target pathogen (Table 3; see Table  S1 in the supplemental material). In total, 31 pathogens were detected in 28 samples, including 20 previously characterized pathogens and 11 pathogens that were previously undetected in these samples, despite being subjected to standard diagnostic analyses (Tables 1 and 2 ). The enrichment of pathogen nucleic acids relative to that of the host was as high as 56 million-fold over the starting concentrations. This level of enrichment enabled greater than 50% sequencing breadth for the genomic regions targeted by probes for 27 pathogens, from 13 viral or bacterial species or subspecies that were partially or completely sequenced.",

Analysis of enrichment at each step of the analytical process documented that, as expected, FIVC and host DNA were detected at each step of the protocol, but enrichment occurred following TGC. In contrast, PLVB was detectable in all four samples preenrichment but was not detectable in any of the samples postenrichment, consistent with the lack of PLVB probes in the DNAv2 probe library.

Future TGC designs will include probes targeting a much broader range of pathogen taxa (for example, see reference 4). The assay was also successful at detecting and sequencing pathogens from diverse sample sources, including single and pooled nucleic acid extracts, with up to three pathogens per sample originating from experimental (in vitro and in vivo infections) and clinical (natural infections) samples from different host species. We additionally documented that variations in probe concentration can be optimized to decrease the per sample cost of targeted enrichment. Further, our analysis demonstrates that one probe library can be used to detect pathogens in three different species, providing proof of concept of streamlined diagnostic reagents/protocols for a range of species. With further optimization, and with increasingly more affordable NGS technologies, we feel that this approach can expand the capacity to simultaneously sequence a broad range of pathogens in clinical and research settings and potentially revolutionize veterinary diagnostic analysis.",

The output of these assays is either \"presence versus absence\" data (i.e., real-time PCR) or short sequences that provide little to no information about the diversity of the isolates present. While the percentage of on-target reads was generally low, the breadth and depth of sequencing for target pathogens in most samples in our analysis were much greater than that produced through conventional PCR-based assays. For each of the pathogens detected by our assay, enough of the genome was sequenced to confidently classify pathogens at the species or subspecies level, which is especially valuable for potentially pathogenic organisms that are not part of routine multiplex diagnostic screens (contigs/alignments available upon request). In several cases, fullgenome sequences were produced and sequencing was deep enough to see evidence of intrahost genetic diversity (for example, see Fig. S1 , which demonstrates intrahost diversity in sample 13). TGC-NGS assays could therefore not only function as powerful multiplex diagnostic tools but also produce sequencing output suitable for use in studies on epidemiology, drug resistance, phylogenetics, evolution, and many other fields that utilize molecular data from pathogens. By estimating the relative abundance of host and pathogen nucleic acids pre-and postenrichment, we demonstrated a substantial increase in the pathogen-to-host genomic content of postenrichment samples (Fig. 1B) . Consistent with our expectations, all samples for which enrichment was estimated showed an increase in the relative abundance of target pathogen nucleic acids except for the two unenriched samples. Our RT-PCR data demonstrate that the enrichment was the result of both depletion of host genetic material (negative fold change in GAPDH) and an increase in target pathogen nucleic acids (positive fold change in pathogen DNA/RNA) (Fig. 1A) .",

The full genome of FIVC was sequenced at an average depth of 13,982 reads/base in sample 18 (enriched), while the number of FIVC reads in its paired sample, 18a (unenriched), was below the threshold for detection.

However, in this study, the total number of reads varied widely and the percentage of on-target reads was low for most in vivo samples (Tables 4 and 5 ).

Since TGC-NGS is likely to be able to identify a wide spectrum of pathogens with a single analysis, optimized development of this technology is likely to be within an affordable range in the near future.",

Previous serological results suggested that bobcats in Colorado may be infected with PLV-like and FFV-like viruses known to circulate in other bobcat populations or in sympatric felids (A. Bleiholder and M. Lochelt, unpublished data). Previous attempts to identify these viruses have been unsuccessful, and therefore two samples were included to determine if the TGC-NGS assay could detect divergent or low-copy-number pathogens undetectable by conventional PCR. Although we included diverse PLV and FFV sequences in the capture probe library, we did not detect previously undescribed pathogens using this approach. Two other samples, each containing pooled DNA from two domestic cats with either lymphoma or T-cell leukemia, were also included to search for infectious etiologies for these common feline disease states. Viral pathogens produce clinically similar pathologies in other species, e.g., T-cell leukemia can result from human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection in humans and many species harbor gammaherpesviruses that initiate neoplastic conditions such as lymphomas. This analysis did not reveal pathogen genomes consistent with these hypothesized viral etiologies. It is likely that additional optimization of probes and technical aspects of the process will provide greater resolution of novel pathogens using this technology.",

We also demonstrated that hybridization to targeted capture probes can enrich pathogen nucleic acids up to 56 millionfold relative to host genes and that full genome sequences were retrieved from both clinical and experimental samples from three different host species. A significant number of pathogens were identified that were not readily detected using more traditional veterinary diagnostic technologies, and we documented that bioinformatics analysis alone was not sufficient to detect pathogens from unenriched samples. We identified the limitations of this technology related to very low starting pathogen concentrations and poor sample quality. Optimizing capture probes and implementing stringent quality control measures prior to NGS could enhance the utility of this technology for large-scale diagnostic use. We also recognize that while promising, NGS-based assays such as those described here require more investigation before they can be used in place of traditional diagnostic procedures, and therefore we recommend that laboratories adopting NGS-based assays do so alongside traditional methods until protocols are fully validated.",

The TGC-NGS approach could also be modified for specific research or clinical applications. For example, the number of probes per target pathogen could be increased if the goal is to investigate genetic diversity or rare genetic variants among a small set of pathogens. This may improve the capture efficiency and sequencing depth for each pathogen, enabling analyses into, for example, molecular evolution and intrahost diversity. Alternatively, by targeting only conserved regions of pathogens, instead of full-length genomes, more target pathogens could be included in a single capture probe library, as suggested by others (4). This could allow investigations that \"cast a big net\" when screening for pathogens within individuals or populations and allow for the discovery of unidentified pathogens of importance to the veterinary community.",

This was likely the result of spurious mapping of nonpathogen reads in BWA and contamination during DNA/cDNA library preparation, similar to results recently reported by Wylie et al. (4) . To differentiate true pathogen reads from false-positive reads, we calculated a \"positive threshold value\" by using the number of reads that aligned to pathogen reference sequences in the negative-control samples. The positive threshold value was set at 100 times the proportion of total reads that mapped to each pathogen taxa in the negative-control samples. Thus, a positive threshold value was calculated for each pathogen taxa in each (DNA and RNA) experiment. A sample was considered positive for a given pathogen taxon if the proportion of reads that mapped to the pathogen reference sequences exceeded the positive threshold value for that taxon.",

Two unenriched samples (*) demonstrated an increase of \u05461-fold in the relative abundance of the host GAPDH gene, compared to all of the enriched samples tested, in which GAPDH either decreased or remained approximately the same. One sample (#) was enriched with only half of the recommended capture probes but still demonstrated a depletion of host nucleic acids and an increase in pathogen nucleic acids. All pathogen nucleic acids measured increased in relative abundance postenrichment. Pathogen and host nucleic acids were measured only in samples with sufficient volume remaining before and after sequencing to conduct RT-PCRs.
