The spike glycoprotein (S) of PEDV is the major immunogenic determinant that plays a pivotal role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies against PEDV, which therefore is an ideal target for the development of subunit vaccine. In an attempt to develop a subunit vaccine for PEDV, we cloned two different fragments of S protein and expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion proteins, namely rGST-COE and rGST-S1D, in E.coli. However, the expression of these recombinant protein antigens using a variety of expression vectors, strains, and induction conditions invariably resulted in inclusion bodies. To achieve the soluble expression of recombinant proteins, several chaperone co-expression systems were tested in this study. Results: We firstly tested various chaperone co-expression systems and found that co-expression of trigger factor (TF) with recombinant proteins at 15\u00b0C was most useful in soluble production of rGST-COE and rGST-S1D compared to GroEL-ES and DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE/GroEL-ES systems. The soluble rGST-COE and rGST-S1D were purified using glutathione Sepharose 4B with a yield of 7.5 mg/l and 5 mg/l, respectively. Purified proteins were detected by western blot using mouse anti-GST mAb and pig anti-PEDV immune sera. In an indirect ELISA, purified proteins showed immune reactivity with pig anti-PEDV immune sera. Finally, immunization of mice with 10 \u03bcg of purified proteins elicited highly potent serum IgG and serum neutralizing antibody titers.",

The disease is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and death, with a high mortality rate of more than 90 % in suckling piglets [2] . In the early 1970s, the first case of PED was reported in England [3] . Since then, the disease has spread to Europe and most of the Asian swine raising countries, and severely affected swine industry in Asia [4, 5] . In 2013, PED suddenly occurred in the United States and rapidly spread across the country [6] , as well as neighboring countries [7, 8] , and subsequently in Asian countries including South Korea [9] , Japan and Taiwan [10] , and led to significant economic losses in the global swine industry [11] .

            "text": "A coronavirus named porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was identified as the causative agent of PED in the late 1970s [2] . The virus possesses four structural proteins including 150-220 kDa spike (S) glycoprotein, 7 kDa envelop (E) protein, 20-30 kDa membrane (M) protein and 58 kDa neucleocapsid (N) protein [12] . The S protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein localized on the virion surface, which can be divided into the S1 (aa 1-789) domain and S2 (aa 790-1383) domain [13, 14] . The S protein plays a pivotal role in the cellular receptor binding, viral fusion, and most importantly in the induction of neutralizing antibodies [15, 16] . A neutralizing epitope region, COE (aa 499-638), corresponds to the neutralizing epitope of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was identified based on the nucleotide sequence homology analysis [17] . Subsequently, a novel neutralizing epitope region S1D (aa 636-789) on the S1 domain was reported to have the capacity to induce neutralizing antibodies against PEDV [13] . In addition, a B-cell epitope 2C10 (aa 1,368-1,374) on the S2 domain was also reported to induce neutralizing antibodies [18] . Therefore, spike protein is considered as a primary target for the development of subunit vaccine against PEDV.",

Despite absence of post-translational modifications (such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and glycosylation), expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli has many significant benefits over other expression systems in terms of cost, ease-of-use, and scale [21] . However, recombinant protein overexpression in E.coli often leads to the misfolding of the protein of interest into biologically inactive aggregates known as inclusion bodies (IBs) [22] . Various expression approaches have been suggested to prevent IBs formation, including utilization of solubility enhancing tag, lowering induction temperature, modulating inducer concentration and changing specialized expression hosts [23] . Moreover, many refolding methods have also been explored for the recovery of soluble proteins from purified IBs [24, 25] . However, these approaches are not always effective, since even the most robust protocols only refold a small fraction of the input protein, and it is difficult to purify the refolded fraction [26] . As an alternative strategy, chaperone co-expression strategies have been proposed to facilitate soluble expression of recombinant proteins with success for many different types of proteins [27] [28] [29] . Chaperones are complex molecular machinery that assists the folding of newly synthesized proteins to the native state and provide a quality control system that refolds misfolded and aggregated proteins [30, 31] . In the E.coli cytosol, a ribosome-associated folding catalyst known as trigger factor and molecular chaperone teams such as the DanK-DnaJ-GrpE and the GroEL-GroES are profoundly involved in the folding and refolding process [32] [33] [34] [35] .",

Therefore, we decided to test the effect of chaperone systems, such as trigger factor (TF), GroEL-ES, DnaKJE/GroEL-ES and GroEL-ES/TF, on the production of soluble rGST-COE and rGST-S1D. The pG-COE and pG-S1D expression plasmids were transformed in to the E.coli BL21, BL21/pTF16, BL21/pGro7, BL21/pG-KJE8 and BL21/pG-Tf2 chaperone competent cells. As shown in Fig. 1 , we found that co-expression of TF with recombinant proteins at 15\u00b0C was most useful in soluble production of rGST-COE and rGST-S1D compared to other chaperone combinations (Fig. 1) . Majority of the recombinant proteins were presented in insoluble fraction when expressed alone, while co-expression of recombinant proteins with TF resulted in up to 84 % soluble fraction for the rGST-COE, and 41 % for the rGST-S1D compared to 19~30 % of other chaperone systems. Total amount of recombinant proteins expressed were decreased to 40~50 % value of no chaperone induction. Interestingly, TF system is a cold shock chaperone, while the GroEL-ES and the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE systems belong to the heat shock chaperones and the ratios of chaperone combinations are critical in the folding or refolding process [30, 37] . In this study as we used commercial system, the ratios of chaperones or other conditions were not optimized for the PEDV antigen expression. Nonetheless, TF system is simple and most effective among the tested conditions for the soluble expression of PEDV antigens and do not require co-chaperones or ATP as compared to the GroEL-ES and the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE systems.",

Chaperone proteins were induced at 37\u00b0C by adding L-arabinose (0.5 mg/ml) or tetracycline (10 ng/ml) prior to the expression of recombinant proteins. Target proteins were induced by adding 0.1 mM IPTG at 15\u00b0C for 24 h. Soluble (S) and insoluble (I) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The protein bands for rGST-COE, rGST-S1D and chaperone proteins are indicated on the right side of the gel. Lanes: control, no chaperone; +TF, co-expression with trigger factor; +Gro, co-expression with GroEL-GroES complex; +G-KJE: co-expression with DnaKJE/GroEL-GroES complex by regulating induction temperature, IPTG concentration, OD at induction and harvest time. The rate of expression and culture temperature can affect the proper folding and IBs formation of most recombinant proteins [40] [41] [42] . In order to determine the optimal induction temperature, rGST-COE was induced at different temperatures (15, 21, 28 and 37\u00b0C), while TF was induced with L-arabinose from the culture start. SDS-PAGE results showed that optimal temperature for soluble rGST-COE expression was 15\u00b0C, as the solubility of rGST-COE was increased progressively as temperature decreased from 37\u00b0C to 15\u00b0C. (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). Interestingly, the expression level of TF was also increased as the temperature decreased. Indeed, it has been reported that TF, unlike other chaperones in E.coli, is a cold-shock chaperone which was induced at low temperature [37] . Our data suggest that the improved solubility of rGST-COE at low temperature may be attributed to the elevated expression level of TF, but not duo to the reduction of expression rate at low temperature.",

The soluble fraction obtained after cell lysis and centrifugation was loaded on the column pre-equilibrated with buffer A (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 1.8 mM KH2PO4 at pH 7.3). The column was washed successively with buffer A. The bound proteins were eluted using buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM glutathione at pH 8.0) and fractions containing purified proteins were collected and the purity of the protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ). When determined by Bradford assay, the yield of purified soluble rGST-COE and rGST-S1D in flask culture were 7.5 mg/l and 5 mg/l, respectively. The purity of the pooled fractions was >90 % and we used them without further purification. 1 \u03bcg of purified proteins were separated in the SDS-PAGE (Additional file 1: Figure S3 ), and target proteins were detected using mouse anti-GST monoclonal antibody and pig anti-sera against commercial PEDV live attenuated vaccine in a western blot analysis (Fig. 4) . The rGST protein was included as a control for the western blot analysis. No clear bands were detected with pre-immune sera used as a control in western blot (data not shown). Pig anti-PEDV immune sera showed weak signal, high background and some non-specific reactivity in western blot (Fig. 4b) compared to the ELISA result (Fig. 6 ). It seems that those two results are not matching to some extent. But, it may be possible to get those results, because the pig anti-PEDV sera was raised against live attenuated virus, which contained polyclonal antibodies recognizing both conformational and linear epitopes on the native PEDV spike protein. Therefore, the pig anti-PEDV sera could detect both conformational and linear epitopes on rGST-COE and rGST-S1D in an ELISA assay, while pig anti-PEDV sera could react only with linear epitopes on denatured rGST-COE and rGST-S1D in a western blot. In this context, it is possible that the reaction in ELISA was much stronger than in western blot.",

The soluble rGST-COE and rGST-S1D were purified and detected by western blot using mouse anti-GST mAb and pig anti-PEDV immune sera, and showed dominant immune reactivity with pig anti-PEDV immune sera in an indirect ELISA assay. Finally, immunization of mice with 10 \u03bcg of purified proteins elicited highly potent serum IgG and serum neutralizing antibody titers.

The COE and S1D fragments based on the nucleotide sequence of spike protein of PEDV CV777 strain (GenBank Acc.

For the western blot assay, proteins after SDS-PAGE run were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, USA) in a Mini Trans-Blot system (BioRad, USA). Then the membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline/0.1 % Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5 % skim milk (BD/Difco, NJ, USA) for 1 h and probed with mouse anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Genscript, USA) and pig anti-sera against PEDV in TBST at 1:1000 and 1:500 dilutions, respectively, for 1 h both at room temperature. HRP-conjugated goat antimouse IgG (MerckMillipore, Germany) and goat antiporcine IgG (KPL, USA) diluted at 1:5000 were used as secondary antibody. Detection was carried out using an ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare, Sweden).",
