In this paper, a rapid ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array detector and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS) method was established for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the major constituents of LQC. A total of 61 compounds including flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, anthraquinones, triterpenoids, iridoids, and other types of compounds were unambiguously or tentatively identified by comparing the retention times and accurate mass measurement with reference compounds or literature data. Among them, twelve representative compounds were further quantified as chemical markers in quantitative analysis, including salidroside, chlorogenic acid, forsythoside E, cryptochlorogenic acid, amygdalin, sweroside, hyperin, rutin, forsythoside A, phillyrin, rhein, and glycyrrhizic acid. The UPLC-DAD method was evaluated with linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, stability, repeatability, and recovery tests. The results showed that the developed quantitative method was linear, sensitive, and precise for the quality control of LQC.",

LQC is composed of 11 herbs including Fructus Forsythiae (Lianqiao), Flos Lonicerae Japonicae (Jinyinhua), Herba Ephedrae (Mahuang), Semen Armeniacae Amarum (Kuxingren), Radix Isatidis (Banlangen), Rhizoma Dryopteridis Crassirhizomatis (Mianmaguanzhong), Herba Houttuyniae (Yuxingcao), Herba Pogostemonis (Guanghuoxiang), Radix et Rhizoma Rhei (Dahuang), Radix et Rhizoma Rhodiolae Crenulatae (Hongjingtian), and Radix et Rhizoma Glycyrrhizae (Gancao), along with menthol and a traditional Chinese mineral medicine, Gypsum Fibrosum (Shigao). According to previous reports, LQC has a good clinical effect on influenza with the symptoms of high fever, aversion to cold, headache, pharyngalgia, cough, sneezing, muscle ache, and so on [3] . Modern pharmacological studies have shown that LQC also has the antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activities [4, 5] . Recently, the study on its bioactive ingredients and molecular mechanism of action has been gradually reported as well [6] .",

For intraday and interday precisions test, the samples were analyzed by six repetitive injections within one day and once a day for three successive days, respectively. At room temperature, the stability of sample solution was evaluated by replicate injection at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 24, and 48 h. In order to check the repeatability, six samples from the same source were investigated. Accurate amounts of the reference standards were added to 0.20 g powder of sample in sextuplicate. The resultant sample solutions were then extracted and quantified with the described method. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was used to evaluate the results.",

In our study, the chemical profile of LQC was thoroughly and systematically investigated by UPLC-DAD-QTOF-MS for the first time. Sixty-one compounds were unambiguously or tentatively identified. Based on the qualitative analysis, a UPLC-DAD method was established for quantitative analysis of 12 representative compounds in LQC, which has been demonstrated to be effective for the analysis of 10 batches of LQC. This developed method could be applied as an effective quality control procedure for LQC.

Lignans primarily generated [M+HCOO] \u2212 in negative ion mode and further elimination of glucose (162 Da) produced aglycone. As shown in Figure 4(e), compound 39 produced characteristic fragments at m/z 371.1826 and m/z 356.1547 corresponding to [M-H-Glc (glucose)] \u2212 and [M-H-Glc-CH 3 ] \u2212 , respectively. Compounds 16, 18, 19, 28, 32, 38, and 56 were tentatively identified on the basis of the exact molecular formulae matching, fragmentation information, and retention behaviors as well as literature data [23, 24, 33, 36, 47]. 3.2.3. Anthraquinones. Eight anthraquinones (Figure 3(c)) in LQC were definitely or tentatively identified. All of them were derived from Dahuang. Chrysophanol glucoside (17), emodin-8-O-glucoside (45), rhein (54), and emodin (61) were confirmed via comparing with standard substances. The characteristic fragmentation behavior of anthraquinones was the loss of CO 2 (44 Da), CH 3 (15 Da), and CO (28 Da) in negative ion mode. Typical compound 61 was used to explain the fragmentation pathway of anthraquinones presented in Figure 4(f). Compound 45, as shown in Figure 4(g), produced characteristic fragments at m/z 269.0673, m/z 241.0719, m/z 225.0753, m/z 197.0771, and m/z 182.0486 which corresponded to [M-H-Glc] \u2212 , [M-H-Glc-CO] \u2212 , [M-H-Glc-CO 2 ] \u2212 , [M-H-CO-CO 2 ] \u2212 , and [M-H-CO 2 -CH 3 -CO] \u2212 , respectively.

Eight triterpenoids (Figure 3(d)) in LQC were unambiguously or tentatively identified. All of them were derived from Gancao. Glycyrrhizic acid (57) was confirmed by comparing with standards. In negative ion mode, representative compound 57 yielded [M-H-H 2 O-CO 2 ] \u2212 at m/z 759.4524, [M-H-GlcA (glucuronic acid)] \u2212 at m/z 645.4102, [M-H-2GlcA] \u2212 at m/z 469.3705, [2GlcA-H] \u2212 at m/z 351.0809, and [2GlcA-H-H 2 O-CO 2 ] \u2212 at m/z 289.0758, as shown inFigure 4(h).
