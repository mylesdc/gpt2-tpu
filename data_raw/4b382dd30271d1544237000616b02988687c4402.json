However, lack of a suitable animal model for EV-D68 infection has limited the study on the pathogenesis of this critical pathogen, and the development of a vaccine. Ferrets have been widely used to evaluate respiratory virus infections. In the current study, we used EV-D68-infected ferrets as a potential animal to identify impersonal indices, involving clinical features and histopathological changes in the upper and lower respiratory tract (URT and LRT). The research results demonstrate that the EV-D68 virus leads to minimal clinical symptoms in ferrets. According to the viral load detection in the feces, nasal, and respiratory tracts, the infection and shedding of EV-D68 in the ferret model was confirmed, and these results were supported by the EV-D68 VP1 immunofluorescence confocal imaging with \u03b12,6-linked sialic acid (SA) in lung tissues. Furthermore, we detected the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression level, which implied high expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1a, IL-8, IL-5, IL-12, IL-13, and IL-17a in the lungs. These data indicate that systemic observation of responses following infection with EV-D68 in ferrets could be used as a model for EV-D68 infection and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Recently, there have been many epidemiological studies reporting on the continuous circulation and infection of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) [1, 2] . This virus is associated with severe diseases, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and central nervous system (CNS) clinical signs [3] [4] [5] , and identifying the virulence factors contributing to these manifestations has been the focus of many recent studies [6, 7] . EV-D68 was first identified in California in 1962. However, EV-D remains a poorly characterized species of the family Picornaviridae [8] . Notably, the mechanisms leading to increased pathogenesis of EV-D68, particularly the tropism infection in the human upper and lower respiratory tract, remain to be discovered. Clinical data has shown that pathology in the patients' lower respiratory tract (LRT) are mainly featured by serious respiratory diseases in children and acute flaccid myelitis [9, 10] . Some studies have shown that the most important pathway of EV-D68 infection is the respiratory tract by binding sialic acid on the membrane [11, 12] , but the shedding of the virus from the upper respiratory tracts and the early immune response of patient cytokine secretions and excretions have not been well documented. In translational medicine research, the cotton rat models for studying the infection and transfer of EV-D68 can be helpful for characterizing the behavior of the virus as well as physiological responses to it [13] . However, the use of cotton rat-adapted EV-D68 strains for direct intranasal or intraperitoneal inoculation cannot mimic the natural route of infection in humans.",

            "text": "It is well documented that the sialic acid on the surface of respiratory tract can mediate influenza viral receptor binding protein attachment, which is believed to be an important determinant in tissue tropism of this virus [14] .For instance, hemagglutinin (HA) of human influenza viruses have a binding preference for \u03b12,6-linked sialic acids (SAs) dominated in upper respiratory tract (URT), supposedly indicating the pathology characteristics in the upper respiratory tract [15] . As an animal model, the domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo) is a conventional model for studying the pathogenesis of viral respiratory infection, including influenza and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, because there is no need for virus adaptation [16] . Advantageously, ferrets exhibit a similar distribution of sialic acid in respiratory tract as in humans [8, 14, 17, 18] . Due to the respiratory-infecting characteristics of EV-D68 in humans, the infection efficiency of the virus in ferrets could be a key animal model for conducting studies of the EV-D68 infection mechanisms and immune responses via the respiratory tract. In this study, we focused on determining whether or not ferrets have the potential to serve as a small animal model for EV-D68. A nose aerosol spray was used to induce EV-D68 infection in a ferret model, and serial nasal, throat, and feces samples were collected from the ferrets during and after EV-D68 infection. The pathological changes and expressive levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines in URT and LRT of ferrets correlated with viral shedding. These results could be useful supporting data for the evaluation of EV-D68-induced manifestations. Collectively, these data provide the rationale to assess the utility of the ferret as a model for EV-D68 infection.",

Ferret experiments were conducted, and a total of 18 male ferrets (weight: 800-1000 g) were used in this study. Serum samples from the ferrets were tested by neutralization assay to ensure seronegativity for EV-D68 before the experiments. Fifteen ferrets were infected with 10 4.5 50% cell culture infectious doses (CCID 50 ) of EV-D68 via the nostrils dropwise, three ferrets of which were included for immune evaluation. Three ferrets used as mock controls were inoculated with 0.5 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). All ferrets were housed in a high-efficiency particulate air-filtered individual isolation unit in an Animal Biosafety Level 2-enhanced (ABSL-2+) facility, which complied with the requirements for ferret housing, environment, and comfort as described in the Guide for Laboratory Animals Care issued by the Institute of Medical Biology.",

In addition, several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that EV-D68 is associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection and central nervous system (CNS) pathogenicity, including acute focal limb weakness, paralysis, and acute cranial nerve dysfunction [4, 27, 30] . In our research, the partial VP1 gene (120 nt) was detected using RT-PCR analysis with sequence-specific primers and probes in the feces, nasal washes, throat swabs, blood, lung, BALF, trachea, and CNS samples that were collected at different times post-infection from the ferrets. The virus was detected in the feces and nasal washes from the third day post-infection, and a peak level of over 70,000 copies per 100 mg sample (Figure 2A) , was reached on the fifth day, and 90,000 copies per 1 mL of nasal wash ( Figure 2B ) was detected on the ninth day, but no virus was detected in the throat swabs ( Figure 2C ). For viremia of EV-D68 infection, the viral load in blood samples is less than 50 copies/mL ( Figure 2D ). Several studies have indicated that the enterovirus invasion lead to a transient minor viremia that delivers the virus to lymphoid tissues [31] . In this study, the virus replication in the axillary lymph nodes was detected at five and seven days post-infection. With levels of 18,000-50,000 copies per 100 mg of tissue ( Figure 2E ). To measure the profile of virus replication in lower respiratory systems, the EV-D68 virus was detected in lung, trachea, and BALF. Infectious viruses were detectable from three to seven days post-infection. With a peak level of 89,000 copies per 100 mg of lung tissue on the fifth day post-infection ( Figure 2F ). However, viral load in BALF and in the trachea was less than 40 copies/mL ( Figure S2A ,B). Detection of EV-D68 Fermon strain was negative in CNS (including brain, midbrain, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata) ( Figure S2C ). Although some clinical results report that there is a possible association between EV-D68 and neurological disease, we did not observe the central nervous system symptoms in ferrets [4] , which was in accordance with Schieble's experimental result from sucking mice by inoculation with four strains of EV-D68, in which CNS impairments were observed only in mice infected with the Rhyne strain-not in Fermon, Franklin, and Robison strains [32] . weakness, paralysis, and acute cranial nerve dysfunction [4, 27, 30] .

In this study, the tissue samples from the trachea and lungs were histopathologically examined in order to observe the pathological change of the respiratory apparatus from the ferret infected with the EV-D68. Inflammation and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage were found in lungs where the viral load level was very high from EV-D68-inoculated ferrets on three and seven days post-infection ( Figure 3A ), but there were no pathological changes in the trachea ( Figure 3B ). These findings suggest that ferret infection might have a remarkable pathogenesis in the lower respiratory tract at three to seven days post-infection ( Figure 3A ). At the same time, immunolabeling of the VP1 antigen was observed in lung cells around the pulmonary alveolus cells (Figure3C) , while VP1 antigen is undetectable in the trachea ( Figure 3D ). Together with the virus detection and histopathological analyses of the lung tissues, all EV-D68-infectedanimals likely demonstrated pulmonary manifestations at three to seven days post-infection. ",

In this study, the tissue samples from the trachea and lungs were histopathologically examined in order to observe the pathological change of the respiratory apparatus from the ferret infected with the EV-D68. Inflammation and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage were found in lungs where the viral load level was very high from EV-D68-inoculated ferrets on three and seven days postinfection ( Figure 3A ), but there were no pathological changes in the trachea ( Figure 3B ). These findings suggest that ferret infection might have a remarkable pathogenesis in the lower respiratory tract at three to seven days post-infection ( Figure 3A ). At the same time, immunolabeling of the VP1 antigen was observed in lung cells around the pulmonary alveolus cells (Figure3C), while VP1 antigen is undetectable in the trachea ( Figure 3D ). Together with the virus detection and histopathological analyses of the lung tissues, all EV-D68-infectedanimals likely demonstrated pulmonary manifestations at three to seven days post-infection. ",
