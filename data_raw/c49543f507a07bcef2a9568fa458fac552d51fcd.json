In this study we describe for the first time the generation of HCoV-NL63 VLPs using baculovirus system. Major structural proteins of HCoV-NL63 have been expressed in tagged or native form, and their assembly to form VLPs was evaluated. Additionally, a novel procedure for chromatography purification of HCoV-NL63 VLPs was developed. Interestingly, we show that these nanoparticles may deliver cargo and selectively transduce cells expressing the ACE2 protein such as ciliated cells of the respiratory tract. Production of a specific delivery vector is a major challenge for research concerning targeting molecules. The obtained results show that HCoV-NL63 VLPs may be efficiently produced, purified, modified and serve as a delivery platform. This study constitutes an important basis for further development of a promising viral vector displaying narrow tissue tropism. mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [9-13], avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [14] , porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [15, 16] and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) [17] .",

The propitious property of being tailorable and non-infectious renders VLPs a handy tool for studying not only requirements for efficient trafficking, assembly and release of viral particles, but also interactions with cellular receptors. Numerous studies using coronaviral like particles provided valuable data on structure of SARS [6, 8, 18] , MHV [9, 10, 12, 13, 19] , IBV [14] and TGEV [16] . The second branch of VLP investigation focuses on their use as vaccine candidates. Due to the repetitive exposition of surface antigens and their particulate structure, VLPs interact with the immune system similarly to native viruses, inducing humoral and cellular responses. Production of protective antibody titers, as well as induction of cell-mediated immunity induced by VLPs have been shown for animal and human coronaviruses, such as IBV [20, 21] , PEDV [17], TGEV [15], SARS [22, 23] and recently for middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS--CoV) [24, 25] .",

            "text": "In this work we describe the design, production and characterization of VLPs based on structural proteins of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63). HCoV-NL63 is a wide-spread virus, causing infections of the lower and upper respiratory tract of varying severity [26] . The HCoV-NL63 virion is composed of membrane (M), envelope (E) and protruding spike (S) proteins, all three shaping the membrane to form the envelope protecting ribonucleocapsid [27] . Recently also ORF3 protein was identified as structural protein of HCoV-NL63, yet its function remains to be elucidated [28] . M is relatively small protein (26 kDa), which spans the viral membrane three or four times. It is essential for virus assembly and budding, as it forms the membrane curvature and interacts with the ribonucleoprotein and other structural proteins (E and S) [29] . E protein (9 kDa) is also engaged in virus assembly and egress [30, 31] . S protein (150 kDa) is anchored in the viral envelope by its C-terminal part, while its large ectodomain trimerize and forms characteristic spikes at the virion's surface [32] . S protein is responsible for receptor binding and virus entry into host cells [33] . HCoV-NL63 infects exclusively ciliated cells of human respiratory epithelium and for the penetration of the cell it requires interaction between spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [34] . This narrow specificity and tropism to respiratory tissue render HCoV-NL63 an interesting basis for development of VLPs, that have not been described yet.",

Formed by structural viral proteins which have an inherent property for self-assembly, these structures not only mimic the morphology of the native virus but can also transduce permissive cells. Devoid of viral genetic material, VLPs do not replicate within the host cell, but can be used as carriers for nucleic acids, proteins or drugs. Numerous studies have demonstrated that VLPs originating from different viral species may be produced using eukaryotic expression systems (reviewed in [1] [2] [3] ). Coronaviruses-enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause common respiratory diseases in humans and a broad variety of diseases in animals are also able to form such structures. Successful production of coronavirus-like particles has been reported for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , LLC-Mk2 cells (Macaca mulatta kidney epithelial cells, ATCC: CCL-7) were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM; two parts Hanks' MEM and one part Earle's MEM, Ther-moFisher Scientific, Poland) supplemented with 3% FBS 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 5 \u03bcg/ml ciprofloxacin.

For that, recombinant baculoviruses coding for M, E and S proteins of HCoV-NL63 were created. Additionally, M and E protein tagged with HA peptide and S protein fused with GFP were engineered. All sequences were codon-optimized for the expression in insect cells, synthesized and sub-cloned to one bicistronic or two monocistronic separate donor plasmids for more flexible regulation of protein expression [S1 Fig]. After isolation of rBVs, HF cells were infected at MOI 1 and cultures were harvested at different times post infection, to screen for the best expression conditions. Expression of the E protein was sufficient to be detected by Coomassie staining of the SDS-PAGE gel. Respective bands were visible in cell lysates collected 48, 72 and 96 hours p.i. [Fig 1a] . The M and the S proteins were more elusive, and their expression could only be confirmed by Western blot [Fig 1b and 1c] .",

We have thus aimed to optimize the temperature and buffer content for preparation of the M protein for SDS-PAGE analysis [Fig 3c] . Although eliminating thermal aggregation, we could still detect several bands with anti-membrane antibody, most likely resulting from incomplete protein denaturation or the presence of differentially glycosylated M protein forms. To address this, we treated samples with glycosidases, what caused disappearance of the upper band, proving that at least a part of M protein was glycosylated [Fig 3b] .

Obtained results were promising, but to assess the specificity of the process we tested whether VLPs are also internalized into cells deprived of the natural receptor-ACE2, as we have previously shown, that this is not the case for the virus [50] . For this, LLC-Mk2 cells were pre-treated with PMA, known to deplete ACE2 from the cell surface [36, 37, 50] and incubated with the obtained VLPs and analyzed by confocal microscopy.

To address this, we used HA-tagged VLPs decorated with anti-HA tag antibodies for two reasons: contrary to anti-M and anti-S polyclonal sera the anti-HA antibody is monoclonal and thus specificity of the VLP-antibody formation is higher and secondly, attaching a heterologous moiety to M or S protein could obstruct receptor interacting domains and thus inhibit VLPs' cell penetration. To ensure complex formation (M-HA + E) + S VLPs were pre-incubated with different amounts of anti-HA antibody and then overlaid on LLC-Mk2 cells. Simultaneously, control cells were incubated with the same amount of the anti-HA antibody, to rule out the possibility of VLP-independent internalization. The cargo internalization was evaluated with a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody and visualized with confocal microscopy [Fig 8a-8d] . A signal was clearly detected only in preparations were VLPs were present, making evidence that HCoV-NL63 VLPs not only efficiently transduce model target cells, but may also serve as carriers for relatively large proteins. To further analyze if antibody delivery to target cells is dose-dependent, we performed an in cell ELISA. HA-tagged VLPs were pre-incubated with various amounts of anti-HA antibody, serially diluted and overlaid on LLC-Mk2 cells in a microtiter plate. The relative amount of the transduced anti-HA antibody was assessed using the standard ELISA protocol. As depicted in This result is a proof of concept for the development of the HCoV-NL63 VLP as a protein delivery platform.",

By co-expression of the M, E and S proteins we have obtained functional particles displaying a typical corona-like structure. Minimal protein requirement for coronaviral particle assembly is controversial (summarized in S2 Table) . Some groups postulate that M and E proteins are sufficient for formation of VLPs [4, 5, 9] , whereas others report the critical role of the N protein in this process [8, 51] . Obtained results suggests that unlike most other enveloped RNA viruses, coronaviruses employ a nucleocapsidindependent strategy to drive assembly and budding, but the stabilizing role of this protein cannot be excluded [6, 9, 12] . The combination of proteins essential for VLPs formation seem to also depend on the viral species and the expression system used.",

S protein was incorporated to VLPs when present, but we did not observe its effect on VLP expression level or stability, what is consistent with reports concerning other coronaviruses (reviewed in [53] ). Further, we also investigated the formation and secretion of tagged HCoV-NL63 VLPs. Interestingly, we found that HA peptide tagged M protein was still assembly competent and the (M-HA + E) + S VLPs were functional but were not released from producer cells. It should be pointed out that HA peptide was fused to the C terminus of the M protein, which is considered to be the essential for M-M interaction and VLP assembly [10, 12, 18, 29, 54, 55] . Several groups reported that deletion, substitution or extension of the C terminus of the M protein affects interaction with other proteins [6, 8, 18, [56] [57] [58] . M protein of most coronaviral species exposes its N-terminus outside the virion, whereas the C-terminal tail is hidden inside the particle (N exo -C endo orientation). Only TEGV M protein was shown to adopt two topologies: N exo -C endo and N exo -C exo orientation [59] . Accordingly, assembly of TEGV VLP containing M protein with HA tag fused to the C terminus has been reported [16] . Topology of the HCoV-NL63 M protein has not been assessed yet, but one may assume that alphacoronaviral M proteins may adopt N exo -C exo topology allowing for Cterminal modification. Here we show successful VLP-mediated delivery of the tag-specific antibody directed to the HA-tag fused to the C terminus of the M protein, what supports this assumption.",

Most of the alternative purification methods are based on size-exclusion column purification [60] [61] [62] . A limitation of this approach is that a relatively low amount of material can be loaded onto a size-exclusion column. Based on our previous finding that heparan sulfate serves as an attachment receptor for HCoV-NL63 [50] , we reasoned that HCoV-NL63 VLPs may bind to a heparin column. Moreover, heparin can act as a weak cation exchanger and it was shown to interact with a number of viruses [63] [64] [65] . Employment of the heparin column was successful and allowed for partial purification of HCoV-NL63 VLPs. The quality of preparation was high, but unfortunately BVs co-purified with VLPs (data not shown). This observation is in agreement with known BVs affinity for heparin columns [66] . However, this problem was solved by further fractionation using monolith ion exchange column. Even though the yield of the whole procedure could not be calculated for the analytical scale preparation, this two-step chromatography purification method was validated by verifying transducing capacities of the purified VLPs and thus confirming their integrity. Considering the obtained results, the described protocol seems to be an attractive option for VLPs that are burdensome for ultracentrifugation.",

            "text": "Last but not least, one of the main reasons for development of HCoV-NL63 VLPs was to create a vector that exhibits a narrow tissue tropism. HCoV-NL63 VLPs is a good candidate, as the parental virus infects only ciliated cells of the human airway epithelium expressing the ACE2 protein. Even though numerous works describe successful production of SARS based VLPs potentially displaying the same tropism, only one study shows that SARS VLP cell entry is mediated by ACE2 [67] . Here, we demonstrated that HCoV-NL63 VLPs not only penetrate human airway epithelium, but also that the presence of the ACE2 receptor on cell surface is a pre-requisite for the internalization. Further, we provided evidence that HCoV-NL63 VLPs can serve as a carrier for heterologous proteins such as antibodies. We have shown that developed VLPs may serve as a carrier for antibodies, similarly as previously described by Fender and colleagues for adenovirus-like particle mediated antibody delivery to HeLa cells [68] . We also attempted to anchor the cargo protein inside the VLP, by fusion of the GFP tag to the Cterminus of the S protein. The feasibility of such vector modification was described for MHV [69] . Unfortunately, HCoV-NL63 S-GFP proteins were not incorporated into VLPs, as no colocalization with M protein was observed. It is conceivable that a C-terminally fused tag may hinder M-S interactions or alter S subcellular localization and further studies are required.",
