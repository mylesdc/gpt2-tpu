It is of great importance for network science and health control to understand the impact of frequent journeys on epidemics. We stress that a new framework of modelling that takes a traveller's viewpoint is needed. Such integrated travel network (ITN) model should incorporate the diversity among links as dictated by the distances between cities and different speeds of different modes of transportation, diversity among nodes as dictated by the population and the ease of travelling due to infrastructures and economic development of a city, and round-trip journeys to targeted destinations via the paths of shortest travel times typical of human journeys. An example is constructed for 116 cities in China with populations over one million that are connected by high-speed train services and highways. Epidemic spread on the constructed network is studied. It is revealed both numerically and theoretically that the traveling speed and frequency are important factors of epidemic spreading. Depending on the infection rate, increasing the traveling speed would result in either an enhanced or suppressed epidemic, while increasing the traveling frequency enhances the epidemic spreading.",

In network science, much effort and progress has been made on understanding epidemics in single-layered networks 1-20 and multi-layered networks 21-28 . In single-layered static networks with an immobile agent at each node, for example, no finite epidemic threshold exists for scale-free (SF) networks and a tiny initial infection eventually spreads 11 . A delicate balance between the number of high degree nodes and the topological distance between them 29 is shown to be crucial. The same result holds for reaction-diffusion models with random diffusion of agents among nodes with infections only among the agents momentarily on the same node 6 . Recently, how human dynamics affects an epidemic has become the focus of research 14,18,30-33 , but the diversity of links and the time spending on journeys are largely ignored. Real-life networks, e.g. power grids and the internet, are often multi-layered networks 34,35 , with their mutual influence and cascades being hot research topics 36, 37 . Epidemics in two-layered networks also received much attention [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] , and the layer for infection processes actually shares the same set of nodes with the layer for information exchanges.",

There exist many single and multi-layered transportation network models 38-43 , with the layers representing networks of airports, railways, highways, etc. coupled together. To incorporate epidemics, however, random diffusion of people on such networks will be an oversimplification, as a journey involves a planned route to a destination using mixed modes of transportation.

These inter-city travels readily spread a disease to different places. However, the big populations in major cities and densely packed travellers on multiple means of transportation of various speeds add further complications. A reliable framework for studying the effects of travelling on epidemics has yet to be constructed. Earlier works on epidemics in airport and railway networks often modelled journeys as random diffusion of agents 4, 5, 45 . The obvious shortcomings are: (i) real journeys typically involve multiple means of transportation instead of agents all travelling the same way; (ii) neighboring stations have different distances that affect the chance of infection instead of identical distance between adjacent nodes; (iii) real journeys are round-trip with an destination instead of random diffusion. It should be noted that intra-city travel is also inhomogeneous. It is, therefore, of fundamental importance to construct a framework incorporating the differences in travelling means and distances between cities. We propose here such a framework to incorporate inhomogeneity among the links and round-trip journeys with intended destination. It is found that infections at the links greatly affect the epidemic threshold, and the traveling speed and frequency are key factors in determining the extent of an epidemic.",

The ITN aims to incorporate the key features of how human travel, namely round-trip journeys of shortest time through multiple means of transportation. Here, we invoke the travel time, which depends on the distance and the means of transportation, as the key factor, instead of the effective distance 43 . Instead of emphasizing the multi-layered network structure as in previous works, ITN takes a traveller's viewpoint that journeys take place in a single-layered undetachable network with a diversity of links connecting cities representing an inhomogeneous transportation network, see Methods for details. It aims to provide a step closer to a realistic description of human journeys and an alternative platform for studying epidemics on which finer and further details on local area transportation could be added.",

Sensitivity to the choice of measuring populations in lots of 5000 is tested in Fig. S2 and follows the path of shortest travel time. An agent typically travels on slower transportation in the local area before transferring to high-speed train followed by local transportation to the destination. ITN captures the inhomogeneous means of travelling better than multi-layered networks. An agent spends some time at the destination before the return trip begins, which is taken to be 5 time steps corresponding to 5 hours 50, 51 .

We illustrated the key ideas by presenting an integrated travel network constructed by considering geographic data, population data and transportation infrastructures in China. An example using only the high-speed trains and highways among the 116 cities of over a million population suffices for stressing the points. An ITN should include: (i) diversity among the links due to different distances and different speeds of transportation; (ii) diversity among the cities due to different population sizes, and transportation services often reflecting their economic growth; (iii) round-trip Scientific RepoRts | 5:11401 | DOi: 10.1038/srep11401 journeys to targeted destination via paths of shortest time; and (iv) different infection rates for travellers and non-travellers. The ITN can readily be extended to include details on local area transportation, multiple means of transportation, and journeys among different countries. For example, Fig. 1(b) shows schematically a local transportation network with stations (nodes) served by a subway network (dashed lines) and a bus network (solid lines). A journey includes generally travelling in both Fig. 1(a,b) . Effects such as traffic congestion naturally emerge. As far as epidemics are concerned, faster and more convenient inter-city journeys would reduce the travel time during which passengers are crowded and thus suppress the chance of being infected, but they would also induce people to make more journeys and to farther places and thus spread a diseases more readily. Our ITN would serve as a good starting point for exploring the interplay of travelling and infection dynamics for many further work.",

For a single type of links, i.e., v s = v f , the path of shortest travel time coincides with the shortest path. In ITN with v s < v f , the shortest paths are generally different from the paths of shortest time. As v f > v s , selected paths will involve railways as much as possible. It is convenient to discretize the journeys. The distance r ij between two neighboring nodes i and j are divided into \u03c4 ij time steps. At each time step, p W i agents at node i become travellers. The destinations are chosen according to Eq. (5). The journeys are carried out as follows:",

In the SIS dynamics, we distinguish infections among non-travellers in the cities and among travellers in the same segment of a link with infectious rates \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 , respectively. As travellers on trains/buses are densely packed, \u03b2 2 > \u03b2 1 47 . An agent is a traveller and non-traveller at different times. When he is a non-traveller in a city, he is exposed to an infectious rate of \u03b2 1 . Once he is on a journey, he is exposed to an infectious rate of \u03b2 2 during each segment of his journey, regardless of the segment being in the middle of a link or a passing-by city. Only travelling agents in the same segment k r (1 \u2264 k r \u2264 \u03c4 ij ) towards the same direction can infect each other. Thus, SIS on ITN accounts for the continual exchanges of agents on trains and buses due to partial overlaps of agents' journeys and the spread of a diseases through journeys. A susceptible non-traveller at node i will be infected by the rate 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b2 1 ) n i,I when he is in contact with n i,I infected agents. A susceptible traveller at a segment k r of a link will be infected by the rate \u03b2 \u2212 ( \u2212 ) , 1 1 An approximate theoretical analysis. We make a qualitative analysis of the key behavior and illustrate that the dependence of \u03c1 I on the model parameters in ITN can be captured by mean-field considerations. Let there be M cities. There are m pairs of cities that the journey between which is all on high-speed trains. The mean number of sections \u2329 \u03c4\u232a in a link is \u03c4 s = int(s/v s ) + 1 for highway links and \u03c4 f = int(s/v f ) + 1 for railway links, where s is the mean distance between neighbouring nodes. There are altogether where N tot is the total population. The set of equations can be iterated in time for the steady state. Further generalizations of ITN can be treated accordingly. Based on Eq. (8), we make the following observations:",

One should note that this captures one effect of having faster transportation. However, an opposite effect of inducing more travellers poses a risk.",
