The ICTV web site (http://ictv.global) provides access to the current taxonomy database in online and downloadable formats, and maintains a complete history of virus taxa back to the first release in 1971. The ICTV has also published the ICTV Report on Virus Taxonomy starting in 1971. This Report provides a comprehensive description of all virus taxa covering virus structure, genome structure, biology and phylogenetics. The ninth ICTV report, published in 2012, is available as an open-access online publication from the ICTV web site. The current, 10th report (http://ictv.global/report/), is being published online, and is replacing the previous hard-copy edition with a completely open access, continuously updated publication.

This process of classification and naming comprises the discipline of taxonomy, and has been an integral part of biological research since at least the 18th Century when Carl Linnaeus defined the principles of modern taxonomy (4) . Taxonomic classification is a scientific endeavor whereby biological organisms are grouped together and placed into their proper taxonomic hierarchy based on the characteristics that form a unique descriptor identifying a particular organism. This research process is driven by individual scientists who publish their work, providing their evidence for the proposed classification. As new data are obtained either on the organisms previously studied, or on related organisms, the classification hierarchy may change. The principles, procedures, and nomenclature used to name taxa, is handled by one of the international organizations charged with developing the necessary guidelines. For example, naming of animal species is subject to the principles established by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (2, 5) . Naming of bacterial species is guided by the International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology (3) .",

The ICTV consists of a series of officers, subcommittee chairs, and elected members that oversee tax-onomic classification and naming. There are six subcommittees, each of which covers a different group of viruses, differentiated by the type of host the virus infects (animal, plant, fungal and protist, or bacterial and archaeal) and the molecular composition of the virus genome (DNA, RNA, double or single stranded and translational polarity). Each subcommittee contains a series of study groups, generally one per virus family, that develop the demarcation criteria used to define each new taxon, and evaluate proposals using those criteria for classification and naming. These demarcation criteria are based upon the genetic and biological properties of the taxon members, and cover each of the taxonomic ranks currently recognized by the ICTV: order, family, subfamily, genus and species.",

The properties that define higher-level taxa are shared with all lower-level taxa that belong to higherlevel taxa (15) . For example, viruses of the order Picornavirales all are non-enveloped, icosahedral particles containing one or two segments of positive-sense RNA (16) . The family Picornaviridae is one of (currently) five families belonging to the order Picornavirales. Members of the family Picornaviridae contain a single monocistronic genome with conserved genome organization (arrangement of encoded polypeptides). Members of the genus Enterovirus (family Picornaviridae) share more than 42% amino acid identity across the length of their polyprotein. Finally, members of the species Enterovirus C, share a limited range of hosts and host receptors, have similar polyprotein processing programs, and share more than 70% amino acid identity in the polyprotein. Once these criteria for grouping similar viruses into common taxa are established, they are used as demarcation criteria to determine if newly discovered viruses are members of an existing species (and therefore also in existing higher-level taxa), or if the new viruses warrant creation of a new species (and potentially new higher-level taxa), if their properties are sufficiently distinct from the viruses in an existing species.",

These proposals are submitted to the appropriate study group which then evaluates and modifies the proposal as necessary, in consultation with the original author. Once a year, the ICTV Executive Committee (EC) meets, discusses all submitted proposals, and will either accept a proposal, send it back for modification, or reject it. Then the set of accepted proposals are sent to the ICTV membership for ratification. Once ratified, the newly approved taxonomy is entered in the ICTV taxonomic database. The database utilizes a relational schema built using Microsoft SQL Server. The tables store a controlled vocabulary used for specific fields where the possible data values remain fairly constant. These include taxonomy level (currently species, genus, subfamily, family, and order), possible taxonomic changes from the previous release (new, split, move, merge, rename, and abolish), and virus genome type (e.g. dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA(+), ssRNA(-), etc.) that forms part of the annotation available for the member viruses of each species. Each record in the taxonomy table stores data on a single taxon including its name, numerical id, parent taxon, release number and date, most recent taxonomic change, filename of the proposal establishing the taxon, and a pointer to its previous record if a change has occurred in taxon data (such as moving a species to another genus). With this information, a complete history of every taxon can be reconstructed from the database. Table 1 displays an example set of database records for the species Measles morbillivirus.",

Virus discovery has been one of the areas of emphasis of large environmental sampling and metagenomic sequencing projects. The goal of these projects is to more thoroughly assess, in an unbiased manner, the true diversity of biological organisms in a particular environment at a particular place in time, by sequencing the genomes of all organisms present in a sample using high-throughput sequencing technologies. For viruses, this entails utilizing methods that sequence not only DNA-based organisms, but organisms (viruses) with RNA genomes, by including a reverse transcription step in the metagenomic isolation and sequencing pipeline. Once the sequence reads have been generated, efficient sequence assemblers are then able to then identify the reads unique to a single virus genome, and assemble them into a complete, or almost complete, genomic sequence. These metagenomic sequencing projects have resulted in the assembly of thousands of new virus genomes that when classified, should result in the creation of thousands of new virus species and higher-level taxa.",

            "text": "In June of 2016, the ICTV helped organize a meeting to discuss metagenomic sequencing and its impact on virus classification. A consensus statement published by meeting participants recommended that viruses detected solely by metagenomic sequencing contain sufficient information in their genomic sequence to support their classification and naming (30, 31) . The ICTV concurred with that recommendation. Therefore, the ICTV is now accepting proposals for new virus taxa supported solely by metagenomic sequence information. This policy should ensure that the official ICTV virus taxonomy will be much more reflective of the true diversity of existing viruses. But at the same time, this will require that the systems in place for characterizing virus diversity, proposing new virus taxa, storing these taxa in the ICTV database, and browsing and searching for these taxa from the ICTV web pages, be streamlined and made capable of handling the many thousands of new taxa that will need to be created. The ICTV may also need to modify its policies and procedures for naming of virus species and expand the available taxonomic ranks needed to classify these viruses, to handle the large number of new, diverse viruses discovered using metagenomic sequencing methods.",
