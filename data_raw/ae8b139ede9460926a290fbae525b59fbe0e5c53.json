For these reasons, we do not use the traditional mediation tests [1] , but adapt and simplify them for genomic data.",

Instead of permuting the trait outcome, the pairing of trait to QTL is maintained, and the mediator is permuted. GEVs are then fit for potential mediators from the minimum logP from the permutation scans, instead of the maximum logP in QTL scans. FWER-controlled mediation p-values are calculated from the cumulative distribution function of the GEV: permP m = F GEV (logP). An additional FDR adjustment is not used with mediation because it is only evaluated for detected QTL, which we found likely to violate the uniform null distribution expectations of FDR. Notably, we use the genome-wide and chromosome-wide measurement of molecular traits, the vast majority of which are ineligible to be mediators of the eQTL due to location, to characterize empirical error distributions for the mediator test, and thus derive FWERcontrolling thresholds. This approach is statistically stringent, given that mediators must be local to the eQTL, which is appealing in terms of controlling false positives that could result in biologically-complex data.",

As with mediation through chromatin state, 1,000 permutations are used to derive genome-wide mediation p-values, permP m G . Mediation of cQTL through other chromatin sites and gene expression were also considered, but did not result in the detection of any candidate mediators other than Zfp985 expression as a mediator of a distal-cQTL on chromosome 4 for a chromatin region located chromosome 13 near Akr1e1.",

It is not possible to distinguish M \u2192 Y from M \u2190 Y given these data. If M is an intermediary of X on Y, the expectation is that the effect of X \u2192 M is greater than X \u2192 Y. We check that the effect size of the QTL for step 1 (X \u2192 Y) is less than the effect size of the QTL from step 3 (X \u2192 M). Failure of this step does not disprove the proposed mediation model, but it could suggest that the relationship between M and Y is more complicated than the simple models tested here, or that greater noise is incurred in the measurement of M than Y.",
