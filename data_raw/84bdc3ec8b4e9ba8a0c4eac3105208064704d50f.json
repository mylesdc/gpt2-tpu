Fieldwork using the rapid, iiRT-PCR platform described was explicitly developed to quickly identify a possible cross-border incursion of A/H7N9 into Viet Nam. A lengthier, two-step assay involving conserved influenza A target-matrix protein, for example-followed by priority or OIE-reportable subtypes (H5, H7, and H9) is also feasible. On-site detection of a novel influenza subtype outside of this framework remains a challenge until a rapid, portable pan-influenza platform is developed mirroring the one-step pan-influenza A virus benchtop PCR primer and probe sets that have been described. 13 Other limitations encountered include a need to develop surge capacity policies enabling rapid resource reallocation toward containment, and data management systems facilitating an accelerated diagnostic-to-response time frame. Confidence in the validity of the diagnostic result is a further pre-requisite for adoption, and early engagement of involved stakeholders-particularly those with financial and livelihood interests at stake-is critical.",

With support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the US Agency for International Development, DAH and provincial staff collected oropharyngeal swabs from poultry at eight vendor stalls selected at random-pooling five birds/vendor-in each of 17 live bird markets twice weekly across the four provinces. Analysis involved two, four-well POCKIT Micro iiPCR (GeneReach) machines at each site for simultaneous analysis of all samples collected at the site.",

New plug-and-play platforms combining RNA extraction with RT-PCR in a single machine are now commercially available. For example, the POCKIT Central platform (GeneReach), with running cost of 12 USD per sample, further reduces the time from single-sample insertion to result to less than 90 minutes. Achieving such order-of-magnitude reduction in time from sample collection to result presents a series of compelling opportunities in reducing the threat from emergent animal-origin influenza of pandemic potential. First, diagnostic turnaround measured in hours permits sampling of highest risk populations-in live bird markets or high-risk farms with suboptimal biosecurity or wild bird contact, for example-and immediate implementation of control and containment strategies, before animals have moved from the premises, thereby limiting onward transmission risk. A positive detection under such conditions permits authorities to operationalize a pre-planned set of emergency control measures-from movement restrictions and epidemiological analyses of flows into and out of the site to deployment of communication and risk avoidance messaging, and, as warranted, humane depopulation, compensation, site closure, disinfection, and ring vaccination. Second, early detection limits the magnitude of infection in atrisk livestock populations, presenting an attractive economic return on investment in avoiding loss associated with widespread transmission and emergency response. 12 Third, rapid identification of zoonotic influenza permits targeted, animal value chain-linked human syndromic surveillance at the human-animal interface. A coordinated response with human health authorities provides an opportunity to rapidly identify influenza-like illness among in-contact individuals both at and along value chains and populations linked to the site of detection.Finally, early detection of novel animal-origin influenza holds promise of interrupting the repeated cycle of incursion to endemicity.",
