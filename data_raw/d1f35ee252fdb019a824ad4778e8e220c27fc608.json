            "text": "It has been reported that lactoferrin (LF) participates in the host immune response against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) invasion by enhancing NK cell activity and stimulating neutrophil aggregation and adhesion. We further investigated the role of LF in the entry of SARS pseudovirus into HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells. Our results reveal that LF inhibits SARS pseudovirus infection in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis suggested that LF was able to block the binding of spike protein to host cells at 4uC, indicating that LF exerted its inhibitory function at the viral attachment stage. However, LF did not disrupt the interaction of spike protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV. Previous studies have shown that LF colocalizes with the widely distributed cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Our experiments have also confirmed this conclusion. Treatment of the cells with heparinase or exogenous heparin prevented binding of spike protein to host cells and inhibited SARS pseudovirus infection, demonstrating that HSPGs provide the binding sites for SARS-CoV invasion at the early attachment phase. Taken together, our results suggest that, in addition to ACE2, HSPGs are essential cell-surface molecules involved in SARS-CoV cell entry. LF may play a protective role in host defense against SARS-CoV infection through binding to HSPGs and blocking the preliminary interaction between SARS-CoV and host cells. Our findings may provide further understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis and aid in treatment of this deadly disease.",

            "text": "In April 2003, a novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the etiological agent of SARS [3] . SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus. Its large RNA genome is approximately 30000 nucleotides in length and encodes a nonstructural replicase complex and structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [4] . Spike protein is the envelope protein responsible for invasion of host cells. Further three-dimensional structure analyses suggest that spike protein is composed of two subunits: S1, which mediates SARS-CoV binding to receptors on host cells, and S2, which triggers virus and host cell membrane fusion [5] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a metallopeptidase, has been identified as one of the functional receptors of SARS-CoV and is responsible for binding to spike protein and mediating SARS-CoV entry into host cells [6] . Crystallographic studies have shown that a segment containing amino acids 318-510 of S1 is the critical receptor-binding domain for the ACE2 receptor [6] . ACE2 is highly expressed on human lung alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes of the small intestine and the brush border of the proximal tubular cells of the kidney. These locations of ACE2 expression are consistent with the tissue tropism and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection [7] . Other coreceptors or cellular molecules may be required to facilitate SARS-CoV invasion.",

Among these up-regulated genes, LF expression was elevated by approximately 150 fold in SARS patients compared with healthy controls.

            "text": "LF is a multifunctional protein present in external secretions, including saliva, tears, milk, nasal and bronchial secretions, gastrointestinal fluids and urine mucosal secretions, and is an important constituent of the neutrophilic granules of leukocytes [9] . LF possesses strong antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of RNA and DNA viruses, such as Sindbis virus [10] , cytomegalovirus [11, 12] , herpes simplex virus [13] , Semliki forest virus [14] , human polyomavirus [15] , human papillomavirus [16] , echovirus [17] , human immunodeficiency virus [18] and rotavirus [19] . These viruses typically utilize common molecules on the cell membrane to facilitate their invasion into cells. These molecules, including heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), provide the first anchoring sites on the cell surface and help the virus make primary contact with host cells [20] . It has been shown that LF is able to prevent the internalization of some viruses by binding to HSPGs, which is present on most cells [21] . This property of LF confers protection to the host against viral infections. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that another underlying mechanism for the anti-SARS-CoV effect of LF involves its capability to bind to the extensively distributed HSPGs molecule on host cells. Our results indicate that HSPGs provide the preliminary docking sites on the cell surface and play an important role in the process of SARS pseudovirus cell entry. LF can block the infection of SARS pseudovirus by binding to HSPGs, suggesting that it may exert a protective role in host immune defense against SARS-CoV invasion.",

Briefly, S1190-Fc and Fc were expressed by HEK293E/S1190-Fc and HEK293E/ Fc cells, respectively. S1190-Fc is a recombinant protein composed of the soluble extracellular region (amino acids 1-1190) of SARS spike protein with human IgG Fc fused to its C terminus. The proteins were purified using a protein A column (GE Healthcare), and the protein concentration was measured with a BCA assay kit from Bio-Rad.

Because cell entry of SARS pseudoviruses leads to GFP expression, this result suggests that the infection of HEK293E/ ACE2-Myc cells by SARS pseudovirus can be dramatically inhibited in the presence of LF. We further utilized western blotting to examine GFP expression in the LF-treated cells after incubation with SARS pseudovirus. We found that the amount of GFP protein was reduced in the presence of LF ( Fig. 1E and 1F ). The degree of inhibition was correlated with the concentration of LF. At the same time, the GFP expressing cells were tested by flow cytometry after incubation with LF and SARS pseudovirus. Figures 1G and 1H demonstrate that LF inhibits SARS pseudovirus infection in a dosedependent manner. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) is approximately 0.7 mM. However, there was no GFP expression in the cells incubated with viral particles without spike protein (Fig.1I) , indicating that SARS pseudovirus cell entry is mediated by spike protein.

The binding of LF to HSPGs prevents the first contact between virus and host cells and thus prevents subsequent infection. To ascertain whether LF interacts with the cell-surface HSPG molecules, we used heparin to interfere with the binding of LF to target cells. Due to their similar structural compositions, exogenous heparin has been widely utilized as a soluble HS analog to competitively inhibit the interaction between HSPGs and their ligands [35] . Prior to incubation with Oregon Green-labeled LF, HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells were treated with heparin at different concentrations. The MFI was analyzed to detect the amount of LF binding for each group.

Prior to SARS pseudovirus infection, we added heparin to the cells and incubated the heparin-treated cells with LF for 1 h at 37uC. As shown in Figure 4B , adding heparin increased the infectivity of SARS pseudovirus in the presence of LF compared with controls. This evidence further supports the conclusion that LF blocks adsorption and internalization of SARS pseudovirus through binding to HSPGs on the cell surface. Interestingly, another phenomenon also captured our attention. Adding heparin alone also prevented the cell entry of SARS pseudovirus into host cells (Fig. 4B ). This result is consistent with the previous finding that heparin can reduce the infection of Vero E6 cells by replicationcompetent SARS-CoV [36] . This evidence implies that HSPGs play an important role in SARS-CoV cell entry. Furthermore, we found that, instead of increasing cell entry, incubating HEK293E/ ACE2-Myc cells with 10 mM heparin and 10 mM LF curtailed the infectivity of SARS pseudovirus, compared with the cells treated with 3 mM heparin and 10 mM LF. One reasonable explanation for this result is that excessive heparin competes with the HS chain on the cell surface and prevents adsorption of SARS pseudovirus to host cells. These data indicate that HSPGs are important molecules involved in SARS pseudovirus cell entry.",

Then, we used heparinase I to degrade the HS chain on the cell surface. We found that enzymatic removal of HS polysaccharides resulted in a reduced ability of S1190-Fc to bind to host cells at 4uC (Fig. 5B) , suggesting that in addition to ACE2, HSPGs act as another docking site for SARS-CoV on the cell surface.

The treatment of host cells with a cellular HS analog dramatically decreased the infectivity of SARS pseudovirus (Fig. 6A) , indicating that SARS pseudovirus cell entry is blocked by competitive inhibition on the part of heparin and that the binding sites provided by HSPGs are important for effective infection. The enzymatic degradation of HS chains from the cell surface also led to resistance of HS-deficient cells to SARS pseudovirus infection (Fig. 6B) , demonstrating that the HS chains of HSPGs are involved in SARS pseudovirus cell entry. Because HSPGs are widely distributed on the cell membrane, it is very likely that they serve as the initial anchoring site, facilitating the preliminary contact between the virus and host cells and the subsequent concentration of viruses on the cell surface. According to previous studies, viral particles are then transferred from the low affinity HSPGs to specific high affinity entry receptors, which results in internalization into host cells [37] . HSPGs themselves are not sufficient for SARS-CoV entry. HSPGs are widely expressed on most mammalian cells. However, SARS-CoV can be found only in limited host cells, such as lung alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes of the small intestine and the brush border of the proximal tubular cells of the kidney [3] . Therefore, HSPGs may play an important role in promoting SARS-CoV infection by facilitating access to a specific entry receptor. However, when chondroitin sulfate was removed from cell surface by enzymatic digestion, SARS pseudovirus could still effectively infect the host cells, suggesting that compared with HSPG, chondroitin sulfate may have much less impact on SARS pseudovirus cell entry.",

Surprisingly, we found that soluble heparin and enzymatic removal of cell surface HSPGs effectively inhibited VSV-G virus particle infection (Fig. 8) , which is consistent with previous reports using replicationcompetent VSV and VSV-G pseudotyped virus on other cell lines, including human Hela, avian CER, human bronchial 16HBE-S1 and tracheal CFT1-C2 epithelial cells, etc. [38] [39] [40] [41] . Furthermore, previous reports have shown that LF could exert an inhibitory effect on VSV infection [42] , which is also confirmed by our experiment result (Fig. 8 ). All these data suggest that HSPGs also play an important role in the process of VSV cell entry. The binding of LF to cell surface HSPGs may account for the reduction of VSV infection. To date, many investigations have been performed to elucidate this rather complicated process of viral cell entry.

            "text": "Previous studies have indicated that in addition to ACE2, other coreceptors or cellular molecules are required for SARS-CoV infection [7] . Our results suggest that the efficient entry of SARS-CoV into host cells requires the involvement of HSPGs in concert with ACE2. Increased infectivity of SARS pseudovirus was associated with binding to HS. Elimination of cell-surface HS by heparinase or the addition of exogenous heparin reduced the ability of the virus to bind to the cell surface and increased cellular resistance to infection. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that murine coronavirus utilizes HSPGs as a receptor for cell entry [52] , suggesting that HSPGs may also play an important role in (A) Interference of the interaction between Vero E6 and SARS pseudovirus by LF, heparin and heparinase leads to reduction of viral infection. Vero E6 cells were treated by the same methods above with 10 mM LF, 10 mM heparin or 10 U of heparinase I, respectively. Then, the cells were incubated with SARS pseudovirus as described in Methods. GFP-expressing cells in the total population were analyzed by flow cytometry. The relative viral infection ratio was measured by comparing the percentage of GFP expressing cells of each group to that of the control. Error bars represent the SD of three independent experiments. *** P,0.001 and **P,0.01. (B) Incubation with LF or heparin, or degradation of HSPGs by heparinase inhibits SARS pseudovirus infection of Caco-2 cells. The Caco-2 cells were treated by same methods as described above. *** P,0.001, **P,0.01 and *P,0.05. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0023710.g007 the process of SARS-CoV infection due to the similarity of the spike protein structures of these two viruses. Thus, it is very likely that HSPGs serve as SARS-CoV attachment sites and facilitate the concentration of the virus on the cell surface as well as access to specific entry receptors. At the preliminary stage, the docking of the virus to host cells is mediated by the interaction between the spike protein and HS chains of HSPGs. This association facilitates the further binding of SARS-CoV to its cell-surface receptor, ACE2. The current widely accepted model for the role of HSPGs suggests that the transport of extracellular virus particles from the low affinity anchoring sites to the high affinity specific entry receptors is a ubiquitous phenomenon in viral invasion, which is termed 'viral surfing' [48] . Through the weak and reversible interaction between the virus and the docking sites, the virus binds to host cells and scans the cell surface for the specific receptors. SARS-CoV may also adopt a similar strategy for cell entry. Figure 9 illustrates the hypothetical process of SARS-CoV infection. However, SARS-CoV attachment to HSPGs alone does not enable viral entry. HSPGs are widely distributed on the surface of mammalian cells. However, the target cells of SARS-CoV are limited to lung alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes of the small intestine and the brush border of the proximal tubular cells of the kidney, among others [3] . Therefore, HSPGs play an important and complex role in promoting SARS-CoV infection. The entry process also requires the interaction of viral spike protein with one or more co-receptor molecules, such as ACE2, on the cell surface.",

            "text": "It has been revealed that LF is highly up-regulated (by 150 fold) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of SARS patients [8] . LF is usually present in plasma and external secretions and exerts a wide variety of biological functions, such as inhibiting infection by microbes, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. LF is a highly conserved protein, with approximately 70% sequence homology between the bovine and human forms [54] . Therefore, bovine LF is often utilized as a substitute for human LF because of their similar functions [55, 56] . Our results suggest that LF can inhibit the entry of SARS pseudovirus into HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells in a dose-dependent manner. LF does not disrupt the interaction between the spike protein and the ACE2 receptor in vitro. However, LF inhibits spike protein binding to HEK293E/ ACE2-Myc cells. The target molecules on the cell membrane that LF interacts with are HSPGs. Previous three-dimensional structure analyses have revealed that LF carries highly cationic charge on its molecular surface, particularly in the N-terminal domain [57] . The highly positive surface charge is a characteristic feature of this multifunctional protein. Many studies have demonstrated that LF binds to HSPGs on the cell membrane with a high affinity through its N-terminal glycosaminoglycanbinding domain [58, 59] . HSPGs are composed of a core protein that is covalently connected with linear, polysulfated heparan sulfate polysaccharides. Due to their abundant carboxyl and sulfate groups, HSPGs are a major source of the highly negatively charged macromolecules that surround almost all mammalian cells [51] . This strong net negative charge permits HSPGs to bind to the N-terminal glycosaminoglycan-binding domain of LF through electrostatic attraction [58] . Our experiments revealed that LF-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV infection occurs Figure 8 . HSPGs are also involved in VSV-G virus cell entry. HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells were treated with 10 mM LF, 10 mM heparin or 10 U of heparinase I, respectively, in the same way. And the same methods were used for the subsequent assay as described above. GFPexpressing cells in the total population were analyzed by flow cytometry.

The binding of LF to HSPGs prevented preliminary contact between SARS-CoV and host cells and, thus, prevented subsequent cell entry. In summary, LF may exert its protective functions against SARS-CoV invasion in two ways at the same time. On the one hand, as reported in previous research, LF enhances NK cell activity and stimulates neutrophil aggregation and adhesion in immune defense [8] ; on the other hand, LF curtails the entry of SARS-CoV into host cells during SARS-CoV infection. LF may have potential therapeutic applications as a drug candidate for the treatment of SARS disease.",

(A-D) Fluorescence microscopy illustrates that the number of SARS pseudovirus-infected GFP-expressing HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells decreases in the presence of LF. HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells were treated with LF for 1 h at 37uC at the concentration of 1 mM (B), 3 mM (C) or 10 mM (D). BSA (10 mM) was used as control (A). The LF-pretreated cells were treated with SARS pseudovirus as described in Methods. (E and F) Western blotting reveals that LF markedly reduces GFP expression in HEK293E/ACE2-Myc cells incubated with SARS pseudovirus.

BSA (10 mM) served as control. The percentage of GFP expressing cells in the total population was calculated by flow cytometry.

The anchoring sites provided by HSPGs permit initial contact between SARS-CoV and host cells and the concentration of virus particles on cell surface. SARS-CoV rolls onto the cell membrane by binding to HSPGs and scans for specific entry receptors, which leads to subsequent cell entry. (B) LF blocks the infection of SARS-CoV by binding to HSPGs. LF expression may be up-regulated when SARS-CoV infects the human body. LF locates to cell-surface HSPGs and prevents the preliminary interaction between the virus and host cells and the subsequent internalization process. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0023710.g009",
