Results: A total of 6980 public health professionals worldwide have graduated from an FETP or from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Epidemiology Intelligence Service (EIS). FETP residents and graduates participate in key public health prevention, control, and response activities. Each FETP has adapted its curriculum and objectives over time to align with its country's public health priorities. FETPs are well integrated into their national public health infrastructures, and they have many partners at the national, regional and global levels.",

It is the mission of the field epidemiology training programmes (FETPs) to teach these skills, which now exist in 57 countries, up from 10 countries in 1997. The number of countries that send health professionals for training to FETPs has also grown from 10 to 84 [2] . All 57 FETPs belong to one global network, the Training Program in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network (TEPHINET), which is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, with branch offices in Pakistan, Colombia, and Guatemala. TEPHINET's mission is to strengthen global public health capacity by supporting well-qualified professionals in field epidemiology through training, service and networking opportunities. TEPHINET is the only global network of applied epidemiologists. To evaluate how well its worldwide network of FETPs is fulfilling the mission to increase public health capacity, TEPHINET compiled data from all 57 FETPs that were part of the global network in 2012, to review common elements of the training curricula, key activities and achievements of the FETP residents and graduates, including the ability to share best practice at scientific conferences, and activities of the global network to improve the quality of training.",

In contrast to other public health training programmes, FETPs often rely on graduates to mentor first-year residents [3] . FETPs also require residents to support the host institution priorities through field assignments during which the residents apply the concepts learned during didactic teaching. All FETPs share this common value of learning through service. Graduates often move into influential positions within their country's Ministry of Health (MOH) or within a local or international public health organization, thereby enhancing the country's evidencebased, public health policy and practice. Throughout the history of FETPs, residents and graduates have been key responders to some of the highest priority public-health challenges around the world, including epidemics related to HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile virus, and avian (H5N1) and swine (H1N1) influenza. Graduates and residents also responded to natural disasters such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2010 earthquake in Haiti [5] [6] [7] .",

Examples of residents' accomplishments are the number of peerreviewed papers published presentations delivered at a national, regional or global scientific conference; surveillance systems developed or evaluated and disease outbreaks investigated (Figure 2 ). For instance, Ethiopia's FETP was established in 2011, and as of August 2012, its residents had conducted 44 outbreak investigations and participated in developing or evaluating more than 20 surveillance systems. Ghana's FETP was involved in several different types of outbreaks, including yellow fever, diarrhea, measles, cholera and rabies.",

This manual will be updated with information obtained from pilot site-visits to a programme in each region, so that interested programmes can apply to the process in 2014.

Fifteen years ago the global network of FETPs comprised only 10 programmes, and the FETPs and graduates were recognized for 'supporting an evidence-based public health resource that could serve communities effectively and efficiently\u02bc [1] . Since then, the numbers of graduates and the breadth of public health issues they address have grown substantially. For instance, FETP residents and graduates have participated first hand in numerous cross-border and global public health investigations or emergency responses related to, for example, natural disasters, increases in noncommunicable diseases in developing countries and emerging or re-emerging threats, such as pandemic influenza. Because the FETPs focus on applying epidemiology methods in real life situations, and adapt to the public health services needed, many have been sustained for a decade or more. As a result they have become increasingly embedded in and familiar with the communities they serve, and valued for the public health services they provide.",
