Viral transmission occurs directly or indirectly via fomites. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and viability of FCV in the environment after sequential oronasal infections of specified pathogen-free cats with two FCV field strains in a research facility. Replicating virus was detected in saliva swabs from all ten cats after the first and in four out of ten cats after the second FCV exposure using virus isolation to identify FCV shedders. In the environment, where cleaning, but no disinfection took place, FCV viral RNA was detectable using RT-qPCR on all tested items and surfaces, including cat hair. However, only very limited evidence was found of replicating virus using virus isolation. Viral RNA remained demonstrable for at least 28 days after shedding had ceased in all cats. Disinfection with 5% sodium bicarbonate (and Incidin TM Plus) and barrier measures were effective in that no viral RNA was detectable outside the cat rooms. Our findings are important for any multicat environment to optimize hygienic measures against FCV infection.",

All cats were group-housed in a confined university facility in four connected rooms (total of~37.2 m 2 ) under ethologically and hygienically ideal conditions [16] . All experiments were conducted according to Swiss law and were approved by the veterinary office of the canton of Zurich (TVB ZH095/15, issued 11 August 2015). After the arrival of the cats and prior to the start of the experiment, each cat was clinically examined, and blood and plasma samples and conjunctival, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs were collected to verify the cats' SPF status. These samples were tested for FCV, feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), hemoplasmas, parvovirus (FPV), herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) and coronavirus (FCoV), as previously described [17] [18] [19] . The presence of Bartonella henselae, Chlamydia felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma felis was tested [3, 17, 18, 20] . Feline gammaherpesvirus (FcaGHV) [21] was tested by PCR with modifications as described in Novacco et al., 2019 [22]. In addition, the serum samples were tested for antibodies against feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus, feline parvovirus and feline coronavirus by immunofluorescence assays as previously described [23, 24] , and for feline immunodeficiency virus by western blot [25] . All cats tested negative for all of these infections prior to the start of the experiment.",

Usually, FCV causes painful oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis/stomatitis, inappetence, fever and depression with a high morbidity, but low lethality [1, 3, 4] . However, FCV can occur as a very virulent form, causing severe clinical signs, due to systemic infection and inner organ involvement and high mortality rates up to 60% are reported [5] [6] [7] . FCV is a non-enveloped RNA virus with a high tenacity that can remain infectious for approximately one month on dry surfaces at room temperature [4] , and for weeks at colder temperatures [8] [9] [10] . Additionally, the stability of FCV is strain-dependent, and common disinfectants do not inactivate FCV [11, 12] . Viral transmission occurs via direct cat-to-cat contact or indirectly via fomites (e.g., food bowls, contaminated coats). Reports from animal hospitals encountering outbreaks of virulent FCV infections emphasize that indirect transmission is a key factor in viral spread [5, 13, 14] . In human hospitals, environmental testing for common human pathogens is routinely performed to",

            "text": "The floor in the food storage room was also sampled ( Figure 3 ) on the same days as the items in the cat rooms. These samples were intended as negative controls, since this room was within the cat facility (within the outer barrier), but outside the inner barrier, separating the FCV-infected cats from the rest of the cat facility area. No cats other than those involved in the FCV experiment were housed in this facility at the same time. All sampled locations apart from the food storage room and the filter of the ventilation were in direct contact with the cats. Two different real-time RT-qPCR assays (FCV RT-qPCR S1 and S2) were used to detect FCV [3, [29] [30] [31] . The methods had been adapted as follows: Primer and probes were used [3] with the AgPath-ID TM One-step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The mastermix consisted of 1X RT-PCR buffer, 1.0 \u03bcL Array Script reverse transcriptase and AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase, 300 nM forward primer [3] , 900 nM reverse primer [3] , 250 nM probe [3] , and nuclease-free water was added to a final volume of 20 \u03bcL. All RT-qPCR were run with 5 \u03bcL of TNA in a final volume of 25 \u03bcL. Positive and negative controls were run in parallel. The sampling method was adapted from a study investigating human norovirus contamination in a hospital area [15] . For each surface location, an area of 6 \u00d7 6 cm 2 was marked with a waterproof pen, swabs were humified/moistened with sterile 1\u00d7 phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 (Gibco, Life Technologies) and then rolled over the marked area. The swabs were either placed in a 1.5 mL safe-Lock Eppendorf tube (Eppendorf AG) or in a micro tube 1.5 mL (Sarstedt AG and Co. KG) containing 300 \u00b5L DNA/RNA shield (Zymo Research). The shaft of the swab was cut with sterile scissors prior to closing the tube. The protective filter paper of the ventilation system was cut into six pieces of 1 cm 2 using sterile scissors and each piece was transferred to either a 1.5 mL safe-Lock Eppendorf tube (Eppendorf AG) or to a micro tube 1.5 mL (Sarstedt AG and Co. KG) containing 300 \u00b5L DNA/RNA shield (Zymo Research). The set of samples in DNA/RNA shield (Zymo Research) was stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until RNA extraction, and the other set of samples was processed the same day prior to incubation in cell culture. Sampling always took place first thing in the morning before touching any cats, and people handling the samples wore latex gloves. Swabs and protective filter paper pieces dedicated to cell culture were incubated with 200 \u00b5L sterile complete RPMI at 40 \u2022 C for 10 min. The supernatants from the four swabs or the six pieces from one location were pooled, filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter (Filtropur S 0.45 \u00b5m, Sarstedt AG and Co. KG) and 400 \u00b5L of the filtrate were used to infect 80-90% confluent CRFK cells in a 24 well plate as described above. The cells were checked daily for CPE and as soon as CPE occurred, or after a maximum of seven days, the cell culture supernatant was harvested and frozen at \u221280 \u2022 C until further confirmation by FCV RT-qPCR. Two different real-time RT-qPCR assays (FCV RT-qPCR S1 and S2) were used to detect FCV [3, [29] [30] [31] .

This included items that were in direct contact with the cats, i.e., food and water bowls, water, litter boxes and the cat room floor. However, FCV viral RNA was also detected at the ventilation filter, which was not in direct contact with FCV-shedding cat; this finding indicated that there was the aerosol spread of the virus in environmental dust and cat hair. Although FCV viral RNA was detected on many items, we found no (or only limited) evidence of FCV with replication capacity in the environment, as tested by virus isolation in cell culture. During the entire time course of the study, no FCV was detected outside the inner barrier area.

Consequently, environmental contamination was found on all tested items in the cat rooms that were in direct or indirect contact with the cats. Subsequently, a decrease in environmental contamination was observed, with fewer items testing positive for FCV RNA over time. Moreover, sampling of the environment in different places was standardized, and samples were analyzed using RT-qPCR. Decreased FCV RNA loads were observed over time. This decrease in environmental contamination reflected the shedding pattern of the cats. Interestingly, the ventilation filter tested positive for FCV as long as the cats were shedding FCV. After the second experimental FCV infection with FCV 27, fewer cats shed FCV and the shedding period was shorter compared to the first experimental infection. Accordingly, the contamination of the environment after the second FCV infection was not as extensive as after the first FCV infection. Indeed, no FCV viral RNA was found on any of the tested environmental items. The lower number of cats shedding FCV and the shorter shedding duration after the second FCV infection were probably not the only reasons for the absence of FCV viral RNA in the environment after the second FCV challenge. During the first infection, only one cat was shedding FCV from day 43 until day 71. Nonetheless, environmental contamination remained detectable up to day 106 after the first FCV infection. Therefore, we hypothesize that the persistence of FCV outside the host could also be strain-dependent. It has been shown that some FCV strains were more resistant to disinfection with different biocides than others [11] , and Lee and Gillespie 1972 [34] found differences in the resistance of two different FCV strains to changes in pH. Therefore, further studies with different FCV strains from cats with different clinical signs, including virulent-systemic isolates, will be required to confirm these findings.",

The water bowl tested in our study showed an intermediate frequency of FCV positivity (53%). We assume that the relative humidity for FCV on this item was variable, depending on different water levels in the bowl. It was notable that the frequency of FCV positivity of swabs of the two litter trays was low (19%). Even though FCV is mainly shed via the oral route, there are reports of isolation of FCVs from feline urine [36] [37] [38] . Limited shedding in urine could account for the limited contamination of the litter tray. On the other hand, FCV shed by the cats could have been absorbed by the litter, which was not tested in this study. In a recent study, it was shown that the type of litter used could influence the environmental spread of FCoV via cat feces and litter boxes [39] . Moreover, the sampling method and the presence of substances, i.e., dust, litter, food on the sample might also influence the extraction efficiency of viral nucleic acids and in turn the result of the subsequent RT-qPCR testing. For further studies on FCV shedding via litter boxes, we suggest testing the cat litter directly and also testing urine and feces samples from FCV-infected cats to detect any FCV shedding via the fecal/urine-route.",

FCV RNA was detected on one hair sample collected on day 85, but at no time points thereafter. However, cat JJH3 had stopped shedding FCV after day 71, which could at least partially explain why no more hair samples tested FCV-positive, despite cats regularly licking their hair during grooming. Following the second FCV infection, we collected hair samples early during infection at day 9. However, FCV shedding was diminished after the second FCV infection, and only four cats were shedding FCV at that time. Hair sampling was discontinued after day 9 because none of the hair samples tested FCV RT-qPCR positive.

            "text": "Although FCV viral RNA was found in abundance in the environment, no replication competent virus was detected using virus isolation; only minimal RT-qPCR signals were found in four of the cell culture supernatants. It has been reported that the number of viral genomes detected, and the presence of infectious viruses do not necessarily correlate [40] . In a study of viral genomes in mineral water, the stability of infectious FCV F9, but not the viral RNA measured by RT-qPCR, was affected by the water temperature [40] . The viral capsid could have been damaged by environmental influences resulting in replication incompetent virions that were nonetheless still detectable by molecular methods [40, 41] . This could have also been the case in our study. However, it might also be that the viral loads in this study were too low to initiate efficient virus replication in cell culture; this does not exclude the possibility that the loads might have been sufficient to infect a cat directly. Even so, our findings seem to contrast with current literature. Clay et al., 2005 [8] could recover viable FCV for up to three days from dry surfaces, and in the study of Doultree et al., 1999 [10] , FCV stayed replication competent in suspension or in a dry state for up to several weeks, depending on the temperature. However, the latter two studies on FCV stability in the environment used a different approach to that used here; first, the contamination of fomites occurred artificially and second, the FCV laboratory strain F9 was used. The laboratory strain FCV F9 has been used for many years for laboratory and vaccine studies, and therefore, has been propagated in cell culture numerous times. Prolonged culturing of FCV can influence the composition of the virus quasispecies [34] . Radford et al., 1998 [34] demonstrated that the evolution of FCV in cell culture leads to a reduction in quasispecies variability. Additionally, virus neutralization tests showed that FCV isolates directly obtained from cats evolved antigenically over the course of an infection, whereas, isolates passaged in cell culture no longer showed changes in their neutralization pattern [35] . Therefore, prolonged culturing of FCV isolates in cell culture could potentially have influenced the viral behavior in the environment and/or it could have increased the ability of the (recovered) virus to grow in culture. The FCV field strains tested in this study were derived from Swiss domestic pet cats presented to veterinarians with oral ulcerations, gingivitis, stomatitis, fever and depression. The two field strains showed low sequence identity between each other and towards FCV F9, indicating that they are all separate FCV strains [1] . The two field FCV strains were passaged and expanded in cell culture only four to five times before inoculation of the SPF cats in the present study. We suggest that artificial contamination is not comparable with natural contamination via shedding by FCV-infected cats in terms of viral loads and distribution of the contaminant. In particular, the distribution of the contaminant is a challenge for the sampling method in a natural setting. In contrast, in an artificial setting, it is known precisely where the pathogen was placed, and samples can be collected from that location. We tested those places we expected to be contaminated, since each cat had to interact with those places or items on a daily basis. However, in the present study, only a small fraction of the entire possibly contaminated area could be sampled, which could explain the lack of recovery of replicating viruses. The ten cats in this study had a total of 37.2 m 2 floor space available, and the room was structured in a way that the cats could use it on several levels. We assume that this is more surface space per cat than what isusually provided for cats in clinical environments and rescue shelters. Furthermore, we assume that the sampling method might influence the number of viral particles recovered. Three different methods for the recovery of FCV were compared on wool and nylon carpets in a study by Buckley et al., [35] . On these surfaces, especially, macrofoam-tipped swabbing revealed very low recovery efficiency compared to the bottle extraction and the microbial vacuum method [35] . Although we also used swabbing in our study, we sampled only firm surfaces with cotton swabs. We assume that this is not directly comparable with swab sampling of a carpet.",

This finding emphasized that strict separation of the quarantine area from the rest of the facility is important. Additionally, the choice of disinfectant is also crucial for the success of FCV prevention. Here we used 5% sodium bicarbonate in hot water as a disinfectant against FCV; sodium bicarbonate has been reported to be effective against FCV [42] , and was recommended as a safe and inexpensive disinfectant against FCV [32] that is non-toxic for cats and humans. However, it is not effective against many other pathogens [43] . Therefore, we additionally used glucoprotamin to prevent the introduction of other pathogens into the facility. Since glucoprotamin is not effective against FCV, we assume that sodium bicarbonate in combination with barrier measures was effective against spreading of FCV to the outer barrier area. Not only items in direct contact, but also infectious aerosols have to be taken into account when cleaning and disinfecting FCV contaminated areas.",

Seven months later (age of 46 weeks), all cats were challenged using the FCV 273 virus. Eleven months later (94 weeks of age), all cats were revaccinated once (FCV F9 or placebo vaccine) prior to the second FCV challenge with FCV 27 at 99 weeks of age.",
