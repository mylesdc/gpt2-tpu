            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), caused by virulent feline coronavirus, is the leading infectious cause of death in cats. The type I interferon (type I IFN)-mediated immune responses provide host protection from infectious diseases. Several coronaviruses have been reported to evolve diverse strategies to evade host IFN response. However, whether feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) antagonizes the type I IFN signaling remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that FIPV strain DF2 infection not only failed to induce interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) production, but also inhibited Sendai virus (SEV) or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C))-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. Subsequently, we found that one of the non-structural proteins encoded by the FIPV genome, nsp5, interrupted type I IFN signaling in a protease-dependent manner by cleaving the nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) essential modulator (NEMO) at three sites-glutamine132 (Q132), Q205, and Q231. Further investigation revealed that the cleavage products of NEMO lost the ability to activate the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. Mechanistically, the nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage disrupted the recruitment of the TRAF family member-associated NF-\u03baB activator (TANK) to NEMO, which reduced the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to the inhibition of type I IFN production. Our research provides new insights into the mechanism for FIPV to counteract host innate immune response.",

            "text": "Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) are important pathogens of domestic cats and wild felids, including African and mountain lions [1, 2] . FCoVs are classified into two pathotypes, the avirulent feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), and the virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Both FECV and FIPV have two serotypes, type I and type II FCoVs, based on differences in the amino acid sequence of the S protein [3, 4] . Infection with FECV is widespread among cats, especially in high-density environments, causing inapparent or mild enteritis with little clinical consequence. However, a small portion of cats develop FIP during the course of FECV infection and succumb to the disease [5] . Spontaneous mutations of the S gene [6] , ORF3abc [7, 8] , and ORF7ab [9, 10] in the FCoV genome allow virions to efficiently replicate in macrophages and monocytes, ultimately resulting in FIPV [11] . Detection of FCoV S gene mutations is considered as a tool to diagnose FIPV [12, 13] . FIP is typically characterized by a fibrinous and granulomatous serositis, protein-rich serous effusions, and pyogranulomatous lesions in several organs [14, 15] . Also, published reports have shown that lymphopenia in combination with massive apoptosis of uninfected T-cells which precedes the onset of clinical signs is a notable feature of both experimental and natural FIP [11, 16] . Once cats develop classic clinical signs, fatality to FIP is virtually 100% [15] and the survival time from diagnosis to death is about 8-9 days [17, 18] . FIPV is the leading cause of death in young cats [19] , and significant research efforts still have not resulted in a fully elucidated pathogenesis.",

Like all coronaviruses, FCoV replication and transcription occur in the cytoplasm, resulting not only in new genome molecules and the typical nested set of subgenomic mRNAs but also in the dsRNA intermediates [20] [21] [22] . The FCoV genome contains seven open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a and ORF1b produce the coronaviral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. The polyproteins are then processed by virus-encoded proteases, the papain-like protease (PLpro) and the 3C-like protease (3CLpro).

            "text": "Interferons (IFNs) are crucial antiviral cytokines in innate immune responses. Viral infection triggers host innate immune responses through activation of the transcription factors nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which coordinately regulate the expression of type I interferons such as interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) [26, 27] . The type I interferons activate the JAK-STAT pathway to stimulate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which collectively inhibit viral replication and assembly [28] . The NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO), as a regulatory protein, is an essential component of the I\u03baB kinase complex (IKK) [29] . NEMO contains many distinct domains, including a TRAF family member-associated NF-\u03baB activator (TANK)-binding domain [30] , two coil-coiled domains (CC1 and CC2), a leucine zipper region, and a zinc finger domain [31] . Previous studies demonstrated that NEMO but not NF-\u03baB activity is essential for virus-induced activation of IRF3 and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7). NEMO interacts with TANK to recruit TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor-\u03bab kinase \u03b5 (IKK\u03b5) to the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) complex in the process of IRF3 and IRF7 activation [32] . During coevolution with their hosts, many viruses have evolved redundant mechanisms to counteract the host immunity for optimal viral adaption. Accumulating evidence shows that coronaviruses have abilities to evade host IFN response. Previous studies have shown that PEDV nsp1 is the most potent IFN antagonist. PEDV nsp1 interrupted the enhanceosome assembly of IRF3 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) by degrading CBP in a protease-dependent way [33] . SARS-CoV PLpro efficiently inhibits activation of the IRF3 pathway by disrupting the interaction between the components in stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3)-TBK1 [34] . SARS-CoV nsp14 is an exoribonuclease that is capable of preventing IFN responses by a specific digestion of dsRNA and subsequent removal of RNA-PAMPs [35] . MERS nsp16 is essential for interferon resistance and viral pathogenesis [36] . However, not much is known about how FIPV acquires mechanisms to evade host immune responses, except for the identification of accessory protein 7a as a counteragent against IFN-\u03b1-induced antiviral response [37] . Here, we demonstrated that FIPV strain DF2 antagonizes type I IFN signaling. We found that FIPV nsp5 as a negative regular inhibited type I IFN production by cleaving multiple sites of NEMO. Mechanistically, the FIPV nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage disrupted the interaction between TANK and NEMO, which resulted in inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation and suppression of type I IFN production. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of FIPV to evade host innate immune response.",

Detection of viral pathogens by innate immune system mainly leads to the induction of innate antiviral mechanisms, most of which are mediated primarily by type-I interferons (IFNs) [40] . To explore whether the FIPV-DF2 infection can activate the host innate immune responses, CRFK cells were co-transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids IFN-\u03b2-luc and pRL-TK, followed by mock-infection or infection with increasing concentrations of FIPV-DF2 as indicated. After 12 h of FIPV-DF2 infection, the IFN-\u03b2 promoter luciferase reporter system was measured. As shown in Figure 1A , IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity was barely detectable in DF2-infected cells compared with the strong signal in SEV-infected cells, indicating that FIPV-DF2 infection failed to activate IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity. Additionally, to further investigate whether FIPV-DF2 infection can activate different ISG expression involved in the IFN signaling pathway, CRFK cells were infected with increasing concentrations of FIPV-DF2 as indicated for 12 h or treated with IFN-\u03b1 as a positive control, and the levels of the relative ISG mRNA were detected. We found that FIPV-DF2 infection barely induced Viperin ( Figure 1B ), ISG15 ( Figure 1C ), and IFITMI ( Figure 1D ) mRNA levels, although the relative ISGs production were enhanced in IFN-\u03b1-pretreated cells. Furthermore, to test whether DF2 infection inhibits SEV-or poly(I:C)-induced IFN-\u03b2 production, the IFN-\u03b2 promoter luciferase reporter system and qRT-PCR were used to analyze IFN-\u03b2 production. As shown in Figure 1E -H, we found that the SEV-or poly(I:C)-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and the IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels were significantly inhibited by FIPV-DF2 infection in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that FIPV-DF2 infection impedes type I IFN signaling in CRFK cells. The data shown represent the means \u00b1 SD, and all experiments were repeated three times.

The results showed that FIPV nsp5 inhibited SEV or poly(I:C)-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation (Figure 2A ,B) and its mRNA levels ( Figure 2D ,E) in a dose-dependent manner. According to a previous report, CoV nsp5 is a cysteine proteinase, which mainly depends on the His41 and Cys144 to conduct its cleavage function. Moreover, nsp5 doublemutant H41A/C144A completely abolishes its protease activity [41] . To further determine whether the antagonistic property of FIPV nsp5 in type I IFN signaling is dependent on its protease activity, three plasmids expressing different mutant versions of FIPV nsp5 (H41A, C144A, H41A/C144A) were constructed and the impact of their expression on SEV induced IFN-\u03b2 production was evaluated by qRT-PCR and dual luciferase assay. As shown in Figure 2C ,F, in contrast to wild-type nsp5, the three nsp5 mutants (H41A, C144A, H41A/C144A) were incapable of suppressing SEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation ( Figure 2C ) and its mRNA levels ( Figure 2F ), revealing that the protease activity of FIPV nsp5 is involved in antagonizing IFN-\u03b2 production. the levels of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA were detected by qRT-PCR.

            "text": "NEMO is an essential component of the IKK complex which contains many distinct domains, including a TANK-binding domain [30] , two coil-coiled domains (CC1 and CC2), a leucine zipper region, and a zinc finger domain [32] . Previous studies demonstrated that CoV nsp5 preferentially cleaved glutamine (Gln) at the P1 position [42, 43] . In the experiment described above, co-expression of FIPV nsp5 and feline NEMO resulted in the appearance of three N-terminal fragments. Two of them had molecular masses of approximately between 25 and 35kDa, while a smaller new band had a molecular mass of approximately 20 kDa. According to these data, we speculated the amino acid sequence of NEMO for potential FIPV nsp5 cleavage sites which could be able to produce fragments of the appropriate size mentioned above. We inferred that potential FIPV nsp5 cleavage sites existed at amino acids 123-240 within feline NEMO. To examine FIPV nsp5 cleavage sites, we constructed a series of NEMO mutants in which glutamine (Gln) at the P1 position was replaced with alanine or arginine ( Figure 4A ). HEK293T cells were transfected with NEMO or NEMO mutation, in combination with the expressing plasmid nsp5. As shown in Figure 4B , we observed that at least one cleaved fragment was absent in the NEMOQ132A, NEMOQ205A, or NEMOQ231A/FIPV nsp5 co-expression samples; in contrast, FIPV nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage was not affected by Q123A, Q134A, Q168A, Q207A, Q229R, or Q236-239A. We further investigated whether cellular caspase activity or proteasome or lysosome signaling are required for FIPV nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage. HEK293T cells expressing NEMO and nsp5 were treated with a pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK), proteasome inhibitor (MG132), or lysosome inhibitor (NH4CL), respectively. The results showed that none of the three inhibitors prevented FIPV nsp5-mediated NEMO cleavage ( Figure 4C) . Moreover, to test whether endogenous NEMO was cleaved during FIPV-DF2 infection, CRFK cells were either mock-infected or infected with increasing concentrations of DF2, and the levels of endogenous NEMO were investigated. As shown in Figure 4D , upon infection with increasing concentrations of DF2, the levels of endogenous NEMO decreased in a dose-dependent manner compared with mock-infected cells. ",

The secretion of type I IFN, IFN-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b2 is the foundation of the innate host defense against virus infection, followed by the activation of autocrine and paracrine signaling, which induces IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral activities. RIG-I and MDA5 play nonredundant roles in cytosolic RNA sensing by recognizing different groups of viral RNAs. During coevolution with its host, viruses evolve a variety of strategies to evade host innate immune responses. However, it is unclear whether type I IFN responses are inhibited by FIPV.

Since the coronavirus nsp5-encoded 3C-like protease (3CLpro) plays an important role in virus replication and immune evasion, 3CLpro is considered an attractive target for the development of anti-coronaviral therapeutics. It has been demonstrated that the cleavage of adaptors involved in the signaling pathway by a main viral protease is considered as a particularly effective way for virus to escape the innate immune response. Previous studies reported that the EV71 virus inhibits Toll-like receptor 3-mediated antiviral responses through the cleavage of TRIF and IRF7 by 3Cpro [47, 48] . Recently, Li Huang et al. [49] also found that EMCV 3C protease relieved the TANK inhibitory effect on TRAF6-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling through cleavage of TANK. Additionally, NEMO, which is a key adaptor involved in multiple signaling pathways, has been reported to be cleaved by FMDV, HAV, PEDV, and PRRSV [41, [50] [51] [52] . Here, we verified that, similarly to PEDV nsp5, FIPV nsp5 could also disrupt RLR signaling by targeting the crucial feline adaptor NEMO ( Figure 3F ). Furthermore, we identified that FIPV nsp5, rather than FIPV nsp5DM, is capable of cleaving feline NEMO in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3G-H) , which explains our earlier observation that the protease activity of FIPV nsp5 is involved in antagonizing SEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production ( Figure 2C,F) .",

Interestingly, in this study, three N-terminal fragments were detected under the co-expression of feline NEMO or NEMOK277A and FIPV nsp5 ( Figure 3F ), indicating that FIPV nsp5 protein possesses the ability to cleave multiple sites of NEMO. The size of the largest fragment in FIPV nsp5-medated cleavage was consistent with that in PEDV nsp5-mediated cleavage, while the two new potential FIPV nsp5 cleavage positions were identified as NEMOQ132 and NEMOQ205 ( Figure 4B) . Surprisingly, we found that NEMOQ231A completely prevented FIPV nsp5-mediated cleavage. The protease-substrate interaction is the first step of the proteolytic activity of proteases. We inferred that the NEMOQ231A substitution makes it lose the ability to bind the protease and form the complex. NEMO contains many distinct domains, including TANK-binding domain [30] , two coil-coiled domains (CC1 and CC2), a leucine zipper region, and a zinc finger domain [31, 32] . Q132 is located within coil-coiled domain 1, while Q205 and Q231 are located within the TANK-binding domain. Furthermore, we assessed the cleavage of NEMO in FIPV-infected CRFK cells. Unfortunately, we failed to detect the endogenous cleavage products of NEMO in FIPV-infected CRFK cells, but we observed a gradual reduction of the intensity of NEMO following FIPV infection ( Figure 4D ). Similar situations were also reported in previous studies. SVV 3Cpro could cleave multiple sites of MAVS, TRIF, and TANK and produced the corresponding cleavage products, despite cleavage products not being observed in SVV infected cells [53] . We inferred that the cleavage products may be short-lived during FIPV-nsp5 infection.",
