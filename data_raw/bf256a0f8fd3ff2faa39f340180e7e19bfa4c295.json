            "text": "Equine lentivirus receptor 1 (ELR1) has been identified as the sole receptor for equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily. In addition to the previously described membraneassociated form of ELR1, two other major alternative splicing variant mRNAs were identified in equine monocyte-derived macrophages (eMDMs). One major spliced species (ELR1-IN) contained an insertion of 153 nt, which resulted in a premature stop codon situated 561 nt upstream of the predicted membrane spanning domain. The other major species (ELR1-DE) has a deletion of 109 nt that causes a shift of the open reading frame and generates a stop codon 312 nt downstream. Because ELR1-DE presumably encodes a peptide of a mere 23 residues, only ELR1-IN was further analyzed. The expression of a soluble form of ELR1 (sELR1) by ELR1-IN was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. Similar to ELR1, the transcription level of ELR1-IN varied among individual horses and at different time points in the same individuals. The ratio of ELR1-IN mRNA species to ELR1 mRNA was approximately 1:2.5. Pre-incubation of the recombinant sELR1 with EIAV significantly inhibited EIAV infection in equine macrophages, the primary in vivo target cell of the virus. Fetal equine dermal (FED) cells are susceptible to EIAV in vitro, and the replication of EIAV in FED cells transiently transfected with ELR1-IN was markedly reduced when compared with replication in cells transfected with the empty vector. Finally, the expression levels of both forms of the EIAV receptor were significantly regulated by infection with this virus. Taken together, our data indicate that sELR1 acts as a secreted cellular factor that inhibits EIAV infection in host cells.",

The receptor of EIAV is equine lentivirus receptor 1 (ELR1), which was identified by Zhang et al. in 2005 using a functional cloning approach [4] . In contrast to most other lentiviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), which require co-receptors for successful infection, EIAV appears to depend only on a functional ELR1 for the invasion of target cells. Based on its sequence and structural characteristics, ELR1 belongs to the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily [4, 5] , and many receptors of this superfamily, such as the growth factor receptor, leptin receptor and Fas, also have soluble forms. Soluble forms have also been identified for some immunoglobulins and chemokine receptors [6] [7] [8] .",

In addition, the alterative splicing of mRNAs during the maturation of eukaryotic pro-mRNA is another mechanism for the formation of soluble receptors. The translation of receptor mRNA can be prematurely terminated due to alterative splicing, which produces receptors that lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains [6, 7, 9] .",

Another study found that the soluble form of the avian sarcoma leukosis virus subgroup A (ASLV-A) receptor Tva (sTva) inhibited the infectivity of this virus by 90% at a low concentration (25 pM) but mediated ASLV-A infection in cells lacking the receptor at a high concentration (5 nM) [16] .

There was no b-actin detected in the medium, which ruled out the possibility that these soluble receptor molecules were leaked from broken cells (Fig. 5B ).",

The fold changes of ELR1 and sELR1 mRNA (ELR1-IN) after EIAV infection at each time point are shown in Fig. 6 , with the fold changes of the mRNA levels in mock-infected cells as the baseline (indicated as 1). Both the ELR1 and ELR1-IN levels showed no apparent change or a slight decrease during the 4 to 12 h post-infection.

Multiple alternative splicing variants of ELR were identified in this study for the first time. The predominant isoform that produces a functional ELR1 is a species of 942 bp containing exons 1-9. The other two major isoforms include ELR1-IN, which contains an insertion of a fragment of intron 6, and ELR-DE, in which exon 3 is deleted following splicing.

ELR1-IN was consistently detected in different individuals at different times, and it was translated into a functional soluble ELR1 when the recombinant molecule was expressed. In addition, we did not find the typical ''GT/AG'' and ''GC/AG'' splicing sites in these spliced ELR1 variants. However, due to the absence of a sufficient equine alternative splicing database, the splicing model of ELR1-IN remains unclear [24] .",

It was reported that the coincubation of soluble CD4 with HIV-1 envelope protein resulted in the dissociation of the gp120 surface protein and gp45 transmembrane protein [6, 28] . CD4 is also the cellular receptor of HIV-1, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus SIVmac and SIVagm. The soluble form of CD4 (sCD4) can block HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection in human lymphoma cell lines, but it enhances SIVagm infection in these cell lines by 10 to 100-fold [29] . A similar augmenting effect of soluble viral receptors on the invasion of viruses was also observed in studies on herpes simplex virus (HSV) [30, 31] . In addition, a study on Jaagsiekte retrovirus (JSRV) found that although the soluble form of its receptor, Hyal2 (sHyal2), did not mediate the entrance of a JSRV-pseudotype retroviral vector into cells lacking the integrated Hyal2, this purified soluble protein significantly inhibited the infection of the pseudotyped vector in the target cells of JSRV [13] . Moreover, some soluble receptors in the plasma can be considered markers of disease progression, such as soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR) II and soluble IL-2 and IL-6 receptors in HIV-1-infected patients [10, 14, 32] . Therefore, soluble receptors play important roles in the interactions between viruses and hosts [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Studies on the mechanisms regulating the formation of soluble viral receptors should lead to a better understanding of the cellular responses to invading viruses.",

Additionally, the expression levels of ELR1 and its alternative splicing variants were regulated by EIAV infection. In a separate study on the restriction of EIAV superinfection, we found that the up-regulation of sELR1 induced by the initially infected viral strain was correlated with protection against subsequent viral infection (unpublished data). At present, it remains unclear whether the inhibitory effect of sELR1 on EIAV infection is based on the competition of the binding of the virus to membraneassociated ELR1 or on the polymerization with EIR1, which may trigger or may reduce signal transduction of membrane-associated receptors, therefore interfering with the expression of downstream cellular proteins [6] . However, our data indicate that sELR1 is not merely a truncated product of a spliced ELR1 transcript but is a functional protein with important biological roles. ELR1 is a member of the TNFR superfamily, which is known to have important roles in regulating immune responses and inducing pathological outcomes [4, 38] . Previous studies have shown that plasma TNFa concentration is positively correlated with the clinical symptoms of EIAV-infected horses [18] . It was also reported that sTNFR was significantly elevated in patients with HIV-1 infection [10] . Because ELR1 acts as both the receptor of EIAV and a member of TNFR family, the finding that sELR1 is regulatable and can compete its membrane-associated prototype form implicates the involvement of this soluble protein in both of the viral infectivity and the host response, especially that TNFa is closely related with EIA symptoms. The possible role of sELR1 in ELR1 signaling is an interesting question to be explored.",

Therefore, sELR1 may be considered a secreted cellular factor that regulates susceptibility to EIAV and the pathological and immunological responses of the host. Furthermore, the identification of ELR1-IN and other alternative splicing variants of ELR1 suggests additional approaches for further studies on the pathogenesis and immunogenicity of EIAV infection. Figure S1 Recombinant sELR1 was expressed in 293T cells as a fusion protein with a GFP tag linked at the Nterminus. The percentage of GFP-expressing cells and the fluorescence intensity of sELR1-GFP in cells were examined by flow cytometry. The GFP-tagged ELR1 was also expressed and analyzed in parallel in the experiments shown in this figure. All the experiments were performed for three times, and a representative result is shown.",

ELR1 transcripts were amplified and subcloned from mRNA extracted from the PBMCs of three horses (#1, #9 and #21) at days 0, 30 and 60. A total of 126 subclones were randomly selected and sequenced. (A) The ratios of three major ELR1 splicing variants, ELR1, ELR1-IN and ELR1-DE, were analyzed and compared. (B) A schematic of the positions and relative frequencies of the three sliced forms of ELR1-IN and five ELR1-DE variants in 43 subclones sampled from three horses. The shaded form indicates the predominant isoform of ELR1-IN or ELR1-DE. E1 to E9 indicate exon 1 to exon 9, respectively. (C) The amino acid sequences of ELR1 and its splicing variants ELR1-IN and ELR1-DE were predicted and aligned. There are two presumed ORFs, ELR1-DE1 and ELR1-DE2, for the ELR1-DE isoform. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0079299.g002",
