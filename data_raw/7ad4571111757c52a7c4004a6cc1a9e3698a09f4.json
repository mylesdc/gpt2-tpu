            "text": "Recognition of viruses by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) causes interferon-b (IFN-b) induction, a key event in the antiviral innate immune response, and also a target of viral immune evasion. Here the vaccinia virus (VACV) protein C6 is identified as an inhibitor of PRR-induced IFN-b expression by a functional screen of select VACV open reading frames expressed individually in mammalian cells. C6 is a member of a family of Bcl-2-like poxvirus proteins, many of which have been shown to inhibit innate immune signalling pathways. PRRs activate both NF-kB and IFN regulatory factors (IRFs) to activate the IFN-b promoter induction. Data presented here show that C6 inhibits IRF3 activation and translocation into the nucleus, but does not inhibit NF-kB activation. C6 inhibits IRF3 and IRF7 activation downstream of the kinases TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IkB kinase-e (IKKe), which phosphorylate and activate these IRFs. However, C6 does not inhibit TBK1and IKKe-independent IRF7 activation or the induction of promoters by constitutively active forms of IRF3 or IRF7, indicating that C6 acts at the level of the TBK1/IKKe complex. Consistent with this notion, C6 immunoprecipitated with the TBK1 complex scaffold proteins TANK, SINTBAD and NAP1. C6 is expressed early during infection and is present in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Mutant viruses in which the C6L gene is deleted, or mutated so that the C6 protein is not expressed, replicated normally in cell culture but were attenuated in two in vivo models of infection compared to wild type and revertant controls. Thus C6 contributes to VACV virulence and might do so via the inhibition of PRR-induced activation of IRF3 and IRF7.",

            "text": "Mammalian cells respond to viral infection by producing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and also interferons (IFNs), of which type I IFNs, consisting of IFN-b and several IFNa proteins, are particularly important. IFN-a and IFN-b then act in an autocrine and paracrine manner to switch on hundreds of target genes which contribute to anti-viral innate immunity by blocking virus replication and alerting neighbouring cells to the danger of infection (reviewed in [1] ). In addition to their role in innate immunity, type I IFNs also promote adaptive immune responses by priming T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells [2] . The initial production of type I IFNs is due to the activation of IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), and in particular IRF3, downstream of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize viral DNA, RNA and proteins. PRRs that detect the presence of foreign RNA include the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid induced gene I (RIG-I), which sense intracellular double-stranded (ds) RNA and singlestranded (ss) RNA containing a 59 triphosphate, respectively [3] [4] [5] [6] . Other PRRs that aid the detection of viruses include the endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs), namely TLR3 which senses dsRNA, TLR7 and TLR8 which sense ssRNA and TLR9 which recognizes unmethylated DNA (reviewed in [7] ). Intracellular DNA sensors such as AIM2, RNA polymerase III, DAI and IFI16 are also involved in sensing DNA viruses by recognizing the presence of dsDNA in the cytosol [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . RNA polymerase III, DAI and IFI16 signal to cause type I IFN production, while AIM2 activates the inflammasome leading to processing of prointerleukin (IL)-1b and release of IL-1b [9, 11, 12, 15] . RNA polymerase III is unusual in that it does not signal directly in response to DNA, but instead transcribes AT-rich DNA into RNA species, which are then recognized by RIG-I [8, 10] .",

            "text": "The signalling pathways activated by the RLRs, the IFNinducing intracellular DNA receptors and by TLR3 converge at the level of the kinases TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF) family member NF-kB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IkB kinase-e (IKKe). These kinases exist in complexes with the scaffold proteins TANK, NAP1 (NAK-associated protein 1) or SINTBAD (similar to NAP1 TBK1 adaptor) [16] [17] [18] . To activate these kinases, RLRs and consequently RNA polymerase III signal via the adaptor protein MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signalling) [19] [20] [21] , other intracellular DNA sensors employ STING (stimulator of IFN genes) [22, 23] , while TLR3 uses TRIF (TIRdomain containing adaptor molecule inducing IFN-b) [24, 25] . PRRs also require TRAF3 for the activation of TBK1 and IKKe (reviewed in [26] ). Once activated by PRR signalling, TBK1 and IKKe phosphorylate IRF3, causing its translocation to the nucleus and the transcriptional activation of promoters containing appropriate binding sites, such as the IFN-b and CCL5 promoters, and a subset of promoters containing IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) [27, 28] . A related transcription factor of the IRF family, IRF7, also plays an important role in anti-viral responses and can be activated in a similar manner to IRF3 during viral infection [29] . However, while IRF3 is expressed constitutively, IRF7 is present at low levels in most cells, but is induced by type I IFNs in a positive feedback loop. Thus, IRF7 is particularly important for the continued expression of IFN-b during viral infection, and also contributes to induction of IFN-b by cooperation with IRF3 [29, 30] . In addition, IRF7 is essential for the induction of IFN-a genes that are not induced by IRF3 [29] . In plasmacytoid dendritic cells, an alternative TBK1-and IKKeindependent signalling pathway resulting in the activation of IRF7 is employed by TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9. These endosomal TLRs signal through the adaptor protein MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88), leading to activation of the kinase IKKa which then phosphorylates IRF7 [29, 31, 32] . This is unusual, because in other PRR signalling pathways IKKa and IKKb are involved in the phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-kB (IkB), causing its degradation and the subsequent activation of NF-kB. NF-kB is another transcription factor activated by PRRs, and is critical for innate immunity. NF-kB and IRF3 (or IRF7) co-operate with the activating protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor family to induce the transcription of the IFN-b promoter.",

Functional characterisation showed that only F1 and N1 inhibit apoptosis [42, 43] and consistent with this these proteins have a surface groove for binding BH3 peptides from pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins [42, 43] . In contrast, proteins B14, A52 and K7 lack this groove and inhibit innate immune signalling pathways instead [40, 44] .

Proteins encoded within the highly conserved central region of the VACV genome were excluded from the screen, as were proteins with well-characterized functions, secreted proteins and those smaller than 8 kDa. This selection process identified 49 ORFs, and these were amplified from VACV WR strain genomic DNA, and cloned into mammalian expression vectors. Plasmids encoding these ORFs were transfected individually into HEK293 cells, and the effect on the IFN-b promoter following PRR stimulation was measured by reporter gene assays.

Expression of C6 inhibited the activation of the IFN-b promoter by transfected poly(dA-dT) (which acts via intracellular DNA sensors) or poly(I:C) (which acts via RLRs) in HEK293 cells ( Figure 1A, B) , and by infection of cells with Sendai virus which activates RIG-I signalling [4] ( Figure 1C ).

Here a screen of poorly characterized vaccinia virus (VACV) proteins identified protein C6 as an inhibitor of IFN-b induction by PRRs. Data presented show that C6 prevents the activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 by the kinases TBK1 and IKKe, which are key components at the point of convergence of several PRR signalling pathways. C6 interacts with the scaffold proteins NAP1, TANK and SINTBAD, which are components of the protein complexes containing TBK1 and IKKe, and this interaction might modulate the activity of these kinases. C6 is expressed early during infection and contributes to virulence because viruses that do not express C6 are attenuated in two in vivo models compared to wild type and revertant control viruses. mouse NIH3T3 cells ( Figure 1D ). Furthermore, the presence of C6 inhibited the expression of endogenous IFN-b mRNA in Sendai virus-infected cells ( Figure 1E ), as well as the secretion of the chemokine CCL5 from infected cells ( Figure 1F ). Thus, the C6 protein significantly reduced the expression of IFN-b and CCL5 after stimulation of PRRs by ligands or viral infection.",

In a similar way, the kinases IKKa and IKKb phosphorylate IkB, which then releases activated NF-kB and allows its nuclear accumulation. To investigate whether the signalling pathways leading to NF-kB or IRF3 activation are inhibited by C6, the translocation of the NF-kB subunit p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was measured by confocal microscopy. For this, HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing GFP-tagged C6, or a control plasmid expressing GFP for 16 h. The cells were then infected with Sendai virus for 6 h, or stimulated with IL-1 for 15 min, fixed and stained for endogenous p65. During Sendai virus infection, approximately 20% of control cells expressing GFP displayed p65 accumulation in the nucleus (Figure 2A, B) , and the presence of GFP-tagged C6 did not affect the extent of p65 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, the expression of C6 did not affect the nuclear accumulation of p65 in cells stimulated with IL-1, an activator of NF-kB, which, regardless of whether the cells expressed GFP or GFP-tagged C6, caused p65 nuclear translocation in more than 80% of cells (Figure 2A, B) .",

Over-expression of C6 did not prevent activation of the NF-kB-dependent promoter stimulated by IL-1 or tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a in HEK293 cells ( Figure 2C ), or by poly(I:C) in HEK293 cells expressing TLR3 ( Figure 2D ). In contrast, the VACV protein B14, another member of the poxviral Bcl-2-like protein family, inhibited NF-kB promoter activation under these conditions ( Figure 2C , D) as shown previously [47] .",

This assay uses a fusion protein consisting of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and the transactivation domain of IRF3. When the IRF3 transactivation domain is phosphorylated by upstream signalling events, it induces expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a Gal4-dependent promoter. Using this assay, C6 inhibited poly(dA-dT)-stimulated IRF3 transactivation ( Figure 3C ), providing further evidence that C6 inhibits the activation of IRF3 by PRRs. To determine which step of the signalling cascade that leads to IRF3 activation is targeted by C6, the ectopic expression of signalling proteins that act upstream of IRF3 activation was used to drive the IRF3 transactivation assay. The RLR adaptor MAVS and the kinases TBK1 and IKKe all promoted IRF3 activation in this assay when overexpressed ( Figure 3D , E). Co-expression of C6 inhibited the activation of IRF3 in a dose-dependent manner in each case ( Figure 3D , E), indicating that C6 acts at the level of these signalling components or further 'downstream' to prevent IRF3 activation.",

In contrast, expression of isolated TBK1-binding domains (TBDs) inhibited the formation of the scaffold-kinase complexes ( Figure 5D , F, H) as described previously [17] . Similar results were obtained for the interactions between the scaffold proteins and IKKe, which were (blue). (B) Cells expressing V5-C6 or V5-GFP from (A) were observed by confocal microscopy and scored for nuclear translocation of IRF3. At least 100 cells were counted for each sample. Data shown are from one representative experiment of at least three. (C-E) HEK293 cells were seeded in 96-well plates, transfected with a pFR-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of the Gal4 promoter, a renilla luciferase transfection control, and an IRF3-Gal4 fusion plasmid. C6 expression vector (50, 100 or 150 ng, wedges) and empty vector (EV) were co-transfected per well. Expression plasmids for signalling factors (50 ng) were included in the transfection where indicated (D and E). In (A), cells were mock-transfected or transfected with 500 ng/ml poly(dA-dT) 8 h after the initial transfection. Cells were harvested 24 h after the first transfection, and firefly luciferase activity was measured and normalized to renilla luciferase activity. (F) HEK293 cells were transfected with a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of an ISRE element, a renilla luciferase transfection control, and a C6 expression construct or empty vector as above. The ISRE was driven by cotransfection of 2 ng of IRF3-5D. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and firefly luciferase activity was measured and normalized to renilla luciferase activity. Data are represented as mean 6 SD from one representative of at least three experiments each performed in triplicate. *p,0.05, ** p,0.01 or ***p,0.001 compared to EV. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1002247.g003 Figure S2A-C) . Thus, C6 appears to associate with the scaffold proteins TANK, NAP1 and SINTBAD, without disrupting the formation of the signalling complexes containing the kinases TBK1 or IKKe.",

These viruses included a C6L deletion virus (vDC6) lacking the C6 ORF, a plaque purified wild type virus (vC6WR) that was isolated from the same intermediate virus as the deletion mutant during transient dominant selection (see methods), a revertant virus where the C6L ORF was re-inserted into the deletion virus at its natural locus (vC6Rev), and an additional recombinant virus (vC6FS) where the C6 translational initiation codon was disrupted by the insertion of an adenine nucleotide. As expected, this virus, as well as vDC6, did not express C6 protein whereas vC6WR and vC6Rev both did ( Figure 6B ). For localisation and interaction studies a virus expressing HA-tagged C6 was constructed (vC6HA). Reduced levels of C6 were detected from this recombinant virus using the TBK1 expression plasmid, 0.5 mg FLAG-tag expression plasmid and 3 mg C6 or TBD expression vector or empty vector (EV) as indicated. Cells were harvested after 24 h and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody.

While the family members share structural similarity, their degree of amino acid similarity is low indicating they diverged long ago and although they share an ability to manipulate innate immune signalling pathways, they differ in their targets and mechanisms of action. While A46 acts at the interface between TLRs and their adaptors [56] , A52 targets the more downstream signalling factors TRAF6 and IL-1 receptor associated kinase 2 (IRAK2) [57] . B14, K7 and now C6 all appear to target the kinase complexes located at the point of convergence between several different PRR signalling pathways. However, each of the viral proteins targets distinct components of these complexes. B14 binds IKKb and thereby inhibits IkB phosphorylation and NF-kB activation [47] . In contrast, K7 inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation by binding to the helicase DDX3, which is part of the complexes containing TBK1 and IKKe [58] .",

            "text": "In this paper C6 is shown to inhibit the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 in a different way to K7, namely by interacting with TANK, NAP1 and SINTBAD. These three proteins act as scaffold proteins that associate constitutively with TBK1 and IKKe [17, 59, 60] . They are essential for the innate immune response to several different viruses and PAMPs, and in particular for the activation of IRFs, but not NF-kB, upon stimulation with Sendai virus or poly(I:C) [16] [17] [18] . The observation that the scaffold proteins are targeted by a viral immunomodulator provides additional evidence for the importance of these proteins in the antiviral response. The precise function of TANK, NAP1 and SINTBAD in the process of TBK1 and IKKe activation has not been defined fully, but there is evidence that the adaptor proteins link the kinases to the upstream signalling pathways, possibly by interaction with TRAF3, which is a component of TLR and RLR signalling pathways [16] . The recruitment of the kinase complexes to TRAF3 would then require the scaffold proteins, and lead to the phosphorylation and activation of TBK1 and IKKe, ultimately leading to the phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7. However, how exactly complex formation is linked to the activation of the kinases, and which functions of the adaptors may be redundant or unique, has yet to be elucidated. NAP1, TANK and SINTBAD are related in domain structure, possessing N-terminal coiled-coil regions that are important for homodimerization, and a central TBD, which mediates the interaction with TBK1 and IKKe [17] . While C6 interacted with all three scaffold proteins, it did not affect their interaction with either TBK1 or IKKe. In contrast, truncated proteins containing only the TBD of either NAP1, TANK or SINTBAD inhibited all the scaffold-kinase interactions in this assay, as described previously [17] . Thus the exact mechanism whereby C6 disrupts IRF activation remains to be determined. It is possible that C6 prevents the association of the scaffold-kinase complexes with TRAF3, or else prevents the activation of TBK1 and IKKe once the complexes are formed. Also, it is possible that the interaction between C6 and the scaffold proteins is indirect and is mediated by additional proteins that may be part of the kinase signalling complexes. Further analysis of the effect of C6 on these protein complexes may shed some light on the mechanism by which TBK1 and IKKe are activated -and inhibited -during viral infection.",

            "text": "VACV expresses several proteins that inhibit IRF activation, including the related Bcl-2-like protein K7, which also targets a TBK1-containing protein complex [58] . However, despite this, the effects of K7 and C6 are evidently not duplicative, because when K7 is still expressed, loss of C6 caused a marked virus attenuation in two models of infection. Similarly, there are several VACV proteins that inhibit NF-kB activation, for instance A52, A46, N1, B14. Yet deletion of any single member of this group causes virus attenuation suggesting non-redundant functions. Possible explanations for this non-redundancy might be cross talk between different pathways, so the outcome of blocking a pathway is influenced by the point at which a virus inhibitor functions to block the pathway. Alternatively, the virus proteins might have multiple functions as has been demonstrated for VACV protein N1. The need for the virus to express so many different non-redundant viral inhibitors of host signalling cascades may be due to the host innate immune system being able to partially compensate for the inhibition of an individual signalling component by using parallel pathways all ultimately leading to the induction of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the importance of one particular signalling pathway or component may vary depending on the cell type infected or stage of infection, thus requiring the inhibition of several, seemingly redundant signalling proteins. Finally, it is plausible that the inhibition exerted by a single viral protein in not complete, particularly at early stages of infection, thus requiring the expression of several different factors targeting components of the same pathway to have an additive effect.",

Furthermore, VACV strains are in development as vaccine delivery systems against smallpox and other pathogens (reviewed in [62] ), and as vectors for the targeting of tumours and for gene therapy (reviewed in [63] ). It is shown here that deletion of a single ORF can attenuate the virus, thus possibly making it safer for clinical use. Also, the deletion of ORFs that encode inhibitors of the innate immune system would be predicted to make the virus more immunogenic, and thus make a more effective vaccine. In this context, it is interesting to note that C6 is conserved in most OPVs and that the MPXV orthologue of C6 is functionally equivalent to the C6 protein from VACV strains WR.",

C6 expression vector (50, 100 or 150 ng, wedges) and empty vector (EV) were co-transfected per well. In (A), cells were mock transfected or transfected with 500 ng/ml poly(dA-dT) 8 h after the initial transfection. In (B), 50 ng plasmids expressing the indicated signalling protein were included in the initial transfection. Cells were harvested 24 h after the first transfection, firefly luciferase activity was measured and normalized to renilla luciferase activity. *p,0.05, ** p,0.01 or ***p,0.001 compared to EV. (TIF) Figure S2 C6 does not prevent the interaction between scaffold proteins and IKKe. (A-C) HEK293 cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected with 0.5 mg luciferase-tagged IKKe expression construct, 0.5 mg FLAG-tag expression construct and 3 mg C6 expression vector or empty vector (EV) as indicated. Cells were harvested after 24 h and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. Immunoprecipitated protein complexes were eluted with FLAG peptide and co-immunoprecipitated luciferase activity was measured. Data is representative of at least three experiments. ",
