The immune responses underlying alphavirus virulence remain enigmatic. We found that pentraxin 3 (PTX3) was highly expressed in CHIKV and RRV patients during acute disease. Overt expression of PTX3 in CHIKV patients was associated with increased viral load and disease severity. PTX3-deficient (PTX3 -/-) mice acutely infected with RRV exhibited delayed disease progression and rapid recovery through diminished inflammatory responses and viral replication. Furthermore, binding of the N-terminal domain of PTX3 to RRV facilitated viral entry and replication. Thus, our study demonstrates the pivotal role of PTX3 in shaping alphavirus-triggered immunity and disease and provides new insights into alphavirus pathogenesis.",

RRV is endemic to Australia, Papua New Guinea and South Pacific islands. An average of~6,000 cases of RRVD endemic to Australia are reported annually [2] , and~500,000 individuals were infected during its first outbreak in Fiji [3] . CHIKV, which is closely related to RRV, has caused large sporadic outbreaks globally, with the largest recorded outbreak of up to 6.5 million cases in India [4] . Recently, 470,000 suspected and confirmed cases of CHIKF have been reported in the Americas [5] . In both RRVD and CHIKF, clinical symptoms include fever, myalgia, fatigue and maculopapular rash [1, 6] . Debilitating persistent polyarthritis is the clinical hallmark of alphaviral diseases, often affecting joints in the hands, wrists, elbows, knees and feet, which can persists for months to years post infection [7] [8] [9] . In addition, we have recently identified severe pathological bone loss as another characteristic of alphaviral disease which may contribute to the chronic persistent arthralgia [10] . Emerging clinical evidence has demonstrated an increased tendency of CHIKF patients to develop RA [11] , and RRVD patients with pre-existing arthritis such as RA have prolonged rheumatic symptoms after infection [12] . These studies suggested a potential link between alphaviral-induced arthritis and other bone diseases, highlighting alphavirus infection as a possible predisposing risk factor for development of complicated bone disorders [13] . The persistency of debilitating polyarthralgias has a serious impact on quality of life and the economy, with an estimated cost of 34 million euros per year solely in the La Reunion CHIKV outbreak [14] . Symptomatic relief is the only therapeutic option currently available, due partly to a lack of understanding of the immune responses elicited during alphaviral infection.",

Excessive production of soluble innate mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) [15] [16] [17] contributes to alphaviral disease pathogenesis. Recent evidence that alphavirus-induced diseases can be exacerbated by overt expression of complement factor 3 (C3) [18] and mannose binding lectins (MBLs) [19] highlights the significance of the complement cascade in modulating alphaviral disease pathogenesis.",

PTX3 can be secreted by a broad range of cell types including neutrophils [21] , monocytes, macrophages and myeloid DCs [22] in response to inflammatory signals such as TNF and IL-1 [23] . Upon pathogen encounter, the release of PTX3 enables cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage to recognize and opsonize the pathogen, presenting it to activated phagocytic cells of the immune system for elimination [24] . Elevated expression of PTX3 has been implicated in many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including pulmonary infection [25] , giant cell arteritis [26] , atherosclerosis [27] and rheumatoid arthritis [28] . Intriguingly, PTX3 is thought to have both protective [29, 30] and pathogenic functional roles [31] in the immune system.",

We quantified the viral load in PTX3-overexpressing HEK 293T cells at early time points following a one-hour virus adsorption step. Typically, alphavirus particles attach to and enter cells during the adsorption phase of infection (0 hpi), with the replication of alphavirus genome commencing 5 to 6 hpi [36] . Therefore, following an hour of virus adsorption, the detection of viral antigens present at 0 hpi is indicative of binding and entry, and 6 hpi is indicative of the synthesis of new virus particles. Detection of intracellular viral antigens in RRV-infected PTX3-overexpressing HEK 293T cells revealed a significant increase in the number of RRV antigen positive cells at 0 and 6 hpi compared to vector-transfected cells (Fig. 6C) , indicating that PTX3 facilitates viral entry. This result was further confirmed with qRT-PCR viral load analysis, which detected increased viral load within PTX3-expressing cells at 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 hpi, compared to vector control (S4B Fig.) . At 4 hpi, the first round of virus replication was observed when a sudden spike in viral load was detected (S4B Fig.) .

(C) Primary tail fibroblasts from PTX3 -/mice were infected with RRV recombinant mouse PTX3 was pre-incubated with RRV prior to infection of PTX3 -/primary fibroblast cultures. Virus titres recovered from supernatants of PTX3-RRV complex-infected PTX3 -/fibroblasts at 24 hpi were significantly enhanced compared to RRV-infected PTX3 -/fibroblasts (control) (Fig. 8C) . Furthermore, the effects of PTX3 deficiency on viral entry into primary fibroblasts during the early stages of infection were examined. Consistent with our earlier findings, significantly lower viral load was detected in PTX3 -/primary fibroblasts compared to WT after RRV infection at both 0 and 6 hpi (Fig. 8D) . Similarly, RRV infection of WT fibroblasts led to increased PTX3 expression compared to mock-infected controls at 0 and 6 hpi (Fig. 8E ). Immunofluorescence staining of the WT fibroblasts also revealed more intense expression of PTX3, particularly within the cytoplasm, after RRV infection at 0 and 6 hpi (Fig. 8F) .",

For cytomegalovirus [29] and influenza virus [30] , recognition by PTX3 was shown to neutralize virus infectivity. To test whether PTX3 can bind to RRV, a microtitre plate-binding assay was performed. Microtitre wells coated with RRV were incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant mouse PTX3 (rmPTX3) and RRV-PTX3 binding was determined. As seen in Fig. 9A , PTX3 bound to RRV in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, a microtitre plate binding assay performed on CHIKV also demonstrated that PTX3 bound to CHIKV dose-dependently (S6D Fig.) . Next, we examined whether PTX3 colocalizes with RRV during infection. During RRV infection of PTX3-overexpressing HEK 293T cells, RRV colocalized with PTX3 in the cytoplasm at 24 hpi (Fig. 9B) . Similarly, RRV infection of HeLa cells, which are highly permissive to RRV infection and express endogenous PTX3 (S7A Fig.) , demonstrated clear evidence of PTX3 colocalization with RRV in the cytoplasm during infection (S7B Fig.) . These data show that during acute RRV infection, PTX3 forms a complex with RRV and colocalizes in the cytoplasm of the host cells, which may facilitate viral entry and replication processes.",

In the acute RRVD mouse model, elevated serum MBL-C was seen at both 2 and 15 dpi (Fig. 10B) .

Examination of viral entry at 0 and 6 hpi revealed that N-terminal-rhPTX3 was approximately 30% less efficient in its ability to facilitate RRV entry, compared to full-length-rhPTX3.

During the acute phase of alphaviral infection, PTX3 was highly induced in serum and PBMCs of RRVD and CHIKF patients, respectively. Notably, the magnitude of PTX3 induction in CHIKF patients was dependent on viral load and disease severity. Similar observations have been reported for the short pentraxin C-reactive protein (CRP), which is a common laboratory marker for diagnosis of alphaviral infection [40, 41] . Previously, Chow and colleagues reported that elevated expression of CRP was associated in CHIKF patients with high viral load and severe disease [15] . In addition to elevated PTX3 expression in alphavirus-infected patients, we also report abundant expression of PTX3 in serum and spleen of RRV-infected mice at the early stage of infection. During peak disease, PTX3 expression was also observed within the cellular infiltrates and further characterization identified inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils as the cellular sources of PTX3 during acute RRV infection. These findings indicate PTX3 is induced in response to alphaviral infections in humans and in mice. Elevated serum PTX3 expression has been observed in patients suffering from several arthritic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis (2.08 \u00b1 0.99 ng/ml), psoriatic arthritis (1.79 \u00b1 0.80 ng/ml), polymyalgia rheumatic (2.08 \u00b1 0.95 ng/ml), ankylosing spondylitis (2.48 \u00b1 1.07 ng/ml) as well as other diseases such as giant cell arteritis (1.98 \u00b1 1.05 ng/ml) and systemic lupus erythematosus (1.03 \u00b1 0.84 ng/ml) [42] . Herein, the strong induction of PTX3 in RRVD (serum PTX3: 36.79 \u00b1 8.443 ng/ml) and CHIKF patients suggests that PTX3 may also be included as a laboratory marker of acute alphaviral infection.",

            "text": "Dual roles of PTX3 have been reported in several pathogen-induced inflammatory diseases. Overexpression of PTX3 has protective effector function during bacterial infection with Aspergillus fumigatus [21, 43] , Pseudomonas aeruginosa [44] and uropathogenic Escherichia coli [45] , as well as viral infections such as murine cytomegalovirus [29] and influenza virus [30] . Nevertheless, PTX3 expression has also been associated with exacerbated inflammatory responses and disease outcomes in intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury [46] and pulmonary infection with Klebsiella pneumonia [47] . As PTX3 expression was associated with disease severity during acute alphaviral infections, we utilized an established RRVD mouse model [33] to examine the role of PTX3 during alphavirus infection. Deficiency of PTX3 was associated with delayed disease onset. While PTX3 -/mice displayed similar clinical manifestations at peak of disease, these mice recovered more rapidly than WT animals. It has previously been reported that pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u0194, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, and massive cellular infiltration contribute to inflammatory disease during alphaviral infections [37] . Indeed, delayed IFN-\u0194, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 responses were observed in quadricep muscles of PTX3 -/mice during the peak of RRVD. In addition, PTX3 -/mice showed diminished infiltration of inflammatory monocytes to the quadricep muscles during peak disease. Indeed, PTX3 has been shown to regulate leukocyte recruitment through interaction with P-selectin, leading to attenuation of cellular recruitment [32] . Using a peritoneal exudate model, we demonstrated increased recruitment of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes in PTX3 -/mice during early stages of infection. This observation may be associated with early upregulation of CCL2 and MIF, which are crucial for the recruitment of RRV-induced cellular infiltration [17, 48] during early infection. PTX3 has been shown to bind apoptotic cells promoting deposition of complement components C3 and C1q [49] . Previously, it has been reported that C3 deposition during RRV infection contributes to the destruction of skeletal muscle tissues [18] . Hence, it is likely that the absence of PTX3 in our current study ameliorates complement-induced damage of muscle tissues in RRV-infected mice. Furthermore, we observed higher induction of iNOS in quadricep muscles of PTX3 -/mice at peak RRVD. iNOS expression was recently shown to be pivotal in mediating skeletal muscle regeneration after acute damage [50] . These observations suggest PTX3 plays an immunomodulatory role during alphaviral infection. Moreover, the diminished infiltration of inflammatory monocytes and higher expression of iNOS during peak RRVD may contribute to rapid recovery from disease in the PTX3 -/mice. Collectively, these data identify PTX3 as a pathogenic factor that shapes the progression of alphaviral disease through modulation of RRV-induced immune responses.",

In our study, in vitro and in vivo approaches were used to demonstrate that PTX3 promotes RRV infection and replication in host cells. Alphaviruses gain entry into host cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis, although the exact cell surface receptors involved remain poorly defined [51] . Herein, we demonstrate that both RRV and CHIKV can bind to PTX3. RRV and CHIKV infection of PTX3-expressing HEK 293T cells led to enhanced viral entry and replication. In addition, treatment of PTX3 -/primary fibroblasts with rPTX3 also resulted in enhanced viral replication during early RRV infection, likely due to the formation of PTX3-RRV complex which enhances early viral entry events and replication. These data suggest that the extracellular interaction between PTX3 and RRV was involved in facilitating viral entry into host cells. The aggregates formed between RRV and PTX3 may promote more efficient multivalent binding to cell surface receptor/s for RRV, thereby promoting enhanced receptor-mediated endocytosis and viral entry. Alternatively, PTX3 may opsonize RRV and promote its uptake via putative (at this stage unknown) cell surface receptors for PTX3.",

Intracellular PTX3 migrates from perinuclear space to cytoplasm during infection and PTX3 co-localized with RRV in the cytoplasmic space suggests the possibility of intracellular associations between PTX3 and RRV. These interactions may further promote productive viral infection, perhaps by enhancing genomic replication. Indeed, we demonstrated that cells co-transfected with PTX3 and RRV, and harvested prior to the release of new virions had elevated levels of intracellular virus antigen. This result further supports the hypothesis that intracellular associations of PTX3 and RRV may promote viral replication processes. Moreover, the presence of PTX3 was crucial for enhanced viral replication during RRV infection of WT mice and PTX3-overexpressing HEK 293T cells. Together, this study shows that PTX3-RRV interaction gives rise to pathogenic effect, enhancing viral entry and replication, in contrast to previous studies using other viruses such as murine cytomegalovirus [29] and influenza virus [30] , where PTX3 binding was associated with virus neutralization, thereby contributing to a protective host response.",

However, removal of the C-terminal domain did affect the ability of the N-terminal domain of PTX3 to modulate viral replication, resulting in only partial enhancement of viral replication compared to full-length PTX3.

In conclusion, our findings provide new insight into the role of PTX3 in acute alphaviral infection. The newly identified role of PTX3 in enhancing RRV infection and replication also sheds light on the poorly defined route of alphavirus entry into host cells. Given the diverse functional roles of PTX3 as well as its ability to bind to a variety of immune factors, further study is required to define the exact PTX3-triggered immune pathways induced in alphaviral-induced arthritic diseases.

(C) Increasing concentrations of mouse recombinant MBL-C were added to RRV-coated plates for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C, followed by binding to biotin-conjugated anti-MBL-C antibody for additional 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. Optical density at 450 nm was read using Horseradish Peroxidase Substrate kit. (D) Dose-dependent infection of C2C12 cells was performed at MOI 0.1, 1, 2.5, 5 and 10 for 24 h, using EFGP-RRV. The percentage of infected cells (EGFP + ) was assessed using flow cytometry analysis. (E) C2C12 cells were infected with EGFP-RRV (10 4 PFU RRV) and pre-bound MBL-C-RRV or PTX3-RRV complex (1 \u03bcg/ml of mouse recombinant proteins + 10 4 PFU RRV) for 6, 12 and 24 hours. The percentage of infected cells (EGFP + ) was assessed using flow cytometry analysis. Horizontal dotted line represents the mean percentage of EGFP + cells detected in mock control. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, one-way ANOVA, Bonferroni's post-test.",

Reactions were performed using QuantiTect Primer Assay kits (Qiagen) and BIO-RAD CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System on 96-well plates. Cycler conditions were as follows: (i) PCR initial activation step: 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 1 cycle and (ii) 3-step cycling: 94\u00b0C for 15 sec, follow by 55\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 30 sec, 40 cycles. Dissociation curves for each gene were acquired using CFX Manager software to determine specificity of amplified products. The fold change relative to healthy donors/mock samples for each gene was calculated with the \u0394\u0394Ct method using Microsoft Excel 2010. Briefly, \u0394\u0394Ct = \u0394Ct(patient/infected)-\u0394Ct(healthy donor/mock) with \u0394Ct = Ct(gene-of-interest)-Ct(housekeeping gene-GAPDH/HPRT). The fold change for each gene is calculated as 2 -\u0394\u0394Ct .",
