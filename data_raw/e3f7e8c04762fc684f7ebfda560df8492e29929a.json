            "text": "Background: Hemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas) have been found infecting cats worldwide. However, studies about feline hemoplasma infections in Spain are scarce. Therefore, the purpose of the research was to evaluate the prevalence of feline hemotropic mycoplasmas and to characterize risk factors and clinical findings associated with these infections in a cat population from the Madrid area, Spain. Methods: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to detect Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), \"Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum\" (CMhm) and \"Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis\" (CMt) in blood samples from 456 client-owned and 138 stray cats from Madrid. In order to assess associations between these hemoplasma infections and epidemiological parameters, data regarding signalment, environment, prophylaxis measures, retrovirus status, clinical signs and laboratory findings were compiled, whenever possible. Results: DNA of feline hemoplasmas was detected from the blood of 63 out of 594 cats (10.6%), with a prevalence of 3.7% (22/594) for Mhf, 8.1% (48/594) for CMhm and 0.5% (3/594) for CMt. Stray cats had statistically higher prevalences of feline hemoplasmas (15.9%) and, specifically, of Mhf (8.7%) than client-owned cats (9 and 2.2%, respectively). A total of seven cats (1.17%) were co-infected with \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\" and M. haemofelis, two (0.33%) with \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\" and \"Candidatus M. turicensis\" and another one (0. 17%) with M. haemofelis and Candidatus \"M. turicensis\". Male gender, collection of blood during warm months and FeLV/FIV positivity status were associated with hemotropic mycoplasma infection in cats from Madrid. Additionally, within the group of client-owned cats, hemoplasma infection was associated with adult age, outdoor access, and the existence of low haematocrit, erythrocyte count and haemoglobin concentration values. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological survey of feline hemoplasmas performed in central Spain (Madrid). Our study confirms that \"Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum\", Mycoplasma haemofelis and \"Ca. Mycoplasma turicensis\" are infecting client-owned and stray cats in this region of Spain, \"Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum\" being the most prevalent species. More studies are necessary to help understand the role of the natural infection by these species of hemoplasma in cats.",

This hemotropic mycoplasma prevalence is also similar to those described in other studies performed in Denmark [23] , Germany [24, 25] , Italy [26] and Switzerland [10] and lower than the rates reported by others in Greece [27] , Italy [28, 29] and Portugal [6, 30] . These differences in prevalence can be due to several factors: the cat population sampled (which could present several risk factors simultaneously), geographical variations and/or differences in the diagnostic technique used in these studies (from microscopic to molecular detection among others).

            "text": "Consistent with previous observations [6, 33, 34] of a higher prevalence of feline hemoplasma infection in countries with warmer climates, when analysing season of collection of blood samples in the current study, a statistically significant higher prevalence of hemoplasma infection during spring and summer was found, with most positive cats (63.5% of positive samples, 40/63) included in the study between April and September. This seasonal influence on prevalence has been previously described when comparing summer with autumn in one study performed in Italy [28] , suggesting vector transmission. However, it has not been proven for natural infection and other studies have not found any association between prevalence rate and season of the year [6, 28, 33, 34] . In fact, in the client-owned cat group of this study, history of previous ectoparasites infestation (ticks/fleas) was not found associated with hemoplasma infection, similarly to previous descriptions [6, 33] . However, this information must be carefully assessed considering the natural behaviour of grooming in the cat, that could have facilitated the fact that arthropod infestation went unnoticed for the owner/person in charge of the cat [28] . In addition, other means of transmission must exist, considering their detection in areas where there is absence of the possible vectors [1] . In this sense, it has been described that male cats are more likely to engage in roaming and fighting behaviour, which may increase their chance of contracting the disease if a direct mode of transmission exists [7, 11, 20, 26, 33, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Our own study supports a higher risk for male animals and for stray cats or client-owned cats that had outdoor access. All these factors may favour contact with other cats, although it should be considered that stray or client-owned cats with outdoor access are supposed to be more exposed not only to contact with other cats, but also to ectoparasites. In addition, it is important to consider the results of the logistic regression study carried out, that showed a stronger relationship of mycoplasma infection with the variable FIV status, which could mean that gender variable could be a confounding factor due to the relationship between positive FIV status and male sex.",

Concurrent diseases or previous infections, hemoplasma species involved (CMhm, Mhf, CMt or even coinfections), and the stage (acuteness or chronicity) of hemoplasma infection could considerably change these findings. While the most frequently described clinical signs in cats with hemoplasmosis are related to the occurrence of anaemia, lethargy, or pale mucous membranes [1] among others, the current study showed statistical associations between the infection by CMhm and musculoskeletal and renal signs. These results should be interpreted with caution, considering that other diseases could be responsible for the clinical signs detected in the cats in the current study, as it was observed in the cat coinfected with FIP, CMhm and Mhf, that showed musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal signs. Sykes et al. [41] suggested a relation between renal signs and hemoplasma infection, but also considered that the infected population represented by old cats probably has a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease.",

This and other studies [27] have detected hemoplasma infection both in cats suffering anaemia and in cats with red blood cells counts within reference values. Mhf is considered the most pathogenic feline hemoplasma species, causing extravascular erythrophagocytosis especially during the acute phase. However, an interesting finding to highlight is the association between the existence of anaemia not only in Mhf, but also in CMhm infected cats. It has been previously described that experimental CMhm infection generally does not induce anaemia and significant clinical signs, so geographical differences in the pathogenicity of the strain of this species should be considered. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the cats of the study could have been exposed to other pathogens previously described in central Spain [43, 44] or could be affected by other diseases associated with the development of anaemia.",

Our study confirms that the three-main species of hemoplasma are infecting client-owned and stray cats in this region of Spain, with \"Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum\" being the most prevalent species. Male gender, collection of blood during warm months, FeLV/ FIV positivity status, and outdoor access were associated with hemotropic mycoplasma infection in cats from Madrid. With regard to clinical signs and laboratory parameters, natural infection by feline hemoplasmas in the area is associated with anaemia, being difficult to determinate if co-infections can influence this finding. More studies are necessary to understand the role of the infection by these species of hemoplasma in cats. ",
