The third variable region (V3) is a crucial target on gp120, primarily due to its involvement in co-receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5) binding and presence of epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. Methods: Thirty-three HIV-1 seropositive drug naive patients (18 males and 15 females) within the age range of 20-57 years (median = 33 years) were recruited in this study for mAb production. The mAbs were selected from EBV transformed cultures with conformationally constrained Cholera-toxin-B containing V3C (V3C-CTB) fusion protein. We tested the mAbs for their binding with HIV-1 derived proteins and peptides by ELISA and for neutralization against HIV-1 viruses by TZM-bl assays.",

The ELISA binding revealed a subtype-C and subtype-A specific binding of antibody 277 and 903 while mAb 904 exhibited cross reactivity also with subtype-B V3. Epitope mapping of mAbs with overlapping V3 peptides showed exclusive binding to V3 crown. The antibodies displayed high and low neutralizing activity against 2/5 tier 1 and 1/6 tier 2 viruses respectively. Overall, we observed a resistance of the tier 2 viruses to neutralization by the anti-V3 mAbs, despite the exposure of the epitopes recognized by these antibodies on two representative native viruses (Du156.12 and JRFL), suggesting that the affinity of mAb might equally be crucial for neutralization, as the epitope recognition.",

Because of its involvement in the primary steps of receptor [5] and co-receptor binding [6] , the envelope gp120 has been identified as a major target for HIV-1 NAbs [2, [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, the antigenic variability of exposed regions and low immunogenicity of conserved domains on gp120 impose great challenges to identify the vulnerable targets on HIV-1 [2, 4, 11] . Nevertheless, the conserved epitopes on gp120 have been identified using antibodies from neutralizing sera [12] [13] [14] and bNAbs [9, 10, [15] [16] [17] , which include the antibodies directed to the CD4 receptor binding site (CD4bs) and co-receptor binding site mainly the third variable region (V3) [10, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

However its role was shown to be restricted to type specific viruses [30, 31] and such an observation was supported by the extensive sequence variation in V3 from different viral isolates [32, 33] . Given the critical interaction with the co-receptors (CXCR4 or CCR5) on host cells, V3 conventionally must retain structurally conserved elements required for binding [34, 35] . More recently, studies have revealed that the V3 domain possesses conserved structural motifs despite the sequence variation, and is often accessible on the virus surface as a target for bNAbs [21, [36] [37] [38] .",

This difference in antibody response to V3 loop, has been shown to be primarily determined by the four amino residues in the V3 crown (GPGQ or GPGR), which mostly form a type II \u03b2-turn [19, 40] . Interestingly, the anti-V3 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from non-clade B infected individuals, bearing GPGQ at the tip of V3 display better neutralization capacity than subtype-B (having GPGR) derived anti-V3 mAbs [19] . Such an observation was substantiated by a study showing a high neutralization potential of the anti-V3 mAbs derived from Cameroon subjects infected with viruses harboring GPGQ (subtype-AG) at the V3 crown [21] . Further, in an immunization study carried out in rabbits with a gp120 DNA prime followed by a boost with various cholera toxin B (CTB) fusion proteins containing the V3 sequences from different HIV-1 subtypes, the CTB fusion protein containing a consensus-C (con-C) V3 sequence (V3C-CTB) (having a GPGQ motif at V3 crown), elicited a highly potent HIV-1 neutralizing response compared to the other V3-CTB constructs [41] .",

In order to address this possibility, we tested the anti-V3 mAbs for binding with Du156.12 (subtype-C) and JRFL (subtype-B) viruses in an intact virion binding assay. The two viruses (Du156.12 and JRFL) were chosen for this experiment on the basis of their V3 sequence similarity with the corresponding con-C and B V3 sequence ( Figure 2C ). Consistent with the binding of anti-V3 mAbs to Du156.12 and JRFL derived envelope gp120 proteins, the three mAbs showed differential binding affinity to intact virions, 904 displaying high affinity as compared with 277 and 903. In addition, the mAb 904 retained the crossreactive binding potential to the intact viruses, evident from the binding pattern ( Figure 2A ). The experiment was validated by testing the intact virion binding of anti-V3 mAb 447-52D to SF162 virus, known to have a well exposed V3 region and allows accessibility to Ab without any interference [43] [44] [45] . The binding of 447-52D to SF162 intact virus revealed a very high binding affinity (more than five folds) of mAb 447-52D as compared to binding of three anti-V3 mAbs to Du156.12 and JRFL at equivalent viral concentration (i,e 25 ng/ml) (Figure 2A -B).

            "text": "Human monoclonal antibodies against the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins are useful tools in the structural and functional analysis of the viral envelope and have crucial roles in guiding the design of prophylactic anti-HIV vaccines. Despite a huge expansion of HIV-1 subtype-C worldwide, the clade-C viruses remain to be one of the least studied subtypes especially in terms of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies. Using the rationale from previous studies showing that viruses with GPGQ residues at the tip of the V3 crown of the HIV-1 envelope induce potent and cross reactive NAbs as compared to viruses with GPGR motif, we generated here three anti-V3 mAbs from Indian donors presumably infected with subtype-C viruses bearing GPGQ at the V3 crown [42] . The functional analysis of the Abs generated reveals a potent neutralization potential with tier 1 viruses while such activity was limited with the tier 2 viruses tested. The anti-V3 Abs were selected from EBV-transformed B-cell cultures of 33 HIV-1 infected antiretroviral drug na\u00efve patients using V3C-CTB fusion protein [47] . The advantage of using a conformationally constrained instead of a linear V3 peptide for selection of mAbs from cultures or as animal immunogens has been previously demonstrated [36, 41, [48] [49] [50] . We found 1-25% (mean = 6%) of the transformed wells positive for binding with V3C-CTB in the first screening. The characteristic nature of the B-cells from HIV-1 infected subjects and the conditions used to immortalize them apparently affects the number and type of Ab-producing cell lines that grow out [51] . The overall positive percentage of Ab secreting culture wells was relatively good and could be attributed to the high titers of anti-V3 Ab reactivity of the corresponding plasma [28] . In contrast to a high percentage of positive secretors in the initial screening, we were able to stabilize only three (277, 903 and 904) anti-V3 Ab producing B-cell clones. This loss could be in part due to the outgrowth of the non-secretor B cells over the secretor B cells in subsequent steps of secondary screening, cell fusion and dilution cloning process. Moreover, the B cells from HIV-1 infected patients are mostly dysfunctional and polyclonally activated [52] , and such properties have been associated with a low persistence of EBV infectivity [51, 53, 54] .",

Indeed, the recent immunological and structural studies of anti-V3 mAbs have observed similar pattern of binding, wherein essentially all the anti-V3 mAbs bind to~14 residues in the V3 crown [57] [58] [59] . Two of our anti-V3 mAbs (277, 903) showed binding to subtype-A or C but not to subtype-B derived proteins and peptides while mAb 904 displayed cross reactive binding with subtype-B as well. The binding pattern (in context of clade specific or cross reactive V3 antibodies) of the two anti-V3 mAbs 903 and 904 was similar to binding of polyclonal anti-V3 plasma antibodies from the respective patients, however it was different for mAb 277 in the context of the plasma Abs of this patient ( Figure 1A-C) . The finding highlights the importance of pre-screening of plasma for binding to peptides from different viral subtypes prior to isolation of mAbs. One plausible reason for the non-binding of mAb 277 to the V3B peptide in contrast to its corresponding polyclonal plasma may be attributed to the higher number of subtype-C specific B-cell clones in the B cell repertoire of this patient, as indicated by its very high binding to V3C ( Figure 1C ). It may also partly be ascribed to biased selection with a CTB construct containing only V3C sequence, which might allow it to preferentially pick up the B cell clone with clade-C V3 specificity. Interestingly, the anti-V3 mAbs 277 and 903, which show clade-A or C (both having a common GPGQ crown motif ) specific binding use the same variable heavy chain gene (VH3-30) whereas the cross reactive mAb 904 uses a different VH gene ( Table 1) . The finding suggests a possible association of antibody gene usage with epitope specificity, however the number of the mAbs generated in this study is too small for comparison. Remarkably, a recent analysis of anti-HIV Abs has pointed out a preferential usage of VH5-51 gene usage of anti-V3 Abs [60] , and such a preference was later shown to define a conserved antigenic structure within the V3 [61] .",

This effect has been particularly recognized for the V3 region wherein the neighboring regions including V1/V2 shield the epitopes recognized by anti-V3 Abs [46] . Although studies have suggested that the HIV-1 V3 loop remains accessible on most of the viruses [36] , however this information is limited to subtype-B viruses and remains to be explored for other subtypes. Consistent with the binding to gp120 proteins (Du156.12 and JRFL), the three anti-V3 mAbs were able to bind intact native virions with a similar binding pattern (Figure 2A) . The results suggest that V3 epitopes are well exposed over the intact trimeric viruses (Du156.12 and JRFL), and these findings are highly supported by previous work in the literature [36, 43] . The rationale of using same proteins (gp120) and its corresponding viruses (intact virion) for the binding assays was to minimize the effect of both, the V3 loop sequence and the neighboring regions, on the local and global orientation of V3 and on the subsequent binding of Abs.",

However, it should be noted that mAbs 903 and 904 which display a better affinity than 277, showed neutralization of up to 19% at 30 \u03bcg/ml, though not reaching IC50 neutralization titers, with these viruses (data not shown). Overall, the data suggest that higher concentrations of these mAbs may be effective in neutralization, however that needs to be confirmed in detail. Together, these results suggest that effective concentrations for binding and neutralization may vary substantially, and the high affinity binding by mAb might be critical for neutralization.

Also the study highlights the significance of the antibody affinity, which may probably be equally important as its epitope accessibility, for effective viral neutralization. Furthermore, the analysis of the mAbs generated in this study will allow us to identify epitopes that are unique to clade C viruses and also those that are shared with other subtypes in the context of V3 loop, and the data may provide useful information for HIV-1 vaccine design.",

All the primary viruses and envelope clones were obtained from the NIH, ARRRP. The HIV-1 isolates were expanded by only one cycle of growth on phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-stimulated PBMCs, as described previously [45] to avoid alterations in env sequences due to multiple rounds of expansion. Pseudotyped viruses were produced by co-transfection of the rev/env expression plasmid and an env-deficient HIV-1 backbone vector (pSG3\u0394Env) into exponentially dividing 293 T cells (ATCC; catalog no. 11268), in 6-well tissue culture plates (Corning Inc) using calcium phosphate (Promega Inc) method.

The supernatants of the two viruses were used at a final p24 concentration of 25 ng/ml. Antibody 904 displayed binding to both viruses (Du156.12 and JRFL), while antibodies 277 and 903 showed subtype-C (Du156.12) specific binding (A). The unrelated mAb 1418 against parvovirus B19 served as a negative control.The anti-V3 mAb 447-52D (known to bind SF162, a clade-B virus) and SF162 were used to validate the experiment. The binding of 447-52D to intact virus was performed by using a fixed concentration of antibody (10 \u03bcg/ml) with two-fold dilution of SF162 virus starting with 50 ng/ml of virus (B). The virus capture is determined by measuring the level of p24 (picograms per milliliter) released when bound virus is lysed with detergent. The viruses (Du156.12 and JRFL) were chosen for intact virion binding assay on the basis of their resemblance to the consensus-B and C V3 loop sequences (C). The V3 sequence of these viruses is aligned with their corresponding consensus-C and B V3 loop sequence using Seqpublish program (http://hiv.lanl.gov).",
