            "text": "Type I interferons (IFN) comprise a family of cytokines that signal through a common cellular receptor to induce a plethora of genes with antiviral and other activities. Recombinant IFNs are used for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection, multiple sclerosis, and certain malignancies. The capability of type I IFN to suppress virus replication and resultant cytopathic effects is frequently used to measure their bioactivity. However, these assays are time-consuming and require appropriate biosafety containment. In this study, an improved IFN assay is presented which is based on a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replicon encoding two reporter proteins, firefly luciferase and green fluorescent protein. The vector lacks the essential envelope glycoprotein (G) gene of VSV and is propagated on a G protein-expressing transgenic cell line. Several mammalian and avian cells turned out to be susceptible to infection with the complemented replicon particles. Infected cells readily expressed the reporter proteins at high levels five hours post infection. When human fibroblasts were treated with serial dilutions of human IFN-b prior to infection, reporter expression was accordingly suppressed. This method was more sensitive and faster than a classical IFN bioassay based on VSV cytopathic effects. In addition, the antiviral activity of human IFN-l (interleukin-29), a type III IFN, was determined on Calu-3 cells. Both IFN-b and IFN-l were acid-stable, but only IFN-b was resistant to alkaline treatment. The antiviral activities of canine, porcine, and avian type I IFN were analysed with cell lines derived from the corresponding species. This safe bioassay will be useful for the rapid and sensitive quantification of multi-species type I IFN and potentially other antiviral cytokines.

            "text": "IFN-a and IFN-b are structurally related cytokines of the type I interferon family which mediate an early innate immune response to viral infections. There are 13 distinct IFN-a genes present in the human genome, and a single gene encoding for IFN-b. These genes are transcriptionally activated in cells sensing a virus infection through pattern recognition receptors such as the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) helicase. Following secretion, IFN-a and IFN-b act similarly by binding to a common, ubiquitously expressed IFN-a/b receptor resulting in the activation of the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway and transcription of ''IFN-induced genes'' [1, 2] . Several of these genes encode for proteins with strong antiviral activity, i.e. Mx protein, protein kinase R, and 29-59oligo(A) synthetase [3] . Due to their autocrine action, type I IFN may attenuate virus replication in infected cells. Probably more important is the paracrine action of type I IFN, which induces an antiviral state in previously uninfected cells, thereby blocking virus dissemination in the organism. In addition to this ''classical'' antiviral function, type I IFNs are known to affect cell proliferation and differentiation, to modulate the immune response, to inhibit angiogenesis, and to promote apoptosis [4, 5] . Genetically engineered type I IFNs are currently in clinical use for the treatment of multiple sclerosis [6] , chronic hepatitis C virus infection [7] , and certain types of cancer [8, 9] . An issue of increasing importance is the determination of neutralizing antibodies that are induced in some patients following recombinant IFN therapy [10] .",

            "text": "The accurate determination of antiviral IFN activity is a cumbersome issue. In the ''classical'' bioassay, serial dilutions of both a test sample with unknown IFN activity and a type I IFN standard are incubated with an appropriate cell line prior to infection with a cytolytic virus such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), encephalomyocarditis virus, or Sendai virus [14, 15] . The reciprocal value of the highest type I IFN dilution mediating protection of 50% of the cells from virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) is defined as one unit of type I IFN per volume. This classical IFN bioassay is time-consuming because the CPE normally needs 24 hours or more to develop. A faster readout can be achieved with recombinant viruses expressing reporter proteins such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or firefly luciferase [16, 17, 18, 19] . However, any work with live virus requires appropriate biosafety containment. For example, a recently published IFN bioassay can only be performed in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities, because the test makes use of a recombinant Rift Valley Fever virus [19] . Viral replicon-based bioassays that take advantage of disabled propagation-incompetent viruses may provide an attractive alternative to live virusbased bioassays. A human hepatoma cell line harbouring a selectable hepatitis C virus replicon has been successfully employed for the measurement of type I IFN from patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection [20] . However, as type I IFNs act in a species-dependent manner, this system may not be applicable to animal IFNs. Transgenic cell lines expressing a reporter gene under control of an IFN-responsive promoter may also be used to determine IFN activity under biosafe conditions [21, 22] . However, it is difficult to simply relate transcriptional reporter gene activation to antiviral activity.",

MVA-T7 has been classified by the German Central Committee for Biosafety as a BSL-1 organism (reference number 6790- [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Ninety minutes post infection, the medium was replaced with fresh EMEM containing 5% FBS and 10 29 M mifepristone (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) to induce VSV G expression [23] . Subsequently, the cells were transfected with 10 mg of pVSV*DG(Luc), 3 mg of pTM1-N, 5 mg of pTM1-P, and 2 mg of pTM1-L [28] using Lipofectamine TM 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland). The cells were trypsinized 24 hours post transfection and seeded into T75 flasks along with an equal number of fresh BHK-G43 cells. The cells were further incubated at 37uC for 24 hours in the presence of 10 29 M mifepristone. The cell culture supernatant was clarified by low-speed centrifugation and passed through a 0.20-mm-pore size filter to deplete vaccinia virus. VSV*DG(Luc) was further propagated on mifepristoneinduced BHK-G43 cells and stored frozen at 270uC. To determine infectious virus titers, confluent BHK-21 grown in 96well microtiter plates were inoculated in duplicate with 40 ml of serial tenfold virus dilutions for 1 h at 37uC. The wells additionally received 60 ml of EMEM and were incubated for 20 h at 37uC. The infectious titers were calculated according to the number of GFP-expressing cells/well and expressed as fluorescence-forming units per milliliter (ffu/ml).",

In the present work, this vector was modified by inserting the firefly luciferase gene into the transcription unit at position 5 (thereby replacing the GFP gene) and exchanging the HA gene with the GFP gene (Fig. 1a) . The resulting vector, VSV*DG(Luc), was propagated on BHK-G43 helper cells which express the VSV G protein in an inducible manner [23] . Up to 10 9 virus replicon particles (VRP) were released into the cell culture supernatant 24 h post infection (data not shown). Several mammalian and avian cells were found to be susceptible to infection with the VRPs in line with previous observations on the very broad cell tropism of VSV [29] . Infected cells were readily detected (5 to 6 h post infection) by means of GFP reporter expression (Fig. 1b) . However, non-helper cells were unable to complement the VSV G deletion and thus could not produce infectious progeny virus. Importantly, VSV*DG(Luc) did not induce type I IFN in the cell lines analysed (data not shown). This can be ascribed to the host shut-off activity of the VSV matrix protein [30] .",

Thus, a reduction in viral genome replication as a consequence of type IFN action should lead to correspondingly lower luciferase levels. To test this hypothesis, normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) were incubated for various time periods with serial dilutions of human IFN-b before infection with VSV*DG(Luc). A dose-dependent effect of IFN-b on firefly luciferase reporter activity was observed after 1 hour of incubation (Fig. 2a) . About 1 unit of IFN-b led to 50% suppression of luciferase activity. Extending the incubation time to 2 hours did not further improve the sensitivity of the test (p.0.05 for the 0.08 to 1.25 IFN units range). However, if the cells were treated for 20 hours, the dose response curve was significantly shifted to lower IFN units (p#0.001 for the 0.02 to 20 units range). Approximately 0.05 units of IFN-b were now sufficient to suppress reporter activity by 50%. These results indicate that an IFNb-induced antiviral state in NHDF cells can be detected as early as 1 hour after addition of IFN-b, although the sensitivity of the assay is higher if the cells were incubated with IFN-b for prolonged time.",

While the dose response curve of chicken IFNa on DF-1 chicken fibroblasts (Fig. 2b) was similar to the one of human IFN-b on NHDF (Fig. 2a) , porcine IFN-a showed a different kinetics on PK-15 porcine kidney cells. In these cells, a full antiviral state was accomplished only after 20 hours of treatment indicating that PK-15 cells respond rather slowly to the action of type I IFN (Fig. 2c) . Thus, the assay is applicable to type I IFN from different species but may perform differentially on distinct cell types. To further evaluate the bioassay, samples containing type I IFN of unknown activity were tested against a commercial IFN-b standard and the results were compared with those obtained with a conventional IFN bioassay based on VSV cytotoxicity. Human type I IFN was induced in NHDF human fibroblasts following infection with VSV*M q [30] . This propagation-competent virus expresses a mutant matrix protein that is unable to block the nucleocytoplasmic RNA transport of the cell. Before the samples were tested for antiviral activity, VSV*M q was inactivated for 30 min with 0.1 M HCl to avoid any interference with the bioassay (see also the section on thermal and pH stability of IFN). When the VSV*DG(Luc) replicon bioassay was used, about 0.8 pg/ml of a commercial IFN-b standard resulted in 50% antiviral activity. In consideration of the final dilution producing 50% antiviral activity, the type I IFN concentration of two test samples was defined as 4000 pg/ml and 1440 pg/ml, respectively (Fig. 3a) . When the samples were tested with the conventional bioassay (Fig. 3b) , the values were in the same range (5000 and 1500 pg/ml), indicating that both assays principally agree. Nevertheless, the replicon-based bioassay proved to be more sensitive than the conventional one as lower amounts of type I IFN were sufficient to reduce the luciferase reporter activity by 50% (compare curves shown in Fig. 3a with those in Fig. 3b ).",

Firefly luciferase reporter activity in infected cell lysates indicated that porcine IFNa is active in NHDF albeit at reduced levels compared to human IFN-b (Fig. 4b; p#0 .0049 for the 0.008 to 2.0 units range). Murine IFN-b showed an even lower activity on NHDF (ED 50 of 500 units per 5610 4 NHDF cells; p#0.0003 for the 0.008 to 500 units range).

As virus infection may interfere with the bioassay, it has to be inactivated before the assay is performed, preferentially without touching the activity of type I IFN. As many viruses can simply be inactivated by treatment with heat, we first analysed the thermal stability of human IFN-b using the VSV*DG(Luc) bioassay. The antiviral activity of human IFN-b was fully maintained when the cytokine was incubated for 30 min at 50uC (Fig. 5a) . At 60uC, 99% of the activity was preserved (p = 0.021). At 70uC, the activity of human IFN-b dropped to 83% (p = 0.0017). Incubation at higher temperatures (80uC and 90uC) affected the activity more drastically, although some activity was still left at these temperatures. Only when human IFN-b was heated to 100uC for 30 min, activity was completely abolished. In contrast to human IFN-b, porcine IFN-a was completely inactivated at 70uC (p,0.0001), whereas human IFN-l (IL-29), a type III IFN, showed even higher residual activity at 80uC and 90uC (p,0.001), suggesting that these cytokines have different physicochemical properties.",

It turned out that the antiviral activity of human IFN-b was not significantly affected by acid (p.0.05) (Fig. 5b) , confirming the previously noted acid-stability of type I IFNs [31] . IFN-l showed similar properties as antiviral activity was maintained following treatment with 0.1 M HCl (Fig. 5c) . In contrast, alkaline treatment significantly reduced the activity of IFN-l (p,0.05 for the 250 2 1 ng/ml range), whereas IFN-b was not affected (p.0.05) (Fig. 5b) . Thus, treatment with acid may be employed to inactivate virus in a test sample without affecting the activity of type I and type III IFNs.

The helper cells used to propagate the replicon particles are derived from BHK-21 cells, which are defective in the synthesis of type I IFN [32] .

In contrast, the bioassay presented here takes advantage of the firefly luciferase reporter, which can be detected with high sensitivity long before a cytopathic effect is apparent. Although the luciferase reporter enabled us to unambiguously quantify the IFN-mediated reduction of virus replication, we frequently observed that the standard deviations for the antiviral activities increased when the cells were treated with low amounts of type I IFN. This likely reflects the high reporter gene expression at low levels of type I IFN and the inaccuracy associated with pipetting small volumes (6 ml).",

It is common practice that cells are incubated with type I IFN for several hours to induce an antiviral state [15, 19] . Our findings suggest that an antiviral state can be detected much earlier. For example, treatment of NHDF with 1 unit of human IFN-b for 1 hour and subsequent infection with VSV*DG(Luc) for 5 hours was sufficient to suppress firefly reporter expression by 50%, even though the effective dose was further lowered with longer incubation times. While DF-1 fibroblasts responded to chicken IFN-a with dose response kinetics similar to the one observed with human IFN-b on NHDF, PK-15 cells responded to porcine type I IFN in a much slower way. Thus, compared to conventional bioassays VSV*DG(Luc) may allow quantification of type I IFN in a considerably shorter time provided an appropriate cell line has been selected. The selection of a suitable cell line is also important with respect to the species it is derived from, as full activity of type I IFN was only observed with cells from the corresponding species. Since VSV is able to infect a broad spectrum of mammalian and avian cells, the new bioassay may be used to determine the bioactivity of type I IFNs from many different animals.",

This raises the important question of how to distinguish between different antiviral cytokines? Certainly, neutralizing antibodies may be employed to specify the antiviral cytokine present in the sample. In addition, the extraordinary acid-stability of type I IFNs may be used to differentiate them from acid-labile cytokines such as type II IFNs [35] . However, acid may not be used to distinguish between type I and type III IFNs as IFN-l proved to be acid-stable as well. Since IFN-l but not IFN-b was sensitive to 0.1 M NaOH, treatment with alkaline may be used instead. However, the conditions of treatment still have to be optimized to guarantee the complete inactivation of type III IFNs while maintaining the activity of type I IFNs.",
