            "text": "Major challenges in vaccine development include rapidly selecting or designing immunogens for raising cross-protective immunity against different intra-or inter-subtypic pathogens, especially for the newly emerging varieties. Here we propose a computational method, Conformational Epitope (CE)-BLAST, for calculating the antigenic similarity among different pathogens with stable and high performance, which is independent of the prior binding-assay information, unlike the currently available models that heavily rely on the historical experimental data. Tool validation incorporates influenza-related experimental data sufficient for stability and reliability determination. Application to dengue-related data demonstrates high harmonization between the computed clusters and the experimental serological data, undetectable by classical grouping. CE-BLAST identifies the potential cross-reactive epitope between the recent zika pathogen and the dengue virus, precisely corroborated by experimental data. The high performance of the pathogens without the experimental binding data suggests the potential utility of CE-BLAST to rapidly design cross-protective vaccines or promptly determine the efficacy of the currently marketed vaccine against emerging pathogens, which are the critical factors for containing emerging disease outbreaks.",

            "text": "E merging and re-emerging diseases caused by infectious pathogens are identified almost every year and remain a continuous threat to public health. Recent examples include influenza, avian flu, dengue, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), with the latest being microcephaly caused by the zika virus 1 . To combat these epidemics, vaccines are consistently needed for the purpose of disease control and prevention. A critical step in vaccine development is to characterize the antigenicity difference among various pathogens so as to select or design proper immunogens that are able to raise cross-protective immunity. To date, determining antigenic variation of the emerging pathogens has relied heavily on the results from the immune-binding assays. For instance, the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay is traditionally performed to determine the antigenic changes in circulating influenza viruses from those of the previous vaccines 2 . Antisera from multiple donors are routinely screened for binding against virus strains in search of a potential broad-spectrum antibody for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [3] [4] [5] . Recently, comprehensive serological tests were accomplished on both animals and vaccinated or infected humans to calibrate the serological relationships between the subtypic dengue viruses (DENV) 6 . Despite the wide adoption for common infectious diseases, immune-based experiments are often found to exhibit limited application in the case of significant outbreaks or emergence of new virus subtypes, owing to various factors of mobility, antiserum dilution, standardization, and automation. Thus, new automated technologies with high-throughput and quick response are always desired, so as to meet the increasing demand of newly emerging epidemics. Accordingly, the development of computational strategies independent of immunoassays may be helpful for assisting the antigenicity measurement in a rapid and timely manner.",

In the adaptive humoral immune system, the pathogenic antigens will be recognized and bound by specific antibodies at the conformational epitopes generally comprising several segments that are discontinuous in sequence, but close in three-dimensional (3D) conformation 10, 11 . This recognition process features high sensitivity and specificity, where only the mutated antigens with highly similar conformational epitopes are able to cross-react with the same antibody. Arising mutants with substantially different conformational epitopes are likely the causing antigenic variants to previous vaccines, and may lead to new outbreaks in the community [12] [13] [14] . Therefore, comparing the conformational epitopes directly may provide clues to infer antigenic similarity of the pathogenic antigens. This algorithm takes complete consideration of the structural and the physicochemical microenvironment variations from a 3D viewpoint caused by mutations, which are summarized into a comprehensive fingerprint for each epitope residue. For each input antigen with the structure information, the conformational epitope will be translated into a series of fingerprints and compared with the predefined or user-uploaded datasets through CE-BLAST, then a list of hit-epitope structures with predicted similarity scores will be provided in descending order as output.",

It is initially tested with intra-subtypic pathogen data of influenza A/H3N2 antigen including 3867 historical HI assays, and then combined with the experimental validation on a new antigen of A/H3N2. Then, its ability to classify serological relationships is further confirmed on DENV subtypes via 1072 serological data results. Notably, the application scope of CE-BLAST is extended to a cross-virus case to suggest the potential crossreactive epitopes between ZIKV and DENV in the Flavivirus family. For convenient use, a web server has been constructed with built-in epitope libraries containing simulated structure databases of the HA antigen for influenza virus (A/H1N1 & A/ H3N2), Envelope (E) antigen for DENV and ZIKV, and known conformational epitopes derived from the Protein Databank (PDB) immune complex. The web server of CE-BLAST can be accessed at http://badd.tongji.edu.cn/ce_blast/ or http://bidd2. nus.edu.sg/czw/ce_blast/.",

The design of the CE-BLAST model encompasses three steps: (1) deriving a group of fingerprints for each conformational epitope, (2) aligning the conformational epitopes according to their fingerprints, and (3) scoring the similarity according to the epitope alignment. In the first step, the epitope fingerprints are composed of individual fingerprints of each epitope residue, which are described by the residual layout and the physicochemical properties of the residual microenvironment via spin-image and shell-structure models. In the second step, a \"seed-grow\" strategy is subsequently adopted to identify the best local alignment, according to the fingerprint comparison between conformational epitopes. In the third step, the similarity score considers not only the number of matched residues, but also the evolutional distance between matched positions, as well as the similarity of the corresponding microenvironments for each residue. CE-BLAST begins with conformational epitope structures and requires no experimental binding data. Such unsupervised performance ensures its adaptability for new antigens without prior assays. Additional details can be found in the Methods.",

Currently, CE-BLAST contains three built-in epitope databases including: (1) 559 known epitope structures derived from the immune complexes in the PDB database; (2) High and robust performance on HI data of influenza H3. To test whether CE-BLAST can predict the cross-reactivity of intrasubtypic pathogens, influenza H3 was initially selected owing to the massive accumulation of HI assay values and sequence data. In this study, a complete historical HI dataset was collected to validate CE-BLAST, as well as to test the performance of the available tools specific to influenza [15] [16] [17] 1968-1972 1968-1977 1968-1982 1968-1987 1968-1992 1968-1997 1968-2002 1968-2007 Predicting the protective spectrum for a new vaccine (Con H3) of the influenza A/H3N2 strain by CE-BLAST. a Antigenic clustering results between HA epitopes of 679 influenza strains.

As shown in Fig. 2 , the overall prediction abilities of the supervised models varied differently across different dates, with AUC value below 0.65 at the beginning of testing period in 1972. When the size of training data kept increasing, their performances become relatively stable with AUC value over 0.8 after 1992. In comparison, CE-BLAST gave high performance of AUC value of around 0.9 from the beginning of 1972, and maintained a consistently high and stable AUC value across the entire testing periods. As an unsupervised method, the prominent value of CE-BLAST appears to be able to process the fast antigenic matching of new antigens where no appropriate serology exists. Subsequently, we thus extended the prediction ability of our tool to new antigens from different pathogens.",

A new vaccine, named \"Con H3\", was artificially designed for influenza H3 without HI data through the consensus sequence of the reported A/H3N2 strains from the years ranging from 2006 to 2009, obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). After querying against the 679 HA epitopes described above, CE-BLAST gave a potential similarity profile, with the protection spectrum of Con H3 shown in pink in Fig. 3a . Then, seven strains (Supplementary Table 1 ) including three inside and four outside of the predicted protection spectrum were randomly selected for experimental validation. Sequence comparison between \"Con H3\" and the seven selected strains can be found in Supplementary Fig. 2 . Notably, all the Con H3immunized mice ( Table 2 ). To further corroborate the above neutralization data, we generated monoclonal neutralizing antibodies from Con H3vaccinated mice. A cross-reactive neutralizing antibody designated as 6A7 was identified from among 2400 fusion-cell clones between H3-immunized mice splenocytes and mice myeloma cells, with neutralization activities tested subsequently. The experimental results, shown in Fig. 3b , agree well with the CE-BLAST predictions (Supplementary Table 3 ). In addition, the prediction accuracy of the three chosen peer algorithms was also tested on the new vaccine of \"Con H3\" at different time points, the results from which demonstrated that CE-BLAST outperformed the three peers, in terms of both accuracy and reliability ( Supplementary Tables 4-6 ).",

The titer value of DENV1-V1937 vs. DENV1-T16007 is the highest among all pairs between DENV1-V1937 and the 47 tested strains, followed by DENV1-M61117 with the second highest titer values, indicating the close antigenicity between DENV1-V1937 and DENV1-T16007 (Supplementary Data 1).

Additional results can be found in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 . Although the in silico cross-reactivity frequency could vary among different subtypes of DENV, strongly consistent CRPs in domain II and additionally weak CRPs in domain I could be detected across DENV subtypes (Fig. 5c ).

The same crossreactive epitope (CRE) residue may be contained by different artificial patches, and particular artificial patches covering sufficient CRE residues are more likely to constitute the CRPs. Thus, the overlapping of such CRPs likely indicates the location of true epitopes. Subsequently, individual residues in each in silico CRP of a given subtype are first mapped onto the 3D surface of the E antigen. The concentrated areas above the average are shown in turquoise in Fig. 5d -g, hinting at the potential CRE between ZIKV and DENV subtypes, respectively. Subsequent overlapping of subtypic CREs suggested the turquoise region in Fig. 5h as the potential CRE of ZIKA virus across DENV subtypes A similar strategy was applied to E protein dimer structures. The computed CRE across DENV subtypes was strongly hinted in domain II, albeit only slightly in domains I and III from the opposite chain in the dimer structure ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). The entire CRE predicted for the E dimer involves 14 surface residues, as labeled in Fig. 5i . Notably, the computed CRE is highly overlapping with results from the crystallization work of immune-complexes by Barba-Spaeth et al. 21 . In particular, 71% of our computed CRA residues are located in the binding interface derived from the structure complex between the antibody and the E protein dimer (Fig. 5j) , with 45% of the important residues suggested by Barba-Spaeth et al. included in our prediction (Fig. 5k) .",

            "text": "Predicting the cross reactivity for new pathogens is highly challenging, particularly when the experimental data is still insufficient. In this study, we designed a unique model to achieve such prediction by comparing the conformational epitopes of different antigens. Comprehensive validations confirmed the high and stable performance of CE-BLAST. The explanation for the success of CE-BLAST in sensitively detecting the antigenic change lies in the design of the algorithm. Firstly, the 3D residual layout difference in the whole antigen structure caused by mutations can be recorded by different rotating planes of spin-images of each epitope residue. Similarly, the physicochemical change of the microenvironment caused by the mutation in whole antigen can also be described through shell models of each epitope residue. Thus, for a pair of antigen structures with only one residual difference in the surface epitope, the coordinate displacement derived from classical structure alignment might mainly focus on the local mutated site, and therefore is usually minor. Conversely, in the CE-BLAST model, the fingerprints of all the non-mutated epitope residues will also change accordingly. Coupled with the substantial penalty from the BLOSUM matrix, the sensitivity to measure the overall difference is thereby largely increased in CE-BLAST. Furthermore, our model enables local search of the most similar subareas between epitopes. As our similarity score is normalized by self-size, the score of epitope A querying against B may be different from that of B against A, if they have different sizes. Therefore, we tested reciprocally in the case of ZIKV and DENV. A general workflow was also proposed for cross virus reactivation by modeling the representative antigen structures. Surface patches are artificially rendered as circles for simple calculation when the shape of the real epitope is totally unknown. Highly cross-reactive patches often suggest the inclusion of more cross-reactive epitope residues. After overlapping the individual residues from cross-reactive patches, the subtype-specific and subtype-common CREs can be suggested.",

As CE-BLAST calculates the similarity based on antigen structures, incomplete structures will reduce its performance. In addition, heavy post-translational modified structures may also influence the accuracy, such as in the case of the gp120 antigen of HIV. To summarize, we designed a new algorithm for the possible inference of antigenicity similarity, particularly for newly emerged pathogens. CE-BLAST may potentially be useful for the following applications: (1) inferring the relative antigenic distance between the mutated antigens, (2) predicting serological classification for pathogen subtypes, and (3) suggesting the potential cross-reactivity across viruses. Subsequent improvements will be further elaborated on post-translational modification (PTM) antigens, parallel computing, and refined models that are tailormade for specific proteins.",
