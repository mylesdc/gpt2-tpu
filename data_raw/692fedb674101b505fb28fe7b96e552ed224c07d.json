            "text": "Sequencing whole genomes of potentially heterogeneous or divergent viruses can be challenging from a small or complex sample with low viral concentrations. Deep sequencing to detect rare viral variants or metagenomic sequencing to genotype viruses from a complex background requires targeted viral amplification. Techniques such as consensus PCR, Ion Ampliseq (Life Technologies) [1] , TruSeq Amplicon (Illumina), and Haloplex (Agilent) [2] apply highly multiplexed PCR for target enrichment. Targeted enrichment should preferentially amplify the target virus over host or environmental DNA/RNA, in contrast to random amplification commonly used prior to whole genome sequencing. Primers designed to tile amplicons across a set of related viral genomes prior to sequencing can enrich whole viral genomes or large regions. However, high levels of intraspecific sequence variation combined with low virus concentrations mean that standard PCR primer design from a reference may fail due to mutations in the sample virus that prevent primer binding. To address this problem, we added a capability to the PriMux software distribution (http://sourceforge.net/projects/primux/) called run tiled primers that applies the PriMux software [3] to automate PCR primer design to achieve a near-minimal set of conserved, degenerate, multiplex-compatible primers designed to tile overlapping regions across multiple related whole genomes or regions.",

            "text": "JCVI has an automated degenerate PCR primer design system called JCVI Primer Designer, which is similar to run tiled primers in that it designs degenerate primers to tile across viral genomes [4] . The major difference is that it begins with a consensus sequence containing degenerate bases and selects primers with fewer than 3 or 4 degenerate bases, so that in the end a majority of strains are amplified, 2 Advances in Bioinformatics Table 1 : Summary of average lengths, number of sequences, and percentage of conserved bases in a multiple sequence alignment (with MUSCLE [5] ), and number of tiled primers required for the short and long amplicon settings. but it does not require primers to amplify all strains. In their examples, most of the primer pairs could amplify >75% of isolates. Each primer pair for a given region is intended to be run as a specific pair, not as a multiplex with multiple pairs. Consensus sequences with too little conservation, that is, <90% consensus, are divided manually in a preprocessing step into subgroups which can be run separately through the pipeline. The method here differs in that it takes the full multiple sequence alignment as input rather than a consensus, and it seeks to automatically design a minimal, degenerate set of multiplex compatible primers to amplify all the strains for a given region in a single reaction. The major operational difference of run tiled primers compared to the JCVI pipeline is that run tiled primers does not require manual subdivision of the target sequences into high consensus groups to be run separately by the user, and run tiled primers attempts to cover 100% of the target sequences in a single pass using a greedy minimal set algorithm. Some regions of high conservation may have only one primer pair predicted to amplify all strain variants, while other regions may require many primers to cover all known variants. If multiple strains are present at once or if multiple forward and/or reverse primers in the multiplex amplify the strain present, the reaction will generate multiple overlapping amplicons spanning the same region, which could be problematic if exactly one amplicon sequence is needed, for example, for Sanger sequencing. In this case, the JCVI Primer Designer would be preferable since it designs primer pairs each to be run in singleplex reactions rather than as a multiplex, with the risk that outlier strains may not be amplified. However, when multiple overlapping reads with different endpoints or from different strains are acceptable, as in high throughput sequencing, run tiled primers should be suitable and could serve as a good alternative to random amplification when more specific enrichment is needed, and amplification of outliers is desired.",

            "text": "The run tiled primers process can be summarized as follows: split a multiple sequence alignment into overlapping regions, and for each region design a degenerate multiplex set of primers that in combination amplify that region in all strains with as few primers as possible. Run tiled primers takes as input a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Run tiled primers splits the alignment into regions of size \" \" bases that overlap by \" \" bases ( Figure 1 ). When splitting the alignment into regions of size , if the last \"remainder\" piece of an alignment is less than half of , then is increased by the amount that evenly divides the alignment without any remainder to , and the split regions are recalculated with . If a user desires to tile across only selected regions instead of tiling across the entire sequence, then an optional regions file may be specified which contains the regions (e.g., genes) and their start and end positions in the alignment. For each region, the PriMux software [3] is used to search for conserved, degenerate, and multiplex compatible primer sets to amplify that region in all target sequences with as few primers as possible. The PriMux \"max\" algorithm is used. Primers should be multiplex compatible since the primers for a given region are predicted not to form primer dimers and all to have 's in a range specified by the user. As run tiled primers is a wrapper script around the PriMux workhorse, all the primer design characteristics are specified in a PriMux options file. The minimum and maximum amplicon lengths are determined by the ( , ) parameters to run tiled primers (Table 2) , so these parameters may be omitted in the input options file or if they are present, their values will be replaced with values appropriate for the specified values of ( , ). Run tiled primers requires that primers must anneal within 0.5 of either end of the region. If the value of is 36 bp or less, it is too short for two nonoverlapping primers, typically at least 18 bp long. In this case, the code does not require that adjacent regions overlap and amplicons are allowed from anywhere in each region. Small overlaps (e.g., 40-80) do not leave much room to find good priming regions that pass the filters on , entropy, free energy, and homopolymers as specified in the options file, and consequently it may not be possible to find primers for all targets. When this happens, increasing the overlap and relaxing the primer specifications may be necessary.",

Bath from the OW Arena S segment 3 kb multiplex and a single amplicon of 851 bp from a human BAC from a library at CalTech. All three of these predicted nontarget amplicons result from a single primer in each of those reactions performing as both forward primer (FP) and reverse primer (RP). Nonetheless, the primer multiplexes described here should strongly favor the preferential enrichment of desired targets. Deriving each primer set required multiple sequence alignment and a call to run tile primers in the current PriMux software distribution (http://sourceforge.net/projects/primux/). In comparison, primer design with the JCVI pipeline for any of these target sets would require the following steps: (1) inspection of a phylogeny for the full target set to build multiple smaller clade-level sets with no more than 10% sequence variation, (2) realignment of the clade-level sets, (3) running of the JCVI pipeline on each clade set, (4) assessing which target sequences are not amplified after one design round and rerun the pipeline on those sequences for each clade, (5) and repeating step 4 until all target sequences are predicted to be amplified.",
