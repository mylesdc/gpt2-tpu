In the developed world, some pandemic preparedness plans have already been examined from an ethical viewpoint. This paper assesses the attention given to ethics issues by the Ghana National Integrated Strategic Plan for Pandemic Influenza (NISPPI). Methods: We critically analyzed the Ghana NISPPI's sensitivity to ethics issues to determine how well it reflects ethical commitments and principles identified in our review of global pandemic preparedness literature, existing pandemic plans, and relevant ethics frameworks.",

            "text": "Results: This paper reveals that important ethical issues have not been addressed in the Ghana NISPPI. Several important ethical issues are unanticipated, unacknowledged, and unplanned for. These include guidelines on allocation of scarce resources, the duties of healthcare workers, ethics-sensitive operational guidelines/protocols, and compensation programs. The NISPPI also pays scant attention to use of vaccines and antivirals, border issues and cooperation with neighboring countries, justification for delineated actions, and outbreak simulations. Feedback and communication plans are nebulous, while leadership, coordination, and budgeting are quite detailed. With respect to presentation, the NISPPI's text is organized around five thematic areas. While each area implicates ethical issues, NISPPI treatment of these areas consistently fails to address them. Conclusions: Our analysis reveals a lack of consideration of ethics by the NISPPI. We contend that, while the plan's content and fundamental assumptions provide support for implementation of the delineated public health actions, its consideration of ethical issues is poor. Deficiencies include a failure to incorporate guidelines that ensure fair distribution of scarce resources and a lack of justification for delineated procedures. Until these deficiencies are recognized and addressed, Ghana runs the risk of rolling out unjust and ethically indefensible actions with real negative effects in the event of a pandemic. Soliciting inputs from the public and consultation with ethicists during the next revision of the NISPPI will be useful in addressing these issues.",

We use the Republic of Ghana's pandemic preparedness plan as an illustrative example. The Ghana National Integrated Strategic Plan for Pandemic Influenza for 2009 -2013 (NISPPI) is the government's paper outlining its preparedness strategies [12] . The NISPPI addresses five main themes -planning and coordination; surveillance and situation monitoring; prevention, containment and management; communication; and social mitigation. In the recent past, the plan has been critiqued for deficiencies in epidemiological content and other concerns [13, 14] . Sambala criticizes the vaccine/antiviral strategies of Ghana, Malawi, and Tanzania pandemic plans as unclear and inadequatelacking an epidemiological explanation as to why certain groups are at high risk. Norman et al. do not consider the level of risk used in estimating direct health threat in the event of an outbreak acceptable risk. They do not offer what level of risk is acceptable. Both the 2006 influenza preparedness and response plan [15] and the current NISPPI [12] contain assumptions about the direct health threat in the event of an outbreak. Both project the number of clinical cases and deaths in Ghana in the event of a Phase 5 pandemic a using gross attack rates of between 15% and 40%, and case fatality rates (CFR) between 0.6% and 1.5%. Based on Ghana's present population of approximately 25 million, even these conservative assumptions show a real potential for significant mortality (22,500 deaths) in an influenza pandemic. Clinical cases will far exceed what the country's health infrastructure and sophistication can handle.",

Thus in planning, provisions need to be made for input from various groups such as ordinary community members, healthcare workers, bioethicists, and public policy advisors, among others [27, 29] . A careful reading of the NISPPI reveals that its development did not employ deliberative procedures of community engagement. All the contributors to the plan were technical personnel from various ministries, departments and agencies. These Pandemic preparedness plans should incorporate feedback into the development process.

Civic engagement and fair processes are requirements in every phase of pandemic preparedness planning. Lessons from existing guidelines and frameworks [19, 20] show that effective communication among health care professionals and the public could be achieved by integrating communication aspects into all planning, preparedness and response activities. For instance, key institutions or spokespersons for disseminating information to the public need to be identified prior to the pandemic and they need to give clear, consistent and balanced messages.

Questions surrounding isolation, quarantine, and application of police power are relevant in this context. Even though the NISSPI mentions that quarantine and other standstill measures will be invoked immediately when the Minister declares an outbreak, the plan does not address the ethical questions associated with such interventions. Available records from Colonial Ghana amplify the need for such ethical questions to be addressed. The records indicate that social distancing methods including segregation were attempted; not only did officials close schools and ban public meetings, they also restricted the police and clerical workers from doing their duties [35] . The towns of Larwa, Tumu, and Wa in the Upper West Region of current Ghana clearly abused patients by removing them from their homes and isolating them to inhabitable huts on the fringes of the infected villages, and the larger towns and villages were completely sectioned off [36] . Food, water, and necessary supplies could only be placed outside the camps and only the attendants could come out to collect these items for the patients inside. In the northern territories and Ashanti, the Colonial administration constructed fences around infected towns, placed markets outside their borders, and directed traffic to alternative trade routes [36] . Some commentators on the subject have argued that if individuals are required to forgo certain liberties, fairness should be a prime consideration [34] . Nowhere in the NISPPI is this issue addressed.",

Stockpiling of antiviral agents is a key part of national influenza pandemic preparedness in many industrialized countries [26] ; it is also a dream for pandemic plans in resource-constrained settings. The current NISSPI has cost estimates on procuring pharmaceuticals and other supplies. This is estimated to be $709,750. It is reasonable to expect that a justification for this expenditure be provided when a significant proportion of the country's population is in serious need for basic medical supplies such as antimalarial and antiretroviral drugs.",

Should this happen in Ghana, the already inadequate human and material resources of the Ghana health services will be further and rapidly overstretched. Based on experiences elsewhere, many of the sick will recover with minimal assistance, but others will be seriously ill and require prolonged hospitalization, diagnostic facilities, multiple drugs, and aid from health personnel if they are to have a chance to survive [17] .

Every pandemic plan should address the question of whether practitioners are obligated to treat patients with a highly contagious disease, thus putting themselves and their families, acquaintances, or anyone else they contact at risk. For example, research publications have mentioned the high transmissibility to nurses and frontline physicians in Southeast Asia during the SARS outbreak [37, 38] . Wenzel et al. report that about 50% of those who died from SARS were healthcare workers who had come in contact with infected patients in hospitals [38] . Chua et al. recorded that fear and anxiety-induced psychiatric morbidity was a major problem among healthcare workers involved in SARS treatment [39] . Drawing from these experiences, others have warned that an influenza pandemic will impose similar foreseeable risks to physicians and other healthcare workers [40] . This raises an ethical dilemma about the extent of the professional duty of caregivers during a pandemic versus the limits to health risk to themselves and to their families that healthcare workers need accept [41] . It may be argued that if provided with the appropriate equipment or supplies necessary to treat, practitioners should be obligated to treat someone with any illness. The NISPPI mentions procuring and distributing protective clothing, masks, aprons, and gloves. This is laudable; however, being prepared requires not only that health workers are aware that they have masks that they can use during a pandemic but also that they have the requisite training on how to use personal protective equipment safely and effectively. Indeed, it is required of planners to acknowledge limitations of various proposed actions or interventions (both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical) [42] . The NISPPI does not address these issues.",

The second limitation relates to the fact that the quality of ethical argumentation in preparedness plans and actual amount of attention ethics will receive in an influenza pandemic are distinct.
