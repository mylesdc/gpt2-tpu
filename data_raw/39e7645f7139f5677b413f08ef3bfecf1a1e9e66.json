The child had entered the pigsty but had not been in direct contact with pigs. Despite early prescription of antibiotics by the general practitioner the child's clinical situation rapidly deteriorated. Within three days after onset of disease the child was transferred to a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for non-invasive ventilation support and intensive monitoring. Despite these efforts, the patient deteriorated further and was intubated in order to start mechanical ventilation. Bronchoscopy following intubation revealed large amounts of highly viscous mucus in the airways. Efforts to remove this mucus failed to improve ventilation. Mechanical ventilation became increasingly complex and it was decided to initiate veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and to transfer to a quaternary PICU. Due to ECMO, blood oxygenation was secured and extensive bronchoscopy could be performed, during which topical DNAse (Dornase alpha, Pulmozyme, Roche) was instilled to decrease viscosity and facilitate removal of obstructing mucus plugs. On the following day, bronchoscopy was repeated and additional mucus was removed.",

Oseltamivir treatment (60 mg twice daily) was started hours after initiation of ECMO and transport. It was continued for a total of 7 days when a nasal swab tested negative for influenza virus.

The gene segments were all of the Eurasian avian A(H1N1) SIV lineage that has been circulating in pigs since 1979 [1] . Pigs at the farm visited by the patient tested positive for the same SIV (curation of full genome sequence data is in progress). The virus isolate from the patient, A/Netherlands/3315/2016, was sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir by NA-star neuraminidase inhibitor resistance detection assay (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel, The Netherlands).",

In total, more than 80 contacts were monitored. These included the patient's family members living in the same household, persons living and working on the pig farm, and healthcare workers who cared for the patient without wearing personal protective equipment (i.e. before the influenza diagnosis).

Apart from one isolated incident in military barracks in the United States (US), sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission had not been documented before 2009, when an influenza virus of swine origin triggered the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. Indeed it is speculated that pigs may serve as a mixing vessel for the development of a pandemic influenza strain [2] [3] [4] [5] . In addition, SIV infections account for roughly one third of all laboratory-confirmed zoonotic influenza events reported in the scientific literature [3] . This may be a gross underestimation of the actual number as there are no typical signs and symptoms that distinguish SIV infections in humans from those caused by seasonal influenza viruses [4] . Indeed several sero-epidemiological studies suggest that SIV infection in people with occupational swine exposure is common [6] [7] [8] . In the US, there is a routine surveillance for swine influenza in pigs, and 400 patients with a swine influenza infection have been reported through this system since 2005 [9] . Our case shows that careful assessment of airway disease in individuals exposed to pigs continues to be important, especially considering the importance of starting of antiviral treatment early.",
