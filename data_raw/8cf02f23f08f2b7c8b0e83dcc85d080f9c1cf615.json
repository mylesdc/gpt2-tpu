            "text": "Background: An oil refinery in Oakville, Canada, closed over 2004Canada, closed over -2005 an opportunity for a natural experiment to examine the effects on oil refinery-related air pollution and residents' health. Methods: Environmental and health data were collected for the 16 years around the refinery closure. Toronto (2.5 million persons) and the Greater Toronto Area (GTA, 6.3 million persons) were used as control and reference populations, respectively, for Oakville (160,000 persons). We compared sulfur dioxide and age-and season-standardized hospitalizations, considering potential factors such as changes in demographics, socio-economics, drug prescriptions, and environmental variables. Results: The closure of the refinery eliminated 6000 tons/year of SO 2 emissions, with an observed reduction of 20% in wind direction-adjusted ambient concentrations in Oakville. After accounting for trends, a decrease in cold-season peak-centered respiratory hospitalizations was observed for Oakville (reduction of 2.2 cases/1000 persons per year, p = 0.0006) but not in Toronto (p = 0.856) and the GTA (p = 0.334). The reduction of respiratory hospitalizations in Oakville post closure appeared to have no observed link to known confounders or effect modifiers. Conclusion: The refinery closure allowed an assessment of the change in community health. This natural experiment provides evidence that a reduction in emissions was associated with improvements in population health. This study design addresses the impact of a removed source of air pollution.",

Improvements in both air quality and health effects have been documented following a number of large-scale changes in local air pollution emissions, including copper smelters in the Southwestern United States [1] , bitumous coal burning in Dublin, Ireland [2] , lowered sulfur content for fuel oil and gasoline in Hong Kong [3] , closure of pollution-emitting industries in East Germany [4] , reduction of traffic during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta [5] , and reduction of traffic during the Summer Asian Games in Busan, South Korea [6] . Studies have also been done following the closure of the Utah Valley Steel Mill [7, 8] and on the impact of the air pollution-lowering steps adopted prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics [9, 10] . In many of these studies the intervention led to significant reductions in negative health effect metrics for the affected populations.",

Considering the relatively small population size of Oakville, we examined respiratory-related morbidity, as there were more hospital admissions than deaths, providing more statistical power. Thus, in this study we focused on the changes in ambient air pollution in relation to those in morbidity records to measure the impact of the refinery closure on public health.",

These 15 weeks of age-standardized rates can then be aggregated and scaled to cases per thousand persons per year. We explore this in the following.",

This model allows for a long-term trend to be fit to the data while simultaneously modeling any step-function behaviour as delineated by the intervention variable (I t ). This is a particularly simple implementation of interrupted time-series modeling. Table 2 lists the reported total yearly emissions (in metric tons) for the Petro-Canada Refinery Table 2 indicates emissions below the required reporting thresholds. In addition to the reported reduction in annual emissions, we observed ambient SO 2 concentrations as decreasing across the refinery closure period. The SO 2 fuel regulations initiated in 2003 can be observed in the reduction in annual average hourly ambient SO 2 for Oakville of 39% (from 4.30 ppb to 2.62 ppb between 2001-2002 and 2003-2004) before the refinery closed. In an attempt at identifying any further reduction that might plausibly be related to the refinery closure in 2004, we compared two time periods, 2003-2004 versus 2005-2007 , restricting attention to wind direction from the south-west to allow for winds to carry refinery emissions to station 61603. For this data, the wind direction-restricted average hourly ambient SO 2 fell further by 20% after the refinery closure (from 4.92 ppb to 3.94 ppb). Against this, the ambient, unrestricted ambient concentration dropped 0.4 ppb, from 2.62 ppb to 2.26 ppb. This larger reduction for the sub-case of wind from the south-west (10% of observed hourly samples) may reflect the impact of the refinery closure. In addition, it appears that the variability of the exposure in both stations decreased, indicating that extreme events were less likely to occur post-closure. Table 3 gives means (\u00b5) and standard deviations (s) for N available hourly observations of both all cases and wind-direction-restricted data (winds originating from the southwest) for the two periods.

However, the unstandardized hospital admissions in Table 4 do not reflect demographic (e.g., changes in age distribution and population) or environmental changes (e.g., seasonal variations). Accordingly, we age-standardized the seasonal counts for Oakville against the GTA as a 6.3-million-person demographic reference population, from the national census in 2006 (see Online Supplement, Table S1 for details on the GTA records). As the population of Oakville increased from 132,234 to 190,902 (44%) [22] during the study period, to account for shifting demographics over time we employed age-standardized SHRs to detect any changes in the number of hospitalizations after the refinery closure.

We thus considered a dynamic approach of taking 15-week blocks centered on the peak week of respiratory hospitalizations for a given cold season (October-March) and city. Eliminating 2003 as a clear outlier (attributed to the SARS epidemic) and excluding 2005 as the pivot year for refinery closure, we found a significant (p = 0.0006) mean difference between the period before the closure (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) and afterwards (2006-2012) using a simple segmented linear regression model, as detailed in Equation ( 2) (details in Table 5 and Figure 3 ). We found no significant differences in all-cause (non-accidental), circulatory and non-cardiorespiratory related hospitalizations before and after the refinery closure (not shown here). Note that when data from 2003 and 2005 were included in the analysis, although the exact values changed, the conclusions did not; similarly, allowing 2005 to be considered as \"after\" closure did not change the conclusions. This result indicates that our finding on the Oakville respiratory hospitalizations is insensitive to the inclusion of the two specific years in question. In summary, cold-season peak-centered respiratory hospitalizations in Oakville fell by 2.2 cases per thousand persons per year (approximately 180 total hospitalizations for the year) from before the refinery closure to after, excluding the two outlier years. Across the same period, no immediate decrease (after accounting for trend) was found in Toronto.",

While associations between SO 2 and morbidity are positive and significant, they are small in magnitude, so any association between refinery closure and health outcomes cannot be necessarily directly attributed to this pollutant, however use of SO 2 as a representative proxy of the whole seems reasonable.

This is another strength of the study, as with the local nature of SO 2 ambient concentration we would not expect to see step-function reductions of SO 2 concentration outside of the immediate region surrounding the refinery.",

            "text": "The closure of the refinery came soon after the introduction of a stringent sulfur content regulation for gasoline in Ontario: as of 1 January 2005, all gasoline sold in Ontario was limited to an annual average sulfur level of 30 ppm (30,000 ppb) or 30 milligrams per-kilogram (mg/kg), with a never-to-be-exceeded limit of 80 ppm (Government of Canada, 1999) . From July 2002 to 2005, there was an interim annual average sulfur content of 150 ppm. The ambient concentration reduction happened quite sharply in 2002-2003, despite the regulation rolling out in phases, as most fuel manufacturers moved their facilities to the new standard in time for the initiation of the regulation. Similar regulatory changes were implemented in June 2006 for diesel fuel, with a reduction from 500 to 15 ppm [35] . These changes, together with more restrictions on power plants and industry, led to a decrease in the Ontario average annual ambient concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) from approximately 6 ppb to 2.2 ppb across the 2000-2013 period [36, 37] . The step-wise decrease in ambient SO 2 levels observed in Oakville appears to be in addition to the background decrease in SO 2 levels associated with the reduction in allowable sulfur content in gasoline, as seen in ambient concentrations of nearby municipalities.",

The area directly co-located with the refinery saw very little population growth (0-3%) during this time. In addition, the age distribution skewed toward retirees through this period, with the demographic profile aging over the decade; much of this aging should have been compensated for by the standardization of hospitalization records. Any residual effect not compensated for by this modeling (due to population demographics being temporally coarse owing to census patterns) should have been in the direction of an aging population, which should result in increased levels of hospitalizations rather than the opposite.",
