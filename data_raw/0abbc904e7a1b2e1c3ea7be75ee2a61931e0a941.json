User-friendly software and custom-written scripts helped the end user in the steep learning curve. A significant component of this platform was the use of the SOLO single-channel robotic workstation and the Bravo Liquid Handling Platform, both of which allowed miniaturisation of the assay from the 300 \u03bcL-96-well to the 30 \u00b5L-384-well format.

The cells were allowed to grow for 72 hours post-seeding, and cell viability was evaluated by adding the ATPlite reagent and reading the luminescence signal. A cell density of 5000 RD cells/well was chosen for the assay because this density gave a consistent and strong luminescence signal, with a good signal-to-background ratio (S/B) ratio and low variability (Fig. 2) . Optimal densities for Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells and HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma) cells were determined in a similar manner and using the same optimal seeding density. optimisation of virus titre. Virus stocks were titrated to determine the dilution that gave optimal sensitivity in the assay. For each virus, the titre was determined by the endpoint dilution method using half-log dilutions in 96-well microplates. A panel of enterovirus and parechovirus strains was established with cell selection and incubation times based on previous experiments 18 . Twelve-point, half-log 10 serial dilutions of each virus (Fig. 3 ) were made to determine the starting dilution for use in the automated 384-well assay and to ensure a full dynamic range of the CPE. The starting virus dilutions were selected based on the initial linear portion of the curve for each virus. To induce CPE in at least 80% of the cells, a viral dilution of 100 CCID 50 was used.",

Pleconaril displayed antiviral activity at 0.36 \u00b5M, whereas rupintrivir exhibited low, nanomolar antiviral activity of 0.003 \u00b5M. This may be due to the targeting of different viral proteins. We tested pleconaril and rupintrivir against four EV-A71 strains.

The introduction of CPE-based assays using an ATP/luminescence readout of antiviral activity has been recently reported for influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, yellow fever virus, and coxsackievirus [20] [21] [22] [23] . This approach measures ATP levels in live cells protected from virus-induced CPE by the presence of antiviral compounds using an ATP-specific luminescent reagent. The advantages of assays with an ATP/luminescence readout are their high-throughput and homogenous (mix and measure) assay format. Homogeneous assays also have the advantage that non-adherent cell lines can be used if desired, and they are amenable to high-density plate formats that can be easily automated. In initial work with RD cells, we observed that these cells did not adhere well to plastic 96-well plates and were easily washed off by our automated system (data not shown). This excluded the use of RD cells in CPE assays requiring adherence of cells prior to staining, which was a distinct disadvantage because RD cells are the optimal cell line for many EVs. In addition, Vero cells do not wash off the plastic cleanly, so reagents like crystal violet stain cell debris that remains adherent, making it difficult to differentiate dead cells from live ones. luminescence of ATPlight www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Our CPE-based enterovirus antiviral assay used the ATPlite reagent, as the ATP/luminescence readout was easily adapted for use with automation platforms.

            "text": "Here, an automated, high-throughput, cell-based assay was developed, validated and implemented to profile the efficacy of antiviral compounds against EVs in cell culture. Cell viability measured by ATP detection with a luminescent readout was used as the endpoint. The antiviral compounds pleconaril, a capsid inhibitor, and rupintrivir, a 3C protease inhibitor, were evaluated as model drugs for the inhibition of representative EVs and human parechoviruses. This HTS-suitable assay performed consistently and accurately in an automation-friendly format. This assay is suitable for use to profile other picornavirus inhibitors. Automated luminescent antiviral assay. A multichannel pipette was used to transfer 5 \u00b5L of 2 mM stock compounds from the stock compound plate (Fig. 1) to rows A and B of a 96-well flat-bottom polystyrene plate (Corning, Corning, NY) containing 245 \u00b5L MEM containing 2% FBS (dilution plate). The MicroFlo Select dispenser (BioTek, Winooski, VT), equipped with a rotational wrist and 30-plate stackers, was used to add 60 \u00b5L MEM with 2% FBS medium to all wells of a 384-well white flat-bottom plate (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA). The SOLO single-channel robotic workstation (Hudson Robotics Inc., Springfield, NJ) was used to transfer 30 \u00b5L of the compound dilutions in quadruplicate into the 384-well serial dilution plates (Fig. 1) . The Bravo Liquid Handling Platform (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) executed 30 \u00b5L half-log 10 serial dilutions in the serial dilution plate and then transferred 5 \u00b5L of the diluted compounds into multiple assay plates (Fig. 1) . Cells were diluted to 2.5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/mL in MEM with 2% FBS, and 20 \u00b5L were added to each well of the assay plates using the MicroFlo Select reagent dispenser. The assay plates containing compound dilutions and cells were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature prior to adding 100 CCID 50 dilutions of viruses. The MicroFlo Select reagent dispenser was used to dispense 5 \u00b5L of virus in MEM (Gibco) with 2% FBS (HyClone, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) to 384-well assay plates. Viruses were added to the entire plate, including virus control wells that did not contain test compound. The assay plates were covered with a plate lid, wrapped in plastic wrap www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ with a wet paper towel placed at the bottom of the stack and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere for 3-7 days, depending on the virus and cell line 18, 24 . The final assay volume was 30 \u00b5L.",
