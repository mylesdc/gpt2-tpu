The organism's genetic makeup might play a part in the activity of any of these processes and might underlie chemical toxicity and adverse drug reactions (Meyer, 2000) . To address this problem, a key goal of predictive medicine is to identify the DNA loci, termed quantitative trait loci (QTLs), which can be used to predict the response to a given medication and its toxicity in a particular patient (e.g., Rost et al., 2004; Harrill and Rusyn, 2008) . This challenge can be easily and systematically addressed by utilizing specific mouse models in preclinical pharmacogenetics research.",

            "text": "Mouse pharmacogenetic studies have typically been applied across F2 progeny and backcross populations (Rusyn et al., 2010; Frick et al., 2013) ; across recombinant inbred (RI) lines derived by crossing two founder strains and inbreeding during many generations (Cook et al., 2004; Hitzemann et al., 2004) ; and across a predefined collection of classical inbred lines (Montgomery et al., 2013; Yoo et al., 2015) . Although these approaches have proved useful in many studies, they are derived mainly from Mus musculus domesticus and thus reflect only a partial repertoire of adverse effects, limiting pharmacogenetic investigation. A promising new model organism has been provided by the recently developed Collaborative Cross (CC) strains, a large, genetically diverse mouse reference population. The CC panel is a collection of RI mouse lines that combine the genomes of eight genetically and phenotypically diverse founder strains-A/J, C57BL/6J [B6], 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ (Aylor et al., 2011; Consortium, 2012) . Whereas the first five founders are classical Mus musculus domesticus subspecies, the last three are wild-derived strains representing the three Mus musculus subspecies, namely M. m. musculus, M. m. domesticus, and Mus m. castaneus. Thus, like classical RI strains, CC mice are genetically reproducible with balanced allele frequencies, but in addition they incorporate a large amount of genetic variation and dense recombination sites (Valdar et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2011; Chesler, 2014) . The availability of genotyping data across all CC lines opened the way to analyses of QTLs in a variety of traits, including behavioral and morphological phenotypes (Aylor et al., 2011; Chesler, 2014; Mao et al., 2015; Percival et al., 2016) , homeostatic immune processes (Kelada et al., 2012; Phillippi et al., 2014) , susceptibility to infectious diseases (Durrant et al., 2011; Ferris et al., 2013; Vered et al., 2014; Graham et al., 2015; Gralinski et al., 2015; Lor\u00e8 et al., 2015) , and liver-related functionalities (Kelada et al., 2012; Svenson et al., 2012; Thaisz et al., 2012) .",

One of the many mechanisms through which variation in drug disposition can arise is the biotransformation of drugs in the liver. In such biotransformation, drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) and drug transport proteins (DTPs) catalyze the biochemical modification and transport of exogenous chemicals and other xenobiotics (Katz et al., 2008) . With regard to hepatic drug metabolism in the CC lines, two key questions arise: (i) Should a large diversity be expected in hepatic biotransformation of particular drugs? (ii) Can CC mice be used to evaluate the crosstalk between drug metabolism and other functionalities of the liver, especially those related to lipid and fatty acid metabolism?",

By applying eQTL analysis on these data we characterized the genetic control over expression of drug disposition enzymes-either control of the overall expression of genes or of the expression of particular transcript isoforms. Using these predictions we compiled a network of connectivity between genomic loci and the metabolism of specific drugs, highlighting potential joint genetic effects and drug-drug interactions. Further analysis of nuclear receptors participating in the regulation of cellular-biochemical pathways provided DNA variants that affect the crosstalk between lipid metabolism and drug metabolism. Thus, our study supports the premise that the CC population is a valuable model system for the investigation of genetic variation in response to a wide range of chemicals and drugs, and may further offer mechanisms by which DNA variation contributes to the relationship between lipid metabolism and adverse clinical effects. Moreover, our approach provides a general strategy for a system-level mapping of eQTL-drug connectivity across a genetically diverse population.",

This data is accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE77715. A detailed description of our data analysis appears below (see a summary of the computational pipeline in Table S2 ).",

This permissive genomic range was selected to account for the lack of precision in the associated genome intervals ( Figure S6 ). We used permutation to establish the null distribution of the association test statistics and then exploited the null distribution to calculate a permutation-based false discovery rate (\"permutation FDR\") score (see Materials and Methods).

We organized this information as a network, referred to as the \"eQTL-drug connectivity map\" (Figure 1A) . The map is composed of three types of nodes: drugs, eQTLs and enzymes. Each drug is connected to its metabolizing enzyme nodes and each enzyme is connected to its underlying eQTL nodes. Characterization of drugs in terms of their perturbing eQTLs provides potential joint effects that may underlie the response to Shown for each drug disposition reaction (column 1) are various enzyme classes (column 2), the identified eQTL-associated genes in each class (column 3), and the topranking proximal eQTL of each gene (genomic positions; column 4.

We found that the founder B6 and A/J strains differ substantially in their effects on at least one isoform of this gene (Figure 2A , bottom left). We therefore distinguish between CC lines that carry the B6 haplotype (IL-557, IL-1452, IL-2011, IL-2126, IL-4156 strains) and those carrying the A/J haplotype (IL-1141, IL-72, IL-611, IL-4032, IL-4052, IL-4457 strains) in the genomic region of Cyp3a25 (Figure 2A, left) . Specifically, we focus on two representative B6-carrying lines (IL-2011 and IL-2156) and two A/J-carrying lines (IL-72 and IL-611). Figure 2B displays the read coverage of the exons and the numbers of junction reads of the selected strains. We found multiple reads aligned to the junction-spanning exons 5 and 7 in B6-carrying strains (56 and 65 reads in lines IL-2011 and IL-2156, respectively). Notably, the numbers of these exon-skipping reads was substantially lower in the A/Jcarrying individuals (5 and 12 reads in lines IL-72 and IL-611, respectively). The widespread exon-skipping events observed in B6-carrying strains raise the possibility that these events reflect a higher level of expression in B6-carrying than in A/Jcarrying strains. However, we observed the opposite effect, with a higher coverage level and a higher number of nonskipping splicing reads in the A/J-carrying individuals. For instance, 729 and 963 junction reads between exons 6 and 7 were mapped in the two A/J-carrying strains compared to 198 and 235 junction reads in B6-carrying ones. This confirms that the larger numbers of exon 6-skipping events in B6-carrying strains are not merely a result of the overall level of expression. 2. Gsta2 is a conjugation enzyme that adds a reduced glutathione to hydrophobic electrophiles. Relying on the observation that the founder effect of the B6 line differs substantially from the PWK and CAST lines (Figure 2A , right), we focused on two B6-carrying CC lines (IL-611 and IL-3575), one CASTcarrying line (IL-1513) and one PWK-carrying line (IL-2680; Figure 2C ). We observed alternative 5 \u2032 start sites in which only the B6-carrying individuals have alternative upstream start sites. This could not be ascribed merely to the higher overall expression of Gsta2 in the B6-carrying individuals, since the coverage of reads (across all exons) is lower in B6-carrying than in CAST/PWK-carrying individuals. The difference between the haplotypes can be attributed to an alternative location of the 5 \u2032 start site, or alternatively, to a haplotype-specific 5 \u2032 -3 \u2032 RNA degradation. Previously annotated isoforms do not fully explain the observed reads in the PWK and CAST CC lines.",

NRs were selected not only because they play a major role in transcription regulation, but also since many DMEs and DTPs are induced by their own substrates through the activity of NRs. Chemical signals (ligands) of NRs consist of exogenous drugs and xenobiotics, as well as endogenous small molecules such as steroid hormones and cholesterol (e.g., Evans and Mangelsdorf, 2014) . Using the extensive mapping of regulatory programs within the curated IPA, we identified seven different NRs (or receptor complexes) whose targets are enriched among the 608 associated traits (Figure 3) . Specifically, we found enrichment of targets in xenobiotics-and drug-activated NRs, including the xenobiotics sensor PXR-with or without its heterodimerization partner RXR\u03b1 (P < 0.0024, 0.0158, respectively; hyper-geometric test)-and the xenobiotics sensor CAR as an heterodimer with RXR\u03b1 (P < 0.0165). We also found that the hepatic eQTL targets were enriched with known targets of ROR\u03b1, ROR\u03b3, and PPAR\u03b1, three NRs that are activated by cholesterol and fatty acid ligands (P < 0.0012, 0.0012, 0.0081, respectively). The map of NR-dependent eQTL targets shows a clear overlap between targets of xenobiotics-sensitive regulators and targets of lipid-sensitive regulators (Figure 3) . Specifically, six of 16 genes that are regulated by xenobiotics sensors (PXR and CAR) are also regulated by lipid sensors (ROR\u03b1, ROR\u03b3, and PPAR\u03b1). A close examination of the map showed that the overlap between lipid metabolism and drug metabolism is even more prominent: the known DME genes Sulf2, Cyp3a25, Cyp2c40, Gstz1, and Mgst3 are targeted by lipid-sensing nuclear receptors; similarly, two genes that are controlled by xenobiotics-activated receptor are wellestablished lipid metabolizing enzymes (Ugt1a6 and Cyp2c44).",

For example, Cyp3a16 has a role in degradation of steroids, in addition to its role in oxidation of a variety of drugs, including tamoxifen, paclitaxel, haloperidol and tretinoin; similarly, Ugt1a6b participates in hepatic degradation of C 18 -steroids and also in conjugation of levothyroxine, nicotine and irinotecan ( Figure 1A) . Furthermore, our analysis is consistent with previous reports, both in human and mouse, where disordered lipid metabolism has an effect on clinical drug disposition and the other way around. For example, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients exhibit altered metabolism of drugs (Buechler and Weiss, 2011) , and DTPs are down-regulated in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) subjects (Lake et al., 2011) . Furthermore, several genetic modifiers of NAFLD and NASH have a documented effect on the efficacy of drugs (reviewed in Naik et al., 2013) . Our results in the CC panel demonstrate the prevalence of genetic variation acting on the lipid-drug crosstalk. CC mice can therefore be used to investigate the relationships between these factors and their roles in the interaction between lipid metabolism and metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics.",

The panel of CC lines is a promising model for pharmacogenomic studies because of the large amount of genetic variation and the ability to investigate the molecular response to drugs within specialized internal tissues. However, the effect of genetic variation on drug disposition enzymes remain to be elucidated. Here we defined the diversity and complexity of genetic variation on the expression of drug disposition genes across the CC lines. Our results indicate a previously unknown overrepresentation of hepatic drug disposition genes that are affected by proximal regulatory variation (P < 0.03; Table 1 ). Further inspection showed the complexity of interrelationships between regulatory variants, highlighting various potential interactions between drugs due to shared eQTLs (Figures 1-3) . This analysis, therefore, provides an informative view to guide future pharmacogenetics and mechanistic studies across the CC strains. For example, we found a significant effect of lipid metabolism on pharmacokinetic parameters (Figure 3) . This suggests that the CC mice are a suitable model for studying the lipid-drug crosstalk in human metabolic disorders.",

Our analysis offers a potential strategy for selecting a subset of CC lines (designed for a specific drug) that can be used in pharmacogenomic studies. In particular, a given drug corresponds to a group of eQTL targets that play a role in deposition of the drug (e.g., six DMEs in the irinotecan pathway; Figure 1B ). The transcription profiles of CC lines across the genes in this group may point to a small subset of non-redundant CC lines (e.g., for the irinotecan pathway, a single CC line from each of the eight groups in Figure S7 ). In subsequent pharmacogenetic studies of this drug, only this subset of CC lines is analyzed. This strategy is in contrast to the standard approach of choosing the lines according to genotyping. The two selection methods complement each other, but the expressionbased approach may reveal, in addition, the functional effects of candidate genomic loci.",

(A) Haplotype probabilities of the eight founder lines (columns) in 29 CC lines (rows), calculated in the isoform-ratio eQTLs of two drug disposition genes, Cyp3a25 (left) and Gsta2 (right). The gray scale indicates haplotype probabilities, ranging between zero (white) and 1 (dark gray). The calculated effect of each founder is shown in white bars (bottom). Groups of CC lines with the largest (positive and negative) founder effect of their haplotype are marked in brown and green (B6-and A/J-carrying lines; Cyp3a25) or brown and blue (B6-and CAST/PWK-carrying lines; Gsta2). Double daggers indicate two representative CC lines in each of these groups, which were used for displaying the raw sequencing reads in plots (B,C). (B,C) Raw reads of selected strains for the genes Cyp3a25 and Gsta2. The read's coverage over exon is displayed as bar graph, and the number of reads across splice junctions (junction depth) are displayed by arcs. Arcs with junction depth < 5 were omitted. The known isoforms are indicated in black (bottom). (B) The Cyp3a25 locus, focusing on exons 5, 6, and 7 in CC individuals that carry the B6 haplotype (brown) and the A/J haplotype (green) in the associated eQTL. (C) Entire Gsta2 locus (excluding exon 1 of the longest isoform) in CC individuals that carry the B6 haplotype (brown) and the PWK or CAST haplotype (blue) in the associated locus. B6, C57BL/6J; 129S, 129S1/SvIm; NOD, NOD/ShiLtJ; WSB, WSB/EiJ; NZO, NZO/HILtJ; CAST, CAST/EiJ; PWK, PWK/PhJ.",
