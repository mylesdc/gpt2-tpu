The sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility and clinical performance of mOTNRT-PCR were evaluated and compared with individual real time PCR (RT-qPCR) assay using clinical samples. The analytical sensitivity of mOTNRT-PCR assay was 5 copies/reaction for RSV, HRV and HMPV, respectively, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory viruses was observed. The coefficients of variation (CV) of intra-assay and inter-assay were between 0.51 to 3.67%. Of 398 nasopharyngeal aspirates samples tested, 109 (27.39%), 150 (37.69%) and 44 (11.06%) were positive for RSV, HRV and HMPV, respectively, whereas 95 (23.87%), 137 (34.42%) and 38 (9.55%) were positive for RSV, HRV and HMPV, respectively, by individual RT-qPCR assay. Thirty three samples that were positive by mOTNRT-PCR but negative by RT-qPCR were confirmed as true positives by sequencing using reported traditional two-step nested PCR assay. Conclusion: mOTNRT-PCR assay reveals extremely higher sensitivity than that of RT-qPCR assay for detecting RSV, HRV and HMPV in clinical settings.",

RSV and HMPV are negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses of the family Pneumoviridae. HRV is a small and positive single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family. RSV, HMPV and HRV can cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory infection to more severe lower respiratory infection in children and adults. In particularly, the young children, the elderly, severely immunecompromised adults are at high risk of serious disease following RSV, HMPV or HRV infection [4] [5] [6] [7] .

Compared with the RT-qPCR assays, the specificities of the mOTNRT-PCR assay in detection of RSV, HRV and HMPV were more than 95% and the sensitivities of the mOTNRT-PCR assay were 100%. Thirty three samples that were positive by mOTNRT-PCR but negative by RT-qPCR were confirmed as true positives by sequencing using the traditional two-step nested PCR assay [16] . The detailed sequencing results were shown in Additional files 1, 2 and 3.",

Mono RT-qPCR [11, 12, 14] cannot simultaneously detect RSV, HRV and HMPV infections. Multiple PCR assays [8, 13] enable detection of co-infection but are either more likelihood of cross-contamination or insensitive. The two-step nested PCR assay has the high sensitivity [16] , however, is more likelihood of cross-contamination. LNA modification can be performed on any base of the oligonucleotide strand resulting in increased melting temperature and improved amplification sensitivity and specificity [17] . LNA has been used in many applications including the detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses [18] , real-time PCR probes [19] , microarray probes [20] and PCR primers [17] . In this study, we used LNA-modified primers to develop a mOTNRT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of RSV, HRV and HMPV. To our best knowledge, this is the first report on the simultaneous detection of RSV, HRV and HMPV in a closed one-tube using LNA.",

            "text": "In the mOTNRT-PCR assay, the LNA-modified outer primers of RSV, HRV and HMPV had higher annealing temperatures than the inner primers thus possibly allowing an independent reaction during the amplification. The purpose of this design was to maximize the difference in the annealing temperatures (64\u00b0C vs 54\u00b0C) of the outer primer modified by LNA and inner primer sets, allowing one-step nested amplification to be carried out. The 10\u00b0C difference in the melting temperature between outer and inner primers was applicable for developing a one-tube nested PCR successfully in our previous reports [21, 22] . According to the rule of TSP [21, 22] , the LNA-outer primers were carried out at a high annealing temperature (64\u00b0C) in the initial cycles of the mOTNRT-PCR, enabling hybridization of only the outer primers, and later cycles were carried out at a lower annealing temperature (54\u00b0C), which enables hybridization of both the inner primers to the amplicons and the antisense oligonucleotides to the outer primers.To minimize the primer competition and ensure that the final amplification products were inner primer products of RSV, HRV and HMPV, the working concentration of each primer were optimized.The reaction conditions of the mOTNRT-PCR assay were also optimized, and this enabled the detection of RSV, HRV and HMPV with extremely high sensitivity (5copies /reaction) while maintaining good specificity as shown in this study (Fig. 1) . This mOTNRT-PCR assay was further evaluated and compared with RT-qPCR assay using 398 clinical samples. As shown in Table 3 , the positive sample numbers of RSV, HRV and HMPV detected by RT-qPCR were 95 (23.87%), 137 (34.42%) and 38 (9.55%), respectively. In comparison with RT-qPCR, additional 14 of RSV positive sample,13 of HRV positive sample and 6 of HMPV positive sample were detected only by mOTNRT-PCR assay, respectively. Sequencing of traditional two-step nested PCR [16] product confirmed these were true positives, suggesting the mOTNRT-PCR assay is more sensitive than RT-qPCR. The originally reported sensitivity of RT-qPCR for detecting RSV [8] , HRV [9] in a multiplex PCR format and HMPV in mono RT-qPCR [10] was 5 TCID 50 /ml, not shown and 5-10 copies/reaction, respectively. Even we assume the sensitivities in the original research are comparable to the analytical sensitivities in our study, our data of clinical sensitivities are superior to the those obtained from original reports, as evidenced by the difference in the minimal Ct values for RSV (12.37 vs 17.04), HRV (12.70 vs 19.52) and HMPV (10.79 vs 13.23) between mOTNRT-PCR and corresponding RT-qPCR assays.",
