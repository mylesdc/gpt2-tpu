These include search query data for influenza-related terms, which has been explored as a tool for augmenting traditional surveillance methods. In this paper, we present a method that uses Internet search query data from Baidu to model and monitor influenza activity in China. The objectives of the study are to present a comprehensive technique for: (i) keyword selection, (ii) keyword filtering, (iii) index composition and (iv) modeling and detection of influenza activity in China. Sequential time-series for the selected composite keyword index is significantly correlated with Chinese influenza case data. In addition, one-month ahead prediction of influenza cases for the first eight months of 2012 has a mean absolute percent error less than 11%. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of search query data from Baidu in conjunction with this approach for estimation of influenza activity in China.",

In order to prepare for the next severe pandemic and better control seasonal influenza epidemics, researchers have proposed several approaches to achieve near real-time surveillance of the emergence and spread of influenza. Some novel approaches for rapid disease outbreak detection and surveillance include online surveillance systems utilizing informal sources such as news reports [2] , social media data [3\u00b116] , and search query data [17\u00b120] . The idea of using search query data for detecting outbreaks was first introduced in 2006 [17] . Ginsberg et al [18] later discussed how monitoring search queries on Google could be used to detect influenza outbreaks in the United States. Several studies followed, which pointed to the effectiveness and limitations of detecting influenza epidemics using search query data [19] , [20] . Although there are limitations, such as the lack of Internet access in some regions of the world and the noise of irrelevant information, Internet search query data is being explored as a low-cost approach to estimating disease activity in near real-time.",

The objective is therefore to estimate present influenza activity based on previously observed laboratory surveillance data plus timely search query data before official reports from China's MOH. Beyond the use of search query data in a new geographic region and the use of a different search engine, this study is an improvement on other research in this area in that, the keyword selection and composition approach presented is more economical in terms of computational resources and cost compared to the original method by Ginsberg et al [18] . Unlike the United States, in China alternative search engines such as Baidu are more widely used than Google. The market share of Google in China is less than 20%, while that for Baidu is more than 80% [29] .

Improving methods for surveillance, modeling, detection and prediction of influenza epidemics in China is extremely important.

Upon entering``A'' into the keyword tool, we obtain 94 related keywords (Table 2) . Although recommended by the keyword tool, some of the 94 keywords are not related to influenza epidemics in China. We therefore filter the keywords as follows: (i) the selected keywords should represent factors that might influence the influenza epidemic. (ii) The search query data for each keyword should be represented as a sequential Keywords that remain after the filtering analysis are considered for inclusion in the composite search index. The goal of search index composition is to build the most correlative and stable indicator for the influenza case data based on the available information. The search index is composed in two steps.

The China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) currently estimates Internet penetration in China at 39.9%. Surveillance using web-query data depends on adequate Internet access. In addition, not all searches on influenza-related terms are necessarily linked to influenza morbidity. Search queries can be a result of panic during a novel respiratory outbreak, coverage of influenza-related deaths in the media, fear or curiosity. Using several years of data in modeling should hopefully mitigate occurrences of panic induced searches since the weight of various keywords is likely to deviate from one influenza season to another.
