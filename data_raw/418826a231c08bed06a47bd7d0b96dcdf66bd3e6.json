This study was performed to investigate the effects of stress caused by dialysis treatment under isolation. Plasma samples from the HD patients and medical staff were collected at the time of isolation(M0), the following month(M1), and three months after isolation(M3). Parameters for stress included circulating cell-free genomic DNA(ccf-gDNA), circulating cell-free mitochondria DNA(ccf-mtDNA), and pentraxin-3(PTX-3). Decreased values of Hct, kt/v and ca x p were recovered after the end of two weeks of isolation. The levels of ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA were the highest at M0 and decreased gradually in both HD patients and the medical staff. The normalization of ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA was significantly delayed in HD patients compared with the response in the medical staff. PTX-3 increased only in HD patients and was highest at M0, and it then gradually decreased. Medical isolation and subnormal quality of care during the MERS outbreak caused extreme stress in HD patients. Plasma cell-free DNA and PTX-3 seems to be good indicators of stress and quality of care in HD patients. Measurement of plasma cell-free genomic DNA and cell-free mitochondria DNA. Circulating cf-DNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcL of plasma using a QIAamp DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). The ccf-gDNA and ccf-mtDNA were amplified using a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Massachusetts). Primers for the human NADH1 dehydrogenase 1 gene (ND1) were used for mtDNA, and primers for the human lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL) were used for gDNA. Standard DNA fragments of ND1 and LPL were synthesized using an Integrated DNA Technologies kit (IDT, Coralville, IA) for absolute quantification. The fragment solutions were 10-fold serially diluted. The concentrations of DNA were converted to copy number using the Andrew Staroscik Calculator for the absolute copy number from a template 33 . All samples were analyzed in duplicate, and a no-template negative control was included in every analysis.",

One patient on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) in our hospital was infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the outbreak of MERS in Korea. The 83 HD patients and 12 medical staff were exposed to the MERS patient. Facing the possibility of a large epidemic, we had to follow the guidelines by National Disaster Management; thus, we decided to quarantine all exposed HD patients and medical staff in the hospital or their home. The medical staff caring for those patients had to wear level D personal protection equipment during work and were isolated in their homes after work 2 . Patients who were quarantined irrespective of their wishes suffered from isolation and fear of infection. Fortunately, no additional patients were infected with MERS-CoV, but all HD patients and medical staff experienced extreme physical and mental stress for the 17 days of isolation.",

Forty-five percent of the patients were undergoing dialysis because of diabetes mellitus end-stage renal disease (DM-ESRD) ( Table 1 ). The average value of the Charlson comorbidity index was 4.52 \u00b1 1.86. The Hct were decreased at M1, then recovered at M3 (Fig. 1 , Table 2 ). The level of kt/v at M1 was lower than the levels before and after the MERS isolation period, but a significant difference was found only between the level of M1 and M3. The indoxyl sulfate (IS) level was not decreased at M0-M1. The levels of IS at M3 were significantly higher than those at M0 and M1 (Fig. 1) . The levels of IS at M0 closely correlated with those at M1 and M3 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Two HD patients died during quarantine. The first death was ascribed to aspiration pneumonia in an 88-year-old female patient with hypertensive ESRD. The second death was caused by mechanical ileus and pneumonia in a 91-year-old female with hypertensive ESRD. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Effect of isolation on the level of ccf-gDNA. Segregation affected the levels of circulating cf-DNA. The ccf-gDNA (LPL) was significantly elevated at M0, irrespective of whether the subject was a patient or staff member (Fig. 2) . The levels of ccf-gDNA decreased over time, but the decrease was delayed in HD patients. At M1, ccf-gDNA levels were significantly higher in HD patients than in the medical staff. The ccf-gDNA level initially abruptly decreased in medical staff but slowly reduced in HD patients. The delta value of ccf-gDNA between M0 and M1 and between M1 and M3 was not different between HD patients and medical staff. These results indicated that stress was sufficient to increase ccf-gDNA levels both in HD patients and medical staff. However, the correction of increased ccf-gDNA levels was delayed in HD patients.",

The levels of ccf-mtDNA as a stress marker were negatively correlated with those of Hb and Hct and positively associated with those of ferritin, an acute reactive protein. We had no sooner tried to correct anemia than MERS quarantine terminated. Significant increases in Hct at M3 reflected the effort. IS is protein-bound uremic retention that originates during intestinal fermentation 10 . IS concentrations were lower in HD patients maintaining a vegetarian diet compared with those in patients on a diet that included meat 11 . These results suggested that IS could be a nutritional marker. Our data also showed that the concentration of IS significantly increased after isolation. We speculated that the increase in IS levels related to nutrient recovery. HD patients and medical staff complained of poor meals and did not enjoy the food because they were provided only with lunch boxes. The increase in IS levels at M3 corresponded to the change of nutrition that accompanied the end of isolation.",

Living alone and working with protective equipment can cause high levels of mental and physical stress in not only patients but also healthcare workers during quarantine 12, 13 . The result that the level of ccf-gDNA was higher in the HD patients under SRI reflected their severe stress. Levels of circulating cf-DNA steadily decreased in both patients and staff after isolation, but the decrease was delayed in the HD patients. Circulating cf-DNA in plasma www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ indicates inflammation or cell death following cellular stress and tissue damage 3 . ccf-mtDNA containing CpG DNA repeats is known to attract neutrophils and activate immune cells [14] [15] [16] [17] . Phagocytes quickly ingest the contents from apoptotic cells, therefore circulating cf-DNA is present in the circulation before phagocytes arrive 18 . When the engulfment of apoptotic bodies is reduced, or cell death is amplified, circulating cf-DNA can be substantially elevated 19 . Cellular apoptosis is common in HD patients due to chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction 20, 21 . We suspected that more cells had undergone apoptotic and necrotic cell death or immune cells could not process circulating cf-DNA in HD patients. Also, chronic inflammation related to uremia, malnutrition, www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and calcification might have caused the late recovery of circulating cf-DNA. However, this study did not find a difference in the levels of circulating cf-DNA between HD patients and medical staff. Stress circumstances might be related to higher levels of ccf-mtDNA because chronic stress could alter the mitochondrial structure and lead to mitochondrial damage 22, 23 . Healthcare workers, including nurses and medical doctors, are recognized as experiencing high levels of occupational stress 24 . Constantly elevated levels of circulating cf-DNA, especially ccf-mtDNA, are thought to reflect continuous occupational stress in our medical staff. We conducted a survey www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ using Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) targeting the HD patients and medical staff at 12 months after the quarantine ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ) 25 . The results identified the IES-R score at post-MERS was higher in medical staff than in HD patients. And post-MERS IES-R scores correlated positively with levels of ccf-mtDNA at M1. Healthcare workers responded with higher levels of psychological stress during the 2003 SARS outbreak 26 . They more easily recognize someone who will need to be hospitalized or die from infectious diseases. Thus, they might have worried more about becoming infected by MERS-CoV whenever they contacted patients. The higher IES-R scores in medical staff reflected the greater psychological impact and physical work stress. However, circulating cf-DNA was still not higher in HD patients than in medical staff at M3. If chronic inflammation was the only reason for the delay in processing circulating cf-DNA, it would be elevated in HD patients at M3. Therefore, insufficient care could be the main factor that caused the delayed recovery of circulating cf-DNA.",

We collected 3 mL of whole blood in EDTA-coated tubes at 2, 4, and 16 weeks after isolation. Two weeks after the quarantine was included in the isolation period; therefore, we defined the sample taken at 2 weeks as \"M0\". Samples obtained at 4 and 16 weeks after isolation were named M1 and M3, respectively. Briefly, whole blood was centrifuged at 1,500 \u00d7 g at room temperature for 10 min, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Plasma samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C and used after 12-16 months of storage. This study was approved by the Clinical Institutional Review Board of Gangdong Kyung Hee University Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Data collection.

We obtained laboratory data, including serum hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), albumin, hsCRP, total cholesterol, single-pool kt/v, etc. for several months before and after isolation. Single-pool kt/v was calculated based on intradialytic blood urea reduction and weight change 31 . Sampling during the MERS quarantine resumed after the isolation was terminated; thus, the July sample was obtained four weeks after isolation. Accordingly, it was collected together with the sample to test for circulating cfDNA and PTX-3 at M1. Measurement of plasma indoxyl sulfate. Indoxyl sulfate was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection 32 . The chromatographic equipment was an Agilent 1260 Infinity system (Agilent Technologies, Germany). The samples were prepared by mixing 250 \u00b5L of plasma with 900 \u00b5L of the internal standard solution, which was methyl paraben (100 \u00b5g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile (J.T. Baker; Deventer). Then, the samples were vortexed and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3500 rpm, and 250 \u00b5L of supernatant was transferred to the HPLC system. The separation was performed on a Spherisorb OSD-2 C18 column (250 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m, Waters) with sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and acetonitrile (10:90, v/v; J.T. Baker; Deventer) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.3 mL/min. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 280 and 375 nm, respectively. Figure 5 . The change of circulating-cfDNA depending on isolation methods in HD patients The levels of circulating cf-DNA were similar in the patients on SRI and CI. However, (A) the level of ccf-gDNA was significantly higher in the patients on SRI at M1 and M3 than them on CI. (B) The level of ccf-mtDNA was not different depending on the method of isolation.
