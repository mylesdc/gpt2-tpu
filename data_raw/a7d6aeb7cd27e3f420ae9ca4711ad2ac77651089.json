Infections commonly considered to cause mild or self-limiting disease in immunocompetent hosts, can lead to unusual presentations with increased severity, mortality or duration [4] [5] [6] and numerous community-acquired respiratory viral infections are implicated in triggering rejection episodes [7] . As a consequence, lung transplant recipients are frequently tested for a range of common respiratory viruses, bacteria and fungi [8] [9] [10] . Despite this rigorous testing, a considerable number of episodes of respiratory symptoms remain unresolved [11] . Successful diagnosis would, however, be important for several reasons. Specific treatment is available for most bacterial and fungal pathogens and some viruses. A rapid confirmation reduces unnecessary diagnostic steps and allows to set effective measures to restrict nosocomial transmission. Excluding potential transmissible pathogens as source of the etiology is therefore equally important as their confirmation.",

The panel of routinely assessed respiratory viruses has been continuously expanded in recent years. Currently, many programs use multiplex PCR analysis targeting up to 20 different viruses, however, still not all viruses potentially relevant to the lung transplant setting can be included. Considering the high incidence of airway inflammation following lung transplantation, close monitoring of the virome may be advantageous in linking distinct pathogen signatures with specific outcomes, such as allograft dysfunction.",

Inclusion criteria were age of at least 18 years and written informed consent. The willingness to participate in the study was notable, 83.8% of asked individuals consented. Lung transplant recipients were either included at the time of transplantation (baseline enrollment) or at the time of presentation with symptoms suggestive of an airway infection (indication enrollment). Participants enrolled at baseline had planned study visits at the time of transplantation, 4-6 weeks and 1 year thereafter. Drop out rate was low with 4.1%. Additional visits were scheduled, if a patient developed symptoms suggesting an airway infection. After every indication enrollment or symptom visit a follow-up visit was scheduled. At each visit, throat swabs, plasma, urine and stool samples were obtained and patients were evaluated for signs of infection and relevant transplant outcome events. An airway infection was considered if cough and/or dyspnea and/or a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) were present (200 ml or 10% decrease [12, 16] ).

RNA and DNA were amplified in two separate workflows. For RNA amplification, a random primer with an anchor sequence (ATCGTCGTCGTAGGCTGCTCNNNNNNNN, 5 \u03bcM) [20] [21] [22] was used for reverse transcription (SuperScript III, Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) of 5 \u03bcl eluate, performed at 42\u02daC for 60 min. For the DNA workflow, 5 \u03bcl of the eluate was incubated with the same random primer as in the RNA workflow at 94\u02daC for 2 min and cooled down to 10\u02daC for 10 min. One round of second-strand synthesis (Large Klenow Fragment, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) with 5 U/\u03bcl enzyme per reaction was performed in both workflows at 37\u02daC for 30 min, followed by inactivation at 75\u02daC for 20 min. In both workflows, nucleic acids were further amplified with AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems/Thermo Fisher) using only the anchor primer (1 \u03bcM) and the following temperature protocol: 94\u02daC for 15 min; 40 cycles of 94\u02daC for 30 s, 40\u02daC for 30 s, 50\u02daC for 30 s, 72\u02daC for 1 min; 72\u02daC for 5 min. Finally, both workflows were pooled in equal amounts for library construction with NexteraXT (Illumina, San Diego, CA) prior to sequencing for 150 bp on an Illumina MiSeq with version 3 reagents and the \"FASTQ only\" workflow. Samples were demultiplexed using MiSeq Reporter v2.4.60. The whole sequencing procedure took about 2-3 working days.",

As all five patients were previously checked by multiplex PCR for the presence of respiratory viruses during routine testing but were diagnosed as negative, we first re-examined the original diagnostic test results. In two cases (gkc048 and lpt371), late amplification in the multiplex PCR was evident which, however, did not fulfill the criteria for positivity (e.g. reaching a plateau until cycle 45) and therefore was reported as negative. For patient fyc306, where CoV was detected by metagenomic sequencing, no respiratory virus diagnostics had been performed for the analyzed symptom visit. A test conducted 14 days prior to the symptom visit, however, showed evidence of late CoV amplification, but again did not fulfill the criteria for positivity. Re-analysis of the sample from the symptom visit confirmed the results of the metagenomics analysis and showed a clear positive for CoV HKU (ct 27.3). We next conducted specific PCR for rhinovirus using a simplex assay which confirmed high viral load rhinovirus infection of patient gkc048 (ct value 28) and patient lpt371 (ct value 22). The investigated sample from patient rcn630 showed a low Rhinovirus infection (ct value 36; 52 reads detected by sequencing).

Rhinovirus-specific simplex assays confirmed the presence of rhinovirus in three out of four samples with previously negative results in routine multiplex diagnostics, after HRV was detected by the metagenomic approach. The sequencing reads were distributed over the whole genome of the respective viruses ( Fig  2) highlighting that indeed a full-length genome was detected.

All our patients with either intermediate or high-risk constellation received CMV antiviral prophylaxis with valganciclovir and accordingly CMV was not detected in the 29 samples that were analyzed by metagenomic sequencing. Whether this medication has any influence on HHV-7 replication remains unknown [46] . While our metagenomic approach identified respiratory viruses in five of 29 samples with unknown etiology, in the remaining 24 symptomatic lung transplant samples no potentially disease related viruses were found, leaving the exact etiology of symptoms unclear. Whether this was due to insufficient sensitivity of the metagenomic approach, a novel virus not detected in the bioinformatic analysis or an etiology other than of viral origin remains unknown.",

A reliable metagenomics analysis must provide convincing evidence that the identified virus reads indeed indicate presence of the postulated viruses. The number of virus-specific reads, the depth of the coverage and the percent or locations of the genome covered are main parts of this information, however, no appropriate thresholds have been established in the literature so far [47] . In our hands, >10 sequencing reads and the virus genome covered at several different locations (Fig 2) provided plausible indication that the detected reads indeed indicated the presence of the postulated viruses. Nevertheless, a careful evaluation and confirmation is necessary before treatment decisions can be solely based on NGS findings.",

TTV virus loads increase under immunosuppressive therapy in the early post transplantation phase. A) TTV virus loads monitored longitudinally in blood and throat swab samples. Patients with baseline enrollment are grouped into those that never developed symptoms and those that developed at least one symptom (airway infection or dyspnea or decrease in FEV1) during the first 15 months after transplantation. There was no significant difference comparing the two patient groups at time of transplantation, at the visit closest to 5 weeks and at the visit closest to one year after transplantation (Kruskal-Wallis test, data not shown). Undetermined values were set to -2 log10 copies/\u03bcl for plotting and statistical analysis. B) Same as in A, but for HHV-7 virus loads. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0177340.g005",
