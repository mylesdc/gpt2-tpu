However, the roles of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in HPAI H5N1 viral infection remain unclear. In this study, we found that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells provided a crucial protective function in the defense against HPAI H5N1 viral infection. HPAI H5N1 viruses could directly activate \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, leading to enhanced CD69 expression and IFN-\u03b3 secretion. Importantly, we found that the trimer but not the monomer of HPAI H5N1 virus hemagglutinin (HA) proteins could directly activate \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. HA-induced \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation was dependent on both sialic acid receptors and HA glycosylation, and this activation could be inhibited by the phosphatase calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A but not by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. Our findings provide a further understanding the mechanism underlying \u03b3\u03b4 T cell-mediated innate and adoptive immune responses against HPAI H5N1 viral infection, which helps to develop novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of H5N1 infection in the future.",

To date, more than 800 people worldwide have been infected, and the mortality is over 50% (5). Most human cases of H5N1 infection present as progressive pneumonia, and the ultimate cause of death is the most severe form of acute lung injury, which is called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (6, 7) . Many viruses, including H5N1, are mutating and producing strains that are resistant to currently known vaccines or antiviral drugs (8, 9) . Thus, it is imperative to develop alternative therapeutic strategies.",

Recent studies demonstrated that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells expanded by the phosphoantigen isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) were able to kill monocyte-derived macrophages infected by human (H1N1) and avian (H9N2 or H5N1) influenza viruses (15, 16) . Peripheral \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can be rapidly activated by influenza virus (H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2) infection via a mechanism related to the mevalonate pathway (17) . However, the interaction between human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses remains poorly understood. After H5N1 infection, numerous influenza virus particles are released from the infected epithelia or macrophages (18) . In the infection microenvironment, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells undoubtedly encounter these virus particles. Therefore, investigating the direct interaction of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with HPAI H5N1 viruses is important. However, no reports of the direct effects of HPAI H5N1 viruses on human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are yet available.",

The results showed that H5N1 virus-infected TCR-\u03b4 \u2212/\u2212 mice died significantly earlier than did the WT controls ( Figure 1A) . Compared with the WT controls, the TCR-\u03b4 \u2212/\u2212 mice experienced a greater loss of body weight ( Figure 1B) . The pathological alterations observed in the stained mouse lung tissues were also more severe in the TCR-\u03b4 \u2212/\u2212 mice than in the WT controls; increased inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in the TCR-\u03b4 \u2212/\u2212 mice after H5N1 virus infection ( Figure 1C) . The wet/dry weight ratio of the lung tissue, which is a measure of lung edema, was also markedly higher in the TCR-\u03b4 \u2212/\u2212 mice 4 days after infection ( Figure 1D) .

Taken together, these results indicate that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells could be activated by HPAI H5N1 virus but are resistant to H5N1 infection.",

Therefore, we used recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA) proteins to investigate the interplay between the HPAI H5N1 virus and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Two forms of rHA proteins, namely HAF and HA-his, were constructed as previously reported (Figure 3A ) (23) . The expression of the rH5HA proteins was confirmed by Coomassie blue staining ( Figure 3B ) and by Western blotting using antibodies against the His tag ( Figure 3C ) and HA (Figure 3D) . Gel filtration chromatography was further conducted to analyze the oligomerization of rHA proteins. The majority of the HAF protein appeared as an HA trimer, while the HA-his protein appeared as an HA monomer; a few oligomeric proteins were present in both groups (Figure 3E ). Both the HAF and HA-his proteins showed hemagglutination activity (Figure 3F) , indicating their ability to bind sialo-glycoconjugates on the erythrocytes. However, higher binding ability was observed for HAF proteins than for HA-his proteins ( Figure 3F ).",

As previously reported, both \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 sialic acid receptors could be detected on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (25) . The expression level of \u03b1-2,6 sialic acid receptors was higher than that of \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid receptors ( Figure 5A ). In addition, both HAF and HA-his proteins bound directly to the surface of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, and HAF proteins had the higher binding ability. However, neither HAF nor HA-his proteins could bind to the surface of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells after neuraminidase digestion (Figures 5B,C) . Furthermore, the ability of HAF proteins to stimulate IFN-\u03b3 production disappeared after neuraminidase digestion (Figure 5D) , indicating a requirement of sialic acid receptors for the HAF-induced \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation. In addition, when HAF proteins were treated with endoglycosidase H (Endo H), only very little production of IFN-\u03b3 by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells could be detected (Figures 5E,F) , suggesting that the glycosylation of HA also plays an important role in HAF-induced \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation.",

The number of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells resident in the lung was increased after influenza A virus (H3N2) infection (10) . Dr. Mozammal Hoq et al further reported that after \u03b3\u03b4 T cells depletion in vivo, the resistance of mice to influenza A virus (H3N2 and H1N1) infection was abrogated (11) .

However, the in vivo role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in HPAI H5N1 infection and the direct effects of HPAI H5N1 viruses on human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have not yet been reported.",

However, Xue et al. recently reported that the depletion of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, especially the V\u03b34+ \u03b3\u03b4 T cell subset, significantly rescued the weight loss induced by H1N1 infection and improved the survival rate by reducing IL-17A secretion and immunopathological injury (29) . These contradictory results are likely due to the use of different influenza virus strains and treatment methods. In our study, the mice were infected with the HPAI H5N1 virus, which likely induces more severe lung injury than does the H1N1 virus. Moreover, our animal experiments were conducted in TCR-\u03b4 \u2212/\u2212 mice, which completely lack \u03b3\u03b4 T cells; however, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells may not have been completely depleted by the anti-mouse TCR \u03b3\u03b4 mAbs used in the later study.",

In our study, we demonstrate for the first time that the HPAI H5N1 virus could directly induce severe \u03b3\u03b4 T cell agglutination and activation in vitro. The expression of CD69 and the secretion levels of the cytokines GM-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, IL-4, and IL-5 in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were markedly increased after HPAI H5N1 infection. Therefore, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells could participate in viral clearance directly by the production of IFN-\u03b3 and indirectly through the regulation of other immune effector cells by the production of immunomodulatory cytokines. Moreover, the ability of the HPAI H5N1 virus to activate \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was higher than that of H1N1; this result is consistent with the in vivo virulence of these strains. H5N1 has been reported to infect many types of immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells (30) (31) (32) (33) . Nevertheless, our study confirms that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are resistant to HPAI H5N1 infection, consistent with previous reports showing that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were not susceptible to influenza A virus infection (34, 35) . Therefore, we speculate that the rapid activation response and ability to resist HPAI H5N1 infection increase the advantage of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in controlling viral infection compared with that of other immune cells.",

In its mature form, natural HA is a homotrimer with multiple glycosylation sites. In our study, two forms of recombinant hemagglutinin, namely, HA trimers and HA monomers, were successfully expressed and purified. Consistent with previous reports, HAF proteins could form HA trimers like the natural form of HA proteins and had a fold on sequence at the C-terminus, and HA-his proteins existed mainly as HA monomers (23, 36) . Although a few oligomeric proteins were present in both groups, we believe that the oligomers in the HAF group were constructed with HA trimers, while those in the HA-his group were HA monomers. Both the HAF and HA-his proteins showed hemagglutination activity; however, a higher binding ability was observed for HAF than that of HA-his, which may be related to the protein conformation. Furthermore, Chih-Jen et al. found that the immunogenicity of HA trimers was stronger than that of HA monomers in mice immunized with these recombinant HA proteins (37) . In our previous study, we found that rHA proteins derived from HPAI H5N1 could activate \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in PBMCs (25) . Here, we further confirmed that HAF proteins could not only induce \u03b3\u03b4 T cell agglutination but could also directly activate \u03b3\u03b4 T cells via mechanisms such as CD69 upregulation, IFN-\u03b3 secretion and increased intracellular calcium mobilization.",

Both the HAF and HA-his proteins bound directly to the surface of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, and HAF proteins were observed to have the higher binding ability, consistent with the agglutination ability of their \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Furthermore, we confirmed that the activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells induced by HA trimers was dependent on sialic acid receptors; HA trimers could not bind to the surface of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, and the stimulation of IFN-\u03b3 production by HA trimers disappeared after neuraminidase digestion. HA from human-derived viruses preferentially recognizes \u03b1-2,6 sialic acid receptors, whereas HA from avian viruses preferentially recognizes \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid receptors (38) . Our results confirm that although the expression level of \u03b1-2,3 sialic acid receptors is lower than that of \u03b1-2,6 sialic acid receptors, the expression is sufficient to induce \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation.

TCR \u03b3\u03b4 and NKG2D, which play critical roles in antigen recognition and \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation, are the two most important glycoprotein receptors on the surface of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. We initially examined the relative contribution of TCR \u03b3\u03b4 and NKG2D in rHA-induced \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation. However, in our study, treating \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with anti-TCR \u03b3\u03b4 and anti-NKG2D mAbs could not inhibit HA trimer-induced \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation. Nevertheless, our result cannot totally rule out the participation of TCR \u03b3\u03b4 and NKG2D in HA-induced activation, because the mAbs may not completely block the HA binding sites. Therefore, the specific glycoprotein receptors mediating the binding of HA to \u03b3\u03b4 T cells need further study. To determine the signaling pathways involved in the HA trimer-induced activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, we treated HA trimer-stimulated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells with the PI3-K inhibitors wortmannin or Ly294002 and with the immunosuppressive drug CsA. We found that HA trimer-induced \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation was inhibited by CsA but not by wortmannin or LY294002. CsA is a phosphatase calcineurin inhibitor that affects a subset of calciumassociated signaling events similar to those involved in T cell activation (40) . The inhibitory effect of CsA was also consistent with our discovery that HA trimers could induce an increase in the intracellular free calcium concentration upon \u03b3\u03b4 T cell activation.",
