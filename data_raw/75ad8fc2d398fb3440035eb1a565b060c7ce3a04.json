However, the distinct function of ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms, the downstream kinases of MEKs, remains unclear in EV71 replication. In this study, specific ERK siRNAs and selective inhibitor U0126 were applied. Silencing specific ERK did not significantly impact on the EV71-caused biphasic activation of the other ERK isoform, suggesting the EV71-induced activations of ERK1 and ERK2 were non-discriminative and independent to one another. Knockdown of either ERK1 or ERK2 markedly impaired progeny EV71 propagation (both by more than 90%), progeny viral RNA amplification (either by about 30% to 40%) and protein synthesis (both by around 70%), indicating both ERK1 and ERK2 were critical and not interchangeable to EV71 propagation. Moreover, suppression of EV71 replication by inhibiting both early and late phases of ERK1/2 activation showed no significant difference from that of only blocking the late phase, supporting the late phase activation was more importantly responsible for EV71 life cycle. Taken together, this study for the first time identified both ERK1 and ERK2 were required for EV71 efficient replication and further verified the important role of MEK1-ERK1/2 in EV71 replication.",

The two isoforms of ERKs, ERK1 and ERK2 (also referring to ERK1/2), are considered to be the only downstream substrates of MEK (including MEK1 and MEK2, also referring to MEK1/2) to date [19] . Therefore, ERK1 and ERK2, undertaking the upstream signals from MEK1/2 and in turn activating variety of their downstream substrates, are key players in ERK pathway. They share 85% similarity at the amino acid level [20] and yet it is still controversial whether the individual ERK isoform plays a distinctive role(s). Some studies suggest that ERK1 and ERK2 are interchangeable [21] [22] [23] . However, considerable evidences indicate that they might act differentially [24] [25] [26] [27] . Thus, it is still an open question, which needs to be further explored as to whether roles are unique or preferred to one or the other ERK isoform in the physiological and/or pathological processes.",

The significance of activation of ERK pathway, as one of the specific responses to infection of varieties of viruses including EV71 [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] 31, 32] , has been broadly reported. Our previous study has established the key role of MEK1 in the activation of ERK pathway induced by EV71 and proposed that MEK1-ERK1/2 signaling pathway acts as a central \"hub\" in EV71 replication [6] . However, it is still unclear if ERK1 and ERK2, the only known downstream kinases of MEK1 to date, play distinct role(s) in the life cycle of EV71. In fact, there are many studies focusing on distinction of ERK1 and ERK2 in several other areas rather than in virus replication. Meanwhile, the conclusions of these studies yet remain controversial. Although ERK1 and ERK2 are inclined to be thought of interchangeably [23] , increasing studies have provided evidences for differential roles of ERK1 and ERK2 in cell movement [24] , embryonic mice viability [33] [34] [35] , and pathophysiology of central neural system etc. [36] . Our present work investigated distinction(s) of the individual involvement of ERK1 and ERK2 in EV71 replication.",

However, in our study, single silencing specific ERK isoform did not lead any significant effect on the biphasic activation of the other isoform in cells infected with or without EV71 (Figure 1) , indicating that the activation of ERK1 and ERK2 might be various under different circumstances, although the mechanism is elusive.",

U0126 showed stronger inhibitory effect on virus replication than ERK siRNA(s) did, probably because U0126 was able to block the activation of ERK pathway more efficiently. Interestingly, double knockdown of ERK1/2 by siRNAs suppressed virus propagation, viral RNAs and proteins to a similar level compared with those of single knockdown groups, indicating that ERK1 and ERK2 probably work together in EV71 life cycle in RD cells. In addition, it is reasonable to hypothesize that activated ERK1 and ERK2 act as a functional ensemble rather than playing their roles separately in EV71 replication. This is the first to report that ERK1 and ERK2 are both required as key factors in EV71 efficient propagation, which is quite different from distinctive or interchangeable functions of ERK1 and ERK2 in several other areas [21] [22] [23] [24] 33, 34] . Combined with our previous study on MEK1 [6] , the upstream kinase of ERK1/2, these findings further verified the critical role of MEK1-ERK1/2 pathway in EV71 life cycle.",
