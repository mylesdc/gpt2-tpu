Yet it occasionally seems morally permissible to carry out non-consensual medical interventions on competent individuals for the purpose of infectious disease control (IDC). We describe two different moral frameworks that have been invoked in support of non-consensual IDC interventions and identify five desiderata that might be used to guide assessments of the moral permissibility of such interventions on either kind of fundamental justification. We then consider what these desiderata imply for the justifiability of carrying out non-consensual medical interventions that are designed to facilitate rehabilitation amongst serious criminal offenders. We argue that these desiderata suggest that a plausible case can be made in favor of such interventions.",

            "text": "Authorities in certain jurisdictions have already begun to explore the use of neuro-correctives. For instance, drug-addicted offenders are sometimes compelled to take medications that are intended to attenuate their addictive desires, 2 and sex offenders in some jurisdictions may be compelled to take testosterone-lowering drugs as a part of their criminal sentence or as a condition of their parole. 3 Moreover, as our understanding of the neural correlates of violent behavior increases, it seems plausible to speculate that we might develop effective neurocorrectives that involve the use of other pharmaceuticals 4 or novel technologies such as deep brain stimulation, 5 transcranial magnetic stimulation, 6 and neuro-feedback. 7 The ethical debate over the deployment of neuro-correctives has been increasing. 8 Much of this debate has focused on their safety and effectiveness. We shall not examine these issues here. We simply assume, for the sake of argument, that the interventions we consider are effective and have negligible side effects. Other critics have questioned whether offenders could validly consent to undergoing such an intervention, if doing so were a condition of their early release from prison. 9 In this article, we sidestep this contentious issue by assuming that the hypothetical recipients of neuro-correctives have not validly consented to undergoing the intervention. Instead, we shall argue that the considerations standardly offered in support of non-consensual interventions in IDC also offer considerable support to the permissibility of some safe and effective non-consensual neuro-correctives. 10 First, however, some definitions. We shall adopt a definition of medical interventions that is perhaps broader than colloquial use, since we shall understand it to refer not only to typical medical procedures such as pharmacotherapies and surgical procedures-measures that involve some degree of bodily invasion-but also to measures that restrict an individual's freedom of movement and association, insofar as these are used for medical reasons. For instance, we shall understand quarantine to qualify as a medical intervention. We will use the term IDC interventions to refer to medical interventions Jonathan Pugh and Thomas Douglas performed for the purposes of infectious disease control.",

Following Feinberg, we may say that \"an option is closed by compulsion when one alternative has been made impossible.\" 11 For instance, an individual may be compelled to undergo an intervention by being subjected to direct physical force. A compelled intervention is carried out without the recipient's consent, and perhaps even despite his dissent. In contrast to compulsion, coercion does not make an alternative impossible, but rather destroys its appeal by increasing its cost. 12 In contrast to the case of compulsion, in coercion, the individual does consent to the intervention, but the coercive pressure to which she has been subjected may invalidate that consent.

Performing a medical intervention nonconsensually is thought to be impermissible because it violates one or more of these rights. 13 In the IDC cases of interest to us, this reason to respect the patient's rights plausibly remains in place (it has not been forfeited). However, there is also a powerful reason to impose the medical intervention, since it will help to forestall the spread of an infectious disease. In a number of historical cases, this reason has been thought by many either to outweigh reasons to respect the individual's rights, or to deprive these rights of their normal protective force, with the result that the intervention may permissibly be imposed non-consensually.",

            "text": "One type of medical intervention that has often been used for the purposes of IDC is vaccination. Vaccinations are amongst the most effective IDC interventions that societies can employ. For instance, broad vaccination coverage is largely responsible for the widespread immunity to measles and tetanus in modern society, and it led to the eradication of smallpox in the late twentieth century. 14 Barring adverse side-effects, which are uncommon for most vaccines, and cases where an individual is insusceptible to the negative effects of an infectious disease, being vaccinated is typically beneficial to the vaccinated individual, since an effective vaccine will normally confer immunity to a particular infectious disease. However, effective individual immunization also confers benefits to third parties: immunizing a sufficient proportion of the population against a disease can disrupt its spread from person to person. In such a scenario of herd immunity, the fact that a Justifications for Non-Consensual Medical Intervention sufficient majority of the population is immune to a particular disease confers a degree of protection even to those who have not been vaccinated. 15 In light of this third-party benefit, some countries employ laws that could be described as introducing coercive pressure on individuals to undergo vaccination, insofar as they provide for the imposition of costs for vaccine refusal. 16 For instance, in the majority of states in the USA, children must normally complete a vaccination schedule as a condition of entering public school. 17 In some cases, it might be claimed that if the operative reason undergirding an individual's choice to undergo the vaccination is that they desire to avoid these state-imposed costs of non-compliance (rather than, say, because they want the health benefits of being vaccinated), then that individual may qualify as being coerced in a manner that invalidates his consent. 18 Vaccinations aim to prevent the spread of infectious disease by preventing individuals from becoming infected in the first place. However, states also impose other sorts of non-consensual medical intervention for IDC purposes. For example, in some jurisdictions it is legally permissible to compel the medical examination (and in rare cases even treatment) of persons suspected of carrying an infectious disease. 19 The non-consensual examination and treatment of individuals carrying a dangerous infectious disease can aid IDC in two ways. First, effectively treating that individual will mean that that they will no longer be able to transmit the disease to others. Second, the treatment can help to restrict the development of drug-resistant pathogens, since one way in which a pathogen can develop drug resistance is by genetically evolving as a result of an incomplete treatment. 20 Although exerting coercive pressure to undergo vaccinations and even compelling medical examinations and treatments is permitted in some jurisdictions, these are somewhat controversial non-consensual IDC interventions. The use of non-consensual quarantine and isolation, however, is often deemed to be less controversial (for reasons that we shall explore below). Both quarantine and isolation share the aim of separating certain individuals from the rest of the community in order to prevent or limit the transmission of infectious pathogens. The difference between the two lies in the diagnostic status of the detainee: in isolation, it is known that the detainee is infected, whereas quarantine involves the detention of individuals who have been (or are likely to have been) exposed to the infectious agent and are thus suspected of being (but not known to be) infected. Quarantine and isolation have long been used in response to outbreaks of infectious disease, particularly those for which no effective medical treatment is available. 21 For instance, quarantine was widely used in response to the recent outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.",

We then identify some desiderata for assessing IDC interventions that are consistent with both justifications, before arguing in the subsequent section that these desiderata support the justifiability of at least some nonconsensual neuro-correctives. It might be argued that non-consensual interventions in IDC can be morally justified by appealing to classic utilitarian reasoning. On such a view, these interventions would be permissible if they are predicted to bring about at least as much aggregate well-being as any alternative course of action. However, few have been persuaded by such justifications. As T. M. Wilkinson points out, this sort of utilitarian thinking runs contrary to the belief, commonly held in biomedical ethics, that people have certain rights that \"constrain the pursuit of the greater good.\" 22 Many theorists reject the simple utilitarian approach because of its failure to accommodate this belief amongst others; indeed, some may claim that this failure gives us reason to be skeptical of making any consequentialist considerations central to the justification of either medical or criminaljustice interventions, the two types of intervention with which we are concerned in this article. We shall now set out two alternative justifications to which defenders of non-consensual interventions have turned, which are both compatible with the belief that rights should constrain the pursuit of the good, but which may nonetheless be used to justify certain non-consensual interventions in IDC.",

            "text": "The first justification retains a broadly consequentialist approach but incorporates a richer account of the good than the utilitarian's appeal to aggregate well-being, and sets certain side-constraints on the pursuit of this good. We shall call this version the constrained consequentialist approach. Lawrence Gostin offers an example of it in his influential Public Health Law: Duty, Power and Restraint. In introducing his account, Gostin writes: \"The prime objective of public health law is to pursue the highest possible level of physical and mental health in the population, consistent with the values of social justice.\" He later expands on this claim by suggesting that the twin aims that motivate public health interventions are \"to advance human wellbeing by improving health, and to do so particularly by focusing on the needs of the most disadvantaged.\" 23 These passages suggest that Gostin deviates from utilitarianism in two respects. While he believes, like the utilitarian, that interventions must promote individual well-being, his appeals to social justice and the needs of the most disadvantaged suggest that, unlike the utilitarian, he does not regard aggregate wellbeing as the sole determinant of the good, but instead believes that the distribution of well-being across the community should be incorporated into the theory of the good. Moreover, the claim that the objective of public health law is to pursue high levels of health in a manner that is consistent with the values of social justice leaves open the possibility that the pursuit of good outcomes may be side-constrained-that is to say, there may be certain means to pursuing those outcomes that are ruled out, regardless of how good their effects would be. The nature of the constraints will depend on the theory of social justice that one adopts in cashing out the framework. Notably Justifications for Non-Consensual Medical Intervention in claiming that public health ought to focus on the \"needs of the most disadvantaged,\" 24 Gostin himself seems to implicitly endorse a fundamentally prioritarian account of social justice. Some prioritarians set side-constraints on the pursuit of the good by claiming that our pursuit of general well-being should be constrained by the principle that we must not select any option in which the worst-off individuals will be worse off than the worst-off individuals in any alternative distribution. 25 A second approach to the justification of non-consensual IDC interventions treats the imposition of such interventions as an instance of justified self-defense. We may say that an agent is acting in self-defense if she is acting to prevent another (the attacker) from harming her. 26 In the context of IDC, it has been suggested that it may be legitimate to think of an infected (or potentially infected) individual as an attacker, and other members of the public as potential victims who may be justified in defending themselves against the attacker, by, for example, imposing an IDC intervention. 27 In what follows, we will not seek to adjudicate between constrained consequentialist and self-defense justifications for IDC interventions.",

Furthermore, it should be noted that, though the desiderata we shall outline are consistent with both constrained consequentialist and selfdefence justifications, their interpretation may depend on which of these fundamental justifications one accepts.

            "text": "The first desideratum is the gravityby which we mean the moral weight -of the harm the intervention aims to prevent. This weight may depend, inter alia, on the magnitude of the harm, its qualitative importance, the likelihood or certainty with which it will occur, and its impact on distributive fairness. 28 The graver the harm, the easier it will be to justify the intervention. The second desideratum is the effectiveness of the intervention in preventing the harm. In IDC, this effectiveness will depend on the nature of the infectious disease, the nature of Jonathan Pugh and Thomas Douglas the intervention, and the context in which the intervention is to be deployed. Consider, for instance, the attempt to limit the spread of infectious disease by imposing mass quarantine: this solution will only be effective in preventing the spread of an infectious agent if it is possible to identify people likely to be incubating the infection, and if those people comply with the conditions of quarantine. Furthermore, the infectious agent must be transmissible in its pre-symptomatic or early symptomatic stages for quarantine to be effective in preventing further transmission. 29 A third desideratum is that the interventions have low opportunity costs. The expenditure of economic resources on a public health intervention necessarily diverts funds from other potentially beneficial public projects, including projects that might themselves promote public health. 30 The opportunity cost of an intervention is the value of the alternative use to which the resources invested in the intervention would otherwise have been put. The higher the opportunity cost, the more difficult it will be to justify the intervention. In many cases, determining the opportunity cost of an intervention is difficult because it is unclear how the resources would otherwise be spent. However, even in those cases it may be possible to make a (necessarily uncertain) estimate of the expected opportunity costs. Moreover, in other cases, opportunity costs are quite clear: consider the position of a committee that has been given a fixed budget to spend on fighting a new pandemic and is assessing competing proposals for the use of those funds.",

The fourth desideratum calls for the IDC intervention to be the least restrictive of the available alternatives for preventing the harm. As the discussion in section I makes clear, many effective IDC interventions can impose significant burdens on the individuals they target. In overriding a competent individual's refusal to consent, we arguably infringe his right to autonomy, and we may, depending on the intervention, also infringe other moral rights such as rights to bodily integrity, and freedom of movement and association. In view of these possible rights infringements, it has been suggested that public health authorities should realize their IDC goals through the use of the least restrictive alternative of the available options. 31 The definition of restrictiveness here has important ramifications for the moral foundations of a least restrictive alternative desideratum. It might be claimed that the restrictiveness of an intervention depends on the extent to which it infringes upon the recipient's moral rights. 32 Notably, the understanding of rights that such an account might invoke need not assume that rights must trump all other considerations; an intervention may be permissible (on broadly consequentialist grounds or grounds of self-defense) even if it infringes another's rights, as long as it is the intervention that infringes rights to the least extent of all available (effective) interventions. Of course, how the extent of rights infringements is to be determined is open to debate.",

Such approaches are backward-looking in the sense that they claim that the appropriateness of a particular correctional intervention depends ultimately on the offender's past conduct (which renders him deserving of hard treatment), not on the effects of the intervention. As such, retributivism contrasts with forward-looking consequentialist approaches to criminal justice, which claim that the appropriateness of a particular correctional intervention is to be established by determining whether it will lead to good consequences.

Notably, the latter can be understood as partially integrating both retributive and crime-prevention elements, since on this approach force may only permissibly be used on aggressors, even if the primary purpose is to avert harm. 44 That said, the limit of using force only on aggressors does not ensure compliance with negative retributivism, since some aggressors may arguably be innocent or only very mildly culpable. Moreover, even when the desiderata are understood as being undergirded by a constrained consequentialist theory, the approach is not vulnerable to some of the criticisms of advocating rehabilitation as a central unconstrained consequentialist aim of punishment. For instance, one such criticism is that an unconstrained consequentialist approach would seem to allow for any sort of harsh treatment that would achieve the goal of rehabilitation, including interventions that would traditionally be ruled out as disproportionate by retributive approaches. However, the constrained consequentialist approach we have outlined can avoid this criticism by incorporating a proportionality requirement that limits the sorts of interventions we may impose on offenders in the name of rehabilitation. 45 Let us turn, then, to applying the five desiderata outlined in the previous section to the case of neurocorrectives. Consider first the gravity of the harm that neuro-correctives seek to prevent. It seems plausible to claim that neuro-correctives could be used to prevent serious harms, since many crimes cause serious harm (both physical and mental) to their victims. Indeed, in some cases (most obviously in the case of murder), the harm caused to the victim may be comparable in seriousness to the harm of his contracting a lethal infectious disease. Furthermore, criminal offending leads to other indirect costs for other members of society, since resources must be spent in order to, inter alia, provide support to victims of crime and apprehend and punish criminal offenders; in the UK, the cost to the taxpayer of reoffending is estimated to be \u00a39.5 billion to \u00a313 billion per year. 46 However, even if criminal offending often causes harm to its victims, it might be argued that there are nonetheless significant differences between the harms caused by criminal offending and the harms caused by the spread of infectious disease. First, it might be claimed that the certainty with which the harm will occur Justifications for Non-Consensual Medical Intervention in the absence of intervention is typically higher in IDC than it is in criminal justice: we cannot predict whether a criminal offender will reoffend with the same degree of accuracy with which we can predict that an individual carrying an infectious disease will transmit it to others. Although various risk-assessment instruments have been used to assist sentencing and release decisions in both the U.S. and the U.K., 47 they all have a number of well-documented problems. 48 Recidivism can thus currently be predicted only with limited accuracy, and false positive assessments are likely in this context. 49 However, this does not mean that the harms associated with criminal recidivism can be predicted with less confidence than those associated with infectious disease; public health authorities sometimes have to use risk-prediction instruments that have comparably limited predictive accuracy. Consider cases in which the transmission of an infectious agent depends on the vector engaging in certain behaviors, such as in sexually transmitted infections. In assessing whether an infected individual poses a threat to public health, authorities must determine the risk of that agent's engaging in unprotected sexual intercourse. It seems doubtful that they could make such an assessment with a significantly greater degree of certainty than an assessment of whether a violent criminal offender is likely to reoffend. Another case in which public health authorities may face significant uncertainty in their predictions of threats to public health is the implementation of quarantine. In quarantine, healthy individuals can be subjected to compulsory detention just because they have been exposed to an infectious agent, even though they themselves may not be infected, and the threat they actually pose to others is thus uncertain.",

Incarceration involves very extensive intrusions on freedom of movement and association; neurocorrectives, by contrast, need not always involve extensive intrusions on bodily integrity (for example, of the sort involved in surgical procedures) but might rather involve relatively moderate forms of physical interference, such as, for example, the administration of a drug via nasal spray, or the administration of a very weak electric current (as in transcranial direct current stimulation). One of us has argued elsewhere that, taking into account both the importance of the rights and the extent of their infringement, the rights infringements involved in incarceration are at least as grave as those involved in the administration of a drug via injection, 56 which would plausibly make them more grave than those involved in the administration of a drug in less physically invasive ways.",

Furthermore, these effects may also be unintended when they are brought about during the course of currently employed penal methods, while it is the express purpose of neuro-correctives to bring them about. In view of the fact that Justifications for Non-Consensual Medical Intervention neuro-correctives involve intentionally changing another person's mental states, those scholars who stress the importance of relational conditions of autonomy might claim that the use of neuro-correctives involves the exertion of third-party control over another person's mental states in a way that non-intentional effects on a prisoner's mental states do not. 59 It thus seems plausible to claim that the former are more mentally invasive and arguably more autonomy-undermining than traditional penal methods.",

One of the main problems with assessing the moral justification of different sorts of non-consensual interventions in IDC or criminal justice are the tradeoffs that will often occur between the desiderata we delineated in the previous section.

It might be argued that interventions with a degree of restrictiveness that is above a proportionality threshold would be ruled impermissible, even if they are the least restrictive of the available alternatives, or offer the best combination of restrictiveness and effectiveness. It could then be argued that neuro-correctives would, by virtue of their physical and mental invasiveness, invariably fall above this threshold. Moreover, it might be argued that many IDC interventions are disanalogous with neuro-correctives on this front: since many IDC interventions benefit their victim in some sense (in so far as they might treat individuals or prevent them from suffering an infectious disease), they are generally less restrictive, all things considered, than neuro-correctives, and are more likely to fall below a proportionality threshold of the sort that we are discussing here. 62 At this juncture, it seems that the precise interpretation of the proportionality desideratum becomes particularly salient. Consider first the equivalent harm view of proportionality. On this view, the use of a nonconsensual neurocorrective will only be proportionate if it prevents harms that are comparable to the harm caused by the intervention. As we have explained above, it seems that the use of some (although not all) non-consensual neuro-correctives might involve profound harms.

After making that argument, we pointed out that even though neuro-correctives need not always involve profound harms to the recipient of the sort that are described in the literature, they may not be the least restrictive alternative rehabilitative measure available. However, in assessing the non-consensual use of such interventions, considerations of restrictiveness must be weighed against the desideratum of effectiveness; even if less restrictive rehabilitative alternatives are available, we may nonetheless have sufficient reason to use neuro-correctives if they are more effective in preventing recidivism.

Although we cannot offer a full treatment of this issue here, it should be noted that our arguments do not extend straightforwardly to this practice. Currently, one significant barrier to reliably predicting the risk of offending amongst non-offenders is that one of the main statistical predictors of future criminal offending is past criminal offending; for obvious reasons, this predictive factor would be absent in the risk assessment of non-offenders. Given the potentiality for error and abuse, and the various reasons we have to try to minimize the extent to which the state may legitimately exercise coercive power over citizens, this epistemological barrier represents a sufficient reason to only permit the use of neuro-interventions as a postconviction sanction.",

Suppose, completely fantastically, that we could, with 100% accuracy and reliability, predict that an individual with no history of criminal offending will culpably bring about a significant harm, and that psychosocial rehabilitation would not be effective in preventing him from doing so. What should we do in the absence of the epistemological barrier? Whilst we should be wary of state abuse of this power, in the theoretically pure case of a thought experiment, we suggest that the \"bullet\" of believing that it could be morally permissible to carry out a non-consensual neurocorrective on such an individual to prevent this harm becomes easier to bite; it is difficult to see how the mere fact that this person's criminal Jonathan Pugh and Thomas Douglas offence lies in the future rather than the past should be an impediment to preventing the harm that he will otherwise certainly bring about. 1 Notice that it might be possible to prevent recidivism in ways that do not involve the rehabilitation of the offender. For instance, incapacitating offenders by incarcerating them can be understood as an anti-recidivist measure. Since it seems that neuro-interventions that serve to incapacitate an offender would face additional moral problems in comparison to rehabilitative neuro-correctives, we shall consider in this article only those interventions that might be used to prevent recidivism by facilitating rehabilitation. 10 Derk Pereboom has discussed the possibility of providing a non-retributive justification of incarceration that is compatible with free-will skepticism by appealing to similarities between the justification of quarantine and incarcerating criminal offenders on the assumption that they do not deserve to be punished. See Pereboom, Free Will, Agency, and Meaning; Pereboom,\"Free Will Skepticism\"; and Pereboom, Living without Free Will. More recently, Gregg Caruso, in \"Free Will Skepticism,\" has developed Pereboom's model within a broader justificatory framework of public health ethics. We are sympathetic to many of the claims made in these works, particularly Caruso's claim that we should give greater priority to the prevention of recidivism in criminal justice. However, unlike Pereboom and Caruso, our interest in this article is not to establish a non-retributive justification of incarceration but rather to investigate the extent to which the moral justification of non-consensual medical interventions in public health might be used to justify the use of comparable non-consensual interventions in criminal justice. Furthermore, we consider alternative accounts of the justification of nonconsensual public health interventions to Caruso's. In fact, the arguments we make here may be understood to extend Caruso's conclusions regarding the nonretributive justification of incarceration to the use of neuro-correctives as anti-recidivist measures.",

However, even if the agent is fully excused for posing a threat of harm, he may still be liable to defensive harm if he bears some degree of moral responsibility for posing a threat of harm.

That public health ethics justifications for non-consensual interventions seem also to work for neuro-correctives suggests that there is a prima facie case for using neuro-correctives. Thus, even if one thinks that the latter could not permissibly be incorporated within criminal justice systems, our arguments suggest that there may be reasons to use neuro-correctives outside criminal justice; for instance, as part of some kind of separate public protection system. 49 A further higher-order problem with actuarial instruments is the number of difficulties in measuring their predictive accuracy. See Rice and Harris, \"Violent Recidivism.\" 50 See Offley, \"Influenza Vaccination\"; Doshi, \"Influenza.\" 51 L\u00f6sel and Schmucker, \"Effectiveness of Treatment.\" It should be acknowledged that these numbers refer to a sample that includes offenders who have received either chemical or physical castration. 52 See Gostin, Public Health Law, 68. 53 DOT has commonly been used for patients suffering from tuberculosis, and it is also occasionally used in the treatment of HIV. See Bayer and Wilkinson, \"Directly Observed Therapy\"; Mitty et al., \"Directly Observed Therapy.\" 54 It might be argued that we cannot legitimately appeal to a comparison between incarceration and neuro-correctives. See Barn, \"Can Medical Interventions Serve?\" For example, it might be argued that the two interventions are intended to serve different aims. On many accounts, Justifications for Non-Consensual Medical Intervention the justification for incarcerating criminal offenders often appeals to retributive or deterrent purposes, rather than the prevention of individual recidivism. However, as we claimed above, the prevention of recidivism plausibly plays some role in the justification of incarceration. This is most clearly so in cases of civil commitment. In such cases, offenders have already served a sentence that has been deemed sufficient to serve the goals of deterrence and retributivism, but they nonetheless remain incarcerated on the basis that criminal justice authorities believe that there is a significant risk that they would reoffend if released. Note also that the least restrictive kind of incarceration compatible with retaining an anti-recidivist effect would plausibly be far less restrictive than prevailing kinds of incarceration, which arguably involve harms and rights violations that are gratuitous from the point of view of preventing recidivism, and indeed may serve to encourage it. It might be objected at this point that taking incarceration as the relevant comparator is illicit, since criminal justice systems frequently have at their disposal less restrictive means of preventing recidivism, such as psychosocial rehabilitation programs. We will respond to this objection in our discussion below by appealing to the importance of the effectiveness desideratum and its relation to the least restrictive alternative desideratum. 62 However, there are other contexts in which interventions that seem comparably restrictive to neuro-correctives are used non-consensually for the prevention of similarly problematic harms. For instance, many jurisdictions have mental health legislation that allows competent but mentally disordered individuals to be treated non-consensually with mind-altering drugs when they constitute a threat to themselves or others.",
