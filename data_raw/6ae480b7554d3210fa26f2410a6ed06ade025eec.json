We have experienced three pandemics in the 20 th century (i.e., Spanish flu in 1918-1919, Asian influenza in 1957, and Hong Kong influenza in 1968) and one in the 21 st century (i.e., pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 in 2009). These influenza pandemics have a huge impact on public health and the global economy 1 . Additionally, recent sporadic human infections with H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses have raised the pandemic threat of these viruses [2] [3] [4] [5] . The continued circulation of H5N1 viruses in birds provides opportunities for them to infect humans. Indeed, human cases of H5N1 infections have been reported in several countries, with a total of 860 confirmed cases and 454 fatalities as of 30 Oct 2017, which is a case fatality rate of approximately 53% (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/2017_10_30_tableH5N1.pdf?ua=1). Therefore, concern over the pandemic potential of H5N1 viruses is clearly justified.",

Experimental infection of animal models with influenza viruses is an essential component of the characterization of influenza viruses. Mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates (NHPs) are commonly used to examine the pathogenicity, replicative ability, and transmissibility of influenza viruses, although each model has its advantages and limitations. NHPs have been frequently used as a model to characterize the virulence of various influenza viruses, such as highly pathogenic H5N1, and the 1918 and 2009 pandemic viruses, because of their close genetic relationship to humans [6] [7] [8] . 1 Division of Virology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan. 2 Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8640, Japan. 3 Intranasal and/or intratracheal inoculation with a liquid inoculum of influenza viruses has been the primary method used to infect NHPs; however, a liquid inoculum does not reflect the natural infection.",

In the ferret model, these studies demonstrated that the inoculation of animals with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus via the aerosol route led to higher nasal wash virus titers, earlier onset of clinical signs, and/or a broader spectrum of disease compared with infection via intranasal inoculation despite no difference in lethality [9] [10] [11] . In a murine model, Belser et al. 12 15 recently established aerosol infection with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in the NHP model; however, they have not compared the outcomes in the NHPs infected via the aerosol route with those in NHPs infected via the conventional method of liquid virus inoculation. Therefore, in this study, we compared the virus distribution, pathogenicity, and disease outcome in NHPs infected via the aerosol route with these parameters in NHPs infected through multiple routes (e.g., the intranasal and intratracheal routes).",

A wide range of commercial nebulizers are available for clinical and research use. In this study, we used the ultrasonic nebulizer NE-U17 from Omron Healthcare Co, Ltd, Japan. This was chosen because it is easy to use and could reduce the treatment time needed compared with other nebulizer devices 16 , thereby making the procedure less stressful for the animals. The particle size is also critical for aerosol inhalation because aerosol transmission (also referred to as droplet nuclei transmission) occurs when small particles (<5 \u00b5m) are inhaled. A previous study demonstrated that the NE-U17 nebulizer generates a large fine particle fraction of aerosol mass <5 \u00b5m (the mean percentage of the fine particle fraction was 46%) 16 .",

In most cases, intranasal administration with a liquid containing the virus is used to infect animals with influenza virus; however, a liquid inoculum does not reflect the natural influenza virus infection. Recently the aerosol inhalation method has been tested in several mammalian models, including mice, ferrets, and NHPs due to its resemblance to human exposure to influenza virus. Here, we inoculated NHPs with a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus via the aerosol route and showed that aerosol infection did not affect clinical outcome, but did cause more widespread infection throughout the lower respiratory tract compared with the conventional approach. The uniform infection in all of the lung lobes and the bronchial epithelium afforded by the aerosol infection system offers an advantage in some experimental settings. For example, when researchers take lung tissues for multiple purposes (e.g., virus titration, histopathology, and various OMICs analyses), they need to take samples from different parts of the lungs. Therefore, infection via the aerosol route would minimize experimental variability.",

The differences in disease outcomes between their study and ours may be caused by the different conditions used for the aerosol infection; that is, they used a head-only exposure chamber (into which the NHP's head was inserted), which allowed the animals to inhale the aerosolized H5N1 virus with an exposure duration ranging from 15 to 34 min. In contrast, we used a standard inhalation mask, which is not a tight-fitting mask and allows the animals to breathe the aerosol mist through the nose and mouth spontaneously; the exposure duration was approximately 5 min, potentially leading to virus infection with a lower dose compared to Wonderlich's study.
