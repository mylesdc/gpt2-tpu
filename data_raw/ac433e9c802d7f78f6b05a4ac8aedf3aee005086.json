            "text": "Candida auris has emerged in the past decade as a multi-drug resistant public health threat causing health care outbreaks. Here we report epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological investigations of a C. auris outbreak in a regional Omani hospital between April 2018 and April 2019. The outbreak started in the intensive care areas (intensive care unit (ICU), coronary care unit (CCU), and high dependency unit) but cases were subsequently diagnosed in other medical and surgical units. In addition to the patients' clinical and screening samples, environmental swabs from high touch areas and from the hands of 35 staff were collected. All the positive samples from patients and environmental screening were confirmed using MALDI-TOF, and additional ITS-rDNA sequencing was done for ten clinical and two environmental isolates. There were 32 patients positive for C. auris of which 14 (43.8%) had urinary tract infection, 11 (34.4%) had candidemia, and 7 (21.8%) had asymptomatic skin colonization. The median age was 64 years (14-88) with 17 (53.1%) male and 15 (46.9%) female patients. Prior to diagnosis, 21 (65.6%) had been admitted to the intensive care unit, and 11 (34.4%) had been nursed in medical or surgical wards. The crude mortality rate in our patient's cohort was 53.1. Two swabs collected from a ventilator in two different beds in the ICU were positive for C. auris. None of the health care worker samples were positive. Molecular typing showed that clinical and environmental isolates were genetically similar and all belonged to the South Asian C. auris clade I. Most isolates had non-susceptible fluconazole (100%) and amphotericin B (33%)",

The department is staffed by 3 intensivists, 30 nurses, and 4 respiratory technicians. All the surgical and medical wards are multi-bed (6 cubicles) with shared toilet facilities and some have one or two single isolation rooms. The capacity of each cubicle is 4-6 beds which are separated by curtains keeping a minimal space of 1.2 m between them. Each patient will be attended to by a caregiver who will be usually occupying the space between the patients' beds.",

The first set of environmental samples were collected on 9 October 2018, just before conducting cleaning using a chlorine-based disinfectant (1% sodium hypochlorite with 16.5% sodium chloride) and environmental decontamination with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) fumigation. Another set of swabs were collected after cleaning and decontamination of the ICU on 16 October 2018. A total of 140 environmental swabs were collected for screening purposes. Hand swabs were also collected from 35 health care workers (HCWs) in intensive care and high dependency areas. This included nurses, intensivists, respiratory therapists, and medical assistants.

The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) was amplified. The PCR reactions mixture contained 1 \u00b5L template DNA (50 ng), 1.25 \u00b5L 10\u00d7 PCR buffer, 1 \u00b5L dNTP mix (2.5 mM), 0.5 \u00b5L of each primer (10 pmol), 0.2 \u00b5L Taq polymerase (Biotaq, Bioline, Germany) (5 U/\u00b5L), BSA 0.5 \u00b5L, and water to complete the final volume of 12.5 \u00b5L. PCR was performed in an ABI PRISM 2720 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Amplifications were performed as follows: 95 \u2022 C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of 94 \u2022 C for 45 s, 52 \u2022 C for 45 s and 72 \u2022 C for 2 min, as well as a post-elongation step at 72 \u2022 C for 7 min. PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel. Sequencing reaction mixtures contained 1 \u00b5L template DNA (0.1 pmol), 1 \u00b5L primer (4 mM), 1 \u00b5L of BigDyeTM terminator (Applied Biosystems), 3 \u00b5L buffer, and 5.5 \u00b5L ultra-pure water to 10 \u00b5L final volume.

DNA sequences were edited and consensus sequences were assembled by the SeqMan package of Lasergene software (DNAStar, Madison, WI, USA). Sequences were exported as FASTA files. For preliminary identification, a homology search for the sequences of ITS was done using the BLAST tool in NCBI and CBS databases down to species level. For conclusive identification, sequences were aligned with MAFFT (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mafft/), followed by manual adjustments with MEGA v. 6.2 and BIOEDIT v. 7.0.5.2. The ML trees were constructed with MEGA v. 6.2. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was done with RAxML-VI-HPC v. 7.0.3 with non-parametric bootstrapping using 1000 replicates. For genotyping C. auris a small tandem repeat (STR) analysis was employed [25] . Briefly, DNA was extracted and purified with the MagNA Pure LC instrument and the MagNA Pure DNA isolation kit III (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Strains were resuspended in 50 \u00b5L physiological salt and after addition of 200 U of lyticase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubation for 5 min at 37 \u2022 C, 450 \u00b5L physiological salt was added. The sample was then incubated for 15 min at 100 \u2022 C and cooled down to room temperature. Four multiplex PCR reactions, which amplify 12 STR targets with a repeat size of 2, 3, or 9 nucleotides, was done for genotyping the Omani isolates, which were compared with the global collection [25] . Copy numbers of the twelve markers of all isolates were determined using GeneMapper Software 5 (Applied Biosystems). Relatedness between isolates was analyzed using BioNumerics v. 7.6.1 software (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium) via the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages, using the multistate categorical similarity coefficient.",

A retrospective search of one year prior to diagnosis of the first case in the hospital microbiology data base showed no previous isolates of C. auris. Some actions were immediately taken, including: creating awareness about C. auris among the health care workers; training all staff of involved units on standard and contact isolation precautions; involving an administration and infection control committee; regular infection control rounds for the affected units, with monitoring of adherence to hand hygiene and other precautions with immediate feedback to staff; implementing screening for C. auris on routine admission to the ICU and all contacts of positive cases; and ensuring proper terminal cleaning of rooms and bed spaces. There had been a period of six weeks where no further new cases occurred (weeks 27-32) but starting from week 33 onwards new cases were diagnosed from different units and wards (Figures 1 and 2 ). Environmental and health care worker screening was done in the ICU where most patients had been identified. This was followed by extensive environmental cleaning with infection control supervision. Cleaning was done with a chlorine-based disinfectant (1% sodium hypochlorite with 16.5% sodium chloride), in a ratio of seven tablets per 1.5 L of water. This was used for beds and all articles surrounding them and for mopping the floor. Different mops were used for each cubicle and aldehyde free alcohol wipes were employed to clean all equipment and monitors. All positive cases were isolated with designated medical equipment and toilet facilities. Extensive environmental cleaning and decontamination was done with fumigation with H 2 O 2 . In addition, the implementation of care bundles in all units, strictly enforced adherence to infection control measures, and instituting an antimicrobial stewardship program in the hospital, as well as a competency-based certification course in infection control for all HCWs were conducted. All the above measures resulted in earlier detection of cases and improving the outcome of patients, but the incidence of new cases had continued (Figure 1 ).",

The latter suggests a potential role for biofilm formation [13, 17] . The role of environmental contamination in facilitating C. auris transmission, illustrated in this outbreak, confirms previous similar findings elsewhere, including the Oxford University Hospitals outbreak where sequenced isolates from reusable equipment were genetically related to isolates from patients [17, 30] . Environmental screening can be problematic and not cost effective because of transient, sporadic contamination. For example, a report from an ICU in India reported less than 10% environmental contamination [22] . The same is true for health care workers screening, which usually result in a large number of samples and a very low positivity rate (less than 5% in the Indian [31] and UK studies [15] and zero positive out of 35 screened HCWs in our study). The single positive HCW in the UK study cared for only one patient, who was heavily colonized with C. auris but was not implicated in any onward transmissions, which further questions the practical implication of screening health care workers [17] . The intensive care units had been hotspots for C. auris with a great challenge in breaking the vicious cycle of environment/workers contamination-patient contamination infection [32] .",

Phylogenomic analysis using ITS sequences and STR genotyping show that the Omani isolates belong to the South Asian clade.

The above measures resulted in ending the MERS-CoV transmission but new cases of C. auris continued to occur. J. Fungi 2019, 5, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 13",
