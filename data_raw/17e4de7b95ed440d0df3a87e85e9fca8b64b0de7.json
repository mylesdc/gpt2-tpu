            "text": "Understanding the effect of media on disease spread can help improve epidemic forecasting and uncover preventive measures to slow the spread of disease. Most previously introduced models have approximated media effect through disease incidence, making media influence dependent on the size of epidemic. We propose an alternative approach, which relies on real data about disease coverage in the news, allowing us to model low incidence/high interest diseases, such as SARS, Ebola or H1N1. We introduce a network-based model, in which disease is transmitted through local interactions between individuals and the probability of transmission is affected by media coverage. We assume that media attention increases self-protection (e.g. hand washing and compliance with social distancing), which, in turn, decreases disease model. We apply the model to the case of H1N1 transmission in Mexico City in 2009 and show how media influence-measured by the time series of the weekly count of news articles published on the outbreak-helps to explain the observed transmission dynamics. We show that incorporating the media attention based on the observed media coverage of the outbreak better estimates the disease dynamics from what would be predicted by using media function that approximate the media impact using the number of cases and rate of spread. Finally, we apply the model to a typical influenza season in Washington, DC and estimate how the transmission pattern would have changed given different levels of media coverage.

Recognizing the importance of individuals' actions in preventing the spread of infection, researchers are beginning to explore mathematical models that incorporate such actions [1, 2] . These models have been used to inform strategies to control the spread of disease [3] and to quantify the role of individual protective actions in controlling several outbreaks, including the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa [4] , the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong [5] and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Central Mexico [6] . PLOS A number of models have linked media communication about a disease to protective action [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . These models postulate that media influence increases with the number of infected people [7] [8] [9] , or with both the number of infected people and the rate of change [10, 11] . Models typically assume that media influence reduces the effective transmission rate, slowing the spread of disease. The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) framework used to evaluate the effect of media on disease transmission can be described by the following set of equations:",

The media function slows the rate of transmission of the disease when the number of cases is high or when the prevalence of disease is increasing rapidly, creating interesting disease spread dynamics, such as multi-wave outbreaks [8, 9] . It is not clear, however, that the media function formalization suggested by the models adequately reflects actual media influence [12] .

We model media signal as a function of the actual number of articles published about the disease. Therefore, the media signal in our model is independent of the size of the outbreak. The proposed model is an extension of our previous model, ALARM [14] , which attempted to quantify the level of social reaction to disease, but which did not take the role of media into account in the disease transmission process. The key observation that drove the formulation of the ALARM model was that public reaction to a disease is frequently disproportionate to the number of cases. Some outbreaks with very few cases trigger outsized public alarm-for example, the handful of cases of Ebola in the US-while larger and more deadly outbreaks-such as the annual outbreaks of seasonal influenza-generate little interest. Factors such as the novelty of the disease in the area and its clinical severity play a role in shaping the public reaction. By incorporating actual media data into models of disease transmission, we can begin to account for those factors in the transmission dynamics and evaluate their significance in the disease transmission process.",

Two parameters, \u03b1 and \u03bb, determine how the media signal affects the rate of transmission. Specifically, \u03bb determines the relative importance of recent and prior news coverage in determining individual behavior. As \u03bb increases, the relative weight of recent news articles increases, compared with prior news articles. The parameter \u03b1 controls the degree to which media affects behavior. As \u03b1 increases, media exerts greater influence on behavior, leading to greater reduction in the per contact transmission probability. The effects of \u03bb and \u03b1 on the number of cases and the media function g are shown in Fig 1 for an outbreak in a population of size 500,000 with five weeks of constant media coverage beginning five weeks after the beginning of the outbreak. As \u03bb increases, the effect of media becomes more prominent but for a shorter duration. As \u03bb increases, peak height of media function increases (for \u03b1 greater than 0), indicating that the effect of media gets stronger (lower transmission probability). On the other hand, the rate at which the media function value goes back to one (no media effect) from the peak (maximum media effect) also increases as \u03bb increases, suggesting a shorter duration of media effect. This phenomenon is explained by exponentially-weighted moving average function describing \u03bb: smaller \u03bb considers the media coverage from further back in the past, creating the lingering media effect as observed in the long tail of the media function curve for \u03bb = 1. High values of \u03bb can produce two wave outbreaks, if the value of \u03b1 is high enough to dramatically slow transmission but not high enough to altogether stop transmission for long enough for the outbreak to die out. As \u03b1 increases, media causes greater reductions in the rate of transmission.",

When a = 0 and b > 0, increases in the rate of change of the infected population lead to reductions in the transmission rate. When a > 0 and b = 0, increases in the size of the infected population lead to reductions in the transmission rate. When a > 0 and b > 0, both the size of the infected population and the rate of change affect the transmission rate. Fig 3A compares the proposed media function, g, with the media function, f, each using its best-fit parameters for Mexico City. Function f was fit using the same implementation, the best-fit parameters values equal to p 0 = 0.319, k = 2, a = 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 , and b = 9.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 . The actual number of news articles per week and the observed number of new cases per week are shown in Fig 3B and 3C . Fig 3C compares the best-fit curve obtained using the proposed media function with the bestfit curve obtained using the media function f. Since f is dependent upon the rate of change and size of the infected population, f results in the greatest reduction in transmission during the fall outbreak, instead of the spring outbreak. As depicted in Fig 3C, f overestimates the fall outbreak and underestimates the spring outbreak, resulting in much greater mean absolute error of 3733, three times the MAE obtained using the proposed media function. We have also compared the best-fit curve obtained using the proposed media function, g, with the best-fit curve obtained without using a media function to evaluate the effectiveness of the media function. The best-fit parameters were p 0 = 0.289 and k = 2. The model without a media function overestimates both the spring and fall outbreaks, resulting in MAE of 1865, fifty percent over the MAE obtained using the proposed media function. During the spring outbreak where significant media coverage was observed, the model overestimates the peak by over twice as much. In order to replicate the dynamics of the two outbreaks of disease without considering additional control measures, consideration of factors affecting behavior other than the number of infected cases or rate of change in the number of infected cases is necessary. We found that use of actual media data fills the void, allowing us to account for the heightened attention to the disease in the spring that led to the extreme social distancing that eventually curtailed the outbreak.",

We have shown that media signal can be successfully modeled using real data on news coverage, and that using actual news coverage data better captures the disease dynamics compared to the estimation using the media function that uses the number of cases and rate of change in the number of cases. First, we demonstrated the theoretical properties of the proposed media function. The media function is affected by the observed volume of media coverage, as well as two parameters, \u03bb and \u03b1, with \u03bb controlling the relative weight of recent and prior information in determining behavior and \u03b1 controlling the extent to which transmission is slowed by media exposure. As \u03bb increases, the effect of media is more prominent and has shorter duration. As \u03b1 increases, the spread of disease is slowed more quickly, though there can be multiple waves of infection when the values of \u03b1 and \u03bb are both relatively high.",

Although there were no significant differences in the per-contact transmission rate of the H1N1 virus or population structure, the spring outbreak of H1N1 in Mexico City was quickly contained, while the fall outbreak grew to epidemic proportions. Differences in social distancing help to explain the different dynamics of the two outbreaks. The spring outbreak received extensive attention in the Mexican press. By incorporating data on the volume of media coverage of the outbreak and by assuming that media influence leads to increased protective practices and therefore reduction in the percontact transmission probability, we were able to account for the social distancing that took place during the spring outbreak but which did not occur during the fall outbreak, achieving a good overall fit to the epidemic curves for the spring and fall outbreaks using the same model for both outbreaks. The Mexico City H1N1 example shows that there is not always a the direct Media-based infectious disease transmission model link between case counts and media attention. Therefore, it is important to quantify actual media attention in infectious disease models.",

Using data from the 2014-2015 influenza season in Washington, DC, we explored the role of media in a typical, seasonal outbreak and demonstrated that the low level media interest exhibited during the influenza season was associated with only a small reduction in the number of cases. Media may be a tool for public health officials to communicate preventive measures to the public during disease outbreaks. Therefore, the effect of significantly increasing the volume of media coverage was explored. It was found that a ten-fold increase in the volume of media coverage resulted in a 33.5% decrease in the median number of infections.

The proposed media function accurately captures both the large reduction in the spread of disease during the spring outbreak, due to social distancing, and the insignificant reduction during the fall outbreak. Media functions based on the number of cases and rate of spread reduce the spread of disease more substantially during the fall than during the spring, largely underestimating the fall outbreak.",
