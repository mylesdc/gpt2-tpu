            "text": "CLEC4M is a C-type lectin gene serving as cell adhesion receptor and pathogen recognition receptor. It recognizes several pathogens of important public health concern. In particular, a highly polymorphic variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) at the neck-region of CLEC4M had been associated with genetic predisposition to some infectious diseases. To gain insight into the origin and evolution of this VNTR in CLEC4M, we studied 21 Africans, 20 Middle Easterns, 35 Europeans, 38 Asians, 13 Oceania, and 18 Americans (a total of 290 chromosomes) from the (Human Genome Diversity Panel) HGDP-CEPH panel; these samples covered most of alleles of this VNTR locus present in human populations. We identified a limited number of haplotypes among the basic repeat subunits that is 69 base pairs in length. Only 8 haplotypes were found. Their sequence identities were determined in the 290 chromosomes. VNTR alleles of different repeat length (from 4 to 9 repeats) were analyzed for composition and orientation of these subunits. Our results showed that the subunit configuration of the same repeat number of VNTR locus from different populations were, in fact, virtually identical. It implies that most of the VNTR alleles existed before dispersion of modern humans outside Africa. Further analyses indicate that the present diversity profile of this locus in worldwide populations is generated from the effect of migration of different tribes and neutral evolution. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the origin of the VNTR alleles were arisen by independent (separate) mutation events and caused by differential allele advantage and natural selection as suggested by previous report based on SNP data.",

They are cell adhesion receptors and pathogen recognition receptors. However, CLEC4L (also called CD209) is expressed primarily on phagocytic cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, whereas CLEC4M (also called CD209L) expression is restricted to endothelial cells in liver and lymph nodes [1, 2] . Both lectins are known to bind multiple pathogens and function as cellular receptors for various viruses, such as HIV-1, Ebola virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus, Dengue virus, and SARS-coronavirus [3] [4] [5] . With regards to CLEC4M, it serves as a receptor for a variety of viruses, including HIV-1, hepatitis C, Ebola, and SARS-coronavirus, as well as the parasite Schistosoma mansoni and bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis [6, 7] . These two lectins are coded by genes that are located within a lectin family genes cluster on chromosome 19p13.2-3. This 26-kb segment is believed to arise as a result of a duplication of an ancestral gene [8] . These two genes in the cluster share a high degree of homology [2] . Both proteins are organized into three domains: (1) an N-terminal cytoplasmic region with a di-leucine motif for internalization followed by a transmembrane domain, (2) a C-terminal extracellular domain with a C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) involved in pathogen binding, and (3) a neckregion containing variable number of repeats of conserved subunit of 23-amino-acid sequence, that connects the CRD to the transmembrane region.",

Furthermore, by using the genotype data of VNTR in CLEC4M gene and dividing the subjects of the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP)-CEPH panel into 26 populations, we analyzed the correlation between the 25 non-African populations geographic distance to the east Africa and their population genetic distance to the east Africa.

In this study, we analyzed the sequence identity of each subunit among VNTR of 4 to 9 repeats alleles of 145 samples from different continental populations by clonal sequencing. Figure 1 shows the various haplotypes of each subunit and the prevalent subunit orientation in each VNTR alleles. Only eight different haplotypes account for all sequence variations of all subunits. H2 is the most parsimony one and thus used as the consensus sequence. According to the sequence identity in the 69-bp repeat unit, seven other haplotypes are identified (denoted as H1-H8) ( Figure 1 ). Different numbers of these subunits assemble to form the VNTR alleles of different length. The most prevalent subunit structures of each VNTR are described in Figure 2 . The detailed haplotype configurations in VNTR locus for all studied samples are found in Table S1 .",

On the direction from the N-terminal to C-terminal, the 7-repeat allele is formed by one H1, three H2, one H3, one H4 and one H5. Thus, it is denoted as H1-H2-H2-H2-H3-H4-H5 in the table of supplementary data (Table  S1) , and this construction is defined as the common consensus configuration. The consensus configurations of other VNTR alleles are also shown in table 1. For 7-repeat allele, the remainder has one of the three variant configurations which accounted for less than 4%. These variants are due to replacement of one of the H2 subunit by H3 subunit or vice versa. As H2 subunit and H3 subunit differs by three base pairs, it is not caused by a single sporadic event. They represent a signal of independent origin in a small proportion of 7-repeat allele. Therefore, these variants of 7repeat are classified as major rearrangement in Table 1 .",

Under the ''outof-Africa'' (OFA) model, all modern humans originated from East African [22] , it implies that the population from East Africa has the highest genetic diversity, and the genetic distance from non-African to East African declines monotonically with the geographical distance away from East Africa. By defining the northeastern Bantu of Kenya as the Human Original region population, we calculated the genetic distance between the other 25 non-African populations and the original population (East African population). Indeed, the VNTR genetic distances between the East Africa and the 25 different populations significantly correlated with their geographical distance to East Africa (R 2 = 0.51, P,0.0001 by linear regression) ( Figure 3 ). The data indicated that the present diversity distribution of the VNTR locus in CLEC4M gene could be explained by human migration in keeping with the OFA model of human settlement history. The patterns of population variation of VNTR in modern humans could be accounted by neutral evolution, that is, the evolution of VNTR in CLEC4M gene was influenced mostly by genetic drift.",

The CLEC4M gene plays an important role in innate immunity as pathogen receptor and had been studied as susceptibility gene to infectious and generated conflicting results [11] [12] [13] 15, 16, 18, 19] . As the VNTR is the focus at issue, the study about it is urgent. Understanding of the origin and evolution of the VNTR polymorphism will provide us better insight on whether the VNTR had been a target of natural selection, as an example of the evolution of other immunity related genes. In conclusion, we showed that various VNTR alleles in VNTR locus of CLEC4M gene were present before the time of human dispersion out of Africa. Further analysis showed that the present worldwide diversity profile of this VNTR locus could be resulted from demographic migrating of different tribes, and no evidence was found to support the notion of multiple independent mutation events at this VNTR due to natural selection. Future work based on much more comprehensive sequence information from more species, such as chimpanzee, gibbon, bonobo, could further our understanding of evolution of this gene and the effect of different pathogen pressures across the different species of the primates. ment of all the individuals met the criteria set by the HGDP Ethics Committee.

Then, the population from northeastern Bantu of Kenya was defined as the Human Original region population. Genetic distances between populations (Fst) (the other 25 non-African populations and the defined original region's population) were estimated using Arlequin package [25] . Correlation analysis between the graphical distance and genetic population distance was carried out using Pearson bivariate correction analysis (SPSS for Windows; 13.0). ",
