Previous studies have indicated that the nonstructural protein 11 (nsp11) of PRRSV may be an important protein for the immune escape of PRRSV. Results: Here, we firstly explored the effect of over-expression of nsp11 on PRRSV infection and found that over-expression of nsp11 enhanced the PRRSV titers while the small interfering RNA (siRNAs) specifically targeting nsp11 could reduce the PRRSV titers in MARC-145 cells. Conclusion: In conclusion, PRRSV nsp11 promotes PRRSV infection in MARC-145 cells and siRNAs targeting nsp11 may be a potential therapeutic strategy to control PRRSV in future.",

Since it was emerged in the United States in 1987 and in Europe in 1990, PRRSV has rapidly spread in the swine producing regions and became one of the most important devastating diseases of swine worldwide. It can cause severe reproductive failure in sows and respiratory distress in young growing pigs [2] . Infection with PRRSV also made pigs easy to secondary infection by other pathogens [3] . Up to date, since there is no efficient method or drugs against PRRSV, it is very important and urgent to develop the effective therapeutic strategies to control PRRS.",

Other and our previous work also demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 inhibited the host innate immune responses such as the transcription of type I interferon [7] , the RNAi innate immune response [9] and the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated production of IL-1\u03b2 [10] , which indicated that PRRSV nsp11 may play an important role in PRRSV infection.

And 24 h later, the cells in five random fields were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (50\u00d7) and only one of them was shown in Fig. 2 . The results in Fig. 2 showed that all of the three siRNAs targeting nsp11 could inhibit the expression of GFP-nsp11 and didn't influence on the expression of GFP. Finally, we selected two siRNAs (siRNA1 and siRNA2) targeting nsp11 to determine whether siR-NAs targeting nsp11 could reduce PRRSV titers in MARC-145 cell. The western blots results in Fig. 3a confirmed that siRNA1 and siRNA2 could efficiently reduce the nsp11 expression in 293T cells (Fig. 3a) . The results in Fig. 3b and c showed that siRNAs targeting nucleic acid sequence of nsp11 could significantly reduce viral titers of PRRSV (Fig. 3b) and reduce RNA levels of PRRSV (Fig. 3c) .",

Inhibition of specific genes by siRNA has proven to be a potential therapeutic strategy against viral infection [18] , especially for the positive single stranded RNA viruses since their genomes function as both the mRNA and the replication template [19, 20] . Up to date, RNAi has been used against several viruses such as hepatitis B virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, dengue virus and so on [20] [21] [22] . In this work, we also explore whether the siRNA, which targeted the nucleic acid sequence of nsp11, influenced the titers of PRRSV, The endoribonuclease activity of nsp11 was important for nsp11 to enhance the PRRSV titers. MARC-145 cells cultured in 24-well plate were transfected with pcDNA3.1-FLAG-nsp11 (nsp11) (800 ng/well), pcDNA3.1-FLAG-nsp11 H129A (nsp11 H129A) (800 ng/ well) or pcDNA 3.1-FLAG (Con). And 6 h later, the cells were infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 0.1 or mock infected, and 24 h later, the cells were lysed by freezing and thawing three times in three cycles, then the viral titers were measured by TCID50. Data represented means of three replicates, and experiments were repeated three times. Error bars represented the standard deviations. *: P <0.05 compared with the results in control. MOI, multiplicity of infection and the results showed that siRNA targeting nsp11 significantly reduced the titers of PRRSV (Fig. 3) . A recent improved live PRRSV vaccine has indicated that the ORF1a and ORF1b were the virulence determinants of PRRSV [23] . In addition, our recent work also show that RNAi innate immune response was an antiviral response to PRRSV and PRRSV inhibited this response by PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 and nsp11, which indicated that targeting nsp11 would be useful for RNAi innate immunity against PRRSV [9] . So it is reasonable to propose that our present results gave a new clue for generating the new PRRSV vaccine by targeting PRRSV nsp11.",
