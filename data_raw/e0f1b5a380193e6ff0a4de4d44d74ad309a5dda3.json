Here, we report the structure of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein in complex with its host cell receptor ACE2 revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The complex structure shows that only one receptor-binding domain of the trimeric S glycoprotein binds ACE2 and adopts a protruding \"up\" conformation. In addition, we studied the structures of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and its complexes with ACE2 in different in vitro conditions, which may mimic different conformational states of the S glycoprotein during virus entry. Disassociation of the S1-ACE2 complex from some of the prefusion spikes was observed and characterized. We also characterized the rosette-like structures of the clustered SARS-CoV S2 trimers in the postfusion state observed on electron micrographs. Structural comparisons suggested that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein retains a prefusion architecture after trypsin cleavage into the S1 and S2 subunits and acidic pH treatment. However, binding to the receptor opens up the receptor-binding domain of S1, which could promote the release of the S1-ACE2 complex and S1 monomers from the prefusion spike and trigger the pre-to postfusion conformational transition.",

            "text": "The spike (S) glycoprotein of the coronavirus is a class I viral fusion protein located on the outer envelope of the virion that plays a critical role in viral infection by recognizing host cell receptors and mediating fusion of the viral and cellular membranes [4] . The coronavirus S glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor protein consisting of~1,300 amino acids that is then cleaved into an amino (N)-terminal S1 subunit (~700 amino acids) and a carboxyl (C)-terminal S2 subunit (~600 amino acids). Three S1/S2 heterodimers assemble to form a trimer spike protruding from the viral envelope. The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit contains a hydrophobic fusion peptide and two heptad repeat regions. Triggered by receptor binding, proteolytic processing and/or acidic pH in the cellular compartments, the class I viral fusion protein undergoes a transition from a metastable prefusion state to a stable postfusion state during infection, in which the receptor-binding subunit is cleaved, and the fusion subunit undergoes large-scale conformational rearrangements to expose the hydrophobic fusion peptide, induce the formation of a six-helix bundle, and bring the viral and cellular membranes close for fusion [5] . Coronavirus S glycoprotein features two distinct protease cleavage sites. The S1/S2 cleavage site of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is located after residue 667 of the precursor protein, whereas the S2' cleavage site of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is on the S2 subunit and is 130 amino acids from the N terminus of the S2 subunit [6] [7] [8] . The S1/S2 cleavage site is located in a flexible loop of residues 660-675 that is completely exposed in the prefusion S1-S2 trimer spike. The S2' cleavage site of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is highly conserved among coronaviruses and is completely buried in the prefusion SARS-CoV S glycoprotein [6] [7] [8] . Cleavage of the S2' site by host cell proteases is required for successful infection by 9] . However, the mechanisms involved in exposure and cleavage of the S2' cleavage site are not well understood. Structural biology studies, especially recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies, have advanced our understanding of the role of the coronavirus S glycoprotein in virus entry. S glycoprotein structures in the prefusion state have been reported for members from the Alphacoronavirus genus (HCoV-NL63), Betacoronavirus genus (mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), HKU1, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), Gammacoronavirus genus (IBV), and Deltacoronavirus genus (PdCoV) [7, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .

The elution position of the peak indicated a protein or protein complex with a molecular weight of approximately 150 kDa. Subsequent biochemical and cryo-EM analyses of the peak showed a complex of one S1 subunit monomer and one ACE2 molecule (Fig 4B-4D, S10 Fig) , suggesting that binding of ACE2 to the S glycoprotein could trigger the dissociation of one S1 from the trimer together with ACE2. Analysis of the S trimer structure in the prefusion state showed that the \"C\"-shaped loop (residues 787-796) covering the S2' cleavage site was clipped by the linker downstream of the S1/S2 cleavage site of an adjacent protomer ( Fig 4E) . Disassociation of one S1-ACE2 complex from the spike would release the clipping linker and could induce conformational changes of the \"C\"-shaped loop, exposing the S2' site for protease cleavage and promoting the formation of a postfusion S2 trimer ( Fig 4E) . Of note, we observed a similar size-exclusion chromatography profile and rosette-shaped particles in the EM image of the complex consisting of ACE2 and the trypsin-cleaved S glycoprotein without low-pH treatment (S11 Fig) . This finding indicates that low-pH treatment of the cleaved S glycoprotein is not required for the disassociation of S1-ACE2 or for the formation of rosette-shaped particles of the postfusion S2 trimer. We also incubated the S glycoprotein with ACE2 first and then used low-pH buffer and trypsin to treat the sample. Size-exclusion chromatography analysis of the sample showed a similar elution profile with four peaks consisting of S2, S-ACE2, S1-ACE2 and excess ACE2, respectively (S12 Fig).",

Unlike the S glycoproteins of MERS-CoV and MHV, the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is not cleaved at the S1/S2 site during virus packaging in cells and, hence, remains uncleaved on mature virions [22, 23] . However, cleavage of the precursor S protein at the S1/S2 cleavage site by extracellular or endosome proteases is required for a functional SARS-CoV S glycoprotein [24] . Previous studies showed that blockage of the pH decrease in endosomes slightly reduced SARS-CoV infection, which indicated that low pH is not an essential factor for virus entry [25, 26] . Here, our results showed that the prefusion architecture, either in the unbound or ACE2-bound state, was retained in the cleaved S glycoprotein, and the conformational heterogeneity of CTD1s still existed. Similar results were also obtained for the cleaved with/without low-pH treatment S glycoproteins. Therefore, although cleavage at the S1/S2 site is required for a functional S glycoprotein, it does not significantly affect the overall architecture and conformation heterogeneity. However, we did observe significant differences between the mutant and wild-type cleaved S glycoproteins in binding ACE2, indicating that the S1/S2 cleavage site might affect CTD1 receptor binding, although the mechanism is still under investigation.",

The black arrow indicates the flexibility of the linker after the disassociation of the S1 subunit. of CTD1 from the \"down\" to \"up\" position is a prerequisite for receptor binding. Structural comparisons showed that binding of the receptor further opens CTD1. In addition, observations of the S1-ACE2 complex and the postfusion S2 assembly in the receptor-present sample suggested that receptor binding can open one CTD1 and trigger the release of all the S1 subunits from the spike. We did not observe S glycoprotein particles with two remaining S1 subunits in any sample, which suggests that disassociation of one S1-ACE2 from the S trimer could cause sequential disassociation of the S1 subunits from the spike trimer. A similar disassociation of the S1 subunits from the spike was also observed for MERS-CoV, even without binding the receptor [7, 16] . Although the virus uses a similar CTD1 \"up\" mechanism for receptor binding, the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein, which can have all three CTD1s of a trimer spike in the \"up\" conformation, is significantly different from the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, in which only one \"up\" CTD1 was observed. In addition, disassociated trimeric S1 particles were observed for MERS-CoV [16] , suggesting simultaneous disassociation of all three S1 subunits from the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein. Structural modeling showed that sufficient space exists for the other two CTD1s in the \"down\" position to point \"up\" and to bind with ACE2 for most of the S-ACE2 complexes (S13 Fig). However, we did not observe more than one ACE2 or more than one \"up\" CTD1 in one spike. We speculate that a conformational switch producing more than one \"up\" CTD1 may destabilize the cleaved S glycoprotein and trigger immediate disassociation of the S1 subunits and the S1-ACE2 complex. Additionally, disassociation of the SARS-CoV S1 subunit should be receptor binding-dependent, since no free S1 was observed when ACE2 was missing.",

The three helix fragments (H1, H2 and H3) of each S2 subunit are connected through two short linkers (helix linker 1: residues 921 to 927; helix linker 2: residues 949 to 969) (Fig 5) . The postfusion S2 subunits are a six-helix bundle with a 160 \u00c5-long central helix core. The pre-to postfusion transition of the S2 subunits requires a 180\u02daflip of prefusion helix fragments H1 (residues 902-920) and H2 (residues 928-948) that fuse with helix fragment H3 (residues 970-1015) to form the postfusion central helix core. Helix linker 2 is critical for the formation of the postfusion helix core, as has been shown in a previous study, which indicated that substitution of the residues in this region with prolines retains the S glycoprotein in the prefusion conformation and prevents conformational rearrangement [7] . The \"down\" CTD1s are located immediately above the S2 subunits and have direct contact with helix linker 2 (Fig 5, left) . The direct contact should stabilize the prefusion S2 subunit and prevent it from transitioning into the postfusion state. Opening of CTD1, especially by binding the receptor, would remove the steric restraints on helix linker 2, triggering the release of the S1 subunits and probably simultaneously allowing the extension of prefusion S2 helixes to form the postfusion S2 long helix bundle (Fig 5) .",

(C) Fourier shell correlation (FSC) curves of the 3D reconstructions. ACE2-bound conformation 1: pink, ACE2-bound conformation2: yellow, ACE2-bound conformation 3: red, unbound-up conformation: cyan, unbound-down conformation: grey. (TIF) S8 Fig. EM densities of the CTD2s. From left to right: unbound-down CTD2 (contouring level: 8 \u03c3), unbound-up CTD2 (contouring level: 8 \u03c3) and ACE2-bound conformation3 CTD2 (contouring level: 8 \u03c3). The C\u03b1 backbone of the CTD2 is shown in each density map. (TIF) S9 Fig. Homology model of the post-fusion SARS-CoV S2. (A) Model of the post-fusion MHV S2. The three protomers are colored pink, yellow and cyan, respectively. (B) Model of the SARS-CoV post-fusion S2 obtained through homology modeling using the model in \"A\". (C) Model of the SARS-CoV post-fusion S2 showing the possible locations of the S2' cleavage site and the fusion peptide (FP, colored red). (TIF) S10 Fig. Western blot analysis of the size-exclusion chromatography peak fractions of the low pH and trypsin treated S and ACE2 complex. Samples are related to Fig 4B. The C-terminus of the S2 subunit contains a strep tag. ACE2 has a C-terminal his tag. Anti-CTD1 serum is generated by immunizing the mouse with the CTD1 (residue: 327-516) of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. The bands are detected by using anti-strep mono-antibody (A), anti-his monoantibody (B) or anti-CTD1 serum (C). (TIF) S11 Fig. Gel filtration and negative staining analysis of the trypsin treated S and ACE2 complex at pH 7.2. Left: size-exclusion chromatography elution profile of the trypsin treated S and ACE2 mixture at pH 7.2. Four peaks were observed, similar to that of the low pH treated sample as in Fig 3A. Right: negative staining analysis of the peak S2. Red arrows indicate the rosette-shape structures formed by the post-fusion S2 trimers. Zoom-in images are shown below the raw micrograph. Scale bar: 50 nm. (TIF) S12 Fig. Gel filtration and SDS page analysis of the uncleaved S and ACE2 followed by low pH and trypsin treatment. Left:Size-exclusion chromatography elution profile.
