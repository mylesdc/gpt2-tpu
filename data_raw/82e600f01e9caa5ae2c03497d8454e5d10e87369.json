            "text": "Background: Large-scale outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) have re-emerged in China in recent years. However, little is known about the genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of field strains of PED virus (PEDV) in China in 2016-2017. To address this issue, in this study, 116 diarrhea samples were collected from pig farms in 6 Chinese provinces in 2016-2017 and were detected using PCR for main porcine enteric pathogens, including PEDV, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine kobuvirus (PKV). In addition, the complete S genes from 11 representative PEDV strains were sequenced and analyzed. Results: PCR detection showed that 52.6% (61/116) of these samples were positive for PEDV. Furthermore, sequencing results for the spike (S) genes from 11 of the epidemic PEDV strains showed 93-94% nucleotide identity and 92-93% amino acid identity with the classical CV777 strain. Compared with the CV777 vaccine strain, these strains had an insertion (A 133 ), a deletion (G 155 ), and a continuous 4-amino-acid insertion ( 56 NNTN 59 ) in the S1 region. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene indicated that the 11 assessed PEDV strains were genetically diverse and clustered into the G2 group. These results demonstrate that the epidemic strains of PEDV in China in 2016-2017 are mainly virulent strains that belong to the G2 group and genetically differ from the vaccine strain. Importantly, this is the first report that the samples collected in Hainan Province were positive for PEDV (59.2%, 25/42). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this article presents the first report of a virulent PEDV strain isolated from Hainan Island, China. The results of this study will contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology and genetic characteristics of PEDV in China.",

Although no previous reports indicated that PEDV existed in Hainan Province, in this study, PEDV was detected in samples collected from that location (with a positive rate of 59.2% (25/42)). This result indicates that PEDV has spread to Hainan Province, with positivity for PEDV detected in a high proportion of clinical samples from that province.

Therefore, the S gene is used to analyze the molecular epidemiology and genetic relatedness of PEDV. In this study, the 11 field strains were classified into the G2 group according to a phylogenetic tree. This result indicated that virulent strains were prevalent in China and were responsible for PEDV outbreaks in 2016-2017. In addition, to an extent, the examined strains differed from early PEDV isolates (LZC, CH/S and CV777). This difference explains why PED outbreaks continued to occur in cases involving the use of CV777-based vaccines. Based on the amino acid sequence of the S gene, Fig. 1 Phylogenetic analysis using the S genes of 74 PEDV reference strains and the 11 PEDV isolates in our study. The tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method, with bootstrap values calculated from 1000 replicates using MEGA 6 software. \"\u2022\" indicates the isolates in our study the mutant sites in these strains were primarily located in the S1 domain of the S protein. The CV777 vaccine strain has three major neutralizing epitopes: aa 498-637 (the COE gene), aa 747-754 (YSNIGVCK) and aa 763-770 (LQDGQVKI) [2, 14] . We found that strains in this study had sequence mutations at positions 498-637 and 747-754; however, the amino acid sequence at aa 747-754 was conserved between the field strain most recently isolated in our study and CV777. This result is consistent with the observation that CV777-based vaccines provided partial cross-protection against PEDV epidemic strains in China. In summary, current field strains of PEDV found in China in 2016-2017 are primarily virulent strains, and genetic variations in these strains may have led to antigenic changes and the failure of immunization.
