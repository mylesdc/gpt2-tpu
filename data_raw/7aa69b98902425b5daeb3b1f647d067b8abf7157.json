Prior to 2008, NLM had a long history of providing health information, training, and tools in response to disasters. Aware of this legacy, the NLM long range plan (Charting a Course for the 21st Century: NLM's Long Range Plan 2006-2016) called for creation of a center to show \"a strong commitment to disaster remediation and to provide a platform for demonstrating how libraries and librarians can be part of the solution to this national problem\". NLM is continuing efforts to ensure that medical libraries have plans for the continuity of their operations, librarians are trained to understand their roles in preparedness and response, online disaster health information resources are available for many audiences and in multiple formats, and research is conducted on tools to enhance the exchange of critical information during and following disasters. This paper describes the 2010-2013 goals and activities of DIMRC and its future plans.",

The vast majority of staff and volunteers playing information roles related to disasters are not librarians or informationists. They are responders who have a particular interest in or responsibility for organizing information and implementing the latest information technology. Responders need to be fully aware of the best disaster health information resources and tools. DIMRC structures its resources, outreach, and training materials to reach this crucial audience as well. It relies on interested librarians and NN/LM staff around the country to provide training on NLM disaster resources to these local responders. Subscriptions to the DISASTR-OUTREACH-LIB listserv have shifted dramatically from mostly librarians (65 percent at first) to mostly responders (now 65 percent). DISASTR-OUTREACH-LIB content (news, announcements, discussions) is widely reposted to channels reaching responders.",

DIMRC has sought to inform both librarians and the disaster workforce about the skills librarians can contribute to social media and disasters, including skills useful for data collection and synthesis, validation of information sources, and tracking of requests for assistance. On its monthly webinar calls, DIMRC has hosted speakers on the Digital Operations Center [2] at the American Red Cross national headquarters, VOST (Virtual Operations Support Team), and the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) fusion center's use of social media to raise awareness of new and interesting ways to explore social media data.

Disaster Information Specialists should become increasingly proactive in assisting disaster/ emergency personnel through education/training and knowledge management.

Areas to explore are marketing the Specialist concept to public health departments and policymakers, and suggesting that librarians support Emergency Operations Centers; assisting public health departments and emergency shelters with information for responders, shelter operators, and the public; collaborating with local health and hospital hotlines during a crisis; and working with poison control centers and local disaster voluntary organizations.",

These projects have been conducted by DIMRC, other NLM divisions, and other researchers. The Bethesda Hospitals' Emergency Prepared-ness Partnership (BHEPP) received funds specifically for research and development. These were used to launch several new projects to assist the participating hospitals in preparing for and responding to major incidents. NLM developed prototype redundant communications systems and tools to aid hospitals in patient management, family reunification, and disaster response training. Products and prototypes have been tested at annual mass casualty drills held by the three Bethesda hospitals and in other settings [36] . The BHEPP projects and earlier NLM grants are highlighted in the 2008-2010 paper [22] . Despite the discontinuation of funds for BHEPP, several prototypes continue to be further enhanced and tested with BHEPP and new partners. The challenge for DIMRC will be transitioning prototypes into operational tools.",

Outreach to these disparate groups will require constant attention by DIMRC staff and others involved in health information outreach such as staff and members of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine. DIMRC also will need to expand and explore its use of new technologies for communication, promotion, and community engagement, such as social media.

The DISASTR-OUTREACH-LIB listserv carried 37 messages about Hurricane Sandy posted by DIMRC and others, starting the day before landfall. \u2022 DIMRC created two new topic pages, one immediately after the event (November 5), http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/hurricanesandy.html, and one for the recovery phase, http://disasterinfo.nlm.nih.gov/dimrc/ hurricanesandyrecovery.html \u2022 Related topic pages were updated: Floods, Hurricanes, Disaster Recovery and Environmental Health, and Coping with Disasters. \u2022 DIMRC staff followed news about Hurricane Sandy to identify and share information about emerging health issues and status of healthcare facilities. NLM resources were widely promoted, including through NLM in Focus and NLM News & Events, 139 tweets on the DIMRC Twitter account, the Middle Atlantic Regional Medical Library blog, the NN/LM Bringing Health Information to the Community blog, and the NN/LM Emergency Pre-paredness Toolkit. \u2022 DIMRC consulted with the affected NN/LM Regional Medical Libraries (Middle Atlantic, Southeastern Atlantic and New England) about how to respond, and contacted affected libraries/librarians. The Middle Atlantic Regional Medical Library produced a webinar, Sharing Experiences and Lessons Learned from Hurricane Sandy, on March 28, 2013 [46]. The monthly DIMRC webinar calls following the hurricane included discussion by librarians in affected regions. The speakers from ASPR on the December 2012 call used Hurricane Sandy as a case study for social media response. Thirty news stories about response to Hurricane Sandy were collected for the Librarians and Libraries Respond to Disasters bibliography [28]. Ports in a Storm, a conference in Eatontown, NJ on April 8, 2013, was coordinated by the NN/LM Middle Atlantic Region (which also provided $9,000), the NN/LM Emergency Preparedness and Response Initiative, LibraryLinkNJ, the New Jersey Library Cooperative, and the New Jersey Library Association. DIMRC and NN/LM staff spoke at this conference for New Jersey librarians. Ports in a Storm: Your Library as a Disaster Recovery Center. A New, Community-focused Approach to Library Disaster Planning, a preconference held June 28, 2013 in conjunction with the American Library Association annual meeting, was organized by the NN/LM Emergency Prepared-ness and Response Initiative (coordinator Dan Wilson) and the New Jersey Library Association. This national event was modeled on the success of the April 2013 New Jersey conference. \u2022 NLM Director's Podcast featured Hospital Readiness for Hurricane Sandy on January 7, 2013",
