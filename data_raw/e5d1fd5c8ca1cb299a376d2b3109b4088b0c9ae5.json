            "text": "Autophagy is a well-described degradation mechanism that promotes cell survival upon nutrient starvation and other forms of cellular stresses. In addition, there is growing evidence showing that autophagy can exert a lethal function via autophagic cell death (ACD). As ACD has been implicated in apoptosis-resistant glioblastoma (GBM), there is a high medical need for identifying novel ACD-inducing drugs. Therefore, we screened a library containing 70 autophagyinducing compounds to induce ATG5-dependent cell death in human MZ-54 GBM cells. Here, we identified three compounds, i.e. loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 that significantly induce cell death in several GBM cell lines compared to CRISPR/Cas9-generated ATG5-or ATG7-deficient cells, pointing to a death-promoting role of autophagy. Further cell death analyses conducted using pharmacological inhibitors revealed that apoptosis, ferroptosis, and necroptosis only play minor roles in loperamide-, pimozide-or STF-62247-induced cell death. Intriguingly, these three compounds induce massive lipidation of the autophagy marker protein LC3B as well as the formation of LC3B puncta, which are characteristic of autophagy. Furthermore, loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 enhance the autophagic flux in parental MZ-54 cells, but not in ATG5 or ATG7 knockout (KO) MZ-54 cells. In addition, loperamide-and pimozidetreated cells display a massive formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes at the ultrastructural level. Finally, stimulation of autophagy by all three compounds is accompanied by dephosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a well-known negative regulator of autophagy. In summary, our results indicate that loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 induce ATG5-and ATG7-dependent cell death in GBM cells, which is preceded by a massive induction of autophagy. These findings emphasize the lethal function and potential clinical relevance of hyperactivated autophagy in GBM.",

ATG proteins are required for virtually every step of autophagy and autophagosome biogenesis, starting with nucleation of the initial autophagosome precursor, the phagophore 9 . Subsequent membrane expansion, closure of the autophagosome as well as intralysosomal degradation depend on the concerted action of two ubiquitinlike conjugation systems, which include ATG5 and ATG7 10, 11 . Well-described marker proteins for monitoring autophagy progression are members of the LC3/ GABARAP protein family 12 .

Using next-generation sequencing we identified the heterozygous gain-of-function mutation ENSP00000391127:p.Arg248Trp within the TP53 gene of MZ-54 cells, which has been reported to render cells less sensitive towards apoptosis-inducing drugs 27, 28 . We previously described the generation of CRISPR/Cas9 ATG5 KO cells derived from the MZ-54 cell line 29 (Fig. 1a) . Of note, the ATG5-ATG12 conjugate was found to be absent not only in ATG5 KO, but also in ATG7 KO cells (depicted by asterisk), which is in line with the notion that ATG7 is required for the conjugation of ATG12 to ATG5 during autophagosome maturation 30 . Importantly, among the tested compounds we identified loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 to induce ATG5-and ATG7dependent cell death in MZ-54 cells at various concentrations, as loperamide-, pimozide-or STF-62247triggered cell death was significantly reduced in ATG5 or ATG7 KO compared to control cells ( Fig. 1b-d) . As a positive control, we used the antidepressant drug imipramine hydrochloride (IM) in combination with the anticoagulant drug ticlopidine (TIC), since this combination has previously been reported to induce ACD in GBM cells 24 . As expected, treatment with IM and TIC triggered cell death in a concentration-dependent manner in parental MZ-54 cells, which was significantly decreased in ATG5 or ATG7 KO MZ-54 cells (Fig. 1e) . As a negative control, treating MZ-54 cells with the apoptosis-inducing compound ABT-737 and etoposide induced cell death in WT MZ-54 cells to a similar extent as in ATG5 or ATG7 KO cells (Suppl.

Addition of the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk failed to protect MZ-54 cells from loperamide-, pimozide-or STF-62247-induced cell death and only partially rescued cells from IM/TICinduced cell death, whereas it completely blocked ABT-737/etoposide-induced apoptosis used as a positive control for caspase-dependent cell death (Fig. 3a) . Consistently, no caspase-3 activation was detected upon treatment with loperamide, pimozide, STF-62247 or IM/ TIC in contrast to staurosporine (STS) as a positive control (Fig. 3b) , indicating that loperamide, pimozide, STF-62247 and IM/TIC induced cell death largely in a caspase-independent manner. In addition, the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) failed to block cell death by loperamide, pimozide, STF-62247, or IM/TIC, whereas it efficiently blocked cell death induced by the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 (Fig. 3c) that was used as a positive control for ferroptosis 32 . Similarly, addition of the receptorinteracting protein kinase (RIPK)1 inhibitor necrostatin-1s (Nec-1s) failed to block cell death induced by loperamide, pimozide, STF-62247 or IM/TIC, whereas Nec-1s profoundly protected HT-29 colon carcinoma cells from cell death induced by a combination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1, the Smac mimetic BV6 and zVAD.fmk (Fig. 3d ), a well-described model of necroptosis 33 . Taken together, these findings indicate that apoptosis, ferroptosis and necroptosis are not the main execution pathways during loperamide-, pimozide-and STF-62247-induced cell death.",

It inhibits this pathway by phosphorylating few ATG proteins 35 . mTORC1 itself can be activated through phosphorylation at Ser2446 by protein kinase B (PKB), which leads to inhibition of autophagy 36, 37 . Since this phosphorylation site acts as a switch controlling the activity and function of mTORC1, we investigated whether loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 induce dephosphorylation of mTORC1 at Ser2446, as this would allow for activation of autophagy 37 . Indeed, loperamide, pimozide, STF-62247, and IM/TIC markedly reduced phosphorylation of mTORC1, similar to the welldescribed autophagy inducer rapamycin 38 (Fig. 4 ). In addition, we assessed the phosphorylation status of ribosomal protein S6 kinase I (S6K), one of the downstream targets of mTORC1 39 . In line with the observed dephosphorylation of mTORC1, all compounds caused dephosphorylation of S6K (Fig. 4) . Since rapamycin has been reported to induce autophagy by preventing phosphorylation of mTORC1 at Ser2446 34 , we tested whether this drug could also induce autophagy-dependent cell death. Rapamycin, however, did not induce cell death in MZ-54 cells (Suppl. Fig. S4 A-C) at a concentration that inhibited phosphorylation of mTORC1 and S6K (Fig. 4) . Together, this set of experiments indicates that loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 negatively regulate mTORC1, which in turn may lead to increased autophagy.",

In most cases, these DGC contained electron-dense material that likely reflects the presence of cytoplasmic material being degraded. In addition, we also observed a significant increase in autophagosomes per cell section upon treatment with IM/ TIC, loperamide and pimozide (Fig. 6b, c, e) . Notably, the increase of DGC was shown to be more pronounced than the increase in autophagosomes, pointing to a rapid fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes that is indicative of an enhanced autophagic flux.

This system is based on the expression of the GFP-LC3B-RFP-LC3B\u0394G fusion protein, composed of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to WT LC3B and red fluorescent protein (RFP) fused to the LC3B Gly120 mutant (Fig. 7b) . Upon ectopic expression, this fusion protein is intracellularly cleaved by the ATG4 proteases into equimolar ratios (Fig. 7b) . GFP-LC3B localizes to autophagosomes and eventually becomes partly degraded in autolysosomes upon induction of autophagy. However, the mutated RFP-LC3B\u0394G cannot be conjugated to autophagosomes and remains cytosolic without being turned over by autophagy, thus serving as internal control (Fig. 7b) . We therefore assessed GFP and RFP protein levels by Western blotting upon the induction of autophagy by loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247. Importantly, all three compounds led to a decrease of GFP protein levels, whereas RFP levels remained stable (Fig. 7c) .

First, biochemical and cellular characteristics of autophagy as well as cell death induced by loperamide, pimozide or STF-6224 were significantly reduced by depletion of ATG5 or ATG7 expression. Second, we demonstrated that loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 induced an increase in the autophagic flux of MZ-54 cells that was potentiated by inhibition of lysosomal maturation and reduced by loss of ATG5 or ATG7 expression. Third, loperamide-and pimozide-treated MZ-54 cells were characterized by distinct and prominent ultrastructural hallmarks of autophagy, which are generally considered as a gold standard for the analysis of autophagy 23 . Fourth, we demonstrated that cell death induced by loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 was not primarily mediated via apoptosis, necroptosis or ferroptosis, as typical pharmacological inhibitors of these cell death modalities largely failed to prevent cell death. Therefore, cell death induced by loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 is dependent on autophagy and can be classified as ACD 17, 23, 52 .",

For instance, an increase in intracellular Ca 2+ has been shown to inhibit mTORC1 signaling through Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CAMKK2/ CaMKK\u03b2) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to accumulation of autophagosomes 63 . On the other hand, an inhibitory role of enhanced intracellular Ca 2+ levels on autophagy has been reported as well. Increases in Ca 2+ activate calpains and adenylate cyclase, leading to increased levels of 3\u2032-5\u2032-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) 64 . cAMP stimulates inositol triphosphate (IP3) production that activates inositol 1,4,5triphosphate receptors (ITPRs) on the ER membranes to secrete Ca 2+ , resulting in autophagy inhibition by maintaining enhanced mTORC1 activity 65 . Moreover, Ca 2+ release from the ER and the subsequent decrease in intra-ER Ca 2+ levels were shown to promote misfolding of the lysosomal proton pump vATPase, leading to impaired lysosomal acidification and autophagy 66, 67 . According to this scenario, inhibition of Ca 2+ channels through loperamide and pimozide may enhance autophagy indirectly through a release from autophagy inhibition. Interestingly, apart from enhancing autophagy through lowering IP3 levels, inhibition of voltage-gated channels has also been shown to induce autophagy through inhibition of calpain-mediated cleavage of ATG5 68 .",

Indeed, our present study shows that loperamide, pimozide, and STF-62247 induced a strong accumulation of LC3Bpositive autophagosomes and autolysosomes prior to cell death over a period of 48 h, hence supporting the hypothesis of a threshold effect which possibly turns autophagy into a detrimental process.
