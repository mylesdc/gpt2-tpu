Critical pertussis (CP) is defined as pertussis disease that results in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission or death. It is characterized by severe respiratory failure, important leukocytosis, pulmonary hypertension, septic shock and encephalopathy. Despite intensive care management, it causes substantial morbidity and mortality for children especially among young infants. Resurgence of pertussis in the last 20 years is evident from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). 1 Several reasons for this resurgence have been proposed, including genetic changes in Bordetella pertussis, lessened potency of pertussis vaccines, waning of vaccineinduced immunity, greater awareness of pertussis, and the general availability of better laboratory tests. 2 A new resurgence was seen in 2013 in Tunisia even in the presence on a high (98%) coverage of childhood vaccination . 3 The purpose of this study was to describe the institutional experience in the management of infants with CP admitted in year 2013 at Children's hospital Bechir Hamza of Tunis, reporting the relationship between method of presentation, therapies and outcome in order to identify factors associated with death.",

The hospital has 360 beds, and the PICU has 16 beds (500 admissions /year).

Tracheal samplings were also accepted. Time from specimen collection to receipt in the laboratory was 20 min to 2 days, with no transport additives. The RT-PCR targets include the IS481, commonly found in B. pertussis, B. bronchiseptica, and B. holmesii; the IS1001, specific of B. parapertussis, in combination with the pertussis toxin promoter region gene (ptx) of B. pertussis; and the recA gene-specific of B. holmesii. NPS and/or tracheal sampling for viral detection through RT-PCR were also performed in all infants. We reviewed the medical charts of 17 children [median age 56 days (range 24-630); sex-ratio: 0.88] admitted to our PICU between 01 January to 31 October 2013 for confirmed CP by RT-PCR. Only mechanically ventilated patients were included. Clinical data included: patient demographics, neonatal history, immunization status, presentation. Routine laboratory data and chest radiographs were also performed at admission in order to reveal infiltrate or consolidation imagings. Severity of Pediatric Risk of Mortality Score (PRISM) was evaluated at the time of PICU admission. During the hospitalization, the presence of complications and coinfections with viral or bacterial pathogens were checked, and all therapeutic interventions, including duration of respiratory or circulatory support with or without sedation, muscle paralysis, inhalation of nitric oxide were recorded.",

The majority of cases were admitted in July. Occurrence in summer showed that pertussis did not mimick bronchiolitis period. Concomitant viral infection was observed in 8 cases. Rhinovirus was the most isolated viruses. Co-respiratory viral infections are common with pertussis. The most frequently identified agents are rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus (). 6, 7 To our knowledge, it is the first report of rhinovirus infection in the summer. Partial immunization appeared to be a risk factor of mortality but infants less 2 months old have no maternal antibodies neither active immunization. The age of infants seemed to be a confounding factor. So that, we have completed the statistical analysis by adjusting for age, and we have found that the mortality is not significantly different between immunized babies and unimmunized ones (p = 0.142).",

Our study had some limitations: the small size of our cohort and retrospective review. In conclusion, studies on clinical courses of children with critical pertussis like those admitted to the PICU are scarce in the literature; most of the published studies were done in a single centre, furthermore were retrospective cohort studies having a small sample size. 13 Despite advances in life support and the treatment of organ failure in childhood in critical care units, pertussis remains difficult to treat. Exchange transfusion and leukapheresis have been reported effective in small cohorts for correcting the pulmonary hypertension that characterizes critical pertussis, and facilitating the oxygenation. 14, 15 We performed exchange transfusion in 5 patients with leucostasis more than 100.000 WB count. Three of them died even if exchange transfusion was effective in rapidly dropping the numbers of circulating WBCs. The death occurred at 30 days of PICU stay from encephalopathy. The was also a death for septic shock, related to untreated bacterial coinfection in forth day on admission. It is possible that ECMO could have improved prognosis of children with refractory septic shock, 16 but this treatment was not available in our country.",
