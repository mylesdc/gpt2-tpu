            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a contagious and infectious disease that is characterized by severe vomiting and diarrhea of swine , especially piglet, and caused by transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) . TGEV infection provokes mitochondrial damage of porcine intestinal epthelial cell (IPEC), which is responsible for inflammation and cell death. In our previous study, we have demonstrated that circular RNA circEZH2 was down-regulated during TGEV infection and promoted the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) via targeting miR-22 in porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). Activation of NF-\u03baB is an important factor for mitochondrial damage. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening is a key reason for mitochondrial damage. So, we speculate that circEZH2 may regulate TGEV-induced mPTP opening via NF-kB pathway. In the present study, we found that mPTP opening of IPEC-J2 was occured during TGEV infection and suppressed by circEZH2 via attaching miR-22. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were identified as the targets of miR-22. Silencing HK2 enhanced TGEV-induced mPTP opening, while no effect on NF-\u03baB pathway. Silencing IL-6 promoted TGEV-induced mPTP opening and inhibited NF-\u03baB pathway. Inhibitor of NF-\u03baB increased TGEV-induced mPTP opening. The data revealed that TGEV-induced mPTP opening was regulated via two pathways: circEZH2/miR-22/HK2 axis and circEZH2/miR-22/IL-6/NF-\u03baB axis.",

In human, CoVs evoke respiratory tract infection and cause common cold or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1] [2] [3] . In animals, CoVs also lead to life-threatening diseases, such as severe enteric and respiratory tract infections, and are economically important pathogens [4] [5] [6] [7] . TGEV is a member of Coronaviridae and causes TGE. TGE is a highly contagious gastroenteric disease of swine and results in high mortality of less than 2-week-old piglet. TGEV infection can evoke mitochondrial damage, inflammation, and cell death [8, 9] . TGEV-induced mitochondrial damage is a key factor of inflammation and is caused by abnormal opening of mitochondrial permeability transmission pore (mPTP) [10] . Persistent opening of mPTP can lead to decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u25b3\u03c8m), reduction Ivyspring International Publisher of ATP production, release of ROS from mitochondria, finally mitochondrial damage [11] [12] [13] [14] . Viral infection is one of the important factors for mitochondrial injury [15] [16] [17] [18] . Studies have confirmed that TGEV infection can cause intracellular mitochondrial injury. For example, TGEV infection of IPEC-J2 can cause intracellular mitochondrial autophagy [19] . PK-15 cells infected with TGEV can appear mitochondrial injury, showing an increase of mitochondrial Ca 2+ and mitochondrial membrane permeability [20, 21] .",

Activation of NF-\u03baB by TNF-\u03b1 decreases calcium induced mPTP opening via repressing ANT1 [26] . Recently, we reported that mitochondrial damage was caused by TGEV infection. Moreover, circEZH2 enhanced activation of NF-\u03baB pathway via sponging miR-22 during TGEV-induced inflammation process [21] . circEZH2 is comprised of exon 2 to 8 of EZH2 (ENSSSCG00000028840) and is derived from 109, 411, 982 bp -109, 431, 724 bp region of the sense strand of Chromosome 9.

To confirm the circular characteristics of circEZH2, we next digested total RNA with or without RNase R. Compared to the linear \u03b2-actin mRNAs, circEZH2 was obviously resistant to Rnase R ( Figure 2B ). In addition, we found circEZH2 was localized at both nuclear and cytoplasm ( Figure 2C and D). Meanwhile, The levels of circEZH2 were measured by qRT-PCR and FISH. The results revealed that circEZH2 was down-regulated during TGEV infection in vitro ( Figure 2E and Figure S1 ) and in vivo ( Figure 2F and Figure S1 ), which is correlated with the Solexa high-throughput sequencing. To investigate the impact of circEZH2 on mPTP opening induced by TGEV, IPEC-J2 cells were transfected with pcircRNA-circEZH2 (or pcircRNA, si-circEZH2, NC siRNA) and subsequently infected with TGEV at 1 MOI for 24 h. The circEZH2 level was significantly increased by pcircRNA-circEZH2 and remarkably decreased by si-circEZH2 ( Figure 2G and H) . The level of mPTP opening was tested using BBcellProbeTM M61 probe. These results suggested fluorescence intensity of cells infected with TGEV significantly increased by pcircRNA-circEZH2 and significantly decreased by si-circEZH2 in comparison with negative control (Figure 2I to K).",

To provide further evidence on circEZH2 functions as miR-22 sponge, FISH assay was conducted. Co-localization of circEZH2 and miR-22 was observed in the cytoplasm of IPEC-J2 cells, indicating circEZH2 interacts with miR-22 ( Figure  4A ). To examine whether circEZH2 suppressed mPTP opening via interacting with miR-22, miR-22 mimics and pcircRNA-circEZH2 were co-transfected into IPEC-J2 cells. The fluorescence intensity was significantly inhibited by miR-22 mimics and pcircRNA-circEZH2 co-transfection compared with pcircRNA-circEZH2 alone ( Figure 4B and C) . Previous studies have suggested that circEZH2 promoted protein level of p-I\u03baB-\u03b1 and accumulation of p65 in nucleus in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells [21] . Further analysis showed that TGEV induced accumulation of p-p-65, and miR-22 inhibited this process ( Figure 4D and E) . The protein level of p-p65 significantly decreased in IPEC-J2 cells co-transfected with miR-22 mimics and pcircRNA-circEZH2 compared with in cells transfected with pcircRNA-circEZH2 alone ( Figure 4F ).

GO enrichment analysis of the 197 genes was performed and presented (Table S3 ). The result showed that 30 target genes were localized at mitochondria or participated in the immune system process ( Figure 5C and D) . To identify the targets, 16 target genes of miR-22 that related to mitochondrion and inflammation were selected for identification. The 3' UTR of the 16 target genes were cloned into 3' UTR of dual-luciferase reporter plasmid to gain the recombinant plasmid. The luciferase activities were detected. The results showed that luciferase activity of plasmid containing the 3' UTR of HK2 was markedly lower than that of other targets ( Figure 5E ). To further identify the direct binding between miR-22 and 3' UTR of HK2 mRNA, the binding site of miR-22 seed sequence at HK2 3' UTR were mutated with the 4-bp substitution ( Figure 5F ). The constructs and miR-22 mimics (or miRNA mimics control, miR-22 inhibitor, miRNA inhibitor control) were co-transfected into IPEC-J2 cells. The luciferase activities were measured. Compared with the control, introduction of exogenous miR-22 decreased the psi-HK2-WT reporter activity by 45%, while over-expression and inhibition of miR-22 did not affect luciferase activity ( Figure 5G and H) . The effects of miR-22 on transcription and expression of HK2 were tested using real-time PCR and western blot. The results indicated that the transcriptional level of HK2 was not influenced by miR-22 mimics and inhibitor ( Figure  5I ). However, the protein level of HK2 was down-regulated by miR-22 mimics and up-regulated by miR-22 inhibitor ( Figure 5J ). Together, our data conclusively demonstrated that HK2 is a direct target of miR-22 in IPEC-J2 cells.",

Previous studies have confirmed that IL-6 was involved in regulating the NF-\u03baB pathway [34] . To determine the direct interaction between miR-22 and 3' UTR of IL-6 mRNA, the porcine IL-6 3' UTR or its mutant was respectively cloned into the 3' UTR of a Renilla luciferase gene in a luciferase reporter psiCHECK-2 ( Figure 7A ). The constructs and miR-22 mimics (or miRNA mimics control, miR-22 inhibitor, miRNA inhibitor control) were co-transfected into IPEC-J2 cells. Compared with the control, introduction of exogenous miR-22 decreased the psi-IL-6-WT reporter activity by 62%, while overexpression and knockdown of miR-22 using miR-22 mimics and inhibitor did not affect psi-IL-6-Mut reporter activity ( Figure 7B Figure 7D ).To investigate the effect of IL-6 on NF-\u03baB pathway, IPEC-J2 were transfected with si-IL-6 or NC siRNA, and subsequently infected with TGEV at 1 MOI for 24 h.

To examine whether miR-22 suppressed NF-\u03baB pathway via interacting with IL-6, miR-22 inhibitor and the si-IL-6 were co-transfected into IPEC-J2. The results revealed that p-p65 significantly down-regulated in IPEC-J2 by miR-22 inhibitor and si-IL-6 co-transfection in comparison with miR-22 inhibitor alone ( Figure 7G ). To investigate the effect of IL-6 on mPTP opening, IPEC-J2 cells were transfected with si-IL-6 or NC siRNA, and subsequently infected with TGEV at 1 MOI for 24 h.

Persistent opening of mPTP in response to high concentration of Ca 2+ can lead to decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u25b3\u03c8m) and makes mitochondria become permeable to molecules less than 1.5 kDa and water [11, 12, 41, 42] . Therefore, the opening of mPTP is the key link of mitochondrial damage. Mitochondrial damage can trigger inflammation response [43, 44] . We previously reported that circEZH2 activated NF-\u03baB pathway, indicating circEZH2 regulating TGEV-caused inflammation response via NF-\u03baB pathway [21] . It was recently reported that TGEV non-structural protein 2 (nsp2) promotes inflammation via NF-\u03baB pathway [45] . Therefore, TGEV nsp2 may contribute to inflammation via regulating circEZH2.

Here, we found that circEZH2 regulated mPTP opening via binding miR-22, while not affecting its parental gene, EZH2. Therefore, it will be of interest to investigate whether circEZH2 play regulatory roles through interacting with proteins or modulating gene transcription or translation. Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) is an important regulator of mPTP opening. HK2 interacts with VDAC1 to change the conformation of VDAC1, which leads to an inhibition of mPTP opening [48] [49] [50] . This correlates with our discovery that silencing HK2, the target of miR-22, aggravates TGEV-induced mPTP opening. However, HK2 does not regulate NK-\u03baB activation. Not only HK2, IL-6 was also identified as the target of miR-22 and suppressed TGEV-induced mPTP opening via activating NF-\u03baB pathway, suggesting that miR-22 regulates TGEV-induced mPTP opening via at least two pathways. Our finding is supported by the discovery that IL-6 reduces hyperoxia-induced mitochondrial damage via Bcl-2-induced Bak-mitofusions interaction and activates NF-\u03baB pathway through STAT3 pathway [34, 51] and provides a new mechanism of miR-22 in mitochondrial function.",
