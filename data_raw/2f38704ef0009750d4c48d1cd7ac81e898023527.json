In general, the clinical features of our patients were not different from previously reported cases. Susceptibility to a wide range of infections caused by opportunistic and nonopportunistic organisms were commonality. The generalized maculopapular rash, hepatosplenomegaly, chorioretinitis, and CNS complications in our patients are probably related to the chronic CMV and disseminated BCG infections. All reported patients succumbed to their disease during infancy unless they had successful HSCT ( Table 2) . On average, the degree of lymphopenia was more profound in our patients (420-2,680/mm 3 ) compared to others (1,520-11,850/mm 3 ) (7). Interestingly, all our patients had delayed umbilical cord separation [normal separation occurs in 1-2 weeks (8)] Patient V:6, who died in infancy from a febrile illness before diagnosis and the identification of the genetic defect in the family, was also reported to have had delayed separation of the umbilical cord. None of the reported patients with IKK2 deficiency had delayed cord separation except one from Saudi Arabia, but with a different mutation (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . No neutrophil chemotaxis or adhesion assay was done for the patients. Delayed cord separation was reported in conditions that affect neutrophil number and/or compromise their function including leukocyte adhesion defects as well as MyD88 and IRAK4 deficiency, which are upstream to the NF-\u03baB activation pathway (9) (10) (11) (12) . This feature may be a clue to IKK2 deficiency in patients with combined immunodeficiency. The mechanism by which IKBKB mutation may predispose to delayed cord separation is not clear. It has been reported that neutrophil infiltration was prominent during the cord separation process in healthy babies, and a defect in neutrophil chemotaxis and adhesion was illustrated in cases of leukocyte adhesion deficiency (13) . Since all IKK2 deficiency patients in the literature did not exhibit delayed cord separation except one Saudi patient with a different mutation, it is likely that this feature is a result of a complex interaction between the IKBKB defect and other modifier genes. On the other hand, a gain-of-function (GOF) mutation in IKBKB leads to a relatively mild form of combined immunodeficiency, ectodermal dysplasia, and immune dysregulation, where affected patients may live to their fourth decade. Although both diseases result in hypogammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia, patients with IKBKB GOF mutation have lower number of na\u00efve T lymphocytes with overactivated memory cells (14) .",

The fact that he had a sustained lymphoid engraftment without conditioning is likely due to the severe T-cell dysfunction in this type of immunodeficiency. We do not have a clear explanation why our index case did not clear the disseminated BCGitis inspite of the recovered in vitro lymphoproliferative response to PHA. One possibility is that the donor cells are anergic to BCG, but we could not test for that. So far, 13 out of 27 patients with IKK2 deficiency including our cohort had undergone HSCT. Only five were alive at the time of reporting, while those who did not receive HSCT succumbed to their disease in their infancy or early childhood. All survivors received myeloablative conditioning except our patient, while the remaining eight patients received non-myeloablative conditioning (n = 5), reduced intensity conditioning (n = 1), or no conditioning (n = 2) (14) . Although it is difficult to draw a conclusion from such limited number of reported patients, it seems that no conditioning or reduced intensity conditioning are not sufficient to cure the disease, and myeloablative protocol is needed to establish a good immune reconstitution.",

He continued to suffer from disseminated BCGitis with bony involvement requiring frequent surgical interventions for faciozygomatic osteomyelitis. More than 4 years after the transplant, he was still on anti-mycobacterial medications (cycloserine, clarithromycin, ethambutol, and levofloxacin), monthly IVIG, and pentamidine prophylaxis. The last chimerism test was done at 4.5 years posttransplantation and showed 23% lymphoid engraftment and no myeloid engraftment. The severe disseminated BCGitis and history of GVHD precluded another trial of transplantation.",
