(4) As evidenced for other arthropod-borne viruses, a combination of factors ranging from environmental factors to viral genetic changes may have contributed to the selection and spread of new epidemic variants of ZIKV through a na\u00efve population in tropical and subtropical areas. Currently, the occurrence of human ZIKV infections has dramatically decreased in Latin America. This decrease may be partially due to the population's previous experience with natural ZIKV infection and the subsequent development of immunity. (5) Additionally, other seasonal changes can influence the biology of vectors and can affect host-pathogen interactions; this generates a variation in the timing and severity of epidemic dynamics, as has been demonstrated by studies on other infectious agents. (6) Although a decrease in ZIKV transmission has been observed in the last two years, human cases are sporadically detected, which highlights the possibility of a new epidemic event. Clarifying the dynamic of ZIKV infections between animals, human hosts and vectors should aid in preventing new epidemic outbreaks and in developing strategies for controlling ZIKV infections.",

            "text": "The ZIKV genome consists of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of approximately 11 kb in length. The viral RNA architecture is composed of two noncoding regions at the 5' and 3' extremities flanking a single open reading frame (ORF). The viral ORF encodes a polyprotein that, after cleavage by viral and host cell proteases, generates three structural proteins [capsid (C), premembrane (prM) and envelope (E)] that constitute the viral particle and encode seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) that are mainly involved in viral replication and immune system evasion. (7) Phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that after ZIKV emerged in Uganda, the virus spread independently and evolved into three lineages (west African, east African, and Asian) that appear to be related to distinct clinical complications in the human host. (8) In accordance, ZIKV genomic characterisation suggests that during the geographical spread, the Asian lineage has accumulated several mutations that might have influenced the fitness and increased the virulence and the occurrence of new clinical entities associated with the ZIKV infections during the 2015/2016 outbreak. (9) A better understanding of the contribution of viral genetic markers to human disease and the viral spread in nature might be of paramount importance to design prophylactic or therapeutic strategies to control ZIKV infections. Here, we describe the isolation and present a comparative genetic and biological characterisation of three Brazilian ZIKV clinical isolates selected from two different epidemic periods. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the isolates reported in this manuscript belong to the Asian lineage. We identified nonsynonymous mutations in the genomes of these Brazilian ZIKV isolates and the biological characterisations of the viruses showed that the mammalian cell lines were more permissive to ZIKV infections than the insect cell lines.",

After a 24 h infection period, it was possible to demonstrate the presence of envelope protein (4G2 + ) of ZIKV in mdDCs infected with the three clinical isolates of ZIKV (Fig. 4A-B) . Flow cytometry analysis showed that the frequency of mdDCs (CD11c + /CD14 -/CD209 + ) infected (4G2 + ) with ZV BR 2015/15261 (25.54% \u00b1 21.12) was similar to the frequency of infection with ZIKV PE243 (27.47% \u00b1 16.98) and ZIKV MR766 (24.84% \u00b1 20.49). Conversely, the ZIKV strains ZV BR 2015/15098 (8.31% \u00b1 6.29), that presented a better viral fitness on A459, Huh7.5 and Vero E6 cells, as well as the ZV BR 2016/16288 (10.40% \u00b1 6.03), were shown to be less efficient in infecting mdDCs compared to the infection efficiencies of the ZV BR 2015/15261, PE243 and MR766 strains (Fig. 4A-B) . Unlike the high infection rates observed after 48 h in mammalian cells or 72 h in insect cells, the mdDC infection rates with all ZIKV strains tested decreased over time (data not shown).

            "text": "Phylogenetic studies support the idea that throughout its evolution, the single-stranded positive-sense RNA ZIKV has accumulated genetic changes that may have ensured some selective advantage for virus adaptation and recent epidemic spread of ZIKV Asian lineage. Several studies have experimentally investigated the role of some of these amino acid substitutions, and a correlation between genetic changes and the increased pathogenicity of ZIKV in recent outbreaks was suggested. (16, 17) All three ZIKV clinical isolates characterised in this study present the N 139 V 982 V 2634 (numbering from the start codon of the ZIKV genome) signature characteristic of the American isolates. The substitutions S139N at prM and A982V at NS1 arose during the course of ZIKV spread from Asia to the Americas and were associated with severe microcephalic phenotype in neonatal mouse model and increased virus transmission in mosquitoes, respectively (reviewed by Liu et al. (18) The M/T2634V substitution at NS5 is believed to be more recent and to have a neutral effect on viral fitness, although it has not been thoroughly studied. (18) Apart from these genetic determinants of virulence, we identified a unique mutation in the envelope protein (K166R) in the isolate ZV BR 2015/15098 (Table III) . This substitution is located in domain I of the envelope protein and does not implicate a change in the biochemical characteristics of the amino acid. The only other se-quence in our datasets that presented a nonsynonymous substitution (K166E) in this position was an isolate from the Central African Republic (KF383115). It is noteworthy that four of the eight substitutions identified here were observed in the NS2A protein, indicating that this small transmembrane protein had the higher number of positions under selective pressure. ZIKV NS2A protein has been previously reported to play a role in the disruption of adherens junction formation, which has been associated with reduced prolif- eration, premature differentiation and the depletion of radial glial cells in the mouse cortex. (19) A single mutation at ZIKV NS2A (A175V), which has been shown to decrease virus production and RNA synthesis in vitro, was associated with an attenuated phenotype in a ZIKV mouse model. (20) Based on a study by Xie et al. (21) and on the transmembrane helices and protein topology pre-diction program HMMTOP (http://www.enzim.hu/hmmtop/), this mutation (A175V) maps to a transmembrane domain. The NS2A mutation M181V (between ZV BR 2015/15261 and ZV BR 2015/15098 or ZV BR 2016/16288 - Table III ) maps to this same domain. The nature of the mutation is also similar, resulting in just a small increase in the amino acid side chain. The amino acid polymor- Based on the homology and the in silico prediction, this mutation also maps to a transmembrane domain, and the only amino acids identified at this position are either alanine or valine. Additionally, when the UTRs of the three new ZIKV isolates were compared, one single nucleotide change downstream of the stop codon of the NS5 gene was detected in the ZIKV ZV BR 2015/15098 strain. This mutation was mapped to the highly variable proximal region 1 of the 3\u02b9UTR sequence (3\u02b9HVR), a region of the Flavivirus genome known for displaying large heterogeneity in both sequence and length. (23) The flavivirus 3'UTR contains essential elements that function as important mediators to promote viral genome replication and translation. Despite this, the nucleotide change at 3'HVR of the ZV BR 2015/15098 does not seem to have any impact on the secondary structure, as shown in the RNA fold analysis (Supplementary data) .",

            "text": "Nevertheless, previous studies have demonstrated that sequence variability at 3'HVR of DENV-1 and DENV-2 are associated with DENV fitness gain or loss in mammalian and insect cells. (23, 24) To evaluate the synergistic effect of the mutations identified in each Brazilian ZIKV isolate, we first compared the ability of recent ZIKV isolates and a representative of the African ZIKV lineage to infect mammalian and insect cells. We observed that the ZIKV prototypes (MR766 and PE243) exhibit more protein expression and viral particle production than the recent ZIKV isolates in all mammalian cells tested. However, among the recent isolates, the ZV BR 2015/15098 showed higher infective ability, especially in A549 and Huh7.5 cells. Nonetheless, in insect cells these differences were not so evident. Interestingly, ZV BR 2015/15098 has the NS2A (A117V) polymorphism. Another Brazilian isolate with this same polymorphism (KX520666/ BR/2015) has been reported to have higher cytopathogenicity and a higher viral progeny production in different mammalian cell lines (Vero, HEK293T and SH-SY5Y) compared to a virus representative of the early Asian lineage (KF993678). Viral RNA accumulation was also higher in the Vero and HEK293T cells, but no difference was observed in SH-SY5Y cells. (25) Additionally, we observed that ZV BR 2016/16288, the isolate circulating in southern Brazil one year after the detection of the first case of ZIKV in Brazil, is less infective when compared with the ZIKV prototypes and the 2015 isolates in all cell lineages tested in this study, except in C6/36 cells. In this cell line, the lowpassage strain ZV BR 2016/16288 showed very similar viral growth when compared with the other two recent ZIKV isolates. The ZIKV ZV BR 2016/16288 showed one nonconservative point mutation at residue 26 of the N-terminal region of the NS4B protein (Table III) and one point mutation at residue 349 of NS1 protein that should play an important role in ZIKV infectivity, live virus release and viral RNA replication. NS1 protein is a secreted glycoprotein involved in viral replication and immune evasion during flaviviral infection. Further, one non-synonymous mutation at NS1 associated with a single mutation at E protein in a ZIKV strain was found to alter viral fitness in cell culture and pathogenesis in mice. (26) On the other hand, although the exact topology of flavivirus integral membrane-NS4B on the host membrane compartment is not totally clear, previous studies have shown that the 30 N-terminal residues of NS4B form a dynamic structure that is not associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). (27) Elazar et al. (28) demonstrated that in HCV, the modifications of the amphipathic characteristics of NS4B's N-terminal helix have critical implication for RNA replication. The presence of the threonine residue at NS4B 26 could disrupt the amphipathic nature of the NS4B helix and impact on NS4B functions in distinct cell lines [Supplementary data (Fig. 2) ].",

It is important to emphasize that all three recent ZIKV isolates presented similar profiles of patterns of focus formation in mosquito C6/36 cells; however, in Vero E6 cells, the ZV BR 2015/15098 strain exhibited larger plaque morphology when compared with the smaller plaque phenotype of ZV BR 2015/15261 and ZV BR 2016/16288 (data not shown). These differences can be attributed to the patterns of virus-host interactions in distinct susceptible cell types. Given the observed genotypic and phenotypic differences among the ZIKV isolates, the variations in the amino acid composition of ZIKV proteins could influence the manner by which the viral components interact with host cell, and thus, can modulate their infectivity in different cell substrates.",

            "text": "Human dendritic cells play an important role in antigen presentation to T cells and are also the first target cells of dengue virus after virus infection by a mosquito bite in the skin. It was recently shown that human epidermal keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts and mdDCs (29) are also susceptible to ZIKV infection in vitro. Several receptors are involved in ZIKV infection, such as AXL, Tyro3, TIM-1, and DC-SIGN, which is mainly expressed on dendritic cells and is also known as CD209. (29) An analysis of the patients' blood cells infected by ZIKV revealed that monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells were the main infected cell types; these cell types supported virus replication, and as circulating cells, they could transport the virus to different tissues and fluids. (30) To characterise the infective profile of the different ZIKV strains in a more relevant cell type in ZIKV pathogenesis, we infected the human mdDCs primary cells. In this cellular model, ZV BR 2015/15261 has showed the better viral fitness when compared to the other recent isolates in contrast to the results observed in the experiments carried using mammalian cell lineages. The higher E protein synthesis, live virus release, and viral RNA level production in human mdDcs for the ZV BR 2015/15261 compared to ZV BR 2015/15098 and ZV BR 2015/16288 isolates suggests that T30I, I34T and M181V polymorphisms in NS2A and H92Y polymorphism in protease domain of NS3 protein (Table III) may contribute to both increasing viral fitness and controlling host antiviral response. The effect of the amino acid substitutions (isolated or in combination) identified among the ZV BR 2015/15261 and ZV BR 2015/15098 and ZV BR 2016/16288 isolates on the modulation of the infection rates in different cell substrates deserves further investigation. It is interesting to note that ZV BR 2015/15261, which presented the lowest infectivity in mammalian cell lines, was the isolate that presented the highest infection rates in the mdDCs from healthy donors, which is a more \"physiological\" infection model. We speculate that the four amino acid mutations identified in the NS2A and NS3 proteins that distinguish ZV BR 2015/15261 from the other two isolates (isolated or synergistically) could result in an increase in viral fitness during the infection of human dendritic cells.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we successfully isolated ZIKV from serum samples of patients from two different periods of the Brazilian epidemic. We observed significant differences between the clinical isolates and the well-established ZIKV strains (MR766 and PE243) with an emphasis on the abilities to infect mammalian cells. However, our comparison is limited due to the long passage history of these prototype strains in cell culture and/or mice. This reinforces the importance of using isolates with low numbers of passages to study viral pathogenesis. The mutations on the flavivirus genome are known to influence the virulence, replication efficiency and antigenantibody interaction with the host. In our study, the viral genomes were fully sequenced and revealed some nonsynonymous substitutions, which could have an impact on the viral fitness in mammalian and insect cells. Although there is an increasing amount of data from ZIKV genomic analyses, especially after the 2015/2016 outbreak, there is still a lack of information linking specific amino acid substitution(s) to viral biological characteristics and fitness. Further studies using reverse genetics are essential to define the role of the observed mutations in the differential infection phenotypes observed, especially in human mdDCs. Those future studies could help the understanding of ZIKV replication efficiency and could contribute to the studies of viral attenuation strategies that will ideally lead to vaccine development.",
