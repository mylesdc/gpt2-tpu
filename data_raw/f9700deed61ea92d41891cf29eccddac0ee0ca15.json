However, whether H 2 S could protect against CRF in rats remains unclear. In this study, we found that H 2 S alleviated gentamicininduced nephrotoxicity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated apoptosis in normal rat kidney-52E cells. We demonstrated that H 2 S significantly improved the kidney structure and function of CRF rats. We found that H 2 S decreased the protein levels of Bax, Caspase-3, and Cleaved-caspase-3, but increased the expression of Bcl-2. Treatment with H 2 S reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and ROS and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. H 2 S significantly abolished the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 in the kidney of CRF rats. Furthermore, H 2 S decreased the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, as well as the protein levels of p50, p65, and p-p65 in the kidney of CRF rats. In conclusion, H 2 S could ameliorate adenine-induced CRF in rats by inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation through ROS/mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways.",

CRF is a syndrome characterized by progressive and irreversible deterioration of renal function 2 . In humans, CRF is mainly caused by hypertension, glomerulonephritis, and diabetes mellitus 3, 4 . This condition is made worse by a deterioration in nutrition level caused by accumulation of uremic toxins and reduced food intake, which could be attributed to many factors, such as gastrointestinal congestion, loss of appetite, and reduced glomerular filtration rate 4-6 . Compared to patients with other chronic diseases, patients with CRF tend to require longer and more frequent hospitalizations which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality 7 . Therefore, it is urgent to develop alternative medicines and novel therapies for the treatment of CRF.",

These enzymes have been identified in the kidney and are responsible for endogenous renal H 2 S production 10-12 . An increasing number of studies indicate that H 2 S plays an important role in renal physiology and pathology 11, 13, 14 . The physiological level of H 2 S leads to vasodilation and increases glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow, which causes an indirect increase of the urinary excretion of K + and Na + 13 . Under pathological conditions, H 2 S exerts the protective role in a number of experimental models of renal disease, including obstructive nephropathy 11 , renal ischemia-reperfusion injury 15 , and Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 Scientific RepoRts | 7: 455 | diabetic nephropathy 16 . Recent studies demonstrated that H 2 S is significantly lower in plasma and tissues of uremic patients and 5/6 nephrectomy rats [17] [18] [19] . Considering the beneficial effects of H 2 S in renal physiology and pathology, we hypothesize that the application of exogenous H 2 S may effectively protect against CRF.",

The adenine-induced CRF model in rats is a standard method for inducing metabolic abnormalities closely resembling those observed in uremic patients 23, 24 . Therefore, a rat model of adenine-induced CRF was used in the present study. We also investigated the effects and mechanisms of H 2 S on adenine-induced CRF in rats.",

The concentrations of BUN and Cre and WBC count were significantly increased whereas HGB, HCT, and RBC count were dramatically decreased in CRF group compared to the control group (Fig. 4) . These results indicate that the rat model exhibited typical pathologic features associated with CRF. Compared with the CRF group, the CRF+H 2 S group showed remarkably lower Cre and BUN levels and WBC count and significantly higher HGB, HCT, and RBC count (Fig. 4) . These results demonstrate that the kidney function of CRF rats could be effectively enhanced by administration of H 2 S. H 2 S ameliorates renal injury in CRF rats. Figure 5 showed representative photomicrographs of the HE and MT stainings of the kidney tissues from the control, CRF, and CRF+H 2 S groups. There were no signs of damage in the control group. The kidney tissues of CRF rats showed severe renal injury marked by severe interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration, tubular dilation and atrophy, as well as fibrosis. These results indicate that the rat model exhibited the typical pathological features associated with CRF, which were consistent with previous studies 32, 33 . The severity of renal injury in rats with CRF was significantly ameliorated by treatment with H 2 S. H 2 S reduces apoptosis level in the kidney of CRF rats. Cell apoptosis can be widely detected in CRF patients and inhibition of apoptosis could delay the progress of CRF and reduce the occurrence of related complications 7 .

In contrast, the protein expression of Bcl-2 in CRF group was significantly lower than that in the control group (Fig. 6a,c) . The protein expressions of Bax, Caspase-3, and Cleaved-caspase-3 were remarkably reduced in CRF+H 2 S group, in comparison with CRF group (Fig. 6a,b,d,e) . In addition, the protein expression of Bcl-2 increased significantly in CRF+H 2 S group (Fig. 6a,c) . These findings suggest that the apoptosis level is increased in the kidney of CRF rats, which could be reversed by administration of H 2 S. H 2 S abates oxidative stress in the kidney of CRF rats. A recent study showed that adenine treatment significantly depressed total antioxidant capacity in the kidney of rats 33 . To observe the effect of H 2 S on oxidative stress induced by adenine, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, MDA generation, and ROS accumulation were determined. As shown in Fig. 7 , the levels of MDA and ROS were markedly increased, and the activities of SOD and GSH-Px were significantly decreased compared with the control group, which were all reversed by treatment with H 2 S. These results indicate that H 2 S could abate adenine-induced oxidative stress in the kidney of CRF rats.",

NF-\u03baB is a transcription factor that plays an important role in regulating the expression of cytokine genes involved in several inflammatory diseases, including diabetes, atherosclerosis, and metabolic syndrome 37 . The most abundant form of NF-\u03baB is the heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 38, 39 . In the present study, the protein expressions of p50, p65, and p-p65 in the kidney of rats were measured to investigate the underlying mechanism of H 2 S on the cytokine regulation. Compared with the control group, the protein expressions of p50, p65, and p-p65 and the p-p65/p65 ratio were significantly increased (Fig. 10) . Treatment with H 2 S remarkably decreased the expression levels of p50, p65, and p-p65, as well as the ratio of p-p65/p65 in the kidney of CRF rats (Fig. 10) , indicating that H 2 S could reduce kidney inflammation induced by CRF through the down-regulation of NF-\u03baB expression.

Adenine-induced CRF avoids the potential complications of alternative techniques that require surgery to induce chronic kidney disease 40 . In addition, this method produces more pronounced reductions in glomerular filtration rate compared with the model of 5/6 nephrectomy 41 . Thus, adenine-induced CRF in rats was adopted as a disease model for the evaluation of the effect of H 2 S on CRF. The results showed that the rats fed on the adenine diet for 4 weeks showed increased water intake, urine production, urinary protein, and relative kidney weight, which were similar to the signs and symptoms in rats with adenine-induced CRF 41, 42 . In addition, a previous study has reported a reduction in body weight in adenine-fed rats which could be attributed to the reduced food consumption 43 . Our results were in good accordance with the findings. Administration of H 2 S effectively ameliorated all the above adenine-induced changes.",

Another common complication of CRF is anemia which often contributes to poor functional status and quality of life for CRF patients 40 . The RBC, HGB and HCT values of CRF rats were significantly lower than those of the control group, confirming that anemia had developed in our animal model of CRF. Our results showed that H 2 S was able to reduce the extent of anemia observed in rats with CRF, which was in line with a recent study 45 .",

There are two main apoptotic signaling pathways: the death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway and the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway 47 . The proteins of the Bcl-2 family are key regulators of the mitochondrial pathway, including pro-apoptotic members (such as Bax) and anti-apoptotic members (such as Bcl-2), which can regulate the activation of caspases that cleave a number of cellular proteins, such as caspase-3 47, 48 . Recent studies found that CRF rats had increased apoptosis levels, up-regulated Bax expression, and down-regulated Bcl-2 expression in renal tissues 48, 49 . In line with the above findings, our results showed that the expression levels of Bax, Caspase-3, and Cleaved Caspase-3 were significantly increased and the expression level of Bcl-2 was dramatically decreased in CRF rats. Treatment with H 2 S remarkably decreased the levels of Bax, Caspase-3, and Cleaved Caspase-3, whereas it increased kidney Bcl-2 expression in CRF rats, suggesting that H 2 S could effectively reduce the apoptotic levels induced by CRF in rats.",

All these changes were reversed by administration of H 2 S. Recent studies have proven that ROS can activate MAPKs and apoptotic cell death induced by ROS is mediated by MAPK pathway [52] [53] [54] . The present study identified that CRF increased the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK, whereas H 2 S treatment significantly reversed the CRF-induced increase in MAPKs phosphorylation. These results demonstrated that H 2 S was able to reduce the apoptotic levels induced by CRF through ROS-mediated MAPK pathway.",

It is well documented that the levels of several inflammatory cytokines were higher in CRF patients compared with control subjects, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1 [55] [56] [57] . Similarly, our data indicated that the levels of these cytokines were significantly increased compared with the control group. High levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MCP-1 indicated activation and increased production of cytokines, which can lead to an inflammatory state in the kidney of CRF rats. High levels of IL-10 in the kidney could be suggestive of an aberration in the pro anti-inflammatory adjustment. Administration of H 2 S effectively alleviated renal inflammation in CRF rats. The NF-\u03baB network is involved in a wide range of inflammatory, autoimmune, and malignant disorders 37, 58, 59 . The p50/p65 heterodimer is considered the most important transcription factor of the NF-\u03baB pathway and is specifically referred to as NF-\u03baB 59, 60 . A recent study indicated that the expression of NF-\u03baB was upregulated in the kidney of CRF rats 61 . Our results showed that CRF increased kidney p50, p65, and p-p65 protein expressions as well as the p-p65/p65 ratio, suggesting that CRF induced an inflammatory state in the kidney of rats. However, treatment with H 2 S significantly reversed the changes induced by CRF, suggesting that H 2 S could reduce kidney inflammation through the downregulation of NF-\u03baB expression.",
