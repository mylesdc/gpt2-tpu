The study period was 01.02.2010 to 31.01.2012. We collected PCR results and blood sample results from both our local microbiology laboratory (PCR) and from SSI (PCR and serology). Data were matched on social security number to avoid double sampling. PCR was performed on oropharyngeal-swabs that were stored and transported cooled to the laboratory. Diagnosis of M. pneumoniae was based on a commercially available real-time-PCR (RT-PCR) kit (Minerva Biolabs Venor R Mp Mycoplasma pneumoniae -Diagnostic Kit for qPCR type I) targeting the P1 cytoadhesion gene. The PCR was a multiplex analysis also targeting Chlamydophila pneumoniae/psittaci. The assay was performed in accordance with the manufactures description. In short 10\u03bcl sample was added to 14.4\u03bcl mastermix containing 14\u03bcl buffer, 0.2\u03bcl Taq-polymerase and 0.2\u03bcl Uracil-N-Glycosylase. RT-PCR was performed under the following conditions on a Stratagene Mx 3005P RT-PCR machine: 10 min at 95\u02daC followed by 45 cycles of 30 sec at 95\u02daC, 30 sec at 55\u02daC and 30 sec at 60\u02daC.

Since the KAT titres fall more rapidly after a passed infection, it was used to strengthen the likelihood of an ongoing infection.

During an up-coming epidemic, assessment of extra-pulmonary manifestations, especially immunological based skin reactions, can be helpful when diagnosing M. pneumoniae infections. ",
