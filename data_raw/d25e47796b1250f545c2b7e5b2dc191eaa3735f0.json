Traditionally, immunoscreenings of expression libraries via polyclonal sera on nitrocellulose membranes or screenings of whole proteome lysates in 2-D gel electrophoresis are performed. However, these methods feature some rather inconvenient disadvantages. Screening of expression libraries to expose novel antigens from bacteria often lead to an abundance of false positive signals owing to the high cross reactivity of polyclonal antibodies towards the proteins of the expression host. A method is presented that overcomes many disadvantages of the old procedures.",

One protein with no known immunogenic behaviour before suggested potential immunogenicity. We incorporated a fusion tag prior to our genes of interest and attached the expressed fusion proteins covalently on microarrays. This enhances the specific binding of the proteins compared to nitrocellulose. Thus, it helps to reduce the number of false positives significantly. It enables us to screen for immunogenic proteins in a shorter time, with more samples and statistical reliability. We validated our method by employing several known genes from Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168.",

From January to mid September 2011 52.940 Campylobacter infections have occurred in Germany alone [2] .

The main route of infection and transmission is believed to be the incorrect handling and incomplete cooking of poultry. In fact, studies mention 62% of poultry carcasses to be contaminated with Campylobacter after slaughter [4] .",

Although several genomic typing methods exist [5, 6] these are often time-consuming and laborious. In comparison, a rapid point-of-care device would need a more direct approach like the presence of antigens which react swiftly with specific antibodies. For many pathogens several different methods based on the antigen-antibody-reaction are already commercially available, e.g. Latex-Agglutination-Tests [7] . However, the knowledge of antigens for pathogens is often limited. Traditionally, testing for immunogenic proteins has been carried out by screening of expression libraries using nitrocellulose membranes [8] . Despite its simplicity, this method has a key shortcoming regarding bacterial proteins. The elucidation of novel antigens is extremely difficult as a result of the high cross-reactivity of polyclonal antibodies against the host bacterium of the library [9] . Therefore, a high number of false positives occur, which hinder a fast and successful search for new antigens.",

Plasmids from clones containing the correct-sized inserts were isolated and the MCS was sequenced using both a forward and a reverse primer (HT7 For and Flexi R). During cloning an extra GTT, which encodes for a valine residue in the proteins' primary structures, was inserted immediately prior to each stop codon. As a universal stop codon TAA was used, replacing other stop codons if present.

The last two proteins -pal and pseB -led to contrast values of 0.17 \u00b1 0.11 (pal) and 0.25 \u00b1 0.05 (pseB), which albeit closer are still slightly below the cutoff of 0.25. Subsequently clones are cultivated, protein expression is induced and finally cells are lysed. The whole lysates can directly be spotted to the HaloLink\u2122 Arrays rendering additional time-consuming and costly purification steps obsolete. As only fusion proteins will bind to the ligand, remaining proteins from the lysates are simply washed off after spotting minimizing background and crossreactivity during the subsequent screening steps. The microarray platform allows for several thousand spots per slide allowing for easy high-throughput screening applications. Table 2 for expected gene lengths.

Even then identification of immunogenicity is sometimes difficult at best as sensitivity might be low due to differences in expression rate and losses of protein content during purification. Still, the signal intensities of the five immunogenic proteins were well represented by all three methods -microarray, western blot and dot blot, as those with highest contrast values, namely cjaA, hisJ and peb1a, have also shown bands in western blot and signals in dot blot albeit lower for peb1a. In contrast, pal failed to generate a positive signal during microarray experiments and this result could be confirmed by western blot and dot blot. For flaC no band is visible in western blot and the signal in dot blot is extremely weak, yet our microarray method has identified the protein as being immunogenic, which has been reported elsewhere. A possible explanation for this is the high sensitivity of microarrays. This is well in accordance to Ekins \"ambient analyte theory\" [26] which has been the basic concept of microarrays for several decades.

Four bands are visible in the KRX whole cell lysate with a more prominent band at 70 kDa and three weaker bands at 55 kDa, 28 kDa and roughly 18 kDa.

Further, the choice of our expression host -KRX -and the HaloTag \u00ae have brought other benefits, as well. The expression is tightly regulated, offers high yields and the covalent attachment of the proteins to the surface makes separate purification obsolete as it combines spotting and purification directly. The overall time frame from cultivation to screening is roughly 30 hours, whereas immunoscreening on nitrocellulose membranes [8] takes at least 3 days. The benefit of low turn-around time increases, when taking the cloning into consideration. Normally, cloning to recombinant expressed proteins is first done in propagation cells such as JM109 or DH5\u03b1 and afterwards a second cloning procedure to expression cells as BL21(DE3) is performed.
