Because of the lack of an appropriate cell culture system for supporting HBV infection efficiently, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of hepadnavirus infection remain incompletely understood. Duck heptatitis B virus (DHBV) can naturally infect primary duck hepatocytes (PDHs) that provide valuable model systems for studying hepadnavirus infection in vitro. In this report, we explored global changes in cellular protein expression in DHBV infected PDHs by two-dimension gel electrophoresis (2-DE) combined with MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).",

More than 350 million individuals are HBV carriers worldwide and over one-third of them develop serious liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma [2] . Major obstacles in HBV research have been the inability of the virus to infect cells in vitro and lack of adequate animal models for HBV infection, though primary human hepatocytes and HepaRG cell line have been used to study HBV infection [3] . Human primary hepatocytes and HepaRG cells can support HBV life cycle, but have limitations in accessibility, reproducibility and low level of HBV replication, and a large amount of input virus was needed to infect low proportion of cells [4] [5] [6] . DHBV and woodchuck hepatitis B virus (WHBV) are classified into the family of hepadnaviridae. Thus for hepadnavirus infection primary hepatocytes of ducks (DHBV) and woodchucks (WHBV) are still considered as suitable models for investigating the viral replication and pathogenesis [7, 8] .",

The efficiency of DHBV infection in PDHs was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-DHBV preS monoclonal antibody. PDHs inoculated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) as a control. At 12 h and 24 h after infection, only a few cells showed fluorescence (data not shown), and at 72 h post-infection about 30% of cells expressed viral large surface antigen, indicating that cells were infected with DHBV, showed in Figure 1 . DHBV DNA in PDHs was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization using an alpha-32 P-dCTP labeled DHBV-specific probe, and DHBV in the supernatant was detected by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

HCVinfected cells exhibit increased levels of the enzymes catalyzing glutamine flux to replenish metabolic intermediates through the latter half of the citric acid cycle providing substrates for ATP production [18] .

Hsp70 assists folding of many newly synthesized polypeptides, and refolding of the proteins misfolded [41, 42] . Hsp70 can enhance flock house virus replication [43, 44] . Hsp70 and Hsp90 participate in dengue virus entry as a receptor complex [45] . Moreover, HBV P protein activation in vitro is fundamentally dependent on heat shock protein 70 family Hsc70/Hsp40 [46] . In HBV-replicating HepAD38 cell, expressions of heat shock proteins (Hsp70 and Hsp90) and Mn superoxide dismutase increase, after HBV replication induced by tetracycline [47] . In humanized transgenic mice, inhibition of HBV replication results in suppression of Mn superoxide dismutase expression in hepatocytes [47, 48] . It suggests that oxidative stress can be induced by hepadnavirus replication as Epstein-Barr virus [49] . Annexin A2, belongs to a family of calcium-dependent, phospholipid binding proteins, is involved in many biological processes, such as the Ca 2+ dependent exocytosis, calcium transport and cell proliferation. It participates in viral infection, including assisting in the assembly of HIV in monocyte-derived macrophages [50] , as a cellular cofactor supporting HIV-1 infection [51] , enhancing cytomegalovirus binding and membrane fusion [52] and supporting the replication of influenza viruses by mediating activation of plasminogen [53] . It has been reported that HBV polymerase activity was inhibited by interacted with S100A10, a protein binding to annexin A2 [54] . In HepG2.2.15 compared with HepG2, annexin A2 was revealed down-regulated [55] , which was consistent with our observation in DHBV-PDHs model and confirmed by Western blot analysis. It indicated that annexin A2 may involve in hepadnavirus infection and warrants further investigation.",

Most of them involve in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, stress responses and cytoskeleton processes including alpha-enolase, beta-actin, lamin A and annexin A2. It suggests that those proteins may play important roles in hepadnavirus infection. Differential expressions of annexin A2 and beta-actin were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Further investigation of the roles of the differentially expressed cellular proteins will help to understand cellular and molecular mechanisms of hepadnavirus infection.",

To compensate the variability of gel electrophoresis, at least three replicate gels were performed for each group. In the first dimensional isoelectric focusing (IEF), 120 \u03bcg proteins of each sample were diluted to 450 \u03bcl with rehydration buffer containing 8 M urea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 50 mM DTT, 0.5% (v/v) ampholyte (pH 3-10, nonlinear, Amersham Biosciences), and IPG strips were allowed to rehydrate in the above solution under mineral oil. IEF was performed as follow: 30 V for 6 h (active rehydration); 60 V for 6 h (active rehydration); 500 V for 2 h, rapid; 1,000 V for 2 h, rapid; 4,000 V for 2 h, linear; linear ramping to 8,000 V for 2 h, and finally 8,000 V for about 7 h with a total of 64 KVh at 20\u00b0C. Then the IPG strips were incubated in equilibration buffer (75 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 6 M urea, 29.3% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS and 0.002% (w/v) bromophenol blue) containing 2% (w/v) DTT for 15 min with gentle agitation, followed by incubation in the same equilibration buffer supplemented with 2.5% (w/v) iodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature. The second dimension SDS-PAGE was performed on 1 mm thick 12.5% polyacrilamide vertical gels in Ettan-Dalt Six system using 5 W/gel for 30 min, and followed by 12 W/gel at 10\u00b0C until the bromophenol blue dye front reached the end of the gels. The gels were stained by a modified silver staining method compatible with MS analysis [64] and scanned at 300 dpi (dots/inch) using ImageScanner (UMAX, Amersham Biosciences).",

To select differentially expressed protein spots, quantitative analysis was performed using the Student's t-test to compare the percentage volumes of spots between DHBV infected and uninfected groups at three time points. The differentially expressed protein spots with p-values less than 0.05 were considered as significant differences, and at least 1.5 fold difference in percentage of the volume for each spot was set as a threshold. These protein spots were selected and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion and identification by MS.",

Myoglobin digested by trypsin was used to calibrate the mass instrument with internal calibration mode. All acquired spectra of samples were processed using 4700 series Explore software (Applied Biosystems) in a default mode. The parent mass peaks with mass range 700-3200 Da and minimum S/N 20 were picked out for tandem TOF/TOF analysis. Combined MS and MS/MS spectra were submitted to MAS-COT (V2.1, Matrix Science) by GPS Explorer software (V3.6, Applied Biosystems) and searched with the following parameters: NCBInr database (release date: 2009.11), taxonomy of bony vertebrates or viruses, trypsin digest with one missing cleavage, none fixed modifications, MS tolerance of 100 ppm, MS/MS tolerance of 0.6 Da and possible oxidation of methionine. Known contaminant ions (human keratin and tryptic autodigest peptides, etc.) were excluded. MASCOT protein scores (based on MS and MS/MS spectra) with greater than 72 were considered statistically significant (p < 0.05). The individual MS/MS spectrum with statistically significant (confidence interval >95%) and best ion score (based on MS/ MS spectra) was accepted. To eliminate the redundancy of proteins that appeared in the database under different names and accession numbers, the protein belonging to the species Anas platyrhynchos or with the highest protein score (top rank) was singled out.",

The blots were then washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 1 hour at room temperature. After washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, the bands were developed with ECL detection reagent (Pierce).
