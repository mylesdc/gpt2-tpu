A total of 175 throat swab specimens of influenza-positive cases collected at National Influenza Center, Nepal, during the 2015/16 winter season were selected for detecting other respiratory copathogens.

A laboratory-based ILI surveillance system is well established in Nepal and has greatly contributed to outbreak investigation, surveillance, and timely response since the emergence of pandemic influenza in 2009. e influenza viruses circulating in Nepal have many similarities with our neighboring countries and the regions. We reported year-round transmission of influenza with a peak activity during the rainy and winter seasons is similar to ailand, Northern Vietnam, and Lao PDR [7] . An efficient detection method is of great importance for laboratory diagnosis. Rapid antigen detection, viral cultures, and molecular methods, such as PCR assays, are currently used as the viral detection method [8] . In clinical settings, rapid and reliable PCR assays are particularly helpful in making early decisions regarding management and treatment of the patients. In this study, we attempt to characterize the influenza and other ARI pathogens by the multiplex PCR assay in children with influenza-like illness cases.",
