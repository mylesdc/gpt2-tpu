In this study, we characterized the changing trends and serotype distribution of Shigella species in Beijing from 1994 to 2010. A total of 5999 Shigella strains were isolated and serotyped from the 302nd Hospital in Beijing. The annual number of Shigella isolates reached a peak (n = 1192; 19.84%) in 1996 and then decreased annually, reaching the lowest point (n = 24; 0.41%) in 2010. S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei were the most frequently isolated Shigella, with their respective isolates making up 53.3% and 27.6% of the total. Isolates of S. flexneri 4c, 4a, and x made up 3% respectively of the total isolates. Significant decreases in percentage of S. flexneri over time were observed. S. sonnei surpassed S. flexneri 2a as the predominant serotype in 2000. Most isolates were recovered from July to September; 13.6% of the isolates were recovered from children aged 0 to 5 years, and 16% were recovered from those aged 21 to 25 years. S. flexneri 2a and 5 were recovered mostly from males (33.41%, p < 0.001; and 0.46%, p < 0.001%; respectively), whereas S. flexneri 2b and 6, and S. sonnei were most often isolated from females. Continuous monitoring of Shigella showed that all 4 species and 27 serotypes were present in Beijing, China, during the study period. The emergence of S. sonnei and the overall decreasing isolation rate of Shigella in Beijing can potentially aid in the development of vaccine and control strategies for shigellosis in the city.",

The recording of annual Shigella isolation began in 1994, and the maximum number of isolates was reported in 1996 (n = 1194). The annual total number of isolated Shigella organisms had been decreasing since then, reaching a low point in 2008 (n = 22). This trend may be related to the strict hygiene inspection and adequate sanitation during the 2008 Olympic season [17] . Four peaks were observed during the 17-year collection period. Peak 1 appeared in 1996, with subsequent peaks in 1998 (peak 2, n = 602), 2002 (peak 3, n = 398), and 2004 (peak 4, n = 251). A sudden decrease in Shigella isolation was observed more in 2003 than in 2002 and 2004; one possible explanation is that resources were redirected to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome cases in China in 2003, thereby limiting bacterial diarrheal isolation. It should be noted that as the numbers of observed cases of shigellosis were decreasing, China's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) was increasing ( Figure 3 ).",

            "text": "The prevailing Shigella spp. in developing countries is S. flexneri, whereas that in developed countries is S. sonnei [14] . The same transition of dominant Shigella species observed not only in Beijing but also in southern Vietnam [20] and in Dhaka [21] , all of which have undergone rapid economic development in recent years; the phenomenon supporting the circulating species and serotypes may be considered as a marker of the socioeconomic climate in an individual setting [22] . This gross economic improvement may have positively affected the quality of drinking water and the overall behavioral change in personal hygiene. These changes in turn may have influenced host characteristics, including the reduction of overall malnutrition that leads to an improved immune response. The genetic mutation of non-virulent microbes into pathogenic ones [23] may have also played an important role in the emergence of S. sonnei.In this study, the 2006 data were compared with that of another similar report based on a study in Henan Province, China, in 2006 [18] . Shigella infection in Beijing reached its peak in August 2006, whereas that in Henan Province reached its peak in July 2006. For the same period, the data from the China Meteorological Administration (http://cdc.cma.gov.cn/home.do) revealed that the highest temperature in Beijing was recorded in August, whereas that in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, was recorded in July. Rainfall for this year peaked in July for both provinces. The high temperatures appear to more related to the seasonality of the Shigella infection than to the amount of rainfall; the same has also been observed in southern Vietnam [20] .Interestingly, the top three most common S. flexneri serotypes from 1994 to 2010 were S. flexneri 2a, 4c, and x; overall, S. flexneri 2a ranked first, but S. flexneri 4c was the most dominant S. flexneri in 2004 and 2005. The same result was reported in Henan Province in 2006, during which S. flexneri 4c was the most frequently isolated serotype [18] . The distribution of S. flexneri serotypes between Beijing and other areas in China was highly heterogeneous from site to site and year to year. The observation that S. flexneri 4c had become dominant in Beijing and Henan suggests the spread of S. flexneri 4c throughout China. This serotype was first isolated in the USSR in the 1980s [24] . Similar to Beijing, S. flexneri 4c became the most predominant serotype in Zhejiang Province [25] . The factors contributing to the rise and the fall of S. flexneri 4c in China have not yet been fully explored. This study also highlighted the observation that age influenced the serotype distribution within the Shigella spp. Skewed gender distribution toward males was found for S. sonnei infection, which affected more males than females in Beijing; the same was also observed in Henan Province, China [18] .In conclusion, the change across 17 years in dominant Shigella species from S. flexneri to S. sonnei was uncovered. The results would be important in the treatment and prevention of shigellosis or in the implementation of vaccine strategies. The results also highlights the need for continuous monitoring of Shigella in the future.",
