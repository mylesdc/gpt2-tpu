Upon sequence analysis of the complete capsid, the six NoVs were found to be identical, suggesting the spread of a unique NoV strain in the shelter. The full-length genomic sequence (7839 nt) of one feline NoV, CU081210E/ 2010/US, was determined. In the capsid protein VP1 region, the virus displayed the highest amino acid identity to animal genogroup IV genotype 2 (GIV.2) NoVs: lion/Pistoia-387/06/IT (97.9%) and dog/Bari-170/07/IT (90.4%). These findings document the discovery of a novel feline calicivirus, different from vesiviruses, and extend the spectrum of NoV host range. Epidemiological studies using feline NoV-specific diagnostic tools and experimental infection of cats are required to understand whether NoVs have a pathogenic role in this species.",

Human NoVs have a worldwide distribution and represent the major cause of non bacterial gastroenteritis. The genome of NoV possesses three open reading frames (ORFs) encoding for a large non-structural polyprotein, a major capsid protein (VP1) and a small basic structural protein (VP2). Based on the full-length VP1, NoVs have been classified into five distinct genogroups (GI to V) [2] . GI, GII and GIV NoVs infect humans, with GII NoVs accounting for the majority of human infections [3] . NoVs have also been detected in animals and classified as GII (swine), GIII (ruminants), GIV (lions and dogs) and GV (mice) [1, 4] .",

Small round structured viruses (SRSVs) have been detected occasionally in the feces of cats by using electron microscopy (EM) and have been mostly characterized as FCV [12, 14] . Interestingly, Norwalk-like 27-nm virus particles, clearly distinguishable from FCVs, were detected from an outbreak of vomiting and diarrhea in adult cats in Germany in 1987, although the viruses were neither adapted to cultivation in vitro nor characterized further [15] . More recently, antibodies specific for the baculovirus-expressed VP1 of Lion/NoV/Pistoia-387/ 06/IT were detected in the sera of cats by ELISA. These previous findings suggest that NoVs infect cats [16] .",

This novel feline calicivirus was detected in 6/14 samples collected from cats housed in a shelter in New York State (collection B) ( Table 1 ). These findings are in agreement with previous evidence that cats can be infected with NoVs [15, 16] . It is of relevance that animals from group B showed enteric symptoms and were young kittens almost of the same age (8 to 12 weeks old). This age period is critical for kittens, since maternally derived antibodies tend to wane and the animals become fully susceptible to various pathogens [32] . On the other hand, NoVs were not detected in animals from group A. This might reflect either geographic or temporal variations, age-related patterns of susceptibility or merely the relatively small number of samples included in the analysis.",

Therefore, sequence data spanning this region is available for most NoV strains.

Larger epidemiological investigations and animal experiments are warranted to assess firmly the role of NoV infections in cats.
