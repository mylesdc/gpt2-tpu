            "text": "Influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance is important to identify circulating and emerging/reemerging strains and unusual epidemiological trends. The present study aimed to give an accurate picture of the 2012-2013 ILI outbreak in Corsica by combining data from several surveillance systems: general practice, emergency general practice, hospital emergency units, intensive care units, and nursing homes. Twenty-eight respiratory viruses were retrospectively investigated from patients in general practice with ILI. Sequence analysis of the genetic changes in the hemagglutinin gene of influenza viruses (A(H1N1)pdm2009, A(H3N2) and B) was performed. The trends in ILI/influenza consultation rates and the relative illness ratios (RIRs) of having an ILI consultation were estimated by age group for the different surveillance systems analyzed. Of the 182 ILI patients enrolled by general practitioners, 57.7% tested positive for influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analyses suggested a genetic drift for influenza B and A(H3N2) viruses. The ILI/influenza surveillance systems showed similar trends and were well correlated. In accordance with virological data, the RIRs of having an ILI consultation were highest among the young (,15 years old) and decreased with age. No clusters of acute respiratory illness were declared by the sentinel nursing homes. This study is noteworthy in that it is the first extensive description of the 2012-2013 ILI outbreak in Corsica as monitored through several surveillance systems. To improve ILI surveillance in Corsica, a consortium that links together the complementary regional surveillance ILI systems described here is being implemented.",

Sample collection from patients with ILI was performed with S-VirocultH swabs (ELITech, France). The nasopharyngeal swabs were sent by mail to the virological laboratory in 1 mL of viral transport medium and stored at 280uC. Patient information, including demographic characteristics, symptoms, risk factors for severe influenza, treatment, vaccination status, and hospitalization, was documented in case report forms. All samples were tested for influenza viruses A (A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm2009) and B by influenza real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) ( Table 1) [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .

In Corsica, this emergency general practice surveillance system was implemented in December 2010. It is based on the activity of 11 GPs covering a population of 100 000 habitants (the Ajaccio area in the southwest of Corsica; see Figure 1 ) and responding to private house calls 24 h a day, 7 days a week [8] . The GPs report on a daily basis the sociodemographic and medical data for each patient visited (age, sex, diagnosis and hospitalization) [20] . For maximal comparability with respect to the definition of the French Sentinelles network for the inclusion of ILI patients, the SOS M\u00e9decins ILI definition (sudden fever of 38.5uC or above, respiratory symptoms and myalgia) is coded according to the International Classification of Primary Care (code ''R80 Influenza/R80 ILI) [20] . The weekly number of visits coded as ''R80 Influenza/R80 ILI'' by SOS M\u00e9decins, was analyzed. The chosen indicator of ILI activity was the number of ILIs coded per week divided by the total number of visits coded per week.",

The J09 code corresponds to influenza due to A(H1N1)pdm2009, J10 corresponds to influenza caused by other identified influenza viruses, and J11 corresponds to an ILI caused by unidentified influenza viruses. The indicator chosen was the number of cases coded J09 to J11 per week divided by the total number of visits coded per week. Clinicians are required to report all probable and confirmed influenza cases admitted to an ICU to the regional office of the InVS (cellules de l'InVS en region), using a standardized notification form.

It should be noted that while human respiratory syncytial virus (A/B), was the second most frequently detected respiratory virus after influenza in patients aged less than 15 years, in agreement with previous studies [31] , HRV was the most frequently detected virus in patients aged .65 years. Information about the non influenza viral infections such as HRV to ILI episodes in older persons is poor, partly because of difficulties in diagnosis related to atypical presentations and low viral loads [32] [33] [34] . Previously, it has been suggested that HRV could be the cause of exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases and could increase morbidity rates in frail persons as, including the elderly [33] [34] . Overall, the RIR of consulting for an ILI was similar among the different surveillance networks analyzed here and decreased significantly with age. Two age groups were characterized by an RIR above 1: preschool and school-aged children less than 14 years old, and working adults aged 30-44 years. This peak in the 30-44-year-old group could be explained by their proximity to children as parents. This trend is in accordance with the viral etiology of the epidemic, characterized by the cocirculation of A(H1N1)pdm2009 and B influenza viruses [35] .",

This was remarkable because of the significant cocirculation of influenza A and B viruses and of other respiratory viruses. This finding is likely attributable to the high VC against influenza viruses among residents, similar to the VC previously reported in French nursing homes [36] , and a certain degree of cross-protection from previous exposure to influenza A(H1N1)pdm2009 [37] . It could also be due to the result of better general hygiene management, as demonstrated by the rarity of clusters of gastroenteritis (N = 3) declared by the same sentinel nursing homes. However, it is unlikely to have arisen through a good VC among staff, as this was low (16%), similar to staff VC levels previously reported that ranged from 10% to 50% [36] .",

Except for one strain that belonged to the group 3, all other Influenza B strains fell into genetic group 2 and were characterized by five mutations compared with the vaccine strain, located at four antigenic sites, which could suggest a drift [42] .

As previously reported, the HA sequences of A(H3N2) viruses isolated in Corsica during the 2012-2013 season [10] were characterized by seven amino acid substitutions at four antigenic sites compared with A/ Victoria/361/2011 (2012-2013 vaccine strain), suggesting a drift [42] .",

The monitoring of ILI, is mainly based on clinical surveillance, as the virological surveillance, for instance, was carried out by the Sentinelles network. The lack of virological confirmation for the patients of the emergency general practice network (SOS M\u00e9decins), who visited the hospital emergency departments (OSCOUR) and/or in nursing homes is an important gap. The evaluation of the causative agents of ILI in patients enrolled by the GPs of the Sentinelles network did not cover all possible respiratory pathogens, as other bacterial or viral pathogens that can cause ILI were not investigated. It is possible that a low viral titer could not be detected by RT--PCR. Moreover, antigenic characterization of the influenza viruses that were characterized genetically was not performed. Overall, the patients were enrolled using a rather specific ILI case definition (especially for the Sentinelles network and for the SOS M\u00e9decins network), excluding infected patients with atypical ILI symptom presentations, including older persons, as well as asymptomatic infections. Finally, the epidemic threshold was only available for the ILI consultation rates reported by the Sentinelles GPs at a national level, which may not be adequate at a regional level with respect to the GPs Sentinelles network and with respect to the other local surveillance systems.",

The French Sentinelles network's ILI rates indicate that the 2012-2013 epidemic in mainland France started during week 51, 2012 (from December 17 to December 23, 2012), peaked at week 5, 2013 (from January 28 to February 3, 2013), and fell below the epidemic threshold during week 11, 2013 (from March 11 to March 17, 2013). All surveillance systems analyzed had a significant and strong correlation with the ILI consultation rates of the Corsican Sentinelles GPs (Figure 2) during the epidemic period. The highest correlation coefficient was seen for the incidence reported by the French Sentinelles network (r = 0.862; p,0.05), followed by the ILI rates estimated by emergency GPs in Corsica (SOS M\u00e9decins) (r = 0.821; p,0.05) and hospital emergency units (OSCOUR) (r = 0.615; p,0.05) (Figure 2).",
