Information remains limited about the comparative protein expression of host cells in response to TGEV infection. In this study, cellular protein response to TGEV infection in swine testes (ST) cells was analyzed, using the proteomic method of two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) coupled with MALDI-TOF-TOF/MS identification. Results: 33 differentially expressed protein spots, of which 23 were up-regulated and 10 were down-regulated were identified. All the protein spots were successfully identified. The identified proteins were involved in the regulation of essential processes such as cellular structure and integrity, RNA processing, protein biosynthesis and modification, vesicle transport, signal transduction, and the mitochondrial pathway. Western blot analysis was used to validate the changes of alpha tubulin, keratin 19, and prohibitin during TGEV infection. Conclusions: To our knowledge, we have performed the first analysis of the proteomic changes in host cell during TGEV infection. 17 altered cellular proteins that differentially expressed in TGEV infection were identified. The present study provides protein-related information that should be useful for understanding the host cell response to TGEV infection and the underlying mechanism of TGEV replication and pathogenicity.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family [1] . The infection of TGEV causes severe diarrhea in suckling piglets (about 2 weeks old) and its lethality approaches 100%, which results in enormous economic loss in swine-producing areas in the world [2] . TGEV is an enveloped virus with a positivesense RNA genome of 28.5 kb. About two-thirds of the TGEV genome encodes the replicase proteins (rep) at the 5\u2032 end, and one-third of the genome encodes other viral genes at the 3\u2032 end in an order of 5\u2032-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u2032 [3] . The genome of TGEV encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M,), minor envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The surface protein S, a large type I transmembrane glycoprotein that forms peplomers, is responsible for cell receptor binding and membrane fusion [4] . The M protein spans the membrane and interacts with the N protein to form core of the virus during assembly [5, 6] . The small E protein, a transmembrane protein detected as a minor structural component, is essential for TGEV replication [7] . The N protein, an internal phosphoprotein [8] , interacts with the TGEV genomic RNA to form viral nucleocapsid [5, 9] , and may disrupt host cell division [10] . To date, there is limited information about host cell responses to TGEV infection.",

Among those techniques for differentially expressed protein spot analysis, two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) is reproducible and sensitive [13] . 2D DIGE has greatly facilitated the comparison of two samples by removing gel-to-gel variability and by using dyes (CyDye) with a greater dynamic range than traditionally used silver or Coomassie stains [14] . Using 2D DIGE method followed by mass spectrometry (MS) identification, comparative proteomics of host cells have been investigated during virus infection, including human influenza A virus [15] , human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [16] , hepatitis B virus [17] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [18] , Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [19] , and Dengue virus (DENV) [20] , and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV) [21] .

Previous works have reported that TPMT plays a role in BVDV virus replication and thiopurines inhibit bovine viral diarrhea virus production in a TPMT-dependent manner [40] . Based on these data, an up-regulation of TPMT in TGEV-infected ST cells suggests that this host protein plays an important role in TGEV biology, making it possible target for future drug development. Viruses rely on the cellular translation machinery to translate their own proteins, which facilitates the rapid production of viral proteins and renders an inhibitory effect on the production of host proteins, including host anti-viral proteins [41] . Translation factors have been well documented as playing crucial roles in viral RNA and protein synthesis [42] . In herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infected HeLa cells, the synthesis of several ribosomal proteins and their assembly into ribosomes continue in spite of a general inhibition of cellular protein synthesis [43] . Acidic ribosomal protein P0 (RPLP0) is located in the active part of the ribosome particle, at which mRNAs, tRNAs and translation factors interact during protein synthesis [44] . The cellular RPLP0 was observed as up-regulated after virus infection, such as pseudorabies virus (PrV) infected bovine kidney cells [45] , and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infected primary B cells [46] .

PP2A enzymes have been clearly involved in regulation of cell transcription, cell cycle and viral transformation [50] . Upregulation of PP2A scaffold subunit A and subsequent dephosphorylation of Tyr-307 in the catalytic subunit was found, suggesting PP2A activation in Huh7 infected cells [51, 52] . Activation of serine-threonine PP2A was found in Huh7 cells upon HSV-1 infection, and PP2A activation paralleled dephosphorylation and inactivation of the downstream mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway [53] . In this study, the up-regulation of PP2A was found in TGEV infected ST cells, suggesting PP2A plays an important role in the dephosphorylation of cellular and viral protein during TGEV infection.",

By comparing the finding proteins in this study to previous findings, there is no common gene of target related to coronavirus. The findings in TGEV infected ST cell might not reflect the interaction between the virus and pig intestine epithelial cell. It is surprising that the proteome responses observed did not reveal any immune responses related proteins in TGEV-infected ST cells. It may be related to the host cells chosen or the fact that attenuated TGEV strain was used. Identification of cellular proteome in pig intestine epithelial cell or immune cells infected with TGEV need to be further studied.",

Briefly, the ST cells were infected with attenuated H (H167) at a multiplication of infection (MOI) of 1, and the cells were scraped using a cell scraper at 48 h postinfection (p.i.), and centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min. After washing three times with icecold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the collected cells were lysed with lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% [w/v] CHAPS, 65 mM DTT, 0.2% pharmalyte 4/7 and 1 mM PMSF) containing 1% nuclease mix in the final concentration and were vertically vibrated until the cells were completely lysed. The supernatant was collected after centrifuging at 12,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C for 60 min. Samples were treated with a 2D clean-up kit (GE Health Care) and a 2D quant kit (GE Health Care) according to the instructions of the manufacturers. Paralleled mock-infected ST cells were used as control. Three biological replicates of TGEVinfected and mock-infected ST cells were prepared.",

To access biological variation, three experimental duplicates were carried out using the samples prepared above. The internal standards (equal amounts of both samples) were labeled with Cy2. Protein extracts from mock-infected ST cells, used as a reference state, were labeled with Cy5. Protein extracts from TGEV-infected ST cells were labeled with Cy3, representing the test states. IEF was performed using an IPGphor system (GE Healthcare) and commercially available 24-cm long IPG strips (Linear, pH 4-7, GE Healthcare). The settings and conditions for active rehydration of the IPG strips were used as previously described [60] . Briefly, IEF was performed using the following parameters: 30 V, 12 h; 200 V, 1 h; 1,000 V, 1 h; 8,000 V, 2 h; and 8,000 V, 65,000 vh. The isoelectric-focused proteins in strips were incubated for 15 min in the equilibration buffer (6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 0.375 M Tris, pH 8.8) containing 1% DTT, followed by additional equilibration for 15 min in the equilibration buffer containing 2.5% iodoacetamide. The second dimension separation was performed using the Ettan Dalt II system (GE healthcare). Gels were poured between low fluorescent glass plates, of which one plate was bind-silane treated. Three parallel gels were run at 12\u00b0C (running buffer: 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine and 1% SDS).

The protein spots of interest were manually excised from the gels and plated into 96-well microplates. Excised spots were firstly destained twice with 60 \u03bcl of 50 mM NH4HCO3 and 50% acetonitrile (ACN) and then dried twice with 60 \u03bcl of ACN. Afterwards, the dried pieces of gels were incubated in ice-cold digestion solution (trypsin 12.5 ng/\u03bcl and 20 mM NH4HCO3) for 20 min and then transferred into a 37\u00b0C incubator for digestion overnight. Finally, peptides in the supernatant were collected after extraction twice with 60 \u03bcl extract solution (0.1% TFA in 50% ACN). The peptide solution was dried under the protection of N2, and 0.8 \u03bcl matrix solution (5 mg/ml \u03b1cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid diluted in 0.1%TFA, 50% ACN) was pipetted to dissolve it. Then the mixture was spotted on a MALDI target plate (Applied Biosystems). MS analysis of peptides was performed on an AB SCIEX 5800 MALDI-TOF/TOF. The UV laser was operated at a 400 Hz repetition rate with wavelength of 355 nm. The accelerated voltage was operated at 20 kV and mass resolution was maximized at 1,600 Da. Myoglobin digested with trypsin was used to calibrate the mass instrument with an internal calibration mode. All acquired spectra from samples were processed using TOF/TOF Explore\u2122 Software in a default mode. The data were searched by GPS Explorer (V3.6) with the search engine MASCOT (2.1). The following parameters were used in the search: National Center for Biotechnology information nonredundant (NCBInr) database (release date, July, 2011), Sus scrofa, protein molecular mass ranged from 700 to 3,600 Da, trypsin digest with one missing cleavage, peptide tolerance of 100 ppm,MS/MS tolerance of 0.8 Da and possible oxidation of methionine.
