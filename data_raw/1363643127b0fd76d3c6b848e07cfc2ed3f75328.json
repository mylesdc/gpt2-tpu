There are no licensed vaccines or drugs for human metapneumovirus. We developed a fluorescent, cell-based medium-throughput screening assay for human metapneumovirus that captures inhibitors of all stages of the viral lifecycle except budding of progeny virus particles from the cell membrane. We optimized and validated the assay and performed a successful medium-throughput screening. A number of hits were identified, several of which were confirmed to inhibit viral replication in secondary assays. This assay offers potential to discover new antivirals for human metapneumovirus and related respiratory viruses. Compounds discovered using the medium-throughput screening may also provide useful probes of viral biology.",

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are associated with milder disease and improved outcomes of influenza infection in humans, although the mechanism is unknown and clinical trials have offered conflicting results. [16] [17] [18] [19] Statins have been shown to inhibit endocytosis of influenza virus 28 and HMPV enters cells by endocytosis, 29 making the identification of statins and the endocytosis inhibitor chlorprothixene interesting. Indeed, statins inhibited HMPV infection by $50%. However, HMPV is capable of entering cells both at the plasma membrane and via endocytosis. [29] [30] [31] Thus, the only partial inhibition of HMPV by statins (Figure 4 ) may be due to preserved viral entry at the cell surface that is not inhibited by endocytosis inhibitors. Statins are competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, a rate-limiting step in the mevalonate pathway. In addition to their role in inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis, statins also impact other cellular processes. Statins can inhibit prenylation of proteins as well as inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis. While there are no data on prenylation of HMPV proteins, prenylation of viral proteins is proven to be important for hepatitis D virus and thought to be important for HIV and HSV. 32 Future studies may elucidate the mechanism of HMPV inhibition by statins.",
