By taking a classic herbal formula (Yu Ping Feng decoction, YPF) as an example, this study developed a novel network pharmacology based method to identify its potential therapeutic targets. First, this study constructed a \"targets-(pathways)-targets\" (TPT) network in which targets of YPF were connected by relevant pathways; then, this network was decomposed into separate modules with strong internal connections; lastly, the propensity of each module toward different diseases was assessed by a contribution score. On the basis of a significant association between network modules and therapeutic diseases validated by chi-square test (p-value < 0.001), this study identified the network module with the strongest propensity toward therapeutic diseases of YPF. Further, the targets with the highest centrality in this module are recommended as YPF's potential therapeutic targets. By integrating the complicated \"multi-targetsmulti-pathways-multi-diseases\" relationship of herbal formulas, the method shows promise for identifying its potential therapeutic targets, which could contribute to the modern scientific illustration of TCMs' traditional clinical applications.",

Herein, a contribution score (CS) was calculated to evaluate the contribution of each module to different diseases based on the network modules' partition and pathways-diseases interactions.

YPF decoction consists of three herbs and a total of 352 compounds, which were collected with PubChem CID and they belonged to flavonoids, saponins, saccharides, and volatile components (including phenylpropanoids, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and triterpenes). The rapid development of bioinformatics and computational sciences has provided a wide range of approaches for targets prediction of small molecules 24 . In this study, the putative targets of compounds were identified based on the similarity ensemble approach (SEA: http://sea.bkslab.org/) 25 . The potential targets of 250 compounds were successfully predicted by the SEA, with a total of 968 protein targets. (A worth-mentioning issue is about the high amount of 968 potential \"targets\" of YPF decoction, especially in terms of the relative small target pool of SEA. We tried to narrow the scope of potential \"targets\" of YPF decoction by setting up a pre-enrichment filter based on Tc threshold value. In this way, the number of \"targets\" for enrichment analysis sharply decreases from 968 to 304. However, the results of the most-important potential therapeutic targets and potential active compounds of YPF have no obvious changes. Thus, we still chose the post-enrichment filtering strategy, considering the advantage of this strategy with more informative reference to alternative targets. Throughout this paper, the term \"targets\" refers to the putative proteins to which the ingredients from YPF decoction directly bind, according to SEA predictions; however, it is not known whether targets are responsible for the therapeutic effect of YPF decoction. The term \"therapeutic targets\" refers to partial proteins from targets that have been identified to be responsible for the therapeutic effect of YPF decoction by our novel NP-based method.) Then, the target-pathway interactions were generated to elucidate the biological pathways that YPF decoction might impact; moreover, the overrepresented KEGG pathways of the predicted 968 protein targets of YPF were identified from enrichment analysis. A total of 132 highly related pathways with 549 relevant protein targets were obtained.

The nodes represent putative targets of YPF (orange), relevant pathways (light blue), and diseases (deep purple). From Fig. 2(a) , it is difficult to determine which targets might be most relevant to the therapeutic effect that YPF exerts; therefore, the novel TPT network was established to realise the recognition of therapeutic-based targets of YPF decoction, as shown in Fig. 2 (b). Eight modules (modules 1-8) were detected and divided by the Louvain algorithm incorporated in the Gephi software at a resolution of 1.0 32, 33 . According to graph theory, the TPT network shown in Fig. 2 (b) suggests some significant structural information, especially when considering the relatively separated modules with dense internal connections. Then, the inner interactions (edges representing the common pathways between every two nodes) of each target module were further investigated.",

In this study, the ATC code of the approved drugs was abbreviated to level 1 to understand the organ or anatomical system on which they act. For example, the ABL1 (tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1) has been reported to be targeted by the drug \"dasatinib\", whose ATC code is L01XE06, and the connotation is shown as follows: The level 1 abbreviation of the ATC code for dasatinib is L, which denotes that the therapeutic area of the drug dasatinib is antineoplastic and immunomodulating.

The above identification and CS of modules combined with statistical analysis were carried out to determine the therapeutic targets module that was highly associated with the therapeutic activity of YPF decoction. The following centrality analysis was conducted to evaluate the importance of the targets (nodes) within the therapeutic targets module from the perspective of the topological analysis of the TPT network. Four centrality indicators, i.e., degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality, were used to measure the importance of the targets (nodes) from the different perspectives [55] [56] [57] . Then, an integrated indicator, namely target importance (TI), was calculated accordingly. Next, the top 10% therapeutic targets by TI were selected and recommended for further pharmacology study in the context of the mechanism illustration of YPF decoction. From a holistic perspective, YPF might interfere with targets in module 7 in a synergistic way, some of which (with higher centrality), as illustrated in Table 3 , can be considered to be the most potential therapeutic targets of YPF. Moreover, the compounds relevant to these targets according to the SEA prediction can be recommended as potential active ingredients in YPF decoction in Table 3 .",

Literature mining also supplemented the information from these databases. The common amino acids and compounds with high molecular weight, such as polysaccharides, were not included in this study. The names of compounds were standardised through SciFinder (https://scifinder.cas.org) according to the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number. Additionally, these compounds' PubChem CIDs were obtained from PubChem (https:// pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) based on chemical names or structures. The protein targets of compounds from YPF decoction were predicted by similarity ensemble approach (SEA: http://sea.bkslab.org/) 25 , which is a chemical similarity searching-based prediction method recognised worldwide for its accuracy 77, 78 . Though the SEA method is capable of accounting only ~2,800 potential active proteins as alternative binding targets, the scale is consistent with the recent recognition of the druggable genome (~3000) [79] [80] [81] . In addition, the limitation of a chemical similarity searching-based prediction method, including the SEA, would be that the prediction is based on the two-dimensional (2D) structure (SMILE information) of compounds, which might produce the same potential targets of the isomeric compounds. Herein, it is not enough to predict solely using SEA or any other chemical similarity searching-based prediction method, when isomeric compound domains in the research. The NP-based study of YPF decoction involved 13 pairs of isomeric compounds in 352 compounds, which would interfere with the result slightly, from a holistic perspective.",

YPF decoction was investigated by using the NP-based method, which integrated the \"multi-targets-multi-pathways-multi-diseases\" relationship into a TPT network and a contribution scoring algorithm. The modules in the TPT network with a similar function, especially coinciding with the already known application of YPF decoction, were inferred from the finding that the protein targets in module 7 were highly associated with the underlying mechanism of YPF decoction, especially those with highest centrality as presented in Table 3 . Additionally, some of these targets have been reported to be relevant to the therapeutic activity that YPF might exert. Herein, the network-based method provided an easier and more reliable strategy for uncovering the potential therapeutic targets of YPF. In short, the proposed TPT network combined with the contribution scoring algorithm could be widely applied in the analysis of traditional medicines/formulas with robust effects in clinical care. And, importantly, the most therapeutically related modules coinciding with their clinical applications have a high chance of being associated with potential mechanisms worthy of further experimental investigation.",
