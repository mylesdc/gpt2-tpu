            "text": "The initial step of retrovirus entry-the interaction between the virus envelope glycoprotein trimer and a cellular receptor-is complex, involving multiple, noncontiguous determinants in both proteins that specify receptor choice, binding affinity and the ability to trigger conformational changes in the viral glycoproteins. Despite the complexity of this interaction, retroviruses have the ability to evolve the structure of their envelope glycoproteins to use a different cellular protein as receptors. The highly homologous subgroup A to E Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Virus (ASLV) glycoproteins belong to the group of class 1 viral fusion proteins with a two-step triggering mechanism that allows experimental access to intermediate structures during the fusion process. We and others have taken advantage of replication-competent ASLVs and exploited genetic selection strategies to force the ASLVs to naturally evolve and acquire envelope glycoprotein mutations to escape the pressure on virus entry and still yield a functional replicating virus. This approach allows for the simultaneous selection of multiple mutations in multiple functional domains of the envelope glycoprotein that may be required to yield a functional virus. Here, we review the ASLV family and experimental system and the reverse engineering approaches used to understand the evolution of ASLV receptor usage.",

Enveloped viruses use one or more viral encoded glycoproteins to mediate the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. This is a thermodynamically favored process but with one or more very high energy barriers. The energy liberated upon conformational changes in the viral glycoproteins is used to overcome the energy barrier(s) (reviewed in [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] ). Several viral fusion glycoproteins have been studied in great detail with structures of the initial viral glycoprotein before the fusion process begins (pre-fusion), and a postfusion viral glycoprotein structure after all conformational changes have occurred. While the viral glycoproteins have very different sequences and molecular architectures, the similarity of the postfusion structures suggests that they all mediate fusion by a similar mechanism.",

            "text": "As mentioned above, most viral fusion proteins require oligomerization and at least one proteolytic cleavage after synthesis to produce a fusion-active protein complex. The subsequent conformation changes needed for fusion are then locked in a metastable form until an appropriate trigger releases the lock. Up until recently, the triggering viral fusion protein conformational changes was thought to occur by two mechanisms. One mechanism uses low pH exposure in an endosomal compartment to induce the conformational changes leading to the extended intermediate form exposing the fusion peptide to the target membrane ( Figure 1 : step 1 to 2). Influenza virus is a well-studied example of this mechanism where the HA1 subunit binds to sialic acid causing the trafficking of the virion to the endosomal compartment, but only low pH exposure causes conformational changes in the fusion protein. In another triggering mechanism, the interaction of the viral fusion protein with a specific cellular receptor protein enables the conformational changes to occur at a neutral pH at the cell surface. Most retroviruses are thought to use this mechanism. However, HIV-1, a complex retrovirus, has broken this neutral pH process into two steps, using first CD4 to trigger an initial but partial conformational change in the envelope glycoproteins that enables the binding of a second receptor, CCR5, to complete the triggering process. More recently, a third mechanism has been described for triggering conformational changes in viral fusion proteins: a two-step process that combines receptor triggered conformational changes at neutral pH followed by a required low pH exposure to complete the fusion process. The Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Virus (ASLV) subgroup A (ASLV(A)) envelope glycoproteins are the most studied example of this two-step mechanism [6] [7] [8] .",

            "text": "The ASLV family has members that lack oncogenes, ALVs, and cause disease from chronic infection and integration often activating an oncogene to cause disease [9, 10] . The ASV members cause an acute disease from carrying an activated oncogene: Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) containing the oncogenic src is a well-studied example. In cultured avian cells, infection by an RSV will result in an obvious morphology change as a result of transformation by src of the infected cells that was developed into an infectious titer assay. However, ALVs often can infect and spread in a culture without obvious morphology changes. The complete family of ASLVs has recently been divided into 11 subgroups, A through K, based on their envelope glycoproteins and receptor usage patterns in susceptible and resistant avian cells, with subgroups A to E ASLVs being the most studied [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . These ALVs have been classified into noncytopathic (subgroups A, C, and E) and cytopathic (subgroups B and D) viruses depending on whether they induced cytotoxicity in cultures avian cells. The ASLV induced cytotoxicity is not fusion of multiple cells to form syncytia, but rather a slowing of cell replication with the rounding and release of dead cells from the matrix. However, we have observed some subgroup C strains causing cytotoxicity in certain avian cells with the length and severity of the cytotoxicity appearing to be correlated with the expression levels of the viral glycoproteins.",

The evolution to use alternative receptors was presumably due to the development of host resistance and/or to expand host range. As with all retroviruses, ASLV viruses initially synthesize their envelope glycoproteins as a precursor polyprotein that forms a trimer. The final maturation step cleaves each polyprotein precursor of the trimer into two glycoproteins: the surface glycoprotein (SU), which contains the major domains that interact with the host receptor, and the transmembrane glycoprotein (TM) that anchors SU to the membrane with a stable, covalent disulfide bond [8, 18] , and is directly involved in the fusion of the viral and host membranes. This cleavage results in the mature, metastable, fusion-active complex, a trimer of SU:TM heterodimers.",

Disulfide bond exchange has been shown to be a critical step in the triggering and/or fusion process of some class 1 viral fusion proteins [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . For viruses that have a CXXC thiol-disulfide exchange motif, for example HTLV-1 and MLV SU glycoproteins, the free Cys of this motif reduces the intersubunit disulfide bond linking the SU and TM glycoproteins: this is an integral step for the fusion process. Other viruses do not have the CXXC motif, for example ASLV Env and Ebola virus GP, and at least some of these viruses appear to retain the intersubunit disulfide bond throughout the fusion process, for example ASLV Env [8, 18] . A recent report by Smith and Cunningham studying the multistep fusion and entry mechanism of ASLV(A) identified at least one Cys residue that formed a reactive Cys-thiolate upon receptor-triggered conformational changes that was required for functional fusion and infection [18] . This Cys-thiolate did not mediate isomerization of the SU-TM disulfide bond as expected: the precise function of this thiolate is still unclear. In addition, the authors present evidence that at least two other Cys residues that formed thiolates after receptor triggering on Env. However, these residues could not be studied further since the mutant protein could not fold. In our recently published study (see below) we mapped the disulfide bond pattern of the pre-fusion form of ASLV(A) Env [36] . There are 19 Cys residues in ASLV(A) Env; one residue must be free ( Figure 3 ). The second Cys residue was found to be free. Interestingly, the same Cys residue that forms the thiolate required for fusion and infection. Since all 19 cysteine residues are conserved between subgroup A to E envelope glycoproteins, we are assuming that the disulfides bonds determined using a subgroup A glycoprotein are also conserved for the other subgroups.

For viruses that have a CXXC thiol-disulfide exchange motif, for example HTLV-1 and MLV SU glycoproteins, the free Cys of this motif reduces the intersubunit disulfide bond linking the SU and TM glycoproteins: this is an integral step for the fusion process. Other viruses do not have the CXXC motif, for example ASLV Env and Ebola virus GP, and at least some of these viruses appear to retain the intersubunit disulfide bond throughout the fusion process, for example ASLV Env [8, 18] . A recent report by Smith and Cunningham studying the multistep fusion and entry mechanism of ASLV(A) identified at least one Cys residue that formed a reactive Cys-thiolate upon receptor-triggered conformational changes that was required for functional fusion and infection [18] . This Cys-thiolate did not mediate isomerization of the SU-TM disulfide bond as expected: the precise function of this thiolate is still unclear. In addition, the authors present evidence that at least two other Cys residues that formed thiolates after receptor triggering on Env. However, these residues could not be studied further since the mutant protein could not fold. In our recently published study (see below) we mapped the disulfide bond pattern of the pre-fusion form of ASLV(A) Env [36] . There are 19 Cys residues in ASLV(A) Env; one residue must be free ( Figure 3 ). The second Cys residue was found to be free. Interestingly, the same Cys residue that forms the thiolate required for fusion and infection. Since all 19 cysteine residues are conserved between subgroup A to E envelope glycoproteins, we are assuming that the disulfides bonds determined using a subgroup A glycoprotein are also conserved for the other subgroups. Shown are the disulfide bonds determined using a His-tagged, secreted form of the RCASBP(A) envelope glycoprotein expressed using chicken DF-1 cells and purified. The bonds to C11 and C12 (indicated with a box) could not be assigned further. The free cysteine is labeled C2. The N-linked glycosylation sites actually containing carbohydrate are marked in blue.

A 15-residue region in CRD1, extending from residues 32 to 46, was reported to contain the critical determinants for efficient interaction with subgroups B and D ASLVs. Specifically, residues L36, Q37, L41, and Y42 were critical for high binding affinity and efficient entry, and the disulfide bond was not required. Subgroup E ASLVs, in contrast, required Tvb residues in both CRD1 and CRD2 for efficient virus binding and entry, including intact disulfide bonds and residues Y67, N72, and D73. The Tvb S3 protein contains the C62S substitution, which presumably alters the structure of the CRD2 domain, eliminating binding of ASLV(E) but having no effect on ASLV(B) and ASLV(D) binding and virus entry. More recently, the Cys125S substitution in CRD3 of Tvb S1 was shown to significantly reduce the binding affinity of the mutant receptor for all three ASLV subgroups, B, D, Tva proteins are related to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) and are receptors for ASLV(A) [37, 38] .

Initial studies identified the carboxyl-terminal half of this 40-amino acid region was required for ASLV(A) receptor function. Three residues in the protein loop formed by the C4-C6 disulfide bond, Asp46, Glu47 and Trp48, as well as several other residues in the carboxy-terminal half of the LDLR domain were identified as critical for the efficient interaction of the quail Tva receptor and the ASLV(A) glycoproteins in a variety of assays [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . It was initially thought that since the chicken Tva receptor was identical to quail Tva in this carboxy-terminal half, that chicken Tva interactions with ASLV(A) glycoproteins would be similar. However, a genetic evolution experimental system selected ASLV(A) variants with mutations in the envelope glycoproteins that could now preferentially use the chicken Tva receptor with high binding affinity and infection efficiency but not the quail Tva homolog [22, 23, 45] . Several critical residues in the amino-terminal half of Tva were found to account for this preference: residues at positions 11, 14, and 31 [46] .",

Specifically, residues L36, Q37, L41, and Y42 were critical for high binding affinity and efficient entry, and the disulfide bond was not required. Subgroup E ASLVs, in contrast, required Tvb residues in both CRD1 and CRD2 for efficient virus binding and entry, including intact disulfide bonds and residues Y67, N72, and D73. The Tvb S3 protein contains the C62S substitution, which presumably alters the structure of the CRD2 domain, eliminating binding of ASLV(E) but having no effect on ASLV(B) and ASLV(D) binding and virus entry. More recently, the Cys125S substitution in CRD3 of Tvb S1 was shown to significantly reduce the binding affinity of the mutant receptor for all three ASLV subgroups, B, D, and E. This was the first demonstration of a possible role of CRD3 in Tvb function as an ASLV receptor [52] .",

Expressing the SU and receptor extracellular domains fused to a region of an IgG, immunoadhesins, resulted in the production of soluble, secreted biologically active proteins with high stability from host chicken cells, the DF-1 fibroblast cell line ( Figure 5 ). The IgG domain also enabled the use of a wide range of standard detection reagents, and well-established IgG purification protocols could be adapted for immunadhesin purification. For our studies we have consistently fused SU to a rabbit IgG (rIgG) and fused the extracellular domain of ASLV receptors to a mouse IgG (mIgG). In this way, a functional assay for SU:receptor interactions was developed that could coimmunoprecipitate the interacting proteins with either an anti-mIgG or an anti-rIgG sera. We have approached the definition of ASLV entry mechanisms by keeping as close to physiological conditions for ASLV replication as possible in vitro: avian cells in which the receptors, viral proteins, and secreted immunoadhesins are synthesized and post-translationally modified as the wild type proteins, and expressed on the cell surface at wild type levels. The ASLV SU and receptor immunoadhesins have provided valuable tools for studying the mechanisms of retroviral entry including the identification of functional interaction determinants of SU and receptor for efficient virus entry [22, 23, 45, 53, 57, 60] . Finally, the receptor-mIgG immunoadhesins can trigger conformational changes in the mature ASLV Env trimers indistinguishable from a natural, membrane-bound receptor. ",

In addition, the C-terminal region of SU glycoprotein and the extracellular region of the TM glycoprotein were nearly identical across the subgroup A-E ASLVs ( Figure 2 ). Therefore, RCAS vectors with other envelope glycoprotein subgroups were then constructed by only replacing the env gene segment containing the RCAS(A) SU hypervariable regions with the corresponding segment of another ASLV subgroup. For example, the subgroup B SU hypervariable region from RAV-2 was used to create RCAS(B), while the same SU region of subgroup C Prague C RSV was used to create RCAS(C), but the remaining glycoprotein sequence is from the SR-A isolate.",

            "text": "Subgroup A to E ASLV envelope glycoproteins belong to a group of class 1 viral fusion proteins with a two-step triggering mechanism that will allow experimental access to intermediate structures during the fusion process [6] [7] [8] [66] [67] [68] . ASLV Env glycoproteins, as all retroviral glycoproteins, are initially synthesized as a polyprotein precursor with three precursor proteins oligomerizing to form a trimer. The final maturation step cleaves each polyprotein precursor of the trimer into the SU glycoprotein which contains the major domains that interact with the host receptor, and the TM glycoprotein that anchors SU to the membrane and is directly involved in the fusion of the viral and host membranes. ASLVs have an internal fusion peptide (F) flanked by Cys residues in a disulfide bond that forms a loop. This cleavage results in the mature, metastable, fusion-active complex (Figure 7 , step 1 to 2). As with other mature viral fusion proteins, the mature ASLV Env glycoproteins are locked in a metastable conformation. Experimentally, the requirement for receptor triggering followed by low pH exposure to form the 6HB intermediate can be circumvented by treatment of the mature, metastable Env with a strong denaturant like high heat (>55 \u2022 C) (see Figure 7A ). Presumably, this complex is then transported into an endocytic compartment and upon exposure to low pH, the ASLV extended or partially collapsed fusion intermediates fold into a sixhelix bundle (6HB) conformation, bringing the viral and target membranes into close proximity. The viral and target membranes are brought into close proximity when the HR2 repeats (N, orange domains) fold back into the grooves formed by the HR1 repeats (C, grey domains), forming presumably the most stable TM structure, the six-helix bundle (6HB), and allowing the initial mixing of the outer lipid leaflets (hemifusion) (Figure 7, step 3 to 4) . At 4 \u00b0C, only partial lipid mixing is possible (restricted hemifusion). The formation of the 6HB can be blocked by addition of the R99 peptide, a C-helix inhibitory peptide that binds to the N-helix blocking complete folding [69] . Upon low pH exposure, the receptor triggered ASLV glycoproteins fold back to form the stable SDSresistant six helix bundle TM oligomer. TM oligomers in the 6HB form can be assayed using Western immunoblots with an anti-TM serum under defined SDS conditions demonstrating the requirement for physiological temperatures, first receptor triggering and followed by low pH exposure ( Figure  7D ). Addition of the inhibitory peptide R99 blocks the formation of the 6HB, thus the SDS-resistant TM oligomers are not detected. ASLV Env glycoproteins have a stable, covalent disulfide bond linking the SU and TM subunits of each heterodimer: published data predicts the ASLV SU subunits to be bound to TM throughout the fusion process. Upon interaction of SU with an appropriate receptor protein, Tva for ASLV(A), Env undergoes conformational changes that result in the formation of an extended fusion intermediate that exposes the internal fusion peptide region for interaction with the target membrane (Figure 7 , step 2 to 3). The triggering of the ASLV viral glycoprotein trimer upon receptor binding results in a conformational change in the SU glycoprotein that presumably separates the SU domains to allow the TM glycoproteins to form an extended structure projecting the internal fusion peptide (FP) toward the host cell membrane. Two domains in TM, HR1, the N-terminal heptad repeat (N, orange domain), and HR2, the C-terminal heptad repeat (C, grey domain), are critical for the formation of the extended structure. The fusion peptide is thought to interact with the target membrane irreversibly, forming an extended prehairpin TM oligomer structure anchored in both the viral and target membranes. The cooperation of several of these extended TM oligomers is thought to be necessary to complete the fusion process.",

Upon low pH exposure, the receptor triggered ASLV glycoproteins fold back to form the stable SDS-resistant six helix bundle TM oligomer. TM oligomers in the 6HB form can be assayed using Western immunoblots with an anti-TM serum under defined SDS conditions demonstrating the requirement for physiological temperatures, first receptor triggering and followed by low pH exposure ( Figure 7D ). Addition of the inhibitory peptide R99 blocks the formation of the 6HB, thus the SDS-resistant TM oligomers are not detected.",

Interestingly, the Tva, Tvb, and Tvc receptors each contain one or more aromatic residues that are critical determinants for proper interaction with ASLV glycoproteins.

Three types of ASLV envelope glycoprotein variants were selected. One type of acquired mutations that cluster mainly in the hr1 and vr3 hypervariable regions of the SU glycoproteins (summarized in Figure 8 ), and resulted in the loss of receptor specificity leading to expansion of receptor usage: changes in the 2-3 ASLV entry mechanism step of receptor priming/initial trigger of conformation changes ( Figure 6) . A second type of acquired mutations occurred in the C-terminal region of SU and/or the extracellular region of TM glycoproteins (summarized in Figure 9 ), altering the two-step envelope glycoprotein fusion mechanism to circumvent a normal requirement often resulting in a partially activated form of glycoprotein trimer more easily induced to facilitate entry ( Figure 6 ). And finally, there were examples of a combination of both types of mutations needed to overcome a particular evolutionary hurdle. The Schmidt-Ruppin Subgroup A envelope glycoproteins in RCASBP(A) evolve to evade the antiviral effects of quail Tva receptor immunoadhesin. We had shown that receptor immunoadhesins of both the chicken and quail Tva receptor homologs when delivered by an RCAS vector significantly blocked ASLV(A) virus entry both in cultured chicken cells with a >200-fold antiviral effect, and circumvent a normal requirement often resulting in a partially activated form of glycoprotein trimer more easily induced to facilitate entry ( Figure 6 ). And finally, there were examples of a combination of both types of mutations needed to overcome a particular evolutionary hurdle. The Schmidt-Ruppin Subgroup A envelope glycoproteins in RCASBP(A) evolve to evade the antiviral effects of quail Tva receptor immunoadhesin. We had shown that receptor immunoadhesins of both the chicken and quail Tva receptor homologs when delivered by an RCAS vector significantly blocked ASLV(A) virus entry both in cultured chicken cells with a >200-fold antiviral effect, and The Schmidt-Ruppin Subgroup A envelope glycoproteins in RCASBP(A) evolve to evade the antiviral effects of quail Tva receptor immunoadhesin. We had shown that receptor immunoadhesins of both the chicken and quail Tva receptor homologs when delivered by an RCAS vector significantly blocked ASLV(A) virus entry both in cultured chicken cells with a >200-fold antiviral effect, and protected >98% birds from subsequent ASLV(A) challenge [60] . A chicken DF-1 cell line was developed that expressed high levels of the quail sTva-mIgG immunoadhesin that could inhibit infection by ASLV(A) by >15,000-fold. These cells were then challenged with different amounts of RCASBP(A) in an effort to select virus variants that could evade the antiviral effect of the quail sTva-mIgG inhibitor. Three viral variants were selected with mutations in the hr1 hypervariable region of the SU glycoprotein that reduced the binding affinity to the quail sTva-mIgG: Y142N (324-fold), E149K (32-fold), and the Y142N/E149K double mutant (4739-fold) [22] . Unexpectantly, based on our understanding of the Tva receptor at the time, all three mutant glycoproteins retained wild type levels of binding affinity for chicken sTva-mIgG. All three variants infect cells with a chicken Tva receptor at wild type levels but were 10-fold (Y142N), 2-fold (E149K), and 600-fold (Y142N/E149K) less efficient infecting cells expressing the quail Tva receptor. As discussed earlier, these variant glycoproteins that now preferred the chicken Tva receptor over the quail Tva receptor allowed the fine mapping of new determinants in the chicken versus the quail Tva receptor homologs critical for efficient interaction with ASLV(A) glycoproteins and virus entry. Upon analysis with receptor interference assays, these selected glycoprotein mutations may also broaden receptor usage but only when in the presence of the quail sTva-mIgG inhibitor.",

Subsequent challenge of this cell line with RCASBP(A), after a significant delay, selected a variant virus resistant to the SUA-rIgG receptor interference [45] .

The chicks expressing sTvb S3 -mIgG were significantly and specifically resistant to a challenge with subgroup B wild type RAV-2 virus but not subgroup C RAV-49 virus: 15 of 17 birds (88%) challenged with RAV-2 did not produce detectable subgroup B ASLV; 100% of birds challenged with RAV-49 produced subgroup C ASLV. The subgroup B ALV env gene populations in the two positive RAV-2 challenged birds were cloned and sequenced to determine if a resistant virus was selected. One of the birds, 6590, only contained wild type RAV-2 env genes and expressed the lowest level of sTvb S3 -mIgG likely indicating incomplete delivery and expression of the immunoadhesin throughout the bird allowing some subgroup B virus replication. The second bird, 6620, contained a mixture of RAV-2 and RAV-2/SR-A recombinant env genes from recombination between the RCASBP(A) and RAV-2 env genes. Interestingly, RAV-2 acquired much of the C-terminal SU and N-terminal TM region of the SR-A env gene, a construct very similar to the RCASBP(B) vector with RAV-2 SU variable regions fused to the rest of the SR-A env gene. We further characterized several molecular clones including clone 6620-17, that contained the recombination plus additional mutations in the SU glycoprotein: R196K and Y201N in the region between hr1 and hr2; and a 27 bp duplication encoding a 9-amino acid duplication in the RAV-2 hr2 variable region. However, none of the representative variant viruses with env genes found in bird 6620, including 6620-17, which were resistant to sTvb S3 -mIgG inhibition.",

Indeed, there are only eight amino acid differences between the RCASBP(B) and RCASBP(RAV2) viruses to account for the inability of RCASBP(RAV2) to escape sTvb S3 -mIgG inhibition: five differences in the C-terminal region of SU (2 nonconserved changes) and three differences in TM (2 nonconserved changes). The analysis of the biochemical properties of the RCASBP(B) and RCASBP(RAV2) envelope glycoprotein trimers demonstrate fundamental differences between the two glycoproteins in their ability to execute virus entry with the two-step mechanism of ASLV fusion process [64] . The mature RCASBP(B) glycoproteins appear to be more stable compared to the RCASBP(RAV2) glycoproteins upon conformation change triggered by heat with significant levels of triggered RCASBP(RAV2) glycoproteins occurring at low temperatures. In addition, the RCASBP(RAV2) glycoproteins did not appear to require a subsequent exposure to low-pH after receptor induced conformational changes as would be expected and is observed with RCASBP(B) glycoproteins. Changing the four conserved amino acid differences converted the RCASBP(RAV2) glycoprotein properties to RCASBP(B) glycoproteins, and vice versa. This indicates that mutations altering the two-step entry fusion mechanism of ASLV provides another evolutionary escape mechanism perhaps independent of hypervariable mutations in the SU glycoprotein that alters receptor-glycoprotein interactions.",

Despite ASLVs only infecting avian species naturally, Jan Svoboda's group had shown that ASLVs could be used to infect hamsters and rats experimentally with RSVs and used these infected transformed cells to study the RSV life cycle [74] [75] [76] . Recently, they investigated the mutations acquired by the Prague C RSV env gene that allowed the entry into rodent cells: first by infecting newly born rats with PrC-RSV infected chicken tissue and generating the XC-RSV cell line; followed by XC-RSV rescued from the rat cell line used to infect newly born hamsters and generating the H20-RSV hamster cell line [77] . Eight amino acid substitutions were found in the H20-RSV env gene sequence: three mutations near the N-terminus of the SU glycoprotein, two mutations in the C-terminus of SU, and three mutations in the TM glycoprotein. Unexpectantly, there were no mutations in the SU glycoprotein hr1, hr2, or vr3 hypervariable regions critical for receptor specificity and host range. Upon analysis, the key mutations that allowed the expanded host range were identified as the mutations in the TM glycoprotein, especially the L378S mutation in the fusion peptide. Biochemical characterization determined that the L378S mutation altered the H20-RSV envelope glycoprotein trimers to no longer require a receptor to prime the initial triggering of the SU conformational changes: the H20-RSV glycoprotein trimer could be induced to form TM oligomers most efficiently with low pH exposure alone even at room temperature. The ability to infect mammalian cells was transferred to a subgroup B ALV by constructing a RCASBP(B) vector but with the H20-RSV TM glycoprotein. Thus, they concluded the H20-RSV virus was able to extend its host range to mammalian cells due to the pre-activation of the mutant glycoproteins and not to the use of a new mammalian cell surface protein as a receptor.",

The unusual two-step entry fusion process of ASLV allows a detailed biochemical dissection of the entry steps not possible with other enveloped viruses. Replication-competent ASLV viruses, and the RCAS series of vectors based on them, have enabled the use of genetic selection strategies to pressure the virus to evolve the envelope glycoproteins to alter receptor binding affinity, receptor usage including mutations that expand their host range. In this way, the virus has naturally identified multiple residues/regions of the envelope glycoprotein important for productive viral glycoprotein receptor interactions as well as provided insights into the subsequent conformation changes in the trimer required for the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes.",
