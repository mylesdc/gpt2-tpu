DCs express a wide range of receptors for the recognition of conserved pathogen patterns as well as the induction of subsequent immune responses. Some Toll like receptors (TLRs) are expressed on the cell surface (TLR-1, TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-5, TLR-6, TLR-10) while some are located within intracellular compartments (TLR-3, TLR-7, TLR-8, TLR-9) [9] . They are differentially expressed in different DC subsets and are modulated in response to a variety of stimuli [10, 11] . Viral proteins may bind to TLR-2 or TLR-4, single stranded RNA binds to TLR-7 and TLR-8, and double stranded RNA binds TLR-3 while viral DNA binds to TLR-9. The binding of ligands to TLRs may trigger downstream signaling pathways that are involved in both the cytokine release during the primary induction of inflammation and secondary activation of anti-inflammatory mechanisms [12] . Cross talks between TLRs are common and the formation of TLR heterodimers allows a higher level of complexity in ligand-receptor binding and subsequent signaling.",

Differential expressions of CCRs are observed during DC maturation [13, 14] and some viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), can block CCR expressions on DCs to alter their migratory properties [15] . There are redundancies in the chemokines and CCRs interactions as many different ligands bind the same receptor and many receptors bind the same ligand. For example, RANTES binds to CCR-1, CCR-3 and CCR-5, while MIP-1\u03b1 also binds to CCR-1 and CCR-5 [16] . We determined if the expression of these receptors on DCs are altered by SARS-CoV and contribute to autocrine regulation of DC migration.",

Viral infections, by RSV or influenza A, have been shown to upregulate TLR-3 and TLR-4 expression in host airway epithelial cells, leading to increased signalling activity and proinflammatory cytokine production [23] . More recently, TLR-4 was shown to be upregulated in mice with acid-induced or inactivated avian influenza-induced lung injuries; and TLR-4 deficient mice showed less severe acute lung injuries to these challenges [24] . We, therefore, determined if SARS-CoV may modulate the TLRs expression on DCs. In this study, there was no induction nor suppression of TLRs in SARS-CoV infected DCs (Figs. 1  &2) . The variations between samples were high, but the expression levels of some extracellular TLRs (TLR-1, TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-5) and some intracellular TLRs (TLR-7, TLR-8) in CB DCs were higher than that in adult DCs (Table  1 ).

The authors demonstrated that SARS-CoV also induced a strong Type I interferon response in human pDCs and proposed that TLR7 may play a similar role in SARS-CoV infection. Another group developed a recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) that was lethal in BALB/c mice and demonstrated that MyD88 played an important role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis [27] .

It is strongly upregulated in herpesvirus infected T cells [31] , EBV infected B cells [32] and mature DCs [14] . In addition, microarray analysis of PBMC infected with SARS-CoV have shown an upregulation of CCR7 [33] . In this study, we only detected a slight but insignificant change in CCR-7 expression in adult SARS-CoV infected DCs (Fig. 3) . This observation is consistent with previous findings that SARS-CoV did not stimulate DC maturation [8, 34] . However, this is in contrary to observations made by others [35, 36] . We speculate as these immature DCs migrate to the lymph nodes, they may act as regulatory DCs which are less effective for the activation of allogeneic CD4+ T cells than normal DCs [37] or they may drive the development of regulatory T cells [38] . These SARS-CoV-driven regulatory immature DCs may facilitate the immune evasion of SARS-CoV [39] .",

Based on the function of chemokines on cell trafficking, more severe infiltration of cells to the lungs would be expected in children. On the contrary, SARS was less severe in children than adults [3, 4] . The age-dependency of disease severity in SARS merits further studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The development of animal models for SARS has been difficult because relevant signs of clinical illness and death cannot be reproducible in most animal models [40] . Recently, aged BALB/ c mice have shown to develop more severe disease after SARS infection [41] and have lower vaccine efficacy than young mice [42] . The comparison of SARS-CoV infected senescent mice with adult mice can be extended to younger mice and knock out models for the study of agedependency in the pathogenesis of SARS. A recent study has shown that mice deficient in either CCR1, CCR2 or CCR5 exhibited more prominent airway epithelial cell apoptosis and more severe lung pathology. This suggests that CCRs may be playing different roles at the site of infection and in the trafficking of immune cells [27] .",

Similarly, SARS-CoV infected DC also showed a \"killer DC' phenotype with high expression of TRAIL (Fig. 4) . Comparing the two studies, the level of TRAIL expression in SARS-CoV infected adult DCs (~300 copies/10 4 \u03b2 actin genes) was lower than that in H5N1 infected adult macrophages (~1800 copies/10 4 \u03b2 actin genes). TRAIL expression in SARS-CoV infected CB DCs was the highest (~5000 copies/10 4 \u03b2 actin genes). Further investigation is needed to confirm the cytotoxic function of SARS-CoV infected DCs on immune cells. Based on the possible DC migration induced by chemokines and the role of TRAIL in inducing lymphocyte apoptosis, our findings may explain the white pulp atrophy in the spleen and lymphoid depletion in lymph nodes of SARS patients. The mechanism involved in children may be more complicated and it is important to determine if the CB DCs are functionally immature in spite of the high expression of chemokines, CCRs and TRAIL. More recently, TRAIL expression is also reported to be upregulated after the binding of HIV to TLR-7 [44] or activation of TLR-8 [45] . Hence the high TRAIL expression in SARS-infected CB DCs may also be related to their TLR-8 expression.",

Mock infected cells were included as negative control. The concentrations were normalised to those of \u03b2-actin mRNA in the corresponding sample. In SARS-CoV infected adult DCs, significant upregulations of CCR-1, CCR-3 and CCR-5 were detected. In the CBDCs, only upregulation of CCR-3 was detected. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM (adult n = 7; CB n = 5). Ligand gene expression in SARS-CoV infected human immature DCs by quantitative RT-PCR Figure 4 Death Receptor Ligand gene expression in SARS-CoV infected human immature DCs by quantitative RT-PCR. Death receptor ligands, FasL and TRAIL, mRNA concentrations in adult (a) and CB (b) immature DCs were assayed at 3 h and 9 h after infection with SARS-CoV (MOI = 1). Mock infected cells were included as negative control. The concentrations were normalised to those of \u03b2-actin mRNA in the corresponding sample. In both SARS-CoV infected adult DCs and CB DCs, significant upregulation of FasL mRNA was not detected. However, there was significant upregulation of TRAIL gene expression. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM (adult n = 7; CB n = 5).",
