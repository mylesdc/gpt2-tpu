Studies have suggested that the excessive activation of the innate immunity by IFV is responsible for severe pathologies. In this study, we focused on CARD9, a signaling adaptor known to regulate innate immune activation through multiple innate sensor proteins, and investigated its role in anti-IFV defense and lung pathogenesis in a mouse model recapitulating severe influenza pneumonia with ARDS. We found that influenza pneumonia was dramatically attenuated in Card9-deficient mice, which showed improved mortality with reduced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the infected lungs. However, viral clearance, type-I interferon production, and the development of antiviral B and T cell immunity were not compromised by CARD9 deficiency. Syk or CARD9-deficient DCs but not macrophages showed impaired cytokine but not type-I interferon production in response to IFV in vitro, indicating a possible role for the Syk-CARD9 pathway in DCs in excessive inflammation of IFV-infected lungs. Therefore, inhibition of this pathway is an ideal therapeutic target for severe influenza pneumonia without affecting viral clearance.",

The CLR dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), which has a cytoplasmic ITAM-like sequence, was shown to bind influenza virus A 23, 24 . Additionally, CARD9 was found to be required for the production of inflammatory cytokines after infection with RNA viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus, by regulating NF-\u03ba B signaling through RIG-I and Mda5 21 .

We observed that PR8-infected WT mice appeared visibly ill with ruffled fur and reduced oral intake during the 6 to 10 days after infection, whereas Card9 -/mice appeared more active than WT mice. Consistent with their activity, the final survival rate up to day 21 after infection was dramatically improved in Card9 -/mice (~80%) as compared with WT mice (~40%; Fig. 1A ).

Consistent with the pathological data, the number of CD45 + BALF cells were significantly fewer in the lungs of Card9 \u2212/\u2212 mice than in those of WT mice on day 8, with a marked decrease in the numbers of T cells and neutrophils ( Fig. 1C ) that were the two main infiltrated subpopulations at this time point (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). However, the numbers of B cells, NK cells, macrophages, cDCs, and pDCs were not significantly affected by the CARD9 deficiency. The BALF levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, i.e., IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 , CCL3/MIP-1\u03b1 , CXCL1/KC, and CXCL10/IP-10, which have been reported to contribute to lung pathology 10, 13, 14 , peaked on day 4 and were considerably lower in the Card9 \u2212/\u2212 mice than in the WT mice (Fig. 1D ). However, no reduction in cytokine/chemokine levels was evident on day 8, indicating that a CARD9-mediated innate response controls cytokine/chemokine production at an early time point after IFV infection and influences subsequent inflammatory cell recruitment and lung pathology at a later time point. Collectively, the loss of CARD9 attenuated severe influenza pneumonia and improved host mortality.",

To evaluate the impact of CARD9 deficiency on anti-IFV protection, we first analyzed the viral burden in the IFV-infected lungs of WT and Card9 -/mice. Notably, we found that CARD9 deficiency did not increase virus titers and the amount of viral RNA in the lungs, but instead significantly accelerated viral clearance in the later stage (day 8) of infection ( Fig. 2A) . Type-I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 /\u03b2 ) are the primary factors that induce host resistance to IFV 26, 27 . In contrast to cytokine/chemokine production, CARD9 deficiency did not significantly affect IFN-\u03b1 /\u03b2 production in IFV-infected lungs (Fig. 2B) . The type II interferon IFN-\u03b3 is not essential for viral clearance 28 , but its presence during IFV infection ameliorates the severity of inflammation and lung injury 29 . IFN-\u03b3 production was significantly more in the lungs of Card9 \u2212/\u2212 mice than in those of WT mice on day 8 but not on day 4 (Fig. 2B) ; thus, this increase might contribute to the improvement of lung pathology in Card9 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Moreover, the expression of IP-10 encoded by an IFN-responsive gene was significantly impaired in Card9 \u2212/\u2212 mice on day 4 (Fig. 1D) , albeit no significant reduction was seen in either Type I or Type II interferons, suggesting that synergistic signals of interferons and various cytokines/chemokines are required for the higher expression of IP-10 at an early phase of infection. Next, we examined the induction of virus-specific CD8 + T cells using the H-2D b tetramer coupled with a viral nuclear protein (NP)-derived peptide (NP 366-374 ) 30, 31 . The percentages of NP-specific CD8 + T cells in the draining lymph nodes of the lungs on day 8 were comparable between WT and Card9 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2C) .",

We found that CARD9 deficiency did not alter viral clearance after the challenge (Fig. 2D ). Next, we assessed the induction of humoral and cellular acquired immunity to IFV in Card9 -/mice. We re-infected WT and Card9 -/mice on day 21 after their first infection (representing the second infection) and analyzed the production of virus-specific antibodies as well as the development of virus-specific CD8 + T cells on day 14 after the second infection. We found that the CARD9 deficiency affected neither the production of virus-specific IgG in the serum nor virus-specific IgA in the lung mucosa (Fig. 2E) . Additionally, CARD9 deficiency did not affect the IFN-\u03b3 response by splenic CD8 + T cells specific to a NP antigen epitope NP 366-374 (Fig. 2F) . Collectively, the CARD9 pathway is dispensable for the induction of protective immunity against both the primary and secondary IFV infections, and its deficiency even improves primary viral clearance upon lethal-dose infections probably because of improvement in lung damage and elevated IFN-\u03b3 production.",

            "text": "CARD9 deficiency impairs inflammatory cytokine, but not type-I interferon, production by DCs. Because macrophages and DCs are known to be an early source of inflammatory cytokines and type-I interferons in pulmonary IFV infection 13,14 , we examined whether CARD9 was required for their production by myeloid cells in response to IFV. Thioglycolate-induced peritoneal macrophages (TG-MFs), bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMFs), alveolar macrophages (AMFs), conventional DCs (cDCs), or Flt3 ligand-induced plasmacytoid DCs (FLT3L-DCs) prepared from WT or Card9 -/mice were brought into contact with PR8 in vitro and the production of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 , and IFN-\u03b1 /\u03b2 was measured. IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 produced by TG-MFs (Fig. 3A) or BMMFs (Fig. 3B ) and those mRNAs produced by AMFs (Fig. 3C ) in response to PR8 were not affected by CARD9 deficiency. As previously reported 18, 19 , CARD9 was required for a cytokine response to ox-zymosan through Dectin-1-Syk but dispensable for the response to LPS through TLR4-MyD88 in cDCs ( Supplementary Fig. S2A ). We found that Card9 -/-cDCs (Fig. 3D ) or FLT3L-DCs (Fig. 3E ) produced significantly lower levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 than WT cells in response to PR8. In contrast, IFN-\u03b1 /\u03b2 production was not compromised in Card9 -/-cDCs or FLT3L-DCs. These findings suggest that CARD9 deficiency primarily affected DCs but not MFs regarding the production of inflammatory cytokines but not IFN-\u03b1 /\u03b2 in response to IFV. It has been reported that the CARD9-IPS-1 pathway mediates the cytokine response to RNA viruses through RLHs 21 , while CARD9 has been found to transmit signals from myeloid ITAM-coupled receptors via Syk [18] [19] [20] . Thus, we evaluated the contributions of these pathways. IPS-1-deficient (Ips-1 -/-) cDCs and Myd88-deficient (Myd88 -/-) FLT3L-DCs produced significantly lower levels IFN-\u03b1 /\u03b2 than WT cells in response to PR8 (Fig. 3D ,E), consistent with previous findings showing that the IFN-\u03b1 /\u03b2 response to RNA viruses is mediated mainly through RIG-I/IPS-1 in cDCs, and through TLR7/MyD88 in pDCs 32, 33 . In addition, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 production was impaired in Ips-1 -/-cDCs and Myd88 -/-FLT3L-DCs. Lower levels of cytokine production were also observed in Myd88 -/-cDCs, likely due to impaired activation through several TLRs (i.e. TLR3, 7, 8 and 9) that sense virus nucleic acids 34, 35 . We found that inducible Syk-deficient (Syk del/del ) cDCs and FLT3L-DCs produced significantly lower levels of inflammatory cytokines than WT cells similar to the responses of Card9 -/-cDCs and FLT3L-DCs, whereas the Syk deficiency did not affect cytokine production in response to LPS (Supplementary Fig. S2A ). Consistent with these findings, treatment of WT cDCs (Fig. 4A ) and FLT3L-DCs (Fig. 4B) with the Syk inhibitor BAY61-3606 reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines but not type-I interferons in response to PR8 in a dose-dependent manner. The treatment with BAY61-3606 reduced the cytokine response to ox-zymosan but not to LPS, indicating that the effect of the inhibitor on cytokine expression depends on the stimulus but cannot be attributed to its general effect on cytokine gene expression ( Supplementary  Fig. S2B ). Overall, these results suggest that the attenuation of influenza pneumonia by Card9 deficiency was likely attributable to the reduced cytokine/chemokine production by pulmonary DCs through the Syk-CARD9 pathway in response to IFV.",

This pattern of impairment was observed in Ips-1 -/-cDCs, and was consistent with results from previous reports indicating that CARD9 selectively regulates the cytokine response through RIG-I-IPS-I in cDCs 21 . Additionally, we found that Syk del/del and Syk inhibitor-treated cDCs showed the same pattern of impairment as Card9 -/or Ips-1 -/-cDCs. On the other hand, in FLT3L-DCs known to release large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and type-I interferons upon recognition of IFV 32,33 , IPS-1 deficiency affected neither cytokine or type-I interferon responses. However, Syk deficiency in FLT3L-DCs, similar to that in cDCs, resulted in a selective reduction in inflammatory cytokines but not IFN-\u03b1 /\u03b2 . Thus, it is likely that the Syk-CARD9 pathway controls detrimental cytokine production by pulmonary DCs upon acute influenza infection. Alternatively, because CARD9 deficiency impairs cytokine production by DCs following stimulation with several TLR ligands 18 , it may be important to examine whether the Syk-CARD9 pathway is involved in the TLR7-meditated response to IFV.",

            "text": "The involvement of the Syk-CARD9 pathway implies the presence of ITAM-coupled receptors that sense IFV and stimulate cytokine production by DCs. It has been reported that an interaction between DC-SIGN, which possesses an ITAM-like \"hemITAM\" motif, and the carbohydrate of IFV hemagglutinin induces maturation of DCs and promotes endocytosis of the virus 42 , indicating the signal-activating capacity of DC-SIGN upon virus binding. However, it is unclear whether the DC-SIGN hemITAM is capable of transmitting sufficient signals to produce inflammatory cytokines. With regard to other viruses, recognition of the dengue virus by the DAP12-associated CLR CLEC5A results in increased vascular permeability due to the overproduction of TNF-\u03b1 , resulting in fatal outcomes 43 . However, its ability to recognize the IFV remains unknown. Thus, it is worth examining whether these CLRs are involved in the cytokine response to IFV. It is also conceivable that damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), generated due to lung damage by IFV infection, may be ligands for some ITAM-coupled receptors. Indeed, the FcR\u03b3 -associated CLR Mincle was shown to recognize SAP130, a component of the ribonucloprotein released from dead cells 44 .",

Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal administration of sodium pentobarbital at 0, 4, or 8 days after IFV infection. Lung tissues were homogenized using a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec), and the homogenates were serially diluted with cold PBS. For a plaque assay, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (obtained from JCRB cell bank, Osaka, Japan) were plated at 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells in a flat-bottomed 6-well plate (Corning, Corning, NY) a day before infection. Supernatants from lung homogenates serially diluted were used to infect the MDCK cells at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The cells were subsequently overlaid with DMEM (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) mixed with 0.75% noble agar (Difco, Detroit, MI) in the presence of 2 \u03bc g/mL crystallized trypsin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). The plaques were visualized by staining the cells with Methylene Blue (Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan), and the cells were counted 4 days after infection.Scientific RepoRts | 5:17577 | DOI: 10.1038/srep17577",
