            "text": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) cause severe disease in humans. There are no effective vaccines or antiviral therapies currently available to control fatal outbreaks due in part to the lack of understanding of virus-mediated immunopathology. In our study, we used hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 virus to investigate the related signaling pathways and their relationship to dysregulated innate immune reaction. We found the HA of H5N1 avian influenza triggered an abnormal innate immune signalling in the pulmonary epithelial cells, through an unusual process involving activation of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) that is exclusively associated with cc chain and is essential for signaling via all cc cytokine receptors. By using a selective JAK3 inhibitor and JAK3 knockout mice, we have, for the first time, demonstrated the ability to target active JAK3 to counteract injury to the lungs and protect immunocytes from acute hypercytokinemia -induced destruction following the challenge of H5N1 HA in vitro and in vivo. On the basis of the present data, it appears that the efficacy of selective JAK3 inhibition is likely based on its ability to block multiple cytokines and protect against a superinflammatory response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) attack. Our findings highlight the potential value of selective JAK3 inhibitor in treating the fatal immunopathology caused by H5N1 challenge.",

One among multiple subtypes of influenza virus A, H5N1 viruses have caused 520 laboratory-confirmed infections in 15 countries, 307 of which were fatal, resulting in a fatality rate of approximately 60% since 2003 [2] , which should be considered to have been a potentially serious pandemic threat [3] . Clinical observations indicated that acute lung injury and multiple organ dysfunction were the direct causes of death in H5N1-infected humans [4] [5] . Laboratory findings revealed low peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts and high chemokine and cytokine levels in H5N1-infected individuals, particularly in those who died. Levels of IP-10, MIG and MCP-1 (chemoattractants of monocytes and macrophages that are produced in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages [6] [7] [8] ) were elevated in patients with avian and human subtypes of influenza but were higher in H5N1-infected individuals and particularly high in those who died [6] . Levels of the neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin (IL)-8 were also elevated in H5N1infected individuals, particularly in those who died [6] . The IL-8 chemokine is produced by bronchial epithelial cells and may function in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [9] , which may be particularly relevant to H5N1 influenza, as progression to respiratory failure is associated with the development of ARDS [10] [11] . The clinical and pathological features in H5N1-infected humans and animal models suggest that high levels of viral replication combined with early robust host responses play a key role in pneumonia severity and outcome [6, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

Increasing evidence points to a key role of the innate immune system with its pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in both infectious and non-infectious lung diseases, acute lung injury, pneumoconiosis and asthma [17] . Of PRRs, the wellknown Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed in alveolar macrophages, lung epithelial cells and in intraepithelial dendritic cells (DCs), which are either located at the cell surface or in endosomal membranes. These cells respond to infections by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and respond to endogenous molecules (danger-associated molecular patterns [DAMPs] ) that are released after tissue damage [17] [18] . The TLRs recruit different adapter molecules and initiate signalling pathways leading to the activation of NF-kB-dependent proinflammatory gene expression and/or to IRF3/7-mediated type I interferon (IFNa/b) expression [18] [19] . An analysis of sections from the human respiratory tract demonstrated that H5N1 attached to the apical cell membrane of bronchiolar cells, type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages [20] . Therefore, activation of TLRs expressed in type II pneumocytes could help mediate the response to H5N1 viruses [21] , contributing to the promotion of a destructive host immunity [22] [23] [24] . Although neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in treating avian influenza, especially if given within 48 h of infection, it is more difficult to prevent the resultant hypercytokinemia from developing if the patient does not seek timely medical assistance.",

We have demonstrated that challenging respiratory epithelial cells with H5N1 HA exploited the JAK2/3/STAT1 and NF-kB signalling axis and resulted in a large release of cytokines, initiating a destructive innate immune response at early stages. Additionally, we found that a selective JAK3 inhibitor (JAK3inh) targeted to the key signal molecule in the inflammatory signal cascades has potential roles in the treatment of the inflammatory disorders, thereby protecting against a superinflammatory response to PAMPs attack.",

Additionally, NF-kB dimers bind to kB sites within the promoter of the IP10 gene [30] . We therefore examined the transcription of IP-10 and IRF-1 genes in the HA-challenged A549 cells. As expected, our results showed an increased transcriptional induction of both genes following HA exposure ( Figure 2B ).

We therefore examined if targeting JAK3 could block the induction of transcriptional activation of IP-10 and IRF-1 by HA. As shown in Figure 3A , B, we demonstrated the ability of the JAK3 inhibitor VI (Calbiochem) to attenuate the phosphorylation of JAK3 while suppressing active NF-kB ( Figure 3A ) in the A549 cells challenged with HA, thus blocking the induction of IP-10 and IRF-1 gene expression ( Figure 3B ). In addition, we also observed significantly lower levels of cytokines/chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1a, MIP-1b and RANTES, in the HA-stimulated A549 cells following treatment with the JAK3 inhibitor VI compared to those with HA stimulation alone ( Figure 3C ).",

Although alveolar macrophages were originally described as the cell type responsible for pulmonary monocyte recruitment during AIV infection, a recent study by Herold et al. suggests instead that the majority of the recruitment results from alveolar epithelial cells that produce high levels of CCL2 (MCP-1), a ligand for CCR2, following infection [33] . This result is in agreement with our findings that show activation of JAK/STAT and NF-kB signalling pathways in pulmonary epithelial cells upon challenge with HA of H5N1 (Figure 2A) , leading to rapid induction of the IP-10 and IRF-1 genes ( Figure 2B ). In addition, high levels of cytokines/chemokines were produced ( Figure 2C ). These data may represent a mechanism whereby virus antigenic challenge of alveolar epithelial cells constitutes an initiating event for the development of dysregulated innate immunity. It is worthwhile to point out that HA-triggered signalling events are characterised by an unusual process involved in the phosphorylation of JAK3.",

The expression patterns of Janus kinase 3 contrast sharply with that of other Janus kinases, which are ubiquitously expressed. JAK3 was found to be more limited in its expression and is found in nature killer (NK) cells and in an NK-like cell line but not in resting T cells or in other tissues [35] . In the present study, we have provided evidence that HA treatment immediately caused phosphorylation of JAK2/3 and STAT1/NF-kB in A549 cells (Figure 2A) and mediated the release of cytokines/chemokines ( Figure 2C) , whereas targeting to JAK3 can turn off the signal transduction cascades (Figure 3) . Our results suggest that JAK3 is inducible upon activation in type II pneumocytes. Following the activation of H5N1 by HA, pulmonary epithelial cells, which actively express JAK3, acquire the capability for the recruitment of inflammatory monocytederived DC, NK cells and T cells due to significantly increased release of cytokines/chemokines.",

An early onset of lymphopenia with the pronounced elevation of cytokines/ chemokines and apoptotic lymphocytes in the spleen were also observed in patients infected with H5N1 influenza virus, especially those with a severe infection [28] .

Next, pFastBacHT-H5HA was transposited in combination with a baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid) into MAX Efficiency DH10Bac competent cells by homologous recombination. As predicted, the Bacmid/HA recombinant was identified by PCR amplification of a 4.1 KB DNA fragment (Figure 1Aa) following recombination. Using nickel affinity magnet beads, the recombinant HA (64 KDa) of H5N1 was purified from SF9 cells transfected with Bacmid-H5HA and ",

All mice were housed at a constant temperature (20uC) with a 12-hour light/dark photoperiod and allowed food and water ad libitum. The mice were 6 to 8 weeks of age and weighed between 20 and 30 grams. All animal experiments were carried out according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Bioethics Committee of State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Medical University (Approval ID: 2010-12). Briefly, wild-type or Jak3 knockout mice were randomly divided into two groups (n = 5 in each). After they were anaesthetised with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg), the mice were intratracheally inoculated with 90 mg of HA diluted with 100 ml phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). The control group received an equal volume of sterilised saline without HA. Lung and spleen tissues from the mice were collected 72 h after HA inoculation and fixed in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for histopathological examination. Figure 6 .
