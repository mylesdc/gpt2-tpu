APMV-1 (Newcastle disease virus) is the only well-characterized serotype, because of the high morbidity, mortality, and economic loss caused by highly virulent strains. Very little is known about the pathogenesis, replication, virulence, and tropism of the other APMV serotypes. Here, this was evaluated for prototypes strains of APMV serotypes 2-9 in cell culture and in chickens and ducks. In cell culture, only APMV-1, -3 and -5 induced syncytium formation. In chicken DF1 cells, APMV-3 replicated with an efficiency approaching that of APMV-1, while APMV-2 and -5 replicated to lower, intermediate titers and the others were much lower. Mean death time (MDT) assay in chicken eggs and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) test in 1-day-old SPF chicks demonstrated that APMV types 2-9 were avirulent. Evaluation of replication in primary neuronal cells in vitro as well as in the brains of 1-day-old chicks showed that, among types 2-9, only APMV-3 was neurotropic, although this virus was not neurovirulent. Following intranasal infection of 1-day-old and 2-week-old chickens, replication of APMV types 2-9 was mostly restricted to the respiratory tract, although APMV-3 was neuroinvasive and neurotropic (but not neurovirulent) and also was found in the spleen. Experimental intranasal infection of 3-week-old mallard ducks with the APMVs did not produce any clinical signs (even for APMV-1) and exhibited restricted viral replication of the APMVs (including APMV-1) to the upper respiratory tract regardless of their isolation source, indicating avirulence of APMV types 1-9 in mallard ducks. The link between the presence of a furin cleavage site in the F protein, syncytium formation, systemic spread, and virulence that has been well-established with APMV-1 pathotypes was not evident with the other APMV serotypes.",

These viruses have been isolated from a great variety of mammalian and avian species around the world. Many members of the family cause important human and animal diseases, while the disease potential of many other members is not known. The family is divided into two subfamilies: Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae. The subfamily Paramyxovirinae comprises five genera: Rubulavirus, Respirovirus, Morbillivirus, Henipavirus, and Avulavirus. Subfamily Pneumovirinae is divided into two genera: Pneumovirus and Metapneumovirus. All paramyxoviruses isolated from avian species are classified into the genus Avulavirus, except avian metapneumoviruses, which are classified in the genus Metapneumovirus. Avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) have been divided into nine different serotypes (APMV 1 to 9) based on Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) and Neuraminidase Inhibition (NI) assays [2] . APMV-1 comprises all strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and has been well characterized because of its economic importance in poultry industry. As an initial step towards characterizing other APMV serotypes, complete genome sequences of one or more representative strains of APMV serotypes 2 to 9 have been determined [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

For members of subfamily Paramyxovirinae, efficient RNA replication requires that the nucleotide (nt) length of the genome is an even multiple of six, known as 'rule of six', reflecting the precise packaging of the polynucleotide in the nucleocapsid [12] . The genomes of APMVs are very similar in organization. All the members contain six genes in the order of 39-N-P-M-F-HN-L-59 with the exception of APMV-6, which contains an additional small hydrophobic protein (SH) gene in its genome. APMVs encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a phosphoprotein (P), a matrix protein (M), a fusion protein (F), a hemagglutininneuraminidase protein (HN), and a large polymerase protein (L). Two additional proteins called, V and W, are produced by RNA editing of the P gene. The F and HN proteins form spike-like projections on the outer surface of the viral envelope and are the neutralizing and protective antigens of NDV. Significant sequence divergence in these two proteins exists among APMV serotypes [6] . The HN protein possesses receptor-binding and neuraminidase activity; whereas, the F protein is directly involved in membrane fusion which is necessary for the entry of the virus. Homotypic interactions between the HN and F proteins are hypothesized to control initiation of the fusion process for most paramyxoviruses [13, 14] . The M protein forms the inner layer of the envelope and plays a key role in assembly by interacting with the HN and F proteins as well as ribonucleocapsid [15, 16] .",

APMV-1 is the only well-characterized serotype, because of the high morbidity, mortality, and economic loss caused by highly virulent strains. NDV isolates vary greatly in their pathogenicity for chickens, ranging from no apparent disease to severe respiratory and neurological disease causing 100% mortality [18] . NDV strains are categorized into three main pathotypes: lentogenic (avirulent), mesogenic (moderately virulent), and velogenic (virulent), based on their pathogenicity in chickens [19] . In contrast, the disease potential of APMV-2 to -9 is not well known because many of these viruses were isolated from birds dying in quarantine, hunter killed, trapped wild birds, apparently healthy poultry or exotic birds [20] . APMV-2 and -3 have been reported to cause significant disease in poultry, whereas the pathogenic potential of APMV-4 to -9 is generally unknown. In general, APMV-2 strains have been isolated from chickens, turkeys and wild birds across the globe and have been found to cause mild respiratory disease, decreases in egg production, and infertility [21] [22] [23] . APMV-3 strains have been isolated from wild and domestic birds and their infections have been associated with encephalitis and high mortality in caged birds [24] . APMV-5 strains have only been isolated from budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) and cause depression, dyspnoea, diarrhea, torticollis, and acute fatal enteritis in immature budgerigars, leading to very high mortality [25] . Infections from APMV-4, -8, and -9 appear to be restricted to ducks and geese. APMV-6 and -7 infections in turkeys cause drops in egg production and induce respiratory disease. There are no reports of isolation of APMV-5, -8 and -9 from poultry [2] . But recent serosurveillance of commercial poultry farms in the U.S. indicated the possible prevalence of all APMV serotypes excluding APMV-5 in chickens [26] . The pathogenicity of APMV-2 and APMV-3 has been studied in experimentally infected chickens [27, 28] . However, replication, pathogenicity, and neurovirulence of APMV serotypes 2 through 9 have not been comprehensively studied. Therefore, we characterized in vitro replication of APMVs (growth kinetics and cytopatic effect in chicken fibroblast cells) and their in vivo replication and tropisms by infecting prototype strains of each serotype in two different ages of chickens (1-day-old and 2-week-old chickens) and 3-week-old ducks. Specifically, neurotropism of APMVs was evaluated in primary chicken neuronal cells and brain tissue of 1-day-old chicks.",

Briefly, for the MDT, a series of 10fold dilutions of infected allantoic fluid (0.1 ml) was inoculated into the allantoic cavities of five 9-day-old eggs per dilution and incubated at 37uC. The eggs were examined once every 8 h for 7 days, and the time of embryo death was recorded. The MDT was determined as mean time (h) for the minimum lethal dose of virus to kill all the inoculated embryos. The criteria for classifying the virulence of NDV isolates are: ,60 h, virulent strains; 60 to 90 h, intermediate virulent strains; and .90 h, avirulent strains. For the ICPI test, 0.05 ml of a 1:10 dilution of fresh infective allantoic fluid for each virus was inoculated into group of 10 1-day-old SPF chicks via the intracerebral route. The birds were observed for clinical symptoms and mortality once every 8 h for a period of 10 days. At each observation, the birds were scored as follows: 0 if normal; 1 if sick; and 2 if dead. The ICPI is the mean of the score per bird per observation over the 8-day period. Highly virulent velogenic viruses give values approaching 2, and avirulent or lentogenic strains give values at or close to 0.

Among serotypes 2-9, APMV-3 was able to replicate well without the addition of allantoic fluid, whereas the presence of APMV-7 and -8 antigens in infected cells was sporadically detected. Replication of the other APMVs was not detected up to 3 dpi. We also examined replication in the neuronal cell cultures by collecting supernatants from the cultures at 12 h intervals and assaying for infectious virus by titration. This confirmed the ability of APMV-3 to replicate in neuronal cells, although its titer was lower than that of neurovirulent APMV-1 strain BC (Fig. 3B) . Titers of BC and APMV-3 in neuronal cells increased gradually and reached 5.5 and 3 log TCID 50 /ml, respectively, at 72 hpi. In contrast, other APMVs, including APMV-1 strain LaSota, were not detected in the supernatants of neuronal cells, indicating their inability to replicate in these cultures of primary chicken neuronal cells.",

Chickens were sacrificed on 3 dpi for 1-day-old chicks and on 4 dpi for 2-week-old chickens, and the following tissues were harvested for quantitative virology: trachea, lungs, spleen, and brain (Fig. 6) . In 1-day-old chicks, APMV-1 strain BC replicated to high titers (.5.0 log 10 TCID 50 /g) in each of the sampled tissues in each of the birds, whereas LaSota replicated in trachea, lung and spleen, but not the brain, and its titers were less than those of BC (Fig. 6A) . APMV-3 replicated to moderate titers (.4.0 log 10 TCID 50 /g) in all of the collected samples, including the brain. However, replication of other APMVs was restricted to the trachea, and their titers were low, ranging from 1.5 to 3 log 10 TCID 50 /g (data for APMV-2 are shown in Fig. 6A ; the other serotypes are not shown). Chicks infected with APMV-1 strain BC began to show clinical signs on 1 dpi and distinctive neurological signs on 2 dpi, whereas chicks infected with other APMVs had no apparent clinical signs during the 3-day post-infection. In 2-week-old chickens, virus replication was more restricted and viral titers were lower compared to 1-day-old chickens (Fig. 6B) . APMV-1 strain BC was able to replicate in all of the collected tissues, but the virus titers in the brains of older birds (2.6 log 10 TCID 50 /g) were much lower than that of 1-day-old chickens (6.5 log 10 TCID 50 /g). APMV-1 strain LaSota replicated in the trachea, lungs, and spleen, but not the brain, as was observed in the 1-day-old chickens. Interestingly, APMV-3 replication was detected only in the trachea and the brain, indicating that it is neutrotropic in these older chickens despite this restricted replication. APMV-2 was also able to replicate in trachea of 2week-old chickens. However, replication of the other APMVs was not detected in any of the harvested tissue samples. Since APMV 2-9 can replicate much better in embryonated chicken eggs than in cell culture [20] , the collected tissue homogenates from this same experiment also were inoculated into 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs to confirm the replication of viruses in various tissues ( Table 2 ; APMV-5 was not assayed because it does not replicate in the allantoic cavity of chicken eggs). This approach with increased sensitivity enabled us to detect replication of all of the tested APMVs in the trachea of most of the birds. In addition, APMV-2, 3, 6, 7, and 9 were detected in the lungs of at least one of the three chickens in each group, and APMV-3 was detected in the spleen of two chickens. Among the tested APMVs, APMV-4 showed the least replication in chickens both in vitro and in vivo ( Fig. 2 and Table 2 ), suggesting that it has a strong host range restriction in chickens. On 10 dpi, none of the APMVs were detected in any of the sampled tissues from any of the birds (not shown). Clinical signs of illnesses in any of the infected groups were not found up to 10 dpi.",

Avirulent APMV-1 strains lack this polybasic site and depend on extracellular protease for cleavage, which in vitro can be supplied by exogenous protease and in vivo is supplied by secretory trypsinlike protease found in the lumen of the respiratory and enteric tracts [20] . Our study showed that APMV-1 strain BC readily forms syncytia in cell culture and replicates more efficiently in vitro than any of the other APMVs, followed by the APMV-1 LaSota strain. Characterization of the CPE of APMV types 2-9 demonstrated that only APMV-3 and -5 induced syncytium formation in infected cells. The cleavage site of APMV-3 (RPRGRQL) lacks the furin motif, and efficient growth and syncytium formation depended on supplementation with exogenous protease, resembling an avirulent APMV-1 strain. The cleavage site of APMV-5 (KRKKRQF) is the only example from APMV2-9 to have a furin motif [6] , and syncytium formation and growth were independent of added protease, resembling a virulent APMV-1 strain. Production of syncytia by APMV-3 and APMV-5 correlated with efficient multicycle replication in cell culture in the case of APMV-3 and a moderate level of replication in cell culture in the case of APMV-5. Although APMV-5 contains the greatest number of basic residues for any of the APMV except for some strains of APMV-1, its replication in DF1 cells was much less efficient compared to APMV-1 and -3. Interestingly, the level of replication of APMV-5 in cell culture was very similar to that of APMV-2, which lacks a furin motif (KPASRQF), does not form Figure 6 .

Thus, for those two viruses (APMV-2 and -5), the growth phenotype in cell culture did not correlate well with the presence or absence of a furin motif in the cleavage sequence. The other APMVs (types 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9) have one or two basic amino acids in their cleavage site sequences and exhibited single cell infection and inefficient replication in vitro. However, only in the case of serotypes 8 and 9 did the addition of exogenous protease increase the efficiency of replication, and the overall level of replication remained very low and syncytia were not observed. Thus, APMV types 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have cleavage sites that seemed similar to those of avirulent APMV-1 strains, but the inclusion of protease had little effect on growth in cell culture.",

We included two well-characterized strains of APMV-1, mesogenic BC and lentogenic LaSota, and compared their pathogenicity with that of APMV serotypes 2-9. This showed that APMV serotypes 2-9 were avirulent by both assays. Of types 2-9, only APMV-3 was associated with embryo death in the MTD assay and disease in the ICPI assay, although these effects were modest and APMV-3 was categorized as avirulent by the standards of these assays. By the MDT assay, the other types (types 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) lacked detectable virulence and thus were less virulent than the well-known avirulent vaccine strain APMV-1 LaSota, and by the ICPI assay these APMVs were equivalent to LaSota in lacking detectable virulence. Thus, possession of a furin cleavage site and the ability to form syncytia by APMV-5 did not correlate with virulence in vivo, nor did the ability of APMV-2 to replicate to moderate titers in cell culture without the addition of trypsin.",

With APMV-1, virus neurotropism depends on the presence of a furin cleavage site, since secretory proteases are unavailable in the brain [37] . The lack of neurotropism of the APMV-1 strain LaSota is consistent with this idea. However, APMV-3 appears to be an exception, since it lacks a furin site and is dependent on added protease in cell culture and thus presumably dependent on secreted protease in vivo, yet it replicated efficiently in the chick brains and neutronal cells in vitro. Interestingly, however, while APMV-3 was clearly neurotropic, it caused no disease or death and thus was not neurovirulent. These findings indicate that the simple paradigm that neurotropism depends on the presence of a furin cleavage site does not hold for APMV-3. Furthermore, it shows that neurotropism by an APMV does not necessarily confer neurovirulence. Our previous study with replacement of the APMV-2 F protein with that of APMV-1 BC suggested an important role for the BC F protein in virus neurotropism, neuroinvasiveness, and neurovirulence in 1-day-old chicks [38] . Based on the generally held model for APMV-1 pathogenesis, it would have been reasonable to suggest that the presence of the furin site in the BC F protein was the major determinant of the observed neurotropism, neuroinvasiveness, and neurovirulence. However, the present study challenges the predominant role for the cleavage site, and suggests that other features of the F protein may be involved in the observed neurotropism, neuroinvasiveness, and neurovirulence. Evaluating the difference in the roles of the F proteins in virus neurotropism versus neurovirulence may provide information on these activities and may help design safer vaccines for neurotropic pathogens.",

Previous study with serologic assays in chickens infected with APMVs demonstrated a good humoral response on 14 dpi [39] . Thus, the birds indeed appeared to be infected even thought the recovery of infectious virus was often sporadic and low. A single APMV type, namely APMV-5, was not detected by virus isolation or by immunohistochemistry in any of the chickens in this study. However, the serologic assay of chickens that had been inoculated with APMV-5 also showed the development of virus specific antibodies detected by virus plaque reduction neutralization assay [39] , suggesting that infection had occurred. This suggests a low level of virus replication in chickens. Thus, although APMV-5 bears a furin cleavage site and can cause 100% mortality in budgerigars [25] , it was completely avirulent and replicated inefficiently in chickens. This is suggestive of a host range difference that was not greatly ameliorated by the presence of a multi-basic cleavage site.",

In addition, the virus has been shown to induce low HI titers in chickens compared to other APMVs, which was taken as evidence of a low level of replication of this virus in chickens [26, 39] . However, we detected replication of APMV-4 in trachea and lungs of infected ducks, indicating its preference to ducks from which this strain had been isolated. moderate multifocal mucosal attenuation, and loss of tracheal alveolar mucous glands.

Each of the APMV serotypes replicated to low-to-moderate titers in the trachea of chickens, with APMV-3 having the highest titers. Among APMV types 2-9, only APMV3 replicated systemically and was neuroinvasive and neurotropic, although not neurovirulent. The sequence of the F protein cleavage site was not a reliable predictor of pathogenicity of APMVs in chickens, indicating incongruity with the well-known APMV-1 paradigm. For example, the systemic replication and neurotropism of APMV-3 is inconsistent with its lack of a furin cleavage site and dependence on exogenous trypsin for replication in cell culture. As another example, several of the APMV serotypes, including types 2, 4, 6, and 7, lacked a furin site, but replication of these viruses in cell culture was not improved by the addition of exogenous trypsin. As yet another example, APMV-5 was the only one of serotypes 2-9 to have a furin site, and yet it replicated to only moderate levels in cell culture, and replication in chickens could be detected only by seroconversion. Thus, the paradigm from studies with APMV-1 that virulence and systemic spread correlates with the presence of a furin site generally was not observed with APMV serotypes 2-9. Reverse genetics for different pathotypes of APMV-1 and for prototype strains of APMV-2, 3, and -7 have been developed and used for studying determinants of virus pathogenesis [38, [43] [44] [45] . Further characterization of virus replication and pathogenicity using reverse genetics will enhance our understanding of overall APMV pathogenesis.",
