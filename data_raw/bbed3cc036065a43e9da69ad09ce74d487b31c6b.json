            "text": "In February 2016, the issue of data sharing during emergencies made headlines around the world after leading research funders, academic journals and nongovernmental organizations signed a joint declaration of commitment to rapidly share data relevant to the Zika virus outbreak. 1 This action followed repeated calls from some of the same constituencies for sharing data from clinical trials 2,3 conducted in the context of public health emergencies 4, 5 and public health in general. 6, 7 While the Zika open data initiative is a positive step, it also highlights the shortcomings of calling for knowledge sharing after an outbreak has already begun. To improve epidemic emergency response and to accelerate related research, health authorities in potentially exposed countries must put in place the necessary frameworks for collecting, managing and swiftly making available good-quality, standardized data and for safely securing and sharing biomaterial -such as patient samples -collected during the outbreak.",

            "text": "The 2015 Ebola virus disease outbreak that took the lives of over 11 000 people offers ample lessons on why more knowledge sharing is essential and on how to achieve it. During the Ebola outbreak, massive amounts of data and biomaterials were collected. These included clinical and laboratory data from over 20 000 patients , some enrolled in clinical trials, tens of thousands of patient specimens and over two years' worth of epidemiological data. If appropriate knowledge-sharing frameworks had been in place, these collections could have offered an historic opportunity to expand what is known about Ebola. One framework would guide data standardization, sharing, access and use, including rules on the transfer of agreed data sets into common repositories for curation. Another framework would facilitate cataloguing of biomaterials collected during an outbreak and would establish transpar-ent rules for their management, thereby creating a virtual biobank. For future emergencies, a biobank framework will also need to encompass ethics guidelines for the collection and use of samples, including the provision of appropriate information to patients.",
