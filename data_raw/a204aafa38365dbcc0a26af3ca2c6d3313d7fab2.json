Immunocompromised patients, healthcare workers (HCWs) and children contacts are at increased risk of acquiring the infection. However, the impact of asymptomatic infection in transmission has not been well studied. Objectives: this study evaluated the frequency and viral load (VL) of RSV in nasal swab samples of individuals with different risk factors for acquiring infection in a university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We included 196 symptomatic children and their 192 asymptomatic caregivers, 70 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic HCWs, 43 samples from symptomatic HIV-positive outpatients, and 100 samples of asymptomatic HIV patients in the period of 2009-2013. Results: RSV infection was detected in 10.1% (70/696) of samples, 4.4% (17/387) of asymptomatic patients, and 17.1% (53/309) from symptomatic patients. (P < .0001).",

The close contact with RSV-infected children at home could be an important factor to the increase in the risk of acquiring RSV infection.

Although considering the limitations of our cross-sectional study, mainly the absence of following the patients and the non-differentiation of species A and B, it was demonstrated that the close contact with infected children is an important risk factor for acquiring RSV infection. This risk could be extended to healthcare workers, HIV-positive patients, and visitors of hospitalized patients who have contact with children at home mainly during RSV seasons.Additional studies should be conducted for a better understanding of the clinical significance of asymptomatic RSV infection carriers on nosocomial transmissions during RSV seasons. According to our results, it is important to know if people circulating inside the hospital have close contact with acute respiratory infected children. Indeed, the need to maintain the team of professionals and the public informed about the infection prevention and control measures against the acquisition of infection by respiratory syncytial virus is critical.",
