            "text": "Epitope mapping from affinity-selected peptides has become popular in epitope prediction, and correspondingly many Web-based tools have been developed in recent years. However, the performance of these tools varies in different circumstances. To address this problem, we employed an ensemble approach to incorporate two popular Web tools, MimoPro and Pep-3D-Search, together for taking advantages offered by both methods so as to give users more options for their specific purposes of epitope-peptide mapping. The combined operation of Union finds as many associated peptides as possible from both methods, which increases sensitivity in finding potential epitopic regions on a given antigen surface. The combined operation of Intersection achieves to some extent the mutual verification by the two methods and hence increases the likelihood of locating the genuine epitopic region on a given antigen in relation to the interacting peptides. The Consistency between Intersection and Union is an indirect sufficient condition to assess the likelihood of successful peptide-epitope mapping. On average from 27 tests, the combined operations of PepMapper outperformed either MimoPro or Pep-3D-Search alone. Therefore, PepMapper is another multipurpose mapping tool for epitope prediction from affinity-selected peptides.

Affinity-selected peptides which are derived from phage-display experiments, also known as mimotopes, are assumed to have similar components with the native epitope [9] . Various ways have been proposed to map the mimotopes back to the genuine epitope. These methods were reviewed and compared in some recent literature [10, 11] . In general, they can be categorized as sequence based [12] , motif based [7, 13] , physicochemical properties based [14] , and graph search based [4, 15, 16] methods. Graph search methods are among the most efficient ways in epitope mapping demonstrated in many recent publications [4, 15, 16] because they take advantages of more information provided by using both the 3D structure of a protein than using the traditional amino acid sequence and the information from mimotope set.",

The algorithm used in PepSurf maps the affinity-selected peptides directly back to the protein surface. The most significant alignments are then clustered into a patch, from which the epitope location is inferred. In Mapitope, each peptide is first deconvoluted to amino acid pairs, and those pairs of residues that are significantly overrepresented in the panel of peptides are then identified. Epitopic regions are finally predicted through searching for a cluster of those enriched pairs on the 3D structure of the antigen.",

Furthermore, if more mapping methods can be combined together for exploring as many associated peptides as possible through the mapping, the likelihood of finding a genuine epitopic region on the antigen should be enhanced. On the other hand, users of a mapping tool would prefer to know some sort of certainty about the candidate epitope determined by the associated peptides through the mapping in relation to the likelihood of being a genuine epitope. In other words, some kind of verification on the candidate epitope, if not a confirmation, will be much helpful for the users to make an initial assessment on the quality of the candidate.

Given a 3D structure of an antigen, Pep-3D-Search identifies all the surface residues and creates a surface graph using those residues. An ACO algorithm is then used to search the matched paths on the antigen surface with respect to the query peptides or motif. Each matched path is then rated by its P-value score [4] . A set of highly rated paths are selected to create a weighted graph of resultant paths. The Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm is finally used to screen and cluster this weighted graph to define the candidate epitopes.",

Secondly, each surface patch is further transformed to a graph bounded by neighbor amino acids that are determined using a parameter called adaptive distance threshold (ADT). Afterwards a patch-based complete graph search algorithm is utilized to find the best alignment for each mimotope sequence in each graph.

Firstly, the ADT that is changeable in different regions of a protein is introduced in generating a graph from a surface patch. Such a distance threshold is adjustable so that a longer distance is used in loose regions of an antigen to include more useful connections whereas a shorter distance is adopted in dense regions to preclude some insignificant connections. Secondly, a compactness factor is introduced to make sure that all resultant graphs share a uniform compactness so that searching over any regulated graph is simpler and faster compared with previous methods. Thirdly, the adopted algorithm not only employs dynamic programming (DP) to reduce repeating searches and prune some insignificant paths encountered in the traditional search algorithm, but also introduces the branch and bound method to optimize the candidate set of rated paths during the DP process. The performance of MimoPro assessed by a few comparative studies [16, 18, 19] shows that MimoPro seems to be the most sensitive tool on average among the compared tools.",

Table 2 presents the evaluation results from the two methods run separately. The performances of prediction from MimoPro and Pep-3D-Search varied in different test cases. MimoPro provided some good results on 2ADF_A, 3EZE_B, 1JRH_I, 1BJ1_H, 1N8Z_C and 1ZTX_E with sensitivity exceeding 0.8 and specificity higher than 0.6; meanwhile the worst results were observed in 1YY9_A, 2NY7_G, 2GRX_A, 1D4V_B, 3BT1_A and 1HX1_A with sensitivity approaching to 0. For the rest cases, the sensitivity of prediction was between 0.25 and 0.6 and the specificity is consistently higher than 0.8. Comparatively, Pep-3D-Search gave better results in 1HX1_A and 1D4V_B, in which MimoPro failed to predict any epitopic amino acids. However, Pep-3D-Search failed in 2ADF_A, 1EER_A and 1MQ8_B whereas MimoPro produced useful results. On average, MimoPro gives better results in terms of sensitivity (0.446) and precision (0.267), but slightly worse than Pep-3D-Search in specificity.",

We think that this failure could be attributed to a number of factors, including the quality of the experimental data and the complexity of the predicting tasks. For instance, we found that the mimotope set used for predicting the epitopic region of 2GRX_A is screened against the whole complementary protein rather than the restricted region of the two interacting proteins. Therefore it is reasonable to suppose that there may be multiple regions on the surface of the target antigen to which the mimotope can bind. As a result, the mimotopes may bind to the regions that are different from the preferable region.",

On average, this operation has the highest specificity of 0.930 and a high precision of 0.256 compared to that of the Union, MimoPro, and Pep-3D-Search (Tables 2 & 3) . However, its sensitivity is the lowest because some epitopic amino acids predicted by either method but not in common are left out in the calculation. This also reveals the weakness of the Intersection operation of PepMapper, i.e., in case of no overlapping between the two methods, it does not mean that no epitopic sites may be predicted by either MimoPro or Pep-3D-Search alone. 1MQ8 is such a case without common peptides, but MimoPro still predicts some positive epitopic sites.",

This is because the increased size of potential epitopic sites brought in by the Union operation also contains more false positives in the candidates. Using Consistency defined in Equation (3) as an indirect sufficient condition to judge the likelihood of successful prediction of epitope by combining both Intersection and Union, our tests tend to support its usefulness in indicating the likelihood of successful prediction (Table 3) . Although the number of tests is still insufficient for us to draw any exclusive conclusion on its implication on epitope prediction, our initial analysis leads to the following indications: ",

The Intersection operation of PepMapper realizes largely the concept of mutual verification by the two methods and hence increases the likelihood of locating the genuine epitopic region on a given antigen with respect to the interacting peptides.
