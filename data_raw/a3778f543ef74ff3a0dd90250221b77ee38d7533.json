Here we consider a structure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and G-U-base pairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base pairs. These interactions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the whole spectrum of RNA functionalities. In the context of studying natural RNA structures, searching for new ribozymes and designing artificial RNA, it is of interest to find RNA sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze their induced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding algorithms, RNAinverse, RNA-SSD as well as INFO-RNA are limited to RNA secondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse folding algorithm Inv which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical pseudoknot structures. Results: In this paper we present the inverse folding algorithm Inv. We give a detailed analysis of Inv, including pseudocodes. We show that Inv allows to design in particular 3-noncrossing nonplanar RNA pseudoknot 3noncrossing RNA structures-a class which is difficult to construct via dynamic programming routines. Inv is freely available at http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/inv.html. Conclusions: The algorithm Inv extends inverse folding capabilities to RNA pseudoknot structures. In comparison with RNAinverse it uses new ideas, for instance by considering sets of competing structures. As a result, Inv is not only able to find novel sequences even for RNA secondary structures, it does so in the context of competing structures that potentially exhibit cross-serial interactions.",

The first mfe-folding algorithm for RNA secondary structures, however, dates back to the 60's [12] [13] [14] . For restricted classes of pseudoknots, several algorithms have been designed: Rivas and Eddy [15] , Dirks and Pierce [16] , Reeder and Giegerich [17] and Ren et al [18] . Recently, a novel ab initio folding algorithm Cross has been introduced [19] . Cross generates minimum free energy (mfe), 3-noncrossing, 3-canonical RNA structures, i.e. structures that do not contain three or more mutually crossing arcs and in which each stack, i.e. sequence of parallel arcs, see eq. (1), has size greater or equal than three. In particular, in a 3-canonical structure there are no isolated arcs, see Figure 2 .",

The output of Inv is an RNA sequences s = (s 1 s 2 ...s n ), where s h {A, C, G, G} with the property Cross(s) = T, see Figure 24 . The core of Inv is a stochastic local search routine which is based on the fact that each 3-noncrossing RNA structure has a unique loop-decomposition, see Theorem 1 in Section 2.1. Inv generates \"optimal\" subsequences and eventually arrives at a global solution for T itself. Inv generalizes the existing inverse folding algorithm by considering arbitrary 3-noncrossing canonical pseudoknot structures. Conceptually, Inv differs from INFO-RNA in how the start sequence is being generated and the particulars of the local search itself.",

While folding maps into RNA secondary structures are well understood, the generalization to 3-noncrossing RNA structures is nontrivial. However the combinatorics of RNA pseudoknot structures [27, 28, 38] implies the existence of large neutral networks, i.e. networks composed by sequences that all fold into a specific pseudoknot structure. Therefore, the fact that it is indeed possible to generate via Inv sequences contained in the neutral networks of targets against competing pseudoknot configurations, see Figure  24 and Figure 25 confirms the predictions of [31] .",
