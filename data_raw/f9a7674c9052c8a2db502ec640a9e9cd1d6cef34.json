To decompose the time-series data, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was applied to properly describe the trends of HIV and AIDS incidence. A mathematical model was used to estimate the relative change of incidence among provinces and age groups. Results: A total of 483,010 newly HIV infections and 214,205 AIDS cases were reported between 2004 and 2014 nationwide. HIV infection increased from 13,258 in 2004 (RI 1.02 per 100,000 person years) to 74,048 in 2014 (RI 5.46 per 100,000).

The relative increase for HIV and AIDS RI was higher in northwest provinces while lower in Henan, Xinjiang, Guangxi and Yunnan. The overall relative changes for HIV infection were 1.12 (95% CI 1.11-1.14) in males and 1.10 (95% CI 1.06-1.13) in females. For AIDS RI, the relative increases were 1.31 (95% CI 1.26-1.36) in males and 1.22 (95% CI 1.17-1.28) in females. The lowest relative increase was detected among young adults, while the largest relative increase (odds ratio [OR] > 1.30) was detected in people aged 55 years or above. Conclusions: HIV and AIDS showed an increasing trend in China from 2004 to 2014, respectively, but the epidemic tended to be under control among provinces and young people that used to have a high HIV and AIDS incidence. Northwest China and older people could be new \"hop-spots\" for HIV and AIDS risk.",

The notifiable infectious diseases were divided into Classes A, B and C. According to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act, all epidemic reports are time-sensitive. All Class A infectious diseases as well as pulmonary anthrax and SARS in Class B should be reported through the system within 2 h after diagnosis, and other disease in Class B and Class C infectious diseases should be reported within 24 h after diagnosis. As a result, the date of diagnosis and reporting is the same day. We extracted HIV and AIDS data from 2004 and 2014 from the Science Data Center of Public Health (http://www.phsciencedata.cn).

For instance, AIDS incidence showed a plateau after 2013, which might imply a near-future decrease of AIDS cases with the persistent expansion of availability of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) [21] . Also, the control of HIV and AIDS epidemic in Henan, Xinjiang, Guangxi and Yunnan might be an indication for the effectiveness of preventive strategies and measures after the SARS outbreak, and these areas used to be the \"hot-spots\" of HIV and AIDS in China [22] . In the first two decades of HIV and AIDS era in China, Henan, Guangxi, Yunnan and Xinjiang had high HIV and AIDS prevalence [23] , but had different transmission modes. After dramatically cracking down the illegal blood trade in Henan [24, 25] , HIV and AIDS incidence showed the lowest relative change there. Guangxi and Yunnan are close to the \"Golden Triangle\" in Burma, where intravenous drug use was once the major source of HIV transmission, but unprotected sex was found to be a main source of HIV transmission recently [26, 27] . In this study, Guangxi and Yunnan had a relatively slow increasing trend for both HIV infection and AIDS incidence, which might ascribe to substantial targeted endeavors combating HIV and AIDS in the last decade. A similar changing pattern was observed in Xinjiang, where the HIV and AIDS incidence was high in 2004, but the relative increase was low during the study period.",

Reported HIV infection cases increased from 13,258 in 2004 (RI: 1.02 per 100,000) to 74,048 in 2014 (RI = 5.46 per 100,000). Reported AIDS cases increased from 3054 in 2004 (RI = 0.23 per 100,000) to 45,145 in 2014 (RI = 3.33 per 100,000). The overall relative changes in incidence measured by OR were 1.11 (95% CI 1.10-1.13) for HIV and 1.28 (95% CI 1.23-1.33) for AIDS, respectively. The increase for HIV infection incidence was in a linear fashion. For AIDS incidence, the linear increase was smaller for the period of 2004-2009, with a relative change of 1.06 (95% CI 1.03-1.09), it was larger between 2010 and 2013, with a relative change of 1.44 (95% CI 1.37-1.50). The incidence of reported AIDS was plateaued in 2014 (Fig. 1). Changing patterns of HIV and AIDS incidence according to each province The distributions of HIV infection and AIDS varied geographically in China (Fig. 2; Figs. 1 and 2 in Appendix).
