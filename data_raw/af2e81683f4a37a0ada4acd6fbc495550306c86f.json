It is well established that social support has been related to the onset of PTSD after natural disasters. However, very little is known whether or not social support has had an influence on the recovery from the PTSD that was diagnosed after floods. This study, therefore, made a follow-up assessment of PTSD in flood victims 13-14 years after they were diagnosed with PTSD in 2000 to measure the prevalence rate of PTSD among them and identify the association between social support and their recovery from PTSD.",

A follow-up survey was done between the years 2013 and 2014 to diagnose the victims again of PTSD using the DSM-IV criteria. Social support and its three dimensions were measured using the Chinese version of Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), including objective support, subjective support and support utilization. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between social support and the recovery from PTSD after flood. Results: Out of 321 subjects with prior PTSD, 51 (15.89 %) were diagnosed as still having PTSD. Logistic regression analyses indicated that the recovery from prior PTSD was significantly associated with social support (odds ratio (OR) =0.202, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI): 0.047-0.878), subjective support (OR = 0.236, 95 % CI: 0.080-0.694) and support utilization (OR = 0.245, 95 % CI: 0.071-0.844).",

It may lead to direct economic loss, and may cause both physical and psychological injuries, particularly in developing countries with limited availability of coping mechanisms [1] . China has been seriously affected by floods. For example, a severe flood that struck the Yangzi River of China in 1998 affected over 180 million people. According to the New Report from Ministry of Health of China in 1999, the flood displaced 18.393 million people, destroyed 6.85 million houses, caused 4,150 deaths and yielded a direct economic loss of about $32 billion. Dongting Lake, located south of the middle reach of the Yangzi River in Southern China, was one of the areas most affected by the floods. Hundreds of thousands of residents were homeless and many infrastructural and agricultural projects were also damaged, leaving survivors with some psychological problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",

According to the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5), PTSD consists of four clusters of symptoms, namely intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyper-arousal [2] . It has been estimated that the lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the general population is 1 % to 9 % [3] . Individuals with PTSD may experience a long recovery process after traumatic events [4] . For example, half of the police responders in the World Trade Center Health Registry with PTSD in 2003-2007 continued to have PTSD in 2011-2012 after the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001 [5] . In the past decades, researches on PTSD have mainly focused on PTSD after traumatic events like earthquakes [6] [7] [8] , hurricanes [9] [10] [11] , wars [12] [13] [14] [15] , and traffic accidents [16, 17] . Articles about PTSD after floods have been rarely reported [18] [19] [20] , and none has reported the effect of social support on the recovery from PTSD.",

These eight counties, located south of the middle reach of the Yangzi River in Southern China (a flood-prone area), were the catchment area of Dongting Lake and were directly exposed to the 1998 Dongting Lake flood. Victims of that disaster from these counties (aged 16 or above) formed the target population. A total of 25,478 subjects were interviewed and 2,336 of them were diagnosed as having PTSD according to the DSM-IV criteria, indicating that the incidence of PTSD was 9.2 % [24] .",

The SSRS consists of 10 items and three dimensions, namely objective support, subjective support and support utilization. The dimension of objective support has 3 items: \"I often live with my family members\"; \"I often get economic assistance from family members, relatives, friends, neighbors or others when faced with some economic difficulties\"; \"I often get consolation from family members, relatives, friends, neighbors or others when faced with some trouble.\" The dimension of subjective support contains 4 items: \"I can turn to my friends for help when things go wrong\"; \"I often communicate with my neighbors\"; \"I often communicate with my colleagues\"; and \"my family will try their best to help me when things go wrong.\" The dimension of support utilization includes 3 items: \"I often seek assistance proactively when I have some difficulties\"; \"I often communicate with others about my distress\"; and \"I often participate in societal activity.\" Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = none, 2 = slight, 3 = moderate, 4 = great). The total scores of all these ten items are used to assess the current social support status of individuals. Based on the established guideline [25] , social support scores are defined as low (\u226444) and high (>44); objective support scores are defined as low (\u226413) and high (>13); subjective support scores are defined as low (\u226424) and high (>24); support utilization scores are defined as low (\u22649) and high (>9). This tool was chosen because it had proved to have better reliability and validity [26] . For instance, the correlated coefficients between total scale and three subscales ranged from 0.724 to 0.835, while Cronbach's alpha coefficients of total scale and subscales ranged from 0.825 to 0.896 [27] .",

It has been well established that different types of traumatic events and different levels of the intensity of disasters result in different prevalence rates of current PTSD [31] . In addition, follow-up time may also affect the prevalence rate of current PTSD in that the longer follow-up time may give the victims sufficient time to recover from the trauma and therefore lower the prevalence rate of current PTSD. It is believed that few studies about PTSD have followed up a target population after the space of time longer than this follow-up study. In this study, it was also found that individuals with less flood-related stressors were more prone to recover from prior PTSD than those with more flood-related stressors. This was consistent with many reported studies that aimed at finding risk factors of PTSD [5, 32, 33] . Trauma-related stressors are not only related to the incidence of PTSD but also associated with the recovery from prior PTSD. Victims experiencing more floodrelated stressors may need relatively more time to recover from the pain that disasters inflicted on their bodies and minds.",

It was found that social support was closely related to some demographic characteristics. There was a higher level of subjective support, objective support and social support in married participants than in unmarried participants. Overall, family members seem to be the first choice to provide any kind of social support and the support from one's spouse even plays an irreplaceable role in one's perceived social support [34] . Also, there was a higher level of subjective support in the elderly than in the young. However, the young showed a higher level of support utilization than the elderly. These observations could possibly result from the fact that the elderly have much wider social interactions than the young by virtue of their age, but it is also because of their age, they have not so many ways to utilize social support as the young. With the development of the social network connections, young people can make use of such tools to obtain social support, but it's relatively hard for the elderly to take advantage of these social network connections.",

            "text": "Social support refers to the function and quality of social relationships and may affect the way one copes with stress. According to some researches, social support can act as a buffer and then lessen or even prevent the stress from occurring [35] . Notably, social support and good relationships with family members can increase quality of life [36] . A number of studies had proved that social support was associated with the onset of PTSD [14, [37] [38] [39] [40] , but it was unclear whether social support may influence the recovery from prior PTSD or not. The results of this follow-up study revealed that social support was positively correlated with the recovery from PTSD. Strong social support can not only protect individuals from suffering from psychological disorders, but also facilitate the psychological recovery from disasters. Therefore, social support may have a long-term influence on alleviating the psychological effect of flood.",

In this study, it was found that social support, subjective support and support utilization were significantly associated with current PTSD. After adjusting for the potential confounding variables by multivariate logistic regression analyses, the results did not change. Objective support was not significantly associated with current PTSD after adjusting for the potential confounding variables. Unlike the objective support, subjective support is more about the feeling of being supported. Subjective assessment of received social support has been reported to be a more powerful predictor of subsequent improvement in psychological disorders than objective measures of social support. This is the case because one's psychological perception of reality could affect individual's behavior and development [41, 42] . Although significant correlation between objective support and the recovery from prior PTSD was not found in this study, it was worth putting on record that objective support was also irreplaceable. Components of objective support, such as economic assistance and psychological intervention, often serve as the foundation for subjective support and support utilization. The reason for no significant relationship between objective support and the recovery from prior PTSD could be due to an even distribution of objective support to flood victims by local government or communities.",

Firstly, the fluctuations of the recovery from prior PTSD and the social support level over time were uncertain because the follow-up of the target population was done only once. Secondly, the causal effect of social support and the recovery from prior PTSD were not clear. Thirdly, the diagnosis of current PTSD was made according to the DSM-IV criteria by using a self-reporting scale rather than a structured clinical interview. Selfreporting scales may not always provide accurate representation of PTSD symptomatology. However, the PCL-C used in this study was well validated and it was also used to identify PTSD in the first investigation. Finally, all participants enrolled in this study were Chinese of Han ethnicity. Hence, the results may not be applicable to other populations.",
