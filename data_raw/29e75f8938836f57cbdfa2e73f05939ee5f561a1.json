ILI was clinically defined as the sudden onset of fever$37.8uC and the presence of at least one of the following respiratory symptoms: cough, sore throat, or rhinorrhea/nasal obstruction [5, 6, 7] . Laboratory-confirmed influenza was defined as influenza confirmed by a multiplex respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the nasal/throat swab specimens. Pneumonia was defined as influenza with pulmonary infiltrate and/or hypoxia. Primary viral pneumonia was defined as pneumonia without documented bacterial pathogen. Combined bacterial pneumonia was defined as pneumonia with isolation of a significant pathogen in respiratory specimen culture or positive result of urinary antigen test. Complications were defined as the spread of influenza virus infection beyond the upper respiratory tract and the involvement of other organs including the lower respiratory tract.",

            "text": "It was previously reported in a study analyzing the activation of the antiviral responses of human dendritic cells to influenza A or B viruses that influenza B virus activates the transcription factor interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) at a faster rate than influenza A virus. That study showed that the influenza B virus induces an IFN response even if its infectivity is disabled by ultraviolet light. Therefore, initial viral transcription, replication, and viral protein synthesis are unnecessary for influenza B virusinduced antiviral responses, while influenza A viral infections activated IFN responses only after viral RNA synthesis. It is thus proposed that the early influenza virus-host cell interactions differ between influenza A and B viruses [17] . The differences in the early host recognition of the influenza A and B viruses may be associated with different influenza virus pathogenicities, clinical manifestations, and outcomes. The early host recognition of influenza B may contribute to faster and more effective restriction and faster clearance of influenza B viral infections [17] .",

            "text": "In this study, patients with influenza A (H3N2) exhibited statistically higher white blood cell counts, platelet counts, Creactive protein levels, and neutrophile percent in blood than patients with influenza B, however, means of white blood cell and platelet counts in patients with influenza A or B were within normal limits. On the other hand, the frequencies of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in patients with influenza B were statistically higher than those in patients with influenza A (H3N2), which requires further monitoring and analysis of leukocyte and platelet counts of patients with influenza A or B in the future. Furthermore, we also observed differences in the proportion of females to males and elderly populations between patients infected with influenza A or B, which suggests that the aging and sex ratio of the population might be factors to determine the relative proportion of influenza A and B viral infection in a certain population. Even though studies have reported that influenza B infections cause severe infection and complications such as pneumonia and death, especially due to bacterial co-infections, the influenza B virus has been overall considered to be less pathogenic and to produce milder symptoms than the influenza A virus in adults [18, 19, 20] . However, influenza virus type (A versus B) was not shown to be a significant independent risk factors of hospitalization in patients with influenza in the multivariate analysis. Moreover, the frequency of underlying comorbid conditions, and the proportion of elderly were lower in patients with influenza B compared to influenza A in this study. Therefore, younger age and the lower frequency of underlying comorbid conditions may be associated with milder clinical courses of patients with influenza B viral infections, while the possibility exists that influenza B virus is less pathogenic. We were also able to confirm that underlying chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, chronic lung diseases, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and neuromuscular diseases were important factors in determining hospitalization of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza.",

As a result, patients who did not visit emergency rooms were excluded. This could represent a sampling bias. Second, since the sensitivity of RT-PCR was not 100%, true influenza positive patients might be regarded as influenza negative. Third, routine laboratory tests such as white blood cell and blood platelet counts were performed and estimated for only some enrolled patients. Fourth, data regarding comorbid conditions might be underestimated as we only analyzed emergency room medical records. Fifth, we had no data on whether there was mismatch between the different strains of virus isolated and influenza vaccination in the 2011-2012 season, as we did not analyze detailed sequence data.",
