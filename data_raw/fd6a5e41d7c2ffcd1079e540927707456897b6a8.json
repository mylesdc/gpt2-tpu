A distinctive point is that because we analyzed a wide virus battery and did so in infants hospitalized continuously in two centers over two years we feel confident that our study provides reliable data on the distribution of respiratory infections. Few studies found B. pertussis cases in infants with respiratory pathogens. For example, Piedra et al., identified by RT-PCR only 4 B. pertussis cases in 2068 patients with respiratory pathogens and all these infants were younger than 6 months. In 3 of the 4 infants with B. pertussis RT-PCR identified a second respiratory pathogen: 2 had an hRV and 1 child an hCoV coinfection [8] . In a similar study, Korppi et al., showed in a nasopharyngeal aspirate by RT-PCR B. pertussis infection in 7 on 9 of patients hospitalized for RSV infection [15] . Our lower percentage of coinfections reflects the analysis of a larger series of children with B. pertussis than the other two studies.",

We presume that the distribution of coinfections reflects the observation that hRV epidemiology maintains a steady epidemic curve throughout the year and hRV can be detected also in asymptomatic children. In fact in a Netherlands study conducted in recent years Wildenbeest JG et al., found hRV in 25% of asymptomatic children [16] .",

Although no other published studies have tested 14 respiratory viruses in infants with pertussis, Nuolivirta et al., studied 142 infants aged less than 180 days hospitalized for bronchiolitis who underwent a nasopharyngeal aspirate to detect only 7 respiratory viruses and B. pertussis by RT-PCR. B. Pertussis involvement was found in 12 of 142 (8.5%) infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis and, of these, 8 were in coinfection with RSV. They found no differences in clinical findings, days hospitalization and breastfeeding at admission in patients with respiratory viruses alone than in patients with respiratory viruses in coinfections with B. pertussis [17] . Schnoeller et al. showed that respiratory infection of neonatal mice with an attenuated B. pertussis can protect against RSVinduced disease in adult life [18, 19] . In a human model Schiavoni et al. demonstrated that an attenuated B. pertussis rescues the immune functions of RSV infected human dendritic cells by promoting a protective Th1/ Th17 responses. Self-limiting respiratory infections with attenuated bacteria or commensal microbes may have a beneficial effect limiting potentially lethal diseases caused by respiratory viruses in infants [20] .",

This finding is difficult to explain. We always strongly encourage breastfeeding in infants because it has well-known immunological and nutritional advantages [21] . In a recent large multicenter study, on pertussisassociated pneumonia in children from low-and middleincome countries, pertussis-positive cases were more likely to have never been breastfed compared with controls [22] . Our finding might reflect mother-to-child transmission of respiratory infections during breastfeeding.",
