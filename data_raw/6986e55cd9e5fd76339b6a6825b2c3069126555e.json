Although many studies have detected it throughout the world, its molecular epidemiology has not been characterized in northwest China. To understand its prevalence, 203 fecal samples were collected from different regions of Gansu Province and tested with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In this study, we tested these samples for PKV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and sapovirus and analyzed the amplified 2C gene fragments of PKV. Overall, 126 (62.1%) samples were positive for PKV. Of the 74 piglets samples among the 203 fecal samples, 65 (87.8%) were positive for PKV. PKV infection was often accompanied by PEDV, but the relationship between the two viruses must be confirmed. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the PKV strains isolated from the same regions clustered on the same branches. This investigation shows that PKV infections are highly prevalent in pigs in northwest China, especially in piglets with symptoms of diarrhea.",

PKV has been reported in many regions of China, including Shanghai City [10] , Jiangsu Province [11] , Hebei Province [3] , Jiangxi Province [12] , and Sichuan Province [13] . However, there are no reports of a PKV epidemic in Gansu Province of China to date. In order to better understand the virus prevalence in Gansu Province, PKV and coinfecting pathogens were detected by RT-PCR, and genetic characterization of PKV isolates was performed. representative of the regions of Gansu Province with high numbers of porcine livestock. To determine the groups that are more susceptible to PKV, the 203 fecal samples were divided into two groups: 129 adult pigs and 74 piglets. The piglets are younger than 21 days and the others are older, and samples collected from piglets are all with symptoms of diarrhea; samples collected from adults pigs are not so. Many pathogens cause diarrhea in pigs, including PEDV, RV, TGEV, and SaV, but PEDV, PKV, and SaV are the main etiological factors in pigs detected in Gansu Province. To determine the prevalence of PKV and its relationships with other viruses, we used RT-PCR assays to detect PKV, PEDV, and SaV in all the samples, and constructed a phylogenetic tree using the amplified fragments of the 2C gene of PKV with the maximum-likelihood method.",

Lanzhou is divided into three counties (Yongdeng, Gaolan, and Yuzhong) and five areas (Chengguan, Qilihe, Anning, Xigu, and Honggu). L1 and L2 came from Gaolan, but L3 came from Chengguan. Therefore, the outbreaks of PKV in Jiuquan may be attributable to L3 or vice versa. To avoid the occurrence of a similar situation, we must strictly control the importation and exportation of pigs between regions. The samples from Pingliang and the PKV prototype strain, S-1-HUN, clustered on the same small branch.

RT-PCR showed that PKV infections were more prevalent in the piglets than in the adult pigs examined, and similar results were observed for PEDV and SaV. And the samples collected from piglets are all with symptoms of diarrhea; samples collected from adults pigs are not so. So kobuvirus is more prevalent in pigs with diarrhea. Besides, PKV infection is often accompanied by PEDV. Since most studies tend to concentrate on a single pathogen, limited data are available on coinfections or mixed infections; the finding that PKV occurs in mixed infections or coinfections with other viruses must be confirmed. Because we also detected PKV in pigs without clinical symptoms, it is possible that this virus is one of the opportunistic pathogens of gastroenteritis in pigs. When pigs are infected with viruses and their immunological resistance is reduced, further infection with PKV will aggravate their condition, hastening death. In this study, the infection rate of PKV was 62.1% for all the samples with diarrhea collected from Gansu Province, BioMed Research International 5 which is higher than the rate of 30.1% in pigs with diarrhea in China [3] . The prevalence of PKV decreased significantly with age, which is consistent with the previous finding that PKV prevalence was highest in pigs <3 weeks old [15] .",
