            "text": "Despite the availability of highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, sustained viral response (SVR) rates remain suboptimal for difficult-to-treat patient populations such as those with HCV genotype 3, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience, warranting development of more potent HCV replication antivirals. AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a novel phosphoramidate prodrug of 2'fluoro-2'-C-methylguanosine-5'-monophosphate that has potent in vitro activity against HCV. The EC 50 of AT-511, determined using HCV laboratory strains and clinical isolates with genotypes 1-5, ranged from 5-28 nM. The active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, specifically inhibited the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. AT-511 did not inhibit the replication of other selected RNA or DNA viruses in vitro. AT-511 was approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1-5 and remained fully active against S282T resistance-associated variants, with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. In vitro, AT-511 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases or elicit cytotoxicity or mitochondrial toxicity at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. Unlike the other potent guanosine analogs PSI-938 and PSI-661, no mutagenic O 6 -alkylguanine bases were formed when incubated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and AT-511 had IC 50 values \ufffd25 \u03bcM against a panel of CYP enzymes. In hepatocytes from multiple species, the active triphosphate was the predominant metabolite produced from the prodrug, with a half-life of 10 h in human hepatocytes. When given orally to rats and monkeys, AT-527 preferentially delivered high levels of AT-9010 in the liver in vivo. These favorable preclinical attributes support the ongoing clinical development of AT-527 and suggest that, when used in combination with an HCV DAA from a different class, AT-527 may increase SVR rates, especially for difficult-to-treat patient populations, and could potentially shorten treatment duration for all patients.",

A significant number of those with chronic infection will develop cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma or liver failure, resulting in approximately 400,000 deaths each year [1] . Recently approved combination regimens of DAAs, such as sofosbuvir (SOF) plus ledipasvir or velpatasvir and glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir, have not only drastically improved efficacy outcomes, but have decreased treatment side effects compared to the interferon-containing regimens of the past [2] . Indeed, these regimens have produced sustained virologic response (SVR) rates greater than 90%, and with treatment duration of 8-12 weeks, depending on the regimen and patient population, have resulted in sustained virologic cures. Despite these recent advances, significant challenges remain in managing difficult-to-treat populations including those with HCV genotype (GT) 3 infection, cirrhosis or prior treatment experience. These populations typically require at least 12 weeks of treatment, often in combination with ribavirin, which increases the risk of serious side effects [3] , or they are not able to receive treatment regimens containing a protease inhibitor due to their advanced liver disease [4] . Therefore, an ideal regimen would have high efficacy based on shorter treatment duration for most, if not all, patient populations, with an improved safety profile that includes less drugdrug interaction potential compared to some currently approved regimens.",

            "text": "For the treatment of HCV, DAAs have been developed that target different critical steps in the HCV life cycle. One such target of interest is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), encoded by the NS5B region of the HCV genome, which is essential for viral replication. Thus, nucleotide analogs that can be converted to their triphosphate analog within cells, incorporated into nascent HCV RNA, and block viral replication are preferred candidates since they have proven to be potent, pan-genotypic inhibitors with a high barrier to drug resistance. In addition, the apparent improved antiviral activity of guanosine analogs, compared to pyrimidine analogs such as SOF [5] , had prompted a search for modified guanosine analogs containing a proven substituted ribose moiety with a monophosphate prodrug. Previously identified guanosine analogs such as PSI-938 (a cyclic phosphate prodrug of 2'-fluoro-2'-Cmethylguanosine-5'-monophosphate) and BMS-986094 (a prodrug of 2'-C-methylguanosine-5'-monophosphate) had excellent activity against HCV replication, but their development was halted due to observed hepatic and cardiac toxicity, respectively [6, 7] . The structures of AT-527, SOF, PSI-938 and BMS-986094 as well as PSI-661, a structurally-related HCV inhibitor that showed potent in vitro activity against HCV [8] , are presented in Fig 1. We are presently developing AT-527, whose putative metabolic pathway is presented in Fig  2. AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a phosphoramidate prodrug of 2'-fluoro-2'-Cmethylguanosine-5'-monophosphate. The phosphoramidate moiety of AT-527 is identical to that of SOF [9] and is presumed to be subject to the same initial metabolic activation pathway leading to the unique nucleotide monophosphate (MP) still containing the N 6 -methyl modification (M2), that is, hydrolysis catalyzed by human cathepsin A (CatA) and/or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) producing the L-alanyl intermediate (M1), followed by removal of the amino acid moiety by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) resulting in the MP metabolite, M2. As with PSI-938, M2 is likely converted to M3 by adenosine deaminase like protein 1 (ADALP1; [10] ) and further anabolized sequentially by guanylate kinase 1 (GUK1) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) to the pharmacologically active triphosphate (TP), AT-9010. Presumably, both M2 and M3 can be dephosphorylated by 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NTase) to their respective nucleosides M4 and AT-273 (Fig 2) . Thus, AT-527 possesses a unique structural feature with an N 6 -methyl group which critically differentiates it from other guanosine nucleotide analogs with respect to drug metabolism and provides the compound with a favorable preclinical safety profile while maintaining highly potent antiviral activity, supporting its clinical development.",

The nucleoside metabolite of the MP still containing the N 6 -methyl modification, M4, peaked roughly 3 hours later. The nucleoside metabolite AT-273, which is formed from the dephosphorylation of AT-9010 and its DP and MP forms and is thus a measure of the intracellular formation of these phosphates, had the longest mean residence time (MRT; a measure of the average time a molecule spends in circulation) at 17.5 \u00b1 2.1 h. Apart from M4 levels being somewhat higher in female rats, there were no obvious gender differences, so mean values (\u00b1 SD) of the combined data from both sexes are presented. Plasma profiles in male monkeys (n = 3 per dose) were similar to those in rats (Fig 7) . Mean AUC 0-last values for AT-511 and M1 increased nearly dose proportionally but systemic exposures to M4 and AT-273 only rose 2-to 3-fold with the 10-fold increase in dose. This data reflects the rapid absorption and efficient conversion of AT-511 to M1, suggesting that elimination of the nucleoside metabolites M4 and AT-273 (likely via renal excretion) was not saturated as the dose was increased. Again, AT-273 had the longest MRT after administration of AT-527 at all three dose levels ( Table 8) , indicative of the long half-life of the active TP formed intracellularly.",

Similarly, mean liver/heart concentration ratios for AT-9010 in male monkeys 4 hr after an oral dose of AT-527 at 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg (n = 2 per dose) were 11-31 (Table 9) , indicating preferential formation of the active TP in the liver of both species. In fact, in all heart tissues except one from a rat dosed at 500 mg/kg, concentrations of AT-9010 had to be estimated by extrapolation of the calibration curves below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the LC-MS/MS assay (110 pmol/g). Moreover, as was observed in hepatocytes and Huh-7 cells, the active TP was the predominant metabolite measured in 4-h monkey livers at 30 and 100 mg/kg and its concentrations were dose proportional (545 \u00b1 349 and 1890 \u00b1 519 pmol/g, respectively) ( Table 9) . At the lower more therapeutically relevant dose of 30 mg/kg, the mean liver AT-9010 concentration was 34-fold higher than its parent phosphoramidate, again demonstrating efficient conversion of AT-511 to the active TP in liver cells. Monkey livers had 500-fold more AT-511 after the 300 mg/kg dose compared to the 30 mg/kg dose, suggesting that conversion to M1 via esterase activity becomes saturated at a very high dose. Nevertheless, even at this high dose, AT-9010 concentrations were 18 times higher in liver compared to corresponding heart tissues. In addition to the high liver/heart ratios for AT-9010 in monkeys, the similarly high ratios for its monophosphate precursors, M2 and M3 , are further evidence that these compounds are preferentially delivered to the liver, the target organ for HCV infection. As was observed in hepatocytes from all species tested, the 5'-TP of M2 was either not detected in monkey liver and heart tissue or possibly present but only at trace levels, well below the LLOQ of the assay (110 pmol/g). The dose proportionality of AT-9010 in monkey livers between the 30 and 100 mg/kg doses was reflected in plasma levels of AT-273, with fold increases in respective C max and AUC 0-last values of 3.1 and 1.9 with the 3.3-fold increase in dose. This is consistent with AT-273 only being formed via dephosphorylation of its phosphorylated forms (Fig 2) . Since AT-9010 is the predominant intracellular phosphorylated metabolite, AT-273 can be considered a plasma marker of intracellular levels of the active triphosphate.",

Moreover, AT-511 is 40-58 times Potency and selectivity of the novel guanosine nucleotide prodrug, AT-527, against hepatitis C virus more potent than SOF against RAVs containing the S282T polymorphism and at least 10-fold more potent than PSI-938, suggesting that AT-511 may potentially demonstrate greater clinical antiviral activity than these other two nucleotide prodrugs. This result is consistent with the high intracellular formation of the active triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, in both Huh-7 cells and in human hepatocytes. The in vivo monkey and rat studies demonstrated that AT-511 was efficiently absorbed when dosed orally as its hemi-sulfate salt, AT-527, and was extensively converted to its active TP in liver, the target of HCV infection. Despite the relatively low concentrations of AT-511 in rat plasma after oral administration of AT-527, an observation which is consistent with the known high levels of esterase activity in rodent blood [16, 17] , this species produces one of the highest amounts of the active TP in hepatocyte incubations in vitro as well as liver concentrations in vivo. Additionally, the rat and monkey studies showed that oral administration of a single dose of AT-527 resulted in preferential delivery of AT-9010 and its monophosphate precursors, M2 and M3 to the liver, and that the active TP was the predominant intracellular phosphorylated metabolite formed. and plasma concentrations of AT-511, AT-273, M1 and M4 were measured by LC-MS/MS.

The lack of activity against the DNA viruses (HSV-1, adenovirus and HBV) and HIV-1 (which contains an RNA genome that requires reverse transcription into DNA) may be attributed to the dissimilarity in the polymerases involved in the replication of these viruses compared to that of HCV (a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus). The apparent specificity of AT-511 against the other single-stranded RNA viruses tested, however, suggests that there are differences in the polymerases of these related viruses that render them relatively resistant to inhibition by AT-9010.

Similarly, AT-273 can likely only be formed via dephosphorylation of its mono-, di-and tri-phosphorylated forms. The active TP is formed and retained intracellularly and its levels cannot be directly measured in blood samples. However, as AT-9010 is the most abundant metabolite formed in Huh-7 cells and hepatocytes in vitro and in liver tissue in vivo, plasma levels of AT-273 can be regarded as a surrogate of the intracellular levels of the active TP. Thus, the 10 h half-life of AT-9010 observed in human hepatocytes in vitro as well as the prolonged MRT of AT-273 in plasma of rats and monkeys after administration of a single oral dose of AT-527 are consistent with once daily oral dosing for treatment of HCV infections.",

Despite the potent clinical anti-HCV activity of the latter drug, development of these compounds was discontinued, with PSI-938 halted due to hepatic toxicity observed with extended dosing in the clinic [8, 19] . These early prodrugs share a similar modification on the nucleobase and are subject to the same metabolic pathway leading to formation of mutagenic metabolites with methyl or ethyl substitutions at the O 6 position of guanine [15, 20, 21] . AT-527 possesses a unique structural feature with an N6-methyl group that critically differentiates AT-527 from PSI-661 and PSI-938, with respect to metabolism. The results of the rhCYP3A4 study highlight this difference since, unlike PSI-661 and PSI-938, no mutagenic O 6 -alkylguanine bases were formed from AT-511, and only 1.8% was converted to other modified nucleobases, thus mitigating the hepatotoxicity risk from AT-527.

Two groups of five rats (single sex/group) were administered a single dose of 500 mg/kg AT-527, suspended in 0.5% CMC-Na and 0.5% Tween 80, via nasogastric gavage followed by a vehicle flush of 3 mL (about 3 times the nasogastric tube volume). This dosage was selected because it was close to the anticipated highest dose to be used in a repeated oral dose toxicity study and would permit accurate assessments of plasma concentrations of metabolites. Blood samples (200 \u03bcL) were collected via the saphenous vein using manual restraint at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h post dose from three animals per sex, and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 h post dose from two animals per sex.

Animals were observed for any unusual or adverse clinical signs just before and immediately after dosing and prior to each blood collection time point, with no such signs noted. After the 4-h blood collection, two rats per group were euthanized by CO 2 inhalation followed by rapid excision and snap-freezing of the heart and liver in liquid nitrogen.

Additional environmental enrichment included classical music and cartoons. Three groups of 5 monkeys each were administered 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg AT-527 as a powder filled in empty porcine hard gelatin capsules (size 0). The monkeys were fasted overnight prior to dosing and fed 4 h after dosing. Three dosages were selected to provide assessments of dose proportionality, the top two representing potential doses for a repeated oral dose toxicity study in monkeys, and the lowest predicted to be more therapeutically relevant. A pill gun was used to place the capsule beyond the root of the animals' tongues and their mouths were held loosely closed for approximately 30 sec to allow them to move the jaw and swallow the capsule. Immediately following capsule administration, 20 mL of water was given by mouth and then the mouth was opened to ensure the capsule was swallowed.

Mobile phases A (0.025% formic acid (FA) and 1 mM ammonium acetate (AA) in 5% ACN in water) and B (0.025% FA and 1 mM AA in 95% ACN in water) were used to elute samples (3 \u03bcL) at 0.6 mL/min with 10% B for 0.3 min followed by linear gradients to 60% B over 0.6 min and to 90% B over 0.2 min, and ending with 90% B for 0.4 min. The analysis of AT-273, M1 and M4 in rat plasma was the same except samples were extracted with 4 volumes of ISS2, 6 \u03bcL samples were injected onto a Gemini C18 5 \u03bcm, 4.6 x 50 mm column and a Sciex QTRAP 6500, mobile phase A was 0.3% FA in water, and samples (6 \u03bcL) were eluted at 0.8 mL/min with 2% B for 0.8 min followed by linear gradients to 30% B over 1.4 min and 98% B over 1.4 min and ending with 98% B for 1.4 min. The analysis of AT-511, AT-273, M1 and M4 in monkey plasma was conducted the same as the analysis of AT-273, M1 and M4 in rat plasma except freshly prepared plasma samples were extracted prior to storage as described and 5 \u03bcL aliquots were analyzed by LC-MS/MS.",
