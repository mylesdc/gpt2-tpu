We characterized its growth kinetics and pathogenicity in embryonated eggs, and its tropism and persistence in different tissues from chickens; then, we evaluated pathogenicity by using a new premature reproductive tract pathogenicity model. Furthermore, we determined the complete genomic sequence of BP-caKII to understand the genetic changes related to cold adaptation. According to our results, BP-caKII clustered with the KII genotype viruses K2 and KM91, and showed less pathogenicity than K2, a live attenuated vaccine strain. BP-caKII showed delayed viremia, resulting in its delayed dissemination to the kidneys and cecal tonsils compared to K2 and KM91, the latter of which is a pathogenic field strain. A comparative genomics study revealed similar nucleotide sequences between BP-caKII, K2 and KM91 but clearly showed different mutations among them. BP-caKII shared several mutations with K2 (nsp13, 14, 15 and 16) following embryo adaptation but acquired multiple additional mutations in nonstructural proteins (nsp3, 4 and 12), spike proteins and nucleocapsid proteins following cold adaptation. Thus, the establishment of BP-caKII and the identified mutations in this study may provide insight into the genetic background of embryo and cold adaptations, and the attenuation of coronaviruses.",

Due to the persistent infection IBVs are difficult to eradicate and easy to mutate into new recombinant viruses in infected flocks [2, 3] . The single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome is approximately 27 kb and encodes RNA polymerase/transcriptase (1ab), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural (3a, 3b, 5a, 5b), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [1] . Approximately 15 nonstructural proteins (nsp) are generated from the large 1a and 1ab proteins by viral proteases, and these nsp play roles in virus replication and pathogenicity [4, 5] . The spike protein is a protective antigen that is essential for virus infection in host cells [1] .",

Cold-adapted IBV strains have also been established and characterized; however, the biological traits and genetic backgrounds of these cold-adapted IBVs have not been completely elucidated [9] [10] [11] [12] . IBVs replicate firstly in the trachea then disseminate into internal organs. The temperature of the trachea is lower than internal organs, and it may be valuable to characterize the traits of cold-adapted IBVs. Furthermore, in comparison with respiratory and kidney pathogenicity tests, reproductive organ pathogenicity tests have not been easy to perform due to the long periods of observation necessary for the sexual maturation of hens [6] . Therefore, a time-saving and reproducible animal model to test reproductive organ pathogenicity is required [13] .",

(Table 4 , Figure 2 ). Some chicks in all groups died during the experiment due to weakness or viral infection, and only the surviving chicks were included for lesion scoring. BP-caKII-infected chicks did not show any cyst or caseous material in the oviduct, but 11% (1/9) of K2-infected and 64% (5/8) of KM91-infected chicks did show the lesions. Only the frequency of lesions in the KM91 challenge group was significantly higher than that in other groups (p < 0.05). ",

Therefore, BP-caKII was unlikely to have originated from SNU9106.

Pathogenic field isolates of QX-like and variant IBVs also persisted for a long time in the trachea, proventriculus, kidneys and cecal tonsils of infected chickens [24] . Therefore, embryo and cold adaptation apparently decreased pathogenicity and changed the tissue tropism of K2 and BP-caKII in embryonated eggs and chickens. However, in certain conditions, even vaccine strains may persist for a long time before being excreted into the trachea and cloaca [3] .

Previously, the premature reproductive tract pathogenicity model was established and used to evaluate IBV pathogenicity [13] . In this study, we verified the pathogenicity of BP-caKII, K2 and KM91 by using this model. KM91 showed a significantly higher pathogenicity than BP-caKII and K2, but the pathogenicity of BP-caKII was insignificantly different from K2. Considering the differences in pathogenicity in embryos and premature reproductive tracts, as well as the differences in tissue tropism, BP-caKII may be less pathogenic than K2.",

            "text": "The comparative genomics study of BP-caKII and K2 revealed mutations acquired during embryo and cold adaptation. K2 acquired relatively more missense mutations in nsp13, nsp14, nsp15 and nsp16 genes than other genes during embryo adaptation. Nsp13 is multifunctional, and its RNA 5' triphosphatase and helicase domains are located on its N-and C-terminals, respectively [26, 27] . The helicase domain of nsp13 is subdivided into the RecA1 and RecA2 domains, and four out of the five mutations identified were located in RecA2 [26] . Nsp14 is composed of the N-terminal exonuclease (ExoN) and C-terminal AdoMet-dependent guanosine N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domains, and all the mutations were located in both domains [28] [29] [30] . ExoN and N7-MTase play roles in the correction of replication errors and in mRNA capping, respectively [28, 29] . Nsp16 is an AdoMet-dependent 2'-O-methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) that plays a role in the capping of viral RNAs, which helps in the evasion of innate immunity [31] . Nsp15 is an endoribonuclease that plays an important role in the evasion of dsRNA sensors, such as RIG1 and MDA5, in infected cells [32] . The mutations shared by K2 and BP-caKII in the nsp14, 15, and 16 genes may facilitate or impair innate immunity evasion in embryos and chickens, respectively. However, the exact innate immunity differences between embryos and chickens have never been elucidated. To date, embryo-adapted strains of IBVs have shown high mutation rates in the nsp3 genes, including a large nucleotide deletion in the 3' end of the N gene and partial coding region of gene 6 [22, 33] . Therefore, mutations for embryo adaptation may be strain-specific.",

            "text": "BP-caKII acquired multiple additional missense mutations in the nsp 3, 4, 12, S and N genes during cold adaptation, but the exact functions of these mutations were unknown. Enzyme activity may be affected at different temperatures. Nsp3 has multiple domains, and three out of the four mutations were located in the PL (papain-like protease, L978F) and 3Ecto (NSP3-ectodomain, I1167del and V1168I) domains [34] . Nsp12 is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the P214L mutation and the R626C and P812I mutations are located in the Nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) and the RdRp domains, respectively. Nsp4 is involved in the formation of the replication and transcription complex (RTC) with nsp3, and nsp12 is an essential component of the RTC. Therefore, further study on the roles of the multiple mutations of nsp3, 4 and 12 seen during viral replication at the lower temperature may be interesting. The R118M mutation in S1 NTD of K2 and BP-caKII is located in the partial ceiling region of the receptor binding site, and V66A of BP-caKII is located in the vicinity of the R118M mutation site [35] . Evolutionarily, coronaviruses developed a ceiling to protect the receptor binding site in S1 NTD from host immune surveillance, and the R118M and V66A mutations may be related to the function of the partial ceiling [35] . The accumulation of multiple mutations in the N gene was interesting, but their functions in cold adaptation are unclear. The cold-adapted IAV showed mutations in its nucleoprotein, as well as the polymerase genes [36] . The RNA binding domain and SR (serine and arginine-rich) region of N interact with the ubiquitin-like domain of nsp3, and K136T and I204V mutations are located in the NTD (N-terminal domain-a.a 19-162) RNA binding site and LKR (Linker region) (a.a 163-218), respectively [37, 38] . The V317L and T343S mutations are in the putative dimerization core (a.a 250-349) of CTD (C-terminal domain-a.a 219-349) that binds single-stranded RNA [39] . Therefore, multigenic mutations may be acquired during cold adaptation of coronavirus.",
