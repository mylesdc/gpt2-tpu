Although it is known that macrophage numbers are elevated in the respiratory tract of IBV infected chickens, the role played by macrophages in IBV infection, particularly as a target cell for viral replication, is unknown. In this study, first, we investigated the ability of IBV to establish productive replication in macrophages in lungs and trachea in vivo and in macrophage cell cultures in vitro using two pathogenic IBV strains. Using a double immunofluorescent technique, we observed that both IBV Massachusetts-type 41 (M41) and Connecticut A5968 (Conn A5968) strains replicate in avian macrophages at a low level in vivo. This in vivo observation was substantiated by demonstrating IBV antigens in macrophages following in vitro IBV infection. Further, IBV productive infection in macrophages was confirmed by demonstrating corona viral particles in macrophages and IBV ribonucleic acid (RNA) in culture supernatants. Evaluation of the functions of macrophages following infection of macrophages with IBV M41 and Conn A5968 strains revealed that the production of antimicrobial molecule, nitric oxide (NO) is inhibited. It was also noted that replication of IBV M41 and Conn A5968 strains in macrophages does not interfere with the induction of type 1 IFN activity by macrophages. In conclusion, both M41 and Con A5968 IBV strains infect macrophages in vivo and in vitro resulting productive replications. During the replication of IBV in macrophages, their ability to produce NO can be affected without affecting the ability to induce type 1 IFN activity. Further studies are warranted to uncover the significance of macrophage infection of IBV in the pathogenesis of IBV infection in chickens. PLOS ",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is primarily a respiratory disease of chickens but with potential to cause more widespread infection in the urinary and reproductive tracts in chicken leading to significant production losses in commercial broiler and layer flocks worldwide [1] . The causative infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae. The disease is usually characterized by high morbidity and low mortality in mature birds, whereas in naive young birds (2-3 weeks of age), mortality up to 100% can be observed [1] . Being an RNA virus with the ability to mutate and recombine, IBV persist as numerous serotypes and strains. The control of IB relies on vaccination. Vaccines are available for commonly occurring serotypes and strains but they are not necessarily antigenically similar to the wild-type viral strains circulating in poultry barns. Although, these vaccine strains may provide some degree of protection for some related strains known as protectotypes [2] , the commonly available vaccines may not elicit protective immune responses in a flock if the field strains are antigenically very different from the vaccine strains. Owing to this reason, vaccination against IBV is not currently considered to be a very effective control method and other biosecurity measures are necessary to prevent the introduction of IBV into poultry production facilities.",

Additionally, IBV has tropisms for a variety of tissues. However, the mode of dissemination from the common route of entry, i.e. the respiratory route, to the rest of the body systems could potentially be due to the initial viremia [3] . Once disseminated, IBV infects epithelial cells of the reproductive and urinary systems, particularly the oviduct and kidney depending on the infecting strain [4] . Recently, it has been shown that a nephro-pathogenic strain of IBV (B1648) could replicate in peripheral blood monocytes leading to viremia [4] . The infection of circulating monocytes could potentially disseminate IBV to the urinary tract, liver and spleen [4] .",

Macrophages have been implicated to play in an important role in the pathogenesis of some animal and human viruses including Marek's disease virus in birds [6] , feline corona virus in cats [7] , and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [8] . It was also shown that coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) can replicate within human macrophages [9] thereby interfering with macrophage functions leading to severe pathology [10] .

To address these questions, we conducted both in vivo and in vitro experiments. With our initial observations, we verified that a portion of macrophages present in trachea and lungs carry antigens of both M41 and Conn A5968 strains of IBV. IBV M41 strain is known to induce severe clinical signs compared to IBV Conn A5968 strain. Second, we observed that these two strains of IBV can infect macrophages in vitro forming fully infectious IBV viral particles and establishing productive replication leading to release of virus. Third, we showed that the replication of M41 and Conn A5968 strains of IBV in macrophages in vitro does not induce NO microscope was used for the quantification of macrophage in immunostained sections.

            "text": "With the finding of replication of M41 and Conn A5968 strains in macrophages, further studies are required in order to see whether the IBV established infection in macrophages is strain dependent. In general, many members of the family Coronaviridae target macrophages as a site of viral replication. However, as shown before this was not the case for Beaudette and Massachusetts type 82822 strains of IBV [11] . Although we could not find any information about the pathogenic potential of Massachusetts type 82822 strain of IBV, we are aware that IBV Beaudette strain is a nonpathogenic strain. It is known that the M41 and Conn A5968 strains of IBV we used in our experiments are pathogenic in the field and infect na\u00efve chickens [5, 22] leading to negative consequences on poultry production. It is likely that strain difference and macrophage tropism could be related to difference in virulence. This is in agreement with observations made in studies on feline coronavirus infections [23] . In cats, there are two related corona viral strains and only one of them replicates in macrophages leading to deadly systemic infection referred to as feline infectious peritonitis. The second question arising from our finding relates to the type of entry receptor used by IBV expressed on macrophages. Although dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) in macrophages has been identified as a receptor involved in recognizing carbohydrate components in pathogens, influenza virus is capable of using this receptor for entry into macrophages [24] . DC-SIGN also has been shown as an entry receptor for feline infectious peritonitis corona virus infection of monocytes [25] . Recently, it has also been shown that The MQ-NCSU cells were cultured on 6-well plates for 24 hours before infected with 0.1 MOI of IBV Conn A5968 or M41 strains. After 1 hour of adsorption period, inoculum was drained and cells were washed 2 times with HBSS to preclude subsequent quantification of the residual IBV inoculum and continued to incubate at 40\u02daC before collecting cell culture supernatant at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48 hpi for IBV viral RNA concentration determination using a qPCR assay. All the treatments were done in triplicate and qPCR reactions were carried out in triplicate for each sample as well. For each time point, average number of IBV copies per 200 ng of starting RNA of both IBV Conn A5968 and M41 strains are shown with SEM. ANOVA test was performed to identify group differences and the differences were considered significant at P<0.05. The results represent pooled data of three independent experiments.",

            "text": "Avian macrophages are known to produce antiviral molecules such as NO and type 1 IFN [28, 29] . These two immune mediators are well known for their innate host responses against coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV [30] [31] [32] . Whether IBV replication is inhibited by NO originating from macrophages is not known but some other avian viruses such as infectious laryngotracheitis virus [33] and reovirus [34] can be inhibited by NO originated from avian macrophages. In addition, avian viruses such as avian paramyxovirus can be inhibited by type IFNs [35] . With this rationale, we directed our focus to evaluate NO production and type 1 IFN activity of macrophages during the IBV replication in avian macrophages. Since we show that avian macrophages are vulnerable to M41 and Conn A5968 IBV infections, we questioned whether IBV M41 and Conn A5968 strains could impair the pathways leading to production of NO and type 1 IFN activity while they replicate within macrophages. First, we found that IBV M41 and Conn A5968 infections of macrophages do not lead to the production of NO in vitro. This observation is in agreement with the observation made in murine macrophages using H5N1 and H1N1 influenza viruses [36] , swine macrophages using classical swine fever virus [37] and avian macrophages using infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) [38] infections. The latter study in avian macrophages showed that certain strains of IBDV inhibit NO production. Second, we found that IBV M41 and Conn A5968 infections of macrophages do not interfere with the type 1 IFN activity in vitro although inhibition of type 1 IFN production has been shown by other corona viruses such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [39] , porcine delta coronavirus [40] , SARS-CoV [41] and murine coronavirus [42] . Although, IBV has not been linked to inhibition of type 1 IFN activity in macrophages as observed currently, it has been shown to inhibit type 1 IFN response in chicken epithelial and fibroblast cells [43] [44] [45] . Although it has been shown that IBV accessory protein 5b is responsible for this down regulation of type 1 IFN activity via the inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 in epithelial and fibroblast cells [44, 45] , further studies are required to investigate why accessary 5b protein of IBV is not regulating the type 1 IFN activity in macrophages.",

However, we could not extend our observations further to elucidate the consequences of IBV-macrophage interaction in chickens. Although M41 and Conn A5968 strains of IBV infections first establish infections in the respiratory tract, these two strains of IBV are known to replicate in a variety of tissues leading to pathology in these tissues [4] . For example, M41 strain of IBV replicates in shell gland, kidney and tissues of gastrointestinal tract in addition to the respiratory tract [3, 46] . Similarly, IBV Conn A5968 strain has been shown to be present in bursa of Fabricius, intestine and respiratory tract [46] . The ability of IBV to replicate in macrophages can be a major determinant of pathogenicity as it may facilitate carriage to susceptible tissues and organs as demonstrated in some other viral infections such as Ebola virus [47] , demyelinating strains of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus [48] and inoculum and infected with 0.1 MOI of M41 or Conn A5968 IBV strains. Each experiment was performed in triplicate including an uninfected control. After one hour of adsorption period, the plates were replaced with serum-free 2X MEM media and incubated for further 24 hours at 37\u02daC and 5% CO 2 before harvesting cells for TEM imaging. Low resolution images (a, b, c) and high resolution images (d, e, f) are shown with coronavirus-like particles (arrowheads). Replication of M41 and Conn A5968 strains of IBV in macrophages reduces NO production but type IFN activity. MQ-NCSU cells (0.75 x 10 6 per well) were seeded on 12-well plates and either infected or treated with 0.1 MOI of IBV Conn A5968 strain, IBV M41 strain, 1\u03bcg/ml LPS (positive control for NO production), 50\u03bcg/ml dsRNA (positive control for type 1 IFN activity) or RPMI media (negative control).

This is difficult to explain but it is possible that the process of dislodging cells for enumeration may have killed some cells. It is also important to note that without a treatment or infection there was a basal level of NO production (Fig 6b) and NO could decrease the cell survival. In agreement with this view, it has been shown that NO is capable of inducing apoptosis of mouse macrophages [51] . In the current study, we also noted an association between LPS induced NO production (approximately 60\u03bcM) in MQ-NCSU cells and % dead cells (approximately 40%) (Fig 6b) .",

In lung and trachea sections, there is a possibility of false positive co-localization due to fluorescent signals originating from two or more overlapping cells rather than fluorescent signals originating from a single cell. This potential false positive co-localization of fluorescent signals was minimized in a number of ways. First, lung and trachea sections were cut at 5\u03bcm thickness which is substantially smaller than the size of macrophage and epithelia cells. Second, we used a double immunostaining technique to stain both macrophages and IBV antigens sequentially in a single section. These double immunostained sections were observed in two separate channels and then merged to visualize the co-localization. Third, we confirmed the in vivo observations of co-localization of IBV and macrophage antigens in vitro using IBV infected monolayers of macrophages. Use of macrophage monolayers precluded the possibility of false positive co-localization of IBV and macrophage antigens due to overlapping cells in vitro.",

            "text": "IBV M41 and Conn A5968 infections were evident by both IBV antigen demonstration and histological changes of the trachea and lungs. Six days old chickens were infected intra-tracheally with IBV M41 (n = 5) and Conn A5968 (n = 5) strains (2.75\u00d710 4 EID 50 per bird) with uninfected controls (n = 4) and lung and tracheal tissues were collected in OCT and 10% formal saline at 4 dpi. Five \u03bcm frozen sections were immunostained for demonstrating IBV antigen and paraffin embedded sections were H&E stained. IBV N antigen in the tracheal and lung sections were stained using DyLight \u00ae 550 fluorescent (arrow heads). In the IBV infected trachea, complete loss of cilia (a) and thickening of the mucosa with inflammatory cell infiltration can be seen compared to the control trachea. In the IBV infected lungs, inflammation leading to reduced air exchange areas and reduced lumen of parabronchi are visible. Also, the difference of mucosal thickening in the infected and uninfected trachea is shown (d). a = cilia, b = tracheal cartilage, c = tracheal lumen, d = mucosal layer, e = parabronchial lumen and f = interparabronchial septum.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181801.g001",
