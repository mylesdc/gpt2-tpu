            "text": "Cyclooxygenases (COXs)/prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) signaling pathways are known to modulate a variety of homeostatic processes and are involved in various pathophysiological conditions. COXs/PGE 2 signaling pathways have also been demonstrated to have proviral or antiviral effects, which appeared different even in the same virus family. A porcine sapovirus Cowden strain, a member of genus Sapovirus within the Caliciviridae family, induces strong COX-2/PGE 2 but transient COX-1/PGE 2 signaling to enhance virus replication. However, whether infections of other viruses in the different genera activate COXs/PGE 2 signaling, and thus affect the replication of viruses, remains unknown. In the present study, infections of cells with the feline calicivirus (FCV) F9 strain in the genus Vesivirus and murine norovirus (MNV) CW-1 strain in the genus Norovirus only activated the COX-2/PGE 2 signaling in a time-dependent manner. Treatment with pharmacological inhibitors or transfection of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against COX-2 enzyme significantly reduced the production of PGE 2 as well as FCV and MNV replications. The inhibitory effects of these pharmacological inhibitors against COX-2 enzyme on the replication of both viruses were restored by the addition of PGE 2 . Silencing of COX-1 via siRNAs and inhibition of COX-1 via an inhibitor also decrease the production of PGE 2 and replication of both viruses, which can be attributed to the inhibition COX-1/PGE 2 signaling pathway. These data indicate that the COX-2/ PGE 2 signaling pathway has proviral effects for the replication of FCV and MNV, and pharmacological inhibitors against these enzymes serve as potential therapeutic candidates for treating FCV and MNV infections.",

Moreover, virulent, systemic FCV mutant strains causing severe systemic diseases with edematous and ulcerative skin lesions, jaundice, and a high mortality of up to 67% have recently been found in the US and EU [12] [13] [14] . Porcine sapovirus (PSaV), and bovine norovirus and nebovirus cause widespread acute gastroenteritis in piglets and calves, respectively [15] [16] [17] .

Currently three isoforms of COXs have been identified, with COX-1 and COX-2 being the most studied [29] . COX-1 functions as a housekeeping isoform of COX and is expressed constitutively to perform functions such as control of renal blood flow, platelet aggregation, and provide protection against stomach ulcers [29] . COX-2 is activated in response to different extracellular or intracellular stimuli, which can lead to the accumulation of PGs including PGE 2 [30] . PGE 2 is commonly involved in cellular immunity and inflammation events, and serves as strong regulators of cell-cell interaction, cytokine production, antigen presentation, cell differentiation and survival, apoptosis, and cell migration [30] .",

However, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) arterivirus has been shown to hijack the COX-1/PGE 2 signaling pathway and induce fever [35] , and pseudorabies herpesvirus has been shown to use both COX-1 and COX-2/PGE 2 pathways for its successful replication [54] . In contrast, in vitro and/or in vivo treatment of PGE 2 reduces replication of hepatitis B virus [43, 55] , adenoviruses [44] , parainfluenza virus [56] , and measles virus [45] , suggesting an antiviral function of PGE 2 to these viruses. Moreover, the COXs/ PGE 2 signaling pathway or their final product PGE 2 has been shown to facilitate or inhibit the replication of viruses in the same family. For example, in the Retroviridae family, the COXs/PGE 2 signaling pathway and/or PGE 2 enhances the replication of bovine leukemia virus [38] , as well as human T-cell leukemia virus-I [57] and III [58] , but inhibits human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) in monocyte-derived macrophage [59] . It should be noted that treatment of PGE 2 enhances the replication of HIV-1 in the CD4+ T-cell line MT-4 [60] , indicating also that depending on the cells, the role of COXs/PGE 2 signaling pathways is different in the same viral infection.",

Pharmacological inhibitors or siRNAs against COX-1 and COX-2 significantly reduced PSaV replication, which was restored by the addition of PGE 2 , indicating that COXs/PGE 2 acts as a proviral signal [34] . However, the role of COXs/PGE 2 signaling is unknown for other members within the Caliciviridae family. This prompts us to investigate whether other members of caliciviruses, in particular the FCV and MNV strains, use the COX-2/PGE 2 signaling pathway in the regulation of their own replication. Here, we demonstrated that COX-2 expression was induced during FCV and MNV infections, thereby causing a surge in PGE 2 levels. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibitors and siRNAs against COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes significantly reduced PGE 2 production as well as MNV and FCV replication, which could be restored by the addition of PGE 2 . These results suggest that COX-2/PGE 2 pathway has proviral effects for FCV and MNV replication.",

To investigate this, we first evaluated the influence of FCV and MNV infections on COX gene and protein expressions. Expression levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein gradually increased from 1 h post-infection (hpi) (Fig 1A and 1C ) in parallel with increased FCV viral RNA synthesis (Fig 1B) , while COX-1 protein levels remained unchanged (Fig 1A and 1C) . Similarly, the timedependent increase in the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein levels was observed in association with an increase in MNV mRNA level starting at 4 hpi (Fig 2A-2C) . The expression level of COX-1 mRNA and protein was also unaffected during MNV infection (Fig 2A and 2C ). Since PGE 2 is one of the main products of the COX enzymes [29] , we also assessed the expression levels of PGE 2 during FCV and MNV infections. Concurrent with the increased COX-2 levels during MNV and FCV infections, the production of PGE 2 was also elevated in a time-dependent manner starting from 1 hpi for FCV ( Fig 1D) and from 4 hpi for MNV (Fig 2D) .",

(D) PGE 2 levels in supernatants harvested from cells infected with or without FCV (MOI, 1 FFU/cell) at the indicated time points were analyzed by ELISA. The levels of PGE 2 in supernatants were compared between mock-and FCV-infected groups. All data shown were from three independent experiments and are presented as means and standard errors of mean. Statistical differences were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance. \u00c3 p < 0.05; \u00c3\u00c3 p < 0.001; \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3 p < 0.0001. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200726.g001 cells were pre-treated (Pre), post-treated (Post), or pre-post-treated (Pre-Post) with COX inhibitors, and viral replication was monitored at 8 hpi for FCV and 24 hpi for MNV by examining the viral titers and RNA levels. The selective COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 reduced the levels of infectious virus and RNA~3 log 10 for FCV (Fig 4A and 4B ) and by~4 log 10 for MNV ( Fig  5A and 5B ) when added after infection (post-treatment) or maintained throughout the virus infection (pre-post-treatment).

Indomethacin, a nonselective COX inhibitor, showed more significant effects on MNV infection, leading to a~5 log 10 reduction in virus yield and RNA synthesis (Fig 5E and 5F ), while FCV infection elicited a~3 log 10 decrease in infectious viral titer and genome copy numbers (Fig 4E and 4F ) when added after virus adsorption or maintained throughout the course of the infection. There was no significant effect on FCV or MNV replication in cells pretreated with COX inhibitors (Figs 4A-4F and 5A-5F).

In the present study, both FCV and MNV strongly activated the COX-2/PGE 2 pathway from an early replication time point. These results are different from our previous finding where the PSaV strain Cowden, belonging to the same Caliciviridae family, induced late activation of the COX-2/PGE 2 signaling pathway [34] . This suggested that the activation time of the COX-2/PGE 2 signaling pathway was different even in the same Caliciviridae family. In addition, the PSaV Cowden strain transiently activated COX-1/PGE 2 signaling during the later stage of infection [34] . Interestingly, no increases in the COX-1 mRNA and protein levels were observed during the entire FCV and MNV infection. However, silencing of COX-1 by specific siRNAs as well as the inhibition of COX-1 by the specific inhibitor SC-560 decreased the production of PGE 2 and replication of both viruses. Although the detailed mechanism of these results is unknown, it is presumed that the inhibition of the basal expression level of COX-1 by its specific inhibitor and siRNA suppressed PGE 2 production and thereby the replication of both viruses. Based on these results, it could be concluded that unlike the PSaV-induced late activation of both COX-1 and COX-2/PGE 2 signaling pathways, both FCV and MNV activate only COX-2/PGE 2 signaling pathway from early replication, but COX-1 might be an important factor for the successful replication of FCV and MNV.",

NSAIDs have been reported as potential therapeutic drugs for some viral infection. For example, pharmacological use of a COX-2 inhibitor in combination with neuraminidase inhibitors enhanced the survival of mice infected with H5N1 influenza [71] . The selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 was shown to protect mice from succumbing to dengue virus-2 infection [41] . In this study, we determined the potency of different COX inhibitors against FCV and MNV infections. In the FCV infection, the COX-2 selective inhibitor NS398 exerted~4 log 10 suppression in the FCV titer compared to other inhibitors. Among the COX inhibitors tested against MNV, indomethacin, a nonselective COX inhibitor, showed stronger anti-MNV effects than other inhibitors, leading to \u00e3 5 log 10 decrease in MNV titer.

For example, the HCV proteins such as NS3 and NS5A are known to enhance the COX-2/PGE 2 pathway by activating multiple signaling pathways [81, 82] . In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, viral nucleocapsid protein activates COX-2/PGE 2 pathway through direct binding to regulatory elements for NF-\u03baB and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein [80] . In our previous report, PSaV VPg and ProPol proteins significantly enhanced the expression of COX-2/PGE 2 signaling pathway [34] . Likewise, some FCV and MNV proteins are anticipated to activate the COX-2/PGE 2 signaling pathway, the mechanism of which will be investigated in a future study.",

(A and B) Cultured RAW264.7 cells were mock-infected or infected with MNV (MOI, 1 TCID 50 /ml) for the indicated time points, and the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNAs, and MNV viral RNA were determined by quantitative real time PCR. The mRNA expression levels of COX-1 and COX-2 were normalized to \u03b2-actin mRNA and are presented as a fold induction as compared with the mock-infected cells. (C) Monolayers of RAW264.7 cells were infected with or without MNV (MOI, 1 TCID 50 / ml) for the indicated time points, and the levels of the COX-1, COX-2, and GAPDH proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis. GAPDH was used as a loading control. The intensity of each target protein relative to GAPDH was determined by densitometric analysis and is indicated above each lane. (D) Cell culture supernatants harvested from the cells infected with or without MNV at the indicated time points were checked for the presence of PGE 2 by ELISA. The levels of PGE 2 in the supernatants were compared between mock-and MNV-infected groups. The presented data are depicted as means and standard errors of the mean from three different experiments. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance. \u00c3\u00c3\u00c3 p < 0.0001. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200726.g002",

Cells pretreated with each inhibitor were washed to remove each inhibitor and then infected with FCV (MOI, 1 FFU/ml) or MNV (MOI, 1 TCID 50 /ml) strains (Pre). After virus adsorption, the inhibitor(s) were added in the maintenance media (Post), or before virus inoculation and maintained throughout the course of the infection (Pre-Post). The levels of PGE 2 in the supernatants harvested at 4 hpi for FCV and 24 hpi for MNV were determined by ELISA. The PGE 2 levels from virus-infected supernatants were compared between the mockand drug-treated groups. (G and H) Confluent CRFK cells (G) and RAW264.7cells (H) were transfected with COX-1 and COX-2, or scrambled (Scram) siRNAs, and then infected with FCV (MOI, 1 FFU/cell) for 4 h or MNV (MOI, 1 TCID 50 /ml) for 24 h.
