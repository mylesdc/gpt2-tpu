            "text": "Forty-two cytopathic effect (CPE)-positive isolates were collected from 2008 to 2012. All isolates could not be identified for known viral pathogens by routine diagnostic assays. They were pooled into 8 groups of 5-6 isolates to reduce the sequencing cost. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was conducted for each group of mixed samples, and the proposed data analysis pipeline was used to identify viral pathogens in these mixed samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was individually conducted for each of these 42 isolates depending on the predicted viral types in each group. Two isolates remained unknown after these tests. Moreover, iteration mapping was implemented for each of these 2 isolates, and predicted human parechovirus (HPeV) in both. In summary, our NGS pipeline detected the following viruses among the 42 isolates: 29 human rhinoviruses (HRVs), 10 HPeVs, 1 human adenovirus (HAdV), 1 echovirus and 1 rotavirus. We then focused on the 10 identified Taiwanese HPeVs because of their reported clinical significance over HRVs. Their genomes were assembled and their genetic diversity was explored. One novel 6-bp deletion was found in one HPeV-1 virus. In terms of nucleotide heterogeneity, 64 genetic variants were detected from these HPeVs using the mapped NGS reads. Most importantly, a recombination event was found between our HPeV-3 and a known HPeV-4 strain in the database. Similar event was detected in the other HPeV-3 strains in the same clade of the phylogenetic tree. These findings demonstrated that the proposed NGS data analysis pipeline identified unknown viruses from the mixed clinical samples, revealed their genetic identity and variants, and characterized their genetic features in terms of viral evolution.",

This technology provides a considerable number of reads from different pathogens without a priori knowledge about them. These considerable number of reads are assembled into contigs by computer algorithms [5, 6] . The contigs are then searched for homologs in a database (usually BLASTN [7] ). The top-hit organism/species fulfilling the search criteria (eg, sequence identity and e-value threshold) is used to \"label\" the contig, suggesting the existence of one particular organism/species. If assembled successfully, a contig can be long enough to reveal the entire viral genome of interest. However, the de novo assembled NGS reads often yield only short contigs that are partially aligned to or even do not match the database sequences [8] , possibly because the tentative virus or similar strains have never been sequenced and thus do not appear in the database or because the virus mutated considerably (through point accumulation or recombination).",

HRV, a member of the family of Picornaviridae and assigned as species of the genus Enterovirus in 2008, is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus with an approximately 7.2-kb genome. HRV causes common cold with mild symptoms. HPeV also belongs to the family of Picornaviridae but is assigned to a different genus, Parechovirus. It is also an ssRNA virus with an approximately 7.3-kb genome. HPeV primarily causes sepsis and central nervous system (CNS) diseases in infants, and still has other unproven clinical manifestations [13] . Laboratory diagnosis of HPeV is not routinely available in clinical practice and is still evolving; antiviral therapy is also being developed [14] . In Taiwan, among hundreds of viral isolates, isolates possibly containing HPeV might not be detected using standard enterovirus identification procedures [15] . Additional investigations are therefore required to clarify the characteristics of HPeVs for more effective clinical diagnosis. Current methods for detecting HPeV include real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of stool, blood, respiratory swabs, and cerebrospinal fluid [16] . For HPeV typing, classification of the VP1 region is the current gold standard. However, because of an unknown viral load in clinical specimens, more sensitive VP1 primers for different HPeV genotypes are required [17] . Another issue is that primers are generally not available for all HPeV genotypes [18] . NGS technology involves producing genomic sequences from clinical samples without the need for designing specific primers, thus enabling the detection of unknown or untyped HPeVs.",

Preprocessing of the NGS reads was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench (version 7.5) [21] and BLASTN (version 2.2.22). In brief, we first trimmed the raw data by removing low-quality and short reads, followed by merging all the paired reads into single reads. Second, paired reads that could not be merged and merged single reads were filtered by RNA-seq analysis to remove human genome fragments. Third, the remaining reads were assembled de novo to construct contig sequences. Finally, BLASTN was used to search the assembled contigs against the nucleotide sequence (NT) database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) downloaded from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih. gov/blast/db/. Viral candidates were identified using the reported top BLASTN hits for each of the queried contig sequences fulfilling the search criterion of an e-value threshold of 10 \u22125 . A queried contig was required to have an average read depth of at least 20, which is the recommended lower bound for revealing a whole viral genome in metagenomic NGS data [22] .",

Subsequently, we implemented the iterative mapping approach proposed in this study to alter the genomic content of this HPeV-1 template to obtain as many NGS reads as possible. In brief, a consensus sequence was generated from the 2 HPeV-1 genomes, which were BLASTN subjects obtained by querying the 2 contigs. This consensus sequence was used for assembling the missing regions to generate an initial template, because contigs covered nearly HPeV genome. Subsequently, the iteration process was started from this combined genome. After 5 iterations, a terminal genome was obtained with an average mapping depth of 50.1, which increased from 35 and 49 depths of two partial sequences in 2633 and 3730 bp, respectively. A total of 56 nucleotides were present in the ORF region corrected from the initial template to the terminal template sequence. Similarly, the NGS experiment (designated as NGS 10) of TW-02547-2011 resulted in one quality viral contig of 7249 bp and depth 90, which matched the HPeV-1 PicoBank strain (FM242866) in the database. An iterative procedure started with this contig (already covering the whole genome), and after 56 iterations, it ended with a contig of depth 96.7 based on the ORF region of the terminal template. No difference was observed in nucleotides between the 2 templates based on the ORF region. That is, all iterations were the cost for substituting nucleotides in 2 UTR regions. In addition, BLAST reports of 3 quality contigs from NGS 9 and 10 were summarized in S1 File. The iterative mapping approach in this study was implemented to alter the genomic content for obtaining viral genome by attracting as many NGS reads as possible. The depths and genomic content of the terminal templates in NGS 9 and 10 seemed to be moderately corrected from their respective initial contigs though this iterative mapping process. Because the final depths in NGS 9 and 10 were 50.1 and 96.7, respectively, which were greater than the generally accepted depth threshold of 20 in exploring virus metagenomics [22] , we considered that these 2 HPeV-1 viruses were present in the 2 isolates; their CDS sequences are provided in S2 File. Table 2 was determined using Sanger sequencing, for which 8 primer sets as shown in Table 1 were designed using the prototype strain Harris (accession number S45208). Eight genomes were obtained with lengths ranging from 6993 bp for TW-00032-2011 to 7231 bp for TW-01679-2012, covering the entire ORF sequence and the partial UTR sequence. In particular, none of these HPeV primers were applicable to the 2 HPeV-1 viruses predicted from NGS 9 and 10. These 2 HPeV-1 genomes were revealed by NGS assembly analysis. In summary, the genetic characteristics of 10 HPeV genomes, including 8 determined by Sanger sequencing and 2 assembled from NGS analysis, were investigated.",

This deletion resulted in a missing 2-aa short peptide \"GN\" in the translated protein sequences, as shown in S1 Fig.  Fig 4A shows the phylogenetic tree based on 33 complete HPeV-1 ORF sequences, including the 8 TW sequences identified in this study. The most distinct pairwise percent identity among all 33 HPeV-1 sequences (or 32 sequences excluding the Harris strain isolated in 1956) was 79%, demonstrating genetic heterogeneity within this particular virus within a span from 1956 (or 1993) to 2012. All TW HPeV-1 genomes were classified into Clade B, within which the pairwise percent identities were 86% or higher, suggesting that TW strains were similar to the already published Clade-B viruses in the database. One of the TW strains, TW-02680-2008, showed an average identity of 86.3%. Similarly, comparing the other TW strains to the Clade-B strains, 7 average identities were from 87.3% to 88% and were slightly stronger than that of TW-02680-2008 (86.3%). TW-02680-2008 was distantly located from the other 26 Clade-B viruses in Fig 4A. A phylogenetic tree of TW-03067-2011 with other 41 HPeV-3 viruses retrieved from database is graphed in Fig 4B. The most distinct pairwise percent identity among all these HPeV-3 sequences was 88%. This demonstrated that HPeV-3 viruses exhibited less selection pressure in a similar span from 1994 to 2012 in comparison with HPeV-1 population, which displayed a much smaller percent identity of 79%. TW-03067-2011 had least 95% identity to the other HPeV-3 viruses in Clade B in Fig 4B.

A considerable number of epidemiology samples from northern Taiwan are received by CGMH for viral culturing every year; 52 544 clinical specimens were received from 2000 to 2008 [10] and 32 310 were received in the study period (2008 to 2012). CPE-positive isolates could not be identified using IFA, which might contain novel or emerging viruses that are public health risks, such as MERS-CoV, Ebola, SARS, and avian flu [33] . In addition, unknown pathogens might also exist in our culture-negative cases (approximately 60% of 32 310 clinical samples). A study reported that viral pathogens from 1406 of 2259 (approximately 60%) collected samples of patients with serious illness could also not be detected [34] ; new diagnostic tests were required for those culture-negative cases. Table 2 presents the 47 viral candidates detected using NGS, of which 35 candidates were confirmed using PCR. Among these 35 candidates, most had genome coverage higher than 80%, and only one (HRV-B4 in NGS 3) had a genome coverage of 65%. The other 12 candidates were not confirmed using PCR; their genome coverage was lower than 59%. As expected, higher genome coverage indicates that these viral genomes were well represented by the assembled contigs, and lower coverage makes confirming the existence of these viruses challenging. Although the HRV-B4 candidate in NGS 3 showed a lower coverage of 64% than that of the other 34 candidates, one contig having an extremely high depth of 10 043 with 4743 bp was categorized into this viral type, suggesting the existence of this HRV in NGS 3. By contrast, the HRV-A8 candidate in NGS 8 showed a coverage of 58%. Only one contig having an average depth of 29 with 4212 bp was categorized into this viral type. The top 3 BLAST subjects of this contig were HRV-A8, -A95, and -A45 sequences. Sequence similarities between viral pathogens in mixed sample may result in a false positive rate when only considering the top one hit as the potential viral candidate.",

Hence, NGSidentified viruses were confirmed and assigned to each isolate by using PCR/ELISA. All but 2 isolates (TW-01662-2010 and TW-02547-2011) were validated. An iterative mapping procedure was further performed for these two isolates that were not identified using PCR/ELISA to reveal viral genomes for detecting unknown pathogens. Although the read depths of these 2 genomes were lower than those of viral genomes from the other NGS data set, this iterative mapping process could be useful to detect unknown pathogens in clinical samples with a low viral load (or low CPE) in clinical samples. In addition, viral culturing with a low viral load negatively affects NGS experiments. Based on our experience, the time required for HPeV culture by using the RD or MRC-5 cell line is usually 3 weeks, which is much longer than 1 week for enterovirus, a common virus in regular clinical/virology laboratories.

This virus is highly infectious and causes a variety of symptoms in early childhood [38] and has atypical molecular and biological properties [13] . This study is the first to report the three genetic diversities of Taiwanese HPeV strains through various analyses, as follows. First, the phylogenetic tree in Fig 4A indicated that one HPeV-1 virus (TW-02680-2008) was highly divergent from the rest of Clade B, in which 6 nucleotide deletions were found in contrast to the other HPeV-1 viruses from the database. Although the biological consequences of this deletion are unknown, this deletion in VP0 has not been reported. Second, we suggest two cut-off values for the identification of genetic variants in a mixed sample with 1.5 gigabytes of raw reads, including a primary nucleotide composition of less than 75% and a minimum depth of 20. Based on these cut-offs, 64 genetic variants were detected from 10 HPeV strains by using NGS read mapping for revealing viral quasispecies/heterogeneity. Although additional investigations for exploring the biological consequences of these genetic variants from HPeV are required, genetic variants in the form of a viral quasispecies located in antigenic domains or drug resistant markers were similarly identified from influenza viruses. One study revealed nucleotide heterogeneity as quasispecies for characterizing influenza A/H1N1/2009 virus by using NGS read mapping [39] . Two specific amino acids (Gly172Glu and Gly239Asn) with 25% heterogeneous populations were identified, which were located on the Sa and Ca2 antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, respectively. Another study reported that Arg292Lys, one of markers for N2 that reduces oseltamivir susceptibility, was a viral quasispecies [40] . Finally, recombination events among HPeV types 1, 4, 5, and 6 were frequently detected within nonstructural (NS) genes, similar to many picornaviruses, but were more restricted among HPeV-3 strains [41] [42] [43] . Our HPeV-3 strain (TW-03067-2011) was found to be recombinant with a known HPeV-4 (K251176-02). Fig  5 illustrated the switch over of the 2 HPeV types in 2A. The similarity plot of TW-03067-2011 resembled an HPeV-3 reference (Can82853-01) from VP0 to VP1, and K251176-02 from 2B to 3C. Although it was reported that this HPeV-4 strain may have a recombination event with 2 HPeV-3 strains (A308/99 and Can82853-01, as shown in Clade A of Fig 4B) in the P2-P3 region [44] , our findings further indicated that HPeV-3 strains in Clade B were recombinant with this HPeV-4, showing a genomic region from the C-terminal 2A to N-terminal 3C derived from HPeV-4. In conclusion, we established the baseline information of NGS technology for viral detection and explored genetic diversities and signatures of HPeVs by the proposed NGS data analysis pipeline. The results of this study may help to improve epidemiological surveillance and investigations in Taiwan and around the world. S3 File. Sanger sequencing bases, NGS read consensuses, and depths and compositions of 64 genetic variants. A genetic variant was defined as a nucleotide position having its primary nucleotide alphabet appearing in less than 75% of the mapped reads with read depth of at least 20. A total of 64 variants were identified using these 2 criteria. In total, 38 were found from TW-01662-2010, 9 from TW-50192-2012, 8 from TW-00032-2011 (HPeV-4), 4 from TW-02547-2011, 2 from TW-03067-2011 (HPeV-3), 1 each from TW-71157-2011, TW-01319-2010, and TW-02680-2008, and none from TW-01679-2012 and TW-71594-20110. For example, in TW-03067-201, Sanger sequencing base and NGS read consensus at position 420 in VP0 gene are \"C\" and \"A,\" respectively. This nonsynonymous substitution causes an amino acid change from Glu to Asp. Read depth at this position is 6219, including 4638 As, 1562 Cs, 15 Gs, 3 Ts, and 1 gap. In addition, 2 predicted genomes identified using iterative mapping are marked with asterisks. (XLSX) S1 Table.

The coverage of 35 viral types is higher than 65% (shown in boldface font and confirmed through PCR), and that of the other 12 viral types is 58% or less. The coverage was obtained by using the covered region of contig(s) divided by the genomic length. The genomic length of HAdV was 36 000 bp, and the lengths of HRV, HPeV, and Echo were 7250 bp. The total lengths of all 11 rotavirus segments were 18 555 bp. All regions covered by one or more contigs in each segment were summed and divided by the genomic length for calculating the coverage. Depending on our NGS-predicted viruses, PCR or ELISA was performed for validation. HAdV and HPeV were confirmed using specific PCR primers and following HRV and Echo by EV CODEHOP PCR primers and rotavirus by ELISA. The final results show 40 identified viruses: 29 HRV, 8 HPeV, 1 echovirus, 1 HAdV, and 1 rotavirus. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0151495.t002",
