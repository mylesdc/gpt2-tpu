Antiviral drugs are an important countermeasure against IAV; however, drug resistance has developed, thus new therapeutic approaches are being sought. Previously, we demonstrated the antiviral activity of a novel nuclear export inhibitor drug, verdinexor, to reduce influenza replication in vitro and pulmonary virus burden in mice. In this study, in vivo efficacy of verdinexor was further evaluated in two animal models or influenza virus infection, mice and ferrets. In mice, verdinexor was efficacious to limit virus shedding, reduce pulmonary pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and moderate leukocyte infiltration into the bronchoalveolar space. Similarly, verdinexor-treated ferrets had reduced lung pathology, virus burden, and inflammatory cytokine expression in the nasal wash exudate. These findings support the anti-viral efficacy of verdinexor, and warrant its development as a novel antiviral therapeutic for influenza infection.",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are emerging viruses that cause seasonal epidemics and periodic pandemics. Annual epidemics caused by IAVs are substantial causing >200,000 hospitalizations and >36,000 deaths in the United States each year, and worldwide, cause >20 million new cases of disease in children <5 years of age [1] . Despite substantial research on the mechanisms of action, only modest progress has been made in the development of IAV drugs. While annual influenza vaccines are available, antigenic drift and antigenic shift of emerging viruses naturally reduce vaccine efficacy and control. The current approved anti-influenza virus drugs are the M2 inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine), and NA inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir) [2] [3] [4] . Drug-resistance to the M2-ion channel inhibitors is associated with single or multiple amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane region of M2, and more than 95% of transmissible, M2 inhibitor resistant influenza A virus strains carry the S31N mutation [5] . Further, both classes of approved anti-viral drugs are only effective if administered within 36-48 h of symptom onset having narrow therapeutic value [5] . Similarly, a number of mutations in the NA of viruses have been demonstrated by selection in the presence of NA inhibitors in vitro, thus new antivirals are actively being sought [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Host cellular genes required by the virus to replicate are appealing anti-viral targets due to their limited development of resistance/mutations, and because there are already small molecular drugs identified that target host genes which are currently under preclinical or clinical investigation and can potentially be repurposed.",

These compounds inhibit nuclear-cytoplasmic export by reversibly binding to the cargo recognition site of XPO1 and are orally bioavailable. SINE compounds were originally developed as therapeutics for various hematologic malignancies, as these drugs force the nuclear retention, accumulation, and functional activation of tumor suppressor proteins to limit oncogenesis [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . One SINE compound, verdinexor (KPT-335), has completed a registration-directed study in companion dogs with newly diagnosed or first relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) considers the effectiveness and safety technical sections under the Minor Use Minor Species (MUMS) designation complete to support conditional approval for oral verdinexor as a single agent for the treatment of lymphoma in companion dogs under a New Animal Drug Application (NADA). Additionally, verdinexor was recently found to be effective to inhibit the replication of various influenza A and B virus strains by blocking the XPO1-mediated nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes [18] . A preliminary in vivo study demonstrated verdinexor was efficacious in limiting virus burden and inflammatory cytokines expression in lungs of mice infected with a mouseadapted strain of pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (A/California/04/09-MA), and mice that received oral verdinexor treatment also displayed reduced lung pathology and mortality upon lethal virus infection [18] .",

Mice that received 20 mg/kg verdinexor at day 1 and 3 pi had considerably (p 0.05) reduced IAV in the bronchoalveolar lavaged fluid (BALF) at day 2 and 4 pi which was comparable to IAV observed in oseltamivir-treated mice. Since exacerbated inflammatory responses are associated with severe influenza virus infection, amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the BALF were also assessed (Fig 1c-1h) . Verdinexor-treated mice had significantly (p 0.01) lower IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in the BALF compared to mock-treated mice. Levels of IL-6 and IL-12p40 were also reduced at day 4 pi, although these were not statistically significant. When compared to oseltamivir-treated mice, mice treated with verdinexor also showed significantly (p 0.05) lower IFN-\u03b3 and slightly lower TNF-\u03b1 at day 4 pi, although this difference was not statistically significant. Interestingly, levels of chemokines MCP-1 and RANTES were elevated in verdinexor-treated mice, although no significant increase in inflammatory cell recruitment was observed (Fig 2) . The type of BAL cells as determined by flow cytometry showed that verdinexor-treated mice had substantially lower immune cells infiltrates, in particular CD11c+Gr-1+ (granulocytes; p 0.001), CD3+ (T cells; p 0.05), DX5+ (NK cells; p 0.0001), and CD3+DX5+ (NKT cells; p 0.01) cells, but not CD11c+Gr-1-cells (dendritic cells and macrophages) (Fig 2) . Representative flow cytometry plots for day 4 pi BAL samples are presented in S2 Fig. Together , these findings support the therapeutic use of verdinexor, and are consistent with the interpretation of the prior study regarding verdinexor prophylactic treatment to limit lung influenza virus replication and the pulmonary inflammatory response in infected mice [18] .",

However, mice do not accurately emulate the clinical signs of IAV in humans, in contrast to the ferret model, which more closely emulates IAV disease pathogenesis [22, 23] . Furthermore, as in human, predominance of \u03b12,6-linkage sialic acid (SA) is found in the upper respiratory track of ferrets, whereas \u03b12,3 SA are more predominant in mice [23] . A pharmacokinetic (PK) study of oral verdinexor administration in ferrets was conducted to determine the feasibility of investigating the in vivo antiviral efficacy in ferrets (Fig 4a and Table 1 ). The study showed that verdinexor is orally bioavailable in ferrets, but was more rapidly cleared from the plasma compared to mice [18] . To address this, ferrets were dosed daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) for four days for a total of 4 or 8 doses, respectively, starting at 1 h prior to infection with A/California/04/09. Nasal washes were collected from infected ferrets at day 2 and 4 pi for cytology and evaluation of cytokines expression. Ferrets were sacrificed at day 4 pi and lungs were collected for evaluation of virus titers and pathology. The ferrets that received verdinexor at 15 mg/kg QD, 25 mg/kg QD, 10 mg/kg BID, or the standard oseltamivir treatment regimen showed considerably (p 0.001) reduced lung virus titers (Fig 4b) . Histopathology of the lungs revealed significant amelioration of influenza-associated lung pathology and inflammation in ferrets that received verdinexor at 25 mg/kg QD (p 0.05) or 10 mg/kg BID (p 0.01) (Fig 4c) . However, limited reduction in pathology was observed in ferrets that received lower verdinexor dose of 15 mg/ kg QD or oseltamivir. Representative histopathology slides and detailed pathology report are included in S3 Fig. To understand the effect of verdinexor on inflammatory responses associated with IAV, bronchoalveolar immune cell infiltration and cytokines expression was determined in ferret nasal washes. Lower numbers of infiltrating leukocytes were observed for all ferrets that received verdinexor or oseltamivir treatment at day 2 pi (p 0.001), while only ferrets receiving verdinexor at 25 mg/kg QD or 10 mg/kg BID showed significant (p 0.05) reduction at day 4 pi (Fig 5a) .",

            "text": "Together, these studies show that verdinexor is a potent inhibitor of IAV replication in vivo, which was shown in two animal models of IAV using the pandemic 2009 influenza virus strain. Furthermore, virus cultivation in the presence of sub-efficacious dose of verdinexor did not appear to result in the emergence of drug resistance. In this study, the in vivo late dosing result expands on the previously published findings on verdinexors antiviral efficacy in the mouse model [18] . As oseltamivir has to be administered within 48 hours of infection for its optimal effect [5] , this result also demonstrates the added advantage of verdinexor treatment when given late following infection. The current study also shows the multifaceted ability of verdinexor to ameliorate influenza-associated diseases, in which reductions of both lung virus titer and inflammation were observed in verdinexor-treated mice and ferrets. It is expected that these studies will serve as important stepping stones for future clinical evaluations of verdinexor for its anti-influenza indication in human. Further, other human pathogenic viruses have also been reported to co-opt the host's XPO1 pathway for nuclear exit, including the herpes simplex virus type-1 virus (HSV-1), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [24] [25] [26] . Thus, it is likely that verdinexor can also potentially inhibit replication of these viruses serving as a broad-spectrum antiviral. Verdinexor has been tested in a phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers and was found to be safe and well-tolerated (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02431364). Furthermore, a closely related SINE compound, selinexor (KPT-330) is currently undergoing multiple separate phase I and II studies in human patients with advanced, relapsed, and refractory cancers (such as Clinical-Trials.gov NCT01607905 and NCT01607892). Preliminary results from these studies demonstrated that selinexor is generally well tolerated, with good oral exposure and evidence of anticancer activity [27] [28] [29] , a finding which would also advocate for verdinexor's safety profile for its use in humans. collected. An aliquot of the supernatant was taken and diluted 1:100 to infect a new plate of A549 cells, while the rest was kept at -80\u02daC for the assessment of drug resistance. The virus was serially passaged 10 times in quadruplicate wells. At the conclusion of serial passaging experiment, passaged virus aliquots were thawed and titered by plaque assay. To assess potential drug resistance that may arise from serial passaging in subvirucidal dose of verdinexor, stock virus (WT), passage-2 (P2), -4 (P4), -6 (P6), -8 (P8), and -10 (P10) viruses were used to infect A549 cells that were pre-treated with DMSO (-; black bars) or with a virucidal dose of verdinexor (5 \u03bcM) (+; white bars) for 2 h at MOI = 0.01. At 48 hpi, viral titer in the supernatant was evaluated using the TCID 50 method (mean virus titer \u00b1 SEM). Virus cultured in the presence of sub-virucidal dose of verdinexor remained sensitive to 5 \u03bcM verdinexor, even after 10 passages (white bars in panel c). There was also an apparent overall reduction of viral growth and/or fitness in virus passaged in the presence of verdinexor (black bars in panel c). , thin alveolar septa, and empty alveoli were observed. b) Lung of non-treated, influenza-infected ferret: bronchioles were not readily identified due to necrosis of the wall and obliteration of the lumen by inflammation which spilled out into and filled alveoli. Moderate peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltration of mostly lymphocytes was present. This animal had a lung score of 4. c) Lung of infected ferret treated with 15 mg/kg QD Verdinexor: bronchiolar epithelium was partially necrotic and neutrophils and macrophages partially filled the lumen (B). Mild peribronchiolar and perivascular inflammation was present. Alveolar collapse and mild inflammation made the parenchyma appear consolidated (A). This animal had a lung score of 2. D. d) Lung of infected ferret treated with 25 mg/kg QD Verdinexor: the bronchiolar epithelium was mostly necrotic and the lumen filled with neutrophils and macrophages (B) that were also found in the surrounding alveoli. Moderate peribronchiolar and perivascular inflammation of mostly lymphocytes was present. Alveolar septa were slightly thickened. This animal had a lung score of 2. e) Lung of infected ferret treated with 10 mg/kg BID Verdinexor: the bronchiole (B) was lined by hyperplastic epithelium and there was mild peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltration of mostly lymphocytes. Alveolar involvement was not present. This animal had a lung score of 2. f) Lung of Oseltamivir-treated infected ferret: a bronchiole was lined by hyperplastic epithelium and the lumen filled with neutrophils and macrophages admixed with lymphocytes (B) which spilled out into surrounding alveoli. There was mild peribronchiolar and perivascular inflammation of mostly lymphocytes. Alveolar septa were thickened by mild type-II cell hyperplasia and a small number of neutrophils and mononuclear cells were present in the alveoli (A). This animal had a lung score of 3.
