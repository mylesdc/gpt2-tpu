DpCPV has a genome consisting of 10 linear double-stranded RNA segments. To establish a reverse genetics system, we cloned cDNAs encoding the 10 genomic segments of DpCPV into three reverse genetics vectors in which each segment was transcribed under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and terminator tagged with a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence. We also constructed a vp80-knockout Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus bacmid to express a T7 RNA polymerase codon-optimized for Sf9 cells. Following transfection of Sf9 cells with the three vectors and the bacmid, occlusion bodies (OBs) with the typical morphology of cypovirus polyhedra were observed by optical microscopy. The rescue system was verified by incorporation of a HindIII restriction enzyme site null mutant of the 9th genomic segment. Furthermore, when we co-transfected Sf9 cells with the reverse genetics vectors, the bacmid, and an additional vector bearing an egfp gene flanked with the 5 and 3 untranslated regions of the 10th genomic segment, aggregated green fluorescence co-localizing with the OBs was observed. The rescued OBs were able to infect Spodopetra exigua larvae, although their infectivity was significantly lower than that of wild-type DpCPV. This reverse genetics system for DpCPV could be used to explore viral replication and pathogenesis and to facilitate the development of novel bio-insecticides and expression systems for exogenous proteins.",

The icosahedral virions are embedded within a characteristic crystalline occlusion body (OB), which is formed by the polyhedrin protein encoded by the viral genome [3, 4] . In the highly alkaline environment of the midgut, the OBs are cleaved to release virions which can infect midgut epithelial cells, resulting in delayed growth and even death of the infected larvae. During the period of illness and disease, the virus is continuously excreted in the feces and infects other healthy insects. CPV can also be passed on to the next generation of insects, contributing to a viral epidemic in the pest population [5] . Dendrolimus punctatus cypovirus (DpCPV) is a pathogen of D. punctatus and is considered the most destructive pest of pine forests worldwide [6] . DpCPV can infect 35 insect species spanning 10 Lepidoptera families [6] . This species has been applied in commercial insecticides to control the pine caterpillar, D. punctatus, since 1970 in Japan [7] and since 2010 in China [8] .",

Only one or two rotavirus genomic fragments could be replaced with other viral genes from different species [19] . In 2007, Kobayashi et al. developed an entirely plasmid-based reverse genetics system for animal double-stranded RNA viruses by co-transfecting murine L929 fibroblast cells with 10 plasmids encoding gene segments of mammalian orthoreovirus cDNAs flanked by the T7 RNA promoter and hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence (HDV Rib) and a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 polymerase [20] . Several years later, an improved reverse genetics system for mammalian orthoreoviruses was developed by cloning the cDNAs encoding multiple reovirus genome segments into a few plasmids, reducing the number of recombinant vectors required from 10 to 4 and improving the efficiency of virus recovery [21] . Subsequently, other reoviruses, such as rotavirus [22] and bluetongue virus [23] , were successfully recovered using a similar approach. Recently, it has been demonstrated that rotavirus can be rescued by overexpression of some viral genes without the need for a helper plasmid [24] . An RNA-based reverse genetics system for BmCPV was developed by co-transfection of cultured BmN cells with in vitro-transcribed S1-S10 RNA segments [25] .",

Briefly, the vector and insert were PCR-amplified with 16-base terminal overlapping sequences. After digesting the mixture of amplified vector and insert with DpnI to eliminate the DNA template used in the PCR reaction, competent cells were directly transformed with the mixture.

To distinguish the rescued DpCPVs from DpCPV-WT, a HindIII restriction enzyme site null mutation was incorporated into the DpCPV S9 cDNA (G to T at nucleotide 395) to produce the pBS-S10-S7-S1-S9M vector (Figure 3) . RNA polymerase terminator cassette were combined into single plasmids, creating three constructs for the reverse genetics systems of rDpCPV or rDpCPV-S9M (see Figure S1C ). The single nucleotide difference in S9 unique to rDpCPV-S9M and DpCPV is shown in the alignment as an asterisk. The T/G substitution at position 395 was a deliberate change engineered into the cloned DpCPV S9 cDNA fragment used as a marker for rescue. Sf9 cells were co-transfected with the three plasmids (pBS-S10-S7-S1-S9, pBS-S6-S5-S3 and pBS-S8-S4-S2) along with AcBac-T7pol-\u2206vp80.

To investigate if DpCPV could encapsulate exogenous RNA segments, a recombinant virus containing an exogenous egfp gene was rescued using the methods described above. The T-S10UTR-egfp DNA segment was constructed by replacing the ORF region of DpCPV S10 in the T-DpCPV-S10 vector with the egfp gene ( Figure 5A ). At 2 days post-co-transfection of Sf9 cells with T-S10UTR-egfp, three vectors (pBS-S10-S7-S1-S9M, pBS-S6-S5-S3 and pBS-S8-S4-S2) and AcBac-T7pol-\u2206vp80, green fluorescence was observed in some cells under a fluorescence microscope. OBs could be observed at 7 days post-transfection, and some OBs co-localized with green fluorescence ( Figure 5B ). After three passages in S. exigua larvae, the viruses purified from the midgut were called rDpCPV-egfp P1, rDpCPV-egfp P2 and rDpCPV-egfp P3, respectively. Though a large number of OBs were collected and their morphology was identical to DpCPV-WT, green fluorescence could not be observed under the fluorescence microscope, indicating EGFP was not incorporated into the OBs. The specific gene markers (modified at HindIII site of the S9) of rDpCPV-egfp were also confirmed via the methods above. The RNA bands isolated from the OBs were consistent with those of DpCPV-WT, while the cDNA of the S9M fragments could not be digested by HindIII. Schematic representation of the T-S10UTR-egfp vector in which the ORF of the DpCPV S10 genome was replaced with the egfp gene.

Initially we tried to construct an insect cell line that stably expressed T7 polymerase, but due to the large size of the protein, we found that it could not be fully transcribed and expressed by several promoters (e.g., OpIE-1 [36] , OpIE-2 [37] , Drosophila metallothionein [38] , Densoviral P9 [39] ). Therefore, a helper virus like the recombinant vaccinia virus was adapted for expression of T7 polymerase. After transfection of Sf9 cells with AcBac-P PH -T7pol-P T7 -mCherry and infection with helper virus, the red fluorescence indicated that T7 polymerase could be expressed under the polyhedrin promoter, indicating that it might recognize and initiate transcription of reporter genes in Sf9 cells ( Figure 1B) . In reverse genetics systems using recombinant vaccinia virus as a helper virus, the helper virus can be removed from the rescued virus by differential temperature sensitivity or cellular tropism. It has been reported that the vp80-knockout bacmid does not produce infectious baculoviruses, and does not affect expression of exogenous genes [34] . Thus, we utilized AcBac-T7pol-\u2206vp80 to express the T7 polymerase to diminish the effects of the baculovirus (Figure 2A ). Using FastCloning technology, 10 DpCPV cDNA fragments were constructed in three vectors (Figure 3 ). DpCPVs were rescued by co-transfecting Sf9 cells with the vectors and AcBac-T7pol-\u2206vp80. By morphological comparison and detection of genetic markers, we have developed a robust and efficient reverse genetics system for DpCPV ( Figure 5 ).",

In this system, the LC 50 s (95% CI) of DpCPV-WT and rDpCPV viruses were 2.47 (0.97-8.06) and 25.7 (7.6-75.3) \u00d7 10 6 OBs/mL, which is in accord with the rescued RNA viruses mentioned above. In this study, more than 60% S. exigua larvae survived after treatment with rDpCPV-S9M (1 \u00d7 10 8 OBs/mL) or rDpCPV-egfp (3 \u00d7 10 8 OBs/mL). According to the RT-qPCR and TEM results, there was no significant difference in the copy numbers of viral nucleic acids ( Figure 6B ) and the ratio of solid particles (Table 3) among the rescued and wild-type viruses, indicating that rDpCPVs contain the same genomic sequences as the wild-type DpCPV, while its virulence is much lower than that of wild-type DpCPV. For rDpCPV and rDpCPV-S9M, the mutation of S9 to S9M in the ORF region did not affect genome assembly. Through RNA structure prediction, we found that the S9M caused a structural change of the RNA segment, which may have caused the decline in virulence. We speculate that this structural region may be involved in some viral processes, but the specific mechanisms need further study. Though the virulence of rDpCPV-S9M was lower than that of rDpCPV, the S9M null-mutation was used to confirm the rescue system worked correctly, did not contaminated by wild-type DpCPV.",

The DpCPV genome consists of 10 dsRNA segments, while the capsid contains 12 turrets, and thus we speculated that the capsid could accommodate more foreign genes. When T-S10UTR-egfp was added to the transfected mixture, co-localization of green fluorescence and OBs was observed in transfected Sf9 cells by fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 5B ). However, no green fluorescence was observed in OBs purified from the midguts of S. exigua larvae. The assembly of CPV particles may adapt a precise mechanism, thus it was not proposed that the exogenous EGFP might be incorporated into virions or OBs. We speculate that the egfp RNA was encapsulated in the virions as an extra fragment and that the gene could be expressed in Sf9 cells. The RT-qPCR results showed that some of the egfp genetic material was indeed encapsulated into rDpCPV-egfp particles, whereas not every rDpCPV virion encapsulated an additional gene. The ratio of the egfp to S2 gene RNA segment copy number in rDpCPV-P1 was 14.37%, indicating that virions containing egfp accounted for 14.37% of the total, and this ratio decreased significantly in successive passages. We speculate that this reduction was due to the lack of resistance screening during passages. There was no significant difference in the copy number of the S10 gene between rDpCPV from P1 to P3 ( Figure 5C ). Though the untranslated regions (UTRs) of T-S10UTR-egfp and S10 were identical, they were not competitively encapsulated in virions. The UTRs of rotaviruses have been shown to be key regions for recognition of viral genes packaged into virions [41] . When we replaced the ORF regions of S1-S10 with the egfp gene, we found that the predicted RNA structure of the UTR region did not change when the S2 and S10 ORF regions were replaced ( Figure S2 ). When the ORF region of the S2 gene was replaced with the egfp gene, co-localization of OBs and green fluorescence could also be observed in cells. The plasmids where egfp replaced the ORF region of the other DpCPV fragments were constructed and performed similarly in co-transfections. However, although OBs could be observed for the S7 and S9 substitution, no co-localization of green fluorescence and OBs was observed ( Figure S3 ).",
