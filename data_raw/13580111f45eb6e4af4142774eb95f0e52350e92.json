No filtering of host/bacterial reads was performed before assembly. All assembled contigs were compared to the entire nonredundant nucleotide (nt) and protein (nr) database using blastn and diamond blast (7), respectively, setting an e-value threshold of 1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 to remove potential false positives.

Briefly, contigs greater than 1000bp in length were inspected using Geneious R10 (Biomatters, New Zealand), and open reading frames corresponding to predicted genome architectures based on the closest reference genomes were interrogated. Reads were subsequently mapped back to viral contigs to identify mis-assembly using bowtie2 (8) . Viruses with full length genomes, or incomplete genomes that possess the full-length RNA-dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, were used for phylogenetic analysis. Sequences of the polyprotein or gene encoding for the RdRp were aligned using MAFFT (9) , and gaps and ambiguously aligned regions were stripped using trimAL (10). Final alignment lengths for each data set are presented in Table S2 . The most appropriate amino acid substitution model was then determined for each data set, and maximum likelihood trees were estimated using PhyML 3.0 (11) with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Novel viral species were identified as those that had <90% RdRp protein identity, or <80% genome identity to previously described viruses.",
