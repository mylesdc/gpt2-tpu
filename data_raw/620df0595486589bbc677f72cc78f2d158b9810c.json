            "text": "Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The main cause of the MS is yet to be revealed, but the most probable theory is based on the molecular mimicry that concludes some infections in the activation of T cells against brain auto-antigens that initiate the disease cascade. Objectives: The Purpose of this research is the prediction of the auto-antigen potency of the myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) in multiple sclerosis. Materials and Methods: As there wasn't any tertiary structure of PLP available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and in order to characterize the structural properties of the protein, we modeled this protein using prediction servers. Meta prediction method, as a new perspective in silico, was performed to fi nd PLPs epitopes. For this purpose, several T cell epitope prediction web servers were used to predict PLPs epitopes against Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). The overlap regions, as were predicted by most web servers were selected as immunogenic epitopes and were subjected to the BLASTP against microorganisms. Results: Three common regions, AA 58-74 , AA 161-177, and AA 238-254 were detected as immunodominant regions through meta-prediction. Investigating peptides with more than 50% similarity to that of candidate epitope AA 58-74 in bacteria showed a similar peptide in bacteria (mainly consistent with that of clostridium and mycobacterium) and spike protein of Alphacoronavirus 1, Canine coronavirus, and Feline coronavirus. These results suggest that cross reaction of the immune system to PLP may have originated from a bacteria or viral infection, and therefore molecular mimicry might have an important role in the progression of MS. Conclusions: Through reliable and accurate prediction of the consensus epitopes, it is not necessary to synthesize all PLP fragments and examine their immunogenicity experimentally (in vitro). In this study, the best encephalitogenic antigens were predicted based on bioinformatics tools that may provide reliable results for researches in a shorter time and at a lower cost.",

            "text": "As the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic infl ammatory demyelinating health problem of the CNS which leads to the neurological disability in young adults (1) (2) (3) . In MS, T cells attack the myelin sheath of the neurons in the CNS, destroying the myelin and the axons (4). The Etiology of MS is unknown, but the most probable theory is based on the molecular mimicry that establishes a number of infections which can activate T cells and initiate the disease's cascade. In this model, induced auto-aggressive T cells are followed by structural similarity between microbial epitopes and self-peptides. Therefore, Molecular mimicry can break self-tolerance and induce autoimmune responses. In T cell mediated auto-immunities, transfer of activated T cell to the animal models can lead to autoimmunity. It is noteworthy that there are some auto-antigens in the brain including Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG), alpha-beta crystalline, and heat shock proteins that induce T cell reactivity and play a crucial role in commencing MS (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) .",

T cell reactivity to brain auto-antigens, particularly myelin antigens, plays a crucial role for commencing of the MS (5, 6). Molecular mimicry is also known as \"crossreactivity\" between self-antigens and immunodominant epitopes of the pathogens. Cross-reactivity can be the cause of many autoimmune disorders such as myasthenia gravis which occurs due to detectable antibodies produced against the human acetylcholine receptor. Cross-reactivity of the self-epitope with the antibodies produced against herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D suggests that the virus is associated with the initiation of myasthenia gravis (33) . Schloot et al. in 2001 have shown that isolated T cells from type 1 diabetes patients which are reactive to glutamic acid decarboxylase65 (GAD65) cross-react with the Coxsackie virus protein P2C and pro-insulin protein (34) .",

Such systematic approaches are mainly needed for the prediction of the immunogenic epitopes which have high homology with the microorganisms.

By reliable and accurate prediction of the consensus epitopes, it is not necessary to synthesize all PLP fragments and examine their immunogenicity experimentally (in vitro). Therefore, researchers can achieve better results in a shorter time and at a lower cost. Besides, they could check if the consensus predicted epitopes have a cross reaction with the foreign particles, immunotherapeutic regimens, and gain a better understanding of the mechanism of MS diseases. This approach allows the development of peptide-based pharmacotherapy for MS and promises for personalized medicine in future.",
