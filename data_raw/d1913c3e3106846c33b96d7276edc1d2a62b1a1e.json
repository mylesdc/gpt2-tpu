The gut is considered to be the ''motor'' driving MOF [5] [6] [7] because hemorrhagic shock reduces intestinal mucosal blood perfusion that leads to intestinal mucosal barrier damage, intestinal barrier dysfunction, ectopic flora, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, and finally MOF [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Clinical studies have revealed that traumatic hemorrhagic shock patients with MOF display significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6) than those without MOF [14] , and animal experiments have shown that severe system inflammation is strongly related with prolonged hemorrhagic shock [15] .",

As a result, the blood lactate concentration at T3 was lower than that at T2 in the medium BP group (P, 0.05) and the low BP group (P,0.05). In the medium and low BP groups, serum lactate displayed an ''increase after shock and decrease after resuscitation'' trend.",

Particularly in battlefields and remote areas, hemorrhagic shock patients miss the optimal window for resuscitation, often resulting in MOF and death [1] . Based on the observation that leukocyte activation occurs three to six hours following traumatic hemorrhagic shock [16] , we proposed three hours of hemorrhagic shock as an absolute minimum window for prolonged hemorrhagic shock. On this basis, a prolonged hemorrhagic shock animal model was constructed with two different levels of shock BP. We found that hemorrhagic shock could be prolonged to three hours if and only if the shock BP was maintained above 30 mm Hg (data not reported). As expected, under the two different BP conditions (41 to 50 mm Hg and 31 to 40 mm Hg), the lower the hemorrhagic shock BP, the more severe the hemorrhagic shock following fluid resuscitation. Both shock BP and BP after resuscitation in the low BP group were significantly lower than in the medium BP group.",

Chiu's score showed that the severity of intestinal mucosal damage in the low BP groups was significantly greater than those in the medium BP or control groups. Tight junction proteins, such as claudin-1, are critical structural proteins for maintaining mucosal barrier function [33] , and claudin-1's aberrant expression directly impairs mucosal barrier function. Here, intestinal claudin-1 expression in the low BP group was significantly lower than that in the medium BP group, which, in turn, was significantly lower than that in the control group. This indicator of impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function is consistent with intestinal mucosa damage. Thus, in the prolonged hemorrhagic shock model, a more severe shock appears to induce a more severe intestinal injury.",

It is widely accepted that lactate is a clinical indicator of the degree of traumatic hemorrhagic shock [46] . Physiologically, increases in lactate levels typically demonstrate tissue hypoperfusion and/or increases in anaerobic metabolism [47] . Our results showed that, after hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion, lactate levels were still significantly higher than normal, but there was a notable decrease in lactate levels. The reasons for this decline in lactate levels are speculated to be: (i) upon fluid resuscitation, blood perfusion improves, which in turn, improves oxygen delivery and aerobic metabolism, thereby lowering circulating lactate levels; and (ii) upon fluid resuscitation, blood volume increases, thereby lowering lactic acid levels by dilution. That being said, these changes in lactate levels did not correlate with the organ damage after prolonged hemorrhagic shock resuscitation. However, statistical analysis did indicate the change in serum DAO was correlated with the change in TNF-a, which reveals serum DAO may be a potential indicator of the severity of prolonged hemorrhagic shock.",
