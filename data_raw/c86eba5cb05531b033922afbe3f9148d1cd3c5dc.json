The branch length proportions and the transition/transversion rate ratio \u03ba were estimated by pooling the data within each class, and only an overall scale factor for branch lengths (\u00b5) and the selection parameters (\u03c9 0 , \u03c9 1 , p 0 , p 1 ) were estimated per gene. This strategy was intended to improve computational efficiency, by substantially decreasing the number of parameters to be estimated per gene. It also had the potential to increase the power of the test, by reducing the number of degrees of freedom in the LRT. However, if the assumptions of equal branch-length proportions and equal \u03ba values per G+C class are not well-supported by the data, it could potentially lead to inflated false-positive rates and/or reduced power. Here, we investigate by simulation whether or not this parameterization influences either the power or the false-positive rates of the LRTs.",

We stored these sets of parameter estimates, along with the length of each alignment, in a list L C for each G+C class C. We then sampled parameter sets (with replacement) 2,000 times from each list L C and used them to generate six-species synthetic alignments with evolver [9] , assuming a constant \u03c9 among lineages and sites (model M0). This process was repeated for several different values of \u03c9, so that no assumption about the distribution of this parameter was required. Thus, for each G+C class and each \u03c9 we obtained 2,000 simulated data sets, with lengths, branch-length proportions, and \u03ba values reflecting those of the corresponding G+C class in the original data set.",

Each synthetic gene was then predicted as a PSG if its (empirical) P -value was less than a designated threshold, and a non-PSG otherwise. The fraction of genes predicted to be PSGs (the sensitivity or power for \u03c9 > 1 and the false positive rate for \u03c9 \u2264 1) was then plotted as a function of \u03c9, separately for strategies (i) and (ii) (Fig. S8) . These experiments indicated that pooling by G+C class has almost no effect on the sensitivity or specificity of the test. Similar results are seen if sensitivity and specificity are examined together in a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Fig. S9) .

Figure S10 shows that the \u03c7 2 -based P -values are generally conservative for both LRTs. This is true even when a 50:50 mixture of a \u03c7 2 df =1 distribution and point mass at zero is used; \u03c7 2 df =1 and \u03c7 2 df =2 distributions are more conservative. Thus, the use of the approximation will not produce an inflated false positive rate, but it could result in some spurious false negatives. Nevertheless, we find that the approximation has little effect on the set of PSGs identified for the analysis. If the empirical P -values are used in place of the \u03c7 2 -based P -values, the number of identified PSGs changes only by four (primate clade) or two (macaque branch).",

For example, if genes in the \"sensory perception of smell\" category are significantly more likely than other genes to have full six-species alignments (as opposed to alignments of three, four, or five species, due to recent duplication, low sequence quality, etc.), then an enrichment for PSGs in this category might simply reflect an increase in power for PSG detection.",

We found that there are significant differences in the functional categories of high-and low-depth genes, but these differences cannot explain the PSG enrichments. In particular, the categories that are over-represented among highdepth genes generally relate to housekeeping and development functions, and are essentially disjoint with the PSG-enriched categories. Many of the PSG-enriched categories relating to sensory perception are actually quite strongly enriched in low-depth genes, for which the power to detect positive selection will be reduced-a trend that runs in the opposite direction of what would be required for the PSG enrichments to be an artifact of differences in power. Accordingly, if the analysis of functional enrichments for PSGs is redone with just the high-depth genes, the immunity and defense categories still are found to be highly enriched. The sensory perception genes are no longer significantly enriched, but this is probably because there are many fewer of them among the high-depth genes. In summary, we find no evidence that the observed enrichments for PSGs are related to differences in detection power due to alignment depth. Recent duplication likely contributes to the enrichments for sensory perception among both PSGs and low-depth genes.",

We examined this possibility in two ways. First, if gene length were driving the detection of PSGs, then a pronounced difference in the length distributions of PSGs and non-PSGs would be expected. In fact, these distributions are highly similar (Fig. S11 ) and the null hypothesis that both sets of lengths are drawn from the same distribution cannot be rejected (P = 0.33, one-sided MWU). This suggests that it is unlikely that length is a dominant factor in the analysis. Second, we examined the length distributions of the enriched categories of genes (Table 2) , to see whether gene length might be an important factor for particular categories of interest. By a MWU test comparing the length distribution within each category with that of other genes, most categories enriched for PSGs did not contain significantly longer genes than other categories. Indeed, seven PSG-enriched categories-including 'cytokine activity,' 'olfactory receptor activity,' and 'response to bacterium'-showed a significant shift toward shorter genes in their length distributions. However, there were two categories of genes-'integral to membrane' and 'transmembrane receptor activity' (marked by asterisks in Table 2 )-that did show significant shifts toward longer genes, and it is possible that the enrichments for these GO categories are influenced by increased detection power. These categories have not been discussed at length in the paper, and this finding of a possible bias does not alter the main conclusions of our functional analysis.",

In addition, it is likely that our six-species data set would provide only weak information about mid-branch gains and losses. Instead, our model attempts to exploit the discrete-branch nature of the Yang-Nielsen branch-site models, by defining a simple switching process that induces a probability distribution over the finite set of selection histories considered by those models.

A single early switch point is sufficient for external branches. To see why two switches are needed, suppose only early switches are allowed (i.e., a switch is possible at the ancestral end of each branch). Such a model will allow any selection history to be determined by a set of switches (each branch is simply switched \"on\" or \"off,\" as necessary, to be consistent with a given history), but the set of switches will not be parsimonious. The problem arises when the branch ancestral to an internal node has one selective mode and the two branches that descend from the node have the other selective mode. In this case, it is far more plausible biologically that a single change in selection occurred soon before the divergence of the descendant species, than that two independent (and convergent) events occurred in the descendant species, as will be required by the early-switch model. Redefining the model so that events occur late rather than early does not solve the problem, because this requires that both descendant branches always have the same mode, and therefore cannot capture all histories. Allowing a single switch at the midpoint of each branch also is problematic, because it leads to branches that are only partly under selection, which is not compatible with the Yang-Nielsen models. The introduction of early and late switch points allows all selection histories to be explained parsimoniously, in a way that is fully compatible with a discrete-branch selection model.",

Even more unlikely, three switches could be introduced in place of zero switches, where all three branches adjoining an internal node have the same selective mode. To address this problem, we invoke the parsimony principle, and select the history with the fewest switches (which is unique; see below). We justify this decision by noting that all nonparsimonious scenarios require at least one additional switch within the set of switch points surrounding a single internal node. Thus, these scenarios represent cases of multiple rare events occuring during a short time period, and it is reasonable to assume that their probabilities are quite small.",

Because the tree is believed to be rooted on the branch to dog (e.g., [12] ), and the primaterodent and (primate,rodent)-dog divergences are believed to have occurred relatively near one another in evolutionary time (making the branch between the corresponding nodes in the phylogeny fairly short), we address this problem by treating the primate-rodent most recent common ancestor as the root of the tree, and all three adjoining branches as descendants.",

Specifically, suppose FP rates for PSG detection are higher among non-PSGs with \u03c9 \u2248 1 than for those with \u03c9 1. In addition, suppose true PSGs are more likely to be detected if their background sites have higher average \u03c9 values, resulting in higher average \u03c9 for the genes as a whole. Finally, suppose there is a strong negative correlation between \u03c9 and expression level, and a strong positive correlation between \u03c9 and tissue bias, as has been widely reported (e.g., [15] )-but suppose that this relationship can be explained completely in terms of background sites, and reflects no dependency on positive selection. In such a case, the argument goes, FPs among the PSGs would be enriched for decreased expression and increased tissue bias, and false negatives (FNs) among the non-PSGs would be enriched for increased expression and decreased tissue bias, leading to an artifactual difference in expression levels and patterns between the two classes of genes.",

Instead, we used a simple, conservative method to eliminate FPs showing low expression (or high tissue bias; these attributes were handled separately) and FNs showing high expression (or low tissue bias). We divided the genes into classes of \"low\" and \"high\" expression level (tissue bias), and then defined a new set of PSGs by using a very stringent P -value threshold for low-expression (high-bias) genes (FDR < 0.01) and a considerably less stringent threshold for high-expression (low-bias) genes (FDR < 0.1). Thus, the low-expression (high-bias) PSGs most likely to be false positives were transferred to the non-PSG set, and the high-expression (low-bias) non-PSGs most likely to be false negatives were transferred to the PSG set. This procedure is conservative in that it necessarily diminishes the difference in expression levels and patterns between the two sets. The analysis was based on the results of the all-branch test, as was the main analysis of expression levels and patterns. The genes were partitioned into classes of \"low\" and \"high\" expression based on their median (across the 11 tissues) RMA-based expression levels, with the median of this value across all genes serving as the cutoff (i.e., the \"low\" and \"high\" classes were equal in size). Similar results were obtained using the maximum expression level across tissues for each gene, and using the expression level measured from a tissue mixture. The genes were partitioned into classes of \"low\" and \"high\" tissue-bias in a similar way based on the \u03c4 statistic.",

That is, if genes that show a bias for expression in particular tissues have reduced average expression, and if the choice of tissue is randomly distributed across genes, then an overall reduction in the average expression level for each tissue would result. The question remains, then, whether PSGs show reduced expression levels not only on average, but in the tissues in which their expression is favored. To address this question, we found the maximum expression level across the 11 tissues for each gene, and then compared the distributions of these values for PSGs and non-PSGs. By this comparison, PSGs still show significantly lower expression levels than non-PSGs (P = 3.6 \u00d7 10 \u22126 ; data not shown), although the difference is considerably less pronounced than for certain individual tissues such as cerebellum, muscle, and thyroid (Fig. S7) . Thus, differences in tissue bias may partly explain differences in expression level, but the explanation does not appear to be complete.
