However, modulation of the access of immune cells to the CNS is associated with impaired immune surveillance and detrimental viral infections of the CNS. Here, we explored the potency of cellular immune responses within the CNS to protect against viral encephalitis in mice with T cell conditional disruption of VLA-4 integrin (\u03b14\u03b21) expression. Results: While VLA-4 expression in virus specific Th1 cells is non-redundant for their ability to access the CNS, \u03b14-integrin deficient Th17 cells enter the CNS compartment and generate an inflammatory milieu upon intrathecal vaccinia virus (VV) infection. However, in contrast to Th1 cells that can adopt direct cytotoxic properties, Th17 cells fail to clear the virus due to insufficient Eomes induced perforin-1 expression.",

In particular, monoclonal antibodies (natalizumab) to the \u03b14 subunit of the integrin VLA-4 (\u03b14\u03b21 heterodimer) were successfully used to prevent the influx of immune cells into the CNS and to treat CNS autoimmunity [3] .

The contribution of CD4 + vs CD8 + effector memory T cells in the migratory and resident pools of lymphocytes specific to a given pathogen has been investigated in skin infection but is unclear in the CNS [6] . In the treatment of organ specific autoimmunity and chronic inflammation, efforts are increasing to market compounds that either inhibit immune cell trafficking [7] [8] [9] [10] or cytokine networks that affect distinct T helper cell subsets in a differential manner (anti-IL-23p19, anti-IL-17A [11, 12] , anti-GM-CSF (NCT01517282), anti-IL-6R [13] ). However, preclinical models to investigate niche specific immune surveillance and host defense in the CNS are rare.

We chose vaccinia virus (VV) infection where the importance of virus specific T helper cell responses has been analyzed previously [15, 16] . Vaccinated mice were found to be protected from intrathecal (i.th.) infection with VV due to cellular immunity. In the absence of CD8 + T cells, Th1 like cells were sufficient to protect mice from intrathecal VV infection. Access of Th1 cells into the infected CNS compartment was dependent on VLA-4 expression. Although virus specific Th17 cells were able to migrate into the CNS in the absence of VLA-4, CNS recruited and infected macrophages were not cleared by Th17 cells since Th17 cellsin contrast to Th1 cellswere deficient in perforin-1 expression. These data highlight a dominant role of Th1 cells in antiviral tissue-specific immunity. Our data further suggest that as in autoimmune inflammation of the CNS, virus specific Th1 cells are dependent on VLA-4 to enter into the CNS and virus infection does not overcome the requirement for Th1 cells to express VLA-4. Thus, integrin targeted therapeutic interventions in autoimmunity and chronic inflammation need to be refined in order to not jeopardize organ specific immune surveillance and host protection.",

Importantly, infected CD11b + CD45 high macrophages expressed MHC class II ( Figure 2B ). Thus, phagocytic cells were recruited from the systemic compartment in response to i.th.

VV infection, we immunized wild type mice with a replication deficient strain of VV (MVA) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) 10 days prior to i.th. challenge with VV. CFA induces both Th1 and Th17 responses. Here, we were interested in investigating the role of these T helper cell subsets in the trade-off between host protection and immunopathology during infectious encephalitis. While sham-immunized mice died at day 6 after infection and largely failed to recruit either CD4 + T helper cells or VV-specific CTLs into the CNS compartment ( Figure 3A ,B), MVA immunized animals harbored both antigen specific CTLs and CD4 + T cells in the CNS and recovered from VV encephalitis ( Figure 3A -C). While CTLs re-isolated from the CNS largely produced IFN-\u03b3, the intrathecal CD4 + effector T cell compartment comprised IFN-\u03b3 producers, IL-17 producers, and IFN-\u03b3/IL-17 double producers ( Figure 3C ).

Here, we took advantage of the differential integrin requirement for the recruitment of Th1 cells vs Th17 cells into the CNS compartment. In the EAE model, Th1 cells depend on \u03b14-integrins in order to enter into the CNS during autoimmune inflammation. In contrast, Th17 cells are able to access the CNS compartment independently of \u03b14-integrins using an LFA-1 dependent mechanism [4] . Here, we treated our MVA immunized mice with blocking antibodies to integrin \u03b14 (PS/2) prior to i.th. VV challenge ( Figure 4A ). Notably, MVA immune mice survived i.th. VV infection in spite of integrin \u03b14 blockade ( Figure 4A ). As expected, we found a relative abundance of IL-17 producing T cells as compared with IFN-\u03b3 positive T helper cells ( Figure 4B ). This finding supported the idea thatsimilar to T cell recruitment in autoimmune inflammation of the CNS -Th1 cells and Th17 cells exhibited distinct integrin requirements for their entry into CNS in the context of a local virus infection. Interestingly, while the absolute number of CD4 + T cells was reduced in the CNS, which was largely due to the reduction of IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4 + effector T cells, the number of CTLs recruited to the CNS compartment was not significantly reduced in anti-integrin \u03b14 treated mice ( Figure 4C ). Thus, integrin \u03b14 mediated mechanisms appeared to be redundant for the recruitment of effector CD8 + T cells into the infected CNS.",

Yet, intracerebral reconstitution of CD4 + effector T helper cell responses has been proposed to be necessary for efficient clearance of various viruses from the CNS including JC virus [25] . We wanted to dissect the essential features of an intracerebral T helper cell response that would be able to control viral infection. Thus, we combined a system of T cell conditional ablation of \u03b14-integrin expression (CD4 Cre + x Itga4 flox/flox mice, \u03b14 CKO mice) with antibody mediated depletion of CD8 + T cells in order to investigate the differential contribution of Th1 cells vs Th17 cells to host protection in CNS infection in the absence of CTLs. To exclude possible alterations in priming of antigen specific T helper cell responses in the peripheral immune compartment of \u03b14 CKO mice, we compared the fractions of antigen specific T cells on day 10 after subcutaneous immunization with MVA/CFA in the spleens of CD4 Crex Itga4 flox/flox (wild type control) versus CD4 Cre + x Itga4 flox/flox (\u03b14 CKO) mice (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). Upon ex vivo restimulation with I-A b restricted VV epitopes, the fractions of antigen specific (CD40L + ) CD4 + T cells and their cytokine profile were similar in wild type vs \u03b14 CKO mice. Moreover, the anti-VV neutralizing serum response was equally effective in both groups on day 10 after immunization (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). Thus, sensitization for adaptive cellular immune responses against VV in draining lymph nodes and spleen was not impaired by the lack of \u03b14-integrins on T cells.",

Naive OT-II cells were differentiated in vitro into Th1 cells or Th17 cells followed by transfer into Rag1 -/mice, which had been infected intrathecally with VV-Ova one day prior to adoptive transfer ( Figure 6 ).

VV infection due to lack of perforin-1 expression It was possible that the reduced capacity of Th17 cells to provide host protection in intrathecal VV infection was simply due to reduced availability of IFN-\u03b3 within the CNS compartment. In order to test this possibility, we neutralized IFN-\u03b3 by monoclonal antibodies in MVA immune and CD8 + T cell depleted wild type mice (Additional file 2: Figure S2 ). In this purely T helper cell dependent scenario, VV specific Th1 and Th17 cells were generated and had access to the VV challenged CNS. Notably, the mice recovered from VV encephalitis despite ablation of IFN-\u03b3. Efficiency of IFN-\u03b3 blockade was documented by reduced levels of MHC class II expression on microglial cells in the CNS compartment (Additional file 2: Figure S2 ). These data suggested that IFN-\u03b3 was redundant as an effector molecule in the clearance of intrathecal VV infection and refuted the idea that diminished IFN-\u03b3 expression by Th17 cells Figure 3 Immunization with modified VV Ankara (MVA) confers protective immunity against viral encephalitis. Wild type mice were immunized subcutaneously with a replication deficient strain of VV (Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara, MVA) or PBS emulsified in complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA).

CD4 + effector T cells expressed Tnf, Grzmb, and Fasl irrespective of whether they were derived from the Th1 biased inflammatory infiltrate of wild type mice or from the Th17 biased inflammatory milieu of \u03b14 CKO mice. In contrast, the expression of perforin-1 (Prf1) was markedly reduced in \u03b14-integrin deficient as compared with wild type T helper cells. In order to correlate lack of Prf1 expression with the Th17 transcriptional program, we purified CD3 + CD4 + CD44 -Foxp3na\u00efve T cells from Foxp3gfp.KI mice and stimulated them without exogenous cytokines (Th0) or differentiated them into Th1 cells or Th17 cells ( Figure 7B ). Consistent with our in vivo data, we found a significant reduction in Prf1 mRNA and protein in Th17 as compared with Th1 and Th0 cells. Notably, protein expression of Prf1 was only seen at late time points ( Figure 7B ). Since expression of Prf1 has been reported to depend on the expression of the transcription factor eomesodermin (Eomes) [26] , we measured RNA levels of Eomes in CD4 + T cells isolated from brains of VV infected wild type and \u03b14 CKO mice. Consistent with the low expression of Prf1 in Th17 cells, Eomes mRNA levels were reduced in CD4 + T cells isolated from \u03b14 CKO mice as compared with wild type controls ( Figure 7C ). To formally validate whether reduced Eomes expression in Th17 cells accounted for diminished Prf1 expression as compared with Th0 and Th1 cells, we polarized Th17 cells in vitro and overexpressed Eomes by retroviral transduction ( Figure 7D ). FACS sorted transduced (GFP + ) Th17 cells expressed abundant levels of Eomes as compared with control vector proving effective transduction; concomitantly, Prf1 RNA was significantly increased in Eomes transduced Th17 cells. These data suggested that the failure of Th17 cells to express Prf1 was due to reduced Eomes expression.",

While wild type mice recovered from i.th. VV challenge, Prf1 deficient mice succumbed to viral encephalitis. Numbers and fractions of CNS infiltrating immune cells were comparable between groups (data not shown) indicating that antigen specific priming in the peripheral immune compartment and establishment of inflammatory infiltrates within the CNS were not impaired in Prf1 -/mice. Moreover, wild type mice that were vaccinated with MVA and then depleted of CD4 + T cells in addition to CD8 + T cells succumbed to intrathecal challenge with VV although they had similar fractions of NK cells and NK T cells in the CNS as their CD4 + T cell replete counterparts (Additional file 3: Figure S3 ) suggesting that alternative sources of Prf1 other than CD4 + T cells were insufficient to provide protection in this model. Taken together, these data demonstrated that Prf1 expression was indispensable for effector T helper cell mediated control of intrathecal VV infection.",

We show that access inhibition to the CNS of selected T helper cell subsets by integrin targeted interventions results in the failure of host defense. Intrathecal infection with vaccinia virus (VV) was controlled in vaccinated mice when CD4 + and CD8 + T cells had access to the CNS compartment. Blockade of \u03b14-integrins by neutralizing antibodies or T cell conditional disruption of \u03b14-integrin expression did not prevent CTLs and Th17 cells from entering the CNS parenchyma while Th1 cells were blocked from migrating into the CNS. When CD8 + CTLs were depleted, host defense against intrathecal VV infection was still maintained as long as efficient Th1 like responses were operational within the CNS. In contrast, Th17 cells alone failed to rescue individuals from CNS infection despite a strong inflammatory response. Perforin-1 expression by T helper cells was required for clearance of intrathecal VV infection and Th17 cells failed to eliminate VV in the CNS due to lack of Eomes dependent Prf1 expression.",

CD8 + T cells recognize epitopes from early antigens of VV but robust CD4 + T cell responses are also required for direct and indirect antiviral effects [27] [28] [29] [30] . Niche restricted or organ specific infection may afford specific effector functions. For example, VV skin infection is contained and cleared by a temporally and spatially organized interaction of Ly6G + innate immune cells and CD8 + CTLs [22] . In the ovaries, clearance of VV correlates with the number of effector memory CTLs that are present in the ovaries of VV immunized mice before challenge with the virus [31] . Here, we established an intrathecal infection model with VV and used this system as an in vivo surrogate to correlate the access of distinct T helper cell subsets with successful host defense. Intrathecal infection of naive wild type C57BL/6 mice with VV was lethal because adaptive antiviral immune responses did not develop upon i.th. infection alone although innate immune cells and in particular CD11b + CD45 high monocytic cells were recruited to the infected CNS. Active immunization of mice with MVA in CFA prior to i.th. VV challenge protected the animals from lethal encephalitis. Protection was independent of neutralizing antibodies. However, access of VV specific Th1 cells into the CNS compartment was necessary and sufficient for host protection.",

            "text": "Migration of effector cells into the CNS is mediated by chemokine receptors and integrins. Several cytolytic and non-cytolytic viral infection models of the CNS were used to investigate principles of immune cell recruitment into the CNS. Depending on the viral agent, immune cell recruitment into the CNS cleared the pathogen or in addition, caused immunopathogenic tissue damage. CCR5 and CXCR3 were identified to be important for immune cell recruitment into the CNS in west nile or MHV and LCMV infection, respectively [32] [33] [34] [35] . Chemotaxis of immune cells must be complemented by integrin mediated interaction with endothelial cells for the transmigration of immune cells across the blood brain barrier [36] . Early work suggested that accumulation of antigen specific T cells in the CNS compartment of sindbis virus infected animals is mediated by engagement of LFA-1 but not VLA-4 [37] . Using genetic tools, we have recently shown that distinct T helper cell subsets use distinct integrins to access the CNS compartment in autoimmune inflammation. The entry of Th17 cells into the subarachnoid space most likely requires CCR6 and LFA-1 but is independent of VLA-4 [4, 38] . In fact, Th17 cells express low levels of \u03b14integrins since TGF-\u03b2, which is required for Th17 cell commitment [17, 39, 40] , inhibits the expression of \u03b14integrins [41] . Interestingly, antigen specific CD8 + CTLs also migrated into the CNS independently of \u03b14integrins (both in \u03b14-integrin antibody blockade and T cell conditional genetic disruption of Itga4). This is consistent with the observation that CD4 + T cell are preferentially reduced in CSF of natalizumab treated patients as compared with CD8 + T cells resulting in the reversion of the CSF CD4 + /CD8 + ratio [23] . Although one report suggested that CD8 + T cell influx into the CNS was prevented by a blocking antibody to \u03b14-integrins in an intracerebral corona virus infection model, it is unlikely that the recruitment of antigen specific CTLs was assessed by Ifergan et al. since their model did not allow for active priming and activation of adaptive T cell responses in the systemic lymphoid compartment prior to intracerebral challenge [42] . In contrast to Th17 cells, VLA-4 expression is indispensable and non-redundant for the capacity of antigen experienced Th1 cells to infiltrate into the subarachnoid space and the CNS compartment. Here, we provide evidence that MHC class II positive infected phagocytic cells in the CNS need to be cleared by Th1 cells in order to rescue mice from lethal encephalitis. Thus, MVA-immune T cell conditional \u03b14 KO mice succumbed to intrathecal VV challenge because they failed to recruit Th1 cells into the CNS despite regular Th17 cell accumulation. Antigen specific CD4 + T cells communicated with virus infected macrophages within the CNS parenchyma and only eliminated the infected cells when they were sufficient in perforin-1 expression. In ectromelia infection, a natural mouse pox infection, perforin-1 expression by CD4 + T cells is required to clear the pathogen, and CD4 + T cell mediated killing of hematopoietic MHC class II expressing infected target cells occurs in the draining lymph nodes, the liver, and the spleen [28] . Direct cytotoxic effects of antigen specific CD4 + T cells were also reported in systemic VV infection [43] . In our model, T cell conditional \u03b14-integrin deficient mice behaved like perforin-1 deficient animals and succumbed to infection because perforin-1 expressing Th1 cells did not reach the CNS compartment in the absence of VLA-4. Like in EAE, the cytokine phenotype of T helper cells that entered into the CNS compartment in the absence of \u03b14-integrin showed a Th17 profile [4] . Th17 cells did not express perforin-1. Initial Th17 cell commitment is sensitive to IL-2 and high IL-2 concentrations inhibit Th17 differentiation [44] . In contrast, IL-2 promotes the expression of granzyme B and perforin-1 and boosts cytotoxic capacity of CD4 + T cells [45] . While the transcriptional control of granzyme B and perforin-1 has in part been investigated in CD8 + T cells [46] , we found that perforin-1 expression in Th1 cells is associated with Eomes and overexpression of Eomes in Th17 cells partially reconstituted perforin-1 expression. Similar observations have been reported for Th2 cells that per se also lack perforin-1 [26] , which correlates with their low cytotoxic efficacy. However, lack of perforin-1 expression in Th17 cells may not be the only mechanism to impair their antiviral capacity. For example, Th17 cells are able to mount a protective response in primary lung infection with influenza in IL-10 KO mice suggesting that Th17 cells are particularly susceptible to IL-10 mediated suppression [47] . In addition, induction of prosurvival factors by Th17 cells may contribute to viral persistence in the CNS in Theiler's virus infection [48] . Conversely, it is possible that in some anatomical niches, Th17 cells may contribute to protective antiviral immune responses, e.g. by effective IL-17 mediated recruitment of neutrophils in lung infection [49] . Also, IL-21, which is produced by Th17 cells, might have a role in the modulation of primary and recall CTL responses by increasing their proliferation and reducing their sensitivity to exhaustion [50] . However, overall it is a more common scenario that antiviral Th17 responses fail to clear viral pathogens but rather drive deleterious immunopathology in the skin [51] , in the cornea [52] , and also in the CNS. We have shown that blockade or genetic lack of \u03b14integrins on T cells selectively modulated the access of T helper cell subsets to the CNS. Preferential limitation of Th1 trafficking jeopardized host defense against intrathecal VV infection. Nevertheless, our experimental system has several limitations: First, i.th. inoculation of VV does not represent a natural route of CNS infection. Yet, immunization with virus antigens in CFA provides an efficient way to generate both an antigen specific Th1 and Th17 response in the secondary lymphoid tissue and to study their trafficking and effector functions upon i.th. challenge with a well characterized pathogen. Second, i.th. VV infection results in an acute encephalomyelitis, which causes rapid decay and death of infected animals; in contrast, JC virus induced PML is due to insufficient control of a latent virus infection of oligodendrocytes. However, the intracerebral anti-JC virus CD4 + T cell response contributes substantially to JCV control because efficient clearance of JC virus from the CNS after immune reconstitution by wash-out of natalizumab in MS patients with PML is associated with the re-occurrence of Th1 cells in the CNS [53] .",

Our data raise the concern that treatment of humans with compounds like natalizumab that interfere with T cell trafficking not only by quantitatively reducing the migration of T cells into the CNS but also by selectively targeting distinct T cell subsets may evoke serious deficiencies in cellular immune responses at privileged anatomical sites like the CNS. As a result, primary infections or unexpected reactivations of latent viruses may be facilitated.",
