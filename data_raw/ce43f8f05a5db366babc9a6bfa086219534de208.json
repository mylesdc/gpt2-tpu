This mechanism is primarily composed of three transmembrane proteins serving as stress sensors: PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). These three proteins' synergic action elicits translation and transcriptional downstream pathways, leading to less protein production and activating genes that encode important proteins in folding processes, including chaperones. Previous reports showed that viruses have evolved mechanisms to curtail or customize this UPR signaling for their own benefit.

In the last few years, interest in the UPR signaling network has been increasing due to the implication of ER stress mechanisms in a wide range of pathologies, including infections, ischemic injury, neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic diseases, and neoplasias [2, 3] . Under stress conditions, UPR activation is essential to restore protein-folding homeostasis; however, if the damage to the cell is highly severe, the chronic ER stress and UPR signaling lead to cell apoptosis [1] . In mammals in particular, unfolded proteins are recognized in the ER lumen by the chaperone molecule immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (GRP78/BiP), which dissociates from three transmembrane proteins: PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) [4] . The synergic action of these three proteins, also known as UPR sensors, leads to translation and transcriptional downstream pathways that lead to less protein production and to the activation of genes that encode important proteins in folding processes, such as chaperones [1, 4] .",

Viral activation of the UPR may be specifically caused by the production of new viral particles due to the high load of viral protein production in the ER during infection. However, certain downstream effectors are not necessarily beneficial for viral replication, e.g., protein degradation by the ubiquitin-and proteasomedependent process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD) or apoptosis induction [5, 6] . Nonetheless, viruses are also capable of avoiding activation of several mechanisms in the UPR pathway, which shows their ability to modulate this cellular stress response both to promote cell survival during efficient viral replication and to create an environment more favorable for replication [7] .",

This report also indicated that ATF4 triggers the reactivation of HIV replication in infected cells through a mechanism mediated by the viral protein Tat, suggesting that the ER stress events that lead to high expression of ATF4 may be relevant for the end of viral latency. Additionally, reports have shown that the protease inhibitors used as part of ARV therapy are responsible for pharmacological activation of the UPR pathway in vitro [11] [12] [13] [14] .

In monocytes from treatment-na\u00efve HIV patients, BiP expression was significantly higher (p < 0.05).

In particular, the lymphocytes from HIVinfected patients showed significantly higher expression of P-eIF2\u03b1 compared with the control group.

A comparison between the in vitro and in vivo results indicated similar dynamics of HIV infection, in which the virus itself seems to be responsible for higher expression of P-eIF2\u03b1, but the presence of ARV drugs was also significant. However, the ARV therapy itself was not sufficient to induce the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, as indicated by the in vitro assays. Therefore, infected PBMCs treated with ARV drugs have a different expression profile than non-infected treated PBMCs do.",

Higher BiP expression is a strong indication of ER stress and the need for better folding capacity via UPR activation [1] . In the present study, the absence of significant differences in BiP expression between cells free of pharmacological treatment and ARV-treated cells and the lack of a significant impact of the ARV drugs themselves on non-infected cells strongly suggest that HIV was solely responsible for the stress observed in the ER. In the case of infected cells from patients under ARV therapy, despite their undetectable viral loads, the permanence of stress is probably related to the continuous presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines present under these pharmacological conditions [22] .",

Under in vivo conditions, CD4 + T lymphocytes had significantly higher expression of P-eIF2\u03b1 than did monocytes, particularly among the cells obtained from patients undergoing ARV treatment. This scenario is interesting because when PERK phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1, the latter factor is deactivated. Simultaneously, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation also increases translation of ATF4, which induces expression of several UPR-related genes, including BiP. These event leads to an attenuation of protein translation, decreasing the load of new proteins to be folded in the ER lumen [27] .",

Caselli et al. have previously suggested that P-eIF2\u03b1 can promote a favorable environment for HIV replication [10] . The presence of P-eIF2\u03b1 may also lead to virus reactivation from reservoirs, such as gut lymphoid tissues. Considering the role of P-eIF2\u03b1 in disrupting HIV latency, the results obtained from patients undergoing ARV therapy suggest a propitious environment for HIV according to its described role in previous studies, which is an unexpected perspective on cells under pharmacological control. Nevertheless, it is already known that ARV drugs are capable of inducing ER stress and UPR activation, which raises the possibility that this higher UPR activation signal in treated cells compared with cells without treatment is due to pharmacological UPR activation.",

It is well known that monocytes and macrophages are very resistant to HIV infection and its cytopathic effects in comparison with CD4 + T lymphocytes [28] . This refractory behavior favors latency and the role of monocytes and macrophages as reservoirs [29] . Even in patients with no detectable viral load, it is possible to recover and reactivate HIV replication in these cell types [30] . Considering that HIV plays a role in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, the lack of significant eIF2\u03b1 expression in monocytes may be related to the less efficient HIV replication in these cells. In contrast, activated CD4 + T lymphocytes are the most permissive cellular target of HIV, and when infected, these cells can die through caspase-3-dependent apoptosis [31] . However, the frequency of infected lymphocytes under clinical conditions is relatively low, as permissive CD4 + T lymphocytes represent less than 5 % of the whole lymphocyte population [32] .",

In fact, it has already been described that approximately 95 % of the cell death in HIV patients occurs through a caspase-1-dependent and highly inflammatory mechanism called pyroptosis, which happens in less permissive cells [33] . A highly inflammatory environment is established even in patients submitted to ARV therapy and with undetectable viral loads [22] . From the beginning of an HIV infection, there is a massive depletion of memory CD4 + T lymphocytes in the gastrointestinal mucosa [34] . This depletion facilitates the translocation of microbial products from the gut to the blood and creates a constant source of immune activation and inflammation that persists after ARV treatment [35] . Therefore, CD4 + T lymphocytes in HIV patients are under constant metabolic stress, and the presence of P-eIF2\u03b1 is an indication of this condition.",

IRE1 in its phosphorylated form indicates activation of this UPR sensor [36] . As IRE1 is responsible for the selective splicing of XBP1 mRNA (generating sXBP1), it is expected that IRE1 activation leads to a higher amount of sXBP1 and further expression of protein degradation-related genes [37] , decreasing the protein-folding workload in the ER. IRE1 phosphorylation has already been described in avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [38] , EBV [24] , CMV [39] , HCV [40] , DENV-1 [17] , and WNV [18] infections. The state of protein degradation created by P-IRE1 in the cell is not advantageous for viral replication. To evade this cellular stress response, certain viruses, such as CMV and HCV, can suppress the activity of sXBP1 and avoid the induction of its target genes [39, 40] . In IBV-infected cells, IRE1 activation serves as a survival factor during coronavirus infection, protecting cells from apoptosis [38] . The higher expression of P-IRE1 in treated patients with undetectable viral loads and the lower expression in treatment-na\u00efve individuals observed in the current study are in agreement with activation of the IRE1 sensor serving as a cellular defense mechanism. However, further studies are necessary to elucidate whether HIV also employs strategies to prevent possible losses of its replication under these conditions.",

For infected cells not submitted to ARV therapy, ATF6 and BiP presented higher expression levels.

However, a synergistic pharmacological effect appears to occur, as the drugs do not show the same influence on the protein expression profile of non-infected cells under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. These findings suggest two possible concurrent mechanisms: the interference of HIV itself and the pharmacological effects of the ARV drugs, both acting as activators of the UPR.
