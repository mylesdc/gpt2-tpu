Although CPV is a DNA virus, its genomic substitution rate is similar to some RNA viruses. Therefore, it is important to trace the evolution of CPV to monitor the appearance of mutations that might affect vaccine effectiveness. Results: Our analysis shows that the VP2 genes of CPV isolated from 1979 to 2016 are divided into six groups: GI, GII, GIII, GIV, GV, and GVI. Amino acid mutation analysis revealed several undiscovered important mutation sites: F267Y, Y324I, and T440A. Of note, the evolutionary rate of the CPV VP2 gene from Asia and Europe decreased. Codon usage analysis showed that the VP2 gene of CPV exhibits high bias with an ENC ranging from 34.93 to 36.7. Furthermore, we demonstrate that natural selection plays a major role compared to mutation pressure driving CPV evolution. Conclusions: There are few studies on the codon usage of CPV. Here, we comprehensively studied the genetic evolution, codon usage pattern, and evolutionary characterization of the VP2 gene of CPV. The novel findings revealing the evolutionary process of CPV will greatly serve future CPV research.",

            "text": "Canine parvovirus (CPV) belongs to the genus Protoparvovirus and causes severe intestinal disease and leukopenia among carnivores, especially in canines and felines [1, 2] . CPV is a non-enveloped DNA virus with an approximately 5000-nucleotide, single-stranded DNA genome including two open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF encodes two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2) and the second ORF encodes two structural proteins (VP1 and VP2) [3] . VP2 is the most abundant structural protein, accounting for 90% of the viral capsid, and is able to self-assemble to make virus like particles (VLPs) [4] . VP2 is a major antigenic determinant and plays a critical role in determining viral tissue tropism and host range [5, 6] . Notably, only a few amino acid substitutions in its sequence can alter relevant biological characteristics of the virus [7] . NS1, is a pleiotropic nuclear phosphoprotein that is important for viral replication and is responsible for inducing apoptosis [8, 9] . Canine parvovirus (also known as CPV type 2) emerged in 1978 in the USA and quickly spread among dog populations all over the world with high morbidity [10] . The virus experiences continuous genetic variation. CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c are the current three main antigenic variants of CPV [11] . Amino-acid substitutions at specific VP2 residues are the basis for the classification of CPV type 2 viruses into variants CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c [12, 13] .",

Notably, the usage of synonymous codons is a non-random selection process. Some codons are used more often than others [14, 15] , a phenomenon referred to as \"codon usage bias\" that can be found in numerous species, such as prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and viruses [16] . Previous studies revealed that codon usage patterns are influenced by natural selection and mutation bias [17, 18] . The differential usage of synonymous codons (among other aspects of genome evolution) might be crucial to the understanding of viral biology, especially the interplay between viruses and the immune response. Genome-wide mutational pressure is the most important factor shaping patterns of codon usage bias in DNA viruses [19, 20] . Thus, understanding the codon usage of viruses can provide information about the mechanisms driving molecular evolution and expand our understanding of the regulation of viral gene expression. This will ultimately improve live attenuated vaccine antigenicity due to more efficient viral gene expression.",

Among the eighteen most abundant codons, all were A/T terminated codons including ten T-terminated codons (TGT for Cys, GAT for Asp, TTT for Phe, GGT for Gly, CAT for His, ATT for IIe, AAT for Asn, TAT for Tyr, GTT for Val, and TCT for Ser) and eight A-terminated codons (GCA for Ala, GAA for Glu, AAA for Lys, TTA for Leu, CCA for Pro, CAA for Gln, AGA for Arg, and ACA for Thr). This indicates codon usage bias in synonymous codons. This together with the nucleotide composition analysis indicates that the usage of optional codons might be influenced by compositional constraints resulting in the presence of mutational pressure. Mutational pressure shaping codon usage bias ENC plots were constructed according to the geographical distribution and isolation time ( Fig. 2a and b respectively). The ENC plots show that not all the different sequences are positioned on the standard curve, indicating that mutational pressure is not the sole factor shaping codon usage bias but other forces, including geographical distribution, could play a role too. Additionally, sequences isolated from different countries and years clustered together with slight fluctuation except for sequences isolated from Germany in 1995. This result is consistent with the small SD of the ENC.",

The genotype of the CPV-2b antigenic variant mainly belongs to the GVIc group worldwide. Almost all the CPV-2c strains formed another independent subgroup, named group GVId. It is important to note that the CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c variants do not cluster into to the same clades based on the phylogeny. This is because the classification into genotypes is based on mutation sites while the phylogeny is reconstructed based on nucleotide relationships. Nowadays, CPV-2a and CPV-2b are predominant in Asian countries including Korea, China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, and India. Outside of Asia, CPV-2a and 2b isolates are common in the United States, whereas CPV-2c is more widespread in Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina [24] . The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the evolution of CPV VP2 from a macroperspective, while the detailed changes were analyzed by amino acid mutant analysis and codon usage analysis. It is considered that CPV, as the original type 2 (origin CPV type 2), emerged in 1978 and is a specific variant of feline panleukopenia virus [25] . Several amino acid mutations (M87 L, I101T, A300G, D305Y) in CPV 2a [26] as well as the N426D mutation in VP2 of CPV-2b [27] result in biological differences between CPV-2 and CPV-2a, CPV 2b, respectively, including antigenic reactivity to monoclonal antibodies, binding affinity to the feline transferrin receptor, and the ability to replicate in cats [27] [28] [29] . In addition, a third variant carrying a N426E mutation, that is critical to distinguish CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c strains (Table 1) , was discovered in Italy in 2000 [12] . New variants discovered in CPV-2a and CPV-2b carrying substitutions on site 297 were previously identified and designated as new CPV-2a and new CPV-2b, respectively [30, 31] . This site is under strong positive selection and may have had a remarkable influence on the process of host adaptation [32] . This site is defined as a marker in identifying the new CPV-2a and new CPV-2b variants. Except for these mutations, a Q370R mutation was only found in some CPV-2c strains isolated from China and Taiwan. Previous studies have suggested that this is evidence of a potential CPV-2c variant or new CPV-2c. Further studies regarding the potential variant CPV-2c strains should be conducted to understand the relationship between the Q370R substitution and viral pathogenicity [33] .",

These may contribute to virus immune escape via antigenic drift and consequent vaccine failure [33] [34] [35] [36] . Among the non-synonymous mutations, amino acid residue 267 is not exposed on the capsid surface and thus substitutions in this position may not affect the antigenicity of the virus [37] . The T324I mutation in CPV-2a strains may be a common amino acid alteration in Asian countries, especially in China [33] and in South America. Mutations at amino acid residue 324 may have an impact on parvovirus host range [38] and it was also been demonstrated that the T324I mutation occurs in regions referring to potentially important antigenic epitopes. This substitution might have a direct influence on viral biology [5] . The T440A mutation is also important for CPV because residue 440 is located on the top of the three-fold spike of the VP2 protein on the surface of the capsid, the main viral antigenic site [39, 40] . Therefore, resulting in the emergence of further antigenic variants. Overall, further studies on the effects of the F267Y, Y324I, and T440A mutations on CPV VP2 are imperative. Additionally, we found amino acid substitutions: K80R, K93 N, V103A and D323N, in agreement with previous studies [27, 41, 42] .",

Previous studies demonstrated that the degree of codon usage bias is different among the different species, even for genes belonging to the same species [44] [45] [46] [47] . It is considered that mutation pressure [48, 49] or natural selection [50, 51] are the two major factors affecting codon usage bias, as well as other factors such as secondary mRNA structure [52] , tRNA abundance [53] , geographical distribution [54] , and external environment [55] . To date, most studies on codon usage bias focus on RNA viruses and their complete genomes. There are few studies on DNA viruses and in single genes. Here, we firstly analyzed the nucleotide composition of CPV VP2 and we found that the A/T content was higher than the G/C content and that A/T terminated codons were preferred than G/C terminated codons. Furthermore, most of the eighteen most frequently used codons ended in Here ENC analysis was employed to evaluate the codon usage bias of the VP2 gene of CPV. Compared with previously reported DNA viruses such as porcine circovirus [56] (mean value 56.80), human herpesvirus [57] (range from 39.47 \u00b1 4.81 to 54.92 \u00b1 3.26), duck plague virus UL35 gene [58] (mean value 47.55), duck enteritis virus UL24 gene [59] (range from 40.10 to 60.44), and iridovirus [60] (range from 35.87 to 51.81), canine parvovirus [61] exhibits high codon usage bias (36.46) , in accordance with the study of Shackelton et al. [20] . Interestingly, we found that among the abovementioned DNA viruses, porcine circovirus exhibits lower codon usage while CPV exhibits much higher codon usage bias. This might be the result of small DNA viruses replicating in cells that are mitotically active [20] and the CPV having a strict host range, for example, the origin CPV type 2 is only infectious in dogs, while CPV 2a and CPV 2b infect both dogs and felines.",

Mutation pressure and natural selection were proven to be the two main factors shaping codon usage bias. To explore the role of mutation pressure, the correlation between nucleotide content and codon composition was analyzed and showed a strong correlation. However, the relationship between T%, A3s and C3 indicated that the codon usage pattern was influenced by mutation pressure. Further, the CoA based on RSCU analysis demonstrated the role of mutation pressure. Thus, mutation pressure is essential in shaping the codon usage of the VP2 gene of CPV in accordance with previous studies showing that mutational bias is important in shaping the codon usage pattern of DNA viruses [20] .",

This was significantly demonstrated by neutrality analysis in which the natural selection constrains the codon usage bias (97.25% coverage). In conclusion, high codon usage bias was observed for the VP2 gene of CPV, which was mainly caused by natural selection, in contrast to porcine circovirus that is mainly driven by mutation pressure [62] . In addition, the results reveal that the suppression of CpG in CPV VP2, which might due to the innate immune system of host treatment of unmethylated CpGs, is a pathogen characteristic. Also, geographical distribution is correlated with the codon usage pattern of VP2 by CoA analysis based on the country of isolation. Thus, codon usage analysis, natural selection, mutation pressure, dinucleotide abundance and geographical distribution are essential.",

Additionally, the substitution rates of sequences isolated from Asia and Europe descended over time. Most importantly, natural selection is the force that has the biggest impact in driving the codon usage of CPV. These new results regarding CPV evolution will greatly serve future CPV research.",
