            "text": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging cause of viral hepatitis worldwide. Recently, HEV-7 has been shown to infect camels and humans. We studied HEV seroprevalence in dromedary camels and among Bedouins, Arabs (Muslims, none-Bedouins) and Jews and assessed factors associated with anti-HEV seropositivity. Serum samples from dromedary camels (n = 86) were used to determine camel anti-HEV IgG and HEV RNA positivity. Human samples collected between 2009 and 2016 from >20 years old Bedouins (n = 305), non-Bedouin Arabs (n = 320) and Jews (n = 195), were randomly selected using an age-stratified sampling design. Human HEV IgG levels were determined using Wantai IgG ELISA assay. Of the samples obtained from camels, 68.6% were anti-HEV positive. Among the human populations, Bedouins and non-Bedouin Arabs had a significantly higher prevalence of HEV antibodies (21.6% and 15.0%, respectively) compared with the Jewish population (3.1%). Seropositivity increased significantly with age in all human populations, reaching 47.6% and 34.8% among \u2a7e40 years old, in Bedouins and non-Bedouin Arabs, respectively. The high seropositivity in camels and in \u2a7e40 years old Bedouins and non-Bedouin Arabs suggests that HEV is endemic in Israel. The low HEV seroprevalence in Jews could be attributed to higher socio-economic status.",

The infection is mostly silent, but when symptoms do appear, illness is usually selflimiting [1] . HEV infection can also become chronic in immunocompromised individuals, such as those receiving organ transplants or chemotherapy, as well as among individuals with HIV infection [2] . Moreover, extra hepatic manifestations of HEV infection, mostly neurological, are increasingly recognised [3] . Currently, eight HEV genotypes are known, all belonging to a single serotype [4] . Of those, HEV-7 and HEV-8 have been identified in dromedary (1-humped) and bactrian (2-humped) camels, respectively [4, 5] . HEV-7, identified in a liver transplant recipient had been linked to the consumption of camel products [6] .",

Together with the high seroprevalence of HEV in camels, these results indicate endemicity of HEV in Israel. Worldwide, the seroprevalence of HEV documented in human populations varies between high (\u2a7e20.0%), medium (10.0-19.9%) and low (<10.0%). High HEV seroprevalence rates were reported in Uganda (47.7%) [33] , Poland (43.5% and 49.6%) [9, 18] , Bolivia (34.8%) [13] , Jordan (30.9%) [7] and South Africa (25.3%) [12] . Medium HEV seroprevalence rates were reported in China (19.9%) [15] , Belgium (18.3%) [34] , Portugal (16.3%) [11] and the Mediterranean Region (11.9%) [35] . Low HEV seroprevalence rates were reported in New Zealand (9.7%) [10] , Scotland (6.1%) [36] and Iceland (2.1%) [37] . Accordingly, within Israel, high, medium and low HEV seroprevalence rates were observed in Bedouins, non-Bedouin Arabs and Jews.",

            "text": "The higher seroprevalence rate in Bedouins could be attributed to their low socio-economic status but could also result from exposure to camels, especially as the latter were highly seroprevalent (possibly a consequence of HEV-7 infection [4] ). As camel samples were HEV RNA negative and fecal specimens were not available for analysis, this hypothesis could not be further explored. In Jordan, a nearby country, an overall of 30.9% anti-HEV prevalence rate was determined in the local population and owning camels was associated with increased odds of HEV seropositivity [7] . Future studies should aim to assess the HEV RNA prevalence in camel's feces and in their fresh blood samples, as well as in similar samples obtained from Bedouins who own camels. With the recent report suggesting that HEV originated in Asia, most likely from a human ancestor that existed \u223c4500-6800 years ago and that the split of camel-infecting genotypes occurred during camel domestication, HEV circulation between camels and Bedouins could be expected [38] . The high HEV seropositivity rate observed in non-Bedouin Arabs, most of whom live in Northern parts of Israel, could be attributed to exposure to HEV-3 which is possibly circulating in the country and was recently identified in local sewage facilities mainly in the north of Israel [39] . As both Judaism and Islam forbid the consumption of pork, we find it unlikely that this is the main risk for the identified HEV seroprevalence in the Muslim population. The low HEV seroprevalence observed in Israeli-born Jews may be associated with the overall higher socio-economic status characterising this population, living in better sanitary conditions than the Bedouins and most of the non-Bedouin Arabs, rendering HEV infection less conceivable. The variability observed between different population groups and in different studies, may be explained by exposure to potential risk factors associated with HEV infection as lifestyle habits (dietary), environmental conditions, geographic location, occupation, religion (as the prohibition of consuming pork among Jews and Islam) but also to co-morbidities. Differences may also be explained by the assays used for antibodies detection, demonstrating wide variation in the ability to detect HEV antibodies (sensitivity and specificity) [40] .",

Additionally, the cross-sectional nature of the data cannot establish a temporal relationship between risk factors and outcome, thus limits the interpretation of the results. Finally, HEV RNA from human samples could not be assessed due to limited serum volumes. However, for the first time, we have investigated samples from local camels and from specific human populations, with fair distribution by age groups and gender. Based on this cohort, our results suggest that HEV is endemic in Israel and that specific population groups like Bedouins and non-Bedouin Arabs are at higher risk of HEV infection. Further studies are needed to determine the HEV genotypes circulating among dromedary camels and the specific Arabs populations.",
