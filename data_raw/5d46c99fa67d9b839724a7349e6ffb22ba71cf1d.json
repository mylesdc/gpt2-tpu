The emergence of a zoonosis can result from different factors, including global warming and climate change; anthropogenic factors such as trade, tourism, deforestation, changed agricultural practices and livestock farming, and hunting; and natural factors such as pathogen adaptation and animal migration (2) . Emerging zoonotic diseases are increasing, causing severe economic impacts and animal and human health risks. The World Bank estimates that zoonotic disease outbreaks \u00c1 mostly of emerging zoonoses \u00c1 have caused global losses exceeding $US200 billion, including reduced trade, tourism, and tax revenues in the past 10 years (3) . Among the infectious agents considered to be emerging, 175 species from 96 genera have been documented, of which 132 (75%) species from 78 genera are zoonotic. It has been estimated that zoonotic pathogens are twice more likely to be emerging than their non-zoonotic counterparts (4) .",

This is a systemsapproach concept which consolidates the 'collaborative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals and our environment' (6) .

Even in developed countries, syndromic surveillance for animal diseases, including zoonoses, are rudimentary. To overcome this deficiency, the Triple-S project, co-funded by the European Commission, is forging synergies between the human and animal health sectors by providing scientific and technical guidance on syndromic surveillance in real-time or near real-time which encompasses emerging zoonoses (7) . Examples of international organizations that report and respond to zoonoses, including emerging zoonoses, are listed in Table 1 .

However, detection and surveillance systems for emerging zoonoses in the developing world are much less functional. In that regard, surveillance systems for wildlife, exotic animals, and companion animals have not been established. Wildlife represents a significantly large and often unknown reservoir for emerging zoonoses, in addition to being a reservoir for re-emergence of zoonoses previously controlled. Factors for emergence of zoonoses from wildlife include a burgeoning human population leading to exploitation of forest areas for agriculture and dwelling, ecotourism, outdoor activities, and live animal trade (8).",

In contrast, the information and infrastructure supporting evidence-based veterinary medical practice in all of the above elements are less developed due to less public funding being made available to the veterinary side as compared to human health care (9) . The EBP resources include websites that provide processed information on best available research evidence which are critically appraised, integrated, concisely summarized, and regularly updated as new research evidence becomes available. Distilling and disseminating evidence, a process of knowledge translation, which evaluates relevance and applicability in various scenarios, is made accessible to health providers and those making policy decisions. These EBP resources are either freely accessible or via subscription. Access to such resources addresses several barriers identified by health care decision makers regarding access to evidence-based information, including limitations of time and lack of knowledge regarding resources that synthesize, summarize, and assess evidence for quality. Some of the available resources that provide ready access to high-quality, pre-processed research evidence include Cochrane database, National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC-USA), American College of Physicians\u00c1American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP Journal Club), National Institute for Health and Clinical Evidence (NICE \u00c1 UK), Bandolier, Clinical Evidence, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness PubMed, NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) Databases, and Public Health plus. Some of these have been assessed using quality, relevance, and newsworthiness filters and are regularly updated. The above listed EBP resources provide evidence updates on etiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and economics but are restricted to medical conditions only. Unfortunately, there are apparently no corresponding open, related guideline repositories or registries in veterinary medical practice, although the Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines of agency for health research and quality (AHRQ) has a short index for zoonosesrelated guidelines (10).",

This should begin with an unbridled global joint signaling structure which encompasses syndromic surveillance and risk surveillance for emerging zoonoses. The signaling structure should foster a regular rapid flow of information between veterinary and medical health sectors, give early warning of pathogen emergence, and focus on determinants of disease emergence. Parallel systems of processing evidence regarding the proposed diagnosis, interventions, medical measures, and other public health strategies to assist decision making, emergency preparedness, and response should evolve in the lines of the existing evidence updates resources. Emerging zoonoses causes serious health threats and global economical losses. Countering them mandates the adoption of a one-health approach involving various stake holders, including ecologists, to understand the host\u00c1 parasite interaction in the natural reservoir and to understand the ecological constraints, often limiting adaptation to other hosts. Providing early warning of zoonotic pathogen emergence requires a one-health surveillance system at local, regional, and global levels. Evidence updates on diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic interventions; antimicrobial resistance; and public health policies would support clinicians, public health practitioners, scientists, and policy makers to prevent and control emerging zoonoses. To accomplish this, a multi-disciplinary evidence-based strategy integrating with the existing EBP resources would provide a useful tool.
