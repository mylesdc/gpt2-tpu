Given the precedent for other picornaviruses which use terminal sialic acids (SAs) as receptors, we examined the role of SAs in PSV binding and infection. Using a variety of approaches, including treating cells with a carbohydrate-destroying chemical (NaIO 4 ), mono-or oligosaccharides (N-acetylneuraminic acid, galactose, and 6=-sialyllactose), linkage-specific sialidases (neuraminidase and sialidase S), lectins (Maakia amurensis lectin and Sambucus nigra lectin), proteases (trypsin and chymotrypsin), and glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors (DL-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol and phospholipase C), we demonstrated that PSV could recognize \u24232,3-linked SA on glycolipids as a receptor. On the other hand, PSVs had no binding affinity for synthetic histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), suggesting that PSVs could not use HBGAs as receptors. Depletion of cell surface glycolipids followed by reconstitution studies indicated that GD1a ganglioside, but not other gangliosides, could restore PSV binding and infection, further confirming \u24232,3-linked SA on GD1a as a PSV receptor. Our results could provide significant information on the understanding of the life cycle of sapelovirus and other picornaviruses. For the broader community in the area of pathogens and pathogenesis, these findings and insights could contribute to the development of affordable, useful, and efficient drugs for anti-sapelovirus therapy.",

Monosaccharide sialic acids (SAs), a large family of neuraminic acid derivatives, decorate all eukaryotic cell surfaces, usually at the termini of glycans attached as glycoproteins, glycosphingolipids, and the proteoglycan keratin sulfate (2) . Since SA on the cell surface is readily accessible, SA itself often serves as a receptor for a significant number of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Representatives from at least nine different virus families use SA as receptors: Picornaviridae (3), Caliciviridae (4), Orthomyxoviridae (5), Paramyxoviridae (6) , Coronaviridae (7) , Reoviridae (8) , Parvoviridae (9) , Polyomaviridae (10) , and Adenoviridae (11) . Most SAs as virus receptors are terminal SAs attached to the underlying sugar chain by an \u24232,3 linkage or an \u24232,6 linkage. This may contribute to virus tissue tropism, pathogenesis, and host specificity (1, 12) .",

In the latter case, infection is associated with a wide spectrum of disorders, including diarrhea, pneumonia, polioencephalomyelitis, and reproductive disorders (16) (17) (18) . Pigs are the only species known to be naturally susceptible to PSV, although pregnant guinea pigs experimentally infected with PSV developed placental lesions (17, 19) . Transmission of PSV is primarily through the fecal-oral route (17) , but aerosol infection may lead to lung infection (20) . PSVs are readily cultivated in cell cultures of porcine origin, including primary or secondary pig kidney cell cultures and the IB-RS-2 pig kidney cell line (21) . Among cell lines from other species, PSVs can replicate in a baby hamster kidney (BHK21) cell line but not in human cervical cancer (HeLa) or African green monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines (21) . PSVs has been isolated from the feces of healthy or diarrheic pigs, from the central nervous system of pigs with polioencephalomyelitis, from the pig lung tissues with pneumonia, or from the tissues of stillborn, aborted, or mummified fetuses (16, 17) . PSVs induce unique type II cytopathic effects (CPE) characterized by pyknotic nuclei and highly granular and eosinophilic cytoplasm with uneven protrusions in coverslip cultures stained with hematoxylin and eosin (22) .",

Pretreatment of LLC-PK cells with various concentrations of NaIO 4 markedly reduced the binding of AF-594-labeled PSV strain KS05151 (here referred to simply as PSV) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A) . To confirm the specificity of NaIO 4 treatment, we used FCV and EV70, both of which could utilize terminal SA as a receptor (3, 25) . As a negative control, we used CVB3, which uses decay-accelerating factor (DAF) as a receptor (33) . As expected, pretreatment of cells with NaIO 4 reduced the binding of carbohydrate-dependent FCV and EV70 in a dose-dependent manner but had no effect on binding of DAF-dependent CVB3 (data not shown). To more accurately quantify the effect of NaIO 4 treatment, radioisotope-labeled virus was incubated with cells after pretreatment with NaIO 4 , and virus binding was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Treatment of cells with 1 mM NaIO 4 reduced the PSV binding to 54% of the levels of mock-treated cells, whereas 5 mM NaIO 4 reduced its binding to 36% (Fig. 1B) . As expected, NaIO 4 treatment also resulted in a reduction in FCV and EV70 binding, but no effect on CVB3 binding was observed (Fig. 1B) . PSV infection was also reduced to 16% or 2% of the levels of cells pretreated with only 1 mM or 5 mM NaIO 4 , respectively ( Fig. 1C and D) . A similar reduction in infection was observed in NaIO 4 -treated cells infected with known carbohydrate-binding viruses FCV and EV70, although no effect was seen in DAF-binding CVB3 (Fig.  1D) .

Among various SAs, however, binding of these viruses is blocked by monosaccharide NANA but not by monosaccharide Gal or oligosaccharide 6=-SL (4, 25) . To examine whether each SA could act as a receptor for PSV, various concentrations (20 to 80 mM) of monosaccharide (Gal and NANA) and oligosaccharide (6=-SL) were incubated with AF-594-labeled or radiolabeled PSV or control viruses to analyze their impact on virus binding and infection. PSV binding was reduced by NANA in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 3A and B) . As expected, the binding of SA-dependent FCV and EV70 was significantly blocked by NANA, whereas the bind- ing of DAF receptor-dependent CVB3 was unaffected (Fig. 3B) . Soluble NANA also significantly decreased the infection of PSV, FCV, and EV70 but not CVB3 (Fig. 3C and D) . In contrast, preincubation with 6=-SL or Gal had no inhibitory effect on the binding and infection of PSV, FCV, EV70, or CVB3, regardless of the concentration used (Fig. 3B and data not shown) .

To further confirm the role of SA and to examine the nature of the linkages required for PSV binding and infection, cells were pretreated with NA (from Vibrio cholerae) to cleave all \u24232,3-linked, \u24232,6-linked, and \u24232,8-linked SAs from underlying glycans or with SS (from Streptococcus pneumoniae) to cleave \u24232,3-linked SA only (25) . Pretreatment of cells with NA significantly reduced the binding of AF-594-labeled or radiolabeled PSV and SA-dependent FCV as well as EV70, but not CVB3, compared to that in mock-treated cells (Fig. 4A and B) . NA also inhibited the infection of cells by PSV, FCV, and EV70 but not DAF-receptor dependent CVB3 (Fig. 4C and D) . Pretreatment of cells with SS reduced the binding and infection of PSV (Fig. 4) . As expected, SS treatment significantly reduced the binding of EV70, which uses \u24232,3-linked SA as a receptor, but had no effect on the binding or infection of \u24232,6-linked SA-dependent FCV or DAFdependent CVB3 (Fig. 4B and D) . These data indicated that PSV required \u24232,3-linked SA for binding and infection.",

            "text": "Viruses initiate infection by binding to a specific receptor(s) on the surface of susceptible host cells. For many viruses, these receptors are glycans (carbohydrates) linked to either protein or lipid (1). Carbohydrates are major components of the cell surface and extracellular matrix (2) . Interactions between viruses and host cell receptors are key factors in the regulation of viral tropism, pathogenesis, and host range. Despite the recognition of sapeloviruses as emerging porcine, simian, and avian pathogens, the nature of the receptors used by members within the genus Sapelovirus has not been determined. Here, we demonstrated that PSV used \u24232,3linked SA on GD1a glycolipid for binding and infection. The SAs in the carbohydrates are ubiquitously displayed on the surfaces of all mammalian cells and normally linked to underlying sugar chains by \u24232,3 or \u24232,6 links to a galactose moiety or by \u24232,8 links to an internal SA (2). Among viruses within the family Picornaviridae, a number are known to use carbohydrates for attachment and entry. For example, EV70 (3), equine rhinitis A virus (37) , and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (38) use \u24232,3linked SAs. However, encephalomyocarditis virus, a member within the genus Cardiovirus, recognizes \u24232,6-linked SAs (39) . Aside from carbohydrates, proteins have also been identified as coreceptors. EV71 can utilize both \u24232,3and \u24232,6-linked SAs in addition to several protein receptors (40) . Some echoviruses can use CD55 and heparan sulfate (41) . Here, we show that PSV utilizes \u24232,3-linked SA on carbohydrates as a receptor. Preincubation of monosaccharide but not oligosaccharides significantly reduced binding and infection of not only SA-dependent control viruses (FCV and EV70) but also PSV in cultured cells (3, 25) . Moreover, blocking \u24232,3 linkage by SS and MAL but not \u24232,6 linkage by SNL prevented binding and infection of PSV and control \u24232,3 linkag-dependent EV70 (3). Our observation that \u24232,3linked SA functioned in PSV attachment to host cells further confirmed the important role of carbohydrates in the attachment of picornaviruses to target cells.",

For example, HBGAs act as the receptors for human and bovine noroviruses (35, 42) , whereas terminal SA functions as the receptor for murine norovirus (31) . Unlike the neuroinvasive English PSV strain which causes severe nonsuppurative polioencephalomyelitis in the spinal cord without lesions in other tissues (43) , the Korean PSV strain was enteropathogenic (unpublished data). These indicate that different PSV strains in Korea and other countries may recognize different receptor(s).",
