Within PPs, Dendritic cells (DCs) can uptake antigens from the gut lumen by extending dendrites into epithelium, and process it and then present to lymphocytes, which effectively antigen produces an immune response. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute and highly contagious enteric viral disease. The interaction between inactivated porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) has been reported. However, little is known about the interaction between inactivated PEDV and DCs in porcine PPs.",

Our findings clearly indicate that DCs in porcine PPs after oral administration of inactivated PEDV not only stimulated the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes, but also secreted cytokines (IL-1, IL-4). Furthermore, the number of DCs and IgA + cells in porcine intestinal mucosal significantly increased and the levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG antibody in the serum and SIgA antibody in the feces increased after oral administration inactivated PEDV. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that oral administration of inactivated PEDV activate DCs in porcine Peyer's patches and inactivated PEDV may be a useful and safe vaccine to trigger adaptive immunity.",

Gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), consists of isolated or aggregated lymphoid follicles forming Peyer's patches (PPs), is considered to be the key inductive tissues for the mucosal immune system [1] . PPs are known as the immune sensors of the intestine because of their ability to transport luminal antigens and bacteria into organized lymphoid tissues within the intestinal mucosa [2] . PPs contain too many immunocompetent cells that are required for the generation of an immune response. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) that possess the unique capacity to trigger primary adaptive immune responses through the antigen-specific activation of naive T cells. DCs in PPs can extend dendrites into the lumen to capture antigens and then present to resting T cells and thus initiate adaptive immune responses [3, 4] .",

DCs involved in intestinal immunity were investigated by cDCs induced from bone marrow cells or pDCs induced from blood mononuclear cells so far [6, 7] . But neither pDCs nor cDCs represent the reality of DCs within PPs. Indeed it is difficult to obtain the DCs within PPs in human. Unlike the mouse (isolated PPs), pig had continuous PPs (aggregated PPs), just like human. It is possible to get DCs within PPs in pig. The pig would be an animal model for studying DCs within PPs in human. Therefore, it is important to establish a method that isolate DCs from porcine PPs.",

Currently, PED is globally recognized as an emerging and reemerging disease that has resulted in great economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. PEDV infect piglets mainly through fecal-oral route (digestive tract). Vaccination is a potent tool in the control and prevention of PED [11] . It is important to develop oral vaccines that can elicit effective mucosal immune responses against PEDV infection. Oral vaccines could cut off the route of PEDV invasion. Oral administration of vaccine in pigs have been successfully used to prevent infectious disease [12, 13] .",

Within PPs, DCs in the dome and interfollicular areas can uptake antigens from the gut lumen by extending dendrites into epithelium, then and process and present to lymphocytes, which effectively antigen produces an immune response [4, 14, 15] . DCs derived from blood and bone marrow precursors can't represent the real immune status of the body. Mice are the most commonly used animal models, but because of their small size they have a low amount of DCs in their intestinal mucosal. Moreover, the immune system of mice have less than 10% similarity to humans [22] . In addition, it is difficult to identify and collect DCs from human PPs, study of DCs from human PPs is difficult to achieve [2] . Therefore, the current study is about the isolation of DCs in porcine PPs. Pigs are very similar in anatomy, physiology and genetics to humans. Moreover, the immune system of pigs is over 80% similar to humans [22] [23] [24] . A large number of experiments have proved that pigs can be used as an ideal experimental animal model for the establishment of human disease infection and can be used to isolate and characterize the DCs in porcine PPs [25] [26] [27] . So, it is important to establish a method to isolate a number of functional DCs in vitro. In this study, we establish a method to isolate DCs in porcine PPs, which could contribute to further study on the role of DCs in porcine PPs.",

Therefore, it is important to develop oral mucosa vaccines that can elicit effective mucosal immune responses against PEDV infection. An oral vaccination is an efficacious strategy owing to induction of potent humoural and Fig. 5 The number of ileum IgA + cells increases after oral inactivated PEDV. IgA + cells were showed by immumohistochemical staining. The number of IgA + cells in per view was counted and statistical analysis was performed.

Significant differences between the treated groups and the control groups are identified as. Scale bar = 100 \u03bcm, n = 10 *p < 0.05 mucosal immune responses and it offers significant advantages such as easy delivery, labor health safety in comparison to other vaccination routes such as intramuscular. Currently live attenuated PEDV vaccines are commercially used [28] . Inactivated whole-virus vaccines and live PEDV can induce significantly protective immune responses respectively. But the problem occurs when live attenuated PEDV mutates into virulent strain or the small intestine mucosal immunity is insufficient, the virus proliferates in the small intestine and can be easily spread in the piglets and cause PED. However, inactivated whole-virus vaccines can solve the secure problem and be effective as well.",

            "text": "PPs is the main site of induction of IgA-producing plasma B cells by DCs loaded with commensal bacteria [29] . Inactivated viruses are usually not sufficiently effective in eliciting local mucosal immune response. DCs play a significant role in the application of inactivated PEDV oral vaccine. After oral administration of antigens, PPs are the first places of T-cell-specific priming and proliferation in the gut. DCs promote lymphocytes proliferation and secreting cytokines against an array of invading pathogens including PEDV. DCs derived from spleen (SP) exhibit strong functional differences as compared to DCs derived from PPs [30] . DCs from PPs are more potent in stimulating allogeneic T-cells proliferation compared with DCs from SP. As well as, the DCs derived from PPs are able to prime the production of IL-4 and IL-10 (Th2 anti-inflammatory cytokines), while DCs from SP lack this ability [30] . Therefore, designing vaccines targeting DCs may be potential agents for the suppression of viral infections. In this study, our results indicated that DCs in porcine PPs after oral administration of inactivated PEDV not only can stimulate the proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes, but also can stimulate lymphocytes to secrete cytokines (IL-1 and IL-4), after the mixed reaction of DCs and allogeneic lymphocytes. In addition, we also found that the number of ileum IgA + cells and DCs in porcine ileum significantly increased in piglets in vitro and the levels of anti-PEDV specific IgG antibody in the serum and SIgA antibody in the feces increases after oral administration of inactivated PEDV.",
