Pathogens in mucus (artificial mucus or sputum samples) were not completely inactivated by alcohol-based disinfectants (survival rate >10%), suggesting that the alcohol-based disinfectants were ineffective. Pathogen survival and mucus viscosity were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient >0.7, P < 0.001). Additionally, the ethanol diffusion rate decreased with increasing mucus viscosity, which contributed to ethanol resistance. Pronase treatment of sputum samples significantly decreased sputum viscosity and increased the disinfectant effect (P < 0.001 for all). In contrast, complete inactivation was achieved by ultraviolet irradiation independently of mucus viscosity. Thus, mucus viscosity contributes to resistance of pathogens to alcohol-based disinfectants by decreasing the alcohol diffusion rate. These findings can provide a basis for developing new strategies, including improved disinfectants, for overcoming HAI.",

(iv) UV irradiation completely inactivated pathogens, which was independent on viscosity. (v) Viruses in sputum samples were protected from alcohol-based disinfectant, and the correlation between sputum viscosity and titre ratio was similar to that determined using artificial mucus. (vi) Pronase treatment decreased sputum viscosity and increased the disinfectant effect. To simulate viscous body fluids such as sputum, we created artificial mucus, using four types of solute (CMC, GG, XG, and gelatin) differing in terms of viscoelastic behaviour. The artificial mucus with different viscoelastic behaviours allowed us to exclude confounding factors (e.g., solute properties) and accurately analyse the correlation between viscosity and titre/viable count ratio. The protection of pathogens by artificial mucus was independent of solute properties, but was strongly correlated with viscosity. This was examined in greater detail using gel and sol forms of gelatin. Between two types of artificial mucus differing in terms of viscosity but composed of the same solutes in the same amounts (gelatin gel and sol), the one with higher viscosity (i.e., the gel form) provided greater protection to pathogens against alcohol-based disinfectants.",

Under the same convective (hand-rubbing action) conditions, a 10-fold decrease in ethanol diffusion coefficient leads to a 10-fold increase in the time required for ethanol to reach an effective concentration (complete inactivation of pathogens). When the viscosity of an environment containing pathogens increases, the diffusion coefficient of alcohol decreases, thereby extending the time needed for complete inactivation of pathogens. When a standard alcohol reaction time (30 s) is used 6, 7 , some pathogens survive, because more time is needed for their complete inactivation. Thus, viscosity is an important factor of alcohol resistance by pathogens present in mucus. We investigated whether IAV in sputum samples are protected from the effects of alcohol-based disinfectants; this model reflects the sputum of individuals infected with influenza virus. Although previous studies have reported that IAV is vulnerable to alcoholic disinfectants 27 , the present study showed that IAV present in sputum was not completely inactivated by alcohol-based disinfectants. The conditions of the inactivation test (i.e., amount of pathogen, alcohol ratio, and reaction time) were in accordance with established standards; that is, disinfectants were deemed effective when the titre ratio was \u226410 \u22124 14-17 . In the inactivation test, titre ratios were approximately 10 \u22121 , suggesting that IAV in sputum may acquire the resistance to alcohol-based disinfectants. There was a strong correlation between sputum viscosity and titre ratio; indeed, when scatter plots for tests performed on artificial mucus and sputum samples were merged, the data showed similar trends, implying that the same correlation existed for artificial mucus and sputum.",

In the current ASTM and CEN assessment standards for disinfectant effectiveness, protein loading has been shown to weaken the effectiveness of disinfectants 16, 17, 28, 29 , but the rheology of the environment containing the pathogens (mucus viscosity) should also be considered. Current hand hygiene guidelines recommend washing with water as the first choice for removing visible contamination 6, 7 . However, fine sprays of sputum or nasal fluids on hands often go unnoticed and may contain infectious substances. In this study, such sprays were mimicked in inactivation tests using small amounts (15-30 \u00b5l) of pathogen-containing mucus. Since such sprays may acquire the resistance to alcohol-based disinfectants, hand washing that washes out mucus physically remains the preferred practice for good hand hygiene. Disinfectant methods such as UV that do not require diffusion throughout the entire target to be effective are able to inactivate pathogens in viscous liquids. Such methods deserve more study in the future.

Contaminants in sputum samples may reduce the effects of alcohol-based disinfectants. However, because the titre ratio/viable count ratio were almost equivalent under various artificial mucus conditions and sputum conditions, we suggest that the influence of contaminants was small and that viscosity was the important factor in pathogen protection. Furthermore, when alcohol-based disinfectant is added to pathogen/artificial mucus and incubated, it is difficult to normalise the conditions of admixture with alcohols, which results in low reproducibility. In other words, because of the instability of convection (mixing) conditions, the inactivation/sterilization reaction may not be stable. In this study, the inactivation/ sterilization reaction was stable and reproducibility was maintained because a single experimenter conducted the experiments using a similar procedure. Although our conclusion that the titre ratio/viable count ratio increased as the viscosity increased remains valid, other groups may obtain slightly different results when repeating these experiments.",

Our findings will lead to the development of more effective products and practices for preventing HAIs. Phase II clinical trials for evaluating in vivo the effectiveness of disinfectants in mucous environments are currently underway. Preparation of artificial mucus. Artificial mucus was prepared by dissolving carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan), guar gum (GG; Wako Pure Chemical Industries), xanthan gum (XG; Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan), or gelatin (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) in either saline or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). CMC artificial mucus was prepared at concentrations of 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, and 4.0% (w/v); GG artificial mucus was prepared at concentrations of 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, 1.0%, 1.2%%, and 1.4% (w/v); XG artificial mucus was prepared at concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75%, 1.0%, 1.25%, and 1.5% (w/v); and gelatin artificial mucus was prepared at concentrations of 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, and 3.5% (w/v) and were of two types (sol and gel). For the former, gelatin was dissolved in PBS at 60 \u00b0C and cooled to 20 \u00b0C; for the latter, gelatin was dissolved in PBS at 60 \u00b0C and cooled to 4 \u00b0C for gelling, and then warmed to 20 \u00b0C before use.",

Gelatin is a mixture of peptides and proteins produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen extracted from tissues of animals. These solutes of artificial mucus are generally used to increase the viscosity of water-based products (food or drugs). After rheological analysis of viscosity, a part of each sputum sample (800 mg) was stored at 4 \u00b0C for evaluation of disinfectant effects and 200 U pronase (Kaken Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) were added to the remaining sample (800 mg) to degrade mucin and thereby reduce the viscosity. The rest of the sputum sample was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min and viscosity was measured. After rheological analysis, the pronase-treated sputum sample was stored at 4 \u00b0C for evaluation of alcohol-based disinfectant effect. Pronase, mixture of proteolytic enzymes, decomposes mucin and reduces the viscosity of mucus 33, 34 .",

A solvent trap containing distilled water prevented sample dehydration during measurement. Sputum samples or artificial mucus (750 mg) was loaded onto the rheometer for 15 min to allow relaxation to the original gel structure. Initial experiments were performed in dynamic oscillatory mode, which included a strain sweep (0.01-50%) to determine the linear viscoelastic region (0.01-10% for each tested sample). A frequency sweep (0.046-100 rad/s) was performed at 2%, and the rheological parameters of elastic modulus (elasticity) (G' , Pa), loss modulus (G\", Pa), and dynamic viscosity (\u03b7' , Pa\u00b7s) were determined in the linear viscoelastic region of each sample using Rheology Advantage data analysis software (TA Instruments) for a range of oscillation frequencies (0.046, 0.1, 0.22, 0.46, 1.0, 2.2, 4.6, 10, 22, 46, and 100 rad/s).
