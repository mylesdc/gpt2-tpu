However, the capacity of immunobiotics to improve protection against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection was not investigated before. Objective: The aims of this study were: a) to evaluate whether the nasal administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 (Lr05) and L. rhamnosus CRL1506 (Lr06) are able to improve respiratory antiviral defenses and beneficially modulate the immune response triggered by TLR3/RIG-I activation; b) to investigate whether viability of Lr05 or Lr06 is indispensable to modulate respiratory immunity and; c) to evaluate the capacity of Lr05 and Lr06 to improve the resistance of infant mice against RSV infection. Results: Nasally administered Lr05 and Lr06 differentially modulated the TLR3/RIG-I-triggered antiviral respiratory immune response. Lr06 administration significantly modulated the production of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 in the response to poly(I:C) challenge, while nasal priming with Lr05 was more effective to improve levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10. Both viable Lr05 and Lr06 strains increased the resistance of infant mice to RSV infection while only heat-killed Lr05 showed a protective effect similar to those observed with viable strains.",

Comparative studies using two Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains of the same origin and with similar technological properties showed that each strain has an specific immunoregulatory effect in the respiratory tract and that they differentially modulate the immune response after poly(I:C) or RSV challenges, conferring different degree of protection and using distinct immune mechanisms. We also demonstrated in this work that it is possible to beneficially modulate the respiratory defenses against RSV by using heat-killed immunobiotics.",

Despite the remarkable advances in antibiotic therapies, diagnostic tools, prevention campaigns and intensive care, respiratory infections are still among the primary causes of death worldwide, and there have been no significant changes in mortality in the last decades [1] . Childhood acute community-acquired pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. In children who have not received prior antibiotic therapy, the main bacterial causes of clinical pneumonia in developing countries are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b, and the main viral cause is the respiratory syncytial virus [2] .",

Primary RSV infections can cause severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia, which are associated with significantly increased risk of developing wheeze during childhood that lasts until teenage years. Symptomatic reinfections occur in every age group, but the frequency and severity of symptoms are highest in children below 5 years of age [3] . As described for several respiratory viruses, such as pandemic influenza virus strains and the human coronavirus that causes SARS, it is believed that the immune response plays a critical role in the outcome of RSV-induced bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Acute RSV infection is able to induce an exacerbated disease due to immune-mediated pulmonary injury resulting in severe morbidity and mortality [4] . Therefore, identifying novel approaches to modulate virus-induced immunopathology would be beneficial in treating acute RSV infections.",

In this regard, some studies have centered on whether immunoregulatory probiotic LAB (immunobiotics) might sufficiently stimulate the common mucosal immune system to provide protection in other mucosal sites distant from the gut [5] . The studies of our laboratory demonstrated that some orally administered LAB are able to increase S. pneumoniae clearance rates in lung and blood, improve survival of infected mice and reduce lung injuries [5] [6] [7] [8] . Moreover, we found that the effects of LAB treatments were related to an up-regulation of both respiratory innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, considering that the nasal route can induce systemic and respiratory immune responses superior to those obtained using oral stimulation [9] , we also focused on the ability of nasal stimulation with immunobiotics to improve respiratory immune responses. Our studies showed that nasally administered LAB are capable of modulating lung immunity and increase resistance against S. pneumoniae in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice and that in many cases, nasal priming is more effective than oral administration to beneficially modulate the respiratory immunity [10, 11] .",

            "text": "Recently, our laboratory studied the capacity of immunobiotics to improve respiratory antiviral immune response. To mimic the pro-inflammatory and physiopathological consequences of RNA viral infections in the lung such as those induced by RSV infection, we used an experimental model of lung inflammation based on the administration of the artificial toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) ligand and dsRNA analog poly(I:C) [12] . In vivo studies using mice demonstrated that nasally administered poly(I:C) results in TLR3-and CXCR2-dependent neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation, bronchiolar epithelial hypertrophy, interstitial edema and altered lung function [13, 14] . These changes are accompanied by elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-8, RANTES, monocyte chemotactic protein (MIP)-1, and type I interferons (IFNs) in broncho-alveolar lavages (BAL) [13] . When we evaluated the effect of two Lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 (Lr05) and L. rhamnosus CRL1506 (Lr06) in this mice model, we found that orally administered Lr05 beneficially regulate the balance between pro-inflammatory mediators and IL-10 in lung of poly(I:C)-challenged mice, allowing an effective control of the inflammatory response and avoiding tissue damage [12] . Moreover, our studies demonstrated that Lr05 is able to increase the number of CD3 + CD4 + IFN-\u03b3 + T cells in the gut, induce the mobilization of these cells into the respiratory mucosa and improve the local production of IFN-\u03b3 and the activity of lung antigen presenting cells (APCs) [12] . Our results suggested that Lr05 is a potent inducer of antiviral cytokines and may be useful as a prophylactic agent to control respiratory virus infections. However, whether the nasal priming with Lr05 is more effective than oral administration to beneficially modulate the respiratory immune response triggered by poly(I:C) challenge has not been evaluated before. Moreover, further studies using real challenges with respiratory viruses such as RSV are needed in order to conclusively demonstrate the protective effect of Lr05.",

All the treatments were also able to increase BAL IFN-\u03b3, being both viable and heat-killed L. rhamnosus CRL1505 more efficient to improve the levels of this cytokine than L. rhamnosus CRL1506 ( Figure 1A ). BAL TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 concentrations were increased by the immunobiotic nasal treatments. We observed that viable cells were more efficient to upregulate TNF-\u03b1 than heat-killed strains while no differences were found in IL-10 levels when comparing viable and heat-killed lactobacilli ( Figure 1A ). When we evaluated the levels of IL-6, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 in serum we found that lactobacilli treatments induced similar changes than those observed in the respiratory tract ( Figure 1B ). IL-6, IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 were more efficiently increased with L. rhamnosus CRL1506 treatments while the highest levels of serum IFN-\u03b3 were observed in Lr05 and HkLr05 groups ( Figure 1B ). Serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 concentrations were also enhanced by the immunobiotic nasal treatments, being viable and heat-killed lactobacilli equally effective to improve both cytokines whit the exception of HkLr06 that induced significantly lower levels of IL-10 when compared with the other treatments ( Figure 1B) .",

Nasal administration of poly(I:C) significantly increased respiratory levels of the pro-inflammatory mediators IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 ( Figure 4 ) as previously reported [12] . All lactobacilli treatments significantly increased the levels of BAL IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 however, Lr06 and HkLr06 were more efficient to enhance the concentration of these cytokines than Lr05 or HkLr05 ( Figure 4 ).

Therefore, infant mice were nasally treated with Lr05, HkLr05, Lr06 or HkLr06 and then challenged with 10 6 PFU of RSV. Viral loads in lungs of infected mice were followed for five days after the challenge ( Figure 6 ). RSV was detected in lungs of all the experimental groups during the five days postinfection and all groups showed a peak of virus counts on day 4 after the challenge. However, lactobacillitreated mice showed significantly lower lung viral loads when compared to control mice. Lr05 and HkLr05 treatments were equally effective to reduce RSV replication in lungs while in the case of L. rhamnonus CRL1506 viable bacteria was more effective than heat-killed cells to improve protection against the respiratory viral infection ( Figure 6 ). In addition, we observed significantly differences in the body weight of infected mice when comparing lactobacilli-treated mice and controls ( Figure 6 ). Lr05, HkLr05 and Lr06 significantly improved the body weight during RSV infection while HkLr06-tretated mice showed no differences when compared to controls ( Figure 6 ). We also evaluated the markers of lung tissue damage in RSV-infected mice. As showed in Figure 7 , challenge with RSV significantly increase lung wet:dry weight, BAL protein concentrations and LDH activity. All these markers of lung tissue damage were significantly higher in RSV-challenged control mice than in those previously treated with Lr05, HkLr05 or Lr06 (Figure 7) . On the contrary, lung wet:dry weight, BAL protein concentrations and BAL LDH activity in HkLr06-treated mice were not different from controls ( Figure 7) .",

We also detected that lactobacilli-treated mice showed significantly higher levels of BAL IL-6, IFN-\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 than controls, being Lr06 and HkLr06 treatments more efficient than Lr05 or HkLr05 to improve the production of these factors (Figure 8 ). In addition, levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 were significantly improved by Lr05, HkLr05 and Lr06 treatments while nasal administration of HkLr06 increased IFN-\u03b3 but not IL-10 production in the respiratory tract. Moreover, Lr05 and HkLr05 were more effective than Lr06 to increase BAL IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 concentrations in response to RSV challenge ( Figure 8 ). The effect of Lr05, HkLr05, Lr06 and HkLr06 treatments on the production of serum TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 was similar to that found in BAL (data not shown).",

Three important conclusions can be inferred from the results presented in this study: a) nasally administered Lr05 and Lr06 differentially modulate the TLR3/ RIG-I-triggered antiviral respiratory immune response; b) nasal priming with Lr05 or Lr06 strains increase the resistance of infant mice to RSV infection and; c) the viability of the immunobiotic strains is not a necessary condition to achieve the immunoregulatory protective effect. a) Nasally administered Lr05 and Lr06 differentially modulate the TLR3/RIG-I-triggered antiviral respiratory immune response. We have previously demonstrated that nasal administration of three once-daily doses of poly(I:C) resulted in a marked impairment of lung function that was accompanied by inflammatory cell recruitment into the airways and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators [12] . Accordingly, in the present work we observed increased LDH activity and albumin concentration in BAL as well as increased levels of type I IFNs, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, in the respiratory tract of poly(I:C)-challenged mice. We also showed that this immune response can be modulated with the preventive nasal administration of Lr05 or Lr06, demonstrating in addition that each strain has a different immunoregulatory effect. While Lr06 administration had a significant effect on the production of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 in the response to poly(I:C) challenge, nasal priming with Lr05 was more effective to improve levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10.",

Then, Lr06 administration would have a significant effect on respiratory epithelial cells. Taking into consideration that IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 up-regulate several genes involved in viral defense but also genes of major importance for the development of a strong Th1 response, it can be speculated that Lr06 may play an important role in the improvement of innate and specific immune responses against respiratory virus through the stimulation of antiviral defenses in epithelial cells (Figure 9 ). In addition, we have previously demonstrated that nasal administration of poly(I:C) activates respiratory MHC-II + CD11c + CD11b low CD103 + (CD103 + DCs) and MHC-II + CD11c + CD11b high CD103 -(CD11b high DCs) cells and increases CD3 + CD4 + IFN-\u03b3 + and CD3 + CD4 + IFN-\u03b3 + T cells in lungs, indicating the generation of a Th1 response [12] . The result presented here shows that nasal administration of Lr05 has the capacity to improve Th1 response since higher levels of BAL IFN-\u03b3 and lung CD3 + CD4 + IFN-\u03b3 + T cells were found in Lr05-treated mice. Moreover, we showed that Lr05 administration significantly activated CD103 + DCs, an affect that was not achieved by Lr06. Considering that recent studies suggested that lung CD103 + DCs are more potent at eliciting Th1 and Th17 responses than CD11b high DCs [21] , we can speculate that Lr05 is more efficient than Lr06 to stimulate CD103 + DCs and improve Th1 response in the respiratory tract ( Figure 9 ). Lr05, Lr06, HkLr05 or HkLr06 were nasally administered to different groups of mice for 2 consecutive days at a dose of 10 8 cells/mouse/day. After lactobacilli treatment, mice were nasally challenged with RSV and BAL cytokines were studied 12 (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6) or 48 (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10) hours after the challenge.

Moreover, the lung tissue injury markers used in this study were significantly lower in Lr05-treated mice than in those receiving the Lr06 strain.

In the last years, some lines of evidence showed that nasal administration of immunobiotics is able to increase resistance against respiratory viral infections [22] . It was reported that intranasal priming with L. rhamnosus GG to BALB\u2044 c mice significantly reduced the frequency of accumulated symptoms and induced a higher survival rate than control mice after challenge with influenza virus H1N1 [23] . Authors demonstrated that L. rhamnosus GG significantly increased lung NK cell activation and expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and MCP-1 enhancing respiratory cell-mediated immune responses. In addition, it was reported recently that nasal priming with lactobacilli is highly effective at suppressing virus-induced inflammation in a pneumonia virus mouse model [16] . Nasal priming with lactobacilli resulted in marked suppression of IFN-inducible protein-10 (CXCL10), MCP-1 (CCL2), neutrophil-activating protein-3 (CXCL1), MIP-1\u03b3 (CCL9), TNF, and eotaxin-2 (CCL24) in response to pneumovirus infection and significantly increased the resistance against the lethal disease.

This is in line with previous work reporting that RSV intranasal infection led to significant clinical characteristics in female BALB/c mice [24] . Authors described ruffled fur and ataxia that occurred early after hour 12 post-RSV infection and continued for 3 days [24] . Natural human RSV infection in children and experimental RSV inoculation in mice result in prominent local secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1, RANTES, and MCP-1 as well as type I IFNs [25] . It has been shown that type I IFNs, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 contribute to clearance of the virus during the early stages of RSV infection however, continued production of these pro-inflammatory mediators exacerbates illness and tissue injuries during the late stages of RSV infection [26] . Interestingly, it was found that IL-10 deficiency during RSV challenge did not affect viral load, but led to markedly increased disease severity with enhanced weight loss, delayed recovery and a greater influx of inflammatory cells into the lung and airways and enhanced release of inflammatory mediators [27] . Therefore, during acute RSV infection, it is imperative that the host's inflammatory response is tightly regulated, enabling virus elimination but limiting the detrimental effects of inflammation on the lung tissue. Then, an adequate balance of pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory factors is essential for a safe and effective antiviral immune response [28] . Moreover, considering that it was reported that no changes in peak viral titers or viral clearance were observed between IL-10 KO or anti-IL-10R mAb-treated mice compared with their controls [4] , preventive or therapeutic approaches aimed at increasing IL-10 production may offer a means to decrease RSV-induced immunopathology without affecting viral clearance.",

This is followed by recruitment of helper CD4 + and cytotoxic CD8 + lymphocytes to the site of infection. IFN-\u03b3 enhances the differentiation of CD8 + lymphocytes and influences the differentiation of CD4 + lymphocytes that contribute to the generation and amplification of the humoral and cellular immune responses. While the RSV-specific T cell response plays a major role in viral clearance and the clinical outcome of infection, both Th2-biased CD4 + and CD8 + T cells have been implicated in immunopathogenesis [29] . In general, a Th2 immune response is favored during RSV infection, especially in younger hosts. RSV-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice was previously found to cause a shift from Th1 to Th2 cell inflammation. RSV uses multiple mechanisms to induce a Th2 cell response in the host, including RSV G protein-mediated effects [30] , increasing IL-4 production from basophils [31] and induction of alternatively activated macrophages [32] . Moreover, the excessive mucus production, airway plugging, wheezing, and long-lasting effects on lung function that are common manifestations of RSV disease have some similarity with asthma, which involves a Th2-bias [29] . Therefore, strategies aimed to improve Th1 during RSV infection would beneficially modulate the outcome of the infections especially in younger hosts. In this work, we showed that nasally administered immunobiotics were able to improve respiratory Th1 response since significantly higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 were found in the respiratory tract of lactobacilli-treated mice. Then, modulation of respiratory immunity potentiated by the immunobiotic strains might contribute to an improved Th1 response and thereby favor protective immunity against viral infections such as RSV.",

            "text": "c) Viability of the immunobiotics strains is not a necessary condition to achieve the immunoregulatory protective effect. Few studies have demonstrated that the nasal administration of heat-killed immunobiotics is able to improve resistance against respiratory pathogens [11, 15, 16] . In this regard, earlier studies by Hori et al. [15] showed that the nasal administration of heat-killed L. casei Shirota stimulated cellular immunity in the respiratory tract and significantly increased the resistance of adult BALB/c mice to influenza virus infection. The authors investigated the production of various cytokines by mediastinal lymphoid node cells in mice receiving L. casei Shirota intranasally and found that the Shirota strain strongly induced production of IL-12 in these cells, which is an important cytokine for cytotoxic T cells and NK cells stimulation and enhancement of Th1 cytokines. In addition, both IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were improved in mediastinal lymphoid node cell cultures from mice administered L. casei Shirota intranasally, after influenza virus challenge [15] . Later it was reported that intranasal administration of heat-killed L. pentosus S-PT84 strongly enhanced Th1 immunity, IFN-\u03b1 production and NK activity in the respiratory immune system and protected against influenza virus infection [33] . In addition, as mentioned above, it was demonstrated that priming of the respiratory mucosa with lactobacilli results in full protection from the otherwise lethal severe pneumovirus infection and that protection is observed in response to both live and heat-killed L. plantarum and L. reuteri [16] . That work demonstrated that nasal treatment with heat-killed immunobiotics resulted in diminished virus recovery at multiple time points and prominent suppression in the production of virus-induced proinflammatory mediators. The results of our work are in line with these previous observations since administration of both Lr05 and HkLr05 were equally effective to improve resistance of infant mice to RSV infection and reduce lung injuries. Interestingly, although both Lr06 and HkLr06 showed a similar capacity to reduce lung RSV titers, Lr06 was more effective than HkLr06 to reduce lung injuries during RSV infection. These differential effects achieved by the four treatments would be related to their specific capacities to modulate the production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 after RSV challenge. All of them were able to improve respiratory IFN-\u03b3 levels and reduced viral loads, while Lr05, Lr06 and HKLr05 but not HkLr06 increased IL-10 and reduced lung injuries. Then our results suggest that not all the heat-killed bacteria derived from immunobiotic strains maintain the immunoregulatory effect after heat treatment. This would be an important point to consider when selecting immunoactive nonviable strains.",

The results from that study suggested that heat-killed lactobacilli are also effective in the immunomodulation of the respiratory immune system in immunocompromised hosts. Therefore, immunobiotic bacteria in the form of live cells may not be required for enhancing respiratory defenses against bacterial and viral pathogens. Our previous and present results show that non-viable immunobiotics or their cellular fractions could be an interesting alternative as mucosal adjuvants, especially in immunocompromised hosts in which the use of live bacteria might be dangerous. In addition, heat-killed immunobiotic have the advantages of allowing a longer product shelf-life, easier storage, and transportation. Therefore, to study the capacity of non-viable Lr05 or its cellular fractions to beneficially modulate the immune response against respiratory virus infections in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts is an interesting topic for future research.",

As it has been reported for orally administered probiotic bacteria, our results demonstrated that the immunoregulatory effect of nasally administered lactobacilli is a strain dependent effect. Comparative studies using two Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains of the same origin and with similar technological properties [6, 7] showed that each strain has an specific immunoregulatory effect in the respiratory tract and that they differentially modulate the immune response after poly(I:C) or RSV challenges, conferring different degree of protection and using distinct immune mechanisms. We also demonstrated in this work that is possible to beneficially modulate the respiratory defenses against RSV by using heat-killed immunobiotics. Moreover, our results showed that not all heat-killed bacteria derived from viable strains with immunomodulatory capacity, are also able to functionally modulate the respiratory immune system. Therefore, detailed studies of the immunoregulatory capacities of heat-killed immunobiotics or their cellular fractions are necessary in order to find those with the highest potential to be used for improving defenses against respiratory viruses.
