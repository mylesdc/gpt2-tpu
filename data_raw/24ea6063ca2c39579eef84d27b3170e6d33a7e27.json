This culture was grown at 37\u00b0C to optical density (OD600) 0.6. Expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-b-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and the cells were grown for 4 hours at 30\u00b0C.

This sample was thus contaminated with bacterial protein S15 [2] . Showers of needles and hexagonal crystals of up to 50 x 50 x 40 \u00b5m 3 grew in a single vapor diffusion drop where 1 \u00b5l protein solution plus 1 \u00b5l well solution (0.1M Hepes pH 7.5, 2.5 M Ammonium formate) was equilibrated against a 0.5 ml reservoir volume. Similar needles also appeared with pure PRO samples, but the hexagons were obtained only from this contaminated preparation and turned out to contain one PRO and one S15 molecule par asymmetric unit [2] . Prior to testing, crystals were transferred for ~30 s in 0.1M Hepes pH 7.5, 4 M Ammonium formate, 16% glycerol and flash frozen by plunging into liquid nitrogen. The hexagons diffracted to close to 2 \u00c5 resolution on synchrotron beamlines. We note that S15 is a much better Coomassie binder than PRO, comprising 12.4% or Arg residues ( 4.4% in PRO) [3] . The S15 contamination was thus far from stoechiometric and amounted to a few percent in mass (see Fig.1 in [2] ), possibly some 10% mol/mol. Since on the other hand, S15 is less well detected at OD280nm (calculated absorbance of 0.29 cm -1 (mg/ml) -1 ) than PRO (calculated absorbance of 0.54 cm -1 (mg/ml) -1 ), the actual PRO concentration was close to that calculated by OD280 nm without taking S15 into account.",

A shortened version of Ub lacking the C-terminal flexible tail (Ub1-71) was docked onto PRO using HADDOCK with a set of ambiguous restraints between the active residues (E825, I847 and F849 on PRO; L8, I44 and V70 on Ub) and the passive residues (positions 758, 759, 760 . Generation of 1,000 conformations through rigid-body docking was followed by refinement of the 200 best structures, which were then clustered. The largest cluster had an orientation of Ub precluding the insertion of the C-terminal tail in PRO's catalytic cleft. In contrast, the second largest cluster is compatible with such an insertion. The interface with the best HADDOCK score belongs to this second largest cluster and has a low interface backbone RMSD of 2.02 \u00c5 compared to the model chosen in the HADDOCK run with full-length Ub. This interface also involves interactions between the N-terminal lobe and Ile847 on PRO and the apolar patch on Ub supporting the selection of the model presented in the main text. Taken together, these results indicate a common most likely binding mode for the PRO/Ub interface, which was further confirmed by directed site mutagenesis experiments on Ile847, E759/N760 and L732/L765. Four successive asymmetric units along the 3 1 crystallographic screw axis are shown as C\u03b1 traces. S15 molecules are in cyan and successive PRO molecules are red, green, yellow and magenta with the C-terminal serine 879 displayed as spheres.
