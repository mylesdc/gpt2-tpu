They have a negative-polarity RNA genome segmented into eight (type A and B) or seven (type C) single-stranded molecules. Type C virus has a unique envelope glycoprotein (HEF) whereas type A and B viruses have two (HA and NA) [1] . Each genomic viral RNA (vRNA) is encapsidated by multiple nucleoproteins (NP) and associated with the polymerase complex (P) formed by three subunits named PB1, PB2 and PA for influenza A viruses and PB1, PB2 and P3 for influenza C viruses. In the nucleus of infected cells, the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are products of a transcription process involving a cap-snatching mechanism: the mRNA synthesis is initiated with capped RNA primers that are cleaved from host cell mRNAs. Transcription into mRNA terminates 17 to 22 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the 59 end of the genomic vRNA template at a stretch of five to seven uridine residues used as polyadenylation signal. The syntheses of the complementary RNAs (cRNAs) and of the vRNAs are primer-independent. Anti-termination occurs at the poly U sequence during the cRNA synthesis which, itself, is used as a template for the synthesis of the genomic vRNAs [1] .",

Two possible secondary structures formed by the 39 and 59 ends of each segment have been described: the 'panhandle structure' resulting from the base-pairing of the respective proximal and distal elements of each ends [8, 9, 10] ; and the 'corkscrew structure' that consists of hairpin loops formed by the respective proximal elements followed by base-pairing of the distal elements [11, 12, 13, 14] . These structures are known to be critical for the virus multiplication, in particular for the transcription and the replication of the vRNAs [7] . The distal element can in fact be further divided into two sub-elements: the initial distal panhandle corresponding to the first nine nucleotides (for illustration, see A1 and C1 in Fig. 1 and 2 , respectively) and the remaining distal element.",

Only the virus with type A 39 end was rescued (A8), but with a dramatically lower efficiency. Type C 59end is much longer than that of type A (102 nt vs 23 nt) [6] . To test whether this might affect the recovery efficiency, deletions were introduced in both A7 and A8 constructs to generate A9 and A10, respectively ( Fig. 1) . Surprisingly, A9 could not be rescued. The A10 virus was rescued with the same efficiency as wt. This was not surprising, since A1 and A10 differed by only two nucleotides. The role of the initial distal panhandle strength was further verified by modifying A10 to generate constructs A11 and A12 (energy barrier 11.38, 8.03 and 11.38, Fig. 1 ). No virus was rescued when the strength of the initial distal panhandle was reverted to that of A6 while maintaining the short 59 end (construct A11). On the contrary, modification of the sequence of the initial distal panhandle while maintaining the strength (A12) led to efficient rescue. These data based on type A influenza virus NP segment showed that it is possible to obtain virus by reverse genetics when a homotypic proximal panhandle and a homotypic strength of the initial distal panhandle are maintained, and that the length of the 59 end plays an important role in the efficiency of rescue. .

B) and D) Minireplicon assays. 293T cells were co-transfected with the expression plasmids coding for the nucleoprotein and the three subunits of the viral polymerase, and with the reverse genetics plasmid of interest, to reconstruct functional vRNP. Twenty four hours post transfection, total RNA were extracted, and viral vRNA and mRNA were quantified by RT-qPCR, along with the quantification of GAPDH mRNA as normalizer. Results are expressed as fold changes calculated compared to the respective wt construct mean using the DDCt method, and are the mean (6 SD) of several independent transfections (four for type A and two for type C). In order to quantify only NP mRNAs produced from the reverse genetics plasmid and not from the expression plasmid, H1N1pdm09 proteins had to be used in a type A context (B) since the primers used [48] also match PR8 NP sequence. Similarly, in the type C context (D), type A PR8 proteins were used as they were previously shown to efficiently transcribe and replicate type C pseudo-vRNA [44] . doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0109046.g003",

            "text": "The fact that no virus was rescued for construct A9 pointed out the potential role of the 39end in type specificity. Construct A13 differed from its parental construct A9 by an extension of the 16 nucleotides that precede the start codon in type A 39end in order to match the length of type A 39 end (Fig. 1) . No virus was rescued and we supposed that there might be some important specific nucleotides in the type A 39 end. To test this hypothesis, we generated constructs A14 to A17 (Fig. 1) , where point mutations were introduced in the wt A1 to replace specific nucleotides by those found in type C 39 end. The efficiency of rescue was only affected for A16, for which the strand interaction strength around the stop codon was modified (energy barrier 3.99 for A16 vs 20.7 for A1), resembling that of A9 and A13. However, all A14-A17 viruses were rescued and this could not, on its own, explain the impossibility to recover A9 and A13. Type C NP segment was demonstrated to be efficiently transcribed and replicated by type A polymerase in an artificial system based on CAT expression [6] . Although only the proximal and initial distal panhandles were described as required to initiate transcription and replication [23] , minireplicon assays using the same plasmids used for reverse genetics to generate vRNA templates showed that transcription and replication levels were only slightly affected for A16 (Fig. 3B ) and A13 constructs (data not shown), but were largely impaired for A9 construct (reduced by about a 100 fold compared to wt A1 construct). We speculate that impaired transcription/replication processes of the NP segment might not be the main obstacle to reverse genetics recovery and that, somehow, packaging of the NP segment could be prevented for A9 and A13. Influenza virus non conserved non coding regions are known to carry packaging signals [24, 25] and to be involved in intermolecular vRNA-vRNA interactions [26] . The influence of the sequences surrounding the stop codon thus needs to be further investigated, as several positions differ between A13 and A16.",

On the contrary to type A virus, for which it was observed that increasing the length of the 59 end (from 23 nt to 102 nt) impaired the recovery efficiency, one could expect that, for type C virus, the efficiency would be affected by shortening the 59 end. A reduction of 22 or 41 nt (leading to 80 and 61 nt long 59 ends, respectively) in C1 and C3 constructs had no effect on the recovery efficiency (constructs C7-C8 and C10-C11 for C1 and C3, respectively, Fig. 2 ). It was, however, affected when the 59 end length was reduced to 42 nt (constructs C9 and C12). These results confirmed the impact of the length of the NP segment 59 end on reverse genetics efficiency, as seen for type A virus. They are also in agreement with the variability in length that was observed for the two other sequenced strains of influenza type C viruses (C/California/78 and C/Ann Arbor/1/50), whose NP 59 ends are 80 nt long [6] . Finally, they could explain why C4 and C2 viruses were not rescued, since the length of their 59 end was identical to that of type A (23 nt long), so probably too short in a type C context. Extending the length in C4 59 end by 19 nucleotides to match that of C12 59 end allowed the recovery of recombinant virus by reverse genetics with a very low efficiency, but the virus could not be amplified from the reverse genetics supernatant (C13, Fig. 2) .",

The growth abilities of the particularly interesting viruses were then evaluated by growth kinetics at low multiplicity-of-infection (m.o.i). Growth abilities of the type A virus with a long 59 end (A8) were reduced compared to that of viruses with a short 59 end (A1 and A10) (Fig. 3A) . Conversely, type C viruses with a long 59 end (C1 and C3) grew better than those with a short one (C9 and C12) (Fig. 3C) . The sequences of the NC (2 PFU/cell), viral vRNA and mRNA levels for each segment were evaluated by specific two-step RT-qPCRs previously described [48] .

Minireplicon assays revealed that transcription and replication processes were only marginally affected ( Fig. 3B and 3D) and could not account for the differences observed in growth kinetics. Thus, growth kinetics confirmed the importance of the NP segment 59 end length in influenza virus cycle. Interestingly, it seems that a short 59 end is needed for efficient growth of type A viruses, whereas, on the contrary, type C viruses require a long 59 end.",

            "text": "To try and understand the impact of 59 end length on type A influenza virus cycle, the level of expression of the NP protein was assessed at early stages of infection with A1, A10 and A8. Westernblot was performed on cellular extracts collected at six hours post infection at an m.o.i. of 2 and NP/NS1 ratios were calculated (Fig. 4) . The NP protein expression was clearly reduced for the virus with a long 59 end compared to wild type (NP/NS1 ratio of 0.8 vs 2.0 for A8 and A1, respectively). No difference was found for A10 virus compared to A1 (ratio of 2.0), indicating that the long 59 end is responsible for the lower expression of the NP protein for A8. The mRNA levels were relatively similar between the three viruses (mean Cp values = 19.9760.87, 19.4760.48, 20.6560.47 for A1, A10 and A8, respectively), suggesting that translation, rather than transcription, could be mainly affected. The 59 end of NP viral mRNA is entirely complementary to the 39 end of the genomic vRNA, but the viral mRNA 39 end includes only the complementary to the non conserved NC sequence up to the polyU signal in the genomic vRNA 59 end. Consequently, whereas the NP mRNA sequences are almost identical for A1 and A10 (with only a two nucleotide difference in the sequence between the stop codon and the polyA, and no difference in the NP protein expression levels), the NP mRNA of A8 is characterized by a longer 39 untranslated region (UTR). It was shown that the 39UTR of cellular mRNAs has a critical role in gene expression regulation [27] . The mRNA 39UTR could indeed regulate every steps of translation (initiation, elongation and termination) through different mechanisms involving RNA-binding proteins, micro-RNAs or the 'closed-loop' structure formed by the mRNA 59 and 39 UTRs via the eIF4 translation initiation factors [28, 29] . Several viral families were reported to regulate the translation of their own mRNAs by such mechanisms at either the initiation (Dengue virus [30, 31] ; coxackievirus [32] ), the elongation (Tobacco mosaic virus [33] ) or the termination (Hepatitis C virus [34] ) step. We thus postulate that, in a type A influenza virus context, a long 39UTR in the NP mRNA, or specific sequence within such long 39UTR, could affect the level or the speed of translation through interactions with yet unknown cellular factors.",

More specifically, NP would be involved in the switch from capped RNA-primed transcription (protein expression) to primer-independent replication (copy of the genome). Since negative-sense RNA molecules cannot be synthesized directly from negative-sense RNAs, full-length positive-sense replicative intermediates complementary to each segment, namely cRNAs, are required as templates in influenza virus replication. The synthesis of mRNAs and cRNAs by the viral polymerase thus uses the same genomic vRNA molecules as templates, but with different initiation and termination mechanisms [35] . Different models for the role of NP in this switch from primer-dependent transcription to primer-independent replication have been proposed. The switch was first attributed to the RNA-binding properties of NP, either by stabilizing the nascent cRNA and vRNA transcripts through encapsidation [36] or by altering the RNA promoter structure [37] . However recent studies showed that changes in the equilibrium between transcription and replication could be determined by the interaction of NP with the components of the viral polymerase [38, 39] .",

Such a delay was evaluated by comparing the levels of mRNAs and vRNAs for all the segments of these two viruses at the early stages of infection (6 hours post infection at an m.o.i of 2). The crossing-point (Cp) values obtained for each kind of RNA were combined to calculate a ratio Cp-mRNA/Cp-vRNA and these ratios were compared between the two viruses. As expected according to our hypothesis, a moderate but consistent reduction of the Cp-mRNA/Cp-vRNA ratio was observed for all segments of A8 (Fig. 5) . This reduced Cp-mRNA/Cp-vRNA ratio could be attributed to a lower level of vRNA production for A8 compared to wt A1 or to a slight delay in the shift from primerdependent transcription to primer-independent replication. These results confirmed that the consequence of a lower level of NP observed by western blot for A8 was a reduction or delay in the genome replication; and this provided a convincing explanation for the slightly impaired growth abilities of A8 virus compared to wt A1 (Fig. 3A) .",

Box (SYNGENE, Cambridge, UK). NP and NS were analyzed on the same Western-blot. The densitometry quantification of viral protein band densities was performed for three independent replicates using GeneTools software (SYNGENE, Cambridge, UK) and the values were used to calculate the mean (6 SD) NP/NS1 ratios for each virus. Due to the high levels of viral protein expression during infection, protein extracts were diluted to 1/ 30 in uninfected cellular extracts prior to electrophoresis (except for the b-actin detection).
