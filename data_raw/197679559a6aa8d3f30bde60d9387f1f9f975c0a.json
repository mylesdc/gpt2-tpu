Such hospitals forwarded all respiratory samples from patients with SARI to the District Health Department. SARI was defined as any respiratory infection with a possible viral and/or bacterial origin requiring inpatient management and a clinical presentation of fever of less than 14 days after onset and higher than 38\u00b0C, shortness of breath, cough, hypoxia and systemic compromise (systemic inflammatory response syndrome or organ failure), depending on symptom severity [5] . The samples were taken via nasopharyngeal aspiration or swab. The samples were sent, together with the required basic epidemiological data collection form, through the Epidemiological Surveillance System (Sistema de Vigilancia Epidemiol\u00f3gica Nacional-Sivigila). Samples were sent in a viral transport medium to the Public Health Laboratory of the District Health Department, where they were stored between 4 and 8\u00b0C in refrigerators intended for this purpose.",

The Confusion, Urea, Respiratory Rate and Blood Pressure (CURB)-65 scores for pneumonia were applied using the criteria of age greater than or equal to 65 years, impaired consciousness, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) over 20 mg/dl, breathing rate above 30 breaths per minute and a systolic arterial pressure under 90 mmHg or a diastolic pressure under 60 mmHg [8] . Additionally, severe pneumonia was considered among patients complying with the following major and minor criteria of the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society of America (ATS/IDSA): shock, need for mechanical ventilation, thrombocytopenia (platelets under 100,000), an Arterial Oxygen Partial Pressure to Fractional Inspired Oxygen Ratio (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) ratio, multilobar compromise, impaired consciousness, leukopenia (under 4,000) and BUN over 20 mg/dl [9] . Shock was also considered when the systolic arterial pressure was below 90 mmHg or when the diastolic arterial pressure was under 60 mmHg. Moderate oxygenation impairment was defined by a PaO 2 /FiO 2 below 220 mmHg and over 160 mmHg, and severe oxygenation impairment was defined by an index less than or equal to 160 mmHg. Institutions that identified viral antigens following institutional protocols performed and interpreted these tests in their hospitals. Colonisation of the airway was defined as the presence of microorganisms in a Gram test or in a culture of the airway. Gram tests and sputum cultures or other respiratory samples were performed based on clinical decisions made by the doctor from the institution. A viral co-infection diagnosis was made when 2 or more different viruses were identified in the same sample.",

Nonetheless, the results reported here demonstrate its clinical relevance and potential utility in this field, as it appears to identify potentially severe patients and those with high complication rates; thus, the definition's routine use should be considered during the performance of clinical duties. Furthermore, current challenges in the epidemiological surveillance of viral respiratory tract infections include the early and fast identification of aetiological agents, especially at the beginnings of outbreaks, and the optimal and timely management of a large number of samples [14] . Our study suggests that molecular technology makes it possible to closely follow circulating viruses in these groups of patients. In contrast to the epidemiological definition used, the CURB-65 index of pneumonia was not useful, as only 10 (26%) scored for general hospitalization and none scored for ICUs using these criteria. This finding contrasts with the high number of our patients who required ICU care, which agrees with findings in the literature that applied this scale in cases of viral pneumonia during the Influenza A subtype H1N1 pandemic of 2009; these results demonstrate its low value for detecting either severity or the need for ICU admission in patients with viral pneumonia [15] . These findings represent a marked difference in severity stratification between Influenza-related pneumonia and pneumonia caused by other aetiological agents, indicating the importance of clinical judgement in this scenario [16] . The application of these scales in non-Influenza viral pneumonia has yet to be assessed. Moreover, a recent multicentre study of adults with radiographically confirmed pneumonia has shown that viruses are now the most commonly identified pathogens. Human Rhinovirus and Influenza virus are more frequently found than Streptococcus pneumoniae [17] . Together, viruses represent a quarter of patients and more than half of the pathogens identified.",

Countries with marked seasons report a correlation of Influenza with high mortality due to respiratory infections, which is usually related to community-acquired pneumonia [19] .

Microarray technology showed a higher sensitivity (99.5%) and similar specificity (98.5%) to real-time PCR. However, another study with the same microarray kit used in this study showed a high specificity (100%) and low sensitivity (52%) in the clinical scenario of atypical pneumonia [24] . A study in Japan using near patient automated microarray technology showed not only a higher sensitivity and specificity compared to immunochromatographic antigen detection (the gold standard used was virus isolation) but also quicker results for children infected with Influenza and RSV [25] . A recent multicentre study in the United States using real-time PCR technology was able to precisely and reproducibly detect all Adenovirus infections in a group of children and adults with respiratory infections, which increased the possibility of establishing a clear diagnosis [26] . Taken together, use of molecular technology for the diagnosis of viral infections can improve detection and identify the cases in which antibiotic use might be inadequate. The use of antibiotics in acute respiratory infections is indiscriminate and excessive, and according to worldwide literature, is employed in more than half of all respiratory infections [27] . This study determined that 90% of the cases are treated with antibiotics, although most of the infections were viral in origin. Additional strategies, such as the measurement of procalcitonin, can identify patients who would not benefit from antibiotic therapy [28] . This study has several limitations. Although it was multicentre in design, the information was gathered from only one city in Colombia. One important limitation is that it is a retrospective study; thus, it was not possible to control viral and bacterial sampling, and there was limited access to relevant data, such as previous Influenza or pneumococcal vaccination history or co-morbidity measurement. The sample size was smaller than expected, although the prevalence of viral infection was higher than expected. Together, all of these limitations lead to difficulties in establishing significant comparisons among the groups and in appropriately assessing the impact of co-morbidity and bacterial co-infection in the outcomes, especially in relation to the role of pneumococcus [29] . Other limitations include the difficulty of defining the actual roles of certain viruses, such as Bocavirus and Rhinovirus, in respiratory infection, which are also detected in asymptomatic patients according to descriptions in the literature [4] . The empirical use of antibiotics in most cases, without using additional tools to confirm bacterial infection, is also a limitation.",
