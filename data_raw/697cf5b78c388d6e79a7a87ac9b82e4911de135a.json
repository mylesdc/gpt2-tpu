The intermediate hosts of most of the human coronaviruses are known, but not for HCoV-NL63. This study aims to assess the possible role of some major domestic livestock species as intermediate hosts of HCoV-NL63. We developed a testing algorithm for high throughput screening of livestock sera with ELISA and confirmation with recombinant immunofluorescence assay testing for antibodies against HCoV-NL63 in livestock. Optimization of the ELISA showed a capability of the assay to significantly distinguish HCoV-NL63 from HCoV-229E (U = 27.50, p < 0.001) and HCoV-OC43 (U = 55.50, p < 0.001) in coronavirus-characterized sera. Evaluation of the assay with collected human samples showed no significant difference in mean optical density values of immunofluorescence-classified HCoV-NL63-positive and HCoV-NL63-negative samples (F (1, 215) = 0.437, p = 0.509). All the top 5% (n = 8) most reactive human samples tested by ELISA were HCoV-NL63 positive by immunofluorescence testing. In comparison, only a proportion (84%, n = 42) of the top 25% were positive by immunofluorescence testing, indicating an increased probability of the highly ELISA reactive samples testing positive by the immunofluorescence assay. None of the top 5% most ELISA reactive livestock samples were positive for HCoV-NL63-related viruses by immunofluorescence confirmation. Ghanaian domestic livestock are not likely intermediate hosts of HCoV-NL63-related coronaviruses.",

            "text": "The importance of cronaviruses as emerging zoonotic viruses became evident after the international public health threat caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002/2003 [1] . Thereafter, there have been several studies that looked for novel coronaviruses aimed at assessing their zoonotic potential [2] [3] [4] [5] . Coronaviruses are members of the order Nidovirales and family Coronaviridae which are made up of single-stranded positive sense RNA genomes and infect both mammalian and avian hosts. They are divided into four genera namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus [6, 7] . In 2003, a coronavirus belonging to the Alphacoronavirus genus was discovered in an infant in the Netherlands and was designated human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) [8] . This, among other coronaviruses, namely human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV predominantly cause respiratory disease [1, 9, 10] . Human coronavirus NL63 has a worldwide distribution and is known to be associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections in both adults and children with seroconversion occurring at a very early age [11, 12] . Most of the known human coronaviruses are believed to have originated from mammalian reservoirs such as bats and used other mammalian hosts as intermediate hosts before ending up in the human population. Some of these, like HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV, used camelid species [13] [14] [15] [16] , while SARS-CoV went through Himalayan palm civets as intermediate hosts [17, 18] . Further, HCoV-OC43 is reported to have originated directly from cattle [19] . Unlike these groups of coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have no known intermediate mammalian hosts. Human coronavirus NL63 is known to use the same receptor as SARS-CoV [20] , and may therefore, like some SARS-CoV-related viruses, be capable of infecting swine [21] . This assertion is, however, yet to be explored through surveillance data. Different serological studies have mainly employed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) approaches for investigating HCoV-NL63 [22] [23] [24] [25] . Most of these assays are designed for specific purposes ranging from seroprevalence studies to studies of the HCoV-NL63 genome [12, 26] , and would therefore vary in parameters like sensitivity and specificity. There is no single assay that is widely accepted as the standard for serological detection of HCoV-NL63, and this presents a challenge in the general validation of new assays. Coronaviruses have the potential to recombine to produce new viruses [27] , and as such, knowledge of potential hosts other than humans that can be infected by two human coronaviruses is important to provide information on potential sources of novel human coronaviruses that may later spillover into human populations and cause disease. Knowledge of potential intermediate hosts of human coronaviruses will also provide information on the evolution of coronaviruses in general and interspecies transmission events that lead to emergence. The purpose of this study was therefore to assess the potential of domestic livestock species as intermediate hosts for HCoV-NL63.",

For a sample to be considered positive for HCoV-NL63, it had to be in the top 5% most reactive samples as determined with the whole-virus ELISA and also positive in a confirmatory test with a more specific recombinant immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) [28] . This was the procedure adopted for swine, sheep, and goat sera. This ELISA relied on bovine products in the form of fetal calf serum in cell culture and milk powder for blocking and dilution of sera, and as such, cattle sera were tested directly with the recombinant immunofluorescence assay that had been optimized with less bovine products in the testing process to minimize background signals. Few donkey samples were obtained, and these were also tested directly with the recombinant immunofluorescence assay. A selection of coronavirus-characterized serum samples was used for assay optimization and the study samples for evaluation. All serum samples were heat inactivated at 56 \u2022 C for 30 min before testing. High-titer virus stocks of HCoV-NL63 were produced by growing the wild-type virus (kindly provided by Lina Gottula from the lab of Prof. Christian Drosten) on Rhesus monkey kidney epithelial cells (LLC-MK2). This was done by firstly growing the cells to about 80% confluence in 162 cm 2 cell culture flasks. A 1:17 dilution (v/v) of high-titer virus stock in 10-mL serum-free medium (Gibco\u2122, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) was prepared and used to infect the cells for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C. Fresh Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco\u2122, Thermo Fisher, US) supplemented with 10% Fetal calf serum (FCS) was added after infection. The flasks were incubated at 37 \u2022 C in 5% CO 2 and harvested on day seven.",

This was then used for sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) along with a recombinant HCoV-NL63 virus derived from transfected LLC-MK2 whole cell lysate. The separated proteins were then electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane of 0.2 \u00b5m pore size (Thermo Fisher, US) and blocked with 5% milk powder dissolved in 0.1% PBS-Tween \u00ae 20 (PBS-T). Following incubation with rabbit anti-Nucleocapsid and rabbit anti-Membrane primary antibodies (kindly provided by Lia van der Hoek, Department of Medical Microbiology, University of Amsterdam), the membrane was washed with PBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was subsequently analyzed with a chemiluminescent substrate, SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate kit (Thermo Fisher, US) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Conditions for sample testing were determined by testing several combinations of conditions using the protocol of an in-house recombinant MERS-CoV ELISA as reference (Appendix A) and adopting the most optimal conditions. Dilution series of antigen ranging from 12 \u00b5g/mL to 0.1875 \u00b5g/mL and conjugate ranging from 1:500 to 1:4000 were tested to determine the optimal coating concentration and optimal conjugate dilution, respectively. The determined optimal conjugate dilution for human testing was used as a starting concentration for determination of optimal conjugate dilution for livestock testing. Coronavirus-characterized sera previously tested for HCoV-NL63 by a recombinant immunofluorescence assay were used as positive and negative test sera and were tested in replicates at a starting dilution of 1:100 then compared to 1:200 for assay optimization. These sera were also in combination either positive or negative for HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 (Table 2 ) and were used to assess potential cross reactivity with other coronaviruses. These serum samples were obtained from the lab of Prof. Christian Drosten. Different substrate exposure times were also tested to determine the most optimal duration. In brief, viral protein was coated into 96-well Nunc MicroWell TM plates (Thermo Fisher, US) by diluting the stock to 0.75 \u00b5g/mL in NaCO 3 buffer (0.1 M, PH 9.6) and coating with 50 \u00b5L per well with overnight incubation at 4 \u2022 C. The plates were washed 5 times with 0.1% PBS-T then blocked with 5% milk powder (Carl Roth, Germany) in PBS-T for one hour at room temperature and the wash repeated. Serum to be tested were diluted 1:200 in 1% milk powder in PBS-T. After one-hour incubation at room temperature, plates were washed 5 times with PBS-T and goat anti-human antibody labelled with Horseradish peroxidase enzyme (Dianova GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) at a dilution of 1:2000 was added. For livestock testing, HRP-coupled donkey anti-sheep, goat anti-swine, and donkey anti-goat antibodies (Dianova GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) were used for sheep, swine, and goat testing, respectively, also at a 1:2000 dilution. The conjugate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min after which plates were washed 5 times with PBS-T and an enzyme substrate, 3,3 ,5,5 -Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Mikrogen Diagnostik, Neuried, Germany) was then added.

There was a statistically significant difference (U = 27.50, p < 0.001) as determined by the Mann-Whitney U test in mean ranks of optical density between serum 1 (mean OD = 0.33) which was positive by rIFA for both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E and serum 3 (mean OD = 0.27) which was negative for HCoV-NL63 but positive for HCoV-229E ( Figure 6A ). The difference in optical density values of serum 1 which was positive for HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 and serum 2 (mean OD = 0.19) which was negative for HCoV-NL63 but positive for HCoV-OC43 ( Figure 6B ) was also statistically significant (U = 55.50, p < 0.001).

Purification of HCoV-NL63 antigen through the sucrose medium is a method that has previously been used for HCoV-NL63 [24] and other coronaviruses [33, 34] and has been found to be an effective method of antigen purification and concentration as was seen in this study as well.

One study on SARS-CoV showed the nucleocapsid induced the production of antibody levels comparable to the whole virus and slightly higher than the spike protein [43] . The reactivity pattern observed in the present study with the full virus antigen will comprise a collective effect of specific and non-specific interactions of serum antibodies with the three main immunogenic structural proteins and other protein moieties. Although the nucleocapsid protein is the most abundantly produced during infection with HCoV-NL63 [44, 45] , the membrane protein is more abundant in the complete virion particle than nucleocapsid protein [46, 47] . This was seen in the Western blot analysis after ultracentrifugation with the sucrose cushion which evidently concentrated more complete virion particles. The immune responses observed are likely to be mainly due to the membrane protein because of its abundance in the whole virus antigen.",

The limitations with this process include possibility of high background signal due to the binding of all proteins to the wells of ELISA plates and non-specific binding of the secondary antibody [50] . The competitive ELISA technique has an added advantage of no requirement for sample clean-up and a high sensitivity to differences in composition of complex mixtures of different antigens even in the presence of relatively small quantities of the specific detection antibody [51, 52] . Whole virus antigen preparations like the one used in this study have generally been found to be more sensitive than recombinant antigen targets [53, 54] but tends to be less specific as a result of higher likelihood of non-specific binding of co-purified cellular proteins and non-target viral proteins [55, 56] .",

            "text": "Although several bat species have been found to harbor several alpha and betacoronaviruses believed to be the ancestors of endemic human coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63 [13, 23] , bats may not have been a direct source of virus transmission to humans given that, CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both make use of terrestrial mammals which are more likely to have contact with humans instead of bats as transmission hosts. Again, HCoV-229E is more closely related to their relatives in camels as compared to those in bats, indicating a probability of camels being intermediate hosts between bats and humans [14, 57] . Human coronavirus NL63 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor for infection of target cells similar to SARS-CoV [20] and has been found to be able to replicate in swine cells in vitro [58] . No antibodies to HCoV-NL63 were found in any of the pigs tested in the present study as evidence of the fact that the ability to replicate in swine cells does not imply capability to infect an actual animal since several other barriers need to be surmounted for this to happen. Based on the results of the present study it may be concluded that cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and swine may not be intermediate hosts for HCoV-NL63. However, there have not been any reports of HCoV-NL63-related viruses circulating in Ghanaian bats, and as such, a spillover opportunity may not be present, and hence no likely infection. Surveillance of local livestock populations can also be performed for antibodies in areas where such HCoV-NL63-related viruses have been detected like in Kenya to confirm this [57] .",
